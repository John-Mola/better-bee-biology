Title = {{Evaluating pollen flow indicators for an insect-pollinated plant species}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{690-697}},
Abstract = {{For insect-pollinated plant species, reproductive success and genetic
   exchange via the transfer of pollen between flowers depends (i.a.) on
   the efficiency, abundance and behaviour of floral visitors. These in
   turn are expected to respond to plant population size and flower
   density. High floral densities for example usually attract large numbers
   of pollinators that visit more flowers per plant or patch, which
   increases pollen deposition at short distances. Thus, population
   characteristics might serve as indicators for pollen dispersal patterns
   and help to identify suitable habitat size and quality for conservation
   measures. To test this hypothesis, we observed floral visitors of a
   generalist, entomophilous species, Comarum palustre, and compared their
   abundance and visitation rates in populations of different sizes and
   flower densities. At the same time, we mimicked pollen flow using
   fluorescent dye. In the large and dense populations, pollinator
   abundance and visitation rates were high and dye was dispersed to the
   edges of the populations (up to 200 m). In the medium-sized population
   with high flower density, insect abundance and visitation rates were
   unexpectedly low and dye dispersal declined very quickly. On the
   contrary, in the smallest population with scattered flowers, especially
   bumble bee abundance was similar to the large populations and dye
   dispersal mirrored this high bumble bee activity. Thus, our results
   indicate that in smaller habitat fragments, the mere size of a
   population might be insufficient to suggest pollen flow for a plant
   species. Instead, the abundance of its major pollinators should be
   considered.}},

   hypothesis of evolution among reward and rewardless flowers}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{849-861}},
Abstract = {{The tribe Pogonieae of Vanilloideae (Orchidaceae) consists of six
   genera, including Pogoniopsis, a mycoheterotrophic taxon with
   morphological characteristics distinct from the remaining of the tribe.
   A hypothesis about the phylogeny of the tribe was inferred, involving
   all currently recognized genera, based on isolated and combined sequence
   data of 5.8S, 18S and 26S (nrDNA) regions using parsimony and Bayesian
   analyses. Phylogenetic analyses show that inclusion of Pogoniopsis turns
   the tribe Pogonieae paraphyletic. All analyses reveal that Pogoniopsis
   is closely related to members of Epidendroideae. The pantropical Vanilla
   is monophyletic if Dictyophyllaria is assumed as synonym of Vanilla.
   Members of Pogonieae are pollinated by several groups of solitary and
   social bees, two pollination systems being recognized: reward-producing
   and deceptive. The molecular phylogeny suggests that ancestrals related
   to Pogonieae gave rise to two evolutionary lines: a tropical one with
   reward production of flowers, and a predominantly temperate regions
   invading line with deceptive flowers. Reward-producing flowers
   characterize the South and Central American clade (=Cleistes), while
   deceptive pollination is prominent in the clade that includes North
   American-Asiatic taxa plus the Amazonian genus Duckeella. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The genus Fragaria (Rosaceae) contains 24 plant species, including
   hybrid species such as the octoploid garden strawberry (F. x ananassa).
   Natural hybridization between Fragaria species has repeatedly been
   reported, and the potential future cultivation of genetically modified
   strawberries has made the study of hybridization potential between F. x
   ananassa and its wild relatives increasingly important. In Europe, F. x
   ananassa is the only octoploid species present, and the most likely
   candidate for hybridization is the common diploid woodland strawberry
   (F. vesca). To date, it is unknown whether pollinator spectra of the two
   Fragaria species overlap and thus might promote interspecific gene flow.
   We carried out a survey of flower visitors in northwestern Switzerland
   to identify major flower visitors of F. vesca and F. x ananassa. This
   survey indicated that wild bees are the most important shared flower
   visitors of F. x ananassa and F. vesca. Therefore, we studied flower
   choice behavior of the common wild bee Osmia bicornis in a greenhouse
   experiment. Osmia bicornis did not discriminate between F. x ananassa
   and F. vesca flowers. We conclude that wild bees are important shared
   flower visitors of both F. x ananassa and F. vesca and are potential
   vectors for gene flow between cultivated and wild strawberries. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In a recent Perspective, Gerth et al. (2011) expressed concern over how

   diversity have been noted repeatedly and rightly so in the literature

   hosts cannot be identified with a single-locus barcode, and (c)
   inferring specific WolbachiamtDNA interactions based only on incomplete
   genotyping of Wolbachia strains. We address these issues in the context
   of the Gerth et al. (2011) survey of Wolbachia prevalence among the

   Methods - We conducted breeding system experiments during 2008 and 2009
   in two populations located in the Hengduan Mountains.
   Key results - The flowers are protandrous and herkogamous, and thus
   insects are necessary for pollination and seed production. Bumblebees
   were observed to be the most frequent visitors, and their visitation
   rates were lower at the higher altitude. Seed production in both
   populations fluctuated annually, possibly due to pollen limitation,
   which occurred in both populations in the two years.
   Conclusions - The pollination level is only marginally responsible for
   the rarity of this alpine species. We suggest that in situ conservation
   measures should be given the highest priority at present, considering
   the strong genetic differentiation among populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plants in the genus Erythrina are pollinated by birds, such that
   passerine pollination is the plesiomorphic state, whereas hummingbird
   pollination is the derived character. Phylogenetic studies suggest that
   Erythrina dominguezii belongs to a basal clade characterised as
   pollinated by both passerines and hummingbirds. Here, we characterise
   the pollination system of E. dominguezii. Floral morphology, nectar
   traits, breeding system, visitation rates and pollen deposition by its
   floral visitors were studied. Floral morphology of E. dominguezii showed
   traits associated with both passerine and hummingbird pollination.
   Nectar sugar concentration showed an intermediate value but closer to
   the hummingbird type; however, it was rich in hexose, which is typical
   of the passerine type. Approximately 5\% of the flowers set fruits under
   free pollination. Almost 80\% of recorded flowers were visited by birds,
   with the rest visited by hymenopterans (bumblebees and honeybees). Among
   avian pollinators, five species of hummingbirds and three passerine
   species were identified as pollinators. The hummingbird Chlorostilbon
   lucidus was the most efficient visitor in terms of pollen deposition and
   was second in frequency of visits. The passerine Icterus cayanensis was
   second in efficiency at depositing pollen and was the most frequent
   pollinator. Our results show that E. dominguezii has a generalised
   pollination system. In addition, we report a new case of closed flowers
   and secondary nectar presentation. This is the first study that compares
   effectiveness among different pollinators in Erythrina.}},

Abstract = {{The stingless bees are an important component of the insect biomass in
   many tropical areas, due to their collection of nectar and pollen.
   Trigona spinipes is a widely distributed species in South America, and
   described as a pollinator of many crops that can be used in a commercial
   pollinating system. The effects of plant extracts on insects are studied
   because of the demand for organic food and their selectivity to natural
   enemies. Plant insecticides are reported as a potential agent for the
   control of insect pests, however little is known about their impact on
   beneficial insects. This study investigated the survival of Trigona
   spinipes (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Meliponini) Fabricius, after exposure to
   the leaf extracts of Azadiracha indica (Meliaceae), Lippia sidoides
   (Verbenaceae), Sapindus saponaria (Sapindaceae), Anonna squamosa
   (Anonnaceae) Cymbopogon winterianum (Poaceae), Corimbia citriodora
   (Myrtaceae), Jatropha curcas (Euphorbiaceae) and Ricinus communis
   (Euphorbiaceae) and of seeds of Azadiracha indica, Ricinus communis
   Nordestina and AL Guarany varieties and Jatropha curcas. The extracts
   that had the greatest influence on the survival of the bees were A.
   indica at 3\% and 7\% of concentration, A. squamosa at a concentration
   of 10\% with 68.89\% survival and green leaf of R. communis at a
   concentration of 7\%. The results show that although the extracts were
   effective in controlling pests, they may also affect the pollinator
   Trigona spinipes.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{414-426}},
Abstract = {{Flowers in the tribe Crotalarieae of the family Fabaceae are generally
   adapted to bee pollination mechanisms. Molecular systematics have
   recently provided a major step towards a profound insight into generic
   relationships, thereby creating the opportunity to re-evaluate the
   taxonomic and functional significance of flower structure in the tribe,
   with emphasis on the large genus Crotalaria. A representative sample of
   flowers from 211 species was dissected to record morphological character
   states. These data were supplemented from the literature to allow for
   generalizations for the tribe as a whole. Six structural-functional
   flower types were identified: (1) pump; (2) gullet; (3) hugging; (4)
   saddle; (5) tunnel and (6) brush (saddle and tunnel types described here
   for the first time). Crotalaria uniquely has the brush type,
   characterized by a rostrate keel, highly dimorphic anthers, stylar
   trichomes and elaborate callosities on the standard petal. Remarkably,
   Crotalaria and Bolusia are the only genera of the tribe Crotalarieae
   with callosities present in all of the species. In other genera,
   callosities are generally absent or infrequent. Trends towards
   specialization of pollination syndromes are apparent as assemblages of
   apomorphic states that co-occur in what we refer to here as
   ``specialized flowers{''}; individual characters are labile or
   non-homologous (e.g. callosities) and diagnostically less valuable.
   Unique combinations of flower characters are often useful to support
   current generic concepts in Crotalarieae. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

Title = {{Early reproductive benefits of mass-flowering crops to the solitary bee
   Osmia rufa outbalance post-flowering disadvantages}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{268-276}},
Abstract = {{Providing ample nectar and pollen, mass-flowering crops were suggested
   to counteract ongoing pollinator declines in modern agro-ecosystems.
   Lately, however, positive effects were shown to be transient and highly
   trait-specific within the social bumblebees. Contrary to bumblebees,
   solitary wild bees may benefit more sustainably from mass-flowering
   crops due to a better seasonal match of the mass provision of resources
   and their sexual reproduction. We quantified reproductive activity and
   reproductive output of the polylectic solitary bee Osmia rufa during and
   after mass-flowering in landscapes with differing amounts of oilseed
   rape and semi-natural habitats. Across seasons, the number of produced
   offspring increased with availability of oilseed rape and semi-natural
   habitats while brood abortion decreased with the former and parasitation
   with the latter. Season-specific analyses suggest that increased
   nest-building during mass-flowering of oilseed rape early in the season
   outweighs negative effects on the number of cells per nest and the
   percentage of parasitized cells once the mass-flowering has ceased. No
   effect on number of cells per nest during mass-flowering and exemplary
   pollen analysis indicate that oilseed rape benefits solitary bees in the
   form of abundant nectar for foraging flights rather than pollen for
   brood provisioning. Besides providing permanent forage and nesting
   sites, semi-natural elements seem to benefit pollinators also by
   mitigating negative effects of parasitation, potentially via enhanced
   hyperparasitism. In conclusion, O. rufa clearly benefits from
   mass-flowering oilseed rape. Yet, the outweighing of the negative
   post-flowering effects by the early benefits of oilseed rape is tightly
   linked to the bee's polylecty and early phenology. Thus, it remains to
   be tested if species unable to utilize oilseed rape due to mismatched
   oligolecty or later phenology suffer disproportionally from the
   post-flowering phase of oilseed rape.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{One of the concerns surrounding the commercial release of genetically
   modified (GM) crops is the escape of transgenes into agricultural or
   semi-natural habitats through vertical gene flow, as this may cause
   environmental or economic problems. There is also the concern that GM
   crops may affect pollinators and the pollination services they provide.
   Despite the growing commercial interest of GM tomato (Solanum
   lycopersicum), gene flow has been assessed only sparsely in tomato. To
   evaluate the likelihood of gene flow from GM tomato plants to sexually
   compatible plants, and to assess whether bumblebee activity is affected
   by GM tomato, three experiments were conducted under greenhouse
   conditions, using a Bt-tomato expressing the insecticidal Cry3Bb1
   protein as model system: (a) artificial crosses between a GM tomato
   line, two wild tomato relatives (Solanum hirsutum and Solanum nigrum)
   and a non-GM tomato variety; (b) bumblebee-mediated crosses between GM
   and non-GM tomato plants and (c) visual observations of bumblebees'
   feeding behaviour. No hybrids were obtained between the GM tomato line
   and S. hirsutum and S. nigrum. In an experimental design where non-GM
   receptor plants outnumbered GM plants by approximately 3:1, the
   bumblebee-mediated cross-fertilisation rate between GM and non-GM tomato
   plants was measured at 4.3 +/- 5.47\%. No significant differences in
   feeding behaviour of bumblebees foraging on GM and non-GM tomato plants
   were observed. Therefore, we conclude that: (a) the probability of
   transgene introgression between the GM tomato line used in this study
   and its wild relatives S. hirsutum and S. nigrum is negligible; (b)
   bumblebee activity can mediate cross-fertilisation between GM and non-GM
   tomato and (3) the Cry3Bb1-expressing tomato line tested does not
   adversely affect the feeding behaviour of bumblebees.}},

   the species richness and abundance of many common taxa, but its effects
   are often species specific and trait or context dependant. The landscape
   surrounding the focal field or farm also seems to be important.
   Landscape either enhances or reduces the positive effects of organic
   farming or acts via interactions where the surrounding landscape affects
   biodiversity or ecosystem services differently on organic and

Abstract = {{Spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera) is an important
   oilseed crop whose cultivation area has increased significantly in
   Estonia. It is predominantly autogamous but cross-pollination can have
   several positive effects, including higher seed yield. We studied the
   effect of fertilization with different foliar microfertilizers on the
   flower density and pollen and nectar production of spring oilseed rape
   as well as the impact of these factors on the abundance of flower
   visiting bees - honey bees, bumble bees and solitary bees.
   Field experiments were carried out in 2004 and 2005. The field consisted
   of 32 plots (10 m(2) each): control plots (no mineral fertilizers used),
   plots fertilized with the complex fertilizer OptiCrop (NPK 21-08-12 + S
   + Mg + B + Ca) alone and plots treated with OptiCrop and one of the six
   foliar microfertilizers (Mn, S, Cu, B, Mg, Mo). There were four
   replicates of each treatment. Flower visiting bees were counted twice a
   week on sunny days. Flowers were counted at the same time on an area of
   1 m(2) on each plot. Nectar production by the flowers was measured in
   the field by inserting a 1 mu l capillary into the corolla tube of
   flowers isolated for 24 h. Pollen grains were counted from previously
   isolated flowers after dissolving the flower tissues.
   The density of flower visiting bees (honey bees, bumble bees and
   solitary bees) on spring oilseed rape depended mainly on flower density.
   Fertilization increased not only the number of flowers but also the
   amount of nectar and pollen per flower. Additional foliar fertilization
   had no effect either on the number of flowers or the amount of pollen
   grains per flower. Nectar production per flower seemed to be inhibited
   by additional manganese. Therefore, to secure higher number of
   pollinators for achieving higher seed yield and other benefits deriving
   from cross-pollination, spring oilseed rape should be given proper
   complex fertilization. Microfertilizers turned out to be useless in
   terms of increasing the number of pollinators.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{It is accepted that the papilionaceous corolla of the Fabaceae evolved
   under the selective pressure of bee pollinators. Morphology and function
   of different parts of Coronilla emerus L. flowers were related to their
   role in the pollination mechanism. The corolla has a vexillum with red
   nectar lines, a keel hiding stamens and pistil, and two wing petals
   fasten to the keel with two notched folds. Pollinators land on the
   complex of keel and wings, trigger the protrusion of pollen and finally
   of the stigma from the keel tip. Data on pollen viability and stigma
   receptivity prove that flowers are proterandrous. The results of
   hand-pollination experiments confirmed that insects are fundamental to
   set seed. Interaction with pollinators allows not only the transport of
   pollen but also the rupture of the stigmatic cuticle, necessary to
   achieve both allogamy and autogamy. Field observations showed that
   Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera visited the flowers. Only some of
   the Hymenoptera landed on the flowers from the front and elicited
   pollination mechanisms. Most of the insects sucked the nectar from the
   back without any pollen transfer. Finally, morphological and functional
   characteristics of C. emerus flowers are discussed in terms of floral
   larceny and reduction in pollination efficiency.}},

   Diptera. The survey was conducted in 16 grassland fragments within
   agro-ecosystems in Vojvodina, as well as in surrounding fields with
   mass-flowering crops. Pollinators were identified and the Shannon-Wiener
   Diversity Index was used to measure their diversity. Five families, 7
   subfamilies, 26 genera and 63 species of insects were recorded. All four
   big pollinator groups investigated were recorded; hoverflies were the
   most abundant with 32\% of the total number of individuals, followed by
   wild bees -29\%, honeybees -23\% and bumblebees with 16\%.}},

Abstract = {{(Reproductive biology of a highly endemic species: Cipocereus laniflorus
   N.P. Taylor \& Zappi (Cactaceae)). Cipocereus laniflorus N.P. Taylor \&
   Zappi is an endemic species from the Serra do Caraca, State of Minas
   Gerais, Brazil. In order to propose conservation strategies for this
   species, its reproductive strategies were investigated, including
   reproductive phenology, floral biology, floral visitors and breeding
   system. The flowering and fruiting period extends from May to October.
   Few flowers per plant open each night, producing up to 0.4 ml nectar,
   but 30\% of them are nectarless. Probably pollen is also offered as a
   resource. Fruiting efficiency of C. laniflorus (47\%) is close to that
   found in other Cactaceae species. Pollen of this species was detected in
   Anoura geoffroy, Soricina glossophaga and Pygoderma bilabiatum bats.
   Amongst the characteristics related to bat-pollination syndrome found in
   C. laniflorus, the cream-white colouring of the internal part of the
   flower, the numerous stamens and the nocturnal anthesis of short
   duration can be highlighted. Flowers of C. laniflorus are also visited
   by Nitidulidae beetles, Trigona fulviventris bees and hummingbirds,
   however bats are the main pollinators of this species. Finally, as a
   self-sterile species, C. laniflorus needs a pollinator and is more
   susceptible to the risk of extinction if local disturbances affect its
   pollination system.}},

Abstract = {{(Nectar production and bee visits in two cultivated species of

   production on pollinator activity was tested in two cultivated species
   of passion fruit, Passiflora alata Curtis and Passiflora edulis Sims, in
   Morretes, Parana. Flower buds were bagged and the accumulated nectar of
   flowers was collected hourly. The volume and concentration of nectar of
   P alata increased during anthesis, which was associated with rising
   temperatures. The volume of nectar of P edulis increased during the
   diurnal period of anthesis, falling after 6 pm. The nectar concentration
   was constant during anthesis. The visitation rate of Xylocopa frontalis
   (Olivier) was constant for P alata (1.7 visits/100flowers/hour) and for
   P edulis (6.6 visits/100flowers/hour). The visitation rate of Bombus
   morio (Swederus) for P alata was 5.8 visits/100flowers/hour, and was
   higher at the beginning of anthesis. The constant rate of visits by X.
   frontalis may be associated to the continuous nectar production by both
   species of passionflower. Since both species are xenogamous, the
   maintenance of visits during anthesis may favor pollen flow among the
   individuals assuring good crop production.}},

   beginning of the bloom, but continued foraging for over a month after
   maturation of the crop. Pollen analyses of scopal loads indicated that
   sunflower was a major component of the diet. Bees also collected pollen
   from other Asteraceae during and after the blooming of the sunflowers.
   Pollen from Ligustrum sp. and Eucalyptus sp., two trees common in the
   hedgerows, was also collected in significant amounts. The vegetation on
   the field margins facilitated maintenance of the populations after the
   blooming of the sunflower. The two species of native Melissodes used
   pollen of plant taxa that are frequent and widespread in the Pampean

Abstract = {{Effect of Citrus floral extracts on the foraging behavior of the
   stingless bee Scaptotrigona pectoralis (Dalla Torre). Stingless bees
   have an important role as pollinators of many wild and cultivated plant
   species in tropical regions. Little is known, however, about the
   interaction between floral fragrances and the foraging behavior of
   meliponine species. Thus we investigated the chemical composition of the
   extracts of citric (lemon and orange) flowers and their effects on the
   foraging behavior of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona pectoralis. We
   found that each type of flower has its own specific blend of major
   compounds: limonene (62.9\%) for lemon flowers, and farnesol (26.5\%),
   (E)-nerolidol (20.8\%), and linalool (12.7\%) for orange flowers. In the
   foraging experiments the S. pectoralis workers were able to use the
   flower extracts to orient to the food source, overlooking plates baited
   with hexane only. However, orange flower extracts were seemingly more
   attractive to these worker bees, maybe because of the particular blend
   present in it. Our results reveal that these fragrances are very
   attractive to S. pectoralis, so we can infer that within citric orchards
   they could be important visitors in the study area; however habitat
   destruction, overuse of pesticides and the competitive override by
   managed honeybees might have put at risk their populations and thus the
   ecological services they provide to us.}},

Abstract = {{Considering the ecological importance of stingless bees as caretakers
   and pollinators of a variety of native plants makes it necessary to
   improve techniques which increase of colonies' number in order to
   preserve these species and the biodiversity associated with them. Thus,
   our aim was to develop a methodology of in vitro production of stingless
   bee queens by offering a large quantity of food to the larvae. Our
   methodology consisted of determining the amount of larval food needed
   for the development of the queens, collecting and storing the larval
   food, and feeding the food to the larvae in acrylic plates. We found
   that the total average amount of larval food in a worker bee cell of E
   varia is approximately 26.70 +/- 3.55 mu L. We observed that after the
   consumption of extra amounts of food (25, 30, 35 and 40 mu L) the larvae
   differentiate into queens (n = 98). Therefore, the average total volume
   of food needed for the differentiation of a young larva of F. varia
   queen is approximately 61.70 +/- 5.00 mu L. In other words; the larvae
   destined to become queens eat 2.31 times more food than the ones
   destined to become workers. We used the species Frieseomelitta varia as
   a model, however the methodology can be reproduced for all species of
   stingless bees whose mechanism of caste differentiation depends on the
   amount of food ingested by the larvae. Our results demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the in vitro technique developed herein, pointing to
   the possibility of its use as a tool to assist the production of queens
   on a large scale. This would allow for the artificial splitting of
   colonies and contribute to conservation efforts in native bees.}},

   This functional group was chosen as there is concern worldwide over
   pollinator decline, particularly in regions of high levels of endemism

   Species richness of monkey beetles, but not the species richness of

   management. Our findings support the hypothesis that the effects of
   landscape context and management may be taxon dependent. Monkey beetles
   have been suggested as strong indicators of disturbance. These beetles

Abstract = {{Although Japanese mango is produced under a fairly unique cultivation
   system and fetches high prices at market, further growth of the mango
   industry in Japan requires the development of new cultivars. However,
   since individual mango flowers are quite small, no more than 1 cm in
   diameter, a large number of skilled workers is necessary for artificial
   pollination, thus making it difficult to obtain a sufficient number of
   progenies for breeding. We therefore evaluated a methodology whereby
   progenies were obtained by open pollination and their male parent was
   subsequently determined by DNA markers. Two mango cultivars ('Irwin' and
   `Beni-Keitt') were arranged in a plastic house and honeybees were
   released as a pollen vector for open pollination. Harvested fruits were
   characterized and their seeds were sown in a bed. The male parent of the
   germinated seedlings was then identified by five simple sequence repeat
   (SSR) markers. As a result of SSR genotyping, the male parents of 185 of
   239 `Irwin' seedlings were revealed; 79 were obtained by
   self-pollination and 106 from out-crossing. For `Beni-Keitt', the male
   parent of 14 of the 20 seedlings was determined with two self-pollinated
   and 12 out-crossed. Preferential out-crossing in `Irwin' was revealed
   using the chi-square test, although the considerable number of
   self-pollinated fruit obtained shows that a sufficient number of fruit
   can be set in a single-planted orchard. The effect of the male parent on
   fruit characteristics was subsequently examined, revealing that in
   `Irwin' the Brix value of self-pollinated fruits was significantly
   higher than that of cross-pollinated fruits. Certain color values were,
   however, lower in self-pollinated `Irwin' fruits.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator foraging patterns and the dynamics of pollen transport
   influence the quality and diversity of flowering plant mating
   opportunities. For species pollinated by grooming pollinators, such as
   bees, the amount of pollen carried between a donor flower and potential
   recipient flowers depends on how grooming influences pollen transfer. To
   investigate the relationship between grooming and pollen-mediated gene
   dispersal, we studied bumblebee (Bombus fervidus) foraging behavior and
   resulting gene dispersal in linear arrays of Mimulus ringens. Each of
   the 14 plants in an array had a unique multilocus genotype, facilitating
   unambiguous assignment of paternity to 1050 progeny. Each plant was
   trimmed to a single flower so that pollinator movements could be linked
   directly to resulting gene dispersal patterns. Pollen-mediated gene
   dispersal was very limited. More than 95\% of the seeds sired by a donor
   flower were distributed over the first three recipient flowers in the
   visitation sequence. However, seeds were occasionally sired on flowers
   visited later in the pollinator's floral visitation sequence. Intensive
   grooming immediately following pollen removal from a donor flower
   significantly increased the decay rate of the donor flower's gene
   dispersal curve. These results suggest that the frequency and relative
   intensity of grooming can have significant effects on patterns of
   pollen-mediated gene dispersal from individual pollen donors.}},

Abstract = {{Floral traits such as color and size are highly diversified in lilies,
   but their adaptive significance remains uncertain. In the present study,
   we compared pollination processes between Lilium japonicum var. abeanum
   and var. japonicum to clarify how the two varieties are adapted to
   different pollinators. Lilium japonicum var. japonicum is known to be
   pollinated by moths, and we hypothesized from its flower traits that
   var. abeanum is pollinated by diurnal insects. Using waterproof digital
   cameras set to a recording interval of 1030 s, we recorded flower
   visitors for 79 flowers of var. japonicum and 46 flowers of var. abeanum
   over 24-h periods. We also recorded the number of versatile (T-shaped)
   and rigid (I-shaped) anthers per flower. For var. abeanum, we observed
   flowers at 05.00 and 17.00 hours to determine flower opening time and
   measured the intensity of floral scent using a metal-oxide
   semi-conductor odor sensor. Both diurnal and nocturnal insects visited
   flowers of the two varieties, but visitation of diurnal insects was more
   frequent in var. abeanum. Anthers of var. abeanum are usually rigid, as
   in many bee-pollinated flowers, whereas those of var. japonicum are
   mostly versatile. Although flowers of var. japonicum are known to open
   in the evening, 32\% of the flowers of var. abeanum started to flower
   during the day. Lilium japonicum var. abeanum emitted scent at night,
   with a maximum intensity at 20.00 hours, just as in var. japonicum.
   These findings suggest that the floral traits of the two varieties are
   adapted to the different relative availabilities of nocturnal versus
   diurnal pollinators. The flower of var. abeanum is more adapted to
   diurnal pollinators, but retains adaptations to nocturnal pollinators,
   particularly with regard to its scent.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{168}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{It is widely recognized that pollinators vary in their effectiveness in
   pollination mutualisms, due both to differences in flower-pollinator
   morphological fit as well as pollinator behaviour. However, pollination
   webs typically treat all interactions as equal, and we contend that this
   method may provide misleading results. Using empirical and theoretical
   data, we present the case study of a self-incompatible herb in which the
   number of flowers visited by a pollinator cannot be used as a surrogate
   for the total effect of a pollinator on a plant due to differences in
   per-visit effectiveness at producing seeds. In self-incompatible
   species, the relationship between interaction frequency and
   per-interaction effect may become increasingly negative as more flowers
   per plant are visited due to geitonogamous pollen transfer. We found
   that pollinators making longer bouts (i.e. visiting more flowers per
   plant visit) had an overall higher pollination success per bout.
   However, per-interaction effects tended to decrease as the bout
   progressed, particularly for pollinators that cause higher pollen
   deposition. Since the same interaction frequency may result from
   different combinations of number of bouts (plant visits) and bout length
   (flowers visited/bout), pollinators making repeatedly shorter bouts may
   contribute more to plant reproduction for the same number of flowers
   visited. Consequently, the magnitude of the differences in number of
   interactions of different insect types may be overridden by the
   magnitude of the differences in effectiveness as pollinators, even if
   the same pollinators consistently interact more frequently. We discuss
   two predictions regarding the validity of using interaction frequency as
   a surrogate for plant seed production (as a measure of total effect),
   depending on the degree of self-compatibility, plant size and floral
   display. We suggest that the role of interaction frequency must be
   tested for different species, environments, and across wider scales to
   validate its use as a surrogate for total effect in plant-pollinator
   networks.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims It has traditionally been considered that the
   flowers of Scrophularia are mainly pollinated by wasps. We studied the
   pollination system of four species which stand out for their large and
   showy flowers: S. sambucifolia and S. grandiflora (endemics of the
   western Mediterranean region), S. trifoliata (an endemic of the
   Tyrrhenian islands) and S. calliantha (an endemic of the Canary
   Islands). Our principal aim was to test whether these species were
   pollinated by birds or showed a mixed pollination system between insects
   and birds.
   Methods Censuses and captures of insects and birds were performed to
   obtain pollen load transported and deposited on the stigmas. Also, a
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of the flowers and inflorescences
   was carried out.
   Key Results Flowers were visited by Hymenoptera and by passerine birds.
   The Canarian species was the most visited by birds, especially by
   Phylloscopus canariensis, and its flowers were also accessed by
   juveniles of the lizard Gallotia stehlini. The most important birds in
   the other three species were Sylvia melanocephala and S. atricapilla.
   The most important insect-functional groups in the mixed pollination
   system were: honey-bees and wasps in S. sambucifolia; bumble-bees and
   wasps in S. grandiflora; wasps in S. trifoliata; and a small bee in S.
   calliantha.
   Conclusions The species studied show a mixed pollination system between
   insects and passerine birds. In S. calliantha there is, in addition, a
   third agent (juveniles of Gallotia stehlini). The participation of birds
   in this mixed pollination system presents varying degrees of importance
   because, while in S. calliantha they are the main pollinators, in the
   other species they interact to complement the insects which are the main
   pollinators. A review of different florae showed that the large showy
   floral morphotypes of Scrophularia are concentrated in the western and
   central Mediterranean region, Macaronesia and USA (New Mexico).}},

Abstract = {{Several groups of solitary bees, known as oil-collecting bees, gather
   lipids from flowers that offer them as their main reward to pollinators.
   In the Neotropical region, oil-collecting bees belong to the tribes
   Centridini, Tapinotaspidini, and Tetrapediini (Apidae: Apinae). The
   floral oils collected by females of these groups are used as larval food
   or in nest construction. The interaction of these bees with oil flowers
   is characterized by the presence of specialized structures for oil
   collection on the legs that morphologically match the location and type
   of the oil-producing glands on flowers they visit. In addition, these
   bees have specialized arrays of setae (including the scopae) for oil
   transport. In a few genera, both sexes display such specialized
   structures, although floral oil collection has hitherto been regarded as
   an exclusively female task. Here, we report floral oil collection by
   males of Tetrapedia, a Neotropical genus of oil-collecting bees. We
   describe behavioral aspects of oil foraging by males, present data on

Abstract = {{Some plants secrete coloured nectar to attract pollinators, but little
   is known about the chemical origins of nectar colouration and its
   ecological function. Leucosceptrum canum stands out as the only plant
   with coloured nectar recorded in the Himalayas. Here, we focused on the
   compound associated with the dark colour of the nectar, as well as its
   secretion dynamics during the flowering season and its relationship to
   pollinators. Fresh nectar was analysed by semi-preparative
   reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), LC-MS and
   HRESIMS (high resolution electronspray ionization mass spectroscopy) to
   determine which compound causes the nectar colouration. Behavioural
   experiments were conducted with birds and honeybees to elucidate the
   effect of the nectar colour and volume on pollinators. We identified a
   purple anthocyanidin, 5-hydroxyflavylium, as a natural nectar product
   for the first time. Two short-billed birds were found to pollinate this
   plant, which employs two nectar-based mechanisms to direct bird
   pollinators to reproductively active flowers, controlling nectar
   palatability and presenting a foraging signal for birds by altering
   nectar volume and colour in a developmental stage-specific manner.
   5-Hydroxyflavylium was found to be the cause of the nectar colouration,
   the function of which is to act as a foraging signal to increase

Abstract = {{(When hummingbirds are the thieves: visitation effect on the
   reproduction of neotropical snowbell Styrax ferrugineus Nees \& Mart
   (Styracaceae)). The spectrum of floral visitors associated with a
   particular plant is frequently larger than predicted by the traditional
   concept of floral syndromes and the role that unpredicted visitors play
   in plant reproduction deserves attention. Hummingbirds are frequently
   recorded visiting flowers with distinct floral syndromes, especially in
   some hummingbird flower poor ecosystem such as the Cerrado. In this
   study we investigated the effect of frequent hummingbird visits on the
   reproduction of melittophilous Styrax ferrugineus. The flowers were
   visited by many different insect groups and visits by hummingbirds were
   frequent, especially early in the morning when nectar availability was
   higher. Nectar parameters varied considerably during the flower life
   span, and was probably affected by the temperature variation during the
   day. Hummingbird exclusion experiments showed no effect in the fruit-set
   of the plant. The inability of hummingbirds to deplete all of the nectar
   produced in this mass-flowering plant, and the existence of another
   resource (pollen) for the primary pollinator (large bees), are possible
   reasons why there was no perceptible hindrance of plant reproduction by
   the hummingbirds. Although no effect in the fruit-set was observed, the
   use of non-ornithophilous flowers must be important for hummingbirds,
   which are specialized nectar consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The extreme complexity of asclepiad flowers
   (Asclepiadoideae-Apocynaceae) has generated particular interest in the
   pollination biology of this group of plants especially in the mechanisms
   involved in the pollination processes. This study compares two South
   American species, Morrenia odorata and Morrenia brachystephana, with
   respect to morphology and anatomy of flower structures, dynamic aspects
   of the pollination mechanism, diversity of visitors and effectiveness of
   pollinators.
   Methods Floral structure was studied with fresh and fixed flowers
   following classical techniques. The pollination mechanism was studied by
   visiting fresh flowers in the laboratory with artificial pollinator body
   parts created with an eyelash. Morphometric and nectar measurements were
   also taken. Pollen transfer efficiency in the flowers was calculated by
   recording the frequency of removed and inserted pollinia. Visitor
   activity was recorded in the field, and floral visitors were captured
   for subsequent analysis of pollen loads. Finally, pollinator
   effectiveness was calculated with an index.
   Key Results The detailed structure of the flowers revealed a complex
   system of guide rails and chambers precisely arranged in order to
   achieve effective pollinaria transport. Morrenia odorata is functionally
   specialized for wasp pollination, and M. brachystephana for wasp and bee
   pollination. Pollinators transport chains of pollinaria adhered to their
   mouthparts.
   Conclusions Morrenia odorata and M. brachystephana present differences
   in the morphology and size of their corona, gynostegium and pollinaria,
   which explain the differences in details of the functioning of the
   general pollination mechanism. Pollination is performed by different
   groups of highly effective pollinators. Morrenia species are specialized
   for pollination mainly by several species of wasps, a specialized
   pollination which has been poorly studied. In particular, pompilid wasps
   are reported as important pollinators in other regions outside South
   Africa. A putative new function of nectar in asclepiads is presented, as
   it would be contributing to the pollination mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Beneficial insects in agro-ecosystems provide humans with many
   invaluable ecosystem services including crop pollination and pest
   control. The creation of wildflower strips has emerged as a key tool to
   conserve beneficial insect groups in these systems. Yet, the efficacy of
   these schemes in delivering multiple ecosystem services is usually
   limited by our poor understanding of how plant species composition,
   functional traits and trait diversity affect insect visitation and
   resource use. Here we investigate the effects of plant floral traits and
   trait diversity on flower visitation by three functionally distinct
   beneficial insect groups, which provide crop pollination and pest
   control services: bumblebees, hoverflies and parasitoid wasps. We
   created plots that contained plants with either long or short-corolla
   flowers, as well as mixed plots, which contained plants presenting both
   floral traits concurrently. In functionally simple plots, insect groups
   exhibited distinct floral associations, with bumblebees being almost
   exclusively associated with long-corolla flower plots, whereas
   parasitoids and hoverflies strongly favoured plots with short-corolla
   flowers. When these flower types were planted in combination
   (mixed-trait plots), bumblebee and hoverfly visitation was maintained at
   the level of their respective preferred single-trait plot, but
   parasitoid visitation was reduced by 50\%. Thus, the informed selection
   of functionally diverse flower patches can be an effective tool to
   attract a higher diversity of insect groups than functionally simple
   plots. However, this may increase interference competition between
   visitors and limit the value of floral resources for beneficials that
   are weak competitors.}},

Title = {{TILL THE LAST DROP: HONEY GATHERING IN NIGERIAN CHIMPANZEES}},
Journal = {{ECOTROPICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-63}},
Abstract = {{Various populations of chimpanzees attack beehives to obtain honey,
   often with the help of wooden tools. However, little is known about how
   honey abundance in tropical habitats fluctuates with season and how
   chimpanzees respond to this. For a woodland-savannah habitat inhabited
   by the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee subspecies, we analyzed monthly
   proportions of flowering trees and vines as a proxy for honey
   production. We found a strict negative correlation between flowering and
   rainfall, probably because pollination benefits from dry conditions.
   Honey-gathering behavior of the Gashaka-Kwano chimpanzee community was
   reconstructed from tools abandoned at extraction sites. The apes use
   sturdy digging sticks and more slender probes, sometimes successively as
   a tool set, to access honey from subterranean and tree-dwelling colonies
   of stingless bees and honeybees. Chimpanzees exploited beehives
   throughout the year. However, during the dry season, when colonies had
   presumably hoarded more honey, hives were targeted with a greater number
   of took. This was not because chimpanzee foraging party sizes had
   increased. Instead, individual apes used more probes during a given
   honey-gathering event suggesting that clipping remained worthwhile for
   longer. In this situation, as tool tips become soft and unsuitable after
   prolonged dipping, the chimpanzees need to source new implements that
   possess hard tool points. The apes did not obtain them by breaking
   previously used tools into fragments, as these would be too short for
   successful insertions. We assume this because the average length of
   tools did not decrease with the increased number of apes that worked a
   hive. This indicates that each tool is sourced individually from raw
   material in the surroundings of the extraction site. Chimpanzees thus
   adjust the use and manufacture of tools to honey abundance, reflecting
   that the sugary fluid is a sought-after resource.}},

Title = {{Flower morphology, nectar traits and pollinators of Cerinthe major
   (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae)}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{186-196}},
Abstract = {{In April and May 2010, a natural population of Cerinthe major
   (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) was investigated with regard to: floral
   morphology, phenology, sexual receptivity during anthesis, the
   production of nectar and its sugar and amino acid content. The
   pollinator array of this species was also investigated. Cerinthe major
   has showy, pentamerous, hermaphroditic flowers with a deep yellow
   corolla tube arranged on numerous scorpioid inflorescences. Nectar and
   pollen are the main floral rewards for pollinators. The arrangement of
   stamens limits access to nectar and promotes pollen loading onto
   pollinator bodies as they force their way towards the source of nectar.
   By limiting the direct exposure of nectar to the environment, the
   corolla tube and the arrangement of anther filaments seemingly protect
   nectar from evaporation resulting from high temperatures and low
   relative humidity during flower anthesis. The green, annular nectary
   located at the base of the ovary lobes is composed of a very thin
   epidermis enclosing a dense mass of parenchyma. The epidermis lacks
   stomata, and the thin cuticle has an irregular surface. The parenchyma
   cells do not store starch during the pre-secretory stage, suggesting
   that immediate photosynthesis is the most likely source of nectar
   carbohydrates. Generally, anthesis lasts 4-5 days; the gynoecium becomes
   fully receptive on the second day and this is synchronous with anther
   dehiscence. Since nectar production begins during the bud stage, a
   substantial volume is available for flower visitors at anthesis. Nectar
   production decreases drastically in senescent flowers and, if not
   consumed, the nectar can be re-absorbed. Analysis of sugars revealed a
   sucrose-dominant nectar (sucrose=93.18 +/- 1.35\%). Proline, GABA,
   taurine, leucine, citrulline and alanine were the main amino acids
   present and are probably implicated in pollinator flight performance.
   The bees Bombus hortorum, Anthophora sp. and Eucera sp. were constant
   and frequent visitors of C. major flowers. Moreover, the manner in which
   they interacted with the flower in order to obtain nectar and pollen
   loads was sufficient evidence for their role as pollinators. Their
   different foraging behaviours suggest that each species may promote
   differences in pollen flow both within and among individuals of the
   population. (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Occurrence of secondary pollen presentation (SPP) is evidenced for
   Duperrea pavettifolia. For this, self-pollen was presented on the stigma
   and reduced fertilization was observed in this case. The receptive area
   located in the furrow of the stigma becomes receptive from the third day
   of elongation growth. Fruit set upon hand pollination with pollen from
   other individuals was significantly higher than the results of selfed,
   bagged, emasculated and control treatments. However there was no
   difference in pollen tube growth rate between selfed and crossed pollen
   on a receptive stigma. Hawkmoths and butterflies were effective
   pollinators for D. pavettifolia, but the visiting frequencies were very
   low. Stingless bees removed pollen from the unreceptive stigma which had
   no contribution to reproductive success. High level of outcrossing in D.
   pavettifolia was demonstrated by molecular analyses using the simple
   sequence repeats (SSR) method. Although the wild populations of D.
   pavettifolia are small and with fragmented distribution, the genetic
   diversity of seedlings was high, with fluctuations among years. Our
   results indicated that protandry and the visitation of stingless bees
   reduced the amount of self-pollen on the still unreceptive stigma and
   self-incompatibility prevented fertilization by un-removed self-pollen.

Abstract = {{We determined the diversity and abundance of native bees foraging on
   hedgerow flowers, and documented the plant species composition of those
   hedgerows, from October 2008 to March 2009 at Kakamega, western Kenya.
   We made observations on hedgerow sectors located in five different land
   use types: Kakamega forest; roads; sugarcane plantations; maize / bean
   fields; and grazing land. Our findings show that a high diversity of
   bees is supported by the hedgerows, and that bee diversity and abundance
   significantly (P < 0.05) differed across the five land use types. A
   total of 82 bee species belonging to three families (Apidae,
   Megachilidae and Halictidae) were recorded, with Apidae having the
   highest species richness and abundance. The suitability of hedgerow
   plants as bee forage sources differed greatly, except for Megachilid
   bees. Most important bee plants belonged to the families Acanthaceae,
   Asteraceae and Fabaceae. We conclude that hedgerow plants play an
   important role in providing bee food resources and can be used for
   managing bees in Kakamega farmed areas. We also suggest the inclusion of
   hedgerows in community based management of bees in areas where hedgerows
   are present or have viability to succeed, as they can support bee life
   and hence the pollination of crops in agricultural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Osmia rufa as a polylectic insect is used in the pollination of numerous
   plants. The usefulness of this insect for plant breeders is considerably
   limited because of the short flight periods of the insects in the
   natural environment. In order to break this limitation, the wintering
   period of the insects in cocoons is elongated. The temperature is
   maintained at 4 degrees C up to the time of plant blooming. This
   treatment does shortens the lifetime of the insects which may be the
   result of oxidative stress. Such results led to the examination of the
   selected components of antioxidative system. These components arc: total
   antioxidative status, content of glutathione and activity of peroxidase
   and glutathione S-transferase in O. rufa emerged in spring, according to
   their biological clock, and emerged in summer - after elongated
   diapause. It was observed that diapause elongation unprofitably
   influenced the antioxidative system of a bee. A statistically
   significant decrease in total antioxidative status, and activity of both
   antioixidative enzymes - peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase, was
   noted. The changes in the glutathione level in turn, were insignificant.
   In our opinion, the lower efficiency of antioxidative systems of the red
   mason bee emerged in summer, may limit their response ability to endo-
   and exogenous factors influencing oxidative stress. The results of our
   study are the first publication concerning an antioxidative system in
   mason bees.}},

Abstract = {{The four red-flowered, apparently bird-pollinated Lotus species from the
   Canary Islands have previously been classified in their own genus,
   Rhyncholotus. Currently, they are considered as a separate section
   within genus Lotus, distinct from other herbaceous Canarian congeners
   which are yellow-flowered and bee-pollinated. A combined analysis of
   four nuclear regions (including ITS and three homologues of CYCLOIDEA)
   and three plastid regions (CYB6, matK and trnH-psbA) nests the four
   bird-pollinated species within a single extant species of bee-pollinated
   Lotus (L sessilifolius), in a very extreme example of species paraphyly.
   Therefore, our data compellingly support the hypothesis that the
   Macaronesian Lotus species,with a bird pollination syndrome are recently
   derived from entomophilous ancestors. Calibration of the phylogenetic
   trees using geological age estimates of the most recent islands (La
   Palma and El Hierro) together with oldest ages of Fuerteventura
   indicates that bird pollination evolved ca. 1.7 Ma in the Canarian
   Lotus. These four bird-pollinated species share a most recent common
   ancestor (MRCA) with L sessilifolius that dates to about 2.2 Ma. Our
   analyses further suggest that the evolution of the bird pollination
   syndrome was likely triggered by the availability of new niches in La
   Palma and Tenerife as a result of recent volcanic activity. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Despite the wide inflorescence diversity among angiosperms, the effects
   of inflorescence architecture (three-dimensional flower arrangement) on
   pollinator behaviour and mating success have not been sufficiently
   studied in natural plant populations. Here, we investigated how
   inflorescence architecture affected inter- and intra-plant pollinator
   movements and consequent mating success in a field population of
   Spiranthes sinensis var. amoena (S.similar to sinensis). In this
   species, the flowers are helically arranged around the stem, and the
   degree of twisting varies greatly among individuals. The large variation
   in inflorescence architecture in S.similar to sinensis results from
   variation in a single structural parameter, the helical angle (the
   angular distance between neighbour-flower directions). The numbers of
   visits per inflorescence and successive probes per visit by leaf-cutting
   bees decreased with helical angle, indicating that individual flowers of
   tightly twisted inflorescences received less visitations. As expected
   from pollinator behaviour, pollinia removal and fruit set of individual
   flowers decreased with helical angle. Meanwhile, geitonogamy decreased
   in tightly twisted inflorescences. Our novel findings demonstrate that
   natural variation in inflorescence architecture significantly affects
   pollinator behaviour and reproductive success, suggesting that
   inflorescence architecture can evolve under pollinator-mediated natural
   selection in plant populations. We also discuss how diverse

Abstract = {{Bumblebees of the subgenus Bombus s. str. dominate (or used to dominate)
   many north temperate pollinator assemblages and include most of the

   cryptic, so that species identification from morphology may be
   impossible for some individuals and is frequently misleading according
   to recent molecular studies. This is the first review of the entire
   subgenus to: (1) avoid fixed a priori assumptions concerning the limits
   of the problematic species; and (2) sample multiple sites from across
   the entire geographic ranges of all of the principal named taxa
   worldwide; and (3) fit an explicit model for how characters change

   criteria within this evolutionary framework for recognising species. We
   analyse easily-obtained DNA (COI-barcode) data for 559 sequences from
   279 localities in 33 countries using general mixed Yule-coalescent
   (GMYC) models, assuming only the morphologically distinctive species B.
   affinis Cresson, B. franklini (Frison), B. ignitus Smith and B.

   315-327, with 3 figures.
   Floral biology, phenology, and fruit set of Anaxagorea dolichocarpa
   SPRAGUE \& SANDWITH (Annonaceae) was studied in the Atlantic forest in
   Northeast Brazil. Herein, the thick petals form a floral chamber, which
   is accessible only to small insects. Flowers are protogynous, without
   overlap between the carpellate and the staminate phase. The anthesis
   starts in the afternoon (14.00-15.00 h), and the carpellate phase lasts
   until late morning of the next day. Pollen is released in the early
   afternoon (12.00-13.00 h) on the second day of flowering. The staminate
   phase ends between 14.45 and 15.45 h with the opening and shedding of
   the petals, which overlapped with the beginning of the carpellate phase
   of the next days' flowers. Both the carpellate and the staminate phase
   are accompanied by strong fruity scent and thermogenesis of up to 3.8
   degrees C (carpellate) and 3.7 degrees C (staminate phase) above ambient
   temperature. Experiments showed that A. dolichocarpa is self-compatible,
   but pollinator-dependent for fruit set. Although stingless bees (Trigona
   sp.) regularly visit staminate phase flowers for pollen at the end of
   anthesis, only small nitidulid beetles (Colopterus spp.) were recorded
   as pollinators. They enter the floral chamber during the first hours of
   anthesis, feed on pollen during the staminate phase, and stay until the
   petals shed. Flowering is continuous and trees produce few flowers at a
   time. The beginning of visible fruit growth was delayed for a rather
   long period of up to nine months, varying strongly among single flowers.
   Seeds are dispersed by an autochorous mechanism.}},

   Most of this advance has taken place since 1970, paralleling global
   temperature increases. When the best available data are used to estimate
   analogous rates of advance for plants, these rates are not

Abstract = {{Stark contrasts in clade species diversity are reported across the tree
   of life and are especially conspicuous when observed in closely related
   lineages. The explanation for such disparity has often been attributed
   to the evolution of key innovations that facilitate colonization of new
   ecological niches. The factors underlying diversification in bees remain
   poorly explored. Bees are thought to have originated from apoid wasps
   during the Mid-Cretaceous, a period that coincides with the appearance
   of angiosperm eudicot pollen grains in the fossil record. The reliance
   of bees on angiosperm pollen and their fundamental role as angiosperm
   pollinators have contributed to the idea that both groups may have
   undergone simultaneous radiations. We demonstrate that one key
   innovation-the inclusion of foreign material in nest
   construction-underlies both a massive range expansion and a significant
   increase in the rate of diversification within the second largest bee
   family, Megachilidae. Basal clades within the family are restricted to
   deserts and exhibit plesiomorphic features rarely observed among modern
   bees, but prevalent among apoid wasps. Our results suggest that early
   bees inherited a suite of behavioural traits that acted as powerful
   evolutionary constraints. While the transition to pollen as a larval
   food source opened an enormous ecological niche for the early bees, the
   exploitation of this niche and the subsequent diversification of bees
   only became possible after bees had evolved adaptations to overcome
   these constraints.}},

   Two long-tongued species, Anthophora ursina (Apidae) and Osmia brevis

Abstract = {{The increasing evidence for population declines in bumble bee (Bombus)
   species worldwide has accelerated research efforts to explain losses in
   these important pollinators. In North America, a number of once
   widespread Bombus species have suffered serious reductions in range and
   abundance, although other species remain healthy. To examine whether
   declining and stable species exhibit different levels of genetic
   diversity or population fragmentation, we used microsatellite markers to
   genotype populations sampled across the geographic distributions of two
   declining (Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus) and four stable
   (Bombus bifarius; Bombus vosnesenskii; Bombus impatiens and Bombus
   bimaculatus) Bombus species. Populations of declining species generally
   have reduced levels of genetic diversity throughout their range compared
   to codistributed stable species. Genetic diversity can be affected by
   overall range size and degree of isolation of local populations,
   potentially confounding comparisons among species in some cases. We find
   no evidence for consistent differences in gene flow among stable and
   declining species, with all species exhibiting weak genetic
   differentiation over large distances (e.g. >1000 km). Populations on
   islands and at high elevations experience relatively strong genetic
   drift, suggesting that some conditions lead to genetic isolation in
   otherwise weakly differentiated species. B.similar to occidentalis and
   B.similar to bifarius exhibit stronger genetic differentiation than the
   other species, indicating greater phylogeographic structure consistent
   with their broader geographic distributions across topographically
   complex regions of western North America. Screening genetic diversity in
   North American Bombus should prove useful for identifying species that
   warrant monitoring, and developing management strategies that promote
   high levels of gene flow will be a key component in efforts to maintain
   healthy populations.}},

   the legume tree Senna multijuga in two differently managed protected
   areas in Southeastern Brazil: the Itatiaia National Park and the
   Environmental Protection Area of Serrinha do Alambari, front December
   2007 to December 2008. Vegetative and reproductive phenodinamycs were
   registered monthly in 80 individuals; other evaluations included 104
   observation hours for pollination (March-May 2008) in 51 inflorescences;
   besides, fruit counts, fecundity and seed predation. Sexual reproduction
   of S. multijuga depends on the transfer of pollen by large bees (Bombus,

   Bruchidae species of the genus Acanthoscelides and Sennius predate
   seeds. Vegetative and reproductive phenodynamics differed among sites.
   Our results indicated that ecological interactions were lower at the

Abstract = {{Resource preemption by alien organisms can contribute to their invasion
   success and the demise of functionally equivalent native species,
   particularly when opportunistic foraging by aliens results in more
   efficient exploitation. In forests of NW Patagonia, the only native
   bumble bee and major pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii, declined almost to
   extinction as the alien B. ruderatus increased in abundance since its
   first appearance about 17 years ago. To explore whether resource
   competition might have driven this displacement we studied the behavior
   and foraging efficiency of both bumble bees while they harvested nectar
   from flowers of Alstroemeria aurea, the main summer food resource in the
   forests of NW Patagonia. We compared the nectar content of flowers that
   bees selected, recently visited, and rejected with that of
   randomly-chosen neighboring flowers and assessed differences in
   visitation rates. The native bumble bee selects flowers with abundant
   nectar and mostly exploits nectar-rich flower patches by rejecting a
   higher proportion of flowers with little or no nectar. On the other
   hand, the alien bumble bee discriminated less with respect to sugar
   content per visited flower, but visited more flowers per minute. Workers
   of the native bumble bee harvested similar to 70\% more sugar per unit
   of time than those of the alien species in absolute terms, and a similar
   amount when sugar harvested was expressed as a percentage of body mass.
   In contrast to expectation, the opportunistic foraging of the alien
   bumblebee was not more efficient and therefore cannot explain the
   ecological extinction of the native species through exploitative
   competition. These findings suggest that the displacement of the native
   species by the alien may be driven by other factors, such as the
   associated introduction of novel diseases or parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract male insects for
   pollination. Pollinator attraction is achieved by mimicking sex
   pheromones of virgin females of their pollinators, mostly bee species.
   In earlier investigations, we showed that the phylogenetically distinct
   Ophrys species O. chestermanii and O. normanii on Sardinia attract their
   pollinator, males of the cuckoo bumblebee B. vestalis, with the same
   bouquets of relatively polar volatile compounds. In this investigation,
   we studied the sex pheromone of virgin females of B. vestalis with the
   aim of identifying male-attracting compounds and of comparing them with
   labellum extracts of the two orchids, which were found to release
   male-attracting compounds in earlier investigations (Gogler et al.
   2009). In bioassays, shock-frozen females, cuticle extracts and polar
   fractions of cuticle extracts of virgin females stimulated mating
   behaviour in the males. Using gas chromatography coupled with
   electroantennography (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography coupled with mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS), we detected in polar fractions of cuticle extracts
   of B. vestalis females the same electrophysiologically active compounds
   as in labellum extracts of both orchid species, including aldehydes,
   esters, fatty acids and alcohols. Since statistical comparisons of the
   relative proportions of esters showed strong similarities between virgin

Title = {{Diet choice of a predator in the wild: overabundance of prey and missed
   opportunities along the prey capture sequence}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Optimal diet theory (ODT) postulates that predators adjust their
   foraging decisions by calculating a prey value from the potential
   biomass gain, handling time, prey vulnerability and encounter rate.
   Tests of ODT have however so far mainly been restricted to laboratory
   settings. By video surveillance, we gathered a large data set of more
   than 2000 field observations of crab spider (Misumena vatia) encounters
   with potential prey. We then tested whether the complex ODT or two
   simpler models (prey identity and prey traits) best explain foraging
   decisions. Insect prey were killed with an average chance of 3.5\% when
   alighting on an inflorescence harboring a spider. Spiders refused to
   attack suitable prey in 46-79\% of encounters when prey was in attack
   range, indicating an over-abundance of prey relative to the needs of the
   spiders. Reduction of opportunities to capture prey along the prey
   capture sequence differed among pollinator groups, with syrphids and
   solitary bees showing strong avoidance of spiders early in the sequence
   and bumblebees resisting the final strike. Simple prey traits explained
   foraging decisions better than ODT, which was not supported. In the
   absence of food limitation, optimality decisions may be less stringent.
   The over-abundance of prey indicates that, in contrast to current
   theory, prey encounter rates are not the most important factor driving
   predator foraging decisions. Our results are highly coherent with those
   obtained in earlier field studies on patch leaving strategies and
   predator-prey encounters. Prey overabundance and non-optimal predator
   behavior are apparently not uncommon in nature, and we highlight some of
   the implications for predator-prey theory.}},

Title = {{`X' marks the spot: The possible benefits of nectar guides to bees and

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1293-1301}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Many floral displays are visually complex, transmitting
   multi-coloured patterns that are thought to direct pollinators to nectar
   rewards. These nectar guides may be mutually beneficial, if they reduce
   pollinators handling time, leading to an increased visitation rate and
   promoting pollen transfer. Yet, many details regarding how floral
   patterns influence foraging efficiency are unknown, as is the potential
   for pollinator learning to alter this relationship.
   2. We compared the responses of bumblebee (Bombus impatiens Cresson)
   foragers to artificial flowers that either possessed or lacked star-like
   patterns. By presenting each bee with two different foraging scenarios
   (patterned flowers rewarding/plain flowers unrewarding, plain flowers
   rewarding/patterned flowers unrewarding) on different days, we were able
   to assess both short- and long-term effects of patterns on bee foraging
   behaviour.
   3. Bees discovered rewards more quickly on patterned flowers and were
   less likely to miss the reward, regardless of whether corollas were
   circular or had petals. Nectar guides' effect on nectar discovery was
   immediate (innate) and persisted even after experience, although nectar
   discovery itself also had a learned component. We also found that bees
   departed patterned flowers sooner after feeding. Finally, when
   conditions changed such that flowers no longer provided a reward, bees
   visited the now-unrewarding flowers more persistently when they were
   patterned.
   4. On the time-scale of a single foraging bout, our results provide some
   of the first data on how pollinators learn to forage efficiently using
   this common floral trait. Our bees' persistent response to patterned
   flowers even after rewards ceased suggests that, rather than being
   consistently mutually beneficial to plant and pollinator, nectar guide
   patterns can at times promote pollen transfer for the plant at the
   expense of a bee's foraging success.}},

Abstract = {{There have been serious global declines in diversity of bumblebees,
   butterflies and other pollinating insects. The most effective means of
   increasing abundance and diversity of bumblebees on farmland is to sow
   simple, low cost mixtures of dicotyledons rich in pollen and nectar, as
   prescribed under the UK agri-environment schemes. The potential benefits
   of this management prescription for butterflies are unknown. Similarly,
   more information is needed on how to manage this habitat to maximise the
   provision of pollen and nectar resources whilst protecting breeding
   habitat for butterflies. This study aimed to devise mixtures and cutting
   management regimes which address these issues. We found significant
   effects of seed mixture, timing and frequency of cutting, and removal of
   cut material on vegetation composition, flower resource availability and
   pollinators (the abundance, species richness and temporal distribution
   of butterflies and bumblebees, including males and queens, attracted to
   the mixtures). We recommend that nectar flower mixtures are refined by
   the inclusion of the best performing species to provide mid- and
   late-season forage resources (Trifolium spp., Lotus corniculatus and
   Centaurea nigra), and the removal of competitive grass species. Summer
   cutting in May or early June, with removal of herbage where possible,
   should be applied to half the patch to extend the flowering season, and
   minimise damage to butterfly breeding habitat. This should be
   accompanied by the typical autumn cut to the whole patch. Even with best
   management practice, such nectar flower mixtures are only effective for
   3-4 years and this should be recognised in policies aimed at enhancing
   pollinator populations in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The western bumble bee. Bombus occidentalis, is included on the red list

   pollination of greenhouse crops. In extensive surveys conducted in
   western and southern Oregon, 10 individuals have been recorded since
   2000. In this note, we report the collection of 49 individual B.
   occidentalis over two years in the Zumwalt Prairie Preserve of

   geographic isolation from or potential resistance to the pathogens that
   decimated populations in the western part of the region. Further

   was needed after pupal eclosion. Transmission of beneficial gut bacteria
   could therefore represent an important benefit of sociality. Our results

Abstract = {{Agricultural land use results in direct biodiversity decline through
   loss of natural habitat, but may also cause indirect cross-habitat
   effects on conservation areas. We conducted three landscape-scale field
   studies on 67 sites to test the hypothesis that mass flowering of
   oilseed rape (Brassica napus) results in a transient dilution of bees in
   crop fields, and in increased competition between crop plants and
   grassland plants for pollinators. Abundances of bumble-bees, which are
   the main pollinators of the grassland plant Primula veris, but also
   pollinate oilseed rape (OSR), decreased with increasing amount of OSR.
   This landscape-scale dilution affected bumble-bee abundances strongly in
   OSR fields and marginally in grasslands, where bumble-bee abundances
   were generally low at the time of Primula flowering. Seed set of Primula
   veris, which flowers during OSR bloom, was reduced by 20 per cent when
   the amount of OSR within 1 km radius increased from 0 to 15 per cent.
   Hence, the current expansion of bee-attractive biofuel crops results in
   transient dilution of crop pollinators, which means an increased
   competition for pollinators between crops and wild plants. In
   conclusion, mass-flowering crops potentially threaten fitness of
   concurrently flowering wild plants in conservation areas, despite the
   fact that, in the long run, mass-flowering crops can enhance abundances
   of generalist pollinators and their pollination service.}},

   Insect Pathologies}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Chitin and cuticle coatings are important to the
   environmental and immune defense of honey bees and insect pollinators.
   Pesticides or environmental effects may target the biochemistry of
   insect chitin and cuticle coating. Denaturing of chitin involves a
   combination of deacetylation, intercalation, oxidation,
   Schweiger-peeling, and the formation of amine hydrochloride salt. The
   term ``denatured chitin{''} calls attention to structural and property
   changes to the internal membranes and external carapace of organisms so
   that some properties affecting biological activities are diminished.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A case study was performed on honey bees
   using silver staining and microscopic computer-tomographic x-ray
   radiography (micro-CT). Silver nitrate formed counter-ion complexes with
   labile ammonium cations and reacted with amine hydrochloride. Silver was
   concentrated in the peritrophic membrane, on the abdomen, in the glossa,
   at intersegmental joints (tarsi), at wing attachments, and in tracheal
   air sacs. Imaged mono-esters and fatty acids from cuticle coating on
   external surfaces were apparently reduced by an alcohol pretreatment.
   Conclusions/Significance: The technique provides 3-dimensional and
   sectional images of individual honey bees consistent with the
   chemistries of silver reaction and complex formation with denatured
   chitin. Environmental exposures and influences such as gaseous nitric
   oxide intercalant, trace oxidants such as ozone gas, oligosachharide
   salt conversion, exposure to acid rain, and chemical or biochemical
   denaturing by pesticides may be studied using this technique.
   Peritrophic membranes, which protect against food abrasion,
   microorganisms, and permit efficient digestion, were imaged. Apparent
   surface damage to the corneal lenses of compound eyes by dilute acid
   exposure consistent with chitin amine hydrochloride formation was
   imaged. The technique can contribute to existing insect pathology
   research, and may provide an additional tool for research on CCD.}},

Title = {{Forest Fragmentation and Selective Logging Have Inconsistent Effects on
   Multiple Animal-Mediated Ecosystem Processes in a Tropical Forest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation and selective logging are two main drivers of
   global environmental change and modify biodiversity and environmental
   conditions in many tropical forests. The consequences of these changes
   for the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems have rarely been
   explored in a comprehensive approach. In a Kenyan rainforest, we studied
   six animal-mediated ecosystem processes and recorded species richness
   and community composition of all animal taxa involved in these
   processes. We used linear models and a formal meta-analysis to test
   whether forest fragmentation and selective logging affected ecosystem
   processes and biodiversity and used structural equation models to
   disentangle direct from biodiversity-related indirect effects of human
   disturbance on multiple ecosystem processes. Fragmentation increased
   decomposition and reduced antbird predation, while selective logging
   consistently increased pollination, seed dispersal and army-ant raiding.
   Fragmentation modified species richness or community composition of five
   taxa, whereas selective logging did not affect any component of
   biodiversity. Changes in the abundance of functionally important species
   were related to lower predation by antbirds and higher decomposition
   rates in small forest fragments. The positive effects of selective
   logging on bee pollination, bird seed dispersal and army-ant raiding
   were direct, i.e. not related to changes in biodiversity, and were
   probably due to behavioural changes of these highly mobile animal taxa.
   We conclude that animal-mediated ecosystem processes respond in distinct
   ways to different types of human disturbance in Kakamega Forest. Our
   findings suggest that forest fragmentation affects ecosystem processes
   indirectly by changes in biodiversity, whereas selective logging
   influences processes directly by modifying local environmental
   conditions and resource distributions. The positive to neutral effects
   of selective logging on ecosystem processes show that the functionality
   of tropical forests can be maintained in moderately disturbed forest
   fragments. Conservation concepts for tropical forests should thus
   include not only remaining pristine forests but also functionally viable
   forest remnants.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Tropical South America is rich in different groups of pollinators, but
   the biotic and abiotic factors determining the geographical distribution
   of their species richness are poorly understood. We analyzed the species
   richness of three groups of pollinators (bees and wasps, butterflies,
   hummingbirds) in six tropical forests in the Bolivian lowlands along a
   gradient of climatic seasonality and precipitation ranging from 410 mm
   to 6250 mm. At each site, we sampled the three pollinator groups and
   their food plants twice for 16 days in both the dry and rainy seasons.
   The richness of the pollinator groups was related to climatic factors by
   linear regressions. Differences in species numbers between pollinator
   groups were analyzed by Wilcoxon tests for matched pairs and the
   proportion in species numbers between pollinator groups by correlation
   analyses. Species richness of hummingbirds was most closely correlated
   to the continuous availability of food, that of bees and wasps to the
   number of food plant species and flowers, and that of butterflies to air
   temperature. Only the species number of butterflies differed
   significantly between seasons. We were not able to find shifts in the
   proportion of species numbers of the different groups of pollinators
   along the study gradient. Thus, we conclude that the diversity of
   pollinator guilds is determined by group-specific factors and that the
   constant proportions in species numbers of the different pollinator
   groups constitute a general pattern.}},

Abstract = {{1. Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense Lour.) was removed from riparian
   forests in the Piedmont of Georgia in November 2005 by mulching with a
   track-mounted mulching machine or by chainsaw felling. The remaining
   privet in the herbaceous layer was killed with herbicide in December
   2006.
   2. Bee (Hymentoptera: Apoidea) abundance, diversity and community
   similarity in the forests were measured for 2 years after shrub removal
   and compared with heavily invaded controls and with non-invaded forests
   (desired future condition) using pan traps.
   3. In 2006, control plots averaged 8.8 species and 34.8 bees per plot.
   Privet mulching resulted in 32.5 bee species and 418.3 bees per plot,
   and privet felling plots had 29 species and 259 bees per plot. In 2007,
   control plots averaged only10 species per plot and 32.8 bees per plot,
   while mulched and felled plots had 48 and 38 species per plot and 658.2
   and 382.5 bees per plot, respectively.
   4. The bee community on untreated control plots was dissimilar from the
   communities on privet felling, mulched and desired future condition
   plots during both years; however, by 2007, desired future condition,
   felling and mulched plots had similar bee communities.
   5. Removal of an invasive shrub provided immediate benefits for native
   pollinators and resulted in bee communities similar to non-invaded
   forests even without further restoration of native plant communities.}},

Title = {{Increased bumblebee abundance along the margins of a mass flowering

Abstract = {{Although the practice of cultivating mass flowering crops (MFCs) is seen
   as a means of counteracting the widespread decline of insect
   pollinators, no study to-date has evaluated whether the increased
   pollinator abundance associated with MFCs influences pollinator visits
   to assemblages of adjacent native, non-crop plant species (pollinator
   `spill-over'). In this study we quantified bumblebee abundance along
   hedgerow transects in MFC (field bean) vs non-MFC (wheat) margins.
   Surveys were conducted on east and west-facing margins twice daily
   (morning and afternoon) for three or four days during the main MFC
   flowering period (June) over four years involving paired bean and wheat
   fields in Devon and Cornwall, southwest England. Although no single
   bumblebee species showed any consistent change in relative frequency,
   when taken across all years and bumblebee species combined, we observed
   twice as many bumblebees visiting flowers adjacent to the MFC. However,
   when we compared bumblebee activity along hedgerow transects two weeks
   after bean flowering, there was no difference between crops. We thus
   conclude that although there is evidence for pollinator spillover from
   the bean MFC to nearby semi-natural habitat, the effect is comparatively
   short lived and not specific to any single bumblebee species. We also
   suggest that while pollinator services to native plant species might be
   briefly enhanced by MFC cultivation, the possible repercussions of
   bumblebee spill-over from MFCs to semi-natural habitats and the other
   pollinator groups they support should be evaluated before MFC
   cultivation is considered as a means of conserving declining bumblebee
   populations.}},

Title = {{Pollen limitation and inbreeding depression in an `old rare'
   bumblebee-pollinated grassland herb}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{857-864}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and reduction of population size have been found
   to negatively affect plant reproduction in `new rare' species that were
   formerly common. This has been attributed primarily to effects of
   increased inbreeding but also to pollen limitation. In contrast, little
   is known about the reproduction of `old rare' species that are naturally
   restricted to small and isolated habitats and thus may have developed
   strategies to cope with long-term isolation and small population size.
   Here we study the effects of pollen source and quantity on reproduction
   of the `old rare' bumblebee-pollinated herb, Astragalus exscapus. In two
   populations of this species, we tested for pollen autodeposition,
   inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression. Caged plants were left
   unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen from the same plant, from
   the same population or from a distant population (50 km). Additionally,
   we tested for pollen limitation by pollen supplementation in four
   populations of different size and density. In the absence of
   pollinators, plants did not produce seed whereas self-pollinated plants
   did. This indicates a self-compatible breeding system dependent on
   insect pollination. Both self-pollination and, in one of the two
   populations, cross-pollination with pollen from plants from the distant
   population resulted in a lower number of seeds per flower than
   cross-pollination with pollen from plants from the resident population,
   indicating inbreeding and outbreeding depression. Pollen addition
   enhanced fruit set and number of seeds per flower in three of the four
   populations, indicating pollen limitation. The degree of pollen
   limitation was lowest in the smallest but densest population. Our
   results suggest that, similar to `new rare' plant species, also `old
   rare' species may be at risk of inbreeding depression and pollen
   limitation.}},

   Thermal tolerances of life stages and a survey of nesting depths}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Periodic wildfire defines plant community composition and dynamics in
   many of the world's semi-arid biomes, whose climates and floras also
   favor wild bee diversity. Invasive flammable grasses, deforestation,
   historical fire suppression and human ignition are increasing fire
   frequency and intensifying its severity, as well as introducing fire to
   previously fireproof biomes. In many of these habitats, bees are key
   pollinators. Many, often most of the solitary bee species and
   individuals in these biomes nest underground (so-called ``mining{''}
   bees). To evaluate their susceptibility to fire, we tested heat
   tolerances of bees' four life stages using an experimental design that
   mimicked heat conduction dynamics of natural soils. All life stages
   survived heating of up to 45 degrees C for 27 min, but none survived
   heating at 54 degrees C for 9 min; the pupal stage survived best. At
   near-lethal temperatures, more prolonged heating caused more mortality.
   These data were related to published studies of heat penetration depths
   in soil during fire and an exhaustive compilation of published nesting
   depths reported for mining bees. We conclude that a small fraction (9\%)
   of the shallowest-nesting mining bee species is likely to die from soil
   heating by wildfire. Among these, ground-nesting megachilids (Osmia,
   Megachile) will be most vulnerable, owing to their shallow horizontal
   nests. Because mining bees prevail in most biomes of the temperate zone,
   any vegetation rehabilitation efforts should therefore expect that bee
   communities will largely survive the immediate effects of wildfire, and
   therefore will need pollen and nectar resources in the year(s) after
   fire. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Multimodal communication plays an important role in pollination biology.
   Bees have evolved multimodal communication to recruit nestmates to

   information to recruit nestmates to rich food sources. However, no
   studies have determined if this information is redundant or has an
   additive effect such that multimodal information is more attractive than
   either modality presented by itself to free-flying bees. We tested the
   effect of two modalities, forager-deposited odor marks and the visual
   presence of foragers, on the orientation of stingless bee (Scaptotrigona
   mexicana) recruits. Our results show that odor marks alone were
   significantly more attractive than multimodal information, and that
   multimodal information was significantly more attractive than visual
   forager presence alone. Given the high olfactory sensitivity and limited
   visual acuity of insects, odor marks likely attracted recruits over a
   greater distance than the visual presence of nestmates. Thus, multimodal
   information in S. mexicana is redundant, not additive, in terms of
   orientation to food sources.}},

Abstract = {{The red mason bee (Osmia bicornis L) is a common wild bee in urban
   environments which contributes to early-season pollination. We know only
   little about how any species of wild bee in cities responds to resource
   distribution or landscape structure and the urban habitat(s) that they
   prefer. We employed a citizen science approach to investigate drivers
   behind the spatial distribution of this solitary bee in the urban region
   of Leipzig (Germany). Volunteers hung trap nests at different locations
   and collected information on eight local, microsite conditions (such as
   sun exposure, attachment position, local flower availability). We
   derived 14 landscape factors from a digital GIS biotope data map (e.g.
   distance to flower sites and urban matrix properties such as size and
   edge length of patches). Both occurrence and abundance of O. bicornis
   were then analyzed using a combination of machine learning and multiple
   (logistic) regression. The results indicate that the red mason bee is
   ubiquitous in urban area but clearly profits from nearby floral
   resources. Although we expected a balanced influence of landscape
   factors and microsite conditions, we found that hang location of the
   trap nest was most important, followed by sun exposure. Cities with many
   fine-scaled floral resources (such as private gardens but not parks) and
   an open housing structure with higher sun exposure between buildings
   provide a good environment for cavity-nesting bees such as O. bicornis.
   In places without suitable nesting opportunities, artificial nest can
   support the bees. 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Due to loss of natural habitats, human-dominated green spaces are likely
   to increase in importance for biodiversity support. We assessed the
   potential value of urban ``green roofs{''} for native pollinator
   conservation in the Chicago region, comparing them with reference
   habitats of tallgrass prairie natural areas and traditional city-park
   green spaces. We found that native bees are present on green roofs,
   though at lower abundance and diversity than in reference habitats.
   Green-roof and prairie bee communities were distinct from each other,
   while those in parks were intermediate and similar to the other two
   habitat types. Bee-community patterns were related to habitat
   characteristics at both the site and landscape scales. Overall, bee
   abundance and species richness increased with greater proportions of
   green space in the surrounding landscape. However, this relationship
   disappeared in cases where green space was dominated by turf grass. At
   the site scale, bees benefited from greater plant diversity, and bee and
   plant-community composition were significantly correlated. Green roofs
   are potentially valuable sites for bee conservation in urban areas,
   particularly if planted with diverse native forbs to provide foraging
   resources, and designed to accommodate bees with different nesting

   rewards, the sharp increase of viscosity with sugar concentration makes

   concentration that optimizes energy transport depends exclusively on the
   drinking technique employed. We identify three nectar drinking
   techniques: active suction, capillary suction, and viscous dipping. For
   each, we deduce the dependence of the volume intake rate on the nectar
   viscosity and thus infer an optimal sugar concentration consistent with
   laboratory measurements. Our results provide the first rationale for why
   suction feeders typically pollinate flowers with lower sugar
   concentration nectar than their counterparts that use viscous dipping.}},

Title = {{Field Margins, Foraging Distances and Their Impacts on Nesting
   Pollinator Success}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{The areas of wild land around the edges of agricultural fields are a
   vital resource for many species. These include insect pollinators, to
   whom field margins provide both nest sites and important resources
   (especially when adjacent crops are not in flower). Nesting pollinators
   travel relatively short distances from the nest to forage: most species
   of bee are known to travel less than two kilometres away. In order to
   ensure that these pollinators have sufficient areas of wild land within
   reach of their nests, agricultural landscapes need to be designed to
   accommodate the limited travelling distances of nesting pollinators. We
   used a spatially-explicit modelling approach to consider whether
   increasing the width of wild strips of land within the agricultural
   landscape will enhance the amount of wild resources available to a
   nesting pollinator, and if it would impact differently on pollinators
   with differing foraging strategies. This was done both by creating field
   structures with a randomised geography, and by using landscape data
   based upon the British agricultural landscape. These models demonstrate
   that enhancing field margins should lead to an increase in the
   availability of forage to pollinators that nest within the landscape.
   With the exception of species that only forage within a very short range
   of their nest (less than 125 m), a given amount of field margin
   manipulation should enhance the proportion of land available to a
   pollinator for foraging regardless of the distance over which it
   normally travels to find food. A fixed amount of field edge manipulation
   should therefore be equally beneficial for both longer-distance nesting
   foragers such as honeybees, and short-distance foragers such as solitary
   bees.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators provide a critical ecosystem service by pollinating
   many wild flowers and crops. It is therefore essential to be able to

Abstract = {{(Sexual ratio and floral biology of the dioecious Neea theifera Oerst.
   (Nyctaginaceae) in a cerrado rupestre of central Brazil). Dioecy is
   characterized by a complete separation of sexual functions on male and
   female plants. It has evolved many times in flowering plants and is
   widespread among distinct Angiosperm families. It is viewed as a
   reproductive strategy to reduce endogamy, and to promote optimal
   resource allocation between male and female sexual functions. Neea
   theifera is a common species in Cerrado, neotropical savannas in Brazil,
   but information regarding its reproductive biology is still incomplete.
   In order to investigate how environmental conditions possibly affect
   this dioecious species, we studied its floral biology, sex ratio and
   spatial distribution of sexual morphs along a soil-altitudinal gradient.
   The sex ratio did not significantly deviate from the expected 1:1 ratio.
   However, flower abundance in the population was significantly biased
   towards staminate flowers. Female individuals were larger than male
   individuals and plant size was negatively correlated with altitude, but
   did not differ between sexual morphs. The population did not show
   spatial segregation of sexes and male individuals were sexually mature
   earlier than female ones. Staminate flowers were larger than pistillate
   flowers and presented high pollen viability. Meliponini bees, small
   flies and thrips were potential pollinators, but pollination success was
   very low. Dioecy in N. theifera corroborates many general features of
   this reproductive strategy, such as woody habit, inconspicuous flowers,
   pollination by small generalist insects and differential resource
   allocation between male and female plants. However, reproduction in this
   species seems to be impaired by pollinator limitation. The results
   showed that the soil-altitude gradient influenced the growth pattern of
   the species and may play an important role in its reproductive biology
   but did not affect dioecy directly.}},

   Estimation of outcrossing rates in Koompassia malaccensis from an
   open-pollinated population in Peninsular Malaysia using microsatellite
   markers. Koompassia malaccensis (Leguminosae), locally known as kempas,
   is an important tropical timber species in South-East Asia. Although
   studies have shown that most tropical tree species are predominantly
   outcrossing, there is no empirical support for this species prior to
   this study, with regard to its mating system. Information on its
   reproductive biology is also scanty. We report the estimation of the
   outcrossing rates of K malaccensis using microsatellite markers, based
   on a fruiting season at the Semangkok Forest Reserve, Selangor.
   Microsatellite analysis was performed for an average of 46 seeds each
   from nine adult K malaccensis trees, using four polymorphic
   microsatellite loci (Kma050, Kma067, Kma147 and Kma180). Single and
   multilocus population outcrossing estimates (t(s) and t(m) respectively)
   were determined using the software MLTR version 3.0. Results showed that
   this timber species was predominantly outcrossing (t(m) = 0.890).
   Biparental mating t(m) - t(s)) was very low, only 0.026, suggesting low
   tendency of mating between relatives. Outcrossing estimates obtained for
   individual mother trees were in the range of 0.637 to 0.994. The
   relatively lower outcrossing rates exhibited by a few progeny arrays
   indicated that K. malaccensis was not completely self-incompatible.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Evolution involves the interplay between natural
   selection and phylogenetic constraint. This is particularly evident
   among the flowering plants where form and diversity of flowers attest to
   the importance of both pollinator-mediated selection and phylogenetic
   constraint. Although this has been studied mostly using visible floral
   characters, invisible volatile chemicals emitted by the flowers should
   be subject to these same evolutionary forces. Unfortunately, most
   analyses of floral volatiles have over-emphasized the importance of
   natural selection and underplayed phylogenetic constraint without
   quantifying their respective roles in the evolution and composition of
   floral scents.
   Methods: We used multivariate analyses to test the relative importance
   of pollinators vs. phylogeny in determining the composition of floral
   scents among oil-secreting orchids in southern Africa. Floral scents of
   42 oil-secreting taxa/ecotypes distributed among 12 subclades in the
   tribe Diseae were sampled using headspace adsorption and gas
   chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
   Key results: We identified 257 scent compounds distributed over nine
   different compound classes, with the majority of scents dominated by
   aliphatic or benzenoid compounds. The only significant predictor of
   floral scent among these orchids above the species level was phylogeny.
   Nevertheless, in two of the clades there were differences in scent
   profiles at the species and ecotype level that corresponded to different
   pollinators and were thus suggestive of pollinator-mediated selection.
   Conclusions: Scent variation was greater than expected and phylogeny was
   more important than pollinator-mediated selection in predicting the
   composition of floral scents of oil-secreting orchids, despite the
   specialized nature of the pollinator reward system.}},

Abstract = {{1. Establishing temporal habitat patches, such as long-term set-aside,
   is potentially a valuable approach to support pollinator populations in
   intensively cultivated landscapes. The benefits of this approach are
   expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental
   differences in their ecology.
   2. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and
   diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation
   succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The
   pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50 x 50 m), sown
   with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives)
   and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins.
   3. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession
   were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive
   response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and
   their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and
   abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting
   differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment
   of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field
   margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was
   not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less
   pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing
   treatment on either species group were detected.
   4. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession
   was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species
   (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In
   butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was
   strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most
   successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal
   moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different
   pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing
   set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term
   set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The
   occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by
   additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as
   well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to
   be in place for several years.}},

Abstract = {{One major characteristic of invasive alien species is their occurrence
   at high abundances in their new habitat. Flowering invasive plant
   species that are visited by native insects and overlap with native plant
   species in their pollinators may facilitate or disrupt native flower
   visitation and fertilisation by forming large, dense populations with
   high numbers of flowers and copious rewards. We investigated the
   direction of such a proposed effect for the alien invasive Rhododendron
   ponticum in Irish habitats. Flower visitation, conspecific and alien
   pollen deposition, fruit and seed set were measured in a self-compatible
   native focal plant, Digitalis purpurea, and compared between field sites
   that contained different relative abundances of R. ponticum. Flower
   visitation was significantly lower at higher alien relative plant
   abundances than at lower abundances or in the absence of the alien.
   Native flowers experienced a significant decrease in conspecific pollen
   deposition with increasing alien abundance. Heterospecific pollen
   transfer was very low in all field sites but increased significantly
   with increasing relative R. ponticum abundance. However, lower flower
   visitation and lower conspecific pollen transfer did not alter
   reproductive success of D. purpurea. Our study shows that indirect
   interactions between alien and native plants for pollination can be
   modified by population characteristics (such as relative abundance) in a
   similar way as interactions among native plant species. In D. purpurea,
   only certain aspects of pollination and reproduction were affected by
   high alien abundances which is probably a result of high resilience due
   to a self-compatible breeding system. Native species that are more
   susceptible to pollen limitation are more likely to experience fitness
   disadvantages in habitats with high relative alien plant abundances.}},

   were investigated between a focal species, Pedicularis monbeigiana, and
   a co-flowering species, Vicia dichroantha, which was mediated by
   behaviour alteration of the shared bumble-bee pollinator.
   Methods Floral display size and floral colour change of P. monbeigiana
   were compared between pure (P. monbeigiana only) and mixed (P.
   monbeigiana and V. dichroantha) plots in two populations. Pollinator
   visitation rates, interspecific floral switching and successive
   within-plant pollinator visits were recorded. In addition, supplemental
   pollination at plant level was performed, and the fruit set and seed set
   were analysed in pure and mixed plots with different densities of P.
   monbeigiana.
   Key Results Pollinator visitation rates were dramatically higher in
   mixed plots than in pure plots. The higher pollinator visitation rates
   were recorded in both low-and high-density plots. In particular,
   successive flower visits within an individual plant were significantly
   lower in mixed plots. Supplemental pollination significantly increased
   fruit set and seed set of individuals in pure plots, while it only
   marginally increased seed set per fruit of plants in mixed plots.
   Conclusions The presence of V. dichroantha can facilitate pollination
   and increase female reproductive success of P. monbeigiana via both
   quantity (mitigating pollinator limitation) and quality (reducing
   geitonogamy) effects. This study suggests that successive pollinator
   movements among flowers within a plant, as well as pollinator visitation
   rates and interspecific flower switching, may be important determinants
   of the direction and mechanisms of interaction between species.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Molecular evidence indicates that the Neotropical
   sub-tribe Zygopetalinae is sister to Maxillariinae. Most members of the
   latter sub-tribe have deceit pollination strategies, but some species
   produce rewards such as nectar, pseudopollen, resin and wax, and are
   pollinated by a range of pollinators that include stingless bees
   (Meliponini), wasps and hummingbirds. By contrast, relatively little is
   known about the pollination of Zygopetalinae species. However, some are
   pollinated by fragrance-gathering, male euglossine bees or employ nectar
   deceit strategies. The aim of this study is to describe the labellar
   micromorphology of Zygopetalinae and to compare it with that of
   Maxillariinae sensu lato (s.l.) as part of an ongoing project to record
   the range of labellar characters found within the tribe Maxillarieae,
   and to assess whether these characters represent synapomorphies or
   homoplasies resulting from similar pollination pressures.
   Methods The labella of 31 species of Zygopetalinae, including
   Cryptarrhena R. Br. and representatives of the Zygopetalum, Huntleya and
   Warrea clades, were examined using light microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy, and the range of labellar characters was recorded.
   These characters were subsequently compared with those of Maxillariinae
   s.l. which formed the subject of our previous investigations.
   Key Results and Conclusions The labellar micromorphology of
   Zygopetalinae is less diverse than that of Maxillariinae and does not
   reflect the currently accepted phylogeny of the former sub-tribe based
   on molecular studies. Instead, the relative uniformity in labellar
   micromorphology of Zygopetalinae is probably due to homoplasies
   resulting from similar pollinator pressures. Labellar trichomes are
   relatively uncommon in Zygopetalinae, but occur in certain members of
   both the Zygopetalum and Huntleya clades. Trichomes are unbranched,
   uniseriate and multicellular with rounded apices, or unbranched and
   unicellular, with tapering, pointed and flexuose apices. Hitherto,
   unicellular trichomes of this kind have been observed only for
   euglossophilous orchid taxa, and the adoption of a relatively limited
   range of pollination strategies by Zygopetalinae may have resulted in
   reduced investment in micromorphological labellar characters.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and abundance of wild bees ensures the delivery of
   pollination services and the maintenance of ecosystem diversity. As
   previous studies carried out in Central Europe and the US have shown,
   bee diversity and abundance is influenced by the structure and the
   composition of the surrounding landscape. Comparable studies have so far
   not been carried out in the Mediterranean region. The present study
   examines the influence of Mediterranean landscape context on the
   diversity and abundance of wild bees. To do this, we sampled bees in 13
   sites in olive groves on Lesvos Island, Greece. Bees were assigned to
   five categories consisting of three body size groups (small, medium and
   large bees), the single most abundant bee species (Lasioglossum
   marginatum) and all species combined. The influence of the landscape
   context on bee abundance and species richness was assessed at five radii
   (250, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 m) from the centre of each site. We found
   that the abundance within bee groups was influenced differently by
   different landscape parameters and land covers, whereas species richness
   was unaffected. Generally, smaller bees' abundance was impacted by
   landscape parameters at smaller scales and larger bees at larger scales.
   The land cover that influenced bee abundance positively was olive grove,
   while phrygana, conifer forest, broad-leaved forest, cultivated land,
   rock, urban areas and sea had mostly negative or no impact. We stress
   the need for a holistic approach, including all land covers, when
   assessing the effects of landscape context on bee diversity and
   abundance in the Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat degradation and fragmentation are widespread phenomena in
   tropical regions. Negative effects on the biota are numerous, ranging
   from interruption of gene flow among populations, to the loss of genetic
   diversity within populations, to a decline in species richness over
   time. Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are of major
   conservation interest due to their function as pollinators of numerous
   orchid species and other tropical plants. Here, we used microsatellite
   markers to investigate the effects of geographic distance and habitat
   fragmentation on gene flow among populations. Populations of Euglossa
   dilemma in three geographic regions-the Yucatan peninsula (Mexico),
   Veracruz (Mexico), and Florida (USA)-were genetically structured
   predominantly across the regions, with the strength of differentiation
   among populations being positively correlated with geographic distance.
   Within geographic regions only little substructure was found, suggesting
   that dispersal is substantial in the absence of geographic or ecological
   barriers. In a second study, patterns of genetic differentiation among
   eight species of Euglossa were not related to habitat fragmentation
   following deforestation in southern Mexico (Veracruz). Specifically,
   most bee populations in the 9,800 ha forest remnant of Los Tuxtlas
   (Volcano San Martin) were neither differentiated from, nor had less
   genetic diversity than, populations in near-continuous forest separated
   from Los Tuxtlas by 130 km of agricultural land. Either occasional long
   distance dispersal across open areas has buffered the expected genetic
   effects of fragmentation, or the history of fragmentation in southern
   Mexico is too recent to have caused measurable shifts in allelic

Abstract = {{In Brazil, the family Gesneriaceae is represented by 23 genera and
   approximately 200 species. Seemannia sylvatica is an herb that occurs in
   dense populations in the riverbeds at Serra da Bodoquena. Goals of this
   study were to report the floral biology (on the first five days of
   anthesis), as well as to determine the breeding system and the
   pollinators of S. sylvatica. Data collection was conducted from June
   2005 to July 2006 through monthly field trips, lasting for five days.
   Data on floral biology, breeding system and on the floral visitors were
   taken from individuals located along a track 2500 m long, in riparian
   forest of Salobrinha river. Flowers of S. sylvatica are tubular, red,
   with no perceptive odor and lasted more than five days (ca. 10 - 20 days
   in individuals transferred to an urban garden and kept in vases).
   Seemania sylvatica is protandrous, and the male phase occurred between
   the first and the fourth days of anthesis, while the female one started
   in the fifth day. Mean nectar volume secreted was 4.77 +/- 3.2 mu l,
   with a significative variation among flowers of different ages.
   Otherwise, nectar concentration average was 9.71 +/- 4.41\%, and did not
   varied significantly in flowers of different ages. The flowers of S.
   sylvatica were pollinated mainly by the hummingbirds Phaethomis pretrei
   and Thalurania furcata, and pierced by the bee Ceratina clitoris. The
   butterfly Parides anchises orbygnianus was considered an occasional
   pollinator of these flowers. Seemannia sylvatica is self-compatible,
   since fruit set occurred on the experiments of spontaneous
   self-pollination, manual self-pollination, cross-pollination and open
   pollination (control). The protandry, coupled with the pattern of nectar
   production, characterized by low volume and solute concentration, which
   induces the pollinators to visit different flowers in a given circuit
   foraging, act maximizing the likelihood of cross-pollination in
   S.,sylvatica. Moreover, the high proportion of fruit set by autogamy is
   an important strategy considering that S. sylvatica is visited by few
   species, being pollinated mainly by P. pretrei. Therefore, in the
   absence of these visitors, the formation of fruits may be achieved.}},

   postfire succession to insect pollinator diversity in an imperiled
   ecosystem. Canadian Field-Naturalist 125(4): 297-306. The apparent
   importance of successional habitat to pollinating insects, specifically
   bees (Hymenoptera) and butterflies (Lepidoptera) was quantified in an
   alvar landscape in the Ottawa valley through a comparison of burned and
   unburned alvar woodland. The two adjacent habitats on the same
   successional gradient were sampled by sweeping with additional data from
   pitfall traps for bees and by direct observation with close focus
   binoculars and occasional verification through capture with a net for
   butterflies. The sampling was done during 11 visits in 2008 beginning 16
   May and ending 13 September. Both bee and butterfly diversity were
   higher in the post-fire burned alvar woodland compared to the adjacent
   unburned woodland based on species richness, number of individuals and
   Brillouin's Biodiversity Index which takes evenness and heterogeneity
   into account. No bees were captured in the unburned area, but 34 species
   and 201 individuals were captured in the burned site. The most abundant
   bee species was Augochlora aurata. Lepidoptera were represented in the
   burned site by 35 species and 408 individuals compared to 15 species and
   21 individuals in the unburned woodland. The most common butterfly
   species in the burned woodland was Callophrys polios. The higher
   diversity of pollinators in the burned site was correlated with both
   higher vascular plant diversity and much higher cover and frequency
   values for insect-pollinated plants providing nectar and pollen
   including flowering shrubs such as Amelanchier alnifolia var. compacta,
   Arctostaphylos uva-ursi and Prunus virginiana. The burned site also
   provided more cover of larval food plants for butterflies and apparently
   more nesting sites for bees. We suggest that a decrease in fire
   frequency and in the availability of open successional habitats are
   contributing factors in the decline of pollinators, and that endangered
   ecosystems where fire has been a natural phenomenon may require fire or
   fire-simulated management to sustain their biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{There are at least two immediate reasons why it is important to
   determine the role of biotic interactions, such as pollination, in
   limiting species distribution ranges. Firstly, if range limits are
   imposed by biotic factors, current and future distribution ranges might
   not be constrained by climate. Secondly, if biotic interactions limit
   the distribution ranges of species, anthropogenic impacts on these
   interactions are likely to have a major effect on biodiversity. Here we
   test the role of pollination in limiting plant distributions by studying
   plant community assembly in a guild of 15 oil-secreting orchids
   (Coryciinae) along a pollination gradient. In all members of the guild,
   seed production depends on pollination by the oil-collecting bee
   Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae). While the mode of aboveground
   reproduction is uniform across the guild, the orchid species differ
   widely in their capacity for belowground clonal reproduction through the
   formation of bulbils, and hence span a range of predicted dependence on
   pollination (and subsequent seed set) for population persistence.
   Pollination rate by R. peringueyi varied across the landscape from 0 to
   98\% of flowers pollinated. With decreasing pollination, species
   richness of the orchid guild declined, and species were lost by the
   successive deletion of the least clonal species. Thus, pollination is
   shown to act as a biotic filter, excluding non-clonal species from
   pollinator-poor communities. The findings are consistent with the idea
   that pollination mutualisms matter ecologically by limiting the
   distribution of non-clonal plants. Conversely, the results suggest that
   clonality allows some plant species to escape from the range of their
   pollinators.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Background: Flower visiting insects provide a vitally important
   pollination service for many crops and wild plants. Recent decline of
   pollinating insects due to anthropogenic modification of habitats and
   climate, in particular from 1950's onwards, is a major and widespread
   concern. However, few studies document the extent of declines in species
   diversity, and no studies have previously quantified local abundance
   declines. We here make a quantitative assessment of recent historical
   changes in bumblebee assemblages by comparing contemporary and
   historical survey data.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We take advantage of detailed,
   quantitative historical survey data from the 1930's on bumblebee (Bombus
   spp.) abundances and species composition in red clover (Trifolium
   pratense) fields, an important floral resource and an attractant of all
   bumblebee species. We used the historical survey data as a
   pre-industrialization baseline, and repeated the same sampling protocol
   at nearly the same localities at present, hence setting up a historical
   experiment. We detected historical changes in abundances (bees/m(2)) of
   both workers (the ``pollinatory units{''}) and queens (effective
   population size), in addition to species composition. In particular,
   long-tongued bumblebee species showed consistent and dramatic declines
   in species richness and abundances throughout the flowering season of
   red clover, while short-tongued species were largely unaffected. Of 12
   Bombus species observed in the 1930's, five species were not observed at
   present. The latter were all long-tongued, late-emerging species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Because bumblebees are important pollinators,
   historical changes in local bumblebee assemblages are expected to
   severely affect plant reproduction, in particular long-tubed species,
   which are pollinated by long-tongued bumblebees.}},

Abstract = {{Most flowering plants establish mutualistic associations with insect

   We reconstructed the times of divergence, diversification patterns, and

   bee pollinators. In contrast to a scenario of coevolution by race
   formation, we show that fragrance-producing orchids originated at least
   three times independently after their fragrance-collecting bee
   mutualists. Whereas orchid diversification has apparently tracked the
   diversification of orchids' bee pollinators, bees appear to have
   depended on the diverse chemical environment of neotropical forests. We
   corroborated this apparent asymmetrical dependency by simulating
   co-extinction cascades in real interaction networks that lacked
   reciprocal specialization. These results suggest that the
   diversification of insect-pollinated angiosperms may have been

Abstract = {{Conspecifics are usually considered competitors negatively affecting
   food intake rates. However, their presence can also inform about
   resource quality by providing inadvertent social information. Few
   studies have investigated whether foragers perceive conspecifics as
   informers or competitors. Here, we experimentally tested whether
   variation in the density of demonstrators ('none', `low' and `high'),
   whose location indicated flower profitability, affected decision-making
   of bumble-bees Bombus terrestris. Bumble-bees foraged on either `simple'
   (two colours) or `complex' (four colours) artificial floral communities.
   We found that conspecifics at low density may be used as sources of
   information in first flower choices, whereas they appeared as
   competitors over the whole foraging sequence. Low conspecific densities
   improved foragers' first-visit success rate in the simple environment,
   and decreased time to first landing, especially in the complex
   environment. High conspecific densities did not affect these behavioural
   parameters, but reduced flower constancy in both floral communities,
   which may alter the efficiency of pollinating visits. These results
   suggest that the balance of the costs and benefits of conspecific
   presence varies with foraging experience, floral community and density.
   Spatio-temporal scales could thus be an important determinant of social
   information use. This behavioural flexibility should allow bumble-bees
   to better exploit their environment.}},

   hanging traps to collect individuals in the continuous native forest, in
   four small forest remnants and in two Pinus radiata plantations
   (matrix). We measured the body size (mm) and the length of the first and
   the second pairs of wings (mm) of each individual collected. In all, 280
   individuals were captured. The body size and the length of both the
   first and the second pairs of wings were higher in the forest fragments
   and the matrix than in the continuous forest. A significant positive
   relationship between wing length and body size was observed for all
   habitats, but the percentage of variance explained was lower in the
   continuous forest than in the fragments and the matrix. These results
   suggest that the fragmentation of the Maulino forest would favor
   phenotypes with larger wings. It is probable that these phenotypes would
   be best at flying and obtaining scarce resources during foraging.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of bees has raised concerns regarding their conservation and
   the maintenance of ecosystem services they provide to bee-pollinated
   wild flowers and crops. Although the Mediterranean region is a hotspot
   for bee species richness, their status remains poorly studied. There is
   an urgent need for cost-effective, reliable, and unbiased sampling
   methods that give good bee species richness estimates. This study aims:
   (a) to assess bee species richness in two common Mediterranean habitat
   types: semi-natural scrub (phrygana) and managed olive groves; (b) to
   compare species richness in those systems to that of other biogeographic
   regions, and (c) to assess whether six different sampling methods (pan
   traps, variable and standardized transect walks, observation plots and
   trap nests), previously tested in other European biogeographic regions,
   are suitable in Mediterranean communities. Eight study sites, four per
   habitat type, were selected on the island of Lesvos, Greece. The species
   richness observed was high compared to other habitat types worldwide for
   which comparable data exist. Pan traps collected the highest proportion
   of the total bee species richness across all methods at the scale of a
   study site. Variable and standardized transect walks detected the
   highest total richness over all eight study sites. Trap nests and
   observation plots detected only a limited fraction of the bee species
   richness. To assess the total bee species richness in bee diversity
   hotspots, such as the studied habitats, we suggest a combination of
   transect walks conducted by trained bee collectors and pan trap
   sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Study of the pollination biology of endangered species can provide
   useful information for natural resource managers. We studied the floral
   biology of Xyris tennesseensis, a federally endangered species, at a
   site (Willett Springs) in north central Alabama. We described floral
   behavior and flowering phenology, supplemented pollen onto stigmas from
   self and outcross sources to determine its effect on seed production and
   germination ability, documented the floral visitor fauna, and collected
   data on behavior, abundance and pollen loads of floral visitor species
   during two years (1998-99). Flowering of the population lasted from July
   to September each year, but individual flowers completed blooming in
   about a 3-hr period beginning in late morning. On average, a single
   flower was visited by three insects for a total of five floral visits
   during its brief period of anthesis. Floral visitation was greatest when
   flowers first opened and declined steeply by the time flowers began to
   close. Halictid bees were the most abundant floral visitors, along with
   four species of pollen-consuming syrphid flies. Based upon quantity of
   pollen carried, location on the body, and visitation frequency, we
   concluded that the halictid bee Lasioglossum zephyrum was the single
   most important pollinator species on the study site. However, the pollen
   supplementation study showed that flowers produce seeds without
   visitation by insects, likely by self-pollination. We concluded that,
   unlike some endangered plant species, insect pollination is not required
   for seed production by X. tennesseensis.}},

Abstract = {{European Union (EU) member states set aside between 5 and 15\% of arable
   land during the last two decades, but abolition of the set-aside scheme
   in 2008 caused a sudden loss in habitat availability and biodiversity in
   agricultural landscapes. Management of set-aside has many facets and in
   this perspective paper we focus on the biodiversity effects of
   successional age, sowing strategies and landscape context. Young,
   1-2-year-old set-asides have been initially considered to be too
   ephemeral to have any conservation value. However, when a rich seed and
   bud bank is available, a species-rich natural (secondary) succession can
   be observed. Arable (annual) weed communities in the first two years of
   succession can even include endangered plant species with associated
   rare insect consumers. Furthermore, many bird species benefit from
   early-successional habitats, whereas small mammal communities are richer
   in older habitats. If the local plant species pool is poor, sowings of
   diverse mixtures from regional seed collections can be recommended.
   Set-aside managers using species-rich sowings often experience that
   dominant weeds suppress the less competitive annual species. This trend
   to species-poor communities can be avoided by intraspecific aggregation
   of competitively weak species. Broadening the spatial scale from the
   plot to the landscape, efficiency of set-aside is highest in simple
   landscapes, where set-aside exhibits greatest effect in enhancement of
   biodiversity and associated services such as pollination and biological
   control. In complex landscapes, however, additional set-aside does not
   add much to the high level of biodiversity and ecological processes
   already present. Twenty percent of semi-natural, non-crop habitat
   appears to be a rough threshold for enhancing biodiversity and
   sustaining services such as pollination and biological control, but
   improved set-aside management should have the potential to reduce the
   percentage of semi-natural non-crop habitat needed. EU policy should
   tailor set-aside schemes for the maintenance of biodiversity and also
   consider that management efficiency is higher in simple than complex
   landscapes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Male wild bees visit flowers to feed and, despite their lack of
   specialised organs for carrying pollen, simultaneously pollinate them.
   We analysed the pollinating efficiency of the males of two bee species
   for blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.): red mason bee (Osmia rufa L.) and
   bufftailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris terrestris L.). Both bee species
   are commercial pollinators and many males are produced during their
   rearing. Gauze sleeves were used to isolate the inflorescences and to
   keep the males inside (one per sleeve). In each experimental group,
   there were six shoots with four neighbouring inflorescences (n = 24).
   The sleeves were also used to prevent other bees from reaching the
   flowers, and to allow self-pollination. Non-isolated flowers were
   pollinated by free-range bees. The effect of male bee pollination was
   similar to that of free-range bee pollination. The percentages of
   flowers that developed into fruit were as follows: male bufftailed
   bumblebee pollination, 79.5\%; free-range bee pollination, 71.1\%; male
   red mason bee pollination, 65.1\%; and self-pollination, 46.4\%; while
   the mean numbers of fruit per raceme were 5.0, 4.4, 3.6, and 2.4,
   respectively. The number of non-pollinated flowers per raceme (ranging
   from 1.3 - 2.8) exhibited an inverse relationship to these numbers of
   fruit. Our observations showed that male wild bees can pollinate
   blackcurrant flowers successfully, and could potentially be useful in
   other crops.}},

   determined whether strong gene-flow barriers result from assortative
   mating arising from different pollinators, a high prevalence of selfing,

   to contribute significantly to seed set, plants with different tube

   that the contact zone is unstable because these ecotypes have not

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Bombus terrestris L. bumblebees are widely used as
   commercial pollinators, but they might also be of help in the battle
   against economically important crop diseases. This alternative control
   strategy is referred to as pollinator-and-vector technology. The present
   study was designed to investigate the capacity of B. terrestris to
   fulfil this role in greenhouse strawberry flowers, which were manually
   inoculated with a major plant pathogen, the grey mould Botrytis cinerea
   Pers.: Fr. A model microbiological control agent (MCA) product
   Prestop-Mix was loaded in a newly developed two-way bumblebee dispenser,
   and, in addition, the use of the diluent Maizena-Plus (corn starch) was
   tested.
   RESULTS: Importantly, loading of the MCA caused no adverse effects on
   bumblebee workers, with no loss of survival or impairment of flight
   activity of the workers during the 4 week flowering period. Secondly,
   vectoring of Prestop-Mix by bumblebees resulted in a higher crop
   production, as 71\% of the flowers developed into healthy red
   strawberries at picking (preharvest yield) as compared with 54\% in the
   controls. In addition, these strawberries were better protected, as 79\%
   of the picked berries remained free of B. cinerea after a 2 day
   incubation (post-harvest yield), while this percentage was only 43\% in
   the control. Overall, the total yield (preharvest x post-harvest) was
   2-2.5 times higher than the total yield in the controls (24\%) in plants
   exposed to bumblebees vectoring Prestop-Mix. Thirdly, the addition of
   the diluent Maizena-Plus to Prestop-Mix at 1 : 1 (w/w) resulted in a
   similar yield to that of Prestop-Mix used alone, and in no negative
   effects on the bumblebees, flowers and berries.
   CONCLUSIONS: This greenhouse study provides strong evidence that B.
   terrestris bumblebees can vector a MCA to reduce B. cinerea incidence in
   greenhouse strawberries, resulting in higher yields. Similar yields
   obtained in the treatments with Prestop-Mix and Prestop-Mix +
   Maizena-Plus suggest an equally efficient dissemination of the
   biocontrol agent into the flowers with only half the initial
   concentration of Prestop-Mix, which illustrates the importance of the
   diluent. (c) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{The rate of pollen exchange within and among flowers may depend on
   pollinator attraction traits such as floral display size and flowering
   plant density. Variations in these traits may influence pollinator
   movements, pollen receipt, and seed number. To assess how floral display
   size and flowering plant density affect parameters of pollinator
   visitation rate, pollen receipt per flower, seed number per fruit and
   the between-plant pollinator movements, we studied the self-incompatible
   plant, Nierembergia linariifolia. Per-flower pollinator visitation rate
   and bout length increased linearly with increasing floral display size.
   Pollen receipt per flower increased linearly with increasing flowering
   plant density. For seed number per fruit, a polynomial model describing
   an increased seed number per fruit at low density and a decreased seed
   number per fruit at high density provided a significant fit. Per-flower
   pollinator visitation rate was not associated with pollen receipt per
   flower and seed number per fruit. Bees visited plants located near to
   the center of the population more frequently than plants located at the
   periphery. Increases in both floral display size and flowering plant
   density led to an increased chance of a plant being chosen as the center
   of the pollinator foraging area. These results suggest that even though
   large floral displays and high flowering plant density are traits that
   attract more pollinators, they may also reduce potential mate diversity
   by restricting pollen movement to conspecific mates that are closely
   located.}},

Abstract = {{Although induced plant responses to herbivory are well studied as
   mechanisms of resistance, how induction shapes community interactions
   and ultimately plant fitness is still relatively unknown. Using a wild
   tomato, Solanum peruvianum, native to the Peruvian Andes, we evaluated
   the disruption of pollination as a potential ecological cost of induced
   responses. More specifically, we tested the hypothesis that metabolic
   changes in herbivore-attacked plants, such as the herbivore-induced
   emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), alter pollinator behavior
   and consequentially affect plant fitness. We conducted a series of
   manipulative field experiments to evaluate the role of herbivore-induced
   vegetative and floral VOC emissions as mechanisms by which herbivory
   affects pollinator behavior. In field surveys and bioassays in the
   plants' native habitat, we found that real and simulated herbivory
   (methyl jasmonate application) reduced attractiveness of S. peruvianum
   flowers to their native pollinators. We show that reduced pollinator
   preference, not resource limitation due to leaf tissue removal, resulted
   in reduced seed set. Solitary bee pollinators use floral plant
   volatiles, emitted in response to herbivory or methyl jasmonate
   treatment, as cues to avoid inflorescences on damaged plants. This
   herbivory-induced pollinator limitation can be viewed as a general cost
   of induced plant responses as well as a specific cost of
   herbivory-induced volatile emission.}},

Abstract = {{Females of communal and eusocial Hymenoptera differ greatly in the
   treatment of conspecifics: communal species lack the nest
   membership-bias treatment via nestmate (NM) recognition, which is
   typical of eusocial Hymenoptera. Therefore, an analysis of social
   interactions can suggest whether a given bee or wasp is communal or
   eusocial. For this reason, we observed females of the digger wasp
   Cerceris rubida in experimental dyadic encounters. Because this species
   had previously been labeled ``communal,{''} we expected to find little
   evidence of a NM bias with respect to cooperation or aggression when
   paired with NMs and non-nestmates (NNM). Contrary to expectation,
   females were highly cooperative toward NMs and highly aggressive toward
   NNMs. Variation in the intensity of aggression toward NNMs partially
   stems from the degree to which the paired females differed in size. From
   these results and quantitative comparisons with studies on solitary,
   communal, and eusocial bee species, it appears that C. rubida has a more
   complex social organization than previously believed and, in particular,
   that females of this species exhibit NM recognition, a trait associated

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{167}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-116}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators, even floral generalists (=polyleges), typically specialize
   during individual foraging bouts, infrequently switching between floral
   hosts. Such transient floral constancy restricts pollen flow, and
   thereby gene flow, to conspecific flowers in mixed plant communities.
   Where incipient flowering species meet, however, weak cross-fertility
   and often similar floral traits can yield mixed reproductive outcomes
   among pollinator-dependent species. In these cases, floral constancy by
   polyleges sometimes serves as an ethological mating barrier. More often,
   their foraging infidelities instead facilitate host introgression and
   hybridization. Many other bee species are oligolectic (taxonomic
   specialists for pollen). Oligoleges could be more discriminating
   connoisseurs than polyleges when foraging among their limited set of
   related floral hosts. If true, greater foraging constancy might ensue,
   contributing to positive assortative mating and disruptive selection,
   thereby facilitating speciation among their interfertile floral hosts.
   To test this Connoisseur Hypothesis, nesting females of two species of
   oligolectic Osmia bees were presented with randomized mixed arrays of
   flowers of two sympatric species of their pollen host, Balsamorhiza, a
   genus known for hybridization. In a closely spaced grid, the females of
   both species preferred the larger flowered B. macrophylla, evidence for
   discrimination. However, both species' females showed no floral
   constancy whatsoever during their individual foraging bouts, switching
   randomly between species proportional to their floral preference. In a
   wider spaced array in which the bouquets reflected natural plant
   spacing, foraging oligolectic bees often transferred pollen surrogates
   (fluorescent powders) both between conspecific flowers (geitonogamy and
   xenogamy) and between the two Balsamorhiza species. The Connoisseur
   Hypothesis was therefore rejected. Foraging infidelity by these
   oligolectic Osmia bees will contribute to introgression and
   hybridization where interfertile species of Balsamorhiza meet and flower
   together. A literature review reveals that other plant genera whose
   species hybridize also attract numerous oligolectic bees, providing
   independent opportunities to test the generality of this conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic polymorphisms for floral color are interesting phenomena to
   study because they are likely to be maintained by opposing selective

   color; however, floral color might also be the indirect target of
   selection through genetic associations with other traits under
   selection. Malva moschata (Malvaceae) is a North American species that

   reflectance spectrophotometry data that characterize the nature of
   floral color variation in this species and show that honey bees and
   bumble bees should be able to distinguish between the morphs through
   differential sensitivity at the green (long-wavelength) photoreceptor.
   Second, we use a series of phenotypic measures to investigate whether
   the color morphs differ with respect to other floral traits, vegetative
   traits or female reproductive success, and use a series of correlation
   analyses to infer the relative independence of color from these other
   traits. We found that red-flowered morphs produced more anthers per
   flower and had greater leaf area, and that white-flowered morphs had
   greater percentage fruit set; however, there were no reproductive
   success differences between the morphs. The relationship between flower
   size and anther number was the only correlation that differed between
   the morphs. Finally, a series of pollinator-choice experiments showed
   that bumble bees strongly prefer red morphs in terms of visit frequency

   (EF-1 alpha) to compare the tree topologies that result when using
   outgroup versus paralogous rooting. Fifty-two taxa representing each of
   the seven bee families were sequenced for both copies of EF-1 alpha. Two
   datasets were analyzed. In the first (the ``concatenated{''} dataset),
   the F1 and F2 copies for each species were concatenated and the tree was
   rooted using appropriate outgroups (sphecid and crabronid wasps). In the
   second dataset (the ``duplicated{''} dataset), the F1 and F2 copies were
   aligned to each another and each copy for all taxa were treated as
   separate terminals. In this dataset, the root was placed between the F1

   that the outgroup rooting approach outperforms paralog rooting,
   recovering deeper clades and showing stronger support for groups well
   established by both morphological and other molecular data. Sequence
   characteristics of the two copies were compared at the amino acid level,
   but little evidence was found to suggest that one copy is more
   functionally conserved. Although neither approach yields an unambiguous
   root to the tree, both approaches strongly indicate that the root of bee
   phylogeny does not fall near Colletidae, as has been previously
   proposed. We discuss paralog rooting as a general strategy and why this
   approach performs relatively poorly with our particular dataset.

   Gradient}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The potential for reduced pollination ecosystem service due
   to global declines of bees and other pollinators is cause for
   considerable concern. Habitat degradation, destruction and fragmentation
   due to agricultural intensification have historically been the main
   causes of this pollinator decline. However, despite increasing and
   accelerating levels of global urbanization, very little research has
   investigated the effects of urbanization on pollinator assemblages. We
   assessed changes in the diversity, abundance and species composition of
   bee and hoverfly pollinator assemblages in urban, suburban, and rural
   sites across a UK city.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Bees and hoverflies were trapped and
   netted at 24 sites of similar habitat character (churchyards and
   cemeteries) that varied in position along a gradient of urbanization.
   Local habitat quality (altitude, shelter from wind, diversity and
   abundance of flowers), and the broader-scale degree of urbanization (e.
   g. percentage of built landscape and gardens within 100 m, 250 m, 500 m,
   1 km, and 2.5 km of the site) were assessed for each study site. The
   diversity and abundance of pollinators were both significantly
   negatively associated with higher levels of urbanization. Assemblage
   composition changed along the urbanization gradient with some species
   positively associated with urban and suburban land-use, but more species
   negatively so. Pollinator assemblages were positively affected by good
   site habitat quality, in particular the availability of flowering
   plants.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that urban areas can support
   diverse pollinator assemblages, but that this capacity is strongly
   affected by local habitat quality. Nonetheless, in both urban and
   suburban areas of the city the assemblages had fewer individuals and
   lower diversity than similar rural habitats. The unique development
   histories of different urban areas, and the difficulty of assessing
   mobile pollinator assemblages in just part of their range, mean that
   complementary studies in different cities and urban habitats are
   required to discover if these findings are more widely applicable.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of species is striking, but can be far exceeded by the
   chemical diversity of compounds collected, produced or used by them.
   Here, we relate the specificity of plant-consumer interactions to
   chemical diversity applying a comparative network analysis to both
   levels. Chemical diversity was explored for interactions between
   tropical stingless bees and plant resins, which bees collect for nest
   construction and to deter predators and microbes. Resins also function
   as an environmental source for terpenes that serve as appeasement
   allomones and protection against predators when accumulated on the bees'
   body surfaces. To unravel the origin of the bees' complex chemical
   profiles, we investigated resin collection and the processing of
   resin-derived terpenes. We therefore analyzed chemical networks of tree
   resins, foraging networks of resin collecting bees, and their acquired
   chemical networks. We revealed that 113 terpenes in nests of six bee
   species and 83 on their body surfaces comprised a subset of the 1,117
   compounds found in resins from seven tree species. Sesquiterpenes were
   the most variable class of terpenes. Albeit widely present in tree
   resins, they were only found on the body surface of some species, but
   entirely lacking in others. Moreover, whereas the nest profile of
   Tetragonula melanocephala contained sesquiterpenes, its surface profile
   did not. Stingless bees showed a generalized collecting behavior among
   resin sources, and only a hitherto undescribed species-specific
   ``filtering{''} of resin-derived terpenes can explain the variation in
   chemical profiles of nests and body surfaces from different species. The
   tight relationship between bees and tree resins of a large variety of

   following hypothesis was tested: the greater the isolation degree of a
   plant, the lower its fruit production due to access difficulties for
   pollinators. Using a linear regression analysis, it was possible to
   relate the fruiting rate with the degree of isolation of each B.
   coccolobifolia individual and consequently it was found that the
   isolation had no influence on the pollination rate, an unexpected event
   that can be explained by the distance amongst individuals not being
   large enough to limit the movement of pollinators, or because
   cross-pollination was not the predominant form of reproduction, since
   the rate of cross-pollination was similar to self-pollination. It was
   also found that the proportion of fruits produced was lower than
   expected, a factor which may also have influenced the results.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding pathogen transmission could illuminate new methods for
   disease prevention. A case in point is chalkbrood in the alfalfa
   leafcutting bee {[}Megachile rotundata (F.)]. Propagation of this
   solitary bee is severely hampered by chalkbrood, a larval disease caused
   by Ascosphaera aggregata (Ascomycota). Alfalfa leafcutting bees nest in
   existing cavities in wood or hollow reeds and overwinter as larvae. In
   the early summer, emerging adults frequently must chew through dead,
   diseased siblings that block their exit, becoming contaminated with
   chalkbrood spores in the process. When alfalfa leafcutting bees are used
   as a commercial pollinator, the cocoons are removed from nesting boards
   to reduce chalkbrood transmission, but the disease is still common. To
   determine if these removed cocoons (called loose cells) are an important
   source of disease transmission, they were disinfected with a fungicide
   before bees were incubated, and released in the field. Chalkbrood
   prevalence among the progeny of the treated bees was reduced up to 50\%
   in one field trial, but not significantly when tested in an on-farm
   trial. Thus, substantial disease transmission still occurred when the
   loose cells were disinfected, and even when clean nesting materials were
   used. In conclusion, pathogen transmission must still be occurring from
   another source that has yet to be identified. Another possible source of
   transmission could arise from bees that emerge midsummer in populations
   with a high percent of multivoltinism, but dirty nesting boards and
   feral bees also may be minor sources of transmission.}},

   temperature treatments than applied in previous studies (19 versus eight
   or fewer) and analytical tools formulated to model nonlinear
   relationships between temperature and insect development rates. We also
   tested the hypothesis that rearing temperature influences adult body
   lipid content at emergence, which could affect adult survival,
   establishment and performance as a pollinator, and reproductive success.
   We found that the Lactin-2 and Briere-2 models provided the best fits to

   (36-39 degrees C) developmental thresholds and optimum (33-34 degrees C)
   rearing temperatures for maximizing development rate. Bees successfully
   emerged over a broad range of temperatures (22-35 degrees C), but
   variation in development rate among individuals reared at the same

   temperature to maximize the proportion of body lipids in adults was
   27-29 degrees C. Our results are discussed in relation to previous

Abstract = {{The geographical dichotomy hypothesis suggests that columnar cacti in
   the tropics depend primarily on bats for pollination. This dependence
   may to be less in the outer tropics where many columnar cactus species
   (or their populations) show a relatively generalized pollination system
   with both nocturnal (moths and bats) and diurnal pollinators (bees and
   hummingbirds) (geographical dichotomy hypothesis). This hypothesis has
   been mostly tested in the northern tropics; nonetheless, our knowledge
   of columnar cactus species inhabiting the southern tropics is still
   scarce. The aim of this project was to evaluate the pollination biology
   of Oreocereus celsianus, a columnar cactus with restricted distribution
   in the subtropical Andes, to determine if the pollination system of this
   cactus tends to be more generalized than specialized because of the
   geographical position where it occurs. Observations of frequency of
   visit showed that Patagona gigas (Giant Hummingbird) is the main
   pollinator of the flowers, visiting them when they are opening
   (afternoon of the first day). Bees, wasps and moths were occasional
   visitors of the flowers. None of them seem to act as pollinator.
   Autogamy, geitonogamy and xenogamy treatments produced high fruit set,
   showing that O. celsianus has an unusual mixed mating system. The
   results suggest that this Andean columnar cactus is partially
   specialized on hummingbirds, with most pollination service performed by
   a single species, and it has the capacity of selfing ('fail-safe'
   pollination system). This mixed mating system (both outcrossing and
   selfing) may be a response to the unpredictable environment of the
   Prepuna in the subtropical Andes.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of predators, pollinators can often maximize their
   foraging success by visiting the most rewarding flowers. However, if
   predators use those highly rewarding flowers to locate their prey,
   pollinators may benefit from changing their foraging preferences to
   accept less rewarding flowers. Previous studies have shown that some
   predators, such as crab spiders, indeed hunt preferentially on the most
   pollinator-attractive flowers. In order to determine whether predation
   risk can alter pollinator preferences, we conducted laboratory
   experiments on the foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)
   when predation risk was associated with a particular reward level
   (measured here as sugar concentration). Bees foraged in arenas
   containing a choice of a high-reward and a low-reward artificial flower.
   On a bee's first foraging trip, it was either lightly squeezed with
   forceps, to simulate a crab spider attack, or was allowed to forage
   safely. The foragers' subsequent visits were recorded for between 1 and
   4 h without any further simulated attacks. Compared to bees that foraged
   safely, bees that experienced a simulated attack on a low-reward
   artificial flower had reduced foraging activity. However, bees attacked
   on a high-reward artificial flower were more likely to visit low-reward
   artificial flowers on subsequent foraging trips. Forager body size,
   which is thought to affect vulnerability to capture by predators, did
   not have an effect on response to an attack. Predation risk can thus
   alter pollinator foraging behavior in ways that influence the number and
   reward level of flowers that are visited.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1327-1337}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Plants often combine multiple strategies to achieve pollen transfer. The
   dioecious Clusia nemorosa (Clusiaceae) produces floral resin, a
   specialized reward for resin-collecting bees. It also exhibits floral
   automimicry with female flowers mimicking male flowers in order to
   attract pollen-collecting insects. We observed the hourly visitation
   frequency and behaviour of bee visitors on two rock savanna sites in
   French Guiana. The major strategy in pollen transfer and the variation
   in visitation rates among visitor species were examined. We hypothesized
   that the visitation rate will vary between the floral sexes and degree
   of this variation will differ between the two-reward systems. We found
   no evidence for visits being exclusively related to resin collection,
   which we expected to be the principal strategy in pollen transfer.
   Deceit pollination appeared to have minor importance and seemed to be
   locally associated with the site, where demand for pollen was greater.
   Flower visits that probably facilitated most pollen transfer, combined
   resin and pollen. The pollinators involved in this system collected
   pollen from male flowers and resin from female flowers. The fruit set
   was not particularly low (44.19\%) so offering different rewards by
   different flower genders has not constrained reproductive success in
   this system. Pronounced variation in visitation rates between sexes was
   not related to the pollination mechanisms but to the demand for the two
   rewards. Overall demand for pollen was greater than demand for resin.
   Female flowers were visited much less frequently than male flowers. Peak
   pollen collection occurred in the morning, i.e., as soon as the resource
   was available, while resin was collected throughout the day. There was a
   local variability in demand for the two resources because both the
   visitation rate and the behaviour of foraging bees varied between the
   two observation sites.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are known to collect pollen and nectar to provide their larvae and
   themselves with food. That bees, especially the tropical stingless bees
   (Apidae: Meliponini), also collect plant resins has, however, been
   barely addressed in scientific studies on resource use in bees. Resins
   are used for nest construction, nest maintenance and nest defence.
   Furthermore, some South-East Asian species transfer resin-derived
   terpenes to their cuticular profiles. The resin requirement of bees is
   in turn used by certain plant species, which attract bees either for
   pollination by providing resin in their inflorescences, or for seed
   dispersal by providing resin in their seed capsules (mellitochory).
   Mellitochory is found in the eucalypt tree Corymbia torelliana, the
   resin of which is collected by Australian stingless bees. We
   investigated how the interaction between C. torelliana and
   resin-collecting bees affects the chemical ecology of two Australian
   stingless bee genera by comparing the chemical profiles of eight bee
   species with resin from C. torelliana fruits. The two bee genera
   differed significantly in their chemical profiles. Similar to South-East
   Asian stingless bees, 51\% of all compounds on the body surfaces of the
   five Tetragonula species were most likely derived from plant resins. Up
   to 32 compounds were identical with compounds from C. torelliana resin,
   suggesting that Tetragonula species include C. torelliana compounds in
   their chemical profiles. By contrast, few or none resinous compounds
   were found on the body surfaces of the three Austroplebeia species
   sampled. However, one prominent but as yet unknown substance was found
   in both C. torelliana resin and the chemical profiles of all Tetragonula
   and four Austroplebeia colonies sampled, suggesting that most colonies
   (76\%) gathered resin from C. torelliana. Hence, C. torelliana resin may
   be commonly collected by Australian stingless bees and, along with
   resins from other plant species, shape their chemical ecology.}},

Abstract = {{One possible effect of climate change is the generation of a mismatch in
   the seasonal timing of interacting organisms, owing to species-specific
   shifts in phenology. Despite concerns that plants and pollinators might
   be at risk of such decoupling, there have been few attempts to test this
   hypothesis using detailed phenological data on insect emergence and
   flowering at the same localities. In particular, there are few data sets
   on pollinator flight seasons that are independent of flowering
   phenology, because pollinators are typically collected at flowers. To
   address this problem, we established standardized nesting habitat (trap
   nests) for solitary bees and wasps at sites along an elevational
   gradient in the Rocky Mountains, and monitored emergence during three
   growing seasons. We also recorded air temperatures and flowering
   phenology at each site. Using a reciprocal transplant experiment with
   nesting bees, we confirmed that local environmental conditions are the
   primary determinants of emergence phenology. We were then able to
   develop phenology models to describe timing of pollinator emergence or
   flowering, across all sites and years, as a function of accumulated
   degree-days. Although phenology of both plants and insects is well
   described by thermal models, the best models for insects suggest
   generally higher threshold temperatures for development or diapause
   termination than those required for plants. In addition, degree-day
   requirements for most species, both plants and insects, were lower in
   locations with longer winters, indicating either a chilling or
   vernalization requirement that is more completely fulfilled at colder
   sites, or a critical photoperiod before which degree-day accumulation
   does not contribute to development. Overall, these results suggest that
   phenology of plants and trap-nesting bees and wasps is regulated in
   similar ways by temperature, but that plants are more likely than
   insects to advance phenology in response to springtime warming. We
   discuss the implications of these results for plants and pollinators,
   and suggest that phenological decoupling alone is unlikely to threaten
   population persistence for most species in our study area.}},

   2. Bumble bee abundance increased during summer as spring queens founded

   4. Despite species differences in emergence times of spring queens,

   abundances of workers and males are also shifted later; therefore
   elevational comparisons must be seasonally adjusted.

   genetic conservation programs. The objective of this work is to estimate
   the outcrossing rate in nabicol under controlled pollinator conditions
   using SSRs. Pairs of flowering plants taken from nabicol landrace
   MBG-BRS0039 were placed in separated isolation cages and bumble bees
   (Bombus sp.) were released for facilitating the crosses between plants.
   A seed sample from each plant in the cross was analyzed by SSRs that
   were polymorphic in the parental population. We found that the crop is
   partially allogamous and that there is genetic variation for the
   outcrossing rate among individuals. Several consequences for the
   maintenance and genetic improvement of the crop are discussed. The
   existence of genetic variability for this trait is a valuable tool that
   will allow us to study the genetic mechanisms underlying the mating
   system of this crop.}},

Abstract = {{The adventitious presence of transgene containing seed in conventional
   crops is an issue of considerable interest; a model to predict levels
   will aid regulators and help to address concerns of farmers and
   consumers. While outcrossing levels have been described in crops such as
   rape that are wind-pollinated, or both wind- and insect-pollinated, much
   less is known about pollen dispersal in exclusively insect-pollinated
   crops. In this paper, we develop a mechanistic model for pollen movement
   that is based on a description of bee movement through space. Our model
   is a system of diffusion-based partial differential equations that we
   use to predict percent transgenic seed at arbitrary distances from a
   transgenic source under different planting scenarios. We present a
   two-pronged study, in which the mathematical modelling work is informed
   by experimental work. The latter was carried out in an apple orchard
   with a row of 200 transgenic source trees carrying the GUS marker gene.
   Fruit from neighbouring conventional trees was gathered at distances
   ranging from 3.5 m to 183 m, and the seeds were extracted and
   germinated. Percent transgenic seed at each location was determined by
   testing the seedlings for the presence of the GUS marker gene. We use
   the experimental data to validate and parameterize the model, and then
   run model simulations to determine expected percent transgenic seed in
   various linear landscapes. We find that the percent transgenic seed in
   neighbouring conventional trees and orchards is a function of the size
   of each orchard block and the distance between them. The model
   explicitly shows the effect of overlapping transgenic and nontransgenic
   pollen distributions in setting seed distributions, and also shows the
   value of buffer rows in reducing outcrossing levels in neighbouring
   crops. The model parameters can be adjusted to suit particular crops and
   locations, and may be useful for determining plausible distributions on
   transgenic seed plantings needed to allow for an adventitious presence
   of, for example, 0.9\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial diseases are important selective agents in social insects and
   one major defense mechanism is the secretion of cuticular antimicrobial
   compounds. We hypothesized that given differences in group size, social

   secretions from nine wasp species of varying social complexity and

   cultures of Staphylococcus aureus. These data were then combined with
   phylogenetic data to provide an evolutionary context. Social species
   showed significantly higher (18x) antimicrobial activity than solitary
   species and species with paper nests showed significantly higher (11x)
   antimicrobial activity than those which excavated burrows. Mud-nest
   species showed no antimicrobial activity. Solitary, burrow-provisioning
   wasps diverged at more basal nodes of the phylogenetic trees, while
   social wasps diverged from the most recent nodes. These data suggest
   that antimicrobial defences may have evolved in response to

Abstract = {{Tecoma sums (L.) Juss. ex Kunth (Bignoniaceae) is a ubiquitous showy
   plant species that occurs naturally throughout much of the tropics and
   is commonly used as an ornamental in urban landscapes. The natural
   distribution and abundance of this floral resource in northwestern Costa
   Rica presents the opportunity for a comparative study of urban bees
   across repeated samples and in multiple cities, filling an important
   data gap in urban bee ecology. Community composition and daily foraging
   patterns of bees visiting flowering urban T stalls resources were
   outlined and compared over a 21-month period from July 2007 to March
   2009. A total of 27 species were identified as foragers, accounting for
   over 10\% of the known diversity from nearby wildlands. These bees were
   in the families Apidae and Halictidae and represented diverse feeding
   and nesting habits, as well as social and solitary life histories.
   Centris eurypatana Snelling, Ancyloscelis sp. 1, and Nannotriogna
   perilampoides (Cresson) were the dominant species collected and
   accounted for nearly 75\% of all records. Clear daily phenology was
   evident, with peak visitation occurring before 1300h. Common visitors
   can be sorted into early morning or full day foragers represented by
   Xylocopa and Halictus species, respectively. Community similarity and
   relative taxon dominance in each city appears to be related to the
   surrounding pen-urban landscapes, however further study is needed to
   verify this trend. The potential of T. stans to serve as an in-situ
   monitoring resource for urban bee communities is discussed as the

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{Although sagebrush, Artemisia spp., does not require an insect
   pollinator, there are several native species of bumble bees, Bombus spp.
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae), that are present in sagebrush steppe ecosystems
   where they act as pollinators for various forbs and shrubs. These native
   pollinators contribute to plant productivity and reproduction. We
   captured 12 species of bumble bees (437 individuals) at two sites during
   this study. The three most commonly captured species of Bombus at the
   first site (Red Mountain in the Targhee-Caribou National Forest) were B.
   rufocinctus Cresson, B. fervidus and B. melanopygus Nylander. Bombus
   fervidus dominated the trap catch at the second site (Lave Lake Land and
   Livestock) followed by B. rufocinctus and B. californicus consanguineus
   Smith. When numerous species of bumble bees co-occur on a given site,
   the community must have some mechanism for partitioning the available
   resources for the coexistence to occur. Along with temporal separation
   that was demonstrated by monthly differences in the capture of several
   of the individual species of bumble bees at both study sites,
   differences in capture or individual species of bumble bees was
   influenced by trap color. The differences observed among the species of
   Bombus we captured at the two sites may serve to limit competitive
   interactions among some of the species. Further, more bumble bees were
   captured in traps placed in the plots with the lowest percentage of
   sagebrush in the canopy. The results suggest that sagebrush steppe
   habitats can harbor a diverse community of native bumble bees and that
   multiple Bombus species can coexist on these sites. To maintain these
   diverse bumble bee communities, some portion of the sites should be
   managed to have little to no sagebrush in the canopy.}},

Abstract = {{According to the concept of pollination syndromes, floral traits reflect

   However, the reproductive biology of endemic, and often specialised,
   plants may require increased attention as climate change accelerates
   worldwide. Species of Roscoea endemic to the Himalayan region have
   striking orchid-like flowers with long corolla tubes, suggesting
   pollination by long-tongued insects. Until now, the reproductive biology
   of species of Roscoea has been poorly documented. We investigated the
   floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of R.
   cautleoides and R. humeana, from Hengduan Mountains, a global
   biodiversity hotspot in southwest China. We also tested whether floral
   longevity increases pollination success. Pollination experiments showed
   that the two species were self-compatible and depended on insects for
   fruit production. Over several flowering seasons we did not observe any
   potential pollinators with long tongues that matched the corolla tube
   visiting flowers in centres of distribution. The principal pollinators
   observed were pollen-collecting generalist bees, with low visitation
   frequencies. In general, members of the ginger family are characterised
   by short-lived (usually 1 day) flowers, but flowers of R. cautleoides
   and R. humeana last 8 and 6 days, respectively. Removing stigmas
   decreased fruit set in both study populations. Our results suggest that
   the original pollinators may have been long-tongued insects that are now
   absent from the Chinese Himalayas because habitats have responded to
   climate change. However, long-lived and self-compatible flowers, coupled
   with the presence of generalist pollinators, are traits that have
   allowed these gingers to reproduce and continue to persist in the alpine

Abstract = {{Pollinator guild organization and its consequences for reproduction in

   co-flowering plant species, pollinator sharing can result in
   interspecific pollen transfer and fecundity reduction. Competition will

   if each plant species occupies different habitat patches. Reproduction
   in Tibouchina cerastifolia (Naudin) Cogn., T clinopodifolia (DC.) Cogn.
   and T gracilis (Bonpl.) Cogn. was studied in an area of Atlantic
   rainforest to examine whether synchronopatry induces time partitioning
   among pollinator species. Eleven bee species comprised the pollinator
   guild. Among pollinators, there were overlaps in bee species composition
   and in flower visitation time. Direct competition for pollen in
   Tibouchina Aubl. at the study site seems to lead to different activity
   periods among the bee species, in which Bombus pauloensis Friese,1913
   was most active earlier, while the other species were active later in
   the day. Bombus pauloensis, the largest bee species recorded on
   Tibouchina flowers, was the most important and efficient pollinator.
   This species harvested pollen before the other species and had the
   shortest handling time. The plants reproduced sexually by selfing or
   outcrossing, and hybridization was not avoided by incompatibility
   reactions at the style. The avoidance of direct competition for pollen

Abstract = {{Ants had been absent from the Hawaiian Islands before their human
   introduction. Today they cause severe alterations of ecosystems and
   displace native biota. Due to their strong demand on carbohydrate-rich
   resources, they often exploit floral nectar of native Hawaiian plant
   species with largely unknown consequences for the plants' reproduction.
   We examined effects of flower-visiting invasive ants on reproduction of
   the endemic shrub Vaccinium reticulatum (Ericaceae) in Hawai'i Volcanoes
   National Park. Ant densities in flowers were high and floral nectar was
   excessively exploited, which may lead to a reduced visitation rate of
   pollinators. However, the ants' presence on flowers strongly reduced
   flower parasitism by caterpillars of the introduced plume moth
   Stenoptilodes littoralis and thus decreased the loss of flowers and
   buds. This is, to our knowledge, the first documented mutualism between
   invasive ants and an endemic plant species in Hawai'i. Developed fruits
   of this partly self-incompatible plant, however, bore relatively low

Abstract = {{Onion thrips, previously considered of minor importance to hybrid onion

   especially in Colusa County. We examined a number of possible
   contributing factors and found a strong positive correlation between
   honey bee activity and onion seed set, indicating that a lack of
   pollination may be contributing to the reduced yields. In addition,
   honey bee visits to onion flowers were negatively correlated with the
   number of insecticides applied per field and field size. Reduced onion
   seed yields in recent years could be associated with the increase in

Abstract = {{The global decline of insect pollinators, especially bees, is cause for
   concern, and there is an urgent need for cost-effective conservation
   measures in agricultural landscapes. While landscape context and habitat
   quality are known to influence species richness and abundance of bees,
   there is a lack of evidence from manipulative field experiments on bees'
   responses to adaptive management across differently structured
   landscapes. We present the results of a large-scale study that
   investigated the effects of a targeted agri-environment scheme (AES) on
   bumble bees (Bombus spp.) over three years in the United Kingdom. Forage
   patches of different sizes were sown with a conservation flower mixture
   across eight sites covering a broad range of agricultural land use
   types. Species richness and worker densities (especially of the
   longer-tongued Bombus species for which the mixture was targeted) were
   significantly higher on sown forage patches than on existing non-crop
   control habitats throughout the three-year study, but the strength of
   this response depended on both the proportions of arable land and
   abundance of herbaceous forb species in the surrounding landscape. The
   size of sown patches also affected worker density, with smaller patches
   (0.25 ha) attracting higher densities of some species than larger
   patches (1.0 ha). Our models show that a targeted AES can deliver
   greater net benefits in more intensively farmed areas, in terms of the
   number and species richness of bumble bees supported, than in
   heterogeneous landscapes where other foraging habitats exist. These
   findings serve to strengthen the evidence base for extending
   agri-environment schemes to boost declining pollinator populations to a
   larger number of agricultural landscapes across the globe.}},

Abstract = {{A traditional view of diverse floral traits is that they reflect
   differences in foraging preferences of pollinators. The role of
   pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned
   recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning
   variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which
   suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we
   investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of
   29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in
   the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson's
   diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator
   generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator
   groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses
   indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant
   preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively
   stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two
   out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of
   generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape
   preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open
   flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007
   than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results
   suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators
   may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral
   traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community
   structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{It has often been proposed that nectarless deceptive orchid species
   exploit naive pollinators in search of food before they learn to avoid
   their flowers, and that intraspecific floral trait polymorphism, often
   noted in this plant group, could prolong the time needed for learning,
   thus increasing orchid reproductive success. We tested the importance of
   avoidance learning in a European deceptive orchid, Anacamptis morio,
   which has been reported to have a highly variable fragrance bouquet
   among individuals. We used an indirect approach, i.e. we facilitated
   pollinators' ability to learn to avoid A. morio by adding anisaldehyde
   to selected inflorescences, a scent compound that is easily perceived by
   the natural pollinators and produced in large quantities by the closely
   related, nectar producing Anacamptis coriophora, a species that shares
   pollinator species with A. morio. In a series of three experiments ( in
   artificial arrays, in natural populations and in bumblebee behavioural
   observations), we consistently found no difference either of
   reproductive success of or visitation rates to scent-added versus
   control inflorescences. We also found that the decrease of reproductive
   success over time in artificial populations of this deceptive species
   was not as important as expected. Together, these data suggest that
   pollinators do not fully learn to avoid deceptive inflorescences, and
   that pollinator avoidance behaviour alone may explain the lower
   reproductive success usually found in deceptive orchids. We discuss the
   possible explanations for this pattern in deceptive orchids,
   particularly in relation to pollinator cognition and learning abilities.
   Lastly, in light of our results, the potential for higher average
   reproductive success in deceptive orchids with high phenotypic
   variability driven by avoidance learning thus appears to be challenged.}},

Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims In sub-alpine habitats, patchiness in snowpack
   produces marked, small-scale variation in flowering phenology. Plants in
   early-and late-melting patches are therefore likely to experience very
   different conditions during their flowering periods. Mertensia
   fusiformis is an early-flowering perennial that varies conspicuously in
   style length within and among populations. The hypothesis that style
   length represents an adaptation to local flowering time was tested.
   Specifically, it was hypothesized that lower air temperatures and higher
   frost risk would favour short-styled plants (with stigmas more shielded
   by corollas) in early-flowering patches, but that the pollen-collecting
   behaviour of flower visitors in late-flowering patches would favour
   long-styled plants.
   Methods Floral morphology was measured, temperatures were monitored and
   pollinators were observed in several matched pairs of early and late
   populations. To evaluate effects of cold temperatures on plants of
   different style lengths, experimental pollinations were conducted during
   mornings (warm) and evenings (cool), and on flowers that either had or
   had not experienced a prior frost. The effectiveness of different
   pollinators was quantified as seed set following single visits to plants
   with relatively short or long styles.
   Key Results Late-flowering populations experienced warmer temperatures
   than early-flowering populations and a different suite of pollinators.
   Nectar-foraging bumble-bee queens and male solitary bees predominated in
   early populations, whereas pollen-collecting female solitary bees were
   more numerous in later sites. Pollinators differed significantly in
   their abilities to transfer pollen to stigmas at different heights, in
   accordance with our prediction. However, temperature and frost
   sensitivity did not differ between long-and short-styled plants.
   Although plants in late-flowering patches tended to have longer styles
   than those in early patches, this difference was not consistent.
   Conclusions Seasonal change in pollinator-mediated selection on style
   length may help maintain variation in this trait in M. fusiformis, but
   adaptation to local flowering time is not apparent. The prevalence of
   short styles in these populations requires further explanation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plants show patterns of spatial genetic
   differentiation reflecting gene flow mediated by pollen and seed
   dispersal and genotype x environment interactions. If patterns of
   genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then they may be
   useful in predicting the likelihood of inbreeding or outbreeding
   depression but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific
   selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their
   population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in
   pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to
   compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata
   plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A
   hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted
   to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers.
   Methods The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive
   performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by
   transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster
   of adults (30-50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (>5 km distant); and
   (d) open pollination. Sets of 17.9 +/- 3.3 leaves from each of 15
   clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F
   statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure.
   Key Results Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both inbreeding
   and outbreeding depression, with `intermediate' pollen producing
   consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including
   seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant
   genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial
   autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by
   >5 km distance (F(ST) = 0.07 and 0.10).
   Conclusions The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and
   genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G.
   mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly
   related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated
   seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are
   suboptimal.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees have suffered declines as a result of reduction in habitat
   availability associated with agricultural intensification. Although
   several conservation strategies for bumblebees address forage
   availability, other aspects of bumblebee ecology are often ignored.
   Availability of sufficient nest sites is a key requirement of bumblebee
   populations and since nesting habitat is likely to have become reduced
   on intensively farmed land, lower nest site availability may contribute
   to bumblebee declines. The use of artificial domiciles for bumblebees
   has been proposed as a potentially useful tool for conservation and for
   improving pollination services for crops, providing a method of boosting
   nest site availability where it is otherwise limiting. Here, six
   different artificial domiciles for bumblebees are trialled in different
   habitats in southern England and central Scotland. Of these, only one
   domicile design at one particular site achieved reasonable uptake rates,
   whilst all other combinations of domicile and site achieved low success.
   Overall, only 23 of 736 domiciles deployed were occupied by bumblebees
   (3.1\%). Based on current knowledge, attempts to use domiciles for
   conservation or research in the UK are likely to be ineffective.
   Commercially available domiciles for bumblebees performed poorly in

Abstract = {{In contrast to marking of the location of resources or sexual partners
   using single-spot pheromone sources, pheromone paths attached to the

   organisms. However, they do exist in meliponine bees (Apidae, Apinae,

   Neotropical meliponine species, especially in the genus Scaptotrigona
   Moure 1942, deposit pheromone paths on substrates between highly
   profitable resources and their nest. In contrast to past results and
   claims, we find that these pheromone paths are not an indispensable
   condition for successful recruitment but rather a means to increase the
   success of recruiters in persuading their nestmates to forage food at a
   particular location. Our results are relevant to a speciation theory in
   scent path-laying meliponine bees, such as Scaptotrigona. In addition,

Abstract = {{1. Shifts in the spatial and temporal patterns of flowering could affect
   the resources available to pollinators, and such shifts might become
   more common as climate change progresses.
   2. As mid-summer temperatures have warmed, we found that a montane
   meadow ecosystem in the southern Rocky Mountains of the United States
   exhibits a trend toward a bimodal distribution of flower abundance,
   characterized by a mid-season reduction in total flower number, instead
   of a broad, unimodal flowering peak lasting most of the summer season.
   3. We examined the shapes of community-level flowering curves in this
   system and found that the typical unimodal peak results from a pattern
   of complementary peaks in flowering among three distinct meadow types
   (dry, mesic and wet) within the larger ecosystem. However, high
   mid-summer temperatures were associated with divergent shifts in the
   flowering curves of these individual meadow types. Specifically, warmer
   summers appeared to cause increasing bimodality in mesic habitats, and a
   longer interval between early and late flowering peaks in wet and dry
   habitats.
   4. Together, these habitat-specific shifts produced a longer mid-season
   valley in floral abundance across the larger ecosystem in warmer years.
   Because of these warming-induced changes in flowering patterns, and the
   significant increase in summer temperatures in our study area, there has
   been a trend toward non-normality of flowering curves over the period
   1974-2009. This trend reflects increasing bimodality in total
   community-wide flowering.
   5. The resulting longer periods of low flowering abundance in the middle
   of the summer season could negatively affect pollinators that are active
   throughout the season, and shifts in flowering peaks within habitats
   might create mismatches between floral resources and demand by
   pollinators with limited foraging ranges.
   6. Synthesis. Early-season climate conditions are getting warmer and
   drier in the high altitudes of the southern Rocky Mountains. We present
   evidence that this climate change is disrupting flowering phenology
   within and among different moisture habitats in a sub-alpine meadow
   ecosystem, causing a mid-season decline in floral resources that might
   negatively affect mutualists, especially pollinators. Our findings
   suggest that climate change can have complex effects on phenology at
   small spatial scales, depending on patch-level habitat differences.}},

   palustris is typically a plant of land water transitional situations
   that are not seral and, as such, appears to be under-represented in
   descriptions of plant communities.
   4. Stachys palustris is typically found on intermittently flooded and
   poorly drained soils, which are weakly acid or weakly basic and highly
   fertile.
   5. The production of numerous subsurface rhizomes by S. palustris helps
   to maintain shoot population density with little recourse to seedling
   recruitment.
   6. Stachys x ambigua, the hybrid between Stachys palustris and S.
   sylvatica, is most frequent in northern and western Britain.
   7. Stachys palustris is particularly valuable as a nectar source for
   insects, especially bumblebees. It has antispasmodic, antiseptic and
   astringent properties; the name `Woundwort' derives from its traditional
   use in staunching bleeding and healing wounds.}},

Abstract = {{Small population size, genetic diversity, and spatial patterns of
   vegetative spread are important aspects to consider when managing
   populations of rare clonal plant species. We used 5 variable nuclear
   simple sequence repeat nDNA loci to determine the extent of genet
   rhizome spread, examine the possibility of very small population sizes,
   and project how Bombus spp. (bumblebee) foraging may impact selfing
   (through geitonogamy) for a threatened lupine (Lupinus oreganus Heller)
   that sprawls through nonadventitious rhizomes. Genotyping identified 1
   genet (27 x 13 m) that dominated about 30\% of a study site, whereas 15
   genets spread a maximum average distance of about 5.5 m (range 1.6-27.1
   m) and appeared to be well integrated with intervening genets. We found
   unexpectedly high genotype diversity, no evidence of a recent genetic
   bottleneck, and 5 of 6 patches had mean fixation index values that were
   near Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium expectations. If the median maximum
   Bombus foraging distance observed in lupine patches (1.2 m) occurred
   within genotyped populations, a typical foraging flight would have >80\%
   chance of occurring between different genets. Our study demonstrates
   that inferences associated with clonality, small population size, and
   inbreeding depression should be directly evaluated for rare vegetatively
   spreading plants.}},

   floral display, we found that female inflorescences were smaller,

Abstract = {{Globally, bird-pollinated plants can be separated into two groups, one
   consisting of species pollinated by specialist nectarivores, and the
   other of plants pollinated by occasional nectarivores. There are marked
   differences in nectar properties among the two groups, implying that
   there has been pollinator-mediated selection on these traits. This
   raises the possibility that variation in bird assemblages among
   populations of a plant species could lead to the evolution of
   intraspecific variation in floral traits. We examined this hypothesis in
   Kniphofia linearifolia, a common and widespread plant in southern
   Africa. Although bees are common visitors to flowers of this species,
   exclusion of birds from inflorescences led to significant reductions in
   seed set, indicating that the species is primarily bird-pollinated. We
   showed that bird pollinator assemblages differ markedly between five
   different populations of K. linearifolia, and that variation in flower
   morphology and nectar properties between these populations are
   associated with the dominant guild of bird visitors at each population.
   We identified two distinct morphotypes, based on corolla length, nectar
   volume and nectar concentration, which reflect the bird assemblages
   found in each type. Further work is needed to establish if a natural
   geographic mosaic of bird assemblages are the ultimate cause of
   differentiation in floral traits in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Nontarget species such as pollinators may be of great importance to the
   restoration process and the long-term functioning of restored habitats,
   but little is known about how such groups respond to habitat
   restoration. I surveyed bee communities at five equal-aged restored
   sites, paired with five reference sites (riparian remnants) along the
   Sacramento River, California, United States. Flower availability and bee
   visitation patterns were also measured to examine the restoration of
   pollination function. Restoration of structural vegetation allowed
   diverse and abundant native bee communities to establish at the
   restoration sites; however, the composition of these important
   pollinator communities was distinct from that in the remnant riparian
   sites. Differences did not arise primarily from differences in the
   composition of the flowering-plant community; rather there must be other
   physical characteristics of the restored sites or differences in nesting
   site availability that led to the different pollinator communities.
   Because sites were spatially paired, the differences are unlikely to be
   driven by landscape context. Bee life-history and other biological
   traits may partially explain the differences between bee communities at
   restored and remnant sites. Patterns of visitation to native plant
   species suggest that pollination function is restored along with
   pollinator abundance and richness; however, function may be less robust
   in restored habitats. An examination of interaction networks between
   bees and plant species found at both restored and remnant riparian sites
   showed less redundancy of pollinators visiting some plants at restored
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Peponapis bees are considered specialized pollinators of Cucurbita
   flowers, a genus that presents several species of economic value

   characteristics with respect to climatic conditions of their occurrence
   areas (abiotic variables) and interactions between species (biotic
   variables). The similarity of climatic conditions (temperature and
   precipitation) was estimated through cluster analyses. The areas of
   potential occurrence of the most similar species were obtained through
   ecological niche modeling and summed with geographic information system
   tools. Three main clusters were obtained: one with species that shared
   potential occurrence areas mainly in deserts (P. pruinosa, P.

   presented larger geographical areas, such as P. pruinosa and C.
   foetidissima suggesting other drivers than climatic conditions to shape
   their distributions. The domestication of Cucurbita and also the natural

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 13}},
Abstract = {{Flower-visiting animals are constantly under predation risk when
   foraging and hence might be expected to evolve behavioural adaptations
   to avoid predators. We reviewed the available published and unpublished
   data to assess the overall effects of predators on pollinator behaviour
   and to examine sources of variation in these effects. The results of our
   meta-analysis showed that predation risk significantly decreased flower
   visitation rates (by 36\%) and time spent on flowers (by 51\%) by
   pollinators. The strength of the predator effects depended neither on
   predator taxa and foraging mode (sit-and-wait or active hunters) nor on
   pollinator lifestyle (social vs. solitary). However, predator effects
   differed among pollinator taxa: predator presence reduced flower
   visitation rates and time spent on flowers by Squamata, Lepidoptera and
   Hymenoptera, but not by Diptera. Furthermore, larger pollinators showed
   weaker responses to predation risk, probably because they are more
   difficult to capture. Presence of live crab spiders on flowers had
   weaker effects on pollinator behaviour than presence of dead or
   artificial crab spiders or other objects (e.g. dead bees, spheres),
   suggesting that predator crypsis may be effective to some extent. These
   results add to a growing consensus on the importance of considering both

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1323-1334}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Most Neotropical species of Malpighiaceae produce
   floral fatty oils in calyx glands to attract pollinating oil-collecting
   bees, which depend on this resource for reproduction. This specialized
   type of pollination system tends to be lost in members of the family
   that occur outside the geographic distribution (e.g. Africa) of
   Neotropical oil-collecting bees. This study focused on the pollination
   ecology, chemical ecology and reproductive biology of an oil flower
   species, Pterandra pyroidea (Malpighiaceae) from the Brazilian Cerrado.
   Populations of this species consist of plants with oil-secreting
   (glandular) flowers, plants with non-oil-secreting flowers (eglandular)
   or a mix of both plant types. This study specifically aims to clarify
   the role of eglandular morphs in this species.
   Methods Data on pollinators were recorded by in situ observations.
   Breeding system experiments were conducted by isolating inflorescences
   and by enzymatic reactions. Floral resources, pollen and floral oils
   offered by this species were analysed by staining and a combination of
   various spectroscopic methods.
   Key Results Eglandular flowers of P. pyroidea do not act as mimics of
   their oil-producing conspecifics to attract pollinators. Instead, both
   oil-producing and oil-free flowers depend on pollen-collecting bees for
   reproduction, and their main pollinators are bumble-bees. Floral oils
   produced by glandular flowers are less complex than those described in
   closely related genera.
   Conclusions Eglandular flowers represent a shift in the pollination
   system in which oil is being lost and pollen is becoming the main reward
   of P. pyroidea flowers. Pollination shifts of this kind have hitherto
   not been demonstrated empirically within Neotropical Malpighiaceae and
   this species exhibits an unusual transition from a specialized towards a
   generalized pollination system in an area considered the hotspot of
   oil-collecting bee diversity in the Neotropics. Transitions of this type
   provide an opportunity to study ongoing evolutionary mechanisms that
   promote the persistence of species previously involved in specialized
   mutualistic relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among flowering seasons in the time of flowering, synchrony
   and length of flowering, and fluctuations in the abundance of
   pollinators may cause a variation in pollen dispersal distance. In this
   study, we analyzed the temporal variation in pollen dispersal and
   breeding structure in the Neotropical tree species Tabebuia aurea
   (Bignoniaceae) and evaluated pollen dispersal between a population
   inside the reserve and a patch of isolated individuals on the edge of
   the reserve, and tested the hypothesis that isolated individuals are
   sinking for pollen. All adult trees (260) within a population of 40 ha
   and 9 isolated individuals on the edge of the reserve were sampled, and
   from these adults, 21 open-pollinated progeny arrays were analyzed in 2
   flowering seasons (309 seeds in 2004 and 328 in 2005). Genetic analyses
   were based on the polymorphism at 10 microsatellite loci. A high
   proportion of self-pollination found in both flowering seasons indicated
   a mixed-mating system. The mean pollen dispersal distance differed
   significantly between the two flowering seasons (307.78 m in 2004 and
   396.26 m in 2005). Maximum pollen dispersal was 2608 m, but most
   pollination events (65\%) occurred at distances <300 m. Our results also
   showed that isolated individuals are sinking for pollen, with high
   pollen flow between the population inside the reserve and individuals on
   the edge. These results are most likely due to the large pollinator
   species, which can potentially fly long distances, and also due to
   temporal variation in individual fecundity and contribution to pollen
   dispersal. Heredity (2011) 106, 911-919; doi:10.1038/hdy.2010.134;

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae: Iridoideae: Sisyrinchieae)
   is one of the largest, most widespread and most taxonomically complex
   genera in Iridaceae, with all species except one native to the American
   continent. Phylogenetic relationships within the genus were investigated
   and the evolution of oil-producing structures related to specialized
   oil-bee pollination examined.
   Methods Phylogenetic analyses based on eight molecular markers obtained
   from 101 Sisyrinchium accessions representing 85 species were conducted
   in the first extensive phylogenetic analysis of the genus. Total
   evidence analyses confirmed the monophyly of the genus and retrieved
   nine major clades weakly connected to the subdivisions previously
   recognized. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis was used to
   reconstruct biogeographical patterns, and to trace the evolutionary
   origin of glandular trichomes present in the flowers of several species.
   Key Results and Conclusions Glandular trichomes evolved three times
   independently in the genus. In two cases, these glandular trichomes are
   oil-secreting, suggesting that the corresponding flowers might be
   pollinated by oil-bees. Biogeographical patterns indicate expansions
   from Central America and the northern Andes to the subandean ranges
   between Chile and Argentina and to the extended area of the Parana river
   basin. The distribution of oil-flower species across the phylogenetic
   trees suggests that oil-producing trichomes may have played a key role
   in the diversification of the genus, a hypothesis that requires future
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation in agricultural landscapes lead to severe
   declines of abundance and richness of many insect species in the
   remaining isolated semi-natural habitats. We analysed possible barrier
   effects of large hedges and corridor effects of narrow grass strips that
   were hypothesized to affect foraging and dispersal of hymenopterans. We
   selected calcareous grasslands in the vicinity of Gottingen (Germany),
   which harbour high Hymenoptera diversity and are starting points for
   foraging and dispersal in the landscape. We installed pan traps to
   sample bees (i) on the grasslands; (ii) on grassland edges behind
   adjacent hedges (potential barriers) and without hedges; (iii) on grass
   strips in 100 m distance to the grassland, which were connected or
   unconnected to the grassland; and (iv) unconnected (isolated) grass
   strips in 300 m and 750 m distance to test for corridor and isolation
   effects on abundance and species richness of foraging wild bees.
   Additionally we provided trap nests for bees, wasps and their
   parasitoids on the grasslands and the strips. Species abundance and
   richness declined with increasing isolation from grasslands for foraging
   solitary bees, trap-nesting bees, wasps and parasitoids, but not for
   foraging bumblebees. Hedges did not confine movement of foraging bees.
   We found no mitigating effects of (100 m) corridor strips on any of the
   observed groups. We conclude that conservation of semi-natural habitats
   as sources of bee and wasp diversity is important and that grass strips
   act as sinks rather than corridors when high quality patches are nearby.

Abstract = {{1. The extent to which flower colour and other visual cues influence
   butterfly flower choice in the field is poorly understood, especially in
   comparison with choices by Hymenoptera.
   2. Using a novel approach to studies of visitation behaviour by
   butterflies, flower colour of four Asteraceae species was phenotypically
   manipulated to decouple the influence of that trait from others
   (including morphology and nectar rewards) on visitation by Lycaena
   heteronea, Speyeria mormonia, Cercyonis oetus, and Phyciodes campestris.
   3. Flower visits were recorded to experimental flower arrays in
   subalpine meadows to measure (i) spontaneous preference by butterflies
   for particular colours and other traits and (ii) flower constancy
   (longer than expected strings of visits made to flowers of the same
   species), a behaviour that can reduce interspecific gene flow in plants.
   4. Over three field seasons, 3558 individual flower visits in 1386
   foraging bouts were observed for free-flying butterflies. All four
   butterfly species responded to the phenotypic manipulations of flower
   colour, although in different ways. Speyeria mormonia and L. heteronea
   also exhibited preferences based on other flower traits. Lycaena
   heteronea responded to combinations of traits such that the other traits
   it preferred depended upon the context of flower colour.
   5. None of the butterfly species exhibited flower constancy in any of
   the arrays employed.
   6. The observed preferences show that butterflies, like some other
   pollinators, are potentially capable of exerting selection on colour and
   other floral traits. Moreover, these flower preferences can depend on
   the context of other flower traits. The absence of constancy contrasts
   with reports of high constancy in many bees.}},

Abstract = {{Male bees can be abundant at flowers, particularly floral hosts of those
   bee species whose females are taxonomic pollen specialists (oligolecty).
   Contributions of male bees to host pollination are rarely studied
   directly despite their prevalence in a number of pollination guilds,
   including those of some crop plants. In this study, males of the
   oligolectic bee, Peponapis pruinosa Say, were shown to be effective
   pollinators of summer squash, Cucurbita pepo L. Seven sequential visits
   from male P. pruinosa maximized squash fruit set and growth. This number
   of male visits accumulated during the first hour of their foraging and
   mate searching at flowers soon after sunrise. Pollination efficacy of
   male P. pruinosa and their abundances at squash flowers were sufficient
   to account for most summer squash production at our study sites, and by
   extrapolation, to two-thirds of all 87 North American farms and market
   gardens growing squashes that were surveyed for pollinators by
   collaborators in the Squash Pollinators of the Americas Survey. We posit
   that the substantial pollination value of male Peponapis bees is a
   consequence of their species' oligolecty, their mate seeking strategy,
   and some extreme traits of Cucurbita flowers (massive rewards, flower
   size, phenology).}},

Abstract = {{The rate of floral nectar production, an important trait for supporting

   anthropogenic disturbance variable retention logging, on the rate of
   daily nectar production of four common herbs (Chamerion angustifolium,
   Delphinium glaucum, Mertensia paniculata and Vicia americana) in the
   boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. We measured daily nectar production
   rates 9 years after experimental logging in three treatments: clear cuts
   (all merchantable trees removed), 50\% of trees retained, and unlogged
   controls. Per-flower nectar production rate was unaffected by logging
   for C. angusifolium, D. glaucum, and M. paniculata, and lower in
   unlogged controls than in the 50\% logging treatment for V. americana.
   Overall, we found a surprising robustness of nectar production of these
   herbaceous plants to the physical and environmental changes following
   logging. While other research has shown boreal forest logging to affect
   the densities of understory herbs, the per-flower nectar production in
   boreal forest understory herbs appears to be relatively insensitive to

Abstract = {{P>1. Pollination interactions comprise a network of connections between
   flowers and insect visitors. They are crucial for reproductive success
   in many angiosperms but are threatened by intensive agricultural
   practices. Although less intensive approaches, including organic
   farming, could improve farmland biodiversity, it is not clear whether or
   not these approaches enhance wild plant pollination and the stability of
   insect-flower interaction networks.
   2. We investigated the effects of organic vs. conventional farming on
   insect-flower interaction network size and structure, bee and hoverfly
   diversity, and pollination in 10 pairs of organic and conventional dairy
   farms in the Republic of Ireland.
   3. We found that insect-flower interaction networks on organic farms
   were larger and more asymmetrically structured than networks on
   conventional farms. Overall, however, networks contained fewer taxa and
   niche overlap and plant/animal ratios were relatively low compared with
   previously documented insect-flower interaction networks. Organic farms
   did attract higher numbers of bees partly because of higher floral
   abundances (mainly Trifolium sp.). Hoverfly evenness was greater in
   organic farms but neither abundance, richness nor evenness was related
   to floral abundance, suggesting organic farms provide additional
   resources for hoverflies. Pollination of Crataegus monogyna hawthorn was
   higher on organic farms, although pollen deposition was limited.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Organic dairy farming can increase the
   size and alter the structure of insect-flower interaction networks.
   However, network stability was not improved and all networks (organic
   and conventional) were vulnerable because of their small size, low niche
   overlap and low plant/animal ratios. Nonetheless, organic farming
   provided more flowers that attracted more flower visitors and improved
   pollination of C. monogyna. We suggest that strategic management of
   important flowers for pollinators in hedgerows and pastures should be
   endorsed in agri-environmental schemes. Sowing Trifolium spp., and
   allowing these plants to flower, could benefit bees, but more research
   into hoverfly ecology is necessary before realistic conservation
   recommendations can be made for this group. We conclude that organic
   farming, although not the solution in its present form, can benefit
   insect biodiversity, insect-flower interaction networks and
   insect-mediated pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The co-occurrence of plant species within a community is influenced by
   local deterministic or neutral processes as well as historical regional
   processes. Floral trait distributions of co-flowering species that share
   pollinators may reflect the impact of pollinator preference and
   constancy on their assembly within local communities. While pollinator
   sharing may lead to increased visitation rates for species with similar
   flowers, the receipt of foreign pollen via interspecific pollinator
   movements can decrease seed set. We investigated the pattern of
   community flower colour assembly as perceived by native honeybee
   pollinators within 24 local assemblages of co-flowering Oxalis species
   within the Greater Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. To explore the
   influence of pollinators on trait assembly, we assessed the impact of
   colour similarity on pollinator choices and the cost of heterospecific
   pollen receipt. We show that flower colour is significantly clustered
   within Oxalis communities and that this is not due to historical
   constraint, as flower colour is evolutionarily labile within Oxalis and
   communities are randomly structured with respect to phylogeny.
   Pollinator observations reveal that the likelihood of pollinators
   switching between co-flowering species is low and increases with flower
   colour similarity. Interspecific hand pollination significantly reduced
   seed set in the four Oxalis species we investigated, and all were
   dependant on pollinators for reproduction. Together these results imply
   that flower colour similarity carries a potential fitness cost. However,
   pollinators were highly flower constant, and remained so despite the
   extreme similarity of flower colour as perceived by honeybees. This
   suggests that other floral traits facilitate discrimination between
   similarly coloured species, thereby likely resulting in a low incidence
   of interspecific pollen transfer (IPT). If colour similarity promotes
   pollinator attraction at the community level, the observed clustering of
   flower colour within communities might result from indirect facilitative
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees play an important ecological role as pollinators of many
   wild plant species in the tropics and have significant potential for the
   pollination of agricultural crops. Nevertheless, conservation efforts as
   well as commercial breeding programmes require better guidelines on the
   amount of genetic variation that is needed to maintain viable
   populations. In this context, we carried out a long-term genetic study
   on the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris to evaluate the population
   viability consequences of prolonged breeding from a small number of
   founder colonies. In particular, it was artificially imposed a genetic
   bottleneck by setting up a population starting from only two founder
   colonies, and continued breeding from it for a period of over 10 years
   in a location outside its natural area of occurrence. We show that
   despite a great reduction in the number of alleles present at both
   neutral microsatellite loci and the sex-determining locus relative to
   its natural source population, and an increased frequency in the
   production of sterile diploid males, the genetically impoverished
   population could be successfully bred and maintained for at least 10
   years. This shows that in stingless bees, breeding from a small stock of
   colonies may have less severe consequences than previously suspected. In
   addition, we provide a simulation model to determine the number of
   colonies that are needed to maintain a certain number of sex alleles in

Abstract = {{P>1. Given the enormous quantitative pollen requirements of bees and
   their high efficiency in pollen removal, flowers should balance the need
   to attract bees for pollination on the one hand and to restrict pollen
   loss to bees on the other hand. Although various morphological flower
   traits have been identified that reduce excessive pollen losses to bees,
   the question of whether pollen might also be chemically protected
   remains largely unexplored.
   2. In this study we compared the larval performance of the two very
   closely related and highly pollen generalist solitary bee species Osmia
   bicornis and Osmia cornuta on four different pollen diets.
   3. Despite their very large pollen diet breadth, the two bee species
   showed striking differences in their ability to develop on pollen of the
   same plant species. Osmia bicornis developed well on Ranunculus pollen
   but failed to do so on Echium pollen, whereas the reverse held true for
   O. cornuta with the exception of two larvae grown on Ranunculus pollen
   that developed into dwarfish adults. Both bee species performed well on
   Sinapis pollen, while neither of the two species managed to develop on
   Tanacetum pollen.
   4. The observed differences in larval survival of these two Osmia
   species when reared on the same pollen diet as well as their failure to
   develop on Tanacetum pollen clearly demonstrate that bees require
   physiological adaptations to cope with the unfavourable chemical
   properties of certain pollen.
   5. Our results show a remarkable analogy of bee-flower relationships
   with herbivore-plant interactions and possibly indicate that the pollen
   of certain plant taxa might be chemically protected.}},

Abstract = {{Impatiens platyadena is a critically endangered balsam occurring in

   in the early morning between 0600 and 0830 h, but the anther dehisces
   one day before anthesis. The pollen-ovule ratio (2346 : 1) revealed that
   the species is adapted to entomophilous pollination. Pollen viability
   and stigma receptivity are temporally isolated; stigma is receptive on
   the third day and pollen viability is highest (75\%) on the day of
   anthesis. Field observations confirmed that the flowers offer both
   pollen and nectar to the visitors. The visitors include honey bees and
   butterflies, but the former served as better pollinators. Manual
   pollinations revealed that the species permits both geitonogamous and
   xenogamous pollination. The fruit set rate in natural pollination is low
   (38\%), but manual xenogamous pollination enhanced the fruit set up to
   65\%. Its dependence on specialized habitats, fragmentation of
   populations, narrow environmental niche, scarcity of pollinators,
   delayed stigma receptivity and low percentage of seed germination could
   be the reasons for its limited distribution and endangerment in the

Abstract = {{Background: Accurate estimates of movement behavior and distances
   travelled by animals are difficult to obtain, especially for
   small-bodied insects where transmitter weights have prevented the use of
   radio-tracking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we report the first successful use
   of micro radio telemetry to track flight distances and space use of
   bumblebees. Using ground surveys and Cessna overflights in a Central
   European rural landscape mosaic we obtained maximum flight distances of
   2.5 km, 1.9 km and 1.3 km for Bombus terrestris (workers), Bombus
   ruderatus (worker), and Bombus hortorum (young queens), respectively.
   Bumblebee individuals used large areas (0.25-43.53 ha) within one or a
   few days. Habitat analyses of one B. hortorum queen at the landscape
   scale indicated that gardens within villages were used more often than
   expected from habitat availability. Detailed movement trajectories of
   this individual revealed that prominent landscape structures (e. g.
   trees) and flower patches were repeatedly visited. However, we also
   observed long (i.e. >45 min) resting periods between flights (B.
   hortorum) and differences in flower-handling between bumblebees with and
   without transmitters (B. terrestris) suggesting that the current weight
   of transmitters (200 mg) may still impose significant energetic costs on
   the insects.
   Conclusions/Significance: Spatio-temporal movements of bumblebees can
   now be tracked with telemetry methods. Our measured flight distances
   exceed many previous estimates of bumblebee foraging ranges and suggest
   that travelling long distances to food resources may be common. However,
   even the smallest currently available transmitters still appear to
   compromise flower handling performance and cause an increase in resting
   behavior of bees. Future reductions of transmitter mass and size could
   open up new avenues for quantifying landscape-scale space use of insect
   pollinators and could provide novel insights into the behavior and
   requirements of bumblebees during critical life stages, e. g. when
   searching for mates, nest locations or hibernation sites.}},

Abstract = {{Charles Darwin was fascinated by the orchid-pollinator interactions, but

   Cypripedium, a model lineage of nonrewarding orchid flowers, is
   pollinated primarily by bees. Here we present both an example of floral
   mimesis of fungus-infected foliage in orchids and an example of
   flat-footed flies (Agathomyia sp.; Platypezidae) as pollen vectors for
   angiosperms. Cypripedium fargesii is a nectarless, terrestrial,
   endangered orchid from southwestern China that requires
   cross-pollination to produce the maximum number of viable embryos. All
   insects caught entering or leaving the labellum sac were Agathomyia sp.
   carrying conidia of Cladosporium sp. on their mouthparts and legs,
   suggesting mycophagy. Blackish hairy spots on the upper surface of
   foliage may imitate black mold spots, serving as short-term visual
   lures. Some odor molecules also associated with Cladosporium cultures
   were isolated in the floral scent. Mimesis of fungus-infected foliage
   probably represents an overlooked but important option in angiosperm
   diversification, because there are three to five more Cypripedium spp.

Abstract = {{South Puget Sound prairies are fragmented and degraded, which has a
   profound effect on plant populations, especially those that are already
   species of concern, such as Puget balsamroot (Balsamorhiza deltoidea
   Nutt). Small Puget balsamroot populations may be caused by inadequate
   pollination via insufficient pollinator services or by low quality
   pollen. Comparing potential germinants of hand-and naturally-pollinated
   inflorescences, which takes into account seed set and germination rates,
   illustrates the extent of pollination limitation on three South Puget
   Sound prairies on Joint Base Lewis-McChord (7S, Upper Weir, and
   Johnson). Our results demonstrated that Puget balsamroot is
   self-incompatible. On all three prairies, hand-pollinated inflorescences
   produced more potential germinants than naturally-pollinated
   inflorescences (P < 0.001), indicating that Puget balsamroot is pollen
   limited. In addition, 7S had a significantly greater number of floral
   and soil resources than either Johnson or Upper Weir (P < 0.05).
   However, there were not proportionally more bees found on 7S as compared
   to Johnson or Upper Weir. Therefore, Puget balsamroot on 7S may be
   pollen limited because pollinator populations are too small. Determining
   pollinator population sizes on the south Puget Sound lowland prairies
   could prove to be useful in determining the relative effects of
   pollinator limitation and low pollen quality. We suggest that fragmented
   ecosystems are more susceptible to pollinator limitations than congruent
   systems because ranges of pollinators no longer adequately overlap to
   facilitate travel between the ecosystem fragments.}},

   suggested substantial impacts of disturbance on the Niagara bee
   community, including evidence of high dominance by the most abundant

Journal = {{BOTHALIA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-40}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Following field and herbarium investigation of the subequatorial African
   and mainly western southern African Ferraria Burm. ex Mill. (Iridaceae:
   Iridoideae), a genus of cormous geophytes, we recognize 18 species,
   eight more than were included in the 1979 account of the genus by M.P.
   de Vos. One of these, F. ovata, based on Moraea vain Thunb. (1800), was
   only discovered to be a species of Ferraria in 2001, and three more are
   the result of our different view of De Vos's taxonomy. In tropical
   Africa, F. glutinosa is recircumscribed to include only mid- to late
   summer-flowering plants, usually with a single basal leaf and with
   purple to brown flowers often marked with yellow. A second
   summer-flowering species, F. candelabrum, includes taller plants with
   several basal leaves. Spring and early summer-flowering plants lacking
   foliage leaves and with yellow flowers from central Africa are referred
   to F. spithamea or F. welwitschii respectively.
   The remaining species are restricted to western southern Africa, an area
   of winter rainfall and summer drought. We recognize three new species:
   F. flava and F. ornata from the sandveld of coastal Namaqualand, and F.
   parva, which has among the smallest flowers in the genus and is
   restricted to the Western Cape coastal plain between Ganzekraal and
   Langrietvlei near Hopefield. Ferraria ornata blooms in May and June in
   response to the first rains of the season. Among the remaining species,
   F. uncinata subsp. macrochlamys is now F. macrochlamys and is treated as
   comprising three subspecies: subsp. macrochlamys from central and
   northern Namaqualand has leaves with thickened, crisped margins; subsp.
   kamiesbergensis from the southern Kamiesberg has leaves with unthickened
   margins and blades curved in one direction; and subsp. serpentina from
   gravels and sands of coastal Namaqualand has serpentine leaves, also
   with unthickened margins. Among the remaining species, F. divaricata
   subsp. arenosa is now treated as a synonym of F. divaricata. Because of
   our re-interpretation of the type of F. divaricata, plants which were
   called F. divaricata subsp. divaricata and subsp. australis are now
   treated as synonyms under the name F. variabilis.
   Flowers of Ferraria are unique in Iridaceae in having tepal limbs with
   crisped margins and a style that divides into flattened branches, each
   deeply forked with finely fringed adaxial margins. Despite relative
   floral uniformity, the genus displays a surprising ranee of discrete
   pollination systems for so small a genus. Pollinators include Diptera in
   the families Muscidae, Calliphoridae, and Sarcophagidae (F. crispa
   group); anthophorine and honey bees (F. ferrariola); eumenid wasps (F.
   divaricata, F. macrochamys, F variabilis); and Coleoptera in the
   families Meloidae and Melyridae (F. uncinata). Preliminary phylogenetic
   analysis using plastid DNA regions shows F. glutinosa to be sister to an
   unresolved cluster of southern African species and confirms as
   plesiomorphic the open branching habit, many-flowered inflorescences and
   exserted globose capsules that characterize F glutinosa and its
   immediate allies in subgen. Glutinosa.}},

   analyse potential pollinators of both plants during visits to their
   flowers in a restinga area in Bahia. The flowering displayed by both
   species was considered continuous and long duration, constantly
   providing pollen to floral visitors. C. ovalifolia was visited by 17
   species of bees and C. ramosa by 16 species, predominantly from the
   Apidae family (with a similarity index of 74\%). The behavior displayed
   by these visiting bees was of vibrating anthers. The small-sized
   Euglossa sp. Latreille, 1802 and Florilegus similis Urban, 1970 bees
   played less of a role as pollinators, since they rarely touched the
   flower stigma during harvests and were thus considered opportunist
   visitors or casual pollinators. Centris decolorata Lepetier, 1841 (= C.
   leprieuri) and Xylocopa subcyanea Perez, 1901 are large bees and were
   considered efficient pollinators of C. ovalifolia and C. ramosa because
   of the higher frequency and constancy of their visits, and their
   favourable behaviour and size for pollen transfer between flowers, which
   guarantees the survival of these native restinga plant species.}},

   analyses supported the existence of two differentiated clades that did
   not match currently accepted taxonomic classification. Accordingly,
   genetic distance did not correlate significantly with morphological
   distance. No fruits were produced from interspecific crosses, and there
   were no individuals with intermediate morphology that could indicate
   current and frequent hybridization events between species. I propose
   that the discordance between cpDNA data and conventional taxonomy could
   be explained by parallel evolution, or alternatively, by a very sporadic
   hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{The mimicry of malpighiaceous oil-flowers appears to be a recurrent
   pollination strategy among many orchids of the subtribe Oncidiinae.
   These two plant groups are mainly pollinated by oil-gathering bees,
   which also specialize in pollen collection by buzzing. In the present
   study, the floral ecology of the rewardless orchid Tolumnia guibertiana
   (Oncidiinae) was studied for the first time. The orchid was
   self-incompatible and completely dependent on oil-gathering female bees
   (Centris poecila) for fruit production. This bee species was also the
   pollinator of two other yellow-flowered plants in the area: the pollen
   and oil producing Stigmaphyllon diversifolium (Malpighiaceae) and the
   polliniferous and buzzing-pollinated Ouratea agrophylla (Ochnaceae). To
   evaluate whether this system is a case of mimetism, we observed
   pollinator visits to flowers of the three plant species and compared the
   floral morphometrics of these flowers. The behavior, preferences and
   movement patterns of Centris bees among these plants, as well as the
   morphological data, suggest that, as previously thought, flowers of T.
   guibertiana mimic the Malpighiaceae S. diversifolium. However, orchid
   pollination in one of the studied populations appears to depend also on
   the presence of O. agrophylla. Moreover, at the two studied populations,
   male and female pollination successes of T. guibertiana were not
   affected by its own floral display, and did not differ between
   populations. The results are discussed in relation to the behavior and
   preferences of Centris bees, as well as the differential presence and
   influence of each of the two floral models.}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Dispersal distances of insect pollinators are critical in defining their
   contribution to landscape-wide pollen movement and ultimately gene flow
   in natural and agricultural systems. We ask whether bee and fly
   pollinator taxa differ in their dispersal distances and transport of
   viable pollen in a human-modified system.
   Location
   Canterbury and Otago region, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods
   We captured pollen-carrying insects travelling outside of a model
   mass-flowering agricultural crop, Brassica rapa, using insect flight
   intercept traps at five distances (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 m) from the
   pollen source. We examined pollen loads and pollen viability to
   determine whether pollen transport distance and viability differ among
   pollinator taxa.
   Results
   A total of 5453 insects were collected of which 717 individuals from 26
   insect taxa were positively identified as dispersing pollen up to 400 m
   from the source. These taxa consisted of four species from two bee
   families (Hymenoptera: Apidae and Halictidae), and eight species from
   four fly families (Diptera: Bibiondae, Stratiomyidae, Syrphidae and
   Tachinidae). Apidae generally carried higher pollen loads and more
   viable pollen than most fly taxa. Taxa in the fly families Stratiomyidae
   and Syrphidae, however, carried pollen to 400 m, which is further than
   both bee families.
   Main conclusions
   A diverse array of wild and managed flower visitors can transport viable
   pollen from a pollen source to at least 400 m. Knowledge of the
   differences in transport distances among generalist pollinators in
   human-modified environments is crucial to understand the potential
   extent to which (1) pollen transport can facilitate gene flow and (2)
   unwanted hybridization may occur between crops and related weeds.}},

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{Ants are omnipresent in most terrestrial ecosystems, and plants have
   responded to their dominance by evolving traits that either facilitate
   positive interactions with ants or reduce negative ones. Because ants
   are generally poor pollinators, plants often protect their floral nectar
   against ants. Ants were historically absent from the geographically
   isolated Hawaiian archipelago, which harbors one of the most endemic
   floras in the world. We hypothesized that native Hawaiian plants lack
   floral features that exclude ants and therefore would be heavily
   exploited by introduced, invasive ants. To test this hypothesis,
   ant-flower interactions involving co-occurring native and introduced
   plants were observed in 10 sites on three Hawaiian Islands. We
   quantified the residual interaction strength of each pair of antplant
   species as the deviation of the observed interaction frequency from a
   null-model prediction based on available nectar sugar in a local plant
   community and local ant activity at sugar baits. As predicted, flowers
   of plants that are endemic or indigenous to Hawaii were more strongly
   exploited by ants than flowers of co-occurring introduced plants, which
   shared an evolutionary history with ants. We also found that the
   percentage of plant species with ant-visited flowers was much higher in
   Hawaii than in other island and continental systems, even reaching 100\%
   in habitats dominated by endemic species. We showed experimentally that
   the absence of ants on flowers of most introduced and few native plants
   species was due to morphological barriers, repellent floral scents, and
   to a lesser extent, unpalatable nectar. Analysis of floral volatiles,
   however, revealed no consistent ant-repellent ``syndrome{''}
   attributable to negative responses by ants, probably due to the high
   chemical variability within the floral scent bouquets. Results from a
   molecular phylogeny imply that floral defenses against ants were
   convergently lost in native Hawaiian plants. Exploitation of floral
   nectar by ants may be an important threat to Hawaiian ecosystems,
   reducing nectar resources available to native flower visitors and
   potentially reducing the reproductive success of the endangered endemic
   flora.}},

Abstract = {{Although conflicting selection from different resources is thought to
   play a critical role in the evolution of specialized species, the
   prevalence of conflicting selection in generalists is poorly understood.
   Plants may experience conflicting selection on floral traits by
   different pollinators and between genders. Using artificial selection to
   increase phenotypic variation, we tested for conflicting and nonadditive
   selection on wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) flowers. To do this, we
   measured selection by each of the major pollinator taxa through both
   male and female fitness, and tested for a single-generation response to
   selection by a subset of these pollinators. We found some evidence for
   conflicting selection on anther exsertion--sweat bees exerted
   stabilizing selection and larger bees selected for increased exsertion.
   Stamen dimorphism was only under selection by honey bees, causing a
   response to selection in the next generation, and flower size was under
   similar selection by multiple pollinators. Selection differed
   significantly between genders for two traits, but there was no evidence
   for stronger selection through male fitness or for conflicting selection
   between genders. Our results suggest wild radish flowers can adapt to
   multiple pollinators, as we found little evidence for conflicting

Abstract = {{1. Despite increasing interest in gardening for wildlife, experiments
   testing the conservation value of garden alterations are scarce,

   2. In this paper, we assess the ability of discrete additions of native
   wildflowers (70 plants of seven plant species added and subsequently
   monitored for 2 years) to augment species richness of beneficial insects
   including bees, butterflies and predatory wasps in New York City
   community gardens. We also evaluate the overall use of native and

   sites.
   3. Bayesian analyses failed to find a strong influence of the native
   plant additions on beneficial insect richness, after correcting for
   prior floral abundance.
   4. In addition, butterflies and megachilid (leaf-cutter) bees were found
   to heavily utilise introduced ornamental and crop flowers in these

   5. Our results suggest that exotic garden plants are utilised by, and

Abstract = {{That hummingbird-pollinated plants predominantly have red flowers has
   been known for decades, but well-investigated research studies are still
   rare. Preference tests have shown that hummingbirds do not have an
   innate preference for red colours. In addition, hummingbirds do not
   depend solely upon red flowers, because white-flowered
   hummingbird-pollinated plants are also common and temporarily abundant.
   Here we show that both white and red hummingbird-pollinated flowers
   differ from bee-pollinated flowers in their reflection properties for
   ultraviolet (UV) light. Hummingbird-pollinated red flowers are on
   average less UV reflective, and white hummingbird-pollinated flowers are
   more UV reflective than the same coloured bee-pollinated ones. In
   preference tests with artificial flowers, neotropical orchid bees prefer
   red UV-reflecting artificial flowers and white UV-nonreflecting flowers
   over red and white flowers with the opposite UV properties. By contrast,
   hummingbirds showed no preference for any colour in the same tests.
   Plotting floral colours and test stimuli into the honeybees' perceptual
   colour space suggests that the less attractive colours are achromatic
   for bees and therefore more difficult to detect against the background.
   This underlying colour preference in bees might provide hummingbirds
   with a private niche that is not attractive to bees.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of insect visits to flowers is essential in basic and
   applied pollination ecology studies but often fraught with difficulty.
   Floral visitation is highly variable, and observational studies are
   limited in scope due to the considerable time necessary to acquire
   reliable data. The aim of our study was to investigate whether the
   analysis of hydrocarbon residues (footprints) deposited by insects
   during flower visits would allow reconstruction of the visitor community
   and prediction of seed set for large numbers of plants. In 3 consecutive
   years, we recorded bumblebee visitation to wild plants of comfrey,
   Symphytum officinale, and later used gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify bumblebee-derived unsaturated
   hydrocarbons (UHCs) extracted from flowers. We found that the UHCs
   washed from corollas were most similar to the tarsal UHC profile of the
   most abundant bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum, in all 3 years. The
   species composition of the bumblebee communities estimated from UHCs on
   flowers were also similar to those actually observed. There was a
   significant positive correlation between the observed number of visits
   by each of three bumblebee species (contributing 3-68\% of flower
   visits) and the estimated number of visits based on UHC profiles.
   Furthermore, significant correlations were obtained separately for
   workers and drones of two of the study species. Seed set of comfrey
   plants was positively correlated to overall bumblebee visitation and the
   total amount of UHCs on flowers, suggesting the potential for pollen
   limitation. We suggest that quantifying cumulative footprint
   hydrocarbons provides a novel way to assess floral visitation by insects
   and can be used to predict seed set in pollen-limited plants.}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata F. (Hymenoptera:

   Northwest. Reports from users of M. rotundata in Idaho, Utah and
   Colorado have indicated exceptionally poor bee return from fields
   treated with novaluron to control Lygus spp. Our goal was to evaluate
   novaluron toxicity to immature M. rotundata using two different possible
   mechanisms of exposure. One goal was to assess immature mortality via
   treating nectar-pollen provisions and adults with novaluron. Immature M.
   rotundata mortality in all novaluron provision dosing treatments was
   significantly higher than the water or blank controls, providing
   evidence that novaluron is toxic to progeny in nest cells. The mean
   cumulative frequency showed that more eggs and 1st-2nd instars died
   compared to older instars. Female M. rotundata nested similarly in field
   cages during the field cage experiment; however, there was greater
   immature mortality in cages where females were fed sugar-water +
   novaluron compared to sugar-water only. Although females provided
   adequate provisions, there was a low percentage of egg hatch and larval
   development when females ingested novaluron before mating and nesting.
   Novaluron was also present in egg provision of bees collecting resources
   from novaluron-sprayed plants. At least 84\% of progeny died when the
   females were allowed to mate and nest 24 hours after a novaluron
   application. Novaluron could be contributing to poor bee return in

   Lygus spp. is an important consideration to improve ongoing bee health.}},

Abstract = {{The Indiana Dunes, and nearby natural areas in northwest Indiana, are
   floristically rich Midwest U.S. locales with many habitat types. We
   surveyed bees along a habitat gradient ranging from grasslands to
   forests in these locales, collecting at least 175 bee species along this
   gradient plus 29 additional species in other nearby habitats. About 25\%
   of all species were from the genus Lasioglossum and 12\% of the species
   were associated with sandy soils. Several bumblebee (Bombus) species of
   conservation concern that should occur in this region were not collected
   during our surveys. Similarity of the northwest Indiana bee fauna to
   other published U.S. faunas decreased about 1.3\% per 100 km distance
   from northwest Indiana. Thirty percent or bees netted from flowers were
   males. Males and females differed significantly in their frequency of
   occurrence on different plant species. For bees collected in bowl traps,
   the percentage captured in fluorescent yellow traps declined and in
   fluorescent blue traps increased from spring to late summer. Capture
   rates for different bee genera varied temporally, with about a quarter
   of the genera being captured most frequently in late spring and a
   quarter in late summer. Capture rates for most genera were higher in
   more open than in more closed canopy habitats. The maximum number of
   plant species on which a single bee species was captured plateaued at
   24, on average. Forty-nine percent of bee species known to occur in
   Indiana were found at these northwest Indiana sites. Having this
   relatively high proportion of the total Indiana bee fauna is consistent
   with Indiana Dunes existing at a biogeographic crossroads where
   grassland and forest biomes meet in a landscape whose climate and soils
   are affected by proximity to Lake Michigan. The resulting habitat,

Abstract = {{(Floral biology and a pollinator effectiveness test of the diurnal
   floral visitors of Tabernaemontana undulata Vahl. (Apocynaceae) in the
   understory of Amazon Rainforest, Brazil). In this paper we examined the
   floral biology, per-visit effectiveness, frequency of visits and
   relative abundance of the diurnal floral visitor taxa of T. undulata
   (Apocynaceae) at two populations located in the primary forest and in a
   disturbed area connected to the continuous forest. Its hermaphrodite
   flowers show a long and narrow floral tube and introrse anthers form a
   cone around the apex of the style head where the pollen is deposited.
   The stigmatic head has three functional regions, in a complex
   pollination mechanism favoring cross-pollination. In the pollinator
   censuses conducted in the primary forest population we registered
   Eulaema bombiformis. In the disturbed area Euglossa sp. was responsible
   for visits on T. undulata flowers. Eulaema bombiformis was not absent in
   the disturbed area, but preferred to forage on pollen and nectar-rich
   flowers of two neighboring flowering species. In the primary forest, T.
   undulata was the only flowering treelet at the end of the dry season.
   Significant differences were not observed regarding the frequency of
   visits and relative abundance among the diurnal flower visitors at both
   sites. In the per-visit effectiveness experiment among flower visitors,
   we observed one fruit produced after E. bombiformis' visits. Due to the
   complex breeding system of T. undulata in that it is characterized by
   very low fruit production even under natural conditions, an indirect
   measure of pollinator effectiveness is needed in at a future stage of
   this study in order to clarify the role of these bee species as
   pollinators of T. undulata.}},

Abstract = {{(Reproductive biology of Davilla kunthii A. St-Hil. (Dilleniaceae) in

   floral visitors and Davilla kunthii A. St.-Hil, as well as
   characteristics of its reproductive biology in Itacoatiara, state of
   Amazonas, Brazil. Tests of the breeding system were performed. The guild
   of visitors was described according to richness, abundance, relative
   frequency and constancy. The breeding system tests indicated that D.
   kunthii is self-compatible. The pollination system was characterized as
   generalist, with 39 visitor species, from three different orders. Bees
   were the main group of pollinators, thus some behavioural aspects were
   described. The period of highest foraging activity was between 7 and 10
   am. Some species presented agonistic and monopolistic behaviour. Given
   the behaviour and destructive potential, the Curculionidae seem to have
   a greater impact as seed predators than pollinators.}},

   J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 138: 145-155. 2011.-The genus Ariocarpus comprises
   seven endangered species endemic to the Chihuahuan Desert. We studied
   the reproductive ecology of Ariocarpus fissuratus at Cuatrocienegas
   region, Mexico, in order to explore if reproductive traits influence
   population viability. The size of perianth, pistils and stamens, floral
   behavior and controlled pollination treatments were assessed to
   determine Cruden's outcrossing index (OCI), the outcrossing rate and the
   mating system. The breeding system was estimated with pollen/ovule
   ratios (P/O) and outcrossing rate was estimated by comparing progeny
   from self- and outcross-pollination treatments. Frequency and behavior
   of floral visitors was determined, and nectar production recorded.
   Ariocarpus fissuratus blooms synchronously during three weeks in autumn.
   Flowers display herkogamy and homogamy, and OCI and P/O ratio suggest
   xenogamy. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted to evaluate the
   effect of pollination treatment on fruit set and number of viable seeds
   yielded per fruit. Fruit set was significantly higher in the outcrossing
   treatment than in the selfing treatments. The mating system indicates
   that A. fissuratus is mainly an outcrosser, showing a partial
   self-incompatibility with low fruit set for hand self-pollination.
   Floral visitors are native solitary and introduced bees, and beetles
   cause high levels of florivory damage. Reproductive ecology suggests
   that the need for pollinators, presence of exotic pollinators, partial
   self-incompatibility and florivory negatively affect sexual reproduction
   and thus the persistence of this endangered species.}},

   Phenology of Gonystylus bancanus in Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. A study
   on the phenology of Gonystylus bancanus (ramin melawis) was conducted in
   Pekan Forest Reserve, Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia, which covers areas of
   virgin and logged-over forests. Observations revealed that the flowering
   of G. bancanus was supra-annual. The smallest G. bancanus tree to flower
   was 29 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) and was located in a
   logged-over site. Most trees that flowered had larger dbh of more than
   40 cm and were found in logged-over and virgin forests. A total of 71-86
   days was recorded for full development from the budding stage to mature
   fruit formation. The budding phase was quite long, extending for more
   than a month. However, it took only about two weeks for the flowers to
   become fruits. The flowers of C. bancanus were pollinated by thrips
   (Heterothripts sp.) and stingless bees (Trigona canifrons and T
   laeviceps), while aphids (Aphis sp.), Prevost's squirrels (Callosciurus
   prevostii) and plantain squirrels (C. notatus) were identified as
   predators of G. bancanus flowers and fruits. Gonystylus bancanus seeds
   were mainly dispersed by gravity but the Malayan flying fox (Pteropus
   vampyrus) was also observed to disperse the fruits. Other fruit bats,
   namely, Cynopterus sphinx, Megaerops ecaudatus and Penthetor lucasi were
   also identified as potential seed dispersal agents of G. bancanus.}},

Abstract = {{Astragalus L. (Fabaceae) is an enormous and diverse plant genus with a

   the U.S. Intermountain West, including the Great Basin. It is being
   studied and ultimately propagated for extensive rangeland restoration
   projects throughout the sagebrush steppe. Understanding the breeding
   biology of A. filipes will be necessary for reliable and consistent
   commercial seed production with this species. We examined reproductive
   output from four manual, pollination treatments (autogamy, geitonogamy,
   xenogamy and distant xenogamy) in a common garden. As measures of
   fitness, we counted fruit and seed set, then germinated viable seeds, to
   assess reproductive output. This species is weakly self compatible;
   xenogamous pollen transfer results in nine times more seed per
   pollination. Pollen transfer between geographically distant seed
   accessions resulted in a decrease in seed germination, but no difference
   in fruit or seed set. Cross pollination by bees will be necessary for
   copious seed production by this species. In the wild, flowers of A.

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive Chiloglottis orchids lure their male thynnine wasp
   pollinators to the flower by emitting semiochemicals that mimic the
   specific sex pheromone of the wasp. Sexual deception is possible because
   chemical rather than visual cues play the key role in wasp mate search,
   suggesting that cryptic wasp species may be frequent. We investigated
   this prospect among Neozeleboria wasp pollinators of Chiloglottis
   orchids, drawing on evidence from molecular phylogenetic analysis at
   three genes (CO1, rhodopsin and wingless), population genetic and
   statistical parsimony analysis at CO1, orchid associations and their
   semiochemicals, and geographic ranges. We found a compelling
   relationship between genetically defined wasp groups, orchid
   associations, semiochemicals and geographic range, despite a frequent
   lack of detectable morphological differences. Our findings reveal
   multiple cryptic species among orchid pollinators and indicate that
   chemical changes are important for wasp reproductive isolation and
   speciation. The diversity of Neozeleboria may have enabled, rather than
   constrained, pollinator-driven speciation in these orchids. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flower morphology and inflorescence architecture
   affect pollinator foraging behaviour and thereby influence the process
   of pollination and the reproductive success of plants. This study
   explored possible ecological functions of the lever-like stamens and the
   floral design in Salvia cyclostegia.
   Methods Flower construction was experimentally manipulated by removing
   either the lower lever arms or the upper fertile thecae of the two
   stamens from a flower. The two types of manipulated individuals were
   intermixed with the control ones and randomly distributed in the
   population.
   Key Results Removing the sterile lower lever arms significantly reduced
   handling time per flower of the main pollinator, Bombus personatus.
   Interestingly, this manipulation did not increase the number of flowers
   probed per plant visit, but instead reduced it, i.e. shortened the visit
   sequence of the bumble-bees. Both loss of staminal lever function by
   removing lower lever arms and exclusion of self pollen by removing upper
   fertile thecae significantly reduced seed set per flower and seed set
   per plant. Both the manipulations interacted significantly with
   inflorescence size for the effect on female reproductive output.
   Conclusions Though the intact flowers demand a long handling time for
   pollinators, the reversible staminal lever is of advantage by promoting
   dispersal of pollen and thus the male function. The particular floral
   design in S. cyclostegia contributes to the floral constancy of B.

Abstract = {{The measurement of insect visits to flowers is essential for basic and
   applied pollination ecology, but is often fraught with difficulty.
   Floral visitation is highly variable and observational studies are
   limited in scope due to the considerable time needed to acquire reliable
   data. Our study investigates whether the analysis of hydrocarbon
   residues (footprints) deposited by insects during flower visits allows
   the reconstruction of the visitor community and the prediction of seed
   set for large numbers of plants. In three consecutive years we recorded
   bumblebee visitation to wild plants of comfrey, Symphytum officinale,
   and later used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to quantify
   bumblebee-derived unsaturated hydrocarbons (UHCs) extracted from
   flowers. The UHCs washed from corollae were most similar to the tarsal
   UHC profile of the most abundant bumblebee species, Bombus pascuorum, in
   all 3 years. The species compositions of the bumblebee communities
   estimated from UHCs on flowers were also similar to those actually
   observed. There was a significant positive correlation between the
   observed number of visits by each of three bumblebee species
   (contributing 3-68\% of the flower visits) and the estimated number of
   visits based on UHC profiles. Furthermore, significant correlations were
   obtained separately for workers and drones of two species. Seed set of
   comfrey plants was positively correlated with overall bumblebee
   visitation and the total amount of UHCs on flowers, suggesting the
   potential for pollen limitation. We suggest that quantifying cumulative
   footprint hydrocarbons provides a novel way to assess floral visitation
   by insects, and that this method can be used to predict seed set in
   pollen-limited plants.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Abolboda (Xyridaceae) belongs to the Poales, a
   predominantly wind-pollinated order whose phylogeny has been widely
   studied in recent years. The reproductive biology of Abolboda pulchella
   and A. poarchon was studied to determine the main pollination system of
   these species, providing the first experimental data on reproduction in
   the Xyridaceae.
   Methods A field study was conducted, including observations on the
   morphology and biology of the flowers, insect visits and pollinator
   behaviour. Experimental pollination treatments were performed to assess
   agamospermy, spontaneous self-pollination and self-compatibility.
   Pollination success was determined by pollen tube growth, and
   reproductive success was assessed by fruit-and seed-set.
   Key Results Abolboda pulchella and A. poarchon were pollinated by
   Apidae, Megachilidae and Halictidae bees. The floral resources were
   pollen and nectar that was produced by stylar appendages, an uncommom
   nectary type for monocotyledons. The species were self-compatible, and
   pollen tube growth from self-pollen was similar to that of cross-pollen.
   However, herkogamy prevented spontaneous selfing, rendering the plants
   dependent on the pollinator's activity. There was no production of seeds
   by agamospermy.
   Conclusions Melittophily is the main pollination system of these two
   Abolboda species. Nectar production was first recorded here for
   Xyridaceae, and along with self-compatibility, herkogamy and bee
   pollination, is an informative characteristic that can be used in future
   phylogenetic analyses of the family as well as Poales.}},

   3. The number of bumblebees foraging in the plots was positively related

   related to the number of simultaneous foragers, but only in B.

   of other bumblebees were species-specific and variable in their
   direction. Such contrasting effects can be explained in terms of
   bumblebee species' abundances and functional similarity. In some cases,
   the effect of previous foragers increased with Centaurea density.
   4. The local abundance of previous and simultaneous foragers affected

   Florida, USA, butterfly species to determine median lethal doses (24-h
   LD50), because limited acute toxicity data are available with this major
   insect group. Thorax- and wing-only applications of each insecticide
   were conducted. Based on LD50s, thorax and wing application exposures
   were acutely toxic to both caterpillars and adults. Permethrin was the
   most acutely toxic insecticide after thorax exposure to fifth instars
   and adult butterflies. However, no generalization on acute toxicity
   (sensitivity) of the insecticides could be concluded based on exposures
   to fifth instars versus adult butterflies or on thorax versus wing
   exposures of adult butterflies. A comparison of LD50s of the butterflies
   from this study (caterpillars and adults) with honeybee LD50s for the
   adult mosquito insecticides on a mu g/organism or mu g/g basis indicates
   that several butterfly species are more sensitive to these insecticides
   than are honeybees. A comparison of species sensitivity distributions
   for all three insecticides shows that permethrin had the lowest 10th
   percentile. Using a hazard quotient approach indicates that both
   permethrin and naled applications in the field may present potential
   acute hazards to butterflies, whereas no acute hazard of dichlorvos is
   apparent in butterflies. Butterflies should be considered as potential
   test organisms when nontarget insect testing of pesticides is suggested
   under FIFRA. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:997-1005. (C) 2011 SETAC}},

Abstract = {{In areas under different management conditions (management units, MUs)
   located either on a slope or at the base of a slope and either in a
   plantation or in a pasture, we compared the flower and fruit production,
   floral visitors, visitation rates and pre-emergent reproductive success
   (PERS) of Spondias tuberosa (Anacardiaceae) in an area of dry forest in
   NE Brazil. Individuals in the plantation MU produced more flowers per
   inflorescence than those in other MUs, but there were no statistical
   differences in mean fruit set among MUs. The only difference in mean
   visitation rates was between the plantation (65.83 +/- 38.49) and the
   slope sites (11.5 +/- 12.8). We observed visits by 19 insect species,
   including bees (31.6\%), butterflies (31.6\%), wasps (26.3\%) and flies
   (10.5\%). A clustering analysis based on the number of visits showed
   that a) the plantation site is most different from the other MUs, b) the
   pasture and the site at the base of the slope are similar to the slope
   site, and c) the higher frequency of visits of pollinators in the
   plantation MU was responsible for these differences. Of the 19 species
   of insects visiting the flowers, 12 were considered pollinators. The
   pollinator similarity analysis indicated a clear separation between
   areas and suggested that human activity has resulted in the replacement
   of native pollinators by exotic species. However, these changes
   apparently have not affected the pre-emergent reproductive success of S.
   tuberosa. Our results show that plant reproductive biology in semi-arid
   ecosystems may be modified by human action and that changes in floral
   production and pollinator guilds are the most conspicuous effects.
   However, the traditional management performed by local people may not
   affect the reproductive success of plant species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

   Conical cells have a significant impact on how water is retained on the

   We studied the behavior of this parasitic bee towards one of the more
   common host bee, Centris (Heterocentris) bicornuta. The female parasitic
   C. chichimeca were attracted to host bee, C. bicornuta nest cells that
   contained pollen, but only exhibited interest in entering and
   ovipositing when these host cells contained nectar. This interest was
   exhibited in three different ways: (1) the female parasite landed near
   the host bee's nest entrance and waited for the host bee to exit her
   nest cell before entering; (2) the female parasite entered briefly,
   re-emerged and re-entered with abdomen first; and (3) the female
   parasite entered the host bee nest as in (2), but did not exit and
   re-enter due to larger nest holes, where she could presumably turn
   around in any direction to lay the egg. We also found that female
   parasites would briefly hover in front of vials that contained pollen,
   but would land nearby when the vial contained nectar. Additionally, eggs
   of the female parasite were inserted horizontally in the wall of the
   host bee cell, primarily in the upper half. Larvae of these parasites
   hatched before the host bee egg and with their sickle shaped mandibles,
   killed any host bee egg or larva present and consumed the nest

Abstract = {{Honey bees live in groups of approximately 40,000 individuals and go
   through their reproductive cycle by the swarming process, during which
   the old queen leaves the nest with numerous workers and drones to form a
   new colony. In the spring time, many clues can be seen in the hive,
   which sometimes demonstrate the proximity to swarming, such as the
   presence of more or less mature queen cells. In spite of this the actual
   date and time of swarming cannot be predicted accurately, as we still
   need to better understand this important physiological event. Here we
   show that, by means of a simple transducer secured to the outside wall
   of a hive, a set of statistically independent instantaneous vibration
   signals of honey bees can be identified and monitored in time using a
   fully automated and non-invasive method. The amplitudes of the
   independent signals form a multi-dimensional time-varying vector which
   was logged continuously for eight months. We found that combined with
   specifically tailored weighting factors, this vector provides a
   signature highly specific to the swarming process and its build up in
   time, thereby shedding new light on it and allowing its prediction
   several days in advance. The output of our monitoring method could be
   used to provide other signatures highly specific to other physiological
   processes in honey bees, and applied to better understand health issues
   recently encountered by pollinators. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{687-698}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ecological interaction networks are a valuable approach to understanding
   plant-pollinator interactions at the community level. Highly structured
   daily activity patterns are a feature of the biology of many flower
   visitors, particularly provisioning female bees, which often visit
   different floral sources at different times. Such temporal structure
   implies that presence/absence and relative abundance of specific
   flower-visitor interactions (links) in interaction networks may be
   highly sensitive to the daily timing of data collection. Further,
   relative timing of interactions is central to their possible role in
   competition or facilitation of seed set among coflowering plants sharing
   pollinators. To date, however, no study has examined the network impacts
   of daily temporal variation in visitor activity at a community scale.
   Here we use temporally structured sampling to examine the consequences
   of daily activity patterns upon network properties using fully
   quantified flower-visitor interaction data for a Kenyan savanna habitat.
   Interactions were sampled at four sequential three-hour time intervals
   between 06:00 and 18:00, across multiple seasonal time points for two
   sampling sites. In all data sets the richness and relative abundance of
   links depended critically on when during the day visitation was
   observed. Permutation-based null modeling revealed significant temporal
   structure across daily time intervals at three of the four seasonal time
   points, driven primarily by patterns in bee activity. This sensitivity
   of network structure shows the need to consider daily time in network
   sampling design, both to maximize the probability of sampling links
   relevant to plant reproductive success and to facilitate appropriate
   interpretation of interspecific relationships. Our data also suggest
   that daily structuring at a community level could reduce indirect
   competitive interactions when coflowering plants share pollinators, as
   is commonly observed during flowering in highly seasonal habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The primary hypothesis of this study was that in the Galapagos Islands,
   fruit and seed set via nocturnal pollination would exceed that of
   diurnal pollination because of the greater insect activity at night
   typical of hot, arid regions. Clerodendrum molle, a widespread member of
   the Galapagos flora was submitted to pollination experiments, visitor
   observations, nectar sampling, pollen transfer studies, pollen ovule
   ratio studies, and pollen measurements. Flowers set fruit and seed via
   open pollination, autonomous autogamy, facilitated autogamy, facilitated
   cross-pollination, diurnal pollination, and nocturnal pollination.
   Results indicate no significant difference in fruit set.
   Cross-pollinated flowers showed a significant increase in seed set over
   all treatments except facilitated autogamy. Nocturnal and diurnal fruit
   and seed set did not differ significantly. Nocturnal visitors included
   ants, spiders, hawk moths, and roaches whereas diurnal visitors included
   carpenter bees and ants. Galapagos members of C. molle exhibit
   incomplete protandry and set fruit via autonomous autogamy as a result
   of natural selection in an environment with few faithful pollinators.
   Overall low fruit and seed set are likely because of a combination of
   pollen and resource limitation, the latter exacerbated by nectar
   robbing. Studies of island angiosperms are crucial for complete
   understanding of the population dynamics of indigenous plants, which can
   assist conservation officials in protecting these species.}},

Abstract = {{The large terrestrial orchid genus Satyrium underwent evolutionary

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Most plant species are visited by a diverse array of visitors that may
   contribute differently to reproductive success. In particular, the size
   of visitors, relative to flower size, may have severe implications for
   plant fitness, as it can affect the mechanics of the pollination
   process. Ononis masquillierii, a rare endemic legume in northern Italy,
   is visited by numerous bee species of different families and sizes. To
   evaluate the effect of bee guilds on seed set, we compared the relative
   efficiency of four size classes of bees visiting flowers in eight plant
   populations occurring in the Apennines. Size classes were assorted by
   body weight. Reproductive success was positively related to plant
   population size and affected by the visitation frequency of the bee size
   guilds: higher visitation rates by larger bees (medium-large Andrenidae
   and large Apidae) increased seed set, whereas high visitation rates by
   smaller bees (small Halictidae and small-medium Megachilidae) reduced
   seed set. We conclude that the influence of bee size on seed set is
   related to the pollen foraging techniques of the different bee guilds.
   Larger bees paying short visits to flowers remove one `batch' of pollen
   and transfer it to another flower. In contrast, smaller bees enter the
   flower entirely and activate the pump-like pollen dispensing mechanism
   several times, resulting in a higher degree of selfing. These behaviours
   may result in differential seed sets as the flowers are
   self-incompatible, i.e. seed set may be reduced after visitation by

Abstract = {{Widespread reports of low pollination rates suggest a recent
   anthropogenic decline in pollination that could threaten natural and
   agricultural ecosystems. Nevertheless, unequivocal evidence for a
   decline in pollination over time has remained elusive because it was not
   possible to determine historical pollination rates. Here we demonstrate
   a widely applicable method for reconstructing historical pollination
   rates, thus allowing comparison with contemporary rates from the same
   sites. We focused on the relationship between the oil-collecting bee
   Rediviva peringueyi (Melittidae) and the guild of oil-secreting orchid
   species (Coryciinae) that depends on it for pollination. The guild is
   distributed across the highly transformed and fragmented lowlands of the
   Cape Region of South Africa. We show that rehydrated herbarium specimens
   of Pterygodium catholicum, the most abundant member of the guild,
   contain a record of past pollinator activity in the form of pollinarium
   removal rates. Analysis of a pollination time series showed a recent
   decline in pollination on Signal Hill, a small urban conservation area.
   The same herbaria contain historical species occurrence data. We
   analyzed this data and found that there has been a contemporaneous shift
   in orchid guild composition in urban areas due to the local extirpation
   of the non-clonal species, consistent with their greater dependence on
   seeds and pollination for population persistence.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluorinated organic chemicals like perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
   (PFOS) are persistent environmental pollutants that have been measured
   in a great diversity of wildlife worldwide, especially in the aquatic
   compartment. However, little information is available on the presence
   and effects of PFOS in the terrestrial compartment. Therefore, we
   investigated in this project the risks for effects, bioaccumulation and
   potential mechanisms of activity of PFOS in the bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris L. (Hymenoptera: Apidae) that is an important worldwide
   pollinator in the terrestrial compartment of wildflowers and cultivated
   crops. The exposure to PFOS occurred orally via the drinking of treated
   sugar water in a wide range from 1 mu g/l up to 10 mg/l, containing
   environmentally relevant as well as high concentrations, and this was
   done with use of microcolonies of B. terrestris in the laboratory. A
   chronic toxicity assay demonstrated high bumblebee worker mortality (up
   to 100\%) with an LC50 of 1.01 mg/l (R (2) = 0.98). In addition, PFOS
   posed strong detrimental reproductive effects, and these concerted with
   a dramatic reduction in ovarian size. HPLC-MS demonstrated a
   bioaccumulation factor of 27.9 for PFOS in bumblebee workers fed with
   sugar water containing 100 mu g/l PFOS during 5 weeks (2184 +/- A 365
   ng/g BW). Finally, potential mechanisms of activity were investigated to
   explain the significant impact of PFOS on survival and reproduction
   capacity of B. terrestris. Exposure of bumblebee workers to PFOS
   resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial electron transport
   activity (p = 0.035) and lipid amounts (p = 0.019), while the respective
   p-values were 0.58 and 0.12 for protein and glucose amounts. Hence,
   addition of PFOS to ecdysteroid responsive Drosophila melanogaster S2
   cells resulted in a strong antagonistic action on the EcR-b.act.luc
   reporter construct, demonstrating that PFOS may exert its effects
   partially through an endocrine disrupting action via the insect molting
   hormone or ecdysteroid receptor.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change has a major impact on goods and services that our
   environment supplies for society. While detailed ecological or
   biophysical field studies are needed to quantify the exact amount of
   ecosystem service supply at local scales, such a monitoring might be
   unfeasible at the regional scale. Since field scale monitoring schemes
   for ecosystem services or ecosystem functioning are missing, proxy based
   indicators can help to assess the historic development of ecosystem
   services or ecosystem functioning at the regional scale. We show at the
   example of the historic development (1964-2004) in the district of
   Leipzig/Germany how land use/land cover data can be used to derive
   regional scale indicators for ecosystem functions. We focus thereby on
   two hypotheses: (1) the ecosystem functioning has degraded over time and
   (2) changes in land use configuration play an important role in this
   degradation. The study focuses on indicators for ecosystem functions
   related to (i) water purification by riparian buffer strips, (ii)
   pollination, (iii) food production and (iv) outdoor recreation. Each
   indicator builds on the analysis of land use configuration and land use
   composition information and is tested on sensitivity/robustness with
   respect to parameters which had to be estimated based on expert
   knowledge. We show that land use composition is an important aspect in
   our ecosystem service assessment. Although our study region is faced
   with a maximum land use change of 11\% in the major land use classes
   between 1964 and 2004. we see a decrease of ecosystem function
   indicators up to 23\%. The regional assessment shows an overall trend
   for degradation of ecosystem functioning from 1964 to 1984. This trend
   is reversed between 1984 and 1994 but the process slowed down until 2004
   without reaching the level of 1964. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Two alien Impatiens species are spreading in Europe and share habitats
   with the native Impatiens noli-tangere. We studied their reproductive

   morphology was examined, insect observations were made, and hand
   pollination treatments were performed. Floral biology differed among
   species. Impatiens glandulifera and I. noli-tangere presented large
   quantities of sucrose-dominant nectar, contrary to Impatiens parviflora.
   The latter had high autonomous selfing ability (81.4\% fruit set) linked
   to complete self-compatibility. No inbreeding depression was detected
   for this species. The second alien, I. glandulifera, showed lower
   autonomous selfing (9.3\% fruit set), with high self-compatibility and
   low inbreeding depression (delta = 0.11). No evidence of autonomous
   selfing was found for the native, which presented the lowest
   self-compatibility and the highest inbreeding depression (delta = 0.42).
   However, all species can be considered self-compatible. Impatiens
   glandulifera flowers were visited by insects up to 250 times during
   their life span, whereas I. noli-tangere and I. parviflora flowers

Abstract = {{It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by
   insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen
   vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation
   of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact
   with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67\% to 96\% but these
   have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion
   of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and
   unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that
   recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind.
   The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78\% in
   temperate-zone communities to 94\% in tropical communities. By
   correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we
   estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated

   diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline
   in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural
   communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both
   ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in

Abstract = {{While there is a range of colours found in plants the predominant colour
   is green. Pigments in plants have several roles e.g. photosynthesis and
   signalling. If colour is to be used as a signal then it must stand out
   from green. However, one should be aware that there are also coloured
   compounds where we have not yet fully investigated the role of colour in
   their functions they may have roles in, for example, defence or heat
   exchange.
   In this paper, we will describe the basic chemistry of the major
   pigments found in plants and especially floral pigments. We will then
   discuss their locations in parts of the flower (such as sepals, petals,
   pollen and nectar), the cells in which they are found and their
   sub-cellular locations.
   Floral pigments have a large role to play in pollination of flowers by
   animals. They can and are modified in many ways during the development
   of flowers in nature, for example, at emergence and post-pollination.
   There are a range of biochemical mechanisms of colour change both within
   flowers and in isolated pigments. Some of the factors influencing colour
   are temperature, co-pigments, pH, metals, sugars, anthocyanin stacking
   and cell shape.
   There is a renewed interest in analysing floral pigments and how they
   are modified partly because of advances in recombinant DNA technologies,
   but also because of pollinators and their significance to biodiversity
   and for evolutionary studies. There is continued strong interest from
   the horticultural industry for the introduction of new colours e.g. the
   blue rose and for the exploitation of natural dyes. Funding in this area
   may impact future research in a potentially beneficial way but it must
   not deflect us from science-based conservation. Crown Copyright (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Angiosperms exhibit staggering diversity in floral form, and evolution
   of floral morphology is often correlated with changes in pollination
   syndrome. The showy, bilaterally symmetrical flowers of the model
   species Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) are highly specialized for
   bee pollination. In A. majus, CYCLOIDEA (CYC), DICHOTOMA (DICH),
   RADIALIS (RAD), and DIVARICATA (DIV) specify the development of floral
   bilateral symmetry. However, it is unclear to what extent evolution of
   these genes has resulted in flower morphological divergence among
   closely related members of Plantaginaceae differing in pollination
   syndrome. We compared floral symmetry genes from insect-pollinated
   Digitalis purpurea, which has bilaterally symmetrical flowers, with
   those from closely related Aragoa abietina and wind-pollinated Plantago
   major, both of which have radially symmetrical flowers. We demonstrate
   that Plantago, but not Aragoa, species have lost a dorsally expressed
   CYC-like gene and downstream targets RAD and DIV. Furthermore, the
   single P. major CYC-like gene is expressed across all regions of the
   flower, similar to expression of its ortholog in closely related
   Veronica serpyllifolia. We propose that changes in the expression of
   duplicated CYC-like genes led to the evolution of radial flower symmetry
   in Aragoa/Plantago, and that further disintegration of the symmetry gene
   pathway resulted in the wind-pollination syndrome of Plantago. This
   model underscores the potential importance of gene loss in the evolution

   Pollen portioning results through successive ripening and opening within

   be ripe and open along their whole length. In all the three genera,
   nectar secretion begins in the late bud stage.
   Andrena (Euandrena) symphyti collects pollen in the three mentioned
   genera by manipulation of anthers and buzzing, nectar by robbing through
   transversal slits bitten near the base of the corolla-filament-tube.
   Nectar collection is interrupted by nectar concentrating. Members of

   sativus). We manipulated leaf and root herbivory with striped cucumber
   beetle (Acalymma vittatum) adults and larvae, respectively, and
   manipulated pollination with supplemental pollen. Both enhanced leaf and
   root herbivory reduced plant growth, and leaf herbivory reduced
   subsequent leaf damage. Plants with enhanced root herbivory produced
   35\% fewer female flowers, while leaf herbivory had no effect on flower
   production. While leaf herbivory reduced the time that honey bees spent
   probing flowers by 29\%, probing times on root-damaged plants were over
   twice as long as those on control plants. Root herbivory increased
   pollen limitation for seed production in spite of increased honey bee
   preference for plants with root damage. Leaf damage and hand-pollination
   treatments had no effect on fruit production, but plants with enhanced
   root damage produced 38\% fewer fruits that were 25\% lighter than those
   on control plants. Despite the positive effect of belowground damage on
   honey bee visitation, root herbivory had a stronger negative effect on
   plant reproduction than leaf herbivory. These results demonstrate that
   the often-overlooked effects of belowground herbivores may have profound
   effects on plant performance.}},

Abstract = {{Jatropha curcas L. (Euphorbiaceae) is being increasingly planted
   worldwide, but questions remain regarding its pollination biology. This
   study examined the contribution of diurnal and nocturnal insects to the
   pollination of monoecious J. curcas, through its floral biology,
   pollination ecology, and foraging behavior of potential pollinators.
   Nectar production of both male and female flowers peaked in the morning,
   declined in the afternoon, and rapidly bottomed during the night in all
   of their anthesis days. The diurnal visitors to the flowers of J. curcas
   are bees and flies, and the nocturnal visitors are moths. Flowers
   received significantly more visits by diurnal insects than by nocturnal
   insects. Through bagging flowers during night or Clay or both or
   exclusion, we compared fruit and seed production caused by diurnal and
   nocturnal pollinators. Both nocturnal and diurnal visitors were
   successful pollinators. However, flowers exposed only to nocturnal
   visitors produced less fruits than those exposed only to diurnal
   visitors. Thus, diurnal pollinators contribute more to seed production
   by J. curcas at the study site.}},

Abstract = {{Although plant breeding systems are evolutionarily labile, a shift from
   one system to another can involve formidable ecological obstacles. In
   order for gynodioecy to evolve from hermaphroditism, the carriers of a
   male-sterility mutation (i.e., females) must overcome two major hurdles:
   females must attract pollinators without offering pollen as a reward,
   and they must produce enough seeds to compensate for the loss of
   reproduction through the paternal route. We investigated the relative
   performance of female and hermaphroditic plants in a greenhouse study of
   Mimulus guttatus originating from a largely hermaphroditic population.
   Females had larger floral displays than did hermaphrodites, with 5\%
   wider corollas and 34\% more flowers open at one time. They also
   produced 22\% more flowers over a lifetime and 25\% more ovules per
   ovary than hermaphrodites, giving females 1.53 times more maternal
   reproductive potential. In a related experiment, bumblebees visited
   female plants just as frequently as hermaphroditic plants, even though
   the females offered no pollen reward. Although the relative advantages
   enjoyed by females may be insufficient to overcome the obstacles for the
   evolution of stable gynodioecy, they might be strong enough to explain
   the maintenance of genetic variation for male-sterility alleles often
   observed in natural populations of M. guttatus.}},

Abstract = {{All volatile organic compounds (VOCs) vary quantitatively, yet how such
   variation affects their ecological roles is unknown. Because floral VOCs
   are cues for both pollinators and floral antagonists, variation in
   emission may have major consequences for costs and benefits in
   plant-pollinator interactions. In Polemonium viscosum, the emission rate
   for the floral VOC 2-phenylethanol (2PE) spans more than two orders of
   magnitude. We investigated the ecological and evolutionary impacts of
   this immense phenotypic variation. The emission rate of 2PE varies
   independently of nectar rewards and thus is uninformative of
   profitability. Emission is elevated in flowers that are morphologically
   vulnerable to ant larcenists, suggesting that chemical deterrence may
   compensate for weak physical barriers. In nature, plants emitting more
   2PE than their neighbors escape ant damage. Flower-damaging ants die
   when exposed to 2PE in the laboratory, and they avoid high 2PE emitters
   in the field. High 2PE also reduces bumblebee visitation and
   pollination, suggesting an ecological cost of defense in pollinator
   service. However, at more moderate emission rates, 2PE enhances the
   amount of nectar left in flowers, at no pollination cost. In conclusion,
   repellency of 2PE is highly sensitive to dosage, giving it a key role in
   shaping ecological interactions between skypilot plants and their floral

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service. Although bees are the most
   important pollinators, they are endangered by intensive agricultural
   practices. The present study investigated the effects of farmland
   management and environmental factors at local and landscape scales on
   bees in Central Hungary.
   Bees were sampled in winter cereal fields that varied in the amount of
   applied fertilizer and insecticide use. Measurements included total,
   small and large bee species richness and abundance; stability of total
   species richness and abundance (coefficient of variation, CV); the
   nitrogen content of fertilizers; the number of insecticide applications;
   within-field location; species richness and abundance of
   insect-pollinated plants; and the percentage of semi-natural areas in a
   500-m radius circle around the fields under study.
   Increasing the amount of fertilizer decreased total and small bee
   abundance and increased the CV of total bee abundance. Insecticide use
   had a significant negative effect on total and small bee species
   richness and on large bee abundance. The percentage of semi-natural
   habitats in a 500-m radius did not influence bee species richness and
   abundance.
   The results obtained confirms that the intensification of farmland
   management poses a threat to bee diversity, and thus may reduce
   pollination services. Recently-introduced agri-environment schemes are
   one potential approach for managing agricultural land use: reduced
   amounts of fertilizer and a cessation of insecticide application might
   lead to high bee species richness and abundance and ensure the
   pollination of wild plants and flowering crops.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocleys martii (Limnocharitaceae) is an annual aquatic herb common in
   ephemeral isolated ponds in semi-arid northe-astern Brazil. We studied
   pollination of H. martii, emphasizing reproductive success and
   association with oligolectic pollinators. The yellow flowers bear a
   central cone of staminodes that encloses the fertile stamens and four
   free carpels. The self-incompatible species depends on pollinators to
   set fruits. In 25 temporary water bodies in five Brazilian states,
   Protodiscelis palpalis bees (Colletidae, Paracolletinae) were the unique
   effective pollinators of H. martii and, in 18 of these, the sole flower
   visitors. Females of this narrowly oligolectic species show adapted
   behaviour to access the pollen chamber in the flower centre. Females
   removed more than 80\% of the 480 000 pollen grains in only 2 h from the
   flowers but maintained a high visitation frequency almost until flower
   senescence. In this highly specialized plant-pollinator system, on
   average, 1.6\% of the pollen grains reached the stigmatic surface and
   9.6\% remained uncollectible in the flowers. In the absence of P.
   palpalis, flowers set almost no seeds, indicating reproductive
   dependence on the oligolectic species. This pioneer pollination study of
   a species of Limnocharitaceae provides evidence of a close relationship
   of the family to species of Protodiscelis, their specific pollinators.

Abstract = {{2. Here we looked at the natural variation in the coloration of two

   species of native bees responded to variation in colour contrast
   generated by spiders sitting in flowers compared with vacant flowers. We
   used data from a bee choice experiment with D. evanida spiders and
   Trigona carbonaria bees and also published data on T. spectabilis
   spiders and Austroplebeia australis bees.
   3. In the field both spider species were always achromatically (from a
   distance) undetectable but chromatically (at closer range) detectable
   for bees. Experimentally, we showed species-specific differences in bee
   behaviour towards particular spider colour variation: T. carbonaria bees
   did not show any preference for any colour contrasts generated by D.
   evanida spiders but A. australis bees were more likely to reject flowers
   with more contrasting T. spectabilis spiders.
   4. Our study suggests that some of the spider colour variation that we

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   To study the effects of isolation and size of small tropical islands on
   species assemblages of bees (superfamily Apoidea) and wasps (superfamily
   Vespoidea).
   Location
   Twenty islands in the Kepulauan Seribu Archipelago off the coast of west
   Java, Indonesia. The size of surveyed islands ranges between 0.75 and
   41.32 ha; their distance from the coast of Java varies between 3 and 62
   km.
   Methods
   Field work was conducted from February to May 2005. Bees and wasps were
   caught with a sweep net during sampling units of 15 min, continuing
   until four consecutive samples revealed no new species. Total species
   richness was quantified by the estimators Chao 2, first-order jackknife
   and Michaelis-Menten. The software binmatnest was used to test for
   nestedness of species assemblages. Similarities of species composition
   between islands were quantified by S circle divide rensen's similarity
   index.
   Results
   Eighty-two species were recorded on the 20 surveyed islands. Species
   richness declined with increasing isolation of islands from the source
   area, Java. Although the size of the largest island exceeded that of the
   smallest island by a factor of almost 60, island size only very weakly
   affected species richness of bees; no effect of island size was found
   for wasps. Mean body size of species decreased with increasing island
   isolation. Nestedness of island faunas was only weakly developed.
   Species composition of both superfamilies was affected by island
   isolation, but not by island size.
   Main conclusions
   While the species-isolation relationship on the very small islands of
   Kepulauan Seribu followed the prediction of MacArthur and Wilson's
   equilibrium theory, the absence of a species-area relationship indicated
   a weak `small-island effect', at least in wasps. The combination of an
   only weakly developed pattern of nested species subsets, the shift in
   species compositions and the decline of mean body size with increasing
   island isolation from the source area indicates that biotic interactions
   and different species traits contribute to the shaping of communities of
   bees and wasps within the archipelago. The potential of biotic
   interactions for generating distribution patterns of species within the
   archipelago is also emphasized by the observed restriction of some
   species with apparently high dispersal abilities to outer islands.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence for pollinator declines has led to concern that inadequate
   pollination services may limit crop yields. The global trade in
   commercial bumble bee (Bombus spp.) colonies provides pollination
   services for both glasshouse and open-field crops. For example, in the
   United Kingdom, commercial colonies of nonnative subspecies of the
   bumble bee Bombus terrestris L. imported from mainland Europe are widely
   used for the pollination of raspberries, Rubus idaeus L. The extent to
   which these commercial colonies supplement the services provided by wild
   pollinators has not been formally quantified and the impact of
   commercial bumble bees on native bees visiting the crop is unknown.
   Here, the impacts of allowing commercially available bumble bee colonies
   to forage on raspberry canes are assessed in terms of the yield of
   marketable fruit produced and the pollinator communities found foraging
   on raspberry flowers. No differences were found in the abundance,
   diversity, or composition of social bee species observed visiting
   raspberry flowers when commercial bumble bees were deployed compared
   with when they were absent. However, weight of marketable raspberries
   produced increased when commercial bees were present, indicating that
   wild pollinator services alone are inadequate for attaining maximum
   yields. The findings of the study suggests that proportional yield
   increases associated with deployment of commercial colonies may be
   small, but that nevertheless, investment in commercial colonies for
   raspberry pollination could produce very significant increases in net
   profit for the grower. Given potential environmental risks associated
   with the importation of nonnative bumble bees, the development of
   alternative solutions to the pollination deficit in raspberry crops in
   the United Kingdom may be beneficial.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{200-207}},

Abstract = {{When co-occurring plant species overlap in flowering phenology they may
   compete for the service of shared pollinators. Competition for
   pollination may lower plant reproductive success by reducing the number
   of pollinator probes or by decreasing the quality of pollen transport to
   or from a focal species. Pair-wise interactions between plants sharing
   pollinators have been well documented. However, relatively few studies
   have examined interactions for pollination among three or more plant
   species, and little is known about how the outcomes and mechanisms of
   competition for pollination may vary with competitor species
   composition. To better understand how the dynamics of competition for
   pollination may be influenced by changes in the number of competitors,
   we manipulated the presence of two competitors, Lythrum salicaria and
   Lobelia siphilitica, and quantified reproductive success for a third
   species, Mimulus ringens. Patterns of pollinator preference and
   interspecific transitions in mixed-species arrays were significantly
   influenced by the species composition of competitor plants present. Both
   pair-wise and three-species competition treatments led to a similar
   similar to 40\% reduction in Mimulus ringens seed set. However, the
   patterns of pollinator foraging we observed suggest that the relative
   importance of different mechanisms of competition for pollination may
   vary with the identity and number of competitors present. This variation
   in mechanisms of competition for pollination may be especially important
   in diverse plant communities where many species interact through shared
   pollinators.}},

   community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus) are vitally important pollinators of wild plants
   and agricultural crops worldwide. Fragmentary observations, however,
   have suggested population declines in several North American species.
   Despite rising concern over these observations in the United States,
   highlighted in a recent National Academy of Sciences report, a national
   assessment of the geographic scope and possible causal factors of bumble
   bee decline is lacking. Here, we report results of a 3-y
   interdisciplinary study of changing distributions, population genetic
   structure, and levels of pathogen infection in bumble bee populations
   across the United States. We compare current and historical
   distributions of eight species, compiling a database of >73,000 museum
   records for comparison with data from intensive nationwide surveys of
   >16,000 specimens. We show that the relative abundances of four species
   have declined by up to 96\% and that their surveyed geographic ranges
   have contracted by 23-87\%, some within the last 20 y. We also show that
   declining populations have significantly higher infection levels of the
   microsporidian pathogen Nosema bombi and lower genetic diversity
   compared with co-occurring populations of the stable (nondeclining)
   species. Higher pathogen prevalence and reduced genetic diversity are,
   thus, realistic predictors of these alarming patterns of decline in
   North America, although cause and effect remain uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{Stachytarpheta jamaicensis is a seasonal shrub which produces flowers
   for a lengthy period during rainy and winter seasons. The floral
   characteristics such as bluish-violet flowers, no perceptible smell,
   narrow tubular corolla and concealed nectar accumulated at the corolla
   base conform to `psychophilous pollination syndrome'. The aggregated
   arrangement of flowers on the inflorescence is economical and
   energetically rewarding for the butterflies. The lower lip of the
   corolla is elaborate and provides comfortable landing place for the
   butterflies. The nectar is sucrose-rich with 28\% sugar concentration
   and also carbohydrate-rich with little protein content. It is also an
   important source of five of the ten essential amino acids required by
   butterflies; they include isoleucine, valine, lysine, methionine and
   threonine. Further, it also contains the non-essential amino acids such
   as alanine, butyric acid, cystine, glutamic acid, glysine,
   hydroxyproline, proline, serine, aspartic acid and cysteine. With these
   floral morphological and functional characteristics, the plant is
   exclusively pollinated by butterflies. Among butterflies, nymphalids and
   pierids are relatively more diverse in species and consistent foragers
   than papilionids and hesperiids. Therefore, the interaction between S.
   jamaicensis and the butterflies is mutualistic; the former for
   pollination and the latter for nourishment. This floral source is
   available for a long period and hence is an important nectar source for
   the maintenance of local butterflies. Additionally, bees also visit the
   flowers for forage and their visits could contribute to gene flow at
   population level to some extent.
   S. jamaicensis produces fruits with minute seeds within a short span of
   time. Seed dispersal occurs through soil and water movement. They
   germinate immediately if the soil is sufficiently wet; if not, they
   remain dormant until the soil is charged with water during monsoon
   season. The plant with abundant seed production enjoys a `minor weed'
   status only.}},

Abstract = {{Community assembly models, usually constructed for food webs, are an
   important component of our understanding of how ecological communities
   are formed. However, models for mutualistic community assembly are still
   needed, especially because these communities are experiencing
   significant anthropogenic disturbances that affect their biodiversity.
   Here, we present a unique network model that simulates the colonization
   and extinction process of mutualistic community assembly. We generate
   regional source pools of species interaction networks on the basis of
   statistical properties reported in the literature. We develop a dynamic
   synchronous Boolean framework to simulate, with few free parameters, the
   dynamics of new mutualistic community formation from the regional source
   pool. This approach allows us to deterministically map out every
   possible trajectory of community formation. This level of detail is
   rarely observed in other analytic approaches and allows for thorough
   analysis of the dynamical properties of community formation. As for food
   web assembly, we find that the number of stable communities is quite
   low, and the composition of the source pool influences the abundance and
   nature of community outcomes. However, in contrast to food web assembly,
   stable mutualistic communities form rapidly. Small communities with
   minor fluctuations in species presence/absence (self-similar limit
   cycles) are the most common community outcome. The unique application of
   this Boolean network approach to the study of mutualistic community
   assembly offers a great opportunity to improve our understanding of
   these critical communities.}},

Abstract = {{Bignoniaceous woody species are very important ecological components of
   neotropical forests, but the reproductive biology of many species, such
   as Cybistax antisyphilitica, remains virtually unknown. Most species of
   Bignoniaceae are characteristically self-sterile, despite typically
   exhibiting normal pollen tube growth throughout the style, combined with
   slow rates of ovule penetration, fertilisation and endosperm initiation
   in selfed pistils. Uniform abortion occurs within a few days of
   anthesis, indicating the occurrence of late-acting self-incompatibility
   (LSI). However, breeding system studies have been performed in fewer
   than 7\% of species, and other types of breeding systems (e.g.,
   self-compatibility and apomixis) have been reported in this family. In
   the present study, the reproductive biology of C. antisyphilitica was
   investigated by field observation of flower visitors and floral events.
   Moreover, reproductive biology of this species was examined through
   experimental pollinations, analyses of pollen tube growth and ovule
   penetration using fluorescence microscopy, verification of pistil
   longevity, and a histological analysis of unpollinated vs.
   self-pollinated pistils. Finally, morphological aspects, quantities and
   germination were investigated in seeds that resulted from different
   pollination treatments. Natural pollination was effected by large-and
   medium-sized bees, and their visiting behaviour favours a high
   proportion of geitonogamy and no pollen limitation. Self-pollinated
   flowers produced no fruits, and all of the characteristic
   post-pollination events cited above were verified, witnessing the
   occurrence of LSI with post-zygotic rejection of selfed pistils in C.
   antisyphilitica. Although some indications of extended pistil longevity
   were found in selfed pistils, this feature seemed to be affected by
   unidentified environmental factors. The seeds were always monoembryonic
   and with high viability. A larger variation in the number of viable
   seeds was found in fruits derived from natural pollination. A low fruit
   set was observed after both natural and cross-pollination, and most
   crossed fruits underwent abortion at several points during the juvenile
   phase, even when protected against herbivory. The formation of surplus
   flowers/juvenile fruits and the apparently wasteful selfing mechanism
   control implied in LSI are discussed in the context of the perennial
   life style of tropical woody plant species. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Cytogenetic analysis of the Amazon stingless bee Melipona seminigra

Abstract = {{We studied the syrphid fauna of a Mediterranean scrub community near
   Athens, Greece. Collecting was carried out systematically using an
   entomological net for flower-visiting insects (4-year survey: 1983-1987)
   and a Malaise trap for passive collection (2-year survey: 1991-1993). A
   total of 59 species were collected by both methods combined. Twenty-six
   species have a Mediterranean distribution and another 27 a European to
   worldwide distribution. Among the Mediterranean species one is new to
   science and another one new to Greece. There was a strong year-to-year
   variation in the number of hoverfly species recorded, a finding that was
   detectable in both surveys/methods considered independently. Neither of
   the collecting methods yielded 100\% of the total hoverfly fauna and
   55.9\% of the species were caught by one method only (19 species by net
   and 14 by Malaise trap). This may be due partly to the strong interyear
   variation in hoverfly phenology as well as to the differential
   efficiency of the entomological net vs. Malaise trap in catching
   hoverflies. We conclude that in order to draw a complete species list of
   an area both collecting methods should be combined. A comparison with
   the hoverfly fauna of five well-studied East Mediterranean areas showed
   that the study area enjoys a higher contribution of Mediterranean
   hoverfly species vs. other East Mediterranean areas located at higher
   latitudes, viz. Thessaly (C. Greece) and Morinj (Montenegro). Still, the
   high contribution of non-Mediterranean species (viz. 54\%) indicates
   that a large proportion of the hoverfly fauna originates from other
   habitats both present to date (e.g. surrounding the study site) or
   pre-existed in the area (e.g. disappeared forests).}},

   for bee managers. Megachile rotundata are solitary yet gregarious bees
   that nest in pre-existing cavities and are attracted to previously used
   nests. Nest cells contain several components that may serve as cues for
   nesting females. In the current study, we sought to: 1. determine if
   there is a preference for cells that previously held male or female
   conspecific bees; 2. verify attraction to conspecific whole nest cells;
   and 3. determine which individual nest components of a cell are
   attractive to nesting females. In a series of cage and open field
   experiments, M. rotundata females were allowed to initiate nests in
   blocks containing whole cells or individual cell components from old
   nests. Statistical analyses of results verified the attraction to
   conspecific nest cells, with no preference for male or female cells.
   Females were equally attracted to whole cells from conspecifics and from
   another megachilid bee, Osmia lignaria. In field cages, females were
   equally attracted to all cell components, but preferred some cell
   components over others in open field experiments. These results provide
   a foundation for future studies to identify potential chemical lures to

   temperate areas of western Mexico, where there is much interest in
   exploiting it for honey production and crop pollination. It is not
   known, however, if colonies of this species would adapt to hives
   necessary for commercial exploitation. Twenty four colonies were
   transferred to trunks and wooden boxes having walls with one of two
   thicknesses (2.5 and 10.0 cm). The internal and ambient temperature and
   humidity were monitored for three months during winter, at the end of
   which, the brood cell numbers, number of adults, and nest weights were
   assessed. There were differences in temperature (F-1 = 69.32; F-2 =
   1769.33; DF = 3, 56; P < 0.05) and humidity (F-1 = 397.15; F-2 =

   temperatures compared with the other two. There was a decrease in the

   a lowest development occurred in thin-walled boxes, probably due to

Title = {{The importance of bees as pollinators in the short corolla bromeliad
   Aechmea caudata in southern Brazil}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{206}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{749-756}},
Abstract = {{The majority of bromeliad species are pollinated by vertebrates, mainly
   hummingbirds and bats. However, bees are among the most frequent
   visitors in some short-corolla species with ornithophilous features, but
   only few studies identified insects as pollinators of these bromeliads.
   The importance of visitors for pollination success in Aechmea caudata
   (Bromeliaceae) was determined through the frequency and pollination
   effectiveness (measured as seed set/single visit) of its visitors in a
   secondary Atlantic forest area in southern Brazil. Aechmea caudata is
   self-incompatible and therefore pollinator-dependent. A total of 16
   species were recorded visiting their flowers. Bees were the most rich
   and frequent taxon (91\% of 647 visits). Bombus mono was the most
   frequent species (41\%). Although the floral features of A. caudata,
   such as scentless, tubular corollas, yellow and red flowers, and nectar
   secretion during the whole diurnal anthesis, are related to
   ornithophily, the single hummingbird species Thalurania glaucopis failed
   to pollinate the flowers. Its low frequency (2.5\%)apparently did not
   promote the pollen flux between conspecific bromeliads. Pollination
   tests showed that no seeds developed after hummingbird visits. Seeds
   were formed only at flowers visited by B. monk). We discuss our findings
   by contrasting them with the results on the similar and sympatric A.
   lindenii and by emphasizing the importance of bees for pollination of
   bromeliads with short corolla. Our results show that pollination
   effectiveness together with frequency data are necessary to analyze the
   complex interactions between plants and their flower visitors. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Although most plants benefit from pollen vectors, very little
   information exists about how plant diversity structures the interactions
   between plants and their flower visitors. The structure of such
   interaction webs holds information about specialization and
   effectiveness of flower visitors in flower resource use. Here, we
   analyzed 52 plant-flower visitor interaction webs along a gradient of
   experimentally manipulated plant species richness in a European
   grassland. The gradient allows testing for effects of the number of
   flowering plant species per se. Linkage density and interaction
   diversity between flowering plant species and their visiting insect
   species increased with higher richness of flowering species. Increased
   interaction diversity led to smaller temporal variability in the
   frequency of flower visits. These results suggest higher temporal
   stability of pollination provided for plants integrated in complex
   interaction webs with a high number of flowering plant species.
   Flower resource specialization of solitary bees, but not of honey and
   bumble bees, increased with increasing flowering plant species richness.
   Conservation of diverse grasslands can result in high flower
   specialization and may promote effectiveness of pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of natural habitats to human settlements creates an
   alternative habitat with different bio-physical characteristics such as
   micro-climatic conditions and resource availability. Deserts are
   especially sensitive to such effects due to generally low nutrient
   levels and water availability. Gardens in human settlements in the
   desert are often a main source of alien plant species that provide ample
   foraging resources year round. These changes in floral composition and
   availability may alter pollinator community composition and foraging
   behaviour, as well as pollination network characteristics. We
   investigated the effects of desert gardening on pollinator communities
   and pollination networks in the Jordan Rift Valley (Israel), an arid
   agro-natural landscape south of the Dead Sea. We studied seasonal
   diversity patterns of plants and wild bees in natural habitats and in
   gardens in settlements. Wild bees and blooming plants were sampled from
   February to July in 2007 and in 2008. We constructed plant pollinator
   networks and compared bee communities between the two habitat types
   along the season. We found that bee abundance was greater in the
   gardens, and that rarefied bee species richness was greater in the
   natural habitat. Bee species richness and abundance exhibited
   contrasting seasonal patterns between habitats. Bee community
   composition also differed greatly between habitats, and species in the
   gardens had a generally wider geographical range in comparison to
   species in the natural habitat. We also found a higher level of
   generalisation of the pollination network in the gardens compared to the
   natural habitat, which may indicate a response to a disturbed and
   unstable environment. We conclude that gardening in deserts although
   promoting overall bee abundance, negatively affects species richness and
   changes community composition and network characteristics, with possible
   implications on the composition of native flora in the natural habitat
   surrounding the gardens.}},

Abstract = {{Urban ecosystems pose different environmental constraints on plant and
   animal communities than natural ecosystems, and this in turn might
   affect ecological interactions. We investigated plant pollinator
   interactions in urban vegetation communities in the context of local
   community structure and two landscape metrics describing the surrounding
   urban matrix. We recorded plant species diversity, floral density,
   pollinator species and floral visits at 89 flowering patches within the
   urban matrix, and used Trifolium pratense as a focal plant species.
   We correlated visits by all species, by bees, by bees when excluding the
   main visitor Bombus pascuorum, and by the main visitor alone T. pratense
   with the landscape metrics ``green area{''}, representing the total
   extent of vegetated areas, and ``edge density of green areas{''},
   representing the degree of habitat fragmentation, at scales from 20 to
   200 m. Extent of green area was positively correlated with visits by all
   species, by bees, and by Bombus pascuorum, but negatively with bees
   excluding the main visitor. The correlation increased with scale for all
   four variables, and the strongest correlations were found for B.
   pascuorum. The direction of correlation between edge density and the
   visitation variables was similar as for green area, but showed
   considerable variation at scales below 100 m radius.
   Visits by all bees and all visitors to T. pratense were negatively
   affected by flowering plant species diversity. There was a positive
   interaction between extent of green area and plant diversity on bee
   visitation, and a negative interaction between the extent of green area
   and heterospecific flowers for bees (excluding B. pascuorum). Increasing
   floral abundance and plant diversity reduced pollinator visitation to T.
   pro tense, suggesting competitive effects through both quantity and
   diversity of resources. Competition for flower visitors was mainly from
   Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens, both of which frequently
   co-occurred with T. pratense.
   We conclude that T. pratense competes for pollinators with other
   co-occurring plants, but that the nature of the surrounding urban matrix
   mediates interactions among plant species for pollinator services at
   different scales, particularly with respect to the proportion of green
   areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{206}},

Abstract = {{Seven species from five genera of Annonaceae were studied with regard to
   their flower biology and pollination in the Southwest Province of
   Cameroon, West Africa. They have protogynous hermaphroditic flowers,
   with exception of Uvariopsis species, which are monoecious. Fused petals
   of Isolona campanulata remain apically spreading and open during
   anthesis but form a deep basal urceolate tube around the reproductive
   organs. At anthesis the yellow pendent flowers emit a fruit-like scent
   and attracted small beetles, the likely pollinators. Piptostigma sp.
   flowers also emit a fruit-like scent but provide a closed pollination
   chamber formed by the three inner petals. Small staphylinid beetles
   attracted during the female stage of anthesis are released from the
   flowers at the end of the male stage 2-3 days later. Both species have
   diurnal anthesis, attracting and releasing the flower visitors during
   daytime. In contrast, Uvariodendron con nivens and U. calophyllum have
   nocturnal anthesis with floral thermogenesis, produce spicy, aromatic
   and fruity scents and attract large Scarabaeidae beetles, the
   pollinators, along with many curculionid beetles, which were principally
   predators of the thick petals. The very large flowers of Monodora
   tenuifolia have yellowish petals which are spotted with dark red
   markings. Together with the sweetish, slightly disagreeable scent the
   flowers attract flies, principally dung flies. The two investigated
   Uvariopsis species are monoecious with pistillate and staminate flowers
   being functional at the same time. The violet red flowers of U.
   bakeriana visually seem to mimic the fruiting body of certain stinkhorn
   fungi (Phallaceae) although without producing their strong unpleasant
   carcass stench. Flower-visiting dung flies were rare. Conversely, U.
   congolana has a strong fungus-like scent, its flowers are presented at
   litter height and dung flies living in the litter were the flower
   visitors, albeit sporadic. The 4-5 days lasting anthesis of both
   Uvariopsis species appears to be an evolutionary consequence of their
   diffuse pollinator spectra. The studied African Annonaceae therefore
   have either cantharophilous or myiophilous/sapromyiophilous flowers
   with, in part, respectively, remarkably long anthesis, thermogenesis,
   and widely open, large flowers - all attributes unknown or rare in the
   hitherto better studied Neotropical Annonaceae. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{Plant population size has been shown to affect insect visitation and

   are more likely to be affected by stochastic processes and inbreeding
   depression (Allee effect). Additionally, several studies have found that
   plants in small populations also experience lower pollinator visitation
   rates, which may further decrease reproduction. In this study, seed set,
   pollinator visitation and pollen limitation of Thymus capitatus (L.) was
   assessed in 32 patches in eight populations of various sizes on the
   island of Lesvos, Greece. All populations except one were significantly
   pollen-limited. We found that although free-pollinated flowers produced
   more seeds in larger populations this was not due to higher pollinator
   visitation rates as flowers which received pollen supplements also
   produced more seeds in larger populations. We hypothesize that the
   higher seed set is due to a generally greater genetic variability or
   better habitat quality. We show that honeybee visitation alone
   significantly decreases pollen limitation.}},

Abstract = {{The study of multi-modal communication has only recently been extended
   to innate and learned interactions between flowers and their animal
   visitors, and usually only to pollinators. Here we studied the relevance
   of floral scent and visual display of a night blooming, putatively
   hawkmoth-pollinated plant Oenothera acaulis (Onagraceae) in the
   attraction of non-native cockroaches Blatta orientalis (Blattodea:
   Blattidae), which function as facultative floral larcenists in coastal
   habitats of central Chile. We experimentally decoupled visual (corolla)
   and olfactory (fragrance) stimuli by presenting paper corollas and green
   mesh bags, with or without a freshly-picked natural flower inside. We
   then contrasted the behavioral responses of roaches in these treatments
   with those to the natural combination of traits in actual flowers and
   their respective control treatments, measuring the roaches' frequency of
   first visits, mean and total residence time spent in each treatment. The
   roaches primarily used olfactory cues when approaching O. acaulis
   flowers at two biologically relevant spatial scales. In addition, the
   presence of conspecific roaches had a strong influence on recruitment to
   the experimental arena, increasing the statistical differences among
   treatments. Our results suggest a primacy of floral fragrance over
   visual stimuli in the foraging responses of B. orientalis. Olfactory
   cues were necessary and sufficient to attract the roaches, and the
   visual cues presented in our manipulations only marginally increased
   their attraction within a 20 cm diameter of the stimulus. The full
   spectrum of floral visitation behavior was not elicited by the
   artificial flowers, suggesting the need for additional tactile or
   contact chemosensory stimuli not provided by paper. Although the
   nitrogenous scent compounds that we found in O. acaulis flowers are
   almost exclusively found in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers, the
   attractiveness of these compounds to a non-native, facultative
   flower-visiting insect indicates that they do not function as
   pollinator-specific signals for hawkmoth attraction {[}Current Zoology

Abstract = {{Flowers are multisensory displays used by plants to influence the
   behavior of pollinators. Although we know a great deal about how
   individual signal components are produced by plants and detected or
   learned by pollinators, very few experiments directly address the
   function of floral signal complexity, i.e. how the multicomponent nature
   of these signals benefits plant or pollinator. Yet, experimental
   psychology suggests that increasing complexity can enhance subjects'
   ability to detect, learn and remember stimuli, and the plant's
   reproductive success depends upon ensuring that pollinators learn their
   signals and so transport pollen to other similar (conspecific) flowers.
   Here we explore functional hypotheses for why plants invest in complex
   floral displays, focusing on hypotheses in which floral signals interact
   to promote pollinator learning and memory. Specifically, we discuss how
   an attention-altering or context-providing function of one signal may
   promote acquisition or recall of a second signal. Although we focus on
   communication between plants and pollinators, these process-based
   hypotheses should apply to any situation where a sender benefits from

   likely that B. dahlbomii interacts with these non-native bees.}},

Abstract = {{The cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus) is a dioecious plant growing in
   northern peatlands which produces a uniquely flavoured berry highly
   valued in Scandinavia and other northern regions. Pollination in the
   wild is accomplished mainly by flies. In most seasons pollination is
   insufficient leading to poor fruit set and fruit size. Honeybees have
   been used by cloudberry producers both in Norway and in Finland to
   increase cloudberry pollination. In a comparative study between four
   bogs supplied with two honeybee hives and four control bogs without
   honeybees in north-eastern Quebec, Canada, honeybees were shown to
   collect significant quantities of cloudberry pollen, and pollen loads,
   fruit set, seed set and cloudberry yields were all significantly
   increased in bogs with hives compared with those in the control bogs.}},

   EXAMPLES FROM THREE PENSTEMON (PLANTAGINACEAE) SPECIES IN THE GREAT
   BASIN}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{98}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study : Despite rapid growth in the field of landscape
   genetics, our understanding of how landscape features interact with life
   history traits to influence population genetic structure in plant
   species remains limited. Here, we identify population genetic divergence
   in three species of Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) similarly distributed
   throughout the Great Basin region of the western United States but with
   different pollination syndromes (bee and hummingbird). The Great Basin's
   mountainous landscape provides an ideal setting to compare the
   interaction of landscape and dispersal ability in isolating populations
   of different species.
   Methods : We used eight highly polymorphic microsatellite loci to
   identify neutral population genetic structure between populations within
   and among mountain ranges for eight populations of P. deustus, 10
   populations of P. pachyphyllus, and 10 populations of P. rostriflorus.
   We applied traditional population genetics approaches as well as spatial
   and landscape genetics approaches to infer genetic structure and
   discontinuities among populations.
   Key results : All three species had significant genetic structure and
   exhibited isolation by distance, ranging from high structure and low
   inferred gene flow in the bee-pollinated species P. deustus (F(ST) =
   0.1330, R(ST) = 0.4076, seven genetic clusters identified) and P.
   pachyphyllus (F(ST) = 0.1896, R(ST) = 0.2531, four genetic clusters
   identified) to much lower structure and higher inferred gene flow in the
   hummingbird-pollinated P. rostriflorus (F(ST) = 0.0638, R(ST) = 0.1116,
   three genetic clusters identified).
   Conclusions : These three Penstemon species have significant yet
   strikingly different patterns of population genetic structure, findings
   consistent with different interactions between landscape features and
   the dispersal capabilities of their pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) encompasses about 1000 species,
   approximately two thirds of which are in the New World. Bees and birds
   are known as pollinators, but a more detailed analysis of the pollinator
   groups is lacking. This paper presents a complete list of all currently
   accepted New World Salvia species and their classification according to
   their pollination syndromes, focusing particularly on bird-pollinated
   species. The concept of pollination syndromes is used and complemented
   by field investigations, morphometric measurements, and experiments to
   reconstruct the process of pollen transfer and to confirm the fitting or
   exclusion of a given pollinator group. Within the 602 New World Salvia
   species, 58\% are identified to be melittophilous (bee pollinated) awl
   31\% to be ornithophilous (bird pollinated). Salvia whitehousei Alziar
   is assumed to be psychophilous (butterfly pollinated/long-tongued fly
   pollinated). About 11\% of the species show characters of two or more
   syndromes and eight species are not assignable to any group.
   Bird-pollinated Salvia species occur from North America southward to
   Chile and Argentina. They usually grow as shrubs or perennial herbs
   (97\%) and have red flowers (at least 49\%) of an average size of 34 mm
   (7-130 mm). With respect to their floral diversity and phylogeny,
   parallel evolution is evident.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering progresses upward along vertical inflorescences in the
   protandrous dichogamous shrub Salvia hierosolymitana (Boiss.). Flowers'
   gender nectar production rates and their vertical distribution were
   recorded in two populations (northern and central Israel) over 3 years.
   Female-phase flowers produced significantly more nectar than male-phase
   flowers and were more abundant at the inflorescences' base. Thus, nectar
   availability gradually decreases along inflorescences. Female-biased
   nectar production can benefit plants by increasing pollinator visits to
   female-phase flowers, enhancing pollination success when pollen is
   scarce. In congruence with this hypothesis, the following observations
   suggest that pollen in S. hierosolymitana may be in short supply: (1)
   freshly dehisced anthers contained 40\% of sterile pollen; (2) pollen
   counts on female-phase stigmas were low (mean +/- s. e. 11.6 +/- 1.56);
   and (3) counts of germinated pollen tubes at the pistils' base were even
   lower (5.02 +/- 0.54). The nectar gradient along the inflorescence may
   also be adaptively beneficial in other aspects. Foraging insects that
   follow this gradient are expected to move from female-phase flowers near
   the inflorescences' base, to male-phase flowers closer to the top. Thus,
   reducing the risk of geitonogamy and promoting outcrossing while moving
   from male-phase flowers of one individual to female-phase flowers of

Pages = {{713-718}},
Abstract = {{Monttea aphylla is an aphyllus shrub abundant in the Monte Desert,
   Argentina. This species presents particular floral syndromes including
   violet, tubular flowers with trichome elaiophores that produce oil. Oil
   flowers are associated with specialised bees with an oil-collecting
   apparatus. To better understand the reproductive biology of M. aphylla,
   the mating system, flowering phenology, the associated pollinator
   assemblage and foraging behaviour was determined at the southernmost
   part of its distributional range. Results were compared with those of
   previous studies and discussed. At this southern location M. aphylla is
   a self-incompatible species; it relies on pollinators for fruit
   production and presented a low fruit set. Flowering occurred during the
   spring, from October to December. M. aphylla was pollinated by three
   species of bees (Apidae); two generalist species (Centris brethesi and
   Mesonychium jenseni) and one specialist to M. aphylla (Centris
   vardyorum). M. jenseni is a cleptoparasite of Centris species. Centris
   species are oil-collecting bees and showed territorial behaviour (i.e.
   they always visited a restricted group of plants which they protected
   from other visitors), they visited several flowers/plants, which
   enhanced geitonogamous self-pollination and reduced pollination
   efficiency, and which might explain the low natural fruit set observed
   in M. aphylla. C. vardyorum was the most important pollinator of M.
   aphylla in the study area. The reproductive biology of M. aphylla
   differs along its distributional range. Apparently, southern populations
   of M. aphylla are more specialised than the northern populations, the
   former being pollinated by a few related pollinator species whereas at
   the northern location a variety of visitors were observed.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{292-299}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between resource availability and biodiversity of
   consumers has gained particular attention with the increasing loss of
   biodiversity. We evaluated resource availability on meadows of low
   intensity (low/unfertilised, mown once or twice per year) and meadows of
   high-intensity land use (high fertilisation, mown twice or thrice)
   before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation,
   species richness and composition of flower visitors.
   We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low
   intensity and one meadow of high-intensity land use. Each survey yielded
   a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found
   during 6 h in an area of 1000 m(2).
   In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species.
   Species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably
   between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43\% in
   plants and 42\% in flower visitors. Complementary specialisation of
   flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less
   specialised than beetles and butterflies, and bees had the highest
   degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows
   of low-intensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant,
   bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plant flower visitor
   interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of
   butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land use. However, later in
   the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant
   species richness, being higher on meadows of low-intensity land use.
   We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from
   differences in grassland management may alter plant flower visitor
   interactions. Moreover, an impoverishment of flower diversity has
   stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised
   flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors.}},

Pages = {{332-341}},
Abstract = {{Alien plants form important interactions with flower visitors across
   many systems and are especially likely to dominate these interactions in
   disturbed habitats where native plants are rare. Most studies of alien
   plant-pollinator interactions have focused on the effects of alien
   plants on native plant reproduction; however, these alien plants may
   also be important food resources for native bees especially if they
   dominate the ``floral market{''}. Dominance of alien species in the diet
   of bees could occur due to high relative density and abundance of alien
   plants and flowers, and/or to bee preference for alien plants when they
   are present. We investigated bees' use of and preference for alien
   plants using two data sets from distinct regions of North America,
   central California and southern New Jersey. In each system, we sampled
   bees and flowering plants in multiple habitat types that differ in level
   of disturbance and in the relative abundance of alien plant species.
   Alien plants as a group dominated interactions with bee communities in
   more disturbed habitats. Importance, however, varied among plant species
   such that a subset of highly used plant species drove the overall
   pattern of use within the community. Despite higher use of alien plants
   in more disturbed sites, alien plants as a group were not more
   preferred. Rather, bees' use of individual alien plants correlated with
   plant abundance in the community. Consistent with the interpretation
   that bees use, but do not prefer, alien plants, we found no effect of
   alien plant abundance or richness on bee abundance or richness.}},

   significant, positive effect on seed production of P. flextiosa. No

Abstract = {{On June 16 and 17,2010, data were collected on pollination in a
   population of Galearis rotundifolia at the confluence of the Maligne and
   Athabasca Rivers north of Jasper, Alberta. The primary pollinator was
   the bee Osmia pro:aura and this species was also the most frequent
   visitor. While most flies were visitors, four species, Eriozona
   (Megasyrphus) laxus, Eristalis (Eoseristalis) hirta, Eristalis
   (Eoseristalis) rupium, and Eupeodes (Lapposyrphus) lapponicus also
   served as pollinators. It is estimated that 25-44\% or more of flowers
   were pollinated in the previous year, a relatively high percentage that
   supports the ``advertisement model{''} for evolution of food deception
   in orchids. The pollinating bee or fly lands on the lip and probes the
   spur which is approximately the same length or longer than the tongue.
   In the process of pushing into the flower and backing out, the sticky
   contents of a bursicle are either discharged by the backward movement of
   a flap or by forward pressure. Either of these actions may release
   adhesive fluid which fixes the viscidia onto the front of the insect's
   head. The gradual bending forward of the caudicles reduces likelihood of
   pollination of consecutively visited flowers with pollen from those
   recently visited flowers on the same plant (geitonogamous pollination)
   and thus promotes outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{Most rare species appear to be specialists in plant-pollinator networks.
   This observation could result either from real ecological processes or

   remain undersampled. We propose the analysis of food composition in bee

   estimates. We compared data from a plant-pollinator network in the Monte
   Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Argentina, sampled by visit
   observation, and data from trap nests sampled at the same time and
   location. Our study shows that trap nest sampling was good for
   estimating rare species degree. The rare species in the networks appear
   to be more specialized than they really are, and the bias in the
   estimation of the species degree increases with the rareness. The low

   on Santa Catarina Island, southern Brazil. Flowering extends from
   October to February, the anthesis is diurnal. We found the reproductive
   system to be partially autogamous without the possibility of
   intra-floral selfing. Therefore the bromeliad is pollinator-dependent,
   but the flowers do not need to be cross-pollinated. Mean nectar sugar
   concentration was 20.7\% with a high sucrose proportion. Flowers
   secreted 73.9 mu l nectar per day. Although the flowers show
   ornithophilous features like tubular and scentless flowers and higher
   energetic nectar in the morning hours, besides two hummingbird species
   we recorded 28 species of insects and spiders also associated with the
   flowers of V friburgensis. Species richness of flower visitors was
   higher in restinga than in secondary forest. In both habitat types
   hummingbirds and bees were the most frequent visitor groups, but whereas
   hummingbirds were the most frequent animals visiting flowers in
   secondary forest, followed by bees, the opposite was the case in the
   restinga habitats. Because friburgensis is partially autogamous, small
   bees might also be pollinators, transferring self-pollen. Thus, there is
   redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees,
   leading to a high probability of successful reproduction in this

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation often leads to small and isolated plant
   populations as well as decreased habitat quality. These processes can
   fundamentally disrupt the interactions between plants and pollinators
   and decrease reproductive success. This concerns especially
   self-incompatible, non-clonal species that depend on pollination for
   successful reproduction.
   In two rare and endangered heathland plant species, Genista anglica and
   G. pilosa, we examined pollination and reproduction in relation to
   population size. Eight populations of G. anglica and ten populations of
   G. pilosa were surveyed in the vicinity of Bremen, NW-Germany. We
   counted the visits of pollinators (honeybees, bumblebees, and other
   insects) and determined the reproductive output of the observed shoots.
   Contrary to our expectation to find increased pollinator visitation
   rates in larger populations of both Genista species, the number of
   flower-visiting insects was unrelated to the number of flowering shoots.
   Increasing shoot length had a positive and increasing temperature a
   negative impact on the number of visiting honeybees and bumblebees.
   Despite the general absence of population size effects on pollinator
   numbers, the number of fruits and seeds in G. anglica increased with
   increasing population size. Fruit and seed set in G. pilosa were
   negatively related to the number of `other insects'. Our field
   observations showed that larger populations of both Genista species
   flowered earlier than smaller populations and much earlier than reported
   in the literature. Flowering in large populations therefore tends to
   coincide less well with pollinator abundance, and this may cause a
   disruption of the temporal coincidence between flowering phenology and
   pollinator activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Floral color changes are common among Melastomataceae and have been

   compatible. The flowers lasted three days or more, and the floral color
   changed from white in the 1st day to pink in the following days. Pollen
   deposition on stigma induced floral color change. The effectiveness of
   the pollination is dependent on bees' size; only large bees were

Abstract = {{Pollinators are able to discriminate among different floral phenotypes.
   Thus, flowers more attractive to pollinators usually receive more visits
   to their reproductive structures. However, this effect of attraction
   does not necessarily occur in a binary way, all-or-nothing. Loasa
   tricolor KerGawl. is an annual herb covered with stinging hairs. Flowers
   present a corolla with five yellow petals and red nectarine scales. In
   this study, we assess whether the variation in the floral phenotype of
   L. tricolor affects discrimination by pollinators, following a
   dose-dependent type of response. This study was carried out in a
   protected area of Chile where L. tricolor shows high levels of
   florivory, probably affecting its attraction to pollinators. We
   experimentally modified the corolla phenotype, removing three or all
   petals. We measured visitation rate, richness and diversity of
   pollinator species in treated and control flowers. Results show that
   three-petal-removal did not reduce the visitation rate compared to
   control, while complete-petal-removal significantly reduced the
   visitation rate. Most pollinator species were recorded in the
   three-petal-removal treatment (nine species), while
   complete-petal-removal treatment obtained the lowest richness value
   (four species). These results suggest that species diversity, richness
   and visitation rates are affected by flower phenotype variation, but
   probably for complete petal loss only. We suggest that different levels
   of florivory on L. tricolor do not affect pollinator discrimination in a
   dose-dependent way.}},

Abstract = {{Solanum lycocarpum (Solanaceae) is a woody species found in the
   Brazilian Cerrado. The flowers are pollinated by Xylocopa spp bees, and
   seeds are dispersed by mammals with distinct home range sizes. As a
   consequence, relative contributions of pollen and seeds to overall gene
   flow can vary according to different spatial scales. We studied the
   genetic structure of four natural populations of S. lycocarpum separated
   by 19 to 128 km, including individuals located along dirt roads that
   interlink three of the populations. A total of 294 individuals were
   genotyped with five nuclear and six chloroplast microsatellite markers.
   Significant spatial genetic structure was found in the total set of
   individuals; the Sp statistic was 0.0086. Population differentiation
   based on the six chloroplast microsatellite markers (theta(pC) = 0.042)
   was small and similar to that based on the five nuclear microsatellite
   markers (theta(p) = 0.054). For this set of populations, pollen and seed
   flow did not differ significantly from one another (pollen-to-seed flow
   ratio = 1.22). Capability for long distance seed dispersion and
   colonization of anthropogenic sites contributes to the ability of S.
   lycocarpum to maintain genetic diversity. Seed dispersion along dirt

Abstract = {{Rhododendron aureum is a weakly self-compatible alpine shrub pollinated

   differed between queen bumblebees and workers. Queens exhibited less
   frequent flower visits, longer flight distances between inflorescences,

   than did worker bees. Flowering in early-snowmelt populations occurred
   in June, when only overwintered queens were available, while flowering
   in late-snowmelt populations occurred from late July to August, when
   frequent visits by workers were common. The fruit to flower ratio per
   inflorescence was lower in early-snowmelt populations due to
   quantitative pollen limitation, while the seed to ovule ratio per fruit
   was lower in late-snowmelt populations. This is because geitonogamous
   pollination by workers was common later in the season, which resulted in
   a high abortion rate of self-pollinated seeds, that is, qualitative
   pollen limitation. Thus, pollination efficiency, or the type of pollen
   limitation, shifts during the flowering season, reflecting the seasonal
   life cycle of bumblebees in the ecosystem. Many of the self-fertilized
   seeds aborted due to high inbreeding depression, and the outcrossing

Abstract = {{One of the practical aspects of mason bee rearing is the need to
   synchronize bee activity with the flowering period of the target

   effect of reducing the duration of diapause of both males and females on
   insemination. Individuals activated earlier might, after mating and
   consequent nesting, be used in greenhouses for pollinating crops.
   Successful insemination is the prerequisite for obtaining a new
   generation. Therefore, there is a possibility that red mason bee females
   activated earlier in winter could give rise to two generations of
   offspring a year.
   Groups of red mason bees - 30 males and 30 females (in 3 replications)
   had diapause terminated in different months. After being removed from
   cocoons, they were placed in plexiglass isolation cages and kept in the
   laboratory with appropriate feeding and light conditions. After 14 days,
   the females were removed and killed, and the filling of their
   spermatheca was examined. Diapause was terminated in the first ten days
   of each November to March, and in April which is the month of the red
   mason bee's natural emergence and copulation time. The percentages of
   dead females to live (analysed) females and successfully inseminated to
   analysed females were compared with Chi-square contingency tests
   (procedure `prop.test' from R package).
   Termination months differed significantly for both mortality and the
   successful insemination of Osmia rufa. Compared with natural activation

   January, as differences in both mortality and insemination were not
   significantly different between these two months.}},

Abstract = {{Plants often attract pollinators with floral displays composed of
   visual, olfactory, tactile and gustatory stimuli. Since pollinators'
   responses to each of these stimuli are usually studied independently,
   the question of why plants produce multi-component floral displays
   remains relatively unexplored. Here we used signal detection theory to
   test the hypothesis that complex displays reduce a pollinator's
   uncertainty about the floral signal. Specifically, we asked whether one
   component of the floral display, scent, improved a bee's certainty about
   the value of another component, color hue. We first trained two groups
   of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) to discriminate between
   rewarding and unrewarding artificial flowers of slightly different hues
   in the presence vs absence of scent. In a test phase, we presented these
   bees with a gradient of floral hues and assessed their ability to
   identify the hue rewarded during training. We interpreted the extent to
   which bees' preferences were biased away from the unrewarding hue ('peak
   shift') as an indicator of uncertainty in color discrimination. Our data
   show that the presence of an olfactory signal reduces uncertainty
   regarding color: not only was color learning facilitated on scented
   flowers but also bees showed a lower amount of peak shift in the
   presence of scent. We explore potential mechanisms by which scent might
   reduce uncertainty about color, and discuss the broader significance of
   our results for our understanding of signal evolution.}},

   the radiation of land plants, yet only a handful are known and the trait
   shifts required are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that a
   transition to insect pollination took place in the ancestrally
   wind-pollinated sedges (Cyperaceae) and that floral traits modified
   during this transition have functional significance.
   We paired putatively insect-pollinated Cyperus obtusiflorus and Cyperus
   sphaerocephalus with related, co-flowering, co-occurring wind-pollinated
   species, and compared pairs in terms of pollination mode and functional
   roles of floral traits.
   Experimentally excluding insects reduced seed set by 56-89\% in
   putatively insect-pollinated species but not in intermingled
   wind-pollinated species. The pollen of putatively insect-pollinated
   species was less motile in a wind tunnel than that of wind-pollinated
   species. Bees, beetles and flies preferred inflorescences, and
   color-matched white or yellow models, of putatively insect-pollinated
   species over inflorescences, or color-matched brown models, of
   wind-pollinated species. Floral scents of putatively insect-pollinated
   species were chemically consistent with those of other insect-pollinated
   plants, and attracted pollinators; wind-pollinated species were
   unscented.
   These results show that a transition from wind pollination to insect
   pollination occurred in sedges and shed new light on the function of
   traits involved in this important transition.}},

Abstract = {{The duration of sexual phases in dichogamous plants are affected by many
   factors. Using both experimental and observational studies, we
   investigated natural patterns of pollen removal and deposition, visiting
   frequency of pollinators, patterns of nectar secretion, and effects of
   pollen removal and stigmatic pollen deposition on the duration of sexual
   phases in a protandrous plant, Glechoma longituba. We found that
   visiting frequency of pollinators correlated with the nectar secretion
   pattern. The nectar volume during the male phase was higher than during
   the female phase. In the morning, the main pollinator, the bee
   Anthophora plumipes, mainly foraged for nectar and showed no preference
   for flowers in male or female phase, despite male phase flowers
   producing higher amounts of nectar. However, in the afternoon, they
   changed their behavior and foraged mainly for pollen, and then showed a
   preference for flowers in male phase. Furthermore, the rates of pollen
   removal and stigmatic pollen deposition can affect the starting time and
   the duration of the female phase. When pollen removal and pollination
   rates are low due to scarcity of pollinator services, the sexual phase
   can be prolonged, leading to an overlap, and thereby enhance the chance
   for sexual reproduction through pollinator-facilitated self-pollination.
   We consider the variation of sexual phases in Glechoma longituba an
   adaptive mechanism prepared for both cross-pollination enhancement and
   reproductive assurance depending on the available pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat modification and human-induced climate change are having a
   severe impact on ecosystems. Plant-insect interactions in particular
   might become disrupted due to species-specific responses of plants and
   insects towards these changes. We investigated how environmental change
   affects flower visitation and pollination with a field study simulating
   pollinator habitat loss (distance to semi-natural habitat), phenological
   shift (anticipated flowering) and environmentally induced growth
   (enhanced flower height). We established 16 habitat islands of potted
   plants of Sinapis arvensis L., recorded all flower visitors (mainly
   bees, flies and pollen beetles) and quantified the seed set.
   Experimentally elevated flowers were less often visited by flies, while
   visitation by bees was not affected. Further, plants distant from
   calcareous grassland were less often visited by bees but visitation by
   flies did not decrease. Anticipated flowering reduced the number of both
   pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles and increased the
   reproductive success (seeds per plant) of S. arvensis, showing that the
   loss of mutualists was compensated by an escape from antagonists. During
   the natural flowering period more seeds were produced close to
   grasslands, especially by plants of natural height, presumably due to
   the higher bee visitation rate. However, seed production appeared to be
   relatively tolerant to multiple environmental changes due to
   complementary patterns among the different flower visitor guilds. Our
   results suggest complex interactions of environmental change with
   responses of mutualists and antagonists, making general predictions

Abstract = {{Enantiostyly (mirror-image flowers) is usually associated with buzz
   pollination. In buzz-pollinated flowers, pollen is released through
   terminal pores after bees vibrate the stamens. Several studies have
   evaluated the function of `buzzing' in pollen release, but less
   attention has been paid to the effect of buzzing on pollen capture and
   deposition on stigmas. Evaluating the mechanism of pollen dispersion in
   buzz-pollinated flowers is important because it may affect mating
   patterns and reproductive success. In this study, we analysed the
   morphology of sexual organs (anther and stigma) using electron
   microscopy, and determined the relationship between sexual organ
   structure and pollen capture function through experimental manipulations
   of buzz-pollinated flowers of Chamaecrista chamaecristoides, as well as
   vibration frequencies on floral visitors. Pollen release occurs through
   two terminal pores at the tip of the stamens. However, unlike most
   angiosperms that have their stigmatic surface exposed, C.
   chamaecristoides presents a stigmatic surface inside a cavity covered by
   trichomes. Experimental manipulations showed that effective
   fertilisation is only achieved when the style is vibrated, suggesting
   that buzzing is not only important for pollen release but also for
   pollen capture and deposition on the stigma. This result, in addition to
   vibration frequency analysis, suggests that although all floral visitors
   buzz flowers only those that buzz at higher frequencies achieve
   effective fertilisation. The anatomical features of sexual organs in
   flowers of C. chamaecristoides demonstrate that this species possesses a
   highly specialised, elaborate morphology, with both genders selected for
   traits that promote buzz pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyse the reproductive biology of
   Echinopsis terscheckii, a species endemic to northwest Argentina that
   has nocturnal flowers. We expected that this species had a generalised
   pollination system, with moths and diurnal visitors as the primary
   pollinators. To test this, we studied the floral biology, breeding
   system and floral visitors of this species and the effectiveness of
   nocturnal and diurnal visitors. Floral biology was defined based on
   floral morphology, floral cycle and nectar production of the flowers.
   The breeding system and relative contributions of diurnal and nocturnal
   visitors to fruit and seed set were analysed through field experiments.
   E. terscheckii flowers opened at sunset and closed the following day.
   The peak of nectar production occurred at midnight. Flowers were
   determined to be self-incompatible. Moths, bees and birds were
   identified as floral visitors. Moths were the most frequent visitors at
   night, whereas bees were the most frequent visitors during the day.
   Fruit production by diurnal pollinators was less than that by nocturnal
   pollinators; among all floral visitors, moths were the most effective
   pollinators. We have demonstrated for the first time that moths are the
   primary pollinators of columnar cacti of the genus Echinopsis. Our
   results suggest that moths might be important pollinators of columnar
   cactus species with nocturnal flowers in the extra-tropical deserts of

Abstract = {{In order to compare the effectiveness of birds and insects as
   pollinators, we studied the floral biology of the bromeliad Aechmea
   nudicaulis (L.) Grisebach in the biome of the Atlantic rain forest,
   southern Brazil. On Santa Catarina Island, flowering extends from
   mid-September to the end of December, with diurnal anthesis. The
   reproductive system is obligatory xenogamy, thus pollinator-dependent.
   Flowers secrete 31.84 mu l of nectar per day, with a mean sugar
   concentration of 23.2\%. Highest nectar volume and sugar concentration
   occur at the beginning of anthesis. Most floral traits are
   characteristic for ornithophily, and nectar production appears to be
   adapted to the energy demand of hummingbirds. Continued secretion of the
   sucrose-dominated nectar attracts and binds visitors to inflorescences,
   strengthening trapline foraging behaviour. Experiments assessing seed
   set after single flower visits were performed with the most frequent
   visitors, revealing the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis as the most
   effective pollen vector. In addition, bees are also functional
   pollinators, as substantiated by their high visitation frequency. We
   conclude that this pollination system is bimodal. Thus, there is
   redundancy in the pollination service provided by birds and bees,

Abstract = {{Rubiaceae contains the largest number of distylous species in the

   have been described in this family and associated with disturbance,

   atypical taxa belong to Psychotria, the largest genus in the family. In
   the present study, we investigate the pollination and breeding biology
   of Psychotria carthagenensis Jacq., a widely distributed species that
   has been described as typically distylous. Fieldwork was carried out
   mainly at the Panga Ecological Station, in Uberlandia, MG, Brazil. We
   carried out phenological observations, floral biology studies and hand
   pollination experiments within the Panga Ecological Station population.
   We complemented these data with herbarium and field surveys from
   elsewhere in Brazil. The studied population bloomed at the beginning of
   the rains (September-December). The main pollinators were Bombus and
   small Halictidae bees. The Panga Ecological Station population presented
   pin-monomorphism with only two thrum individuals in more than 100
   flowering individuals surveyed. Hand pollinations at the Panga
   Ecological Station showed self-compatibility and intramorph
   compatibility. Typical distyly and isoplethy were found in other areas
   and both morphs appeared in herbarium material. However,
   pin-monomorphism was also observed elsewhere in Brazil. Typical distyly,
   pin-monomorphism and homostyly observed concurrently in Brazilian
   populations of P. carthagenensis indicate that alternative reproductive
   strategies, probably favoring selfing, appear to have developed

   June 2005. The number of flowers per flower head, flower lifetime,
   anthesis events and other floral characteristics, such as flower size,

   receptivity and pollen viability were evaluated. The flowers were
   observed and documented in a scanning electron microscope, after
   receiving a proper treatment. Tests were performed to investigate the
   reproductive system, aiming to evaluate the reliance on pollinators.
   Floral visitors were observed directly in the field and their frequency,
   duration of visits and behavior on flowers were registered. M.
   bimucronata showed an annual flowering pattern. The pollen grains are
   united in polyades with eight cells, which are interpreted as an
   adaptation to minimize mixed pollen grain loads on the minute stigma.
   Fruit set was low in natural conditions and there was no occurrence of
   agamospermy or spontaneous self-pollination. The flower and
   inflorescence morphology allow access to several orders of visitors.
   Members of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera were observed visiting

Abstract = {{Many animals behave as robbers or thieves of floral resources, causing
   damage to floral tissues or consuming resources used to attract
   pollinators, or producing effects similar to emasculation by reducing
   the pollen load in the anthers (which generally results in losses in
   terms of sexual reproduction). The present work examined the direct and
   indirect impacts caused by nectar-robbing on the reproductive success of
   Sparattosperma leucanthum. Different manipulations of the flowers were
   tested to determine if fruit production was influenced by the
   perforations made in the floral tissues (direct damage), and if there
   were changes in visitation frequencies or in the behaviors of effective
   pollinators (indirect damage). Perforations made by nectar robbers did
   not lower the reproductive success of the plant species studied. The bee
   Trigona spinipes was the most frequent visitor and caused the largest
   perforations in the calyx and corolla of S. leucanthum. Additionally, we
   noted the occurrence of pollen theft by this same bee in flowers that
   had been protected against nectar-robbing. These results suggest that if
   S. leucanthum had developed a mechanism of resistance to robbery by T
   spinipes it would probably have experienced even lower pollination
   levels as a result of reductions in the quantities of pollen available
   for transfer by effective pollinators. We were not able to evaluate if
   nectar depletion through robbery modified the behavior of the effective
   pollinators (bumblebees of the genus Bombus).}},

   visitor groups were birds, bees and butterflies. The species spectrum

   visits occurred mainly in the morning hours. However, there was no

   contrast to the expectation that Ae. nudicaulis flowers, due to their

Title = {{A Gross Anatomy Ontology for Hymenoptera}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Hymenoptera is an extraordinarily diverse lineage, both in terms of
   species numbers and morphotypes, that includes sawflies, bees, wasps,
   and ants. These organisms serve critical roles as herbivores, predators,
   parasitoids, and pollinators, with several species functioning as models
   for agricultural, behavioral, and genomic research. The collective
   anatomical knowledge of these insects, however, has been described or
   referred to by labels derived from numerous, partially overlapping
   lexicons. The resulting corpus of information-millions of statements
   about hymenopteran phenotypes-remains inaccessible due to language
   discrepancies. The Hymenoptera Anatomy Ontology (HAO) was developed to
   surmount this challenge and to aid future communication related to
   hymenopteran anatomy. The HAO was built using newly developed interfaces
   within mx, a Web-based, open source software package, that enables
   collaborators to simultaneously contribute to an ontology. Over twenty
   people contributed to the development of this ontology by adding terms,
   genus differentia, references, images, relationships, and annotations.
   The database interface returns an Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO)
   formatted version of the ontology and includes mechanisms for extracting
   candidate data and for publishing a searchable ontology to the Web. The
   application tools are subject-agnostic and may be used by others
   initiating and developing ontologies. The present core HAO data
   constitute 2,111 concepts, 6,977 terms (labels for concepts), 3,152
   relations, 4,361 sensus (links between terms, concepts, and references)
   and over 6,000 text and graphical annotations. The HAO is rooted with
   the Common Anatomy Reference Ontology (CARO), in order to facilitate
   interoperability with and future alignment to other anatomy ontologies,
   and is available through the OBO Foundry ontology repository and
   BioPortal. The HAO provides a foundation through which connections
   between genomic, evolutionary developmental biology, phylogenetic,
   taxonomic, and morphological research can be actualized. Inherent
   mechanisms for feedback and content delivery demonstrate the
   effectiveness of remote, collaborative ontology development and
   facilitate future refinement of the HAO.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar robbers are thought rarely to pollinate flowers, especially those
   with sexual organs hidden within corollas. In this study, we examined
   whether robbers pollinate flowers of distylous Primula secundiflora.
   Distylous plants have two floral morphs. Pin flowers have long styles
   and short stamens, and thrum flowers have short styles and long stamens.
   Flowers of P. secundiflora were commonly robbed by bumblebees, and
   robbing holes were always situated between high and low sexual organs
   for both floral morphs. We observed that pollen grains of pin flowers
   were removed while thrum flowers received fresh pollen grains
   immediately after flowers were robbed. We manipulated flowers so that
   only nectar robbers could visit them. This resulted in 98 per cent of
   thrum flowers and 6 per cent of pin flowers setting fruit, and seed
   number per thrum fruit was also significantly higher than per pin fruit.
   Our findings suggest that nectar robbers transfer pollen from pin
   flowers to thrum flowers effectively, and consequently increase male
   fitness of the pin morph and female fitness of the thrum morph. Such
   asymmetrical pollen flow caused by nectar robbers may act as an
   important selective agent in floral fitness and evolution of distyly.}},

Volume = {{260}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{China's subtropical forests have experienced severe deforestation and
   most native forests have been fragmented into an archipelago-like
   landscape. The genetic effect of habitat fragmentation depends largely
   on the level of gene flow within and among population fragments. In the
   present study, Eurycorymbus cavaleriei, a canopy tree found throughout
   subtropical China, was selected as a representative insect-pollinated
   plant species to assess genetic consequence of forest fragmentation.
   Contemporary pollen dispersal and mating patterns were estimated in two
   physically isolated stands of E. cavaleriei within fragmented forests
   using six highly polymorphic microsatellite loci. We found high genetic
   diversity (H-E = 0.670-0.754) in both adults and offspring in the
   fragmented agricultural landscape, suggesting that habitat fragmentation
   did not necessarily erode genetic diversity of E. cavaleriei. Although
   substantial pollen travelled less than 100 m, paternity analysis
   revealed that a large amount of long-distance pollination events
   occurred, with the average pollen dispersal distance being 1107m and
   325m for the two stands, respectively. Extensive pollen immigration
   (39.3-42.6\%) indicated that there was effective genetic connectivity
   among E. cavaleriei stands in the fragmented forests. TWOGENER analysis
   revealed that the exponential power model was the best-fitting dispersal
   curve with a fat-tailed (b < 1) dispersal feature. The results from a
   multilocus mating system analysis suggested that a small amount of
   biparental inbreeding and some correlated mating events occurred in the
   fragmented forests, which were similar to our parallel findings in the
   continuous forests of E. cavaleriei. Estimates of pollen pool structure
   (Phi(FT) = 0.128-0.174) indicated large genetic differences between
   pollen clouds accepted by maternal trees. The number of effective pollen
   donors (N-ep) in E. cavaleriei, estimated using both MLTR (N-ep =
   4.2-5.3) and TWOGENER (N-ep =2.9-3.9) models, was equivalent to the
   number of effective pollen donors detected in continuous forests of E.
   cavaleriei. The pollen dispersal and mating patterns detected here
   indicated that habitat fragmentation did not have a negative impact on
   pollen movement in E. cavaleriei, possibly due to its generalist
   pollination system and the resilient foraging behavior of its
   pollinators in response to changes in landscape structure. The long
   distances of pollen-mediated gene flow between patches highlight the
   conservation value of remnant forest fragments in maintaining genetic
   connectivity at the landscape scale in subtropical China. (C) 2010

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Flower colour is of great importance in various fields
   relating to floral biology and pollinator behaviour. However, subjective
   human judgements of flower colour may be inaccurate and are irrelevant
   to the ecology and vision of the flower's pollinators. For precise,
   detailed information about the colours of flowers, a full reflectance
   spectrum for the flower of interest should be used rather than relying
   on such human assessments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The Floral Reflectance Database (FReD)
   has been developed to make an extensive collection of such data
   available to researchers. It is freely available at
   http://www.reflectance.co.uk. The database allows users to download
   spectral reflectance data for flower species collected from all over the
   world. These could, for example, be used in modelling interactions
   between pollinator vision and plant signals, or analyses of flower
   colours in various habitats. The database contains functions for
   calculating flower colour loci according to widely-used models of bee
   colour space, reflectance graphs of the spectra and an option to search
   for flowers with similar colours in bee colour space.
   Conclusions/Significance: The Floral Reflectance Database is a valuable
   new tool for researchers interested in the colours of flowers and their
   association with pollinator colour vision, containing raw spectral
   reflectance data for a large number of flower species.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The Malpighiaceae include similar to 1300 tropical
   flowering plant species in which generic definitions and intergeneric
   relationships have long been problematic. The goals of our study were to
   resolve relationships among the 11 generic segregates from the New World
   genus Mascagnia, test the monophyly of the largest remaining
   Malpighiaceae genera, and clarify the placement of Old World
   Malpighiaceae.
   Methods: We combined DNA sequence data for four genes (plastid ndhF,
   matK, and rbcL and nuclear PHYC) from 338 ingroup accessions that
   represented all 77 currently recognized genera with morphological data
   from 144 ingroup species to produce a complete generic phylogeny of the

   Key results and conclusions: The genera are distributed among 14 mostly
   well-supported clades. The interrelationships of these major subclades
   have strong support, except for the clade comprising the wing-fruited
   genera (i.e., the malpighioid+Amorimia, Ectopopterys, hiraeoid,
   stigmaphylloid, and tetrapteroid clades). These results resolve numerous
   systematic problems, while others have emerged and constitute
   opportunities for future study. Malpighiaceae migrated from the New to
   Old World nine times, with two of those migrants being very recent
   arrivals from the New World. The seven other Old World clades dispersed
   much earlier, likely during the Tertiary. Comparison of floral
   morphology in Old World Malpighiaceae with their closest New World
   relatives suggests that morphological stasis in the New World likely
   results from selection by neotropical oil-bee pollinators and that the
   morphological diversity found in Old World flowers has evolved following
   their release from selection by those bees.}},

Abstract = {{Animals collecting resources that replenish over time often visit
   patches in predictable sequences called traplines. Despite the
   widespread nature of this strategy, we still know little about how
   spatial memory develops and guides individuals toward suitable routes.
   Here, we investigate whether flower visitation sequences by bumblebees
   Bombus terrestris simply reflect the order in which flowers were
   discovered or whether they result from more complex navigational
   strategies enabling bees to optimize their foraging routes. We analyzed
   bee flight movements in an array of four artificial flowers maximizing
   interfloral distances. Starting from a single patch, we sequentially
   added three new patches so that if bees visited them in the order in
   which they originally encountered flowers, they would follow a long
   (suboptimal) route. Bees' tendency to visit patches in their discovery
   order decreased with experience. Instead, they optimized their flight
   distances by rearranging flower visitation sequences. This resulted in
   the development of a primary route (trapline) and two or three less
   frequently used secondary routes. Bees consistently used these routes
   after overnight breaks while occasionally exploring novel possibilities.
   We discuss how maintaining some level of route flexibility could allow
   traplining animals to cope with dynamic routing problems, analogous to
   the well-known traveling salesman problem.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of the genus Arum are known to attract dung-breeding flies and
   beetles through olfactory deceit. In addition to this strategy, the
   genus has evolved several other pollination mechanisms. The present
   study aimed to characterize the pollination strategies of the Cretan
   Arum species by investigating the flowering phenology, thermogeny,
   inflorescence odours, and the pollinating fauna. The results obtained
   show that Arum cyrenaicum and Arum concinnatum emit a strong dung smell
   and exhibit the distinctive features associated with this pollination
   syndrome. Both species are highly thermogenic, have a similar odour
   profile and attract small-bodied Diptera. Although sharing the same
   habitat, these two plant species are never found growing sympatrically
   as a result of the early blooming period of A. cyrenaicum. By contrast,
   Arum creticum and Arum idaeum have evolved a more traditional and
   mutually beneficial pollination mechanism. The stinking smell has been
   replaced by a more flower-like odour that attracts bees (Lasioglossum
   sp.) and, occasionally, bugs (Dionconotus cruentatus). Although
   attracting the same pollinator, the main compound present in the odour
   of A. creticum is different from that of A. idaeum. Principal component
   analysis (PCA), based on physiologically active components of the flower
   odours determined by testing on the antenna of the Lasioglossum bee,
   revealed two different clusters, indicating that pollinators can
   potentially discriminate between the odours of the two species. A
   further PCA on the main floral odour volatiles as identified by gas
   chroatography-mass spectroscopy from all the Arum species under
   investigation displayed odour-based similarities and differences among
   the species. The PCA-gas chomotography-electroantennographic detection
   active peaks analysis showed that the two species, A. creticum and A.
   idaeum, form two groups and are clearly separated from A. cyrenaicum and
   A. concinnatum, which, conversely, cluster together. The evolutionary
   forces and selective pressures leading to diversification of pollination
   mechanisms in the Cretan Arum spp. are discussed. (C) 2010 The Linnean

Abstract = {{2. This study used a 2-year multi-site survey of bumblebee parasitism to
   ask: (i) how common are parasitoid conopid flies and the internal
   parasites Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi in Massachusetts; and (ii)
   what factors are correlated with parasitism?
   3. Infection rates by all three parasites were higher in this study than
   previously documented in North America. Overall, conopids infected
   0-73\% of bees in each sample, C. bombi infected 0-82\% of bees, and N.
   bombi infected 0-32\%.
   4. Conopid flies infected female bees more than males and
   intermediate-sized bees more than large or small bees. Crithidia bombi
   infection rates were higher in certain bee species and sites, and
   exhibited a unimodal pattern of prevalence over time. Nosema bombi
   parasitism was higher in male than female bees.
   5. Infection by N. bombi in two rare bumblebee species was higher than
   expected based on parasitism rates of common bee species but C. bombi
   infection was lower.
   If high prevalence of N. bombi in these bumblebee species is common,
   parasitism may be a potential cause of their decline.
   6. Given the documented effects of these parasites, the high levels of

Abstract = {{1. We have little idea how landscape-scale factors influence the success
   of wild bumblebee nests over time. Here for the first time we use
   molecular markers to estimate within-season changes in the numbers of
   nests.
   2. Workers of two bumblebee species were sampled in an arable landscape
   in late May-June and late July-August, and the numbers of nests
   represented in each sample were estimated. We compare the methods
   available to estimate nest number from such samples and conclude that
   methods which allow for heterogeneity in the probability of capture of
   nests provide the best fit to our data. Changes in numbers of nests at
   the two time points were used to infer nest survival.
   3. The two bee species appeared to differ markedly in survival over
   time, with estimates of 45\% of nests surviving for Bombus lapidarius
   and 91\% for B. pascuorum. However, our data suggest that the foraging
   range of B. pascuorum may be greater in late season, which would lead us
   to overestimate nest survival in this species. Differential survival may
   also reflect differences in phenology between the two species.
   4. The land use class which had the most consistent effects on nest
   number and survival was gardens; for B. lapidarius, the area of gardens
   within a 750 and 1000 mradius positively influenced nest survival, while
   for B. pascuorum, the number of nests in late samples was higher at
   sites with more gardens within a 500 and 750-m radius. For B. pascuorum,
   the area of grassland within a 250 and 500-mradius also positively
   influenced nest number in late samples, probably because this is the
   preferred nesting habitat for this species.
   5. The importance of gardens is in accordance with previous studies
   which suggest that they now provide a stronghold for bumblebees in an
   otherwise impoverished agricultural environment; furthermore, our data
   suggest that the positive influence of gardens on bumblebee populations
   can spill over at least 1 km into surrounding farmland.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The substantial effects that even small
   areas of local resources such as rough grassland or clover leys can have
   on bumblebee nest numbers and survival is of clear relevance for the
   design of pollinator management strategies.}},

   reproductive success was positively related to signal accuracy and

Abstract = {{Bumblebees were introduced into New Zealand from the UK approximately
   120 years ago and four species became established. Two of these, Bombus
   terrestris and B. hortorum, are common in Europe whilst two, B.
   ruderatus and B. subterraneus, have experienced declines, and the latter
   is now extinct in the UK. The presence of these species in New Zealand
   presents an opportunity to study their ecology in a contrasting
   environment. Forage visits made by bumblebees in New Zealand were
   recorded across a season. Ninety-six percent of visits were to six
   non-native forage plants (Cirsium vulgare, Echium vulgare, Hypericum
   perforatum, Lotus corniculatus, Lupinus polyphyllus and Trifolium
   pratense). All but L. polyphyllus are European plant species, and three
   are noxious weeds in New Zealand. Several of these plants have decreased
   in abundance in the UK, providing a potential explanation for the
   declines of B. ruderatus and B. subterraneus in Britain. In contrast to
   studies conducted elsewhere, B. ruderatus, B. terrestris and B. hortorum
   did not differ in diet breadth and overlap in forage use was high,
   probably due to the reduced diversity of bumblebee forage plants present
   in New Zealand. Diel partitioning of forage use between the species was
   observed, with foraging activity of B. hortorum greatest in the morning
   and evening, B. ruderatus greatest in the middle of the day and B.
   terrestris intermediate between the two. These patterns correspond to
   the climatic preferences of each species as evidenced by their

   Production Fields}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Characterizing the spatial patterns of gene flow from
   transgenic crops is challenging, making it difficult to design
   containment strategies for markets that regulate the adventitious
   presence of transgenes. Insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton
   is planted on millions of hectares annually and is a potential source of
   transgene flow.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored 15 non-Bt cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum, L.) seed production fields (some transgenic for
   herbicide resistance, some not) for gene flow of the Bt cotton cry1Ac
   transgene. We investigated seed-mediated gene flow, which yields
   adventitious Bt cotton plants, and pollen-mediated gene flow, which
   generates outcrossed seeds. A spatially-explicit statistical analysis
   was used to quantify the effects of nearby Bt and non-Bt cotton fields
   at various spatial scales, along with the effects of pollinator
   abundance and adventitious Bt plants in fields, on pollen-mediated gene
   flow. Adventitious Bt cotton plants, resulting from seed bags and
   planting error, comprised over 15\% of plants sampled from the edges of
   three seed production fields. In contrast, pollen-mediated gene flow
   affected less than 1\% of the seed sampled from field edges. Variation
   in outcrossing was better explained by the area of Bt cotton fields
   within 750 m of the seed production fields than by the area of Bt cotton
   within larger or smaller spatial scales. Variation in outcrossing was
   also positively associated with the abundance of honey bees.
   Conclusions/Significance: A comparison of statistical methods showed
   that our spatially-explicit analysis was more powerful for understanding
   the effects of surrounding fields than customary models based on
   distance. Given the low rates of pollen-mediated gene flow observed in
   this study, we conclude that careful planting and screening of seeds
   could be more important than field spacing for limiting gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of rare species and ecosystem biodiversity should not lead
   to conflicts. However, situations may arise when the management of focal
   species places non-target species at risk. In the Willamette Valley of
   western Oregon, USA, eradication of a naturally hybridizing Grindelia
   integrifolia x Grindelia nana (Asteraceae) population from a wildlife
   refuge to preserve genetically ``pure{''} populations of endemic G.
   integrifolia populations to the North, eliminated a dominant,
   late-summer, flowering plant from the plant community. While this
   decision undoubtedly arose from good intentions, the hybrid Grindelia
   was the sole pollen resource for the last known population (numbered in
   100s prior to Grindelia removal) of an endemic solitary bee, Melissodes
   pullatella (Anthophoridae), a rare wetland butterfly, Lycaena xanthoides
   (Lycaenidae), and very likely additional pollinators. Approximately 15
   years after the removal of Grindelia from the wildlife refuge, we found
   several small populations of M. pullatella (< 20 individuals sighted)
   about 70 km to the south of the refuge in hybrid Grindelia-dominated
   remnant and restored wetlands. We present this case study to highlight
   the loss of local biodiversity that can accompany single species driven
   ecosystem management. We hope that land managers will consider not only
   the preservation of the formally recognized rare species in their
   conservation strategy but also the impacts of management practices on
   site biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining quantitative information concerning pollinator behaviour has
   become a primary objective of pollination studies, but methodological
   limitations hinder progress towards this goal. Here, we use molecular
   genetic methods in an ecological context to demonstrate that endemic
   Hawaiian Hylaeus bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) selectively collect
   pollen from native plant species in Haleakala and Hawaii Volcanoes
   National Parks. We identified pollen DNA from the crops (internal
   storage organs) of 21 Hylaeus specimens stored in ethanol for up to 3
   years. Genetic analyses reveal high fidelity in pollen foraging despite
   the availability of pollen from multiple plant species present at each
   study site. At high elevations in Haleakala, pollen was available from
   more than 12 species of flowering plants, but Hawaiian silversword
   (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) comprised 86\% of all
   pollen samples removed from bee crops. At lower elevations in both
   parks, we only detected pukiawe (Leptecophylla (Styphelia) tameiameiae)
   pollen in Hylaeus crops despite the presence of other plant species in
   flower during our study. Furthermore, 100\% of Hylaeus crops from which
   we successfully identified pollen contained native plant pollen. The
   molecular approaches developed in this study provide species-level
   information about floral visitation of Hawaiian Hylaeus that does not
   require specialized palynological expertise needed for high-throughput
   visual pollen identification. Building upon this approach, future
   studies can thus develop appropriate and customized criteria for
   assessing mixed pollen loads from a broader range of sources and from
   other global regions.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, there is concern over the decline of bees, an ecologically
   important group of pollinating insects. Genetic studies provide insights
   into population structure that are crucial for conservation management
   but that would be impossible to obtain by conventional ecological
   methods. Yet conservation genetic studies of bees have primarily
   focussed on social species rather than the more species-rich solitary
   bees. Here, we investigate the population structure of Colletes
   floralis, a rare and threatened solitary mining bee, in Ireland and
   Scotland using nine microsatellite loci. Genetic diversity was
   surprisingly as high in Scottish (Hebridean island) populations at the
   extreme northwestern edge of the species range as in mainland Irish
   populations further south. Extremely high genetic differentiation among
   populations was detected; multilocus F-ST was up to 0.53, and G'(ST) and
   D-est were even higher (maximum: 0.85 and 1.00, respectively). A pattern
   of isolation by distance was evident for sites separated by land. Water
   appears to act as a substantial barrier to gene flow yet sites separated
   by sea did not exhibit isolation by distance. C. floralis populations
   are extremely isolated and probably not in regional migration-drift
   equilibrium. GIS-based landscape genetic analysis reveals urban areas as
   a potential and substantial barrier to gene flow. Our results highlight
   the need for urgent site-specific management action to halt the decline
   of this and potentially other rare solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination syndromes involve convergent evolution towards phenotypes
   composed of specific scents, colours or floral morphologies that attract
   or restrict pollinator access to reward. How these traits might
   influence the distributions of plant species in interaction with
   pollinators has rarely been investigated. We sampled 870 vegetation
   plots in the western Swiss Alps and classified the plant species into
   seven blossom types according to their floral morphology (wind, disk,
   funnel, tube, bilabiate, head or brush). We investigated the
   environmental features of plots with functional diversity (FD) lower
   than expected by chance alone to detect potential pollination filtering
   and related the proportions of the seven blossom types to a combination
   of environmental descriptors. From these results, we inferred the
   potential effect of the pollinator on the spatial distribution of plant
   species. The vegetation plots with significantly lower FD of blossom
   types than expected by chance were found at higher altitudes, and the
   proportions of blossom types were strongly patterned along the same
   gradient. These results support a biotic filtering effect on plant
   species assemblages through pollination: disk blossoms became dominant
   at higher altitudes, resulting in a lower FD. In harsh conditions at
   high altitudes, pollinators usually decrease in activity, and the
   openness of the disk blossom grants access to any available pollinator.
   Inversely, bilabiate blossoms, which are mostly pollinated by bees, were
   more abundant at lower elevations, which are characterised by greater
   abundance and diversity of bees. Generalisation through openness of the
   blossom could be advantageous at high elevations, while specialisation
   could be a successful alternative strategy at lower elevations. The
   approach used in this study is purely correlative, and further
   investigations should be conducted to infer the nature of the causal
   relationship between plant and pollinator distributions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: To date, in modern agriculture, biological control
   strategies are increasingly becoming the preferred pest management
   approach. However, the success of microbiological control agents (MCAs)
   largely depends on efficient dissemination into the crop. The
   pollinator-and-vector technology employs pollinating insects like bees
   for a better dissemination. In this study, a new dispenser for bumblebee
   workers of Bombus terrestris L. was developed. Binab-T-vector and
   Prestop-Mix were used as two typical MCA products for dissemination.
   RESULTS: In a first series of experiments in the laboratory for
   optimisation, the newly developed dispenser was a two-way type
   dispenser, 20 cm long, with two rectangular compartments and different
   entrance and exit holes. In addition, the amounts of MCA loaded on the
   workers were 10 times higher with the new dispenser as compared with the
   side-by-side passageway (SSP) dispenser. Typically, the highest amounts
   were recovered from the thorax and legs of the workers. In a second
   series of experiments under greenhouse conditions with the use of
   queen-right B. terrestris hives, successful dissemination in strawberry
   flowers was obtained at different distances from the hive (0-8 m, 8-18 m
   and 18-21 m), and the workers inoculated the first, second and third
   flowers that were consecutively visited. In addition, the new dispenser
   caused no adverse effects on worker foraging intensity, whereas a
   dramatic reduction was scored with an SSP dispenser. Finally, the data
   suggested that it is necessary to refill the newly developed dispenser
   at 3 day intervals.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, with the use of the newly
   developed dispenser, bumblebee workers carried high amounts of MCA, and
   this resulted in a successful dissemination of MCA into strawberry
   flowers. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{The surface of some insect eyes consists of arrays of cuticular
   protuberances, which are 50-300. nm in diameter, and are termed corneal
   nipples or ommatidia gratings. They were widely reported to reduce the
   reflectance for normally incident light, contributing to camouflage by
   reducing glare to predators, while furthermore enhancing the intake of
   light, which is especially important for nocturnal insects. Our
   preliminary observations suggest a third function: in contrast to the
   rest of the body, ommatidia of various insects remain clean, even in a
   heavy contaminated environment. In order to prove such an
   anti-contamination hypothesis of these structures, we measured the
   adhesive properties of polymer moulds of insect ommatidia, and compared
   these data with control surfaces having the same curvature radii but
   lacking such a nanostructure. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) study
   and force measurements using an atomic force microscope (AFM) on the eye
   surfaces of three different insect species, dragonfly Aeshna mixta
   (Odonata), moth Laothoe populi (Lepidoptera) and fly Volucella pellucens
   (Diptera), were undertaken. We revealed that adhesion is greatly reduced
   by corneal grating in L. populi and V. pellucens when compared with
   their smooth controls. The smooth cornea of A. mixta showed no
   statistically significant difference to its control. We assume that this
   anti-adhesive phenomenon is due to a decrease in the real contact area
   between contaminating particles and the eye's surface. Such a
   combination of three functions in one nanostructure can be interesting
   for the development of industrial multifunctional surfaces capable of
   enhancing light harvesting while reducing light reflection and adhesion.}},

   earliest years starting a month before the latest years owing to
   variation in winter snowpack accumulation. Fruit set is diminished or
   prevented entirely by killing frosts in some years, most frequently but
   not exclusively for the earlier cohorts. When frosts do not limit fruit
   set, pollination limitation is frequent, especially in the earlier
   cohorts. Pollination limitation is strongest for middle cohorts: it
   tends to be negated by frost in early cohorts and ameliorated by
   continuing emergence of bumble-bee queens in later cohorts. This lily

   Paliavana tenuiflora is a shrub with blue-violet, bell-shaped flowers,

   the time of day, but concentration varied with volume. The species is
   self-compatible, but fruit set depends on pollinators. Although nectar
   is available by day and night, flowers of P. tenuiflora fit the bee
   pollination syndrome, and are actually pollinated by Bombus brevivillus.
   However, the hummingbird Phaethornis pretrei can be considered an
   occasional pollinator, due to its behavior and low frequency of visits.
   Our results suggest a mixed pollination system, although the importance

Abstract = {{We investigated pollinator response to a pair of sympatric sister taxa,

   visitors and performed array experiments. Our results show that similar
   suites of pollinators visit both plant taxa, which implies no fixed
   preference on the part of the pollinator species. However, when
   individual insects visit mixed arrays, they tend to restrict their
   visits to either the white or purple flowered taxon, likely resulting in
   assortative pollen transfer even in areas of fine-scale sympatry. The
   assortative visitation observed is noteworthy given that A. subcordatum
   and A. vexillo-calyculatum are best interpreted as incipient species.
   Thus, assortative mating caused by the specialization of individual
   pollinators towards a single flower color may be crucial for allowing
   the continued divergence of these lineages. These data contribute to our
   understanding of the relationship between angiosperm species and their
   animal pollinators and how these interactions may contribute to the
   diversification of flowering plants.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the responses of ecological communities and
   individual species to human-induced environmental change remains a key
   issue for ecologists and conservation managers alike. Responses are
   often variable among species within groups making general predictions
   difficult. One option is to include ecological trait information that
   might help to disentangle patterns of response and also provide greater
   understanding of how particular traits link whole clades to their
   environment. Although this ``trait-guild{''} approach has been used for
   single disturbances, the importance of particular traits on general
   responses to multiple disturbances has not been explored. We used a
   mixed model analysis of 19 data sets from throughout the world to test
   the effect of ecological and life-history traits on the responses of bee
   species to different types of anthropogenic environmental change. These
   changes included habitat loss, fragmentation, agricultural
   intensification, pesticides and fire. Individual traits significantly
   affected bee species responses to different disturbances and several
   traits were broadly predictive among multiple disturbances. The location
   of nests - above vs. below ground - significantly affected response to
   habitat loss, agricultural intensification, tillage regime (within
   agriculture) and fire. Species that nested above ground were on average
   more negatively affected by isolation from natural habitat and intensive
   agricultural land use than were species nesting below ground. In
   contrast below-ground-nesting species were more negatively affected by
   tilling than were above-ground nesters. The response of different
   nesting guilds to fire depended on the time since the burn. Social bee
   species were more strongly affected by isolation from natural habitat
   and pesticides than were solitary bee species. Surprisingly, body size
   did not consistently affect species responses, despite its importance in
   determining many aspects of individuals' interaction with their
   environment. Although synergistic interactions among traits remain to be
   explored, individual traits can be useful in predicting and
   understanding responses of related species to global change. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is believed to be a key threat to biodiversity as
   it decreases the probability of survival of populations, reduces gene
   flow among populations and increases the possibility of inbreeding and
   loss of genetic diversity within populations. Heathlands represent
   excellent systems to study fragmentation effects as the spatial and
   temporal course of fragmentation is well documented for these habitats.
   At the beginning of the nineteenth century, heathlands were widespread
   in northern Germany, but they became increasingly fragmented at the end
   of the nineteenth century until only few fragments had been left. As
   many insect species are strongly specialized on heathland habitats, they
   represent ideal study systems to test the genetic effects of such recent
   fragmentation processes. The solitary bee Andrena fuscipes is strongly
   specialized on heather (Calluna vulgaris) and, therefore, occurs
   exclusively in heathland habitats. The species is red-listed in Germany
   and other parts of Europe. Here, we present an analysis of the genetic
   structure of 12 populations of A. fuscipes using eight microsatellite
   loci. The populations showed little geographical structure and the
   degree of genetic differentiation was low. Compared to related bee
   species, inbreeding coefficients were relatively low and seem to be

Abstract = {{1. Understanding how foraging decisions take place at the local scale is

   2. By introducing two potted plant species (Salvia farinacae and Tagetes
   bonanza) into two populations of Taraxacum officinale, we investigated
   how plant identity, the mixtures of these plant species, and total plant
   density affected the attraction to and the foraging within a patch for
   six pollinator groups.
   3. The foraging behaviour was mainly driven by the availability of the
   preferred plant species, and secondly by patch diversity and density. In
   general, dense patches and those containing the three-species mixture
   were preferred by all insect groups for arrival, although muscoid and
   hover flies responded less to local floral composition than bees. Local
   diversity and density had, however, a weaker effect on foraging

Abstract = {{Flowers attract insects and so are commonly exploited as foraging sites
   by sit-and-wait predators. Such predators can be costly to their host
   plant by consuming pollinators. However, sit-and-wait predators are
   often prey generalists that also consume plant antagonists such as
   herbivores, nectar robbers and granivores, so may also provide benefits
   to their host plant. Here we present a simple, but general, model that
   provides novel predictions about how costs and benefits interact in
   different ecological circumstances. The model predicts that the
   ecological conditions in which flower-dwelling predators are found can
   generate either net benefits to their host plants, net costs to their
   host plants, or can have no effect on the fitness of their host plants.
   The net effect is influenced by the relative densities of mutualists and
   antagonists. The flower-dwelling predator has a strong positive effect
   on the plant if both the pollinators and the granivores are at high
   density. Further, the range of density combinations that yield a
   positive net outcome for the plant increases if the performance of
   pollinators is negatively density dependent, if the predator is only
   moderately effective at influencing flower visitor rates by its
   potential prey, and if pollinators are very effective. If plants of a
   given species find themselves consistently in conditions where they
   benefit from the presence of a predator then we predict that natural

   likelihood of predator recruitment and retention, especially where
   plants are served by highly effective pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{When exotic plant species share pollinators with native species,
   competition for pollination may lower the reproductive success of
   natives by reducing the frequency and/or quality of visits they receive.
   Exotic species often become numerically dominant in plant communities,
   and the relative abundance of these potential competitors for
   pollination may be an important determinant of their effects on the
   pollination and reproductive success of co-occurring native species. Our
   study experimentally tests whether the presence and abundance of an
   invasive exotic, Lythrum salicaria L. (Lythraceae), influences
   reproductive success of a co-flowering native species, Mimulus ringens
   L. (Phrymaceae). We also examine the mechanisms of competition for
   pollination and how they may be altered by changes in competitor
   abundance. We found that the presence of Lythrum salicaria lowered mean
   seed number in Mimulus ringens fruits. This effect was most pronounced
   when the invasive competitor was highly abundant, decreasing the number
   of seeds per fruit by 40\% in 2006 and 33\% in 2007. Reductions in the
   number of seeds per fruit were likely due to reduced visit quality
   resulting from Mimulus pollen loss when bees foraged on neighboring
   Lythrum plants. This study suggests that visit quality to natives may be

Abstract = {{In the face of global decline in biodiversity, the relationship between
   diversity and species interactions deserves particular attention. If
   pollinators are strongly dependent on floral diversity due to mutual
   specialization, declines in plant diversity, e.g. caused by land use
   intensification, may be associated with linked extinctions of
   pollinators. However, the general extent of pollinator specialization is
   still poorly known. To explore the dependence of local bee and hoverfly
   communities on flower diversity, we recorded flower supply and
   flower-visiting insects on 27 meadows with varying flower diversity in
   southern Germany and analyzed (a) whether the diversity of flower
   visitors is correlated with flower diversity, (b) whether the degree of
   dietary specialization of flower visitors changes with flower diversity
   and (c) whether flower preferences of individual flower visitor species
   are constant or variable between different communities. Flower-visitor
   interaction webs were compiled during a single day on each meadow. This
   approach prevents relating pollinator species to flowers they never
   encounter because of non-overlapping phenology or spatial segregation.
   (a) Flower diversity and flower visitor diversity were positively
   correlated. (b) Flower visitor assemblies were significantly specialized
   at a relatively high level, contrasting to the opinion that
   plant-pollinator webs are highly generalized, and providing a possible
   explanation for the positive diversity correlation. However, the level
   of specialization did not change significantly across the gradient of
   flower diversity, suggesting that pollinators are partitioned to a
   similar extent in each meadow. (c) In the analysis of ten common flower
   visitor species previously categorized as generalists, strong evidence
   was found for both, consistent preferences and preferences that differ
   between sites. These results indicate a flexibility in flower
   preferences and a dynamic resource partitioning among pollinators.
   Generally, our findings highlight the complexity of plant-pollinator
   interactions and confirm the importance of flower diversity for bee and
   hoverfly communities.}},

Abstract = {{Forelands of retreating glaciers offer an ideal model system to study
   community assembly processes during primary succession. As plants
   colonize the area that is freed from ice they should be accompanied by
   their pollinators to successfully reproduce and spread. However, little
   is known about the assembly of plant-pollinator networks. We therefore
   used quantitative network analysis to study the structure of
   plant-pollinator interactions at seven sites representing a
   chronosequence from 8 to 130 years since deglaciation on the foreland of
   the Morteratsch glacier (southeastern Switzerland). At these sites,
   individual visits of plant flowers by insects were recorded throughout
   the flowering season. Species richness of insect-pollinated plants and
   plant-pollinating insects, together with measures of interaction
   diversity and evenness, increased along the chronosequence at least for
   the first 80 years after deglaciation. Bees were the most frequent
   flower visitors at the two youngest sites, whereas flies dominated in
   mature communities. Pollinator generalization (the number of visited
   plant species weighted by interaction strength), but not plant
   generalization, strongly increased during the primary succession. This
   was reflected in a pronounced decline in network level specialization
   (measured as Bluthgen's H(2)') and interaction strength asymmetry during
   the first 60 years along the chronosequence, while nestedness increased
   along the chronosequence. Thus, our findings contradict
   niche-theoretical predictions of increasing specialization of
   pollination systems during succession, but are in agreement with
   expectations from optimal foraging theory, predicting an increase in
   pollinator generalization with higher plant diversity but similar flower
   abundance, and an increase in diet breadth at higher pollinator
   densities during primary succession.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines anthropogenic impacts on the pollination ecology of

   insect-pollinated species at risk. Pollination processes were explored
   in disturbed and non-disturbed sites in both high and low density
   patches on each of three lakes in southwest Nova Scotia, Canada. The
   primary pollinators were Syrphid flies (Diptera: Syrphidae) and Halictid
   bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). Pollinator diversity was not
   significantly different among lakes or sites. High flowering density
   plots were visited significantly more frequently than low density plots
   in all site types; pollination rates and handling time were
   significantly lower in disturbed compared to non-disturbed sites, such
   that pollinators both visited and spent less time handling flowers in
   disturbed sites. The reproductive success of open-pollinated flowers was
   significantly different among lakes; there was also a disturbance by
   lake interaction with higher reproductive success on disturbed sites in
   two of the lakes. Thus, this study finds evidence of reduced pollination
   service together with a beneficial reproductive effect of disturbance.
   The significance of these results and the possibility that the spatial
   genetic structure of disturbed sites is reduced are discussed. We
   conclude that reduced pollination service and changes in the genetic
   structure of populations demonstrate the potentially negative impact of
   human associated activities on pollinator activity and plant

   population of S bulbinella were relatively similar to S angustifolius

   insects belonging to at least four orders (flies, beetles, bees, and

   Nevertheless, its pollination success and pollen transfer efficiency are
   comparable to those of its close relative, Disa sankeyt, which is
   pollinated by a single genus of wasps D fragrans has an exceptionally
   strong floral scent volatile emission is 19-86 mu g per inflorescence

Abstract = {{The radiation of the angiosperms is often attributed to repeated
   evolutionary shifts between different pollinators, as this process
   drives diversification of floral forms and can lead to reproductive
   isolation. Floral scent is an important functional trait in many
   pollination systems but has seldom been implicated as a key mechanism in
   pollinator transitions. In this study, we suggest a role for sulphur
   compounds in mediating a shift between specialized carrion-fly and
   pompilid-wasp pollination systems in Eucomis (Hyacinthaceae). Flowers of
   closely related Eucomis species pollinated by carrion flies or pompilid
   wasps have very similar greenish-white flowers, but differ markedly in
   floral scent chemistry (determined by GC-MS analysis of headspace
   extracts). Comparison of the floral colours of the four Eucomis species
   in the visual systems of flies and wasps suggests that colour plays
   little role in pollinator discrimination. Nectar properties and
   morphology also do not differ strongly between fly-and wasp-pollinated
   flowers. By comparing floral scent bouquets and experimentally
   manipulating the scent of plants in the field, we demonstrate that
   shifts between wasp and fly pollination in these four congeners can
   depend on the production or suppression of sulphur compounds (dimethyl
   disulphide and dimethyl trisulphide) in the fragrance bouquet. This
   suggests that mutations affecting the production of particular scent
   compounds could precipitate shifts between pollinators, independently of
   floral morphology, colour or nectar properties.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study : Flowering plants that rely on pollinators for
   most of their reproduction may experience unpredictable and inconsistent
   availability of effective pollinators throughout their reproductive
   lifetime. We investigated the reproductive ecology of two subspecies of
   the tufted evening primrose, Oenothera cespitosa, which occupy
   geographically and edaphically distinct habitats in western North
   America: O. cespitosa subsp. navajoensis inhabits sandstone soils on
   open sites or rocky slopes in the Colorado Plateau and O. cespitosa
   subsp. cespitosa grows in clay soils on talus slopes and exposed rocky
   ridges in the western Great Plains and northern Rocky Mountains of the
   United States.
   Methods : Pollen augmentation and selfing experiments, floral visitor
   observations, and single-visit effectiveness experiments were conducted
   over 4 years to examine the breeding system and spatiotemporal variation
   in pollinator behavior, assemblage, and abundance at different
   populations for each subspecies.
   Key results : Both subspecies of O. cespitosa were self-incompatible and
   pollen-limited, suggesting that the relative abundance, effectiveness,
   and movement patterns of different insects as pollinators influenced the
   quality and quantity of seed production in these plants. Medium-sized
   vespertine hawkmoths (Hyles lineata, Sphinx vashti) were effective
   pollinators when present, as were large matinal bees (Anthophora
   affabilis, A. dammersi, Xylocopa tabaniformis androleuca), whereas small
   oligolectic Lasioglossum bees primarily functioned as pollen thieves in
   the evening and morning.
   Conclusions : These findings highlight the importance of variability of
   pollinator composition and abundance in the evolution of plant breeding
   systems and reproductive success at varying spatial and temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera.
   Megachilidae), is widely used in western North America to enhance
   pollination of alfalfa, Medicago saliva L grown for seed production
   Feral populations have been documented but have been little-studied We
   used trap-nests of a wide range of diameters (3-9 mm) to study a feral
   population at a wildflower seed farm in Montana Adult females accepted
   all hole sizes but tended to provision nest tunnels of smaller diameters
   (3-4 mm) than those provided in managed populations (5-7 mm) Progeny,
   especially females, from intermediate- and large-diameter nests averaged
   larger body size that those in the two smallest nest-diameter classes.
   Offspring were often larger in nests with greater numbers of offspring,
   indicating that there was no trade-off between offspring size and number
   within nests. Individual nests tended to contain a relatively small
   range of progeny sizes and those sizes tended to vary among nests of the
   same diameter. Previous studies of M rotundata indicate that
   heritability of body size is low, most offspring within nests are full
   siblings, and variation in offspring size is due to variation in the
   amount of provision provided by mothers Thus, the fact that body size
   varied among families probably related to variation in provisioning
   capabilities among females. We also found evidence that offspring size
   varied spatially but that seasonal trends in offspring size were weak
   Sex ratio varied among different nest sizes, but only the smallest and
   largest nests produced biased ratios Sex ratios were less male-biased
   than in commercially managed populations of M rotundata.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Almost all species of the orchid genus Ophrys are pollinated by sexual
   deception. The orchids mimic the sex pheromone of receptive female
   insects, mainly hymenopterans, in order to attract males seeking to
   copulate. Most Ophrys species have achromatic flowers, but some exhibit
   a coloured perianth and a bright, conspicuous labellum pattern. We
   recently showed that the pink perianth of Ophrys heldreichii flowers
   increases detectability by its pollinator, males of the long-horned bee
   Eucera berlandi. Here we tested the hypothesis that the bright, complex
   labellum pattern mimics the female of the pollinator to increase
   attractiveness toward males. In a dual-choice test we offered E.
   berlandi males an O. heldreichii flower and a flower from O. dictynnae,
   which also exhibits a pinkish perianth but no conspicuous labellum
   pattern. Both flowers were housed in UV-transmitting acrylic glass boxes
   to exclude olfactory signals. Males significantly preferred O.
   heldreichii to O. dictynnae flowers. In a second experiment, we replaced
   the perianth of both flowers with identical artificial perianths made
   from pink card, so that only the labellum differed between the two
   flower stimuli. Males then chose between both stimuli at random,
   suggesting that the presence of a labellum pattern does not affect their
   choice. Spectral measurements revealed higher colour contrast with the
   background of the perianth of O. heldreichii compared to O. dictynnae,
   but no difference in green receptor-specific contrast or brightness. Our
   results show that male choice is guided by the chromatic contrast of the
   perianth during the initial flower approach but is not affected by the
   presence of a labellum pattern. Instead, we hypothesise that the
   labellum pattern is involved in aversive learning during post-copulatory
   behaviour and used by the orchid as a strategy to increase outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{This experimental study focused on the effects of a mirid bug herbivore,

   adult C. infuscatus bugs on A. aestivus, on the nectar volume and

   number of flowers and nectar production as C. infuscatus densities
   increased. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed that nectar production
   was not affected by environmental variables (air temperature, relative
   air humidity and day-time) that were treated as covariates for the
   various bug herbivory intensities. Sugar concentration did not vary
   significantly among treatments, indicating that abiotic conditions were
   not responsible for differing nectar amounts. In light of A. aestivus's
   dependence on pollinator visits to produce seeds, we conclude that C.
   infuscatus could impair pollination success by reducing the amount of
   nectar in flowers. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is

Abstract = {{Given bees' central effect on vegetation communities, it is important to
   understand how and why bee distributions vary across ecological
   gradients. We examined how plant community composition, plant diversity,
   nesting suitability, canopy cover, land use, and fire history affected
   bee distribution across an open-forest gradient in northwest Indiana,
   USA, a gradient similar to the historic Midwest United States landscape
   mosaic. When considered with the other predictors, plant community
   composition was not a significant predictor of bee community
   composition. Bee abundance was negatively related to canopy cover and
   positively to recent fire frequency, bee richness was positively related
   to plant richness and abundance of potential nesting resources, and bee
   community composition was significantly related to plant richness, soil
   characteristics potentially related to nesting suitability, and canopy
   cover. Thus, bee abundance was predicted by a different set of
   environmental characteristics than was bee species richness, and bee
   community composition was predicted, in large part, by a combination of
   the significant predictors of bee abundance and richness. Differences in
   bee community composition along the woody vegetation gradient were
   correlated with relative abundance of oligolectic, or diet specialist,
   bees. Because oligoleges were rarer than diet generalists and were
   associated with open habitats, their populations may be especially
   affected by degradation of open habitats.
   More habitat-specialist bees were documented for open and forest/scrub
   habitats than for savanna/woodland habitats, consistent with bees
   responding to habitats of intermediate woody vegetation density, such as
   savannas, as ecotones rather than as distinct habitat types. Similarity
   of bee community composition, similarity of bee abundance, and
   similarity of bee richness between sites were not significantly related
   to proximity of sites to each other. Nestedness analysis indicated that
   species composition in species-poor sites was not merely a subset of
   species composition at richer sites. The lack of significant proximity
   or nestedness effects suggests that factors at a small spatial scale
   strongly influence bees' use of sites. The findings indicate that
   patterns of plant diversity, nesting resource availability, recent fire,
   and habitat shading, present at the scale of a few hundred meters, are
   key determinants of bee community patterns in the mosaic
   open-savanna-forest landscape.}},

   moderate silvicultural interventions such trade-offs do not necessarily
   occur. Including additional ecosystem services such as biological pest
   control or seed dispersal, which are also associated with the enhanced
   functional biodiversity in less dense tree plantations, might further
   emphasize the hump-shaped relationship between tree density and forest
   revenues. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a long-standing belief that insect pollinators can select for
   certain flower colors, there are few experimental demonstrations that
   free-flying insects choose between natural flowers based on color. We
   investigated responses of insect visitors to experimental manipulations
   of flower color in the New Zealand alpine. Native syrphid flies
   (Allograpta and Platycheirus) and solitary bees (Hylaeus and
   Leioproctus) showed distinct preferences for visiting certain flower
   species. These responses were determined, in part, by flower color, as
   insects also responded to experimental manipulations of visible petal
   color in 7 out of 11 tests with different combinations of flower species
   and insect type. When preferences were detected, syrphid flies chose
   yellow over white petals regardless of flower species, whereas Hylaeus
   chose white over yellow Ourisia glandulosa. In some cases, the strength
   and direction of color preference depended on the context of other
   floral traits, in which case the response usually favored the familiar,
   normal combination of traits. Syrphid flies also visited in response to
   floral morphological traits but did not show preference based on UV
   reflectance. The unusually high preponderance of white flowers in the
   New Zealand alpine is not explained by complete generalization of flower
   color choice. Instead, the insect visitors show preferences based on
   color, including colors other than white, along with other floral
   traits. Furthermore, they can respond in complex ways to combinations of
   floral cues, suggesting that traits may act in nonadditive ways in
   determining pollinator visitation.}},

Title = {{Biological Flora of the British Isles: Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall.}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1253-1267}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{P>1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Spiranthes spiralis (L.) Chevall. that are relevant to understanding its
   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented
   within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:
   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history and
   conservation.
   2. Spiranthes spiralis is a long-lived orchid species that is widely
   distributed in the southern part of the British Isles, southern Europe
   and the Mediterranean. It is native to Britain. Its most characteristic
   habitats are unimproved, well-grazed grasslands on dry calcareous soils,
   particularly chalk and limestone, cliff-tops and grassy coastal dunes.
   It can also be found in garden lawns and, less frequently, in slightly
   acidic heathland habitat. It occurs on both dry and wet soils, but it
   does not tolerate heavy shading.
   3. Spiranthes spiralis is a non-bulbous geophyte regenerating by sexual
   reproduction and by vegetative spread, although the latter is limited.
   Vegetative reproduction involves the growth of a lateral bud on the
   underground stem. The new plant forms its own tubers, and eventually the
   connection between the mother plant and the vegetatively produced
   daughter plant withers away.
   4. The main perennating organ is a tuberous root. In most years, the
   tuber generates a rosette of expanded leaves, and at the end of every
   year of the plant's life, the tuber is completely replaced. In some
   cases, however, only part of the reserves is exhausted in flowering and,
   when this happens, a tuber may survive for several years. Vegetative
   adult dormancy - the failure of above-ground parts to appear in a
   growing season, followed by reappearance of full-sized photosynthetic
   plants in subsequent seasons - has been observed. It most commonly lasts
   for only 1 year, but sometimes plants can remain dormant for several
   years.
   5. The species is not autogamous and pollinators - mainly bumblebees and
   bees - are necessary for successful pollination and fruit set. Natural
   levels of fruit set are usually < 50\%. Hand-pollination increases fruit
   set to c. 75\%, indicating that reproduction is to some extent
   pollen-limited. Sexual reproduction comes at a cost, and few individuals
   flower for two or more consecutive years. Within fruits many very small
   seeds are produced, but most are dispersed to a distance of less than a
   few dm from maternal plants, leading to strongly aggregated distribution
   patterns and significant spatial genetic structuring within natural
   populations.
   6. Spiranthes spiralis has suffered significant declines in distribution
   in Britain and other European countries. In Britain, populations were
   lost from many sites before 1930, when many pastures were re-sown or
   converted to arable land. Losses of populations due to agricultural
   intensification (ploughing of old fields and fertilization) still occur
   and are the major causes of the decline of the species. Conservation of
   remnant populations primarily requires the maintenance of a short turf
   by grazing, most often by sheep. Ideally, grazing should be suspended
   during flowering and seed set, allowing new recruits to become
   established and adult plants to flower profusely and to produce seeds.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on pollinator-mediated selection have been performed in
   generalized rather than specialized pollination systems. This situation
   has impeded evaluation of the extent to which selection acts on
   attraction or specialized key floral traits involved in the
   plant-pollinator phenotypic interphase. We studied pollinator-mediated
   selection in four populations of Nierembergia linariifolia, a
   self-incompatible and oil-secreting plant pollinated exclusively by
   oil-collecting bees. We evaluated whether floral traits experience
   variable selection among populations and whether attraction and fit
   traits are heterogeneously selected across populations. Populations
   differed in every flower trait and selection was consistently observed
   for corolla size and flower shape, two traits involved in the first
   steps of the pollination process. However, we found no selection acting
   on mechanical-fit traits. The observation that selection occurred upon
   attraction rather than mechanical-fit traits, suggests that plants are
   not currently evolving fine-tuned morphological adaptations to local
   pollinators and that phenotypic matching is not necessarily an expected
   outcome in this specialized pollination system.}},

Abstract = {{The natural hybridization that occurs between two sympatric species of
   Rhododendron subgenus Hymenanthes in Yunnan, China, was investigated. In
   field observations, it was noted that the putative hybrids between R.
   delavayi Franch. and R. cyanocarpum (Franch.) Franch. ex W.W. Sm. had
   intermediate morphologies. On the basis of morphology, chloroplast DNA
   (trnL-rpl32) and nuclear DNA (waxy), hybrids and parental species were
   identified. Hybridization occurred in both directions, but was
   asymmetrical, with R. delavayi as the major maternal parent. Reciprocal
   hand pollination treatments showed that either species, as pollen donor
   or pollen receiver, could produce fruits. It was noted that fruit set
   varied among treatments. The same pollinators (bumblebees) were shared
   in both parental species. From these results, we conclude that
   individuals with intermediate morphologies are indeed of hybrid origin
   from natural hybridization between R. cyanocarpum and R. delavayi.
   Furthermore, we presume the hybridization at the study site could have
   been initiated by habitat disturbance in the 1950s, and we may hence
   witness the early stages of hybrid swarm formation.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Rhodiola dumulosa is a perennial herb growing in a naturally fragmented
   habitat of high-mountain rocks. This research aims to (i) investigate
   the mating system characteristics and pollination biology of R.
   dumulosa, (ii) study the effects of ecological factors on the mating
   system and pollination biology of R. dumulosa and (iii) assess the
   relationship between its pollination and mating system.
   Methods
   Mating system parameters were analysed using allozyme markers. Growth of
   pollen tubes from artificial self- and cross-pollination was also
   examined. Field investigations were conducted on insect flower
   visitation during the blooming period of R. dumulosa. Relationships
   among mating system, insect flower visitation frequency and
   environmental factors were assessed.
   Important Findings
   The results showed that (i) R. dumulosa has a mixed-mating system: it is
   self-compatible and primarily outbreeding, with the multilocus
   outcrossing rate (t(m)) ranging from 0.589 +/- 0.078 (+/- standard
   deviation) to 0.846 +/- 0.077; inbreeding coefficients of maternal
   parents (F) were zero, indicating that inbreeding depression was
   intense. (ii) Light intensity and temperature impacted the visitation of
   the principal pollinators, the syrphid Eristalis tenax and the bumblebee
   Bombus pyrosoma. (iii) Population size plays an important role in the
   mating system and pollination. Populations received more frequent visits
   by the principal pollinators usually had higher outcrossing rates.
   Pollination to some extent affects the mating system of R. dumulosa and
   it is important to maintain large populations to prevent further
   inbreeding and to maintain pollinators to facilitate outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{The bee subgenus Dialictus (Hymenoptera: Halictidae: Lasioglossum)
   comprises the most commonly collected bees in North America and have the
   most diverse social systems of any equivalent group of insects. Despite
   their importance, as pollinators and as model organisms for studying the
   evolution of social behaviour, Dialictus remain one of the greatest
   challenges in bee taxonomy. A taxonomic revision of the metallic species
   of Canadian Dialictus has been completed which resolves many of the
   difficulties of these bees. Complete species descriptions with
   illustrations are provided for 84 metallic Dialictus in Canada along
   with keys to identify males and females. The following nineteen new

   L. (D.) yukonae Gibbs, new species. Lasioglossum (D.) mitchelli is
   proposed as a replacement name for L. atlanticum (Mitchell) due to
   secondary homonymy with Halictus interruptus atlanticus Cockerell, a
   junior subjective synonym of L. interruptum (Panzer). The following
   forty-three new synonymies are proposed: L. (D.) admirandum (Sandhouse)

   rohweri Ellis); L. (D.) zephyrum (Smith) (= H. (C.) academicus
   Sandhouse). Halictus (C.) unicus Sandhouse is again treated as a junior
   synonym of L. lineatulum. Eleven subgeneric names recently proposed by
   Pesenko are treated as synonymies of Dialictus. Some species names are
   used here in a sense different from those of most previous authors (e.
   g. H. nymphaearus, H. versatus). Names have often been misapplied in
   past usage sometimes subsuming multiple species. In some cases, even
   paratypes do not correspond to the same species as the name bearing
   type. The following three species are resurrected from synonymy: L. (D.)
   leucocomum (Lovell) new combinaton, L. (D.) oceanicum (Cockerell) new
   combination, and L. (D.) planatum. The species L. (D.) atriventre
   (Crawford) is considered a nomen dubium. The following twelve new
   records for Canada are reported: L. (D.) achilleae (Mitchell), L. (D.)
   brunneiventre (Crawford), L. (D.) callidum (Sandhouse), L. (D.)
   incompletum (Crawford), L. (D.) hudsoniellum (Cockerell), L. (D.)
   marinense (Michener), L. (D.) pacatum (Sandhouse), L. (D.) pallidellum
   (Ellis), L. (D.) punctatoventre (Crawford), L. (D). sagax (Sandhouse),
   L. (D.) weemsi (Mitchell) and L. (D.) zophops (Ellis). The Canadian
   records of two species, L. (D.) disparile (Cresson) and L. (D.) ceanothi
   (Mitchell), do not seem reliable and these species are not included in
   the revision. Two species, L. testaceum (Robertson) and L. rufulipes
   (Cockerell), are transferred from the L. (Dialictus) to L. (Evylaeus)
   sensu stricto.}},

Abstract = {{Boreal forests are currently facing intensified logging pressures, yet
   we know little about impacts of logging on the pollination community.
   This study extends research done immediately before and after logging,
   to consider its longer term effects. We censused bumble bee and flower
   communities 8-9 years after experimental variable retention logging.
   Harvest treatments left 0\%, 10-20\%, 50-75\%, or 100\% of the original
   trees after logging. Total bumble bee and floral abundances were
   increased by all forms of logging; however the floral community in
   retention cuts (i.e., 10-20\% and 50-75\% of trees remaining) was more
   similar to undisturbed controls than was the community in clearcuts.
   Bumble bees in low-retention treatments (i.e. 10-20\%) were in an ideal
   free distribution (IFD) with their floral resources, which allows for
   equal per-flower rate of visitation, regardless of local flower density.
   In clearcuts (i.e. 0\%) and high-retention areas (i.e. 50-75\%) bees
   were at an IFD with respect to the density of their floral resources,
   but undermatched (in 50-75\% treatments) or were resource-independent
   (in 0\% treatments) with respect to the energetic value of their floral
   resources. Bees in unlogged forest controls (i.e., 100\%) deviated from
   an IFD by undermatching. Overall, low-retention logging (10-20\%) was an
   improvement over clearcutting, because there was less change to the
   floral community, while still allowing for the achievement of an ideal
   free distribution. However, unlogged forest appeared to be negatively
   affected (in the lack of an IFD) by the presence of adjacent logged
   forests: numerical responses of bees to flowers were altered, with
   implications for bee foraging success and plant pollination service.
   Forest reserves should therefore incorporate buffer zones when adjacent
   to logged forest, to preserve the inter-relationships in their
   bee-influenced pollination community. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   mosaic. We demonstrate extensive cross-habitat gene flow by native bees,
   with pollination events spanning more than 1,800 m. Pollen was carried
   twice as far within shade coffee habitat as in nearby forest, and trees
   growing within shade coffee farms received pollen from a far greater
   number of sires than trees within remnant forest. The study shows that
   shade coffee habitats support specialized native pollinators that

Abstract = {{Ptilothrix fructifera is a solitary, oligolectic bee dependent on the
   flowers of Opuntia (Cactaceae). We conducted field studies to identify
   the mating tactics used by P. fructifera males and to determine whether
   factors such as male body size and available resource flowers contribute
   to variation in male mating tactic. Males in a population in southern
   Brazil showed pronounced variation in body size, but no distinct size
   classes. Larger males aggressively defended territories of flowering
   Opuntia plants, the sole pollen source for the females. Smaller males
   nonaggressively patrolled nonflowering shrubs growing between the nest
   aggregation and patches of Opuntia. Only unmated females were attractive
   to males. When offered to males in patrolled shrubs, up to eight males
   attempted to mate with the same female, but in territories only the
   territory owner mated with the introduced female. About 10 min after
   mating, females were unattractive to males. These results identify the
   species as monogamous and indicate that territoriality is an adaptive
   mating tactic. Experimental addition of Opuntia flowers to patrolled
   shrubs showed that nonterritorial males can switch to territorial
   behaviour. Thus, the number of available flowers together with the
   number of competitor males determines the ratio of territorial males to
   patrolling males at a given site. The experiment shows that male P.
   fructifera show a conditional reproductive strategy in which males adopt
   alternative tactics according to their size. (C) 2010 The Association

Abstract = {{Organic farming has often been found to provide benefits for
   biodiversity, but the benefits can depend on the species considered and
   characteristics of the surrounding landscape. In an intensively farmed
   area of Northeast Italy we investigated whether isolated organic farms,
   in a conventionally farmed landscape, provided local benefits for insect
   pollinators and pollination services. We quantified the relative effects
   of local management (i.e. the farm system), landscape management
   (proportion of surrounding uncultivated land) and interactions between
   them. We compared six organic and six conventional vine fields. The
   proportion of surrounding uncultivated land was calculated for each site
   at radii of 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. The organic fields did not differ
   from the conventional in their floral resources or proportion of
   surrounding uncultivated land. Data were collected on pollinator
   abundance and species richness, visitation rates to, and pollination of
   experimental potted plants. None of these factors were significantly
   affected by the farming system. The abundance of visits to the potted
   plants in the conventional fields tended to be negatively affected by
   the proportion of surrounding uncultivated land. The proportion fruit
   set, weight of seeds per plant and seed weight in conventional and
   organic fields were all negatively affected by the proportion of
   surrounding uncultivated land. In vine fields the impact of the
   surrounding landscape was stronger than the local management.
   Enhancement of biodiversity through organic farming should not be
   assumed to be ubiquitous, as potential benefits may be offset by the
   crop type, organic-management practices and the specific habitat
   requirements in the surrounding landscape. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We present the first records on pollination biology of Jacquemontia

   Chapada Diamantina. Our objectives were to (1) characterise flower
   morphology and biology of J. montana; (2) sample flower visitors and (3)
   make inferences about potential pollinators, based on foraging
   behaviour. Observations and sampling were performed on two patches from
   8: 00 AM to 3: 30 PM, May 15(th) to 16(th), 2007. The corolla is bowl
   shaped, pentamerous, gamopetalous, actinomorphic, and yellow, with a
   mean diameter of 22.43 +/- 1.81 mm, the depth being variable during
   flower phases. Stigma receptivity lasted from 8: 00 AM-3:30 PM and
   pollen viability from 9: 00 AM-3: 30 PM Pollen. showed great decline in
   number but not in viability during anthesis. Nectarivorous (Coleoptera,
   Diptera, Hymenoptera) and herbivorous (Orthoptera) insects were found on
   the flowers. Both male and female bees (Dialictus spp., Robertson 1902)
   were the most frequent flower visitor. The bees' behaviour, and time
   spent on flowers, varied according to the resource gathered (i.e.,
   pollen or nectar). The Dialictus species are likely to be the main
   pollinator of J. montana, considering the frequency, contact with
   reproductive parts, and carrying only J. montana pollen spread over the
   ventral part of the thorax, abdomen and legs. Although not quantified,
   nectar may still be available in the afternoon, considering the
   behaviour of bees on flowers during this time. Pollen: ovule ration that

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{750-758}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis has been shown to enhance
   some plant traits to which pollinators are known to respond. Moreover,
   in gynodioecious species pollinators prefer hermaphrodite flowers over
   female ones, but the role of fungal symbiosis in sex-specific pollinator
   attraction is unknown.
   2. We examined how plant gender dimorphism and AM symbiosis affect
   floral visitors and reproductive output in the gynodioecious plant
   Geranium sylvaticum. Floral visitors were monitored in a common garden
   experiment using mycorrhizal plants inoculated with either Glomus
   claroideum or Glomus hoi and in non-mycorrhizal condition.
   3. We hypothesized that because of the larger flower display and pollen
   presence in hermaphrodites, (i) hermaphrodites receive more floral
   visitors than females. However, as females produce higher numbers of
   seeds than hermaphrodites, we predicted that (ii) effective pollinators
   visit both sexes equally and that (iii) AM symbiosis, although affecting
   floral characteristics and insect behaviour in general, should not have
   sex-specific effects on insects that transport pollen.
   4. Our results confirm the hypotheses as hermaphrodites received 1
   center dot 5 times as many floral visitors than females. However, the
   most important pollinator group, the bumblebees, did not prefer either
   sex, which may be important for the maintenance of both sexes in
   gynodioecious populations. We further corroborated that AM symbiosis,
   although affecting flower size and the amount of pollen, did not affect
   bumblebee behaviour, whereas other hymenopterans showed a deterrence for
   G. hoi inoculated plants.
   5. This work reports the impact of AM symbiosis on the behaviour of
   floral visitors in a sexually dimorphic plant species. Positive
   interactions between plants, floral visitors and AM have been documented
   previously. However, potential negative tritrophic interactions between
   plants, floral visitors and AM may also occur. Our results suggest that
   plant sex and the mycorrhizal status of the plant also influence floral
   visitor groups that are unlikely to carry out pollination. This may
   benefit the plants if these floral visitors carry fungal diseases and
   consume pollen and nectar without effectively vectoring pollen.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{222-228}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Despite a growing interest in forest canopy biology, very few studies
   have examined the vertical distribution of forest bees. In this study,
   bees were sampled using 12 pairs of flight-intercept traps suspended in
   the canopy (>= 15 m) and near the ground (0.5 m) in a bottomland
   hardwood forest in the southeastern United States.
   2. In total, 6653 bees from 5 families and 71 species were captured.
   Augochlora pura (Say) (Halictidae), accounted for over 91\% of all bees
   collected and was over 40 times more abundant on average in the canopy
   than near the ground.
   3. Even after removing A. pura from the dataset, bee abundance, richness
   and Shannon's diversity were considerably higher in the canopy than near
   the ground.
   4. According to both non-metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of
   similarities, the bee community in the canopy was distinct from that
   near the ground. Based on indicator species analysis, A. pura,
   Lasioglossum imitatum (Smith), Lasioglossum versatum sensu Mitch., and
   Lasioglossum zephyrum (Smith) were significantly associated with the
   canopy whereas Andrena personata Robertson and Lasioglossum macoupinense
   (Robertson) were significantly associated with the ground.
   5. Augochlora pura was consistently more abundant in the canopy than
   near the ground throughout the season, but was more so in mid-to-late
   summer (i.e., June-September), a period coinciding with low floral
   resource availability. As a group, the remaining bee community exhibited
   a similar pattern.
   6. We suspect that bees frequent the canopy, particularly during times
   of low nectar and pollen availability, to acquire non-floral resources
   such as honeydew and sap.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{P>1. There is considerable evidence for the negative impacts of habitat
   alteration on pollinators in highly disturbed regions of the world.
   However, it remains unclear whether these findings reflect a global
   crisis for crop pollination. Understanding the extent to which world
   agriculture is endangered by pollinator decline is essential if the
   economic valuation of nature is to be used to promote conservation.
   2. We assess the susceptibility to pollinator limitation of one of the
   most important tropical and subtropical fruit crops, mango Mangifera
   indica L., commonly planted in a region of South Africa located between
   two large biodiversity-rich protected natural areas. We conducted flower
   visitor surveys, exclusion experiments and spatial analysis of flower
   visitation and fruit production patterns.
   3. Our results show that both ants and flower visitors were effective
   pollinators of mango, the latter significantly declining (in abundance
   and species richness) with distance to natural habitat while ants were
   not affected. Neither the absence of pesticides nor the supplementation
   of flower visitors by using managed honeybees served to offset these
   negative impacts. Food-web data suggest that maintaining diversity of
   flower resources within farmland can help maintain pollinator
   communities.
   4. Moreover, models based exclusively on pollinator abundance
   underestimated the negative effect of distance from natural habitat on
   production (42\% less at 500 m from natural habitat). As soil nutrient
   levels and water content are regularly measured and corrected in all
   study sites, these results suggest that pollinator diversity may also be
   important.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides one of the first
   examples of marked pollination limitation in farms surrounded by
   well-protected natural habitat. For mango farming to be sustainable, it
   is essential to limit contiguous growth of farmland and consider
   practices that restore the complexity of plant-pollinator networks
   within farms, for example through the creation and maintenance of
   pollinator-friendly areas. By highlighting the economic gains of
   adopting pollinator-friendly practices in agriculture, this work
   contributes to a growing body of studies that reveal that making
   farmland more suitable for pollinators benefits both agriculture and
   nature conservation.}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Tomato flowers (Solanum lycopersicum L.) in greenhouses require assisted
   pollination. Compared with pollination using a vibration wand,
   pollination by buzz pollinating bees results in improved seed set and
   consequently, higher fruit weight. We investigated whether there are
   further chemical and sensory differences between bee- and
   wand-pollinated cherry tomatoes, Solanum lycopersicum variety Conchita.
   The pollination method did not result in significant differences in
   concentration of soluble solids and titratable acidity. However, the
   concentration of soluble solids was significantly positively correlated
   with seed number. We suggest that an increase in the amount of soluble
   solids in the locular area, due to increased seed numbers, is
   counteracted by the effects of seed numbers on the growth of the walls,
   which occurs through cell elongation. In the sensory part of this study,
   a large, untrained panel significantly preferred bee-pollinated over
   wand-pollinated tomatoes and classified bee-pollinated tomatoes as
   having more depth of flavor than wand-pollinated tomatoes. Thus,
   bee-pollinated tomatoes taste better than wand-pollinated tomatoes, and
   it is likely that the sensory differences between the two groups of
   tomatoes are mediated through effects of pollination treatment on seed
   numbers. Future chemical and sensory studies of fresh tomatoes should
   take into account the effects of seed numbers and their possible effect
   on the distribution of chemical compounds within tomatoes.}},

Title = {{Two Bee-Pollinated Plant Species Show Higher Seed Production when Grown
   in Gardens Compared to Arable Farmland}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Insect pollinator abundance, in particular that of bees, has
   been shown to be high where there is a superabundance of floral
   resources; for example in association with mass-flowering crops and also
   in gardens where flowering plants are often densely planted. Since land
   management affects pollinator numbers, it is also likely to affect the
   resultant pollination of plants growing in these habitats. We
   hypothesised that the seed or fruit set of two plant species, typically
   pollinated by bumblebees and/or honeybees might respond in one of two
   ways: 1) pollination success could be reduced when growing in a
   floriferous environment, via competition for pollinators, or 2)
   pollination success could be enhanced because of increased pollinator
   abundance in the vicinity.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We compared the pollination success of
   experimental plants of Glechoma hederacea L. and Lotus corniculatus L.
   growing in gardens and arable farmland. On the farms, the plants were
   placed either next to a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape, Brassica
   napus L. or field beans, Vicia faba L.) or next to a cereal crop (wheat,
   Triticum spp.). Seed set of G. hederacea and fruit set of L.
   corniculatus were significantly higher in gardens compared to arable
   farmland. There was no significant difference in pollination success of
   G. hederacea when grown next to different crops, but for L.
   corniculatus, fruit set was higher in the plants growing next to oilseed
   rape when the crop was in flower.
   Conclusions/Significance: The results show that pollination services can
   limit fruit set of wild plants in arable farmland, but there is some
   evidence that the presence of a flowering crop can facilitate their
   pollination (depending on species and season). We have also demonstrated
   that gardens are not only beneficial to pollinators, but also to the
   process of pollination.}},

   network of plant-pollinator interactions in two types of field margin: a
   four-species pollen and nectar mix and a six-species wildflower mix.
   While periods without flowering resources and periods with no food were
   rare, curtailment of the field season was very common for the
   bumble-bees in both mixtures. The effect of this, however, could be
   ameliorated by adding extra species at the start and end of the

Abstract = {{The use of pesticides to protect crops against plagues and insects is
   one of the most important ways to assure agricultural quality and
   productivity. However, bad application practices may cause the
   contamination of different environmental compartments and animal
   species, as a consequence of migration or accumulation of those
   compounds.
   Fipronil, imidacloprid and thiametoxam are systemic or systemic-like
   insecticides widely used in maize crops. Their heavy action in the
   nervous system of target insects also means a high toxicity to nontarget
   pollinator insects such as honey bees which can get in touch with them
   through pollen and nectar during foraging activities. These insecticides
   have even been suspected to cause a significant decrease of honeybee
   colonies that has been observed in many countries since the past decade.
   Since September 1 st 2008, the European Commission set new MRLs in food
   and feed of plant and animal origin. The pesticides included in this
   study have MRLs in honey and pollen between 10 and 50 ng g(-1).
   In the present work, an analytical method was developed with the aim of
   determining residues of fipronil and some of its metabolites (fipronil
   sulfone, fipronil sulfide, fipronil desulfinyl and fipronil
   carboxamide), thiamethoxam and imidacloprid in honey and pollen samples.
   The extraction optimization was performed using a Doehlert experimental
   design by studying two factors, the mixture and the ratio of solvents
   used. Prior to the extraction procedure, raw hive samples containing
   honey, pollen and wax were centrifuged at 4000 rpm. The upper solid
   material was removed, and 1 g of the lower phase was mixed with 3 mL of
   the optimized mixture of methanol/water (10/90). The extract was passed
   through a florisil cartridge and the target compounds were eluted with
   methanol and analysed by LC-MS/MS in selective reaction monitoring (SRM)
   mode.
   The method was validated according to the guidelines included in the
   SANCO/10684/2009 document and the ISO 11843 standard for the following
   parameters: decision limit (CC alpha), detection capability (CC beta),
   recovery, repeatability and reproducibility at 0.5, 1 and 1.5 folds the
   MRLs. Ion suppression/enhancement effects into the ion source were also
   assessed.
   The CC beta values were included between 0.83 and 4.83 ng g(-1), well
   below the current MRLs.
   The validated method was applied to the determination of the target
   pesticides in 91 samples collected in colonies from 73 apiaries of NW
   Spain (two sampling campaigns during 2008). None of the target
   insecticides were detected among all the collected samples. (C) 2010

Title = {{THE EVOLUTION OF CAYAPONIA (CUCURBITACEAE): REPEATED SHIFTS FROM BAT TO
   BEE POLLINATION AND LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL TO AFRICA 2-5 MILLION YEARS
   AGO}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: The Cucurbitaceae genus Cayaponia comprises
   similar to 60 species that occur from Uruguay to the southern United
   States and the Caribbean; C. africana occurs in West Africa and on
   Madagascar. Pollination is by bees or bats, raising the question of the
   evolutionary direction and frequency of pollinator shifts. Studies that
   investigated such shifts in other clades have suggested that bat
   pollination might be an evolutionary end point.
   Methods: Plastid and nuclear DNA sequences were obtained for 50
   accessions representing 30 species of Cayaponia and close relatives, and
   analyses were carried out to test monophyly, infer divergence times, and
   reconstruct ancestral states for habitat preferences and pollination
   modes.
   Key results: The phylogeny shows that Cayaponia is monophyletic as long
   as Selysia (a genus with four species from Central and South America) is
   included. The required nomenclatural transfers are made in this paper.
   African and Madagascan accessions of C. africana form a clade that is
   part of a polytomy with Caribbean and South American species, and the
   inferred divergence time of 2-5 Ma implies a transoceanic dispersal
   event from the New World to Africa. The ancestral state reconstructions
   suggest that Cayaponia originated in tropical forests from where open
   savannas were reached several times and that bee pollination arose from
   bat pollination, roughly concomitant with the shifts from forests to
   savanna habitats.
   Conclusions: Cayaponia provides the first example of evolutionary
   transitions from bat to bee pollination as well as another instance of
   transoceanic dispersal from the New World to Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The close relationship between distylic Cordia leucocephala and the bee
   Ceblurgus longipalpis, both endemic to the Caatinga, north-east Brazil,
   was investigated, emphasizing reproductive dependence, morphological
   adaptations of the partners, and pollen flow.
   In the municipality of Pedra, in the Caatinga of Pernambuco, the
   breeding system and reproductive success of C. leucocephala, its
   interaction with flower visitors and inter- and intramorph pollen flow
   were determined.
   The bee Ceblurgus longipalpis, the unique flower visitor and effective
   pollinator of self-incompatible Cordia leucocephala, presents
   morphological features adapted to exploit hidden pollen and nectar in
   the long and narrow corolla tubes. Pollen of low-level anthers is
   collected with hairs on prolonged mouthparts and pollen of high-level
   anthers with clypeus, mandibles, and labrum, showing pollen removal from
   both levels with the same effectiveness. In both morphs, this results in
   similar legitimate, i.e. intermorph cross-pollen flow. Illegitimate
   pollen flow to stigmas of pin flowers, however, was much higher than to
   stigmas of thrum flowers. Moreover, more illegitimate pollen was
   transported to stigmas of pin and less to those of thrum flowers when
   compared with legitimate pollen flow.
   The study reveals a one-to-one reproductive inter-dependence between
   both partners. Data indicate that this relationship between bee species
   and plant species is one of the rare cases of monolecty among bees.
   Monotypic Ceblurgus longipalpis, the only rophitine species of Brazil,
   evolved prolonged mouthparts rare among short-tongued bees that enable
   them to access pollen from flowers with short-level anthers hidden for
   bees of other species, and nectar at the base of the flower tube.}},

Abstract = {{Local habitat structure and resource availability appear to be of great
   importance for the diversity, abundance, and community structure of
   bees. We examined the contribution of three different habitat types
   (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a
   tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed
   differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between
   nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and
   specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and
   spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general
   and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we
   found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results
   suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest

   forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers
   and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time.
   Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density

   a ``pollinator rescue{''} which supports bee communities in the natural

Abstract = {{Stylosanthes viscosa is a common `herb' in the tropical sand dunes of
   the Brazilian coast with clumped distribution in urban sand dunes of
   Salvador, BA. Its tiny keel flower with a very small amount of nectar
   hidden inside the corolla tube, a single open flower/inflorescence/day
   and the low floral density altogether should not be attractive to large
   bees. This should be true mainly upon the high-demanded energy for
   thermoregulation within the tropical sand dunes. Contrary to this
   expectation, most of the bee species sampled on S. viscosa flowers were
   medium to large sized bees and harvested nectar in legitimate visits by
   activating the keel's pollination mechanism of flowers. However, the
   keel was always inactivated after being visited by the enormous and
   frequent (78\%) Xylocopa bees. All the flowers visited by these bees
   (including those with inactivated keels), and those experimentally
   protected from bee visiting produced fruits (100\%). The specialized
   embolus mechanism of the anthers assures self-pollination. Because of
   this autonomous self-pollination and self-compatibility it was not
   possible to discriminate the relative importance of both facilitated
   self-pollination and cross-pollination by bees. Nevertheless, the large
   Xylocopa bees didn't limit self-pollination. Xylocopa cearensis was the
   most abundant bee (63\%) and it visited several flowers (13.0 +/- 4.27)
   in each flight route in the same clump, in spite of the low floral
   density therein (5 to 20 flowers.m(-2)). Flight distances between
   successive flowers varied between one and two meters (49\%), and so they
   were higher than would be possible (15 to 70 cm) given the floral
   density in the clumps. The flight routes were directional, and most of
   shifting direction between successive flowers was below 90 degrees with
   high frequency of small angles (<30 degrees). This general pattern is
   explained by foraging optimization with adjustments to critical resource
   level thresholds. Paradoxically, floral biology and flowering pattern of
   S. viscosa should discourage the largest dune dweller bees, but this
   strategy works just temporarily. In this melittophilous species, the
   autonomous self-pollination (assured by the embolus) can be better
   explained by the automatic selection hypothesis rather than by
   reproductive assurance hypothesis, considering the availability of large
   bee pollinators in the tropical dunes.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of Weigela middendorffiana change the color from yellow to red.
   The previous study revealed that red-phase flowers no longer have sexual
   function and nectar, and bumblebees selectively visit yellow-phase
   flowers. The present study examined how retaining color-changed flowers
   can regulate the foraging behavior of bumblebees and pollen transport
   among flowers within (geitonogamous pollination) and between
   (outcrossing pollination) plants and how the behavior is influenced by
   display size (i.e., number of functional flowers) and visitation
   frequency. The visitation frequencies of bumblebees to plants and
   successive flower probes within plants were observed in the field using
   plants whose flower number and composition of the two color-phase
   flowers had been manipulated. To evaluate pollination efficiency over
   multiple pollinator visits, a pollen transport model was constructed
   based on the observed bumblebee behavior. In the simulation, three
   flowering patterns associated with display size and existence of
   color-changed flowers were postulated as follows: Type 1, large display
   (100 functional flowers) and no retention of color-changed flowers; Type
   2, small display (50 functional flowers) and retention of color-changed
   flowers (50 old flowers), and; Type 3, large display (100 functional
   flowers) and retention of color-changed flowers (100 old flowers).
   Color-changed flowers did not contribute to increasing bumblebee
   attraction at a distance but reduced the number of successive flower
   probes within plants. Comparisons of pollen transfer between Types 1 and
   3 revealed that the retention of color-changed flowers did not influence
   the total amount of pollen exported when pollinator visits were abundant
   (> 100 visits) but decreased geitonogamous pollination. Comparisons
   between Types 2 and 3 revealed that the discouragement effect of floral
   color change on successive probes accelerated in plants with a large
   display size. Overall, the floral color change strategy contributed to
   reduce geitonogamous pollination, but its effectiveness was highly
   sensitive to display size and pollinator frequency.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation genetics of bees is of particular interest because many
   bee species are in decline, so jeopardizing the essential ecosystem
   service of plant pollination that they provide. In addition, as social
   haplodiploids, inbred bees may be vulnerable to the extra genetic load
   represented by the production of sterile diploid males. Using
   microsatellite markers, we investigated the genetic structure of
   populations of the Great Yellow Bumblebee (Bombus distinguendus
   Morawitz) in the UK, where this species has undergone a precipitous
   decline. By means of a mixture of analytical methods and simulation, we
   also extended-and then applied-genetic methods for estimating foraging
   distance and nest density in wild bees. B. distinguendus populations
   were characterized by low expected heterozygosity and allelic richness,
   inbreeding coefficients not significantly different from zero, absence
   of detected diploid males, absence of substantial demographic
   bottlenecking, and population substructuring at large (c. 100+ km) but
   not small (10s of km) spatial scales. The minimum average effective
   population size at our sampling sites was low (c. 25). In coastal
   grassland (machair), the estimated modal foraging distance of workers
   was 391 m, with 95\% of foraging activity occurring within 955 m of the
   nest, and estimated nest density was 19.3 nests km-2. These findings
   show that B. distinguendus exhibits some genetic features of scarce,
   declining or fragmented populations. Moreover, B. distinguendus workers
   appear to forage over above-average distances and nests remain thinly
   distributed even in current strongholds. These considerations should
   inform future conservation actions for this and similar species.}},

Abstract = {{It is controversial the role played by Meliponina bees in the
   pollination of mass flowering trees with small generalized flowers
   (FMPG), very common group of trees in the tropical forest canopy. The
   species richness and relative abundance of flower visiting insects of
   the mass flowering tree Stryphnodendron pulcherrimum were measured to
   test the hypothesis of tight ecological association between these
   generalist bees and FM PG and to evaluate the effect of this
   relationship upon the reproductive success variation among tree crowns.
   The flower visiting insects were sampled on 10 flowering tree crowns at
   the Atlantic Rainforest ill southern Bahia. Altogether, 553 visiting
   insects were collected during the flowering period of S. pulcherrimum:
   293 (52\%) Meliponina bees out of 438 bees (79.4\%). All tree crowns
   were visited by Meliponina, with the proportion of these bees ranging
   from 27\% to 87\%. The tight ecological association between FM PG trees
   and Meliponina bees is supported by the observed pattern of spatial
   relationship. Both the relationship between variation of fruit set among
   tree crowns and species richness (r = 0.3579; P = 0.3098) or relative
   abundance (r = 0.3070; P = 0.3881) of Meliponina were not statistically
   significant. Likely a threshold of minimum relative abundance combined
   with the absolute abundance of these bees explain the fruit set
   variation among tree crowns of S. pulcherrimum, even by
   self-pollination. We tested this assumption with a preliminary analysis
   of Melipona bee genera distribution among the tree crowns.}},

Title = {{Compatibility of traditional and novel acaricides with bumblebees
   (Bombus terrestris): a first laboratory assessment of toxicity and
   sublethal effects}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This project assessed the potential hazards of different
   classical and novel acaricides against an important non-target and
   beneficial insect for the pollination of wild flowers and cultivated
   crops, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L). Twenty-three acaricides used
   commercially in the control of phytophagous mites (Acari) were tested in
   greenhouses and/or the open field. Side effects included acute mortality
   and also sublethal effects on nest reproduction. The different compounds
   were administered in the laboratory via three different worst-case field
   scenario routes of exposure: dermal contact and orally via the drinking
   of treated sugar water and via treated pollen. The compounds were tested
   at their respective maximum field recommended concentration (MFRC), and,
   when strong lethal effects were observed, a dose-response assay with a
   dilution series of the MFRC was undertaken to calculate LC50 values.
   RESULTS: From the different acaricide classes, several chemistries
   caused high levels of acute toxicity in bumblebee workers, especially
   bifenthrin and abamectin which resulted in 100\% mortality by contact.
   In addition, several acaricides tested were found to have a detrimental
   effect on drone production. For oral exposures via treated sugar water,
   the dose-response assay showed the LC50 values for abamectin,
   bifenazate, bifenthrin and etoxazole to be 1/15 MFRC (1.17 mg Al L-1),
   1/10 MFRC (9.6 mg Al L-1), 1/83 MFRC (0.36 mg Al L-1) and 1/13 MFRC (4.4
   mg Al L-1) respectively, indicating that their use should be carefully
   evaluated.
   CONCLUSION: Overall, the results suggest that most of the acaricides
   tested are compatible with bumblebees, with the exceptions of abamectin,
   bifenazate, bifenthrin and etoxazole. However, the risks also depended
   on the type of treatment. As a result, the sugar water treatment seems
   to present the worst-case situation of exposure, indicating that this
   approach is suitable for determining the hazards of pesticides against
   bumblebees. Finally, it is suggested that future tier testing under more
   field-related conditions is required for a final decision of their
   risks. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that there is a geographic dichotomy in the
   pollination systems of chiropterophilous columnar cacti: in
   intra-tropical areas they are pollinated almost exclusively by bats,
   whereas in extratropical areas they are pollinated by bats, birds and
   bees. However, currently the studies are clumped both taxonomically
   (mainly Pachycereeae species) and geographically (mainly in the Tehuacan
   Valley and the Sonoran Desert). This clumping limits the possibility of
   generalising the pattern to other regions or cactus tribes. Only four of
   the 36 chiropterophilous cacti in Pilosocereus have been studied.
   Despite the tropical distribution of two Pilosocereus species, bees
   account for 40-100\% of their fruit set. We examined how specialised is
   the pollination system of P. leucocephalus in eastern Mexico. As we
   studied tropical populations, we expected a bat-specialised pollination
   system. However, previous studies of Pilosocereus suggest that a
   generalised pollination system is also possible. We found that this
   cactus is mainly bat-pollinated (bats account for 33-65\% of fruit set);
   although to a lesser degree, diurnal visitors also caused some fruit set
   (7-15\%). Diurnal visitors were more effective in populations containing
   honeybee hives. P. leucocephalus is partially self-compatible (14-18\%
   of fructification) but unable to set fruit without visitors. Despite the
   variation in pollination system, P. leucocephalus shows more affinity
   with other columnar cacti from tropical regions than with those from
   extratropical regions. Although we report here that a new species of
   tropical Pilosocereus is relatively bat-specialised, this Cereeae genus
   is more flexible in its pollination system than the Pachycereeae genera.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the reproductive biology of three sympatric Araceae species,
   Anthurium sagittatum, A. thrinax and Spathiphyllum humboldtii in French
   Guiana. The plants flowered simultaneously and were visited by
   scent-collecting male euglossine bees, which were apparently their major
   pollinators. In total, each species was visited by 3-7 euglossine
   species, and 2-3 euglossine species accounted for at least 80\% of all
   flower visits, with visits being plant species-specific. Floral scent
   consisted of 6-10 main compounds, which made up 76-94\% of the total
   amount of volatiles and were specific in these high amounts to each
   plant species. We suggest that the different floral scents lead to clear
   separation of the main pollinating euglossine species, providing a
   directed and efficient intraspecific pollen flow that results in high
   reproductive success. Since the simple floral (inflorescence) morphology
   of the studied plants does not support any morphological mechanisms to
   exclude visitors, as for example in euglossine-pollinated perfume
   orchids, floral scent might be of major importance for the reproductive
   isolation and sympatric occurrence of these plants.}},

   (Nesoprosopis) bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae)}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: The past several years have seen a flurry of papers seeking
   to clarify the utility and limits of DNA barcoding, particularly in
   areas such as species discovery and paralogy due to nuclear pseudogenes.
   Heteroplasmy, the coexistence of multiple mitochondrial haplotypes in a
   single organism, has been cited as a potentially serious problem for DNA
   barcoding but its effect on identification accuracy has not been tested.
   In addition, few studies of barcoding have tested a large group of
   closely-related species with a well-established morphological taxonomy.
   In this study we examine both of these issues, by densely sampling the
   Hawaiian Hylaeus bee radiation.
   Results: Individuals from 21 of the 49 a priori morphologically-defined
   species exhibited coding sequence heteroplasmy at levels of 1-6\% or
   more. All homoplasmic species were successfully identified by COI using
   standard methods of analysis, but only 71\% of heteroplasmic species.
   The success rate in identifying heteroplasmic species was increased to
   86\% by treating polymorphisms as character states rather than
   ambiguities. Nuclear pseudogenes (numts) were also present in four
   species, and were distinguishable from heteroplasmic sequences by
   patterns of nucleotide and amino acid change.
   Conclusions: Heteroplasmy significantly decreased the reliability of
   species identification. In addition, the practical issue of dealing with
   large numbers of polymorphisms- and resulting increased time and labor
   required - makes the development of DNA barcode databases considerably
   more complex than has previously been suggested. The impact of
   heteroplasmy on the utility of DNA barcoding as a bulk specimen
   identification tool will depend upon its frequency across populations,
   which remains unknown. However, DNA barcoding is still likely to remain
   an important identification tool for those species that are difficult or
   impossible to identify through morphology, as is the case for the
   ecologically important solitary bee fauna.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{717-726}},

Abstract = {{One floral characteristic associated with bat pollination
   (chiropterophily) is copious pollen production, a pattern we confirmed
   in a local comparison of hummingbird- and bat-adapted flowers from a
   cloud forest site in Ecuador. Previous authors have suggested that
   wasteful pollen transfer by bats accounted for the pattern. Here we
   propose and test a new hypothesis: bats select for increased pollen
   production because they can efficiently transfer larger amounts of
   pollen, which leads to a more linear male fitness gain curve for
   bat-pollinated plants. Flight cage experiments with artificial flowers
   and flowers of Aphelandra acanthus provide support for this hypothesis;
   in both instances, the amount of pollen delivered to stigmas by birds is
   not related to the amount of pollen removed from anthers on the previous
   visit, while the same function for bats increases linearly. Thus,
   increased pollen production will be linearly related to increased male
   reproductive success for bat flowers, while for bird flowers, increased
   pollen production leads to rapidly diminishing fitness returns. We
   speculate that fur takes up and holds more pollen than feathers, which
   seem to readily shed excess grains. Our gain-curve hypothesis may also
   explain why evolutionary shifts from bird to bat pollination seem more
   common than shifts in the opposite direction.}},

Abstract = {{Natural small, xeric hill prairies in forested landscapes throughout the
   Midwest United States often contain high diversity and unique species of
   some organisms because of their unusual landscape context and
   microclimate. We measured the diversity, richness, and abundance of the
   bee communities of five hill prairies located in northeastern Iowa and
   we compared these to values for large prairie preserves in northwestern
   Iowa, using a Monte Carlo resampling approach to standardize sampling
   effort between habitat types. We also measured the diversity and
   richness of the flowering forb communities at the hill prairies and we
   quantified percentage of the landscape at a 1 km radius in different
   landscape elements. Bee diversity at the five hill prairies spanned the
   range of diversity values for large prairies preserves, so although the
   hill prairies are small (< 5 ha), their bee communities are not
   uniformly depauparate compared to larger western prairie preserves. Bee
   diversity was significantly related to flowering forb diversity, and may
   have been influenced by landscape features within 1 km-particularly the
   percentage of agricultural row crops and open water, which may
   negatively affect bee diversity at the sites. Iowa's hill prairie bee
   communities were largely composed of widespread eastern species,
   although about 10\% of the bee species have more northern or western
   ranges and appear to be taking advantage of the region's unique habitat
   features. Given the dependence of the bee communities on the plant
   diversity of the sites, management of the plant community to maintain
   its diversity will also likely benefit bee diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Though it is undoubted that tropical bees are influenced by habitat
   composition, few studies have investigated the relative importance of
   both local and landscape-level habitat parameters in supporting large
   and diverse bee communities. The conservation of native bee communities
   within agroforestry landscapes is particularly urgent given the
   importance of pollination services within these systems. In this study,
   we examined tropical bee communities within a largely deforested shade
   coffee-growing region in Chiapas, Mexico. We used regression tree
   modeling to examine the response of bee functional groups to local and
   landscape-level habitat management. Our models revealed that the most
   predictive factors for bee abundance and species richness were the
   number of tree species, the number of tree species in flower, and the
   canopy cover of the local agroforestry landscape. Solitary bees were
   most abundant in habitats with high canopy cover, while social bees were
   most abundant in habitats with greater tree species richness.
   Cavity-nesting and wood-nesting bee abundance was positively affected by
   the amount of canopy cover in the farm, while ground-nesting bees were
   most abundant in habitats with a large number of tree species in flower.
   Our results demonstrate that across bee sociality groups, nesting
   guilds, and tribes, the most critical factor impacting native bee
   communities was within-farm local vegetation management. These results
   reveal the important role that agroforestry managers can have on
   biodiversity conservation, and the potential contribution they can make
   by creating resource-rich agricultural matrices. Specifically, our
   findings highlight the importance of diverse overstory tree management
   in supporting native bee communities within tropical agroforestry

Abstract = {{This study investigated the role of the invasive mallow Lavatera arborea
   in the terrestrial ecosystem of a flourishing seabird island in SE New
   Zealand using natural abundance stable isotope ratios ((13)C/(12)C;
   (15)N/(14)N, reported as delta(13)C and delta(15)N). Foliage samples of
   L. arborea came from transects encompassing three distinct environments
   (plateau, slope, storm-washed flat) across the island. Samples of
   potential marine nutrient sources (beach-cast kelp; seabirds using the
   island) were also collected, to contextualise the L. arborea data.
   Samples of invertebrate taxa (exotic and indigenous) from multiple
   ecosystem guilds were hand-collected; a bee, a sap-sucking Homoptera, a
   litter-feeding tenebrionid beetle, various carrion-feeding flies, a
   predatory carabid beetle, a salticid spider, and (from a seabird
   cadaver) Dermestes sp. exuviae. Discarded skins from the gecko
   Hoplodactylus maculatus were collected from moulting sites. Highly
   enriched delta(15)N values showed that L. arborea from all three
   environments utilised seabird N, even though breeding seabirds were
   absent from the storm-washed flat. The isotopic signatures of the
   Homoptera, and the tenebrionid and carabid beetles could be accounted
   for entirely by food webs based on L. arborea. Bee and salticid spider
   isotopic signatures could be accounted for by varying contributions from
   L. arborea. The flies and Dermestes were (as expected) linked to carrion
   from either the island or the adjacent mainland. In contrast, gecko data
   indicated direct dependence on seabirds, although the exact relationship
   was unclear. Our study therefore showed that L. arborea is an integral
   part of the terrestrial ecosystem of the island across multiple trophic
   levels from pollinators to top-level predators.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean flora is spectacularly rich in orchid species that
   have evolved remarkable adaptations to their environment. Orchids have
   complex and delicate interactions with their pollinators, which makes
   them particularly prone to local extinction. Conservation actions should
   be encouraged for a range of endangered Mediterranean orchid species,
   but the current taxonomic confusion in several genera and the apparent
   disagreement among orchid taxonomists make the situation particularly
   confusing from a conservation perspective. In this review, we document
   how the different pollination syndromes of Mediterranean orchids (nectar
   reward, shelter offering, food deception and sexual deception) can have
   a profound impact on the type of reproductive barriers among species, on
   floral phenotypic variation as we perceive it, on potentially related
   processes of species sorting and extinction and, consequently, should
   have a strong influence on the related conservation management programs.
   We also highlight that the majority of Mediterranean orchids are
   pollinated by specialised bees often occupying otherwise narrow
   ecological niches (e.g. pollen specialisation, brood cell parasites,
   specific nesting site). This condition makes the orchid-pollinator
   interactions very fragile and several orchid species prone to local
   extinction. We illustrate this phenomenon by a selection of case studies
   that show how the adequate integration of the ecological
   requirements/traits of the orchids and their associated pollinators into
   conservation actions could help protect endangered species and ensure
   the sustainability of the often complex local pollination web.}},

Abstract = {{In places where farming has become uniform, the lives of the pollinating
   animals and of the game animals have become increasingly precarious,
   because of the rarefaction and the dispersion of their resources and

   environments to these animals, provided they are adequately managed.
   This paper details some technical elements for the management of grass
   covers in the farming systems that makes them propitious to the bees and
   to the small lowland fauna, two animal communities whose protection is
   the object of numerous planned actions. Grass infrastructures provide
   heterogeneity, thus ensuring a functional role in the trophic networks,
   acting as zones of shelter, of feeding and of circulation. The benefits
   of the grass covers depend on their type (whether the plants are sown or
   voluntary) and their duration. It is henceforth necessary to adopt a
   more systemic approach in order to identify the management practices
   that will serve several purposes at the same time (preservation of
   different animal communities, environment, soil fertility, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{Humboldtia brunonis (Fabaceae, Caesalpinioideae) is a dominant
   self-incompatible ant-plant or myrmecophyte, growing as an understorey
   tree in high-density patches. It is endemic to the biodiversity hotspot
   of the southern Western Ghats of India and, besides ants, harbours many
   endemic invertebrate taxa, such as bees that pollinate it as well as
   arboreal earthworms, within swollen hollow stem internodes called
   domatia. Using inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, three
   geographically separated populations were found to be multiclonal,
   characterized by high levels of clonal diversity. Values for the Simpson
   diversity index ranged between 0.764 and 0.964, and for Fager's evenness
   index between 0.00 and 0.036 for neighbourhoods within populations. This
   myrmecophyte was found to combine sexual recruitment (66.7\%) and clonal
   production (33.3\%) as methods of reproduction. Moderate amounts of
   genetic diversity at the species level were observed, with 52.63\%
   polymorphism, and moderate values of Shannon's diversity index (0.1895)
   as well as of Nei's gene diversity (0.1186). In each population,
   observed genotypic diversity was significantly lower than expected,
   indicating significant genetic structure. Neighbour-joining trees
   demonstrated that Agumbe, which is the most northern population examined
   and geographically twice as far away from the other two populations,
   grouped separately and with larger bootstrap support from a larger
   cluster consisting of the Sampaji and Solaikolli populations, which are
   closer to each other geographically. Some neighbourhoods within each
   population showed spatial genetic structure even at small spatial scales
   of <5 m. A combination of clonality and short-distance pollen movement
   by small pollinating bees (Braunsapis puangensis) coupled with primary
   ballistic seed dispersal, and possible secondary seed dispersal by
   rodents, may contribute to spatial genetic structure at such small
   scales. The clonality of H. brunonis may be a factor that contributes to
   its dominance in Western Ghat forests where it supports a rich diversity
   of invertebrate fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar production has been proposed as an adaptation to attract
   pollinators that benefit from this resource. Energetic investments may
   be expensive, so some species such as Prosopis glandulosa have developed
   a dimorphic system of nectar production, which is expected to affect
   floral visitor behaviour and then plant fitness. We quantified bee
   diversity during a 2 year period in a population of the honey mesquite
   in order to determine changes in bee diversity due to the presence of
   nectar, bee preferences to collect either nectar of pollen, and to
   determine between year variations of bee faunas. Floral visitors were
   captured at three different times of the day during the flowering
   seasons of 1994 and 1995, in a population of Prosopis glandulosa which
   has a 1:1 proportion of nectar: nectarless individuals. Pollinators were
   clearly distinct between nectar morphs, bee species diversity and
   relative abundance of visits were significantly greater on nectarful
   than on nectarless plants, with species on nectarless individuals being
   a subset of those in the nectarful morph. Our results suggest
   differences in the function of floral rewards (i.e., nectar and pollen)
   to attract floral visitors. For the Chihuahuan arid environment,
   mesquite provides floral rewards with ease, quantity and quality for

Abstract = {{Delayed selfing could provide ovules with an opportunity to be
   fertilized as a means of ``pollination assurance{''} before the flowers
   wilt. It could, thus, be regarded as an adaptation to unpredictable
   pollinator environments. Within the alpine biennial Gentianopsis
   paludosa, the showy flowers and herkogamy at the early stage of a
   flower's life cycle may favor outcrossing. As the flower ages, anthers
   contact the central stigma due to the elongation of all filaments,
   resulting in autonomous selfing. Flower visitors are extremely rare in a
   high altitude population; and examination of the mating system indicates
   that G. paludosa is self-pollinated under natural conditions in this
   population. While at the lower altitude, the bumblebee visitation rate
   is relatively high but possibly unreliable. Stigma receptivity is the
   highest on the third day of anthesis, and decreases thereafter. Pollen
   viability is the highest when flowers open, and gradually decreases
   later. Self-pollination of G. paludosa occurs at the late stage of a
   flower's lifecycle when stigma receptivity and pollen viability have
   both decreased, suggesting delayed selfing and assurance of seed
   production. This delayed selfing could assure seed production under the
   constraints of pollinator scarcity, but ensure outcrossing when
   pollinators were available. Such a flexible pollination mechanism is
   highly adaptive in the alpine environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the mycoheterotrophic Voyria caerulea, V.

   characteristics indicated adaptations to long-tongued flower visitors.
   The three species possess large, conspicuously colored flowers that
   produced sucrose-rich nectar (concentrations: 16.4\%-23.9\%) and emit a
   rosy floral perfume with a citrus-related aspect, dominated by
   terpenoids. Principal scent compounds of V. caerulea and V rosea were
   (E)-nerolidol and geraniol, and (E)-8-oxo-beta-farnesene
   {[}(E)-2,6-dimethyl-10-methylenedodeca-2,6,11-trien-5-one, a new natural
   product] and (E,E)-farnesyl acetate in V. clavata. Germinating pollen
   grains were observed in the anthers of all species, forming large
   interwoven clumps that were transferred by the pollinators as a unit. In
   V. caerulea and V. rosea, stamens and stigmas were positioned close
   together, enabling the plants to self-pollinate. In contrast, male and
   female organs are widely separated in V. clavaia. Pollen to ovule ratios
   of all species were low (33-78), indicating that pollen transfer (either
   by selling or by outcrossing) is very efficient. Flower visitors were
   butterflies (V. caerulea, V. rosea) and/or long-tongued bees of the
   genus Euglossa (V. clavata, V. rosea). Nevertheless, Voyria caerulea and
   V. rosea were visited only rarely and irregularly. We suggest that these
   two species follow a mixed selfing-outcrossing strategy to ensure seed
   production when pollen transfer by visitors fails. In contrast, V.
   clavata showed a high degree of specialization towards
   euglossine-pollinators, which were frequent visitors. The close
   plant-pollinator interaction increases the probability of outcrossings
   and might have enabled this species to completely rely on pollinators
   for reproduction. Average seed set in the studied species ranged between
   36\% and 49\% and was very variable among individuals, probably due to
   resource-limitation. The capsules of V. caerulea and V. clavata showed
   characteristics of endozoochorous dispersal and were frequently found
   damaged by possible rodent dispersal agents.}},

Abstract = {{Managed field margins offer a means of reducing the impact of
   agricultural monocultures within intensively managed environments. By
   providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with
   them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination
   services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture
   on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known
   that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as
   neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of
   flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of
   monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse
   effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field
   margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for
   wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of
   density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of
   field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical
   simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of
   pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape
   consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins
   containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops
   experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a
   limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and
   decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in
   pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width
   increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional
   effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild
   flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring
   monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the
   monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers
   had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the
   monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only
   has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance
   is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design
   might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far.
   Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may
   also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way
   in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be
   extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within
   agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing
   the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank
   within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem
   function within intensively farmed monocultures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Premise of the study. The fitness of plants depends on their immediate
   biotic and abiotic environmental surroundings. The floral neighborhood
   of individual plants is part of this immediate environment and affects
   the frequency and behavior of their pollinators. However, the
   interactions among plants for pollination might differ among populations
   because populations differ in floral densities and pollinator
   assemblages. Despite that, manipulative experiments of the floral
   neighborhood in different populations with a specific focus on
   pollinator behavior are still rare.
   Methods. We introduced mixtures of two species (Salvia farinacae and
   Tagetes bonanza) in two populations of Taraxacum officinale and examined
   their effect on pollinators' foraging behavior on Taraxacum.
   Key results. The effects of the heterospecific neighborhood differed
   among pollinator groups and between the two populations. Only honeybees
   consistently preferred both the most diverse (containing three species)
   and completely pure patches of Taraxacum in both populations. We found a
   strong and positive effect of patch diversity on visitation to Taraxacum
   in one population, whereas in the other population either no effect or a
   negative effect of plant diversity occurred, which we attribute to
   differences between populations in the ratio of pollinators to
   inflorescences. Pollinator visitation consistently increased with local
   Taraxacum density in both populations.
   Conclusions. Our study shows that a similar local neighborhood can
   differentially affect the frequency and foraging behavior of
   pollinators, even in closely situated populations. Experimental studies
   conducted in several populations would contribute to determine which
   factors drive the variation in pollination interactions among
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Reward partitioning and replenishment and specific mechanisms for pollen
   presentation are all geared towards the maximization of the number of
   effective pollinator visits to individual flowers. An extreme case of an
   apparently highly specialized plant-pollinator interaction with
   thigmonastic pollen presentation has been described for the
   morphologically complex tilt-revolver flowers of Caiophora arechavaletae
   (Loasaceae) pollinated by oligolectic Bicolletes pampeana (Colletidae,
   Hymenoptera). We studied the floral biology of Nasa macrothyrsa
   (Loasaceae) in the field and in the glasshouse, which has very similar
   floral morphology, but is pollinated by polylectic Neoxylocopa bees
   (Apidae, Hymenoptera). We investigated the presence of thigmonastic
   anther presentation, visitor behaviour (pollinators and nectar robbers),
   co-ordination of pollinator visits with flower behaviour and the
   presence of nectar replenishment. The aim of this study was to
   understand whether complex flower morphology and behaviour can be
   explained by a specialized pollination syndrome, or whether alternative
   explanations can be offered. The results showed that Nasa macrothyrsa
   has thigmonastic pollen presentation, i.e. new pollen is rapidly (<< 10
   min) presented after a pollinator visit. Nectar secretion is independent
   of removal and averages 7-14 mu L h-1. The complex flowers, however,
   fail to exclude either native (hummingbirds) or introduced (honeybees)
   nectar robbers, nor does polylectic Neoxylocopa actively collect the
   pollen presented. The findings do not support a causal link between
   complex flower morphology and functionality in Loasaceae and a highly
   specialized pollination. Rapid pollen presentation is best explained by
   the pollen presentation theory: the large proportion of pollinators
   coming shortly after a previous visit find little nectar and are more
   likely to move on to a different plant. The rapid presentation of pollen
   ensures that all these valuable `hungry pollinators' are dusted with
   small pollen loads, thus increasing the male fitness of the plant by
   increasing the likelihood of siring outcrossed offspring. (C) 2010 The

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mutualisms provide benefits to interacting species, but they also
   involve costs. If costs come to exceed benefits as population density or
   the frequency of encounters between species increases, the interaction
   will no longer be mutualistic. Thus curves that represent benefits and
   costs as functions of interaction frequency are important tools for
   predicting when a mutualism will tip over into antagonism. Currently,
   most of what we know about benefit and cost curves in pollination
   mutualisms comes from highly specialized pollinating seed-consumer
   mutualisms, such as the yucca moth-yucca interaction. There, benefits to
   female reproduction saturate as the number of visits to a flower
   increases (because the amount of pollen needed to fertilize all the
   flower's ovules is finite), but costs continue to increase (because
   pollinator offspring consume developing seeds), leading to a peak in
   seed production at an intermediate number of visits. But for most
   plant-pollinator mutualisms, costs to the plant are more subtle than
   consumption of seeds, and how such costs scale with interaction
   frequency remains largely unknown. Here, we present reasonable benefit
   and cost curves that are appropriate for typical pollinator-plant
   interactions, and we show how they can result in a wide diversity of
   relationships between net benefit (benefit minus cost) and interaction
   frequency. We then use maximum-likelihood methods to fit net-benefit
   curves to measures of female reproductive success for three typical
   pollination mutualisms from two continents, and for each system we chose
   the most parsimonious model using information-criterion statistics. We
   discuss the implications of the shape of the net-benefit curve for the
   ecology and evolution of plant-pollinator mutualisms, as well as the
   challenges that lie ahead for disentangling the underlying benefit and
   cost curves for typical pollination mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Solitary bees are central place foragers returning to their nests
   several times a day with pollen and nectar to provision their brood
   cells. They are especially susceptible to landscape changes that lead to
   an increased spatial separation of suitable nesting sites and flower
   rich host plant stands. While knowledge of bee foraging ranges is
   currently growing, quantitative data on the costs of foraging flights
   are very scarce, although such data are crucial to understand bee
   population dynamics.
   2. In this study, the impact of increased foraging distance on the
   duration of foraging bouts and on the number of brood cells provisioned
   per time unit was experimentally quantified in the two pollen specialist
   solitary bee species Hoplitis adunca and Chelostoma rapunculi. Females
   nesting at different sites foraged under the same environmental
   conditions on a single large and movable flowering host plant patch in
   an otherwise host plant free landscape.
   3. The number of brood cells provisioned per time unit by H. adunca was
   found to decrease by 23\%, 31\% and 26\% with an increase in the
   foraging distance by 150, 200 and 300 m, respectively. The number of
   brood cells provisioned by C. rapunculi decreased by 46\% and 36\% with
   an increase in the foraging distance by 500 and 600 m, respectively.
   4. Contrary to expectation, a widely scattered arrangement of host
   plants did not result in longer mean duration of a foraging bout in H.
   adunca compared to a highly aggregated arrangement, which might be due
   to a reduced flight directionality combined with a high rate of
   revisitation of already depleted flowers in the aggregated plant
   arrangement or by a stronger competition and disturbance by other flower
   visitors.
   5. The results of this study clearly indicate that a close neighbourhood
   of suitable nesting and foraging habitats is crucial for population
   persistence and thus conservation of endangered solitary bee species.}},

Abstract = {{The fragmentation of natural habitat is considered to be a major threat
   to biodiversity. Decreasing habitat quality and quantity caused by
   fragmentation may lead to a disruption of plant-pollinator interactions
   and to a reduction in sexual reproduction in plant species. We conducted
   a 6-year field experiment to investigate the effects of small-scale
   fragmentation on plant-pollinator interactions and genetic diversity in
   the self-compatible Betonica officinalis. We examined the abundance and
   composition of pollinators, the foraging behaviour of bumblebees and the
   performance, outcrossing rate and genetic diversity of B. officinalis
   after 2 and 6 years in experimentally fragmented nutrient-poor,
   calcareous grassland in the northern Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments of
   different size (2.25 and 20.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5-m-wide strip
   of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots of corresponding size were
   situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland. Experimental grassland
   fragmentation altered the composition of B. officinalis pollinators and
   reduced their flower visitation rate. Furthermore, the foraging
   behaviour of bumblebees was changed in the fragments. After 6 years of
   fragmentation seed weight was higher in fragments than in control plots.
   However, the densities of B. officinalis rosettes and inflorescences,
   plant height and inflorescence length were not affected by
   fragmentation. The outcrossing frequency of B. officinalis growing in
   fragments was reduced by 15\% after 2 years and by 33\% after 6 years of
   experimental fragmentation. This resulted in a significant reduction of
   the genetic diversity in seedlings emerging in fragments after 6 years.
   Our study shows that small-scale habitat fragmentation can disturb the
   interaction between B. officinalis and pollinators resulting in a
   reduced outcrossing frequency and genetic diversity in plants growing in
   fragments. However, the response to fragmentation was considerably
   delayed. This finding strengthens the claim for long-term field
   experiments with proper replications and controls to assess delayed
   effects of habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{The number of pollinators of a plant species is considered a measure of
   its ecological generalization and may have important evolutionary and
   ecological implications. Many pollination studies report inter-annual
   fluctuations in the composition of pollinators to particular species.
   However, the factors causing such variation are still poorly understood.
   Here we investigate how flowering duration and plant and pollinator
   assemblages influenced the inter-annual changes in the functional
   generalization level of the 20 most common plant species of a
   semi-natural meadow in southern Norway. We also studied the extent to
   which changes in generalization levels were controlled by flower-shape
   and flowering time. Large inter-annual changes in generalization levels
   were common and there was no relationship between the generalization
   level one year and the following. Generalization level of particular
   plant species increased with flowering duration, sampling effort, and
   the abundance of managed honeybees in the community. Generalization
   level decreased with the flowering synchrony between the focal plant
   species and the rest of the plant community and with the focal species'
   own abundance, which we attribute to inter-specific competition for
   pollinator attraction and foraging decisions made by pollinators. Plants
   with different flower-shapes and flowering times did not differ in the
   extent of inter-annual variation in generalization levels. Most studies
   do not consider the effect of the plant community on the generalization
   level of particular plant species. We show here that both pollinator and
   plant assemblages can affect the inter-annual variation in
   generalization levels of plant species. Studies like ours will help to
   understand how pollination interactions are structured at the community
   level, and the ecological and evolutionary consequences that these
   inter-annual changes in generalization levels may have.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators and their predators share innate and learned preferences for
   high quality flowers. Consequently, pollinators are more likely to
   encounter predators when visiting the most rewarding flowers. I present
   a model of how different pollinator species can maximize lifetime
   resource gains depending on the density and distribution of predators,
   as well as their vulnerability to capture by predators. For pollinator
   species that are difficult for predators to capture, the optimal
   strategy is to visit the most rewarding flowers as long as predator
   density is low. At higher predator densities and for pollinators that
   are more vulnerable to predator capture, the lifetime resource gain from
   the most rewarding flowers declines and the optimal strategy depends on
   the predator distribution. In some cases, a wide range of floral rewards
   provides near-maximum lifetime resource gains, which may favor
   generalization if searching for flowers is costly. In other cases, a low
   flower reward level provides the maximum lifetime resource gain and so
   pollinators should specialize on less rewarding flowers. Thus, the model
   suggests that predators can have qualitatively different top-down
   effects on plant reproductive success depending on the pollinator

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Cardamom, an important spice crop often attacked by many
   insect pests, is controlled mainly using synthetic insecticides. As
   honey bees play a vital role in pollination in cardamom, the impact of
   insecticides on honey bees needs to be explored to assess its safety.
   RESULTS: Risk assessment based on contact toxicity revealed
   diafenthiuron to be a non-selective insecticide to bees with a low
   selectivity ratio (the ratio between the LD(50) for beneficial and pest
   species). A dose of diafenthiuron that killed 90\% of cardamom borer,
   Conogethes punctiferalis Guenee, was found to kill 100\% of Indian bees.
   Based on the hazard ratio (the ratio between the field-recommended dose
   and the LD(50) for the beneficial), diafenthiuron was found to be
   slightly to moderately toxic to bees. Diafenthiuron, even at low
   concentrations of LC(1) (the concentration that killed 1\% of bees), was
   found to affect the foraging and homing behaviour of Indian bees. Of
   bees fed with 30 mu g mL(-1) of diafenthiuron, 40\% were found missing
   on the third day after exposure. However, diafenthiuron did not affect
   bee visits to the cardamom fields.
   CONCLUSION: Diafenthiuron is more highly toxic to Apiscerana indica F.
   than to C. punctiferalis by contact, using selectivity ratio and probit
   substitution methods of risk assessment, but the hazard ratio revealed
   diafenthiuron to be a slightly to moderately toxic chemical.
   Diafenthiuron was found to affect the foraging and homing behaviour of

Abstract = {{Urban sprawl has led over wide areas to alteration and fragmentation of
   so many ecosystem types that it becomes essential to consider
   biodiversity conservation in urban planning. As the urbanisation is
   usually irreversible, the urban context has to be taken into account
   when defining appropriate management measures to sustain viable
   populations. Connectivity through pollen flow appears to be a key-factor
   for the long-term persistence of populations of insect-pollinated plant
   species. We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dye as
   pollen analogue in Lychnis flos-cuculi, an insect-pollinated wetland
   herb, along the Woluwe River, in Brussels urban zone (Belgium). Dye
   dispersal showed an exponential decay distribution, with particles
   mainly deposited on neighbouring individuals and populations. The mean
   distance of dye transfer was 133.6 m, with a maximal distance of 523.7
   m. Dye deposition was positively related to the number of potential
   recipient plants when distance to dye source was held constant. This may
   be associated with a higher flowering plant density across the flying
   distance that increases attractiveness and visitation rate of
   pollinators, and/or with secondary dye transfer. When connected, small
   and large populations only differed in response to the number of
   potential recipients. The small isolated population received little
   immigrant pollen flow, but remained a dye donor. Our study demonstrates
   that small populations of L. flos-cucli along an urban river may still
   exchange pollen thanks to pollinator movements, and might therefore be
   regarded in management planning as potential connecting components

Title = {{Hybrid floral scent novelty drives pollinator shift in sexually
   deceptive orchids}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sexually deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys attract their
   pollinators, male insects, on a highly specific basis through the
   emission of odour blends that mimic the female sex pheromone of the
   targeted species. In this study, we have investigated a contact site
   between Ophrys arachnitiformis and O. lupercalis, two sympatric orchid
   species that are usually reproductively isolated via the exploitation of
   different pollinator ``niches{''}, but occasionally hybridise despite
   their apparent combination of ethological and mechanical isolation
   barriers. In particular, we have investigated the extent to which these
   Ophrys hybrids generate ``emergent{''} combinations (i.e. novel and
   unpredictable from the parents' phenotypes) of floral traits, and how
   these phenotypic novelties, particularly the odour blends emitted by the
   flower, could facilitate the invasion of a novel pollinator ``niche{''}
   and induce the rapid formation of reproductive isolation, a prerequisite
   for adaptive evolutionary divergence.
   Results: Our chemical analyses of floral scents show that the Ophrys F1
   hybrids investigated here produce more compounds, significantly
   different ratios (\% of odour compounds in the total blend), as well as
   new compounds in their floral odour compared to their progenitors. When
   tested for their attractiveness to the pollinator of each parent orchid
   species, we found that floral scent extracts of the hybrids triggered
   less inspecting flights and contacts by the male bees with the scented
   dummy than those of the parental orchid species. However, a series of
   additional behavioural bioassays revealed that the novel floral scent of
   the hybrids was significantly more attractive than either of the two
   parents to a pollinator species not initially involved in the
   pollination of any of the parent Ophrys species.
   Conclusions: Collectively, our results illustrate that the process of

Abstract = {{The impacts of agricultural practices and landscape composition on bee
   communities were investigated in 14 sites located in four Western
   European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland).
   Standardized interviews with farmers assessed agricultural practices in
   terms of agricultural inputs (nitrogen fertilization and pesticides),
   livestock density and crop types. The proportion of semi-natural
   habitats was calculated for each site. We showed negative effects of
   agricultural intensification on species richness, abundance and
   diversity of wild bees. By contrast, bee species richness increased with
   the amount of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. Using a co-inertia
   analysis, we found an opposition between two types of agricultural
   specialization: towards crop production or towards animal husbandry.
   Species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees were greater in
   sites turned towards crop production. In these sites, flowering crops
   provided abundant food resources for bees whereas, in the other group of
   sites, intensive animal husbandry led to landscapes dominated by forage
   crops rather than flower-rich permanent grasslands. We also showed that
   bumblebees seemed to be less sensitive to agricultural intensification
   than solitary bees. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of. oral zygomorphy is an important innovation in
   flowering plants and is thought to arise principally from specialization
   on various insect pollinators. Floral morphology of neotropical
   Malpighiaceae is distinctive and highly conserved, especially with
   regard to symmetry, and is thought to be caused by selection by its
   oil-bee pollinators. We sought to characterize the genetic basis of.
   oral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae by investigating CYCLOIDEA2-like
   (CYC2-like) genes, which are required for establishing symmetry in
   diverse core eudicots. We identified two copies of CYC2-like genes in
   Malpighiaceae, which resulted from a gene duplication in the common
   ancestor of the family. A likely role for these loci in the development
   of. oral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae is demonstrated by the conserved
   pattern of dorsal gene expression in two distantly related neotropical
   species, Byrsonima crassifolia and Janusia guaranitica. Further evidence
   for this function is observed in a Malpighiaceae species that has moved
   to the paleotropics and experienced coincident shifts in pollinators,.
   oral symmetry, and CYC2-like gene expression. The dorsal expression
   pattern observed in Malpighiaceae contrasts dramatically with their
   actinomorphic-flowered relatives, Centroplacaceae (Bhesa paniculata) and
   Elatinaceae (Bergia texana). In particular, B. texana exhibits a
   previously undescribed pattern of uniform CYC2 expression, suggesting
   that CYC2 expression among the actinomorphic ancestors of zygomorphic
   lineages may be much more complex than previously thought. We consider
   three evolutionary models that may have given rise to this patterning,
   including the hypothesis that. oral zygomorphy in Malpighiaceae arose
   earlier than standard morphology-based character reconstructions
   suggest.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Typically, plant-pollinator interactions are recognized as mutualistic
   relationships. Flower visitors, however, can potentially play multiple
   roles. The floral nectar in Croton suberosus has been proposed to
   operate as a reward for predators, especially the wasp Polistes
   instabilis (Vespidae), which kills herbivorous insects, while the plant
   has been thought to be mainly wind-pollinated. In this study, we
   reassessed the pollination mode of C. suberosus and the possible role of
   its flower visitors. Pollinator exclusion experiments demonstrated that
   C. suberosus should be considered a strictly entomophilous species.
   Inflorescences of C. suberosus were visited by a diverse entomofauna
   involving 28 taxa belonging to six orders; however, wasps and bees were
   the only visitors that carried C. suberosus pollen. The visitation rate
   of wasps was approximately four times that of bees. This observation,
   combined with the fact that the small size of bees makes effective
   contact of their bodies with the stigma difficult, strongly suggests
   that large wasps are responsible for most of the effective pollination
   of C. suberosus. Among the wasp visitors, P. instabilis seems to be one
   of the most important. These findings expose an unusual plant-insect
   interaction, in which the plant provides nectar and wasps pollinate and
   defend the plant.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{505-511}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Colour is a consequence of the optical properties of an
   object and the visual system of the animal perceiving it. Colour is
   produced through chemical and structural means, but structural colour
   has been relatively poorly studied in plants.
   Scope This Botanical Briefing describes the mechanisms by which
   structures can produce colour. In plants, as in animals, the most common
   mechanisms are multilayers and diffraction gratings. The functions of
   structural colour are then discussed. In animals, these colours act
   primarily as signals between members of the same species, although they
   can also play roles in camouflaging animals from their predators. In
   plants, multilayers are found predominantly in shade-plant leaves,
   suggesting a role either in photoprotection or in optimizing capture of
   photosynthetically active light. Diffraction gratings may be a
   surprisingly common feature of petals, and recent work has shown that
   they can be used by bees as cues to identify rewarding flowers.
   Conclusions Structural colour may be surprisingly frequent in the plant
   kingdom, playing important roles alongside pigment colour. Much remains
   to be discovered about its distribution, development and function.}},

   91.13\% of the overall genetic variation within samples and 8.87\% (I

   indicated high levels of differentiation among some pairs of samples (I

   scents from the detached hind legs of a conspecific male E. nigrita in
   Belem, Brazil. The hind leg seemed to have been detached during fights

   observation was made. This behavior appears to be common among males of
   E. nigrita since more than one case was observed on the same day. The

Abstract = {{P>Species extinctions pose serious threats to the functioning of
   ecological communities worldwide. We used two qualitative and
   quantitative pollination networks to simulate extinction patterns
   following three removal scenarios: random removal and systematic removal
   of the strongest and weakest interactors. We accounted for pollinator
   behaviour by including potential links into temporal snapshots (12
   consecutive 2-week networks) to reflect mutualists' ability to `switch'
   interaction partners (re-wiring). Qualitative data suggested a linear or
   slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed
   sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the
   strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of
   re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks
   to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an
   increase in network stability if species formed new interactions.
   Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that promote the extinction of the
   strongest interactors might induce a sudden collapse of pollination
