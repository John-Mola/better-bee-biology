Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Many studies assume climatic factors are paramount
   in determining species' distributions, however, biotic interactions may
   also play a role. For example, pollinators may limit species' ranges if
   floral abundance or floral attractiveness is reduced at range margins,
   thus causing lower pollinator visitation and reduced reproductive
   output.
   METHODS: To test if pollinators influence the a ltitudina I distribution
   of Erythronium montanum (Liliaceae) at Mount Rainier National Park, we
   asked whether (1) seed production in this species relies on pollinators,
   (2) seed production and pollen limitation is greatest at range limits,
   and (3) pollinator visitation rates (either overall or by individual
   taxonomic groups) reflect patterns of seed production and pollen
   limitation.
   RESULTS: From this three-year study, we established that this plant does
   rely on pollinators for fruit set and we found that pollen limitation
   trended toward being higher at the upper range limit in some years, but
   not consistently year to year. Insect visitation rates did not mirror
   spatial patterns of pollen limitation, but annually variable pollinator
   composition suggested differential importance of some pollinator
   taxonomic groups (specifically, bumblebees may be better pollinators
   than syrphid flies).
   CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these results suggest that while pollinators are
   critical for the reproductive success of this high mountain wildflower,
   plant -pollinator interactions do not obviously drive the distribution
   of this species. Nonetheless, high spatio-temporal variability in range
   -wide plant -pollinator dynamics may complicate responses to climate
   change.}},

Title = {{Flower-visitor selection on floral integration in three contrasting
   populations of Lonicera implexa}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},

Pages = {{325-336}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Geographic differences in flower visitor
   assemblages might lead to among-population differences in the magnitude
   and pattern of floral integration. However, the role of current
   pollinator visitation in shaping the magnitude and pattern of floral
   trait correlations is still controversial.
   METHODS: We used individual-level data on floral morphology, flower
   visitation, and fitness to assess if floral integration (at flower and
   floral-module level) and the covariance structure of floral traits
   varied among three populations of Lonicera implexa differing in the
   importance of long-tongue (hawk moths) and short-tongue (bees and small
   beetles) pollinators; and to assess whether this variation was related
   to the selection pressures exerted by flower visitors.
   KEY RESULTS: Short-tongue pollinators preferentially visited plants with
   floral traits that enhanced flower accessibility; consequently, there
   was directional selection for accessibility (integration at
   floral-module level) in the populations where they dominated or
   codominated. In the population with both short and long-tongue
   pollinators, disruptive selection on corolla width and directional
   selection against whole-flower integration was also found. Dominance by
   long-tongue pollinators (hawk moths) resulted in disruptive selection on
   whole-flower integration. Overall, the conflicting selection pressures
   that were found matched among-population differences in covariance
   structure: populations with short-tongue pollinators showed correlations
   between corolla-tube width and other floral traits that were absent in
   the population pollinated primarily by hawk moths.
   CONCLUSIONS: Conflicting selection on floral integration mediated by
   floral visitors can occur even in nearby populations of a species with
   restricted floral morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators supply essential, historically undervalued pollination
   services to crops and other flowering plant communities with great
   potential to ensure agricultural production against the loss of heavily
   relied upon managed pollinators. Local plant communities provision wild
   bees with crucial floral and nesting resources, but the distribution of
   floristic diversity among habitat types in North American agricultural
   landscapes and its effect on pollinators are diverse and poorly
   understood, especially in orchard systems. We documented floristic
   diversity in typical mid-Atlantic commercial apple (Malus domestica
   Borkh.) orchards including the forest and orchard-forest edge
   ({''}edge{''}) habitats surrounding orchards in a heterogeneous
   landscape in south-central Pennsylvania, USA. We also assessed the
   correlation between plant richness and orchard pollinator communities.
   In this apple production region, edge habitats are the most species
   rich, supporting 146 out of 202 plant species recorded in our survey.
   Plant species richness in the orchard and edge habitats were significant
   predictors of bee species richness and abundance in the orchard, as well
   as landscape area of the forest and edge habitats. Both the quantity and
   quality of forest and edges close to orchards play a significant role in
   provisioning a diverse wild bee community in this agroecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa seed production in the northwestern United States and western
   Canada is heavily dependent upon the pollinating services of Megachile
   rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). M. rotundata females nest in
   cavities either naturally occurring or in artificial nesting blocks.
   Because of the physical nature of the nest, M. rotundata brood may have
   limited to no exposure to photoperiodic cues in order to regulate
   important circadian functions. Therefore, various thermoperiod regimes
   were used to characterize the possible role of thermoperiodism in
   synchronizing M. rotundata adult emergence. Adult emergence was
   monitored using a microprocessor- controlled event logger. Incubating
   bees under constant 29 degrees C and darkness resulted in an arhythmic
   adult emergence pattern. Exposing developing M. rotundata to a
   thermoperiod synchronized emergence to the beginning of the thermophase
   and decreased the total number of days required for all adults to
   emerge. The amplitude of the thermoperiod regulated the timing of peak
   emergence in relationship to the increase in temperature. A thermoperiod
   amplitude of only 2 degrees C was sufficient to synchronize peak adult
   emergence to take place during the rise in temperature. Increasing the
   amplitude of the thermoperiod to 4 or 8 degrees C caused a positively
   correlated shift in peak emergence to later in the thermophase. Brood
   stored under constant 29 degrees C and darkness for different durations
   (May or June early in the growing season or July or August late in the
   growing season) or under a fluctuating thermal regime (base temperature
   of 6 degrees C and daily 1-h pulse of 20 degrees C until September or
   November) maintained their capacity for entraining emergence timing by
   thermoperiodism.}},

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{During the last 150 years, incursions of non-native species have been
   prevalent throughout the South West Pacific. The allodapine bee,
   Braunsapis puangensis (Cockerell) (Xylocopinae: Allodapini), was
   introduced to Fiji between 1965 and 2003, most likely from India. Until
   very recently, little was known about its dispersal ability and
   subsequent geographical spread across Fiji. Our study greatly increases
   the geographical records of B.puangensis across Viti Levu, Fiji's
   largest island, as well as surrounding islands including Vanua Levu,
   Taveuni and Mana Island. We found that B.puangensis is present
   throughout all major regions of Viti Levu, and it appears to be highly
   vagile. In Fiji, we only found B.puangensis foraging on introduced plant
   species, but nesting in both native and introduced plant species.
   Increased pollination of weedy exotic plants by this bee could increase
   their abundance in Fiji. Populations of B.puangensis in Fiji require
   close monitoring to detect environmental effects including spread of
   invasive weed species and knock-on effects to ecosystem interactions.}},

Abstract = {{To slow the rate of global species loss, it is imperative to understand
   how to restore and maintain native biodiversity in agricultural
   landscapes. Currently, agriculture is associated with lower spatial
   heterogeneity and turnover in community composition (-diversity). While
   some techniques are known to enhance -diversity, it is unclear whether
   habitat restoration can re-establish -diversity. Using a long-term
   pollinator dataset, comprising approximate to 9,800 specimens collected
   from the intensively managed agricultural landscape of the Central
   Valley of California, we show that on-farm habitat restoration in the
   form of native plant hedgerows', when replicated across a landscape, can
   boost -diversity by approximately 14\% relative to unrestored field
   margins, to levels similar to some natural communities. Hedgerows
   restore -diversity by promoting the assembly of phenotypically diverse
   communities. Intensively managed agriculture imposes a strong ecological
   filter that negatively affects several important dimensions of community
   trait diversity, distribution, and uniqueness. However, by helping to
   restore phenotypically diverse pollinator communities, small-scale
   restorations such as hedgerows provide a valuable tool for conserving
   biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Non-rewarding orchids rely on various ruses to attract their
   pollinators. One of the most common is for them to resemble flowers
   sought by insects as food sources. This can range from generalized food
   deception to the mimicry of specific sympatric food plants. We
   investigated the basis of pollinator deception in the European
   food-deceptive orchid Traunsteinera globosa, which has unusually compact
   flowerheads resembling those of sympatric rewarding species of Knautia
   and Scabiosa (Dipsacaceae), and Valeriana (Caprifoliaceae). Visual
   signals of T.globosa are similar in both fly and bee vision models to
   those of the sympatric food plants used in the choice experiments, but
   scent signals are divergent. Field experiments conducted in Austria and
   the Czech Republic showed that both naive and experienced (with respect
   to visitation of T.globosa) insect species approached the orchids at the
   same rate as food plants, but direct contact with orchid flowers was
   taxon specific. Flies were most easily duped into probing the orchid,
   and, in doing so, frequently received and deposited pollinaria, whereas
   most bees and butterflies avoided landing on orchid flowers. We conclude
   that T.globosa is a mimic of a guild of fly-pollinated plants, but the

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides, especially as seed treatments, have raised
   concerns about environmental loading and impacts on pollinators,
   biodiversity, and ecosystems. The authors measured concentrations of
   neonicotinoid residues in the top 5cm of soil before planting of maize
   (corn) in 18 commercial fields with a history of neonicotinoid seed
   treatment use in southwestern Ontario in 2013 and 2014 using liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. A
   simple calculator based on first-order kinetics, incorporating crop
   rotation, planting date, and seed treatment history from the subject
   fields, was used to estimate dissipation rate from the seed zone. The
   estimated half-life (the time taken for 50\% of the insecticide to have
   dissipated by all mechanisms) based on 8 yr of crop history was 0.64
   (range, 0.25-1.59) yr and 0.57 (range, 0.24-2.12) yr for 2013 and 2014,
   respectively. In fields where neonicotinoid residues were measured in
   both years, the estimated mean half-life between 2013 and 2014 was 0.4
   (range, 0.27-0.6) yr. If clothianidin and thiamethoxam were used
   annually as a seed treatment in a typical crop rotation of maize,
   soybean, and winter wheat over several years, residues would plateau
   rather than continue to accumulate. Residues of neonicotinoid
   insecticides after 3 yr to 4 yr of repeated annual use tend to plateau
   to a mean concentration of less than 6ng/g in agricultural soils in
   southwestern Ontario. Environ Toxicol Chem 2016;35:295-302. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{Limited data are available on the fate of clothianidin under realistic
   agricultural production conditions. The present study is the first
   large-scale assessment of clothianidin residues in soil and bee-relevant
   matrices from corn and canola fields after multiple years of
   seed-treatment use. The average soil concentration from 50 Midwest US
   corn fields with 2 yr to 11 yr of planting clothianidin-treated seeds
   was 7.0ng/g, similar to predicted concentrations from a single planting
   of Poncho 250-treated corn seeds (6.3ng/g). The water-extractable (i.e.,
   plant-bioavailable) clothianidin residues in soil were only 10\% of
   total residues. Clothianidin concentrations in soil reached a plateau
   concentration (amount applied equals amount dissipated) in fields with 4
   or more application years. Concentrations in corn pollen from these
   fields were low (mean: 1.8ng/g) with no correlation to total years of
   use or soil concentrations. For canola, soil concentrations from 27
   Canadian fields with 2 yr to 4 yr of seed treatment use (mean=5.7ng/g)
   were not correlated with use history, and plant bioavailability was 6\%
   of clothianidin soil residues. Average canola nectar concentrations were
   0.6ng/g and not correlated to use history or soil concentrations. Under
   typical cropping practices, therefore, clothianidin residues are not
   accumulating significantly in soil, plant bioavailability of residues in
   soil is limited, and exposure to pollinators will not increase over time
   in fields receiving multiple applications of clothianidin. Environ

Abstract = {{Pollination and soil fertility are important ecosystem services to
   agriculture but their relative roles and potential interactions are
   poorly understood. We explored the combined effects of pollination and
   soil fertility in sunflower using soils from a trial characterized by
   different long-term input management in order to recreate plausible
   levels of soil fertility. Pollinator exclusion was used as a proxy for a
   highly eroded pollination service. Pollination benefits to yield
   depended on soil fertility, i.e., insect pollination enhanced seed set
   and yield only under higher soil fertility indicating that limited
   nutrient availability may constrain pollination benefits. Our study
   provides evidence for interactions between above- and belowground
   ecosystem services, highlighting the crucial role of soil fertility in
   supporting agricultural production not only directly, but also
   indirectly through pollination. Management strategies aimed at enhancing
   pollination services might fail in increasing yield in landscapes
   characterized by high soil service degradation. Comprehensive knowledge
   about service interactions is therefore essential for the correct
   management of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes.}},

Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Many plant species employing a food-deceptive pollination strategy show
   discrete or continuous floral polymorphism within their populations.
   Previous studies have suggested that negative frequency-dependent
   selection (NFDS) caused by the learning behavior of pollinators was
   responsible for the maintenance of floral polymorphism. However, NFDS
   alone does not explain why and when discrete or continuous polymorphism
   evolves. In this study, we use an evolutionary simulation model to
   propose that inaccurate discrimination of flower colors by pollinators
   results in evolution of discrete flower color polymorphism. Simulations
   showed that associative learning based on inaccurate discrimination in
   pollinators caused disruptive selection of flower colors. The degree of
   inaccuracy determined the number of discrete flower colors that evolved.
   Our results suggest that animal behavior based on inaccurate
   discriminationmay be a general cause of disruptive selection that
   promotes discrete trait polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{The South American lulo (Solanum quitoense Lam.) is a crop plant of the
   Andes of Ecuador and Colombia, pollinated by South American bumblebees,
   such as, Bombus atratus Franklin. The cultivation of lulo outside of its
   native range, for example in European glasshouses, requires the presence
   of efficient pollinators to enable high fruit set and yield. Until now,
   the suitability of Bombus terrestris L., native to Europe and commonly
   used in agriculture, has been untested for this purpose. In this study,
   the pollen-collecting behaviour of B. terrestris when visiting lulo
   flowers was investigated. It was shown that B. terrestris adopted the
   lulo as a pollen source, and on average visited three flowers per
   minute, had five buzzing events per stay and foraged for 15 s on a
   single flower, independently of the previous number of visits and level
   of bruising to the anthers. The pollination efficiency of five different
   treatments was evaluated: (i) exclusion of bees, (ii) single and (iii)
   multiple visits of B. terrestris, (iv) self- and (v) cross-pollination
   by hand. The results clearly demonstrated that, for fruit set,
   pollination is crucial. It was also found that lulo flowers can be
   successfully self- pollinated, but give 25\% fewer fruit set compared
   with pollination via multiple bumblebee visits, or cross-pollination by
   hand. Fruit set, seed set and fruit size were as high with pollination
   by B. terrestris as with cross-pollination by hand, indicating that this
   bumblebee is an appropriate pollinator for lulo. However, B. terrestris
   was conspicuously less effective when a flower was visited only once.
   Therefore, when growing lulos commercially, multiple bumblebee visits
   should be encouraged, but it is likely that the behaviour of B.
   terrestris would ensure this anyway. Our results indicate that B.
   terrestris is a suitable and efficient pollinator for the production of
   lulo fruits.}},

Abstract = {{1 Pollination is an important ecosystem service because many
   agricultural crops such as fruit trees are pollinated by insects.
   Agricultural intensification, however, is one of the main drivers
   resulting in a serious decline of pollinator populations worldwide.
   2 In the present study, pollinator communities were examined in 12 apple
   orchards surrounded by either homogeneous or heterogeneous landscape in
   Hungary. Pollinators (honey bees, wild bees, hoverflies) were surveyed
   in the flowering period of apple trees. Landscape heterogeneity was
   characterized within a radius of 300, 500 and 1000 m around each orchard
   using Shannon's diversity and Shannon's evenness indices.
   3 We found that pollination success of apple was significantly related
   to the species richness of wild bees, regardless the dominance of honey
   bees.
   4 Diversity of the surrounding landscape matrix had a marginal positive
   effect on the species richness of hoverflies within a radius of 300 m
   and a positive effect on the species richness of wild bees within a
   radius of 500 m, whereas evenness of the surrounding landscape enhanced
   the abundance of wild bees within a radius of 500 m. Flower resources in
   the groundcover within the orchards supported honey bees.
   5 Therefore, the maintenance of semi-natural habitats within 500 m
   around apple orchards is highly recommended to enhance wild pollinator
   communities and apple production.}},

Abstract = {{Many bees collect pollen by grasping the anthers of a flower and
   vibrating their flight muscles at high frequencies-a behavior termed
   sonication, or buzz-pollination. Here we compare buzz-pollination on
   Solanum lycopersicum (cherry tomatoes) by two bees that fill similar
   niches on different continents-in Australia, Amegilla murrayensis
   (blue-banded bee), and in North America, Bombus impatiens (bumblebee).
   We collected audio recordings of buzz-pollination and quantified the
   frequency and length of buzzes, as well as the total time spent per
   flower. We found that A. murrayensis buzzes at significantly higher
   frequencies (similar to 350 Hz) than B. impatiens (similar to 240 Hz)
   and flaps its wings at higher frequencies during flight. There was no
   difference in the length of a single buzz, but A. murrayensis spent less
   time on each flower, as B. impatiens buzzed the flower several times
   before departing, whereas A. murrayensis typically buzzed the flower
   only once. High-speed videos of A. murrayensis during buzz-pollination
   revealed that its physical interaction with the flower differs markedly
   from the mechanism described for Bombus and other bees previously
   examined. Rather than grasping the anther cone with its mandibles and
   shaking, A. murrayensis taps the anther cone with its head at the high
   buzzing frequencies generated by its flight muscles. This unique
   behavior, combined with its higher buzzing frequency and reduced flower
   visit duration, suggests that A. murrayensis may be able to extract
   pollen more quickly than B. impatiens, and points to the need for
   further studies directly comparing the pollination effectiveness of
   these species.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Bees and their host flower populations were studied by identifying
   pollen to species or genus, from trap nests where bees were reared. Rare
   plant species in bee diets, and disturbance regimes, have not previously
   been researched and are emphasized here. Two focal bee groups with one
   species each (Megachilidae and Apidae) were studied in a 500,000-ha
   tropical reserve in the Yucatan Peninsula nine complete years. The
   number of rare or major pollen species in nests had no statistical
   correlation; thus, rare pollen analysis complements study of major brood
   provisions. We found most nests (87 \% Megachile zaptlana, 93 \% Centris
   analis) contained rare pollen; only 12 \% of the 438 nests contained
   major pollen alone. Rare pollen sometimes indicated an energy source
   rather than a scarce protein resource. Trichome nectar of Cydista, along
   with Ipomoea and Caesalpinia, were nectar sources. Malpighiaceae,
   despite lacking nectar, often provided the complete Centris diet.
   Considering rare pollen, only Centris responded to drought, or
   competition from immigrant honeybees. Neither bee responded to
   hurricanes. Drought years coincided with low bee populations; Centris
   nests contained more rare species then. After feral Africanized
   honeybees colonized, Centris had more major species and fewer rare. Some
   herbarium vouchers from the study area contained exotic pollen,
   demonstrating in situ floral contamination and ecological generalization
   by bees, but this rarely occurred in plants found among the bee diets.
   Megachile and Centris responded differently to competition and resource
   scarcity, and plausibly evolved under different disturbance regimes, yet
   appeared well adapted to hurricane disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Although the negative effects of invasive species are globally
   recognized, little is known about the potential positive impacts they
   can have on other species in the ecosystems they invade. However, the
   persistence of invaders in a wide range of ecological communities may
   mean that they provide resources and refuge for threatened native
   species, or supplement ecosystem services.
   Location Agroecosystems in the USA.
   Methods We use a 2-year field experiment to explore the potential
   positive and negative impacts of an invasive thistle (Carduus
   acanthoides) on the composition of the resident community of foraging
   insects. The presence or absence of the thistle was the only difference
   in experimental and control plots comprising a background community of
   ten flowering annual species.
   Results We demonstrate that the invasive thistle is both highly visited
   and strongly preferred by bees relative to other flowering species. Bee
   abundance was 302\% higher and bee species richness 35\% higher in
   habitat patches where the thistle was present compared to where it was
   absent. In addition, the abundance of Bombus species, a native group
   recently found to be in decline, was 479\% higher when the thistle was
   present.
   Main conclusions Our results suggest that, despite causing significant
   problems, the invasion of this non-native species may also provide
   crucial benefits via floral resources for pollinators. Benefits, such as
   the floral resources that invaders provide to pollinators, should also
   be taken into account in conservation and invader management plans.
   Eradication or complete removal of invasive species which provision
   insects with floral resources could have unintended negative impacts on
   the associated pollinator community.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic landscape elements, such as roadsides, hedgerows, field
   edges, and power line clearings, can be managed to provide important
   habitats for wild bees. However, the effects of habitat improvement
   schemes in power line clearings on components of diversity are poorly
   studied. We conducted a large-scale experiment to test the effects of
   different management practices on the species, phylogenetic, and
   functional diversity of wild bees in power line clearings (n=19 sites
   across southeastern Norway) and explored whether any treatment effects
   were modified by the environmental context. At each site, we conducted
   the following treatments: (1) Cut: all trees cut and left to decay in
   the clearing; (2) Cut+Remove: all trees cut and removed from the plot;
   and (3) Uncut: uncleared. The site-specific environmental context (i.e.,
   elevation and floral diversity) influenced the species, phylogenetic,
   and functional diversity within bee species assemblages. The largest
   number of species was found in the Cut+Remove treatment in plots with a
   high forb species richness, indicating that the outcome of management
   practices depends on the environmental context. Clearing of treatment
   plots with many forb species also appeared to alter the phylogenetic
   composition of bee species assemblages, that is, more closely related
   species were found in the Cut and the Cut+Remove plots than in the Uncut
   plots. Synthesis and applications: Our experimental simulation of
   management practices in power line clearings influenced the species,
   phylogenetic, and functional diversity of bee species assemblages.
   Frequent clearing and removal of the woody debris at low elevations with
   a high forb species richness can increase the value of power line
   clearings for solitary bees. It is therefore important for managers to
   consider the environmental context when designing habitat improvement
   schemes for solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread use of azole antifungals in medicine and agriculture and
   the resulting long-persistent residues could potentially affect
   beneficial fungi. However, there is very little information on the
   tolerance of non-target environmental fungi to azoles. In this study, we
   assessed the susceptibility of diverse plant-and insect-associated
   yeasts from the Metschnikowia clade, including several ecologically
   important species, to widely used medical and agricultural azoles
   (epoxiconazole, imazalil, ketoconazole and voriconazole). A total of 120
   strains from six species were tested. Minimum inhibitory concentrations
   (MICs) were determined by the EUCAST broth microdilution procedure after
   some necessary modifications were made. The majority of species tested
   were highly susceptible to epoxiconazole, ketoconazole and voriconazole
   (>95\% of strains showed MICs <= 0.125 mg l(-1)). Most strains were also
   very susceptible to imazalil, although MIC values were generally higher
   than for the other azoles. Furthermore, certain Metschnikowia reukaufii
   strains displayed a `trailing' phenotype (i.e. showed reduced but
   persistent growth at antifungal concentrations above the MIC), but this
   characteristic was dependent on test conditions. It was concluded that
   exposure to azoles may pose a risk for ecologically relevant yeasts from
   the Metschnikowia clade, and thus could potentially impinge on the
   tripartite interaction linking these fungi with plants and their insect
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration and maintenance of habitat diversity have been suggested as
   conservation priorities in farmed landscapes, but how this should be
   achieved and at what scale are unclear. This study makes a novel
   comparison of the effectiveness of three wildlife-friendly farming
   schemes for supporting local habitat diversity and species richness on
   12 farms in England. The schemes were: (i) Conservation Grade
   (Conservation Grade: a prescriptive, non-organic, biodiversity-focused
   scheme), (ii) organic agriculture and (iii) a baseline of Entry Level
   Stewardship (Entry Level Stewardship: a flexible widespread government
   scheme). Conservation Grade farms supported a quarter higher habitat
   diversity at the 100-m radius scale compared to Entry Level Stewardship
   farms. Conservation Grade and organic farms both supported a fifth
   higher habitat diversity at the 250-m radius scale compared to Entry
   Level Stewardship farms. Habitat diversity at the 100-m and 250-m scales
   significantly predicted species richness of butterflies and plants.
   Habitat diversity at the 100-m scale also significantly predicted
   species richness of birds in winter and solitary bees. There were no
   significant relationships between habitat diversity and species richness
   for bumblebees or birds in summer. Butterfly species richness was
   significantly higher on organic farms (50\% higher) and marginally
   higher on Conservation Grade farms (20\% higher), compared with farms in
   Entry Level Stewardship. Organic farms supported significantly more
   plant species than Entry Level Stewardship farms (70\% higher) but
   Conservation Grade farms did not (10\% higher). There were no
   significant differences between the three schemes for species richness
   of bumblebees, solitary bees or birds.Policy implications. The
   wildlife-friendly farming schemes which included compulsory changes in
   management, Conservation Grade and organic, were more effective at
   increasing local habitat diversity and species richness compared with
   the less prescriptive Entry Level Stewardship scheme. We recommend that
   wildlife-friendly farming schemes should aim to enhance and maintain
   high local habitat diversity, through mechanisms such as option
   packages, where farmers are required to deliver a combination of several
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptations to new pollinators involve multiple floral traits, each
   requiring coordinated changes in multiple genes. Despite this genetic
   complexity, shifts in pollination syndromes have happened frequently
   during angiosperm evolution. Here we study the genetic basis of floral
   UV absorbance, a key trait for attracting nocturnal pollinators. In
   Petunia, mutations in a single gene, MYB-FL, explain two transitions in
   UV absorbance. A gain of UV absorbance in the transition from bee to
   moth pollination was determined by a cis-regulatory mutation, whereas a
   frameshift mutation caused subsequent loss of UV absorbance during the
   transition from moth to hummingbird pollination. The functional
   differences in MYB-FL provide insight into the process of speciation and
   clarify phylogenetic relationships between nascent species.}},

Title = {{Pollinator Competition as a Driver of Floral Divergence: An Experimental
   Test}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Optimal foraging models of floral divergence predict that competition
   between two different types of pollinators will result in partitioning,
   increased assortative mating, and divergence of two floral phenotypes.
   We tested these predictions in a tropical plant-pollinator system using
   sexes of purple-throated carib hummingbirds (Anthracothorax jugularis)
   as the pollinators, red and yellow inflorescence morphs of Heliconia
   caribaea as the plants, and fluorescent dyes as pollen analogs in an
   enclosed outdoor garden. When foraging alone, males exhibited a
   significant preference for the yellow morph of H. caribaea, whereas
   females exhibited no preference. In competition, males maintained their
   preference for the yellow morph and through aggression caused females to
   over-visit the red morph, resulting in resource partitioning.
   Competition significantly increased within-morph dye transfer
   (assortative mating) relative to non-competitive environments.
   Competition and partitioning of color morphs by sexes of purple-throated
   caribs also resulted in selection for floral divergence as measured by
   dye deposition on stigmas. Red and yellow morphs did not differ
   significantly in dye deposition in the competition trials, but
   differences in dye deposition and preferences for morphs when sexes of
   purple-throated caribs foraged alone implied fixation of one or the
   other color morph in the absence of competition. Competition also
   resulted in selection for divergence in corolla length, with the red
   morph experiencing directional selection for longer corollas and the
   yellow morph experiencing stabilizing selection on corolla length. Our
   results thus support predictions of foraging models of floral divergence
   and indicate that pollinator competition is a viable mechanism for
   divergence in floral traits of plants.}},

Title = {{The Potential Influence of Bumble Bee Visitation on Foraging Behaviors
   and Assemblages of Honey Bees on Squash Flowers in Highland Agricultural
   Ecosystems}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Bee species interactions can benefit plant pollination through
   synergistic effects and complementary effects, or can be of detriment to
   plant pollination through competition effects by reducing visitation by
   effective pollinators. Since specific bee interactions influence the
   foraging performance of bees on flowers, they also act as drivers to
   regulate the assemblage of flower visitors. We selected squash
   (Cucurbita pepo L.) and its pollinators as a model system to study the
   foraging response of honey bees to the occurrence of bumble bees at two
   types of sites surrounded by a high amount of natural habitats (>= 58\%
   of land cover) and a low amount of natural habitats (<= 12\% of land
   cover) in a highland agricultural ecosystem in China. At the individual
   level, we measured the elapsed time from the departure of prior
   pollinator(s) to the arrival of another pollinator, the selection of
   honey bees for flowers occupied by bumble bees, and the length of time
   used by honey bees to explore floral resources at the two types of
   sites. At the community level, we explored the effect of bumble bee
   visitation on the distribution patterns of honey bees on squash flowers.
   Conclusively, bumble bee visitation caused an increase in elapsed time
   before flowers were visited again by a honey bee, a behavioral avoidance
   by a newly-arriving honey bee to select flowers occupied by bumble bees,
   and a shortened length of time the honey bee takes to examine and
   collect floral resources. The number of overall bumble bees on squash
   flowers was the most important factor explaining the difference in the
   distribution patterns of honey bees at the community level. Furthermore,
   decline in the number of overall bumble bees on the squash flowers
   resulted in an increase in the number of overall honey bees. Therefore,
   our study suggests that bee interactions provide an opportunity to
   enhance the resilience of ecosystem pollination services against the
   decline in pollinator diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees are highly valuable pollinators. Along with managed honey
   bees, they provide a critical ecosystem service by ensuring stable
   pollination to agriculture and wild plant communities. Increasing
   concern about the welfare of both wild and managed pollinators, however,
   has prompted recent calls for national evaluation and action. Here, for
   the first time to our knowledge, we assess the status and trends of wild
   bees and their potential impacts on pollination services across the
   coterminous United States. We use a spatial habitat model, national
   land-cover data, and carefully quantified expert knowledge to estimate
   wild bee abundance and associated uncertainty. Between 2008 and 2013,
   modeled bee abundance declined across 23\% of US land area. This decline
   was generally associated with conversion of natural habitats to row
   crops. We identify 139 counties where low bee abundances correspond to
   large areas of pollinator-dependent crops. These areas of mismatch
   between supply (wild bee abundance) and demand (cultivated area) for
   pollination comprise 39\% of the pollinator-dependent crop area in the
   United States. Further, we find that the crops most highly dependent on
   pollinators tend to experience more severe mismatches between declining
   supply and increasing demand. These trends, should they continue, may
   increase costs for US farmers and may even destabilize crop production
   over time. National assessments such as this can help focus both
   scientific and political efforts to understand and sustain wild bees. As
   new information becomes available, repeated assessments can update
   findings, revise priorities, and track progress toward sustainable
   management of our nation's pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Wild and managed bees are well documented as effective pollinators of
   global crops of economic importance. However, the contributions by
   pollinators other than bees have been little explored despite their
   potential to contribute to crop production and stability in the face of
   environmental change. Non-bee pollinators include flies, beetles, moths,
   butterflies, wasps, ants, birds, and bats, among others. Here we focus
   on non-bee insects and synthesize 39 field studies from five continents
   that directly measured the crop pollination services provided by
   non-bees, honey bees, and other bees to compare the relative
   contributions of these taxa. Non-bees performed 25-50\% of the total
   number of flower visits. Although non-bees were less effective
   pollinators than bees per flower visit, they made more visits; thus
   these two factors compensated for each other, resulting in pollination
   services rendered by non-bees that were similar to those provided by
   bees. In the subset of studies that measured fruit set, fruit set
   increased with non-bee insect visits independently of bee visitation
   rates, indicating that non-bee insects provide a unique benefit that is
   not provided by bees. We also show that non-bee insects are not as
   reliant as bees on the presence of remnant natural or seminatural
   habitat in the surrounding landscape. These results strongly suggest
   that non-bee insect pollinators play a significant role in global crop
   production and respond differently than bees to landscape structure,
   probably making their crop pollination services more robust to changes
   in land use. Non-bee insects provide a valuable service and provide
   potential insurance against bee population declines.}},

Abstract = {{The putative transfer and gene regulatory activities of diet-derived
   miRNAs in ingesting animals are still debated. Importantly, no study to
   date has fully examined the role of dietary uptake of miRNA in the honey
   bee, a critical pollinator in both agricultural and natural ecosystems.
   After controlled pollen feeding experiments in adult honey bees, we
   observed that midguts demonstrated robust increases in plant miRNAs
   after pollen ingestion. However, we found no evidence of biologically
   relevant delivery of these molecules to proximal or distal tissues of
   recipient honey bees. Our results, therefore, support the premise that
   pollen miRNAs ingested as part of a typical diet are not robustly
   transferred across barrier epithelia of adult honey bees under normal
   conditions. Key future questions include whether other small RNA species
   in honey bee diets behave similarly and whether more specialized and
   specific delivery mechanisms exist for more efficient transport,
   particularly in the context of stressed barrier epithelia.}},

Abstract = {{Solitary trap-nesting wasps are prospective bioindicators of
   anthropogenic pressures on natural ecosystems and one of the surrogate
   taxa for biodiversity assessments. The implementation of these studies
   is taxonomy-based and relies on accurate identification of species. The
   identification of larval stages of cavity-nesting Hymenoptera, collected
   using trap-nests, is complicated or impossible before the
   post-hibernation hatching of adults. DNA barcoding may allow the
   identification of the trap-nesting Hymenoptera species immediately after
   collection of the trap-nests, using larvae or dead specimens as sources
   of DNA. Using the standard barcoding sequence, we identified 33 wasp
   species from the families Vespidae, Pompilidae and Crabronidae,
   inhabiting trap-nests in Europe. Within-species and between-species
   genetic distances were estimated to evaluate the differences of
   intraspecific and interspecific genetic diversity. Genetic distances
   between related species indicated an obvious barcoding gap.
   Neighbour-joining analysis revealed that groups corresponding to taxa of
   genus level are cohesive as well. COI barcode approach was confirmed as
   a valuable tool for taxonomy-based biodiversity studies of the
   trap-nesting Hymenoptera.}},

Abstract = {{Homogenization of agricultural landscapes affects ecological processes
   and biodiversity and can affect the community composition of ecosystem
   service providers. These effects can have particular impact in
   landscapes dominated by monocultures of pollinator-dependent tree crop
   plantations, which create both spatial and temporal homogeneity at the
   landscape scale. I looked for associations between the proportion of
   nearby unmanaged vegetation and potential wild pollinator groups
   collected within flowering almond orchards in two types of landscape. In
   the Complex landscape, characterized by a heterogeneous mosaic of
   multiple crops, semi-natural grassland and natural woodland, insect
   pollinator groups were not associated with unmanaged vegetation. In the
   Simple landscape, dominated by monoculture almond plantations, most

Abstract = {{Pollinator and flowering plant interactions play a critical role in
   maintaining most terrestrial ecosystems, including agroecosystems.
   Although estimates of floral resource availability are essential to
   understand plant-pollinator relationships, no generally accepted
   methodology exists to date. We compared two methods for sampling floral
   resources in a single meadow. About every three days, we recorded
   species lists of insect-pollinated plants with abundance categories
   assigned to each species (hereafter referred to as scanning) and we
   counted the flowering shoots in 36 2x2m quadrats (hereafter quadrat
   sampling). These methods were compared with respect to (i) the number of
   species detected, (ii) estimated floral resource abundance, and (iii)
   temporal changes in flowering. With scanning, we found more potential
   nectar-plant species and species were found earlier than with quadrat
   sampling. With the latter, abundant species were found with higher
   probability than the scarce. Flower abundances were correlated between
   the two methods. We predicted that a cover of 6.33.6\% should be used
   for an appropriate estimate of flower abundance in our study site,
   although the optimal cover probably varies across different habitats.
   Furthermore, flower abundance changed 6\% per day compared to the
   flowering peak. Overall, scanning seems to be more appropriate for
   detecting presence and the timing of species, while quadrats may provide
   higher resolution for abundance estimates. Increased sampling coverage
   and frequency may enhance research accuracy and using scanning and
   quadrat sampling simultaneously may help to optimize research effort. We
   encourage further development of sampling protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Holoparasites have evolved a number of adaptations for pollination in
   parallel with their parasitic strategies. Complex floral pigmentation
   patterns, comprising spots or stripes that act as visual nectar or
   landing guides for pollinators, are common and diversified, but their
   structure and function are poorly understood and almost nothing is known
   about the role that micromorphological features might play in generating
   or complementing those visual stimuli. By means of scanning electron and
   confocal digital microscopy, petal micromorphology was analysed in the
   two subspecies of the holoparasitic Cistanche phelypaea (subsp.
   phelypaea and subsp. lutea, Orobanchaceae). Plant material was collected
   in the semi-deserts of southeastern Spain in 2009 (subsp. lutea), and in
   coastal salt marshes in southern Portugal in 2012 (subsp. phelypaea).
   Cistanche phelypaea subspecies were already known to differ in several
   morphological features of flowers and leaves, as well as in their
   habitats and hosts. Our data have shown that they also differ in several
   micromorphological features of the petal epidermis. Three different
   sculpture types of the petal epidermis were recognized. Our results show
   that petal micromorphology can be used in the separation of taxa, with
   potential utility in the determination of dried specimens in this genus,
   inherently poorly preserved in herbaria. The putative influence of the
   visual and tactile effects originating from this micromorphological
   variability on the interactions between plants and pollinators and in
   the reproductive biology of the former is discussed in detail.}},

Title = {{Reproductive traits affect the rescue of valuable and endangered
   multipurpose tropical trees}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Conservation strategies are urgently needed in Tropical areas for widely
   used tree species. Increasing numbers of species are threatened by
   overexploitation and their recovery might be poor due to low
   reproductive success and poor regeneration rates. One of the first steps
   in developing any conservation policy should be an assessment of the
   reproductive biology of species that are threatened by overexploitation.
   This work aimed to study the flowering biology, pollination and breeding
   system of V. doniana, a multipurpose threatened African tree, as one
   step in assessing the development of successful conservation strategies.
   To this end, we studied (1) traits directly involved in pollinator
   attraction like flowering phenology, flower numbers and morphology, and
   floral rewards; (2) abundance, diversity and efficiency of flower
   visitors; (3) breeding system, through controlled hand-pollination
   experiments involving exclusion of pollinators and pollen from different
   sources; and (4) optimal conditions for seed germination. The flowering
   phenology was asynchronous among inflorescences, trees and sites. The
   flowers produced a large quantity of pollen and nectar with high sugar
   content. Flowers attracted diverse and abundant visitors, counting both
   insects and birds, and efficient pollinators included several
   Hymenoptera species. We detected no spontaneous self-pollination,
   indicating a total dependence on pollen vectors. Vitex doniana is
   self-compatible and no inbreeding depression occurred in the first
   developmental stages. After extraction of the seed from the fruit, seed
   germination did not require any particular conditions or pre-treatments
   and the seeds showed high germination rates. These pollination and
   breeding characteristics as well as germination potential offer the
   required conditions to develop successful conservation strategies.
   Protection, cultivation and integration in agroforestry systems are
   required to improve the regeneration of the tree.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Interspecific hybridization is widespread among plants; nevertheless,
   pre- and post-zygotic isolating mechanisms may maintain species
   integrity for interfertile species in sympatry despite some gene flow.
   Interspecific hybridization and potential isolating barriers were
   evaluated between co-flowering Silene asclepiadea and Silene yunnanensis
   in an alpine community in southwest China. We investigated morphological
   and molecular (nuclear microsatellites and chloroplast gene sequence)
   variation in sympatric populations of S. asclepiadea and S. yunnanensis.
   Additionally, we analyzed pollinator behaviour and compared reproductive
   success between the putative hybrids and their parental species. Both
   the molecular and morphological data indicate that there were putative
   natural hybrids in the field, with S. asclepiadae the ovule parent and
   S. yunnanensis the pollen parent. Bumblebees were the primary visitors
   to S. asclepiadae and putative hybrids, while butterflies were the
   primary visitors to S. yunnanensis. Pollen production and viability were
   significantly lower in putative hybrids than the parental species. The
   direction of hybridization is quite asymmetric from S. yunnanensis to S.
   asclepiadea. Protandry combined with later peak flowering of S.
   yunnanensis, and pollinator preference may have contributed to the
   asymmetric pattern of hybridization, but putative hybrids were rare. Our
   results thus suggest that despite gene flow, S. asclepiadea and S.
   yunnanensis can maintain species boundaries, perhaps as a result of
   floral isolation and low fecundity of the hybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal pollinators such as moths have received less attention than
   diurnal insects. To elucidate whether nocturnal moths are important
   pollinators, we observed both the diurnal and nocturnal visitors to the
   flowers of Uncaria rhynchophylla (Rubiaceae) in a warm-temperate forest
   in central Japan. The diurnal visitors included various taxonomic groups
   (e.g., bees, hoverflies and butterflies). The nocturnal visitors were
   exclusively moths (Geometridae, Erebidae, Noctuidae and Crambidae).
   Pollen grains of U. rhynchophylla were attached to both diurnal and
   nocturnal visitors. Although diurnal flower visitors carried pollen
   grains of other plant species, nocturnal moths did not carry
   heterospecific pollen grains. These results suggest that nocturnal
   moths, as well as diurnal insects, are important pollinators of U.
   rhynchophylla.}},

Title = {{The efficiency of bees in pollinating ephemeral flowers of Jacquemontia
   bracteosa (Convolvulaceae)}},
Journal = {{IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{106}},
Abstract = {{The family Convolvulaceae is widely distributed in tropical regions,
   mainly in open areas. Convolvulaceae flowers are characterized mainly by
   being beautiful and ephemeral, attracting many flower visitors that
   belong to different taxonomic groups. This work aimed to investigate the
   interactions between insects and flowers of Jacquemontia bracteosa
   (Convolvulaceae), focusing on the pollination efficiency, in an area in
   the Brazilian semiarid. From November 2011 to October 2012, floral
   biology of J. bracteosa was investigated as well as the flower visit
   frequency, behavior, and morphology of floral visitors. The flowers of
   J. bracteosa are white, showy and open early in the morning, lasting
   less than 12 hours, with fruiting occurring both by selfing and
   outcrossing fecundation. A total of 337 specimens insects were collected
   on J. bracteosa flowers during the field observations. The Neotropical
   bee, Ancyloscelis apiformis, was considered the most efficient
   pollinator of J. bracteosa. This bee showed appropriate behavior, high
   frequency (64\% of the total sample), and was constant on the flowers.
   Furthermore, they arrived soon when the flowers began to open and
   presented 90\% of efficiency in tests of flower pollination of J.
   bracteosa. Other native bee species also visited the flowers of J.
   bracteosa and may be considered potential pollinators because they
   presented behavior and morphology compatible with the flowers. This
   study suggests that maintenance of weeds or ruderal plants, especially
   those that also have ornamental potential in anthropic area, may be an
   option for the preservation of local native pollinators, which are
   threatened by environmental degradation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{81-141}},
Abstract = {{The present contribution is a first brief attempt to give an overview of
   flower visiting by aculeate wasps and bees in the Dubai Desert
   Conservation Reserve (DDCR), and as far as has been established the
   first of its kind for the United Arab Emirates. Seventeen sites within
   the reserve were well sampled and, in order to see the reserve in
   relation to its position in the peninsula, two one day transects were
   undertaken, one of brief sampling at six sites east from the reserve to
   the coast at Khor Kalba and the other of brief sampling at five sites
   west from the reserve to the coast in the marine reserve of the Emirates
   Marine Environmental Group (EMEC). Flower visitors were observed and
   sampled on 21 species of plants within the DDCR and on two additional
   species east of the DDCR and two west of the DDCR. Fifty-one species of
   aculeate wasps and 27 species of bees were recorded. Of the wasps, 34
   species were from the DDCR and the additional 15 from transects east and
   west of the Reserve. Of the bees, 23 species were from the DDCR and the
   additional two from transects east and west of the Reserve. Flower
   sampling yielded flower visiting records for 39 species of aculeate
   wasps and 23 species of bees. Although this preliminary survey of flower
   visiting by wasps and bees in the DDCR was conducted over a limited
   period of time, during a dry spring, following seven dry years, it has
   provided sufficient data to draw some general conclusions: most of the
   plants attract visits from a complex of both wasps and bees; the flowers
   of some plants attract a wide range of wasps and bees but there were no
   flowers that were attractive to all available wasps and bees at any one
   site; very few species of the wasps and bees encountered were
   specialists; and the plants on which these specialist wasps and bees
   were dependent were not themselves dependent on these species for
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of factors influencing spatial variation in flower size offer
   insights into floral evolution. We investigated altitudinal variations
   in five flower dimensions of two native Japanese Impatiens species (I.
   textori and I. noli-tangere) and their interactions with their faunal
   visitors. These two species have similar floral traits, including flower
   shape, flowering time, and pollinator species; both species are
   pollinated mainly by Bombus diversus. In I. textori, all measured flower
   dimensions were negatively correlated with altitude. In contrast, in I.
   noli-tangere, no measured flower dimensions correlated with altitude.
   Thus, the altitudinal pattern of flower size variation differed between
   these congeneric co-habiting herbaceous plant species. The different
   patterns suggest that the factors (e.g. altitudinal variations of
   abiotic factors) that cause variation of flower size differ between
   these two Impatiens species even though focal species have similar
   floral traits (e.g. flower shape, flowering time, and pollinator
   species).}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the biodiversity and palaeoecology of the 23
   million year old Foulden Maar, the first Konservat-Lagerstatte deposit
   described from New Zealand and a key site for reconstructing early
   Miocene Southern Hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems. The 1000-m-diameter,
   ca 200-m-deep Foulden Maar volcanic crater lake was a closed system with
   anoxic bottom waters, capturing and preserving in exquisite detail
   organisms from the lake and adjacent rainforest. The fossils include
   numerous leaves, flowers with in situ pollen, fruits, seeds, fish and
   arthropods. Surrounding Foulden Maar was an evergreen,
   Lauraceae-dominated notophyll vine forest with a diverse understorey,
   lianes, epiphytes and mistletoes. Diverse pollination and seed dispersal
   modes are evident. Fish include larval to adult stages of articulated
   specimens of Galaxias, some with preserved soft tissue and a species of
   eel resembling Anguilla. The arthropod fauna comprises ca 20 families in
   the orders Araneae (spiders), Plecoptera (stoneflies), Odonata
   (dragonflies), Isoptera (termites), Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera (true
   flies), Coleoptera (beetles), Trichoptera (caddis flies) and Hymenoptera
   (wasps, ants and bees), representing faunas typical of soil, leaf
   litter, forest floor or freshwater habitats. Many fossil taxa have close
   relatives in the extant New Zealand biota; others are now locally
   extinct. Coprolites containing quartz sands sourced from outside the
   lake indicate the presence of volant birds, presumably waterfowl. The
   Foulden Maar Lagerstatte is crucial for reconstructing Miocene lake and
   forest ecosystems in New Zealand, particularly the terrestrial arthropod
   component.}},

   for plant species and 0.20 for pollinator species), suggesting that
   pollination services in this system may exhibit some resilience to
   environmental perturbations. Possible conservation strategies for
   maintaining pollination services in this ecological system are
   discussed, including habitat management to conserve larval or nesting
   areas for social and solitary bees and scarab beetles, as well as
   further inventories and long-term monitoring of pollinator species.}},

Abstract = {{Four accessions of rocket of wild origin held at the Universidad
   Politecnica de Madrid germplasm bank were regenerated in isolated cages
   with bumblebees as pollinators. The genetic diversity of parental (P)
   and regenerated (R) populations was studied by means of molecular
   markers: RAPD and two Brassica rapa SSR loci. From RAPD markers, UPGMA
   cluster analysis was performed; diversity was estimated using Shannon's
   index and AMOVA. Differences in marker frequency between P and R
   populations of each accession were analysed through the chi(2) test.
   Frequencies of SSR alleles, genetic diversity estimators (F-ST, F-IS)
   and AMOVA were calculated. The results obtained with RAPD markers were
   in accordance with those from SSRs and indicate that the regeneration
   process had only minor effects on the genetic diversity of samples in
   three out of four studied accessions. Detected changes in the frequency
   of markers were in most cases negligible and do not seem to constitute
   either a significant loss of genetic variability or risk of genetic
   erosion, except when seed dormancy or other factors involving selection
   are acting, as it might have happened in Ev9107. It has been
   demonstrated that Brassica rapa SSR markers can be effectively used for
   Eruca vesicaria.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluated if railway embankments and road verges
   create refuge habitats for bee flora across agricultural landscape. The
   survey was conducted in 2009-2012, in the Lublin Province, SE Poland.
   Data on the bee forage flora were obtained while making floristic charts
   along 60 transect plots x 300 m, with a total length of 18 000 m, for
   each type of linear structure. Forage bee flora was compared with
   respect to species richness, diversity, and evenness indices. The
   canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to characterize
   relationship between species composition and environmental variables.
   The bee forage species richness and abundance were significantly greater
   on railway embankments than on road verges. The composition of species
   varied considerably; the number of bee forage species common to both
   habitats was only approximately 38\% in entire data set. Most good-value
   bee forage species were recorded along the embankments of railways with
   an intermediate traffic volume. Bee forage species diversity benefits
   from the location of habitat elements (forests or meadows), primarily if
   the distance is <50 m. The lack of dense patches of valuable bee forage
   species in the road verges was related to the high density of
   non-nectariferous graminoids. Our results demonstrate how the value of
   man-made areas in an agricultural ecosystem can vary with respect to
   floral resources across the landscape, suggesting that it is
   inappropriate to generalize about agricultural systems as a whole
   without first addressing differences among habitats.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees are important contributors to the pollination ecosystem
   service, but they are especially vulnerable to agricultural
   intensification which causes the loss and fragmentation of natural
   habitats. We monitored bumblebee populations (Bombus spp.) in 14
   grassland patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic in
   the Mezofold region, Hungary. We asked how bumblebee populations were
   affected by local vegetation quality and the presence of various
   landscape elements, including fields in agri-environmental schemes, at
   various spatial scales. A stratified analysis revealed that vegetation
   quality, especially the lack of weeds, was the most important local
   factor that positively affected both bumblebee abundance and species
   number. We found no significant landscape scale effects between 50-250
   m. Between 500-1000 m grassland area in the landscape had consistently
   significant positive effect on species richness. At the 2 km scale the
   extent of arable fields had a negative impact on both abundance and
   richness. A higher percentage area of arable fields in the landscape
   participating in agri-environmental schemes had no positive effect on
   bumblebee abundance or species richness. Considering all local and
   landscape effects and their possible interactions, model selection and
   variance partitioning revealed that local factors were the most
   important determinants of bumblebee richness and abundance. Local and
   landscape factors had high shared variance but did not interact with
   each other. The present study indicated that small scale landscape
   composition had the lowest importance, but larger scale landscape
   composition was significant, most likely because bumblebees can forage
   far from their nests. If we are able to provide good quality grassland
   patches incorporated into the agricultural habitat mosaic, then we can
   build on the strong spill over propensity of bumblebees and can expect
   their contribution to the pollination of various crops.}},

Abstract = {{A remarkable diversity of new nonempidoid orthorrhaphan flies from the
   mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar (Late Albian Early Cenomanian, ca. 99 Ma) is
   presented, including 28 species (all but one new) in 22 genera (13 new),
   and at least 12 families. Two families are new; three genera are
   unplaced in Tabanomorpha and one unplaced within Brachycera. Comparisons
   are presented between the amber taxa and extensive lithified taxa from.
   the Jurassic and Cretaceous of eastern Laurasia.
   In Stratiomyomorpha: A new species of Zhangsolvidae has color patterns
   and body shape that apparently mimic Vespidae or other stinging aculeate
   wasps. Diverse new Xylomyidae and Stratiomyidae are described, the
   latter with male terminalia preserved in detail. In Tabanomorpha: The
   genus Athericites Mostovski et al. is synonymized with Palaepangonius
   Ren, and a new species of Galloatherix Nel is described in which the
   female proboscis is much longer than that of the male. All three genera
   were attributed to Athericidae, but the amber species reveal they are
   more basal tabanomorphs. Described are a new genus of stem-group
   Tabanoidea and a new species of Cratotabanus Martins-Neto and
   Kucero-Santos (Tabanidae), previously known from the Cretaceous of
   Brazil and New Jersey. In Nemestrinoidea: Three species of Hirmoneura
   Meigen are the first Nemestrinidae known from amber; one species has
   long cerci typical of Recent species of the genus. A new species of the
   Mesozoic family Rhagionemestriidae reveals this family is closely
   related to Acroceridae, not Xylophagidae as previously proposed. In
   Archisargoidea: A new species of Tethepomyiidae is described, the family
   known only in Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, Spain, and Myanmar. In
   Asiloidea: Three new species and genera of Bombyliidae are described,
   two of them with abdominal setal ``baskets{''} distinctive to females of
   higher bombyliids. A fourth new asiloid genus is a probable stem-group
   bombyliid. The recently described Pseudorhagio Zhang et al., is
   transferred from Tabanomorpha to Bombyliidae. The male of a new species
   of Burmapsilocephala Gaimari and Mostovski (Apsilocephalidae) has
   terminalia very similar to that of Evocoa (Evocoidae: Recent, Chile),
   corroborating close relationship of the two families. In Families
   incertae sedis: A new species of Hilarimorphites Grimaldi and Cumming
   (Apystomyiidae) is described, the family known only in New Jersey and
   Burmese amber and the Recent fauna of California, and a sister group to
   either Cyclorrhapha or Eremoneura. Mysteromyiidae and Eucaudomyiidae,
   new families, are described, based on highly modified species with
   vestigial mouthparts, reduced venation, and unique specializations.
   Discussion is presented on some morphological features in fossil and
   Recent Brachycera that have apparent phylogenetic significance but are
   rarely discussed. This study adds further data to the phenotypic
   diversity, geological history, and biogeography of a major radiation.}},

Pages = {{241-247}},
Abstract = {{Pan traps are among the most popular methods employed to survey bees and
   changes in some functional traits, such as body size, are increasingly
   used to understand how bee communities and species respond to landscape
   changes. Herein we assess body size differences between bees captured at
   ground-level and elevated (70 cm) pan traps in unmanaged urban habitats
   in northwestern Turkey. We compare body size at the community level as
   well as for the sweat bee Lasioglossum malachurum (Kirby) (Halictidae:
   Halictini), the most abundant species. We also compare the diversity,
   richness and abundance of bees sampled at both heights. A total of 31
   species (13 genera of three families) were captured. We did not find
   significant differences in the abundance nor in the species richness
   between heights, and Simpson's indices were similar. At the community
   level, average intertegular distance was significantly greater in bees
   collected at the elevated traps than on the ground. Intertegular
   distances in L. malachurum did not differ between elevated and
   ground-level pan traps. Our results show an effect of pan trap height on
   bee body size in the urban habitat surveyed, thus suggesting that
   assessing bee body size from samples collected with either ground-level
   or elevated pan traps alone might result in biased estimates of this
   functional trait.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitoids use volatiles to recognize and locate suitable hosts.
   Numerous studies have investigated parasitoid host location from a pest
   management perspective, but comparatively little is known regarding
   parasitoid-pollinator interactions. Previous research has shown that
   parasitoids of some native bees respond to volatiles emitted by host
   frass and cocoons. We used a Y-tube bioassay to test whether two
   parasitoid species (Monodontomerus torchioi and Melittobia acasta) are
   attracted to volatiles associated with their host, the blue orchard bee,
   Osmia lignaria. Specifically, we tested attraction to (1) cocooned adult
   O. lignaria females (2) O. lignaria frass (3) methanol and (4) acetic
   acid. Both parasitoid species were attracted to host frass and acetic
   acid. Although M. acasta showed a strong attraction to volatiles from
   cocooned O. lignaria females, it was repelled by methanol, a chemical
   constituent of Osmia cocoons. In contrast, M. torchioi showed no
   response to cocooned O. lignaria and only a slight attraction to
   methanol. Both parasitoid species appear to be differentially attracted
   to specific host-associated volatiles, suggesting that they may respond
   to distinct olfactory cues when locating potential bee hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Diptera is one of the most widespread order of pollinators within
   Angiosperms and the more important pollinator group of the orchid
   subtribe Pleurothallidinae. Acianthera aphthosa (Lindl.)
   Pridgeon\&M.W.Chase was studied in a Brazilian nature reserve, covering
   aspects of phenology, floral morpho-anatomy, flower histochemistry,
   pollinators, pollination mechanisms and reproductive system. A. aphthosa
   possess multicellular papillae on the inner surface of the sepals, which
   release a fetid dung-like fragrance. The fragrance is released by apical
   stomata, and attracts several fly species of the families Calliphoridae,
   Muscidae, Sarcophagidae and Ulidiidae. However, only one species of
   Acrosticta (Ulidiidae) was shown to be an effective pollinator. The
   upper surface of the labellum possesses a secretory tissue that
   apparently is related to nectar production, although the secretion is
   retained under the cuticle. As is common in fly-pollinated orchids, the
   Diptera are trapped by the flower. However, contrary to what is reported
   for other myophilous orchids, the pollinators of A. aphthosa are not
   frightened after leaving the flower and commonly visit further flowers
   on the same plant and inflorescence. In this case, the retention of the
   anther cap by the pollinarium, tend to reduce the geitonogamous
   self-pollination. A. aphthosa is self-compatible but
   pollinator-dependent. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
   record of complete self-compatibility in Acianthera. The low amount of
   seeds without embryos in self-pollinated flowers, in contrast to
   cross-pollinations, seems to be a consequence of inbreeding depression.}},

Title = {{Floral biology and pollination of two sympatric species of Galipeinae
   (Galipeeae, Rutaceae) endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{221}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{107-116}},
Abstract = {{Galipeinae is the most diversified group of neotropical Rutaceae,
   presenting a wide floral diversity. However, the floral features in the
   species of the group have rarely been studied, hindering the
   understanding of functional aspects of particular floral attributes in
   relation to the biology. In this study, we investigate the floral
   biology and pollination of Angostura bracteata and Conchocarpus
   macrophyllus (Galipeinae), which are co-flowering and sympatric species
   occurring in the Atlantic forest of southeastern Brazil. Both species
   have tubular, nectar-rewarding, monosymmetric flowers, with two fertile
   stamens on the posterior side of the flower and five anterior
   staminodes. C. macrophyllus is most frequently pollinated by butterflies
   and less frequently pollinated by medium-sized bees. A. bracteata is
   also frequently pollinated by butterflies, shared, in part with C
   macrophyllus, and less frequently pollinated by settling moths and by
   hummingbirds. Since we found that butterflies transfer the pollen grains
   Of C macrophyllus and A. bracteata through different body parts, it is
   unlikely that interspecific pollen mixture occurs, despite pollinator
   sharing. Although functionally generalized, most floral features
   indicate specialization for pollination by lepidopterans in both
   species. So, the related floral attributes consist of a long and narrow
   floral tube, as well as delicate landing platforms, and nectaries that
   produce minute quantities of dilute nectar, among others. Functional
   staminodes presenting pollen secondarily in the ventral region of the
   flower in A. bracteata are herein reported for the first time for
   Rutaceae, which results in a wider spatial presentation of pollen and
   may also increase the accuracy of sternotribic pollination. In C.
   macrophyllus, the staminodes bear pollen-collecting hairs, which may
   avoid spontaneous self-pollination or serve to scrape pollen from the
   tongues of pollinators. Our results indicate that the function of
   staminodes in the biology of the species may have influenced their
   maintenance throughout the floral evolution of Galipeinae. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Bees are important models to study the physiological role of endocrine
   cells. These cells produce hormones and may be open or closed cells
   depending on whether they have direct or indirect contact with the gut
   lumen, respectively. Food is digested and absorbed in the insect midgut.
   The objective of this study was to identify endocrine cells in the
   midgut of bees of different levels of sociability to understand the
   function of these cells. The midgut of Centris fuscata, Epicharis flava,
   Euglossa imperialis, Eulaema nigrita, Frieseomelitta varia, Megachile
   rava, and Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)
   was subjected to immunohistochemistry test for FMRF-amide. The midguts
   of E. imperialis, E. nigrita, and M. rava showed closed
   FMRFamide-positive endocrine cells, and those of E. flava, F. varia, and
   M. quadrifasciata anthidioides showed open cells. The greater number of
   open FMRFamide-positive cells suggest that this peptide probably
   regulates the synthesis of digestive enzymes without cell receptor and
   signal transductors, while closed FMRFamide-positive cells suggest that
   these peptides may play a role in regulating peristaltic movements of
   digestive tract. Presence of FMRFamide-positive cells in the bees,
   regardless of their sociability level, reflects the phylogenetic
   conservation of the peptide FMRFamide family in these bees.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},

Pages = {{1859-1873}},
Abstract = {{Exomalopsis are ground-nesting species, and their food-niche breadth is
   little known due the difficulty in locating the nests and finding
   efficient bait plants to attract these bees. Some species of Exomalopsis
   were recorded as tomato, hot pepper and eggplant pollinators.
   Information about the food niche could be useful to increase Exomalopsis
   populations, providing consistent and comparable data for the enrichment
   of natural and crop areas with adequate plant sources. This study aimed
   to determine the food niche and the role of pollen size in the diet of
   E. fulvofasciata. We analysed pollen loads of 28 individuals of E.
   fulvofasciata collected from bait plants, in two natural areas of the
   Brazilian savannah. Only five pollen types belonging to the families
   Malpighiaceae, Solanaceae, Leguminosae, Myrtaceae and Lythraceae were
   important for this species. This result indicates that E. fulvofasciata
   is probably a polylectic species. However, we noticed that the Byrsonima
   used as bait plants contribute significantly for its larval provision,
   indicating that small pollen grains were more frequently collected.}},

   secondary pollen presentation mechanism as a device to avoid autonomous
   autogamy but it does not prevent geitonogamy. the fruit set largely
   occurs through geitonogamy and xenogamy. the papilionid and pierid
   butterflies, and sphingid hawk moth pollinate the flowers while
   collecting nectar. Honey bees and blue-banded digger bees feed on pollen
   and effect only accidental pollination. the nectar is sucrose-rich and
   contains essential and non-essential amino acids. birds are seed
   dispersal agents. Seeds are non-dormant and germinate readily but their
   continued growth and establishment is subject to the availability of
   soil moisture and nutrients. the plant is not able to populate itself in
   its natural area. further, the local uses of flowers and leaves of this
   plant appear to be negatively affecting its reproductive success. P.
   tomentosa serves as a keystone species for bees and butterflies because
   this is the only prominent and profuse flowering species during dry

   importance of mouthpart dimensions in effective pollen removal and
   deposition}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Pollination studies often use visitation frequency of potential
   pollinators as an indicator of their importance, but this is only one
   component and may not reflect actual pollen transfer rates. In this
   study, we determine the most effective pollinator group of Angadenia
   berteroi, a tropical perennial subshrub with large yellow flowers that
   set few fruits. We determined visitation frequency and pollen transfer
   effectiveness of the four most common groups of visitors (long-and
   short-tongued bees, and skipper and non-skipper butterflies). Using
   potted plants, we exposed flowers to single visits from different types
   of pollinators to measure fruit set. We demonstrate that A. berteroi is
   most effectively pollinated by long-tongued bees, though many other
   species visit the flowers; the most frequent visitor group is not the
   most important pollinator, because they neither carry nor deposit much
   pollen, as the width of their proboscis is small compared with
   long-tongued bees. In this system, the width of the proboscis of the
   pollinators correlates with pollen transfer efficiency. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of pollen removal, pollen deposition, and
   fruit set, in determining the most effective pollinators, rather than
   visitor frequency. The distinctive morphology of these flowers, with a
   large bell and a narrow, short tube, suggests that other flowers of this
   shape maysimilarly benefit more from visitors with mouthparts shorter
   than previously considered optimal.}},

Title = {{High levels of genetic diversity and population structure in an endemic
   and rare species: implications for conservation}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{The analysis of genetic structure and variability of isolated species is
   of critical importance in evaluating whether stochastic or human-caused
   factors are affecting rare species. Low genetic diversity compromises
   the ability of populations to evolve and reduces their chances of
   survival under environmental changes. Petunia secreta, a rare and
   endemic species, is an annual and heliophilous herb that is
   bee-pollinated and easily recognizable by its purple and salverform
   corolla. It was described as a new species of the Petunia genus in 2005.
   Few individuals of P. secreta have been observed in nature and little is
   known about this species. All the natural populations of P. secreta that
   were found were studied using 15 microsatellite loci, two intergenic
   plastid sequences and morphological traits. Statistical analysis was
   performed to describe the genetic diversity of this rare species and the
   results compared with those of more widespread and frequent Petunia
   species from the same geographic area to understand whether factors
   associated with population size could affect rare species of this genus.
   The results showed that despite its rarity, P. secreta presented high
   genetic diversity that was equivalent to or even higher than that of
   widespread Petunia species. It was shown that this species is divided
   into two evolutionary lineages, and the genetic differentiation indices
   between them and other congeneric species presented different patterns.
   The major risk to P. secreta maintenance is its rarity, suggesting the
   necessity of a preservation programme and more biological and
   evolutionary studies that handle the two evolutionary lineages
   independently.}},

Abstract = {{The bee subgenus Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) Toro \& Moldenke, 1979
   (Hymenoptera, Colletidae, Xeromelissinae) is revised. The subgenus is
   considered endemic to Chile and occurs across a broad range of habitats.
   Eight new species are described: Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) charizard
   Monckton, sp. n., Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) curvapeligrosa Monckton,
   sp. n., Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) guanicoe Monckton, sp. n., Chilicola
   (Heteroediscelis) katherinae Monckton, sp. n., Chilicola
   (Heteroediscelis) lickana Monckton, sp. n., Chilicola (Heteroediscelis)
   mayu Monckton, sp. n., Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) packeri Monckton, sp.
   n., and Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) randolphi Monckton, sp. n. One of
   the existing species, Chilicola (Heteroediscelis) valparaiso Toro \&
   Moldenke, 1979, syn. n., is treated as a junior synonym of Chilicola
   (Heteroediscelis) mantagua Toro \& Moldenke, 1979, and the nine
   remaining valid species are redescribed. Thoroughly illustrated keys to
   species for males and females are provided, along with habitus images,
   images of male terminalia, distribution maps for each species, and a map
   of relevant Chilean biogeographic regions. Results of phylogenetic
   analyses are presented, based upon 74 morphological characters and on
   CO1 barcode sequences, analyzed both separately and as a combined
   dataset. Monophyly of the subgenus is supported, and groupings within
   the subgenus are discussed in light of a biogeographic analysis of their
   species distributions (spatial analysis of vicariance), whereby
   divergence between taxa is found to occur primarily via north-south
   disjunctions.}},

   BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APOIDEA: ANTHOPHILA) ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD,
   MASSACHUSETTS}},

Abstract = {{An intensive survey of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila) on
   Martha's Vineyard, the largest offshore island in Massachusetts, USA,
   was conducted mostly from 2010-2011 at over 60 sites across the island's
   six towns. From over 14,500 specimens collected, processed and
   databased, we document 182 bee species in 31 genera. Historical records
   of an additional four species were identified from museum collections.
   Most bee specimens were collected from trap lines of bee bowls deployed
   to maximize coverage of habitats, and many others by direct collection
   targeting known host plants of pollen specialists (oligoleges) and their
   cleptoparasites. The island's fauna is more species-rich and includes a
   diverse assemblage of sand-nesting specialists (psammophiles) and pollen
   specialists with broader botanical associations than the recorded faunas
   of other regional islands. Notable finds include the first records of
   Anthophora walshii Cresson from the northeastern USA since the 1970s;
   two oligoleges of Maleberry Lyonia ligustrina (L.), Colletes productus
   Robertson and Melitta melittoides (Viereck); the parasitic Nomada
   rodecki Mitchell, newly associated with M. melittoides and newly placed
   within the Nomada basalis species group (previously associated with
   Melitta in Europe); and two species (in addition to N. rodecki) newly
   recorded from Massachusetts: Andrena neonana Viereck and Nomada xanthura
   Cockerell. We note 23 species not recorded from other Massachusetts
   offshore islands, of which 19 were unrecorded from southeastern
   Massachusetts. Two bumble bee species in the nominate subgenus Bombus,
   B. affinis Cresson and B. terricola Kirby, that have undergone regional
   declines were recorded historically from Martha's Vineyard and nearby
   islands but not found in this survey. Tables and figures are provided to
   summarize the phenology, taxonomic and behavioral composition of the
   island's bee fauna, which are discussed with reference to the faunas of
   Massachusetts, New York, and comparable mainland and island sites. As
   with other studies employing extensive bee bowl-trapping we found the
   most numerous species caught to be eusocial halictines. Our results
   underscore the role of maritime habitats underlain by sandy soils in
   sustaining regional diversity of bees in addition to Lepidoptera and
   other well-documented insect groups. Collection of a large proportion of
   pollen specialists and cleptoparasitic species from one but not both
   sampling years reinforces the need for multi-year studies of bee faunas.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed protocol for chemical clearing of bee specimens is presented.
   Dry specimens as well as those preserved in liquid media can be cleared
   using this protocol. The procedure consists of a combined use of
   alkaline solution (KOH or NaOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), followed
   by the boiling of the cleared specimens in 60-70\% EtOH. Clearing is
   particularly useful for internal skeletal morphological research. This
   procedure allows for efficient study of internal projections of the
   exoskeleton (e.g., apodemes, furcae, phragmata, tentoria, internal
   ridges and sulci), but this process makes external features of the
   integument, as some sutures and sulci, readily available for observation
   as well. Upon completion of the chemical clearing process the specimens
   can be stored in glycerin. This procedure was developed and evaluated
   for the preparation of bees and other Apoidea, but modifications for use
   with other insect taxa should be straightforward after some
   experimentation on variations of timing of steps, concentration of
   solutions, temperatures, and the necessity of a given step. Comments on
   the long-term storage, morphological examination, and photodocumentation
   of cleared specimens are also provided. (C) 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de

Abstract = {{Climate warming in the coming decades may affect diapause in insect
   species which use it to survive unfavorable winter conditions. Plebeia
   droryana (Friese) (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) is a highly eusocial
   bee species that exhibits reproductive diapause and inhabits southern
   South America where winter temperatures may fall below 10A degrees C, or
   even below 0A degrees C in extreme years. In this paper, we evaluate
   whether P. droryana might terminate diapause during winter under
   laboratory conditions. We initially kept colonies of P. droryana at 8A
   degrees C in a biochemical oxygen demand chamber, and then raised the
   temperature by 2A degrees C every 3 d until the cessation of diapause
   was detected, as indicated by the onset of brood cell building and
   subsequent egg-laying by queens. We found that the termination of
   diapause in P. droryana could be achieved at temperatures between 16A
   degrees C and 22A degrees C, resulting in typical postdiapause brood
   cell building and egg-laying rates. Our binomial generalized linear
   mixed model indicated that only temperature, but no time or
   temperature-time interaction, explained the probability of termination
   of diapause in P. droryana. Again, only temperature, but no time or
   temperature-time interaction, significantly affected amount of brood
   cell built postdiapause in this species. These data suggest that the
   levels of predicted climate warming in the geographic range of P.
   droryana over the coming decades will probably result in these
   populations abandoning diapause behavior. These results have important
   implications regarding the ecological service of crop and wild plant
   pollination provided by this species.}},

   bicornis (L.), in a long-term study. Increasing tube diameter positively
   affected both progeny sex ratio and body size. Sex ratio, but not
   progeny body mass, was negatively affected by short tube length.
   Building costs rose with increasing diameter accompanied by deteriorated
   efficiency of tube space utilization. Although female bees used a wide
   spectrum of nest dimensions, artificial nest tubes of 8-10 mm internal
   diameter and a length of at least 150 mm were optimal.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Application of phosphate (P) fertilizers to farmland is projected to be
   causing worldwide accumulation of fluorine (F) in agricultural soils and
   associated ecosystems, but wide-scale field data have been lacking. We
   report results of sampling across two large regions of New Zealand
   involving soils of 298 native and farmed properties. This has enabled
   the first wide-scale retrospective estimates of anthropogenic F
   enrichment in pastoral and horticultural soils. Results validate earlier
   projections: F accumulation in farmed soils has been comparatively rapid
   (mean increase 2.1 \% per year) and widespread. Over 50 years, average
   total F concentrations in surface soils have doubled from similar to 220
   to 440 mg/kg. Thresholds protective against chronic fluorosis in grazing
   animals are being substantively passed, indicating that land may be
   rendered unsuitable for pastoral production in the mid-term future: when
   sampled 44 \% of dairy farm soil samples exceeded 500 mg/kg total F, and
   10 \% exceeded 650 mg/kg. Potential for F toxicity to plants and
   wildlife appear to be significant and marginal, respectively, at current
   soil F concentrations. Relationships between F and other elements
   suggest P fertilizers are also a source of several elements
   geochemically linked to F, and that anthropogenic F modifies soil
   aluminium (Al) chemistry, potentially opening a broad-scale Al exposure
   pathway to pollinating insects. Findings signal a need for systematic
   examination of the range of possible affects that may be linked to
   increasing soil F, which include various types of ecotoxicity, altered
   Al chemistry, reduced P availability, and potential for increased
   dietary intakes of F, Al and aluminofluoride (AlFx) species over time.}},

   minensis has large, horizontal, cream-colored, chiropterophilous flowers
   with rigid petals that open at dusk and close on the following morning.
   Flowers produced a huge amount of pollen grains and nectar production
   was nocturnal. Controlled pollination experiments revealed that the
   cactus is an obligate xenogamous species. Visitor-exclusion experiments
   revealed that the nocturnal visitors (bats) are the prominent
   pollinators whereas hummingbirds and social bees, which visited the
   flowers early in the morning, contributed little to fruit set. We
   conclude that the reproductive success of this endemic columnar cactus
   is threatened in the absence of the effective pollinating bats. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Nectar robbing occurs when floral visitors remove floral nectar through
   floral damage and usually without providing pollination in return. Even
   though nectar robbing may have negative, neutral or even positive
   effects on plant fitness, few studies have investigated temporal and
   spatial variation in robbing rate and their consequences, particularly
   in the tropics. In this study, robbing levels were estimated during 3
   years in four populations of Salvia gesneriflora, a
   hummingbird-pollinated shrub endemic to central Mexico that is mainly
   robbed by birds, carpenter bees and bumblebees. The effect of robbing on
   nectar availability, flower longevity and on visitation rate by floral
   visitors was also evaluated. Our results indicate great variation in
   robbing levels across years and populations and a positive relationship
   between robbing level and flower abundance per population. Moreover, our
   results show that nectar availability is about eight times higher in
   unrobbed flowers than in robbed flowers, and that nectar robbers prefer
   younger flowers, although lifespan of robbed and unrobbed flowers did
   not differ statistically. Primary and secondary nectar robbers showed a
   higher visitation rate compared to legitimate visitors, and neither
   legitimate nor illegitimate floral visitors seem to discriminate between
   robbed and unrobbed flowers. These results suggest that robbers may
   respond to food availability and that no floral visitors apparently
   could differentiate between robbed and unrobbed flowers. Finally,
   results show that nectar robbers prefer the youngest flowers, which
   suggests that strong competition for access to nectar between
   pollinators and robbers might occur, mainly at the first stages of the
   flowers.}},

Abstract = {{In order to compare the effectiveness of diurnal and nocturnal
   pollinators, we studied the reproductive biology and pollinators of
   Tillandsia heterophylla E. Morren, an epiphytic tank bromeliad endemic
   to southeastern Mexico. Since anthesis in T. heterophylla is
   predominantly nocturnal but lasts until the following day, we
   hypothesised that this bromeliad would receive visits from both diurnal
   and nocturnal visitors, but that nocturnal visitors would be the most
   effective pollinators, since they arrive first to the receptive flower,
   and that bats would be the most frequent nocturnal visitors, given the
   characteristics of the nectar. Flowering of T. heterophylla began in May
   and lasted until July. The species is fully self-compatible, with an
   anthesis that lasts for ca. 15-16 h. Mean volume of nectar produced per
   flower was 82.21 mu l, with a mean sugar concentration of 6.33\%. The
   highest volume and concentration of nectar were found at 20: 00 h, with
   a subsequent decline in both to almost zero over the following 12-h
   period. T. heterophylla has a generalist pollination system, since at
   least four different morphospecies of visitors pollinate its flowers:
   bats, moths, hummingbirds and bees. Most of the pollinating visits
   corresponded to bats and took place in the early evening, when stigma
   receptivity had already begun; making bats the probable pollinator on
   most occasions. However, diurnal pollinators may be important as a
   `fail-safe' system by which to guarantee the pollination of T.
   heterophylla.}},

Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{46-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Colour is one of the most obvious advertisements of flowers, and occurs
   in a huge diversity among the angiosperms. Flower colour is responsible
   for attraction from a distance, whereas contrasting colour patterns
   within flowers aid orientation of flower visitors after approaching the
   flowers. Due to the striking differences in colour vision systems and
   neural processing across animal taxa, flower colours evoke specific
   behavioural responses by different flower visitors. We tested whether
   and how yellow flowers differ in their spectral reflectance depending on
   the main pollinator. We focused on bees and birds and examined whether
   the presence or absence of the widespread UV reflectance pattern of
   yellow flowers predicts the main pollinator. Most bee-pollinated flowers
   displayed a pattern with UV-absorbing centres and UV-reflecting
   peripheries, whereas the majority of bird-pollinated flowers are
   entirely UV-absorbing. In choice experiments we found that bees did not
   show consistent preferences for any colour or pattern types. However,
   all tested bee species made their first antennal contact preferably at
   the UV-absorbing area of the artificial flower, irrespective of its
   spatial position within the flower. The appearance of UV patterns within
   flowers is the main difference in spectral reflectance between yellow
   bee-and bird-pollinated flowers, and affects the foraging behaviour of
   flower visitors. The results support the hypothesis that flower colours
   and the visual capabilities of their efficient pollinators are adapted
   to each other.}},

Title = {{Apomixis does not affect visitation to flowers of Melastomataceae, but
   pollen sterility does}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{132-138}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Apomixis is an asexual seed reproduction mechanism thorough which
   embryos are originated from material tissues inside the ovules, without
   precedent fertilisation. It allows plants to colonise new habitats, even
   in places where flower visitors are scarce or where plants are isolate.
   Apomixis seems to be related to pollen sterility and, in species with
   flowers that offer pollen as a reward for pollinators, the amount or
   quality of the pollen offered by these species may influence the amount
   of the visits and specific composition of the visitors. In order to test
   this hypothesis, we studied breeding systems of 16 species of
   Melastomataceae and their flower visitors, evaluating composition and
   abundance of the visits to apomictic and sexual species. Apomictic
   plants with no viable pollen or with pollen with low viability did not
   receive visits from pollinators, and consequently probably produce
   strictly apomictic fruits. On the other hand, apomictic and sexual
   plants with high pollen viability do receive visits; in this case,
   apomictic plants may produce fruits and seeds through both sexual and
   apomictic methods. The species composition of insects visiting
   Melastomataceae with high pollen viability was similar, regardless of
   whether the plants were apomictic or not. It seems that pollen viability
   levels are important to determine visits to the flowers irrespective of
   breeding system.}},

Abstract = {{We present a first comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny for two
   Neotropical genera of bees, Centris and Epicharis, whose females collect
   floral oil together with pollen for larval provisioning, and that
   traditionally have been grouped in the tribe Centridini. Our analyses
   rely on a matrix of 167 taxa and 4228 aligned nucleotides for the
   subfamily Apinae, with denser sample of Centris and Epicharis. Centris
   and Epicharis are strongly supported monophyletic groups, but Centridini
   is paraphyletic in relation to the corbiculate bees. The inner
   phylogenetic relationships of Epicharis agree with the current taxonomic
   classification. In Centris, three main clades were recovered, namely the
   Centris, Trachina and Melacentris groups. Inner relationships in Centris
   suggest the reinstatement of some subgenera and proposition of new ones.
   Early diversification of Centris and Epicharis took place at the
   tropical regions of South America. Epicharis and the Melacentris group
   in Centris mostly diversified in that region, expanding over Central
   America and tropical North America only recently in the last 3 My. The
   groups Trachina and Centris present a complex biogeographic history,
   with expansions to the Nearctic region, the Antilles, and temperate
   regions of South America in the late Oligocene and Miocene.}},

Abstract = {{Declining pollinator abundance has become a major global environmental
   concern. Almost 90\% of flowering plants rely on animal pollinators for
   reproduction, and negative effects of pollinator declines on crop
   production have been shown. Urbanization is at least partially
   responsible for pollinator declines, and public programs have been
   developed to encourage pollinator-friendly gardens. Here, in an
   observational study, we investigate the relationship between pollinator
   activity and the proportion of native species in unmanipulated private
   gardens in an urban area. Pollinator activity in each of ten gardens was
   recorded at nine times throughout the growing season. Pollinator
   frequency differed among gardens, and visitation was positively
   associated with percent area planted with native species, after
   correcting for effects of time of year, plant density and total garden
   area. The effect of proportion native plant area on pollinator activity
   differed among pollinator guilds, and was particularly strong for bumble
   bees and large bees. The observation of heightened pollinator activity
   with increasing native area in this correlational study suggests that
   cultivating native plant species should be encouraged in urban gardens.
   We discuss that, although such observational studies have the advantage
   of realism, they cannot determine underlying causal factors driving the
   observed correlation.}},

   bees}},

Abstract = {{Inter-specific interactions are important drivers and maintainers of
   biodiversity. Compared to trophic and competitive interactions, the role
   of non-trophic facilitation among species has received less attention.
   Cavity-nesting bees nest in old beetle borings in dead wood, with
   restricted diameters corresponding to the body size of the bee species.
   The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the functional
   diversity of cavity-producing wood boring beetles - in terms of cavity
   diameters - drives the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees. The
   invertebrate communities were sampled in 30 sites, located in forested
   landscapes along an elevational gradient. We regressed the species
   richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees against the species
   richness and abundance of wood boring beetles, non-wood boring beetles
   and elevation. The proportion of cavity nesting bees in bee species
   assemblage was regressed against the species richness and abundance of
   wood boring beetles. We also tested the relationships between the size
   diversity of cavity nesting bees and wood boring beetles. The species
   richness and abundance of cavity nesting bees increased with the species
   richness and abundance of wood boring beetles. No such relationship was
   found for non-wood boring beetles. The abundance of wood boring beetles
   was also related to an increased proportion of cavity nesting bee
   individuals. Moreover, the size diversity of cavity-nesting bees
   increased with the functional diversity of wood boring beetles.
   Specifically, the mean and dispersion of bee body sizes increased with
   the functional dispersion of large wood boring beetles. The positive
   relationships between cavity producing bees and cavity nesting bees
   suggest that non-trophic facilitative interactions between species
   assemblages play important roles in organizing bee species assemblages.
   Considering a community-wide approach may therefore be required if we
   are to successfully understand and conserve wild bee species assemblages
   in forested landscapes.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{302}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Paullinia weinmanniifolia (Sapindaceae) is an endemic Brazilian climber
   found in the Atlantic Forest. The flowers are arranged in
   synflorescences with approximately 34 thyrses. In the studied material,
   each thyrse produced 85.8 male flowers and 15.8 female flowers. The
   small, diclinous and zygomorphic flowers present a sophisticated
   morphology, described here in detail. They are visited by many insects,
   with bees being the main pollinators. Sex expression was investigated by
   monitoring one population of restinga in Marica Environmental Protection
   Area, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, during 2-4 years. Experiments were
   conducted taking into account thyrse, synflorescence, plant and
   population. Most individuals showed a duodichogamic sequence of
   flowering (male-female-male). However, the population overall had a more
   complex flowering pattern: some individuals were protogynous, others
   protandrous; a few individuals produced flowers of only one sex, and
   some individuals changed sex expression in the second year of the study,
   either from male to female or from female to male. This was the first
   ever labile sex expression recorded for the tribe Paullinieae. Anthetic
   female and male flowers were never found simultaneously in the same
   thyrse or synflorescence. Nevertheless, the two flower morphs
   overlapped, though rarely, within the same individual. The pattern of
   flowering observed in this species maximizes the level of outcrossing,
   since the temporal separation of male and female flowers on the same
   plant is precise enough for the species to be regarded as (obligatorily)
   xenogamous.}},

Abstract = {{An absorbing-layer-stack model allows quantitative analysis of the light
   flux in flowers and the resulting reflectance spectra. It provides
   insight in how plants can optimize their flower coloration for
   attracting pollinators.
   The coloration of flowers is due to the combined effect of pigments and
   light-scattering structures. To interpret flower coloration, we applied
   an optical model that considers a flower as a stack of layers, where
   each layer can be treated with the Kubelka-Munk theory for diffusely
   scattering and absorbing media. We applied our model to the flowers of
   the Chilean Bellflower, Nolana paradoxa, which have distinctly
   different-colored adaxial and abaxial sides. We found that the flowers
   have a pigmented, strongly scattering upper layer, in combination with
   an unpigmented, moderately reflecting lower layer. The model allowed
   quantitative interpretation of the reflectance and transmittance spectra
   measured with an integrating sphere. The absorbance spectrum of the
   pigment measured with a microspectrophotometer confirmed the spectrum
   derived by modeling. We discuss how different pigment localizations
   yield different reflectance spectra. The absorbing layer stack model
   aids in understanding the various constraints and options for plants to
   tune their coloration.}},

Abstract = {{Bombus atratus is a native species from South America which has been
   studied for breeding and management for pollination, and methodologies
   are currently being developed to use it as a commercial pollinator. For
   this reason, the aim of the study was to compare the worker's longevity
   and colony development under different environments: open field
   (grassland), greenhouse, and brood chamber. Two colonies were used in
   each environment, all workers were labeled and colonies were checked
   weekly for the number of workers. Results show that worker's longevity
   in open field (12 +/- 4 days) and greenhouse (15 +/- 6 days) is
   significantly less than the worker's longevity in the brood chamber (54
   +/- 20 days). Colony development in open field and greenhouse regarding
   number of workers were similar, with fewer workers than the colonies in
   the brood chamber. The decrease in worker's longevity in open field and
   greenhouse may be due to the influence of environmental factors related
   with the location of the colonies, parasitism or predation, foraging,
   and the resources availability in the area. The workers high mortality
   during the first weeks can be a limiting factor for the colonies
   success. Possible methods to increase the colonies adaptation success

Title = {{Foraging responses of bumble bees to rewardless floral patches:
   importance of within-plant variance in nectar presentation}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in nectar distribution is a key factor
   affecting pollinator movements between flowers and plants within a
   population. Pollinators having systematic searching ability can flexibly
   respond to the reward condition of floral patches, and they tend to
   revisit rewarding patches. However, foraging behaviour may be influenced
   by the nectar distribution within populations. To evaluate the effects
   of unrewarding experiences and plant distribution, we compared bumble
   bee foraging behaviours between naturally rewarding and artificially
   rewardless (by nectary removal) patches in two aconite populations with
   different plant densities. Visitation frequency to the patches, number
   of successive flower visits within inflorescences, and successive
   inflorescence visits within patches were recorded. Nectar production and
   standing crop were also measured. Bumble bees increased the movements
   between neighbouring inflorescences instead of leaving the patches when
   they faced rewardless flowers. A large variance in nectar production
   existed among flowers within plants. This might explain the observed
   bumble bee behaviour, because they could be rewarded by moving to the
   adjacent inflorescences even after a rewardless experience. Our results
   imply that a highly variable nectar reward in a population might mask
   the disadvantage of completely rewardless individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are regularly exported to countries outside their native
   range for the purposes of commercial pollination. In contrast to the
   tight regulations imposed on biological control introductions, the
   movement of bumblebees has largely been without risk assessment. This
   study represents the first formal assessment of establishment risk for
   Bombus terrestris dalmatinus in the UK. The ability of workers to
   survive winter conditions is seen as the primary barrier to
   establishment, given the year-round colony activity of this sub-species.
   We use standardised cold tolerance indices as outlined by the EU policy
   support action `REBECA' as well as assessing rapid cold hardening (RCH)
   ability. Cold tolerance was comparable to that of the UK-native Bombus
   terrestris audax, including a strong RCH response. Results suggest that
   B. t. dalmatinus could survive mild UK winters in southern areas and
   potentially displace B. t. audax. The implications of ongoing climate

Abstract = {{Nearly 80\% of all pesticides applied to row crops are herbicides, and
   these applications pose potentially significant ecotoxicological risks
   to nontarget plants and associated pollinators. In response to the
   widespread occurrence of weed species resistant to glyphosate,
   biotechnology companies have developed crops resistant to the
   synthetic-auxin herbicides dicamba and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
   (2,4-D); and once commercialized, adoption of these crops is likely to
   change herbicide-use patterns. Despite current limited use, dicamba and
   2,4-D are often responsible for injury to nontarget plants; but effects
   of these herbicides on insect communities are poorly understood. To
   understand the influence of dicamba on pollinators, the authors applied
   several sublethal, drift-level rates of dicamba to alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa L.) and Eupatorium perfoliatum L. and evaluated plant flowering
   and floral visitation by pollinators. The authors found that dicamba
   doses simulating particle drift (approximate to 1\% of the field
   application rate) delayed onset of flowering and reduced the number of
   flowers of each plant species; however, plants that did flower produced
   similar-quality pollen in terms of protein concentrations. Further,
   plants affected by particle drift rates were visited less often by
   pollinators. Because plants exposed to sublethal levels of dicamba may
   produce fewer floral resources and be less frequently visited by
   pollinators, use of dicamba or other synthetic-auxin herbicides with
   widespread planting of herbicide-resistant crops will need to be
   carefully stewarded to prevent potential disturbances of plant and
   beneficial insect communities in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2015 SETAC}},

Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{88-96}},
Abstract = {{Vegetated, green infrastructure, including terraces, balconies, and
   vegetated roofs and walls are increasingly common in urban landscapes,
   elevating habitat into novel contexts above ground. Highly mobile
   species, like bees and wasps, are often seen foraging on green
   infrastructure, but whether nesting opportunities are facilitated is not
   known. Cavity-nesting bees and wasps that provision brood in human-made
   trap nests were monitored over three years on 29 vegetated and
   non-vegetated roofs in Toronto, Canada. The study identified 27 species
   nesting on rooftops but found that building height was negatively
   correlated with the abundance of brood cells provisioned in trap nests,
   and positively correlated with the number of unfinished nests. A decline
   in green space area within a 600 m radius around each rooftop resulted
   in decreasing species richness and abundance. Although the introduced
   bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius) occupied more sites than any other
   bee or wasp (27.6\%) and was the most abundant species, amounting to
   half (48.9\%) of all brood reared, native bees were 73\% of all bee
   species reared. The most abundant wasp was the native spider-collecting
   Trypoxylon collinum Smith (11.4\%), but the introduced aphid-collecting
   Psenulus pallipes (Panzer) occurred at more sites (24.1\%). For the
   pollination and pest controlling services they provide, bees and wasps
   should be considered in the design of vegetated roofs. Evidence here
   suggests that building height and surrounding green space at ground
   level impact bee and wasp diversity on vegetated roofs. Efforts
   supporting their populations using trap nests should target low- and
   mid-rise buildings (<5 building levels).}},

Abstract = {{Significant efforts are currently undertaken in Europe for estimating
   the size and stability of insect populations, especially the useful
   pollinators. In Croatia, there is a lack of researches on size and
   stability of the population of pollinators not managed by the man.
   Insect pollination benefits to plant reproduction within natural and
   agro-ecosystems, and contributes to conservation of wild flora, as well
   as crop production. Furthermore, wild pollinators are known as
   indicators of the environmental stability. Importance of honey bee is
   high in the intensive agricultural areas, where wild pollinators are
   suppressed due to shortage of food sources and nesting spaces. In the
   research, we used pan-traps to estimate pollinator diversity in three
   different habitats in eastern Croatia: Nature Park `Kopacki Rit' as
   natural and undisturbed habitat, countryside near the Park as
   semi-natural habitat, and agricultural habitat under intensive crop
   production. In July 2015, different colour pan traps were exposed at
   each habitat during one-day period for capturing pollinating insects.
   Highest richness, diversity and evenness values are recorded at
   semi-natural habitat, while lowest values are recorded in agricultural
   habitat. For maintaining sustainable agriculture it is recommended to
   conserve some natural habitats for wild pollinators in the intensive
   agricultural areas.}},

Title = {{Distribution, biology and habitat of the rare European osmiine bee
   species Osmia (Melanosmia) pilicornis (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae,
   Osmiini)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Abstract = {{Osmia pilicornis is distributed from western temperate Europe to western
   Siberia, where it exclusively occurs in open-structured, mesophilous and
   mainly deciduous woodland below 1000 m a.s.l. In Central Europe, its
   peak activity ranges from the last third of March to the first third of
   June. Due to its rarity and its low population densities over most of
   its range, the biology of O. pilicornis was only fragmentarily known.
   The discovery of six nests in the course of the present study revealed
   that females of O. pilicornis have a unique nesting behaviour among the
   osmiine bees: they gnaw their nests in dead wood with the aid of their
   strong mandibles, which have a peculiar chisel-like shape hypothesized
   to be an adaptation to the species' specialized nesting behaviour. All
   six nests were in dead fallen branches of different tree and shrub
   species and of varying wood hardness. The nesting branches had a
   diameter of 1.5-6.1 cm, lay on sun-exposed ground and were largely
   hidden under vegetation. The nests contained one to three linearly
   arranged brood cells. Both cell partitions and nest plug were built from
   chewed leaves harvested from Fragaria vesca. Osmia pilicornis was
   identified as a new host of the chrysidid wasp Chrysura hirsuta, and the
   ichneumonid wasp Hoplocryptus confector developed in its nests.
   Microscopical analysis of scopal pollen loads of collected females
   revealed that pollen is mainly collected from three plant taxa, i.e.
   Pulmonaria (Boraginaceae), Fabaceae (e.g. Lathyrus, Vicia) and Lamiaceae
   (e.g. Ajuga, Glechoma). On flowers of Pulmonaria, which is the most
   important pollen host over most of the species' range, the females use
   specialized bristles on their proboscis to brush pollen out of the
   narrow corolla tube, they almost exclusively exploit pollen-rich flowers
   in the early red stage and they often steal pollen from still closed
   flowers by forcefully opening buds. On their search for females, males
   of O. pilicornis patrol flowers of Pulmonaria in a rapid flight
   regularly interrupted by short resting periods on the ground. Females
   are grasped for copulation both during flower visits and in flight
   between the flowers. The wide spectrum of semi-open mesophilous woodland
   types colonized by O. pilicornis suggests that dead fallen branches and
   a rich spring flora in combination with a rather warm but not xeric
   microclimate are the only requisites needed by the species. As the great
   majority of woodland habitats currently occupied by O. pilicornis in
   Central Europe owe their origin to human forest use, the recent decline
   of O. pilicornis in many regions of Europe may have been caused by
   changes in woodland management practices leading to closed and dark
   forests not suitable as habitats for this specialized bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are highly valued for their pollination services in natural
   ecosystems as well as for agricultural crops. These precious pollinators
   are known to be declining worldwide, and one major factor contributing
   to this decline are infections by parasites.
   Knowledge about parasites in wild bumblebee populations is thus of
   paramount importance for conservation purposes. We here report the
   geographical distribution of Crithidia and Nosema, two common parasites
   of bumblebees, in a yet poorly investigated country: Mexico.
   Based on sequence divergence of the Cytochrome b and Glycosomal
   glyceraldehyde phosphate deshydrogenase (gGPDAH) genes, we discovered
   the presence of a new Crithidia species, which is mainly distributed in
   the southern half of the country. It is placed by Bayesian inference as
   a sister species to C. bombi. We suggest the name Crithidia mexicana for
   this newly discovered organism.
   A population of C expoeki was encountered concentrated on the flanks of
   the dormant volcanic mountain, Iztaccihuatl, and microsatellite data
   showed evidence of a bottleneck in this population.
   This study is the first to provide a large-scale insight into the health
   status of endemic bumblebees in Mexico, based on a large sample size (n
   = 3,285 bees examined) over a variety of host species and habitats. (C)

Abstract = {{The number of bumblebee species found in Iceland has doubled from three
   to six in 35 years. This paper considers the colonisation of Iceland by
   bumblebees; updates information on Bombus (Pyrobombus) jonellus (Kirby),
   B. (Megabombus) hortorum (L.) and B. (Bombus) lucorum (L.); presents
   findings for two new colonists, B. (Pyrobombus) hypnorum (L.) and B.
   (Thoracobombus) pascuorum (Scopoli); and considers the arrival of
   another species, B. (Pyrobombus) pratorum (L.), that may have become
   established. The context of bumblebee dispersal to remote islands is
   considered. Many of the restricted number of insect species that have
   colonised North Atlantic islands have done so in association with man.
   B. (Bombus) terrestris (L.) has been used as a pollinator in glasshouses
   in Iceland since 1994, and it may also have become naturalised.
   Barcoding is needed to check the identity of some specimens. B. jonellus
   has probably been present for at least several hundred years; genetic
   studies should help determine whether the timescale for its arrival is
   compatible with an anthropogenic origin. It is suggested that
   consideration is given to ways of reducing both unintended introduction
   of bumblebee species with cargo, and the release and disease risk of
   those imported intentionally for commercial use.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic pollination is critical for tropical ecosystem functioning, and
   nectar plays an essential role as it represents the main trophic
   resource for pollinators. Nevertheless, little is known about the
   mechanisms that underlie its production, which is essential for
   understanding the basis of nectar-mediated interactions in ecological
   and evolutionary approaches. Therefore, this study explores the
   relationship between the nectar secretion pattern and nectary functional
   changes in Anemopaegma album, a bee-pollinated species. We analysed the
   pattern of nectar production under field conditions and investigated
   floral nectary structural changes in two different developmental stages
   using light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We measured
   30.95 +/- 23.02 mu l (mean +/- SD, n = 30) of nectar accumulated inside
   the nectar chamber (29.26 +/- 3.48\% sucrose equivalents) at the moment
   of flower opening. Nectar removal did not influence the pattern of
   floral nectar production in terms of volume or total sugar but reduced
   the concentration of the nectar produced during the first 24 h of
   anthesis. The nectary consisted of an epidermis, a nectary parenchyma
   and a subnectary parenchyma supplied only by phloem. Starch grains
   decreased in size and abundance from the subnectary parenchyma toward
   the epidermis. We observed the degradation of starch grains and
   incorporation of amyloplasts into vacuoles at the pre-anthesis stage as
   well as the transformation of amyloplasts into elaioplasts during
   anthesis. Nectar secretion was continuous during the A. album flower
   life span, which was related to the functional features of its floral
   nectary, especially the presence of starch stored in the parenchyma.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many cactus species produce `bird' flowers; however, the reproductive
   biology of the majority of these species has not been studied. Here, we
   report on a study of the pollination of two species from the
   Cleistocactus genus, cited as an ornithophilous genus, in the context of
   the different ways in which they are specialised to bird pollination. In
   addition, we re-evaluate the level of specialisation of previous studies
   of cacti with bird pollination and evaluate how common phenotypic
   specialisation to birds is in this family. Both Cleistocactus species
   exhibited ornithophilous floral traits. Cleistocactus baumannii was
   pollinated by hummingbirds, whereas Cleistocactus smaragdiflorus was
   pollinated by hummingbirds and bees. Pollination by birds has been
   recorded in 27 cactus species, many of which exhibit ornithophilous
   traits; however, they show generalised pollination systems with bees,
   bats or moths in addition to birds being their floral visitors. Of all
   cactus species, 27\% have reddish flowers. This trait is associated with
   diurnal anthesis and a tubular shape. Phenotypic specialisation to bird
   pollination is recognised in many cactus species; however, it is not
   predictive of functional and ecological specialisation in this family.}},

Volume = {{150}},

Abstract = {{Oxalis pes-caprae is a tristylous South African geophyte that is
   invasive in regions with Mediterranean climate. Given the introduction
   of the short-styled morph only, vegetative reproduction was, until
   recently, the reproductive mode known for this invaded area. The
   detection of new floral morphs, fruit and seed production in natural
   populations of the invaded range, together with the reported weakening
   in the heteromorphic incompatibility system, raised the question on
   whether the short-styled flowers are able to exchange pollen among
   themselves, and if so, which mechanisms account for it. Thus, flower
   morphometric analysis and field experiments were conducted to assess
   pollinator visitation rates and pollen flow in three invasive
   populations. Flower morphological changes suggesting the evolution from
   tristyly towards semi-homostyly were observed. Moreover, O. pes-caprae
   flowers were visited by different functional groups of pollinators,
   mostly hymenopteran. Dye flow experiments revealed that the short-styled
   flowers were able to successfully exchange pollen among themselves in
   natural conditions. All of this, together with the weakening of the
   incompatibility system, constitutes further data that might help to
   explain the recently reported occurrence of sexual reproduction in this
   invaded range, which by itself bears important implications for the
   invasion process of O. pes-caprae.}},

Abstract = {{Clustering is a popular data analysis and data mining technique. The
   k-means clustering algorithm is one of the most commonly used methods.
   However, it highly depends on the initial solution and is easy to trap
   into the local optimal. For overcoming these disadvantages of the
   k-means method, Flower Pollination Algorithm with Bee Pollinator is
   proposed. Discard pollen operator and crossover operator are applied to
   increase diversity of the population, and local searching ability is
   enhanced by using elite based mutation operator. Ten data sets are
   selected to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm. Compared
   with DE, CS, ABC, PSO, FPA and k-Means, the experiment results show that
   Flower Pollination Algorithm with Bee Pollinator has not only higher
   accuracy but also higher level of stability. And the faster convergence
   speed can also be validated by statistical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cucurbits are monoecious in general; the female flowers occur lower than
   the male flowers in fields. Often farmers are not aware of this type of
   sex expression, and are concerned about the low fruit set despite
   `profuse' flowering and abundant pollinators in the crop fields. We
   assessed flower sex expression during the peak (female) flowering and
   fruiting period in three widely grown cucurbit crops, Cucurbita maxima,
   Benincasa hispida and Momordica charantia in a village ecosystem of
   northern Kerala. Sex expression was male-biased in two species. In M.
   charantia, 97.65\% of the flowers produced were staminate. In this
   condition, the farmers should ensure that effective pollinators are
   available in plenty to achieve maximum fruit set from the low number of
   pistillate flowers. C. maxima produced an average of 75.39\% of
   staminate flowers, which varied across the fields; three fields
   consistently produced 100\% pistillate flowers in all the 14 days of
   observations. The fruit set in fields with only pistillate flowers is
   likely to be affected by pollen limitation, rather than pollinator
   limitation. These fields may require supplementary manual pollination to
   enhance the fruit set. B. hispida produced more or less equal proportion
   of staminate and pistillate flowers across the fields and days studied.
   This kind of information may help the farmers to manage pollination
   services in their fields as well as to predict a realistic yield.}},

Title = {{Following the dance: Ground survey of flowers and flower-visiting
   insects in a summer foraging hotspot identified via honey bee waggle
   dance decoding}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{213}},
Pages = {{265-271}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Decoding of honey bee waggle dances has previously shown that average
   foraging distances are longest during July and August in Sussex, United
   Kingdom, indicating a scarcity of summer floral resources. However, it
   also identified a summer foraging `hotspot' in agricultural land at 2-3
   km distance. Unfortunately, dance decoding does not yield precise
   foraging locations or information on the flower species visited.
   Therefore, we surveyed this hotspot during July and August 2012 and 2013
   in order to identify the habitats and flower species used by honey bees
   and other flower-visiting insects (EVI).
   The hotspot area consisted predominantly of four habitat types
   potentially attractive to EV!: pasture fields, field margins/hedgerows
   of arable fields, set-aside and a National Nature Reserve. We surveyed
   three fields within each habitat type. The abundance of flowers was
   found to be a key determent of EVI abundance per field (p = 0.002).
   Field margins/hedgerows were the most flower abundant habitat type (p =
   0.002) and had more than twice (235\%) the FVI abundance (p = 0.001) and
   species richness (p = 0.035) per unit area than did pasture fields.
   Areas with long grass had greater flower abundance (p <0.001) and FVI
   species richness (p = 0.009) than those with short grass (<30 cm). The
   five plants on which we recorded the greatest number of EVI were species
   considered to be agricultural weeds.
   Honey bees represented 19\% of all EVI, showing that dance decoding had
   located a hotspot that was an important foraging location not just for
   honey bees but also for other types of EVI. Honey bee abundance, per
   transect, was strongly correlated with that of other FVI (p = 0.001),
   particularly bumble bees (p <0.001). However, Mil groups were not found
   uniformly across our study site and honey bee abundance was only weakly
   linked to overall species richness (p = 0.069). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Recent concern over global pollinator declines has led to considerable
   research on the effects of pesticides on bees(1-5). Although pesticides
   are typically not encountered at lethal levels in the field, there is
   growing evidence indicating that exposure to field-realistic levels can
   have sublethal effects on bees, affecting their foraging
   behaviour(1,6,7), homing ability(8,9) and reproductive success(2,5).
   Bees are essential for the pollination of a wide variety of crops and
   the majority of wild flowering plants(10-12), but until now research on
   pesticide effects has been limited to direct effects on bees themselves
   and not on the pollination services they provide. Here we show the first
   evidence to our knowledge that pesticide exposure can reduce the
   pollination services bumblebees deliver to apples, a crop of global
   economic importance. Bumblebee colonies exposed to a neonicotinoid
   pesticide provided lower visitation rates to apple trees and collected
   pollen less often. Most importantly, these pesticide-exposed colonies
   produced apples containing fewer seeds, demonstrating a reduced delivery
   of pollination services. Our results also indicate that reduced
   pollination service delivery is not due to pesticide-induced changes in
   individual bee behaviour, but most likely due to effects at the colony
   level. These findings show that pesticide exposure can impair the
   ability of bees to provide pollination services, with important
   implications for both the sustained delivery of stable crop yields and
   the functioning of natural ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{145-154}},

Abstract = {{Bees and other insects provide pollination services that are key to
   determining the fruit set on coffee plantations. These pollination
   services are influenced by local ecology as well as human factors, both
   social and economic. To better understand these different factors, we
   assessed their effect on pollinators and coffee pollination services in
   Santander, Colombia. We quantified the effect of key ecological drivers
   on pollinator community composition, such as the method of farm
   management (either conventional or organic) and the surrounding
   landscape composition, specifically the proximity to forest.
   We found that ambient levels of pollination services provided by the
   local pollinator fauna (open pollination) accounted for a 10.5 +/- 2.0\%
   increase in final coffee fruit set, and that the various pollinators are
   affected differently by the differing factors. For example, our findings
   indicate that conventional farm management, using synthetic inputs, can
   promote pollinators, especially if they are in close proximity to
   natural forest fragments. This is particularly true for stingless bees.
   Honeybee visitation to coffee is also positively influenced by the
   conventional management of farms. Factors associated with greater
   numbers of stingless bees on farms include greater shade cover, lower
   tree densities, smaller numbers and types of trees in bloom, and younger
   coffee plantations. A forested landscape close to farms appears to
   enhance these factors, giving increased stability and resilience to the
   pollinating bees and insects. However we found that organic farms also
   support diverse pollinator communities, even if distant from forest
   fragments.
   The contribution of honeybees to pollination value (US\$129.6/ha of
   coffee) is greater than that of stingless bees (US\$16.5/ha of coffee).
   Since the method of farm management has a major impact on the numbers
   and types of pollinators attracted to farms, we have analysed the
   statistically significant social factors that influence farmers'
   decisions on whether to adopt organic or conventional practices. These
   include the availability of technology, the type of landowner (whether
   married couples or individual owners), the number of years of farmers'
   formal education, the role of institutions, membership of community
   organizations, farm size, coffee productivity and the number of coffee
   plots per farm. It is hoped that the use of our holistic approach, which
   combines investigation of the social as well as the ecological drivers
   of pollination, will help provide evidence to underpin the development
   of best practices for integrating the management of pollination into
   sustainable agricultural practices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{185-194}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of how spatial variation across landscapes
   regulates local abundances and species richness also needs to consider
   possible temporal changes in such relationships. In many tropical areas,
   the contrast between dry and rainy season is pronounced and the types
   and distributions of the main floral resources differ (herbs vs trees).
   This shift in resources could result in different pollinator abundances,
   species richness and trait compositions between seasons, as well as in
   how these components are spatially distributed. We compared the bee
   species composition between dry and rainy season in an agricultural
   mosaic landscape in southwestern Ethiopia, and analyzed it in relation
   to forest cover. We sampled bees for 67 days in the dry season and 86
   days in the rainy season with pan and vane traps in 28 homegardens
   covering a gradient from low to high tree cover in the surrounding area.
   We found a clear shift in species composition between seasons, with more
   small bee species and more below-ground nesting bees in the rainy season
   compared to the dry season. The distribution of height at which the bees
   were foraging shifted between seasons with a higher proportion of the
   bees foraging at tree level in the dry season. Bee abundance and
   richness were generally positively affected by higher forest cover
   surrounding the homegardens, but there were no clear interaction effects
   between seasons, in contrast to our hypothesis. The clear turnover in
   species composition between seasons and the positive effect of forest
   cover show that mechanisms acting both at spatial and temporal scales
   are important in regulating local bee communities. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Title = {{Riparian buffer strips: Their role in the conservation of insect
   pollinators in intensive grassland systems}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{207-220}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{There is growing concern that the global decline of insect pollinators
   will adversely influence the stability of pollination in agricultural
   and terrestrial ecosystems. By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and
   ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to
   promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect
   pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of
   riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the
   main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity.
   Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had
   richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland
   fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or
   diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even
   and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of
   butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and
   butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5 m wide)
   than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. <= 3.5 m wide)
   and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more
   diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral
   resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and
   butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the
   flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width
   could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of
   flowers.
   Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5 m wide, have the
   potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively
   grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a
   more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses
   (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for
   bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In
   grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than
   mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not
   unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian
   buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of
   watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification
   of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should
   therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as
   ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Successful conservation of pollination services depends upon an
   understanding of the processes that influence pollinator diversity
   within the landscape, as well as the relationship between pollinator
   community composition and the provision of services. In this study, the
   influence of landscape simplification on the composition of pollinator
   communities and the provisioning of pollination services to cultivated
   strawberry was evaluated (Fragaria x ananassa). Additionally the
   relative pollination efficiency for the five most common bee genera
   visiting strawberry flowers was measured. Pollinators were collected
   during bloom with pan traps on 14 commercial farms all growing the same
   strawberry variety in the Finger Lakes Region, NY, USA. The farms were
   chosen to represent a gradient in the proportion of agricultural land
   uses in the surrounding landscape from 0.09 to 0.60. Landscapes with
   greater proportions of agricultural area had lower pollinator abundances
   and species richness. While yield was positively correlated with
   pollinator abundance, species richness had little effect on the level of
   pollination services. This conclusion was supported by the finding that
   visitor identity did not explain pollination efficiency in strawberry.
   Our results show that a high proportion of agricultural land in the
   landscape negatively impacts wild pollinators and pollination services
   to strawberry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When pollinators use flower color to locate food sources, a distinct
   color can serve as a reproductive barrier against co-flowering species.
   This anti-interference function of flower color may result in a
   community assembly of plant species displaying mutually different flower
   colors. However, such color dispersion is not ubiquitous, suggesting a
   variable selection across communities and existence of some opposing
   factors. We conducted a 30-week study in a plant community and measured
   the floral reflectances of 244 species. The reflectances were evaluated
   in insect color spaces (bees, swallowtails, and flies), and the
   dispersion was compared with random expectations. We found that
   co-existing colors were overdispersed for each analyzed pollinator type,
   and this overdispersion was statistically significant for bees.
   Furthermore, we showed that exclusion of 32 aliens from the analysis
   significantly increased the color dispersion of native flowers in every
   color space. This result indicated that aliens disturbed a native
   plant-pollinator network via similarly colored flowers. Our results
   demonstrate the masking effects of aliens in the detection of color
   dispersion of native flowers and that variations in pollinator vision
   yield different outcomes. Our results also support the hypothesis that
   co-flowering species are one of the drivers of color diversification and
   affect the community assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Iconic examples of insect pollination have emphasized narrowly
   specialized pollinator mutualisms such as figs and fig wasps {[}1] and
   yuccas and yucca moths {[}2]. However, recent attention by pollination
   ecologists has focused on the broad spectra of pollinated plants by
   generalist pollinators such as bees. Bees have great impact for
   formulating hypotheses regarding specialization versus generalization in
   pollination mutualisms {[}3, 4]. We report the pollination biology of
   six northern European species of an extinct tribe of
   pollen-basket-bearing apine bees, Electrapini, of early-middle Eocene
   age, examined from two deposits of 48 and 44 million years in age {[}5].
   These bees exhibit a pattern of generalized, incidental pollen occurring
   randomly on their heads, thoraces, and abdomens, obtained from diverse,
   nectar-bearing plants. By contrast, a more restricted suite of pollen
   was acquired for metatibial pollen baskets (corbiculae) of the same bee
   taxa from a taxonomically much narrower suite of arborescent, evergreen
   hosts with uniform flower structure. The stereotyped plant sources of
   the specialist strategy of pollen collection consisted of pentamerous,
   radially symmetrical flowers with a conspicuous gynoecium surrounded by
   prominent nectar reward, organized in structurally similar compound
   inflorescences. Pollen specialization in bees occurs not for efficient
   pollination but rather in the corbiculate Electrapini as food for bee
   larvae (brood) and involves packing corbiculae with moistened pollen
   that rapidly loses viability with age. This specialist strategy was a
   well-developed preference by the early Eocene, providing a
   geochronologic midpoint assessment of bee pollen-collection strategies.}},

Title = {{A New Secondary Pollen Presentation Mechanism from a Wild Ginger
   (Zingiber densissimum) and Its Functional Roles in Pollination Process}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims
   Secondary pollen presentation (SPP), a floral mechanism of reproductive
   adaptation, has been described for more than 200 years, with nine types
   SPP recorded. However, few studies have been done experimentally to link
   the floral mechanism of SPP to its functional roles in pollination
   process. This study aims to describe a new SPP mechanism from a wild
   ginger (Zingiber densissimum, Zingiberaceae) and explore how the pollen
   arrangement of SPP affects pollen removal during the interaction with
   different pollinators.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   Field observations and experiments revealed that flowers lasted for less
   than one day. The breeding system was partially self-incompatible. Two
   bee species, Macropis hedini (which carried pollen dorsally) and
   Amegilla zonata (which carried pollen ventrally) were the primary
   pollinators. About a third of pollen grains were relocated from the
   anther to the labellum staminode of flowers through the adherence of
   aggregated pollen chains, while other grains were presented on the
   anther. In a single visit, each bee species removed pollen grains from
   both the labellum staminode and the anther. Macropis hedini was more
   effective than Amegilla zonata.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Our study describes a new SPP mechanism in angiosperms. The new SPP mode
   enables pollen grains presented on the anther and the labellum staminode
   simultaneously via the adherence of aggregated pollen chains, thus
   promoting pollen to be taken away by different pollinators. This SPP
   mechanism plays a key role during pollen removal and may have evolved
   under the pressure to improve male fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Vacciniztm meridionale is a wild plant producing edible fruits in the
   mountain areas of Northern South America. However, the fruits of this
   species has been under an unsustainable extraction and there is a
   growing interest of establishing this species as a crop; nevertheless,
   the information about its breeding system is scarce, which is essential
   for its sustainable management and conservation. This research aimed to
   study the floral and reproductive biology of V. meridionale in natural
   conditions, and to analyze the importance of pollinators on its
   reproduction, in two wild populations of V meridionale in the states of
   Cundinamarca and Boyaca, in the Oriental Cordillera of Colombia. For
   this, we have made different observations and experiments to describe
   its flower morphology, floral phenology, pollen viability, stigma
   receptivity, pollen-ovule ratio and nectar production. To study its
   reproductive system, we performed experiments of flower emasculation,
   pollinator exclusion and hand pollination (self-and cross-pollination).
   We found that although the flowers have poricidal anthers, the release
   of pollen could occur easily without vibration. V meridionale shows a
   large floral display, long floral longevity and has female-biased nectar
   production. The pollen-ovule ratio was of 571 133, which classified the
   species as facultative xenogamy. This result agreed with the pollination
   experiments because the plants produced fruits by agamospermy, selfing
   and outcrossing. However, we registered a strong inbreeding depression,
   observed in high rates of fruit abortions, after self-pollination.
   Unlike of self-pollinating fruits, the plant retains those produced by
   cross-pollination since its formation. The floral traits showed by this
   species are mechanisms to favor a more diverse guild of floral visitors
   than only insects able to buzz-pollination. In addition, these floral
   traits may enhance the pollination probability, and reduce geitonogamy.
   Moreover, the inbreeding depression suggests that V meridionale promotes
   outcrossing as its main reproductive strategy. Therefore, pollinators,
   particularly bees, are essential for this species reproduction and
   conservation, and are critical in the maintenance of its genetic
   variability and fruits production.}},

   locations in a flower patch, bringing them close enough to individual

Abstract = {{Many varieties of sweet cherry are self-incompatible. Therefore, sweet

   used to collect bee samples. Sampling collections were repeated for
   three years; from 2007 to 2009, between April and May. The traps were
   set in the bud-swell period and lifted in the green-fruit period.
   Climatic data were taken from meteorology stations near the orchards.
   Vegetation in the surrounding areas was also inspected. The composition
   of pollinator bee species was determined and compared between orchards.
   In total, 83 bee species and 38 plant species were recorded. It was
   found that Halictidae is the most abundant and richest group among the
   pollinator bees. The effects of the quantity of the Malaise traps on bee
   sampling success were also tested. It was found that one trap per 325
   trees is enough for an adequate sampling. Apart from the annual
   fluctuations of bee richness in the orchards, general differences in the
   bee diversity among orchards might be affected by the surrounding
   vegetation and especially from different agricultural practices such as
   tilling the ground.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we assessed, under laboratory conditions, the toxicity of
   an active substance on solitary bee larvae of Osmia cornuta
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae). A field-realistic dose of the systemic
   insecticide spirotetramat was applied to the mass provisions. The
   insecticide's effects on several life-cycle parameters were studied in
   males and females. Our results showed a significantly shorter
   post-emergence longevity in bees exposed to spirotetramat during the
   larval stage, compared to the control. The observed reduction in
   longevity was 18 and 15\%, respectively, in males and females. Mortality
   rate and other biological traits (larval and spinning duration,
   emergence time, food/body conversion rate) did not show significant
   differences between the two treatments. The method described in this
   study can be used to test the effects of toxic substances (i.e.
   agrochemicals) on bees. Moreover, it can constitute a basis for the
   development of a standardised protocol in the first tier of the
   Environmental Risk Assessment for solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{Properly arranged ornamental gardens in both urban and agricultural
   landscapes can be of a benefit to bees. In this study, we observed the
   flowering phenology, nectar, and pollen production of the ornamental
   Hosta species and varieties (H. sieboldiana Engler, H. capitata Nakai,
   H. crispula Maekawa, H. fluctuans Maekawa, syn. H. sieboldiana var.
   fluctuans hort., H. undulata var. univittata Miquel (Hylander), syn. H.
   univittata). Our experiment was conducted in the 2012 - 2014 time
   period, at the UMCS Botanical Garden in Lublin, Poland (51 degrees 14'
   N, 21 degrees 34' E). The total sugar yield varied almost 5-fold among
   Hosta ornamentals; the lowest amount was calculated for H. fluctuans
   (2.31 g per 10 m(2)) and the highest for H. capitata (11.80 g per 10
   m(2)). The average pollen yield was from 0.24 g per 10 m(2) (H. undulata
   var. univittata) to 9.53 g per 10 m(2) (H. capitata). Pollen grains were
   bilaterally symmetrical, and large-sized. In polar view, they were
   prolatum (shape index 1.33 - 1.61), while in equatorial view, oblatum
   (shape index 0.5 - 0.7). Hosta species can complete the summer pasture
   mainly for bumblebees. In four of the five Hosta representatives,
   bumblebees accounted for 60 - 70\% of the total visits. The honeybee
   predominated only on the flowers of H. capitata (54 - 71\%). Solitary
   bees were rarely observed (3 - 9\% of visits). The phenotypic traits of
   Hosta flowers (the accumulation of nectar in the deep and narrow
   perianth tube) reduced the access to nectar reward and restricted an
   array of insect visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial vetch (Vicia unijuga) is a wild plant found in parts of East
   Asia and potentially valuable as a forage species for more extreme
   environments. Information on its reproductive system and pollination
   biology is needed for progress in domestication of the species. We
   characterized the reproductive system of perennial vetch as facultative
   xenogamy (i.e. it is largely cross-pollinated by insects but is also
   self-compatible and can selfpollinate). There was no significant
   difference (P > 0.05) in the fruit set ratio between insect
   cross-pollination and artificial cross-pollination at the seed
   maturation stage, but natural self-pollination was inefficient. In our
   study conducted on the Tibetan plateau, eight insect species (especially
   certain bumble bees) are identified as potential pollinators, and four
   other insect species belonging to the Lepidoptera and Diptera visited
   flowers but are unlikely to be pollinators. The flower visitation rate
   of wild bumble bees was 1.6-3.3 times higher than domestic honeybees,
   with Bombus lepidus having the highest visitation rate of 15.7
   florets/min. The diurnal floret opening rhythm of perennial vetch was
   synchronized with diurnal activity of potential pollinators. Optimal
   pollination of perennial vetch would likely be achieved using wild bees,
   as they have behaviour characteristics and flower tripping ability
   necessary, and are present in sufficient numbers to be efficient
   pollinators of this crop. However, even with sufficiency of pollination,
   there remains a fundamental problem with low fruit set which requires
   further investigation from a plant biology perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are key insects in the tropics, both as pollinators of
   crops and as contributors to the maintenance of floral diversity through
   pollination of wild plants. This study investigated the nesting ecology
   and threats to three stingless bee species: Meliponula bocandei
   (Spinola), Meliponula ferruginea (Lepeletier) and Dactylurina
   staudingeri (Gribodo) in three landscapes characterized as forest with
   logging and wild honey hunting; farmlands that experience annual wild
   fires and a national park. The study was carried out in July 2011 and
   February 2012. A total of 93 stingless bee nests were found in 48 ha
   (density 1.9 nests per ha), 81\% in tree cavities and 19\% in deserted
   termite mounds and in the ground. M. ferruginea was the only species
   using deserted termite mounds (seventeen nests) and in the ground (1
   nest). Although tree size (diameter at breast height, DBH >15 cm) and
   density of large tree were important for nest site selection, there was
   no influence of tree species. M. bocandei may be restricted in choice of
   nest site in farmland areas by the absence of trees. Reduced
   availability of trees in agricultural landscape together with bush
   burning and wild honey collecting is the main threats to stingless bees
   survival and abundance which need to be addressed for their successful
   conservation in Ghana.}},

Abstract = {{The bee species Melipona scutellaris Latreille, 1811 (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae) is native to Brazil and, stingless. In Brazil, stingless bees
   are responsible for 40\% to 90\% of tree species pollination, depending
   on the considered ecosystem. However, their survival has been threatened
   since the country has been standing out as a big consumer of pesticides.
   Many of the pesticides used are considered toxic to bees, including
   imidacloprid. Although the bees are not the target of these substances,
   they are highly vulnerable to contamination. Thereby, the objective of
   this study was to establish the mean lethal dose (LD50) and the mean
   lethal concentration (LC50) of imidacloprid for the M. scutellaris. In
   order to carry out this experiment, bees were collected and the test was
   performed according to OECD's protocol (1998a, 1998b), developed for A.
   mellifera. For the determination of LD50 and LC50, data was analyzed
   through the Probit method. The topical LD50 established in this study
   was 2.41 ng/ bee for 24 hours and 1.29 ng/bee for 48 hours. The oral
   LC50 was 2.01 ng i.a./mu L for 24 hours and 0.81 ng i.a./mu L for 48
   hours. Thus, it is important to establish management methods which take
   this higher susceptibility into account to protect native species.}},

Abstract = {{Increased ungulate browsing has altered the composition of plant
   communities and food webs of forest ecosystems in many regions around
   the world. To evaluate the cascading impact of deer browsing on
   pollination and plant reproduction is critical to understand the roles
   of species interactions in maintaining plant populations and for
   conservation management. In this study, we investigated the
   relationships among floral resources of understory herbaceous plants,
   pollinator visitation, and fruit set of shrub species based on data
   accumulation over three years in six temperate deciduous forests with
   deer and without deer. We found that in deer browsed sites, the
   visitation rate of bumblebees had decreased due to severe reduction in
   the coverage of autumn-flowering herbaceous plants, while the effect
   varied between bumblebee species. On the other hand, other insect taxa
   showed no dependence on variation in autumn floral resources. The two
   genera of bumblebee-pollinated shrubs showed reduced fruit set due to
   severe decline in autumn-flowering herbaceous plants and bumblebee
   visitation (Weigela: -18.5\% and Rhododendron: -21.9\%). In contrast,
   the fruit set of shrubs pollinated by insects that did not show
   dependence on autumn floral resources were not negatively affected by
   deer browsing. Our results suggest that deer browsing have not only
   caused negative effects on herbaceous plants, but in addition have
   negative indirect effects on reproduction of woody plants through
   cascading effects of pollination linkages.}},

Abstract = {{In social insects, the high cost of parental investment has promoted the
   evolution of traits that reduce or avoid care for unrelated offspring.
   They have evolved a sophisticated recognition system which enables them
   to reject foreign individuals, and therefore prevent their nest's
   exploitation by parasites and predators. Nonetheless, many social
   parasites are able to overcome social insect recognition and parasitize
   their parental care behaviour by laying their eggs in host nests.
   Although several studies have already been conducted on the strategies
   used by social parasites to successfully invade host nests, the strategy
   used by its offspring to evade host rejection is still poorly
   understood. In bumblebees, previous investigations indicated that male
   offspring of Bombus vestalis (Geoffroy) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), the
   specific obligate social parasite of Bombus terrestris (L.), may use
   allomones to evade host worker attacks. Following these studies, we
   performed electrophysiological studies and behavioural experiments to
   identify the potential repellents. Six compounds elicited
   electroantennographic responses in host worker antennae. The
   corresponding mixture of synthetic volatiles as well as pure tetradecyl
   acetate, and to a lesser extent pure (Z)-11-hexadecenyl acetate, showed
   a repellent effect on starved host workers in a feeding bioassay. We
   hypothesize that tetradecyl acetate has a key function in the repellent
   effect of the secretions of B. vestalis male offspring towards B.
   terrestris host workers.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated fitness in natural populations of a managed solitary bee
   Osmia ribifloris Cockerell (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) from sites
   separated from 400 to 2,700 km. Parental wild bees originated in central
   Texas (TX), central-northern Utah (UT), and central California (CA).
   They were then intercrossed and raised inside a mesh enclosure in
   southern Mississippi (MS). Females from all possible mated pairs of O.
   ribifloris produced F-1 broods with 30-40\% female cocoons and
   outcrossed progeny were 30\% heavier. Mitochondrial (COI) genomes of the
   four populations revealed three distinct clades, a TX-CA clade, a UT
   clade, and an MS clade, the latter (MS) representing captive progeny of
   CA and UT bees. Although classified as separate subspecies, TX and CA
   populations from 30A degrees N to 38A degrees N latitude shared 98\%
   similarity in COI genomes and the greatest brood biomass per nest straw
   (600- to 700-mg brood). Thus, TX and CA bees show greater adaptation for
   southern U.S. sites. In contrast, UT-sourced bees were more distantly
   related to TX and CA bees and also produced similar to 50\% fewer brood.
   These results, taken together, confirm that adult O. ribifloris from all
   trap-nest sites are genetically compatible, but some phenotypic
   variation exists that could affect this species performance as a
   commercial blueberry pollinator. Males, their sperm, or perhaps a
   substance in their sperm helped stabilize our captive bee population by
   promoting legitimate nesting over nest usurpation. Otherwise, without
   insemination, 50\% fewer females nested (they nested 14 d late) and 20\%
   usurped nests, killing 33-67\% of brood in affected nests.}},

Abstract = {{Global trends in pollinator-dependent crops have raised awareness of the
   need to support managed and wild bee populations to ensure sustainable
   crop production. Provision of sufficient forage resources is a key
   element for promoting bee populations within human impacted landscapes,
   particularly those in agricultural lands where demand for pollination
   service is high and land use and management practices have reduced
   available flowering resources. Recent government incentives in North
   America and Europe support the planting of wildflowers to benefit
   pollinators; surprisingly, in North America there has been almost no
   rigorous testing of the performance of wildflower mixes, or their
   ability to support wild bee abundance and diversity. We tested different
   wildflower mixes in a spatially replicated, multiyear study in three
   regions of North America where production of pollinator-dependent crops
   is high: Florida, Michigan, and California. In each region, we
   quantified flowering among wildflower mixes composed of annual and
   perennial species, and with high and low relative diversity. We measured
   the abundance and species richness of wild bees, honey bees, and syrphid
   flies at each mix over two seasons. In each region, some but not all
   wildflower mixes provided significantly greater floral display area than
   unmanaged weedy control plots. Mixes also attracted greater abundance
   and richness of wild bees, although the identity of best mixes varied
   among regions. By partitioning floral display size from mix identity we
   show the importance of display size for attracting abundant and diverse
   wild bees. Season-long monitoring also revealed that designing mixes to
   provide continuous bloom throughout the growing season is critical to
   supporting the greatest pollinator species richness. Contrary to
   expectation, perennials bloomed in their first season, and
   complementarity in attraction of pollinators among annuals and
   perennials suggests that inclusion of functionally diverse species may
   provide the greatest benefit. Wildflower mixes may be particularly
   important for providing resources for some taxa, such as bumble bees,
   which are known to be in decline in several regions of North America. No
   mix consistently attained the full diversity that was planted. Further
   study is needed on how to achieve the desired floral display and
   diversity from seed mixes.}},

   for the pollination precision hypothesis}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The evolutionary shift from radial to bilateral
   symmetry in flowers is generally associated with the evolution of low
   flower-size variation. This phenomenon supports the hypothesis that the
   lower size variation in bilateral flowers can be attributed to low
   pollinator diversity. In this study, we propose two other hypotheses to
   explain low flower-size variation in bilateral symmetrical flowers. To
   test the three hypotheses, we examined the relative importance of
   pollinator diversity, composition, and bilateral symmetry itself as
   selective forces on low flower-size variation.
   METHODS: We examined pollinator diversity and composition and
   flower-size variation for 36 species in a seminatural ecosystem with
   high bee richness and frequent lepidopteran visitation.
   KEY RESULTS: Bilateral flowers were more frequently visited than radial
   flowers by larger bees, but functional-group diversity of the
   pollinators did not differ between symmetry types. Although bilateral
   flowers had significantly lower flower-size variation than radial
   flowers, flower-size variation did not vary with pollinator diversity
   and composition but was instead related to bilateral symmetry.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the lower size variation in
   bilateral flowers might have evolved under selection favoring the
   control of pollinator behavior on flowers to enhance the accurate
   placement of pollen on the body of the pollinator, independent of
   pollinator type. Because of the limited research on this issue, future
   work should be conducted in various types of plant-pollinator
   communities worldwide to further clarify the issue.}},

Abstract = {{Studies performed using interaction networks have helped in the
   understanding of mutualistic relationships, allowing for the
   representation of complex community structure. Conservation of the

   history and is a complementary tool in studying interactions between
   bees and flowers. This research had as its aim the mapping of
   interactions between Eugenia uniflora flowers and floral visitor bees
   and with palynological studies also know the other plants that interact
   to form the network. Twenty-nine bee species were found with pollen load
   and 20 pollen types, and E. uniflora was the only plant that interacted
   with all bee species. Studied networks are nested, revealing stability
   for the community of bees and plants. E. uniflora flowers are an
   important source of resources to visiting bees, and this plant native to
   the Atlantic Forest is contributing to the stability of biodiversity of
   the bees in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has resulted in large-scale loss of bee
   pollinators, but while some species have been negatively affected others
   seem to endure changed conditions. It has been suggested that certain
   morphological, ecological and life-history traits make some species more
   vulnerable to landscape changes. Information on which traits make
   species vulnerable and why may aid conservation of declining species. We
   performed a comprehensive analysis of how multiple traits related to
   diet breadth, movement and nesting habits moderate vulnerability of
   bumble bees to landscape simplification. We surveyed bumble bees in
   flower-rich non-crop habitats in either complex landscapes (with small
   crop fields bordered by non-crop habitats), or simple landscapes (with
   larger fields and therefore less non-crop habitats). We analysed if
   landscape type interacted with colony size, queen emergence date, colony
   life-cycle length, nesting habitat, thorax width, proboscis length or
   variability in thorax and proboscis, to explain bumble bee abundances.
   Workers and males of species with above-ground nests, small sized
   colonies and long colony cycle were relatively less abundant in simple
   compared to in complex landscapes. Simple landscapes hosted fewer males
   of late emerging species and species with highly variable proboscis
   length. This suggests that both nesting habitat and spatio-temporal
   availability of food resources act as ecological filters for bumble
   bees. Colony size correlated with nesting habitat and queen emergence
   when correcting for phylogenetic correlations, suggesting that landscape
   simplification acts through effects on combinations of traits. Our
   results have consequences for conservation by suggesting that declining
   bumble bee species can be supported by providing adequate nesting
   habitats and preferred plant species throughout the season and within
   short distance from nesting habitats, to allow utilisation also by
   species having colonies with few workers.}},

Abstract = {{The post congress excursion of the IHC in Brisbane provided insights
   into the pome fruit industry in the granite belt. The combination of the
   granite hills with sufficient winter chilling and summer rain provides
   an unusual temperate zone microclimate despite the subtropical 28A
   degrees S latitude, which enables the earliest apple harvest in
   Australia. The major apple cvs `Gala', `Granny Smith' and `Pink Lady' on
   M26 yield at least 80 t/ha on average in pedestrian orchards, which
   waive the need for platforms. Alternate bearing is not a problem. Hail
   nets are widespread (90 \%), the netting often originates from New
   Zealand, the posts from `gum trees' (hardwood Eucalyptus) in local
   clearings in dry sclerophyll forests; honey bees are used to pollinate
   the apple trees. The legal minimum wage of a,not sign 14/h is often
   exceeded; farm workers are backpackers visiting mostly from Europe
   including Germany, who earn their travel money. Local farm workers are
   difficult to recruit in an environment of low redundancy rate.
   Sustainability and carbon footprint score high in such a prosperous
   environment. Australia is officially free of the Varroa mite and
   fireblight, the latter often a cause for the dispute about apple imports
   from NZ.}},

Abstract = {{The flower constancy (the visit to a single plant species during a
   foraging trip) in pollinator insects is a theme widely discussed in
   behavioral ecology and has an important implication in the evolution of
   angiosperms. This behavior was studied in the bumblebees Bombus atratus
   Franklin and Bombus bellicosus Smith through palynological analysis of
   the nectar and pollen loads of individuals captured while foraging in a
   restricted area. In both species, there were more individuals with
   constant flights than with non-constant ones, although in the nectar
   loads of B. atratus there were no significant differences between
   individuals with each flight types. It was verified that the nectar
   loads of the individuals that made either constant or non-constant
   flights did not differ in the number of pollen grains they contained.
   Considering this measurement as an estimate for flight duration, the
   results would indicate that the probability of changing between plant
   species during nectar collection is independent of the foraging trip
   duration. In both species, most individuals who collected nectar and/or
   pollen from more than one plant species visited just two plant species.
   In these cases, the pollen of one plant species was predominant. In the
   bumblebees in which it was possible to analyze nectar and pollen loads,
   the botanical origin of both resources was the same or they shared the
   principal species (with the exception of two individuals), showing that
   bumblebees do not often use a botanical source in an exclusive way to
   collect nectar and another to collect pollen.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{More than 20,000 angiosperm species possess non-dehiscent anthers that
   open through small pores at the anther's tip. These flowers are visited
   by bees that use vibrations to remove pollen, a phenomenon known as buzz
   pollination. However, some floral visitors fail to transfer pollen
   efficiently, either through a mismatch of flower and insect size, or
   because they are unable to buzz-pollinate. These visitors collect
   pollen, but provide little or no pollination, behaving as pollen
   thieves. Although pollen theft is widespread in plants, few studies have
   quantified the incidence of pollen thieves for buzz-pollinated plants.
   We use observations of natural populations and floral manipulations of
   Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae) to investigate the incidence of pollen
   theft, find morphological and behavioural differences between
   pollinators and thieves, measure the pollination efficiency of visitors,
   and characterize the reproductive ecology of this herb. We found that
   most visitors act as thieves, with < 20 \% of all bees contacting the
   stigma. Insect visitors that regularly failed to contact the stigma
   (illegitimate visitors), included buzzing and non-buzzing bees, were
   significantly smaller, visited fewer flowers per bout, and stayed longer
   in each flower than (legitimate) visitors that regularly contact the
   stigma. Few flowers visited solely by illegitimate visitors set fruit.
   Our results show that S. rostratum requires insect visitation to set
   seed and natural populations experience moderate pollen limitation. We
   conclude that insect size, relative to the flower, is the main
   determinant of whether a visitor acts as a pollinator or a pollen thief
   in S. rostratum.}},

Abstract = {{An unprecedented array of observing systems, coupled with ever
   increasing computing capacity, makes this a golden era for ecologists to
   study and quantify ecosystem services using remote sensing technology.
   Here, we review recent studies that utilize remote sensing to understand
   the supply and demand of ecosystem services, with a specific focus on
   pollination services by bees in forested and agroforestry contexts.
   Pollination by bees is a globally threatened ecosystem service that
   supports the production of food crops and maintains plant biodiversity.
   We explore how studies that use remote sensing to characterize
   landscapes, monitor individual organisms, measure biodiversity proxies
   or species habitat, and describe ecosystem processes may improve
   modeling of pollination services on spatial scales that match
   large-scale management efforts, such as forest conservation policy. We
   then discuss future research opportunities, such as exploring LiDAR and
   radar for 3-D habitat measurements, mapping phenology in space and time,
   and direct measurement of pollination events and outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation has dramatically reduced the extent of Atlantic Forest
   cover in Brazil. Orchid bees are key pollinators in neotropical forest,
   and many species are sensitive to anthropogenic interference. In this
   sense understanding the matrix permeability for these bees is important
   for maintaining genetic diversity and pollination services. Our main
   objective was to assess whether the composition, abundance, and
   diversity of orchid bees in matrices differed from those in Atlantic
   forest. To do this we sampled orchid bees at 4-mo intervals from 2007 to
   2009 in remnants of Atlantic Forest, and in the surrounding pasture and
   eucalyptus matrices. The abundance, richness, and diversity of orchid
   bees diminished significantly from the forest fragment toward the matrix
   points in the eucalyptus and pasture. Some common or intermediate
   species in the forest areas, such as Eulaema cingulata (F.) and Euglossa
   fimbriata Moure, respectively, become rare species in the matrices. Our
   results show that the orchid bee community is affected by the matrices
   surrounding the forest fragments. They also suggest that connections
   between forest fragments need to be improved using friendly matrices
   that can provide more favorable conditions for bees and increase their
   dispersal between fragments.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides
   at sublethal levels impairs colonies of honeybees and other pollinators.
   Recently, it was found that sublethal contamination with neonicotinoids
   also affect growth and behavior of ants. In this study, we exposed red
   imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, to sublethal dosages of
   dietary imidacloprid and investigated its effect on ant feeding,
   digging, and foraging behavior. S. invicta consumed significantly more
   sugar water containing 0.01 mu g/ml imidacloprid than untreated sugar
   water. Ants fed with 0.01 mu g/ml imidacloprid also showed significantly
   increased digging activity than ants fed with untreated sugar water.
   However, imidacloprid at >= 0.25 mu g/ml significantly suppressed sugar
   water consumption, digging, and foraging behavior. These results
   indicate that imidacloprid at sublethal concentrations may have a
   significant and complicated effect on S. invicta.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are a functionally important and economically valuable group, but
   are threatened by land-use conversion and intensification. Such
   pressures are not expected to affect all species identically; rather,
   they are likely to be mediated by the species' ecological traits.
   Understanding which types of species are most vulnerable under which
   land uses is an important step towards effective conservation planning.
   We collated occurrence and abundance data for 257 bee species at 1584
   European sites from surveys reported in 30 published papers (70056
   records) and combined them with species-level ecological trait data. We
   used mixed-effects models to assess the importance of land use (land-use
   class, agricultural use-intensity and a remotely-sensed measure of
   vegetation), traits and traitxland-use interactions, in explaining
   species occurrence and abundance. Species' sensitivity to land use was
   most strongly influenced by flight season duration and foraging range,
   but also by niche breadth, reproductive strategy and phenology, with
   effects that differed among cropland, pastoral and urban
   habitats.Synthesis and applications. Rather than targeting particular
   species or settings, conservation actions may be more effective if
   focused on mitigating situations where species' traits strongly and
   negatively interact with land-use pressures. We find evidence that
   low-intensity agriculture can maintain relatively diverse bee
   communities; in more intensive settings, added floral resources may be
   beneficial, but will require careful placement with respect to foraging
   ranges of smaller bee species. Protection of semi-natural habitats is
   essential, however; in particular, conversion to urban environments
   could have severe effects on bee diversity and pollination services. Our
   results highlight the importance of exploring how ecological traits
   mediate species responses to human impacts, but further research is
   needed to enhance the predictive ability of such analyses.

Abstract = {{Loss of natural habitat can isolate pollinator populations and
   negatively affect sexual reproduction of animal-pollinated plants.
   We evaluated how the loss of natural forest affects pollinator diversity
   in the understory of the Atlantic Rainforest in Northeastern Brazil.
   We focused on bees, the main group of pollinators for angiosperms. We
   assessed how changes in forest cover at regional (36 km(2)) and local
   (0.36 km(2)) scales affect bee richness and abundance.
   We sampled 492 bees from 59 species, of which 58 \% were above ground
   nesting species and 73 \% exhibited some level of sociality. Our results
   show that the loss of forest had negative effects on understory bee
   abundance, which was particularly accentuated for species that nest
   above ground. However, for social bees the effect of changes in forest
   cover at a local scale depended on regional forest cover, negative
   effects being only detected when landscapes had at least 35 \% of
   forest. For bee richness, the null model was among the best models
   bringing considerable uncertainty about landscape effects on bee
   richness.
   These findings suggest that management strategies and conservation
   practices must integrate proper actions that consider both local and
   regional scales. For existing fragmented landscapes, it is important to
   increase forest availability at the regional scale, while also
   maintaining high environmental heterogeneity at the local scale. We
   believe that with proper landscape planning this multiscalar approach
   can be not only more effective, but also easier to implement.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees of Bombus terrestris are indispensible pollinators for
   ecosystems and for various agricultural crops. Unfortunately, bumblebees
   are challenged by various stress factors including insecticide
   applications. Today sublethal effects of various insecticides need to be
   thoroughly investigated to allow their combined use with pollinators and
   other beneficial organisms. In this study, we used lambda-cyhalothrin as
   a model pyrethroid insecticide and investigated lethal and sublethal
   effects by different dilutions, ranging from 1/10 to 1/100 of its
   maximum field recommended dosage (MFRC, 37.5 ppm), with the use of a
   chronic toxicity tests in the laboratory and in flight cages in the
   greenhouse. In the laboratory, small microcolonies with five bumblebee
   workers with one being pseudo-queen were used, while in the greenhouse
   we used queen-right mini-hives where the bumblebees need to fly for
   pyrethroid-contaminated food. We observed strong sublethal effects in
   the laboratory with treatments of 1/10 and 1/20 of the MFRC: the nest
   reproduction was reduced by 49 and 32 \%, respectively, and the sugar
   water consumption by 36 \%. With free-flying bumblebees, the toxic
   effects at 1/10 of the MFRC were more pronounced. A mortality of 88 +/-
   A 8 \% was observed after only 2 weeks, being twice the mortality in the
   laboratory microcolonies test (43 +/- A 11 \%). Besides, it should be
   mentioned that in the greenhouse experiment all queens were dead and
   most of the workers showed signs of incoordination and convulsion and
   gradually became apathetic. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the
   pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrin with a range of lethal and sublethal
   effects, both crucial for the development and survival of the B.
   terrestris colonies. Moreover, this study supports the demand to test
   insecticide compounds on their safety, especially when the bees have to
   perform complex tasks such as foraging for their food.}},

Abstract = {{As pollinator decline continues, the-need to provide high value forage
   for insects increases. Finding agricultural crops to diversify the
   landscape and provide forage is one way to improve pollinator health.
   Three winter industrial oilseed crops (pennycress, winter camelina, and
   winter canola) were grown in Morris, Minnesota, and Brookings, South
   Dakota, during the winters of 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. Each of the three
   crops has pollinator-friendly flowers and value as winter cover crops
   and cash seed crops. The crops were evaluated for pollinator use, nectar
   production, green cover, and yield. Pennycress, camelina, and canola
   flowers had high insect activity with maximum visitation rates of 67 +/-
   11.5, 22 +/- 3.1, and 61 +/- 6.8 insects min(-1). Cumulative nectar
   produced by pennycress, camelina, and canola was 13, 100, and 82 kg of
   sugar ha(-1) during the 2014 anthesis period, providing an important
   food resource to pollinators during early spring when there is little
   else on the agricultural landscape-that is blooming. Green cover in
   early spring ranged from 0 to 60\% amongst the three crops, with
   camelina providing >25\% green cover across all four site-years. Maximum
   seed yields were 1.1 +/- 0.04, 1.41 +/- 0.05, and 1.2 +/- 0.19 Mg ha(-1)
   for pennycress, camelina, and canola, respectively, which are
   economically viable harvests. Of the three crops, winter camelina
   provided the highest combined agroecosystem value through pollinator
   resources, green cover, and seed yields. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Pollination by bees is important for food production. Recent concerns
   about the declines of both domestic and wild bees, calls for measures to
   promote wild pollinator populations in farmland. However, to be able to
   efficiently promote and prioritize between measures that benefit
   pollinators, such as modified land use, agri-environment schemes, or
   specific conservation measures, it is important to have a tool that
   accurately predicts how bees use landscapes and respond to such
   measures. In this paper we compare an existing model for predicting
   pollination (the ``Lonsdorf model{''}), with an extension of a general
   model for habitat use of central place foragers (the ``CPF model{''}).
   The Lonsdorf model has been shown to perform relatively well in simple
   landscapes, but not in complex landscapes. We hypothesized that this was
   because it lacks a behavioral component, assuming instead that bees in
   essence diffuse out from the nest into the landscape. By adding a
   behavioral component, the CPF model in contrast assumes that bees only
   use those parts of the landscape that enhances their fitness, completely
   avoiding foraging in other parts of the landscape. Because foraging is
   directed toward the most rewarding foraging habitat patches as
   determined by quality and distance, foraging habitat will include a wide
   range of forage qualities close to the nest, but a much narrower range
   farther away. We generate predictions for both simple and complex
   hypothetical landscapes, to illustrate the effect of including the
   behavioral rule, and for real landscapes. In the real landscapes the
   models give similar predictions for visitation rates in simple
   landscapes, but more different predictions in heterogeneous landscapes.
   We also analyze the consequences of introducing hedgerows near a
   mass-flowering crop field under each model. The Lonsdorf model predicts
   that any habitat improvement will enhance pollination of the crop. In
   contrast, the CPF model predicts that the hedgerow must provide good
   nesting sites, and not just foraging opportunities, for it to benefit
   pollination of the crop, because good forage quality alone may drain
   bees away from the field. Our model can be used to optimize pollinator
   mitigation measures in real landscapes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{A new threat to bees? Entomopathogenic nematodes used in biological pest
   control cause rapid mortality in Bombus terrestris}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{There is currently a great deal of concern about population declines in
   pollinating insects. Many potential threats have been identified which
   may adversely affect the behaviour and health of both honey bees and
   bumble bees: these include pesticide exposure, and parasites and
   pathogens. Whether biological pest control agents adversely affect bees
   has been much less well studied: it is generally assumed that biological
   agents are safer for wildlife than chemical pesticides. The aim of this
   study was to test whether entomopathogenic nematodes sold as biological
   pest control products could potentially have adverse effects on the
   bumble bee Bombus terrestris. One product was a broad spectrum pest
   control agent containing both Heterorhabditis sp. and Steinernema sp.,
   the other product was specifically for weevil control and contained only
   Steinernema kraussei. Both nematode products caused >= 80\% mortality
   within the 96 h test period when bees were exposed to soil containing
   entomopathogenic nematodes at the recommended field concentration of 50
   nematodes per cm(2) soil. Of particular concern is the fact that
   nematodes from the broad spectrum product could proliferate in the
   carcasses of dead bees, and therefore potentially infect a whole bee
   colony or spread to the wider environment.}},

   neonicotinoid pesticide}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Bumblebees are exposed to pesticides applied for crop protection while
   foraging on treated plants, with increasing evidence suggesting that
   this sublethal exposure has implications for pollinator declines. The
   challenges of navigating and learning to manipulate many different
   flowers underline the critical role learning plays for the foraging
   success and survival of bees. We assessed the impacts of both acute and
   chronic exposure to field-realistic levels of a widely applied
   neonicotinoid insecticide, thiamethoxam, on bumblebee odour learning and
   memory. Although bees exposed to acute doses showed conditioned
   responses less frequently than controls, we found no difference in the
   number of individuals able to learn at field-realistic exposure levels.
   However, following chronic pesticide exposure, bees exposed to
   field-realistic levels learnt more slowly and their short-term memory
   was significantly impaired following exposure to 2.4 ppb pesticide.
   These results indicate that field-realistic pesticide exposure can have
   appreciable impacts on learning and memory, with potential implications
   for essential individual behaviour and colony fitness.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the rate of pollen-mediated flow and realized
   reproductive success at increasing distances from the source, across
   fragmented clonal stands of hybrid eucalypts in Brazil by parentage
   analysis of grown out seedlings using genetic data at 15 microsatellite
   markers. Two study areas were employed: a pollen donor area composed of
   a clonal stand of a single pollen donor clone (PD) and a pollen sink
   (PS) area composed of a mixed clonal stand of two other clones (PSI and
   PS2). In the pollen sink area four plots with 30 trees each, located at
   25, 200, 400 and 550 m from the PD were established as sink islands.
   Before flowering, the entire clonal stands of clones PSI and PS2, with
   exception of the sink islands were clear cut. Seeds were harvested from
   five randomly sampled trees in each sink island and the paternity of 15
   seedlings per tree, 75 seedlings per island totaling a sample of 300
   seedlings, was determined with PD as the alleged father. The
   self-pollination rate in the sink islands varied from zero to 24\%.
   Paternity assignment to the PD was highest in the island at 25 m
   (17.3\%) and rapidly decreased to 4.0\% at 200 m and 2.7\% at 550 m,
   suggesting a pattern of isolation by distance, while revealing a large
   pollen contribution from unaccounted sources across all islands. Our
   results in a fragmented clonal site agree with previous estimates of
   general pollen movement in eucalypt seed orchards, showing that
   pollination will take place by and large at relatively short distances
   of less than 200 m, consistent with the expected range of flight of
   pollinator bees. Nevertheless the exponential distribution observed also
   indicates that low levels of pollination success are to be expected over
   longer distances. Our data provide useful guidelines regarding the
   distance at which seed orchards should be established away from
   potentially large pollen pressure of clonal stands to minimize unwanted
   pollen introgression. Furthermore, our results on dispersal rate and
   distance of pollen have direct implications on gene containment
   strategies and modeling studies, as pollen-mediated gene flow is one of
   the key determinants of the potential ecological and biosafety impacts
   of prospective transgenic eucalypts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants in
   2011, a large evacuation zone was imposed in an area where residents had
   historically managed forests and farmlands. Thus, the human activities
   that had maintained biodiversity and ecosystem services in the zone were
   discontinued. Such change can affect insects, a biodiversity component
   that is relatively tolerant to radiation exposure. In this study, we
   investigated flying insects, including pollinators, important ecosystem
   providers inside and outside the zone, using Malaise traps. The results
   showed that the number of individuals of Xylocopa appendiculata, the
   largest Apidae species in the region, was significantly lower inside the
   evacuation zone than outside it, whereas those of other insects were not
   lower significantly. Although we suggest that flying insects and their
   ecosystem services (i.e., benefits from them such as pollination) 3
   years after the disaster were not critically impacted, it is important
   to monitor the long-term effects of the evacuation in the future.}},

Title = {{Decoupled evolution of floral traits and climatic preferences in a clade
   of Neotropical Gesneriaceae}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Major factors influencing the phenotypic diversity of a
   lineage can be recognized by characterizing the extent and mode of trait
   evolution between related species. Here, we compared the evolutionary
   dynamics of traits associated with floral morphology and climatic
   preferences in a clade composed of the genera Codonanthopsis, Codonanthe
   and Nematanthus (Gesneriaceae). To test the mode and specific components
   that lead to phenotypic diversity in this group, we performed a Bayesian
   phylogenetic analysis of combined nuclear and plastid DNA sequences and
   modeled the evolution of quantitative traits related to flower shape and
   size and to climatic preferences. We propose an alternative approach to
   display graphically the complex dynamics of trait evolution along a
   phylogenetic tree using a wide range of evolutionary scenarios.
   Results: Our results demonstrated heterogeneous trait evolution. Floral
   shapes displaced into separate regimes selected by the different
   pollinator types (hummingbirds versus insects), while floral size
   underwent a clade-specific evolution. Rates of evolution were higher for
   the clade that is hummingbird pollinated and experienced flower
   resupination, compared with species pollinated by bees, suggesting a
   relevant role of plant-pollinator interactions in lowland rainforest.
   The evolution of temperature preferences is best explained by a model
   with distinct selective regimes between the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   and the other biomes, whereas differentiation along the precipitation
   axis was characterized by higher rates, compared with temperature, and
   no regime or clade-specific patterns.
   Conclusions: Our study shows different selective regimes and
   clade-specific patterns in the evolution of morphological and climatic
   components during the diversification of Neotropical species. Our new
   graphical visualization tool allows the representation of trait
   trajectories under parameter-rich models, thus contributing to a better
   understanding of complex evolutionary dynamics.}},

Title = {{Testing Dose-Dependent Effects of the Nectar Alkaloid Anabasine on
   Trypanosome Parasite Loads in Adult Bumble Bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The impact of consuming biologically active compounds is often
   dose-dependent, where small quantities can be medicinal while larger
   doses are toxic. The consumption of plant secondary compounds can be
   toxic to herbivores in large doses, but can also improve survival in
   parasitized herbivores. In addition, recent studies have found that
   consuming nectar secondary compounds may decrease parasite loads in
   pollinators. However, the effect of compound dose on bee survival and
   parasite loads has not been assessed. To determine how secondary
   compound consumption affects survival and pathogen load in Bombus
   impatiens, we manipulated the presence of a common gut parasite,
   Crithidia bombi, and dietary concentration of anabasine, a nectar
   alkaloid produced by Nicotiana spp. using four concentrations naturally
   observed in floral nectar. We hypothesized that increased consumption of
   secondary compounds at concentrations found in nature would decrease
   survival of uninfected bees, but improve survival and ameliorate
   parasite loads in infected bees. We found medicinal effects of anabasine
   in infected bees; the high-anabasine diet decreased parasite loads and
   increased the probability of clearing the infection entirely. However,
   survival time was not affected by any level of anabasine concentration,
   or by interactive effects of anabasine concentration and infection.
   Crithidia infection reduced survival time by more than two days, but
   this effect was not significant. Our results support a medicinal role
   for anabasine at the highest concentration; moreover, we found no
   evidence for a survival-related cost of anabasine consumption across the
   concentration range found in nectar. Our results suggest that consuming
   anabasine at the higher levels of the natural range could reduce or
   clear pathogen loads without incurring costs for healthy bees.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid residues escaping in vacuum-planter exhaust during maize
   planting were measured in 25 fields in southwestern Ontario in 2013-2014
   using filter bags to collect planter exhaust dust and horizontal and
   vertical sticky traps to collect planter operation-generated dust.
   Atrazine residues were used to differentiate between neonicotinoid
   residues originating from seed or from disturbed soil. Recovery rates of
   seed-applied neonicotinoids in exhaust were 0.014 and 0.365\% in 2013
   and 2014, respectively, calculated on the basis of neonicotinoid
   concentrations in preplant soil and seed application rates.
   Neonicotinoid exhaust emission rates were 0.0036 and 0.1104 g/ha for
   2013 and 2014, respectively, with 99.9472 and 99.7820\% originating from
   treated seed in 2013 and 2014, respectively, calculated on the basis of
   the atrazine marker. Rates of recovery of seed-applied neonicotinoid
   residues by exhaust filter bags were 0.015 and 0.437\% for 2013 and
   2014, respectively. Neonicotinoid residues captured on horizontal and
   vertical traps were 1.10 ng/cm(2) (0.1104 g/ha) and 1.45 ng/cm(2)
   (0.0029 g/ha), respectively, with 92.31 and 93.03\% originating from
   treated seed, respectively, representing 0.3896\% of the original active
   ingredient applied to the seed planted. Exposure to pollinators can be
   best reduced by strategies to keep active ingredient on the seed, below
   the soil surface, and in the field where applied.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, an intense debate about the environmental risks posed
   by neonicotinoids, a group of widely used, neurotoxic insecticides, has
   been joined. When these systemic compounds are applied to seeds, low
   concentrations are subsequently found in the nectar and pollen of the
   crop, which are then collected and consumed by bees. Here we demonstrate
   that the current focus on exposure to pesticides via the crop overlooks
   an important factor: throughout spring and summer, mixtures of
   neonicotinoids are also found in the pollen and nectar of wildflowers
   growing in arable field margins, at concentrations that are sometimes
   even higher than those found in the crop. Indeed, the large majority
   (97\%) of neonicotinoids brought back in pollen to honey bee hives in
   arable landscapes was from wildflowers, not crops. Both previous and
   ongoing field studies have been based on the premise that exposure to
   neonicotinoids would occur only during the blooming period of flowering
   crops and that it may be diluted by bees also foraging on untreated
   wildflowers. Here, we show that exposure is likely to be higher and more
   prolonged than currently recognized because of widespread contamination
   of wild plants growing near treated crops.}},

Abstract = {{In pollination, plants provide food reward to pollinators who in turn
   enhance plant reproduction by transferring pollen, making the
   relationship largely cooperative; however, because the interests of
   plants and pollinators do not always align, there exists the potential
   for conflict, where it may benefit both to cheat the other {[}1, 2].
   Plants may even resort to chemistry: caffeine, a naturally occurring,
   bitter-tasting, pharmacologically active secondary compound whose main
   purpose is to detract herbivores {[}3-6], is also found in lower
   concentrations in the nectar of some plants, even though nectar, unlike
   leaves, is made to be consumed by pollinators {[}5, 7, 8]. A recent
   laboratory study showed that caffeine may lead to efficient and
   effective foraging by aiding honeybee memory of a learned olfactory
   association {[}4], suggesting that caffeine may enhance bee reward
   perception. However, without field data, the wider ecological
   significance of caffeinated nectar remains difficult to interpret. Here
   we demonstrate in the field that caffeine generates significant
   individual- and colony-level effects in free-flying worker honeybees.
   Compared to a control, a sucrose solution with field-realistic doses of
   caffeine caused honeybees to significantly increase their foraging
   frequency, waggle dancing probability and frequency, and persistency and
   specificity to the forage location, resulting in a quadrupling of
   colony-level recruitment. An agent-based model also demonstrates how
   caffeine-enhanced foraging may reduce honey storage. Overall, caffeine
   causes bees to overestimate forage quality, tempting the colony into
   sub-optimal foraging strategies, which makes the relationship between
   pollinator and plant less mutualistic and more exploitative.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators are declining globally, and this decline in ecosystem
   services threatens the stability of agricultural and natural systems.
   Pollinators depend on a diversity of floral resources that are primarily
   found in uncultivated areas of agro-ecosystems such as grasslands.
   Seasonal succession (the seasonal changes that occur in community
   composition and structure) of floral resources is an essential
   consideration for pollinator conservation within agro-ecosystems.
   Different types of grasslands common within agricultural landscapes
   could be expected to differ in their seasonal succession of floral
   resources. Here we investigated how different types of grasslands
   important for pollinator conservation in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion
   (remnant prairies, reconstructed prairies, conservation grazed cattle
   pastures, and old fields) differ in their seasonal succession of floral
   resources by sampling the plant community every two weeks from 3 May
   through 4 October 2013. We found remnant prairies had greater richness
   of inflorescences when summed over the growing season, and that remnants
   were least similar to the other grassland types in terms of composition.
   Reconstructed prairies had high richness of inflorescences and exhibited
   the most similarity in composition to remnant prairies only during the
   middle of the growing season. Conservation grazed cattle pastures had
   more periods where turnover in composition from one survey to the next
   was low, indicated by the coefficient of variation in turnover
   throughout the season. Old fields had the lowest richness of
   inflorescences and were significantly different from reconstructed and
   remnant prairies.}},

Title = {{Mitigation of pollen limitation in the lowbush blueberry agroecosystem:
   effect of augmenting natural pollinators}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Growers of small fruit crops often supplement the natural pollinator
   community by introducing pollinators into commercial orchards and
   fields, but there are relatively few studies that test the extent to
   which such interventions increase fruit yield. To test whether plants
   are limited by pollen availability, inflorescences in 78 commercial
   lowbush blueberry fields during three years were hand-pollinated either
   with supplemental outcross pollen, or marked and left as controls
   (open-pollination). Maximum fruit set with supplemental pollination was
   in the range 50-65\%, whereas with open-pollination, it was slightly,
   but significantly lower, in the range of 47-57\%, suggesting that pollen
   limitation can affect fruit set. In a two-year experiment, we augmented
   native pollinators with introduced honey bees, bumble bees, and leaf
   cutter bees and all combinations in 48 fields. Stigmatic pollen loads
   were influenced by the total numbers of managed bees in a field in 2010
   but not 2011. The presence of leaf cutter bees had a small but positive
   effect on seed set in 2010, and honey bees had a small but negative
   influence on seed set in 2011. There was a strong correlation between
   fruit set reproductive output of supplementally pollinated and
   open-pollinated plants, suggesting that plant health or plant resources
   influence reproductive success. Temperature variation among regional
   groupings of fields was minimal and is unlikely to have accounted for
   differences among fields in fruit set. We propose several reasons why,
   despite pollen-limitation of fruit and seed set of blueberry plants,
   augmentation of the pollinator community of lowbush blueberry did not
   significantly increase reproduction. These include pollinator-mediated
   transfer of self-pollen followed by subsequent fruit abortion due to
   inbreeding depression and resource limitation for fruit maturation.
   Management practices that focus on increasing outcross pollen receipt,
   or plant resources for fruit set may have greater overall benefit than
   pollinator augmentation alone.}},

Abstract = {{Growing human footprint on the environment rapidly modifies the living
   conditions of natural populations. This could lead to phenotypic changes
   through both plasticity and evolution. Therefore, distinguishing the
   role of evolution in the phenotypic response to global change is a major
   challenge. In this study, we benefited from past and recent seeds from a
   population of the annual self-compatible weed Adonis annua. Seeds were
   sampled from the same locality at an 18 years interval and close to a
   region where reduction of bee pollinators' density has been reported. We
   used a common garden experiment to investigate evolutionary changes,
   between the old (1992) and the recent (2010) sample, for some
   reproductive traits expected to be under selection in the context of
   climate warming and pollinator decline. Plants of the recent sample
   flowered earlier, had larger flowers, but also evolved a shorter floral
   longevity. The capacity of plants to reproduce autonomously (autonomous
   selfing) was similar in the two samples. These results are consistent
   with adaptation of flowering phenology to climate warming and in part
   consistent with the evolution of increased pollinator attraction under
   pollinator decline. Together with other recent studies, this study
   provides evidence that short-term evolution is a frequent phenomenon
   accompanying global change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Hermaphrodite plants commonly practice self-fertilization (selfing), but
   the mechanisms responsible vary depending on the mode of
   self-pollination, pollinator behavior, and degree of clonality. Whether
   selfing occurs within (autogamy) or between flowers (geitonogamy) is of
   evolutionary significance because their fitness consequences differ. We
   used floral manipulations and genetic markers to determine the relative
   contribution of autogamy and within- versus between-ramet geitonogamy to
   the selfing rate of the bumblebee-pollinated, clonal herb Aconitum
   kusnezoffii. Data on flowering phenology and bumblebee foraging were
   also collected to determine opportunities for different modes of
   self-pollination. Autogamy accounted for only 12\% of the selfing rate
   with the remainder resulting from geitonogamy. Whole-ramet emasculation
   of clones with multiple ramets reduced selfing by 78\%, indicating that
   within-ramet geitonogamy contributed significantly (68\%) to total
   selfing. Selfing of single-ramet plants was 44\% less than
   multiple-ramet plants, indicating that the contribution of between-ramet
   geitonogamy was substantially less (20\%) than within-ramet geitonogamy,
   probably because of bumblebee foraging behavior. Our results demonstrate
   for the first time in a clonal plant that within-ramet geitonogamy is
   substantially greater than between-ramet geitonogamy and highlight the
   importance of considering the influence of clonal architecture and
   pollinator foraging on modes of self-pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic networks in nature are widespread and play a key role in
   generating the diversity of life on Earth. They constitute an
   interdisciplinary field where physicists, biologists and computer
   scientists work together. Plant-pollinator mutualisms in particular form
   complex networks of interdependence between often hundreds of species.
   Understanding the architecture of these networks is of paramount
   importance for assessing the robustness of the corresponding communities
   to global change and management strategies. Advances in this problem are
   currently limited mainly due to the lack of methodological tools to deal
   with the intrinsic complexity of mutualisms, as well as the scarcity and
   incompleteness of available empirical data. One way to uncover the
   structure underlying complex networks is to employ information
   theoretical statistical inference methods, such as the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm. In particular, such an approach can be used
   to cluster the nodes of a network based on the similarity of their node
   neighborhoods. Here, we show how to connect network theory with the
   classical ecological niche theory for mutualistic plant-pollinator webs
   by using the EM algorithm. We apply EM to classify the nodes of an
   extensive collection of mutualistic plant-pollinator networks according
   to their connection similarity. We find that EM recovers largely the
   same clustering of the species as an alternative recently proposed
   method based on resource overlap, where one considers each party as a
   consuming resource for the other party (plants providing food to
   animals, while animals assist the reproduction of plants). Furthermore,
   using the EM algorithm, we can obtain a sequence of successfully-refined
   classifications that enables us to identify the fine-structure of the
   ecological network and understand better the niche distribution both for
   plants and animals. This is an example of how information theoretical
   methods help to systematize and unify work in ecology.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Flower, Floral Display, and Reward Sizes on Bumblebee
   Foraging Behavior When Pollen Is the Reward and Plants Are Dichogamous}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.The size of floral display, flower, and reward can
   influence pollinator foraging behavior. However, the importance of
   correlations between floral traits and rewards in affecting pollinator
   preferences is unclear. Moreover, in monoecious plants and plants with
   strong within-flower dichogamy, some flowers do not offer a pollen
   reward, and pollinator attraction may depend on the number of rewarding
   flowers rather than floral display size. We examined these questions in
   the Rocky Mountain columbine, where bumblebees can forage only for
   pollen produced in male-phase flowers.Methodology.We used dual-choice
   assays and experimental arrays to determine whether a correlation
   between pollen reward and flower size was necessary before bees could
   distinguish between flowers with different pollen rewards or sizes. The
   impact of floral display size on bee foraging was first examined using
   inflorescences where all flowers provided a reward, either small or
   large. We then varied either floral display size or number of rewarding
   flowers while keeping the other variable constant.Pivotal
   results.Bumblebees preferred flowers with a larger pollen reward or
   larger flowers only when the size of the pollen reward was correlated
   with flower size. Bees selected larger floral displays when all flowers
   presented a similar amount of pollen but preferred inflorescences with
   more pollen-rewarding flowers when only a proportion of the flowers
   offered a pollen reward.Conclusions.Bees could identify whether a flower
   offered pollen and could quantify the number of pollen-rewarding
   flowers. Correlations between floral traits and pollen reward affected
   pollinator preferences and may facilitate selection of floral traits by
   pollinators. Pollinators preferred inflorescences with more
   pollen-producing flowers rather than larger floral displays, which
   suggests that selection of floral display size by pollinators may differ
   between plants with different mating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees play an important role as pollinators of many crop plants
   and wild flowers. As in many wild bees, their abundance and diversity
   have declined in recent years, which may threaten the stability of
   pollination services. The observed decline is often linked with the loss
   or alteration of natural habitat, e.g., through urbanization, the
   conversion of natural habitat into largely sealed areas (concrete)
   inhabited by humans. The effects of urbanization on bumble bees remain
   as yet controversial with both positive and negative effects reported.
   We investigated how habitat isolation through increasing areas of
   concrete, as well as the diversity, abundance, and community composition
   of floral resources, determine bumble bee abundance and diversity in
   cities. We found plant species diversity and abundance to be more
   important than the amount of concrete in driving the abundance and
   species richness of common bumble bees in a German city. Moreover, plant
   species composition, i.e., the presence of specific plant species and
   families (e.g., Fabaceae), played a prominent role. In particular,
   flower-rich parks and gardens can offer a continuous food supply for
   bumble bees and attract bumble bee foragers even to isolated patches in
   the city center.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure to conserve biodiversity with limited resources has led to
   increasing use of species distribution models (SDMs) for spatial
   conservation prioritization. Published spatial prioritization exercises
   often focus on well-studied groups, with data compiled from on-line
   databases of ad-hoc collections. Conservation plans generally aim to
   protect all components of biodiversity, and it is implied that the
   species used in prioritization act as surrogates. Here, we assess the
   sensitivity of spatial priorities to model and surrogate choice using a
   case study from a fragmented agricultural area of south eastern
   Australia that is poorly represented in the national reserve system. We
   model the distributions of 30 species of bird, microbat and bee using
   two types of SDM; generalised linear models based on systematic surveys
   that yield presence and absence observations, and MaxEnt models based on
   biodiversity database records. Eight prioritization scenarios were
   tested using Zonation software, and were based on either the
   presence-background or presence-absence SDMs and combinations of
   surrogacy among the three taxa. We found low correlations between SDMs
   generated for the same species using different modelling frameworks ( =
   0.18, n = 26). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUC) estimates generated by MaxEnt were optimistic; on average 1.36
   times higher than when tested against the systematic survey data.
   Conservation priorities were sensitive to the choice of surrogate and
   type of data used to fit SDMs, and though bats and birds formed
   moderately good surrogates for each other, there was less compelling
   evidence of surrogacy for bees. Because valid surrogacy is unlikely with
   most existing data sets, investment in high quality data for
   less-surveyed groups prior to planning should still be a priority. If
   this is not possible, then it is advisable to analyse the sensitivity of
   conservation plans to the assumed surrogacy and quality of data
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Plantings in residential neighborhoods can support wild pollinators.
   However, it is unknown how effectively wild pollinators maintain
   pollination services in small, urban gardens with diverse floral
   resources. We used a `mobile garden' experimental design, whereby potted
   plants of cucumber, eggplant, and purple coneflower were brought to 30
   residential yards in Chicago, IL, USA, to enable direct assessment of
   pollination services provided by wild pollinator communities. We
   measured fruit and seed set and investigated the effect of within-yard
   characteristics and adjacent floral resources on plant pollination.
   Increased pollinator visitation and taxonomic richness generally led to
   increases in fruit and seed set for all focal plants. Furthermore, fruit
   and seed set were correlated across the three species, suggesting that
   pollination services vary across the landscape in ways that are
   consistent among different plant species. Plant species varied in terms
   of which pollinator groups provided the most visits and benefit for
   pollination. Cucumber pollination was linked to visitation by small
   sweat bees (Lasioglossum spp.), whereas eggplant pollination was linked
   to visits by bumble bees. Purple coneflower was visited by the most
   diverse group of pollinators and, perhaps due to this phenomenon, was
   more effectively pollinated in florally-rich gardens. Our results
   demonstrate how a diversity of wild bees supports pollination of
   multiple plant species, highlighting the importance of pollinator
   conservation within cities. Non-crop resources should continue to be
   planted in urban gardens, as these resources have a neutral and
   potentially positive effect on crop pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Plants interact simultaneously with both mutualists and antagonists.
   While webs of plant-animal interactions in natural systems can be highly
   complex, most interactions can be simplified into those that are either
   direct (mediated through pairwise interactions) or indirect (mediated
   through third-party species). Mechanistic studies of the direct and
   indirect pathways by which foliar herbivores affect plants have been
   well explored; however, mechanistic explorations of how floral
   herbivores, such as nectar robbers, affect total plant fitness via
   direct vs. indirect pathways have received less attention. The goal of
   this study was to assess the importance of direct vs.
   pollinator-mediated indirect effects of a floral antagonist on female
   and male components of plant fitness. We focused on the
   hummingbird-pollinated plant scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, which
   is nectar-robbed by the bumblebee Bombus occidentalis. Prior studies
   have found evidence for pollinator-mediated indirect effects of robbing
   on female and male components of I. aggregata fitness, but the
   mechanisms by which these indirect effects occur, and experimental
   evidence supporting or refuting direct effects of robbing, have been
   lacking. We found no evidence for direct effects of robbing on plant
   fitness. Robbers did not act as pollinators of I.aggregata nor did they
   directly affect seed production by making nectar-robber holes or
   removing nectar in hand-pollinated flowers. Moreover, robbing had no
   direct effect on pollen production per flower or the ability of pollen
   from robbed flowers to sire seeds in hand pollinations. However, nectar
   robbing had indirect effects on plant reproduction mediated through
   per-visit pollinator effectiveness at depositing pollen in robbed vs.
   unrobbed flowers. A simple model of a plant-robber-pollinator system
   suggested that robbing effects in general may occur through more
   indirect mechanisms when nectar removal by robbers is high relative to
   nectar replenishment, and that compensation for robbing is then more
   profitable through the production of additional flowers.Synthesis. Our
   results highlight the importance of indirect effects in mediating the
   fitness consequences of species interactions.}},

   differences from normal keel flowers, we studied the resupinate species
   Canavalia brasiliensis, Centrosema pascuorum and Clitoria fairchildiana,
   and compared with the normal keel Lathyrus pubescens, Crotalaria micans
   and Dioclea violacea. Both the behavior and morphology of bee visitors
   were observed and compared to the flower morphology. We observed that
   most features of the mechanism exhibited by inverted keel flower are
   found at keel flowers, except for three key innovations: a thickening at
   wings' margin in contact with the visitors' body, tighter interlocking
   between petals and strengthening of the vexillum structure. Most
   visitors are adapted to flower characteristics in their morphology and
   behavior, although some act as thieves due to some of their
   morphological features, such as mouthpart length. In spite of their
   differences, bees behave almost in the same way when visiting both
   normal and inverted keel morphologies. Compared to keel flowers,
   inverted keel flowers evolved toward more restrictive structures that
   require large-bodied bees to operate them. Finally, we discuss possible
   selective pressures that might have led to the evolution of inverted
   keel flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar larcenists target flowers with a long nectar spur. The western
   prairie fringed orchid, Platanthera praeclara Sheviak and Bowles
   (Orchidaceae), has a 50-mm-long spur and is pollinated by hawk moth
   (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) species with tongues that are shorter than the
   spur. We placed net traps above inflorescences at P. praeclara sites in
   southeastern North Dakota to survey potential nectar larcenists,
   including hawk moth thieves (2004-2014) and bumble bee robbers
   (2007-2014). We captured two hawk moths, Manduca quinquemaculata
   (Haworth) and Agrius cingulata (F.), that have tongues over twice the
   length of P. praeclara's spur. Also captured were eight bumble bee
   species (genus Bombus), which may produce the holes discovered in P.
   praecala's spur. Holes triggered loss of the spur and its nectar. In
   2007, 2013, and 2014, robbery was observed in 10, 60, and 37\% flowers
   per plant, respectively. At the flower level, robbery had a positive
   effect on removal of pollinaria and no effect on pollen deposition or
   seed capsule production. Based on results of an experiment, we propose
   that P. praeclara deploys variable nectar rewards across the
   inflorescence to promote a balance of selfing and outcrossing
   pollination. We expect less harm to this strategy from a robber bee
   satisfied by feeding on a single flower and more harm from a hawk moth
   thief that removes nectar from every flower of the inflorescence.
   Experiments are needed to determine whether nectar larceny is creating
   problems for conservation and recovery of P. praeclara, a threatened
   species in the United States and Canada.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate the permeability of three matrices of arboreal crops for the
   Euglossina bees that inhabit the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest hotspot.
   The comparisons of occurrences and abundances within three mosaics of
   forest and extensive arboreal crops (piassava palm, oil palm, and rubber
   tree) showed that all the matrices were permeable to most orchid bees.
   The piassava palm was the most permeable, where the spatial distribution
   of all species of Euglossina did not differ between forest fragments and
   matrix. The oil palm has shown some loss of permeability to Eulaema
   atleticana, while the rubber tree crop was not so permeable to El.
   atleticana and Euglossa imperialis. Euglossa iopoecila was sampled only
   in the forest fragments. At the present scale of forest cover in the
   three studied mosaics (10 to 40 \%), the arboreal matrices are
   contributing towards the functional connectivity in the Atlantic Rain
   Forest at both scales: the landscape mosaic and the Brazilian Atlantic
   Forest corridor.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the pollination ecology and floral lip
   morphology of Gongora bufonia Lindl., an epiphytic orchid from tropical
   forest, to better understand the peculiarities of its unusual
   pollination mechanism. Field observations on pollination were performed
   and floral lip samples were prepared for anatomical, histochemical, and
   ultrastructural analyses. Male Eufriesea violacea (Blanchard) bees use
   the second and third pairs of legs to hold on the epichile and collect
   the fragrance in the hypochile region. During this process, the bee
   slips and falls on the column and receives the pollinarium, which is
   attached to the rear edge of the bee's scutellum. A subsequent visit
   (usually to another flower) and fall through the flower may result in
   insertion of a pollinium into the stigmatic slit at the apex of the
   column. The fragrance production occurs in the hypochile region,
   specifically in the papillose epidermal cells and in the subepidermal
   parenchyma layers. The wax production occurs in the epichile region,
   exclusively in the epidermal cells. The cells of both regions, hypochile
   and epichile, have ultrastructural features of lipophilic secretion. The
   slippery quality of the epichile epidermis is due to wax deposits; this
   is probably essential to the pollination mechanism of G. bufonia.}},

   extinction in recent decades, representing a substantial increase in the
   extinction risk across this set of species. This may be impacting the
   delivery of benefits that these species provide to people. We recommend

Abstract = {{1. For the first time in more than a century, people across the planet
   are migrating en mass from cities to rural areas. In this process of
   exurbanisation' humans are rapidly converting natural and agricultural
   regions into low-density housing. Despite the scale of this exurban
   development and its potential negative impact on biodiversity, little is
   known about how this specific type of land conversion impacts wild
   pollinators. In this study, we conduct an extensive survey of the wild
   pollinators of the peach agroecosystem and investigate the impact of
   current and historic land use at multiple spatial scales on pollinator
   community composition within agroecological landscapes that have
   recently undergone exurban development. We reveal that the overall
   composition of the wild pollinator community is significantly associated
   with current local agricultural and natural land cover. Specifically,
   local agricultural land use was associated with ground-nesting bee
   community composition, whereas natural lands were associated with
   cavity-nesting bee composition, revealing that nesting materials drive
   community composition for these two groups in exurban habitats. In
   contrast, community composition for butterflies and flies, which made up
   the smallest proportion of our communities, were not strongly associated
   with any particular land use type, likely due to their non-central place
   foraging strategy. Most interestingly, our results indicate that
   historic land use remains a significant factor impacting the current
   abundance of all pollinators in the peach agroecosystem, offering the
   first evidence of extinction debt in this rapidly expanding exurban
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The rhythm of life on earth is shaped by seasonal changes in the
   environment. Plants and animals show profound annual cycles in
   physiology, health, morphology, behaviour and demography in response to
   environmental cues. Seasonal biology impacts ecosystems and agriculture,
   with consequences for humans and biodiversity. Human populations show
   robust annual rhythms in health and well-being, and the birth month can
   have lasting effects that persist throughout life. This review
   emphasizes the need for a better understanding of seasonal biology
   against the backdrop of its rapidly progressing disruption through
   climate change, human lifestyles and other anthropogenic impact. Climate
   change is modifying annual rhythms to which numerous organisms have
   adapted, with potential consequences for industries relating to health,
   ecosystems and food security. Disconcertingly, human lifestyles under
   artificial conditions of eternal summer provide the most extreme example
   for disconnect from natural seasons, making humans vulnerable to
   increased morbidity and mortality. In this review, we introduce
   scenarios of seasonal disruption, highlight key aspects of seasonal
   biology and summarize from biomedical, anthropological, veterinary,
   agricultural and environmental perspectives the recent evidence for
   seasonal desynchronization between environmental factors and internal
   rhythms. Because annual rhythms are pervasive across biological systems,
   they provide a common framework for transdisciplinary research.}},

Journal = {{PeerJ}},

Abstract = {{Neopasiphaeine bees (Apoidea: Colletidae) are known for their Amphinotic
   distribution in the Australian and Neotropical regions. Affinities
   between colletid taxa in Australia and South America have been
   speculated for decades, and have been confirmed by recent phylogenetic
   hypotheses that indicate a biogeographic scenario compatible with a
   trans-Antarctic biotic connection during the Paleogene. No
   neopasiphaeine species occurs on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, but
   the Neotropical species Hoplocolletes ventralis (Friese, 1924) was
   described as an Australian taxon due to an error in the specimen labels.
   This mistake was recognized by CD Michener 50 years ago. We herein
   report that the same labeling problem also happened with Dasycolletes
   chalceus Friese, 1924, which remained as a tentatively placed species in
   the Australian genus Leioproctus until now. Moreover, Dasycolletes
   chalceus is interpreted as a synonym of Hoplocolletes ventralis. We also
   provide a revised diagnosis for Hoplocolletes, describe the male of H.
   ventralis in detail for the first time, including a comparative study of
   its genitalia and associated sterna.}},

   loads and floral density data}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{313}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{The composition of social bees' corbicular pollen loads contains
   information about both the bees' foraging behavior and the surrounding
   floral landscape. There have been, however, few attempts to integrate
   pollen composition and floral landscape to test hypotheses about
   foraging behavior. Here, we present an individual-based model that
   generates the species composition of pollen loads given a foraging model
   and a spatial distribution of floral resources. We apply this model to
   an existing dataset of inflorescence counts and bumble bee pollen loads
   sampled at different field sites in California. For two out of three
   sites, a foraging model consisting in correlated random walks with
   constant preferences for each plant species provides a plausible fit for
   the observed distribution of pollen load content. Pollen load
   compositions at the third site could be explained by an extension of the
   model, where different preferences apply to the choice of an initial
   foraging patch and subsequent foraging steps. Since this model describes
   the expected level of pollen load differentiation due solely to the
   spatial clustering of conspecific plants, it provides a null hypothesis
   against which more complex descriptions of behavior (e.g. flower
   constancy) can be tested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification has been promoted as a means to achieve
   environmentally sustainable increases in crop yields by enhancing
   ecosystem functions that regulate and support production. There is,
   however, little direct evidence of yield benefits from ecological
   intensification on commercial farms growing globally important
   foodstuffs (grains, oilseeds and pulses). We replicated two treatments
   removing 3 or 8\% of land at the field edge from production to create
   wildlife habitat in 50-60 ha patches over a 900 ha commercial arable
   farm in central England, and compared these to a business as usual
   control (no land removed). In the control fields, crop yields were
   reduced by as much as 38\% at the field edge. Habitat creation in these
   lower yielding areas led to increased yield in the cropped areas of the
   fields, and this positive effect became more pronounced over 6 years. As
   a consequence, yields at the field scale were maintained-and, indeed,
   enhanced for some crops-despite the loss of cropland for habitat
   creation. These results suggested that over a 5-year crop rotation,
   there would be no adverse impact on overall yield in terms of monetary
   value or nutritional energy. This study provides a clear demonstration
   that wildlife-friendly management which supports ecosystem services is
   compatible with, and can even increase, crop yields.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, performance of five nature-inspired optimization
   algorithms, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO),
   artificial bee colony (ABC), firefly algorithm (FA), and flower
   pollination algorithm (EPA), was compared in molecular descriptor
   selection for development of quantitative structure retention
   relationship (QSRR) models for 83 peptides that originate from eight
   model proteins. The matrix with 423 descriptors was used as input, and
   QSRR models based on selected descriptors were built using partial least
   squares (PLS), whereas root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was
   used as a fitness function for their selection. Three performance
   criteria, prediction accuracy, computational cost, and the number of
   selected descriptors, were used to evaluate the developed QSRR models.
   The results show that all five variable selection methods outperform
   interval PLS (iPLS), sparse PLS (sPLS), and the full PLS model, whereas
   GA is superior because of its lowest computational cost and higher
   accuracy (RMSEP of 5.534\%) with a smaller number of variables (nine
   descriptors). The GA-QSRR model was validated initially through
   Y-randomization. In addition, it was successfully validated with an
   external testing set out of 102 peptides originating from Bacillus
   subtilis proteomes (RMSEP of 22.030\%). Its applicability domain was
   defined, from which it was evident that the developed GA-QSRR exhibited
   strong robustness. All the sources of the model's error were identified,
   thus allowing for further application of the developed methodology in
   proteomics.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. infects flowers of many
   plant species, including alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). In southern
   Alberta, blossom blight, caused in part by B. cinerea, reduces yields of
   seed alfalfa in cool, wet growing seasons. Previous studies have
   suggested that B. cinerea uses pollen to begin infection, and that the
   fungal-infected pollen may be vectored by alfalfa leafcutter bees
   (Megachile rotundata Fab.). A longitudinal greenhouse study was
   performed to investigate the role of pollen in the infection process of
   alfalfa florets by B. cinerea. The effects of pollination (pollinated vs
   unpollinated) and inoculation method (dry vs aqueous suspension) on
   floret and pollen infection was tested. Florets were harvested at 0, 24,
   48 and 94h after inoculation. Pollinated florets that were dry
   inoculated had significantly greater levels of infection (84\%) than
   similarly inoculated unpollinated florets (38\%, P<0.001); however no
   pollen infection was observed. In contrast, 90\% of
   suspension-inoculated florets were infected and a small (<1\%) but
   significant (P<0.0001) level of infected pollen was observed in these
   samples. Leafcutter bees were also collected from seed alfalfa fields in
   2013 and 2014 to estimate the prevalence of B. cinerea on pollen. Pollen
   removed from field bees showed no growth by B. cinerea; however, the
   bees that were directly plated on agar medium exhibited an increased
   load of B. cinerea as the growing season progressed. Thus, under typical
   field conditions, alfalfa pollen is not likely to be a significant
   factor contributing to the establishment and spread of B. cinerea.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus Latreille) provide indispensable ecosystem services
   for natural and agricultural systems by increasing crop yield and
   quality. With documented bumble bee declines throughout the world, the
   need for baseline data on these important insects becomes apparent. The
   bumble bees of Oklahoma have previously not been surveyed, hampering
   assessment of temporal change. The objectives of this study were to
   determine the past and present bumble bee species richness of Oklahoma
   and indicate possible temporal trends. Records were gathered from museum
   and university collections, as well as from a field survey of 46 sites
   in 21 counties. Historical records indicated ten bumble bee species in
   Oklahoma, four of which had fewer than ten total records. Only five
   species have been recorded since 2000, four being found in the targeted
   survey: B. pensylvanicus (DeGeer), B. griseocollis (DeGeer), B.
   fraternus (Smith) and B. impatiens (Cresson). The American bumble bee
   (B. pensylvanicus) has been, and continues to be, the most common bumble
   bee species in Oklahoma, despite showing clear patterns of decline in
   other regions of North America. Our results parallel several recent
   studies that failed to locate extant populations of the variable cuckoo
   bee, Bombus variabilis (Cresson), supporting possible extirpation in
   portions of its North American range. A targeted survey for this species
   is warranted, as its host, B. pensylvanicus, remains common in Oklahoma.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial production of tomato crop in glasshouse needs proper

   environmental conditions. Self, manual and bumblebee pollination methods
   with different parameters were studied with bumblebee foragers
   trafficking from hives to flowers for first, fourth and seventh week
   with foraging time per flower for effective pollination. Effective
   foraging was observed till 7th week of observation and visitation rate
   was significantly more in Cherry as compared to Grandella cultivar with
   more visitation rate per flower. Significant increase in both
   qualitative as well as quantitative parameters was observed with
   increased fruit size, roundness and numbers per truss. Bumblebees helped
   to decrease the need for manual pollination, increased yield and quality
   of the green house tomato crops. Importance of bumblebees and selection
   of cultivar for good crop under high tunnel cropping systems is

Abstract = {{Spider wasps (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) constitute a monophyletic family
   supported by numerous morphological and behavioural traits. The
   subfamilial and tribal classifications, however, have a history of
   conflicting and confusing designations and nomenclature. Here, we
   reconstruct a molecular phylogeny of Pompilidae from Bayesian and
   maximum-likelihood analyses of four nuclear molecular markers
   (elongation factor-1 alpha F2 copy, long-wavelength rhodopsin, RNA
   polymerase II, and 28S ribosomal RNA). A Bayesian divergence-time
   estimation analysis was performed using four calibration points and an
   ancestral-area reconstruction was performed with a Bayesian binary
   Markov chain Monte Carlo method. New relationships are recovered, and
   new subfamilial delimitations are proposed and discussed based on the
   phylogeny. The origin of Pompilidae was c. 43.3 Mya, probably in the
   Nearctic region. Most of the extant subfamilies originated from the late
   Eocene to the Oligocene, and their current distributions are the product
   of various dispersal events that occurred over the course of similar to
   40 Mya. This is the first phylogenetic reconstruction of Pompilidae from
   molecular characters, with broad geographical and taxonomic sampling.
   The following subfamilies and relationships are recognized: Ctenocerinae
   + ((Ceropalinae + Notocyphinae) + (Pompilinae + Pepsinae)). We
   revalidate Notocyphinae, which contains only Notocyphus, and define a
   new tribe in Pompilinae: Sericopompilini. Priochilini is reinstated.
   Sericopompilini contains Sericopompilus as the sole representative;
   Priochilini contains Priochilus and Balboana. Epipompilus and Chirodamus
   are now classified as Pepsinae. (C) 2015 The Linnean Society of London.}},

   structure and composition of a cavity-nesting bee-wasp (CNBW) community,
   their nests associates (henceforth parasitoids), and their interactions.
   We set up 24 nest-trapping stations in a fragmented, extensively farmed
   area of similar to 100 km(2). We obtained 2035 nests containing 7572
   brood cells representing 17 bee and 18 wasp species, attacked by 20
   parasitoid species. Community structure and composition, as well as
   network structure, were much more dependent on local than on landscape
   factors. Host abundance and richness were higher in farms. In addition,
   host abundance was positively correlated to cropland cover. We also
   found highly significant differences between nesting environments in
   host community composition. Structure and composition of the parasitoid
   community were conditioned by the structure and composition of the host
   community. Network structure was affected by nesting environment but not
   by landscape factors. Interactions tended to be more diverse in farms.
   This result was mostly explained by differences in network size (greater
   in farms). However, generality was significantly higher in farms even
   after controlling for network size, indicating that differences in
   species' interaction patterns associated to differences in community
   composition between the two nesting environments are also affecting
   network structure. In conclusion, open habitats associated with
   extensively farmed exploitations favor local CNBW diversity (especially
   bees) and result in more complex host-parasitoid interaction networks in
   comparison to forested areas. The conservation value of this kind of
   open habitat is important in view of the progressive abandonment of
   extensively cultivated farmland taking place in Europe at the expense of
   agricultural intensification and reforestation.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution models (SDM) are increasingly used to understand
   the factors that regulate variation in biodiversity patterns and to help
   plan conservation strategies. However, these models are rarely validated
   with independently collected data and it is unclear whether SDM
   performance is maintained across distinct habitats and for species with
   different functional traits. Highly mobile species, such as bees, can be
   particularly challenging to model. Here, we use independent sets of
   occurrence data collected systematically in several agricultural
   habitats to test how the predictive performance of SDMs for wild bee
   species depends on species traits, habitat type, and sampling technique.
   We used a species distribution modeling approach parametrized for the
   Netherlands, with presence records from 1990 to 2010 for 193 Dutch wild
   bees. For each species, we built a Maxent model based on 13 climate and
   landscape variables. We tested the predictive performance of the SDMs
   with independent datasets collected from orchards and arable fields
   across the Netherlands from 2010 to 2013, using transect surveys or pan
   traps. Model predictive performance depended on species traits and
   habitat type. Occurrence of bee species specialized in habitat and diet
   was better predicted than generalist bees. Predictions of habitat
   suitability were also more precise for habitats that are temporally more
   stable (orchards) than for habitats that suffer regular alterations
   (arable), particularly for small, solitary bees. As a conservation tool,
   SDMs are best suited to modeling rarer, specialist species than more
   generalist and will work best in long-term stable habitats. The
   variability of complex, short-term habitats is difficult to capture in
   such models and historical land use generally has low thematic
   resolution. To improve SDMs' usefulness, models require explanatory
   variables and collection data that include detailed landscape
   characteristics, for example, variability of crops and flower
   availability. Additionally, testing SDMs with field surveys should
   involve multiple collection techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of pollination biology are largely diurnally biased, especially
   in plant species whose flowers conform to diurnal pollination syndromes.
   Though these syndromes can be useful in generating hypotheses regarding
   a species' primary pollinators, they may also lead to incorrect
   assumptions. This study explores the relative contributions of diurnal
   and nocturnal pollination to fruit set in Lyonia lucida, an ericaceous
   shrub of the southeastern United States whose floral form suggests
   pollination by bumble bees. Floral visitation to L. lucida and pollen
   loads of visitors were quantified in a population of the species in
   Central Florida (U.S.A.), and the relative contributions of diurnal and
   nocturnal pollination tested. Mating system characteristics of L. lucida
   were also examined. Results show L. lucida flowers are visited mainly by
   nocturnal moths, who are capable of carrying large pollen loads, and
   nocturnal pollination is the primary driver of fruit set. In addition L.
   lucida at the study site shows severe barriers to selfing and strong
   pollen limitation. This is the first time a population of an ericaceous
   species has been shown to be pollinated primarily by nocturnal floral
   visitors and suggests pollination biologists should not be so quick to
   discount these potentially important pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence for declines in wild bees calls for the development and
   implementation of effective mitigation measures. Enhancing floral
   resources is a widely accepted measure for promoting bees in
   agricultural landscapes, but effectiveness varies considerably between
   landscapes and regions. We hypothesize that this variation is mainly
   driven by a combination of the direct effects of measures on local
   floral resources and the availability of floral resources in the
   surrounding landscape. To test this, we established wildflower strips in
   four European countries, using the same seed mixture of forage plants
   specifically targeted at bees. We used a before-after control-impact
   approach to analyse the impacts of wildflower strips on bumblebees,
   solitary bees and Red List species and examined to what extent effects
   were affected by local and landscape-wide floral resource availability,
   land-use intensity and landscape complexity. Wildflower strips generally
   enhanced local bee abundance and richness, including Red-listed species.
   Effectiveness of the wildflower strips increased with the local contrast
   in flower richness created by the strips and furthermore depended on the
   availability of floral resources in the surrounding landscape, with
   different patterns for solitary bees and bumblebees. Effects on solitary
   bees appeared to decrease with increasing amount of late-season
   alternative floralresources in the landscape, whereas effects on
   bumblebees increased with increasing early-season landscape-wide floral
   resource availability.Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that
   the effects of wildflower strips on bees are largely driven by the
   extent to which local flower richness is increased. The effectiveness of
   this measure could therefore be enhanced by maximizing the number of bee
   forage species in seed mixtures, and by management regimes that
   effectively maintain flower richness in the strips through the years. In
   addition, for bumblebees specifically, our study highlights the
   importance of a continuous supply of food resources throughout the
   season. Measures that enhance early-season landscape-wide floral
   resource availability, such as the cultivation of oilseed rape, can
   benefit bumblebees by providing the essential resources for colony
   establishment and growth in spring. Further research is required to
   determine whether, and under what conditions, wildflower strips result
   in actual population-level effects.

Abstract = {{Bumble bee abundance in agricultural landscapes is known to decrease
   with increasing distance from seminatural grasslands, but whether the
   pollination of bumble-bee-pollinated wild plants shows a similar pattern
   is less well known. In addition, the relative effects of landscape
   composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration
   (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the
   interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using
   landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to
   disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb,
   the sticky catchfly (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the
   proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of
   bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which
   seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using
   potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity
   (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration).
   Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants did not respond to
   landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed
   rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage
   flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen
   limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from
   seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant
   levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the
   within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in
   landscape configuration. Although landscape effects on pollination were
   less important than predicted, we conclude that landscape configuration
   and local habitat characteristics play larger roles than landscape
   composition in the pollination of L. viscaria.}},

   experiment. Plots (deliberately akin to garden borders) were planted
   with one of three treatments, representing assemblages of plants based
   on origin (native, near-native and exotic). Invertebrates and resource
   measurements were recorded over fouryears. This paper reports the
   abundance of flower-visiting aerial insects (pollinators') associated
   with the three plant assemblages. For all pollinator groups on all
   treatments, greater floral resource resulted in an increase in visits.
   There was, however, a greater abundance of total pollinators recorded on
   native and near-native treatments compared with the exotic plots.
   Short-tongued bumblebees followed the same pattern whilst more
   hoverflies were recorded on the native treatment than the other
   treatments, and more honeybees on the near-native treatment. There was
   no difference between treatments in abundance of long-tongued bumblebees
   or solitary bees. The lack of difference in solitary bee abundance
   between treatments was probably due to a third of individuals from this
   group being recorded on one exotic plant species. The number of flower
   visitors corresponded to the peak flowering period of the treatments,
   that is there were fewer flower visitors to the exotic treatment
   compared with the other treatments in early summer but relatively more
   later in the season.Synthesis and applications. This experiment has
   demonstrated that utilizing plants from only a single region of origin
   (i.e. nativeness) may not be an optimal strategy for resource provision
   for pollinating insects in gardens. Gardens can be enhanced as a habitat
   by planting a variety of flowering plants, biased towards native and
   near-native species but with a selection of exotics to extend the
   flowering season and potentially provide resources for specialist
   groups.

Abstract = {{The influence of locally different species interactions on trait
   evolution is a focus of recent evolutionary studies. However, few
   studies have demonstrated that geographically different
   pollinator-mediated selection influences geographic variation in floral
   traits, especially across a narrow geographic range. Here, we
   hypothesized that floral size variation in the Japanese herb Prunella
   vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae) is affected by geographically different
   pollinator sizes reflecting different pollinator assemblages. To
   evaluate this hypothesis, we posed two questions. (1) Is there a
   positive correlation between floral length and the proboscis length of
   pollinators (bumblebees) across altitude in a mountain range? (2) Does
   the flower-pollinator size match influence female and male plant
   fitness? We found geographic variation in the assemblage of pollinators
   of P.vulgaris along an altitudinal gradient, and, as a consequence, the
   mean pollinator proboscis length also changed altitudinally. The floral
   corolla length of P.vulgaris also varied along an altitudinal gradient,
   and this variation strongly correlated with the local pollinator size
   but did not correlate with altitude itself. Furthermore, we found that
   the size match between the floral corolla length and bee proboscis
   length affected female and male plant fitness and the optimal size match
   (associated with peak fitness) was similar for the female and male
   fitness. Collectively, these results suggest that pollinator-mediated
   selection influences spatial variation in the size of P.vulgaris flowers
   at a fine spatial scale.}},

Abstract = {{In temperate regions, foraging resources for pollinating insects are
   particularly important in early spring, especially for social insects
   like bumblebees that are initiating colonies. Heathlands, protected open
   habitats under EU law, provide floral resources (pollen and nectar) for
   a range of pollinating insects. In early spring, in Belgian heathlands,
   only two floral resources are available: willows Salix spp. (Salicaceae)
   and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus (Ericaceae). Our objective was to
   assess whether these two plant species provide quantitative and
   qualitative resources during early spring. We examined the springtime
   activity of flower visitors on both S. x multinervis and V. myrtillus
   flowers in relation to sugar concentration and composition in nectar as
   well as composition of polypeptides and amino acids in pollen. The
   chemical composition of pollen differed significantly between the two
   plant species. Salix x multinervis offered pollen with higher
   polypeptide and essential amino acid contents than V. myrtillus.
   However, nectar quantities of V. myrtillus flowers were relatively high
   compared to S. x multinervis. During the overlapping flowering period of
   the two plant species, flower visitors seemed to favor high quality and
   easily accessible pollen of S. x multinervis species and visited V.
   myrtillus mainly for nectar resources.}},

Abstract = {{Among other human-related activities, habitat loss and fragmentation are
   currently ranked as the most important environmental features affecting
   the persistence of animal and plant populations in landscapes, as well
   as the maintenance of ecological processes and services. Since these
   processes are also capable of affecting the ontogenetic development of
   species inhabiting those landscapes, here we measured the wing veins of
   male Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier (Apidae: Euglossini) bees in order to
   evaluate whether the bees sampled in agriculture (AG) areas suffer
   higher fluctuating asymmetry (FA) than those sampled in Cerrado (CE)
   areas in the Brazilian state of Goias. We believe that individuals
   sampled in CE areas would be less asymmetric than those sampled in AG
   areas, given a potential higher exposure of these specimens to
   environmental stresses (mostly pesticides). However, we did not observe
   a significant trend in the FA measures we obtained, although three wing
   measures were bigger for bees from CE areas. The lack of significant
   effects of FA may be related to inherent bionomic features of E.
   nigrita. For instance, given their high individual dispersal abilities,
   the individuals we analyzed may have developed in different areas than
   those where they were sampled. Their generalist feeding behavior may
   also have given them a higher resistance to environmental perturbations,
   buffering the normal development of immatures even in areas with local
   high environmental stress. Nonetheless, higher death rates of
   individuals from anthropic areas may also have killed the developing
   immatures of E. nigrita before they reached adulthood consequently
   equalizing our sampled estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Mobility of flowers in the wind has been proposed to affect the
   performances of pollinators in landing on flowers, nectar extraction,

   Bombus impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae) for landing on and
   feeding from immobile or mobile artificial flower. Mobile flowers moved
   at varied frequencies (0.1-3.0 Hz) and in different directions,
   horizontal H (left to right wave) and vertical V (from en-face
   presentation at the lowest point to horizontal presentation at the
   zenith). We found that the bees showed no preference for mobile or
   immobile flowers. In general, we found that landing ability (time spent
   from the bees entering the testing arena to landing and starting to feed
   on the artificial flower) decreased as frequency (Hz) or speed of motion
   (cm/second) increased. Directionality of waving affected performance
   with the bees being able to forage from horizontally moving flowers
   better than from vertically moving flowers. Experience played a major
   role in improving individual performances. We also found that the bees
   could differentiate between horizontally and vertically waving flowers

Abstract = {{AimPollinators play an important role in ecosystem functioning,
   affecting also crop production. Their decline may hence lead to serious
   ecological and economic impacts, making it essential to understand the
   processes that drive pollinator shifts in space and time. Land-use
   changes are thought to be one of the most important drivers of
   pollinators' loss, and there is increasing investment on
   pollinator-friendly landscape management. However, it is still unclear
   whether landscape history of a given region determines how pollinator
   communities respond to further landscape modification.
   LocationThe Netherlands.
   MethodsUsing geographically explicit historical landscape and pollinator
   data from the Netherlands, we evaluated how species richness changes of
   three important pollinator groups (bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are
   affected by landscape changes related to habitat composition,
   fragmentation and species spillover potential and whether such effects
   depend on the historical characteristics of the landscape.
   ResultsThe effect of landscape changes varied between different
   pollinator groups. While bumblebee richness benefited from increases in
   edges between managed and natural systems, other bees benefited from
   increases in landscape heterogeneity and hoverfly richness was fairly
   resistant to land-use changes. We found that for the majority of the
   pollinators past landscape characteristics conditioned, the more recent
   pollinator richness changes. Landscapes that historically had more
   suitable habitat were more susceptible to display hoverfly declines
   (caused by drivers not considered in this study). Landscapes that
   historically had greater spillover potential were more likely to suffer
   butterfly richness declines and the bumblebee assemblages were more
   susceptible to the effects of fragmentation.
   Main conclusionsThe diversity of responses of the pollinator groups
   suggest that multispecies approaches that take group-specific responses
   to land-use change into account are highly valuable. These findings
   emphasize the limited value of a one-size-fits-all biodiversity
   conservation measure and highlight the importance of considering
   landscape history when planning biodiversity conservation actions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Parasite effects on host behaviour frequently alter their hosts'
   trophic interactions. There are many compelling examples of such effects
   in herbivore-based trophic interactions, but less attention has been
   paid to how parasite effects on host behaviour can alter mutualistic

   behaviour, and many pollinators are attacked by a wide range of
   parasites and parasitoids. 3. To investigate whether parasites affect
   pollination service via changes in host behaviour, natural variation in
   conopid fly parasitism was used to investigate the relationship between
   infection and Bombus impatiens Cresson behaviour foraging on arrays of
   Trifolium pretense L. flowers in the laboratory. The consequences of
   infection for seed set and seed mass were also examined. 4. Conopid
   parasitism was not related to any measured behavioural response;
   however, flowers visited by conopid-parasitised bees set significantly
   heavier seeds than those visited by unparasitised bees. Larger bees were
   more likely to be parasitised, but the relationship between parasitism
   and seed set still held after accounting for body size. 5. The present
   results demonstrate that parasitoids may have positive impacts on
   per-visit pollination, but, because larger bees were more frequently
   parasitised, parasitism could also affect pollination by removing the
   largest pollinators from the population.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of the integrative taxonomic approach in
   bumblebees has led to unexpected merging or splitting of several taxa.
   Here we investigate the taxonomic statuses of one of the most abundant,
   widespread and polytypic Palearctic bumblebees, Bombus pascuorum. The
   latest review of this species includes 24 subspecies. We used an
   integrative approach based on genetic markers and male chemical
   reproductive traits and compared our results with the former
   classifications. Our results show that all B. pascuorum taxa are
   conspecific and share the same male chemical reproductive traits. The
   genetic structure observed in one mitochondrial and two nuclear markers
   poorly reflects the current subspecific classification. Indeed, the
   concordance of population genetic differentiation, population geographic
   distribution, and population colour pattern similarity suggests a
   different meaningful prospective classification with four taxon
   complexes: (i) the B. pascuorum dusmeti group, including all taxa from
   the Iberian Peninsula and south-west France; (ii) B. pascuorum
   rehbinderi; (iii) B. pascuorum siciliensis; and (iv) B. pascuorum
   floralis groups (including all other taxa studied here).}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental flowers commonly grown in urban gardens and parks can be of
   value to flower-visiting insects. However, there is huge variation in
   the number of insects attracted among plant varieties. In this study, we
   quantified the insect attractiveness of 79 varieties in full bloom being
   grown in a public urban garden that is popular due to its beautiful
   flowers and other attractions. The results showed very clearly that most
   varieties (77\%, n = 61) were either poorly attractive or completely
   unattractive to insect flower visitors. Several varieties (19\%, n = 15)
   were moderately attractive, but very few (4\%, n = 3) were highly
   attractive. Closer examination of Dahlia varieties showed that open
   flowered forms were approximately 20 times more attractive than closed
   flowered forms. These results strongly suggest that there is a great
   potential for making urban parks and gardens considerably more bee- and
   insect-friendly by selecting appropriate varieties.}},

Abstract = {{Hormesis, a biphasic dose response whereby exposure to low doses of a
   stressor can stimulate biological processes, has been reported in many
   organisms, including pest insects when they are exposed to low doses of
   a pesticide. However, awareness of the hormesis phenomenon seems to be
   limited among bee researchers, in spite of the increased emphasis of
   late on pollinator toxicology and risk assessment. In this commentary,
   we show that there are several examples in the literature of substances
   that are toxic to bees at high doses but stimulatory at low doses.
   Appreciation of the hormetic dose response by bee researchers will
   improve our fundamental understanding of how bees respond to low doses
   of chemical stressors, and may be useful in pollinator risk assessment.

Abstract = {{Ecological partnerships, or mutualisms, are globally widespread,
   sustaining agriculture and biodiversity. Mutualisms evolve through the
   matching of functional traits between partners, such as tongue length of
   pollinators and flower tube depth of plants. Long-tongued pollinators
   specialize on flowers with deep corolla tubes, whereas shorter-tongued
   pollinators generalize across tube lengths. Losses of functional guilds
   because of shifts in global climate may disrupt mutualisms and threaten
   partner species. We found that in two alpine bumble bee species,
   decreases in tongue length have evolved over 40 years. Co-occurring
   flowers have not become shallower, nor are small-flowered plants more
   prolific. We argue that declining floral resources because of warmer
   summers have favored generalist foraging, leading to a mismatch between
   shorter-tongued bees and the longer-tubed plants they once pollinated.}},

Abstract = {{Orchids are the most diverse family of angiosperms, with over 25 000
   species, more than mammals, birds and reptiles combined. Tests of
   hypotheses to account for such diversity have been stymied by the lack
   of a fully resolved broad-scale phylogeny. Here, we provide such a
   phylogeny, based on 75 chloroplast genes for 39 species representing all
   orchid subfamilies and 16 of 17 tribes, time-calibrated against 17
   angiosperm fossils. A supermatrix analysis places an additional 144
   species based on three plastid genes. Orchids appear to have arisen
   roughly 112 million years ago (Mya); the subfamilies Orchidoideae and
   Epidendroideae diverged from each other at the end of the Cretaceous;
   and the eight tribes and three previously unplaced subtribes of the
   upper epidendroids diverged rapidly from each other between 37.9 and
   30.8 Mya. Orchids appear to have undergone one significant acceleration
   of net species diversification in the orchidoids, and two accelerations
   and one deceleration in the upper epidendroids. Consistent with theory,
   such accelerations were correlated with the evolution of pollinia, the
   epiphytic habit, CAM photosynthesis, tropical distribution (especially
   in extensive cordilleras), and pollination via Lepidoptera or euglossine
   bees. Deceit pollination appears to have elevated the number of orchid
   species by one-half but not via acceleration of the rate of net
   diversification. The highest rate of net species diversification within
   the orchids (0.382 sp sp 1 My-1) is 6.8 times that at the Asparagales
   crown.}},

Abstract = {{The Osmia cornifrons bee plays an important role in pollinating fruit
   trees, such as apple trees. To better understand diapause and
   oviposition in O. cornifrons, we investigated the correlation between
   ovarian development and the secretion level of OcVg protein in
   hemolymph. During ovarian development in wintering, the number of
   oocytes progressively increased compared with the length of the ovaries
   and the oocytes. After wintering, the oocyte and ovary sizes developed
   up to 6 days after emergence and declined after 6 days, but the number
   of oocytes decreased gradually. The secretion level of OcVg protein in
   the hemolymph revealed that during wintering, the secretion level
   increased from month 1 to month 2 and then stagnated after 2 months.
   After diapause, the secretion level increased gradually until day 6 of
   the newly emerged adult from the cocoon stage and thereafter gradually
   declined, remaining detectable until day 30 of the adult stage. The
   correction analysis between ovarian development and OcVg secretion level
   in the hemolymph showed that during wintering, the number of oocytes
   positively correlated with the OcVg secretion level. After diapause, the
   lengths of the ovary and first oocyte and the number of oocytes showed
   significant changes in the OcVg secretion level and strongly correlated
   with the OcVg secretion level, respectively. These results suggest that
   there is a significant interaction between ovarian development and the
   secretion level of OcVg protein and that the pattern of ovarian
   development and the secretion of OcVg protein are stage-specific in the
   O. cornifrons female. (C) 2015 Korean Society of Applied Entomology,

Abstract = {{This study investigates the flowering and pollinators of the floral
   morphs of three co-occurring distylous species, Psychotria conjugens
   Mull, P. hastisepala Mull. Arg. and P. sessilis Vell., in two
   consecutive flowering seasons in an Atlantic Forest fragment in
   southeastern Brazil. The species have diurnal, cream-colored, tubular,
   nectariferous flowers and their flowering occurs in the rainy season,
   from September to April, with little or no overlapping between species,
   characterizing a staggered flowering. The flowering of the long- and
   short-styled floral morphs of each species was synchronous, but the
   number of open flowers per day per morph tended to vary in each
   flowering season. These numbers were higher in P. sessilis and P.
   conjugens and, probably, resulted in higher total numbers of visits on
   its flowers (up to 1084 visits in P. sessilis and 756 in P. conjugens),
   compared to that observed in P. hastisepala (up to 71). There was a
   higher frequency of visits to long-styled flowers of all species. The
   bee Ariphanarthra palpails was a common pollinator to all species. This
   bee is native to Brazil, solitary, considered relatively rare and its
   host plants were unknown. Other native bees (Melipona spp.) also visited
   the flowers of the Psychotria species. The availability of flowers with
   similar floral features over eight months, the staggered flowering and
   common pollinators appear to be part of a strategy to attract floral
   visitors, minimizing the competition for pollinators and then favoring
   the legitimate pollination of these plants.}},

Title = {{The effect of repeated, lethal sampling on wild bee abundance and

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{1. Bee pollinators provide a critical ecosystem service to wild and
   agricultural plants but are reported to be declining world-wide due to
   anthropogenic change. Long-term data on bee abundance and diversity are
   scarce, and the need for additional quantitative sampling using
   repeatable methods has been emphasized. Recently, monitoring programmes
   have begun using a standardized method that employs a combination of pan
   traps and sweep netting, resulting in lethal sampling of bees. This
   standardized method can remove a large number of bees from sites during
   each sampling day, raising concern that the sampling itself could have a
   negative effect on bee populations.
   2. We conducted an experiment to assess whether lethal sampling for bees
   using pan traps and netting affected bee abundance and diversity when
   done every two weeks throughout a season and over multiple years. We
   compared bee abundance, richness, evenness and functional group
   composition between sites that had been sampled every two weeks from
   2009 to 2012 to similar sites not previously sampled.
   3. We found that the standardized method for sampling bees, with
   specimens from 132 morphospecies, did not affect bee communities in
   terms of abundance, rarefied richness, evenness, or functional group
   composition. Thus, our results indicate that the bee communities we
   sampled are robust to such sampling efforts, despite removing an average
   of 2862 bees per season.
   4. We discuss several explanations for why sampling did not affect bee
   abundance or community structure, including a density-dependent response
   to reduced competition for resources.
   5. These results suggest that bee monitoring programmes sampling once
   every two weeks with pan traps and netting will not affect bee community
   structure. We urge researchers monitoring bees to utilize standardized
   protocols so that results can be compared across space and time.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects provide a vital ecosystem service to crops and wild
   plants. Exposure to low doses of neonicotinoid insecticides has
   sub-lethal effects on social pollinators such as bumblebees and
   honeybees, disturbing their navigation and interfering with their
   development. Solitary Hymenoptera are also very important ecosystem
   service providers, but the sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids have not
   yet been studied well in those animals. We analyzed the ability of
   walking Osmia to remember a feeding place in a small environment and
   found that Osmia remembers the feeding place well after 4 days of
   training. Uptake of field-realistic amounts of the neonicotinoid
   clothianidin (0.76 ng per bee) altered the animals' sensory responses to
   the visual environment and interfered with the retrieval of navigational
   memory. We conclude that the neonicotinoid clothianidin compromises
   visual guidance and the use of navigational memory in the solitary bee
   Osmia cornuta.}},

Abstract = {{In many plant species, larger flowers offer larger or higher quality
   rewards to visitors, and flower visitors preferentially visit these
   larger, more rewarding flowers. Limited evidence suggests that plants in
   which flower size provides more reliable information about reward value
   have higher reproductive success than plants in which flower size offers
   less reliable information. We tested whether bumblebees could learn to
   respond to flower size when it was an informative reward cue while
   simultaneously learning not to respond to it when it was not
   informative. We also tested whether bees would develop a preference for
   a flower type that provided reward cues over one that did not. Bees were
   allowed to forage on an artificial array containing 2 flower types, each
   with a unique color and scent. In the informative flower type, large
   flowers contained sucrose rewards, whereas small flowers contained
   quinine solution ( a deterrent). In the uninformative flower type, both
   flower sizes were equally likely to contain sucrose or quinine. Bees
   learned to prefer large flowers in the informative flower type and to be
   indifferent to flower size in the uninformative type. However, contrary
   to expectations, bees did not develop a preference for the informative
   type. These results suggest that although bees may benefit from floral
   cues that give information about rewards, plants offering these cues may
   not receive more flower visits than plants that do not.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the adaptive' traits in angiosperm flowers occur only in some
   species within a clade. One good example of such traits is floral colour
   change, that is the retention of old, nonreproductive, rewardless, but
   fully turgid flowers in an altered colour. This trait has been viewed as
   a plant strategy to enhance distant pollinator attraction while
   minimizing visits to nonreproductive flowers. Considering that the same
   scenario appears true for most visually oriented flower visitors,
   however, it is unclear why this trait does not prevail in nature. To
   understand such evolutionary patterns, we conducted a screening search
   for floral colour change in 219 angiosperm species. We quantified
   spectral alterations in petals or petaloid organs and translated them
   into colour shifts through insect eyes. Using phylogeny-based
   comparative methods, we further explored possibilities accounting for
   the infrequent occurrences of floral colour change: tendency of related
   species to resemble each other more than those randomly drawn from the
   phylogenetic tree (i.e. phylogenetic signal), constraints imposed
   through pigment coloration and their functions and evolutionary
   correlates of floral colour change. Ultraviolet-sensitive insect eyes
   were estimated to perceive floral colour change more often than
   previously noticed. We detected significant phylogenetic signal in the
   degree of floral colour change. The evolution of floral colour change
   appeared constrained by pigment chemistry, because greater changes were
   more likely to occur in yellow or red floral parts. Postchange colours
   tended to retain distant visual detectability (i.e. green-receptor
   contrast), while reducing attractiveness in a close range (i.e. colour
   contrast), indicating another constraint imposed through the functions
   of pigment coloration. Data also suggest a possible evolutionary
   association between floral colour change and bee pollination. Results
   indicate that floral colour change is scarce in nature because it
   primarily evolved to accommodate bees or comparable pollinators and
   because its occurrence was constrained by phylogenetic relatedness,
   pigment chemistry and ecological functions. An understanding of floral
   evolution thus requires considering different causalities for trait
   diversity in an integrative manner.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread evidence of pollinator declines has led to policies
   supporting habitat restoration including in agricultural landscapes.
   Yet, little is yet known about the effectiveness of these restoration
   techniques for promoting stable populations and communities of
   pollinators, especially in intensively managed agricultural landscapes.
   Introducing floral resources, such as flowering hedgerows, to enhance
   intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes is known to increase the
   abundances of native insect pollinators in and around restored areas.
   Whether this is a result of local short-term concentration at flowers or
   indicative of true increases in the persistence and species richness of
   these communities remains unclear. It is also unknown whether this
   practice supports species of conservation concern (e.g., those with more
   specialized dietary requirements). Analyzing occupancies of native bees
   and syrphid flies from 330 surveys across 15 sites over eight years, we
   found that hedgerow restoration promotes rates of between-season
   persistence and colonization as compared with unrestored field edges.
   Enhanced persistence and colonization, in turn, led to the formation of
   more species-rich communities. We also find that hedgerows benefit
   floral resource specialists more than generalists, emphasizing the value
   of this restoration technique for conservation in agricultural
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The New Zealand alpine flora displays a range of unusual characteristics
   compared with other alpine floras, in particular the high frequency of
   species with small white flowers. The presence of both white and bright
   purple flowers on the same plant in the New Zealand alpine annual
   creeping eyebright (Euphrasia dyeriWettst.) provides an ideal
   opportunity to investigate the significance of flower colour in an
   environment where coloured flowers are rare. The relationships among
   flower age, gender phase, reward availability and petal colour were
   assessed in natural populations of E.dyeri. The effect of pollination on
   flower colour was tested using hand pollination of bagged flowers.
   Direct observations and videos of flowers were used to assess patterns
   of flower visitation by native and introduced pollinators. Unpollinated
   white E.dyeri flowers changed from white to purple within 6 days.
   However, pollination of white flowers triggered a significantly faster
   colour change, typically within 1-2 days. White flowers had receptive
   stigmas, large amounts of lipid-rich pollen and small amounts of nectar,
   whereas stigmas of purple flowers are not receptive and flowers did not
   provide pollen or nectar rewards. Flowers were mainly visited by native
   syrphid flies. Both native syrphids and introduced Bombus bees showed a
   marked avoidance of purple flowers, tending to preferentially visit
   white flowers. Our study suggests that flower colour change from white
   to bright purple in E.dyeri functions to direct pollinators to
   rewarding, receptive flowers. As many EuphrasiaL. species are described
   as having variably coloured flowers, this mechanism may be more
   widespread in the genus. Furthermore, our results add to the growing
   evidence that the dominance of white flowers in the New Zealand alpine
   is not simply due to a lack of colour discrimination among pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination by insects is a vital ecosystem service and the need for
   its assessment is increasing in recognition and political pressure, but
   there are currently no large-scale systematic monitoring schemes in
   place to measure the direct provision of this service. 2. This study
   tested a protocol for using a citizen science approach to quantify
   pollination service provision in gardens and allotments, requiring
   participants to grow Vica faba L. plants and carry out some simple
   manipulations of the pollination environment (flowers with bees
   excluded, flowers hand-pollinated, or flowers left for local pollinators
   to visit). Volunteers assessed yield in the three treatments. 3. Eighty
   participants from across the U.K. successfully completed all parts of
   the protocol; a further 93 participants were unsuccessful but actively
   engaged with the project. 4. Overall, the present results suggest that
   pollination services for V. faba are currently not limiting in gardens
   or allotments in the U.K. It is possible and cost-effective to recruit
   volunteers to collect data on pollination deficits using this protocol.
   5. The approach used in this paper, which could readily be extended to
   incorporate other plant species reliant on different guilds of
   pollinators, is feasible for adoption as a national monitoring scheme
   for pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their natural origin, biopesticides are assumed to be less
   harmful to beneficial insects, including bees, and therefore their use
   has been widely encouraged for crop protection. There is little
   evidence, however, to support this ingrained notion of biopesticide
   safety to pollinators. Because larval exposure is still largely
   unexplored in ecotoxicology and risk assessment on bees, an
   investigation was performed on the lethal and sublethal effects of a
   diet treated with 2 bioinsecticides, azadirachtin and spinosad, on the
   stingless bee, Melipona quadrifasciata, which is one of the most
   important pollinators in the Neotropics. Survival of stingless bee
   larvae was significantly compromised at doses above 210ng a.i./bee for
   azadirachtin and 114ng a.i./bee for spinosad. No sublethal effect was
   observed on larvae developmental time, but doses of both compounds
   negatively affected pupal body mass. Azadirachtin produced deformed
   pupae and adults as a result of its insect growth regulator properties,
   but spinosad was more harmful and produced greater numbers of deformed
   individuals. Only spinosad compromised walking activity of the adult
   workers at doses as low as 2.29ng a.i./bee, which is 1/5000 of the
   maximum field recommended rate. In conclusion, the results demonstrated
   that bioinsecticides can pose significant risks to native pollinators
   with lethal and sublethal effects; future investigations are needed on
   the likelihood of such effects under field conditions. Environ Toxicol

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{803-811}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions have usually been researched in flowers
   that have fully opened. However, some pollinators can visit flowers
   before full opening and contribute to fruit and seed sets. In this
   paper, we researched the pollination biology of flowers just starting to
   open in four field experiments. We observed the insect visitors to
   Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea for 3 years at five sites. These
   observations revealed that only small bees, Lasioglossum japonicum,
   often entered through tiny spaces between the tepals of `breaking buds'
   (i.e. partially opened flowers) and collected pollen. We hypothesized
   that they can pollinate this species at the breaking-bud stage, when the
   stigma is located near the anthers. To measure the pollination effect of
   small bees at the breaking-bud stage, we bagged several breaking buds
   after small bees had visited them and examined whether these buds were
   pollinated. In bagging experiments, 30 \% of the breaking buds set fruit
   and seeds. Fruit-set ratios of the breaking buds did not differ
   significantly from those of the fully opened flowers, which had been
   visited by several insect species. We also counted the pollen grain
   numbers on the body of L. japonicum and on the anthers of
   randomly-selected and manipulated flowers. These experiments revealed
   that all of the captured bees had some pollen of target plants and that
   L. japonicum collected most of the pollen grains at the breaking-bud
   stage. Our results showed that the new pollination process, breaking-bud
   pollination, happened in breaking buds by L. japonicum, although there
   is no evidence to reveal that this is the most effective pollination
   method for L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. In principle, this new
   pollination process can occur in other flowering plants and our results
   are a major contribution to studies of plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A simple Weibull distribution based empirical model that predicts
   pollen-parent fecundity distributions based on polycross size alone has
   been developed in outbred forage legume species for incorporation into
   quantitative genetic theory.
   Random mating or panmixis is a fundamental assumption in quantitative
   genetic theory. Random mating is sometimes thought to occur in actual
   fact, although a large body of empirical work shows that this is often
   not the case in nature. Models have been developed to explain many
   non-random mating phenomena. This paper measured pollen-parent fecundity
   distributions among outbred perennial forage legume species
   {[}autotetraploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), autohexaploid kura
   clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.), and diploid red clover (Trifolium
   pratense L.)] in ten polycrosses ranging in size (N) from 9 to 94
   pollinated with bee pollinators {[}Bumble Bees (Bombus impatiens Cr.)
   and leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.)]. A Weibull distribution
   best fit the observed pollen-parent fecundity distributions. After
   standardizing data among the 10 polycrosses, a single Weibull
   distribution-based model was obtained with an R (2) of 0.978. The model
   is able to predict pollen-parent fecundity distributions based on
   polycross size alone. The model predicts that the effective polycross
   size will be approximately 9 \% smaller than under random mating (i.e.,
   N (e)/N similar to 0.91). The model is simple and can easily be
   incorporated into other models or simulations requiring a pollen-parent
   fecundity distribution. Further work is needed to determine how widely
   applicable the model is.}},

Abstract = {{Urban agriculture can increase the sustainability of cities by reducing
   their ecological footprint, conserving biodiversity, and improving
   quality of life in a city. Given the environmental, economic and social
   value of urban agriculture, it is important to understand the ecosystem
   services that sustain it. We experimentally investigated how pollination
   by wild bees affects tomato production on 16 urban agriculture sites in
   San Francisco, CA. By comparing four pollination service indicators
   (fruit set, fruit mass, yield, and seed set) in four pollination
   treatments (open, artificial-self, artificial-cross, control), we were
   able to determine that tomatoes pollinated by wild bees significantly
   outperform the control in terms of all four pollination service
   indicators measured. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate
   that urban areas can support adequate pollination service to urban
   agriculture, regardless of garden size, garden age, or proportion of
   impervious surface in the surrounding matrix, and that floral resource
   density is a major factor influencing pollination service.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{The temporal dynamics of ecosystem functioning and services are largely
   regulated by seasonal patterns, or phenology, of Earth's biota. Recent
   evidence suggests that species in exotic-dominated systems may exhibit
   altered phenology relative to species in native-dominated systems.
   However, whether phenology of plants and pollinator communities differ
   between existing novel, exotic-dominated ecosystems and native-dominated
   systems remains poorly understood. We tested whether exotic-and
   native-dominated grasslands differed across a growing season for plant
   production, species and functional diversity, and bee pollinator
   abundances and diversity in the Northern Great Plains tallgrass prairie
   region, Iowa, USA. We found that niche overlap and some aspects of
   phenology in exotic-dominated systems were different from native systems
   for plants, but not for pollinators. Exotic dominated grasslands peaked
   earlier in biomass production, and exhibited consistently lower levels
   of species and functional diversity, including higher levels of
   proportion of C-3 biomass, than native grasslands. These results were
   related to higher levels of temporal niche overlap in exotic grasslands,
   where species were similar across the growing season in exotic, but not
   in native, grasslands. Surprisingly, bee pollinator communities did not
   differ between exotic and native grasslands despite higher forb:grass
   ratios in native sites, implying that factors other than exotic-native
   status may be important in structuring pollinator communities at this
   scale in highly fragmented landscapes. Our results imply that
   phenological differences between communities in novel and native
   grasslands can have important consequences to diversity and ecosystem
   functioning, and that exotic or native status of plant species should be
   considered in future studies of phenology.}},

   in the bottle traps. A total of 168 males belonged to four of five
   Euglossini genera distributed among 16 species were recorded. The
   greatest species richness was registered in the genus Euglossa, however
   Eulaema nigrita, was the most abundant Euglossine species in the
   community. The species richness varied between the edge and the first
   point within the fragment. The males were more active between 10:00 and

Abstract = {{Diversification of field edges is widely used as a strategy to augment
   pollinator populations and, in turn, supplement crop pollination needs.
   Hedgerow plantings, a commonly applied field-scale diversification
   technique, have been shown to increase wild bee richness within edges
   and into crop fields; however, their effects on pollination services in
   mass-flowering, pollinator-dependent crops typical of large-scale
   commercial monocultures are less well-known. We evaluated the indirect
   contribution of hedgerows to sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seed set
   vis-a-vis wild bee abundance and the interaction between wild bees and
   managed honey bee pollinators. Although wild bee species richness and
   the interaction between wild and managed pollinators were significantly
   associated with augmented seed set, these factors were unrelated to
   whether a hedgerow was present. The pollinator species foraging within
   crop fields differed significantly from those found within adjacent
   hedgerows and bare or weedy field edges, with hedgerows supporting
   higher species richness than crop fields or unenhanced edges. However,
   in an independent data set, greater numbers of sunflower-pollinating
   bees were found in hedgerows than in control edges. Hedgerows may
   therefore help these crop-pollinating species persist in the landscape.
   Our findings suggest that hedgerows may not always simultaneously
   achieve crop pollination and wild bee conservation goals; instead, the
   benefits of hedgerows may be crop- and region-specific. We recommend
   evaluation of hedgerow benefits in a variety of crop and landscape
   contexts to improve their ability to meet ecosystem-service provisioning
   needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As honeybees are the main pollinator subject to an intense research
   regarding effects of pesticides, other ecologically important native bee
   pollinators have received little attention in ecotoxicology and risk
   assessment of pesticides in general, and insecticides in particular,
   some of which are perceived as reduced-risk compounds. Here, the impact
   of three reduced-risk insecticides - azadirachtin, spinosad and
   chlorantraniliprole - was assessed in two species of stingless bees,
   Partamona helleri and Scaptotrigona xanthotrica, which are important
   native pollinators in Neotropical America. The neonicotinoid
   imidacloprid was used as a positive control. Spinosad exhibited high
   oral and contact toxicities in adult workers of both species at the
   recommended label rates, with median survival times (LT(50)s) ranging
   from 1 to 4 h, whereas these estimates were below 15 min for
   imidacloprid. Azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole exhibited low
   toxicity at the recommended label rates, with negligible mortality that
   did not allow LT50 estimation. Sublethal behavioural assessments of
   these two insecticides indicated that neither one of them affected the
   overall group activity of workers of the two species. However, both
   azadirachtin and chlorantraniliprole impaired individual flight take-off
   of P. helleri and S. xanthotrica worker bees, which may compromise
   foraging activity, potentially leading to reduced colony survival. These
   findings challenge the common perception of non-target safety of
   reduced-risk insecticides and bioinsecticides, particularly regarding
   native pollinator species.}},

Title = {{Effects of an agri-environment scheme on bumblebee reproduction at local
   and landscape scales}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{519-530}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been implemented across Europe,
   aiming to mitigate effects of habitat loss in agroecosystems for a range
   of declining species. These include pollinating insects such as
   bumblebees, for which positive effects of AES on abundance and species
   richness have been shown. However, there is a lack of evidence for
   effects of AES on reproduction of target species, at either local or
   landscape scales, We conducted a large-scale study across landscapes
   exhibiting a gradient of agricultural intensity to investigate the
   effects of a targeted flower mixture, sown in patches of three different
   sizes, on an index of the total biomass of bumblebee sexuals (males and
   queens) on replicated transects within each landscape. We used this
   index (MQ) as a measure of bumblebee reproduction. After controlling for
   floral density on transects, we found that MQ was significantly higher
   on sown flower patches than on conventionally managed control patches at
   local scales throughout the three-year study. While sown flower patches
   did not significantly increase MQ in surrounding landscapes, MQ was
   higher in landscapes surrounding larger (I ha) than smaller (0.25 ha)
   sown patches. Our results suggest that, while responses of different bee
   species may vary depending on the plant species sown, targeted flower
   mixtures can enhance bumblebee reproduction by providing locally
   attractive forage resources to bumblebees of all castes and sexes from
   nests within foraging distance. If established at large enough scales,
   sown flower patches may lead to a detectable spill-over of reproductives
   into surrounding landscapes. Furthermore, effects of sown patches on MQ
   were moderated by landscape context, the strongest positive responses
   being detected at sites with high proportions of arable land. This
   supports previous findings that AES can deliver greater net benefits for
   pollinators in more intensively farmed landscapes.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Bees are model organisms for the study of learning and memory, yet
   nearly all such research to date has used a single reward, nectar. Many
   bees collect both nectar (carbohydrates) and pollen (protein) on a
   single foraging bout, sometimes from different plant species. We tested
   whether individual bumblebees could learn colour associations with
   nectar and pollen rewards simultaneously in a foraging scenario where
   one floral type offered only nectar and the other only pollen. We found
   that bees readily learned multiple reward-colour associations, and when
   presented with novel floral targets generalized to colours similar to
   those trained for each reward type. These results expand the ecological
   significance of work on bee learning and raise new questions regarding
   the cognitive ecology of pollination.}},

Title = {{How much flower-rich habitat is enough for wild pollinators? Answering a
   key policy question with incomplete knowledge}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-35}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In 2013, an opportunity arose in England to develop an agri-environment
   package for wild pollinators, as part of the new Countryside Stewardship
   scheme launched in 2015. It can be understood as a policy window', a
   rare and time-limited opportunity to change policy, supported by a
   narrative about pollinator decline and widely supported mitigating
   actions. An agri-environment package is a bundle of management options
   that together supply sufficient resources to support a target group of
   species. This paper documents information that was available at the time
   to develop such a package for wild pollinators. Four questions needed
   answering: (1) Which pollinator species should be targeted? (2) Which
   resources limit these species in farmland? (3) Which management options
   provide these resources? (4) What area of each option is needed to
   support populations of the target species? Focussing on wild bees, we
   provide tentative answers that were used to inform development of the
   package. There is strong evidence that floral resources can limit wild
   bee populations, and several sources of evidence identify a set of
   agri-environment options that provide flowers and other resources for
   pollinators. The final question could only be answered for floral
   resources, with a wide range of uncertainty. We show that the areas of
   some floral resource options in the basic Wild Pollinator and Farmland
   Wildlife Package (2\% flower-rich habitat and 1 km flowering hedgerow),
   are sufficient to supply a set of six common pollinator species with
   enough pollen to feed their larvae at lowest estimates, using minimum
   values for estimated parameters where a range was available. We identify
   key sources of uncertainty, and stress the importance of keeping the
   Package flexible, so it can be revised as new evidence emerges about how
   to achieve the policy aim of supporting pollinators on farmland.}},

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, and bee diversity
   has been shown to be closely associated with pollination, a valuable
   ecosystem service. Higher functional diversity and species richness of
   bees have been shown to lead to higher crop yield. Bees simultaneously
   represent a mega-diverse taxon that is extremely challenging to sample
   thoroughly and an important group to understand because of pollination
   services. We sampled bees visiting apple blossoms in 28 orchards over
   6years. We used species rarefaction analyses to test for the
   completeness of sampling and the relationship between species richness
   and sampling effort, orchard size, and percent agriculture in the
   surrounding landscape. We performed more than 190h of sampling,
   collecting 11,219 specimens representing 104 species. Despite the
   sampling intensity, we captured <75\% of expected species richness at
   more than half of the sites. For most of these, the variation in bee
   community composition between years was greater than among sites.
   Species richness was influenced by percent agriculture, orchard size,
   and sampling effort, but we found no factors explaining the difference
   between observed and expected species richness. Competition between
   honeybees and wild bees did not appear to be a factor, as we found no
   correlation between honeybee and wild bee abundance. Our study shows
   that the pollinator fauna of agroecosystems can be diverse and
   challenging to thoroughly sample. We demonstrate that there is high
   temporal variation in community composition and that sites vary widely
   in the sampling effort required to fully describe their diversity. In
   order to maximize pollination services provided by wild bee species, we
   must first accurately estimate species richness. For researchers
   interested in providing this estimate, we recommend multiyear studies
   and rarefaction analyses to quantify the gap between observed and
   expected species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects are of major ecological and commercial importance,
   yet they may be facing ecological disruption from a changing climate.
   Despite this threat, few studies have investigated the life-history
   responses of pollinators to experimentally controlled changes in
   temperature, which should be especially informative for species with
   complex life histories such as eusocial insects. This study uses the key
   pollinator Bombus terrestris, a eusocial bumblebee with an annual colony
   cycle, to determine how temperature affects life-history traits at both
   individual and colony levels. In two laboratory experiments, we reared
   B.terrestris colonies at either 20 or 25 degrees C, and measured
   differences in a set of life-history traits including colony longevity,
   queen longevity, worker longevity, production of workers, production of
   sexuals (queen and male production) and growth schedule, as well as
   effects on thermoregulatory behaviours. Higher rearing temperature had a
   significant positive effect on colony longevity in one of the two
   experiments but no significant effects on queen or worker longevity.
   Higher rearing temperature significantly increased colony size but did
   not affect the timing of peak colony size. It was also associated with
   significantly higher queen production but had no effect on the
   production of workers or males or the timing of male production. Higher
   temperature colonies exhibited significantly more wing fanning by
   workers and significantly less wax canopy construction. Hence, an
   increase in rearing temperature of a few degrees increased colony
   longevity, colony size and queen production. However, individual
   longevity was not affected and so may have been buffered by changes in
   costly thermoregulatory behaviours. We conclude that eusocial insects
   may show complex phenotypic responses to projected temperature increases
   under climate change, including effects on productivity and reproduction
   at the colony level. Such effects should be considered when predicting
   the impact of climate change on the provision of essential pollination
   services.}},

Title = {{A comparison of reproductive strategies between island and mainland
   Caribbean Gesneriaceae}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of self-pollination has long been considered an adaptive
   strategy to cope with low or variable pollinator service; however,
   alternative reproductive strategies, such as generalized pollination (>1
   pollinator functional group), may also ensure plant reproductive success
   in environments with inadequate pollinator visitation. Island-mainland
   systems provide ideal settings to assess the interaction between
   pollination and breeding systems in response to pollinator visitation
   because islands are often pollinator-depauperate. This study compared 28
   insular and 26 mainland species of Caribbean Gesneriaceae to test the
   hypothesis that low diversity and possibly low pollinator service on
   islands would lead to a greater frequency of generalized
   plant-pollinator interactions and/or a higher potential for autonomous
   self-pollination in insular than in mainland species. We also assessed
   the hypothesis that epiphytic species should have greater autofertility
   than species occurring in other habitats. Pollinator observations
   conducted in the field from 2004 to 2014 revealed bat, bee, butterfly,
   hummingbird, moth, and generalized pollination systems. Functional
   specialization in pollination systems was high in insular (71\% of the
   species) and mainland sites (all species), but generalized and
   bat-pollinated species were more common on islands. Overall, pollinator
   visitation rates did not differ between island and mainland; however,
   for hummingbird-pollinated species, visitation rate was on average three
   times higher in mainland than island species. Autofertility indices
   (fruit set of bagged/outcross flowers) ranged from 0 to 1 and did not
   differ between island and mainland species. Species growing on rocks
   (rupiculous) and trees (epiphytic) had on average higher autofertility
   than terrestrial species.Synthesis. This study revealed that alternative
   reproductive strategies are used in pollinator-depauperate environments.
   Pollinator visitation is lower in insular hummingbird-pollinated species
   (the ancestral pollination system of insular Gesneriaceae); therefore,
   generalized pollination may be considered a reproductive assurance
   mechanism evolved primarily on island environments. Contrary to the
   long-standing tenet, however, autonomous self-pollination was similar in
   island and mainland Gesneriaceae suggesting that: (i) generalized
   pollination provides a viable alternative to selfing in
   pollinator-depauperate environments, (ii) autofertility as a
   reproductive assurance mechanism may be frequent in plant species from
   mainland regions in environments with unpredictable pollinator
   visitation and resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Bee populations and other pollinators face multiple, synergistically
   acting threats, which have led to population declines, loss of local
   species richness and pollination services, and extinctions. However, our
   understanding of the degree, distribution and causes of declines is
   patchy, in part due to inadequate monitoring systems, with the challenge
   of taxonomic identification posing a major logistical barrier.
   Pollinator conservation would benefit from a high-throughput
   identification pipeline.
   2. We show that the metagenomic mining and resequencing of mitochondrial
   genomes (mitogenomics) can be applied successfully to bulk samples of
   wild bees. We assembled the mitogenomes of 48 UK bee species and then
   shotgun-sequenced total DNA extracted from 204 whole bees that had been
   collected in 10 pan-trap samples from farms in England and been
   identified morphologically to 33 species. Each sample data set was
   mapped against the 48 reference mitogenomes.
   3. The morphological and mitogenomic data sets were highly congruent.
   Out of 63 total species detections in the morphological data set, the
   mitogenomic data set made 59 correct detections (93.7\% detection rate)
   and detected six more species (putative false positives). Direct
   inspection and an analysis with species-specific primers suggested that
   these putative false positives were most likely due to incorrect
   morphological IDs. Read frequency significantly predicted species
   biomass frequency (R-2 = 24.9\%). Species lists, biomass frequencies,
   extrapolated species richness and community structure were recovered
   with less error than in a metabarcoding pipeline.
   4. Mitogenomics automates the onerous task of taxonomic identification,
   even for cryptic species, allowing the tracking of changes in species
   richness and distributions. A mitogenomic pipeline should thus be able
   to contain costs, maintain consistently high-quality data over long time
   series, incorporate retrospective taxonomic revisions and provide an
   auditable evidence trail. Mitogenomic data sets also provide estimates
   of species counts within samples and thus have potential for tracking
   population trajectories.}},

Volume = {{166}},
Pages = {{50-60}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{We tested the suitability and accuracy of hyperspectral data to produce
   the first African flowering and short-term floral cycle map. The spatial
   distribution and abundance, as well as the floral cycle, of melliferous
   plants are of utmost importance for evaluating pollination effects and
   to understand the relationship between melliferous plants in the
   landscape and the quantity and quality of bee keeping products. For a
   study site in Kenya, airborne AISA/Eagle hyperspectral data with 60 cm
   pixel resolution (400 to 990 nm spectral ranges) was captured in January
   2014, at the beginning of the prime flowering period, and during the
   prime flowering period in February 2013. Aerial digital imagery with 10
   cm pixel size and Smartphone captures in the field were used for
   reference data collection. The flowering species were grouped into
   functional flowering plant groups. Linear spectral unmixing and Change
   Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to
   produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and
   short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies
   were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering
   period; all flowering plant groups together ({''}All{''}) could be
   mapped with an overall accuracy of 83\% (n = 512). The ``White forbs{''}
   flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle
   acquisition dates. Based on Duncan's inter-class similarity test, the
   ``White forbs{''} group was also most distinct from other flowering
   plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral
   endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring
   of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa. Floral cycle maps can help
   decision makers and bee keepers to understand how bee colonies interact
   with the floral environment and what to expect from an apiary in terms
   of honey flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees are important keystone pollinators from the Neotropics. With
   the aim to study the relationships between orchid bees and their nectar
   and aromatic host species, we made systematic samplings of males across
   two conservation areas in the biogeographic Choco Region of Colombia. We
   used chemical baits to collect 352 male bees during five months. The
   pollen attached to their bodies was extracted for palynological
   identification and to estimate interaction networks. The euglossine
   community consisted of at least 22 species including Eg. maculilabris,
   Eg. orellana, Eg. championi and Eg. ignita. The male bees were
   associated with 84 plants but depended on a small group of them
   (Peperomia spp. and Anthurium spp, as well as species of Solanaceae,
   Ericaceae and Malpighiaceae) which were widely distributed across the
   altitudinal gradient, and were available through the year. The resulting
   interaction networks revealed a typical nested pattern usually found in
   plant-pollinator interactions, with several rare bee and plant species
   interaction with a small group of generalist bees and plant species.
   Albeit, we found variation within networks related to species
   composition. Such variation may be a consequence of specific differences
   in plant flowering phenology.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of diploid males among 1457 individuals of different
   populations of six euglossine bee species (Eufriesea violacea, Eulaema
   cingulata, Euglossa annectans, Euglossa iopoecila, Euglossa pleosticta
   and Euglossa truncata) was investigated with microsatellite markers.
   Bees were surveyed in Atlantic Forest fragments showing different sizes
   and degrees of human interference. Our analyses revealed that, although
   the frequencies of diploid males remained below 10 \% for five out of
   six species studied, the frequencies of these males in three populations
   of Eg. annectans were above 15.0 \%. For this species, while the average
   estimate of diploid males was around 11.0 \%, the highest percentage (27
   \%) of such males was found for the population from an island. Our
   findings indicate that the frequency of diploid males can vary
   substantially among species and this fact should be taking into
   consideration in studies and conservation actions involving different
   euglossine bees.}},

Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a simple and solvent-free method using headspace
   solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed for determination of the volatile
   compounds from fresh flowers and nectar of male sterile and fertile
   lines of Allium cepa L. The SPME parameters were studied; the optimum
   conditions of 85 mu m carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (CAR/PDMS),
   extraction temperature of 30 degrees C and extraction time of 30 min
   were obtained. The analytical method was applied to characterize
   different onion lines according to the chemical composition of the
   volatile fraction of nectar and flowers. On the other hand, it was
   determined which odor components contribute to the pollination of onions
   lines and relate the content of specific analytes with foraging behavior
   and seed production. More than 90 compounds were identified. The samples
   studied showed differences in the volatile profiles of flowers and
   nectar among the different lines. The results demonstrated that
   headspace SPME-GCMS is a simple, rapid and solvent-free method suitable
   for analysis of volatile compounds emitted from onion plants.
   Furthermore, a great difference was found for the number of bee visits
   and seed yield among the onion lines analyzed. This study demonstrates
   that the combination of chemical information and statistical analysis is
   able to differentiate onion male sterile lines from fertile lines, as
   well as among male sterile lines. Repellent compounds, such as
   dioxolanes, piperidines and organosulfurs may contribute negatively to
   pollination, since the higher content of these analytes, the less bee
   visits and seed production yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{61-66}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{In a factorial field plot experiment, high and low levels of inorganic
   nitrogen and of insect pollinators visiting the crop were manipulated
   and their combined effects on oilseed rape yield were quantified. A
   third factor was also included, testing whether different cultivars
   responded differently to the tested factors. Insect pollination was
   required to reach high yield and seed quality (oil content). Final
   benefits of pollination service were, however, greatly modified by
   cultivar, where the seed yield of the open-pollinated cultivar largely
   depended on insect pollination whereas the two hybrid cultivars did not.
   A near significant interaction between nitrogen input and insect
   pollination was also found, i.e. benefits to crop yield from insect
   pollination seemed to increase with decreased nitrogen levels. The
   differential response of the three cultivars suggested opportunities to
   use cultivars that are less dependent on insect pollination in
   landscapes where this service has been deteriorated. Increased access of
   nitrogen seems to partly compensate yield losses from poor insect
   pollination. Integrating conservation, environmental and agronomic
   sciences is therefore crucial to sustain agriculture productions through
   optimized management of agronomic inputs and biodiversity-based
   ecosystem services. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   coatings on oilseed rape}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Chronic exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides has been linked to
   reduced survival of pollinating insects at both the individual and
   colony level, but so far only experimentally. Analyses of large-scale
   datasets to investigate the real-world links between the use of
   neonicotinoids and pollinator mortality are lacking. Moreover, the
   impacts of neonicotinoid seed coatings in reducing subsequent
   applications of foliar insecticide sprays and increasing crop yield are
   not known, despite the supposed benefits of this practice driving
   widespread use. Here, we combine large-scale pesticide usage and yield
   observations from oilseed rape with those detailing honey bee colony
   losses over an 11 year period, and reveal a correlation between honey
   bee colony losses and national-scale imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid)
   usage patterns across England and Wales. We also provide the first
   evidence that farmers who use neonicotinoid seed coatings reduce the
   number of subsequent applications of foliar insecticide sprays and may
   derive an economic return. Our results inform the societal discussion on
   the pollinator costs and farming benefits of prophylactic neonicotinoid
   usage on a mass flowering crop.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of natural disturbances and the homogenization of boreal forest

   by bilberry and lingonberry in Scots pine-dominated boreal forests.
   Shrub cover, flowering, berry yield and percent fruit set of both shrubs
   were measured and bees were sampled by pan-traps on 24 study sites 13
   years following a large-scale experiment, where RET (0, 10, 50 m(3)/ha
   and uncut forests) and fire (yes/no) were manipulated following a
   replicated factorial design. In general, bilberry performance and
   reproduction were higher at uncut sites, while lingonberly flowering was
   positively affected by fire and retention. Bee community composition was
   mainly determined by percentage of bare ground and number of logs within
   sites, both nesting resources largely determined by fire and retention.
   Burnt sites with retention trees serve as pollinator source habitats and

   Implications for Multiple Forest Use}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Although many examples of multiple-use forest management may be found in
   tropical smallholder systems, few studies provide empirical support for
   the integration of selective timber harvesting with non-timber forest
   product (NTFP) extraction. Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa,
   Lecythidaceae) is one of the world's most economically-important NTFP
   species extracted almost entirely from natural forests across the Amazon
   Basin. An obligate out-crosser, Brazil nut flowers are pollinated by
   large-bodied bees, a process resulting in a hard round fruit that takes
   up to 14 months to mature. As many smallholders turn to the financial
   security provided by timber, Brazil nut fruits are increasingly being
   harvested in logged forests. We tested the influence of tree and
   stand-level covariates (distance to nearest cut stump and local logging
   intensity) on total nut production at the individual tree level in five
   recently logged Brazil nut concessions covering about 4000 ha of forest
   in Madre de Dios, Peru. Our field team accompanied Brazil nut harvesters
   during the traditional harvest period (January-April 2012 and
   January-April 2013) in order to collect data on fruit production. Three
   hundred and ninety-nine (approximately 80\%) of the 499 trees included
   in this study were at least 100 m from the nearest cut stump, suggesting
   that concessionaires avoid logging near adult Brazil nut trees. Yet even
   for those trees on the edge of logging gaps, distance to nearest cut
   stump and local logging intensity did not have a statistically
   significant influence on Brazil nut production at the applied logging
   intensities (typically 1-2 timber trees removed per ha). In one
   concession where at least 4 trees ha-1 were removed, however, the

Abstract = {{Understanding how pollinator behavior may influence pollen transmission
   across floral types is a major challenge, as pollinator decision depends
   on a complex range of environmental cues and prior experience. Here we
   report an experiment using the plant Antirrhinum majus and the bumblebee
   Bombus terrestris to investigate how prior learning experience may
   affect pollinator preferences between floral types when these are
   presented together. We trained naive bumblebees to forage freely on
   flowering individuals of either A. majus pseudomajus (magenta flowers)
   or A. majus striatum (yellow flowers) in a flight cage. We then used a
   Y-maze device to expose trained bumblebees to a dual choice between the
   floral types. We tested the influence of training on their choice,
   depending on the type of plant signals available (visual signals,
   olfactory signals, or both). Bumblebees had no innate preference for
   either subspecies. Bumblebees trained on the yellow-flowered subspecies
   later preferred the yellow type, even when only visual or only olfactory
   signals were available, and their preference was not reinforced when
   both signal types were available. In contrast, bumblebees trained on the
   magenta-flowered subspecies showed no further preference between floral
   types and took slightly more time to make their choice. Since pollinator
   constancy has been observed in wild populations of A. majus with mixed
   floral types, we suggest that such constancy likely relies on short-term
   memory rather than acquired preference through long-term memory induced
   by prior learning.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{The interaction between floral oil secreting plants and oil-collecting
   bees is one of the most specialized of all pollination mutualisms. Yet,
   the specific stimuli used by the bees to locate their host flowers have
   remained elusive. This study identifies diacetin, a volatile acetylated
   glycerol, as a floral signal compound shared by unrelated oil plants
   from around the globe. Electrophysiological measurements of antennae and
   behavioural assays identified diacetin as the key volatile used by
   oil-collecting bees to locate their host flowers. Furthermore,
   electrophysiological measurements indicate that only oil-collecting bees
   are capable of detecting diacetin. The structural and obvious
   biosynthetic similarity between diacetin and associated floral oils make
   it a reliable cue for oil-collecting bees. It is easily perceived by oil
   bees, but can't be detected by other potential pollinators. Therefore,
   diacetin represents the first demonstrated private communication channel
   in a pollination system.}},

Title = {{Pollination Services of Mango Flower Pollinators}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{AUG 5}},
Abstract = {{Measuring wild pollinator services in agricultural production is very
   important in the context of sustainable management. In this study, we
   estimated the contribution of native pollinators to mango fruit set
   production of two mango cultivars Mangifera indica (L). cv. `Sala' and
   `Chok Anan'. Visitation rates of pollinators on mango flowers and number
   of pollen grains adhering to their bodies determined pollinator
   efficiency for reproductive success of the crop. Chok Anan failed to
   produce any fruit set in the absence of pollinators. In natural
   condition, we found that Sala produced 4.8\% fruit set per hermaphrodite
   flower while Chok Anan produced 3.1\% per flower. Hand pollination
   tremendously increased fruit set of naturally pollinated flower for Sala
   (>100\%), but only 33\% for Chok Anan. Pollinator contribution to mango
   fruit set was estimated at 53\% of total fruit set production. Our
   results highlighted the importance of insect pollinations in mango
   production. Large size flies Eristalinus spp. and Chrysomya spp. were
   found to be effective pollen carriers and visited more mango flowers
   compared with other flower visitors.}},

   human-altered and natural landscapes}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Global change has led to shifts in phenology, potentially disrupting
   species interactions such as plant-pollinator relationships. Advances in
   remote sensing techniques allow one to detect vegetation phenological
   diversity between different land use types, but it is not clear how this
   translates to other communities in the ecosystem. Here, we investigated
   the phenological diversity of the vegetation across a human-altered
   landscape including urban, agricultural, and natural land use types. We
   found that the patterns of change in the vegetation indices (EVI and
   NDVI) of human-altered landscapes are out of synchronization with the
   phenology in neighboring natural California grassland habitat. Comparing
   these findings to a spatio-temporal pollinator distribution dataset, EVI
   and NDVI were significant predictors of total bee abundance, a
   relationship that improved with time lags. This evidence supports the
   importance of differences in temporal dynamics between land use types.
   These findings also highlight the potential to utilize remote sensing
   data to make predictions for components of biodiversity that have tight
   vegetation associations, such as pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are important pollinators of flowering plants, foraging and
   providing pollination services throughout the growing season. They are
   adapted to cool temperatures and are among the most important of all
   pollinators at high elevations and northern latitudes. Over the past
   several decades, multiple species of bumble bees have experienced
   declines in both geographic range and abundance in Europe and North
   America, while 4 species of the genus Bombus (Bombus) have suffered
   dramatic declines in the United States. Such declines are not as evident
   in Alaska, and the status of Bombus remains relatively unknown in the
   adjacent territories of Canada. To begin addressing this knowledge gap,
   we sampled the bumble bee fauna foraging on floral patches along 5
   highways of Canada and southeastern Alaska in a short-term, one-time
   survey during late summer 2010. We observed 14 species and found Bombus
   assemblages to be structured by broad geographic features and
   ecoregions. The Bombus species B. (B.) occidentalis and B. (B.)
   terricola were relatively abundant in sample sites west and east of the
   Rocky Mountains, respectively, and B. (Pyrobombus) vagans, B.

   recognized by their tricolpate shape in polar view and oblate shape in
   equatorial view. Two species of syrphid flies in Copestylum were
   frequently aspirated and carried high P. fasciculata pollen loads and
   moderate proportions of conspecific pollen. High conspecific pollen
   loads on the tachinid Chaetogaedia also indicated potential for
   pollinating P. fasciculata. Three of the 4 species of Andrena bees
   carried large amounts of P. fasciculata pollen. Conspecific pollen also
   comprised most of the pollen load on Andrena bees, suggesting high
   flower constancies to the plant. Pollinators of P. fasciculata would
   vary over the plant's range, and likely between years, because of the
   localized populations or narrow larval diets of many of the insects
   collected from flowers. The female desert almond shrubs examined in
   southern Nevada during 2014 appeared to be pollinated by a variety of
   native flies and bees, especially syrphid flies in Copestylum and
   andrenid bees in Andrena.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting potential pollination services of wild bees in crops requires
   knowledge of their spatial distribution within fields. Field margins can
   serve as nesting and foraging habitats for wild bees and can be a source
   of pollinators. Regional differences in pollinator community composition
   may affect this spill-over of bees. We studied how regional and local
   differences affect the spatial distribution of wild bee species
   richness, activity-density and body size in crop fields. We sampled bees
   both from the field centre and at two different types of semi-natural
   field margins, grass strips and hedges, in 12 strawberry fields. The
   fields were distributed over four regions in Northern Europe,
   representing an almost 1100 km long north-south gradient. Even over this
   gradient, daytime temperatures during sampling did not differ
   significantly between regions and did therefore probably not impact bee
   activity. Bee species richness was higher in field margins compared with
   field centres independent of field size. However, there was no
   difference between centre and margin in body-size or activity-density.
   In contrast, bee activity-density increased towards the southern
   regions, whereas the mean body size increased towards the north. In
   conclusion, our study revealed a general pattern across European regions
   of bee diversity, but not activity-density, declining towards the field
   interior which suggests that the benefits of functional diversity of
   pollinators may be difficult to achieve through spillover effects from
   margins to crop. We also identified dissimilar regional patterns in bee
   diversity and activity-density, which should be taken into account in
   conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Population density may affect solitary bee maternal resource allocation.
   The number of Megachile rotundata (F.), alfalfa leafcutting bee, females
   released for seed production of Medicago sativa L., alfalfa, may limit
   flower availability for nest provisioning. In turn, pollinator abundance
   also may affect crop yield. The M. sativa pollination system presents an
   opportunity to test for effects of density dependence and maternal
   manipulation on M. rotundata reproduction. A multiyear study was
   performed on M. sativa fields upon which M. rotundata densities were
   altered to induce low, medium, and high density situations. Numbers of
   adult bees and open flowers were recorded weekly; bee reproduction
   variables were collected once. Fields varied in plant performance for
   each site and year, and the intended bee densities were not realized.
   Therefore, the variable density index (DI) was derived to describe the
   number of female bees per area of flowers over the study period. As DI
   increased, percentages of pollinated flowers, established females, and
   healthy brood significantly increased, and the number of pollinated
   flowers per female and of dead or diseased brood significantly
   decreased. Sex ratio was significantly more female biased as DI
   increased. Overwintered offspring weights were similar regardless of DI,
   but significantly differed by year for both sexes, and for males also by
   field and year x field interaction. Overall, resource limitation was not
   found in this field study. Other density-dependent factors may have
   induced a bee dispersal response soon after bees were released in the
   fields that circumvented the need for, or impact of, maternal
   manipulation.}},

Title = {{Climate Warming May Threaten Reproductive Diapause of a Highly Eusocial
   Bee}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY}},

Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Climate changes are predicted to affect the diapause of many insect
   species around the world adversely. In this context, bees are of
   interest due to their pollination services. In southern Brazil, the
   highly eusocial bee species Plebeia droryana (Friese) (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae: Meliponini) exhibits reproductive diapause in response to the
   region's rigorous winters. That diapause is characterized by a temporary
   interruption in brood cell construction by nurse bees and egg-laying by
   the queen, regardless of other internal tasks underway in the nests. In
   this study, we evaluated whether P. droryana enter diapause under
   experimental conditions. P. droryana colonies were kept in a germination
   chamber, and the temperature was progressively reduced from 20 degrees C
   over a period of a few weeks until diapause was detected. Additionally,
   we also estimated the environmental conditions in the actual geographic
   range occupied by P. droryana and modeled it for predicted changes in
   climate up to the year 2080. Our findings indicate that P. droryana
   enter diapause between 10 and 8 degrees C. We also found that the
   current minimum winter temperature (10.1 degrees C, median) in the
   distributional range of P. droryana will probably rise (13.4 degrees C,
   median). Thus, if our experimental data are somewhat accurate, similar
   to 36\% of the southern Brazilian P. droryana population may be active
   during the expected milder winter months in 2080. In this scenario,
   there may be a larger demand for pollen and nectar for that bee species.
   Greater conservation efforts will be required to preserve P. droryana
   populations and keep them viable in the coming decades.}},

Abstract = {{The family Orchidaceae exhibits some of the most diverse and intricate
   modes of animal pollination across angiosperms. Highly specialized
   pollination by male euglossine bees (Apidae, Euglossini) occurs in more
   than 600 species of Neotropical orchids. Male euglossine bees acquire
   volatile compounds from both floral and nonfloral sources, which they
   store in their specialized hind tibiae and later expose during courtship
   display. Euglossine-pollinated Orchidaceae produce large quantities of
   floral scent, which serves as both the attractant and reward for male
   euglossine bees. Upon collecting floral volatiles and aided by the
   intricate orchid floral morphology, male bees remove and subsequently
   deposit orchid pollinaria, resulting in pollination. Among
   euglossine-pollinated Orchidaceae is the species-rich genus Gongora Ruiz
   \& Pav., which provides exceptional opportunities to investigate the
   evolution of scent-mediated pollinator specialization. Here we review
   the taxonomy, systematics, and pollination biology of Gongora. We also
   describe a new physical mechanism of pollination observed for Gongora
   and discuss the significance of different modes of pollinaria attachment
   in an evolutionary framework. This work provides the foundation for
   future research on the evolution of specialized plant pollinator
   mutualisms, including elucidating the evolutionary relationships of
   cryptic species, understanding the evolution of floral adaptations, and
   investigating the mechanisms of speciation.}},

Volume = {{186}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Although many angiosperms are serviced by flying pollinators, reports of
   wings as pollen vectors are rare. Flame azalea (Rhododendron
   calendulaceum) is visited by diverse insects, yet previous observations
   suggested that only butterfly wings may transfer pollen to stigmas. We
   used an experimental approach to determine whether butterfly wings are
   the primary vehicle of pollination in flame azalea. Over two seasons of
   observations, only butterflies (Papilio glaucus and Speyeria cybele)
   contacted both anthers and stigmas, yet because of differences in
   wing-flapping behavior, P. glaucus transferred pollen most efficiently.
   In contrast, bee species specialized either on pollen or nectar but did
   not contact both anthers and stigmas. A field experiment revealed that
   flowers excluding butterflies experienced almost complete fruit failure,
   whereas fruit set in open flowers did not differ from those that were
   hand pollinated. Additionally, butterflies had 56-fold more azalea
   pollen on their wings than bodies, while azalea stigmas bore both pollen
   and wing scales. These results suggest that plants with many visitors
   contacting reproductive organs may still specialize on a single guild of
   visitors for pollination and that wing-borne pollen transfer is a key
   mode of flame azalea pollination.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Extremely long proboscides of insect flower visitors have been regarded
   as an example of a coevolutionary arms race, assuming that these insects
   act as efficient pollinators for their nectar host plants. However, the
   effect of proboscis length on generalized or specialized flower use
   remains unclear and the efficiency of butterfly pollination is
   ambiguous. Neotropical Hesperiidae feature a surprising variation of
   proboscis length, which makes them a suitable study system to elucidate
   the role of extremely long-proboscid insects in plant-pollinator
   networks. The results of this study show that skippers with longer
   proboscides visit plant species with deep-tubed flowers to take up food,
   but do not pollinate them. Skippers equipped with extremely long
   proboscides seldom include short-tubed flowers in their diet nor visit
   more plant species than those with shorter proboscides. Our observations
   indicate that the extremely long-proboscid skippers steal nectar from
   their preferred nectar host plants, Calathea sp., instead of
   contributing to their pollination. Finally, we discuss the impact of
   nectar robbery by these butterflies on their nectar host plants and
   their legitimate pollinators, euglossine bees.}},

Abstract = {{Morphology-based studies have suggested a very depauperate bee fauna for
   islands in the South West Pacific, and recent genetic studies since have
   indicated an even smaller endemic fauna with many bee species in this
   region resulting from human-aided dispersal. These introduced species
   have the potential to both disrupt native pollinator suites as well as
   augment crop pollination, but for most species the timings of
   introduction are unknown. We examined the distribution and nesting
   biology of the long-tongued bee Braunsapis puangensis that was first
   recorded from Fiji in 2007. This bee has now become widespread in Fiji
   and both its local abundance and geographical range are likely to
   increase dramatically. The impacts of this invasion are potentially
   enormous for agriculture and native ecosystems, but they also provide
   opportunities for understanding how social insect species adapt to new
   environments. We outline the major issues associated with this recent
   invasion and argue that a long-term monitoring study is needed.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Some plant species have flowers that open widely and then close slowly
   over time, resulting in changes in the width of the corolla opening. We
   examined the adaptive significance of retaining flowers with relatively
   closed corollas using Gentiana triflora var. japonica, a perennial
   species with petal movement, in Hakkoda, northern Japan. Under open
   pollination, floral openness changed with floral age. It increased from
   days 1-3 after the flower initially opened and decreased thereafter
   until floral senescence. Hand-pollinated flowers showed a significant
   reduction in floral openness compared with unpollinated flowers,
   suggesting that a floral openness reflects its demand for pollination.
   Pollinators visited inflorescences with many flowers irrespective of
   their openness, suggesting that the reduction in floral openness does
   not affect the attractiveness of the inflorescences to pollinators.
   Within inflorescences, pollinators visited less-pollinated flowers with
   wider floral openness more frequently and more-pollinated flowers with
   lower floral openness less frequently, possibly because of the time cost
   of entering flowers with low openness. This strategy appears adaptive
   because if all flowers maintain wide floral openness irrespective of
   their pollination demand, pollinators may visit more-pollinated flowers
   in an inflorescence and may leave the inflorescence without visiting
   less-pollinated flowers. Reduction of openness of more-pollinated
   flowers fits a strategy of enhancing effective pollination within
   inflorescences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic change can have large impacts on wild bees and the
   pollination services they provide. However, the overall pattern of wild
   bee response to drivers such as land-use change, pesticides, pathogens,
   and climate change has been one of variability in both the magnitude and
   directionality of responses. We argue that two causes contribute to this
   variation. First, different species exhibit differential responses to
   the same anthropogenic drivers. Second, these anthropogenic drivers vary
   in type and magnitude that will drive variation in bee responses. For
   this second issue, we focus on land-use change, the most well-studied
   driver. We conclude by discussing how understanding species-level
   responses and the magnitude of land-use change can make bee conservation
   more effective.}},

Abstract = {{Bee-population declines are linked to nutritional shortages caused by
   land-use intensification, which reduces diversity and abundance of
   host-plant species. Bees require nectar and pollen floral resources that
   provide necessary carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and micronutrients
   for survival, reproduction, and resilience to stress. However, nectar
   and pollen nutritional quality varies widely among host-plant species,
   which in turn influences how bees forage to obtain their nutritionally
   appropriate diets. Unfortunately, we know little about the nutritional
   requirements of different bee species. Research must be conducted on bee
   species nutritional needs and host-plant species resource quality to
   develop diverse and nutritionally balanced plant communities. Restoring

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{864-875}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{AimThere is widespread concern over the current state of global
   pollinator populations; however, lack of monitoring means patterns of
   decline are not well characterized. We aimed to investigate the
   influence of habitat and climate specializations on bumblebee
   distribution trends over time using long-term species data.
   LocationOur study is based on data from the UK and Ireland, for which
   the most comprehensive set of bumblebee records exists. Previous
   analysis of theUK data highlighted severe range contractions for a
   number of species by the 1980s.
   MethodsWe use the most current dataset to quantify the extent of range
   change over three time periods (pre-1960, 1960-80 and 1981-2012) and to
   investigate whether species are becoming more marginal, that is
   occupying areas with more extreme or specialized climatic conditions
   within the UK and Ireland. For species that have contracted or become
   more marginal, we predict their climatic specialization within the UK
   and Ireland using Maxent models, allowing us to associate records with
   climatic suitability values for each time period and to investigate
   whether or not species are contracting towards their climatic optimum.
   ResultsWe find that populations of most rare bumblebee species appear to
   have stabilized post-1980, while the more common species appear to have
   expanded in range. However, rare species tend to have become more
   marginal in the sites they occupy post-1980, some have contracted
   towards their predicted climatic optimum and some of which also
   retracted towards coastal areas.
   Main conclusionsOur results provide a mixed picture of the state of the
   UK and Ireland's bumblebee fauna, and must be interpreted with caution
   as changing patterns of recorder effort may distort real trends. They
   highlight the need for future monitoring of the abundance of pollinators
   on both a regional and global scale.}},

Abstract = {{1. Changes to plant community composition after invasion are well
   documented but how these shifts directly affect higher trophic levels is
   still poorly understood. One potentially important factor is the change
   in nutritional availability after an invasion. Shifts in nutrient
   availability could affect the nutrient intake of organisms that live in
   invaded habitats, causing reduced fecundity and survival. 2. The effects
   of the interaction among nutrient availability, selection, and diet on
   nutrient intake of a native bumble bee were examined. No nutritional
   differences were found between exotic and native pollen or collected and
   non-collected pollen in protein or amino acid content, suggesting that
   differences in nutrient intake from random are based on selection. 3.
   Nutrient intake was simulated when pollen was selected randomly across
   all available plant species and when selection was restricted to native
   plants only or exotic plants only using a permutation model and compared
   with observed collection. The results suggest that pollen collection is
   non-random and that selecting only native or exotic plants cannot
   provide the protein or amino acid intake observed. 4. These results may
   help to explain why the responses of native bees to exotic plants are so
   variable. If the exotic plants in a community can supply the necessary
   nutrients, bees may readily incorporate them into their diets, but if
   not, exotic plants may be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees provide a free and potentially diverse ecosystem service to
   farmers growing pollination-dependent crops. While many crops benefit
   from insect pollination, soft fruit crops, including strawberries are
   highly dependent on this ecosystem service to produce viable fruit.
   However, as a result of intensive farming practices and declining
   pollinator populations, farmers are increasingly turning to commercially
   reared bees to ensure that crops are adequately pollinated throughout
   the season. Wildflower strips are a commonly used measure aimed at the
   conservation of wild pollinators. It has been suggested that commercial
   crops may also benefit from the presence of noncrop flowers; however,
   the efficacy and economic benefits of sowing flower strips for crops
   remain relatively unstudied. In a study system that utilizes both wild
   and commercial pollinators, we test whether wildflower strips increase
   the number of visits to adjacent commercial strawberry crops by
   pollinating insects. We quantified this by experimentally sowing
   wildflower strips approximately 20 meters away from the crop and
   recording the number of pollinator visits to crops with, and without,
   flower strips. Between June and August 2013, we walked 292 crop
   transects at six farms in Scotland, recording a total of 2826
   pollinators. On average, the frequency of pollinator visits was 25\%
   higher for crops with adjacent flower strips compared to those without,
   with a combination of wild and commercial bumblebees (Bombus spp.)
   accounting for 67\% of all pollinators observed. This effect was
   independent of other confounding effects, such as the number of flowers
   on the crop, date, and temperature. Synthesis and applications. This
   study provides evidence that soft fruit farmers can increase the number
   of pollinators that visit their crops by sowing inexpensive flower seed
   mixes nearby. By investing in this management option, farmers have the
   potential to increase and sustain pollinator populations over time.}},

Abstract = {{An increasing degree of attention is being given to the ecosystem
   services which insect pollinators supply, and the economic value of
   these services. Recent research suggests that a range of factors are
   contributing to a global decline in pollination services, which are
   often used as a ``headline{''} ecosystem service in tel of communicating
   the concept of ecosystem services, and how this ties peoples' wellbeing
   to the condition of ecosystems and the biodiversity found therein. Our
   paper offers a conceptual framework for measuring the economic value of
   changes in insect pollinator populations, and then reviews what evidence
   exists on the empirical magnitude of these values (both market and
   non-market). This allows us to highlight where the largest gaps in
   knowledge are, where the greatest conceptual and empirical challenges
   remain, and where research is most needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Insect-mediated pollination is critical for lowbush blueberry
   (Ericaceae: Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) fruit development. Past
   research shows a persistent presence of wild bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea)
   providing pollination services even when commercial pollinators are
   present. We undertook the study to 1) provide a description of bee
   communities found in lowbush blueberry-growing regions, 2) identify
   field characteristics or farm management practices that influence those
   communities, 3) identify key wild bee pollinators that provide
   pollination services for the blueberry crop, and 4) identify non-crop
   plants found within the cropping system that provide forage for wild
   bees. During a 4-year period, we collected solitary and eusocial bees in
   over 40 fields during and after blueberry bloom, determining a
   management description for each field. We collected 4,474 solitary bees
   representing 124 species and 1,315 summer bumble bees representing nine
   species. No bumble bee species were previously unknown in Maine, yet we
   document seven solitary bee species new for the state. These include
   species of the genera Nomada, Lasioglossum, Calliopsis, and
   Augochloropsis. No field characteristic or farm management practice
   related to bee community structure, except bumble bee species richness
   was higher in certified organic fields. Pollen analysis determined
   scopal loads of 67-99\% ericaceous pollen carried by five species of
   Andrena. Our data suggest two native ericaceous plants, Kalmia
   angustifolia L. and Gaylussacia baccata (Wangenheim), provide important
   alternative floral resources. We conclude that Maine blueberry croplands
   are populated with a species-rich bee community that fluctuates in time
   and space. We suggest growers develop and maintain wild bee forage and
   nest sites.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{634-641}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important as pollinators of
   crop and wild plants, especially in temperate systems. Species, such as
   the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), are reared commercially
   to pollinate high-value crops. Their highly specific gut microbiota,
   characterized by low diversity, may affect nutrition and immunity and
   are likely to be important for fitness and colony health. However,
   little is known about how environmental factors affect bacterial
   community structure. We analysed the gut microbiota from three groups of
   worker bumblebees (B.terrestris) from distinct colonies that varied in
   rearing and foraging characteristics: commercially reared with
   restricted foraging (RR); commercially reared with outside foraging
   (RF); and wild-caught workers (W). Contrary to previous studies, which
   indicate that bacterial communities are highly conserved across workers,
   we found that RF individuals had an intermediate community structure
   compared with RR and W types. Further, this was shaped by differences in
   the abundances of common operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the
   diversity of rare OTUs present, which we propose results from an
   increase in the variety of carbohydrates obtained through foraging.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators face many challenges within agricultural systems due to
   landscape changes and intensification which can affect resource
   availability that can impact pollination services. This paper examines
   pigeon pea pollination and considers how landscape context and
   agricultural intensification in terms of pesticide use affects the
   abundance of bees characterized by species guilds on crops. The study
   was conducted on six paired farms across a gradient of habitat
   complexity based on the distance of each farm from adjacent semi-natural
   vegetation in Kibwezi Sub-county, Kenya. The study found that farms
   which do not use insecticides in farm management, but are in close
   proximity to natural habitat have greater bee guild abundance, but at
   further distances, overall abundance is reduced with or without
   insecticide use. At 1 km landscape radius, the complexity of habitats
   but not patch size had a positive impact on the abundance of cavity
   nesting bees and mason bees, which can be attributed to the
   interspersion of the small-holder farms with semi-natural habitats
   across the landscapes producing mosaics of heterogeneous habitats. The
   study revealed the strongest relationships between fruit set and bee
   abundance to be with the carpenter bee, social bee and solitary bee
   guilds, which are among the most abundant bees visiting pigeon pea
   flowers in this system. Our findings provide the foundation for
   conservation efforts by identifying which bee guilds pollinated pigeon
   peas. From this study, we suggest managing the floral and nesting
   resources that would best support the most abundant crop pollinators,
   and also reducing insecticide application to the crop.}},

   communities in intensively managed grasslands}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The resilience of ecosystems depends on the diversity of species and
   their specific responses to environmental variation. Here we show that
   the diversity of climatic responses across species contributes to a
   higher projected resilience of species-rich pollinator communities in
   real-world ecosystems despite land-use intensification. We determined
   the thermal niche of 511 pollinator species (flies, bees, beetles and
   butterflies) in 40 grasslands. Species in intensively used grasslands
   have broader thermal niches and are also more complementary in their
   thermal optima. The observed increase in thermal resilience with
   land-use intensification is mainly driven by the dominant flies that
   prefer cooler temperatures and compensate for losses of other taxa.
   Temperature explained 84\% of the variation in pollinator activity
   across species and sites. Given the key role of temperature, quantifying
   the diversity of thermal responses within functional groups is a
   promising approach to assess the vulnerability of ecosystems to land-use
   intensification and climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of bumblebees in Europe has been linked primarily to
   agricultural intensification, although climate change also has the
   potential to disrupt plant-pollinator interactions, partly through an
   increased frequency of extreme short-term weather events. There have
   been few attempts to use time-series models to determine meteorological
   variables affecting forager activity at hourly time periods over several
   months. Time-series models require large datasets to be reliable. We
   describe the use of infrared detectors at nest entrances to record
   forager exits/returns from 36 captive colonies of Bombus terrestris
   audax on a mixed farm in northern England, recording over a 78-day
   period. Over 1.73million individual records of forager activity were
   obtained. These were aggregated into 1872 hourly blocks and analyzed
   with autoregressive time-series models that used nine meteorological
   factors as explanatory variables. Forager activity was positively linked
   to air temperature and solar elevation, and negatively associated with
   rainfall, humidity and wind-speed. The effects of increased variability
   in meteorological conditions are considered in the context of these
   results. The time-series models that we describe will be useful in
   future analyses of the large datasets of foraging behaviour that are
   becoming available through new technologies such as radio-frequency
   identification and video tracking.}},

Abstract = {{To understand how habitat management influences agricultural production,
   the present study investigated whether the vicinity of mixed (six annual
   herbaceous species) or monospecific (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) floral
   margins can improve seed production in coriander. Potted coriander
   plants under field conditions were used to test: (i) the contribution of
   insect pollination (open versus bagged umbels) to coriander seed
   production and (ii) the contribution of floral margins (mixed or
   monospecific) to pollinator visitation to coriander. Although coriander
   showed the capacity to self-pollinate, bagged umbels (no insect
   pollination) produced significantly less seeds than open-pollinated
   coriander umbels. In the vicinity of floral margins (mixed or
   monospecific), coriander plants were more frequently visited by
   pollinators than control plants (no margins), which consequently
   improved seed production and quality (seed weight and germination rate).
   Finally, the present study showed that the presence of both mixed and
   monospecific margins can improve the production of coriander seeds by
   more than 220\% and, in addition, conserve local pollinators within
   agro-ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{1. The introduction of livestock in natural areas is a common
   disturbance that affects both plant and pollinator diversity and might
   affect their interaction. Understanding whether livestock affect a food
   resource for pollinators (i.e. flower abundance) and/or a pollinator
   assemblage (i.e. abundance and richness) has important implications for
   plant-pollinator interactions and still needs deeper investigation. 2.
   This study investigated how pollinator communities and flower abundance
   determined floral visitation frequency along a grazing gradient, using
   seven large paddocks in Patagonian Monte Desert that varied in livestock
   densities. Pollinator visitation frequency was measured in five of the
   most abundant native plant species of the region, present in all the
   paddocks, but that differed in reproductive strategy ranging from
   insect-pollinated self-compatible and self-incompatible to
   wind-pollinated. The influence of livestock density, insect, and flower
   abundance on visitation frequency was evaluated using D-separation
   hierarchical path models. 3. Intermediate stocking densities showed the
   highest insect richness and abundance. Livestock density showed a
   negative quadratic relationship with insect richness; hymenopterans
   being the main insect group in the region. Flower density decreased with
   the increase in livestock density. The five plant species shared several
   pollinator species although each one supported a distinct assemblage. 4.
   The path model showed that livestock was not directly associated with
   pollinator visitation frequency; however, this apparent lack of
   association was as a result of opposite forces acting together. An
   increase in livestock density reduced visitation frequency through a
   decrease in insect abundance, yet, livestock simultaneously increased
   the pollinator visitation rate through decreased flower abundance. 5.
   This study describes how changes in the density of exotic mammals can
   affect pollinator and flower abundance, resulting in contrasting effects
   on flower visitation rates with, apparently, neutral net consequences.
   This illustrates the complexity of responses to plant-pollinator
   interactions to anthropogenic disturbances that alter the ecological
   context.}},

Title = {{Pollination biology in the dioecious orchid Catasetum uncatum: How does
   floral scent influence the behaviour of pollinators?}},
Journal = {{PHYTOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{149-161}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Catasetum is a neotropical orchid genus that comprises about 160
   dioecious species with a remarkable sexual dimorphism in floral
   morphology. Flowers of Catasetum produce perfumes as rewards, which are
   collected only by male euglossine bees. Currently, floral scents are
   known to be involved in the selective attraction of specific euglossine
   species. However, sexual dimorphism in floral scent and its eventual
   role in the pollination of Catasetum species have never been
   investigated. Here, we have investigated the pollination of Catasetum
   uncatum and asked: (1) Is floral scent a sexual dimorphic trait? (2)
   Does pollinarium removal/deposition affect scent emission? (3) Does
   sexual dimorphism in floral scent and changed Scent emission have
   implications with regard to the behaviour of the pollinators? The
   frequency and behaviour of floral visitors were observed in
   non-manipulated flowers (both flower sexes) and in manipulated flowers
   (pistillate only) in which pollinaria were deposited. Scents of
   staminate and pistillate flowers (both manipulated and non-manipulated)
   were collected by using dynamic headspace methods and analysed
   chemically. Electrophysiological analyses were performed to detect
   compounds triggering antennal depolarisation in the euglossine species.
   C. uncatum is pollinated mainly by males of Euglossa nanomelanotricha.
   Pollinators were more frequent in pistillate than in staminate
   inflorescences. Bees approaching staminate flowers frequently flew away
   without visiting them, a behavioural pattern not observed in pistillate
   flowers. In the chemical analyses, we recorded 99 compounds, 31 of which
   triggered antennal depolarisation in pollinators. Multivariate analyses
   with the electrophysiological-active compounds did not detect
   differences between the scent composition of staminate and pistillate
   flowers. Pollinarium removal or deposition resulted in diminished scent
   emission within 24 h in staminate and pistillate flowers, respectively.
   Surprisingly, bees discriminated pollinated from non-pollinated
   pistillate flowers as early as 2 h after pollination. The rapid loss in
   the attractiveness of flowers following pollinarium removal/deposition
   can be interpreted as a strategy to direct pollinators to nonpollinated
   flowers. We have found no evidence that euglossine males discriminate
   staminate from pistillate flowers by means of floral scent. Instead, we
   speculate that bees use visual cues, such as sex dimorphic traits, to
   discriminate flowers of different sexes. Together, our results provide
   interesting insights into the evolution of floral signals in
   gender-dimorphic species and into its significance in plant reproductive
   biology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Partamona rustica is a stingless bee that occupies dry forests of
   Brazil, such as the cerrado (savanna-like biome) and caatinga (xeric
   shrubland and thorn forest), ranging from the northern portion of the
   state of Minas Gerais to the southwestern portion of the Bahia state. As
   this bee is endemic to these environments and its biology is poorly
   known, the aim of the present study was to investigate aspects of its
   natural history and biogeography. Moreover, the potential distribution
   of the species is analyzed through ecological niche modeling. Sampling
   was performed in the full range of distribution of the species. Nesting
   sites for 145 colonies, plants visited, and termite nests hosts were
   identified. Most of the termite nests in which the species nested were
   active (83 \%) and corresponded to Constrictotermes cyphergaster. Pollen
   analyses revealed 62 pollen types from 30 families of angiosperms
   visited by P. rustica, the most common of which were from the families
   Leguminosae-Mimosoideae (11.1 \%) and Myrtaceae (7.9 \%). Partamona
   rustica occurs in areas at 500 +/- A 187.30 m above sea level with
   semi-arid climates. The climatic niche model revealed a very realistic
   range for P. rustica, contouring the Chapada Diamantina National Park by
   the east, where there are no records of the species. Given the
   ecological importance of bees as pollinators, the intense pressure
   exerted by bee hunters and environmental changes caused by human
   activities, the present findings underscore the importance of
   concentrating efforts on the conservation of dry areas and the endemic
   species that inhabit these forests.}},

Title = {{Increased Acetylcholinesterase Expression in Bumble Bees During
   Neonicotinoid-Coated Corn Sowing}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{While honey bee exposure to systemic insecticides has received much
   attention, impacts on wild pollinators have not been as widely studied.
   Neonicotinoids have been shown to increase acetylcholinesterase (AChE)
   activity in honey bees at sublethal doses. High AChE levels may
   therefore act as a biomarker of exposure to neonicotinoids. This
   two-year study focused on establishing whether bumble bees living and
   foraging in agricultural areas using neonicotinoid crop protection show
   early biochemical signs of intoxication. Bumble bee colonies (Bombus
   impatiens) were placed in two different agricultural cropping areas: 1)
   control (>= 3 km from fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated seeds)
   or 2) exposed (within 500 m of fields planted with neonicotinoid-treated
   seeds), and maintained for the duration of corn sowing. As determined by
   Real Time qPCR, AChE mRNA expression was initially significantly higher
   in bumble bees from exposed sites, then decreased throughout the
   planting season to reach a similar endpoint to that of bumble bees from
   control sites. These findings suggest that exposure to neonicotinoid
   seed coating particles during the planting season can alter bumble bee
   neuronal activity. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report
   in situ that bumble bees living in agricultural areas exhibit signs of
   neonicotinoid intoxication.}},

Abstract = {{Untrained, ``flower-naive{''} bumblebees display behavioural preferences
   when presented with visual properties such as colour, symmetry, spatial
   frequency and others. Two unsupervised neural networks were implemented
   to understand the extent to which these models capture elements of
   bumblebees' unlearned visual preferences towards flower-like visual
   properties. The computational models, which are variants of Independent
   Component Analysis and Feature-Extracting Bidirectional Associative
   Memory, use images of test-patterns that are identical to ones used in
   behavioural studies. Each model works by decomposing images of floral
   patterns into meaningful underlying factors. We reconstruct the original
   floral image using the components and compare the quality of the
   reconstructed image to the original image. Independent Component
   Analysis matches behavioural results substantially better across several
   visual properties. These results are interpreted to support a hypothesis
   that the temporal and energetic costs of information processing by
   pollinators served as a selective pressure on floral displays: flowers
   adapted to pollinators' cognitive constraints.}},

Title = {{Increased efficiency in identifying mixed pollen samples by
   meta-barcoding with a dual-indexing approach}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Meta-barcoding of mixed pollen samples constitutes a
   suitable alternative to conventional pollen identification via light
   microscopy. Current approaches however have limitations in
   practicability due to low sample throughput and/or inefficient
   processing methods, e.g. separate steps for amplification and sample
   indexing.
   Results: We thus developed a new primer-adapter design for high
   throughput sequencing with the Illumina technology that remedies these
   issues. It uses a dual-indexing strategy, where sample-specific
   combinations of forward and reverse identifiers attached to the barcode
   marker allow high sample throughput with a single sequencing run. It
   does not require further adapter ligation steps after amplification. We
   applied this protocol to 384 pollen samples collected by solitary bees
   and sequenced all samples together on a single Illumina MiSeq v2 flow
   cell. According to rarefaction curves, 2,000-3,000 high quality reads
   per sample were sufficient to assess the complete diversity of 95\% of
   the samples. We were able to detect 650 different plant taxa in total,
   of which 95\% were classified at the species level. Together with the
   laboratory protocol, we also present an update of the reference database
   used by the classifier software, which increases the total number of
   covered global plant species included in the database from 37,403 to
   72,325 (93\% increase).
   Conclusions: This study thus offers improvements for the laboratory and
   bioinformatical workflow to existing approaches regarding data quantity
   and quality as well as processing effort and cost-effectiveness.
   Although only tested for pollen samples, it is furthermore applicable to
   other research questions requiring plant identification in mixed and
   challenging samples.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{348}},

Abstract = {{Two conservation goals of the early 20th century, extensive
   reforestation and reduced wildfire through fire exclusion, may have
   contributed to declining pollinator abundance as forests became denser
   and shrub covered. To examine how forest structure affects bees we
   selected 5 stands in each of 7 forest types including: cleared forest;
   dense young pines; thinned young pines; mature open pine with extensive
   shrub/sapling cover; mature open pine with extensive herbaceous plant
   cover and little shrub cover; mature upland hardwood forest; and mature
   riparian hardwood forest. We sampled bees during the 2008 growing season
   using pan traps and measured overstory tree density, understory
   herbaceous plant and shrub diversity and cover, light penetration, and
   leaf area index. Numbers of bees and numbers of species per plot were
   highest in cleared forest and in mature pine stands with an herbaceous
   plant understory. Estimates of asymptotic species richness were highest
   in mature riparian hardwood forests, cleared forests and open pine
   forests with an herbaceous plant understory. Bee communities in the
   cleared forests and in the mature pine with an herbaceous plant
   understory were grouped together in ordination space which was
   consistent with perMANOVA results. The best predictor variable for bee
   species density was total tree basal area which was negatively
   correlated (r(2) = 0.58), while the best model for predicting bee
   abundance (r(2) = 0.62) included canopy openness, plant species density
   (both positively correlated) and shrub cover (negatively correlated).
   Our results combined with many others show that thinning forests
   combined with shrub control provides good bee habitat, is compatible
   with habitat restoration and management for other species, and the
   resulting forests will be healthier and less susceptible to old (e.g.,
   southern pine beetle, Dendrocronus frontalis) and new (European
   woodwasp, Sirex noctilio) threats. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Flowers attract and guide pollinators via a wide array of sensory
   stimuli, including colors, odors, textures, and even sounds. Bees are
   known to respond to and learn multimodal and multicomponent floral cues,
   whereas, historically, studies of learning in butterflies have focused
   on a single visual stimulus component, most often color. In this study,
   we examine whether Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.) can learn
   to associate a compound visual stimulus, i.e., color and shape together,
   with a nectar reward. We also examine the relative importance of color
   and shape as cues for foraging butterflies. Our results indicate that
   within the visual modality, foraging Monarchs learn color more readily
   than shape. Monarchs, however, are capable of learning to associate
   shape with a sugar reward independent of color, and they may also be
   capable of learning the compound stimulus of color and shape in the
   context of foraging. We suggest that the hierarchical importance of cues
   is likely to vary depending on ecological context, and that although
   color may be most relevant for a nectar-foraging butterfly, shape may be
   a more useful cue for a butterfly searching for an oviposition
   substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Historical and recent studies of Boulder County, Colorado (USA) bees
   (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) illustrate the potential and the pitfalls of
   using comparative collection data to evaluate faunal composition and
   change over time. A compilation of bee records from Boulder County
   (Scott et al. 2011) is used as a basis for re-examining the comparison
   of an historical data set (Cockerell 1907) with a recent one (Kearns and
   Oliveras 2009a, b). Despite numerical comparability reported by Kearns
   and Oliveras, the taxonomic and behavioral composition of these data
   sets differ markedly from each other and, in different ways, from that
   of the subset of bee species common to both and from the total fauna
   documented from Boulder County. The rank order of species richness
   across bee families and across cohorts of bees with different social
   behaviors and feeding preferences do not covary among data sets:
   taxonomically, colletids, andrenids and megachilids are relatively
   under-represented in the more recent data set, in which halictids are
   better represented than any other family. Behaviorally, parasitic and
   oligolectic solitary species are less well represented in both datasets,
   the paucity of Andrena Fabricius spp. being especially conspicuous in
   the more recent of the two, which is dominated by polylectic social
   bees. Ensemble comparisons of raw species richness may mask differences
   in the readiness with which bees with different taxonomic affiliations,
   social behaviors, and degrees of host plant specificity lend themselves
   to being sampled, and possibly to their appearing to undergo faunal
   turnover. When these behaviors are taken into account, these comparisons
   imply either (1) impacts, in descending order of severity, on parasitic
   bees, oligolectic solitary bees, and polylectic solitary bees or (2) the
   relative ineffectiveness with which these classes of bees are sampled
   with generalized pan-or bowl-trapping techniques. Seasonally limited
   summer sampling protocols may favor polylectic social bees, as reflected
   in halictids' being disproportionately well-sampled relative to
   andrenids, which account for a majority of early season oligolectic
   solitary bees-ironically those of potentially greatest interest when
   evaluating the stability of pollinator faunal diversity. By virtue of
   their abundance and protracted flight seasons, in contrast, eusocial
   bees appear to be among the most readily sampled, though potentially
   less relevant to the purposes of evaluating the integrity of
   animal-pollinated plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Melipona mondury Smith 1863 is an important stingless bee species
   pollinator and honey/ pollen producer, but threatened by fragmentation
   of habitats throughout its range. This article presents the
   identification and partial characterization of nesting substrates,
   bionomic including population features of M. mondury by comparing data
   between nest architecture of natural beehive and boxes colonies.
   Nineteen colonies (13 in boxes and six in beehives) were analyzed with
   regards to substrate nesting, nest characteristics (e.g. length and
   width of the combs, height and diameter of the pollen and honey jar) and
   bee population. The average volume and diameter of the trunks cavities
   used for nesting of M. mondury were 18.4 L and 15.8 cm; the average
   number of combs was 9.26; the average diameter and height of the honey
   pots were 2.81 cm and 3.29 cm, and the average volume of honey stored
   was 15.85 mL; the average height and diameter of pollen pots was 3.21 cm
   and 2.93 cm, respectively, while the average mass of pollen deposited
   was equal to 12.56 g. The population ranged from 3537 to 10281
   individuals between colonies. The results suggest that the conservation
   of M. mondury should involve reforestation with native species from
   Atlantic Forest, and the dimensions of boxes should be based on the
   average size of the nests in the natural environment in order to support
   strategies of conservation and sustainable management of this species.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure of the earth bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) was
   examined across 22 wild populations and two commercially reared
   populations using eight microsatellite loci and two mitochondrial genes.
   Our study included wild bumblebee samples from six populations in
   Ireland, one from the Isle of Man, four from Britain and 11 from
   mainland Europe. A further sample was acquired from New Zealand.
   Observed levels of genetic variability and heterozygosity were low in
   Ireland and the Isle of Man, but relatively high in continental Europe
   and among commercial populations. Estimates of F-st revealed significant
   genetic differentiation among populations. Bayesian cluster analysis
   indicated that Irish populations were highly differentiated from British
   and continental populations, the latter two showing higher levels of
   admixture. The data suggest that the Irish Sea and prevailing south
   westerly winds act as a considerable geographical barrier to gene flow
   between populations in Ireland and Britain; however, some immigration
   from the Isle of Man to Ireland was detected. The results are discussed
   in the context of the recent commercialization of bumblebees for the
   European horticultural industry.}},

Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{36-43}},

Abstract = {{Pollen limitation of plant reproduction occurs in many plant species,
   particularly those in patched habitats, but the mechanisms are often
   unknown. We investigated the relationship among pollen limitation,
   pollinator visitation and breeding system in salt cedar, i.e., the shrub
   Tamarix ramosissima (Ledeb), which is one of ecologically important
   species in arid regions of Northwest China. We observed insect
   visitations to T. ramosissima and estimated pollen limitation. T.
   ramosissima was pollinated by at least six native bee species, and we
   observed that pollinator diversity and composition of the pollinator
   assemblages could affect pollen limitation. Pollinator visitation
   differed significantly between habitat patches, but did not differ
   significantly between patch sizes. In general, pollen limitation
   appeared to be more severe in fruit set than in seed production and the
   patches with more pollinator visits were less pollen limited in fruit
   set. However, pollen limitation in seed production was not significantly
   correlated with pollinator visitation frequency. We concluded that
   pollen limitation of T. ramosissima reproduction depended on more than
   one factor, not just pollinator visits. We also found that out-crossing
   was dominant and self-pollination just played an assistant role to
   assure reproduction. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{69-76}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Multi-year transgenic field trials were conducted to assess the extent
   of pollen-mediated transgenic flow in Virginia to support a petition
   requesting deregulated status for Blight Blocker peanuts from USDA
   Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Biotechnology
   Regulatory Services (BRS). We measured transgene flow from transgenic
   lines to their non-transgenic parental cultivars. A colorimetric method
   based on quantification of hydrogen peroxide released from oxalic acid
   in the presence of the oxalate oxidase was used to screen seed embryos
   from non-transgenic rows at various distances from the transgenic
   source. The overall transgene flow rate in three cultivars was 0.2094\%
   based on screening over 85,000 seeds. In general, the transgene flow
   rate greatly declined past 10 m from the transgene source. However, a
   transgene flow rate of less than 0.05\% did occur sporadically at
   greater distances than 10 m. In conclusion, transgene flow in peanut can
   be spatially confined to provide negligible rates using relatively short
   separation distances. The extremely low rate of transgene flow at
   greater distance was dependent on ecological and environmental contexts,
   particularly on foraging patterns and flight distance of pollinators.

Abstract = {{Biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiments have established that
   species richness and composition are both important determinants of
   ecosystem function in an experimental context. Determining whether this
   result holds for real-world ecosystem services has remained elusive,
   however, largely due to the lack of analytical methods appropriate for
   large-scale, associational data. Here, we use a novel analytical
   approach, the Price equation, to partition the contribution to ecosystem
   services made by species richness, composition and abundance in four
   large-scale data sets on crop pollination by native bees. We found that
   abundance fluctuations of dominant species drove ecosystem service
   delivery, whereas richness changes were relatively unimportant because
   they primarily involved rare species that contributed little to
   function. Thus, the mechanism behind our results was the skewed
   species-abundance distribution. Our finding that a few common species,
   not species richness, drive ecosystem service delivery could have broad
   generality given the ubiquity of skewed species-abundance distributions
   in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental fate processes of neonicotinoid insecticides are of
   significant interest, given the serious threats these chemicals can pose
   to nontarget organisms such as pollinators (e.g., bees). Direct
   photolysis was investigated using a laboratory photoreactor
   approximating full-spectrum sunlight to predict the aquatic fate of
   neonicotinoids. Quantum yields (phi(c)) were 0.019 +/- 0.001, 0.013 +/-
   0.001, 0.0092 +/- 0.0005, 0.0022 +/- 0.0003, and 0.0013 +/- 0.0002 for
   thiamethoxam, clothianidin, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, and thiacloprid,
   respectively. On the basis of these values, estimated half-lives were
   0.2-1.5 days for different seasons in surface waters at temperate
   latitudes for thiamethoxam, consistent with the 0.98 day half-life
   observed experimentally outdoors at Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada (50
   degrees N), for thiamethoxam in summer. Light attenuation through
   shallow clear surface waters (e.g., by natural organic matter) indicated
   that photolysis of thiamethoxam at depths greater than 8 cm was
   negligible, which may help explain reports of its environmental
   persistence.}},

Abstract = {{A central question in the field of plant-pollinator interactions is
   whether and how can plants choose the optimal pollinators when plants
   cannot directly assess the quality of floral visitors. To answer this
   question and to provide a new perspective to this problem, we develop a
   screening game modeling the plant-pollinator interaction. We propose
   that some floral traits could be interpreted as an entry barrier with a
   strategic cost the plants impose on floral visitors. The pollinators
   decide to further interact with the plant only if the cost is not
   prohibitive. Therefore, by imposing the right level of costs, the plants
   may achieve interactions only with high-quality pollinators without a
   priori knowing the quality of visitors.}},

Abstract = {{1. Plant-pollinator interactions are affected by global change, with
   largely negative impacts on pollination and plant reproduction. Urban
   areas provide a unique and productive study system for understanding the
   impacts of many global change drivers on plant-pollinator interactions.
   2. We review the mechanistic pathways through which urban drivers alter
   plant-pollinator interactions. The literature on urban drivers of
   plant-pollinator interactions is small but growing and has already
   produced exciting insights about how population processes or pollinator
   behaviour interacts with landscape urban drivers to affect pollination
   outcomes.
   3. Habitat loss and fragmentation can change flower visitation rates and
   pollination success through changes in pollinator foraging behaviour or
   through population-level effects on pollinators. Urban environments,
   where impermeable surface provides an inhospitable matrix, may allow
   researchers to identify habitat fragments more clearly than in many
   other environments.
   4. Recent studies have found that non-native plants are not differently
   preferred by pollinators relative to native plants, therefore removing
   the basis for expecting pollinator-mediated competition between native
   and non-native plants in urban habitats. However, non-native species
   together with managed vegetation may have powerful effects in urban
   habitats via changes in community-level plant phenology and consequent
   changes in pollinator phenology.
   5. The current level of climate warming has not caused plants and
   pollinators to become detectably temporally separated, although at the
   same time, diversity among species' phenological responses could buffer
   plant-pollinator interactions from climate variation. Due to the urban
   warming effect, cities provide a promising system for better
   understanding the warming effects on plant-pollinator interactions.
   6. Environmental contaminants such as soil nitrogen and heavy metal
   pollution have been examined with respect to plant-pollinator
   interactions in small-scale, mechanistic studies. The extent to which
   environmental contaminants drive plant-pollinator interactions in actual
   urban landscapes is, however, currently unknown.
   7. Important knowledge gaps that require research attention include
   understanding the consequences of plant and pollinator trait filtering
   on plant-pollinator interactions, and expanding the literature to
   include underrepresented biomes and pollinator taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in floral volatile emissions can occur temporally through
   floral development, during diel cycles, as well as spatially within a
   flower. These spatiotemporal patterns are hypothesized to provide
   additional information to floral visitors, but they are rarely measured,
   and their attendant hypotheses are even more rarely tested. In Penstemon
   digitalis, a plant whose floral scent has been shown to be under strong
   phenotypic selection for seed fitness, we investigated spatiotemporal
   variation in floral scent by using dynamic headspace collection,
   respectively solid-phase microextraction, and analyzed the volatile
   samples by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Total volatile
   emission was greatest during flowering and peak pollinator activity
   hours, suggesting its importance in mediating ecological interactions.
   We also detected tissue and reward-specific compounds, consistent with
   the hypothesis that complexity in floral scent composition reflects
   several ecological functions. In particular, we found tissue-specific
   scents for the stigma, stamens, and staminode (a modified sterile stamen
   common to all Penstemons). Our findings emphasize the dynamic nature of
   floral scents and highlight a need for greater understanding of
   ecological and physiological mechanisms driving spatiotemporal patterns
   in scent production.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Larger inflorescences in reward-producing plants can benefit plants by
   increasing both pollinator attraction and the duration of visits by
   individual pollinators. However, ultimately, inflorescence size is
   determined by the balance between the benefits of large inflorescences
   and the increased cost of geitonogamy. At present, little is known about
   the relationship between inflorescence size and fecundity in deceptive
   plants. Given that pollinators are likely to leave inflorescences
   lacking rewards quickly, it seems unlikely that longer pollinator visits
   and the risk of geitonogamy would be strong selective pressures in these
   species, which indicates that pollinator attraction might be the most
   important factor influencing their inflorescence size. Here we examined
   the pollination ecology of the deceptive orchid Cephalanthera falcata in
   order to clarify the effects of inflorescence size on the fruit set of
   this non-rewarding species. Field observations of the floral visitors
   showed that C. falcata is pollinated by the andrenid bee Andrena
   aburana, whilst pollination experiments demonstrated that this orchid
   species is neither autogamous nor apogamous, but is strongly pollinator
   dependent. Three consecutive years of field observations revealed that
   fruit set was positively correlated with the number of flowers per
   inflorescence. These results provide strong evidence that the nectarless
   orchid C. falcata benefits from producing larger inflorescences that
   attract a greater number of innate pollinators. Large inflorescences may
   have a greater positive effect on fruit set in deceptive plants because
   a growing number of studies suggest that fruit set in reward-producing
   plants is usually unaffected by display size.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents DNA barcode records for 4118 specimens representing
   561 species of bees belonging to the six families of Apoidea
   (Andrenidae, Apidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae and

   compliant barcode sequences for 503 of the 571 bee species in the German
   fauna and partial sequences for 43 more. The barcode results are largely
   congruent with traditional taxonomy as only five closely allied pairs of
   species could not be discriminated by barcodes. As well, 90\% of the
   species possessed sufficiently deep sequence divergence to be assigned
   to a different Barcode Index Number (BIN). In fact, 56 species (11\%)
   were assigned to two or more BINs reflecting the high levels of
   intraspecific divergence among their component specimens. Fifty other
   species (9.7\%) shared the same Barcode Index Number with one or more
   species, but most of these species belonged to a distinct barcode
   cluster within a particular BIN. The barcode data contributed to
   clarifying the status of nearly half the examined taxonomically
   problematic species of bees in the German fauna. Based on these results,
   the role of DNA barcoding as a tool for current and future taxonomic

Volume = {{207}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{377-389}},

Abstract = {{Episodes of rapid speciation provide unique insights into evolutionary
   processes underlying species radiations and patterns of biodiversity.
   Here we investigated the radiation of sexually deceptive bee orchids
   (Ophrys). Based on a time-calibrated phylogeny and by means of ancestral
   character reconstruction and divergence time estimation, we estimated
   the tempo and mode of this radiation within a state-dependent
   evolutionary framework. It appears that, in the Pleistocene, the
   evolution of Ophrys was marked by episodes of rapid diversification
   coinciding with shifts to different pollinator types: from wasps to
   Eucera bees to Andrena and other bees. An abrupt increase in net
   diversification rate was detected in three clades. Among these, two
   phylogenetically distant lineages switched from Eucera to Andrena and
   other bees in a parallel fashion and at about the same time in their
   evolutionary history. Lack of early radiation associated with the
   evolution of the key innovation of sexual deception suggests that Ophrys
   diversification was mainly driven by subsequent ecological opportunities
   provided by the exploitation of novel pollinator groups, encompassing
   many bee species slightly differing in their sex pheromone communication
   systems, and by spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pollinator mosaic.}},

   many of them may serve as diagnostic or flagship species in nature
   conservation. Here we examined 6,018 galls induced >= 1 year prior their
   collection by the chloropid flies Lipara spp. The galls were collected
   at 34 sites in Central Europe. We examined 1,389 nests (4,513
   individuals) of nine species, part of which were parasitized by one
   dipteran and two chrysidid parasitoid species. We describe the nests of
   seven dominant species and larvae of four species (Pemphredon fabricii,
   Trypoxylon deceptorium, Hoplitis leucomelanaand Hylaeus pectoralis) and
   two parasitoids (Trichrysis cyanea and Thyridanthrax fenestratus, both
   in nests of Pemphredon fabriciiand Trypoxylon deceptorium). All the
   species, but H. pectoralis, preferred robust galls at very thin stalks
   (induced typically by Lipara lucens) over the narrow galls on thick
   stalks. The larvae of P. fabricii and T. deceptoriumresembled strongly
   their sibling species (Pemphredon lethiferand Trypoxylon attenuatum
   sensu lato, respectively). The larvae of T. fenestratus showed features
   different from those previously described. By hatching set of another
   10,583 galls induced by Lipara spp. >= 1 year prior their collection, we
   obtained 4,469 individuals of 14 nesting hymenopteran species, two
   cleptoparasites, three chrysidid and one dipteran parasitoid. Of these
   species, four new nesting species have been recorded for the first time

   rubicola, Pseudoanthidium lituratum and Hylaeus incongruus. We also
   provide first records of their nest cleptoparasites Stelis breviuscula
   and Stelis ornatula, and the parasitoid Holopyga fastuosa generosa.
   Thyridanthrax fenestratus formed strong populations in nests of
   Pemphredon fabricii and Trypoxylon deceptorium, which are both newly
   recorded hosts for T. fenestratus. The descriptions provided here allow

Title = {{Direct and Indirect Influence of Non-Native Neighbours on Pollination
   and Fruit Production of a Native Plant}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 25}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Entomophilous non-native plants can directly affect the pollination and
   reproductive success of native plant species and also indirectly, by
   altering the composition and abundance of floral resources in the
   invaded community. Separating direct from indirect effects is critical
   for understanding the mechanisms underlying the impacts of non-native
   species on recipient communities.
   Objectives
   Our aims are: (a) to explore both the direct effect of the non-native
   Hedysarum coronarium and its indirect effect, mediated by the alteration
   of floral diversity, on the pollinator visitation rate and
   fructification of the native Leopoldia comosa and (b) to distinguish
   whether the effects of the non-native species were due to its floral
   display or to its vegetative interactions.
   Methods
   We conducted field observations within a flower removal experimental
   setup (i.e. non-native species present, absent and with its
   inflorescences removed) at the neighbourhood scale.
   Results
   Our study illustrates the complexity of mechanisms involved in the
   impacts of non-native species on native species. Overall, Hedysarum
   increased pollinator visitation rates to Leopoldia target plants as a
   result of direct and indirect effects acting in the same direction. Due
   to its floral display, Hedysarum exerted a direct magnet effect
   attracting visits to native target plants, especially those made by the
   honeybee. Indirectly, Hedysarum also increased the visitation rate of
   native target plants. Due to the competition for resources mediated by
   its vegetative parts, it decreased floral diversity in the
   neighbourhoods, which was negatively related to the visitation rate to
   native target plants. Hedysarum overall also increased the
   fructification of Leopoldia target plants, even though such an increase
   was the result of other indirect effects compensating for the observed
   negative indirect effect mediated by the decrease of floral diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bee communities provide underappreciated but critical agricultural
   pollination services. Given predicted global shortages in pollination
   services, managing agroecosystems to support thriving wild bee
   communities is, therefore, central to ensuring sustainable food
   production. Benefits of natural (including semi-natural) habitat for
   wild bee abundance and diversity on farms are well documented. By
   contrast, few studies have examined toxicity of pesticides on wild bees,
   let alone effects of farm-level pesticide exposure on entire bee
   communities. Whether beneficial natural areas could mediate effects of
   harmful pesticides on wild bees is also unknown. Here, we assess the
   effect of conventional pesticide use on the wild bee community visiting
   apple (Malus domestica) within a gradient of percentage natural area in
   the landscape. Wild bee community abundance and species richness
   decreased linearly with increasing pesticide use in orchards one year
   after application; however, pesticide effects on wild bees were buffered
   by increasing proportion of natural habitat in the surrounding
   landscape. A significant contribution of fungicides to observed
   pesticide effects suggests deleterious properties of a class of
   pesticides that was, until recently, considered benign to bees. Our
   results demonstrate extended benefits of natural areas for wild
   pollinators and highlight the importance of considering the landscape
   context when weighing up the costs of pest management on crop
   pollination services.}},

Title = {{Safeguarding Ecosystem Services: A Methodological Framework to Buffer
   the Joint Effect of Habitat Configuration and Climate Change}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem services provided by mobile agents are increasingly threatened
   by the loss and modification of natural habitats and by climate change,
   risking the maintenance of biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and human
   welfare. Research oriented towards a better understanding of the joint
   effects of land use and climate change over the provision of specific
   ecosystem services is therefore essential to safeguard such services.
   Here we propose a methodological framework, which integrates species
   distribution forecasts and graph theory to identify key conservation
   areas, which if protected or restored could improve habitat connectivity
   and safeguard ecosystem services. We applied the proposed framework to
   the provision of pollination services by a tropical stingless bee
   (Melipona quadrifasciata), a key pollinator of native flora from the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest and important agricultural crops. Based on the
   current distribution of this bee and that of the plant species used to
   feed and nest, we projected the joint distribution of bees and plants in
   the future, considering a moderate climate change scenario (following
   IPPC). We then used this information, the bee's flight range, and the
   current mapping of Atlantic Forest remnants to infer habitat suitability
   and quantify local and regional habitat connectivity for 2030, 2050 and
   2080. Our results revealed north to south and coastal to inland shifts
   in the pollinator distribution during the next 70 years. Current and
   future connectivity maps unraveled the most important corridors, which
   if protected or restored, could facilitate the dispersal and
   establishment of bees during distribution shifts. Our results also
   suggest that coffee plantations from eastern Sao Paulo and southern
   Minas Gerais States could suffer a pollinator deficit in the future,
   whereas pollination services seem to be secured in southern Brazil.
   Landowners and governmental agencies could use this information to
   implement new land use schemes. Overall, our proposed methodological
   framework could help design novel conservational and agricultural
   practices that can be crucial to conserve ecosystem services by
   buffering the joint effect of habitat configuration and climate change.}},

   Host-Cleptoparasite Complex of Neotropical Orchid Bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Orchid bees compose an exclusive Neotropical pollinators group, with
   bright body coloration. Several of those species build their own nests,
   while others are reported as nest cleptoparasites. Here, the objective
   was to evaluate whether the inclusion of a strong biotic interaction,
   such as the presence of a host species, improved the ability of species
   distribution models (SDMs) to predict the geographic range of the
   cleptoparasite species. The target species were Aglae caerulea and its
   host species Eulaema nigrita. Additionally, since Aglae caerulea is more
   frequently found in the Amazon rather than the Cerrado areas, a
   secondary objective was to evaluate whether this species is increasing
   or decreasing its distribution given South American past and current
   climatic conditions. SDMs methods (Maxent and Bioclim), in addition with
   current and past South American climatic conditions, as well as the
   occurrences for Aglae caerulea and Eulaema nigrita were used to generate
   the distribution models. The distribution of Aglae caerulea was
   generated with and without the inclusion of the distribution of Eulaema
   nigrita as a predictor variable. The results indicate Aglae caerulea was
   barely affected by past climatic conditions and the populations from the
   Cerrado savanna could be at least 21,000 years old (the last glacial
   maximum), as well as the Amazonian ones. On the other hand, in this
   study, the inclusion of the host-cleptoparasite interaction complex did
   not statistically improve the quality of the produced models, which
   means that the geographic range of this cleptoparasite species is mainly
   constrained by climate and not by the presence of the host species.
   Nonetheless, this could also be caused by unknown complexes of other
   Euglossini hosts with Aglae caerulea, which still are still needed to be
   described by science.}},

Title = {{Microsatellite Analysis of Museum Specimens Reveals Historical
   Differences in Genetic Diversity between Declining and More Stable
   Bombus Species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide most pollinators, e.g. bumblebees, are undergoing global
   declines. Loss of genetic diversity can play an essential role in these
   observed declines. In this paper, we investigated the level of genetic
   diversity of seven declining Bombus species and four more stable species
   with the use of microsatellite loci. Hereto we genotyped a unique
   collection of museum specimens. Specimens were collected between 1918
   and 1926, in 6 provinces of the Netherlands which allowed us to make
   interspecific comparisons of genetic diversity. For the stable species
   B. pascuorum, we also selected populations from two additional time
   periods: 1949-1955 and 1975-1990. The genetic diversity and population
   structure in B. pascuorum remained constant over the three time periods.
   However, populations of declining bumblebee species showed a
   significantly lower genetic diversity than co-occurring stable species
   before their major declines. This historical difference indicates that
   the repeatedly observed reduced genetic diversity in recent populations
   of declining bumblebee species is not caused solely by the decline
   itself. The historically low genetic diversity in the declined species
   may be due to the fact that these species were already rare, making them
   more vulnerable to the major drivers of bumblebee decline.}},

   Significance for Host Recognition by an Oligolectic Bee Pollinator}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Oligolectic bees collect pollen from a few plants within a genus or
   family to rear their offspring, and are known to rely on visual and
   olfactory floral cues to recognize host plants. However, studies
   investigating whether oligolectic bees recognize distinct host plants by
   using shared floral cues are scarce. In the present study, we
   investigated in a comparative approach the visual and olfactory floral
   cues of six Campanula species, of which only Campanula lactiflora has
   never been reported as a pollen source of the oligolectic bee Ch.
   rapunculi. We hypothesized that the flowers of Campanula species visited
   by Ch. rapunculi share visual (i.e. color) and/or olfactory cues
   (scents) that give them a host-specific signature. To test this
   hypothesis, floral color and scent were studied by spectrophotometric
   and chemical analyses, respectively. Additionally, we performed
   bioassays within a flight cage to test the innate color preference of
   Ch. rapunculi. Our results show that Campanula flowers reflect the light
   predominantly in the UV-blue/blue bee-color space and that Ch. rapunculi
   displays a strong innate preference for these two colors. Furthermore,
   we recorded spiroacetals in the floral scent of all Campanula species,
   but Ca. lactiflora. Spiroacetals, rarely found as floral scent
   constituents but quite common among Campanula species, were recently
   shown to play a key function for host-flower recognition by Ch.
   rapunculi. We conclude that Campanula species share some visual and
   olfactory floral cues, and that neurological adaptations (i.e. vision
   and olfaction) of Ch. rapunculi innately drive their foraging flights
   toward host flowers. The significance of our findings for the evolution
   of pollen diet breadth in bees is discussed.}},

Title = {{Bumblebee Pupae Contain High Levels of Aluminium}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN 4}},
Abstract = {{The causes of declines in bees and other pollinators remains an on-going
   debate. While recent attention has focussed upon pesticides, other
   environmental pollutants have largely been ignored. Aluminium is the
   most significant environmental contaminant of recent times and we
   speculated that it could be a factor in pollinator decline. Herein we
   have measured the content of aluminium in bumblebee pupae taken from
   naturally foraging colonies in the UK. Individual pupae were
   acid-digested in a microwave oven and their aluminium content determined
   using transversely heated graphite furnace atomic absorption
   spectrometry. Pupae were heavily contaminated with aluminium giving
   values between 13.4 and 193.4 mu g/g dry wt. and a mean (SD) value of
   51.0 (33.0) mu g/g dry wt. for the 72 pupae tested. Mean aluminium
   content was shown to be a significant negative predictor of average
   pupal weight in colonies. While no other statistically significant
   relationships were found relating aluminium to bee or colony health, the
   actual content of aluminium in pupae are extremely high and demonstrate
   significant exposure to aluminium. Bees rely heavily on cognitive
   function and aluminium is a known neurotoxin with links, for example, to
   Alzheimer's disease in humans. The significant contamination of
   bumblebee pupae by aluminium raises the intriguing spectre of cognitive
   dysfunction playing a role in their population decline.}},

Abstract = {{Trisiloxane surfactants (TSSs) have been associated with honeybee
   learning impairment and the ongoing global bee decline. A liquid
   chromatography-mass spectrometry strategy for the identification of TSSs
   from agrochemical adjuvants and pollinator-related matrices is
   introduced here. The strategy incorporates chromatographic retention
   behavior, isotope ratio, reference to a compiled database of accurate
   masses, and TSS hydrolysis when necessary. Using this analytical
   strategy, three TSSs (x = 0, R = H, m = 1, 2, or 3) were identified for
   the first time from almond flowers of a commercial orchard. The three
   major purified TSS components in popularly used spray tank adjuvants
   were identified as TSS (x = 0, m = 0, R = H, CH3, or C(O)CH3) and their
   structures confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These
   monitoring tools allow the assessment of the agricultural residues and
   potential risks of major TSS contaminants to important nontarget species
   such as honeybee and other essential pollinators.}},

Journal = {{APIDOLOGIE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{465-477}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecosystem service sustained by a differentiated use of
   resources among sympatric species. The bee size can influence the
   similarity in the use of resources, and poricidal anthers limit the
   access to pollen. Therefore, we evaluated the influence of body size and
   the anther type of pollen sources in Centridini-flower interaction
   network. We expected that the low niche overlap, promoted by these
   morphological parameters, would result in the formation of subgroups and
   lead to greater network resilience. We studied 15 bee species (n = 73
   females) and identified their pollen sources. The bee size and anther
   type influenced the formation of subgroups in the community, and the
   larger bees used a higher proportion of flowers with poricidal anthers.
   Only the anther type influenced the robustness of the network. We
   conclude that the parameters analyzed influence both the use of
   resources by oil-collecting bees and their food niche breadth.}},

Abstract = {{This note brings, for the first time, findings obtained through both
   morphological and genetic analyses of a gynander orchid bee (Euglossa
   melanotricha). For the genetic analysis, microsatellite markers were
   used to genotype the gynander bee. The morphological analysis revealed
   that the individual studied had a sting, and most parts of the insect
   body showed female phenotype, except for the three left legs. As in
   other reports on gynanders of orchid bees, the specimen of E.
   melanotricha analyzed herein was included in the category of mixed (or
   mosaic). From the seven microsatellite loci amplified, five were
   heterozygous for both male and female tissues, indicating that the
   organism analyzed is compatible with a diploid organism and not with a
   hemizygous or haploid one. Both the morphological and genetic
   characteristics of the gynander of E. melanotricha analyzed reveal that
   this specimen shows predominantly female characteristics. In parallel,
   when considering the genetic uniformity of phenotypically different
   tissues (male and female) of this individual, the gynandromorph of E.
   melanotricha would be, in fact, an intersex bee.}},

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS}},

Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Flowering plants are a major component of terrestrial ecosystems, and
   most of them depend on animal pollinators for reproduction. Thus, the
   mutualism between flowering plants and their pollinators is a keystone
   ecological relationship in both natural and agricultural ecosystems.
   Though plant-pollinator interactions have received considerable amount
   of attention, there are still many unanswered questions. In this paper,
   we use methods of evolutionary game theory to investigate the
   co-evolution of floral advertisement and pollinator preferences.
   Our results indicate that competition for pollination services among
   plant species can in some cases lead to specialization of the pollinator
   population to a single plant species (oligolecty). However, collecting
   pollen from multiple plants - at least at the population level - is
   evolutionarily stable under a wider parameter range. Finally, we show
   that, in the presence of pollinators, plants that optimize their
   investment in attracting vs. rewarding visiting pollinators outcompete
   plants that do not. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife-friendly gardening practices can help conserve biodiversity in
   urban areas. These include growing ornamental plant varieties attractive
   to flower-visiting insects. Because varieties vary greatly in
   attractiveness, there is a need to quantify it in order to give
   objective advice to gardeners. Here, we used the British national
   collection of asters to compare the attractiveness of varieties to
   flower-visiting insects. We counted and identified insects as they
   foraged on flowers in 228 varieties growing in discrete patches that
   flowered during the survey period, 14 September-20 October 2012. In each
   variety, we also determined the overall capitulum size, the central disc
   floret area, and the ray floret color (blue, red, purple, or white). We
   also scored attributes relevant to gardening: attractiveness to humans,
   ease of cultivation, and availability in the United Kingdom. There was
   great variation among varieties in their attractiveness to insects,
   ranging from 0.0 to 15.2 per count per square meter, and highly skewed,
   with most being unattractive. A similar skew held for the two main
   insect categories, honey bees and hover flies, which comprised 28 and
   64\% of all insects, respectively. None of the floral traits or
   attributes relevant to gardening correlated significantly with
   attractiveness to insects. Our study shows the practicality of using a
   national collection for quantifying and comparing the attractiveness of
   ornamental varieties to flower-visiting insects. These results imply
   that choosing varieties carefully is likely to be of conservation
   benefit to flower-visiting insects, and that doing so is a no-cost
   option in terms of garden beauty and workload.}},

Abstract = {{In Apr 2010, Anthophora abrupta (Say) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was
   discovered nesting in open bags of colloidal clay in Gainesville,
   Florida, USA, in an open-air shed. Label data from A. abrupta specimens
   in the Hymenoptera holdings of the Florida State Collection of
   Arthropods indicated that no specimen had been collected previously from
   Alachua County and that the most recent Floridian specimen was collected
   in 1987. This suggests that A. abrupta may be locally rare and possibly
   in decline or threatened regionally. Many of the plants that A. abrupta
   is reported to visit are listed as threatened or endangered in 1 or more
   states. In an effort to study the potential management and conservation
   of this species, the original nest aggregation was split in 2012 and
   2013, and the splits were moved to new nest sites to see if they would
   establish at the new sites. Both mother and daughter nest aggregations
   were monitored in Spring of 2012-2014. Herein, a brief review of A.
   abrupta natural history, an account of the attempts to split the
   aggregations for new nest establishment, and suggestions for the
   potential management of this beneficial insect are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is a crop with perfect flowers capable
   of self-pollination. Insect pollination enhances fruit set, but little
   is known about how pollination success varies by number of visits from
   bumble bees. To quantify the efficiency of bumble bees at pollinating
   eggplants, we allowed 1, 2, 6, and 12 bumble bees (Bombus impatiens
   Cresson) to visit eggplant flowers and compared percentage of flowers
   that set fruit, fruit weight, and seed set after 3 wk. We compared yield
   from these visit numbers to eggplant flowers that were left open for
   unlimited visitation. Eggplant flowers set the most fruit from
   open-pollination and 12 visits. Larger, seedier fruits were formed in
   open-pollinated flowers. However, fruit characteristics in the 12 visit
   treatment were similar to lower visitation frequencies. We confirm B.
   impatiens as an efficient eggplant pollinator and document the greatest
   benefit from 12 bumble bee visits and open-pollinated flowers. To
   maintain effective eggplant pollination, local conditions must be
   conducive for bumble bee colony establishment and repeated pollen
   foraging trips.}},

Abstract = {{Assuming that genetically diverse populations of bees are less likely to
   suffer the harmful effects of inbreeding and better able to avoid an
   extinction vortex related to the sex determination mechanism, the
   identification of putative areas in which diversity is concentrated
   should be focus of a discussion. Models of historical climate stability
   constitute an elegant manner of inferring such areas. The aim of the
   present study was to model the potential distribution of stingless bees
   in different periods of climate extremes of the Late Quaternary and the
   current day. A spatially-explicit model was designed to predict areas in
   which genetic diversity is putatively concentrated in an assemblage of
   nineteen species in the southern Atlantic Forest, Brazil. These
   climatically-stable areas (i.e., refuges) were mainly recorded in three
   portions of coastal forests in southeastern Brazil, regions that
   concentrate areas of high to extreme importance to the conservation of
   biological diversity. Such regions have differences regarding size and
   suitability scores and are distributed within the southern Atlantic
   Forest Central Corridor (SCC), as well as the northern (NSM) and
   southern Serra do Mar Corridor (SSM). Considering that refuges
   historically harbor high degrees of genetic diversity, these three
   regions are indicated as those of high importance to the conservation of
   stingless bees in the Atlantic Forest.}},

Title = {{Ant-aphid interactions increase ant floral visitation and reduce plant
   reproduction via decreased pollinator visitation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1620-1630}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For plant species that depend on animal-mediated pollination,
   reproduction hinges on adequate access to pollinators. Even in the
   presence of intact pollinator assemblages, negative interactions among
   floral visitors can compromise pollination services. Ants, for example,
   visit flowers and can discourage visitation by other insects, but
   usually do not perform pollination themselves. Effects on plant
   reproduction that result from this type of interaction may be compounded
   by factors that increase the likelihood or extent of floral visitation
   by ants. Interactions between ants and honeydew-producing insects alter
   the activity and local abundance of ants on plants, but the degree to
   which these interactions increase floral visitation by ants and in turn
   disrupt pollination services remains incompletely understood. We
   manipulated the abundance of cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii) on cotton
   (Gossypium hirsutum) over three years to test how the interaction
   between honeydew-producing aphids and the Argentine ant (Linepithema
   humile) affects floral visitation by ants, floral visitation by bees,
   and seed production. Increasing aphid abundance increased ant abundance
   on cotton plants, and floral visitation by ants was positively related
   to ant abundance on leaves. The duration of visits by honey bees, the
   most common floral visitor aside from ants, declined with both
   increasing aphid abundance and increasing ant floral visitation. Two
   measures of seed production declined with increasing aphid abundance and
   reductions in the duration of bee visits. Aphid herbivory alone,
   however, did not affect seed production, which was independent of aphid
   abundance on plants that were manually cross-pollinated under greenhouse
   conditions. Our results illustrate that interactions between ants and
   honeydew-producing insects can enhance levels of floral visitation by
   ants and in turn disrupt pollination services enough to have measurable
   effects on plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Plant associations with protective ants are widespread among
   angiosperms, but carry the risk that ants will deter pollinators as well
   as herbivores. Such conflict, and adaptations to ameliorate or prevent
   the conflict, have been documented in African and neotropical acacias.
   Ant-acacia associations occur in Australia, but little is known of their
   ecology. Moreover, recent phylogenetic evidence indicates that
   Australian acacias are only distantly related to African and American
   acacias, providing an intercontinental natural experiment in the
   management of ant-pollinator conflict. We examined four populations of
   Acacia myrtifolia over a 400-km environmental gradient in southeastern
   Australia using ant and pollinator exclusion as well as direct
   observation of ants and pollinators to assess the potential for
   ant-pollinator conflict to affect seed set. Native bees were the only
   group of floral visitors whose visitation rates were a significant
   predictor of fruiting success, although beetles and wasps may play an
   important role as ``insurance{''} pollinators. We found no increase in
   pollinator visitation or fruiting success following ant exclusion, even
   with large sample sizes and effective exclusion. Because ants are
   facultative visitors to A. myrtifolia plants, their presence may be
   insufficient to interfere greatly with floral visitors. It is also
   likely that the morphological location of extrafloral nectaries tends to
   draw ants away from reproductive parts, although we commonly observed
   ants on inflorescences, so the spatial separation is not strict. A.
   myrtifolia appears to maintain a generalized mutualism over a wide
   geographic range without the need for elaborate adaptations to resolve
   ant-pollinator conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Monttea aphylla flowers simultaneously produce oil and nectar, rewards
   known to differentially attract ecologically and functionally distinct
   pollinators. We examined whether geographical differentiation occurred
   for rewards, and whether this could be explained by spatially
   heterogeneous pollinator guilds and climate. Rewards were measured
   across the entire species range. Geographical patterns of reward
   quantity and their relationships with biotic and abiotic factors were
   examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Latitude significantly
   explained population variation in nectar and oils, although in
   contrasting ways. Pollinator assemblages showed a prevalence of
   oil-collecting Centris bees. Centris vardyorum, specialized on
   M.aphylla, showed a latitudinal pattern of visits. Oil production was
   not higher where plants associated with ecologically specialized bees
   (i.e. C.vardyorum), but this occurred instead where they were less
   frequent and co-occurred with other bees that used many floral sources,
   including other plant species that produce oil. The multivariate
   analysis showed that the prevalence of C.vardyorum was the factor that
   contributed most significantly to the combined patterns of rewards. We
   suggest that large-scale variation in rewards involves local optima
   throughout the species range, related to processes that operate in each
   ecoregion with their particular biotic and abiotic scenarios.(c) 2015

Abstract = {{The growth of the Meliponiculture in floodplains in Central Amazon has
   aroused interest in the knowledge of trophic resources obtained by
   stingless bees. In this study, the pollen niche and trophic interactions
   were determined between colonies of Melipona (Michmelia) seminigra
   merrillae and Melipona (Melikerria) interrupta (Apidae: Meliponini)
   reared in Varzea area in the Central Amazon. The study was conducted
   between November 2011 and October 2012 in the Sucupira meliponary,
   located in Manaus, Amazonas state, Brazil. In identifying the corbicular
   loads of pollen, a total of 67 pollen types collected by M. seminigra
   merrillae and M. interrupta were recorded, distributed among 27
   families, with three pollen types remaining undetermined. Of this total,
   22 pollen types were exclusively collected by M. seminigra merrillae, 14
   were only collected by M. interrupta, and 31 pollen types were shared
   between the two species studied. These results indicate that the
   families Fabaceae, Melastomataceae, Myrtaceae, and Anacardiaceae, in
   addition to exhibiting high attractiveness, are key resources in
   maintaining these bees in the same meliponary. Considering the Pianka
   overlap index, except for December (O (ik) = 0.116), May (O (ik) =
   0.07), and June (O (ik) = 0.004), which exhibited values below the
   adopted significance level, the other months exhibited high
   interspecific competition for the aforementioned resources. From the
   palynological data obtained in this study, there was a high degree of
   connectance (C = 28 \%) compared to studies conducted without the
   addition of palynological data, reinforcing the importance of including
   pollen data in studies of interaction networks.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebee Bombus terrestris is a general pollinator in Europe and
   also highly suitable as greenhouse pollinator of various agricultural
   and horticultural crops such as tomato, sweet pepper or strawberry.
   Here, we highlight the importance of volatile emissions for the
   attractiveness and pollination efficiency of strawberry varieties,
   starting from the unique observation that two related strawberry
   varieties are pollinated to a different extent when cultivated together.
   In a flight cage Fragaria x ananassa var. `Sonata' was pollinated more
   frequently (> 2 times) and with longer-duration visits (11.2 vs. 6.7 s)
   by B. terrestris as compared to var. `Elsanta.' To investigate whether
   this visitation difference could be attributed to differential
   production of flower volatile compounds, we quantified and analyzed the
   floral emissions of both varieties. Samples of var. `Elsanta' contained
   more green leaf volatiles such as E-2-hexenal (0.53 vs. 0 ng/3 flowers),
   Z-3-hexenol (2.26 vs. 0.20 ng/3 flowers) and Z-3-hexenyl acetate (2.15
   vs. 0.46 ng/3 flowers) which are known to play a role in plant defense.
   In a third series of experiments, we determined olfactory responses of
   B. terrestris to some similar individual synthetic green leaf volatiles
   presented in a Y-tube olfactometer. B. terrestris workers responded in
   an aversive manner to these volatile compounds compared to purified air.
   Since the floral bouquet of var. `Elsanta' contains more green leaf
   volatiles, bumblebees will exhibit a preference for var. `Sonata.' Our
   observations suggest that the pollination preference for `Sonata' is due
   to being `less repellent' instead of `more attractive' than `Elsanta,'
   with variety-specific flower emissions lying at the basis.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Flower colours are important cues shaping the interaction between plants
   and pollinators. Plants flowering in distinct habitats like grasslands
   and forests present their flowers in very different light environments
   and against different backgrounds. Since most Angiosperms depend on or
   profit from pollination by animals, plants may exhibit flower colours
   that are most conspicuous when seen in the predominant illumination or
   against the predominant background colour of their environment. To
   compare flower colours of different habitats, we collected flower
   reflectance spectra of 239 herbs from forest and grassland sites in
   three German regions. We compared chromatic and achromatic components of
   flower colours from the honeybee's point of view as well as in principal
   component analysis (PCA) to exclude the bias of particular visual
   systems. Our results show that flower colours do not differ between
   closed forest and open grassland habitats in any chromatic or achromatic
   aspect both from the bee's perspective and without any model bias (PCA).
   Thus, although the colours of lights and backgrounds are different
   between both types of habitats, we find no evidence of an adaptation of
   flower colours to the visual system of bees. The finding that flower
   colours look similar for bees in different environments may be related
   to a mechanism called colour constancy which allows bees and other
   pollinator species to compensate for varying illumination conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Speciation in angiosperms can be accompanied by
   changes in floral colour that may influence pollinator preference and
   reproductive isolation. This study investigates whether changes in
   floral colour can accompany polyploid and homoploid hybridization,
   important processes in angiosperm evolution.
   Methods Spectral reflectance of corolla tissue was examined for 60
   Nicotiana (Solanaceae) accessions (41 taxa) based on spectral shape
   (corresponding to pigmentation) as well as bee and hummingbird colour
   perception in order to assess patterns of floral colour evolution.
   Polyploid and homoploid hybrid spectra were compared with those of their
   progenitors to evaluate whether hybridization has resulted in floral
   colour shifts.
   Key Results Floral colour categories in Nicotiana seem to have arisen
   multiple times independently during the evolution of the genus. Most
   younger polyploids displayed an unexpected floral colour, considering
   those of their progenitors, in the colour perception of at least one
   pollinator type, whereas older polyploids tended to resemble one or both
   of their progenitors.
   Conclusions Floral colour evolution in Nicotiana is weakly constrained
   by phylogeny, and colour shifts do occur in association with both
   polyploid and homoploid hybrid divergence. Transgressive floral colour
   in N. tabacum has arisen by inheritance of anthocyanin pigmentation from
   its paternal progenitor while having a plastid phenotype like its
   maternal progenitor. Potentially, floral colour evolution has been
   driven by, or resulted in, pollinator shifts. However, those polyploids
   that are not sympatric (on a regional scale) with their progenitor
   lineages are typically not divergent in floral colour from them, perhaps
   because of a lack of competition for pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{AimUnderstanding the mechanisms controlling variation in species
   richness along environmental gradients is one of the most important
   objectives in ecology. Resource availability is often considered as the
   major driver of animal diversity. However, in ectotherms, temperature
   might play a predominant role as it modulates metabolic rates and the
   access of animals to resources. Here, we investigate the relative
   importance of resource availability and temperature in determining the
   diversity pattern of bees along a 3.6-km elevational gradient.
   LocationMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania.
   MethodsWe assessed bee species richness and abundance with pan traps and
   floral resources with transect records on 60 study sites which were
   equally distributed over six near-natural and six disturbed habitat
   types along an elevational gradient from 870 to 4550m a.s.l. We used
   path analysis to disentangle the effects of temperature, precipitation,
   floral resource abundance, bee abundance and land use on bee species
   richness. In addition, we monitored flower visitation rates during
   transect walks at different elevations to evaluate the temperature
   dependence of bee-flower interactions.
   ResultsBee species richness continuously declined with elevation in
   natural and disturbed habitats. While the abundance of floral resources
   had a significant but only weak effect on species richness, the effect
   of temperature was strong. Temperature had a strong positive effect on
   species richness that was not mediated by bee abundance and an indirect
   effect via bee abundances. We observed higher levels of bee-flower
   interactions at higher temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that
   temperature limits diversity by constraining resource exploitation in
   ectotherms.
   Main conclusionsTemperature and the availability of resources shape
   species richness patterns along environmental gradients. In ectothermic
   organisms like bees temperature seems to have the more important role,
   as it both limits the access to resources (abundance-mediated effect)
   and accelerates other (abundance-independent) ecological and
   evolutionary processes that drive the maintenance and origination of
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that have an impact on the diversity of forage
   flora in the agricultural landscape is a key issue in the maintenance
   and control of food niches for pollinators. Field margins are common
   linear structures in the agricultural landscape. In the present study,
   we evaluated the factors that exert an impact on the forage flora
   composition and on the diversity in field margins. The study was
   conducted in the 2010 - 2011 time period across the agricultural
   landscape on the Lublin Upland of SE Poland. Data on the forage flora
   were obtained while making floristic charts along 45 transect plots x
   300 m; the total length being 13500 m. Multivariate ordination
   techniques (PCA and RDA) were employed to analyse forage-flora
   characteristics. Field margins represent valuable refuge areas for
   forage-species richness, but not for the abundance of forage species. On
   field margins, forage-species diversity benefits from the location of
   natural habitats (forests or meadows), primarily if the distance from
   these habitats is < 1000 m or the field acreage is < 10 ha. The shift
   from heterogeneous habitats to a more homogeneous landscape causes a
   reduction of forage floral diversity. Due to lack of dense
   forage-species patches, the promotion of sowing nectariferous and/or
   polleniferous species seems to be a reasonable management method to
   enhance the quantitative food niche on field margins and to support the
   conservation of pollinators in the areas surrounding farms.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture now constitutes 40-50\% of terrestrial land use globally. By
   enhancing habitat suitability and connectivity, restoration within
   agricultural landscapes could have a major influence on biodiversity
   conservation. However, habitat management within intensive agricultural
   landscapes may primarily boost abundances of common, highly mobile
   generalists, rather than vulnerable or endangered species. We studied
   pollinator community response to small-scale habitat restoration in the
   intensively farmed Central Valley of California to determine whether
   restoration could also promote more specialized, less common and/or less
   mobile species.
   Composition of pollinator communities was assessed in five experimental
   and 10 control (unrestored) sites before and after restoration of native
   plant hedgerows over an 8-year period, using a before-after
   control-impact design.
   We characterized bee and fly species based on functional response traits
   {[}floral specialization, habitat specialization, abundance, body size
   and sociality (bees only)] known to influence the response to habitat
   change.
   We modelled how species occurrences changed with habitat restoration
   over time as modulated by their response traits.
   We found that hedgerows not only significantly enhanced occurrences of
   native bee and syrphid fly species, but that as hedgerows matured, they
   had a greater positive effect on species that were more specialized in
   floral and nesting resources and smaller (less mobile).
   Synthesis and applications. Unlike previous studies that suggest habitat
   restoration in agricultural landscapes only benefits mobile, generalist
   species, our results suggest that small-scale habitat restoration can
   promote species whose traits likely render them particularly vulnerable
   to habitat degradation. Thus, even within highly intensive agricultural
   landscapes, small-scale habitat restoration can be a conservation
   management tool. However, tailoring habitat enhancements to promote
   certain species or guilds may be critical for their success as a
   conservation intervention in agricultural landscapes.

Title = {{Contrasting patterns in species and functional-trait diversity of bees

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{706-715}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change frequently reduces local species diversity. Species
   losses will often result in loss of trait diversity, with likely
   consequences for community functioning. However, the converse need not
   be generally true: management approaches that succeed in retaining
   species richness could nevertheless fail to maintain trait diversity. We
   evaluated this possibility using bee communities in a California
   agroecosystem. We examined among site patterns in bee species diversity
   and functional-trait diversity in a landscape composed of a mosaic of
   semi-natural habitat, organic farms and conventional farms. We sampled
   bees from all three habitat types and compiled a data base of
   life-history (functional') traits for each species. Although species
   richness was higher on organic farms than conventional farms, functional
   diversity was lower in both farm types than in natural habitat. Nesting
   location (below-ground vs. above-ground) was the primary trait
   contributing to differences in functional diversity between farms and
   natural habitat, reflecting observed differences in availability of
   nesting substrates among habitat types. Other traits, including
   phenology and sociality, were also associated with species' occurrences
   or dominance in particular site types. These patterns suggest that
   management practices common to all farms act as environmental filters
   that cause similarly low functional diversity in their bee
   communities.Synthesis and applications. Although our results support the
   value of organic farming in maintaining abundant and species-rich bee
   communities, components of bee functional diversity are not well
   supported in farmed landscapes, regardless of farming practice.
   Maintenance of natural habitat, and/or the addition of natural habitat
   elements to farms, is therefore important for the retention of
   functionally diverse bee assemblages in agroecosystems.

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus) are the primary pollinators of tomatoes grown in
   greenhouses and can significantly increase fruit weight compared with
   tomatoes that receive no supplemental pollination. More than a million
   colonies are sold worldwide annually to meet pollination needs. Due to
   mounting concerns over the transportation of bumble bees outside of
   their native ranges, several species native to western North American
   are currently being investigated as potential commercial pollinators.
   Here, two western, Bombus huntii Greene and Bombus vosnesenskii
   Radoszkowski, and one eastern species, Bombus impatiens Cresson, are
   compared for their efficacy as pollinators of greenhouse-grown tomatoes.
   In two experiments, colonies were placed in greenhouses and compared
   with control plants that received no supplemental pollination. In the
   first experiment, seed set was significantly increased with B. huntii
   pollination in one variety of cherry tomatoes. In the second experiment
   comparing all three bumble bee species, fruit weight was an average of
   25.2 g heavier per fruit pollinated by bees versus the control, and the
   number of days to harvest was 2.9 d shorter for bee-pollinated fruit. In
   some rounds of pollination, differences were found among bumble bee
   species, but these were inconsistent across replicates and not
   statistically significant overall. Additionally, fruit weight was shown
   to be highly correlated to fruit diameter and seed set in all tests and,
   thus, is shown to be a reliable metric for assessing pollination in
   future studies. These results suggest that commercialization of western
   bumble bees is a viable alternative to the current practices of moving
   of nonnative bees into western North America to pollinate tomatoes.}},

Abstract = {{The apparent reduction of solitary and primitively eusocial bees
   populations has remained a huge concern over the past few decades and
   urbanisation is considered as one of the factors affecting bees at
   different scales depending on bee guild. As urbanisation is increasing
   globally it necessitates more research to understand the complex
   community dynamics of solitary and primitively eusocial bees in urban
   settings. We investigated the urban core of a British town for diversity
   and abundance of solitary bees using standardized methods, and compared
   the results with nearby meadows and nature reserves. The study recorded
   48 species within the town, about 22 \% of the total species and 58 \%
   of the genera of solitary bees in the United Kingdom. Furthermore we
   found the urban core to be more diverse and abundant in solitary and
   primitively eusocial bees compared to the meadows and nature reserves.
   Of particular note was an urban record of the nationally rare Red Data
   Book species Coelioxys quadridentata and its host Anthophora
   quadrimaculata. This research demonstrates that urban settings can
   contribute significantly to the conservation of solitary and primitively
   eusocial bees in Britain.}},

Title = {{Delivery of crop pollination services is an insufficient argument for
   wild pollinator conservation}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is compelling evidence that more diverse ecosystems deliver
   greater benefits to people, and these ecosystem services have become a
   key argument for biodiversity conservation. However, it is unclear how
   much biodiversity is needed to deliver ecosystem services in a cost-
   effective way. Here we show that, while the contribution of wild bees to
   crop production is significant, service delivery is restricted to a
   limited subset of all known bee species. Across crops, years and
   biogeographical regions, crop-visiting wild bee communities are
   dominated by a small number of common species, and threatened species
   are rarely observed on crops. Dominant crop pollinators persist under
   agricultural expansion and many are easily enhanced by simple
   conservation measures, suggesting that cost- effective management
   strategies to promote crop pollination should target a different set of
   species than management strategies to promote threatened bees.
   Conserving the biological diversity of bees therefore requires more than
   just ecosystem-service-based arguments.}},

   Transcripts from several pivotal diapause-related processes, including
   chromatin remodelling, cellular signalling pathways, microRNA
   processing, anaerobic glycolysis, cell cycle arrest and neuroendocrine
   control, are identified as being differentially expressed during the
   diapause to post-diapause transition. In conjunction with studies from

Abstract = {{Urbanization is increasing worldwide. Urban habitats often support
   considerable biodiversity and so are of conservation value, even though
   they are highly modified ecosystems. Urban parks and gardens are rich in
   flowers that provide food for pollinators, including bees. Here, we use
   waggle dance decoding to investigate foraging by 3 honey bee hives
   located in the city of Brighton, UK, over almost an entire foraging
   season, April to October. Waggle dances were recorded using video
   cameras and decoded during framewise playback on a computer by measuring
   the angle and duration of the waggle phase. Foraging was mostly local
   (mean monthly distances 0.5-1.2 km) and mostly within the surrounding
   urban area (monthly means 78-92 \%) versus the countryside (closest
   distance 2.2 km) even though this was well within the honey bee maximum
   foraging range (c. 12 km). These distances were lower than those from a
   previous study for hives located in a rural area 4.5 km away. Honey bees
   are very sensitive to foraging economics and foragers make waggle dances
   only after visiting high-quality feeding locations. Low distances
   advertised by dances, therefore, indicate sufficient forage nearby and
   show that urban areas can support honey bees year round. As a corollary,
   however, urban bees may provide little pollination service to
   agriculture especially in spring, which had the lowest foraging
   distances and is when the most economically important animal-pollinated
   UK crops, apple and oilseed rape, are in bloom.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees, spiders, earthworms and plants contribute considerably to
   biodiversity in grasslands and fulfil vital ecological functions. They
   also provide valuable services to agriculture, such as pollination, pest
   control and maintenance of soil quality. We investigated the responses
   of wild bees, spiders, earthworms and plants to geographic location,
   agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables using a
   dataset of 357 grassland fields within 88 farms in six European regions.
   Regions and taxonomic groups were selected to have contrasting
   properties, in order to capture the multiple facets of European
   grasslands. Geographic location alone had a dominant effect on the fauna
   and flora communities. Depending on the taxonomic group, various
   agricultural management and surrounding landscape variables alone had an
   additional significant effect on observed species richness, rarefied
   species richness and/or abundance, but it was always small. Bee species
   richness and abundance decreased with increasing number of mechanical
   operations (e.g. cutting). Observed spider species richness and
   abundance were unrelated to measured aspects of agricultural management
   or to surrounding landscape variables, whereas rarefied species richness
   showed significant relations to nitrogen input, habitat diversity and
   amount of grassland habitats in the surroundings. Earthworm abundance
   increased with increasing nitrogen input but earthworm species richness
   did not. Observed plant species richness decreased with increasing
   nitrogen input and increased when there were woody habitats in the
   surroundings. Rarefied plant species richness decreased with mechanical
   operations. Investigating multiple regions, taxonomic groups and aspects
   of fauna and flora communities allowed identifying the main factors
   structuring communities, which is necessary for designing appropriate
   conservation measures and ensuring continued supply of services.}},

Abstract = {{Communication of any sort is complex and communication between plants
   and animals is particularly so. Plant-pollinator mutualisms are amongst
   the most celebrated partnerships that have received a great deal of
   attention for many centuries. At the outset, most pollination studies
   focused on phenotypic matches and invoked co-evolution to explain
   plant-pollinator interactions, which gave rise to the concept of
   pollination syndromes. A few centuries later, there has been a
   substantial shift in the way we view these mutualistic interactions. In
   a significant departure from a co-evolutionary framework, numerous
   studies subsequently showed that there is usually only a loose,
   non-exclusive matching between flowers and their pollinators.
   Concurrently, the global prevalence of generalized pollination systems
   was demonstrated repeatedly. However, our understanding of the
   evolutionary processes that underlie these mutualisms is still limited.
   Here, we provide a concise review of the state of our knowledge on the
   evolution of floral traits and pollinator sensory perception and how
   these together shape the structure and organization of pollination
   networks.}},

Title = {{Flower evolution of alpine forbs in the open top chambers (OTCs) from
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Effects of global changes on biodiversity have been paid more and more
   attention world widely, and the open top chambers (OTCs) are the most
   common tools to study the effects of climatic warming on plant
   diversity. However, it remains unclear how flowers evolve under
   environmental changes, which could help us to understand the changes of
   plant diversity in the OTCs. We compared the insect diversity and
   pollen: ovule (P/O) ratio of eight outcrossing species with different
   life histories inside and outside the OTCs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
   to examine the effects induced by OTCs on the evolution of floral
   traits. In the OTCs, P/O ratio decreased in annuals, but increased in
   perennials, indicating an overall trend toward selfing in annuals. We
   found that the insect diversity differed significantly inside and
   outside the OTCS, with decreases of dipteran insects and bees. We
   concluded that changes of P/O ratio in the studied plant species might
   result from pollination failure, which might be the results of mismatch
   between flowering time and pollinator activities. We also suggested
   annuals might be in a more extinction risk than perennials in OTCs, if
   strong inbreeding depression occurs in these annual outcrossing plants.}},

Title = {{Trees as huge flowers and flowers as oversized floral guides: the role
   of floral color change and retention of old flowers in Tibouchina
   pulchra}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Floral color changes and retention of old flowers are frequently
   combined phenomena restricted to the floral guide or single flowers in
   few-flowered inflorescences. They are thought to increase the
   attractiveness over long distances and to direct nearby pollinators
   toward the rewarding flowers. In Tibouchina pulchra, a massively
   flowering tree, the whole flower changes its color during anthesis. On
   the first day, the flowers are white and on the next 3 days, they change
   to pink. This creates a new large-scale color pattern in which the white
   pre-changed flowers contrast against the pink post-changed ones over the
   entire tree. We describe the spectral characteristics of floral colors
   of T. pulchra and test bumblebees' response to this color pattern when
   viewed at different angles (simulating long and short distances). The
   results indicated the role of different color components in bumblebee
   attraction and the possible scenario in which this flower color pattern
   has evolved. We tested bumblebees' preference for simulated trees with
   75\% pink and 25\% white flowers resembling the color patterns of T.
   pulchra, and trees with green leaves and pink flowers (control) in
   long-distance approach. We also compared an artificial setting with
   three pink flowers and one white flower (T pulchra model) against four
   pink flowers with white floral guides (control) in short-distance
   approach. Bumblebees spontaneously preferred the simulated T. pulchra
   patterns in both approaches despite similar reward. Moreover, in short
   distances, pollinator visits to peripheral, non-rewarding flowers
   occurred only half as frequently in the simulated T pulchra when
   compared to the control. Thefore, this exceptional floral color change
   and the retention of old flowers in T. pulchra favors the attraction of
   pollinators over long distances in a deception process while it honestly
   directs them toward the rewarding flowers at short distances possibly
   exploring their innate color preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring the ability of bacterial plant pathogens to survive in
   insects is required for elucidating unknown aspects of their
   epidemiology and for designing appropriate control strategies. Erwinia
   amylovora is a plant pathogenic bacterium that causes fire blight, a
   devastating disease in apple and pear commercial orchards. Studies on
   fire blight spread by insects have mainly focused on pollinating agents,
   such as honeybees. However, the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly)
   Ceratitis capitata (Diptera: Tephritidae), one of the most damaging
   fruit pests worldwide, is also common in pome fruit orchards. The main
   objective of the study was to investigate whether E. amylovora can
   survive and be transmitted by the medfly. Our experimental results show:
   i) E. amylovora can survive for at least 8 days inside the digestive
   tract of the medfly and until 28 days on its external surface, and ii)
   medflies are able to transmit the bacteria from inoculated apples to
   both detached shoots and pear plants, being the pathogen recovered from
   lesions in both cases. This is the first report on E. amylovora
   internalization and survival in/on C. capitata, as well as the
   experimental transmission of the fire blight pathogen by this insect.
   Our results suggest that medfly can act as a potential vector for E.
   amylovora, and expand our knowledge on the possible role of these and
   other insects in its life cycle.}},

   wing wear, lipid content, and oocyte size}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{During the nesting season, adult females of the solitary bee Megachile
   rotundata (F.) face considerable physical and energy demands that could
   include increasing wear and tear on their bodies and decreasing lipid
   reserves. Consequently, their reproductive performance may be affected
   not only by extrinsic factors (e.g., weather and floral resource
   availability), but intrinsic changes in their own bodies. Because of the
   potential fitness effects of seasonal changes in body condition, our
   objectives were to determine how wing wear, lipid reserves, and oocyte
   sizes vary during nesting seasons, beginning when females emerge as
   adults. As nesting progressed, females in two populations experienced a
   steady increase in wing wear, which is known to reduce foraging
   efficiency and increase risk of mortality in other bees. Soon after
   emergence, females exhibited sharp declines in lipid content which
   remained low for the remainder of the season. Newly-emerged females
   ingested pollen, an activity known to be correlated with the initiation
   of egg maturation in this species. Additionally, the early summer drop
   in lipid stores was correlated with an increase in the size of the
   oocytes carried. However, by similar to 6 weeks after emergence, oocytes
   began to decrease in length and volume, perhaps due to nutrient
   deficiencies related to loss of stored lipids. Our results suggest
   management of M. rotundata should include rearing bees at temperatures
   that maximize stored lipid reserves in adults and timing bee release so
   that significant pollen resources are available for both adults and
   offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of neonicotinoid insecticides on bees is vital
   because of reported declines in bee diversity and distribution(1-3) and
   the crucial role bees have as pollinators in ecosystems and
   agriculture(4). Neonicotinoids are suspected to pose an unacceptable
   risk to bees, partly because of their systemic uptake in plants(5), and
   the European Union has therefore introduced a moratorium on three
   neonicotinoids as seed coatings in flowering crops that attract bees(6).
   The moratorium has been criticized for being based on weak evidence(7),
   particularly because effects have mostly been measured on bees that have
   been artificially fed neonicotinoids(8-11). Thus, the key question is
   how neonicotinoids influence bees, and wild bees in particular, in
   real-world agricultural landscapes(11-13). Here we show that a commonly
   used insecticide seed coating in a flowering crop can have serious
   consequences for wild bees. In a study with replicated and matched
   landscapes, we found that seed coating with Elado, an insecticide
   containing a combination of the neonicotinoid clothianidin and the
   non-systemic pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin, applied to oilseed rape seeds,
   reduced wild bee density, solitary bee nesting, and bumblebee colony
   growth and reproduction under field conditions. Hence, such insecticidal
   use can pose a substantial risk to wild bees in agricultural landscapes,
   and the contribution of pesticides to the global decline of wild
   bees(1-3) may have been underestimated. The lack of a significant
   response in honeybee colonies suggests that reported pesticide effects
   on honeybees cannot always be extrapolated to wild bees.}},

Title = {{Nest Suitability, Fine-Scale Population Structure and Male-Mediated
   Dispersal of a Solitary Ground Nesting Bee in an Urban Landscape}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Bees are the primary pollinators of flowering plants in almost all
   ecosystems. Worldwide declines in bee populations have raised awareness
   about the importance of their ecological role in maintaining ecosystem
   functioning. The naturally strong philopatric behavior that some bee
   species show can be detrimental to population viability through
   increased probability of inbreeding. Furthermore, bee populations found
   in human-altered landscapes, such as urban areas, can experience lower
   levels of gene flow and effective population sizes, increasing potential
   for inbreeding depression in wild bee populations. In this study, we
   investigated the fine-scale population structure of the solitary bee
   Colletes inaequalis in an urbanized landscape. First, we developed a
   predictive spatial model to detect suitable nesting habitat for this
   ground nesting bee and to inform our field search for nests. We
   genotyped 18 microsatellites in 548 female individuals collected from
   nest aggregations throughout the study area. Genetic relatedness
   estimates revealed that genetic similarity among individuals was
   slightly greater within nest aggregations than among randomly chosen
   individuals. However, genetic structure among nest aggregations was low
   (Nei's G(ST) = 0.011). Reconstruction of parental genotypes revealed
   greater genetic relatedness among females than among males within nest
   aggregations, suggesting male-mediated dispersal as a potentially
   important mechanism of population connectivity and inbreeding avoidance.
   Size of nesting patch was positively correlated with effective
   population size, but not with other estimators of genetic diversity. We
   detected a positive trend between geographic distance and genetic
   differentiation between nest aggregations. Our landscape genetic models
   suggest that increased urbanization is likely associated with higher
   levels of inbreeding. Overall, these findings emphasize the importance
   of density and distribution of suitable nesting patches for enhancing
   bee population abundance and connectivity in human dominated habitats
   and highlights the critical contribution of landscape genetic studies
   for enhanced conservation and management of native pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Change in land cover is thought to be one of the key drivers of
   pollinator declines, and yet there is a dearth of studies exploring the
   relationships between historical changes in land cover and shifts in
   pollinator communities. Here, we explore, for the first time, land cover
   changes in England over more than 80 years, and relate them to
   concurrent shifts in bee and wasp species richness and community
   composition. Using historical data from 14 sites across four counties,
   we quantify the key land cover changes within and around these sites and
   estimate the changes in richness and composition of pollinators. Land
   cover changes within sites, as well as changes within a 1 km radius
   outside the sites, have significant effects on richness and composition
   of bee and wasp species, with changes in edge habitats between major
   land classes also having a key influence. Our results highlight not just
   the land cover changes that may be detrimental to pollinator
   communities, but also provide an insight into how increases in habitat
   diversity may benefit species diversity, and could thus help inform
   policy and practice for future land management.}},

Abstract = {{Willows (Salix spp.) are ubiquitous in the northern hemisphere, serving
   as an important pollen and nectar resource for insect pollinators and
   for the enhancement of insect-pollinated agricultural crops such as
   fruits and berries. We used a common-garden field test containing seven
   native North American willow species to assess attractiveness of male
   and female flower catkins by documenting visits of Andrena spp.
   (Apoidea: Anthophila), other wild bees (all native), and flower flies
   (Syrphidae). Most willows in Canada's Maritimes begin flowering very
   early in spring, as the first wild pollinators become active following
   winter, and stop flowering by mid-May. A later-flowering group normally
   begins flowering in mid-May and stops flowering by mid-June. Pollinator
   species were largely opportunistic, visiting whatever species of willow
   flowers were available during foraging, but Andrena dunningi appeared to
   prefer flowers of S. nigra and S. interior. There was a general
   preference for male flower catkins, with 72\% of Andrena spp. and 82\%
   of all flower flies collecting pollen and/or nectar from male flowers,
   because pollen is the major component of nest provisioning for most
   solitary bees and the major source of protein used to develop
   reproductive tissues in most flower flies. Most andrenids and flower
   flies were collected within the April-June flowering period of six of
   the seven willow species studied, indicating that these willows could be
   used to support the pollinator community before the flowering period of
   commercially valuable flower-pollinated crops such as lowbush blueberry,
   cranberry, and apple.}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) self-pollination (i.e., selfing) causes
   inbreeding depression. Determining factors influencing alfalfa seed
   production selfing rates could inform potential mitigation strategies to
   reduce selfing. We measured in situ selfing rates from seed sampled from
   random plants in a commercial alfalfa seed production field pollinated
   by leafcutter bees (Megachile rotundata F.). Alfalfa selfing rates were
   estimated by genotyping similar to 24 progeny from each of 38 maternal
   plants. Maternal plant distance to pollinator domicile, pod position on
   racemes, raceme position on stems, and seeds per pod were noted during
   seed and tissue collection. Selfing rates averaged 11.8\% with
   individual selfing rates ranging from 0\% to 52.2\%. Seed from pods
   collected from upper parts of racemes had lower selfing rates (9.1\%)
   compared to pods from lower parts of racemes (15.1\%). When ``low{''}
   self-compatible (<15\% selfing rate in 3+ seeded pods) and ``high{''}
   self-compatible (>= 15\% selfing rate in 3+ seeded pods) plants were
   examined separately, however, this pattern remained significant only for
   low self-compatible plants (upper raceme selfing rates 3.1\% vs. lower
   raceme 8.3\%). Low self-compatible plants had higher selfing rates in
   1-2 seeded pods (12.9\%) compared to 3+ seeded pods (3.8\%) while high
   self-compatible plants showed no differences in selfing rates based on
   seed number per pod. Genetic differences for self-pollen's ability to
   outcompete outcross pollen when growing down the style best explained
   observed differences between low and high self-compatible plants. Best
   management practices and selection could help reduce but not eliminate
   selfing in alfalfa seed production fields.}},

   behavior is extensive, there has been no direct evidence for the
   repeatability of hummingbird traplines. Here, we show that male
   territorial rufous hummingbirds repeated the order in which they visited
   artificial flowers in an array, which we increased one by one from 2 to
   5 flowers. Despite the large number of possible routes that the birds
   could have flown around the flower arrays, the birds flew only a very
   small subset of routes and those routes were most often the shortest
   distance routes around the flowers. To our knowledge, this is the first
   quantitative evidence that hummingbirds do develop traplines when

Abstract = {{Studies involving aspects of pollination and breeding system in
   Angiosperms are fundamental in understanding many ecological and
   evolutionary processes. Thus, a literature review was conducted to aim
   of compiling information on the pollination and reproductive system in
   species of Acanthaceae Juss. in Brazil. A total of 30 studies, count 31
   species, were part of this review. Regarding geographical distribution
   of studies, the Southeast Brazil (50\%) and Atlantic Forest biome
   (56.7\%) had the higher proportion of studies. Four pollination
   syndromes were recorded: trochilophily, melittophily, psycophily, and
   chiropterophily, in which trochilophily was predominant (79.31\% of
   species). Consequently, hummingbirds were the most common flower
   visitors, interacting with 86.2\% of the species, and Phaethornis
   pretrei was the main hummingbird visitor. Other groups of visitors were
   also recorded, such as bees (second main group, 34.5\%), butterflies,
   bats, moths, wasps, flies and beetles. From the 17 species studied in
   Brazil about the reproductive system, all have androgynous flowers and
   16 species (94.1\%) selfcompatibility. Intrinsic factors such as
   herkogamy and dichogamy were common in species of Acanthaceae,
   constituting mechanisms that minimize interference between male and
   female functions in androgynous flowers and maximize cross-pollination.
   Approximately 41.2\% of species presented spontaneous self-pollination,
   i. e. production of fruits without the need of pollinators. Reproductive
   strategies such as cleistogamy and agamospermy were also recorded in
   species of Acanthaceae in Brazil. However, more studies on the
   pollination and reproductive system with species of Acanthaceae in
   Brazil need to be developed to expand the sampling and then support
   better the estimates of this review.}},

Title = {{The role of pollinators in maintaining variation in flower colour in the
   Rocky Mountain columbine, Aquilegia coerulea}},

Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flower colour varies within and among populations of
   the Rocky Mountain columbine, Aquilegia coerulea, in conjunction with
   the abundance of its two major pollinators, hawkmoths and bumble-bees.
   This study seeks to understand whether the choice of flower colour by
   these major pollinators can help explain the variation in flower colour
   observed in A. coerulea populations.
   Methods Dual choice assays and experimental arrays of blue and white
   flowers were used to determine the preference of hawkmoths and
   bumble-bees for flower colour. A test was made to determine whether a
   differential preference for flower colour, with bumble-bees preferring
   blue and hawkmoths white flowers, could explain the variation in flower
   colour. Whether a single pollinator could maintain a flower colour
   polymorphism was examined by testing to see if preference for a flower
   colour varied between day and dusk for hawkmoths and whether bumble-bees
   preferred novel or rare flower colour morphs.
   Key Results Hawkmoths preferred blue flowers under both day and dusk
   light conditions. Naive bumble-bees preferred blue flowers but quickly
   learned to forage randomly on the two colour morphs when similar rewards
   were presented in the flowers. Bees quickly learned to associate a
   flower colour with a pollen reward. Prior experience affected the choice
   of flower colour by bees, but they did not preferentially visit novel
   flower colours or rare or common colour morphs.
   Conclusions Differences in flower colour preference between the two
   major pollinators could not explain the variation in flower colour
   observed in A. coerulea. The preference of hawkmoths for flower colour
   did not change between day and dusk, and bumble-bees did not prefer a
   novel or a rare flower colour morph. The data therefore suggest that
   factors other than pollinators may be more likely to affect the flower
   colour variation observed in A. coerulea.}},

Title = {{INDIRECT EFFECTS OF HERBIVORY ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{661-668}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Herbivory can affect a plant's fi tness in a
   variety of ways, including modifying the biotic interactions of the
   plant. In particular, when herbivory infl uences fl oral display, we
   hypothesize that pollinator visitation will be altered accordingly. Here
   we studied the indirect effects of feeding by two beetles,
   Neogalerucella calmariensis and N. pusilla, released as a biological
   control, on plant-pollinator interactions and fi tness in the invasive
   plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).
   Methods: Two herbivory treatments (ambient and simulated) were applied
   to plants in a naturally occurring population of purple loosestrife.
   During fl owering, traits of plants in the treatment and control groups
   were recorded. Data on pollinator visitation behavior was then collected
   after intense larval herbivory had ended.
   Key results: Plants exposed to herbivory treatments produced more fl
   owers and infl orescences but fl owered signifi cantly later than those
   in the control group. Moreover, we found a signifi cant, positive
   association of herbivory with the number of fl owers probed by
   bumblebees and with the number of times a foraging pollinator moved
   among infl orescences on a single plant. No differences in female fi
   tness (fruit or seed production) were detected.
   Conclusions: We conclude that herbivore-mediated differences in fl oral
   display traits impacted pollinator visitation behavior. However, as we
   discuss, differences in pollinator visitation did not translate into
   detectable differences in female reproductive success. We postulate that
   herbivory could infl uence other unmeasured aspects of fi tness, such as
   seed quality or the number of seeds sired.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting demographic consequences of climate change for plant
   communities requires understanding which factors influence seed set, and
   how climate change may alter those factors. To determine the effects of
   pollen availability, temperature, and pollinators on seed production in
   the alpine, we combined pollen-manipulation experiments with
   measurements of variation in temperature, and abundance and diversity of
   potential pollinators along a 400-m elevation gradient. We did this for
   seven dominant species of flowering plants in the Coast Range Mountains,
   British Columbia, Canada. The number of viable seeds set by plants was
   influenced by pollen limitation (quantity of pollen received), mate
   limitation (quality of pollen), temperature, abundance of potential
   pollinators, seed predation, and combinations of these factors. Early
   flowering species (n = 3) had higher seed set at high elevation and
   late-flowering species (n = 4) had higher seed set at low elevation.
   Degree-days >15 degrees C were good predictors of seed set, particularly
   in bee-pollinated species, but had inconsistent effects among species.
   Seed production in one species, Arnica latifolia, was negatively
   affected by seed-predators (Tephritidae) at mid elevation, where there
   were fewer frost-hours during the flowering season. Anemone
   occidentalis, a fly-pollinated, self-compatible species had high seed
   set at all elevations, likely due to abundant potential pollinators.
   Simultaneously measuring multiple factors affecting reproductive success
   of flowering plants helped identify which factors were most important,
   providing focus for future studies. Our work suggests that responses of
   plant communities to climate change may be mediated by flowering time,
   pollination syndrome, and susceptibility to seed predators.}},

Abstract = {{The romantic perception of plant-animal mutualisms as a cooperative
   endeavour has been shattered in the last decades. While the classic
   theory of plant-pollinator coevolution assumed that partner coevolution
   is largely mutualistic, an increasing appreciation of the inherent
   conflict of interests between such partners has led to the realization
   that genes that confer a reproductive advantage to plants may have
   negative effects on their pollinators (and vice versa), giving rise to
   an apparent paradox: that antagonistic processes may drive coevolution
   among mutualistic partners. Under this new paradigm, mutualistic
   partners are bound by mutual interest but shaped by ``selfish{''}
   antagonistic processes. Exploitation barriers mediated by resource
   competition among pollinators are a key element of this paradigm.
   Exploitation barriers involve traits such as tubular corollas, red
   flowers, toxic or deterrent rewards, and attractants of floral
   predators. Exploitation barriers result in resource partitioning,
   increasing floral fidelity of favoured pollinators and therefore plant
   fitness; but they often entail a physiological, behavioural or
   developmental cost for such favoured pollinators. Resource partitioning
   mediated by exploitation barriers is a very powerful driver of floral
   diversification, robust to variation in pollinator assemblages; hence,
   it may contribute to elucidating the occurrence of co-evolutionary
   changes in multi-species contexts. Exploitation barriers provide also a
   mechanistic basis for trait-based modelling of interaction networks, and
   represent a reason for caution in assuming fixed interaction identity or
   strength when modelling such networks (e.g. in rarefaction procedures
   used to estimate secondary extinctions). We propose to replace the
   misleading metaphor that depicts flowers and pollinators as cooperative
   partners by a metaphor in which plants and pollinator are traders,
   seeking to obtain different services from each other in complete
   disregard for the benefit of their mutualistic partner.}},

Abstract = {{Floral features that affect the efficiency with which pollinators can
   harvest their resources, or the profitability they obtain from them,
   affect the foraging decisions of pollinators. Foraging choices of
   pollinators, in turn, affect pollen flow: increases in flower constancy
   lead to more efficient pollen transport. It follows that exploitation
   barriers-flower traits that differentially affect net intake rates of
   potential visitors-will promote resource partitioning and enhance pollen
   export. In this paper we first generalise foraging models to show that
   exploitation barriers can lead to partial resource partitioning even
   when flowers are randomly distributed in space. Then we develop a model
   to study how the foraging rules of pollinators, pollen removal and
   pollen deposition, affect pollen flow. The model shows that resource
   partitioning, even incomplete, can substantially increase the efficiency
   of pollen flow. Finally, we use computer simulations to demonstrate that
   exploitation barriers promoting partial resource partitioning can
   evolve. Many of the flower traits associated with pollination syndromes
   have small but consistent effects on the efficiency with which different
   taxonomic groups exploit flowers, and can be considered exploitation
   barriers. Even if these barriers are not strong enough to promote strict
   specialisation, and may have little effect on the female component of
   fitness when pollinators are not a limiting resource, they are likely to
   be selected because they enhance the male component of fitness.}},

Abstract = {{According to the ``nectar protection{''} and ``pollinator protection{''}
   hypotheses, ant repellents in flowers have evolved to prevent ants from
   exploiting floral nectar and chasing away pollinators, respectively. We
   used weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina, to determine the strength of
   ant repellence in 32 bee-pollinated plant species and used the
   comparative method to test whether nectar production, size of
   pollinating bees and plant growth form were related to floral
   repellence. Flowers were more likely to repel ants if they offered
   nectar as a reward and were pollinated by small bees than if they were
   nectarless and pollinated by large bees. Furthermore, tree flowers were
   more likely than shrub or vine flowers to repel ants. Our results
   validate the pollinator protection hypothesis and the nectar protection
   hypothesis. Depending on the ecological context, therefore, ant
   repellents can function as direct or indirect exploitation barriers:
   they can prevent ants from removing nectar without effecting pollination
   (direct barriers) and, when flowers are pollinated by large bees, the
   absence of ant repellents-or even the presence of ant attractants-can
   result in ants chasing small ineffective pollinators away (indirect
   barriers).}},

Abstract = {{Long corollas are a classical example of nectar barriers, because they
   prevent undesired visitors from consuming the reward intended for more
   effective pollinators. As the investment in nectar barriers increases,
   flower attractiveness and nectar rewards may also increase to maintain
   loyal visitation of most effective pollinators; and flowers may become
   more prone to nectar robbing. We evaluated the effect of nectar barriers
   (corolla tube length), two related traits (nectar volume and upper lip
   size) and the associated risk of nectar robbing, on the fecundity of
   Lonicera implexa plants from three populations differing in the
   abundance of its most efficient pollinator, the hummingbird hawkmoth
   Macroglossum stellatarum. Corolla tube length varied most among
   individuals within populations (45-46 \% of total variance) and
   inflorescences within individuals (23-32 \%), and showed little
   variation among populations (0.2-11 \%). Longer corolla tubes were
   always associated with larger nectar volumes and larger upper lips,
   although the strength of the relationships varied across populations and
   years. Robbing frequency increased with corolla tube length, decreased
   with nectar volume and upper lip size, and its weak effects on fecundity
   were predominantly positive. Plant fecundity peaked at two different
   optima: long corollas with little nectar and short corollas with
   abundant nectar. However, the exact shape of the interaction between
   corolla length and nectar volume, as well as the combination of traits
   showing the highest fecundity, differed between populations and years.
   This variation could be explained by among-population differences in
   pollinator assemblages, and inter-annual changes in resources dedicated
   to reproduction. Our study shows that large nectar volumes can modulate
   the effect of corolla length as a nectar barrier, and that the
   combination of these two traits that maximises fecundity may be related
   to the identity of pollinators within each population.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies lasting more than 1 or 2 years are not particularly
   common anywhere and in any taxonomic group. Ecological studies in orchid
   bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are not an exception and have focused on
   short-term scale. Long-term studies have been mostly neglected up to
   date. Orchid-bee males were attracted to five different scent baits in
   the same site every other year during a seven-year span, from 1997 to
   2004, in an urban forest remnant, totaling four full years of samplings
   in between. In total, we captured 2188 bees from 14 species. Species
   diversity, evenness, and richness remained remarkably stable among
   years. The stability index, sensu Wolda, for the composite community
   revealed to be one of the highest ever recorded for insect communities.
   Our results suggest that orchid-bee populations may remain remarkably
   stable over the years even in a small (a parts per thousand 200 ha) area
   immersed in a metropolitan (a parts per thousand 3,000,000 inhabitants)
   matrix and that these urban areas should not be neglected in
   conservation efforts, since they seem to maintain viable populations of
   these important pollinators over time.}},

Abstract = {{Mass-flowering crops may affect long-term population dynamics, but
   effects on pollinators have never been studied across several years. We
   monitored wild bees in oilseed rape fields in 16 landscapes in Germany
   in two consecutive years. Effects on bee densities of landscape oilseed
   rape cover in the years of monitoring and in the previous years were
   evaluated with landscape data from three consecutive years. We fit
   empirical data to a mechanistic model to provide estimates for oilseed
   rape attractiveness and its effect on bee productivity in comparison to
   the rest of the landscape, and we evaluated consequences for pollinator
   densities in consecutive years. Our results show that high oilseed rape
   cover in the previous year enhances current densities of wild bees
   (except for bumble bees). Moreover, we show a strong attractiveness of
   and dilution on (i.e., decreasing bee densities with increasing
   landscape oilseed rape cover) oilseed rape for bees during flowering in
   the current year, modifying the effect of the previous year's oilseed
   rape cover in the case ofwild bees (excluding Bombus). As long as other
   factors such as nesting sites or natural enemies do not limit bee
   reproduction, our findings suggest long-term positive effects of
   mass-flowering crops on bee populations, at least for non-Bombus
   generalists, which possibly help to maintain crop pollination services
   even when crop area increases. Similar effects are conceivable for other
   organisms providing ecosystem services in annual crops and should be
   considered in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Sphaerularia bombi Dufour is a major parasite of bumble bee queens that
   manipulates its host's behavior: parasitized queens do not breed and
   found nests but continue to fly into the early summer months. We
   examined the indirect consequences of this host manipulation on non-host
   workers in central Hokkaido Island, Japan. In this area, parasitism of
   Bombus terrestris by S. bombi is common but does not affect every queen;
   therefore, as summer begins, B. terrestris queens continue to dominate
   some flower patches and disappear from others. At sites dominated by
   parasitized queens, we found that the nectar standing crop of red clover
   was smaller, B. terrestris workers carried out fewer legitimate visits
   to red clover and more nectar robberies, and the workers were smaller
   than at other sites. Removing queens from a site increased the nectar
   standing crop of red clover, the frequency of worker visits to red
   clover, and the size of the workers. These results suggest that host
   manipulation by S. bombi increased competition for flower resources
   among host queens and non-host workers and altered the interaction
   between plants and non-host flower visitors.}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Neotropical rainforests sustain some of the most diverse terrestrial
   communities on Earth. Euglossine (or orchid) bees are a diverse lineage
   of insect pollinators distributed throughout the American tropics, where
   they provide pollination services to a staggering diversity of flowering
   plant taxa. Elucidating the seasonal patterns of phylogenetic assembly
   and functional trait diversity of bee communities can shed new light
   into the mechanisms that govern the assembly of bee pollinator
   communities and the potential effects of declining bee populations. Male
   euglossine bees collect, store, and accumulate odoriferous compounds
   (perfumes) to subsequently use during courtship display. Thus, synthetic
   chemical baits can be used to attract and monitor euglossine bee
   populations. We conducted monthly censuses of orchid bees in three sites
   in the Magdalena valley of Colombia - a region where Central and South
   American biotas converge - to investigate the structure, diversity, and
   assembly of euglossine bee communities through time in relation to
   seasonal climatic cycles. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that
   phylogenetic community structure and functional trait diversity changed
   in response to seasonal rainfall fluctuations. All communities exhibited
   strong to moderate phylogenetic clustering throughout the year, with few
   pronounced bursts of phylogenetic overdispersion that coincided with the
   transition from wet-to-dry seasons. Despite the heterogeneous
   distribution of functional traits (e.g., body size, body mass, and
   proboscis length) and the observed seasonal fluctuations in phylogenetic
   diversity, we found that functional trait diversity, evenness, and
   divergence remained constant during all seasons in all communities.
   However, similar to the pattern observed with phylogenetic diversity,
   functional trait richness fluctuated markedly with rainfall in all
   sites. These results emphasize the importance of considering seasonal
   fluctuations in community assembly and provide a glimpse to the
   potential effects that climatic alterations may have on both pollinator
   communities and the ecosystem services they provide.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Pollination failure has been proposed to be an important determinant of
   plant species' range limits if pollinator activity declines along an
   environmental gradient, directly limiting plant populations, or if plant
   populations decline along an environmental gradient and subsequently
   fail to attract sufficient visitation. Both mechanisms predict reduced
   pollinator visitation, increased pollen limitation and decreased seed
   production towards range limits, and the first additionally predicts
   declining pollinator abundance independent of any particular plant
   species. However, many self-compatible species have some capacity for
   autonomous self-fertilization, which may buffer reproductive success
   from declining pollinator visitation if inbreeding depression is mild.
   Thus pollinator-mediated limits may also predict selection for reduced
   reliance on pollinators towards range limits. We tested these
   predictions towards the high-elevation limit of the self-compatible,
   bumblebee (Bombus)-pollinated Rhinanthus minor, along two elevation
   transects in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada.Bombus abundance was
   highest at mid- (range-centre) and high-elevation (range limit) sites,
   so declining pollinator abundance is unlikely to impose high-elevation
   limits for bumblebee-pollinated species in this area. Flowers per plant
   and per m(2) declined at upper range limits, potentially rendering edge
   populations less attractive. However, visitation rate did not decline
   towards the range limit at either transect. Stigmatic pollen receipt
   declined with increasing elevation, but seed set did not, nor did
   outcross pollen supplementation increase seed set at any site.
   Investment in floral attractiveness (corolla area/ovary area) increased
   towards range limits, but capacity for high-quality autonomous seed set
   and adult inbreeding coefficients inferred from genetic markers were
   uniformly high, suggesting frequent self-fertilization and weak
   inbreeding depression throughout the range.Synthesis. We found no
   evidence for pollination failure towards the upper range limit of
   R.minor. Moreover, unlike some species with a capacity for autogamy,
   autonomous selfing makes a major contribution to R.minor's mating system
   and demography, and likely buffers reproductive success from
   stochasticity in pollination. Continued investment in floral
   attractiveness despite high autonomous selfing suggests some
   evolutionary benefit to pollinator-mediated outcrossing, rather than
   ecological benefits via increasing seed quantity or quality. Given that
   >50\% of angiosperms are self-compatible, the reproductive assurance
   provided by selfing may reduce the importance of pollination in limiting
   plant distributions compared to other biotic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Crambe maritima L. (Sea-kale; Crambe pontica Stev. ex Rupr) that are
   relevant to understand its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The
   main topics are presented within the standard framework of the
   Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat,
   communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment,
   structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters,
   herbivores and disease, history and conservation.Crambe maritima is
   found predominantly on southern and western coasts of Britain but also
   in Scotland, Ireland and elsewhere. It occurs primarily on neutral or
   slightly alkaline soils on shingle and sand beaches above the drift
   line, out of reach of average high tides. Equinoctial tides or storms
   can increase soil salinity, requiring it to be salt tolerant.Crambe
   maritima is a rosette plant with a fleshy taproot, which is the main
   perennating organ with a capacity for vegetative propagation. Flowering
   can take 5-8years when grown from seeds. Reproduction is predominantly
   by seeds. Root and stem cuttings can be used for vegetative propagation.
   In winter, each branch ends at ground level in a leafless crimson bud,
   and in spring, it produces a succession of cabbage-like leaves just
   above ground level, the first being purple and successive leaves
   becoming greener.Crambe maritima produces weakly protogynous
   hermaphrodite flowers. Self- and cross-pollination occurs. Pollination
   is by insects, flies and bees. The plants usually produce 1000-10000
   seeds per year. In Britain, Crambe maritima has been reported to have
   declined in certain areas but increased in other areas and currently
   does not have rare or scarce status. There has been an expansion in
   range in Ireland since the 1960s as it has been recorded at new sites,
   and while the species has disappeared from some sites in France, it has
   also been identified in several new sites.}},

Title = {{Butterfly pollination in Pteroglossa (Orchidaceae, Orchidoideae): a

   Neotropical genus of Spiranthinae}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Spiranthinae orchids are known for being self-compatible and offering
   nectar as a reward. Although data on their pollinators are scarce,
   members of this tribe are mostly pollinated by bees, hummingbirds and
   moths. Some of them even reproduce through facultative self-pollination.
   Nothing is known about the pollinators and reproduction system in
   Pteroglossa. Based on records on flowering phenology, floral morphology,
   reward production, pollinators and breeding system, this paper aims to
   study the reproductive biology of two Pteroglossa spp. Both species
   offer nectar as a resource and are pollinated exclusively by diurnal
   Lepidoptera at the studied areas. Nectar is produced by two glandular
   nectaries, and is stored in a spur. Pollinaria possess a ventrally
   adhesive viscidium that is deposited on the basal portion of butterfly
   proboscides. Both species are self-compatible but pollinator-dependent.
   The reproductive success is low when compared to other Spiranthinae.
   Although no evident mechanical barrier to avoid self-pollination or
   geitonogamy was identified, the erratic behavior of the butterflies,
   with their infrequent visits to only one flower per inflorescence,
   contributes to an increased fruit set produced through
   cross-pollination. The presence of ventrally adhesive viscidia in
   Spiranthinae is responsible for greater pollinator diversity when
   compared to bee-pollinated Goodyerinae with dorsally adhesive viscidia,
   adapted to attach to bee mouthparts.}},

Abstract = {{Inga species are characterised by generalist or mixed pollination
   system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in
   species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some
   ecological and genetic factors are associated with this feature, and to
   test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda
   subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efficacy of polyads deposited on
   stigmas of flowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to
   visitors. The proportion of polyads fixed in stigmas decreased after
   exposure to visitors (24h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from
   visitors (hummingbirds, bees, wasps, hawkmoths and bats), and fruit set
   was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and
   other floral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production,
   sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates
   adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main
   pollinators; although the brush-flower morphology, time of anthesis,
   nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors.
   Thus the species is an important resource for a diverse group of floral
   visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are
   responsible for the decrease in fixed polyads in stigmas of I.subnuda
   subsp. luschnathiana flowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to
   its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not
   result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural
   conditions could be the result of a negative effect of
   visitors/pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Across Europe conservation actions have been implemented to mitigate the
   decline of pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, recent
   concerns have appeared about their efficiency to promote pollinator
   diversity. To increase the efficiency of these interventions, one must
   acquire a better knowledge of the target species diversity patterns and
   its sources of variations at different spatial and temporal scales. This
   study sets out to identify the main sources of variation in wild bee
   assemblages at a regional scale (450 km(2)) in mass-flowering crops and
   semi-natural habitats. During three consecutive sampling years, we
   monitored bee diversity and its temporal and spatial turnovers. We show
   that an intensive agricultural landscape in western France can hold
   nearly 200 wild bee species at a regional scale, i.e. 20 \% of the whole
   bee fauna known in mainland France. Wild bee diversity was 3-4 times
   lower in oleaginous crops than in semi-natural habitats, with a
   substantial number of these being social and gregarious species. Spatial
   and seasonal species turnover in semi-natural habitats explained 28.6
   and 34.3 \%, respectively, of regional species richness. Given the
   importance of the spatial component of the bee diversity turnover, we
   suggest wild bee conservation efforts should be carried out at relevant
   spatial scales. The spatial turnover was estimated to be steeper within
   50 km(2) scales. This provides an order of magnitude for the spatial
   extent of relevant conservation units within which one may concentrate
   conservation efforts in order to optimise the number of species promoted
   per surface area.}},

Abstract = {{Distance and discrete geographic barriers play a role in isolating
   populations, as seed and pollen dispersal become limited. Nearby
   populations without any geographic barrier between them may also suffer
   from ecological isolation driven by habitat heterogeneity, which may
   promote divergence by local adaptation and drift. Likewise, elevation
   gradients may influence the genetic structure and diversity of
   populations, particularly those marginally distributed. Bathysa
   australis (Rubiaceae) is a widespread tree along the elevation gradient
   of the Serra do Mar, SE Brazil. This self-compatible species is
   pollinated by bees and wasps and has autochoric seeds, suggesting
   restricted gene dispersal. We investigated the distribution of genetic
   diversity in six B.australis populations at two extreme sites along an
   elevation gradient: a lowland site (80-216m) and an upland site
   (1010-1100m.a.s.l.). Nine microsatellite loci were used to test for
   genetic structure and to verify differences in genetic diversity between
   sites. We found a marked genetic structure on a scale as small as 6km
   (F-ST=0.21), and two distinct clusters were identified, each
   corresponding to a site. Although B.australis is continuously
   distributed along the elevation gradient, we have not observed a gene
   flow between the extreme populations. This might be related to
   B.australis biological features and creates a potential scenario for
   adaptation to the different conditions imposed by the elevation
   gradient. We failed to find an isolation-by-distance pattern; although
   on the fine scale, all populations showed spatial autocorrelation until
   similar to 10-20m. Elevation difference was a relevant factor though,
   but we need further sampling effort to check its correlation with
   genetic distance. The lowland populations had a higher allelic richness
   and showed higher rare allele counts than the upland ones. The upland
   site may be more selective, eliminating rare alleles, as we did not find
   any evidence for bottleneck.}},

Abstract = {{Plants might be under selection for both attracting efficient
   pollinators and deterring wasteful visitors. Particular floral traits
   can act as exploitation barriers by discouraging the unwelcome visitors.
   In the genus Penstemon, evolutionary shifts from insect pollination to
   more efficient hummingbird pollination have occurred repeatedly,
   resulting in the convergent evolution of floral traits commonly present
   in hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Two of these traits, a reduced or
   reflexed lower petal lip and a narrow corolla, were found in a previous
   flight-cage study to affect floral handling time by bumble bees,
   therefore potentially acting as ``anti-bee{''} traits affecting
   preference. To test whether these traits do reduce bumble bee visitation
   in natural populations, we manipulated these two traits in flowers of
   bee-pollinated Penstemon strictus to resemble hummingbird-adapted close
   relatives and measured the preferences of free-foraging bees.
   Constricted corollas strongly deterred bee visitation in general, and
   particularly reduced visits by small bumble bees, resulting in immediate
   specialization to larger, longer-tongued bumble bees. Bees were also
   deterred-albeit less strongly-by lipless flowers. However, we found no
   evidence that lip removal and corolla constriction interact to further
   affect bee preference. We conclude that narrow corolla tubes and reduced
   lips in hummingbird-pollinated penstemons function as exploitation
   barriers that reduce bee access to nectaries or increase handling time.}},

Abstract = {{The neotropical plant genus Drymonia displays a remarkable variety of
   floral shapes and colors. One feature that is particularly important to
   coevolution with pollinators involves the variable shapes and widths of
   corolla tubes. To evaluate the evolutionary context for changes in
   corolla shape, we constructed a phylogeny of 50 of the 75 species of
   Drymonia using molecular markers from plastid (trnK-matK) and nuclear
   regions (ITS and ETS). Mapping tube shapes on the phylogeny supports
   open, bell-shaped (campanulate) corolla shape as the ancestral character
   state for Drymonia, with multiple independent origins of constriction in
   the corolla tube. Corollas with constrictions take one of three tube
   shapes: a constricted flower opening and throat with a large, expanded
   pouch on the lower surface (hypocyrtoid); a constricted flower opening
   and throat lacking an expanded pouch on the lower surface (urceolate);
   or a constricted opening and throat where the sides of the corolla
   appear laterally compressed. Fieldwork demonstrates euglossine bees
   (mostly Euglossa spp. and Epicharis spp.) visit campanulate corollas
   while hummingbirds visit corollas that are constricted. Results support
   eight independent origins of constricted corolla tubes from ancestors
   with campanulate corolla tubes: 3 hypocyrtoid clades, 3 laterally
   compressed clades, and 3 urceolate clades (one of which represents a
   shift from a hypocyrtoid ancestor). Constricted corollas are associated
   with shifts from the ancestral condition of poricidal anther dehiscence,
   which presents pollen to pollinators in multiple small doses, to the
   derived condition of longitudinal anther dehiscence, which presents all
   pollen to pollinators simultaneously. The association of hummingbird
   pollination with constricted corolla tubes suggests that narrowing
   evolved as a barrier mechanism that prohibits the visitation of flowers
   by bees.}},

Abstract = {{In plant-pollinator networks, the floral morphology of food plants is an
   important determinant of the interaction niche of pollinators. Studies
   on foraging preferences of pollinators combining experimental and
   observational approaches may help to understand the mechanisms behind
   patterns of interactions and niche partitioning within pollinator
   communities. In this study, we tested whether morphological floral
   traits were associated with foraging preferences of hummingbirds for
   artificial and natural flower types in Costa Rica. We performed field
   experiments with artificial feeders, differing in length and curvature
   of flower types, to quantify the hummingbirds' interaction niche under
   unlimited nectar resources. To quantify the interaction niche under
   real-world conditions of limited nectar resources, we measured foraging
   preferences of hummingbirds for a total of 34 plant species. Artificial
   feeders were visited by Eupherusa nigriventris and Phaethornis guy in
   the pre-montane forest, and Lampornis calolaemus in the lower montane
   forest. Under experimental conditions, all three hummingbird species
   overlapped their interaction niches and showed a preference for the
   short artificial flower type over the long-straight and the long-curved
   flower types. Under natural conditions, the two co-occurring hummingbird
   species preferred to feed on plant species with floral traits
   corresponding to their bill morphology. The short-billed hummingbird
   E.nigriventris preferred to feed on short and straight flowers, whereas
   the long- and curved-billed P.guy preferred long and curved natural
   flowers. The medium-size billed species L.calolaemus preferred to feed
   on flowers of medium length and did not show preferences for plant
   species with specific corolla curvature. Our results show that floral
   morphological traits constrain access by short-billed hummingbird
   species to nectar resources. Morphological constraints, therefore,
   represent one important mechanism structuring trophic networks. In
   addition, other factors, such as competition and differences in resource
   quantity or quality, define the interaction niches of consumer species
   in real-world communities, enforcing patterns of niche segregation
   between co-occurring consumer species. This suggests that experimental
   studies are needed to disentangle effects of morphological constraints
   from those of competition for resources in plant-pollinator interactions
   and other types of trophic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive biology in the highly diverse Cactaceae family is described
   in only few species. Given that a large number of species are rare,
   threatened, or endangered, and the entire family is included in Appendix
   II of CITES, the limited knowledge about their reproductive biology is
   of major concern. Mammiliaria pectimfera is an endangered, small,
   globose cactus endemic to the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan region in Central
   Mexico. We aimed to characterize some basic aspects of its reproductive
   biology in three populations. We described flower morphology and
   anthesis, identified floral visitors, and evaluated the occurrence of
   spontaneous self-fertilization and the success of open pollination.
   Diurnal anthesis in flowers lasted about 4 h/day and almost all flowers
   lasted only one day after opening. The analyses of variance revealed
   differences in flower morphology among populations. Herkogamy was
   positive and significantly different among populations. Field
   experiments revealed that open-pollinated flowers were highly successful
   in setting fruits and seeds. These results corroborate those reported in
   other Mammillaria species. Autonomous self-pollination was negligible
   and ineffective. Bees of the genus Ceratina were dominant among the
   captured flower visitors, and estimations of their maximum foraging
   distance indicated successful outcrossing in plants. This study
   indicates almost complete dependency of M. pectinifera on pollinators
   for fruits and seeds production. Our results serve as a basis for future
   research on reproductive biology of M. pectinifera and other rare and
   endangered cacti. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   next-generation sequencing studies, it can become a dominant gut
   resident. Furthermore the presence of some non-core lactobacilli were
   associated with the relative abundance of bifidobacteria. This
   association was not observed in indoor-reared bumblebees lacking the

Abstract = {{Bees, hoverflies and butterflies are taxa frequently studied as
   pollinators in agricultural and conservation contexts. Although there
   are many records of non-syrphid Diptera visiting flowers, they are
   generally not regarded as important pollinators. We use data from 30
   pollen-transport networks and 71 pollinator-visitation networks to
   compare the importance of various flower-visiting taxa as
   pollen-vectors. We specifically compare non-syrphid Diptera and
   Syrphidae to determine whether neglect of the former in the literature
   is justified. We found no significant difference in pollen-loads between
   the syrphid and non-syrphid Diptera. Moreover, there was no significant
   difference in the level of specialization between the two groups in the
   pollen-transport networks, though the Syrphidae had significantly
   greater visitation evenness. Flower visitation data from 33 farms showed
   that non-syrphid Diptera made up the majority of the flower-visiting
   Diptera in the agricultural studies (on average 82\% abundance and 73\%
   species richness), and we estimate that non-syrphid Diptera carry 84\%
   of total pollen carried by farmland Diptera. As important pollinators,
   such as bees, have suffered serious declines, it would be prudent to
   improve our understanding of the role of non-syrphid Diptera as
   pollinators.}},

   pre- and postdefecating larvae thereby making known the mature larva for
   this uncommon Old World genus. Females of O. fasciatus build linear
   nests in existing burrows in dead wood; depending on the length of the
   burrow, 1-5 cells are placed in one nest. The cell partitions are made
   of hardened mud, while the nest plug consists of pebbles fixed together
   with mud. Ochreriades fasciatus is oligolectic on Lamiaceae and probably
   strongly associated with the two related genera Ballota and Moluccella.
   It is hoped that information concerning its nesting biology, host-plant
   relationships, as well as larval development and anatomy will eventually
   prove valuable in determining the phylogenetic position of this genus

Title = {{Spatial Heterogeneity Regulates Plant-Pollinator Networks across
   Multiple Landscape Scales}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 9}},
Abstract = {{Mutualistic plant-pollinator interactions play a key role in
   biodiversity conservation and ecosystem functioning. In a community, the
   combination of these interactions can generate emergent properties,
   e.g., robustness and resilience to disturbances such as fluctuations in
   populations and extinctions. Given that these systems are hierarchical
   and complex, environmental changes must have multiple levels of
   influence. In addition, changes in habitat quality and in the landscape
   structure are important threats to plants, pollinators and their
   interactions. However, despite the importance of these phenomena for the
   understanding of biological systems, as well as for conservation and
   management strategies, few studies have empirically evaluated these
   effects at the network level. Therefore, the objective of this study was
   to investigate the influence of local conditions and landscape structure
   at multiple scales on the characteristics of plant-pollinator networks.
   This study was conducted in agri-natural lands in Chapada Diamantina,
   Bahia, Brazil. Pollinators were collected in 27 sampling units
   distributed orthogonally along a gradient of proportion of agriculture
   and landscape diversity. The Akaike information criterion was used to
   select models that best fit the metrics for network characteristics,
   comparing four hypotheses represented by a set of a priori candidate
   models with specific combinations of the proportion of agriculture, the
   average shape of the landscape elements, the diversity of the landscape
   and the structure of local vegetation. The results indicate that a
   reduction of habitat quality and landscape heterogeneity can cause
   species loss and decrease of networks nestedness. These structural
   changes can reduce robustness and resilience of plant-pollinator
   networks what compromises the reproductive success of plants, the
   maintenance of biodiversity and the pollination service stability. We
   also discuss the possible explanations for these relationships and the
   implications for landscape planning in agricultural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Flowers of an invasive plant species are more visited by native
   birds than flowers of ornithophilous endemic plants.
   Aims To describe the bird guild and its behaviour visiting the century
   plant Agave americana in an insular environment and to determine which
   factors are affecting visitation rates.
   Methods We noted number and species of birds visiting inflorescences on
   Tenerife, Canary Islands. We used multimodel inference of generalized
   linear models to analyse the factors affecting the number of visits and
   the visitor species richness.
   Results Eighty-one per cent of inflorescences were visited by eight
   native bird species. All species fed on nectar and only the Atlantic
   Canary fed also on pollen. Foraging behaviour varied among species.
   Visitation rate increased with density and diversity of birds and flower
   characteristics and decreased through the day. The number of species
   visiting the inflorescences increased with diversity and density of
   birds in the surroundings and decreased through the day.
   Conclusion The native bird community uses the invasive century plant as
   a feeding resource at a higher rate than it uses endemic ornithophilous
   plants. This could have negative effects for the pollination of endemic
   plants, but positive effects for birds.}},

Abstract = {{The reliance of insects on ultraviolet (UV) light in nature is not well
   known, despite a general understanding of how insects detect UV.
   Chamaesyce albomarginata (Torr. \& A. Gray) Small is a mat-forming
   euphorb common in southwestern deserts that produces small, flower-like
   cyathia. The plant's small size, flatness, and abundant insect visitors
   enabled experimentally testing the dependence of flies, bees, and wasps
   flying to the plant on UV light. Most insects landing on plants were
   minute bombyliid flies in Mythicomyia Coquillet, 1893 and Nexus Hall \&
   Evenhuis, 1987, andrenid bees in Perdita Smith, 1853, and sphecid wasps
   in Solierella Spinola, 1851. Ultraviolet light is absorbed by leaves on
   C. albomarginata, reflected slightly more by cyathia, and moderately
   reflected by surrounding substrate. Decreasing UV contrast between
   plants and surrounding substrate by covering substrate with clear
   UV-absorbing film, compared with clear UV-transmitting vinyl, did not
   affect numbers of insects landing on plants. Placing the same film
   approximately 20 cm above plants and surrounding substrate decreased
   numbers of insects landing by 68\% compared with the vinyl. Diptera and
   Hymenoptera responded similarly by flying beneath the UV-absorbing film
   and approaching plants less frequently. Absorbing UV from incident light
   illuminating plants appeared to eliminate a visual cue used by insects
   for locating flowering plants. The most likely visual cue eliminated was
   the pattern of polarized UV in skylight.}},

Abstract = {{The clover seed weevils Apion fulvipes Geoffroy, 1785 and Apion trifolii
   L., 1768 (Coleoptera: Apionidae) cause major losses to seed production
   of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense
   L.), respectively. Clover is important as animal forage and an
   alternative to inorganic fertilizers. Because clover is mainly
   pollinated by bees, the use of insecticides in management of these
   weevils is discouraged. To gain basic knowledge for development of
   alternative management strategies, we investigated weevil field
   abundance over two growing seasons, as well as feeding and olfactory
   host preferences by A. fulvipes and A. trifolii. Field trap catches in
   southern Sweden revealed that white clover was dominated by A. fulvipes
   and red clover by A. trifolii. For both weevil species, female catches
   were positively correlated to the number of clover buds and flowers in
   the field. In feeding and olfactory bioassays, females of A. fulvipes
   and A. trifolii showed a preference for T. repens and T. pratense,
   respectively. However, the feeding preference was lost when the antennae
   were removed, indicating a significant role of olfaction in host choice.
   Male weevils of both species did not show clear olfactory or feeding
   preferences for host plant species. The field study and laboratory
   bioassays demonstrate that, at least for female weevils, olfaction is
   important for selection of host plants. We discuss these novel results
   in the context of managing these important pests of clover by exploiting
   olfaction and behavioral attraction to host plant volatiles.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   When sympatric flowering plant species in a natural community share
   pollinators, study of plant-plant interactions via interspecific pollen
   transfer (IPT) is essential for understanding species coexistence.
   However, little is known about the extent of IPT between interactive
   species and its causes.
   Methods
   To explore how sympatric flowering plants sharing pollinators minimize
   deleterious effects of IPT, we investigated the pollination ecology of
   two endemic species, Salvia przewalskii and Delphinium yuanum, in an
   alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains, southwest China. We quantified
   conspecific and interspecific visits by shared bumblebee pollinators,
   amounts of pollen placed on different body sites of the pollinators and
   stigmatic pollen loads on open-pollinated flowers. To examine whether
   IPT affects female fitness, we measured pollen germination and seed
   production in the two species in an artificial pollination experiment.
   Important Findings
   One bumblebee species, Bombus trifasciatus, was found to be the sole
   effective pollinator for the two coflowering species. Pollination
   experiments indicated that deposition of heterospecific pollen could
   significantly decrease seed set in both species. Experiments showed that
   S. przewalskii pollen could germinate well on stigmas of D. yuanum,
   inhibiting conspecific pollen germination in D. yuanum. However, seed
   set was not lower under open pollination than under cross-pollination
   within species, suggesting that no female fitness loss was caused by
   IPT. In foraging bouts with pollinator switches, switches from S.
   przewalskii to D. yuanum were relatively more frequent (8.27\%) than the
   converse (1.72\%). However, IPT from S. przewalskii to D. yuanum
   accounted for only 1.82\% of total stigmatic pollen loads while the
   reverse IPT to S. przewalskii was 8.70\%, indicating that more switches
   of bumblebees to D. yuanum did not result in higher IPT. By contrast,
   selection for reduced IPT to S. przewalskii would limit pollinator
   switches from D. yuanum. We found that a bumblebee generally carried
   pollen grains from both species but the two species differed in the
   position of pollen placement on the bumblebee's body; S. przewalskii's
   pollen was concentrated on the dorsal thorax while D. yuanum's pollen
   was concentrated ventrally on the head. This differential pollen
   placement along with pollinator fidelity largely reduced IPT between the
   two species with a shared pollinator.}},

Title = {{Does persistence of showy calyces in Limonium leptolobum enhance
   pollinator attraction?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{182-186}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   The calyx, the outermost whorl of a flower (usually green), has been
   considered to function to protect flowers. In some species, however,
   calyces are colorful and retained during seed development. Limonium
   species have been exploited as cut flower crops because the calyces
   persist for several months after the corolla has closed. To explore the
   adaptive significance of the persistent calyx in a desert plant Limonium
   leptolobum, we ask whether persistence of calyces can enhance pollinator
   attraction by enlarging floral displays, increasing reproductive success
   in this self-incompatible species.
   Methods
   The yellow flower of L. leptolobum lasted 1-2 days but its white,
   membranous calyx extended fully after the corolla closed, and persisted
   for over 2 months in the field, making hundreds of `showy flowers' on
   one individual. To examine the ecological function of calyces, we test
   the pollinator attraction hypothesis. In an experimental population, we
   compared the difference in visit frequency and visitor behavior between
   intact inflorescences and inflorescences with their calyces removed on
   the same individual plants.
   Important findings
   In four experimental plots four types of floral visitors were observed
   including bees, butterflies, syrphid flies and day-flying moths. No
   significant preference was observed between calyx-free and intact
   inflorescences for both first arrivals and total visit frequency of all
   types of floral visitors, indicating that the persistence of calyces did
   not make plants more attractive to potential pollinators. The pollinator
   attraction hypothesis for the showy calyces was not supported by the
   current data. Whether the calyx in this desert plant helps seed
   development or has other functions needs further study.}},

Title = {{High ratio of illegitimate visitation by small bees severely weakens the
   potential function of heteranthery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{213-223}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   In heterantherous plants, `division of labor' among structurally
   different stamens, i.e. pollinating and feeding functions, has been
   thought to reduce the evolutionary conflict of relying on pollen both as
   the carrier of male gametes and as the food for pollinators. The key to
   successful division of labor among different sets of stamens is the size
   match between stamens and legitimate pollinators, which results in the
   precise deposition of pollen onto specific locations on pollinator's
   body and facilitates cross pollination. However, the potential impact of
   small illegitimate insects that are ubiquitous during the pollination
   process on the plant reproduction in heterantherous species has been
   largely neglected in previous studies and never been demonstrated
   experimentally.
   Methods
   Here, we investigated the functions of three different types of stamens
   in Commelina communis. The pollinator visitation, pollen removal and
   deposition were compared among flowers with different types of anthers
   emasculated at two natural populations. Moreover, the mating systems of
   C. communis in wild populations were estimated using microsatellite
   markers.
   Important Findings
   Our data showed that the main floral visitors for C. communis at the two
   studied populations were small illegitimate bees rather than legitimate
   pollinators, accounting for 77.5 and 92.2\% of total flower visits,
   respectively. Flower manipulations in C. communis demonstrated that the
   two types of brightly yellow stamens separately functioned as `deceptive
   attraction' and `feeding' functions. Although the brown inconspicuous
   stamens of C. communis with the largest amount of fertile pollen had the
   potential function in offering pollen for cross pollination, the high
   ratio of illegitimate visitation by small bees significantly affected
   the dispersal and deposition of pollen from the pollinating anthers, and
   subsequently decreased the levels of outcrossing (t(m) = 0.23-0.32) in
   wild populations.
   Our work further confirmed that the size match between pollinators and
   the floral morphology is the prerequisite to successfully fulfill the
   functional differentiation among different sets of stamens in
   heterantherous plants. Local high ratio of illegitimate visitation by
   size unmatched insects could significantly weaken the potential
   functions of heteranthery, affecting the dispersal and deposition of
   functional pollen in heterantherous plants and further the whole mating
   systems.}},

Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{Understanding patterns of species diversity at different spatial scales
   is important for adapting management and conservation efforts. We have
   therefore studied wild bee and wasp (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) diversity
   structure in forest landscapes and evaluated the importance of
   conservation management at the local and landscape levels. Surveys were
   conducted at 32 clearcuts in eight landscapes in a managed boreal forest
   region. We assessed the influence of local habitat and landscape
   composition on species richness patterns and the effect of prescribed
   burning and landscape affinity on species composition for all bees and
   wasps as well as ecological and functional groups. The relative
   contribution of alpha and beta diversity on the regional level was
   assessed by diversity partitioning and the beta diversity between
   landscapes further partitioned into components of species turnover and
   nestedness. Bee and wasp species richness increased with high flower
   richness and clearcut size, and species composition differed between
   burned and unburned sites. Thus, flower-rich early-successional sites in
   boreal forest landscapes are important habitats for wild bees and wasps.
   To support this fauna, openness should be maintained for extended
   periods by delaying or avoiding tree plantation at flower-rich spots on
   clearcuts. Beta diversity between landscapes accounted for the greatest
   proportion of the total regional gamma diversity, and over 70\% of this
   diversity was due to species turnover. This implies that in order to
   maintain regional diversity, conservation efforts should be spatially
   dispersed, i.e. applied to every landscape of a few hundred square
   kilometers and adapted to the local species assemblages. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The role of pollinators in floral divergence has long attracted the
   attention of evolutionary biologists. Although abundant studies have
   reported the effect of pollinators on flower-shape variation and plant
   speciation, the influence of pollinators on plant species
   differentiation during rapid radiations and the specific consequences of
   shifts among similar pollinators are not well understood. Here, we
   evaluate the association between pollinators and floral morphology in a
   closely related and recently diversifying clade of Linaria species
   (sect. Supinae subsect. Supinae). Our approach combined pollinator
   observations, functional floral morphometric measures and phylogenetic
   comparative analyses. The fauna visiting Linaria species was determined
   by extensive surveys and categorized by a modularity algorithm, and the
   size and shape of flowers were analysed by means of standard and
   geometric morphometric measures. Standard measures failed to find
   relationships between the sizes of representative pollinators and
   flowers. However, discriminant function analyses of geometric
   morphometric data revealed that pollination niches are finer predictors
   of flower morphologies in Linaria if compared with phylogenetic
   relationships. Species with the most restrictive flowers displayed the
   most slender spurs and were pollinated by bees with larger proboscides.
   These restrictive flower shapes likely appeared more than once during
   the evolutionary history of the study group. We show that floral
   variation can be driven by shifts between pollinators that have been
   traditionally included in a single functional group, and discuss the
   consequences of such transitions for plant species differentiation
   during rapid radiations.}},

Title = {{Natural habitat does not mediate vertebrate seed predation as an

Abstract = {{1. Spillover of beneficial organisms from natural habitats to croplands
   can improve agro-ecosystem services, but wildlife can also negatively
   influence agricultural production. When managing agricultural landscapes
   to conserve biodiversity, we need to understand whether the availability
   of natural habitats increases ecosystem dis-services such as vertebrate
   seed predation to avoid risking higher costs than benefits.
   2. We studied whether vertebrates and their impact in crop seed
   predation are related to the percentage of natural (chaparral) and
   semi-natural habitat (planted forest with native and exotic trees) in an
   agricultural landscape of Israel. We selected 20 almond and 20 sunflower
   study sites within a landscape with varying percentages of natural
   (0-61\%) and semi-natural (0-70\%) habitats within a 1000 m radius of
   their surroundings. We observed birds, trapped rodents (in almond),
   counted seeds and noted feeding marks to obtain seed predation rates, at
   each site. Within the almond crops, we physically excluded birds,
   rodents and both to determine their relative and combined influence on
   seed predation.
   3. Neither vertebrate abundance nor species richness was influenced by
   the percentage of natural habitat. However, bird species richness
   increased with increasing percentage of semi-natural habitat.
   4. Seed predation across both crops was not influenced by natural or
   semi-natural habitat but increased significantly with increasing
   abundance and species richness of birds. This was also reflected by the
   exclusions of birds, vertebrates and both to the almond crop, leading to
   lowest seed predation when both groups were excluded.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Natural or semi-natural habitat did not
   influence the agro-ecosystem dis-service of seed predation by birds and
   rodents. Policymakers should consider promoting agri-environment schemes
   that include the conservation of natural habitats and the management of
   semi-natural habitats adjacent to cropland to enhance agro-ecosystem
   services meditated by beneficial organisms such as natural pest enemies
   and pollinators without fearing increased vertebrate seed predation. In
   order to provide more detailed management recommendations tackling the
   reduction of vertebrate dis-services, their feeding behaviour, metabolic
   needs, behaviour patterns and local abundances should be taken into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports of global declines in pollinator species imply an urgent
   need to assess the abundance of native pollinators and density-dependent
   benefits for linked plants. In this study, we investigated (1)
   pollinator nest distributions and estimated colony abundances, (2) the
   relationship between abundances of foraging workers and the number of
   nests they represent, (3) pollinator foraging ranges, and (4) the
   relationship between pollinator abundance and plant reproduction. We
   examined these questions in an alpine ecosystem in the Colorado Rocky
   Mountains, focusing on four alpine bumble bee species (Bombus balteatus,
   B. flavifrons, B. bifarius, and B. sylvicola), and two host plants that
   differ in their degrees of pollinator specialization (Trifolium
   dasyphyllum and T. parryi).
   Using microsatellites, we found that estimated colony abundances among
   Bombus species ranged from; similar to 18 to 78 colonies/0.01 km(2). The
   long-tongued species B. balteatus was most common, especially high above
   treeline, but the subalpine species B. bifarius was unexpectedly
   abundant for this elevation range. Nests detected among sampled foragers
   of each species were correlated with the number of foragers caught.
   Foraging ranges were smaller than expected for all Bombus species,
   ranging from 25 to 110 m. Fruit set for the specialized plant, Trifolium
   parryi, was positively related to the abundance of its Bombus
   pollinator. In contrast, fruit set for the generalized plant, T.
   dasyphyllum, was related to abundance of all Bombus species. Because
   forager abundance was related to nest abundance of each Bombus species
   and was an equally effective predictor of plant fecundity, forager
   inventories are probably suitable for assessing the health of
   outcrossing plant populations. However, nest abundance, rather than
   forager abundance, better reflects demographic and genetic health in
   populations of eusocial pollinators such as bumble bees. Development of
   models incorporating the parameters we have measured here (nest
   abundance, forager abundance, and foraging distance) could increase the
   usefulness of foraging worker inventories in monitoring, managing, and
   conserving pollinator populations.}},

Abstract = {{Without full knowledge of the reproductive biology of endemic species,
   the chances of effective conservation decline. We conducted multi-year
   field and laboratory studies of the sexual system and reproductive
   biology of Solanum vespertilio. Flowers are tetramerous, zygomorphic,
   heterantherous and sometimes enantiostylous. The species is
   andromonoecious. Anthers are heteromorphic in both sex forms, with one
   long upcurved and three straight shorter anthers. The style in male
   flowers is short to vestigial; in hermaphrodites it is strongly
   up-turned, longer than the anthers. The single large anther bears 45 \%
   of the pollen. Some of these unusual features may illustrate insular
   release from selection, though, given the antiquity of the Canaries;
   they likely constitute selection to promote effective sexual
   reproduction and outcrossing. Experiments with manually deflected styles
   showed higher fruit set than controls. The nascent expression of
   enantiostyly offers the opportunity for understanding its evolution. The
   species is weakly self-compatible, which may offer fertility insurance,
   or be remnant of the status of colonizers. Field observations suggest
   that the number of fruit developing in an inflorescence affects the
   gender of subsequent flowers. Thus, the strength of andromonoecy may
   both affect the rate of outcrossing (genetic issues), and/or constitute
   a mechanism for response to the level of fruit set
   (physiological/ecological issues). Flowers were buzz-pollinated by
   large-bodied native bees. Most of the unusual features of S. vespertilio
   presumably promote effective pollen transport and perhaps outcrossing.
   Effective conservation programs depend not only on protecting habitat,
   but also on fruit set; the latter is dependent on knowledge of
   pollination and reproductive biology.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in the pollinator performance of flower visitor sexes are
   rarely considered. In bumble bees, males differ from workers in
   morphology and behaviour in ways that may affect their contribution to
   pollination. We compared the abundance, foraging behaviour, and pollen
   transfer ability of worker and male bumble bees on late-blooming
   Gentiana parryi (Gentianaceae) in subalpine meadows of the Colorado
   Rocky Mountains. Male bees mostly outnumbered female workers throughout
   blooming of the gentian. Males and workers foraged similarly, though
   individual males were more faithful to small foraging areas than
   workers. During single flower visits, males and workers caused similar
   levels of pollen deposition and seed production, yet female bees left
   fewer pollen grains in anthers to be transferred to other stigmas in the
   plant population. Overall, male bumble bees are common and capable
   pollinators of G. parryi and in some years and sites could be more
   important than workers. Male bumble bees may be important but
   unrecognized pollinators of other late-season plant species, and animal
   sexes may differ in their pollinator performance in other systems.}},

Abstract = {{AimBiogeographers typically assess patterns of diversity across
   landscapes. As interacting groups often exhibit contrasting trends, this
   leads to variation in the structure of interaction networks and thereby
   influences ecosystem processes. Here we aim to disentangle how patterns
   of diversity differ between species (plants, pollinators) and their
   interactions across an agricultural landscape. The region is known for
   its irrigated gardens which appear as high-diversity islands in the
   mountainous habitat. We are interested in whether this local enhancement
   was (a) increasing landscape heterogeneity by supporting novel species
   or (b) increasing local diversity by supporting higher densities of
   species that also occur in the unmanaged habitat.
   LocationSouth Sinai, Egypt.
   MethodsWe compared alpha diversity of plants, pollinators and
   interactions in agricultural gardens and plots of unmanaged habitat in
   two altitudinal categories, high and low mountains, with high and low
   habitat quality in the matrix respectively. We then used similarity
   analyses involving the C-qN measure to compare levels of turnover across
   the landscape.
   ResultsThe impact of the gardens differed with respect to the landscape
   context; in the low mountains, gardens enhanced the abundance and
   diversity of plants, pollinators and interactions, but in the high
   mountains, they had no effect. Plants exhibited high levels of turnover,
   with gardens increasing heterogeneity by supporting novel crop species.
   In contrast, pollinators exhibited low levels of turnover, with gardens
   and unmanaged habitat supporting similar species. The diversity of
   interactions was influenced by the composition of the plant community
   and showed extremely high levels of turnover.
   Main conclusionsPlants, pollinators and their interactions can display
   contrasting patterns of turnover across a shared landscape. Although the
   enhancement of local habitat can boost pollinator diversity, the
   maintenance of habitat heterogeneity may also be required if you aim to
   conserve the diversity of interactions between plants and pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Social bee colonies can allocate their foraging resources over a large
   spatial scale, but how they allocate foraging on a small scale near the
   colony is unclear and can have implications for understanding colony
   decision-making and the pollination services provided. Using a
   mass-foraging stingless bee, Scaptotrigona pectoralis (Dalla Torre)
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini), we show that colonies will forage
   near their nests and allocate their foraging labor on a very fine
   spatial scale at an array of food sources placed close to the colony. We
   counted the foragers that a colony allocated to each of nine feeders
   containing 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0M sucrose solution {[}31, 43, and 55\%
   sucrose (wt/wt), respectively] at distances of 10, 15, and 20m from the
   nest. A significantly greater number of foragers (2.6-5.3 fold greater)
   visited feeders placed 10 vs. 20m away from the colony. Foraging
   allocation also corresponded to food quality. At the 10-m feeders,
   4.9-fold more foragers visited 2.0M as compared to 1.0M sucrose feeders.
   Colony forager allocation thus responded to both differences in food
   distance and quality even when the travel cost was negligible compared
   to normal colony foraging distances (10 m vs. an estimated 800-1710m).
   For a nearby floral patch, this could result in unequal floral
   visitation and pollination.}},

Abstract = {{AimWe take a comparative phylogeographical approach to assess whether
   three species involved in a specialized oil-rewarding pollination system
   (i.e. Lysimachia vulgaris and two oil-collecting bees within the genus
   Macropis) show congruent phylogeographical trajectories during
   post-glacial colonization processes. Our working hypothesis is that
   within specialized mutualistic interactions, where each species relies
   on the co-occurrence of the other for survival and/or reproduction,
   partners are expected to show congruent evolutionary trajectories,
   because they are likely to have followed parallel migration routes and
   to have shared glacial refugia.
   LocationWestern Palaearctic.
   MethodsOur analysis relies on the extensive sampling of 104 Western
   Palaearctic populations (totalling 434, 159 and 74 specimens of
   Lysimachiavulgaris, Macropiseuropaea and Macropisfulvipes,
   respectively), genotyped with amplified fragment length polymorphism.
   Based on this, we evaluated the regional genetic diversity (Shannon
   diversity and allele rarity index) and genetic structure (assessed using
   structure, population networks, isolation-by-distance and spatial
   autocorrelation metrics) of each species. Finally, we compared the
   general phylogeographical patterns obtained.
   ResultsContrary to our expectations, the analyses revealed
   phylogeographical signals suggesting that the investigated organisms
   demonstrate independent post-glacial trajectories as well as distinct
   contemporaneous demographic parameters, despite their mutualistic
   interaction.
   Main conclusionsThe mutualistic partners investigated here are likely to
   be experiencing distinct and independent evolutionary dynamics because
   of their contrasting life-history traits (e.g. dispersal abilities), as
   well as distinct hubs and migration routes. Such conditions would
   prevent and/or erase any signature of co-structuring of lineages in
   space and time. As a result, the lack of phylogeographical congruence
   driven by differences in life-history traits might have arisen
   irrespective of the three species having shared similar Pleistocene
   glacial refugia.}},

   cells in Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata, in an area of Caatinga, within
   the municipality of Nova Soure, Bahia State, Brazil. The analysis of

   corresponding to four botanical families. Malpighiaceae was represented
   most, followed by Leguminosae, Ochnaceae, and Solanaceae, the latter two
   represented by just a single pollen type each. On the basis of the
   percentages in the samples, it was possible to infer that C. tarsata
   visited distinct plants, but intensified its pollen collection in
   species related to Aeschynomene martii and Solanum paniculatum pollen
   types, which are considered the most important pollen sources in the
   larval diet of this bee. In addition to the pollen sources, we have also
   recorded seven pollen types regarded as oil ones, all related to the

Volume = {{184}},
Pages = {{51-58}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator populations have suffered severe declines in many
   industrialised countries due to reduced floral and nesting resources,
   brought on by agricultural intensification. One potential method of
   mitigating these effects is creating flower strips. Most previous
   studies have shown higher pollinator abundances in flower strips, but
   none have been able to demonstrate increased pollinator abundances at
   larger spatial scales, in the surrounding agricultural landscapes. We
   assessed local and landscape-wide effects of flower strips on pollinator
   abundances, using 18 carefully selected study landscapes in southern
   Sweden, distributed along independent gradients of landscape
   heterogeneity and farming intensity. We found that flower strips were
   more attractive than field borders in general to bumblebees, whereas
   hoverflies were only attracted to flower strips from nearby field
   borders. Solitary bees declined with increasing distance from flower
   strips, but only in complex landscapes. As one of the first studies
   investigating effects of flower strips on pollinators across the wider
   landscape, we found increased abundance of bumblebees, but not solitary
   bees, in field borders outside the flower strips in floristically
   enhanced landscapes as compared with control landscapes. However, we
   found that higher quality and/or larger total area of flower strips
   within a farm was important for both bumblebees and solitary bees.
   Hoverfly abundance was enhanced on farms with flower strips in simple
   landscapes. Our results demonstrate that flower strips with rewarding
   plants do not only attract pollinators locally, but in addition have the
   potential to increase pollinator abundances across entire landscapes,
   and particularly in landscapes dominated by farmland. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Profiling crop pollinators: life history traits predict habitat use and
   crop visitation by Mediterranean wild bees}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{742-752}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Wild pollinators, bees in particular, may greatly contribute to crop
   pollination and provide a safety net against declines in commercial
   pollinators. However, the identity, life history traits, and
   environmental sensitivities of main crop pollinator species have
   received limited attention. These are crucial for predicting pollination
   services of different communities and for developing management
   practices that enhance crop pollinators. We sampled wild bees in three
   crop systems (almond, confection sunflower, and seed watermelon) in a
   mosaic Israeli Mediterranean landscape. Bees were sampled in
   field/orchard edges and interiors, and in seminatural scrub surrounding
   the fields/orchards. We also analyzed land cover at 50-2500 m radii
   around fields/orchards. We used this data to distinguish crop from
   non-crop pollinators based on a set of life history traits (nesting,
   lecty, sociality, body size) linked to habitat preference and crop
   visitation. Bee abundance and species richness decreased from the
   surrounding seminatural habitat to the field/orchard interior,
   especially across the seminatural habitat-field edge ecotone. Thus,
   although rich bee communities were found near fields, only small
   fractions crossed the ecotone and visited crop flowers in substantial
   numbers. The bee assemblage in agricultural fields/orchards and on crop
   flowers was dominated by ground-nesting bees of the tribe Halictini,
   which tend to nest within fields. Bees' habitat preferences were
   determined mainly by nesting guild, whereas crop visitation was
   determined mainly by sociality. Lecty and body size also affected both
   measures. The percentage of surrounding seminatural habitat at 250-2500
   m radii had a positive effect on wild bee diversity in field edges, for
   all bee guilds, while at 50-100 m radii, only aboveground nesters were
   positively affected. In sum, we found that crop and non-crop pollinators
   are distinguished by behavioral and morphological traits. Hence,
   analysis of life-history traits of bee communities can help assess the
   pollination services they are likely to provide (when taking into
   account single-visit pollination efficiency). The ecotone between
   agricultural fields and surrounding habitats is a major barrier that
   filters many bee species, particularly with regard to their nesting
   requirements. Thus, greater attention should be given to management
   practices that encourage pollinators to live and nest, and not only
   forage, within fields.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-mediated evolutionary divergence has seldom been explored in
   generalist clades because it is assumed that pollinators in those clades
   exert weak and conflicting selection. We investigate whether pollinators
   shape floral diversification in a pollination generalist plant genus,
   Erysimum. Species from this genus have flowers that appeal to broad
   assemblages of pollinators. Nevertheless, we recently reported that it
   is possible to sort plant species into pollination niches varying in the
   quantitative composition of pollinators. We test here whether floral
   characters of Erysimum have evolved as a consequence of shifts among
   pollination niches. For this, we quantified the evolutionary lability of
   the floral traits and their phylogenetic association with pollination
   niches. As with pollination niches, Erysimum floral traits show weak
   phylogenetic signal. Moreover, floral shape and color are
   phylogenetically associated with pollination niche. In particular,
   plants belonging to a pollination niche dominated by long-tongued large
   bees have lilac corollas with parallel petals. Further analyses suggest,
   however, that changes in color preceded changes in pollination niche.
   Pollinators seem to have driven the evolution of corolla shape, whereas
   the association between pollination niche and corolla color has probably
   arisen by lilac-flowered Erysimum moving toward certain pollination
   niches for other adaptive reasons.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have found high levels of cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and
   lead (Pb) in honey bee hives located near urbanized or industrial areas.
   Insect herbivores and pollinators may come in contact with environmental
   contaminants in the leaves and flowers they forage upon in these areas.
   Our study quantified which of these metals are accumulated in the
   tissues of a common weedy plant that can serve as a route of exposure
   for insects. We grew Raphanus sativus (crop radish) in semi-hydroponic
   sand culture in the greenhouse. Plants were irrigated with nutrient
   solutions containing Cd, Cu, or Pb at four concentrations (control, low,
   medium, high). Plant performance, floral traits, and metal accumulation
   were measured in various vegetative and reproductive plant organs.
   Floral traits and flower number were unaffected by all metal treatments.
   Copper accumulated at the highest concentrations in flowers compared to
   the other two metals. Copper and Cd had the highest translocation
   indices, as well as higher bioconcentration factors compared to Pb,
   which was mostly immobile in the plant. Copper posed the highest risk
   due to its high mobility within the plant. In particular, accumulation
   of metals in leaves and flowers suggests that herbivores and pollinators
   visiting and foraging on these tissues may be exposed to these
   potentially toxic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural practice across Europe and North America have
   been associated with range contractions and local extinction of
   bumblebees (Bombus spp.). A number of agri-environment schemes have been
   implemented to halt and reverse these declines, predominantly revolving
   around the provision of additional forage plants. Although it has been
   demonstrated that these schemes can attract substantial numbers of
   foraging bumblebees, it remains unclear to what extent they actually
   increase bumblebee populations. We used standardized transect walks and
   molecular techniques to compare the size of bumblebee populations
   between Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) farms implementing
   pollinator-friendly schemes and Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) control
   farms. Bumblebee abundance on the transect walks was significantly
   higher on HLS farms than ELS farms. Molecular analysis suggested maximum
   foraging ranges of 566m for Bombus hortorum, 714m for B. lapidarius,
   363m for B. pascuorum and 799m for B.terrestris. Substantial differences
   in maximum foraging range were found within bumblebee species between
   farm types. Accounting for foraging range differences, B.hortorum (47 vs
   13 nests/km(2)) and B.lapidarius (45 vs 22 nests/km(2)) were found to
   nest at significantly greater densities on HLS farms than ELS farms.
   There were no significant differences between farm type for B.terrestris
   (88 vs 38 nests/km(2)) and B.pascuorum (32 vs 39 nests/km(2)). Across
   all bumblebee species, HLS management had a significantly positive
   effect on bumblebee nest density. These results show that targeted
   agri-environment schemes that increase the availability of suitable
   forage can significantly increase the size of wild bumblebee
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-environment schemes have been implemented across the European Union
   in order to reverse declines in farmland biodiversity. To assess the
   impact of these schemes for bumblebees, accurate measures of their
   populations are required. Here, we compared bumblebee population
   estimates on 16 farms using three commonly used techniques: standardised
   line transects, coloured pan traps and molecular estimates of nest
   abundance. There was no significant correlation between the estimates
   obtained by the three techniques, suggesting that each technique
   captured a different aspect of local bumblebee population size and
   distribution in the landscape. Bumblebee abundance as observed on the
   transects was positively influenced by the number of flowers present on
   the transect. The number of bumblebees caught in pan traps was
   positively influenced by the density of flowers surrounding the trapping
   location and negatively influenced by wider landscape heterogeneity.
   Molecular estimates of the number of nests of Bombus terrestris and B.
   hortorum were positively associated with the proportion of the landscape
   covered in oilseed rape and field beans. Both direct survey techniques
   are strongly affected by floral abundance immediately around the survey
   site, potentially leading to misleading results if attempting to infer
   overall abundance in an area or on a farm. In contrast, whilst the
   molecular method suffers from an inability to detect sister pairs at low
   sample sizes, it appears to be unaffected by the abundance of forage and
   thus is the preferred survey technique.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator mutualistic networks represent the ecological context
   of foraging (for pollinators) and reproduction (for plants and some
   pollinators). Plant-pollinator visitation networks exhibit highly
   conserved structural properties across diverse habitats and species
   assemblages. The most successful hypotheses to explain these network
   properties are the neutrality and biological constraints hypotheses,
   which posit that species interaction frequencies can be explained by
   species relative abundances, and trait mismatches between potential
   mutualists respectively. However, previous network analyses emphasize
   the prediction of metrics of qualitative network structure, which may
   not represent stringent tests of these hypotheses. Using a newly
   documented temporally explicit alpine plant-pollinator visitation
   network, we show that metrics of both qualitative and quantitative
   network structure are easy to predict, even by models that predict the
   identity or frequency of species interactions poorly. A variety of
   phenological and morphological constraints as well as neutral
   interactions successfully predicted all network metrics tested, without
   accurately predicting species observed interactions. Species phenology
   alone was the best predictor of observed interaction frequencies.
   However, all models were poor predictors of species pairwise interaction
   frequencies, suggesting that other aspects of species biology not
   generally considered in network studies, such as reproduction for
   dipterans, play an important role in shaping plant-pollinator visitation
   network structure at this site. Future progress in explaining the
   structure and dynamics of mutualistic networks will require new
   approaches that emphasize accurate prediction of species pairwise
   interactions rather than network metrics, and better reflect the biology
   underlying species interactions.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{124}},

Abstract = {{The risks imposed by novel insecticides, mainly bioinsecticides, are
   largely unknown despite their increased use and their perceived
   environmental safety, which is based on their natural origin.
   Furthermore, unlike honeybees, native pollinator species have received
   little attention. In the present study, the lethal and sublethal effects
   of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the bioinsecticide spinosad were
   assessed in the stingless bee species Melipona quadrifasciata, an
   important native pollinator in the Neotropical region. The adult
   stingless bee workers exhibited high oral insecticide susceptibility,
   with LD(50)s of 23.54 and 12.07 ng a.i./bee for imidacloprid and
   spinosad, respectively. Imidacloprid also impaired worker respiration
   and overall group activity and flight, while spinosad significantly
   impaired only worker flight despite exhibiting higher oral toxicity to
   adult workers than imidacloprid. These findings indicate the hazardous
   nature not only of imidacloprid but also the bioinsecticide spinosad to
   adult workers of the native pollinator M. quadrifasciata. Therefore,
   bioinsecticides should not be exempted from risk assessment analysis due
   to their lethal and sublethal components. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two Neotropical subgenera of Coelioxys Latreille are revised. The
   monotypic C. (Platycoelioxys) Mitchell and C. (Rhinocoelioxys) Mitchell
   has seven valid species; six of them (C. agilis Smith, C. barbata
   Schwarz \& Michener, C. clypearis Friese, C. nasidens Friese, C.
   paraguayensis Schrottky and C. zapoteca Cresson) previously described,
   and one, C. platygnatha Rocha-Filho \& Packer n. sp. is new from
   Amazonas State, Brazil. Coelioxys nasidens, previously considered a
   junior synonym of C. clypeata Smith, is resurrected. Coelioxys
   crassiceps Friese and C. excisa Friese are synonymized under C. agilis,
   and C. rostrata Friese is synonymized under C. paraguayensis. Nine names
   (C. clypeata, C. leucochrysea Cockerell, C. angustivalva Holmberg, C.
   doelloi Holmberg, C. blabera Holmberg, C. mesopotamica Holmberg, C.
   bilobata Friese, C. bilobata schenki Friese and C. bullaticeps Friese)
   are synonymized with C. zapoteca. In the latter species the shape of the
   apical margin of the clypeus of the female varies widely and, though
   intermediates occur among all forms, the DNA barcode sequences for the
   different forms are very similar. One species formerly considered as
   incertae sedis, C. clypearis, and one belonging to the subgenus C.
   (Cyrtocoelioxys) Mitchell, C. barbata, are both assigned to the subgenus
   C. (Rhinocoelioxys). Keys for both sexes of C. (Rhinocoelioxys),
   distribution maps, host and floral records, redescriptions of species
   and the description of a new species are provided. In the subgenus C.
   (Platycoelioxys), only one species, C. alatiformis Friese, is recognized
   with two junior synonyms: C. crassiceps Friese syn. nov. and C.
   spatuliventer Cockerell.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Abstract = {{The causes of bee declines remain hotly debated, particularly the
   contribution of neonicotinoid insecticides. In 2013 the UK's Food \&
   Environment Research Agency made public a study of the impacts of
   exposure of bumblebee colonies to neonicotinoids. The study concluded
   that there was no clear relationship between colony performance and
   pesticide exposure, and the study was subsequently cited by the UK
   government in a policy paper in support of their vote against a proposed
   moratorium on some uses of neonicotinoids. Here I present a simple
   re-analysis of this data set. It demonstrates that these data in fact do
   show a negative relationship between both colony growth and queen
   production and the levels of neonicotinoids in the food stores collected
   by the bees. Indeed, this is the first study describing substantial
   negative impacts of neonicotinoids on colony performance of any bee
   species with free-flying bees in a field realistic situation where
   pesticide exposure is provided only as part of normal farming practices.
   It strongly suggests that wild bumblebee colonies in farmland can be
   expected to be adversely affected by exposure to neonicotinoids.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators provide a crucial ecosystem service, but are under
   threat. Urban areas could be important for pollinators, though their
   value relative to other habitats is poorly known. We compared pollinator
   communities using quantified flower-visitation networks in 36 sites
   (each 1 km(2)) in three landscapes: urban, farmland and nature reserves.
   Overall, flower-visitor abundance and species richness did not differ
   significantly between the three landscape types. Bee abundance did not
   differ between landscapes, but bee species richness was higher in urban
   areas than farmland. Hoverfly abundance was higher in farmland and
   nature reserves than urban sites, but species richness did not differ
   significantly. While urban pollinator assemblages were more homogeneous
   across space than those in farmland or nature reserves, there was no
   significant difference in the numbers of rarer species between the three
   landscapes. Network-level specialization was higher in farmland than
   urban sites. Relative to other habitats, urban visitors foraged from a
   greater number of plant species (higher generality) but also visited a
   lower proportion of available plant species (higher specialization),
   both possibly driven by higher urban plant richness. Urban areas are
   growing, and improving their value for pollinators should be part of any
   national strategy to conserve and restore pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of secondary metabolites is a hallmark of plant defence
   against herbivores. These compounds may be detrimental to consumers, but
   can also protect herbivores against parasites. Floral nectar commonly
   contains secondary metabolites, but little is known about the impacts of
   nectar chemistry on pollinators, including bees. We hypothesized that
   nectar secondary metabolites could reduce bee parasite infection. We
   inoculated individual bumblebees with Crithidia bombi, an intestinal
   parasite, and tested effects of eight naturally occurring nectar
   chemicals on parasite population growth. Secondary metabolites strongly
   reduced parasite load, with significant effects of alkaloids, terpenoids
   and iridoid glycosides ranging from 61 to 81\%. Using microcolonies, we
   also investigated costs and benefits of consuming anabasine, the
   compound with the strongest effect on parasites, in infected and
   uninfected bees. Anabasine increased time to egg laying, and Crithidia
   reduced bee survival. However, anabasine consumption did not mitigate
   the negative effects of Crithidia, and Crithidia infection did not alter
   anabasine consumption. Our novel results highlight that although
   secondary metabolites may not rescue survival in infected bees, they may
   play a vital role in mediating Crithidia transmission within and between
   colonies by reducing Crithidia infection intensities.}},

   Genotyping}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Background In plants, reproductive success is largely determined by the
   composition of pollen (i.e., self-pollen and outcross-pollen from near
   and distant pollen-donors) transported as a result of pollinator
   foraging behavior (e.g., pollen carryover). However, little evidence is
   available on how and to what extent the pollen carryover affects the
   pollen-donor composition and on which insect taxa are effective
   outcross-pollen transporters under field conditions. In this study, we
   explored roles of foraging behavior of insect pollinators on
   pollen-donor composition and subsequent reproductive success in a woody
   plant.
   Methods We performed paternity analyses based on microsatellite
   genotyping of individual pollen grains found on diurnal pollinators
   (i.e., bumblebee, small bee, fly, small beetle, and honeybee) visiting
   Castanea crenata trees.
   Results The outcross-pollen rate was highest in bumblebees (66\%),
   followed by small bees (35\%), flies (31\%), and small beetles (18\%).
   The effective number of pollen donors, representing pollen carryover,
   was greater in bumblebees (9.71) than in flies (3.40), small bees
   (3.32), and small beetles (3.06). The high percentages of pollen from
   outside the plot on bumblebees (65.4\%) and flies (71.2\%) compared to
   small bees (35.3\%) and small beetles (13.5\%) demonstrated their longer
   pollen dispersal distances.
   Conclusions All of the diurnal insects carried outcross-pollen grains
   for long distances via pollen carryover. This fact suggests that a wide
   range of insect taxa are potential outcross-pollen transporters for the
   self-incompatible C. crenata.}},

   Verdict?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Society is increasingly concerned with declining wild bee populations.
   Although most bees nest in the ground, considerable effort has centered
   on installing `bee hotels'-also known as nest boxes or trap nests-which
   artificially aggregate nest sites of above ground nesting bees.
   Campaigns to `save the bees' often promote these devices despite the
   absence of data indicating they have a positive effect. From a survey of
   almost 600 bee hotels set up over a period of three years in Toronto,
   Canada, introduced bees nested at 32.9\% of sites and represented 24.6\%
   of more than 27,000 total bees and wasps recorded (47.1\% of all bees
   recorded). Native bees were parasitized more than introduced bees and
   females of introduced bee species provisioned nests with significantly
   more female larva each year. Native wasps were significantly more
   abundant than both native and introduced bees and occupied almost 3/4 of
   all bee hotels each year; further, introduced wasps were the only group
   to significantly increase in relative abundance year over year. More
   research is needed to elucidate the potential pitfalls and benefits of
   using bee hotels in the conservation and population dynamics of wild
   native bees.}},

Abstract = {{The oil-collecting hair morphology and pilosity on female foretarsi for
   all 26 species of the southern African endemic bee genus Rediviva was
   studied and related to host plant use based on about 2700 flower
   visitation records. Four different types of tarsal pilosity and six
   principal hair types are identified. Rediviva bees collect floral oil
   from 12 plant genera representing the families Iridaceae, Orchidaceae,
   Scrophulariaceae and Stilbaceae, with Diascia being the most frequently
   used host. Differences in foretarsal pilosity reflect the availability
   of floral oil and elaiophore morphology of the principal host flowers.
   Rediviva species with short female forelegs exhibit a greater diversity
   of tarsal oil-collecting pilosity than long-legged species. This
   contradicts an earlier hypothesis that the pilosity of species with
   shorter legs might be less complex than in Rediviva with elongate
   forelegs.}},

Abstract = {{The Tibetan plateau and its immediately surrounding mountains include
   the greatest hotspot of diversity worldwide for bumblebees, which are
   among the most important pollinators in temperate ecosystems. We make
   the first quantitative description of variation in the species
   composition of alpine social bumblebee faunas across the Tibetan
   plateau, for 44 species in 124 of the 307 one-degree grid cells. Data
   were compiled from field surveys, published sources and museum
   collections. Sampling effort could not be standardized across the region
   so our inferences have to be provisional. Faunal variation is described
   using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA); the faunal variation
   explained by climate variation is described using canonical correlation
   analysis (CCA); and the contribution of the climate data to the
   explanation is assessed using Procrustes analysis. Results show: (1) a
   particularly distinct group of endemic Himalayan faunas in the south;
   (2) a group of Tibetan interior faunas, with connections to faunas in
   the north-west in the Hindu Kush, Pamir and Tian Shan; and (3) a group
   of faunas in north-eastern Qinghai and Gansu, with connections to faunas
   to the north-east in Mongolia. The eastern and southern faunas in wetter
   habitats appear to be closer to equilibrium with climate factors,
   whereas some western faunas in more arid habitats appear further from
   equilibrium with the measured climate factors. One possibility is that
   these western faunas may depend on highly localized factors for
   mitigating the low precipitation over much of this region, and
   particularly on continuous summer streams with meltwater from distant
   permanent glaciers or high-ridge precipitation. Consequently,
   conservation threats to Tibetan bumblebees now include climate change
   causing loss of permanent streams in the west as well as the
   over-grazing documented in the east, threats that have not been major
   concerns for bumblebee conservation elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Extremely long proboscides are rare among butterflies outside of the
   Hesperiidae, yet representatives of several genera of skipper
   butterflies possess proboscides longer than 50mm. Although extremely
   elongated mouthparts can be regarded as advantageous adaptations to gain
   access to nectar in deep-tubed flowers, the scarcity of long-proboscid
   butterflies is a phenomenon that has not been adequately accounted for.
   So far, the scarceness was explained by functional costs arising from
   increased flower handling times caused by decelerated nectar intake
   rates. However, insects can compensate for the negative influence of a
   long proboscis through changes in the morphological configuration of the
   feeding apparatus. Here, we measured nectar intake rates in 34 species
   representing 21 Hesperiidae genera from a Costa Rican lowland rainforest
   area to explore the impact of proboscis length, cross-sectional area of
   the food canal and body size on intake rate. Long-proboscid skippers did
   not suffer from reduced intake rates due to their large body size and
   enlarged food canals. In addition, video analyses of the flower-visiting
   behaviour revealed that suction times increased with proboscis length,
   suggesting that long-proboscid skippers drink a larger amount of nectar
   from deep-tubed flowers. Despite these advantages, we showed that
   functional costs of exaggerated mouthparts exist in terms of longer
   manipulation times per flower. Finally, we discuss the significance of
   scaling relationships on the foraging efficiency of butterflies and why
   some skipper taxa, in particular, have evolved extremely long
   proboscides.}},

Abstract = {{Beneficial insects (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) associated with
   stinging nettles, Urtica dioica Linnaeus (Urticaceae), were sampled at
   three sites in central Washington during spring-summer 2011-2013 using
   transparent sticky traps attached to upper portions of plants. Large
   numbers (200-400/trap) of beneficial insects were trapped particularly
   in June and early July, gradually decreasing thereafter. Phytophagous
   insects (aphids and leafhoppers) were trapped in much lower numbers (<
   20/trap). Predatory bugs, carnivorous flies, parasitic wasps
   (Pteromalidae, Eulophidae, Trichogrammatidae, Scelionidae) and native
   bees dominated the trap catches. Predatory bugs were the most abundant
   beneficial insects trapped in 2 years (2011, 2013) with parasitic wasps
   dominant in 2012. Minute pirate bugs, Orius spp. (Anthocoridae) were
   dominant, accounting for > 95\% of predatory bugs, peaking in abundance
   in June or July. Predacious flies were dominated by species of Empididae
   and Dolichopodidae. Native bees were commonly trapped, especially in
   2011 and 2012. The data presented here indicate that stinging nettles in
   the Yakima Valley of eastern Washington may provide an important habitat
   for beneficial insects and may have a role to play in enhancing
   conservation biological control in agricultural crops.}},

Title = {{EFFECTS OF FLORAL METAL ACCUMULATION ON FLORAL VISITOR COMMUNITIES:
   INTRODUCING THE ELEMENTAL FILTER HYPOTHESIS}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{379-389}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: For plant species that occur in heavy-metal-rich
   soil, floral metal accumulation may produce an ``elemental filter{''}
   that reduces pollinator visitation rate and species richness and changes
   pollinator species composition relative to closely related species
   growing on normal soils. Consequently, metal hyperaccumulation may
   contribute to pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation between closely
   related plant species that differ in metal accumulation.
   Methods: To test these ideas, we characterized plant-pollinator
   interactions in a sympatric pair of species that differ in metal
   accumulation (Streptanthus polygaloides, a nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator,
   and S. tortuosus, a nonaccumulator). To test the elemental filter
   hypothesis, we presented arrays of Streptanthus polygaloides that were
   grown in either Ni-treated or control soils to insects at both
   Streptanthus polygaloides and S. tortuosus sites and recorded
   visitation.
   Key results: Naturally occurring Streptanthus polygaloides
   hyperaccumulated Ni in anthers and accumulated Ni in nectar, while S.
   tortuosus did not. Floral visitation rates in natural populations were
   higher to S. tortuosus than Streptanthus polygaloides. In addition,
   while floral visitor richness was similar, few pollinator taxa were
   shared between the two plant species. Nickel-treatment of Streptanthus
   polygaloides reduced visits by bees, but only for arrays presented at S.
   tortuosus sites.
   Conclusions: We show that the Ni hyperaccumulator S. polygaloides hosts
   a distinct floral visitor community, indicating that metal accumulation
   creates a filter for pollinators, similar to that documented for
   herbivores. Our study highlights a novel mechanism by which the abiotic
   environment can alter plant-pollinator interactions, and consequently
   plant reproduction and speciation.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{191-199}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Many animals learn skills that can take a long time to acquire. Such
   learned skills may have high payoffs eventually, but during the period
   of learning their net profitability is low. When there are other options
   available, it is not clear how animals decide to learn how to perform
   tasks that initially have low or no benefits. Bees in particular visit
   many types of flowers that vary in the time required to learn how to
   access their food rewards. We used bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) to
   address how individuals decide to persevere with learning to handle
   `complex' flowers. We tested two hypotheses: (1) individuals have
   unlearned preferences for more complex flowers; (2) individuals use the
   absolute reward value of the flower to decide whether to learn to handle
   a particular flower type. We presented individual bees with mixed arrays
   of colour-distinct `simple' and `complex' flowers, either containing the
   same value of reward, or where the complex flowers contained twice the
   concentration of sucrose as the simple flowers. Foragers did not show
   any unlearned preferences towards the complex flowers, but instead
   preferred the simple flowers. The strongest initial preferences were for
   flower colour (purple over pink). Our second hypothesis was supported,
   because when the purple complex flowers contained a higher reward than
   the simple flowers, more bees persevered with visiting them, foraging on
   them exclusively by the end of the test period. There was significant
   variation between individuals in whether they learned to handle, and how
   much they visited, complex flowers. These results highlight the complex
   interplay between unlearned biases and environmental feedback in making
   decisions about what to learn. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Bee-pollinated plants face the dilemma that bees do not only transport
   pollen grains between flowers as pollen vectors but also collect large
   amounts of pollen that is withdrawn from pollination. Here, we show that
   pollen of the common hollyhock, Alcea rosea, is mechanically protected
   against collection by corbiculate bees. In a laboratory setup,
   bumblebees did not collect the large, sticky, and spinose pollen grains
   of A. rosea from artificial flowers unless following manipulation of the
   spines or the pollenkitt. Following removal of the sticky pollenkitt or
   bending the spines by vortexing the bumblebees readily collected the
   pollen. Our results show that the pollen of A. rosea is not
   bitter-tasting or toxic, but mechanically protected by the spines
   against being collected by corbiculate bees. Light microscopic
   (LM)-micrographs indicate that the long spines of malvaceous pollen
   grains are not covered by pollenkitt suggesting a new mechanism of
   mechanical defense against collection: pollenkitt-free spines and
   lipophilic pollenkitt prevent compacting pollen grains into pollen
   storage organs of corbiculate bees. The experimental data fit to
   observations at flowers of A. rosea and other malvaceous plants that

Abstract = {{The Neotropical savanna is characterized by a set of different
   phytophysiognomies occurring in a wide expanse of Brazilian lands. Based
   on the known higher diversity of orchid bees in forests rather than in
   savanna formations, we hypothesized that the occurrence of forest
   formations inside the Brazilian savanna increases the diversity of
   euglossine bees in that domain and that there are species more
   associated with these environments. To test this hypothesis, we sampled
   the euglossine fauna in eight forest and woody savanna remnants and
   analyzed their community structure. We sampled 1,010 males of 13 species
   of orchid bees. Bee abundance and species richness ranged from 30 to 341
   individuals and from 4 to 12 species, respectively. The forest remnants
   showed the highest diversity indices and species richness. Our data
   suggest that some species of Euglossa are mainly associated with forest
   remnants. We concluded that environmental heterogeneity in the
   Neotropical savanna contributes to higher diversity of euglossine and
   that some species are more frequently found in forested habitats.
   Additionally, considering that some sampled species are typical of the
   Atlantic and Amazon forests, our data reinforce the hypothesis that
   forest environments inside the Brazilian savanna can be considered
   bio-corridors for orchid bees.}},

Abstract = {{Bombus (Megabombus) koreanus (Skorikov) is a long-tongued bumblebee that
   specialises in visiting deep flowers. To describe the distribution,
   colour-pattern variation and food plants of B. koreanus, we collected

   Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of barcodes for Megabombus species shows
   that B. koreanus is one of the more recently diverged species and the
   sister species to Bombus consobrinus. Our results show that specimens
   with previously unknown colour patterns also belong to B. koreanus. We
   describe nine different colour patterns for workers and three for
   queens, in which the hair of the thorax varies from black to
   orange-brown. However, there is a lack of covariation between COI and
   colour-pattern variation. B. koreanus has been recorded to visit 11
   species of food plants showing that B. koreanus is polylectic. Our
   results demonstrate that COI barcoding is an effective method for

Abstract = {{Plant-plant interspecific competition via pollinators occurs when the
   flowering seasons of two or more plant species overlap and the
   pollinator fauna is shared. Negative sexual interactions between species
   (reproductive interference) through improper heterospecific pollen
   transfer have recently been reported between native and invasive species
   demonstrating pollination-driven competition. We focused on two native
   Impatiens species (I.noli-tangere and I.textori) found in Japan and
   examined whether pollinator-mediated plant competition occurs between
   them. We demonstrate that I.noli-tangere and I.textori share the same
   pollination niche (i.e., flowering season, pollinator fauna, and
   position of pollen on the pollinator's body). In addition,
   heterospecific pollen grains were deposited on most stigmas of both
   I.noli-tangere and I.textori flowers that were situated within 2m of
   flowers of the other species resulting in depressed fruit set. Further,
   by hand-pollination experiments, we show that when as few as 10\% of the
   pollen grains are heterospecific, fruit set is decreased to less than
   half in both species. These results show that intensive
   pollinator-mediated competition occurs between I.noli-tangere and
   I.textori. This study suggests that intensive pollinator-mediated
   competition occurs in the wild even when interacting species are both
   native and not invasive.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of the effects of invasive plants on
   native species requires identification of both the mechanisms of
   interaction and the spatial scale over which they act. Indirect
   interactions involving mobile organisms such as pollinators are likely
   to be scale-dependent, yet most studies examining effects of invasive
   species on pollination of native plants have considered effects across a
   single distance between interacting species. We examined the effects of
   the invasive herb Lupinus polyphyllus on pollination of two native herbs
   using multiple distances between the invasive and the natives. We
   recorded pollinator visitation and seed production in the native herbs
   Lotus corniculatus and Lychnis viscaria at 0, 5 m or 200 m away from L.
   polyphyllus. To reduce the influence of confounding factors, we used
   experimentally established populations of the invasive and potted
   individuals of the natives. In the immediate vicinity to L. polyphyllus,
   visitation to L. corniculatus was higher than 200 m away, and seed
   production per flower was higher than 5 m and 200 m away. In L.
   viscaria, bumblebee visitation was higher adjacent to L. polyphyllus
   than 5 m and 200 m away, but total pollinator visitation and
   reproductive success did not vary with distance. The results indicate
   that L. polyphyllus facilitates pollination of the native plants, and
   that this occurs at a very local spatial scale as effects dropped off
   already at a distance of 5 m. Presence of L. polyphyllus could benefit
   both pollinators and pollination of native herbs, and these positive
   effects should be considered along with likely negative effects due to
   resource competition. Moreover, the results illustrate the necessity to
   consider scale-dependent effects when assessing the impact of invasive
   flowering plants on native pollination interactions.}},

   in small carpenter bees suggest major barriers to back-dispersal}},

Abstract = {{AimInequality between rates of forward and backward dispersal is one
   mechanism that will produce regional differences in biotic composition.
   Any such differences will affect ecosystem assembly. Thus, it is
   important to understand why unequal dispersal rates might occur. Recent
   studies have indicated strong differences between forward and backward
   dispersal in two major bee groups, Hylaeinae and Allodapini. Here, we
   use a third bee group, tribe Ceratinini, to determine whether this might
   be a more general phenomenon.
   LocationWorldwide.
   MethodsCeratinini is globally distributed (excepting Antarctica) and
   contains the single genus Ceratina and 21 subgenera, most of which are
   endemic to continents. We examined the phylogeny of Ceratinini using
   sequence data from three genes and 99 species, and inferred ancestral
   distributions using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches.
   ResultsWe show that the tribe Ceratinini had an African origin in the
   early Eocene. This was followed by four dispersals out of Africa in the
   Eocene and early Oligocene and three further dispersals between the
   Miocene and the present. There has been no back-dispersal of Ceratinini
   to Africa. The lack of back-dispersal cannot be explained by species
   abundance in non-African regions, and physical barriers to
   back-dispersal seem unlikely.
   Main conclusionsOur results are similar to findings for two other major
   bee groups and indicate that back-dispersal is very rare. It is unlikely
   that physical barriers can explain these patterns. However, dispersal
   patterns might be explained by assembly rules such as niche pre-emption
   or by reduced opportunities for escaping into enemy-free space. At a
   continental level, it is likely that the composition of bee fauna is
   more strongly influenced by very early dispersal events rather than by
   later physical barriers to dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Plant strategies frequently vary from opportunistic pollination to
   specialization to single pollinators within the same community.
   Unraveling the proximate mechanisms that determine the degree of plant
   generalization to pollinators has become a primary goal of pollination
   ecology. Color signaling is a potentially important mechanism because it
   is well established that many pollinators use color stimuli to locate
   food items. Until now, studies on the importance of color signaling in
   structuring pollination networks have not considered floral coloration
   as it is perceived by pollinators. Here, we use a framework recently
   developed for network analyses to compare the relative importance of
   color matching (i.e. the degree of phenotypic matching between flower
   coloration and pollinators' visual system) and other variables
   (phylogeny, co-abundance and spatiotemporal overlap between plants and
   pollinators) for plant generalization. We analyzed 25 000 visits in
   three temperate regions. We show that color matching in combination with
   spatiotemporal overlap or co-abundance significantly influences plant
   generalization in one of the three regions. We suggest that intense
   human activities in two regions have decreased the mean level of color
   matching, potentially disrupting the communication between plants and
   pollinators. This study illuminates how the sensory ecology of
   pollinators contributes to structure a highly diversified pollination
   network.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination systems differ in pollen transfer efficiency, a variable
   that may influence the evolution of flower number. Here we apply a
   comparative approach to examine the link between pollen transfer
   efficiency and the evolution of inflorescence size in food and sexually
   deceptive orchids. We examined pollination performance in nine
   food-deceptive, and eight sexually deceptive orchids by recording pollen
   removal and deposition in the field. We calculated correlations between
   reproductive success and flower number (as a proxy for resources
   allocated during reproductive process), and directional selection
   differentials were estimated on flower number for four species. Results
   indicate that sexually deceptive species experience decreased pollen
   loss compared to food-deceptive species. Despite producing fewer
   flowers, sexually deceptive species attained levels of overall
   pollination success (through male and female function) similar to
   food-deceptive species. Furthermore, a positive correlation between
   flower number and pollination success was observed in food-deceptive
   species, but this correlation was not detected in sexually deceptive
   species. Directional selection differentials for flower number were
   significantly higher in food compared to sexually deceptive species. We
   suggest that pollination systems with more efficient pollen transfer and
   no correlation between pollination success and number of flowers
   produced, such as sexual deception, may allow the production of
   inflorescences with fewer flowers that permit the plant to allocate
   fewer resources to floral displays and, at the same time, limit
   transpiration. This strategy can be particularly important for
   ecological success in Mediterranean water-deprived habitats, and might
   explain the high frequency of sexually deceptive species in these
   specialised ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Pollination syndromes in a specialised plant-pollinator interaction:
   does floral morphology predict pollinators in Calceolaria?}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{551-557}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pollination syndromes are defined as suites of floral traits evolved in
   response to selection imposed by a particular group of pollinators
   (e.g., butterflies, hummingbirds, bats). Although numerous studies
   demonstrated their occurrence in plants pollinated by radically
   different pollinators, it is less known whether it is possible to
   identify them within species pollinated by one functional pollinator
   group. In such a framework, we expect floral traits to evolve also in
   response to pollinator subgroups (e.g., species, genera) within that
   unique functional group. On this, specialised pollination systems
   represent appropriate case studies to test such expectations.
   Calceolaria is a highly diversified plant genus pollinated by
   oil-collecting bees in genera Centris and Chalepogenus. Variation in
   floral traits in Calceolaria has recently been suggested to reflect
   adaptations to pollinator types. However, to date no study has
   explicitly tested that observation. In this paper, we quantitatively
   test that hypothesis by evaluating the presence of pollination syndromes
   within the specialised pollination system formed by several Calceolaria
   and their insect pollinators. To do so, we use multivariate approaches
   and explore the structural matching between the morphology of 10
   Calceolaria taxa and that of their principal pollinators. Our results
   identify morphological matching between floral traits related to access
   to the reward and insect traits involved in oil collection, confirming
   the presence of pollinator syndromes in Calceolaria. From a general
   perspective, our findings indicate that the pollination syndrome concept
   can be also extended to the intra-pollinator group level.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming is commonly associated with increased pollinator
   diversity and abundance, but the net effects on pollination rates are
   less documented. Besides, organic farms are often surrounded by more
   diverse landscapes than conventional farms, such that the contributions
   of landscape diversity vs. farming practices to pollination rates are
   often confounded with each other. Here, the roles of local vs. landscape
   scale variables on pollination rates of experimental plants are examined
   in agricultural landscapes. To this end, fruit set and seed production
   were measured in the obligate insect-pollinated Lotus corniculatus.
   Plants were located in pairs of neighboring organic vs. conventional
   farms, which were characterized by contrasting landscape structures and
   compositions. Fruit set, a proxy for pollinator visitation rates, was
   significantly related to landscape variables: fruit set was higher in
   farms close to a patch of semi-natural habitat, but lower in landscapes
   with a high cover of semi-natural habitats. Fruit set also correlated
   with local variables, such as habitat type, but not with farming type.
   Identical pollination rates in conventional and organic farms are likely
   due to similar diversities of habitats, crops and weeds in both farming
   types of the study area. These results therefore confirm that habitat
   diversity prevails over pesticide-free practices to explain the higher
   pollinator abundances usually observed in organic vs. conventional
   farms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{AN ULTRAVIOLET FLORAL POLYMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY DRIVES
   POLLINATOR DISCRIMINATION IN MIMULUS GUTTATUS}},

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{396-406}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Ultraviolet (UV) floral patterns are common in
   angiosperms and mediate pollinator attraction, efficiency, and
   constancy. UV patterns may vary within species, yet are cryptic to human
   observers. Thus, few studies have explicitly described the distribution
   or ecological significance of intraspecific variation in UV floral
   patterning. Here, we describe the geographic distribution and pattern of
   inheritance of a UV polymorphism in the model plant species Mimulus
   guttatus (Phrymaceae). We then test whether naturally occurring UV
   phenotypes influence pollinator interactions within Mimulus guttatus.
   Methods: We document UV patterns in 18 annual and 19 perennial
   populations and test whether UV pattern is associated with life history.
   To examine the pattern of inheritance, we conducted crosses within and
   between UV phenotypes. Finally, we tested whether bee pollinators
   discriminate among naturally occurring UV phenotypes in two settings:
   wild bee communities and captive Bombus impatiens.
   Key results: Within Mimulus guttatus, perennial populations exhibit a
   small bulls-eye pattern, whereas a bilaterally symmetric runway pattern
   occurs mainly in annual populations. Inheritance of UV patterning is
   consistent with a single-locus Mendelian model in which the runway
   phenotype is dominant. Bee pollinators discriminate against unfamiliar
   UV patterns in both natural and controlled settings.
   Conclusions: We describe a widespread UV polymorphism associated with
   life history divergence within Mimulus guttatus. UV pattern influences
   pollinator visitation and should be considered when estimating
   reproductive barriers between life history ecotypes. This work develops
   a new system to investigate the ecology and evolution of UV floral
   patterning in a species with extensive genomic resources.}},

Abstract = {{Male Neotropical orchid bees collect volatile chemicals from various
   sources in the environment in order to compose their characteristic
   perfume bouquets. Amongst other plants, over 600 species of orchids are
   exclusively pollinated by the bees during their quest for volatiles.
   Since the plants usually have a scattered distribution, it is assumed
   that orchid bees can transport the pollinaria across several kilometres
   due to their flight capabilities and a high dispersal potential. Until
   now, very long-range flight distances (up to 45 km) of male orchid bees
   have only been indirectly inferred from habitat requirements of orchids
   whose pollinaria were carried by captured males, whereas the distances
   established by direct measures (mark and recapture, radio telemetry)
   only span distances of up to around 6 km. The discrepancy between
   inferred and proven distances led us to readdress the question of
   dispersal ability of male orchid bees. In this study, we used tag,
   scratch and chemical marking of large numbers of bees to clarify two
   aspects: (1) the effect of moderate natural obstacles on dispersal and
   (2) the possibility of very long-range movements across a terrain
   lacking such obstacles. Our results suggest that a moderate natural
   obstacle (a valley separating opposite ridges) does not restrain orchid
   bee movements. Individual bees achieved extraordinary flight distances
   of more than 50 km across even terrain, extending the directly proven
   flight distances of male bees by more than an order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{The honey bee, the world's most important agricultural pollinator,
   relies exclusively on plant-derived foods for nutrition. Nectar and
   pollen collected by honey bees are processed and matured within the nest
   through the activities of honey bee-derived microbes and enzymes. In
   order to better understand the contribution of the microbial community
   to food processing in the honey bee, we generated a metatranscriptome of
   the honey bee gut microbiome. The function of the microbial community in
   the honey bee, as revealed by metatranscriptome sequencing, resembles
   that of other animal guts and food-processing environments. We
   identified three major bacterial classes that are active in the gut
   (-Proteobacteria, Bacilli and Actinobacteria), all of which are
   predicted to participate in the breakdown of complex macromolecules
   (e.g. polysaccharides and polypeptides), the fermentation of component
   parts of these macromolecules, and the generation of various
   fermentation products, such as short-chain fatty acids and alcohol. The
   ability of the microbial community to metabolize these carbon-rich food
   sources was confirmed through the use of community-level physiological
   profiling. Collectively, these findings suggest that the gut microflora
   of the honey bee harbours bacterial members with unique roles, which
   ultimately can contribute to the processing of plant-derived food for
   colonies.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of reduced mowing on wildflower bloom and
   flower-visiting insects in the Saltdean Oval, a 6ha suburban public park
   in Saltdean, UK. In 2012, a novel management regime was initiated in
   which approximately half the grass area was left uncut, with the plan
   being to mow it once per year in autumn. In spring 2013, we set up four
   blocks, with each block subdivided into four 30x5m strips treated under
   different mowing regimes: (a) regular mowing every 2weeks all spring and
   summer, (b) regular mowing until 2 June, (c) regular mowing until 5
   July, and (d) no mowing. The abundance of both flowers and
   flower-visiting insects increased significantly with reduced mowing,
   being ca. 3 and 5 times greater in (d) than (a), respectively, with (b)
   and (c) intermediate. Mowing intensity, however, had a weak effect on
   wildflower species richness, which was only lower in (a). A 1km bee,
   butterfly, and moth transect walk, 500m within the long grass part of
   the park and 500m within the short, recorded ca. 50x greater insect
   abundance in the long grass. A questionnaire of public opinion found
   that 97\% of park visitors favoured encouraging insects and wildflowers.
   In terms of enjoyment of the park, 26\% said that it had increased, 64\%
   said that it stayed the same, and 10\% said that it decreased. These
   results present an encouraging example of a potential win-win situation
   in urban land management change, where the interests of humans and
   wildlife are aligned, thereby making the goals of conservation easier to
   achieve.}},

Abstract = {{Mitigation tools aimed at counteracting the loss of farmland insect
   diversity and associated ecosystem services are usually conducted on
   cultivated fields. Possibilities of managing field-forest ecotones for
   biodiversity have been rarely discussed, despite their importance for
   flower-visiting insects. The effectiveness of logging in enhancing three
   aspects of insect diversity (bumblebee abundance, total species
   richness, and habitat specialist butterfly abundance) and changes in
   insect community composition were studied in a three-year field
   experiment. The study included 15 field-forest ecotones, each with a 50m
   long and 25 m wide treated area and a corresponding control. At forest
   edge, a 5m wide strip was clear-cut and behind this strip, a 20m wide
   belt was thinned to a basal area of 8m(2)ha(-1). Logging simultaneously
   promoted all three aspects of insect diversity. Changes were more
   apparent at clear-cut edge than in the thinned interior. Community
   composition changed via increased abundance of open habitat species,
   especially butterflies. Logging promoted warm microclimates and flower
   availability at clear-cut edges. All three aspects of insect diversity
   showed a positive response to flower coverage, which in turn was
   negatively correlated with the amount of logging residue. Creating open
   field-forest ecotones is beneficial for flower-visiting insects and open
   habitat species in particular. This approach is expected to be most
   beneficial at sunny forest edges and sites which become overgrown
   slowly. In addition, we suggest logging residue to be removed when
   aiming to promote flower-visitors.}},

Title = {{Evaluating multiplexed next-generation sequencing as a method in

Abstract = {{The identification of pollen plays an important role in ecology,
   palaeo-climatology, honey quality control and other areas. Currently,
   expert knowledge and reference collections are essential to identify
   pollen origin through light microscopy. Pollen identification through
   molecular sequencing and DNA barcoding has been proposed as an
   alternative approach, but the assessment of mixed pollen samples
   originating from multiple plant species is still a tedious and
   error-prone task. Next-generation sequencing has been proposed to avoid
   this hindrance. In this study we assessed mixed pollen probes through
   next-generation sequencing of amplicons from the highly variable,
   species-specific internal transcribed spacer 2 region of nuclear
   ribosomal DNA. Further, we developed a bioinformatic workflow to analyse
   these high-throughput data with a newly created reference database. To
   evaluate the feasibility, we compared results from classical
   identification based on light microscopy from the same samples with our
   sequencing results. We assessed in total 16 mixed pollen samples, 14
   originated from honeybee colonies and two from solitary bee nests. The
   sequencing technique resulted in higher taxon richness (deeper
   assignments and more identified taxa) compared to light microscopy.
   Abundance estimations from sequencing data were significantly correlated
   with counted abundances through light microscopy. Simulation analyses of
   taxon specificity and sensitivity indicate that 96\% of taxa present in
   the database are correctly identifiable at the genus level and 70\% at
   the species level. Next-generation sequencing thus presents a useful and
   efficient workflow to identify pollen at the genus and species level
   without requiring specialised palynological expert knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on phenology, breeding system and dependence on
   pollinators of two sympatric Dichorisandra species. Dichorisandra
   incurva is a chamaephyte with continuous growth and precocious
   flowering, whereas D. hexandra is a geophyte with seasonal growth and
   delayed flowering. Flowering and fruiting occur mainly in the wet
   season; thus moisture can be important for both species. Besides
   moisture, photoperiod seems also to be related to the flowering only of
   D. incurva. Flowers of both species are poricidal, oligandrous,
   zygomorphic and buzz-pollinated by Apidae and/or Halictidae bees.
   Dichorisandra incurva is self-compatible, while D. hexandra shows a
   late-acting self-incompatible system. Moreover, herkogamy and poricidal
   anthers prevent spontaneous self-pollination in D. incurva. Therefore,
   medium- to large-sized Apidae are the most suitable pollinators as they
   make regular contact with anthers and stigmas and are further known to
   perform trapline foraging. This behaviour is particularly important for
   D. hexandra where Halictidae are considered pollen robbers, thus wasting
   pollen which, consequently, causes low reproductive efficacy in this
   species. Nevertheless, bee diversity is probably advantageous for the
   reproductive success of both Dichorisandra species. While the efficiency
   of each bee species is not known, further studies will show whether
   additional benefits are gained from the maintenance of these
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the topological structure (e.g., links per species,
   connectance, core-periphery analyses, specialization, nestedness,
   modularity) of plant-bee interactions of four areas in Mexico. We used
   qualitative data (binary networks). Mexico exhibits a complex geography
   and community variation that can affect bee networks. Network
   architecture is variable within large spatial scales, thus our results
   should vary according to site characteristics (La Mancha and Totula in
   Veracruz, Carrillo Puerto in Quintana Roo, and the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan
   valley, in Puebla), type of vegetation, endemism, altitude, size of area
   sampled. Network topology varied among sites, and the presence of nested
   or modular patterns was analyzed for robustness to simulated species
   extinctions. The lowest species richness was recorded for the Quintana
   Roo site (15 plant, 25 bee species), and the highest for the
   Tehuacan-Cuicatlan valley site (88 plant, 231 bee species). There was a
   tendency to have more connected networks when species richness was low
   and networks with greater species richness had a higher number of
   interactions. The distribution of interactions differed between
   environments but not due to network size and all were significantly
   nested. The robustness to cumulative extinctions showed a different
   pattern at each site; the most robust network was at Carrillo Puerto,
   which also was the site with less species. Sites with more endemic
   species (e.g. Tehuacan) had more specialized interactions, and were more
   susceptible to extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides have come under scrutiny for their potential
   unintended effects on non-target organisms, particularly pollinators in
   agro-ecosystems. As part of a larger study of neonicotinoid residues
   associated with maize (corn) production, 76 water samples within or
   around the perimeter of 18 commercial maize fields and neighbouring
   apiaries were collected in 5 maize-producing counties of southwestern
   Ontario. Residues of clothianidin (mean = 2.28, max. = 43.60 ng/mL) and
   thiamethoxam (mean = 1.12, max. = 16.50 ng/mL) were detected in 100 and
   98.7\% of the water samples tested, respectively. The concentration of
   total neonicotinoid residues in water within maize fields increased
   sixfold during the first five weeks after planting, and returned to
   pre-plant levels seven weeks after planting. However, concentrations in
   water sampled from outside the fields were similar throughout the
   sampling period. Soil samples from the top 5 cm of the soil profile were
   also collected in these fields before and immediately following
   planting. The mean total neonicotinoid residue was 4.02 (range 0.07 to
   20.30) ng/g, for samples taken before planting, and 9.94 (range 0.53 to
   38.98) ng/g, for those taken immediately after planting. Two soil
   samples collected from within an conservation area contained detectable
   (0.03 and 0.11 ng/g) concentrations of clothianidin. Of three drifted
   snow samples taken, the drift stratum containing the most wind-scoured
   soil had 0.16 and 0.20 ng/mL mainly clothianidin in the melted snow. The
   concentration was at the limit of detection (0.02 ng/mL) taken across
   the entire vertical profile. With the exception of one sample, water
   samples tested had concentrations below those reported to have acute,
   chronic or sublethal effects to honey bees. Our results suggest that
   neonicotinoids may move off-target by wind erosion of contaminated soil.
   These results are informative to risk assessment models for other
   non-target species in maize agro-ecosytems.}},

Title = {{Selection by Pollinators on Floral Traits in Generalized Trollius
   ranunculoides (Ranunculaceae) along Altitudinal Gradients}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Abundance and visitation of pollinator assemblages tend to decrease with
   altitude, leading to an increase in pollen limitation. Thus increased
   competition for pollinators may generate stronger selection on
   attractive traits of flowers at high elevations and cause floral
   adaptive evolution. Few studies have related geographically variable
   selection from pollinators and intraspecific floral differentiation. We
   investigated the variation of Trollius ranunculoides flowers and its
   pollinators along an altitudinal gradient on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau, and measured phenotypic selection by pollinators on floral
   traits across populations. The results showed significant decline of
   visitation rate of bees along altitudinal gradients, while flies was
   unchanged. When fitness is estimated by the visitation rate rather than
   the seed number per plant, phenotypic selection on the sepal length and
   width shows a significant correlation between the selection strength and
   the altitude, with stronger selection at higher altitudes. However,
   significant decreases in the sepal length and width of Trollius
   ranunculoides along the altitudinal gradient did not correspond to
   stronger selection of pollinators. In contrast to the pollinator
   visitation, mean annual precipitation negatively affected the sepal
   length and width, and contributed more to geographical variation in
   measured floral traits than the visitation rate of pollinators.
   Therefore, the sepal size may have been influenced by conflicting
   selection pressures from biotic and abiotic selective agents. This study
   supports the hypothesis that lower pollinator availability at high
   altitude can intensify selection on flower attractive traits, but
   abiotic selection is preventing a response to selection from
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination biology is an especially important component of the overall
   ecological setting of a plant species since it has direct implications
   on reproductive success. Over time, a typological approach to
   classifying flower-pollinator interactions in the form of ``floral

   traditionally ascribed to these syndromes. Recent studies have
   increasingly questioned both the predictive value of the syndrome
   concept, as well as the underlying notion of increasing specialization
   amongst flower-pollinator interactions. The casual discovery that the
   seemingly ornithophilous flowers of the globose to shortly columnar
   South American cactus Denmoza rhodacantha (Cactaceae: Cactoideae:
   Cereeae: Trichocereinae) are visited by solitary pollen-collecting
   halictid bees, rather than the expected hummingbirds, adds another
   example to the growing body of mismatches between floral syndrome and

Abstract = {{The number of both flowers and co-foragers may affect bumblebees' local
   foraging decisions and the effort they devote to each flower during
   foraging. We studied bumblebees' local foraging decisions by using an
   experimental set-up in which bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) foraged for
   a single species (Salvia farinacea) in patches containing S. farinacea
   and Tagetes bonanza in varying densities (25, 50 and 75 \% Salvia). We
   did not restrict the number of co-foragers, which allowed us also to
   assess the influence of simultaneous and previous foragers on foraging
   decisions. Bumblebees could adjust the effort per inflorescence and
   flower to the number of available inflorescences and flowers in the
   patch. They increased between-patch and between-plant movements as the
   number of previous foragers increased, and this effect was stronger in
   the patches with more Salvia, probably due to the synergic effects of
   number of flowers and number of previous foragers. Simultaneous
   foragers, on the contrary, favoured within-plant movements. The
   probability of leaving a patch was positively related to inflorescence
   exploitation time and to the number of previous foragers. The movements
   between patches followed Salvia abundance and were modified by the
   experience gained in the observation period. This experiment shed light
   on the influence of foragers' abundances on local foraging behaviour,
   and the interactions and synergies between flower abundance and
   foragers' abundances at a local scale, which are still much unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Since its introduction in Chile, the European Bombus terrestris L.
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae) has progressively reduced the abundance of the
   native Patagonian bumblebee, Bombus dahlbomii Guerin. Because an
   important cause of successful invasion of a species may depend on a
   potentially advantageous phenotype, we studied morphologies related to
   flight performance (flight muscle ratio (FMR), wing loading (WL), excess
   power index (EPI, which integrates FMR and WL) and wing aspect ratio
   (AR)) in the queens of the two species. Previous empirical studies
   showed that greater FMR, AR and EPI, and lower WL increase
   flight-performance. In the Patagonian Chilean fjord where the study was
   carried out, B. dahlbomii was 40\% heavier than B. terrestris, a
   difference theoretically allowing the queens of the native species to
   take off with heavier loads, despite the fact that the two species have
   virtually identical FMRs. However, FMR negatively depended on body mass
   at the intra-specific level. The total wing area was 35\% greater in B.
   dahlbomii, but the difference in forewing length was only of 16\%. Once
   taken into account the effect of body size, WL, was significantly lower
   in B. terrestris. AR increased with body mass and did not differ between
   species. EPI was weakly but significantly higher in B. terrestris.
   Experiments formally linking such parameters with flight performance may
   help to explain the observed quick and wide spread of this alien species
   in Patagonia in the last few years. (C) 2014 Academie des sciences.

Abstract = {{Bees ensure 35 \% of global food production, but this service is
   endangered due to several threats. Declines in bumblebee populations
   (genus Bombus) have been reported worldwide. Bombus bellicosus is one of
   the rare cases of reported threatened bumblebees in South America. It
   was once widespread in southern Brazil's grasslands until the 1960s.
   During that time, that area underwent increasing land use which led to a
   decrease in bee abundance and richness, and to local disappearance of B.
   bellicosus. Climate change is also believed to cause declines in the
   abundance of B. bellicosus. Here we used species distribution models to
   assess potential effects of climate changes on the distribution of B.
   bellicosus in southern Brazil, considering both current and future
   climate scenarios. Our results show that the suitable climatic
   conditions for B. bellicosus will retreat southwards. A wax cover inside
   its nests is usually related to Bombus species inhabiting cooler
   climates. This cover enables the maintenance of higher temperatures
   inside the nest and may be deleterious for the species under future
   warmer climates. Continuously growing land use is the second major
   threat to this pollinator. The results presented here may eventually
   provide theoretical grounds and enable practical conservation actions
   for B. bellicosus protection in South America, especially given the
   potential adverse effects of climate changes for this species.}},

Abstract = {{The global pollinator decline is commonly linked to modern intensive
   farming practices, partly because excessive herbicide and fertilizer use
   is thought to reduce pollinator food plant availability. This effect is
   particularly obvious across crop-/non-crop boundaries, but no study has
   compared pollinator and food plant abundance on adjacent crop- and
   roadside margins. We compared bumblebee abundance along 30 hedgerows in
   SW England; bordered either side by roads and arable fields (cultivated
   with wheat, barley, oilseed rape, or beans). Total bumblebee abundance
   along roadsides was over twice that observed on adjacent crop-facing
   margins, irrespective of crop type and this general pattern was apparent
   for three of the five most common bumblebee species, including
   generalist and specialist foragers. Both the total number of flowering
   plant species and the floral abundance of three of the five most visited
   plants was also higher on roadsides; minor variation between-crops was
   localised and unrelated to margin orientation. We conclude that organic
   farming may offer some advantages for pollinator conservation since it
   reduces field margin exposure to agro-chemical inputs. However, since
   conventional farming will remain central to global food production,
   modifications to current practices (such as the use of wildflower
   strips) are needed and may have ancillary benefits for pollinators by
   protecting arable margins from disturbance and agro-chemicals. In
   addition, the fact that the roadsides were demonstrably better habitats
   for pollinators and their food plants than field-facing margins
   underscores the widespread suggestion that roadside verges should be
   utilised more as a conservation tool to promote pollinator biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports of pollinator declines have revealed a need to better
   document how anthropogenic disturbances and biogeography jointly
   influence wild pollinator communities. Here, we examine the effects of
   urbanization-induced habitat fragmentation on the native bee fauna
   inhabiting coastal sage scrub habitats of San Diego County, California,
   USA, a hotspot of bee biodiversity. Pitfall trapping in natural reserves
   and scrub habitat fragments yielded 70 native bee species or
   morphospecies, and revealed that bee species richness was lower in
   fragments than in reserves. However, fragments and reserves harbored bee
   assemblages similar in relative abundance, evenness, and community
   composition. Our samples yielded multiple species that are poorly
   represented in four of the leading institutions with collections of
   native bees from the southwestern United States, as well as 16 species
   represented only by specimen records from outside of San Diego County.
   Our results highlight the importance of continued efforts to document
   bee assemblages in under-studied regions with respect to their faunal
   distribution and basic taxonomy, as well as how they are impacted by
   anthropogenic disturbances such as habitat fragmentation. We also
   discuss the value of analyzing vouchered pitfall samples for non-target
   taxa captured incidentally.}},

   the highest mating rate within first minutes in polycarbonate box.
   Similarly, during the five minutes of time interval from introduction,
   mating tendency was high in polycarbonate box which was 1-2 fold higher

Abstract = {{Rapid radiations are notoriously difficult to resolve, yet understanding
   phylogenetic patterns in such lineages can be useful for investigating
   evolutionary processes associated with bursts of speciation and
   morphological diversification. Here we present an expansive molecular
   phylogeny of Costus L. (Costaceae Nakai) with a focus on the Neotropical
   species within the clade, sampling 47 of the known 51 Neotropical
   species and including five molecular markers for phylogenetic analysis
   (ITS, ETS, rps16, trnL-F, and CaM). We use the phylogenetic results to
   investigate shifts in pollination syndrome, with the intention of
   addressing potential mechanisms leading to the rapid radiation
   documented for this clade. Our ancestral reconstruction of pollination
   syndrome presents the first evidence in this genus of an evolutionary
   toggle in pollination morphologies, demonstrating both the multiple
   independent evolutions of ornithophily (bird pollination) as well as
   reversals to melittophily (bee pollination). We show that the
   ornithophilous morphology has evolved at least eight times independently
   with four potential reversals to melittophilous morphology, and confirm
   prior work showing that neither pollination syndrome defines a
   monophyletic lineage. Based on the current distribution for the
   Neotropical and African species, we reconstruct the ancestral
   distribution of the Neotropical clade as the Pacific Coast of Mexico and
   Central America. Our results indicate an historic dispersal of a
   bee-pollinated taxon from Africa to the Pacific Coast of Mexico/ Central
   America, with subsequent diversification leading to the evolution of a
   bird-pollinated floral morphology in multiple derived lineages.}},

   Compositional Shifts of Insect Communities Visiting Wild Arabica Coffee

Abstract = {{Coffea arabica is an indigenous understorey shrub of the moist evergreen
   Afromontane forest of SW Ethiopia. Coffee cultivation here occurs under
   different forest management intensities, ranging from almost no
   intervention in the `forest coffee' system to far-reaching interventions
   that include the removal of competing shrubs and selective thinning of
   the upper canopy in the `semi-forest coffee' system. We investigated
   whether increasing forest management intensity and fragmentation result
   in impacts upon potential coffee pollination services through examining
   shifts in insect communities that visit coffee flowers. Overall, we
   netted 2,976 insect individuals on C. arabica flowers, belonging to
   sixteen taxonomic groups, comprising 10 insect orders. Taxonomic
   richness of the flower-visiting insects significantly decreased and
   pollinator community changed with increasing forest management intensity
   and fragmentation. The relative abundance of honey bees significantly
   increased with increasing forest management intensity and fragmentation,
   likely resulting from the introduction of bee hives in the most
   intensively managed forests. The impoverishment of the insect
   communities through increased forest management intensity and
   fragmentation potentially decreases the resilience of the coffee
   production system as pollination increasingly relies on honey bees
   alone. This may negatively affect coffee productivity in the long term
   as global pollination services by managed honey bees are expected to
   decline under current climate change scenarios. Coffee agroforestry
   management practices should urgently integrate pollinator conservation
   measures.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{64-72}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Restoring native habitat is considered critical to conserving native
   pollinators threatened by habitat loss and degradation, but little is
   known about whether ecological restorations, most of which do not target
   pollinators, can predictably support pollinator communities. In this
   study we compare plant species richness in common commercial prairie
   seed mixes to remnant prairies, and we take a modeling approach to
   examine the ability of these seed mixes to attract bee communities
   relative to native prairie remnants. Using a large data set from native
   prairies in Iowa consisting of 70 bee species (approximate to 2700 bee
   specimens) associated with 54 native prairie plants, we constructed
   species accumulation curves to model the number of bee species
   potentially attracted to a restoration with the addition of each plant
   in a seed mix. Our modeling results indicate commercial prairie mixes
   will accumulate species at rates similar to prairie remnants, but the
   bee species richness will be lower than remnants because the plant
   species richness in samples from prairie remnants is twice that of the
   average commercial seed mix. However, when commercially available seed
   mixes were modeled to always include four plant species that were
   exceptionally attractive to native bee species, most mixes attracted
   significantly more bees than predicted if random species were added.
   This further suggests that seed mixes and the resulting restorations do
   not adequately provide for pollinators and could be significantly
   improved with the addition of a small number of species. Although the
   particular optimal species additions to seed mixes will vary regionally,
   adding species functionally equivalent to those we identify may
   significantly improve restoration of ecological services provided by
   native bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination by bees (Apoidea) is a critical component of lowbush
   blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Ation: Ericaceae) production. Though
   most blueberry growers in eastern Canada use managed bees in lowbush
   blueberry pollination, native pollinators are recognized as an important
   component of the pollination service provision. In this study we
   examined the diversity and abundance of native bees in lowbush blueberry
   fields in Nova Scotia, while considering spatial and temporal patterns
   in their distribution over the growing season. In total, we collected 95
   species representing 13 genera, of which Lasioglossum and Andrena
   comprised >92\% of all individuals. The abundance of several of the most
   common species was inversely related to distance from the forest edge,
   but was low inside the adjacent forest. In contrast, species diversity
   was highest inside the forest and consistently low within fields. Larger
   bees were found further into fields than smaller bees. Whereas some
   abundant bees were collected most often outside the blueberry bloom
   period, Lasioglossum cressonii, the most abundant species, was collected
   often during blueberry bloom, suggesting it could be an effective
   pollinator in this system. The results highlight wild bee taxa that
   could be targeted for conservation efforts to potentially decrease
   reliance on managed pollinators.}},

Title = {{Contrasting impacts of pesticides on butterflies and bumblebees in
   private gardens in France}},

Abstract = {{Private gardens are an important food source and refuge for animals in
   urban areas because they represent a large part of the green space. It
   has been shown that garden management regime (water use, floral
   composition) may impact the species they shelter. However, due to access
   restrictions, lack of regulations and the difficulty of data collection
   on private property, the impact of management practices and in
   particular pesticide use has seldom been assessed in private gardens.
   Using data collected in the framework of a nationwide participatory
   monitoring scheme in France, we assess here, for the first time, the
   effect of private garden management on two important groups of
   flower-visiting insects, i.e. butterflies and bumblebees, at a large
   scale. We show that the correlation between butterfly and bumblebee
   abundance and use of insecticides and herbicides is negative, whereas
   the use of Bordeaux mixture (fungicide approved for organic use),
   fungicides and anti-slugs is positively correlated with butterfly and
   bumblebee abundance. We hypothesize that herbicides have an indirect
   negative impact on insects by limiting the amount of available
   resources, and that the Bordeaux mixture, fungicides and slug repellants
   have an indirect positive impact on these insects by fostering healthier
   plants, probably offering higher level of resources to pollinators.
   Moreover, we show that the impact of pesticides varies according to the
   landscape, the negative effect of insecticides being more important in
   highly urbanized areas. Overall, our results show that gardener
   practices can have a positive impact on flower-visiting insects, even in
   a highly anthropized, urban landscape. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Managing habitats on English farmland for insect pollinator conservation}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{182}},
Pages = {{215-222}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Agri-environment scheme habitats can support declining pollinators, but
   optimum approaches for deployment remain uncertain. The impact of three
   management treatments (project-, farm-managed and organic farming)
   alongside habitat type, quantity of uncropped land removed from
   production and spatial configuration (strips or blocks) on wild bees,
   butterflies and hoverflies were investigated. Pollinators were assessed
   on 28 sites over three years, along boundaries representing site scale
   (ca. 100-ha) and within project-managed (floristically enhanced grass,
   wild bird seed mix, insect rich cover and natural regeneration) or
   farm-managed wildlife habitats (typically grass margins or game cover).
   Project-management resulted in the creation of the most widely utilised
   habitats (floristically enhanced grass and wild bird seed mixtures), but
   these may attract wild bees away from boundaries whereas butterfly
   abundance (Lycaenidae and Pieridae) was enhanced along field boundaries.
   Organic management and spatial configuration of habitats had little
   impact. Proportion of uncropped land per site was positively related to
   Cuckoo bee, Lycaenidae and Satyridae density and butterfly species
   richness at site scale and on the density of several bee species, total
   wild bees, Pieridae and total butterflies in wildlife habitats. The mean
   abundance of uncropped land was 3.6\% and at least double this was
   required to double the abundance of wild bees and butterflies. Wild bee
   densities were highest in field boundaries and floristically enhanced
   grass and positively correlated with flower cover. Butterflies sought
   habitats containing their larval food plants and high flower cover.
   Hoverflies were most abundant in the insect rich cover. Wildlife habitat
   in agricultural landscapes may be insufficient and additional, diverse
   habitats are needed to encourage pollinators. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Does multi-level environmental filtering determine the functional and
   phylogenetic composition of wild bee species assemblages?}},
Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{140-153}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A central goal in ecology is to develop theories that explain the
   diversity and distribution of species. The evolutionary history of
   species and their functional traits may provide mechanistic links
   between community assembly and the environment. Such links may be
   hierarchically structured such that the strength of environmental
   filtering decreases in a step-wise manner from regional conditions
   through landscape heterogeneity to local habitat conditions. We sampled
   the wild bee species assemblages in power-line strips transecting
   forests in south-eastern Norway. We used altitude, landscape diversity
   surrounding sites and plant species composition, together with total
   plant cover as proxies for regional, landscape and local environmental
   filters, respectively. The species richness and abundance of wild bees
   decreased with altitude. The reduction in species richness and abundance
   was accompanied by a phylogenetic clustering of wild bee individuals.
   Furthermore, regional filters followed by local filters best explained
   the structure of the functional species composition. Sites at high
   altitudes and sites with Ericaceae-dominated plant communities tended to
   have larger bees and a higher proportion of social and spring-emerging
   bees. When Bombus species were excluded from the analysis, the
   proportion of pollen specialists increased with the dominance of
   Ericaceae. Furthermore, we also found that the taxonomic, phylogenetic
   and functional compositional turnover between sites was higher in the
   northern region than in the southern part of the study region.
   Altogether, these results suggest that regional filters drive the
   species richness and abundance in trait-groups whereas local filters
   have more descrete sorting effects. We conclude that the model of
   multi-level environmental filters provides a good conceptual model for
   community ecology. We suggest that future studies should focus on the
   relationship between the biogeographical history of species and their
   current distribution, and on the assumption that closely related species
   do indeed compete more intensely than distantly related species.}},

   we examine the contribution that differences in visitor composition make
   to increased selfing and seed production by examining the major visitors
   to Plectritis congesta in populations on the Gulf Islands and Vancouver
   Island, We find that (1) connectivity is more strongly associated with
   visitor assemblages and seed production than components of the floral

Abstract = {{Pollination can be an essential but often neglected ecosystem service to
   mitigate crop yield gaps. Pollination services are usually studied in
   isolation, and their relative role and possible interactions with other
   factors, such as major management practices, is little understood. We
   tested how pollination (insect vs. wind- and self-pollination) interacts
   with weed control, fertilization and insect herbivore control and how
   these factors as well as flower-visiting bees influence fruit set and
   yield of cucumber Cucumis sativus L. in 13 traditional Indonesian home
   gardens. Although insect pollination, fertilization and weed control
   additively increased crop yield, fertilization and weed control alone
   could not compensate for pollination loss. Pollination individually
   accounted for 75\% of the yield and was, hence, the most important
   driver of yield. In contrast, herbivore control through insecticides at
   commonly applied levels did not increase yield. Yield strongly increased
   with higher number of flower-visiting bee individuals, while the number
   of bee individuals in turn was not influenced by weed control,
   fertilization or herbivore control, but increased with higher number of
   cucumber flowers.Synthesis and applications. Although multiple
   management practices influence yield, they cannot compensate yield gaps
   from pollinator loss in cucumber smallholder production in Indonesia.
   Our results also show that the widespread use of insecticides without
   considering the impacts on pest reduction is uneconomical. Here,
   reducing insecticides caused no income loss and, at the same time,
   reduces potential risks to important pollinators, which needs to be
   acknowledged by policy-driven regulations for pesticide application in
   tropical agroecosystems. Our results stress the importance of enhancing
   bee populations to facilitate pollination services. Bee management
   practices, such as sustaining additional food resources for pollinators,
   need to be established.

Abstract = {{Despite the extensive use of the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin,
   and its known toxicity to beneficial insects such as pollinators, little
   attention has been given to its fate under agricultural field
   conditions. The present study investigated the fate and toxicity of
   clothianidin applied every other year as a corn seed-coating at 2
   different rates, 0.25mg/seed and 0.50mg/seed, in an agricultural field
   undergoing a corn-soybean annual rotation, and conservation tillage.
   Concentrations were measured in soil, surface runoff, infiltration, and
   groundwater from 2011 to 2013. Clothianidin was detected at low
   concentrations in soil and water throughout the 2-yr corn and soybean
   rotation. Low and no-tillage had little or no effect on clothianidin
   concentrations. Laboratory toxicity bioassays were performed on
   nontarget species, including Daphnia magna, Hyalella azteca, Chironomus
   dilutus, Pimephales promelas and Eisenia fetida. Risk quotients were
   calculated from clothianidin concentrations measured in the field and
   compared with the laboratory toxicity bioassay results to assess the
   environmental risk of the insecticide. The risk quotient was found to be
   lower than the level of concern for C. dilutus, which was the most
   sensitive species tested; therefore, no short-term environmental risk
   was expected for the species investigated in the present study. Environ

Abstract = {{Habitat loss is the leading cause of extinctions on the planet. However,
   negative effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on biodiversity can
   be reduced if resources in urban or semi-natural areas in the
   surrounding matrix can be used by wildlife.
   We investigated the influence of floral and nesting resources in urban-
   and forest-associated oak-savannah fragments, surrounding urban and
   forest matrix, and urban areas spatially independent from oak-savannah
   habitat on pollinator community composition in a fragmented oak-savannah
   ecosystem.
   Both independent urban and urban matrix sites supported high abundance
   and richness of plants and pollinators relative to other fragment
   categories, especially towards the end of the season when plants and
   pollinators in oak-savannah fragments were scarce. A species of
   particular conservation concern in our region, Bombus occidentalis, was
   supported by late-flowering resources in our urban sites.
   Forest-associated oak-savannah fragments were missing late-season
   species while urban-associated fragments supported high abundance and
   richness of mid- to late-season pollinators, likely due to supplemental
   use of floral resources in the urban matrix. Female cavity-nesting and
   ground-nesting bees were not restricted by the availability of natural
   nesting resources we expected them to require (e.g. small cavities, bare
   soil).
   These results provide important information on native pollinators in a
   highly fragmented habitat, and suggest that we should consider matrix
   quality in conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat management, with the aim of conserving pollinators in
   agro-ecosystems, requires the selection of the most suitable floral
   species in terms of their attractiveness to pollinators and a simplicity
   of agronomic management.
   A randomized block design including 12 herbaceous plants was used to
   study their attractiveness to pollinators (insect visitation), their
   attractiveness efficiency (a combination of duration of flowering and
   insect visitation), their response to two different agronomic management
   practices (growing in mixed versus mono-specific stands; tillage versus
   no-tillage) and their potential weediness.
   The flowers of Borago officinalis, Echium plantagineum, Phacelia
   tanacetifolia and Diplotaxis tenuifolia were attractive to bees, whereas
   Calendula arvensis, Coriandrum sativum, D. tenuifolia and Lobularia
   maritima were attractive to hoverflies.
   A floral mixture resulted in a lower attractiveness efficiency to
   pollinators than D. tenuifolia, but higher than when compared with most
   of the mono-specific stands. On the other hand, although some of the
   most attractive plant species (P. tanacetifolia and C. arvensis) showed
   potential weediness, their self-seeding was reduced by tillage
   treatment.
   Diplotaxis tenuifolia was the only plant with a high attractiveness
   efficiency to pollinators and efficient self-reproduction. Therefore, D.
   tenuifolia is highly recommended species for attracting bees and
   hoverflies in agro-ecosystems of Central Spain.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar functions to attract insects, so the inclusion of toxic
   compounds calls for explanation. Recent work shows that honeybees prefer
   nectars with low concentrations of caffeine and nicotine, and that
   associative learning by honeybees is enhanced by caffeine, prompting
   speculation that pollination service could be enhanced. We directly
   tested caffeine's effect on pollination service by allowing bumblebee
   colonies to feed on arrays of artificial flowers that offer nectar while
   also dispensing and receiving dye particles as pollen analogues. With
   caffeine levels signaled by flower color (blue, green, or yellow) in a
   factorial design, flowers offering nectar with 10(-5) M caffeine
   received significantly more pollen analogue than did those with 10(-4) M
   caffeine or with no caffeine. Effects of caffeine were unaffected by
   which colors were associated with which caffeine levels: Color alone had
   no significant effect, and there was no interaction between color and
   caffeine level. In cases where greater pollination service translates to
   increased fitness, we would expect stabilizing selection to maintain
   nectar caffeine at intermediate levels.}},

Title = {{Nectar sugars and bird visitation define a floral niche for
   basidiomycetous yeast on the Canary Islands}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Studies on the diversity of yeasts in floral nectar were
   first carried out in the late 19th century. A narrow group of
   fermenting, osmophilous ascomycetes were regarded as exclusive
   specialists able to populate this unique and species poor environment.
   More recently, it became apparent that microorganisms might play an
   important role in the process of plant pollination. Despite the
   importance of these nectar dwelling yeasts, knowledge of the factors
   that drive their diversity and species composition is scarce.
   Results: In this study, we linked the frequencies of yeast species in
   floral nectars from various host plants on the Canary Islands to nectar
   traits and flower visitors. We estimated the structuring impact of
   pollination syndromes (nectar volume, sugar concentration and sugar
   composition) on yeast diversity.
   The observed total yeast diversity was consistent with former studies,
   however, the present survey yielded additional basidiomycetous yeasts in
   unexpectedly high numbers. Our results show these basidiomycetes are
   significantly associated with ornithophilous flowers. Specialized
   ascomycetes inhabit sucrose-dominant nectars, but are surprisingly rare
   in nectar dominated by monosaccharides.
   Conclusions: There are two conclusions from this study: (i) a shift of
   floral visitors towards ornithophily alters the likelihood of yeast
   inoculation in flowers, and (ii) low concentrated hexose-dominant nectar
   promotes colonization of flowers by basidiomycetes. In the studied
   floral system, basidiomycete yeasts are acknowledged as regular members
   of nectar. This challenges the current understanding that nectar is an
   ecological niche solely occupied by ascomycetous yeasts.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators visit flowers for rewards and should therefore have a
   preference for floral signals that indicate reward status, so called
   honest signals'. We investigated honest signalling in Brassica rapa L.
   and its relevance for the attraction of a generalised pollinator, the
   bumble bee Bombus terrestris (L.). We found a positive association
   between reward amount (nectar sugar and pollen) and the floral scent
   compound phenylacetaldehyde. Bumble bees developed a preference for
   phenylacetaldehyde over other scent compounds after foraging on B. rapa.
   When foraging on artificial flowers scented with synthetic volatiles,
   bumble bees developed a preference for those specific compounds that
   honestly indicated reward status. These results show that the honesty of
   floral signals can play a key role in their attractiveness to
   pollinators. In plants, a genetic constraint, resource limitation in
   reward and signal production, and sanctions against cheaters may
   contribute to the evolution and maintenance of honest signalling.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{The floral traits of bisexual flowers may evolve in response to
   selection on both male and female functions, but the relative importance
   of selection associated with each of these two aspects is poorly
   resolved. Sexually dimorphic traits in plants with unisexual flowers may
   reflect gender-specific selection, providing opportunities for gaining
   an increased understanding of the evolution of specific floral traits.
   We examined sexually dimorphic patterns of floral traits in perfect and
   female flowers of the gynodioecious species Cyananthus delavayi. A
   special corolla appendage, the throat hair, was investigated
   experimentally to examine its influences on male and female function. We
   found that perfect flowers have larger corollas and much longer throat
   hairs than female flowers, while female ones have much exerted stigmas.
   The presence of throat hairs prolonged the duration of pollen
   presentation by restricting the amount of pollen removed by
   pollen-collecting bees during each visit. Floral longevity was
   negatively related to the rate of pollen removal. When pollen removal
   rate was limited in perfect flowers, the duration of the female phases
   diminished with the increased male phase duration. There was a weak
   negative correlation between throat hair length and seed number per
   fruit in female flowers, but this correlation was not significant in
   perfect flowers. These results suggest that throat hairs may enhance
   male function in terms of prolonged pollen presentation. However, throat
   hairs have no obvious effect on female function in terms of seed number
   per fruit. The marked sexual dimorphism of this corolla appendage in C.
   delavayi is likely to have evolved and been maintained by
   gender-specific selection.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Heterostyly is a floral polymorphism characterized by reciprocal
   herkogamy maintained through high levels of mating between morphs,
   serviced by appropriate pollinators. We studied how differential
   efficiency and abundance of distinct pollinators affect plant female
   reproduction in self- and intra-morph incompatible distylous Primula
   secundiflora. Bumblebees and syrphid flies were found to be the most
   abundant floral visitors. Bumblebees frequently exhibited nectar-robbing
   behavior. Because the robbing holes were always situated between the
   high-and low-level organs on both morphs, nectar-robbing bumblebees only
   pollinated S-styled flowers. L-styled flowers set four times as many
   seeds as did S-styled flowers after being visited by pollen-collecting
   syrphid flies. The natural female fecundity and the magnitude of pollen
   limitation varied between the morphs within populations because of the
   mosaic distribution of nectar-robbing bumblebees and syrphid flies.
   L-styled flowers and S-styled flowers set the same number of seeds after
   supplemental hand pollination, indicating equivalent female reproductive
   potential. We suggest that bumblebee nectar robbers and syrphid flies
   play an important role in sustaining the floral dimorphism of
   heterostyly in P. secundiflora because of their complementary roles in
   the pollination system.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding systems, phenology, pollination, and
   reproductive success of Portulaca grandiflora and P. hirsutissima
   (Portulacaceae) at Parque Nacional do Catimbau in the Brazilian
   Caatinga. The species flowered synchronously, exhibited similar floral
   morphology, offered pollen as the sole floral resource and shared the
   same bee species as pollinators. They visited flowers of both Portulaca
   species at similar frequencies, and their visitation peaks occurred at
   the same time of day. The pollinators made no distinction between the
   species during foraging. Both plant species are self-compatible, but
   produce fewer fruits and seeds after self-pollination than after
   cross-pollination. Comparing the reproductive success in areas where
   both species co-occur to that of areas with only one of them, seed set
   of P. grandiflora decreased by 25\% and of P. hirsutissima by 36\%. This
   is likely due to diminished flow of conspecific pollen grains, as the
   pollen-ovule ratio was extraordinarily small.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a growing number of studies have focused on the
   potential interest of urban green areas for supporting biodiversity.
   Private gardens, urban parks or green roofs may support relatively high
   densities of diverse wild bees. Knowledge is lacking regarding bee
   assemblages in Paris, the French capital, and one of the most densely
   populated part of France. In this context, we here provide a first
   assessment of the taxonomic and functional composition of bee
   assemblages in three urban parks in downtown Paris. Bees were sampled
   with a set of three coloured pan traps per park. Fifteen 24-hour
   sessions were performed from April to July 2011. We captured 425
   specimens from 44 species representing five families and 11 genera. The
   assemblage was dominated by Halictidae (15 species representing 70.1\%
   of total abundance), especially the eusocial species Lasioglossum morio
   that made 25.2\% of total abundance. From a functional point of view,
   there were only two species of parasitic bees that made 1.2\% of total
   abundance. Most non-parasitic species were polylectic and below-ground
   nesting. This study highlights the importance of preserving and managing
   urban parks and other green areas to promote the conservation of wild
   bees and ultimately the functionality of pollination service in urban
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed bee diversity and abundance in a botanical garden in the

   plant. A total of 66 bee species (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) were recorded.
   Richness and abundance of native, generalist, and above-ground nesting
   (cavities) species were higher than that of exotic, specialist, and
   below-ground (soil) nesting ones, respectively. Social bees were more
   abundant, while the richness of solitary species was higher than that of
   social bees. Cleptoparasitic species were represented by a high number
   of species, even though only a few individuals were captured. Our
   results suggest that the studied area is an important bee reservoir

Title = {{Bees and evolution of occluded corollas in snapdragons and relatives

Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{467-475}},
Abstract = {{The tribe Antirrhineae is a natural group comprising 28 genera and over
   320 species. In most Antirrhineae the corolla is marked by the
   development of a prominent palate (personate flower) that sometimes
   occludes the entrance of the corolla tube. Traditionally strong bees of
   different size have been considered as the principal pollinators of
   occluded, personate flowers (snapdragon-type). Phylogenetic analyses
   (ITS and ndhF regions) were conducted to gain insight into evolutionary
   changes in personate flower and corolla occlusion. In addition, logistic
   regressions were performed in order to test the role of this type of
   flower as a floral filtering morphology for pollinators. Historical
   reconstruction of the personate flower supports its ancestral condition
   within Antirrhineae and a general pattern of recurrent corolla occlusion
   shifts have prevailed since lineage diversification of the Antirrhineae.
   In addition, we found some evidence of snapdragon-type corollas
   negatively affecting hummingbirds and insects other than bees. Part of
   this outcome is due to predominance of bees as single visitors of
   Antirrhineae species with closed corollas (c. 65\% of the species). The
   lack of significant correlation between bees and occluded, personate
   flowers is interpreted as the ability of bees of visiting any type of
   flowers. The personate flower, particularly when occluded, displays one
   of the most specialized corollas in pollinator exclusion by physical
   barriers. (C) 2015 Geobotanisches Institut ETH, Stiftung Ruebel.

   unusually enlarged eyes and is newly synonymized under X. macrops. Males
   and females of all species are diagnosed, described, and figured,

Title = {{Utilization of Waste Materials for Management of Alfalfa Pollinating
   Megachilid Bees}},
Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Hollow waste stems of sarkandas (Arundo sp. and Saccharum sp.) and
   castor (Ricinus communis L.) cut into small lengths were tried as
   nesting tunnels for culturing/keeping the wild bee pollinators. Of the
   four megachild bees, three of them easily accepted these tunnels for
   provisioning and nesting activities. The provisioning bees were the
   specialist pollinators of important crops like alfalfa (Medicago sativa
   L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan Millsp.) and cucurbits. During the study
   period, three species of megachilid bee were found to nest, reproduce
   and build their populations in these tunnels. This paper discusses the
   possibility of harnessing Megachile harayanesis, Chalicodoma rubripes
   and M. femorata for which various artificial devices were tried. The
   castor stems and soda straws fixed in the drilled wooden boards/blocks
   were ultimately found as the most convenient means acceptable to the
   bees for nest construction, especially in 6 mm internal diameter (I.M).
   Although tunnels of lower significantly the number of cells constructed
   per tunnel. Decrease in cell number seemed independent of the tunnel
   length and the cell length also remained unaffected. If length of the
   tunnel was taken as the parameter against acceptability by M.
   haryanaensis, 10 cm tunnels were found to be the most suitable. The
   nesting behavior of C. rubripes and C. cephalotes as affected by the
   tunnel characteristics has also been discussed. A comparision for the
   tripping efficiency has also been drawn among the indigenous megachilid
   bees and Nomia malanderi and Megachile rotundata. Among them M
   haryanaensis has been found to be the most efficient.}},

Abstract = {{The red mason bee (Osmia bicornis) is a highly effective pollinator that
   is exposed to various xenobiotics. The organism's potential resistance
   to the toxic effects of xenobiotics can be determined based on
   cholinesterase activity. The activity of cholinesterases (ChEs) towards
   acetylcholine (ACh) and butyrylcholine (BCh) was determined in extracts
   of diapausing (between October and late March) and flying bees (May). In
   both males and females, enzyme activity was higher towards ACh than
   towards BCh. The ratio of ACh/BCh activity was determined in the range
   of 1.43 to 4.15 in diapausing females and 3.00 to 7.18 in diapausing
   males. No significant changes in ChE activity towards ACh were observed
   in females before December and in males before February. Enzyme activity
   towards ACh increased dynamically in the second half of March. Enzyme
   activity towards BCh remained stable in both sexes until mid-March,
   after which it increased significantly. Excluding mid-March, enzyme BCh
   activity was significantly higher in females than in males. The activity
   of carboxylesterase towards 4-p-nitrophenyl butyrate was determined in
   females to assess the involvement of non-specific esterases in the
   hydrolysis of choline esters. Carboxylesterase activity was low in
   comparison with cholinesterase activity, and it remained practically
   unchanged throughout diapause, suggesting that choline esters in female
   O. bicornis extracts were hydrolyzed mainly by acetylcholinesterases.}},

Abstract = {{The Meliponinae are important pollinators of plant species, and one of
   the most managed species is Tetragonisca angustula. Initially, two
   subspecies were identified in T. angustula: T. angustula angustula and
   T. angustula fiebrigi. Subsequently, T. a. fiebrigi was considered a
   species, based on the coloration of its mesepisternum. The objective of
   the present study was to obtain genetic markers that could differentiate
   the two species by amplifying regions of mitochondrial DNA and
   conducting polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length
   polymorphism analysis. Worker bees were collected in three Brazilian
   states: Parana (Maringa, Altonia, and Foz do Iguacu), Sao Paulo
   (Dracena, Sao Carlos, and Santa Cruz do Rio Pardo), and Rondonia
   (Ariquemes). Ten pairs of insect heterologous primers were tested and
   four were used (primer pair 1, ND2 and COI; primer pair 2, COI; primer
   pair 8, 16S and 12S; and primer pair 9, COII). For the restriction
   analysis, 13 enzymes were tested: EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, HinfI, RsaI,
   PstI, XbaI, HaeIII, ClaI, XhoI, BglII, PvuII, and ScaI. Markers were
   obtained (primer pair 8 cleaved with EcoRV and XbaI and primer pair 9
   cleaved with HaeIII, RsaI, and XbaI) that enabled matrilineage
   identification in the nests studied, which confirmed that hybridization
   could occur between both Tetragonisca species. The beginning of
   speciation was probably recent, and secondary contact has resulted in
   crosses between T. angustula females and T. fiebrigi males. Because of
   this hybridization, it would be appropriate to consider them as two
   subspecies of T. angustula.}},

Journal = {{ANALES DEL JARDIN BOTANICO DE MADRID}},

Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Nectar yeast communities in southern Spain are dominated by two
   closely-related species, Metschnikowia reukaufii Pitt \& M.W. Mill. and
   M. gruessii Gim.-Jurado (Ascomycota, Saccharomycetales), although they
   tend to be distributed differentially across different host plants. We
   explore here the possibility that the two yeasts play different
   functional roles in floral nectar by differing in their impact on sugar
   concentration and composition of nectar. Experiments were undertaken
   under controlled conditions using bumblebees caught foraging on the
   flowers of two different host plants each of which is known to harbor
   predominantly one of the two yeasts. Bumblebees were used as sources of
   inocula to obtain two groups of samples from the nectar of Helleborus
   foetidus L. (Ranunculaceae): nectar samples inoculated with M. -gruessii
   and samples inoculated with M. reukaufii. Metschnikowia gruessii was
   poorly represented in nectar samples, while M. reukaufii was by far the
   most common and had the highest cell density. Although the two yeasts
   caused relatively similar changes in nectar sugar composition, which
   involved increasing fructose and decreasing sucrose proportions, they
   marginally differed in their quantitative impact on total nectar sugar
   concentration. Results suggest that differential yeast occurrence across
   host plants may lead to yeast specialization and modify the outcomes of
   the plant-pollinator interface.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out to determine the occurrence and

   (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) of Turkey. The material comprises samples
   collected from various parts of Turkey since the 1960s and certain
   private collections in Europe. The examination of the material and an
   overview of the published sources allowed us to reach the conclusion
   that Sphecodes of Turkey is represented by 33 species. Of these,
   Sphecodes crassanus Warncke, 1992 and S. majalis Perez, 1903 are new
   records for Turkey as well the Asian continent. Sphecodes alternatus
   Smith 1853, S. ephippius (Linnaeus, 1767), S. gibbus (Linnaeus, 1758),
   S. albilabris (Fabricius, 1793), and S. puncticeps Thomson, 1870 were
   found to be the most widespread and abundant species occurring
   throughout the country. On the contrary, S. armeniacus Warncke 1992, S.
   majalis Perez 1903, S. niger Hagens 1874, and S. scabricollis Wesmael
   1835 were considered to be the rarest species, recorded from just one
   locality each. New localities for the inspected material are given to
   make a contribution to the knowledge about the distribution patterns of
   the species. As a kleptoparasitic genus, the known host records of
   Sphecodes were also included. Although species of the genus Sphecodes
   only forage for nectar on flowers and do not collect pollen, the plant
   species visited were also added if available.}},

Title = {{Krameria tomentosa oil flowers and their pollinators: Bees specialized
   on trichome elaiophores exploit its epithelial oil glands}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Abstract = {{Oil flowers are spread over eleven angiosperm families and exploited by
   bees specialized on oil gathering. This reward is produced by glandular
   surfaces of specific floral whorls called elaiophores. Unlike trichome
   elaiophores, such as those of Plantaginaceae, Krameria species bear
   lateral petals modified into epithelial elaiophore, convergently similar
   to oil-secreting Malpighiaceae calyx. Krameriaceae is an oil-offering
   monotypic group of eighteen species with little information on their
   pollination biology and interactions with oil-collecting bees. In this
   study, we evaluate the breeding system and describe the floral biology
   of Krameria tomentosa, a widespread species that occurs mainly in open
   vegetation habitats of northeastern Brazil. We listed its flower
   visitors, surveyed throughout four years, and recorded their visits by
   season. The pollination treatments showed that K. tomentosa is
   self-compatible; however, its flowers depend on pollinators to set
   fruits. Twenty-one Apidae visited the flowers, including the oil-bee
   Centris hyptidis specialized on trichome elaiophores and stingless-bees
   which foraged for pollen. Centris nitens and Trigona fulviventris were
   the most frequent visitors. K. tomentosa flowers received relatively few
   oil visits throughout the day and on some days no flower visitors were
   seen on its flowers. Nevertheless, this did not reflect on a low natural
   fruit set. C. hyptidis has been associated with Angelonia
   (Plantaginaceae) trichome elaiophores mainly due to its long forelegs
   and their specialized oil-collecting apparatus. Nonetheless, it
   exploited the K. tomentosa epithelial elaiophores in an area with no
   Plantaginaceae species. We presume that the association between the
   morphology of the oil-collecting apparatus and the elaiophore type is
   not enough to predict relationships in oil-systems. Additionally, we
   conclude that the diversity of bee visitors suggests that
   pollen-collecting bees also play an important role in the maintenance of
   K. tomentosa pollination. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitism of Andrena (Suandrena) savignyi Spinola (Hymenoptera:
   Andrenidae) by Stylops Kirby (Strepsiptera: Stylopidae) has been
   recorded only once, and from an individual collected in Egypt almost a
   century ago, with the parasite described as Stylops savignyi Hofeneder.
   The recent rediscovery of this Stylops from an individual of A. savignyi
   permits a reinterpretation of the species and its affinities among other
   Stylops. The bee was collected at flowers of Zilla spinosa (Turra)
   Prantl. (Brassicaceae) in Amariah, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Based on DNA barcode sequences from material sampled across Africa,
   Asia, and Europe, it is apparent that S. savignyi is conspecific with S.
   nassonowi Pierce, and we accordingly synonymize this name (syn. n.),
   with the latter representing the senior and valid name for the species.
   A differential diagnosis is provided for S. nassonowi and the morphology
   of the female is described, as well as the first instars.}},

Abstract = {{This is the first complete inventory of stingless bees in El Salvador.
   It includes the spatial distribution of wild and managed colonies and
   the relationships between their occurrence and vegetation cover,
   altitude and temperature. Applying a stratified sampling, we located
   wild colonies (n=477) and managed colonies (n=686) of stingless bees in
   tropical forests, agricultural fields and urban areas. Each stratum (14)
   was a department (political division) of El Salvador. We made maps of
   the distribution of the most common wild and managed species. We
   analysed spatial distribution of colonies through the Clark and Evans
   Index (CEI). For the estimation of diversity between departments, the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) was calculated. The relationship
   between species richness and vegetation cover was analysed through the
   chi-square test. Linear regression was used to evaluate the effects of
   altitude and temperature on species richness. We concluded that: (a)
   there are at least 20 species, six subgenera and 10 genera of stingless
   bees in El Salvador; (b) the departments with highest levels of
   diversity were Santa Ana (H=2.55), Chalatenango (H=2.41), Morazan
   (H=2.31) and La Libertad (H=2.22); (c) the most abundant wild species,
   was Tetragonisca angustula (n=156, relative abundance=32.70\%) and was
   found in each department in clustered pattern (CEI=.26, p<.001); (d)
   Melipona beecheii (n=405, relative abundance=59.04\%) was the most
   frequent managed species, mainly found in a clustered pattern (CEI=.28,
   p<.001) in the northern and the western part of El Salvador; (e) the
   species richness is associated with the vegetation cover: increased with
   coniferous forest (X-2=336.1, p<.001), fruit trees (X-2=41.8, p<.001),
   and with temperature (r=.86, p=.0015) but decreased with altitude
   (r=-.87, p=.001).}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Lack of pollen, a main protein source, is widely regarded as one of the
   causes of pollinator decline. This study investigated the potential mass
   of Campanula patula L., Campanula persicifolia L., Campanula glomerata
   L., Campanula bononiensis L., and Campanula trachelium L. pollen that
   can serve as food for insect visitors. Observations and measurements
   were made during the period 2006-2008 on two separate sites for each
   species (in natural or semi-natural vs. man-made habitats). The study
   site was situated in the agricultural landscape on the Lublin Upland,
   south-eastern Poland (51 degrees 18'27''N, 22 degrees 26'05''E). The
   total pollen yield was restricted by various biotic parameters (anther
   size and pollen viability) and abiotic factors (habitat and/or
   meteorological conditions). Therefore, the pollen production may differ
   considerably among species and the reward of the same species can be
   variable among habitats and growing seasons. The total pollen yield was
   higher on natural and semi-natural habitats (3.7-12.7g per 10m(2) plot)
   compared to man-made habitats (2.9-4.8g per 10m(2) plot). The main
   visiting insects are bees, although flies and beetles have also been
   recorded. Consequently, Campanula species are important in supporting
   general insect biodiversity within various ecosystems and indirectly
   influence pollination services and biocontrol in agroecosystems. To
   maximize the abundance and diversity of bees and other pollinators in
   the surroundings of agroecosystems, natural and semi-natural habitats
   with an adequate quantity of food supplementation, rather than man-made
   habitats, are indispensable. However, in the landscape context, the
   minimum size of high quality fragmented natural and semi-natural patches
   may differ considerably.}},

Title = {{What influences pollen dispersal in the clonal distylous Menyanthes

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{148}},

Pages = {{199-212}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Habitat fragmentation may compromise population
   survival and decrease the ability to face environmental changes. Small
   and isolated populations in particular may suffer from disrupted
   pollination processes. However, a species' response to fragmentation may
   vary according to life history traits. Understanding how pollen
   dispersal is shaped by population and life history traits such as mating
   system and clonal growth is therefore essential for assessing species'
   response to fragmentation.
   Methods - We investigated pollen dispersal using fluorescent dyes in
   nine Belgian populations in two regions of the distylous
   insect-pollinated clonal herb Menyanthes trifoliata. We examined whether
   overall and legitimate (i.e. between-morph) dye dispersal patterns
   differed between morphs and regions, and whether they were influenced by
   population traits (size, area, plant density, morph ratio, co-flowering
   species) and individual plant traits (number of flowers).
   Key Results - No evidence of dye transfer between adjacent populations
   (distant from 1.3 to 11.8 km) was found, suggesting no or very
   restricted between-population pollen flow. Within-population dye
   dispersal followed a decaying, usually leptokurtic, distribution, with
   most dye deposition at short distances (80\% at less than 1.9-49.1 m),
   and a maximum distance of 336.6 m. Pins and thrums as recipients or
   donors did not differ in dye dispersal. Legitimate dye dispersal was not
   less successful than overall dispersal despite spatial clumping of the
   morphs. The distribution was similar or simply shifted to longer
   distances. The proportion of dyed stigmas was positively related to
   flowering population size and within-population heterospecific floristic
   richness, and to the number of flowers when considering legitimate dye
   deposition at distances <32 m.
   Conclusions - Our study highlights the effects of the spatial distance
   to dye source, population size and co-flowering floral resources, i.e.
   population traits related to attractiveness to pollinators, on pollen
   dispersal patterns.}},

Title = {{Reproductive biology of Primula beesiana (Primulaceae), an alpine
   species endemic to Southwest China}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{148}},

Pages = {{289-296}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Primula beesiana Forrest is a perennial alpine
   species endemic to southwest China, which is narrowly distributed in the
   eastern Himalaya and the Hengduan Mountains. The aim of this study is to
   elucidate the reproductive strategies of this heterostylous species in
   an alpine environment
   Methods - Floral scents were assessed and the pollinator assemblage and
   their foraging behaviour were recorded. In addition, the breeding system
   was investigated during 2004 and 2005 in populations from the Yulong
   Shan range, Lijiang County of Yunnan Province, China.
   Key results - Limonene was the dominant floral scent compound,
   accounting for 41.2\%, followed by a-pinene, diacetone alcohol and
   myrcene. Higher fruit and seed sets from inter-morph pollination were
   found compared to self, intra-morph and geitogamous pollination.
   Significant differences in seed set after self and open pollination were
   detected between flower morphs in both years. Two common insect species,
   the bumblebee Bombus lucorum and the butterfly Hypolimnas misippus, were
   the most important pollinators in the examined population, they visited
   the inflorescences 3.3 and 2.3 times per hour, respectively.
   Conclusion - beesiana is an obligate outcrosser, but with some
   self-compatibility. Seed set of self-pollinated pins was higher than
   that of thrums in both years, which seems to be related to this partial
   self-compatibility, which is often ignored in distylous Primula species.
   Floral scent and petal colour provide signals for pollinator attraction,
   and visitation rates are high.}},

Title = {{Variation in reward quality and pollinator attraction: the consumer does
   not always get it right}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Nearly all bees rely on pollen as the sole protein source for the
   development of their larvae. The central importance of pollen for the
   bee life cycle should exert strong selection on their ability to locate
   the most rewarding sources of pollen. Despite this importance, very few
   studies have examined the influence of intraspecific variation in pollen
   rewards on the foraging decisions of bees. Previous studies have
   demonstrated that inbreeding reduces viability and hence protein content
   in Mimulus guttatus (seep monkeyflower) pollen and that bees strongly
   discriminate against inbred in favour of outbred plants. We examined
   whether variation in pollen viability could explain this preference
   using a series of choice tests with living plants, artificial plants and
   olfactometer tests using the bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We found that
   B. impatiens preferred to visit artificial plants provisioned with
   fertile anthers over those provisioned with sterile anthers. They also
   preferred fertile anthers when provided only olfactory cues. These
   bumble bees were unable to discriminate among live plants from
   subpopulations differing dramatically in pollen viability, however. They
   preferred outbred plants even when those plants were from subpopulations
   with pollen viability as low as the inbred populations. Their preference
   for outbred plants was evident even when only olfactory cues were
   available. Our data showed that bumble bees are able to differentiate
   between anthers that provide higher rewards when cues are isolated from
   the rest of the flower. When confronted with cues from the entire
   flower, their choices are independent of the quality of the pollen
   reward, suggesting that they are responding more strongly to cues
   unassociated with rewards than to those correlated with rewards. If so,
   this suggests that a sensory bias or some level of deception may be
   involved with advertisement to pollinators in M. guttatus.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},

Abstract = {{Floral herbivory may have deleterious effects on the reproductive
   success of flowering plants. However, plants may evolve floral traits
   that allow them to defend against herbivory in particular conditions. A
   bumblebee-pollinated subalpine herb, Pedicularis rex (Orobanchaceae),
   endemic to southwest China, has cup-like bracts that fill with
   rainwater, which submerges its corolla tubes. We hypothesized that these
   water-filled cupulate bracts function to deter nectar robbers and/or
   seed herbivores. To test these hypotheses, we experimentally drained
   bracts and measured both the response of mutualistic floral visitors and
   antagonistic nectar robbers and seed predators and their effects on seed
   production. Our observations revealed that neither nectar robbers nor
   legitimate pollinators discriminated between water-drained flowers and
   intact controls. However, seed predation significantly increased in
   drained flowers, suggesting that water-filled bracts help protect the
   flowers from seed herbivores. The water-filled bracts in P. rex may
   represent an adaptation to reduce floral herbivory in a high-rainfall
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecosystem service affected by anthropogenic activity,
   often resulting in reduced fruit set and increased extinction risk.
   Orchids worldwide have a wide range of pollination systems, but many New
   Zealand orchids are self-pollinating. We studied the pollination system
   of three saprophytic native orchids from the genus Gastrodia in modified
   landscapes in Canterbury, New Zealand: G. cunninghamii, G. minor, and an
   undescribed taxon G. ``long column{''}. The species showed two distinct
   pollination systems. Gastrodia cunninghamii and G. minor were autonomous
   selfing species. In contrast, G. ``long column{''} had almost no fruit
   set when pollinators were excluded, and was visited by the endemic New
   Zealand bee Lasioglossum sordidum, which acted as a pollen vector in
   order to produce fruit. Visitation rate by L. sordidum varied among four
   sites around Christchurch, and natural fruit set in G. ``long column{''}
   ranged from 76\% where L. sordidum were abundant to 10\% where bees were
   not observed. Oddly, some of the highest natural fruit-set rates were at
   a highly modified urban site. Therefore, while some Gastrodia species
   are dependent on native pollinators, they can still persist in highly
   modified landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of ground-nesting bees was investigated using transects
   of water traps in a mosaic of nesting and forage habitats at Shotover
   Hill in Oxfordshire, UK. The site includes a large area of
   ground-nesting bee activity and is adjoined on three sides by floristic
   hay meadows. This study showed that the females of small bee species
   (<1.5 mm intertegular span) that were foraging in the hay meadows
   demonstrated a functional limitation to their homing range. The
   abundance of small bees declined rapidly with increasing distance from
   areas of high density nesting; declining more rapidly than might be
   expected from uniform dispersal into the surrounding landscape. By
   modelling the occurrence of bees along each transect it was found that
   the probability of observing a small bee in the hay meadows was reduced
   to 10\% at a distance of 250-370 m from the nesting habitat. The result
   emphasises the scale on which habitat fragmentation will begin to impact
   upon bee diversity, and the relative contribution of managed ``pollen
   and nectar{''} strips to areas of nesting habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The effective floral neighbourhood is the radius around a plant where
   the density of flowering plants and other factors affect visitation
   rates and pollination success of plants. This study aims to determine
   this radius and focuses on the effects of conspecific plant density,
   plant sex and the amount of shrub vegetation on visitation rates of
   Clusia blattophila, a dioecious bush pollinated by Amazonina
   platystylata cockroaches. The number of visits did not differ between
   flower sexes but cockroaches spent less time on the rewardless female
   flowers. The density effect was scale dependent. The distribution of
   flowering individuals within the 15-m radius had a significant positive
   effect on flower visitation rates. At a larger scale (35-45-m radius),
   an increase in density of male plants led to a decrease in visitation
   rates, indicating competition for pollinators. Within the smaller
   radius, the facilitative effect was probably induced by elevated floral
   advertisement and high mobility of cockroaches at this scale. Within the
   larger radii, the results indicated that cockroach mobility was
   restricted and population density was stable at this scale. Density of
   male plants affected visitation rates because only male plants reward
   pollinators. Hence, male plants were the true competitors.}},

Title = {{Flower colour polymorphism in Lysimachia arvensis: How is the red morph
   maintained in Mediterranean environments?}},
Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{142-150}},
Abstract = {{The maintenance of floral polymorphisms within natural populations is
   enigmatic, because directional selection imposed by biotic or abiotic
   selective agents combined with random genetic drift should lead to the
   rapid loss of floral variation. Lysimachia arvensis is a polymorphic
   species with red and blue flowers, red colour being genetically
   dominant. Both morphs show differences in fitness due to climatic
   factors, and the blue performs better in xeric Mediterranean
   environments where red-flowered plants persist in low proportion.
   Although the role of abiotic factors as selective agent has been
   studied, the selection mediated by pollinators has still not been
   considered. Experimental manipulations of morph frequencies were made to
   measure the effect of flower colour on pollinator visitation. Moreover,
   selection analyses on both male and female fitness were used in three
   populations with different morph proportions. Blue flowers are perceived
   by pollinators as UV-blue while red flowers are perceived as UV, but the
   contrast between blue flowers and the background is stronger than that
   of red flowers. Solitary bees were the main pollinators and exerted
   phenotypic selection on flower colour (quantified by bee vision) but not
   on flower size. Blue flowers were visited at a higher rate than
   expected, based on their frequency in populations. In the three
   populations studied, male success was markedly higher in the blue morph
   but colour had no consistent effect on female success. We found strong
   directional phenotypic selection for blue flowers through male function
   in the two blue-biased populations, and through female function only in
   the most blue-biased population. Therefore, in Mediterranean areas, not
   only is the blue morph favoured by climatic factors, but it is also
   selected by pollinators. Thus, selection by pollinators or climatic
   factors does not explain the maintenance of red flowered plants in
   Mediterranean areas. The delayed selfing mechanism of L. arvensis could
   offer reproductive assurance when outcross pollen is limited, mitigating
   the effects of both biotic and abiotic selective agents and protecting
   the red morph. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees are increasingly applied on Neotropical biomonitoring and
   bioindication studies due to the relative easiness of sampling and
   identification when compared to other bee groups. A considerable number
   of orchid bee community studies have been adopting baited traps as a
   sampling method, especially for replication purposes. However, the trap
   attributes are variable, and hitherto no evaluation of different designs
   was carried out. Here, five attributes of baited traps were tested: trap
   volume, number of entrance holes, presence of landing platform, kind of
   landing platform, and fixation content. We use Mann-Whitney tests to
   access differences in richness and abundance capture rates for each trap
   design. We found that volume, number of entrance holes, and fixation
   content do not influence orchid bees capture. However, the design
   without landing platforms had a significantly higher capture rate for
   richness when compared with sanded landing platforms. On the other hand,
   analyzing the kind of landing platform, we detected a significantly
   higher richness and abundance for the trap with landing platforms glued
   with sand. Despite the fact that the effects of different designs tested
   here were very punctual, we consider that results from samples taken
   with different baited trap designs are comparable. Some adjustments on
   trap design can be done according to the particularities of future
   studies. (C) 2015 Sociedade Brasileira de Entomologia. Published by

Abstract = {{Introduction. Many cultivated plants do well with exotic pollinators,
   and native pollinators can also serve exotic crops. Both can be
   optimized for agriculture. We studied Nephelium lappaceum L.
   (Sapindaceae), an andro-dioecious Asian plant, in tropical Mexico. The
   hermaphrodite flowers were not known to shed viable pollen, and
   outcrossing from male pollinating plants was thought essential for
   efficient horticulture. Materials and methods. We used the locally
   developed CERI61 variety of rambutan and conducted experiments on
   pollination and fruit yield. An orchard of 1,000 trees was studied
   intensively during two flowering seasons in Chiapas, Mexico. Plantation
   yields were recorded for 10 years. We compared open pollination
   experiments with pollinator exclusion and `induced pollination'
   treatments. We caged some trees with colonies of stingless bees:
   Scaptotrigona and Tetragonisca. Results and discussion. Caged flowers
   produced fruit, with no male plant present. Pollen dehisced and was
   viable on approximately 5\% of flowers. Trees caged with pollinators,
   and open pollination treatments revealed 9.1 times more mature fruit
   than trees without pollinators. Fruit mass was significantly higher in
   induced pollination treatments. Yields exceeding 7 t ha(-1) were
   obtained during a ten-year test period. Scaptotrigona mexicana (Apidae,
   Meliponini) was the main pollinator, followed by social halictid bees
   (Halictus hesperus). Feral Africanized honeybees were not strongly
   attracted to flowers. Conclusion. Both stingless bee species in open
   pollination treatments and within cages showed that fruit production
   increased nearly 10-fold in this variety of rambutan. Although
   outcrossing versus selfing did not affect initial mature fruit set, a
   superior fruit yield, in weight and size, was obtained from selfing
   mediated by pollinators in caged trees.}},

Abstract = {{Floral rewards such as nectar and pollen have a major influence on
   successful pollination and fruit-set, even in self-fertile Rubus sp.
   (Rosaceae), which include most cultivated raspberries and blackberries.
   A 2-year study was designed to examine the diurnal dynamics of nectar
   secretion and pollen shedding in the raspberry cultivars `Autumn Bliss'
   and `Mailing Exploit', and in the blackberry cultivars `Arapaho' and
   `Hull', in order to establish the effect of these traits on floral
   attractiveness to various insect visitors. The volume of nectar secreted
   per flower was measured using calibrated capillaries, and the
   concentrations of sugars in the nectar were measured using a hand-held
   refractometer. The four Rubus cultivars differed in their patterns of
   nectar and pollen presentation. Volumes of nectar and concentrations of
   sugars were influenced by year, cultivar, age of the flower, and time of
   sampling. The four cultivars exhibited different patterns of nectar
   secretion over the 2 years. In year-1, an early morning peak in nectar
   volume was followed by a rapid decline, while the concentrations of
   sugars increased during the day. In year-2, both the volume of nectar
   and the concentrations of sugars increased from the morning to the
   afternoon. The patterns of pollen presentation were similar in both
   years of study. Anther dehiscence took only 3 - 8 h per flower in the
   poorest nectar producer, `Arapaho'; while, in cultivars with higher
   nectar yields, pollen shedding lasted for 6 10 h. Pollen-shedding
   flowers secreted significantly higher volumes of nectar, with
   significantly lower concentrations of sugars, compared to
   pre-pollen-shedding flowers in year-1. The concentrations of sugars in
   the nectar were higher in both raspberry cultivars than in the
   blackberry cultivars, but both blackberry cultivars were as attractive
   to bees due to their more appealing nectar sugar composition. Bees were
   more attracted to flowers of cultivars which simultaneously offered
   ample nectar and some pollen (i.e., `Autumn Bliss', `Malting Exploit',
   and `Hull') than to flowers with a rapid rate of pollen shedding, but a
   low nectar yield (i.e., `Arapaho'). Higher rates of bee-mediated
   cross-pollination may provide economically important increases in fruit
   yields and better quality fruit.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to evaluate the floral biology and
   pollination requirements of seeded and seedless mini watermelon
   varieties, and to determine the best varieties to cultivate under
   protected environment. Three seedless (HA-5106, HA-5158, and HA-5161)
   and two seeded (Minipol and Polimore) genotypes were tested. Flowers
   were monitored from the pre-anthesis stage to senescence, and fruit
   quality was also evaluated. The evaluated treatments were
   hand-geitonogamous pollination (MG), cross-pollination with pollen from
   the Polimore variety (MCP), cross-pollination with pollen from the
   Minipol variety (MCM), and restricted pollination. All varieties had
   monoecious plants with diclinous flowers, and the stigmas remained
   receptive throughout anthesis. Fruit set rates of 84.62\% (MG), 61.54\%
   (MCP), 48\% (MCM), and 0\% (restricted) were obtained for seeded
   varieties, but of 0\% (MG), 76.36\% (MCP), 82.69\% (MCM), and 0\%
   (restricted) for seedless varieties. Fruits did not differ in quality
   among treatments within each genotype. Therefore, all the studied
   varieties require a pollination agent and diploid pollen for fruit set
   to occur, regardless of the donor variety; and Minipol or Polimore with
   HA-5106 or HA-5158 are the varieties recommended for cultivation in
   protected environment.}},

   agriculture?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{59-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Current national and global scale monetary valuation of pollination
   services do not accurately estimate the contribution of wild pollinators
   to agricultural production. First, ecosystem (wild) pollination services
   remain largely bundled with those of managed pollinators. This problem
   is compounded by the fact that the dependency of crops on pollination, a
   key parameter used in current valuations, does not reflect variation in
   pollinator density, crop cultivars and growing conditions that exist in
   practice. Over half of the 153 billion of estimated global pollination
   service value in 2005 is based on estimates of pollinator dependency
   from crops with fewer than three field studies that measure actual
   levels of pollinator activity and corresponding fruit set. The resulting
   uncertainty may be most distorting when applied to widely-planted
   intensive oilseed crops. Furthermore, current valuations are underpinned
   by simplistic assumptions regarding the likelihood of pollinator decline
   and the impact on agricultural prices. Although efforts to motivate wild
   pollinator protection through their ecosystem service value remain
   highly circumscribed by conceptual and empirical limitations, we
   identify the need to go beyond technical solutions and develop a
   critical framework that could account for why pollinator conservation
   has come to be predominantly justified in these terms to begin with. (C)

Abstract = {{Long-term grassland fallow and short-term meadow fallow represent
   alternative fallowing strategies for biodiversity conservation on
   farmland. Conventional grassland mixtures are used to establish
   long-term grassland fallows, whereas short-term meadow fallows are sown
   with specific meadow seed mixtures and require regular re-establishment
   to maintain the abundance of sown species. This study examined the
   impact of fallow type and landscape structure on the species richness
   and abundance of four taxa: plants, bumblebees, butterflies and birds.
   Long-term grassland fallows and short-term meadow fallows were studied
   in four contrasting landscape types in Finland, differing in the cover
   of forest and perennial grasslands. The fallow type and landscape
   structure affected each species group differently, and the value of a
   particular fallow type was also modified by landscape setting.
   Bumblebees were most abundant in short-term meadow fallows, whereas
   butterflies benefited more from long-term grassland fallows. Species
   richness of plants and butterflies were higher in forested than in open
   landscapes. Long-term grassland fallows promoted species richness of
   butterflies as well as the abundance of foraging edge birds in forested
   landscapes, whereas short-term meadow fallows enhanced the abundance of
   foraging edge birds in open landscapes. In landscapes with high
   grassland cover, the breeding density of open farmland birds was higher
   in meadow fallows than in grassland fallows, while the reverse was true
   in landscapes with low perennial grassland cover. The fallowing strategy
   thus can be adapted to the landscape context depending on the specific
   objectives. For overall biodiversity enhancement, establishing and
   managing different kinds of fallows is important. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Limited resources and taxonomic expertise in biodiversity surveys often
   lead to the application of the higher taxa approach (HTA), i.e., the
   identification of specimens to genus or higher taxonomic levels rather
   than to species. The reliability of the HTA varies significantly among
   studies, yet the factors underlying this variability have rarely been
   investigated. Bees are an ideal model taxon for testing the HTA because
   they are highly diverse, challenging to identify, and there is
   widespread interest in their role as native pollinators, driving demand
   for efficient diversity assessment tools. Using extensive bee data sets
   collected across three biomes and various habitats, we assessed the
   performance of the HTA in reflecting bee species richness and
   composition patterns at local scales, factors affecting this
   performance, and ways to improve it. The performance of the HTA varied
   considerably among biomes, taxonomic levels (genera and subfamilies),
   and diversity measures (species richness and composition); genus and
   subfamily richness accounted for 55-77\% and 32-61\% of the variation in
   species richness, respectively; genus and subfamily composition
   accounted for 28-87\% and 26-80\% of the variation in species
   composition, respectively. The number of species per higher taxon was a
   main factor influencing this performance (accounting for 63\% of the
   variation), while the co-occurrence of taxonomically related species had
   no significant influence on the performance of the HTA. Further
   subdividing genera by body size contributed to the performance of the
   HTA and increased its accuracy in representation of compositional
   patterns by; 16\%. Our results have several practical implications. The
   considerable variability found in the performance of the HTA in
   representing local-scale richness and composition patterns of bee
   species dictates caution in implementing this tool in bee surveys. When
   possible, an a priori evaluation of the expected performance of the HTA
   should be done, focusing on species distributions within higher
   taxonomic levels and the species : higher taxa ratio. Integrating
   morphological characteristics (such as body size) that consistently
   subdivide genera will improve the HTA's performance. Our results are
   likely applicable to the implementation of the HTA in other small-bodied
   and species-rich groups and may contribute to the cost-effectiveness of
   biodiversity surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Ants often visit flowers, but have only seldom been documented to
   provide effective pollination services. Floral visitation by ants can
   also compromise plant reproduction in situations where ants interfere
   with more effective pollinators. Introduced ants may be especially
   likely to reduce plant reproductive success through floral visitation,
   but existing experimental studies have found little support for this
   hypothesis. Here, we combine experimental and observational approaches
   to examine the importance of floral visitation by the nonnative
   Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) on plant species native to Santa Cruz
   Island, California, USA. First, we determine how L. humile affects
   floral visitor diversity, bee visitation rates, and levels of pollen
   limitation for the common, focal plant species island morning glory
   (Calystegia macrostegia ssp. macrostegia). Second, we assess the broader
   ecological consequences of floral visitation by L. hum lie by comparing
   floral visitation networks between invaded and uninvaded sites. The
   Argentine ant and native ants both visited island morning glory flowers,
   but L. humile was much more likely to behave aggressively towards other
   floral visitors and to be the sole floral occupant. The presence of L.
   humile in morning glory flowers reduced floral visitor diversity,
   decreased rates of bee visitation, and increased levels of pollen
   limitation. Network comparisons between invaded and uninvaded sites
   revealed differences in both network structure and species-level
   attributes. In invaded sites, floral visitors were observed on fewer
   plant species, ants had a higher per-plant interaction strength relative
   to that of other visitors, and interaction strengths between bees and
   plants were weaker. These results illustrate that introduced ants can
   negatively affect plant reproduction and potentially disrupt pollination
   services at an ecosystem scale.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of Rhododendron cyanocarpum (Franch.) W. W.
   Smith, an alpine species endemic to NW Yunnan, China, was investigated
   between 2007 and 2008. Floral traits including flowering time, floral
   morphology, petal color, and floral scents were assessed, and the
   associated pollinator assemblage and their foraging behavior were
   recorded. The flowering period of R. cyanocarpum ranges from late March
   to middle May and a single flower can last 8-10 days in its natural
   habitat. Flowers generally show marked herkogamy and the protruding
   style encourages pollinator foraging behavior that counteracts
   self-pollination. Floral scents comprise mostly aliphatics (64.37\%) and
   terpenoids (29.88\%), which make the flowers attractive for several
   insect groups, but a peak at 430nm in the reflectance spectrum of petals
   suggest selection for the attraction of bumblebees. The two Bombus
   species, B. festivus and B. richardsiellus, representing 90\% of total
   recorded visits, were the only insect species that can be considered to
   effectively pollinate R. cyanocarpum. Pollination treatments indicated
   the general self-compatibility of R. cyanocarpum; however, outcrossing
   seemed to be the dominant strategy, with low rates of self-fertilization
   providing a certain level of reproductive assurance in its alpine
   habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Some plant families have a specialized type of pollination system, with
   floral lipid rewards for pollinators, which is common. In neotropical
   Malpighiaceae species like Pterandra pyroidea, this specialized type of

   pollen reward. Mass spectrometric analysis (GC/MS-EI) indicated that P.
   pyroidea floral oil has a unique chemical composition, i.e., few fatty
   acid constituents possessing acetoxy groups at positions 5 and 7, which
   is distinct from the other floral oils of sympatric Malpighiaceae
   species. The structure of the major floral oil constituent, a novel
   fatty acid, anti-5,7-diacetoxydocosanoic acid, was confirmed based on
   synthesis, mass fragmentation, and H-1 and C-13 NMR analyses; the

Abstract = {{Banana passionfruit (Passiflora tripartita var. mollissima) is a noxious
   vine that is invasive in forest patches in coastal regions throughout
   New Zealand. We investigated the dispersal mechanisms that facilitate
   its spread in the Marlborough Sounds. To find out which animals act as
   dispersers, we monitored tagged fruits in the field. Fruits were removed
   quickly after ripening. Significantly fewer fruits were wholly removed
   from off-road locations than locations on road edges, but removal was
   high in both cases (70\% and 93\% respectively) indicating likely
   dispersal by both humans and wild animals. We found no evidence of
   dispersal by birds, but infrared cameras documented possums and rats
   consuming fruits in the field. To investigate the effect of fruit
   handling on germination, we compared germination success between
   hand-cleaned seeds, fleshy seeds and intact fruits in the field and
   glasshouse. Seeds germinated readily in all treatments, with no
   significant difference between treatments, so seeds do not require
   frugivore handling to germinate. In addition, we measured the
   germination of seeds extracted from 1.5 kg of feral pig faeces collected
   from Sus scrofa at Te Weuweu Bay and from faeces from captive possums
   (Trichosurus vulpecula) and Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). Seeds
   extracted from pig and possum droppings readily germinated, with final
   germination success not significantly different from hand-cleaned or
   in-flesh seeds. None of the few intact seeds excreted by Norway rats
   germinated. Banana passionfruit has formed invasive mutualisms for both
   pollination (with introduced bees) and dispersal (with introduced
   mammals), exacerbating its spread. Weed management should combine direct
   weed control with limiting the spread of banana passionfruit, by
   managing feral pigs and possums.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, plant-pollinator interactions have been interpreted as
   pollination syndrome. However, the validity of pollination syndrome has
   been widely doubted in modern studies of pollination ecology. The
   pollination ecology of five Asian Buddleja species, B.asiatica,
   B.crispa, B.forrestii, B.macrostachya and B.myriantha, in the
   Sino-Himalayan region in Asia, flowering in different local seasons,
   with scented inflorescences were investigated during 2011 and 2012.
   These five species exhibited diverse floral traits, with narrow and long
   corolla tubes and concealed nectar. According to their floral
   morphology, larger bees and Lepidoptera were expected to be the major
   pollinators. However, field observations showed that only larger bees
   (honeybee/bumblebee) were the primary pollinators, ranging from 77.95\%
   to 97.90\% of total visits. In this study, floral scents of each species
   were also analysed using coupled gas chromatography and mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS). Although the five Buddleja species emitted
   differentiated floral scent compositions, our results showed that floral
   scents of the five species are dominated by substances that can serve as
   attractive signals to bees, including species-specific scent compounds
   and principal compounds with larger relative amounts. This suggests that
   floral scent compositions are closely associated with the principal
   pollinator assemblages in these five species. Therefore, we conclude
   that floral scent compositions rather than floral morphology traits
   should be used to interpret plant-pollinator interactions in these Asian
   Buddleja species.}},

Title = {{THE POTENTIAL FOR CROP TO WILD HYBRIDIZATION IN EGGPLANT (SOLANUM
   MELONGENA; SOLANACEAE) IN SOUTHERN INDIA}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: In India and elsewhere, transgenic Bt eggplant
   (Solanum melongena) has been developed to reduce insect herbivore
   damage, but published studies of the potential for pollen-mediated,
   crop-to-wild gene flow are scant. This information is useful for risk
   assessments as well as in situ conservation strategies for wild
   germplasm.
   Methods: In 2010-2014, we surveyed 23 populations of wild/weedy eggplant
   (Solanum insanum; known as wild brinjal), carried out hand-pollination
   experiments, and observed pollinators to assess the potential for
   crop-to-wild gene flow in southern India.
   Key results: Wild brinjal is a spiny, low-growing perennial commonly
   found in disturbed sites such as roadsides, wastelands, and sparsely
   vegetated areas near villages and agricultural fields. Fourteen of the
   23 wild populations in our study occurred within 0.5 km of cultivated
   brinjal and at least nine flowered in synchrony with the crop. Hand
   crosses between wild and cultivated brinjal resulted in seed set and
   viable F-1 progeny. Wild brinjal flowers that were bagged to exclude
   pollinators did not set fruit, and fruit set from manual
   self-pollination was low. The exserted stigmas of wild brinjal are
   likely to promote outcrossing. The most effective pollinators appeared
   to be bees (Amegilla, Xylocopa, Nomia, and Heterotrigona spp.), which
   also were observed foraging for pollen on crop brinjal.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that hybridization is possible between
   cultivated and wild brinjal in southern India. Thus, as part of the risk
   assessment process, we assume that transgenes from the crop could spread
   to wild brinjal populations that occur nearby.}},

Abstract = {{Male Euglossini bees (Apidae) forage for floral and non-floral perfumes.
   Although the use of these perfumes has not yet been clearly reported,
   there are indications of using perfume from varied exogenous sources as
   a pheromone analogue since male orchid bees do not produce it. Here, we
   report an interaction between male Euglossa annectans and flowers of
   Angelonia salicariifolia (Plantaginaceae). Floral anatomy analysis and a
   histological study of two different sets of trichomes indicate the
   presence of aromatic oils (perfume) in one set of these trichomes. The
   other set of trichomes produce resins. Both sets of trichomes are found
   in the same floral area of the flower where the male orchid bees were
   seen. The male orchid bees studied forage for perfumes but do not
   promote pollination since they do not reach the reproductive structures
   during their visit. Our records show that only male E. annectans were
   attracted to the volatile fragrance although we know that other orchid
   bee species also occur in the area.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping is a first step toward
   understanding the genetic basis of adaptive evolution and may also
   reveal reproductive incompatibilities unique to hybrids. In plants, the
   shift from outcrossing to self-pollination is common, providing the
   opportunity for comparisons of QTL architecture among parallel
   evolutionary transitions. We used QTL mapping in hybrids between the
   bee-pollinated monkeyflower Mimulus lewisii and the closely related
   selfer Mimulusparishii to determine the genetic basis of divergence in
   floral traits and flowering time associated with mating-system
   evolution, and to characterize hybrid anther sterility. We found a
   moderately polygenic and highly directional basis for floral size
   evolution, suggesting adaptation from standing variation or in pursuit
   of a moving optimum, whereas only a few major loci accounted for
   substantial flowering-time divergence. Cytonuclear incompatibilities
   caused hybrid anther sterility, confounding estimation of reproductive
   organ QTLs. The genetic architecture of floral traits associated with
   selfing in M.parishii was primarily polygenic, as in other QTL studies
   of this transition, but in contrast to the previously characterized
   oligogenic basis of a pollinator shift in close relatives. Hybrid anther
   sterility appeared parallel at the molecular level to previously
   characterized incompatibilities, but also raised new questions about
   cytonuclear co-evolution in plants.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the inter-play plant-pollinator is essential to develop
   ecosystem services of faba bean and improved populations for low-input
   systems. We analyzed the phenotypic selection exerted by pollinators on
   floral traits involved in the plant pollinator inter-play. We test
   whether variation in pollinator-related floral traits is associated with
   differences among plants in seed production patterns. We used open
   pollination and pollinator-exclusion environments to examine pollinator
   mediated selection and selection for autonomous selfing in six
   gene-pools of Vicia faba over three consecutive years. We recorded, by
   using Digital Image Analysis, functional floral traits related to
   attraction, sexual dimension, and vector matching/pollen transfer
   efficiency. Nine production components were measured to categorize seed
   production patterns. Our approach used a series of Multivariate
   Regression Analyses (MRA) to explore which floral traits provided the
   best models to explain seed production patterns in each gene-pool and
   pollination environment. MRA showed that variation in the incidence of
   pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits or in the selection for
   autonomous selfing can substantially contribute to differences in seed
   patterns. The underlying floral mechanisms are specific to the gene-pool
   and largely unrelated among gene-pools. Consistent results among
   gene-pools involved no evidence of pollinator-mediated selection as
   result of the floral traits under study on the main predictors of crop
   yield, pods and seeds per plant. However, relevant predictors of crop
   yield such as pod length and seed dimensions and weight were
   pollinator-dependent because of pollinator-mediated selection on sexual
   dimension, floral display and vector matching traits. We caution against
   dismissing pollinator-mediated selection as driver of seed production
   patterns variation which may be influenced by the gene-pool and by the
   gene-pool x pollination environment interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination services are economically important component of
   agricultural biodiversity which enhance the yield and quality of many
   crops. An understanding of the suitability of extant habitats for
   pollinating species is crucial for planning management actions to
   protect and manage these service providers. In a highly modified
   agricultural ecosystem, we tested the effect of different pollination
   treatments (open, autonomous self- and wind-pollination) on pod set,
   seed set, and seed weight in field beans (Vicia faba). We also
   investigated the effect of semi-natural habitats and flower abundance on
   pollinators of field beans. Pollinator sampling was undertaken in ten
   field bean fields along a gradient of habitat complexity; CORINE land
   cover classification was used to analyse the land use patterns between
   500-3000 m around the sites. Total yield from open-pollination,
   increased by 185\% compared to autonomous self-pollination. There was
   positive interactive effect of local flower abundance and cover of
   semi-natural habitats on overall abundance of pollinators at 1500 and
   2000m, and abundance of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) at 1000-2000m. In
   contrast, species richness of pollinators was only correlated with
   flower abundance and not with semi-natural habitats. We did not find a
   link between pod set,from open-pollination and pollinator abundance,
   possibly due to variations in the growing conditions and pollinator
   communities between sites. We conclude that insect pollination is
   essential for optimal bean yields and therefore the maintenance of
   semi-natural habitats in agriculture-dominated landscapes should ensure
   stable and more efficient pollination services in field beans. (C) 2014

Title = {{Climate change reduces nectar secretion in two common Mediterranean
   plants}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Global warming can lead to considerable impacts on natural plant
   communities, potentially inducing changes in plant physiology and the
   quantity and quality of floral rewards, especially nectar. Changes in
   nectar production can in turn strongly affect plant-pollinator
   interaction networks-pollinators may potentially benefit under moderate
   warming conditions, but suffer as resources reduce in availability as
   elevated temperatures become more extreme. Here, we studied the effect
   of elevated temperatures on nectar secretion of two Mediterranean
   Lamiaceae species-Ballota acetabulosa and Teucrium divaricatum. We
   measured nectar production (viz. volume per flower, sugar concentration
   per flower and sugar content per flower and per plant), number of open
   and empty flowers per plant, as well as biomass per flower under a range
   of temperatures selected ad hoc in a fully controlled climate chamber
   and under natural conditions outdoors. The average temperature in the
   climate chamber was increased every 3 days in 3 degrees C increments
   from 17.5 to 38.5 degrees C. Both study species showed a unimodal
   response of nectar production (volume per flower, sugar content per
   flower and per plant) to temperature. Optimal temperature for sugar
   content per flower was 25-26 degrees C for B. acetabulosa and 29-33
   degrees C for T. divaricatum. According to our results, moderate climate
   warming predicted for the next few decades could benefit nectar
   secretion in T. divaricatum as long as the plants are not water
   stressed, but have a moderate negative effect on B. acetabulosa.
   Nevertheless, strong warming as predicted by climate change models for
   the end of the 21st century is expected to reduce nectar secretion in
   both species and can thus significantly reduce available resources for
   both wild bees and honeybees in Mediterranean systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Bombus) are pollinators of wild and
   economically important flowering plants. However, at least four bumble
   bee species have declined significantly in population abundance and
   geographic range relative to historic estimates, and one species is
   possibly extinct. While a wealth of historic data is now available for
   many of the North American species found to be in decline in online
   databases, systematic survey data of stable species is still not
   publically available. The availability of contemporary survey data is
   critically important for the future monitoring of wild bumble bee
   populations. Without such data, the ability to ascertain the
   conservation status of bumble bees in the United States will remain
   challenging.
   New information
   This paper describes USBombus, a large database that represents the
   outcomes of one of the largest standardized surveys of bumble bee
   pollinators (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Bombus) globally. The motivation to
   collect live bumble bees across the United States was to examine the
   decline and conservation status of Bombus affinis, B. occidentalis, B.
   pensylvanicus, and B. terricola. Prior to our national survey of bumble
   bees in the United States from 2007 to 2010, there have only been
   regional accounts of bumble bee abundance and richness. In addition to
   surveying declining bumble bees, we also collected and documented a
   diversity of co-occuring bumble bees. However we have not yet completely
   reported their distribution and diversity onto a public online platform.
   Now, for the first time, we report the geographic distribution of bumble
   bees reported to be in decline (Cameron et al. 2011), as well as bumble
   bees that appeared to be stable on a large geographic scale in the
   United States (not in decline). In this database we report a total of
   17,930 adult occurrence records across 397 locations and 39 species of
   Bombus detected in our national survey. We summarize their abundance and
   distribution across the United States and association to different
   ecoregions. The geospatial coverage of the dataset extends across 41 of
   the 50 US states, and from 0 to 3500 m a.s.l. Authors and respective
   field crews spent a total of 512 hours surveying bumble bees from 2007
   to 2010. The dataset was developed using SQL server 2008 r2. For each
   specimen, the following information is generally provided: species,
   name, sex, caste, temporal and geospatial details, Cartesian
   coordinates, data collector(s), and when available, host plants. This
   database has already proven useful for a variety of studies on bumble
   bee ecology and conservation. However it is not publicly available.
   Considering the value of pollinators in agriculture and wild ecosystems,
   this large database of bumble bees will likely prove useful for
   investigations of the effects of anthropogenic activities on pollinator
   community composition and conservation status.}},

   Species Composition, Distribution, Seasonal Biology, and Parasites}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Despite the ecological and agricultural significance of bumble bees in
   Alaska, very little is known and published about this important group at
   the regional level. The objectives of this study were to provide
   baseline data on species composition, distribution, seasonal biology,
   and parasites of the genus Bombus at three major agricultural locations
   within Alaska: Fairbanks, Delta Junction, and Palmer, to lay the
   groundwork for future research on bumble bee pollination in Alaska.
   New information
   A total of 8,250 bumble bees representing 18 species was collected from
   agricultural settings near Delta Junction, Fairbanks, and Palmer, Alaska
   in 2009 and 2010. Of the 8,250 specimens, 51\% were queens, 32.7\% were
   workers, and 16.2\% were males. The species composition and relative
   abundances varied among sites and years. Delta Junction had the highest
   relative abundance of bumble bees, representing 51.6\% of the specimens
   collected; the other two locations, Fairbanks and Palmer represented
   26.5\% and 21.8\% of the overall catch respectively. The species
   collected were: Bombus bohemicus Seidl 1837 (= B. ashtoni (Cresson
   1864)), B. balteatus Dahlbom 1832, B. bifarius Cresson 1878, B.
   centralis Cresson 1864, B. cryptarum (Fabricius 1775) (= B. moderatus
   Cresson 1863), B. distinguendus Morawitz 1869, B. flavidus Eversmann
   1852 (= B. fernaldae Franklin 1911), B. flavifrons Cresson 1863, B.
   frigidus Smith 1854, B. insularis (Smith 1861), B. jonellus (Kirby
   1802), B. melanopygus Nylander 1848, B. mixtus Cresson 1878, B.
   neoboreus Sladen 1919, B. occidentalis Greene 1858, B. perplexus Cresson
   1863, B. rufocinctus Cresson 1863, and B. sylvicola Kirby 1837. Overall,
   the most common bumble bees near agricultural lands were B. centralis,
   B. frigidus, B. jonellus, B. melanopygus, B. mixtus, and B.
   occidentalis. Species' relative population densities and local diversity
   were highly variable from year to year. Bombus occidentalis, believed to
   be in decline in the Pacific Northwest states, represented 10.4\% of the
   overall specimens collected from the three sites studied. Bumble bees
   were found to be infected by Nosema and nematodes with infection rates
   up to 2.1\% and 16.7\% respectively. Of the eight species infected by
   parasites, B. occidentalis displayed the highest Nosema infection, while
   B. centralis was the species with the highest infection of nematodes. To
   our knowledge this represents the first multi-year study on bumble bees
   from the main agricultural areas of Alaska to provide baseline data on
   species composition, distribution, seasonal biology, and parasites of
   the genus Bombus.}},

Abstract = {{The bird pollination syndrome is characterized by red, unscented flowers
   with dilute nectar in long nectar tubes. However, the extent to which
   plants with such traits actually depend on birds for seed production is
   seldom determined experimentally, and traits such as colour and scent
   production are often assessed only subjectively. We documented bird
   pollination and quantified floral traits in the critically endangered
   Satyrium rhodanthum (Orchidaceae) from mistbelt grasslands in the
   summer-rainfall region of South Africa. Direct observations and motion
   trigger camera footage revealed amethyst sunbirds as the only
   pollinators, despite the presence of other potential pollinators.
   Experimental exclusion of sunbirds significantly reduced pollination and
   fruit set to near zero. Pollination success in naturally pollinated
   plants was close to 100\% in one year, and fruit set varied from 23 to
   64\% in other years. Pollen transfer efficiency was 5.8\%, which is
   lower than in related insect-pollinated species, probably due to a
   tendency of birds to wipe pollinaria from their beak. Flowers of
   S.rhodanthum only reflect light in the red range of the spectrum, and
   they produce only a few aliphatic and monoterpene scent compounds at
   comparatively low emission rates. Nectar volume and sugar concentration
   varied between 2.7 and 3.7L and 23.7 and 25.9\%, respectively. We
   conclude that S.rhodanthum is highly specialized for pollination by
   sunbirds. Colour, scent and nectar characteristics differ from
   insect-pollinated Satyrium species and are consistent with those
   expected for bird-pollinated flowers, and may contribute to lack of
   visitation by other potential long-tongued pollinators. Habitat loss
   probably underlies the critically endangered conservation status of
   S.rhodanthum, but the specialization for pollination by a single bird
   species means that reproduction in this orchid is vulnerable to losses
   in surrounding communities of plants that subsidize the energetic
   requirements of sunbirds.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{Large-scale use of the persistent and potent neonicotinoid and fipronil
   insecticides has raised concerns about risks to ecosystem functions
   provided by a wide range of species and environments affected by these
   insecticides. The concept of ecosystem services is widely used in
   decision making in the context of valuing the service potentials,
   benefits, and use values that well-functioning ecosystems provide to
   humans and the biosphere and, as an endpoint (value to be protected), in
   ecological risk assessment of chemicals. Neonicotinoid insecticides are
   frequently detected in soil and water and are also found in air, as dust
   particles during sowing of crops and aerosols during spraying. These
   environmental media provide essential resources to support biodiversity,
   but are known to be threatened by long-term or repeated contamination by
   neonicotinoids and fipronil. We review the state of knowledge regarding
   the potential impacts of these insecticides on ecosystem functioning and
   services provided by terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems including soil
   and freshwater functions, fisheries, biological pest control, and
   pollination services. Empirical studies examining the specific impacts
   of neonicotinoids and fipronil to ecosystem services have focused
   largely on the negative impacts to beneficial insect species (honeybees)
   and the impact on pollination service of food crops. However, here we
   document broader evidence of the effects on ecosystemfunctions
   regulating soil and water quality, pest control, pollination, ecosystem
   resilience, and community diversity. In particular, microbes,
   invertebrates, and fish play critical roles as decomposers, pollinators,
   consumers, and predators, which collectively maintain healthy
   communities and ecosystem integrity. Several examples in this review
   demonstrate evidence of the negative impacts of systemic insecticides on
   decomposition, nutrient cycling, soil respiration, and / invertebrate
   populations valued by humans. Invertebrates, particularly earthworms
   that are important for soil processes, wild and domestic insect
   pollinators which are important for plant and crop production, and
   several freshwater taxa which are involved in aquatic nutrient cycling,
   were all found to be highly susceptible to lethal and sublethal effects
   of neonicotinoids and/ or fipronil at environmentally relevant
   concentrations. By contrast, most microbes and fish do not appear to be
   as sensitive under normal exposure scenarios, though the effects on fish
   may be important in certain realms such as combined fish-rice farming
   systems and through food chain effects. We highlight the economic and
   cultural concerns around agriculture and aquaculture production and the
   role these insecticides may have in threatening food security. Overall,
   we recommend improved sustainable agricultural practices that restrict
   systemic insecticide use to maintain and support several ecosystem
   services that humans fundamentally depend on.}},

Abstract = {{Osmia rufa L. (Osmia bicornis L.) is a species of a solitary bee, which
   pollinates many wild and cultivated plants. A total of 900 cocoons
   containing mature individuals of Osmia rufa L. (450 females and 450
   males of a known weight), were placed in each of four habitats (orchard,
   mixed forest, hay meadow and arboretum of the Dendrology Institute of
   the Polish Academy of Sciences at Kornik). These bees were provided with
   artificial nests made of the stems of common reed. The following
   parameters were calculated: reproduction dynamics, total number of
   chambers built by females, mean number of breeding chambers per reed
   tube and mean number of cocoons per tube. Included in the analysis were
   also the nectar flowers and weather conditions recorded in each of the
   habitats studied. General linear mixed models indicated that the highest
   number of chambers was recorded in the hay meadow (6.6 per tube).
   However, the number of cocoons per tube was similar in the hay meadow,
   forest and orchard (4.5-4.8 per tube) but was significantly lower in the
   arboretum (3.0 cocoons per tube on average). Also, the highest
   reproduction coefficient, 317.5\%, was recorded in the hay meadows. Some
   nests were also parasitized and the highest mean number of infected

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{9-15}},
Abstract = {{The floral morphology of enantiostylous species favours pollen flow
   between floral morphs because it relegates pollen deposition and capture
   to opposite sides of a pollinator's body. This functionality of floral
   morphology acts as a barrier to spontaneous self-pollination. Although
   numerous enantiostylous species exhibit this pattern, there are a number
   of variations, which might play important roles in the evolution of
   reproductive systems of atypical species. This study aimed to
   investigate the self-incompatibility and intramorph incompatibility
   mechanisms of monomorphic enantiostylous species, considering six
   species and one variety of Cassiinae. Data on floral morphology,
   pollinator behaviour, patterns of pollen deposition and capture, and
   breeding system were collected. All species exhibit heteranthery that
   results in distinct functions of stamens. Six bee species pollinated the
   flowers when grasping onto the anthers and generated vibratory movements
   that resulted in pollen release. Pollen deposition and capture occurred
   on opposite sides of a pollinator's body for the majority of Cassiinae
   species. All of the evaluated species were self- and
   intramorph-compatible, except Senna martiana, that seemed to exhibit a
   case of late-acting self-incompatibility. The absence of physiological
   self-incompatibility mechanisms in most of the studied species
   reinforces the relevance of floral morphology and the interaction with
   pollinators for the reproductive success of monomorphic enantiostylous
   species. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Floral biology and breeding system of Impatiens balfourii
   (Balsaminaceae): An exotic species in extension in temperate areas}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{70-75}},
Abstract = {{Annual alien species are dependent on their sexual reproductive success
   to establish, maintain and spread their populations. As the annual
   exotic Impatiens balfourii (Balsaminaceae) is spreading in several
   temperate countries, we assessed its characteristics linked to sexual
   reproduction. The reproductive traits and the breeding system which
   could indicate some trends that might favour population spread and
   invasion were examined. Hand pollination treatments were performed under
   controlled conditions to evaluate (1) autonomous selfing ability, (2)
   self-compatibility and (3) inbreeding depression. Floral biology
   including morphology as well as nectar and pollen production was also
   assessed.
   Impatiens balfourii presented large quantities (6.7 mu l/flower) of
   sucrose dominant nectar. Sucrose dominant nectars are known as highly
   attractive for bees, potential pollinators of I. balfourii. Total sugar
   concentration of the nectar (47\%) was high and situated within the
   range of bee-pollinated plants. Following hand pollination treatments,
   fruit and seed sets were similar after cross- and self- pollination. The
   species was thus self-compatible and no inbreeding depression was
   detected. The flowers were not totally protandrous as the stigmas were
   already receptive at bud stage. Autonomous selfing ability was high at
   the seed but low at the fruit level. In conclusion, the species presents
   traits linked to a high attractiveness for pollinators and a high
   fecundity that might allow high reproductive output. The invasive
   potential still needs to be estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All

   pubipetala (Malpighiaceae), a neotropical species}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{211}},
Pages = {{26-39}},
Abstract = {{Detailed studies on the distribution, structure, and secretion activity
   of floral glands are important to understand the relationship of flowers
   with oil-collecting bees in Malpighiaceae. Here, we characterised the
   floral biology and the glands in sepals, petals and connective tissues
   of Diplopterys pubipetala. The data on the floral biology were obtained
   under field conditions. The samples from functional flowers were
   prepared for anatomical, histochemical and ultrastructural studies. The
   bees of the genera Monoeca and Centris were the most frequent visitors.
   While both insects searched for oil, the former also collected pollen
   and connective tissue secretions. The conspicuous and subsessile sepal
   glands are arranged in pairs on the abaxial surface, presenting
   structural and cellular machinery typical of epithelial elaiophores. The
   oil is accumulated in the subcuticular space and released when the bee
   scraps the cuticle, causing its rupture. The petal glands, observed at
   the fimbriate edges, are diminutive, comprising secretory epithelium
   surrounding a central core of parenchymal cells supplied with vascular
   tissues. The petal glands are typically osmophores, and secretion occurs
   via diffusion through the thin cuticle. The glandular connective
   comprises large globular secretory epithelial cells, which produce a
   bright and viscous secretion, mimicking pollen grains. This
   predominantly hydrophilic secretion is released to the surface of the
   connective tissue traversing the thin cell wall and intact cuticle in
   regions with protruding protoplasts. In addition, the sticky secretion
   produced from the glandularconnectives might also increase the
   efficiency of transport and pollen transfer. Taken together, these
   results show that each gland has a peculiar mechanism and type of
   secretion, suggesting additional levels of floral specialisation for
   interactions with pollinators. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Polaskia chende is a columnar cactus endemic to central Mexico, where it
   is managed via silviculture due to its edible fruits. We aimed to
   analyse the consequences of management on population genetics and
   compared information from different markers to analyse ecological and
   evolutionary aspects of incipient domestication and genetic resources
   conservation. Eight populations were evaluated using seven
   microsatellite loci and 15 allozyme loci. SSR identified higher genetic
   diversity (A = 5.6, p = 98.2, H-E = 0.651) than allozymes (A(r) = 2.6, p
   = 93.3, H-E = 0.479). Both marker types identified that H-O and H-E were
   higher in wild populations (SSR: H-O = 0.730; H-E = 0.677; allozymes:
   H-O = 0.432; H-E = 0.481) than in the managed ones (SSR: H-O = 0.652;
   H-E = 0.616; allozymes: H-O = 0.417; H-E = 0.474), but differences were
   significant only analysed by SSR. SSR identified 3 \% of genetic
   structure between wild and managed populations and 10 \% among
   populations (I center dot(PR) = 0.099), a much lower estimate than with
   allozymes (I center dot(PR) = 0.208). The results suggest that
   management has had only slight consequences on the population genetics
   of P. chende. Artificial selection operates at low intensity and life
   history traits of the species, particularly the self-incompatible
   breeding system, pollination by bees and seed dispersion by birds, bats
   and humans favour high genetic diversity and gene flow. SSR detect finer
   genetic variation than allozymes, but both marker types provide similar
   patterns of information useful for analysing population genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Although Hoplitis tuberculata is a rather common bee species in the
   upper montane and subalpine zone of the Alps, its biology is only
   fragmentarily known. In the present publication, both nest architecture
   and pollen host spectrum are described. H. tuberculata nests in insect
   borings in dead wood, where one to several brood cells are built in a
   linear series. Examination of four nests obtained from trap nests
   revealed three peculiar characteristics of its nest architecture: i) the
   0.3-0.5 cm thick partitions between the brood cells are three-layered
   consisting of two walls built from masticated leaves which enclose an
   interlayer that is densely packed with pebbles, earth crumbs and other
   small particles; ii) in the majority of the nests, a vestibule varying
   in length from 2.2-8.9 cm and loosely filled with small particles is
   present between the outermost cell partition and the nest plug; iii) the
   nest is sealed by a 1.2-1.9 cm long plug consisting of two walls of
   masticated leaves which enclose a space that is densely packed with
   small particles and divided up by one to three additional walls. The
   nest architecture of H. tuberculata is unique among Palaearctic osmiine
   bees; however, it corresponds to that of three North American species
   closely related to H. tuberculata. Microscopical analysis of female
   pollen loads and brood cell provisions revealed that H. tuberculata is
   polylectic with a strong preference for Fabaceae. Among the Fabaceae,
   Lotus and Hippocrepis were by far the most important pollen hosts.
   Non-Fabaceae taxa represented by substantial proportions in pollen loads
   or cell provisions were Helianthemum (Cistaceae), Vaccinium (Ericaceae)
   and Rubus (Rosaceae).}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have examined the reproductive ecology of mycoheterotrophic
   plants, but the existing literature hypothesizes that they adopt a
   self-pollinating strategy. Although growing evidence indicates that some
   rewarding mycoheterotrophic plants depend (at least partially) on an
   insect-mediated pollination system, it remains unclear whether some
   mycoheterotrophic plants can attract pollinators without nectar or other
   rewards. Moreover, in a broader evolutionary/ecological context, the
   question of whether the evolution of mycoheterotrophy induces a shift in
   pollination pattern is still unknown. Here I present a comparative
   investigation into the breeding system of two fully mycoheterotrophic
   orchids, Cymbidium macrorhizon and C. aberrans, and their closest extant
   relative, the mixotrophic C. lancifolium. Pollination experiments were
   conducted to determine the breeding system of these plants. In addition,
   flower visitors that might contribute to pollination were recorded.
   Flowers at different maturity stages were examined to investigate
   mechanisms enabling or limiting self-fertilization. While nectarless
   flowers of C. lancifolium and C. macrorhizon can successfully attract
   potential pollinator honeybees, all three Cymbidium possess an effective
   self-pollination system in which the rostellum that physically separates
   the stigma and pollinia is absent. Because mixotrophic and
   mycoheterotrophic Cymbidium occupy low-light niches, pollinator foraging
   would be negatively influenced by low-light intensity. In partial and
   fully mycoheterotrophic Cymbidium, autogamy would likely be favoured as
   a reproductive assurance to compensate for pollinator limitation due to

Abstract = {{Flowers are complex structures, synchronously displaying both olfactory
   and visual signals/cues in the context of a particular floral
   morphology, that also vary in resource quantity and quality. Despite or
   possibly because of this complexity, many studies focus on a single or
   few traits rather than studying floral phenotypes in a more integrated
   fashion. However, each of these distinct trait classes (signals/cues,
   morphology and resources) mediates interactions with floral visitors,
   demanding a more holistic view of flowers. In our review, we integrate
   floral scents into the broader context of the whole-flower phenotype. We
   discuss the functions of scent bouquets, colouration, morphology and
   rewards in flower visitor interactions from an ecological and
   evolutionary perspective in isolation and taken together. Studies
   demonstrate that floral scent bouquets can act additively or
   synergistically with other modalities, and that their effects on flower
   visitors are context-dependent. We also present field study results
   showing that reward levels modulate dose-dependent responses to
   volatiles by honeybees. To motivate studies examining complex floral
   phenotypes, we outline statistical approaches suited to deal with the
   complex multivariate datasets generated by these studies. We conclude
   with a discussion on why flowers display multimodal traits and suggest
   future research efforts. Our aim is to foster a fresh view on integrated
   floral phenotypes and stimulate studies exploring the combined effects
   of olfactory, visual, morphological and nutritional traits on flower
   animal interactions.}},

Title = {{Concerted Changes in Floral Colour and Scent, and the Importance of
   Spatio-Temporal Variation in Floral Volatiles}},

Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Many floral phenotypes are naturally dynamic, changing shape, colour or
   reward availability as flowers age. Here we explore the dynamic nature
   of floral volatiles, with special reference to the potential for
   concerted changes in floral colour and scent and their functional
   integration as multimodal floral signals. We review the evidence for
   concerted changes in floral colour and scent in the literature and
   survey the most appropriate content- and efficacy-based hypotheses for
   multimodal floral function in such cases. Finally, we analyze
   unpublished data on concerted changes in floral colour and scent
   collected from the colour-changing flowers of the pan-tropical invasive
   weeds Lantana camara, L. montevidensis and Heliotropium amplexicaule. In
   each species, older, colour-changed flowers emitted reduced amounts of
   linalool and its oxides, along with common aromatic esters and alcohols,
   whereas abundant sesquiterpene volatiles emitted by floral calyces and
   the plants' leaves and stems did not change. Although these compounds
   were not the most abundant floral volatiles, they are known to show
   behavioral and electrophysiological-olfactory activity for several
   species of butterflies. We conclude with a discussion of the conceptual
   and methodological reasons why dynamic patterns of floral scent emission
   often are overlooked, and identify opportunities for further progress in
   these areas.}},

Title = {{Plant-pollinator interactions and phenological change: what can we learn
   about climate impacts from experiments and observations?}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{4-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Climate change can affect plant-pollinator interactions in a variety of
   ways, but much of the research attention has focused on whether
   independent shifts in phenology will alter temporal overlap between
   plants and pollinators. Here I review the research on plant-pollinator
   mismatch, assessing the potential for observational and experimental
   approaches to address particular aspects of the problem. Recent,
   primarily observational studies suggest that phenologies of co-occurring
   plants and pollinators tend to respond similarly to environmental cues,
   but that nevertheless, certain pairs of interacting species are showing
   independent shifts in phenology. Only in a few cases, however, have
   these independent shifts been shown to affect population vital rates
   (specifically, seed production by plants) but this largely reflects a
   lack of research. Compared to the few long-term studies of pollination
   in natural plant populations, experimental manipulations of phenology
   have yielded relatively optimistic conclusions about effects of
   phenological shifts on plant reproduction, and I discuss how issues of
   scale and frequency-dependence in pollinator behaviour affect the
   interpretation of these temporal transplant' experiments. Comparable
   research on the impacts of mismatch on pollinator populations is so far
   lacking, but both observational studies and focused experiments have the
   potential to improve our forecasts of pollinator responses to changing
   phenologies. Finally, while there is now evidence that plant-pollinator
   mismatch can affect seed production by plants, it is still unclear
   whether this phenological impact will be the primary way in which
   climate change affects plant-pollinator interactions. It would be useful
   to test the direct effects of changing climate on pollinator population
   persistence, and to compare the importance of phenological mismatch with
   other threats to pollination.}},
