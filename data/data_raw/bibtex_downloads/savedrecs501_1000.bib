Abstract = {{Background and Aims If two plant species share pollinators, it has been
   proposed that the interaction between them may range from competitive to
   facilitative, depending on the way in which they intermingle. In
   particular, the presence of a rewarding plant species may increase the
   rate of pollinator visitation to a less rewarding species in its
   vicinity, but the beneficial increase in visitation may be counteracted
   by a detrimental increase in heterospecific pollen transfer. We assessed
   this trade-off using bumble-bees foraging over a gradual spatial
   transition between two plant species in an indoor cage experiment.
   Methods We used two species' of artificial flowers - one more rewarding
   than the other - in arrays that varied in the degree of species
   intermingling. The flowers dispensed and received powdered food dyes
   serving as pollen analogues. Captive bumble-bees visited to collect
   sucrose solution. We quantified dye delivery to the adhesive-tape
   stigmas' in flowers by spectrophotometry.
   Key Results Across the spatial transition between species, the less
   attractive species received more dye (more bee visits) when in proximity
   to the more attractive species than it did when alone, but the larger
   dye loads were less pure (more heterospecific pollen transfer). The
   decline in purity cancelled out the gain in acquisition, so conspecific
   pollen receipt by the less attractive species was neutrally affected.
   The more attractive species received fewer visits when surrounded by the
   less attractive species, so the interaction between the two species was
   amensalism when considering conspecific pollen reception.
   Conclusions Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant species
   depend on pollination quantity and purity, both of which can depend on
   spatial intermingling.}},

Month = {{JAN 23}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Most theory addressing the evolution of pollen
   limitation in flowering plants focuses on stochasticity in the relative
   abundance of plant and pollinator populations affecting trade-offs in
   resource allocation to ovule production or pollinator attraction vs.
   seed maturation. Mating system evolution is an underappreciated but
   potentially widespread additional mechanism for the evolutionary
   emergence of pollen limitation in animal-pollinated self-compatible
   plants.
   Methods We model individual plant flowering phenologies influencing both
   pollinator attraction and geitonogamous self-fertilization caused by
   pollinator movements among flowers within plants, incorporating
   demographic but not environmental stochasticity. Plant phenology and the
   resulting pollen limitation are analysed at evolutionarily stable
   equilibria (ESS). Pollen limitation is measured by two quantities: the
   proportion of unpollinated flowers and the reduction in maternal fitness
   caused by inbreeding depression in selfed seeds.
   Key Results When pollinators visit multiple flowers per plant, pollen
   limitation is never minimized at an ESS and results from the evolution
   of flowering phenologies balancing the amount and genetic composition
   (outbred vs. inbred) of pollen receipt.
   Conclusions Results are consistent with previous theory demonstrating
   that pollen limitation can be an evolved property, not just a
   constraint; they complement existing models by showing that plant
   avoidance of inbreeding depression constitutes a genetic mechanism
   contributing to evolution of pollen limitation, in addition to
   ecological mechanisms previously studied.}},

Abstract = {{Backgrounds and Aims Gain or loss of floral nectar, an innovation in
   floral traits, has occurred in diverse lineages of flowering plants, but
   the causes of reverse transitions (gain of nectar) remain unclear.
   Phylogenetic studies show multiple gains and losses of floral nectar in
   the species-rich genus Pedicularis. Here we explore how experimental
   addition of nectar to a supposedly nectarless species, P. dichotoma,
   influences pollinator foraging behaviour.
   Methods The liquid (nectar) at the base of the corolla tube in P.
   dichotoma was investigated during anthesis. Sugar components were
   measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. To understand
   evolutionary transitions of nectar, artificial nectar was added to
   corolla tubes and the reactions of bumble-bee pollinators to extra
   nectar were examined.
   Key Results A quarter of unmanipulated P. dichotoma plants contained
   measurable nectar, with 0.01-0.49 L per flower and sugar concentrations
   ranging from 4 to 39 \%. The liquid surrounding the ovaries in the
   corolla tubes was sucrose-dominant nectar, as in two sympatric
   nectariferous Pedicularis species. Bumble-bees collected only pollen
   from control (unmanipulated) flowers of P. dichotoma, adopting a
   sternotribic pollination mode, but switched to foraging for nectar in
   manipulated (nectar-supplemented) flowers, adopting a nototribic
   pollination mode as in nectariferous species. This altered foraging
   behaviour did not place pollen on the ventral side of the bees, and
   sternotribic pollination also decreased.
   Conclusion Our study is the first to quantify variation in nectar
   production in a supposedly nectarless' Pedicularis species. Flower
   manipulations by adding nectar suggested that gain (or loss) of nectar
   would quickly result in an adaptive behavioural shift in the pollinator,
   producing a new location for pollen deposition and stigma contact
   without a shift to other pollinators. Frequent gains of nectar in
   Pedicularis species would be beneficial by enhancing pollinator
   attraction in unpredictable pollination environments.}},

Abstract = {{This research work crucially deals with a techno-economic feasibility
   study for off-grid solar photovoltaic fuel cell (PV/FC) hybrid systems.
   The hybrid renewable energy system is investigated for feeding electric
   to remote areas and isolated urban regions in Egypt. To achieve this
   goal, all the system equipment are modeled, simulated and the area under
   study data is gathered. The objective function is formulated depending
   on the total annual cost (TAC). The Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA),
   as an efficient recent metaheuristic optimization method, proposed to
   estimate the optimum number of both PV panels and the
   FC/electrolyzer/H-2 storage tanks set mandatory where the least total
   net present value (TNPV) is reached.
   The loss of power supply probability (LPSP) is considered to enhance the
   performance of the proposed design. The effect of the variation of FC,
   electrolyzer, H-2 storage tanks and the PV power system initial cost on
   the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is presented through a comprehensive
   sensitivity analysis.
   Through Matlab (TM) program, the numerical simulation results obtained
   by the FPA algorithm have been compared to the corresponding outcomes
   while using the artificial bee colony (ABC) and the Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) techniques. According to the simulation outcomes
   analysis, the FPA Algorithm has the less fulfillment time and good
   rendering between the other algorithms. In addition, the optimum system
   configuration is acquired using FPA with the optimal hybridization of 27
   solar PV, 28 FCs, 58 electrolyzers and 37 H-2 storage tanks for an LPSP
   and PEE of 1.52\% and 4.68\% respectively. The system TNPV is

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are an important group of pollinating insects that are of
   increasing conservation concern due to relatively recent and dramatic
   species-specific declines. Nesting ecology can vary significantly
   between species, and nest site selection may be affected by many
   factors, including heredity, individual experience, and habitat
   availability. Data on bumble bee nesting ecology are inherently
   difficult to collect in the wild as nests are often cryptic. Artificial
   domiciles (nest boxes) can be a useful tool for gathering information on
   species-specific nesting behavior to inform conservation management of
   native pollinator populations. The aim of this study was to examine the
   use of three different domicile designs for monitoring bumble bees:
   aboveground, underground, and false underground, while collecting
   information on occupying species identity and richness to compare with
   sampling with traditional netting survey methods. Across Ontario, the
   majority of sites had at least one domicile occupied, with the
   aboveground installation method proving most successful whereas no
   false-underground domiciles were occupied. Occupied domiciles appeared
   to preferentially sample certain species compared to netting surveys,
   and rarefied species richness of both methods was similar. Given that
   some bumble bees did occupy artificial domiciles, and species richness
   relative to sample size was high, with further refinement, this method
   may be useful for bumble bee research and monitoring: filling in nesting
   ecology knowledge gaps and potentially as a conservation management
   tool.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebee Bombus terrestris is a beneficial pollinator extensively
   used in tomato production. Our hypothesis was that bumblebee hives
   collected from a Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) infected
   tomato greenhouse, preserve an infectious primary inoculum. Placing a
   bumblebee hive collected from a ToBRFV contaminated greenhouse, in a
   glass-/net-house containing only uninfected healthy tomato plants,
   spread ToBRFV disease. Control uninfected tomato plants grown in a
   glass-/net-house devoid of any beehive remained uninfected.
   ToBRFV-contaminated hives carried infectious viral particles as
   demonstrated in a biological assay on laboratory test plants of virus
   extracted from hive components. Viral particles isolated from a
   contaminated hive had a typical tobamovirus morphology observed in
   transmission electron microscopy. Assembly of ToBRFV genome was achieved
   by next generation sequencing analysis of RNA adhering to the bumblebee
   body. Bumblebee dissection showed that ToBRFV was mostly present in the
   abdomen suggesting viral disease spread via buzz pollination. These
   results demonstrate that bumblebee hives collected from
   ToBRFV-contaminated greenhouses carry a primary inoculum that reflects
   the status of viruses in the growing area. This new mode of ToBRFV
   spread by pollinators opens an avenue for detection of viruses in a
   growing area through analysis of the pollinators, as well as emphasizes
   the need to reevaluate the appropriate disease management protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of species of bees are in global decline, yet research
   addressing the ecology and status of these wild pollinators lags far

   bee. This knowledge gap is especially glaring in natural areas, despite
   knowledge that protected habitats harbor and export diverse bee
   communities into nearby croplands where their pollination services have
   been valued at over \$3 billion per year. Surrounded by ranches and

Abstract = {{Climate-induced changes in spatial and temporal occurrence of species,
   as well as species traits such as body size, each have the potential to
   decouple symbiotic relationships. Past work has focused primarily on
   direct interactions, particularly those between predators and prey and
   between plants and pollinators, but studies have rarely demonstrated
   significant fitness costs to the interacting, coevolving organisms.
   Here, we demonstrate that changing phenological synchrony in the latter
   part of the 20th century has different fitness outcomes for the actors
   within a Batesian mimicry complex, where predators learn to
   differentiate harmful ``model{''} organisms (stinging Hymenoptera) from

   mimetic relationships between 2,352 pairs of stinging Hymenoptera and
   their Syrphidae mimics based on a large-scale citizen science project
   and demonstrate that there is no relationship between the phenological
   shifts of models and their mimics. Using computer game-based
   experiments, we confirm that the fitness of models, mimics, and
   predators differs among phenological scenarios, creating a
   phenologically antagonistic system. Finally, we show that climate change
   is increasing the proportion of mimetic interactions in which models
   occur first and reducing mimic-first and random patterns of occurrence,
   potentially leading to complex fitness costs and benefits across all
   three actors. Our results provide strong evidence for an overlooked

Abstract = {{Post-wildfire salvage logging is an increasingly used land management
   tool with poorly understood ecological consequences for understory
   flowering plants and their interactions with pollinators. Understanding
   these consequences of salvage logging is important because an essential
   aspect of post-wildfire forest succession involves pollination and plant
   reproduction. For snowberry (Symphoricarpos albus), an
   ecologically-important and fire-tolerant shrub, we tested the long-term
   effects of post-wildfire logging on plant reproduction and pollen
   limitation using a supplemental-pollen experiment coupled with
   pollinator observations of S. albus and of potential co-flowering
   competitors of S. albus. Nearly a quarter century after these
   disturbances, we found no effects of post-wildfire logging on the
   reproduction of naturally-pollinated plants. The reproduction of some S.
   albus individuals were pollen limited, but only in unlogged areas,
   suggesting that plants in unlogged areas have higher potential
   reproduction compared to those logged areas but are unable to achieve
   this higher level of reproduction due to lack of pollination. This
   pollen limitation of S. albus reproduction is consistent with the
   relatively high floral densities of potential competitors of S. albus
   and generally low pollinator visitation rates in unlogged areas.
   Together, these results suggest that legacies of post-wildfire logging
   may restrict the reproductive potential of this shrub for at least
   several decades after the logging is complete, but this restriction is
   likely due to altered abiotic conditions and not via lack of
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of polymorphism by overdominance (heterozygote advantage) is
   a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology. In most examples known in
   nature, overdominance is a result of homozygotes suffering from
   deleterious effects. Here we show that overdominance maintains a
   non-deleterious polymorphism with black, red and white floral morphs in
   the Alpine orchid Gymnadenia rhellicani. Phenotypic, metabolomic and
   transcriptomic analyses reveal that the morphs differ solely in cyanidin
   pigments, which are linked to differential expression of an
   anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) gene. This expression difference is caused
   by a premature stop codon in an ANS-regulating R2R3-MYB transcription
   factor, which is heterozygous in the red colour morph. Furthermore,
   field observations show that bee and fly pollinators have opposite
   colour preferences; this results in higher fitness (seed set) of the
   heterozygous morph without deleterious effects in either homozygous
   morph. Together, these findings demonstrate that genuine overdominance

   are scarce and often geographically and taxonomically biased. These
   biases limit robust inference about any potential pollinator crisis.
   Non-structured and opportunistic historical specimen collection data
   provide the only source of historical information which can serve as a
   baseline for identifying pollinator declines. Specimens historically
   collected and preserved in museums not only provide information on where
   and when species were collected, but also contain other ecological
   information such as species interactions and morphological traits. Here,
   we provide a synthesis of how researchers have used historical data to
   identify long-term changes in biodiversity, species abundances,
   morphology and pollination services. Despite recent advances, we show
   that information on the status and trends of most pollinators is absent.
   We highlight opportunities and limitations to progress the assessment of
   pollinator declines globally. Finally, we demonstrate different
   approaches to analysing museum collection data using two contrasting
   case studies from distinct geographical regions (New Zealand and Spain)
   for which long-term pollinator declines have never been assessed. There
   is immense potential for museum specimens to play a central role in
   assessing the extent of the global pollination crisis.
   This article is part of the theme issue `Biological collections for
   understanding biodiversity in the Anthropocene'.}},

Abstract = {{Neocorynura Schrottky is one of the most speciose genera in the
   Augochlorini with about 80 species. Neocorynura is primarily distributed
   in the Neotropical region, from Argentina to Mexico. New species have
   been described recently, but the Brazilian fauna has not been studied at
   the same rate. Thus, the objective of this study is to provide a
   revision of Neocorynura species from Brazil. More than 2,500 specimens
   were studied along with the examination of primary type specimens and/or
   high resolution photographs of type material. A total of 44 species were
   recognized, 24 new species are added to the fauna and figured as N acuta

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background: The absence of pollinators may prevent sexual reproduction
   and affect the distribution and persistence of individual plant
   populations, but the role of pollinators in shaping the patterns of
   distributions of plant species or populations has not been well studied.
   Aims: Here, we tested the hypothesis that failure of sexual reproduction
   due to the absence of pollinators may contribute to the disjunct
   distribution of Iris ensata. Methods: We assessed floral traits and
   pollinator visitation frequencies in three native and two ex situ
   populations. We also conducted controlled pollination experiments and
   examined progeny performance to estimate pollen limitation (PL) and
   inbreeding depression. Results: Hand-pollinations indicated that I.
   ensata was a partially self-compatible outcrosser. Sexual reproduction
   in our study region depended on Bombus trifasciatus. We observed
   inbreeding depression for seed set and germination, but not for seedling
   survival. Native populations had higher frequencies of pollinator
   visitation and lower pollen-limitation of seed set than ex situ
   populations. Among populations, the magnitude of PL was negatively
   related to pollinator visitation rate (P = 0.04). Conclusions:
   Pollinator limitation and inbreeding depression may both restrict the
   southern distribution of I. ensata, preventing its northward expansion,
   thus explaining the disjunct distribution of I. ensata in East Asia.}},

Volume = {{166}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators display a remarkable diversity of foraging strategies with
   flowering plants, from primarily mutualistic interactions to cheating
   through nectar robbery. Despite numerous studies on the effect of nectar
   robbing on components of plant fitness, its contribution to reproductive
   isolation is unclear. We experimentally tested the impact of different
   pollinator strategies in a natural hybrid zone between two subspecies of
   Antirrhinum majus with alternate flower colour guides. On either side of
   a steep cline in flower colour between Antirrhinum majus pseudomajus
   (magenta) and A. m. striatum (yellow), we quantified the behaviour of
   all floral visitors at different time points during the flowering
   season. Using long-run camera surveys, we quantify the impact of nectar
   robbing on the number of flowers visited per inflorescence and the
   flower probing time. We further experimentally tested the effect of
   nectar robbing on female reproductive success by manipulating the
   intensity of robbing. While robbing increased over time the number of
   legitimate visitors tended to decrease concomitantly. We found that the
   number of flowers pollinated on a focal inflorescence decreased with the
   number of prior robbing events. However, in the manipulative experiment,
   fruit set and fruit volume did not vary significantly between low
   robbing and control treatments. Our findings challenge the idea that
   robbers have a negative impact on plant fitness through female function.
   This study also adds to our understanding of the components of
   pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation and the maintenance of
   Antirrhinum hybrid zones.}},

Abstract = {{`Chenguang' is the first released tetraploid cultivar (2n = 4x = 48) of

   purpose of this study was to create triploid germplasms by using
   `Chenguang' as a parent. The controlled crosses between autotetraploid
   `Chenguang' and diploid `Dongzao' were carried out from 2013 to 2015 by
   maintaining the 2 parents in a nylon net and employing bees as
   pollinator. A total of 606 fruits were produced, yet only 17 seeds were
   obtained from `Dongzao' and none from `Chenguang'. Direct sowing of the
   seeds in greenhouse showed a higher seedling rate than embryo culture.
   Four progeny plants were eventually obtained in the greenhouse and all
   of them were confirmed as authentic hybrids by SSR marker technique. At
   last, 3 triploids and 1 diploid were identified by flow cytometric
   analysis. Consequently, tetraploid `Chenguang' with high pollen vitality

   queenless bumblebee microcolonies that had been previously developed and
   used to assess for both toxicity and effects on foraging behaviour in B.
   terrestris for neonicotinoid insecticides (imidacloprid and
   thiamethoxam), was specifically employed. Here, microcolonies of B.
   terrestris workers, with or without the need to forage for food, were
   exposed to sugar water supplemented with field-realistic concentrations
   of sulfoxaflor (starting from 15 mu g/ml to 5 and 1 mu g/ml) via oral
   exposure during 15 days. In addition to a significant reduction in
   bumblebee worker survival, the results also indicated that there was no
   higher toxicity caused by sulfoxaflor when the bumblebees had to forage
   for their food compared to when they did not have to forage. These
   results could guide future studies in this context and could be used in
   debates on insecticides and/or risk assessment of pesticides with
   potential effects on behaviour in bumblebees and other pollinators in
   general.}},

Journal = {{IHERINGIA SERIE ZOOLOGIA}},

Volume = {{109}},
Abstract = {{The tomato is widely cultivated throughout the world and requires
   pollination by wild or managed bees to realize its full-potential fruit
   production. Two different sampling methods (pan trapping and active
   sampling) were employed in nine different properties from June to
   September of 2011 to investigate the richness and abundance of native
   bee species present in tomato crops of Center-West Brazil. A total of
   465 individuals of 44 species were collected, with the composition of
   sampled bee species differing between the methods used. Twenty-two
   species were exclusively captured in pan traps, 13 others through active
   sampling and nine by both methods. Most of the sampled bee species can
   be considered effective pollinators of the tomato because they can
   perform buzz-pollination. By vibration, these bees can liberate pollen
   from anthers into the air or onto their own bodies and the stigmas of
   the same flower because the stigmas of the studied tomato variety are
   within the anther cone. Both methods exclusively sampled some species of
   buzz-pollinating bees, however, pan-trapping captured buzzing and
   non-buzzing visitors indiscriminately while active sampling captured
   more buzzing bees. Pan-trapping and active sampling appear to complement
   each other, and so the use of only one or the other would not provide a
   full understanding of the species richness of tomato pollinators in the
   field.}},

   evaluated with respect to original ABC, FPA, hybrid ABC\_FP, ABC\_DE and

   Our results showed that worker body size and males of M. fasciculata did
   not change between urban and preserved sites. However, gyne body size
   and worker corbiculae area were larger in individuals collected from BRG
   compared to those from BEL. We conclude that the differential
   nutritional statuses of colonies in urban and preserved regions, as a
   result of inter-regional discrepancies in floral resource availability,
   influenced adult body size and morphological traits of M. fasciculata,
   although this effect was not consistent between bee castes.}},

Abstract = {{A potential cause of bumblebee losses on farmland is probably the toxic
   effects of insecticides used against crop pests. The olive fruit fly,
   Bactrocera oleae, is a major pest of olive trees in Mediterranean
   countries, so spray treatments (cover and bait sprays) are applied for
   this and other minor pests starting in early spring. The objective of
   this study was to determine the effect of three pesticide spraying
   solutions (alpha-cypennethrin, dimethoate, and spinosad) and control
   methods used against olive fruit flies and other olive tree pests, on
   adult buff-tailed bumblebees, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae).
   The results indicated that exposing worker bumblebees to enviromnentally
   realistic levels of these active ingredients in the laboratory resulted
   in high mortality rates of 34\% (alpha-cypermethrin, cover spray) and
   54\% (alpha-cypermethrin, bait spray) at the end of the three-day
   exposure period. Bumblebees are probably at a high risk of mortality
   when they forage in olive groves with dry residues of a bait solution of
   a-cypennethrin (which resulted in 54\% mortality in this study).
   Spinosad and dimethoate posed a lower risk of mortality for bumblebees.
   However, when the tested chemicals were applied to the whole tree canopy
   and without the bait attractant, the recorded mortality for dimethoate
   and a-cypennethrin was 8\% and 34\%, respectively. This study
   contributes to optimizing the use of the tested active ingredients as
   well as the applied control methods against managed pests, because it
   inflicts definite damage to populations of bumble bees and other
   non-target pollination.}},

   the eclipse had little impact on bee activity. Most of the explained
   variation (R-2) in buzzing rate was attributable to changes in light
   intensity. Bees ceased flying during complete darkness at totality, but
   flight activity was unaffected by dim light in partial phases before and
   after totality. Flights of bees during partial phases of the eclipse
   lasted longer than flights made under full sun, showing that behavioral

Abstract = {{The effects of plant species richness on the function and stability of
   ecosystems have been an area of focus in recent decades. Arthropod
   community is one of the most important components in agroecosystems and
   can provide multiple ecosystem services, including biocontrol and
   pollination. In particular, species composition and biocontrol function
   can be sensitive to changes in plant species richness. Here, we designed
   50 plots with five levels of plant species richness to examine arthropod
   distribution and composition over 4 yr. Arthropod richness was found to
   be positively correlated with plant species richness. High plant species
   richness can enhance the temporal stability of the arthropod community
   but can also lead to a decline in the population stability of some
   species. The species richness and biomass of environmentally friendly
   insects (EFI), such as honeybees, ants and flies, were found to be
   positively correlated with those of the natural enemies. As such, high
   levels of EFI could sustain food web robustness by serving as
   alternative prey/hosts for natural enemies. The mediation of EFI in the
   interaction between crops and pests has implications for successful

Abstract = {{The Philippines is a biodiversity hotspot and is home to thousands of
   endemic species, including at least two understudied bumble bee species:
   Bombus flavescens Smith, 1952 and Bombus irisanensis Cockerell, 1910.
   Since the 1990s, there have been virtually no studies published on the
   biology, ecology, and taxonomy of Philippine bumble beesevidence of the
   dearth of basic entomological investigations on these important insects.
   In this preliminary study, our objective is to briefly summarize the
   geographic distribution of bumble bee habitat suitability (HS) in the
   Philippines across protected and unprotected areas. Maximum entropy
   species distribution models (SDMs) of B. flavescens and B. irisanensis
   were constructed using 19 unique occurrence records and 11 bioclimatic
   variables to estimate HS in the Philippines. Our SDMs estimated that
   minimum HS for B. flavescens and B. irisanensis covers 28,066 and 24,603
   km(2) of the 114 protected land parcels in the Philippines,
   respectively. Across unprotected areas, our SDMs estimated that minimum
   HS for B. flavescens and B. irisanensis covers 146,063 and 156,674
   km(2), respectively. As predicted, high-elevation habitats have the
   highest HS relative to low-elevation habitats (r = 0.61, P = 0.003).
   While our SDMs predicts an extensive distribution of both species across
   both protected and unprotected areas, it is important to note that
   nearly 80\% of the Philippines is deforested. Our study identifies
   high-elevation protected areas as places where bumble bees may still
   thrive, and survey effort should be prioritized to these places to
   determine the status of Philippine bumble bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination and reproductive ecology of arid zone species in Australia
   are neglected topics. This is particularly true of rare species, some of
   which are threatened by mining operations. The bee community at
   Windarling Range in southern Western Australia and the pollination
   ecology of four rare Tetratheca taxa with distributions restricted to
   Banded Iron Formation inselbergs in the arid south-west were examined in
   winter and spring to understand if pollination rate was affecting the
   reproductive ecology of the plants. The bee fauna on the Windarling
   Range was sampled using coloured pan traps at three landscape positions
   of ridge (where Tetratheca paynterae subsp. paynterae occurs), slope and
   flats and the insect visitors to T. paynterae subsp. paynterae were
   quantified by direct observation. The bee fauna varied over the two
   years with average richness higher in 2010 than 2011 and was higher on
   the ridge compared with the slope and flats below the inselberg. The
   Tetratheca species are buzz pollinated and T. paynterae subsp. paynterae
   is only visited by a subsection of the bee fauna, mainly Lasioglossum
   species, which were shown to be relatively faithful to the species in
   terms of the pollen they carried. Flowering mainly occurs after the
   winter wet season, but may occur at other times when there has been
   substantial rain. This may not coincide with bee activity. In the winter
   flowers may be poorly serviced if maximum daytime temperatures are below
   20 degrees C. However, in spring when temperatures are higher the
   majority of flowers were pollinated and there was no significant
   difference in proportion of pollinated flowers between the four taxa
   examined. As T. paynterae is outcrossing the propensity for bees to
   attend few flowers on a visit to each plant, often on the outer part of
   the plant canopy, will likely ensure a high success rate for seed
   formation. High seed set in such an arid environment with few suitable
   sites for seedling establishment is essential so some propagules can
   find safe sites for establishment to maintain population numbers.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is a key threat to pollination networks and has already
   caused shifts in the distribution and phenology of many bee species.
   Predictions based on species distribution models forecast that most bee
   species will continue to decline as climate change progresses, the few
   exceptions to this being common, widespread species with large dispersal
   capabilities. Most of the bees studied so far are temperate or tropical
   species but many ecosystems are predicted to experience increased
   aridification under climate change. Therefore, we need to understand how
   pollinator species are likely to respond. Here we present species
   distribution models for the arid-adapted Australian small carpenter bee,
   Ceratina australensis Perkins, 1912 (Apidae: Xylocopinae) under
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change
   conditions predicted for 2070 (Representative Carbon Pathway 8.5). We
   applied Maximum Entropy, Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive
   Models and Random Forest methods. Overall, our models predict that this
   bee will have an increased area of suitable habitat as climate change
   progresses, including an increased range within protected areas.
   However, its potential range will shift further into coastal areas, that
   are highly human populated and urbanised. Our results suggest that wild
   bee taxa may be able to cope with the predicted scale of future
   aridification under climate change. Finally, this species is predicted
   to increase in urban environments, which highlights the need for city
   planning, suitable habitats and green spaces to support wild bee
   species. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the Midwestern US, many public lands set aside for
   conservation engage in management activities (e.g., agriculture) that
   may act as stressors on wild bee populations. Several studies have
   investigated how wild bees respond to large-scale agriculture
   production; however, there has been limited assessment of how wild bees
   may be impacted by agricultural activity on public lands or how local
   variables may influence bee communities in these same areas. In this
   study, we assessed the abundance and richness of wild bee floral and
   nesting guilds at 30 agricultural field margins located on five
   Conservation Areas in Missouri. Generally, regardless of guild, bee
   abundance and richness was greater in field margins with more floral
   diversity and taller vegetation. Bee guilds responded negatively to
   agricultural production in Conservation Areas with fewer soil- and
   cavity-nesting bees collected in margins adjacent to annually cropped
   fields. Although fewer diet specialists were collected, specialist bee
   abundance and richness was greater in margins near fields that were
   uncropped (i.e., vegetated, but not row-cropped) during the previous
   year. Overall, the percentage of trees and shrubs within 800 m of study
   fields (i.e., ``woodland{''}) was negatively associated with abundance
   and richness of bees, but specifically, reduced richness of soil-nesters
   and diet specialists. Our findings indicate agricultural management
   activities on public lands may lead to decreased abundance and richness
   of wild bee guilds. If public lands are to be managed for species
   diversity, including wild bees, maintaining diverse plant communities
   with taller vegetation (>100 cm) near cultivated fields and/or modifying
   agricultural production practices on public lands may greatly improve
   the conservation of local bee communities. (C) 2019 The Authors.

   develop strategies that improve the quality of urban areas. Knowing that
   pollinator conservation is a critical issue, we launched Native Bee
   Watch, a citizen science project to monitor bees in Fort Collins, a
   fast-growing urban center in northern Colorado, USA. Relying on citizen
   scientists presents challenges in data accuracy leading to the current
   study with objectives aimed to develop a protocol for accurate bee
   identification and determine whether citizen scientists following the
   protocol collect accurate data on bee diversity. The different genera of
   bees were grouped into eight morphospecies categories. Citizen
   scientists received intensive training prior to the start of the
   biweekly monitoring and researchers monitored during the off-weeks. We
   had very high volunteer retention rates and our results indicate strong
   correlation between citizen scientist and researcher data suggesting
   with intensive training and engagement, accurate data collection by
   citizen scientists and volunteer retention is possible. We suggest that
   citizen science can be a plausible option for bee monitoring at the
   level of morphospecies, but success will depend on the extent of
   volunteer engagement and training. Detailed taxonomic analyses may be
   necessary to formulate long term conservation planning for a location.

Abstract = {{A study on the reproductive biology of the federally endangered Physaria
   globosa was conducted near Hartsville, TN, at one of the largest known
   populations of the species from February through July 2016. Objectives
   included (a) establishment of baseline reproductive phonology for P
   globosa, (b) documentation of the diversity and frequency of floral
   visitors, and (c) determination of effective insect pollen vectors.
   Flowers were open for three days and displayed characteristics typical
   of outcrossing. Six insect species were identified as effective vectors
   for P globosa pollen, including two dipterans and four halictid bees.
   While pollen loads were not significantly different among the vectors,
   floral visitors were ranked by frequency in descending order as follows:
   Nemotelus bruesii, Toxomerus geminatus, Lasioglossum illinoense, Hallows
   ligates, Lasioglossum versatus, and Augochlorella striata. Information
   on natural history of this species is vital to aiding conservation

Abstract = {{Monoecious species are common within Sapindaceae, and among them a large
   variation in sexual expression has been reported. In this work we
   evaluate the sexual expression, phenology, floral biology, and mating
   system in eight to sixteen individuals of the duodichogamous
   Koelreuteria elegans (Seem.) A.C. Sm. subsp. formosana (Hayata) F.G.
   Mey. Results from our study show that all individuals exhibited a
   pattern of flowering characterised by two cycles of pistillate flowers
   with an intervening one of staminate flowers. The synflorescences
   presented a high synchronisation between the male and female phases at
   the individual level. Therefore, very little functional overlap was
   observed between pollen receipt and pollen dispatch within individuals.
   Pollination was by bees, and the manual pollination experiments showed
   that this species is a xenogamous although self-compatible species.
   Nevertheless, seed set increased significantly with hand
   cross-pollination and open pollination experiments. Decrease of fruits
   and seeds set by geitonogamy could favour the establishment of
   duodichogamy with interfloral protogyny promoting cross-pollination. In
   the family this is the first report of a pattern of flowering in which
   there are two cycles of female with an intervening cycle of male
   flowers. The importance of detailed these studies for understanding
   mechanisms underlying duodichogamy was demonstrated, and findings will
   help to broaden our understanding about this rare sexual system to
   generalise the specific ecological factors that explain its evolutionary
   meaning.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Bird pollination is rare among species in the genus
   Utricularia, and has evolved independently in two lineages of this
   genus. In Western Australia, the Western Spinebill, Acanthorhynchus
   superciliosus, visits flowers of Utricularia menziesii (section
   Pleiochasia: subgenus Polypompholyx). This study aimed to examine the
   micromorphology of U. menziesii flowers to assess traits that might be
   linked to its pollination strategy.
   Methods Light microscopy, histochemistry and scanning electron
   microscopy were used. Nectar sugar composition was analysed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Key Results The flowers of U. menziesii fulfil many criteria that
   characterize bird-pollinated flowers: red colour, a large, tough nectary
   spur that can withstand contact with a hard beak, lack of visual nectar
   guides and fragrance. Trichomes at the palate and throat may act as
   tactile signals. Spur nectary trichomes did not form clearly visible
   patches, but were more frequently distributed along vascular bundles,
   and were small and sessile. Each trichome comprised a single basal cell,
   a unicellular short pedestal cell (barrier cell) and a multicelled head.
   These trichomes were much smaller than those of the U. vulgaris allies.
   Hexose-dominated nectar was detected in flower spurs. Fructose and
   glucose were present in equal quantities (43 3.6 and 42 +/- 3.6 g L-1).
   Sucrose was only detected in one sample, essentially at the limit of
   detection for the method used. This type of nectar is common in flowers
   pollinated by passerine perching birds.
   Conclusions The architecture of nectary trichomes in U. menziesii was
   similar to that of capitate trichomes of insect-pollinated species in
   this genus; thus, the most important specializations to bird pollination
   were flower colour (red), and both spur shape and size modification.
   Bird pollination is probably a recent innovation in the genus
   Utricularia, subgenus Polypompholyx, and is likely to have evolved from
   bee-pollinated ancestors.}},

Abstract = {{The Augochlora clade includes four genera: Augochlora Smith,
   Augochlorella Sandhouse, Ceratalictus Moure, and Pereirapis Moure. This
   is one of the richest and most widespread groups of Augochlorini bees.
   There are about 150 species, which occur from Argentina to Canada. The
   species of Augochlora clade are considered solitary to facultatively
   social, except Ceratalictus for which nothing is known. Wood nesting
   behavior arose once in the clade, in Augochlora sensu strictu. The
   objective of this study is to describe four new species and to present a
   revised phylogenetic analysis of the Augochlora clade for the placement
   of these species. The morphological matrix comprised 77 characters and
   42 terminals, and resulted in two most parsimonious trees. The monophyly
   of the Augochlora clade is corroborated. Ceratalictus and Pereirapis are
   considered as sister groups and Ceratalictus inflexus sp. nov. came as
   sister to other species of Ceratalictus. Augochlora and Augochlorella
   are monophyletic and sister groups. Both extant subgenera of Augochlora
   were corroborated as monophyletic. Augochlorella comis is considered as
   sister group to the rest of Augochlorella species. All Augochlorella new
   species described belong to the Augochlorella ephyra group.
   Augochlorella kelliae sp. nov. is phylogenetically related to
   Augochlorella una. Augochlorella procliva sp. nov. and Augochlorella
   mavricera sp. nov. constitute a clade with Augochlorella acarinata.
   Including the new species, Augochlorella has 19 species and Ceratalictus
   11 species. A revised key for species of Augochlorella and Ceratalictus
   is also presented in the Supplementary Information. (C) 2019 Sociedade

Title = {{A New Hybrid Algorithm Based on Grey Wolf Optimization and Crow Search
   Algorithm for Unconstrained Function Optimization and Feature Selection}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{26343-26361}},
Abstract = {{Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a very efficient metaheuristic inspired by
   the hierarchy of the Canis lupus wolves. It has been extensively
   employed to a variety of practical applications. Crow search algorithm
   (CSA) is a recently proposed metaheuristic algorithm, which mimics the
   intellectual conduct of crows. In this paper, a hybrid GWO with CSA,
   namely GWOCSA is proposed, which combines the strengths of both the
   algorithms effectively with the aim to generate promising candidate
   solutions in order to achieve global optima efficiently. In order to
   validate the competence of the proposed hybrid GWOCSA, a widely utilized
   set of 23 benchmark test functions having a wide range of dimensions and
   varied complexities is used in this paper. The results obtained by the
   proposed algorithm are compared to 10 other algorithms in this paper for
   verification. The statistical results demonstrate that the GWOCSA
   outperforms other algorithms, including the recent variants of GWO
   called, enhanced grey wolf optimizer (EGWO) and augmented grey wolf
   optimizer (AGWO) in terms of high local optima avoidance ability and
   fast convergence speed. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the
   applicability of the proposed algorithm at solving complex real-world
   problems, the GWOCSA is also employed to solve the feature selection
   problem as well. The GWOCSA as a feature selection approach is tested on
   21 widely employed data sets acquired from the University of California
   at Irvine repository. The experimental results are compared to the
   stateof-the-art feature selection techniques, including the native GWO,
   the EGWO, and the AGWO. The results reveal that the GWOCSA has
   comprehensive superiority in solving the feature selection problem,
   which proves the capability of the proposed algorithm in solving
   real-world complex problems.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{213-222}},

Abstract = {{Animals that rely on nectar are expected to display floral trait
   preferences correlating to the signals of nectar source flowers.
   Batesian mimicry evolves to exploit these pre-existing signal-receiver
   relationships, attracting pollinators through an adaptive resemblance to
   specific co-occurring rewarding species. The nectar-feeding
   long-proboscid flies of South Africa are pollinators for several
   deceptive orchid species that are putatively Batesian mimics. We tested
   whether flies' measured color preference varied among communities
   providing different nectar-source diets, which would indicate the
   necessary signal-receiver conditions for the evolution of advergent
   Batesian mimicry. We introduced artificial rewardless flowers into
   flowering communities that supported divergent nectar diets in resident
   flies and inferred floral trait preferences of a long-proboscid fly
   species (Prosoeca ganglbaueri) from visitation behavior to these
   artificial flowers. The experiment showed that the preference of flies
   for white versus pink was strongly predicted by the colors of flowers
   most commonly visited by flies at a site. Furthermore, generalization in
   preference was positively correlated with the variance in
   nectar-community hue, i.e., flies showed more generalized preference in
   more spectrally diverse flower communities. The floral tube length of
   local nectar sources also influenced how readily the flies probed the
   artificial flowers during attempted foraging. These results support the
   hypothesis that nectarless orchids pollinated by P. ganglbaueri
   experience selection for traits that exploit site-specific mutualistic
   relationships between fly pollinators and their local floral
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Floral nectar is offered by the plant to its pollinators to
   promote cross-fertilization.
   Questions: Are floral nectaries morpho-anatomically similar among the
   taxa of Strombocactus? What sugars do nectaries offer their pollinators?
   Studied species: Strombocactus disciformis subsp. disciformis, S.
   disciformis subsp. esperanzae and S. corregidorae, during 2016-2018.
   Methods: Bud flowers and flowers in anthesis from each taxon of
   Strombocactus, were processed to be observed in SEM; other specimens
   were embedded in Paraplast and sectioned to histochemical tests. The
   concentration of nectar was measured using a refractometer.
   Results: The nectaries are similar among the three studied taxa, located
   below the stamens and reach the upper part of the ovary forming a ring
   in the hypanthium. An almost flat epidermis constitutes the nectary in
   S. disciformis subsp. esperanzae, although in S. disciformis subsp.
   disciformis is slightly bulked and papillae in S. corregidorae, a
   nectariferous parenchyma composed of metabolically very active cells,
   and a subnectariferous parenchyma of larger cells, associated with
   vascular bundles. The nectar is secreted through nectarostomata. The
   concentration of nectar was 8.65 +/- 3.98, 16.12 +/- 4.48 and 22.09 +/-
   7.42 degrees Brix for S. disciformis subsp. esperanzae, S. corregidorae
   and S. disciformis subsp. disciformis, respectively.
   Conclusions: All taxa of Strombocactus have an annular-type nectary that
   secretes a low volume of nectar and together with pollen are offered as
   rewards. Based on other floral characteristics observed, such as the
   diurnal anthesis, the infundibuliform shape and the color of the flower,
   we propose that bees pollinate these species.}},

Abstract = {{Gentianella praecox subsp. bohemica is a critically endangered taxon

   services, as the probability of autonomous selling is low. Both
   hand-selling and out-crossing resulted in similar seed production.
   ``'Twee out of four of the populations studied appeared to be pollen
   limited. The most frequent visitors and effective pollinators were
   bumblebees. However, we found that the different species of bumblebee
   differed greatly in their efficiency as pollinators due to differences
   in their behaviour. In contrast to other bumblebees. Bombus wurflenii,
   which nearly always robbed nectar through a hole in the corolla tube and
   only accidentally touched the reproductive organs. was an inefficient
   pollinator. Other important pollinators of G. praecox subsp. bohemica
   were honeybees (in lowland areas) and hoverflies. This study indicates
   that management for conservation should focus not only on creating gaps

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchid flowers use visual, tactile and olfactory cues
   of female insects in order to attract males of one or a few closely
   related species as pollinators. Ophrys L. is the most species-rich genus
   of sexually deceptive orchids in the Mediterranean Basin. Despite Ophrys
   pollinated by Andrena male bees use alkanes and mainly alkenes with
   specific double-bond positions as key signals that trigger
   pseudocopulatory behavior, some volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with
   low molecular weight were found as long-range attractants non-eliciting
   copulatory behavior. Since floral scents in Ophrys have been extensively
   studied by solvent extractions here we aimed to understand which floral
   volatiles are found when two different collection methods are used in
   Ophrys panormitana flowers. By knowing their chemical composition, we
   could better understand the scent chemistry of this Ophrys species
   without overlooking VOCs which could also have a function in its
   pollination biology.Scent samples collected by dynamic headspace and by
   solvent extraction were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
   (GC/MS).The floral scent of O. panormitana is composed by a bouquet of
   VOCs with lower and higher molecular weights. The headspace samples
   contained VOCs with higher volatility (mainly one aliphatic alcohol and
   two aliphatic ketones) whereas the solvent extracts were composed by
   VOCs with lower volatility (exclusively long-chain alkanes and alkenes).
   Overlapping in VOCs between headspace and solvent samples were not
   found. For the first time Andrena nigroaenea was observed during the
   pseudocopulation and removing the pollinaria of a flower of O.
   panormitana.Abbreviations: VOCs, volatile organic compounds; GC/MS, gas

Abstract = {{Despite the recent rapid growth of tropical dry forest succession
   ecology, most studies on this topic have focused on plant community
   attribute recovery, whereas animal community successional dynamics has
   been largely overlooked, and the few existing studies have used
   taxonomic approaches. Here, we analyze the successional changes in the
   bee community in a Mexican tropical dry forest, by integrating taxonomic
   (species, genus, and family diversity) and functional (sociability,
   nesting strategy, and body size) information for bees. Over one year, in
   a successional chronosequence (2-67 years after abandonment) we
   collected 469 individual bees, representing five families, 36 genera,
   and 69 species. Linear modeling showed decreases in taxonomic diversity
   with succession, more strongly so for species. Bee species turnover
   along succession ranged from moderate to high, decreasing slightly at
   intermediate stages. An RLQ analysis (ordination method that allows
   relating environmental variables with functional attributes) revealed
   clear relations between bee functional traits and the plant community.
   RLQ axis 1 was positively related to vegetation structural and diversity
   variables, and to eusociality, while solitary, parasociality, and ground
   nesting was negatively associated with it. Early successional fallows
   attract mostly solitary and parasocial bees; older fallows tend to
   attract eusocial bees with aerial nesting. The continuous taxonomic
   turnover observed by us and the functional analysis suggest that the
   disappearance of old fallows from agricultural landscapes would likely
   result in significant reductions and even local extinctions of
   particular bee guilds. Considering the low viability of preserving large
   mature tropical dry forest tracts, the conservation of older
   successional stands emerges as a crucial component of landscape
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Many modern crop varieties rely on animal pollination to set fruit and
   seeds. Intensive crop plantations usually do not provide suitable
   habitats for pollinators so crop yield may depend on the surrounding
   vegetation to maintain pollination services. However, little is known
   about the effect of pollinator-mediated interactions among co-flowering
   plants on crop yield or the underlying mechanisms. Plant reproductive
   success is complex, involving several pre- and post-pollination events;
   however, the current literature has mainly focused on pre-pollination
   events in natural plant communities. We assessed pollinator sharing and
   the contribution to pollinator diet in a community of wild and
   cultivated plants that co-flower with a focal papaya plantation. In
   addition, we assessed heterospecific pollen transfer to the stigmatic
   loads of papaya and its effect on fruit and seed production. We found
   that papaya shared at least one pollinator species with the majority of
   the co-flowering plants. Despite this, heterospecific pollen transfer in
   cultivated papaya was low in open-pollinated flowers. Hand-pollination
   experiments suggest that heterospecific pollen transfer has no negative
   effect on fruit production or weight, but does reduce seed production.
   These results suggest that co-flowering plants offer valuable floral
   resources to pollinators that are shared with cultivated papaya with
   little or no cost in terms of heterospecific pollen transfer. Although
   HP reduced seed production, a reduced number of seeds per se are not
   negative, given that from an agronomic perspective the number of seeds
   does not affect the monetary value of the papaya fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect interactions play an essential role in governing population,
   community and coevolutionary dynamics across a diverse range of
   ecological communities. Such communities are widely represented as
   bipartite networks: graphs depicting interactions between two groups of
   species, such as plants and pollinators or hosts and parasites. For over
   thirty years, studies have used indices, such as connectance and species
   degree, to characterise the structure of these networks and the roles of
   their constituent species. However, compressing a complex network into a
   single metric necessarily discards large amounts of information about
   indirect interactions. Given the large literature demonstrating the
   importance and ubiquity of indirect effects, many studies of network
   structure are likely missing a substantial piece of the ecological
   puzzle. Here we use the emerging concept of bipartite motifs to outline
   a new framework for bipartite networks that incorporates indirect
   interactions. While this framework is a significant departure from the
   current way of thinking about bipartite ecological networks, we show
   that this shift is supported by analyses of simulated and empirical
   data. We use simulations to show how consideration of indirect
   interactions can highlight differences missed by the current index
   paradigm that may be ecologically important. We extend this finding to
   empirical plant-pollinator communities, showing how two bee species,
   with similar direct interactions, differ in how specialised their
   competitors are. These examples underscore the need to not rely solely
   on network- and species-level indices for characterising the structure
   of bipartite ecological networks.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) serve as important infochemicals,
   mediating several ecological interactions including herbivory and
   pollination. Atmospheric pollutants including traffic-related air
   pollution may impair the detection of VOCs used by insects in
   insect-plant interactions. We investigated the indirect effect of petrol
   exhaust pollution on olfactory learning and memory (short and long term)
   in honey bees. Using appetitive olfactory conditioning, we trained bees
   to learn one of four floral VOC profiles; linalool, dipentene, myrcene
   and geranium. VOCs were unpolluted or polluted with exhaust collected
   from a petrol generator. Exhaust emissions included concentrations of CO
   (246.07 + 17 ppm), NO (20.50 + 6.90 ppb) and NO2 (20.93 + 0.05 ppb)
   consistent with those typically encountered in urban areas and near
   roads. Once bees had learnt the training VOC, we tested whether they
   could recognise that VOC 1 h, 24 h and 48 h post-training. Bees took
   significantly longer to learn polluted VOCs and forgot them faster than
   unpolluted ones. We also tested the `masking' potential of pollution on
   floral VOCs. Using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy we noted
   differences in the chemical profile of polluted versus unpolluted VOCs
   and tested whether bees could recognise polluted VOCs if trained using
   unpolluted ones. For several VOCs tested, bees could distinguish between
   polluted and unpolluted VOCs. Ultimately, our results show that air
   pollution changes the recognition and retention of floral VOCs by bees
   which may consequently impact foraging efficiency.}},

Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies of annual eusocial insects in agricultural landscapes
   report contrasting findings with regard to colony responses to
   mass-flowering of crops such as oilseed rape. In particular, total
   sexual production is often unaffected by such events, whereas worker
   number responds with a prominent increase. To resolve these conflicting
   observations, we model-using an established approach-the expected change
   in worker and sexual numbers in response to an increased worker
   productivity induced by mass-flowering events at different times of the
   season. We find that the predicted response pattern is mainly shaped by
   the degree to which individual worker productivity is reduced by an
   increasing number of workers in the colony. Different environmental
   conditions and colony characteristics result in different levels of
   interference of workers, for example, during foraging or nest
   construction. Reduction in individual productivity is low, when worker
   interference is negligible ({''}weak limitation{''}) and high when an
   increasing number of workers substantially decreases per-capita
   efficiency ({''}strong limitation{''}). For weak limitation, any
   mass-flowering event that ends before the production of sexuals starts
   has a strong multiplicative impact on both worker and sexual numbers.
   The magnitude of the effect is quite independent of the precise timing
   of such an event. After the onset of sexual production, mass-flowering
   has a weaker effect, as the added resource supply is only linearly
   transferred into production of additional sexuals. For colonies under
   strong limitation, the predicted impact of mass-flowering events is
   generally weaker, especially on the production of sexuals, and the
   timing of mass-flowering events becomes more influential: Production of
   sexuals profits more from late than from early mass-flowering events.
   Consequently, early mass-flowering events are predicted to have a
   prominent effect on worker numbers but a negligible one on the output of
   sexuals. The model presented provides a mechanistic explanation of why
   increased worker abundances do not necessarily translate into increased
   production of sexuals. The model is also applicable to other eusocial
   insects such as paper wasps whenever brief pulses of massive resource
   availability shortly elevate resource intake rates above the
   ``normal{''} levels.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination of tomatoes in greenhouses using bees (especially Bombus
   species) has increased worldwide, providing increased productivity.
   However, no concrete initiative has been carried out with bees for
   tomato pollination on a commercial scale, in greenhouses in Brazil.
   Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate Melipona quadrifasciata
   efficiency in pollination and consequent production of tomatoes of
   different growth habits in greenhouse environment. Two experiments were
   conducted. The pollen load of the creeping tomato (determined growth)
   flowers and the fruit quality was quantified in the first experiment, in
   the greenhouse cultivation treatments with bees, without bees, and in
   the open environment. In the second experiment, the treatments were
   carried out with tomato of indeterminate growth in greenhouse with bees
   and without bees. The bees presented foraging behavior and visitation to
   tomato flowers. The pollen load for the determined tomato was 433\%
   larger in a closed environment with bees when compared with results
   obtained in the greenhouse without bees. Fruits produced in greenhouses
   with bees presented 15\% more fresh mass and 41.1\% more seeds, than the
   fruit produced in an open environment. Seed production for indetermined
   growth tomato was 33\% higher when the flower was pollinated and the
   tomato mass increased up to 16\%. The results show the importance of
   using M. quadrifasciata for pollination in a greenhouse environment.
   Native bees for pollination of agricultural crops in greenhouse showed
   promising results, especially for the tomato crop, which is benefited by
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the head morphology of island and mainland populations of

   morphometrics to test for differences in head morphology and analyzed
   122 colonies. Head measurements were performed using 25 landmarks and
   semi-landmarks. For head shape, landmarks were analyzed by generalized
   procrustes analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), Mahalanobis
   distance, discriminant function analysis, cross-validation and
   unweighted pair-group method clustering (UPGMA). For head size, data
   were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Tukey
   test. In addition, the relations between head shape, head size,
   geographical distance and altitude were analyzed using Pearson's
   correlation coefficients. Morphological analyses revealed significant
   differences (p<.01) between mainland and island populations. Moreover,
   island bees differed in head shape and head size. The first two
   principal components explained 69.72\% of the total variation, and UPGMA
   revealed that the individuals collected on the Island of Fernando de
   Noronha differed from the remaining locations, with 100\% bootstrap
   support. Cross-validation correctly classified 84\% of the individuals

Abstract = {{Premise of the Study Turnover in biotic communities across heterogeneous
   landscapes is expected to lead to variation in interactions among
   plants, their mutualists, and their antagonists. Across a fragmented
   landscape in northern Costa Rica, populations of the euphorb vine
   Dalechampia scandens vary widely in mating systems and associated
   blossom traits. Previous work suggested that populations are well
   adapted to the local reliability of pollination by apid and megachilid
   bees. We tested whether variation in the intensity of predispersal seed
   predation by seed weevils in the genus Nanobaris also contributes to the
   observed variation in blossom traits. Methods We studied spatiotemporal
   variation in the relationships between floral advertisement and the
   probability of seed predation within three focal populations. Then we
   assessed among-population covariation of predation rate, pollination
   reliability, mating system, and blossom traits across 20 populations.
   Key Results The probability of seed predation was largely unrelated to
   variation in floral advertisement both within focal populations and
   among the larger sample of populations. The rate of seed predation was
   only weakly associated with the rate of cross-pollination (allogamy) in
   each population but tended to be proportionally greater in populations
   experiencing less reliable pollination. Conclusions These results
   suggest that geographic variation in the intensity of antagonistic
   interactions have had only minor modifying effects on the evolutionary
   trajectories of floral advertisement in plant populations in this
   system. Thus, pollinator-driven floral trait evolution in D. scandens in
   the study area appears not to be influenced by conflicting
   seed-predator-mediated selection.}},

Abstract = {{Floral traits are hypothesized to evolve primarily in response to
   selection by pollinators. However, selection can also be mediated by
   other environmental factors. To understand the relative importance of
   pollinator-mediated selection and its variation among trait and
   pollinator types, we analyzed directional selection gradients on floral
   traits from experiments that manipulated the environment to identify
   agents of selection. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger than
   selection by other biotic factors (e.g., herbivores), but similar in
   strength to selection by abiotic factors (e.g., soil water), providing
   partial support for the hypothesis that floral traits evolve primarily
   in response to pollinators. Pollinator-mediated selection was stronger
   on pollination efficiency traits than on other trait types, as expected
   if efficiency traits affect fitness via interactions with pollinators,
   but other trait types also affect fitness via other environmental
   factors. In addition to varying among trait types, pollinator-mediated
   selection varied among pollinator taxa: selection was stronger when
   bees, long-tongued flies, or birds were the primary visitors than when
   the primary visitors were Lepidoptera or multiple animal taxa. Finally,
   reducing pollinator access to flowers had a relatively small effect on
   selection on floral traits, suggesting that anthropogenic declines in

   evolution.}},

   82.7\% of all specimens correctly. While R. ordonezi has a restricted
   range in central and southern Morocco (extending over approximately 500
   km), R. sticticum is widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin with
   a range extending over approximately 2500 km from east to west. The

Abstract = {{Oncidiinae is one of the largest and most diverse subtribes within
   Orchidaceae, and many species of this group are known for relying on
   deceptive pollination through Batesian floral mimicry. Ionopsis
   utricularioides is a widespread Oncidiinae orchid that occurs from
   tropical South America to Florida, USA. The pollinators of this species
   are still unknown, but a previous study in Puerto Rico showed that the
   species is rewardless and self-compatible. Here we investigate the
   pollination biology of I. utricularioides in Brazil. To determine if
   this species is a Batesian mimic we specifically take into account the
   flower colour of this species and the co-flowering plants in the
   community. The breeding system experiments revealed that Brazilian
   populations of I. utricularioides are completely self-incompatible and
   produces less fruits than those from Puerto Rico under natural
   conditions. The flowers of I. utricularioides are also nectarless in
   Brazil and are pollinated by several bee species. The pollinarium is
   attached on the dorsal portion of the proboscis, while the pollinators
   put their head inside the flowers searching for nectar. Given that the
   flower colour is common to several other co-flowering species of the
   community, our results suggest that this orchid does not represent a
   case of Batesian mimicry, since it does not mimic a specific model.}},

Abstract = {{The global trade of species promotes diverse human activities but also
   facilitates the introduction of potentially invasive species into new
   environments. As species ignore national boundaries, unilateral national
   decisions concerning species trade set the stage for transnational
   species invasion with significant conservation, economic and political
   consequences. The need for a coordinated approach to species importation
   policies is demonstrated by the introduction of two bumblebee species
   into Chile for crop pollination, despite Argentina banning commercial
   importation of alien bumblebees based on expert opinion. The large
   garden bumblebee, Bombus ruderatus, was first introduced in 1982, and
   the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, has been continually
   introduced since 1997 as part of the burgeoning bumblebee trade. Both
   species have subsequently invaded southern South America. Today, the
   consequences of the growth of the bumblebee trade for agricultural
   pollination ranks among the top 15 emerging environmental issues likely
   to affect global diversity. Documented impacts of these invasions
   include the severe decline and local extinctions of the sole native
   Patagonian bumblebee, Bombus dahlbomii, pathogen transmission, flower
   damage and nectar robbing of native and cultivated plants. Policy
   implications. The South American bumblebee invasions portrayed here
   should alert governments to the unintended consequences of the booming
   international bee trade. More broadly, this case demonstrates that one
   country's importation decisions can have policy implications for its
   neighbours without consultation. Regrettably, coordinated international
   measures to prevent species invasions are seldom considered in South
   America or elsewhere, despite existing legal frameworks. The bumblebee
   case and others provide stark evidence of the pressing need for
   coordinated specific and general international policies concerning
   global species trade and their implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Urban expansion is an increasing threat to biodiversity, especially in
   tropical Africa where biodiversity hot spots are being encroached upon
   by fast-growing cities. Threatened species include bees and other
   pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are
   sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of
   urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator
   abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126
   locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient
   in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot
   spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity
   lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces),
   and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did
   not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both
   wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact
   of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on
   farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management
   practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer
   bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and
   dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management,
   with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional
   traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees,
   cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands
   hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were
   influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and
   cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications.
   Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we
   demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have
   been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but
   not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and
   the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were
   managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest
   bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal
   green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting
   nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application
   would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they
   provide to both crops and native vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The current worldwide pollinator decline is caused by the interplay of
   different drivers. Several strategies have been undertaken to counteract
   or halt this decline, one of which is the implementation of wildflower
   fields. These supplementary flowers provide extra food resources and
   have proven their success in increasing pollinator biodiversity and
   abundance. Yet such landscape alterations could also alter the
   host-pathogen dynamics of pollinators, which could affect the
   populations. In this study, we investigated the influence of sown
   wildflower fields on the prevalence of micro-parasites and viruses in
   the wild bumble bee Bombus pascuorum, one of the most abundant bumble
   bee species in Europe and the Netherlands. We found that the effect of
   sown wildflower fields on micro-parasite prevalence is affected by the
   composition of the surrounding landscape and the size of the flower
   field. The prevalence of micro-parasites increases with increasing size
   of sown wildflower fields in landscapes with few semi-natural landscape
   elements. This effect was not observed in landscapes with a high amount
   of semi-natural landscape elements. We elaborate on two mechanisms which
   can support these findings: (1) transmission hot spots within the
   altered flower-networks, which could negatively impact hosts
   experiencing an increased exposure; (2) improved tolerance of the hosts,

Abstract = {{The symbiotic organism search (SOS) is a recently proposed metaheuristic

   the effectiveness of SOS against that of optimization algorithms

Abstract = {{The geographical range of pollinators is an important factor determining

   Here, we investigated the pollination biology of the endangered orchid
   Caladenia versicolor, with the aim of improving management of wild
   populations and conservation translocations (artificial translocation
   for conservation). Using portable groups of cultivated plants to attract
   pollinators, we found that at natural sites C. versicolor is
   predominantly pollinated by food-foraging males of one species of bee,
   Leioproctus platycephalus (Colletidae), with only occasional visits from
   females or other bee species. This apparently high degree of
   specialization occurred despite the presence of a co-occurring bee
   community of >20 species. Although previously thought to be nectarless,
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of labellum secretions
   revealed that C. versicolor produces meagre quantities of sucrose on the
   upper surface of the labellum, on which some pollinators appeared to
   feed. Reproductive success was high in C. versicolor at both natural and
   translocated sites. Although C. versicolor now has a restricted range,
   L. platycephalus is found across a broad area of southern Australia.
   Thus, pollinator availability does not appear to have contributed to the
   rarity of C. versicolor, but the apparent reliance on L. platycephalus
   means that the availability of this species needs to be taken into
   account for conservation management and translocations.}},

   Melastomataceae. We used random forest analyses to identify key traits
   associated with the different pollinators of 19 Merianieae species and

   morphospace analyses to compare the morphological diversity (disparity)
   among syndromes. We identified three pollination syndromes ('buzz-bee',

   expulsion mechanisms and reward types, but not by traditional syndrome
   characters. Further, we found that `efficiency' rather than `attraction'
   traits were important for syndrome circumscription. Contrary to syndrome
   theory, our study supports the pooling of different pollinators

   `mixed-vertebrate' syndrome, and we found that disparity was highest in

   butterflies and moths. The other six species were more frequently
   pollinated by bees with a high intensity of pollen grooming. Bird- and
   Lepidoptera-pollinated species produced longer pollen-connecting threads
   that connected more pollen grains. Phylogenetically independent contrast
   analysis of the 13 species showed that pollinator visitation frequency
   was negatively related to amounts of pollen removal per visit but not to

Abstract = {{Many optimization algorithms have adopted scale-free networks to improve
   the search ability. However, most methods have merely changed their
   population topologies into those of scale-free networks; their
   experimental results cannot verify that these algorithm: have superior
   performance. In this paper, we propose a scale-free artificial bee
   colony algorithm (SFABC) in which the search is guided by a scale-free
   network. The mechanise enables the SFABC search to follow two rules.
   First, the bad food sources can learn more information from the good
   sources of their neighbors. Second, the information exchanged among good
   food sources is relatively rare. To verify the effectiveness of SFABC,
   the algorithm is compared with the original artificial bee colony
   algorithm (ABC), several advance ABC variants, and other metaheuristic
   algorithms on a wide range of benchmark functions Experimental results
   and statistical analyses indicate that SFABC obtains a better balance
   between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process and
   that, in most cases, it can provide a competitive performance of the
   benchmark functions. We also verify that scale-free networks can not
   only improve the optimization performance of ABC but also enhance the
   search ability of other metaheuristic algorithms, such as differentia

Abstract = {{To gain a deeper understanding of the molecular basis of pollen foraging
   preference, we characterized the proteomes of antennae and brains of
   bees foraging on pear and rapeseed flowers, and the volatile compounds
   from nectar, anther, and inflorescence of both plants. Bees foraging on
   the pollen of the two plants have shaped the distinct proteome arsenals
   in the antenna and brain to drive olfactory and brain function. In
   antennae, bees foraging on pear (PA) pollen pathways associated with
   protein metabolism were induced to synthesize new proteins for
   modulation of synaptic structures via stabilizing and consolidating
   specific memory traces. Whereas, bees foraging on rapeseed (BA) pollen
   pathways implicated in energy metabolism were activated to provide
   metabolic fuels critical for neural activity. These findings suggest
   that the distinct biochemical route is functionally enhanced to
   consolidate the divergent olfaction in PA and BA. In brain, although the
   uniquely induced pathways in bees forging on both plants are likely to
   cement selective roles in learning and memory, pollen foraging
   preference in bees is mainly drived by olfaction. Furthermore, both
   plants have shaped different repertoires of signal odors and food
   rewards to attract pollinators. The suggested markers are potentially
   useful for selection of bees to improve their olfaction for better

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator networks have been widely used to understand the
   ecology of mutualistic interactions between plants and animals. While a
   number of general patterns have been identified, the mechanisms
   underlying the structure of plant-pollinator networks are poorly
   understood. Here we present an agent based model (ABM) that simulates
   the movement of bees over heterogeneous landscapes and captures
   pollination events, enabling the influence of landscape pattern on
   pollination networks to be explored. Using the model, we conducted a
   series of experiments using virtual landscapes representing a gradient
   of forest loss and fragmentation. The ABM was able to produce expected
   trends in network structure, from simulations of interactions between
   individual plants and pollinators. For example, results indicated an
   increase in the index of complementary specialization (H-2') and a
   decline in network connectance with increasing forest cover.
   Furthermore, network nestedness was not associated with the degree of
   forest cover, but was positively related to forest patch size, further
   supporting results obtained in the field. This illustrates the potential
   value of ABMs for exploring the structure and dynamics of
   plant-pollinator networks, and for understanding the mechanisms that
   underlie them. We attribute the results obtained primarily to a shift
   from specialist to generalist pollinators with increasing forest loss, a
   trend that has been observed in some field situations.}},

Abstract = {{Virgin queens (gynes) exhibit a range of behaviors in order to be
   accepted as the leader of colony. However, environmental neurotoxic
   insecticides as neonicotinoids may affect the social performance of the
   bees. Here, we evaluated the sublethal effects of neonicotinoid

   species of neotropical stingless bee. Several behaviors were analyzed as
   multivariate response variables in a Hotelling test, as well as
   generalized additive mixed models. Our findings demonstrate that treated
   queens perform less wing vibration and trophallaxis with their workers.
   Furthermore, the treated gynes encounter more harassment (aggression)
   from their workers, suggesting that workers can differentiate nontreated
   queens from treated queens most likely by chemical signals. Our data
   indicate that the behavioral repertoire underlying the queen selection
   process by the stingless bee P. droryana may be seriously affected by
   residual doses of imidacloprid in larval food. As a result, such queens
   are rather undernourished and aggressed by workers, which most likely
   compromises the viability and permanence of colonies in the long term.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Adaptation to local host plants may impact a pollinator's population
   genetic structure by reducing gene flow and driving population genetic
   differentiation, representing an early stage of ecological speciation.
   South African Rediviva longimanus bees exhibit elongated forelegs, a
   bizarre adaptation for collecting oil from floral spurs of their Diascia
   hosts. Furthermore, R. longimanus foreleg length (FLL) differs
   significantly among populations, which has been hypothesised to result
   from selection imposed by inter-population variation in Diascia floral
   spur length. Here, we used a pooled restriction site-associated DNA
   sequencing (pooled RAD-seq) approach to investigate the population
   genetic structure of R. longimanus and to test if phenotypic differences
   in FLL translate into increased genetic differentiation (i) between R.
   longimanus populations and (ii) between phenotypes across populations.
   We also inferred the effects of demographic processes on population
   genetic structure and tested for genetic markers underpinning local
   adaptation.ResultsPopulations showed marked genetic differentiation
   (average F-ST=0.165), though differentiation was not statistically
   associated with differences between populations in FLL. All populations
   exhibited very low genetic diversity and were inferred to have gone
   through recent bottleneck events, suggesting extremely low effective
   population sizes. Genetic differentiation between samples pooled by leg
   length (short versus long) rather than by population of origin was even
   higher (F-ST=0.260) than between populations, suggesting reduced
   interbreeding between long and short-legged individuals. Signatures of
   selection were detected in 1119 (3.8\%) of a total of 29,721 SNP
   markers,ConclusionsPopulations of R. longimanus appear to be small,
   bottlenecked and isolated. Though we could not detect the effect of
   local adaptation (FLL in response to floral spurs of host plants) on
   population genetic differentiation, short and long legged bees appeared
   to be partially differentiated, suggesting incipient ecological
   speciation. To test this hypothesis, greater resolution through the use
   of individual-based whole-genome analyses is now needed to quantify the
   degree of reproductive isolation between long and short legged bees
   between and even within populations.}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Bombus) are important pollinators and
   models for studying mechanisms underlying developmental plasticity, such
   as factors influencing size, immunity, and social behaviors. Research on
   such processes, as well as expanding use of gene-manipulation and gene
   expression technologies, requires a detailed understanding of how these
   bees develop. Developmental research often uses time-staging of pupae,
   however dramatic size differences in these bees can generate variation
   in developmental timing. To study developmental mechanisms in bumble
   bees, appropriate staging of developing bees using morphology is
   necessary. In this study, we describe morphological changes across
   development in several bumble bee species and use this to establish
   morphology-based staging criteria, establishing 20 distinct illustrated
   stages. These criteria, defined largely by eye and cuticle pigmentation
   patterns, are generalizable across members of the subgenus Pyrobombus,
   and can be used as a framework for study of other bumble bee subgenera.
   We examine the effects of temperature, caste, size, and species on pupal
   development, revealing that pupal duration shifts with each of these
   factors, confirming the importance of staging pupae based on morphology
   rather than age and the need for standardizing sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate, efficient and reliable parameter extraction of solar
   photovoltaic (PV) models from the measured current-voltage (I-V)
   characteristic curves is important for evaluation, modelling, and
   diagnosis of the actual operating state of in-situ PV arrays. In recent
   years, numerical heuristic optimization algorithms based parameter
   extraction methods have been proposed. However, the efficiency and
   reliability of these methods are limited due to heuristic or stochastic
   searching strategies. In this paper, by combining the trust-region
   reflective (TRR) deterministic algorithm with the artificial bee colony
   (ABC) metaheuristic algorithm, a new hybrid algorithm ABC-TRR is
   proposed to improve the parameter extraction of PV models. The ABC-TRR
   algorithm combines the global exploration capability of the ABC and the
   local exploitation of the TRR, which achieves a good tradeoff among
   accuracy, convergence and reliability. The proposed ABC-TRR hybrid
   algorithm is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art
   algorithms using the standard I-V curves of the benchmark
   Photowatt-PWP201 PV module and RTC France solar cell as well as the
   measured I-V curves of a laboratory PV module/string/array.
   Comprehensive experimental analysis and comparison results demonstrate
   that the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm achieves the same level of accuracy
   as the best reported algorithms with the highest overall reliability.
   More importantly, the ABC-TRR algorithm converges 4.69 times faster than
   the best-reported algorithms on average. In view of these advantages,
   the proposed ABC-TRR algorithm is a promising altemative for accurately,
   efficiently and reliably extracting the parameters of PV models from
   measured I-V curves. In addition, it was experimentally demonstrated
   that the parameter extraction result can be used to indicate the partial
   shading and abnormal degradation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Studies at multiple scales are essential to obtaining a holistic view of
   bee conservation. We aimed to detect the main factors that should be
   considered in a multiple-scale approach for small forest patches in
   order to contribute to the conservation plans for stingless bees. The
   study was conducted in small forest patches of the Atlantic Forest, in
   the municipality of Salto de Pirapora (SP, Brazil). The spatial analysis
   was developed based on forest patch size, forest patch core size,
   distance from the nearest forest patch, and distance from the nearest
   body of water. Based on these criteria, we selected three hotspot forest
   patches (including all criteria that favor the presence of stingless
   bees with arboreal nesting habits) and three control forest patches
   (which does not fulfill all these criteria), and we evaluated the
   presence of stingless bees based on the occupation of artificial
   shelters installed in the patches. From the 72 installed artificial
   shelters, we observed 27 shelters (37.5\%) carrying some association
   with stingless bees presence. Bees showed a preference for occupying
   artificial shelters that were located in the patches' cores (66.7\%).
   The structure and composition of the vegetation showed great importance
   to the occupation of the artificial shelters, as there was a strong
   correlation between the occupied shelters and the diameter and the
   height of the trees. There was also a correlation between the presence
   of grasses and shrubs (p < 0.05), which were the main providers of
   floral resources. The data of the land cover was an essential factor for
   the development of spatial analysis, and we found a strong negative
   correlation with pastures and a positive correlation with forestry (p <
   0.05). To elaborate multiscale approaches, it is essential to evaluate
   the quality of foraging (amount of flowers) and nesting (diameter and
   height of trees) resources, as well as the surroundings of the patches.
   The study provided data so that the information can be extrapolated to
   other scenarios and encourage the conservation of small forest patches
   as a strategy for the conservation of stingless bees.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{430}},
Pages = {{629-638}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Wild bees have separate food and nest sites, two essential resources
   that potentially could limit bee populations. Many solitary bee species
   nest in holes in deadwood. Female bees collect pollen and nectar, which
   is stored in the nests as a food supply for their offspring. It is not
   well understood how availability of either resource affects bee species
   with different life histories. This study aimed to demonstrate the
   relative importance of food and nesting resources on population size of
   two cavity-nesting wild bee species that differ in their requirements
   regarding food- and nesting resource. Standardized trap nests consisting
   of wooden poles with pre-drilled holes were deployed in 15 young boreal
   forest stands to monitor bee abundance. At each site the food resource
   (flowering plants) and nesting resource (holes in deadwood) for
   hole-nesting solitary bees were surveyed in the nearby surroundings. The
   food resource was differentiated into flowers occurring in young forest
   stands and flowers occurring along forest roadsides. Generalized and
   general linear models were used to predict nest abundance in the trap
   nests of two bee species. A total of 166 nests of a pollen-specialist
   species, Megachile Japonica, and 38 nests of a pollen-generalist
   species, Hylaeus annulatus were found in the traps. The nest abundance
   of M. lapponica across the sites was predicted only by this species'
   specific food resource, fireweed, Chamerion angustifolium, whereas the
   nest abundance of H. annulatus was predicted by both food and nesting
   resources. In a simple linear regression, the density of suitable
   nesting holes for H. annulatus explained 38\% of the variation in the
   number of nests. Corresponding values for the food resource density
   along sun exposed gravel roadsides and in young forest stands were 63\%
   and 41\% respectively. In a multiple regression, the three variables
   nesting resource density, food resource density in young forest stands
   and food resource density along sun exposed roadsides - explained 86\%
   of the variation in abundance of H. annulatus nests. Nesting and food
   resource densities for H. annulatus were not correlated with each other.
   Our results imply that creation and retention of standing dead wood are
   conservation measures that favor H. annulatus since the availability of
   nest holes in standing dead wood limited population sizes. To locate the
   high stumps near sun-exposed forest roads with a dense flora should
   increase the efficiency of this measure since H. annulatus was
   particularly favored by flower rich roadsides.}},

Title = {{Flower strip networks offer promising long term effects on pollinator
   species richness in intensively cultivated agricultural areas}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intensively cultivated agricultural landscapes often suffer
   from substantial pollinator losses, which may be leading to decreasing
   pollination services for crops and wild flowering plants. Conservation
   measures that are easy to implement and accepted by farmers are needed
   to halt a further loss of pollinators in large areas under intensive
   agricultural management. Here we report the results of a replicated
   long-term study involving networks of mostly perennial flower strips
   covering 10\% of a conventionally managed agricultural landscape in
   southwestern Germany.
   Results: We demonstrate the considerable success of these measures for
   wild bee and butterfly species richness over an observation period of 5
   years. Overall species richness of bees and butterflies but also the
   numbers of specialist bee species clearly increased in the ecological
   enhancement areas as compared to the control areas without ecological
   enhancement measures. A three to five-fold increase in species richness
   was found after more than 2 years of enhancement of the areas with
   flower strips. Oligolectic bee species increased significantly only
   after the third year.
   Conclusions: In our long-term field experiment we used a large variety
   of seed mixtures and temporal variation in seeding time, ensured
   continuity of the flower-strips by using perennial seed mixtures and
   distributed the measures over c. 10\% of the landscape. This led to an
   increase in pollinator abundance, suggesting that these measures may be
   instrumental for the successful support of pollinators. These measures
   may ensure the availability of a network of diverse habitats and
   foraging resources for pollinators throughout the year, as well as
   nesting sites for many species. The measures are applied in-field and
   are suitable for application in areas under intensive agriculture. We
   propose that flower strip networks should be implemented much more in
   the upcoming CAP (common agricultural policy) reform in the European
   Union and promoted more by advisory services for farmers.}},

   Staircase-Escalante National Monument}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument is a federally protected
   area found in central southern Utah. Designated in 1996 by President
   William J. Clinton, it was recently reduced in size by President Donald
   J. Trump in a proclamation that turned the one large monument into three
   smaller ones. A long-term, standardized study of the bees had been
   conducted from 2000-2003, revealing 660 species. The bee communities of
   the area are characterized by being spatially heterogeneous; most of the
   bees occur in isolated areas, with only a few being both abundant and
   widespread. Here we examine what affect the recent resizing of the
   monument has on the number, and ecology, of the bees now excluded from
   monument boundaries. Using the new monument boundaries and the
   geographic coordinates associated with each bee, we derived new species
   lists for each of the three monuments, and compared them to each other,
   and to the excluded lands. All three monuments now protect unique
   faunas, with Bray-Curtis similarity values not exceeding 0.59\%. Each
   monument now harbors species not found in the other two monuments. We
   found that 84 bee species are no longer protected by any of the three
   monuments. These 84 species were not concentrated in one area that is
   now excluded, but were scattered throughout the newly excluded lands.
   For some of the excluded bee species, there is no evidence that they are
   rare or imperiled, being widespread throughout the west. However, there
   is a concentration of bees in the southern and eastern former monument
   lands that represent range extensions from nearby hot deserts. In
   addition to numerous range extensions, the list of excluded bees also
   contains several undescribed species (newly discovered species that have
   not yet been named and described by taxonomists) and morphospecies
   (individuals that are morphologically distinct, but that require
   additional research before species designations can be made). This
   indicates that the bee communities housed in these exduded areas would
   benefit from additional scientific inquiry. The areas now excluded from
   monument protections house a greater proportion of the original GSENM
   bee community than any of the three new monument units. We conclude this
   paper by discussing what the smaller monuments might mean for bee
   conservation in this hot spot of bee biodiversity and suggest that bee
   communities here and elsewhere should be taken into account when
   conservation decisions are being made.}},

   their nectar feeding is affected by morphological constraints related to
   flower morphology. Despite the growing appreciation of hoverflies and
   other non-bee insects as pollinators, there is a lack of community-wide
   studies of flower visitation by syrphids. The aim of this paper is to
   provide a detailed analysis of flower visitation patterns in a species
   rich community of syrphids in a Central European grassland and to
   evaluate how species traits shape the structure of the plant-hoverfly
   flower visitation network. We found that different species varied in the
   level of specialisation, and while some species visited a similar
   spectre of flowers, others partitioned resources more strongly. There
   was a consistent difference in both specialisation and flower
   preferences between three syrphid subfamilies. Eristalinae and Pipizinae
   were more specialised than Syrphinae. Trait-based analyses showed that
   relative flower visitation (i) increased with plant height, but most
   strongly in Eristalinae; (ii) increased with inflorescence size in small
   species from all three subfamilies, but was independent of inflorescence
   size in large species of Eristalinae and Syrphinae; and (iii) depended
   on flower colour, but in a subfamily-specific way. Eristalinae showed
   the strongest flower colour preferences for white flowers, Pipizinae
   visited mostly white and yellow flowers, while Syrphinae were less
   affected by flower colour. Exploration of the structure of the
   plant-hoverfly flower visitation network showed that the network was
   both modular and nested. We also found that there were almost no
   differences in specialisation and relative visitation frequency between
   males and females. Overall, we showed that flower visitation in syrphids
   was affected by phylogenetic relatedness, body size of syrphids and
   several plant traits.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticide use has been suggested as a cause of honey bee
   colony decline; however, detection rates and concentrations of
   neonicotinoid insecticide residues in field-collected honey bees have
   been low. We collected honey bee and beebread samples from apiaries in
   agricultural, developed, and undeveloped areas during 2 years in
   Virginia to assess whether landscape type or county pesticide use was
   predictive of honey bee colony exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides.
   Trace concentrations of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid were detected in
   honey bees (3 of 84 samples, 2.02-3.97 ng/g), whereas higher
   concentrations were detected in beebread (5 of 84 samples, 4.68-11.5
   ng/g) and pollen (three of five pollen trap samples, 7.86-12.6 ng/g).
   Imidacloprid was only detected in samples collected during July and
   August and was not detected in honey bees from hives where
   neonicotinoids were detected in pollen or beebread. The number of hives
   sampled at a site, county pesticide use, and landscape characteristics
   were not predictive of neonicotinoid detections in honey bees or
   beebread (all P > 0.05). Field surveys may underestimate honey bee
   exposure to field-realistic levels of pesticides or the risk of exposure
   in different landscapes because of low detection rates. Undetectably low
   levels of exposure or high levels of exposure that go undetected raise
   questions with regard to potential threats to honey bees and other

Abstract = {{Both plant and insect communities undergo phenological changes across
   the season, leading to seasonal changes in species diversity and
   interactions. Network theory offers important tools for understanding
   how groups of flowering plants and insects interact. However, most
   studies of plant pollinator networks aggregate samples over time,
   masking phenological changes in the network over the growing season.
   Furthermore, estimates of biodiversity are derived from network
   observations, meaning that the ecological community is not assessed
   independently from the structure of the network. Understanding how
   biodiversity influences network structure over time is important for
   predicting how global change will affect the ecological processes
   shaping networks. In this study, we sampled the flower community, insect
   community, and the pollination network of a high Arctic dwarf-shrub
   ecosystem over the course of an entire growing season. We found that the
   flower community was a stronger predictor of network complexity and
   interaction diversity than the insect community. We suggest that
   studying networks at scales relevant to both plants and pollinators can
   provide insight into the mechanisms underlying network formation. This
   improved knowledge could help to better understand and predict the

Abstract = {{Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly dynamic regions of the genome. Mutations
   at these loci represent a significant source of genetic variation and
   can facilitate rapid adaptation. Bumblebees are important pollinating
   insects occupying a wide range of habitats. However, to date, molecular
   mechanisms underlying the potential adaptation of bumblebees to diverse
   habitats are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigate how
   TRs contribute to genetic variation in bumblebees, thus potentially
   facilitating adaptation. We identified 26,595 TRs from the assembled 18
   chromosome sequences of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris),
   66.7\% of which reside in genic regions. We also compared TRs found in
   B. terrestris with those present in the assembled genome sequence of a
   congener, B. impatiens. We found that a total of 1,137 TRs were variable
   in length between the two sequenced bumblebee species, and further
   analysis reveals that 101 of them are located within coding regions.
   These 101 TRs are responsible for coding sequence variation and
   correspond to protein sequence length variation between the two
   bumblebee species. The variability of identified TRs in coding regions
   between bumblebees was confirmed by PCR amplification of a subset of
   loci. Functional classification of bumblebee genes where coding
   sequences include variable-length TRs suggests that a majority of genes
   (87\%) that could be assigned to a protein class are related to
   transcriptional regulation. Our results show that TRs contribute to
   coding sequence variation in bumblebees, and thus may facilitate the
   adaptation of bumblebees through diversifying proteins involved in
   controlling gene expression.}},

   We investigated whether cavity-nesting bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae)

   would use artificial trap nests. Different nest designs were compared,
   as was nesting occupancy between fruit-bearing and vegetative fields.
   Milk carton nests had significantly more uptake by and emergence of

   wooden nests had at least one occupied nesting tube versus 73\% of milk
   carton nests, with a total of 34\% nesting tubes occupied. Bee emergence
   was significantly higher in nesting tubes from fruit-bearing fields than
   vegetative fields. Osmia and Megachile emergence was low from milk
   carton nests, with bees emerging from less than 10\% of occupied nesting
   tubes, in large part due to parasitism. Overturned clay lids were tested

Abstract = {{Research on wild bees (Apiformes) was conducted in the Lower Oder Valley

   total, we collected there 4158 specimens of Apiformes, representing 180
   species. We have proved that mid-forest grasslands with a high
   proportion of thermophilous broad-leaved forests and xerothermic shrub
   communities are equally attractive to wild bees as open habitats (sandy
   grasslands, xerothermic grasslands/heaths). We observed varied responses
   of wild bee species with specific functional characteristics to
   increasing proportion of woody vegetation. The grasslands surrounded by
   forests were characterized by the highest number of cleptoparasitic
   species. In contrast, solitary and social bee species preferred
   forest-steppe habitats. However, in open habitats, solitary bees were
   the most abundant. Moreover, open habitats were distinguished by the
   highest number and abundance of rare species. Active protection of
   thermophilous grasslands is crucial for biodiversity conservation, also
   with respect to the natural resources of Apiformes. Preservation of

Abstract = {{Wildflower strips (WFS) are increasingly used to counteract the negative
   consequences of agricultural intensification. To date, it is poorly
   understood how WFS promote flower visitation and pollination services in
   nearby insect-pollinated crops. We therefore ask whether WFS enhance
   pollination service in adjacent strawberry crops, and how such an effect
   depends on the distance from WFS. Over 2 years, we examined the effects
   of experimentally sown WFS compared to grassy strips on pollination
   services in adjacent strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) crops across a total
   of 19 study sites. Moreover, we examined flower visitation, species
   richness and community composition of the most important insect
   pollinator taxa at different within-field locations varying in distance
   to WFS. We found increased pollination services at the edge of WFS
   compared to locally reduced pollination services at the center, which
   resulted in no significant difference in seed set between WFS and
   control fields. Total flower visits and species richness of pollinators
   were higher in WFS than in adjacent strawberry fields. Moreover, wild
   bee visitation was enhanced in adjacent strawberry crops near WFS
   compared to field centers, and intermediate at field edges near grassy
   strips. Our study demonstrates that diverse WFS can increase wild bee
   visitation and pollination services in the field edges of adjacent
   strawberry crops, but that overall visitation and pollination services
   do not increase. Moreover, our findings show that major pollinator taxa
   exhibit distinct responses, resulting in a shift of pollinator community
   composition as a function of distance to WFS with direct effects on crop
   pollination. Our results that WFS enhance rather than reduce crop
   pollination services near WFS should distract possible concerns by
   farmers that WFS may locally absorb rather than export crop pollinators.
   Considering the spatial restricted enhancement of wild bees and
   associated pollination services we suggest to establish WFS in the
   center of crop fields.}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar represents an ephemeral habitat that is restricted in time

   we tested the hypothesis that hibernating bumblebee queens function as a
   reservoir for nectar yeasts in the absence of plants or pollinators
   during winter. Our results show that the nectar yeast, Metschnikowia
   reukaufii, was present in the gastrointestinal tract of wild bumblebee
   queens that emerged from hibernation and that it could persist inside
   the gut of hibernating queens under experimental conditions. However, no
   evidence for such persistence was found in the case of the second most
   frequent nectar yeast, M. gruessii. Furthermore, a phylloplane yeast
   that occasionally inhabits nectar, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, was able to
   colonize the gut under experimental conditions. Two bumblebee-associated
   yeasts, Candida bombi and C. bombiphila, were successfully passed down

Abstract = {{1. Flower-dwelling predators may interfere in plant-pollinator
   interactions through changes in pollinator behaviour, leading to a
   reduction in pollination services. Although the context-dependency of
   tri-trophic interactions is often acknowledged, the relative
   contribution of predator, pollinator and flower traits in shaping
   pollinator behaviour has been rarely studied simultaneously. 2.
   Pollinators' responses to predation risk were evaluated using artificial
   spiders on Alstroemeria aurea flowers in order to experimentally test
   whether predator traits (colour and size) and nectar availability affect
   their behaviour and plant fitness. 3. Regarding the predator's traits,
   both sizes of artificial spiders used were similarly rejected, but
   spider colour was detected differently. In particular, red and black
   artificial spiders were more strongly rejected than the rest. In turn,
   nectar availability increased the time spent in the inflorescences, yet
   most pollinators rejected flowers with artificial spiders independently
   of nectar availability. Furthermore, responses to artificial spider
   colour and nectar availability varied significantly between dipterans
   and hymenopterans. Finally, artificial spiders reduced seed set and
   fruit weight of plants owing to changes in the behaviour of the most
   efficient pollinators. 4. It was shown that poorly studied predator
   traits such as colour and size may affect pollinator behaviour in
   different ways among taxa. In addition, feeding necessity in a
   rich-resource environment was a weaker selecting force than predation
   risk. Hence, it is argued here that trade-offs between predation and
   flower reward may arise depending on predator detection, relationship
   between pollinator and predator size, and resource availability in the
   ecosystem with consequences for plant fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Bees and wasps are important facets of natural capital to be valued
   by human societies: bees pollinate wild flowers and agricultural crops;
   wasps regulate arthropod populations, including insect vectors of human
   diseases and crop pests. Despite the importance of both taxa, bees are
   universally loved whilst wasps are universally despised. This study
   explores some of the reasons behind this. 2. Here data are presented
   from almost 750 members of the public on their perceptions of insects,
   including bees and wasps. In addition, an analysis is conducted of
   researcher effort on bees and wasps, using publication numbers of
   peer-reviewed papers over the last 37 years, and unpublished conference
   proceedings at specialist international conferences over the last 16
   years. 3. The results show that wasps are indeed universally disliked by
   the public and moreover are unpopular research taxa among researchers.
   Words used to describe wasps are emotive and negative, whilst those
   describing bees are functional and positive. A low level of interest in
   nature and a lack of knowledge (among the public) and research effort
   (among scientists) regarding the ecosystem services of wasps are likely
   to be at the root of the negative perception. Whilst the ecosystem
   services of bees are well understood by the public, those provided by
   wasps are poorly understood. 4. Positive action to promote research on
   wasps and to overhaul the public image of wasps via outreach and the
   media could help to reset the imbalance in appreciation of two of the
   world's most ecologically important taxa. Cultural shifts to a more
   positive attitude towards wasps could be pivotal in working with these
   facets of natural capital, rather than against them.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas specialized pollination is well recognized to cause floral
   adaptation, we know little about the evolutionary impact of generalized
   pollination. For example, it is largely unknown whether such pollination
   can lead to adaptive floral divergence and to what degree pollinators

   we investigated the evolutionary consequences of combined bumblebee- and
   hoverfly-pollination ({''}generalized{''} pollination) in comparison
   with those of each individual pollinator species (specialized
   pollination), using fast-cycling Brassica rapa plants during seven
   generations of experimental evolution. Bumblebees were twice as
   efficient as hoverflies in pollinating B. rapa flowers, but phenotypic
   selection and evolutionary change in plants with generalized pollination
   was different from both bumblebee- and hoverfly-pollinated plants for
   several traits. After seven generations evolution, plants with
   generalized pollination resembled bumblebee-pollinated plants in having
   little spontaneous selfing and tall size, but were more similar to
   hoverfly-pollinated plants in having low floral scent emission. This
   unique trait combination supports the idea of a generalized-pollination
   ecotype, coined neither by the most efficient pollinator, nor by an
   evolutionary average between the changes caused by each individual

   conclusions Forested, agricultural and urban landscapes did not differ

   that maintain beta diversity at the species level, but contribute to low

Abstract = {{We present novel dynamic mixture models for the monitoring of bumblebee

   in that year, from citizen science data. All of these parameters are
   estimated separately for each caste, giving a means of considerable
   ecological detail in examining temporal changes in the complex life
   cycle of a social insect in the wild. Due to the dynamic nature of the
   models, we are able to produce population trends for a number of UK
   bumblebee species using the available time-series. Via an additional
   simulation exercise, we show the extent to which useful information will
   increase if the survey continues, and expands in scale, as expected.
   Bumblebees are extraordinarily important components of the ecosystem,
   providing pollination services of vast economic impact and functioning
   as indicator species for changes in climate or land use. Our results

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence of the benefits of introducing urban
   meadows as an alternative to amenity mown grass in public greenspaces,
   both for biodiversity, and human wellbeing. Developing a better
   understanding of the meadow characteristics driving human and wildlife
   response is therefore critical. We addressed this by assessing public
   and invertebrate response to eight different annual meadow mixes defined
   by two levels of plant species diversity and two levels of colour
   diversity, sown in an urban park in Luton, UK, in April 2015. On-site
   questionnaires with the visiting public were conducted in July, August
   and September 2015. Invertebrate responses were assessed via
   contemporaneous visual surveys and one sweep net survey (August 2015).
   Flower colour diversity had effects on human aesthetic response and the
   response of pollinators such as bumblebees and hoverflies. Plant species
   diversity, however, was not a driver of human response with evidence
   that people used colour diversity as a cue to assessing species
   diversity. Plant species diversity did affect some invertebrates, with
   higher abundances of certain taxa in low species diversity meadows. Our
   findings indicate that if the priority for sown meadows is to maximise
   human aesthetic enjoyment and the abundance and diversity of observable
   invertebrates, particularly pollinators, managers of urban green
   infrastructure should prioritise high flower colour diversity mixes over
   those of high plant species diversity. Incorporating late-flowering
   non-native species such as Coreopsis tinctoria (plains coreopsis) can
   prolong the attractiveness of the meadows for people and availability of
   resources for pollinators and would therefore be beneficial.}},

   Oenothera. Field experiments showed that autonomous selfing occurs at
   bud stage, prior to the opening of the flower. Control flowers showed
   similar seed set to hand-pollinated flowers, whereas emasculated flowers
   and those subject to open pollination set fewer seed. These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that the investigated Oenothera exhibit a
   great capacity for autonomous selfing and that selfing is selected in
   order to provide reproductive assurance. Although flowers were visited
   mostly by nocturnal lepidopterans, these insects did not precipitate
   pollination and are thus considered nectar thieves. Conversely, analysis
   of pollen loads and behavior during foraging by diurnal insect visitors
   revealed that honeybees and bumblebees are the probable pollinators. We
   conclude that production of flowers capable of autonomous selfing at bud
   stage, followed by anthesis and opportunities for outcrossing, probably
   improves the invasive potential of these Oenothera in Europe, together

Abstract = {{Compared to traditional arable crops, second-generation perennial energy
   crops (PECs) are generally associated with increased biodiversity and
   ecosystem services, but robust experimental studies on this subject are
   few. Consequently, the potential for PEC cultivation to contribute to
   enhanced pollination processes in adjacent farmland remains unclear. In
   a 4-year field study across multiple sites and two PECs (Miscanthus x
   giganteus and willow short-rotation coppice), we examine whether
   pollinator visits to crop margin wildflowers were augmented by PEC
   cultivation. Each field was paired with two cereal fields, one adjacent
   to the PEC and one distant, and we recorded wildflower visits to crop
   margins by three pollinator groups: hoverflies, bumblebees and
   butterflies/moths. We also quantified floral resources, since
   crop-specific management seemed a likely means of influencing margin
   wildflowers and thus pollinator activity. Our results add quantitative
   support to the suggestion that PECs should enhance ecosystem processes
   in agri-landscapes. However, benefits were highly context-dependent.
   Consistent enhancement of pollinator activity in margins of PEC fields
   was only apparent for willow where the relative frequency of flower
   visitation was higher for all three pollinator groups compared to
   adjacent or distant cereals. This distribution was most likely
   positively associated with the increased availability of preferred food
   plants in willow margins. In Miscanthus, by contrast, opposing trends
   arose for different pollinator taxa: Lepidoptera were the only
   pollinator group more frequently associated with PEC margins; bumblebees
   showed no variation while hoverflies were comparatively more abundant in
   distant cereal margins than in other crop types. Future land-use
   practices should consider how PEC identity affects both target species
   and ecosystem processes. Tackling anthropogenic climate change through
   cultivation of willow, in particular, may yield local conservation
   benefits for both wildflowers and pollinators, although strategic
   cultivation of PECs to enhance pollination processes in the wider
   agri-environment may not be achievable.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction networks are sensitive to elevation gradients through
   changes in local distribution of interacting partners. Here, we use
   plant-pollinator interaction network metrics to assess the effect of
   elevation on flowers and flower-visiting insect assemblages on a
   sentinel mountain used for monitoring climate change in the flower-and
   insect-rich Cape Floristic Region. We also use these interaction metrics
   to explain the effect of environmental factors on the interaction
   networks. We did this over four vegetation zones <1640m asl, as
   determined by former botanical studies. Overall, bees were the dominant
   flower visitors, followed by monkey beetles, and far behind were wasps
   and flies. The middle elevation zone (650-744 m a.s.l), which is also an
   ecotone between two distinct botanical zones, had the highest species
   richness and abundance of interacting plants and insects. Interaction
   frequency and size of network were also greatest in the middle zone, as
   were network diversity, generality, and linkage density, while lowest in
   the peak zone. In sum, there was distinct elevation zoning of
   flower-visiting insects. The greatest zonal change was between species
   at the middle compared with peak zone. Large-sized monkey beetles, bees
   and flies characterized the unique assemblage in the peak zone
   (1576-1640 m a.s.l.). The insect zonation tracked that of plant
   assemblages, with air temperature (lapse rate) being the primary driver
   of bee distribution, with lowest levels in the peak zone. In contrast,
   beetle distribution was driven mostly by flower assemblages as well as
   air temperature. In turn, wasp and fly interaction networks were not
   affected by any of the measured environmental variables. We conclude
   that increased elevation stress from reduced temperatures, changing
   abiotic weather conditions (e.g. strong winds at high elevations), and
   decline in flowering plant composition causes breakdown of interaction
   networks involving bees and beetles but not that of flies and wasps.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus Latrielle) are significant pollinators of flowering
   plants due to their large body size, abundant setae, and generalist
   foraging strategies. However, shared setal coloration patterns among
   closely and distantly related bumble bee species makes identification
   notoriously difficult. The advent of molecular genetic techniques has
   increased our understanding of bumble bee evolution and taxonomy, and
   enables effective conservation policy and management. Individuals
   belonging to the North American Bombus fervidus species-complex (SC) are
   homogenous in body structure but exhibit significant body color
   phenotype variation across their geographic distribution. Given the
   uncertainty of the genealogical boundaries within the SC, some authors
   have synonymized all members of the B. fervidus SC within a single
   taxon, while others propose an alternative two taxa hypothesis.
   Operating under the phylogenetic species concept, our analysis supports
   the hypothesis that there are two independent lineages of bumble bees
   within the B. fervidus SC. With the current evidence, however, it is not
   possible to assign valid names to either of them, because both lineages
   include the color phenotypes found in the original species descriptions
   of B. fervidus and B. californicus. Cryptic speciation does not seem to
   be the product of Mullerian mimicry between the clades, because
   diverging coloration patterns are observed when the distribution of the
   clades overlaps. Furthermore, within each lineage there is evidence for
   strong population differentiation that is correlated with geographic
   distribution rather than color phenotype. In our study, we demonstrate
   the importance of obtaining a broad sample of multiple populations when
   conducting lower-level phylogenetic analyses. In addition to improving
   our knowledge of bumble bee diversification patterns, characterizing the
   evolutionary history of these pollinators provides the foundation needed
   to guide contemporary conservation assessments and management

Abstract = {{Flavipanurgus is a small genus of panurgine bees known only from the
   Iberian Peninsula. Despite its status as one of the few bee genera
   endemic to Europe, Flavipanurgus are poorly represented in collections
   and until recently, their ecology had been almost unknown Flavipanurgus
   ibericus (Warncke, 1972) was described from southern Iberia, with a
   northern subspecies F. i. kastiliensis (Warncke, 1987) later described
   from the north. Recent collections in Portugal have revealed clear
   differences in the pollen collecting patterns of the two taxa, with
   southern females collecting exclusively from Jasione montana and
   northern females from Sedum species. In combination with this ecological
   difference, COI and 28S barcode data indicate that Flavipanurgus
   kastiliensis stat. nov. should be raised to full species status. The
   male of Flavipanurgus ibericus s. str. is described for the first time,
   and updated keys to Flavipanurgus species are provided. Flavipanurgus
   fuzetus Patiny, 1999 is recorded for the first time from Spain. Further

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are distributed widely in the tropics, where they are
   major pollinators of several plant species. In this study, the karyotype
   of Melipona quinquefasciata Lepeletier, 1836 was analysed, with emphasis
   on the presence of B chromosomes. Post-defecating larvae were analysed
   using Giemsa staining, the C-banding technique, sequential staining with
   fluorochromes, and FISH. The chromosome number ranged from 2n = 18 to 22
   (females) and from n = 9 to 13 (males) due to the presence of 0-4 B

Title = {{Wild bees of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument: richness,
   abundance, and spatio-temporal beta-diversity}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Interest in bees has grown dramatically in recent years in light of
   several studies that have reported widespread declines in bees and other
   pollinators. Investigating declines in wild bees can be difficult,
   however, due to the lack of faunal surveys that provide baseline data of
   bee richness and diversity. Protected lands such as national monuments
   and national parks can provide unique opportunities to learn about and
   monitor bee populations dynamics in a natural setting because the
   opportunity for large-scale changes to the landscape are reduced
   compared to unprotected lands. Here we report on a 4-year study of bees
   in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM), found in
   southern Utah, USA. Using opportunistic collecting and a series of
   standardized plots, we collected bees throughout the six-month flowering
   season for four consecutive years. In total, 660 bee species are now
   known from the area, across 55 genera, and including 49 new species. Two
   genera not previously known to occur in the state of Utah were
   discovered, as well as 16 new species records for the state. Bees
   include ground-nesters, cavity- and twig-nesters, cleptoparasites,
   narrow specialists, generalists, solitary, and social species. The bee
   fauna reached peak diversity each spring, but also experienced a second
   peak in diversity in late summer, following monsoonal rains. The
   majority of GSENM's bees are highly localized, occurring in only a few
   locations throughout the monument, and often in low abundance, but
   consistently across the four years. Only a few species are widespread
   and super-abundant. Certain flowering plants appear to be inordinately
   attractive to the bees in GSENM, including several invasive species.
   GSENM protects one of the richest bee faunas in the west; the large
   elevational gradient, incredible number of flowering plants, and the
   mosaic of habitats are all likely contributors to this rich assemblage
   of bees.}},

Title = {{Along urbanization sprawl, exotic plants distort native bee
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) assemblages in high elevation Andes ecosystem}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Native bees contribute a considerable portion of pollination services
   for endemic as well as introduced plant species. Their decline has been
   attributed to several human-derived influences including global warming
   as well as the reduction, alteration, and loss of bee's habitat. With
   human expansion comes along the introduction of exotic plant species
   with negative impacts over native ecosystems. Anthropic effects may even
   have a deeper impact on communities adapted to extreme environments,
   such as high elevation habitats, where abiotic stressors alone are a
   natural limitation to biodiversity. Among these effects, the
   introduction of exotic plants and urbanization may have a greater
   influence on native communities. In this work, we explored such
   problems, studying the relationship between the landscape and its effect
   over richness and abundance of native bees from the subandean belt in
   the Andes mountain chain. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of
   exotic plant abundance on this high-altitude bee assemblage. Despite the
   landscape not showing an effect over bee richness and abundance, exotic
   plants did have a significant influence over the native bee assemblage.
   The abundance of exotic plants was associated with a relative increase
   in the proportion of small and medium bee species. Moreover, Halictidae
   was the only family that appeared to be favored by an increase in the
   abundance of exotic plant species. We discuss these results and the
   urgent need for further research of high-altitude environments due to
   their vulnerability and high endemicity.}},

Abstract = {{While there is increasing recognition of Batesian floral mimicry in
   plants, there are few confirmed cases where mimicry involves more than
   one model species. Here, we test for pollination by mimicry in Diuris
   (Orchidaceae), a genus hypothesized to attract pollinators via mimicry
   of a range of co-occurring pea plants (Faboideae).
   Observations of pollinator behaviour were made for Diuris brumalis using
   arrays of orchid flowers. An analysis of floral traits in the
   co-flowering community and spectral reflectance measurements were
   undertaken to test if Di. brumalis and the pea plants showed strong
   similarity and were likely to be perceived as the same by bees. Pollen
   removal and fruit-set were recorded at 18 sites over two years to test
   if fitness of Di. brumalis increased with the abundance of the model
   species.
   Diuris brumalis shares the pollinator species Trichococolletes
   capillosus and T. leucogenys (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) with co-flowering
   Faboideae from the genus Daviesia. On Di. brumalis, Trichocolletes
   exhibited the same stereotyped food-foraging and mate-patrolling
   behaviour that they exhibit on Daviesia. Diuris and pea plants showed
   strong morphological similarity compared to the co-flowering plant
   community, while the spectral reflectance of Diuris was similar to that
   of Daviesia spp. Fruit-set and pollen removal of Di. brumalis was
   highest at sites with a greater number of Daviesia flowers.
   Diuris brumalis is pollinated by mimicry of co-occurring congeneric
   Faboideae species. Evidence for mimicry of multiple models, all of which
   share pollinator species, suggests that this may represent a guild
   mimicry system. Interestingly, Di. brumalis belongs to a complex of
   species with similar floral traits, suggesting that this represents a
   useful system for investigating speciation in lineages that employ
   mimicry of food plants.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal dynamics of plant phenology and pollinator abundance across
   seasons should influence the structure of plant-pollinator interaction
   networks. Nevertheless, such dynamics are seldom considered, especially
   for diverse tropical networks. Here, we evaluated the temporal variation
   of four plant-pollinator networks in two seasonal ecosystems in Central
   Brazil (Cerrado and Pantanal). Data were gathered on a monthly basis
   over 1year for each network. We characterized seasonal and temporal
   shifts in plant-pollinator interactions, using temporally discrete
   networks. We predicted that the greater floral availability in the rainy
   season would allow for finer partitioning of the floral niche by the
   pollinators, i.e. higher specialization patterns as previously described
   across large spatial gradients. Finally, we also evaluated how sampling
   restricted to peak flowering period may affect the characterization of
   the networks. Contrary to our expectations, we found that dry season
   networks, although characterized by lower floral resource richness and
   abundance, showed higher levels of network-wide interaction partitioning
   (complementary specialization and modularity). For nestedness, though,
   this between-seasons difference was not consistent. Reduced resource
   availability in the dry season may promote higher interspecific
   competition among pollinators leading to reduced niche overlap, thus
   explaining the increase in specialization. There were no consistent
   differences between seasons in species-level indices, indicating that
   higher network level specialization is an emergent property only seen
   when considering the entire network. However, bees presented higher
   values of specialization and species strength in relation to other
   groups such as flies and wasps, suggesting that some plant species
   frequently associated with bees are used only by this group. Our study
   also indicates that targeted data collection during peak flowering
   generates higher estimates of network specialization, possibly because
   species activity spans longer periods than the targeted time frame.
   Hence, depending on the period of data collection, different structural
   values for the networks of interactions may be found.Synthesis.
   Plant-pollinator networks from tropical environments have structural
   properties that vary according to seasons, which should be taken into
   account in the description of the complex systems of interactions
   between plants and their pollinators in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{One of the renowned and drastically rising research works is developing
   and deploying emerging applications under wireless sensor networks.
   Surveillance monitoring, military and health care industries are some
   examples of emerging applications. Generally, sensor nodes are deployed
   randomly and distributed within the network region. In Wireless sensor
   network, it is hard to increase the network lifetime and to maximize the
   coverage for interest points under certain constraints. A sensor node
   can able to sense only the environmental information within its sensing
   region; hence the deployment of the node must cover the points of
   interests by considering energy of the nodes. To do that, we propose a
   Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) to optimize the locations of the
   sensor nodes and balance the residual energy of the nodes. The FP
   algorithm adjusts the sensor nodes and schedules the node condition
   (Sleep/Active) to maintain target coverage for long period of time. The
   proposed FPA is experimented using a simulation tool and the obtained
   results are verified. From the results it is noticed that the target
   coverage time is increased by 30\% and also the performance is evaluated
   by comparing the obtained results with the existing IWD and ACO
   algorithms. Finally, it is confirmed that the FP algorithm outperforms
   than the IWD and ACO by increasing the energy efficiency 40\% than the

Abstract = {{1 Pan trapping is a common method for sampling wild bees, although the
   use of vane traps is growing globally. Despite this, few studies have
   tested the effectiveness of different coloured vane traps in attracting
   bees among different habitat types, and none exist in the southern
   hemisphere.
   2 The present study sampled 192 sites (108 in wooded habitats and 84 in
   open habitats) within an agricultural region of southern Australia.
   Pairs of coloured vane traps (one blue and one yellow) were placed at
   each site for a period of seven days. Combined, 16 348 individuals were
   collected from four families, comprising 13 genera (21 subgenera) and 55
   species.
   3 Blue vane taps were most effective, sampling six times as many
   individuals as yellow vane traps and 96\% of total species. Their
   effectiveness was consistent among open and wooded habitat types.
   4 The present study highlights the efficacy of vane traps as a passive
   sampling technique for wild bees. An added benefit of this technique is
   that vane traps do not require pheromones or lethal agents.
   5 A systematic sampling method best suited to the research question
   should be incorporated into studies of wild bees. For ecological census
   and population monitoring within multiple habitat types, the present
   study supports the use of blue vane taps as a major component of the
   sampling protocol.}},

Abstract = {{1 Farmland biodiversity has declined over the past few decades. European
   Common Agricultural Policy encourages farmers to set up agri-environment

   2 The present study aimed to assess the ability of bird-strip AES to

   3 The bird strips contained plant species that were either purposely
   sown or established spontaneously. The spontaneous Cirsium species, with
   its high nectar production, offered floral resources that complemented
   those of the sown species Raphanus sativus and Phacelia tanacetifolia.
   Most of the flower-visiting insects considered as pollinators belonged

Abstract = {{Flower flies are one of the most important groups of pollinators
   worldwide. Unfortunately, little is known about their pollination
   capacity and the importance of their role for many crops grown
   commercially, such as cranberries. To address this information gap, 12
   cranberry farms were sampled during the blooming periods of 2013 and
   2014 in Quebec, Canada, to evaluate hoverfly diversity and pollen load.
   Moreover, the effects of the following three factors on community
   structure were investigated: farm management (organic vs conventional),
   edge mowing (mowed vs non-mowed), and type of adjacent natural habitat
   (forest vs meadow vs bog). Flower flies were captured using pan-traps
   and hand-netting once a week for 3 wk. In total 461 specimens of flower
   flies were captured and 33 species were identified. Among the three
   factors studied, edge mowing explained most of the variation among
   communities, followed by farm management. Natural habitat type did not
   appear to influence hoverfly communities, contrary to our expectations
   and reports from other studies. Pollen load analyses and interactive
   connectance plot showed that two flower fly species, Syrphus torvus
   Osten Sacken and Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae), transported
   the most cranberry pollen, both in terms of quantity and proportion.To
   our knowledge, this study is the first to describe and provide a
   complete list of flower fly species found in cranberry crops. Our
   results also highlight the importance of floral resource diversity for
   these potential cranberry pollinators, since edge mowing was revealed to
   be the most influential of all factors we considered.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollination improves the yield and quality of many crops, yet
   there is increasing evidence of insufficient insect pollinators limiting
   crop production. Effective Integrated Crop Pollination (ICP) involves
   adaptable, targeted and cost-effective management of crop pollination
   and encourages the use of both wild and managed pollinators where
   appropriate. In this study we investigate how the addition of honeybee
   hives affects the community of insects visiting oilseed rape, and if
   hive number and location affect pollinator foraging and oilseed rape
   pollination in order to provide evidence for effective ICP. We found
   that introducing hives increased overall flower visitor numbers and
   altered the pollinator community, which became dominated by honeybees.
   Furthermore a greater number of hives did not increase bee numbers
   significantly but did result in honeybees foraging further into fields.
   The timing of surveys and proximity to the field edge influenced
   different pollinators in different ways and represents an example of
   spatial and temporal complementarity. For example dipteran flower
   visitor numbers declined away from the field edge whereas honeybees
   peaked at intermediate distances into the field. Furthermore, no
   significant effects of survey round on wild bees overall was observed
   but honeybee numbers were relatively lower during peak flowering and
   dipteran abundance was greater in later survey rounds. Thus combining
   diverse wild pollinators and managed species for crop pollination
   buffers spatial and temporal variation in flower visitation. However we
   found no effect of insect pollination on seed set or yield of oilseed
   rape in our trial, highlighting the critical need to understand crop
   demand for insect pollination before investments are made in managing
   pollination services. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Abstract = {{Pollinators are integral to global plant biodiversity and

   used a dataset comprising almost 7000 highly taxonomically resolved
   records of tallgrass prairie forbs and flower visiting insects to
   evaluate potential roles of site-scale forb communities as well as the
   composition and configuration of the surrounding landscapes, in
   structuring flower visitor communities. We examined the whole flower
   visitor community and three focal subgroups-bees (the principal
   pollinators worldwide), butterflies (often less efficient pollinators,
   but potentially useful as indicator taxa) and syrphid/bombyliid flies
   (which, as non-bee taxa, are often overlooked). At the site-scale, the
   composition of the entire flower visitor community was significantly
   associated with forb composition, but only bees were significantly,
   positively associated with forb alpha-diversity. Bee, butterfly, and fly
   diversity exhibited taxon-specific relationships with landscape
   composition and configuration. Butterfly richness was positively
   correlated with the combined extent of warm-season grasslands and
   woodlands, whereas bees were associated with the extent of warm-season
   grasslands, only. Bee and fly diversity was higher in landscapes with
   greater grassland edge density, indicating that habitat heterogeneity
   may be beneficial for these taxa. Our work adds to the growing body of
   research indicating that pollinators' responses to floral resources and
   land use in highly modified landscapes are often complex, taxon-specific
   and scale dependent, and our results highlight the importance of
   distinguishing among different types of natural and seminatural lands

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Pollinivory-the consumption of pollen rather than arthropod prey-is a
   defining feature of bees (Anthophila; the flower lovers). In virtually
   all bee species, larvae consume a diet composed of pollen mixed with
   nectar or floral oils. Bees arose from within a group of solitary,
   carnivorous, apoid wasps in the Early to Mid-Cretaceous, coincident with
   the rapid rise of flowering plants. It is assumed that the switch from
   carnivory to pollen-feeding was a key innovation that led to the rapid
   diversification of bees, but this has never been examined empirically.
   Here, we explore the hypothesis that pollinivory led to the increased
   diversification of bees. In contrast to common perception, we find that
   the switch to pollen-feeding per se does not explain their extensive
   diversification. Rather, our results indicate that pollinivory was a
   necessary but not sufficient condition for diversification, and that
   other complementary innovations, such as a broadening of host-plant
   diet, allowed the diversification of the major bee lineages. Our results
   have broad implications for understanding tempo and mode of bee
   diversification dynamics in light of their floral resources.}},

   Here, we investigated the importance of hummingbird pollination in two
   bromeliads from the open restinga vegetation in the Atlantic rainforest,
   with contrasting levels of morphological specialization and differences

   Experimental exclusion of hummingbirds showed that fruit set is

   visit the flowers. Single visitation experiments revealed that in A.
   nudicaulis hummingbirds are more efficient than ants in facilitating
   pollination per visit, but in V neoglutinosa, hummingbirds are as
   efficient as bees and ants. One hummingbird species, Amazilia fimbriata,
   has a pivotal role in the maintenance of ecosystem functionality by

Abstract = {{Hotspots of disease transmission can strongly influence pathogen spread.
   Bee pathogens may be transmitted via shared floral use, but the role of
   plant species and floral trait variation in shaping transmission
   dynamics is almost entirely unexplored. Given the importance of
   pathogens for the decline of several bee species, understanding whether
   and how plant species and floral traits affect transmission could give
   us important tools for predicting which plant species may be hotspots
   for disease spread. We assessed variation in transmission via
   susceptibility (probability of infection) and mean intensity (cell count
   of infected bees) of the trypanosomatid gut pathogen Crithidia bombi to
   uninfected Bombus impatiens workers foraging on 14 plant species, and
   assessed the role of floral traits, bee size and foraging behavior on
   transmission. We also conducted a manipulative experiment to determine
   how the number of open flowers affected transmission on three plant
   species, Penstemon digitalis, Monarda didyma, and Lythrum salicaria.
   Plant species differed fourfold in the overall mean abundance of
   Crithidia in foraging bumble bees (mean including infected and
   uninfected bees). Across plant species, bee susceptibility and mean
   intensity increased with the number of reproductive structures per
   inflorescence (buds, flowers and fruits); smaller bees and those that
   foraged longer were also more susceptible. Trait-based models were as
   good or better than species-based models at predicting susceptibility
   and mean intensity based on AIC values. Surprisingly, floral size and
   morphology did not significantly predict transmission across species. In
   the manipulative experiment, more open flowers increased mean pathogen
   abundance fourfold in Monarda, but had no effect in the other two plant
   species. Our results suggest that variation among plant species, through
   their influence on pathogen transmission, may shape bee disease
   dynamics. Given widespread investment in pollinator-friendly plantings

Abstract = {{To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas
   altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional
   groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes,
   power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional
   plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for
   pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management
   practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity
   translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We
   conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across
   southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to
   decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of
   treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and
   functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of
   understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also
   investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the
   power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on
   species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove
   treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of
   insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed
   contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended
   on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is
   not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive
   species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were
   partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was
   higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from
   precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on
   functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem
   density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy

   emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination

   inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate
   biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove
   treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high

Abstract = {{Bumblebee pollination efficiency is significantly affected by colony
   size, which differs among different bumblebee species. Bumblebee
   colonies are initiated by a single queen; thus queen traits have an
   important influence on colony development. To make better use of native
   bumblebee species and select bumblebee species for commercial rearing,
   queens from four bumblebee species in China, Bombus terrestris, B.
   lantschouensis, B. patagiatus and B. ignitus, were reared and studied to
   determine whether differences in queen traits and colony size occur at
   the interspecific level. In our study, the four bumblebee species
   differed significantly in colony size, queen body length, spermatheca
   size and sperm quantity. The queens of the four species mated only once.
   Among these four bumblebee species, the species with more sperm in the
   queen's spermatheca usually exhibited a larger colony size. The quantity
   of sperm in the queen's spermatheca might serve as an indicator for
   selecting bumblebee species with commercial rearing potential. However,
   our study involved only four bumblebee species; more bumblebee species
   are needed to confirm the correlation between queen sperm quantity and
   colony size.}},

   restoration respond mainly to landscape connectivity}},

Abstract = {{1. Land-use change can disrupt associations between different trophic
   groups, but it is unclear if habitat restoration can recover these
   associations. In Sweden, restoration efforts have been applied to
   increase areas of semi-natural grassland previously remaining as small
   fragments due to abandonment. We assessed how the associations between
   plant and pollinator communities can be modified by grassland
   abandonment and restoration, together with landscape connectivity.
   2. We surveyed plant, hoverfly and bee communities in 10 abandoned, 18
   restored and 10 intact grasslands in south-central Sweden, distributed
   along a gradient of isolation from other species-rich grasslands. We
   assessed the effects of management history and connectivity on the
   relationships between several measures of the composition of plant and
   pollinator communities as well as between plant community composition
   and pollinator guilds.
   3. The composition of the local flowering plant community was an
   important determinant of both hoverfly and bee communities. However,
   plant-pollinator associations were modulated by landscape connectivity
   and, to some extent, by grassland management history. Abundance, species
   richness and functional richness of bees and species richness of
   hoverflies were positively associated with local plant communities in
   isolated grasslands, but these associations weakened in well-connected
   grasslands. In contrast, hoverfly abundance correlated positively with
   plant communities in well-connected grasslands.
   4. The response of pollinator feeding guilds was consistent with overall
   pollinator communities. However, abundance of bees adapted to foraging
   on particular plants (long-tongued and short-tongued) responded
   positively to specific host plant species abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show how land use and
   landscape context can significantly affect interactions between
   different trophic levels. Land use and landscape context should
   therefore be recognised in grassland restoration guidelines. Enhancement
   of both functional-rich and species-rich plant communities, as well as
   increasing abundance and species and functional richness of host plants
   for specialist pollinators will amend pollinator diversity. Restoration
   actions should consider the spatial configuration of the landscape to
   improve its outcome. Efforts in more isolated grasslands should focus on
   promoting local habitat quality while, in more connected grasslands, the
   priority should be maintaining connectivity to well-preserved
   grasslands.}},

Title = {{Contemporary pollen flow as a multiscale process: Evidence from the
   insect-pollinated herb, Pulsatilla vulgaris}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2242-2255}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Understanding the drivers and spatial scale of gene flow is essential
   for the management of species living in fragmented landscapes. In
   plants, contemporary pollen flow is typically modelled as a single
   spatial process, with pollen flow declining exponentially within a short
   distance of mother plants. However, growing evidence suggests that many
   species do not conform to these patterns, often showing an excess of
   long-distance dispersal events or sometimes even multimodality in
   dispersal kernels. This suggests that a single function might be
   insufficient to capture the true complexity of pollination, which in
   reality is often achieved by multiple pollinators that vary in their
   foraging ranges and interactions with the landscape.
   2. We reconstructed realized pollen flow and assessed pollen immigration
   for seven populations of the insect-pollinated herb Pulsatilla vulgaris.
   We quantified the effects of distance, floral resources and landscape
   composition over multiple spatial scales and tested the hypotheses that
   within-population pollen flow is related to resources and landscape
   context measured locally, and that among-population pollen flow is
   related to features measured at larger spatial scales.
   3. We found that pollen flow within populations was more likely to occur
   amongst near neighbours, but that among-population pollen flow was
   random with respect to source populations. We further found that local
   floral density could explain patterns of within-population pollination
   distances and population-level selfing rates, whereas pollen immigration
   rates were best explained by the proportion of forest within a radius of
   500 m around focal populations.
   4. Synthesis. Together, our results suggest that within- and
   among-population contemporary pollen flow may be governed by different
   underlying processes, possibly related to differences in the foraging
   range and habitat use of bee species that contribute to pollination at
   different scales. This highlights the critical need for researchers to
   take a more pollinator-eyed view of contemporary pollen flow in plants
   by (1) recognizing that within- and among-population gene flow by pollen
   may depend on different sets of pollinators that respond to features at
   different spatial scales (2) considering additional factors that may
   alter attractiveness, detectability and accessibility of plants to
   pollinators beyond the effects of distance.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the role of geographical and ecological events associated
   to the divergence process of wild progenitors is important to understand
   the process of domestication. We analysed the temporal, spatial and
   ecological patterns of the diversification of Cucurbita, an American
   genus of worldwide economic importance. We conducted a phylogenetic
   analysis based on six chloroplast regions (5907 bp) to estimate
   diversification rates and dates of divergence between taxa. This is the
   first phylogenetic study to include C. radicans, a wild species that is
   endemic to the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. We performed analysis of
   ancestral area reconstruction and paleoreconstructions of species
   distribution models to understand shifts in wild species ranges. We used
   principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate analysis of variance
   (MANOVA) to evaluate the environmental differentiation among taxa within
   each Glade. The phylogenetic analyses showed good support for at least
   six independent domestication events in Cucurbita. The genus Cucurbita
   showed a time of divergence of 11.24 Ma (6.88-17 Ma 95\% HDP), and the
   dates of divergence between taxa within each group ranged from 0.35 to
   6.58 Ma, being the divergence between C. lundelhana and C.
   okeechobeensis subsp. martinezii the most recent. The diversification
   rate of the genus was constant through time. The diversification of most
   wild taxa occurred during the Pleistocene, and its date of divergence is
   concordant with the dates of divergence reported for specialized bees of
   the genera Xenoglossa and Peponapis, suggesting a process of coevolution
   between Cucurbita and their main pollinators that should be further
   investigated. Tests of environmental differentiation together with
   ancestral area reconstruction and species distribution models past
   projections suggest that divergence was promoted by the onset of
   geographic barriers and secondary range contraction and by expansion
   related to glacial-interglacial cycles.}},

Abstract = {{In spatially heterogeneous environments, coexistence between competing
   species can be facilitated by spatially mediated tradeoffs. In this
   paper we develop a mechanistic model to investigate under which
   circumstances interspecific differences in the tradeoff between foraging
   efficiency and travel costs can allow two central place foraging species
   to coexist in spite of considerable overlap in resource use. One species
   (Flyer) has a high basal metabolic rate, but a low relative cost of
   travelling such that it can use patches at a greater distance from its
   central place while the minimum patch quality it can economically use is
   high. The other species (Forager), by contrast, has a lower basal
   metabolic rate, but higher relative cost of travelling, and can
   therefore be a more efficient forager and able to use foraging patches
   of low quality, as long as they are not too far from the nest. We
   demonstrate that the coexistence of these two species critically depends
   on landscape composition and structure, with the Flyer outcompeting the
   Forager in structurally simple, coarse-grained, landscapes with abundant
   high-quality forage and the Forager outcompeting the Flyer in
   fine-grained highly diverse landscapes. Coexistence between the two
   species is possible when the landscape is structurally and
   compositionally complex, fine-grained, and has both high and low quality
   forage. Our results demonstrate that exploitative competition between
   two contrasting life histories can produce very different community
   dynamics depending on landscape composition and structure.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1657-1669}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mating activities change within a season in many animal and plant
   populations. In plants, selection towards early flowering is commonly
   observed. Pollinator-mediated selection is hypothesized to be a
   pervasive evolutionary force acting directionally on flowering time.
   However, pollinator-mediated mechanisms have rarely been tested in
   realistic field conditions, especially in perennial plants visited by a
   diversity of generalist insect pollinators. We examined pollinator
   visitation in eight Echinacea angustifolia populations in western
   Minnesota, USA, to gauge the potential for pollinator-mediated
   selection. Echinacea is a common prairie perennial that persists in
   isolated remnant populations. Echinacea is self-incompatible and is
   pollinated by a diversity of generalist solitary bees. A previous study
   found that early flowering Echinacea plants have higher seed set and
   their reproduction is less pollen-limited than late flowering plants.
   Twelve times throughout a flowering season, we quantified pollinator
   visitation rates and pollinator community composition. In three sites,
   we also estimated the quality of pollinator visits by examining the
   composition of pollinators' pollen loads brought to Echinacea plants. We
   found that three aspects of pollination dramatically decreased over the
   course of the flowering season. 1) Pollinators visited early flowering
   plants more frequently than late flowering plants. 2) The pollinator
   community was also less diverse late in the flowering season and became
   dominated by a single species of small bee, Augochlorella aurata. 3)
   Pollinators visiting Echinacea late in the season carried proportionally
   less conspecific pollen compared to pollinators visiting Echinacea early
   in the flowering season. Understanding within-season dynamics of
   pollination helps predict the prevalence of inbreeding, phenological
   assortative mating, and reproductive failure, especially in fragmented
   plant populations.}},

Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Many plants that bear hidden or recessed floral nectar experience nectar
   robbing, the removal of nectar by a floral visitor through holes pierced
   in the corolla. Although robbing can reduce plant reproductive success,
   many studies fail to find such effects. We outline three mechanistic
   hypotheses that can explain when interactions between plants and
   nectar-robbers should be commensal rather than antagonistic: the
   non-discrimination (pollinators do not avoid robbed flowers), visitor
   prevalence (robber visitation is rare relative to pollinator
   visitation), and pollen saturation (stigmas receive sufficient pollen to
   fertilize all ovules with one or very few pollinator visits) hypotheses.
   We then explore these mechanisms in the North American subalpine, bumble
   bee-pollinated and nectar-robbed plant Corydalis caseana (Fumariaceae).
   We first confirmed that the effects of nectar robbing on female
   reproductive success were neutral in C. caseana. We then tested the
   three mechanisms underlying these neutral effects using a combination of
   observational studies and experiments. We found evidence for all three
   mechanisms. First, consistent with the non-discrimination hypothesis,
   pollinators failed to discriminate against experimentally robbed flowers
   or inflorescences even though naturally robbed flowers offered
   significantly lower nectar rewards than unrobbed flowers. Second, C.
   caseana was more commonly visited by pollinators than by nectar robbers,
   in accordance with the visitor prevalence hypothesis. Third, stigmas of
   unvisited flowers as well as those visited once by pollinators were
   saturated with pollen, with all stigmas bearing pollen loads several
   orders of magnitude higher than the number of ovules per fruit,
   consistent with the pollen saturation hypothesis. Our investigation of
   the mechanisms driving the commensal outcome of nectar robbing in this
   system deepens our understanding of the ecology of nectar robbing and
   contributes to a more general understanding of the variation in the
   outcomes of interactions between species.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators may influence plant community assembly through biotic
   filtering and/or plant-plant competition and facilitation. The relative
   importance of each process, however, vary according to the scale and how
   strongly plants share their pollinators, and possibly in relation to the
   pollinator groups considered. We here investigated the assembly of three
   Atlantic forest hummingbird-pollinated plant communities across space
   (among all species in the communities) and time, i.e. yearly flowering
   phenology (between pairs of co-flowering species), based on the pairwise
   distances of multiple floral traits (corolla length, anther and stigma
   height, colour and nectar). Because tropical hummingbird-pollinated
   plants are often subdivided in two pollination niches (hermits versus
   non-hermits), we also analyzed these groups separately. We found that
   trait structure across space was clustered for some floral traits,
   suggesting biotic filtering and facilitation. All floral traits had weak
   phylogenetic signal, indicating that closely related species were not
   more similar than distantly related species. Moreover, floral traits
   were randomly structured along the phenology when analyzing all plants
   together. On the other hand, we found similar corolla length but
   divergent anther height in co-flowering pairs within the same
   pollination niche. Thus, plants may benefit from flowering together and
   avoid competition through fine adjustments in reproductive traits. The
   results also suggest that clear signals of competition and facilitation
   among plants are only apparent when species strongly share their
   pollinators and depending on the traits that are considered. Our study
   illustrates a complex interplay of biotic filtering, facilitation and
   competition as processes structuring guilds of plants sharing the same

   success (fruit set) of Platanthera bifolia and Platanthera chlorantha
   and their pollinators in agricultural landscape and woodlands were
   studied. In the years 2014-2016, we observed and caught moths during the
   flowering period of Platanthera species (late June-mid July) in four
   pure P. bifolia, five pure P. chlorantha and nine mixed populations
   under management or no management in Estonia. We determined pollinator
   species richness, pollinator abundance, fruit set and visibility of
   Platanthera plants in each population. We found that pollinator
   assemblages of P. bifolia and P. chlorantha did not differ between
   managed and unmanaged sites. Pollinator abundance had an effect on the
   fruit set of P. bifolia but not on that of P. chlorantha. Presence or

   species richness did not affect the fruit set of either plant species.
   Pollinator abundance was significantly higher in unmanaged populations
   of both plant species but rarefied pollinator species richness was
   higher only in unmanaged populations of P. chlorantha. Based on our
   findings the recommendations for management of semi-natural grasslands
   are to promote larger landscape diversity for the benefit of moth
   abundance by leaving unmanaged patches in different parts of a grassland
   in different years and rotational and post-fruiting management for

Abstract = {{The demand for effective insecticides in pest control with low toxicity

   toxicity of essential oils extracted from Artemisia annua, A.
   absinthium, A. camphorata, A. dracunculus and A. vulgaris against the
   melonworm Diaphania hyalinata (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)

   D. hyalinata and adult forms of S. saevissima and T. angustula.
   Essential oil from A. annua induced a high mortality rate in D.
   hyalinata (96 \%) over a 48 h period. The same essential oil was
   selective for predator S. saevissima (42 \% mortality) and pollinator T.
   angustula (74 \% mortality), while causing high mortality in D.
   hyalinata. The insecticidal activity of A. annua oil was attributed to
   the synergism of its constituents viz., camphor and 1,8-cineole.
   Therefore, this essential oil contains constituents that are promising

Abstract = {{Animal pollination is critical for maintaining the reproduction and
   genetic diversity of many plant species, especially those in tropical
   ecosystems. Despite the threat to pollination posed by tropical
   deforestation, it remains an understudied process. In particular, little
   is known about these dynamics in multi-paternal, successional plant
   species whose fruits can contain substantial genetic diversity. Given
   the importance of successional plants in reforestation, quantifying the
   factors that impact their reproduction is essential for understanding
   plant gene flow in the context of global change. In this study, we
   investigated pollen-mediated gene flow at the multi-paternal fruit level
   to quantify how tropical pollinators navigate and mediate gene flow in
   altered forests. Utilizing microsatellite genotyping and paternity
   analyses, we revealed that distinct plant neighborhood and individual
   factors drive pollen dispersal at the intra-fruit scale. Variance in
   pollen dispersal distances was greater for neighborhoods with higher
   conspecific density, indicating that density dependent reproductive
   patterns play a role at this scale. Additionally, both the diversity and
   evenness of sires mediated by a single pollinator were affected by the
   size of the mother tree, that is, larger mothers received pollen from a
   less diverse, less even pool of sires per fruit. Pollinator body size
   was not found to be a significant driver of pollen dispersal, indicating
   that both small- and large-bodied pollinators were equally important
   pollen dispersers at this scale. By exploring patterns of variation at
   the intra-fruit level, we show that conspecific density and tree size
   significantly impact multi-paternal pollen-mediated gene flow,
   reinforcing the importance of investigating intraspecific,
   intra-individual variance in plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Leaf-cutter bees (genus Megachile Latreille) are among the most common
   and diverse group of bees. However, the identity and taxonomic placement
   of many species are problematic and species identification is often
   difficult. Some species are known only from a single specimen or from
   one of the sexes, and identification keys are not available for many
   groups. We address these taxonomic issues for the subgenera
   Rhyssomegachile Mitchell and Zonomegachile Mitchell, two poorly known
   South American lineages of leaf-cutter bees. We provide comparative
   diagnoses, redescriptions, illustrated identification keys, new
   geographical records, and designate needed neotypes for Megachile cara
   Mitchell, M. gigas Schrottky, M. guayaqui Schrottky, M. reliqua
   Mitchell, M. sanctipauli Schrottky, M. stabilis Mitchell, and M.
   turbulenta Mitchell. We resurrect M. tricosa Cockerell from synonymy
   with M. urbana Smith and synonymize M. turbulenta under M. tricosa. We
   recognize four species in Rhyssomegachile and eight species in
   Zonomegachile. In the latter subgenus, we revalidate M. reliqua from
   synonymy with M. moderata and propose the following four new species:
   Megachile kalina, new species, from French Guiana; M. durantae, new
   species, from Rondonia, Brazil; M. paisa, new species, from Antioquia,
   Colombia; and M. uncinata, new species, from Catamarca, Argentina. We
   confirm sex associations in Zonomegachile and describe its nest for the
   first time. Megachile tricosa, M. ardua Mitchell, and M. tacanensis
   Moure, currently assigned to Rhyssomegachile, exhibit morphological
   features that do not fit any of the known subgenera. Thus, we use a
   cladistic analysis to explore their phylogenetic relationships and
   establish two new subgenera for these species: Aporiochile Gonzalez and
   Engel, new subgenus, for M. tricosa and Chalepochile Gonzalez and Engel,
   new subgenus, for the remaining two species. We provide an updated key

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Question: How does reproductive timing in annual social insects evolve
   under intraspecific exploitation competition and in response to a
   changing environment? The latter includes shifts in resource abundance,
   mortality, season length, and resource peak timing, factors often
   associated with climate change.
   Background: Climate and land use are changing. Evolutionary ecology must
   learn to predict how organisms are affected by, and might adapt to, such
   changes. Classic theory predicts how the timing of reproduction in
   organisms with an annual life-cycle (including many plants and social
   insects) optimally balances their phases of growth and reproduction with
   seasonal resource distributions. But theory has yet to take into account
   interactions within or between species.
   Method: We use invasion analysis to calculate the evolutionarily stable
   reproduction time by extending a classic model of annual social insects
   (such as bumblebees) to include competition for seasonally variable
   resources. There are two types of (colony) production: vegetative
   (workers) and reproductive (queens). The initial worker density in the
   landscape depends on the density of the surviving queens from the
   previous year. Reproduction time is approximated as a sudden (bang-bang)
   switch from vegetative to reproductive production during the season. We
   compare the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) with the classical
   optimization result without competition. We also compare it with the
   strategy that maximizes population size under resource competition.
   Results and conclusions: Under resource competition, the ESS
   reproduction time occurs earlier than the optimum predicted by classic
   theory. But the ESS is later than the strategy that maximizes population
   size. Thus phenological adaptation to environmental change is likely to
   reduce population sizes. Both the ESS and the optimal reproductive time
   change more slowly than do shifts in seasonal resource peaks. Hence a
   growing asynchrony between peak flowering times and the timing of
   bumblebee reproduction - often interpreted as a phenological mismatch -
   may actually be an adaptive response of pollinators in this system.}},

Abstract = {{To date, the endangered terrestrial orchid Codonorchis canisioi was only
   known from two collections at its type locality. This plant has not been
   collected since 1935 and is currently considered as Critically
   Endangered in the Brazilian list of threatened flora. We recently found
   two small populations about 174km from the type locality. We thus seized
   the opportunity to make a complete record of morphological traits,
   aiming to fill the gaps of the short and non-illustrated protologue.
   Plant, flower (including details of column and pollinarium) and fruit
   features are here illustrated and discussed in detail. Overall, plant
   and flower features are similar to those of the widespread Patagonian C.
   lessonii. Yet, both species can be separated by a number of vegetative
   and floral features. Female Augochlorine Halictidae bees were recorded
   as pollinators. Fruits mature quickly (15-19days after pollination).
   Plants wither by middle October, resting underground as very small
   (3-5mm diameter) roundish tubers. The two newly found populations are in
   privately owned areas and prone to both fire and cattle grazing. Due to
   the small size of each population (estimated in less than 200
   individuals), it is likely that this species would still be considered
   as CR (Critically Endangered) when formally and properly surveyed under
   the IUCN criteria. Since plants are small and strongly seasonal, more
   field surveys are necessary to locate other potentially overlooked
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Floral scents attract pollinators to plant rewards; in nectarless
   flowers, pollen grains are the only reward. Thus, pollen not only
   fertilizes ovules, but also feeds pollinators. This dilemma is resolved
   by specialization of anthers (i.e., heteranthery): feeding anthers that
   feed pollinators and pollinating anthers for fertilization. We
   hypothesized that the chemical composition of floral volatiles differs
   between the two types of anther and influences pollination preference
   for feeding anthers. We used Solanum rostratum as a study model because
   its heterantherous flowers produce a floral scent that suggests a close
   association with their pollinators. The main aim of this study was to
   determine the chemical composition of the two types of anther and to
   investigate how they influence foraging behaviour of pollinators. To
   characterize this composition, we used solid phase microextraction and
   hexane extraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We
   registered 12 volatile compounds in S. rostratum floral extracts, mainly
   aromatic and sesquiterpene compounds. The proportion of these compounds
   differed between feeding and pollinating anthers. Some of these
   compounds were probably emitted by osmophores located in both anther
   types. Also, we used electroantennography to investigate Melipona solani
   antennal response to floral volatiles. The M. solani antennae are
   receptive to the highest floral extract dose tested. Finally, we
   conducted two behavioural bioassays to test bee attraction for each type
   of floral extract: a) multiple-choice in a feeding arena using M. solani
   and b) Y-olfactometer bioassay using Bombus impatiens. Both bee species
   preferred feeding anthers in bioassays. In conclusion, heteranthery
   involves chemical differentiation (i.e., proportion of volatiles
   compounds) in anther specialization that influences bee preference for
   feeding anthers over pollinating anthers.}},

Abstract = {{1 Wild bees comprise a diverse group of pollinators essential to healthy
   ecosystems and crop pollination. Despite their importance, the way in
   which many driving factors affect specific bees or pollinators in
   specific regions remains unknown. Northern New England is one such place
   lacking detailed study. Accordingly, we collected bees from three
   different landscape types for three consecutive years in northern New
   England.
   2 Annual, seasonal and landscape factor affects were examined. We found
   that season and landscape type significantly influenced the bee
   community. Bee abundance and species richness were highest during the
   warmer seasons. At the landscape scale, overall bee abundance and
   species richness were greatest in the organic farm landscapes and lowest
   in the meadow landscapes.
   3 We also examined the bee community across multiple taxonomic levels:
   guild, family and species. Wild bee abundance varied significantly
   depending on the taxonomic level analyzed. Within genera, certain
   species had significantly higher abundances in meadow type landscapes,
   whereas other species had higher abundances in the organic or the
   conventional farm type landscapes.
   4 These results support the need for more regionally and taxonomically

Abstract = {{Recent anthropogenic fragmentation has led to population differentiation
   threatening viability of many species, including species specialized on
   mountainous ecosystems. Bombus ephippiatus, a widespread species mostly
   found in mountains in the Neotropics, seems to use the highlands as
   island, and deforested lowland areas may represent barriers to their
   dispersal, leading to isolation and potentially loss of genetic
   diversity. Yet, lack of knowledge of its population structure does not
   allow adequate management and conservation. To fill this knowledge gap,
   we assessed the population structure and inferred dispersion of B.
   ephippiatus in two mountain-ranges in Guatemala (Volcanic Chain and
   Sierra de las Minas). This region is characterized by high topographic
   variation and considerable deforestation strain. We analyzed the effects
   of elevation and land-use on genetic differentiation of B. ephippiatus
   populations and inferred its demography in the region. Our results
   suggest that B. ephippiatus is able to disperse long distances across
   most landscape types, reflected by its high genetic diversity, high
   effective population size, considerable gene flow, low population
   differentiation, as well as the lack of isolation by distance. Hence, B.
   ephippiatus may be a resilient species for the provision of pollination
   services. However, we detected a subtle divergence of B. ephippiatus
   into two clusters, of which Sierra de las Minas has been identified as a
   regional hotspot of genetic and species endemism. Yet, differentiation
   is very recent and hence likely caused by lowland deforestation. The
   combined effects of current forest cover and elevation partially explain
   the observed subtle patterns of differentiation suggesting that the
   maintenance of suitable habitat is crucial to ensure population
   connectivity of this keystone pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Vineyard inter-rows can provide habitats for a range of plant and animal
   species especially when covered with vegetation. However, frequent
   tillage results in the degradation of habitat quality and the provision
   of biodiversity-based ecosystem services. Wild bees are important
   pollinators of crops and wild plants and depend on both, floral
   resources and suitable nesting sites, which are influenced by the
   landscape configuration.
   We examined effects of field and landscape parameters on wild bee
   species' richness, abundance and functional traits in Austrian vineyards
   over two years using Generalised Linear Mixed models, Detrended
   Correspondence Analysis and Random Forests. Alternating tillage was
   compared with no tillage in two inter-rows per vineyard. Forage
   availability in these inter-rows was estimated by flower coverage at
   each sampling date, and landscape features were analysed within a radius
   of 750 m around the vineyards.
   Across all vineyards we found 84 wild bee species with a mean abundance
   (+/- SD) of 29 (+/- 16.6). Forage availability had the strongest
   positive effect on wild bee diversity and abundance. In comparison to no
   tillage, alternating tillage slightly increased wild bee diversity and
   abundance. Eusocial wild bees were more abundant in untilled inter-rows,
   whereas solitary wild bees were more closely associated with alternating
   tilled vineyards. At the landscape scale, the percentage of artificial
   areas (mostly villages) and distance to semi-natural elements raised
   wild bee diversity and abundance. The proportion of woodland increased
   the abundance of wild bees, in particular of eusocial taxa. Solitary
   wild bee abundance was enhanced by the number of solitary trees.
   Pollination provided by wild bees in viticultural areas can be enhanced
   by maintaining a diversity of different soil management strategies to
   improve forage availability in vineyards. Furthermore, semi-natural
   elements such as fallows or solitary trees providing floral resources
   and nesting habitat should be preserved within viticultural landscapes.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 25}},
Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture reduces wild pollinator abundance, diversity and
   pollination services, while depending critically on wild pollinators for
   crop pollination. Floral enhancements such as hedgerows (native,
   perennial flowering trees and shrubs) can enhance pollinator
   colonization, persistence, occupancy, and species richness within
   intensive agricultural landscapes. However, little is known about the
   specific features of hedgerows that promote pollinator communities in
   such landscapes. Understanding how pollinator communities respond to
   local changes in site conditions as hedgerows mature, such as the
   availability of floral or nesting resources, can help guide the design
   of more effective hedgerows that promote pollinators and/or pollination
   services. In an intensively-managed agricultural region of California,
   we found that pollinator community attributes responded principally to
   the enhancement of floral diversity as hedgerows mature, as well as to
   surrounding natural habitat. Once hedgerows matured, this relationship
   leveled off, suggesting either saturation of community assembly
   processes, or greater importance of floral density/display relative to
   diversity. Although we did not find any relationships between measures
   of pollinator community diversity and nesting resources, such resources
   are notably difficult to measure. Surrounding natural habitat also
   affected species and functional richness at hedgerows, particularly for
   solitary bees that nest above ground. Such species are known to be
   particularly sensitive to the negative effects of agriculture. Thus,
   hedgerows in combination with natural habitat may reverse some of the
   community disassembly provoked by intensive agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Genomes of closely-related species or populations often display
   localized regions of enhanced relative sequence divergence, termed
   genomic islands. It has been proposed that these islands arise through
   selective sweeps and/or barriers to gene flow. Here, we genetically
   dissect a genomic island that controls flower color pattern differences
   between two subspecies of Antirrhinum majus, A.m.striatum and
   A.m.pseudomajus, and relate it to clinal variation across a natural
   hybrid zone. We show that selective sweeps likely raised relative
   divergence at two tightly-linked MYB-like transcription factors, leading
   to distinct flower patterns in the two subspecies. The two patterns
   provide alternate floral guides and create a strong barrier to gene flow
   where populations come into contact. This barrier affects the selected
   flower color genes and tightly-linked loci, but does not extend outside
   of this domain, allowing gene flow to lower relative divergence for the
   rest of the chromosome. Thus, both selective sweeps and barriers to gene
   flow play a role in shaping genomic islands: sweeps cause elevation in
   relative divergence, while heterogeneous gene flow flattens the
   surrounding ``sea,{''} making the island of divergence stand out. By
   showing how selective sweeps establish alternative adaptive phenotypes
   that lead to barriers to gene flow, our study sheds light on possible
   mechanisms leading to reproductive isolation and speciation.}},

Title = {{Seasonal dynamics in a cavity-nesting bee-wasp community: Shifts in
   composition, functional diversity and host-parasitoid network structure}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Ecological communities are composed of species that interact with each
   other forming complex interaction networks. Although interaction
   networks have been usually treated as static entities, interactions show
   high levels of temporal variation, mainly due to temporal species
   turnover. Changes in taxonomic composition are likely to bring about
   changes in functional trait composition. Because functional traits
   influence the likelihood that two species interact, temporal changes in
   functional composition and structure may ultimately affect interaction
   network structure. Here, we study the seasonality (spring vs. summer) in
   a community of cavity-nesting solitary bees and wasps ('hosts') and
   their nest associates ('parasitoids'). We analyze seasonal changes in
   taxonomic compostion and structure, as well as in functional traits, of
   the host and parasitoid communities. We also analyze whether these
   changes result in changes in percent parasitism and interaction network
   structure. Our host and parasitoid communities are strongly seasonal.
   Host species richness increases from spring to summer. This results in
   important seasonal changes in functional composition of the host
   community. The spring community (almost exclusively composed of bees) is
   characterized by large, univoltine, adult-wintering host species. The
   summer community (composed of both bees and wasps) is dominated by
   smaller, bivoltine, prepupa-wintering species. Host functional diversity
   is higher in summer than in spring. Importantly, these functional
   changes are not only explained by the addition of wasp species in
   summer. Functional changes in the parasitoid community are much less
   pronounced, probably due to the lower parasitoid species turnover.
   Despite these important taxonomic and functional changes, levels of
   parasitism did not change across seasons. Two network metrics
   (generality and interaction evenness) increased from spring to summer.
   These changes can be explained by the seasonal increase in species
   richness (and therefore network size). The seasonal shift from a
   bee-dominated community in spring to a wasp-dominated community in
   summer suggests a change in ecosystem function, with emphasis on
   pollination in spring to emphasis on predation in summer.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Parameter extraction of solar photovoltaic (PV) models is a typical
   complex nonlinear multivariable strongly coupled optimization problem.
   In this paper, an improved whale optimization algorithm (WOA), referred
   to as IWOA, is proposed to accurately extract the parameters of
   different PV models. The original WOA has good local exploitation
   ability, but it is likely to stagnate and suffer from premature
   convergence when dealing with complex multimodal problems. To conquer
   this concerning shortcoming, IWOA develops two prey searching strategies
   to effectively balance the local exploitation and global exploration,
   and thereby enhance the performance of WOA. Three benchmark test PV
   models including single diode, double diode and PV module models, and
   two practical PV power station models with more modules in the Guizhou
   Power Grid of China are employed to verify the performance of IWOA. The
   experimental and comparison results comprehensively demonstrate that
   IWOA is significantly better than the original WOA and three advanced
   variants of WOA, and is also highly competitive with the reported
   results of some recently-developed parameter extraction methods.}},

   inhibit growth of bee disease-associated microbes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Honey bees are highly prone to infectious diseases, causing colony
   losses in the worst case. However, they combat diseases through a
   combination of their innate immune system and social defence behaviours
   like foraging for health-enhancing plant products (e.g. nectar, pollen
   and resin). Plant secondary metabolites are not only highly active
   against bacteria and fungi, they might even enhance selective foraging
   and feeding decisions in the colony. Here, we tested six major plant
   terpenes and their corresponding acetates, characterizing six natural
   Thymus vulgaris chemotypes, for their antimicrobial activity on bacteria
   associated with European foulbrood. Comparison of the inhibitory
   activity revealed the highest activity for carvacrol and thymol whereas
   the acetates mostly did not inhibit bacterial growth. All terpenes and
   acetates are present in the nectar and pollen of thyme, with pollen
   containing concentrations higher by several orders of magnitude. The
   physiological response was tested on forager and freshly emerged bees by
   means of antenna) electroantennography. Both responded much stronger to
   geraniol and trans-sabinene hydrate compared to carvacrol and thymol. In
   conclusion, bee-forageable thyme product terpenes (mainly from pollen)
   yield effective antibiotic activity by reducing the growth of bee
   disease-associated bacteria and can be detected with different response
   levels by the honey bees' antennae. This is a further step forward in
   understanding the complex pathogen-pollinator-plant network.}},

Abstract = {{The economic value of insect pollination to the world economy is
   tremendous, and pollination service is critical for our food supply and
   persistence of native plants. Little data are currently available on
   pollinator occurrence in the Southern High Plains (SHP) of Texas. Past
   studies on hybrid cottonseed production in the region documented high
   abundance of six species of Agapostemon and lower abundance of Diadasia
   spp., Melissodes spp., and Perdita spp. Historical records indicated the
   presence of Bombus fraternus and B. pensylvanicus which now have
   Endangered and Vulnerable IUCN status respectively. In 2013 and 2014, we
   used blue vane traps and targeted netting to collect insect pollinators
   and anthophiles on the three dominant land uses in the region; cropland,
   Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), and native grasslands. With capture
   methods combined, we collected 74,215 insect specimens; 63\% of the
   specimens were Hymenoptera (289 taxa), 28.61\% were Coleoptera (150
   taxa), 4.48\% were Diptera (115 taxa), 2.34\% were Lepidoptera (60
   taxa), and 1.61\% were of other orders (15 taxa). Our capture included
   all previously documented bee genera, but we did not detect B.
   fraternus. Studies support that blue vane traps are an effective method
   of trapping bees and our results demonstrated that they are also
   effective in attracting some families of anthophilous Coleoptera and
   Diptera. However, we captured several species of Hymenoptera, Diptera,
   and Lepidoptera with aerial nets that we did not capture in blue vane
   traps. This study documents pollinator and anthophile species present in
   a highly altered landscape and is the most comprehensive list of
   pollinators and anthophiles in this region to date.}},

Abstract = {{In 2009 the USDA-NRCS asked the Urban Bee Lab at the University of
   California, Berkeley if urban bee-flower knowledge could be used to
   attract native bees to farms in Brentwood, Contra Costa Co. in Northern
   California. The overarching question was, could native bees play a role
   in supplementing honey bees by providing pollination services for crop
   flowers? If so, how many native bee species were visiting farms and how
   frequently did they occur?
   Eight small farms (4-60 ha) were selected to investigate this question;
   four were control and four were treatment farms where bee habitat
   gardens were constructed. Habitat gardens were stocked with native and
   non-native ornamental plants known to attract native bees (and honey
   bees).
   Bees were monitored yearly in spring at each farm from 2010-2016 to
   evaluate species richness and abundance, which yielded several findings:
   I. Farms near urban areas and a creek were consistently more attractive
   to diverse and abundant bee species
   II. Inconsistent bee garden maintenance and major changes in farm
   operations in other farms resulted in consistently lower measurements of
   bee richness and abundance
   III. Over the seven-year monitoring period, 144 bee species were
   recorded among all farms
   IV. Nearby urban areas had most of the same species as the agricultural
   areas, suggesting a relationship of bees moving between two areas
   V. A total of 23 diverse native bee species were recorded from apple,
   berry, and cherry flowers, and many of them in substantial numbers,
   indicating that native bees were providing pollination services
   Finally, maintaining frequent professional contact with growers was
   considered crucial in conducting research over the long term. These
   contacts were also critical in designing outreach packages to growers
   who expressed interest in applying our native bee findings to their
   farming operations.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on bee-plant interactions are relevant to the understanding of
   temporal patterns in neotropical communities. In isolated habitats such
   as inselbergs little is yet known about the temporal dynamics in the
   availability of floral resources and interacting bee. In the present
   study, the objective is to verify the effect of seasonality on the
   bee-plant interaction in an Atlantic Forest inselberg in southeastern
   Brazil. The bees were sampled monthly in the dry
   (April/2008-September/2008) and wet seasons (October/2008-March/2009)
   using an entomological net. A total of 322 bees of 33 species were
   captured on flowers of 34 species of plants during the year. Bees
   richness was similar between seasons (22 species in the wet season and
   21 in the dry season), but abundance was higher in the wet season (60\%
   of individuals) and higher diversity occurred in the dry season.
   Augochloropsis sp1 were the most abundant species and visited the
   largest number of plant species at each season. In the interaction
   network, plants with the highest degree were distinct between the
   seasons. The number of possible interactions was higher in the dry
   season compared to the wet season and connectance was similar;
   nestedness however varied between the seasons. The composition of plant
   and bees species was distinct between the seasons, as well as the
   interactions between them, mainly due to the alteration in the
   composition of the plant species and the change in the choice of the
   bees for the floral resources between the seasons.}},

   Stenogyne angustifolia: Impending ecological extinction?}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{If an organism becomes rare enough that it no longer participates in
   certain interspecific interactions, it can be said to have become
   ecologically extinct, even though it is still present. This form of
   extinction is much less recognized than global extinctions, although it
   may have ramifications for ecological community function. Here, we
   describe a case of possible or pending ecological extinction of an
   endemic Hawaiian plant. We performed over 120 h of systematic flower
   visitation observations of the endangered Hawaiian mint, Stenogyne
   angustifolia, in its wild habitat. The robust size and open shape of S.
   angustifolia flowers, along with their high accessibility, visibility,
   and nectar content, suggest that they are adapted to animal-mediated
   pollination. However, only one flower visitor was observed at our focal
   high-elevation study site: an individual of the non-native bee species
   Lasioglossum impavidum. Experimental pollination treatments indicate
   that S. angustifolia is self-compatible and demonstrates some autogamy,
   setting fruit and seed in the absence of pollinators. However,
   experimental additions of pollen increased fruit production, indicating
   that plants are pollen-limited and that lack of pollinators carries a
   reproductive cost for this species. Ecological communities throughout
   Hawaii are highly modified, and the distribution and diversity of the
   native pollinator community that occurred with S. angustifolia prior to
   these changes are wholly unknown. Nevertheless, the lack of visitation
   by native pollinators and extremely rare visitation by non-native
   pollinators suggest that this plant is today contributing little to
   pollination networks in its high-elevation habitat. (C) 2018 The

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that food, in particular pollen, limitation is

   species were grown in two different habitat types (dry grassland vs.
   railway embankment) in the Lublin Upland, Poland. We found significant
   inter-species, inter-habitat, and inter-year disparities in the pollen
   mass and total energy amount per unit area. Canonical correspondence
   analysis (CCA) revealed that the blossom cover, species richness, and
   diversity noted at the plant community level significantly influenced
   the distribution of insect visitors to Lamiaceae species. The pollen
   caloric value and pollen abundance (but not the protein content in the
   pollen) had a considerable impact on the abundance and frequency of
   honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees in Lamiaceae flowers.
   Butterflies, beetles and flies did not respond to these factors. The
   model including all variables explained 66.4\% of the observed variance.
   The studied Lamiaceae species, due to abundant flowering and good pollen

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Petunia is endemic to South America grasslands; member of this genus
   exhibit variation in flower colour and shape, attracting bees, hawkmoths
   or hummingbirds. This group of plants is thus an excellent model system
   for evolutionary studies of diversification associated with pollinator
   shifts. Our aims were to identify the legitimate pollinator of Petunia
   secreta, a rare and endemic species, and to assess the importance of
   floral traits in pollinator attraction in this Petunia species. To
   determine the legitimate pollinator, field observations were conducted,
   and all floral visitors were recorded and evaluated. We also measured
   the nectar volume and sugar concentration. To characterize morphological
   cues for pollinators, we assessed the ultraviolet (UV)-light response in
   detached flowers, and characterized the floral pigments and pollen
   volatile scents for four different Petunia species that present
   different pollination syndromes. Petunia secreta shares the most recent
   ancestor with a white hawkmoth-pollinated species, P. axillaris, but
   presents flavonols and anthocyanin pigments responsible for the pink
   corolla colour and UV-light responses that are common to bee-pollinated
   Petunia species. Our study showed that a solitary bee in the genus
   Pseudagapostemon was the most frequent pollinator of P. secreta, and
   these bees collect only pollen as a reward. Despite being mainly
   bee-pollinated, different functional groups of pollinators visit P.
   secreta. Nectar volume, sugar concentration per flower, morphology and
   components of pollen scent would appear to be attractive to several
   different pollinator groups. Notably, the corolla includes a narrow tube
   with nectar at its base that cannot be reached by Pseudagapostemon, and
   flowers of P. secreta appear to follow an evolutionary transition, with
   traits attractive to several functional groups of pollinators.
   Additionally, the present study shows that differences in the volatiles
   of pollen scent are relevant for plant mutualistic and antagonist
   interactions in Petunia species and that pollen scent profile plays a
   key role in characterizing pollination syndromes.}},

   populations. Morph-specific variation in pollinator-mediated selection
   on corolla tube length was detected in the syrphid fly-dominated
   populations. A shorter corolla tube was selected in the L-morph flowers.
   However, similar selective pressure on this trait was not observed in
   the S-morph flowers. These results show that variation in pollinator
   assemblage leads to variation in selection in space and between morphs.
   The findings highlight the potential forces of different pollinator
   agents in driving floral evolution in this primrose species.}},

   bees and syrphids, visited the trees which offer large numbers of

Abstract = {{The cultivated area of pollinator-dependent crops is increasing

   This change in land use is one of the main causes of biodiversity
   losses, of which include wild pollinators. As a consequence, many bee
   species are increasingly being reared and sold specifically for crop
   pollination services. However, the spatial arrangement of colonies of
   managed bee species in crops, as well as the spatial design of plants
   within plantations to maximize pollen flows is not standardized and
   growers are still experimenting. Here, we propose a spatially explicit
   simulation model to test which spatial arrangement of hives and plants
   maximizes pollination services. We used apple orchards pollinated by
   honey bees as a case study. We found that the spatial arrangement of
   plants within plantations affects both the mean level and homogeneity of
   the pollination in apple orchards. Bees' hive locations, on the other
   hand, only affected the mean levels of pollination. Our results showed

Abstract = {{Wild bee populations have undergone declines in recent years across much
   of the Western world, and these declines have the potential to limit
   yield in pollination-dependent crops. Highbush blueberry, Vaccinium
   corymbosum, and tart cherry, Prunus cerasus, are spring-blooming crops
   that rely on the movement of pollen by bees and other insects for
   pollination. Wild bee populations can be increased on farmland by
   providing floral resources, but whether the addition of these plants
   translates into increased pollinator density on crop flowers has not
   been documented in most cropping systems. To determine the importance of
   providing additional floral resources for wild bee pollinator
   communities, we selected blueberry fields and tart cherry orchards with
   and without herbaceous floral enhancements in western Michigan, USA. The
   bee communities visiting crop flowers, enhancements and control grassy
   field margins were sampled over a 5-yr period. In addition, the pollen
   diets of the most abundant wild bee crop pollinators were quantified
   across Michigan to better understand their foraging niches and to
   identify potentially important alternative host plants. The presence of
   floral enhancements did not increase the abundance of wild bees on
   either blueberry or cherry flowers during bloom. The bee community
   visiting blueberry was evenly composed of short-season bees that fly
   only during the spring and long-season bees that fly in both spring and
   summer. In contrast, the bee community visiting cherry was dominated by
   short-season spring bees. The majority of pollen collected by the wild
   bee communities visiting blueberry and cherry was from spring-flowering
   woody plants, with limited use of the herbaceous enhancements.
   Enhancements attracted greater abundance and species richness of bees
   compared to control areas, including twice as many floral specialists.
   Conserving summer-flying, grassland-associated bees is an appropriate
   goal for pollinator conservation programs. However, herbaceous
   enhancements may not provide adequate resources for the wild bees that
   pollinate spring-flowering crops. This study demonstrates that an
   examination of the pollen collected by wild bees across their flight
   periods can identify plant species to help them persist in intensively
   managed landscapes.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{567-577}},

Abstract = {{1. Plants produce antimicrobial phytochemicals that can reduce growth
   and infectivity of parasites in animals. Pollinator parasites are
   transmitted between hosts that forage on shared flowers. Floral
   transmission directly exposes parasites to phytochemicals on floral
   surfaces and in nectar, both at flowers and, post-ingestion, in the
   crop. This exposure could directly affect parasite transmission to new
   hosts. 2. Nectar chemical analyses were combined with field and cell
   culture experiments to test the effects of the floral phytochemical
   thymol on the transmission potential of the trypanosomatid gut parasite
   Crithidia in Bombus impatiens. First, thymol concentrations in Thymus
   vulgaris nectar were measured. Second, the effect of adding thymol to
   floral nectaries on parasite transmission to foraging bees was tested.
   Third, cell cultures were used to determine direct, dose-dependent
   effects of short-term thymol exposure on subsequent in vitro parasite
   growth. 3. A total of 26.1ppm thymol was found in T. vulgaris nectar,
   five-fold higher than previously documented in this species. However,
   addition of thymol to flowers of parasite-inoculated inflorescences of
   four plant species did not affect acquisition of Crithidia infection
   during a foraging bout. Cell culture experiments showed that the thymol
   concentrations needed to reduce subsequent Crithidia growth by 50\%
   (120ppm) were 4.6-fold higher than the highest detected nectar
   concentration. 4. Although thymol exposure can influence Crithidia
   viability, Crithidia are robust to the duration and magnitude of
   exposure encountered during floral foraging under natural conditions.
   These experiments suggest that any effects of thymol alone on
   Crithidia-host infection dynamics probably reflect indirect, possibly
   host-mediated, effects of chronic thymol ingestion.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological shifts have been observed in a wide range of taxa, but the
   fitness consequences of these shifts are largely unknown, and we often
   lack experimental studies to assess their population-level and
   evolutionary consequences. Here, we describe an experimental study to
   determine the fitness consequences of phenological shifts in blue
   orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) emergence, compare the measured seasonal
   fitness landscape with observed phenology in the unmanipulated
   population, and assess seasonal variation in key factors related to
   reproduction, foraging, and brood parasitism that were expected to
   affect the shape of the fitness landscape. By tracking individually
   marked females, we were able to estimate the lifetime fitness impacts of
   phenological advances and delays. We also measured parasitism risk,
   floral resource use, and nesting behavior to understand how each varies
   seasonally, and their combined effects on realized fitness. Survival to
   nesting decreased non-monotonically throughout the season, with a 20.4\%
   decline in survival rates between the first and second cohorts. The
   total reproductive output per maternal bee was 14.9\% higher in the
   second cohort compared to the first, and 161\% higher in the second
   cohort compared to the third. Combining seasonal patterns in survival
   and reproductive output, experimentally advanced females showed 30.6\%
   higher fitness than bees released at the historic peak. In contrast, the
   nesting phenology of unmanipulated bees showed nearly equal numbers of
   nesting attempts in the first two cohorts. Both increased resource
   availability and reduced parasitism risk favored earlier emergence.
   These results are consistent with a population experiencing directional
   selection for earlier emergence, adaptive bet-hedging, or developmental
   constraints. Our study offers insight into the fitness consequences of
   phenological shifts, the mechanisms affecting the fitness consequences
   of phenological shifts in a community context, and the potential for
   adaptive responses to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Climate change is rapidly altering thermal environments across the
   globe. The effects of increased temperatures in already warm
   environments may be particularly strong because organisms are likely to
   be near their thermal safety margins, with limited tolerance to
   additional heat stress.
   2. We conduct an in situ field experiment over 2years to investigate the
   direct effects of temperature change on an early-season solitary bee in
   a warm, arid region of the Southwestern USA. Our field experiment
   manipulates the thermal environment of Osmia ribifloris (Megachilidae)
   from larval development through adult emergence, simulating both
   previous cooler (c. 1950; nest boxes painted white) and future warmer
   (2040-2099; nest boxes painted black) climate conditions. In each year,
   we measure adult emergence phenology, linear body size, body mass, fat
   content and survival.
   3. Bees in the warming treatment exhibit delayed emergence phenology and
   a substantial increase in phenological variance. Increases in
   temperature also lead to reductions in body mass and fat content.
   Whereas bees in the cooling and control treatments experience negligible
   amounts of mortality, bees in the warming treatment experience 30\%-75\%
   mortality.
   4. Our findings indicate that temperature changes that have occurred
   since c. 1950 have likely had relatively weak and non-negative effects,
   but predicted warmer temperatures create a high stress thermal
   environment for O.ribifloris. Later and more variable emergence dates
   under warming likely compromise phenological synchrony with floral
   resources and the ability of individuals to find mates. The consequences
   of phenological asynchrony, combined with reductions in body mass and
   fat content, will likely impose fitness reductions for surviving bees.
   Combined with high rates of mortality, our results suggest that
   O.ribifloris may face local extinction in the warmer parts of its range
   within the century under climate change.
   5. Temperature increases in already warm ecosystems can have substantial
   consequences for key components of life history, physiology and
   survival. Our study provides an important example of how the responses
   of ectothermic insects to temperature increases in already warm
   environments may be insufficient to mitigate the negative consequences
   of future climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.; Ericales: Ericaceae) is an
   important crop grown throughout the eastern United States and Canada.
   Cross-pollination by insects greatly enhances pollination and fruit set
   in highbush blueberry. In Florida, low-chill cultivars that flower
   during the winter when most bees are dormant are used, thus, making it
   difficult to utilize and depend on unmanaged bees. We investigated
   flower visitation rates by managed and wild bees and the subsequent
   berry formation, berry weight, and number of seeds/berry in highbush
   blueberry fields in north-central Florida. Additionally, we tested three
   pollinator treatments: 1) pollinator-excluded flowers, 2)
   open-pollinated treatments that were available to managed and wild bees,
   and 3) flowers that were hand pollinated. Overall, we found seven native
   bee species that contribute to highbush blueberry pollination in
   Florida, but managed honey bees and bumble bees were the main flower
   visitors. Additionally, 14.5 times more blueberries formed in the open
   treatments than in the pollinator exclusion treatments, thus
   illustrating the economic impact bees have on blueberry pollination.
   Most of the wild bees observed visiting blueberry flowers were
   ground-nesting species that need uncultivated areas for nesting
   sites.Therefore, leaving field edges uncultivated and some undisturbed
   habitat may increase native bee numbers within blueberry farms over

   generated a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny and employed
   comparative methods. We found that Galeandra originated towards the end

   diversification and habits in the Neotropics. Shifts in habit impacted
   floral spur lengths and geographic range size, but not climatic niche.
   The longer spurs and narrower ranges characterize epiphytic species,

   0.4-1.3 mg/kg and 11.7-32.3 mg/kg, respectively, and 6.4 mg/kg for

Abstract = {{Parameter estimation is a fundamental research issue which has attracted
   great concern in the control and synchronization of chaotic systems.
   This problem can be mathematically described as a multi-dimensional
   continuous optimization problem through constructing an appropriate
   fitness function, and then solved via meta-heuristic algorithms. A
   hybrid flower pollination algorithm is proposed in this paper for
   solving this problem more efficiently. The proposed algorithm well
   combines the good global exploration ability of the original flower
   pollination algorithm and the powerful local exploitation ability of the
   Nelder-Mead simplex method together by integrating these two methods in
   a very simple way. The experimental results tested on three typical
   chaotic system parameter estimation problems with three unknown system
   parameters, including the Lorenz system, the Rossler system, and the
   Lorenz system under the noise condition, demonstrate that the algorithm
   can estimate the unknown parameters efficiently and accurately. The
   comparisons with the basic flower pollination algorithm and some other
   four reported methods including the quantum particle swarm optimization,
   the hybrid adaptive cuckoo search optimization algorithm, the
   oppositional backtracking search optimization algorithm, and the hybrid
   algorithm combining differential evolution with artificial bee colony
   suggest that the proposed algorithm is energy efficient and superior.
   The proposed algorithm can be used as a new and effective choice for
   parameter estimation of chaotic systems.}},

Title = {{Facilitative interactions among co-flowering Primula species mediated by

Abstract = {{We investigated flowering phenology, pollinator visitation and visitor
   community composition in communities of self-incompatible sympatric
   Primula species in a high-elevation Himalayan ecosystem. Within the
   tight constraints imposed by short growing seasons in such ecosystems,
   interactions among co-occurring plants for pollinators may vary from
   competition to facilitation, depending on the specifics of the system.
   We found that pollinator community composition changed with elevation in
   this system: lepidopterans were the dominant visitors at lower
   elevations (2200-3000 masl), bees (other than bumblebees) dominated at
   mid-elevations (3000-3800 masl) and bumblebees dominated at higher
   elevations (3800-4600 masl). However, within an elevation zone, there
   were no significant differences in pollinators amongst co-occurring
   Primula species. At a focal study site where multiple Primula species
   co-occurred, our results showed that even while the overall flowering
   periods of these species broadly overlapped, the peak flowering periods
   of different Primula species were temporally segregated. Upon further
   inferring the nature of interaction amongst co-flowering Primula
   species, we found that plots with higher Primula diversity (2 species)
   and density (80-100 individuals) experienced significantly higher
   pollinator visitation, compared with plots with single species and low
   flower densities (40-50 individuals). Our results suggest that in this
   community of sympatric, self-incompatible Primula species, a broadly
   aggregated, synchronous floral display of multiple species results in
   pollinator facilitation by attracting a greater number of pollinator
   visitors. Within this broadly synchronous display, the temporal
   segregation of peak flowering period of individual species may reduce
   competition for pollinators and limit heterospecific pollen transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Myristica fatua is a dioecious specialist species restricted to the
   endangered, freshwater Myristica swamp forests in the Western Ghats,
   India. Earlier studies have alluded to pollination by deception in
   members of the Myristica genus, and thus we examined the pollination
   ecology comprising floral biology, flower production, flower visitors,
   and reproductive success in M. fatua and inferred the potential
   strategies that could permit such deception in this habitat specialist
   tree. Male flowers provide pollen rewards for an extended period of time
   while female flowers are rewardless and both sexes are visited by
   generalist insects, mainly by honeybees and stingless bees. Bee visits
   were significantly more frequent and longer on male than on female
   flowers as bees collected pollen from male flowers. We found that flower
   production patterns create a preponderance of males compared to females
   in the swamp populations. Using a model of honeybee color vision, we
   found the distance between the color loci of male and female flowers and
   based on minimum visual angle subtended by these flowers, we suggest
   that the two floral sexes cannot be discriminated by bees. Bees are
   likely deceived by the perceptual similarity of rewardless female
   flowers to pollen-offering male flowers and pollination is the
   consequence of foraging errors made by pollinators that encounter
   largely male-rarely female flower mosaics as they forage among
   clump-distributed M. fatua trees in the swamp habitat.}},

   The operative force of M. macrocarpa was quantified by a digital force
   gauge and the force of three bee species that frequent these flowers was
   estimated from body mass. The operative force was 1.635 +/- 0.146 (mean
   +/- SD) newton (N). This force was far larger than that estimated for
   the largest bee in the study area. In addition, the operative force of
   M. macrocarpa was 16-409 times greater than that of bee-pollinated

Abstract = {{The rewarding orchid Epipactis flava was studied in NW Thailand. Its
   flowers were visited by a wide range of insects, most of which served as
   pollinators. The most frequent pollen bearers were (in decreasing
   order): the cricket Homoeoxipha lycoides, stingless bees of the
   Tetragonula testaceitarsis/hirashimai complex, hoverflies of subfam.
   Syrphinae, the wasp Polybioides gracilis and sweat bees of subfam.
   Halictinae. We found no evidence of a link between the rheophytic habit
   of E. flava and its pollinator fauna. Whereas most pollinators visited
   the flowers to feed on nectar, females of Episyrphus alternans
   (Syrphidae: Syrphinae) were observed to oviposit despite the absence of
   prey for their young. Hence, we suggest that dual pollination systems
   contribute to the opportunist strategy of E. flava, and we discuss, in a
   phylogenetic framework, how the strategy fits in with those previously
   reported for Epipactis sect. Arthrochilium. The elastic attachment of
   the epichile (a universal trait in sect. Arthrochilium) was found to
   promote outcrossing, and we hypothesize that loss of the elastic hinge
   has provided a key innovation facilitating recurrent evolution of
   obligate autogamy in sect. Epipactis (which is nested in sect.
   Arthrochilium).}},

Abstract = {{Sunflower is a pollinator-dependent crop and one of the most cultivated
   oilseeds in the world, supporting important sectors of the agricultural
   industry, such as the food supply, because it is an important source of
   vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids for human health. Although it is
   well established that bee pollination improves sunflower seed set, it is
   still unknown if pollinators influence the nutritional composition.
   Considering the economic importance of sunflowers for several Brazilian
   agricultural sectors, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect
   of the bee community for (1) achene quality (weight and nutritional
   composition) and (2) market value. Exclusion experiments were performed
   with hybrid sunflowers and showed that bee pollination enhanced the
   achene weight by 91\%, the levels of vitamin E by 45\% and unsaturated
   fatty acids by 0.3\%. Also, it was estimated that due to the pollination
   services provided by bees, the grower of the sunflower cultivar used in
   this study nearly duplicates the sale value of the achenes per hectare
   of cultivated area. Thus, the current study highlights the importance of
   bees as providers of cross- and self-pollination to nutritional quality
   of sunflower achenes and provides useful baseline figures to further
   evaluations of the effects of pollinators on human diets and health.}},

Abstract = {{While some studies have shown that ants that visit extrafloral nectaries
   may defend their host plants against potential herbivores, recent
   researches have shown that such ant-plant mutualism may be broken in
   some cases. For example, the presence of ants on plants could also drive
   away pollinators and seed dispersers. However, it is not yet known what
   mechanisms could favor that ant presence on plants does not affect other
   mutualistic interactions involving plants. In this work, we performed a
   series of field experiments to test the hypothesis that the presence of
   ants on EFNs located at the base of the inflorescences of Vigna luteola
   (Fabaceae) may have a negative effect on non-pollinators but not on
   pollinators in a Mexican coastal sand dune. In general, we found that
   the presence of ants on the plants decreased the rate of flower
   visitation. However, we observed that the time of visitation of the
   pollinator, the bee Megachile (Pseudocentron) sp. on the flowers was
   less compared to non-pollinators. This strategy may allow that ants
   cannot aggressively scare away the pollinator. In summary, we show that
   the pollinator of V. luteola present strategies that allow them to visit
   the flowers without being aggressively attacked by the ants that visit
   the extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). Therefore, the presence of ants on
   plants could have a dual function: protecting plants against potential
   herbivores as well as, filtering flowers against nectar thieves.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is suggested to be one of the possible drivers of decline

   modeling distributional responses in face of climate changes for the

   divided into two subspecies based on difference in the yellow tergal
   stripes, which are continuous in M. q. quadrifasciata and interrupted in
   M. q. anthidioides. The geographic distribution of each subspecies is
   also distinct. M. q. quadrifasciata is found in colder regions in the
   Southern states of Brazil, whereas M. q. anthidioides is found in
   habitats with higher temperatures, suggesting that ecological features,
   such as adaption to distinct climatic conditions may take place. Thus,
   the possibility of having different responses in geographic range shifts
   to future climate scenario would be expected. This study aimed to
   investigate the effects of climate changes on the distribution of the
   two M. quadrifasciata subspecies in Brazil, using an ecological niche
   model by the MaxEnt algorithm. Our results indicate that the subspecies
   showed clear differences in geographic shift patterns and increased

   have the potential for an increase of suitable climatic conditions in
   the Atlantic Forest, and towards the Pampa biome, while M. q.

   the city. Also, relative abundances of species have changed, notably
   with the increase of social bees. Large bees that nest in cavities have
   also increased relative to small bees that nest in the ground. These

Abstract = {{Bumblebees (genus Bombus Latreille) are pollinator insects of great

   For this purpose, comparative analyses were carried out between B. t.

   addition, we compiled data on composition and diversity from another bee
   assemblage located in the same portion of the Cerrado, which was
   previously investigated by one of us almost 30 years ago, in order to
   produce a more complete panorama on beta diversity of bees in this
   region. We used a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination
   analysis (NMDS) to compare composition of bee assemblages from different
   types of open vegetation. We recorded 77 bee species (H' = 2.95; J =
   0.68), 42\% of them were singletons. We collected slightly more than
   half of the species and 60\% of the genera recorded in the bee
   assemblage studied three decades ago. H' was significantly lower in our
   area than in the previous study (t = 8.588, p <0.001), but equitability
   (J) was very similar. Several factors may contribute to these
   differences, including local differences in bee assemblage composition,
   differences in the probability of capturing the different species (many
   rare species), factors affecting the sampling itself, and perhaps
   species loss over the three decades separating the two studies. The
   magnitude of species loss is difficult to assess because the two studies
   were not carried out exactly in the same area and there were differences

   Vienna (Austria). Insect sampling occurred from May until July 2015
   every two weeks parallel to the vegetation surveys incl. records of the
   cover of flowering plants. In each location patches of semi-natural
   grassland as well as flowering strips within vineyards were
   investigated. We found a significant correlation between the number of
   insects or insect taxa (especially for Hymenoptera) and the current
   flower cover. In some cases flowering strips in vineyards harbor higher
   numbers of insects and higher diversity of bee species than the
   semi-natural grassland due to temporarily higher values of flower cover.
   However, grassland patches provide a much more constant supply with
   nectar producing plants replacing each other in their flowering phase
   during the season. In contrast, flowering strips are often dominated by
   one or a few short-lived sown plants, which is of advantage for some
   oligolectic bees specialized on Brassicaceae or Fabaceae. Flowering
   strips within organically farmed vineyards are more similar to
   semi-natural grassland regarding the diversity of flower visiting
   insects than to conventionally farmed vineyards.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate taxonomic delimitation in ecological research is absolutely
   critical as studies that seek to evaluate levels of biodiversity and
   quantify human effects on the environment are rapidly undertaken.
   Coloration is a widely used morphological character for species
   identification through dichotomous keys. However, taxonomic
   identification based upon coloration is often unreliable because this
   character can exhibit high degree of intraspecific variation. An
   uncertain interpretation of mesosoma color-morphs (yellow or black)
   occurred when we used this character, in association with the bristle
   bands in the TII, for the identification of eucerine bee Melissodes
   nigroaenea (Smith), an important pollinator of cotton fields in South
   America. Thus, we used a DNA barcoding approach to investigate if
   different color morphs within this species reflected two distinct
   evolutionary lineages. Our Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction revealed
   that both yellow and black individuals clustered in a highly supported
   monophyletic group. Additionally, pairwise genetic distances between M.
   nigroaenea color-morphotypes were lower than 3\%. These results indicate
   that both mesosoma color-morphs correspond to intraspecific variability
   within the same evolutionary unit. Although the mesosoma coloration is
   not the unique character considered for taxonomic differentiation among
   Melissodes species, our results indicate that this character is not
   reliable for Melissodes species differentiation. The incorporation of
   DNA barcoding approaches to taxonomic classification can help resolve
   some of the problems that originate while relying on purely
   morphological taxonomy.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture driven landscape changes have caused worldwide forest loss
   and fragmentation, severely affecting biodiversity and ecosystem
   services, amongst which pollination is remarkably important. Bees are an
   essential pollinator group for forest plant populations and food
   production in tropical landscapes. They are also dependent on forested
   environments which are essential to maintaining their diversity and
   pollination services. We analysed bee diversity in forest patches and
   adjacent open areas to evaluate if bees can use complementary
   environments in heterogeneous altered tropical landscapes. The effect of
   landscape level heterogeneity and forest amount on bee diversity was
   also assessed. Our hypothesis was that bee communities will be richer
   and more diverse in highly forested and heterogeneous landscapes when
   compared to areas dominated by few human-made environments, but due to
   supplementary foraging behaviors, they will be more abundant in open
   areas where flower availability is higher. We actively sampled bees
   visiting flowers within forest patches and in surrounding open areas
   between the Cantareira and Mantiqueira mountain ranges in Sao Paulo,
   Brazil. We found both higher bee richness and diversity in open areas
   than in forest patches, partially denying our initial hypothesis but
   supporting that bees are more abundant in open areas. We found strong
   indication that landscapes with a higher amount of forest and
   environmental heterogeneity can provide more resources for bees through
   resource complementation processes, maintaining their diversity in the
   landscape. The presence of forest patches close to crop and open areas
   is of utmost importance for the conservation of bees and pollination
   services with important consequences for land management in tropical

Abstract = {{Some solitary bees establish their nests in preexisting cavities. Such

   sex ratio, mortality and parasitism, in two phytophysiognomies:
   herbaceous-shrub restinga (site 1) and arboreal restinga (site 2). We

   abundant species. Large straws were significantly more occupied than
   small straws (chi(2) = 19.951; df = 1; p < 0.0001). Offspring mortality
   rate for unknown reasons was significant different between sites, 11\%

   mortality and parasites attack rates seem to be the more distinctive
   aspects between the herbaceousshrub and arboreal restinga sampled. Our

   important nesting sites for the maintenance of bee populations, some of

   region is missing. In this study, the floral visitors of M. annua were

   in Jalisco, Mexico. Our aim was to provide information of the breeding
   system of M. annua and then indicate the potential pollinators. We
   included morphological and sexual features to estimate the outcrossing
   index (OCI). The frequency, behavior, and pollen loads were considered
   to find the potential pollinator. Despite the evidence of protandry and
   OCI indicating a xenogamous breeding system, the lack of herkogamy
   suggests M. annua is a facultative xenogamous species. The highest
   frequency of visits corresponded to the maximum diameter of corolla.
   Euglossa viridissima Friese was the most recurrent visitor. However,
   this species often carried a high proportion of heterospecific pollen
   and did not touch any sexual structure of the flower. In contrast,

   of energy to those foragers capable of reaching the nectaries, though
   small bees are apparently unable to penetrate the flowers. We consider

Abstract = {{Maintaining biodiversity in urban landscapes requires a well-functioning
   green infrastructure for the landscape to remain ecologically
   functional. However, city planners often lack knowledge to identify how
   well different parts of the green infrastructure are connected, and
   tools to estimate the accessibility to important habitats for different
   species in urban areas are strongly needed. We compared the ability of
   three measures of available food resources, with increasing complexity,
   for explaining species richness and abundance of bees and wasps at 23
   locations in an urban landscape in Sweden. Specifically, we tested (1)
   the summed amount of food habitat within a buffer circle, (2) the amount
   of food habitat weighted by distance, and (3) the summed amount of food
   habitat within an area created by cost-weighted distance based on the
   surrounding landscape friction. We tested two spatial scales (200 and
   400 m). The results show that both the summed (1) and the weighted
   measures (2) were very poor in explaining species richness and abundance
   regardless of spatial scale, while we found significant relationships
   for both species richness and abundance with the friction-based measure
   (3) at both scales. For the friction-based measure, the relationships
   with both response variables were strongest at the smallest spatial
   scale (200 m). We conclude that bees and wasps are sensitive to barriers
   such as large roads and built-up areas when foraging in urban
   environments. This is important to consider when assessing the

   the available amount of habitat and how well different parts of the

Abstract = {{The phenology of many ecological processes including pollination service
   is modulated by surface air temperature, making them potentially
   sensitive to climatic change. The Japanese hornfaced bee, Osmia
   cornifrons (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), was introduced into the USA in
   the 1970s and has been used as a key pollinator of spring blooming fruit
   crops such as apple and blueberry. This study examined the effects of
   future climate change on three key phenological events of O. cornifrons:
   date for adult emergence (female and male) in spring, date for
   completion of egg and larval development, and duration for the
   development in the Eastern USA. We used daily temperature data obtained
   from 21 models in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 for
   2006-2100 under the two future climate scenarios of Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5). We estimated the Julian dates
   (JDs) of spring emergence and development of O. cornifrons using the
   phenological parameters derived from temperature-dependent biophysical
   models. The JDs for the bee emergence and development are projected to
   be significantly advanced in the Eastern USA under the RCP 4.5 and 8.5
   scenarios. The number of days for bee development is projected to be
   longer in the southern region (+0.57days/decade) and shorter in the
   central (-0.27days/decade) and northern (-0.65days/decade) regions of
   the Eastern USA (all the p values <0.01). The significantly longer
   duration of bee development under future climate change could pose a
   risk to the bee due to the longer period of being exposed to its pests.
   Implications for management of O. cornifrons population were discussed

Abstract = {{As concern about declining pollinator populations mounts, it is

   three years in two habitats at Badlands National Park, South Dakota,

   sparse vegetation (May-October samples; N = 74 surveys) and 12 in

   Insects contacting reproductive parts of flowers were netted, placed

   was removed from insect bodies with fuchsin jelly cubes which were then
   mounted on microscope slides for identification. The probability of taxa
   transporting only conspecific pollen (with respect to the plant species
   upon which it was collected), mixed pollen, only non-conspecific, or no
   pollen was estimated with multinomial logistic regression. Bees were the
   most commonly captured flower visitor and carried by far the most pollen
   (females >10x as much as males), but they were most likely to carry
   mixed pollen loads. Flies, beetles, and wasps were also common flower
   visitors and beetles were most likely to carry only conspecific pollen.
   Ants and diurnal lepidopterans were unlikely to carry any pollen. Bees,

Abstract = {{Temperature is a major driver of biological phenomena, from metabolism

   investigate the effect of experimental manipulation of environmental
   temperatures on the individual mortality and phenotypic composition of
   colonies of Melipona interrupta. To fulfill these objectives, 30
   colonies in equivalent developmental conditions were artificially
   subjected to different temperatures. Temperatures were monitored by
   thermo-hygrometers, and immature mortality and sex and caste ratios were
   observed in brood combs during 14months. A strong effect of external
   temperature on immatures was detected on deviations from 28 to 30
   degrees C (the natural average temperature inside the colony), causing
   an increase in mortality. Likewise, a significant effect of temperature
   on sex ratio was detected, with male:female ratio decreasing at
   temperatures below and above 28-30 degrees C. Lastly, there was no clear
   evidence for an effect of temperature on caste ratio, although queens
   appeared to become relatively more frequent at warmer temperatures. The
   results of this study allow us to conclude that anthropogenic changes,

Abstract = {{1. In flowers with poricidal anthers, pollen is not freely accessible
   and legitimate access is restricted to bees capable of vibrating the
   anthers. Despite the protection of pollen provided by poricidal anthers,
   numerous illegitimate, non-buzz-pollinating flower visitors rob pollen.
   2. We aimed to quantify the influence of functional groups of floral
   visitors and illegitimate interactions on the network structure to
   disentangle the flower visitor network into its mutualistic and
   antagonistic components.
   3. We delimited three functional groups of bees based on their pollen
   collection behaviour in poricidal flowers: large bees that vibrate
   entire flowers in a single buzzing position (flower buzzing), bees
   vibrating single anthers in different positions (anther buzzing) and
   non-vibrating flower-damaging or gleaning bees (non-buzzing). Moreover,
   we characterized legitimate and illegitimate interactions of
   co-occurring and co-flowering plants and their flower visitors based on
   the stigma contact during a visit. Since we independently assessed the
   type of interaction with bee-plant species combinations, we were able to
   include the behavioural variations of each bee species across different
   flowers.
   4. The networks were modular, with stronger interactions within subsets
   of species than among the subsets. All modules included a combination of
   flower-, anther- and non-buzzing bees, and mutualistic and antagonistic
   networks were intermingled. Seven bee species shifted their roles across
   plant species. Specialization in the subset of interactions with
   pollinators was higher than the overall visitation network.
   Flower-buzzing bees were more specialized than anther-buzzing and
   non-buzzing bees, which used virtually all poricidal flowers similarly.
   5. Although plants with poricidal anthers shared a specialized mechanism
   of pollen release, their pollinators were highly dissimilar and formed
   compartments of interacting species. The interaction-level approach
   taken in our study confers a high specificity to the pollinator network,
   leading to a more complex and realistic picture of mutualistic webs
   versus its embedded florivory, which are otherwise confounded in pooled
   networks across flower visitors.}},

   miyabeana is pollinated by occasional visits of small bees, but it is
   also self-compatible and spontaneous selfing is possible. Although its
   pollination is shaped by abiotic environmental factors, D. miyabeana can
   reproduce in different habitat conditions. These flexible reproductive
   systems may be an advantage in coping with the recent environmental
   change in forest habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Mermithid nematodes (Nematoda: Mermithida: Mermithidae) parasitize a
   wide range of both terrestrial and aquatic invertebrate hosts, yet are
   recorded in bumble bees (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus) only six
   times historically. Little is known about the specific identity of these
   parasites. In a single-season nationwide survey of internal parasites of
   3646 bumble bees, we encountered six additional instances of mermithid
   parasitism in four bumble bee species and genetically characterized them
   using two regions of 18S to identify the specific host-parasite
   relationships. Three samples from the northeastern USA are
   morphologically and genetically identified as Mermis nigrescens, whereas
   three specimens collected from a single agricultural locality in the
   southeast USA fell into a clade with currently undescribed species.
   Nucleotide sequences of the V2-V6 region of 18S from the southeastern
   specimens were 2.6-3.0\% divergent from one another, and 2.2-4.0\%
   dissimilar to the nearest matches to available data. The dearth of
   available data prohibits positive identification of this parasite and
   its affinity for specific bumble bee hosts. By doubling the records of
   mermithid parasitism of bumble bee hosts and providing genetic data,
   this work will inform future investigations of this rare phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{With plants whose flowers open at night and stay open during the day,
   nocturnal pollinators may exploit floral resources before diurnal
   competitors. Moths, bats, and beetles are the most familiar nocturnal
   pollinators, whereas nocturnal bees as pollinators remain poorly
   understood. The common Cerrado tree Machaerium opacum (Fabaceae) has
   white and strongly scented melittophilous flowers, which first open at
   the night and remain open during the day and, thus, have the potential
   to be visited by both nocturnal and diurnal bees. We asked: (1) what is
   the plant's breeding system? (2) when during the night do the flowers
   open? (3) what are the visual and olfactory floral cues? and (4) which
   nocturnal/diurnal bees visit and pollinate the flowers? We show that M.
   opacum is self-incompatible. Its flowers open synchronously at 03:30h,
   produce nectar exclusively at night, and have an explosive mechanism of
   pollen presentation. The flowers have pure white petals, release strong
   scents during anthesis, and are pollinated by nocturnal and diurnal
   bees. We recorded four nocturnal and 17 diurnal species as flower
   visitors, with females of nocturnal species of Ptiloglossa (Colletidae)
   being the most abundant. After an initial pollen-releasing visit, only a
   minor amount of pollen remains in a flower. Several floral traits favor
   visits by nocturnal bees: (1) night-time flower opening, (2) nectar
   production at night, (3) almost complete pollen release during the first
   flower visit, and (4) pure white petals and strong odor production prior
   to sunrise, facilitating visual and olfactory detection of flowers when
   light is dim.}},

Abstract = {{Among associations of plants and their pollinating bees, mutually
   specialized pairings are rare. Typically, either pollen specialist
   (oligolectic) bees are joined by polylectic bees in a flowering species'
   pollinator guild, or specialized flowers are pollinated by one or more
   polylectic bees. The bee Andrena astragali is a narrow oligolege,
   collecting pollen solely from two nearly identical species of death
   camas (Toxicoscordion, formerly Zigadenus). Neurotoxic alkaloids of
   these plants are implicated in sheep and honey bee poisoning. In this
   study, T. paniculatum, T. venenosum and co-flowering forbs were sampled
   for bees at 15 sites along a 900-km-long east-west transect across the
   northern Great Basin plus an altitudinal gradient in northern Utah's
   Bear River Range. Only A. astragali bees were regularly seen visiting
   flowering panicles of these Toxicoscordion. In turn, this bee was never
   among the 170 bee species caught at 17 species of other prevalent
   co-occurring wildflowers in the same five state region (38,000 plants
   surveyed). Our field pollination experiments show that T. paniculatum is
   primarily an outcrosser dependent on pollinator visitation for most
   capsule and seed set. Thus, both A. astragali and two sister species of
   Toxicoscordion are narrowly specialized and co-dependent on each other
   for reproduction, illustrating a rare case of obligate mutual
   specialization in bee-plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The use of timber harvest residue as an energy source is thought to have
   environmental benefits relative to food-based crops, yet the ecological
   impact of this practice remains largely unknown. We assessed whether the
   abundance and diversity of wild bees (Apoidea) were influenced by the
   removal of harvest residue and associated soil compaction within managed
   conifer forest in western Oregon, USA. We sampled bees over two years
   (2014-2015) on study plots that were subjected to five treatments
   representing gradients in removal of harvest residue and soil
   compaction. We collected >7,500 bee specimens from 92 distinct
   species/morphospecies that represented five of the seven bee families.
   We trapped 3x more individuals in the second year of the study despite
   identical sampling effort in both years, with most trapped bees
   classified as ground-nesting species. Members of the sweat bee family
   (Halictidae) comprised more than half of all specimens, and the most
   abundant genus was composed of metallic green bees (Agapostemon,
   33.6\%), followed by long-horned bees (Melissodes, 16.5\%), sweat bees
   (Halictus, 15.9\%), and bumble bees (Bombus, 13.6\%). In both years,
   abundance and observed species richness were greatest in the most
   intensive harvest residue treatment, with other treatments having
   similar values for both measures. Our study indicates that early
   successional managed conifer forest that has experienced removal of
   harvest residue can harbor a surprising diversity of wild bees, which
   are likely to have important contributions to the broader ecological
   community through the pollination services they provide.}},

Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Pollen limitation can strongly influence reproduction of
   pollinator-dependent plants. Flower abundance can affect pollination
   `quantity' and `quality' due to its influence on pollen availability and
   foraging patterns of pollinators, ultimately impacting on seed
   production. We complemented individual-based measurements with
   landscape-level metrics to assess the influence of conspecific flower
   availability at different spatial scales on the quantity and quality
   components of pollination, and their impact on seed production in the
   invasive shrub Cytisus scoparius. In 2013-2014, we sampled 40 C.
   scoparius populations in Nahuel Huapi National Park, Patagonia
   (Argentina). In each population, we estimated the proportion of tripped
   flowers, fruit- and seed-set in five randomly selected individuals. The
   proportion of tripped flowers and the proportion of them setting fruit
   were used as proxies of pollination quantity and quality, respectively.
   Conspecific flower availability at distinct spatial scales (5-1000 m)
   was estimated as the area covered by flowering C. scoparius from color
   aerial photographs. Flower availability influenced seed output due to
   contrasting scale-dependent effects on pollination quantity and quality.
   Increasing flower availability at the landscape-scale reduced
   pollination quantity, whereas at the neighborhood-scale it increased
   pollination quality. The overall positive effect of flower availability
   on seed output at the neighborhood scale was slightly higher than the
   overall negative effect at the landscape scale. Moreover, pollination
   quality had a higher positive effect on seed output than pollination
   quantity. Our results demonstrate that pollination quality may severely
   limit plant reproduction. Pollination quality limitation can act
   independently of pollination quantity limitation because these factors
   operate at different spatial scales.}},

Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{While introduced plants often have restricted distributions at high
   elevations, their impacts may be more extensive if they compete for
   native pollinators, potentially reducing pollinator services to native
   biotically pollinated plants. Conversely, introduced biotically
   pollinated plants might facilitate improved pollinator services to
   native plants by supporting higher pollinator densities and extending
   the flowering season. We examined weekly pollinator visitation to native
   and introduced plants, at five elevations over two flowering seasons on
   The Remarkables range, south-central South Island, New Zealand. In this
   area, introduced plants dominate the vegetation at lower elevations but
   are restricted to disturbed areas above treeline. We tested whether
   pollinator visitation rates and quantities of introduced pollen on
   insects or transferred to native flowers differed with elevation and
   community context, or with the local abundance of introduced flowers
   regardless of elevation. Introduced biotically pollinated plants
   produced more flowers and flowered later than most native species and
   were extensively utilised by native solitary bees. Weekly visitation
   rates to native flowers were higher in the first half of the flowering
   season than the second half, and were positively correlated with
   visitation rates to co-occurring introduced flowers. Introduced flower
   abundance did not affect visitation to native flowers but did
   significantly predict the occurrence of introduced pollen on native
   insects and stigmas of native flowers. Pollen contamination was also
   higher in the latter part of the flowering season. While an increase in
   introduced flowers at high elevations may benefit native pollinators by
   increasing the quantity and duration of floral resources available, the
   heavy use of introduced flowers by native bees will lead to at least
   localised stigma contamination, particularly for late flowering species.
   However, more information is required on foraging ranges of native
   pollinators and pollen limitation in native species to understand the
   consequences of introduced species expansion into alpine areas.}},

   the principle of parsimony and intrinsic unitary consistency from start

   flying). We also analysed the amino acid content of haemolymph sampled
   from an additional 45 bees fed the same diets (15 per diet type). Bees
   fed with -alanine had a significantly shorter survival time than those
   fed with the control and GABA diets. The GABA diet induced higher levels

   significance using Wilcoxon rank sum test (b) computational time
   complexity (c) convergence rate of algorithms. Experimental results and
   analysis revealed that ABC algorithm perform best for majority of the
   problems on high dimension, while on small dimension, CS is the best

Abstract = {{Shrub willow has potential to be a substantial source of renewable
   biomass for production of bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts. At the
   same time, scientists and land managers are increasingly challenged to
   achieve multiple ecosystem functions in bioenergy plantings. Due to
   willow's early-season bloom period, a time when natural forage for bees
   can be limited, biomass plantings offer a potential benefit of floral
   resources for pollinators, some of which are known to be experiencing
   recent declines. To assess which willow cultivars and sex may provide
   the most benefit to pollinators, we conducted a common-garden experiment
   (Northeast U.S.) comparing bee (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) visitation
   among seven pedigrees and both sexes of short rotation coppice willow.
   We quantified abundance, richness, diversity, evenness, and species
   composition in plots planted with each pedigree and sex. Over seven
   sampling dates, we found an abundant and diverse bee assemblage
   comprised of 4675 individuals representing > 56 species, at least 10 of
   which are rare or in decline in the northeastern United States. Willow
   sex was an important factor in bee visitation differences, with male
   willows supporting 39\% greater abundance, 20\% greater richness, and
   9\% greater diversity of bee visitors. Greater bee richness and
   diversity on male willows was due to an abundance-driven accumulation of
   species, as determined via rarefaction. Ordination analyses indicated
   composition of bee species assemblages differed among both willow
   pedigree and sex. Thus, our findings suggest male willow of varying
   pedigrees may be optimal for strategic plantings intended to meet
   bioenergy goals while also benefiting pollinators.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{In Europe, the surface devoted to sunflower cultivation has expanded by
   similar to 26\% from 2006 to 2016. Theoretically, this implies an
   increasing demand for pollinators, while at the same time, scientific
   reports claim that pollinator communities worldwide are threatened by
   multiple stressors such as agrochemicals, the loss of suitable habitats
   and habitat fragmentation. However, the question that arises is whether
   insect pollination is still relevant for modern sunflower varieties that
   are often highly self-fertile. Following recent studies which
   demonstrate that surrounding land use composition may affect ecosystem
   service provisioning in cropped fields, this study aims at re-examining
   the pollination status of sunflower while disentangling the effects of
   local and landscape variables on sunflower seed set and oil content in
   Central Italy. Commercial cultivars, regardless of their degree of
   self-fertility, showed increased seed set and oil content when receiving
   adequate amounts of cross-pollination; oil composition, though, was not
   affected by cross-pollination events. Honey bees accounted for the vast
   majority of pollinators ensuring an overall adequate pollination.
   Sunflower seed set was higher in fields surrounded by landscapes
   containing a greater abundance of beehives, early flowering crops, urban
   areas and woody linear elements; conversely, seed set was lower where
   herbaceous semi-natural habitats dominated the surrounding landscape.
   This information is necessary for a science-based planning of
   agricultural policies and shows that, despite the adoption of
   self-fertile cultivars, sunflower still benefits from insect pollination
   and land use planning may affect crop productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Crop domestication can lead to weakened expression of plant defences,
   with repercussions for herbivore and pathogen susceptibility. However,
   little is known about how domestication alters traits that mediate other
   important ecological interactions in crops, such as pollination.
   Secondary metabolites, which underpin many defence responses in plants,
   also occur widely in nectar and pollen and influence plant-pollinator
   interactions. Thus, domestication may also affect secondary compounds in
   floral rewards, with potential consequences for pollinators. To test
   this hypothesis, we chemically analysed nectar and pollen from wild and
   cultivated plants of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.),
   before conducting an artificial diet bioassay to examine
   pollinator-pathogen interactions. Our results indicated that
   domestication has significantly altered the chemical composition of V.
   corymbosum nectar and pollen, and reduced pollen chemical diversity in
   cultivated plants. Of 20 plant metabolites identified in floral rewards,
   13 differed significantly between wild and cultivated plants, with a
   majority showing positive associations with wild compared to cultivated
   plants. These included the amino acid phenylalanine (4.5 times higher in
   wild nectar, 11 times higher in wild pollen), a known bee phagostimulant
   and essential nutrient; and the antimicrobial caffeic acid ester
   4-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (two times higher in wild nectar). We assessed
   the possible biological relevance of variation in caffeic acid esters in
   bioassays, using the commercially available 3-O-caffeoylquinic acid.
   This compound reduced Bombus impatiens infection by a prominent gut
   pathogen (Crithidia) at concentrations that occurred in wild but not
   cultivated plants, suggesting that domestication may influence floral
   traits with consequences for bee health. Appreciable levels of genetic
   variation and heritability were found for most floral reward chemical
   traits, indicating good potential for selective breeding. Our study
   provides the first assessment of plant domestication effects on floral
   reward chemistry and its potential repercussions for pollinator health.
   Given the central importance of pollinators for agriculture, we discuss
   the need to extend such investigations to pollinator-dependent crops
   more generally and elaborate on future research directions to ascertain
   wider trends, consequences for pollinators, mechanisms, and breeding
   solutions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Intensive agricultural landscapes can be hostile for bees due to a lack
   of floral and nesting resources, and due to management-related stress
   such as pesticide use and soil tillage. This threatens the pollination
   services that bees deliver to insect-pollinated crops. We studied the
   effects of farming intensity (organic vs. conventional, number of
   insecticide applications) and availability of semi-natural habitats at
   the field and landscape scale on pollinator visits and pollen delivery
   to pumpkin in Germany. We found that wild bumble bees were the key
   pollinators of pumpkin in terms of pollen delivery, despite fivefold
   higher visitation frequency of honey bees. Critically, we observed that
   the area of cropland had stronger effects on bees' pollen deposition
   than the area of seminatural habitats. Specifically, a 10\% increase of
   the proportion of cropland reduced pollen delivery by 7\%. Pumpkin
   provides a striking example for a key role of wild pollinators in crop
   pollination even at high numerical dominance of honey bees. In addition,
   our findings suggest that habitat conversion to agricultural land is a
   driver of deteriorating pollination. This underlines the importance to
   maintain sufficient areas of non-crop habitats in agricultural
   landscapes.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how ecological communities are structured is a major goal
   in ecology. Ecological networks representing interaction patterns among
   species have become a powerful tool to capture the mechanisms underlying
   plant-animal assemblages. However, these networks largely do not account
   for inter-individual variability and thus may be limiting our
   development of a clear mechanistic understanding of community structure.
   In this study, we develop a new individual-trait based approach to
   examine the importance of individual plant and pollinator functional
   size traits (pollinator thorax width and plant nectar holder depth) in
   mutualistic networks. We performed hierarchical cluster analyses to
   group interacting individuals into classes, according to their
   similarity in functional size. We then compared the structure of
   bee-flower networks where nodes represented either species identity or
   trait sets. The individual trait-based network was almost twice as
   nested as its species-based equivalent and it had a more symmetric
   linkage pattern resulting from of a high degree of size-matching. In
   conclusion, we show that by constructing individual trait-based networks
   we can reveal important patterns otherwise difficult to observe in
   species-based networks and thus improve our understanding of community
   structure. We therefore recommend using both trait-based and
   species-based approaches together to develop a clearer understanding of

Abstract = {{Obtaining appropriate parameters of photovoltaic models based on

   aims to maintain population diversity and enhance the exploration

Volume = {{424}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the implications of shifts in disturbance regimes for
   plants and pollinators is essential for successful land management.
   Wildfires are essential natural disturbances that are important drivers
   of forest biodiversity, and there is often pressure to respond to
   wildfire with management like post-wildfire logging (i.e., removal of
   dead trees for economic value immediately following wildfire). We
   investigated how local floral and bee density, species richness, and
   community composition and dispersion were influenced by post-wildfire
   logging, and how these effects differed between an older (24
   years-since-fire) and a more recent (8 years-since fire) wildfire in the
   Gallatin National Forest, Montana USA. We also tested how these local
   patterns scaled up to influence landscape patterns in floral and bee
   diversity. After recent wildfire, local floral and bee density and
   species richness were higher in logged than in unlogged sites, and these
   effects were variable over the course of the growing season. There were
   no differences in community dispersion except that of bees in logged
   areas of the recent wildfire, which were less heterogeneous compared to
   unlogged areas. Despite this reduction in bee community heterogeneity,
   overall bee diversity was highest across logged areas of the recent
   fire. While the positive effects of post-wildfire logging on local
   density and richness did not persist in the older fire, compositional
   differences in flowers and bees between logged and unlogged areas were
   observed in both the recent and older wildfire. Together, these results
   suggest that the local benefits of post-wildfire logging for floral and
   bee richness are evident within a decade of these disturbances, but have
   diminished within a quarter century of fire. Nevertheless, compositional
   effects persist, resulting in higher overall landscape floral and bee
   diversity when both logged and unlogged areas of each wildfire were
   present. This study provides evidence for near-term benefits of
   post-wildfire logging for local and landscape floral and bee
   communities. Post-wildfire logging may be considered as a forest
   management option when balanced with the maintenance of unlogged areas
   to encourage biodiversity conservation at the landscape scale.}},

Number = {{7721}},
Pages = {{109+}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture currently relies on pesticides to maximize crop
   yield(1,2). Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticides
   globally(3), but increasing evidence of negative impacts on important
   pollinators(4-9) and other non-target organisms(10) has led to
   legislative reassessment and created demand for the development of
   alternative products. Sulfoximine-based insecticides are the most likely
   successor(11), and are either licensed for use or under consideration
   for licensing in several worldwide markets(3), including within the
   European Union(12), where certain neonicotinoids (imidacloprid,
   clothianidin and thiamethoxam) are now banned from agricultural use
   outside of permanent greenhouse structures. There is an urgent need to
   pre-emptively evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of
   sulfoximine-based pesticides on pollinators(11), because such effects
   are rarely detected by standard ecotoxicological assessments, but can
   have major impacts at larger ecological scales(13-15). Here we show that
   chronic exposure to the sulfoximine-based insecticide sulfoxaflor, at
   dosages consistent with potential post-spray field exposure, has severe
   sub-lethal effects on bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies.
   Field-based colonies that were exposed to sulfoxaflor during the early
   growth phase produced significantly fewer workers than unexposed
   controls, and ultimately produced fewer reproductive offspring.
   Differences between the life-history trajectories of treated and control
   colonies first became apparent when individuals exposed as larvae began
   to emerge, suggesting that direct or indirect effects on a small cohort
   may have cumulative long-term consequences for colony fitness. Our
   results caution against the use of sulfoximines as a direct replacement
   for neonicotinoids. To avoid continuing cycles of novel pesticide
   release and removal, with concomitant impacts on the environment, a
   broad evidence base needs to be assessed prior to the development of
   policy and regulation.}},

   Nectarless Flowers in a Bee-Pollinated Plant Species}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{The presence of nectarless flowers in nectariferous plants is a
   widespread phenomenon in angiosperms. However, the frequency and
   distribution of nectarless flowers in natural populations, and the
   transition from nectariferous to nectarless flowers are poorly known.
   Variation in nectar production may affect mutualism stability, since
   energetic resource availability influences pollinators' foraging
   behavior. Here, we described the spatial and temporal nectar production
   patterns of Jacaranda oxyphylla, a bee-pollinated species that naturally
   presents nectarless flowers. Additionally, we compared nectariferous and
   nectarless floral disks in order to identify histological, subcellular
   and chemical changes that accompanied the loss of nectar production
   ability. For that we used standard methods for light and transmission
   electron microscopy, and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
   for chemical analyses. We verified that 47\% of flowers did not produce
   nectar during the whole flower lifespan (nectarless flowers). We also
   observed remarkable inter-plant variation, with individuals having only
   nectarless flowers, others only nectariferous ones and most of them
   showing different proportions of both flower types, with variable nectar
   volumes (3-21 mu l). Additionally, among nectariferous flowers, we
   registered two distinct rhythms of nectar production. `Early' flowers
   produced nectar from 0 to 24 h, and `late' flowers produced nectar from
   24 to 48 h of anthesis. Although disks from nectariferous and nectarless
   flowers displayed similar histological organization, they differed
   strongly at subcellular level. Nectariferous ('early' and `late')
   flowers exhibited a cellular apparatus typical of nectar secretion,
   while nectarless flowers exhibited osmophoric features. We found three
   aliphatic and one aromatic compound(s) that were detected in both the
   headspace of flowers and the disks of nectarless flowers, but not the
   disks of nectariferous flowers Although the remarkable variation in
   nectar availability may discourage pollinator visits, nectarless flowers
   might compensate it by producing volatile compounds that can be part of
   floral scent, acting as chemical attractants. Thus, nectarless flowers
   may be helping to maintain pollination in this scenario of trophic
   resource supply scarcity. We suggest that J. oxyphylla can be
   transitioning from a nectar-based pollination system to another
   resource-based or even to a deceit mechanism of pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of pollinators in agricultural areas has been observed for
   some decades, this being partly due to landscape simplification in
   intensive agrosystems. Diversifying agricultural landscapes by sowing

   assessing and comparing the abundance and diversity of bees
   (Hymenoptera: Anthophila) and hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) found and
   visiting flowers in three types of flower strips in Belgium: (i) a
   mixture of 11 wild flowers, (ii) a monofloral strip of Dimorphoteca
   pluvialis (Asteraceae) and (iii) a monofloral strip of Camelina sativa
   (Brassicaceae), where the last two are considered to be intercrops since
   they are valuable on the market, all sown within a field of winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.). Pollinators were captured with pan traps and by
   netting in standardised transects from May to July 2017. One-thousand
   one-hundred and eighty-four individuals belonging to 43 bee species and
   18 hoverfly species were collected. Significant differences in hoverfly
   diversity were found between the different flower strips. The
   multifloral treatment supported a greater diversity of syrphid species.
   Various pollinator species visited the different flowers composing the
   mixture and also D. pluvialis. The pollinator community proved to be
   predominantly generalist, with the exception of an oligolectic species
   in Belgium, Andrena nitidiuscula. Moreover, the three tested flower
   strips were effective in attracting hoverflies, among them natural
   enemies of insect pests. This study opens new perspectives in the design
   of intercropping systems with flower strips towards the design of

Abstract = {{The observed decline in wild bees may be connected to the decreasing
   diversity of flowering plants. Changes in floral composition shape
   nutrient availability in inhabited areas, and bee larvae need food rich
   in body-building nutrients to develop into adults. Adult food, mainly
   composed of energy-rich nectar, differs from larval food, mainly
   composed of pollen, and adult bees forage on different plant species for
   nectar and pollen. Defining bee-friendly plants based on the quantities
   of food produced, and on the visitation rates of adult pollinating
   insects leads to the planting of bee habitats with poor-quality food for
   larvae, which limits their growth and development, and negatively
   affects the population. Consequently, failing to understand the
   nutritional needs of wild bees may lead to unintended negative effects
   of conservation efforts. Ecological stoichiometry was developed to
   elucidate the nutritional constraints of organisms and their colonies,
   populations, and communities. Here, I discuss how applying ecological
   stoichiometry to the study of the nutritional ecology of wild bees would
   help fill the gaps in our understanding of bee biology. I present

Abstract = {{1. Floral colour is a fundamental signal that shapes plant-pollinator
   interactions. Despite theoretical reasons why floral colours might shift
   in representation along biotic and abiotic gradients, few studies have
   examined community-level shifts in colour, and even fewer significant
   patterns have been detected.
   2. We examined floral colour on six replicated transects spanning 1,300
   m in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. Along these transects, there
   is a hypothesized shift from bee-dominated to fly-dominated pollination
   with increasing elevation. The reflectance of flowers of 110 forb and
   shrub species was measured using a spectrophotometer, and was used to
   estimate three components of colour (hue, saturation and brightness) in
   relevant pollinator visual spaces. Percent cover data were collected
   from 67 sites and used to obtain community-weighted mean (cwm) estimates
   of floral colour.
   3. We found strong patterns of elevational change in floral colour.
   Reflectance cwm of shorter wavelengths (UVB through human blue, 300-500
   nm) generally decreased linearly with elevation, while reflectance cwm
   of longer wavelengths (human green through red, 500-700 nm) showed
   hump-shaped patterns with highest reflectance at intermediate
   elevations. With respect to pollinators, saturation cwm increased
   significantly with elevation in both bee and fly visual spaces, while
   brightness contrast cwm showed a hump-shaped pattern in bee space and a
   decline with elevation in fly visual space. For hue, cover of species
   perceived as bee-blue declined with elevation, while cover of
   bee-UV-green species showed a hump-shaped pattern. In comparison, we
   detected no elevational shifts in floral hues as perceived by flies.
   4. Synthesis. Hue patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that bee
   pollinators have shaped the geography of floral colour. The roles of fly
   pollinators and of abiotic drivers are more difficult to infer, although
   the drop in floral brightness at high elevations is consistent with
   predictions that low temperatures and more intense ultraviolet radiation
   should favour increased pigment concentrations there. Our results
   indicate that floral colour can be dynamic yet predictable across the
   landscape, a pattern that provides opportunities to tease apart the
   ecological and evolutionary drivers of this important plant trait.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is a primary threat to biodiversity, but how it
   affects the structure and stability of ecological networks is poorly
   understood. Here, we studied plant-pollinator and host-parasitoid
   networks on 32 calcareous grassland fragments covering a size gradient
   of several orders of magnitude and with amounts of additional habitat
   availability in the surrounding landscape that varied independent of
   fragment size. We find that additive and interactive effects of habitat
   fragmentation at local (fragment size) and landscape scales (1,750 m
   radius) directly shape species communities by altering the number of
   interacting species and, indirectly, their body size composition. These,
   in turn, affect plant-pollinator, but not host-parasitoid, network
   structure: the nestedness and modularity of plant-pollinator networks
   increase with pollinator body size. Moreover, pollinator richness
   increases modularity. In contrast, the modularity of host-parasitoid
   networks decreases with host richness, whereas neither parasitoid
   richness nor body size affects network structure. Simulating species
   coextinctions also reveals that the structure-stability relationship
   depends on species' sensitivity to coextinctions and their capacity for
   adaptive partner switches, which differ between mutualistic and
   antagonistic interaction partners. While plant-pollinator communities
   may cope with future habitat fragmentation by responding to species loss
   with opportunistic partner switches, past effects of fragmentation on
   the current structure of host-parasitoid networks may strongly affect
   their robustness to coextinctions under future habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{North American Midwestern oak (Quercus spp.) savannas are rare
   fire-dependent ecosystems that can support high levels of biodiversity
   and are the focus of considerable restoration effort due to widespread
   fire suppression. Due to the predominance of understory forbs in oak
   savannas, many of which require insect pollination, restoration
   practices should be evaluated for their potential impacts on pollinator
   communities. We evaluated bee community responses during the first 2
   years of experimental restoration of fire-suppressed oak savanna in
   southern Michigan. We used unmanaged references and two different
   restoration methods (burning only and burning with thinning) to examine
   the effects of restoration intensity on the abundance, diversity, and
   functional groups of bees. We found that thinning and burning rapidly
   increased bee abundance, richness, and Shannon's diversity, relative to
   unmanaged references, whereas burn-only restoration largely failed to do
   so. Thinning and burning also resulted in a distinct bee community after
   two seasons, while bee communities in burn-only restoration plots were
   similar to those from unmanaged references. Differences in bee diversity
   and community structure between treatments may be due to the influence
   of restoration on nesting resources, which is reflected in the
   differential captures of various nesting guilds. Overall, oak savanna
   restoration by thinning and burning had positive effects on bee
   diversity, while burning alone only increased bee abundance. We thus
   illustrate how restoration strategies that typically target plants have
   broader-reaching biodiversity benefits. Although restoring savannas
   through burning alone may eventually shift bee communities, coupling
   thinning with burning will influence pollinator communities over the
   shorter term.}},

Abstract = {{Big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) characterizes and dominates the
   sagebrush steppe, the largest temperate semi-desert ecosystem in North
   America. The beneficial arthropod fauna hosted by A. tridentata is
   poorly known but could be of importance to nearby agriculture seeking to
   exploit biologically-based pest management. Over four years, we
   identified and assessed the seasonal abundance of beneficial arthropods
   (predators, parasitoids, pollinators) associated with A. tridentata
   during spring to autumn in the Yakima Valley of central Washington using
   sticky traps. During 2011-2014, 207 sticky traps were placed on
   non-blooming and blooming A. tridentata plants for a total of 966
   trapping days. Overall, across all seasons, we trapped 259.7 beneficial
   arthropods per trap and 92\% of these were parasitoid wasps.
   Significantly greater numbers of beneficial arthropods were associated
   with blooming A. tridentata during autumn (410/trap) than non-blooming
   plants in the spring (181.3/trap) or summer (85.1/trap). Parasitoid
   wasps and predatory true bugs were most abundant during the autumn, but
   ladybeetles, lacewings, spiders, bees, and predatory thrips were most
   common during spring. The association of high numbers of predators,
   parasitoids, and pollinators with A. tridentata during blooming and
   non-blooming periods indicates that this plant is an important reservoir
   of beneficial arthropods in the sagebrush steppe of central Washington.
   Consequently, biologically-based pest management programs in central
   Washington may benefit from careful management and retention of A.
   tridentata plants on crop borders.}},

Abstract = {{Resources (energy expenses) that can be devoted to progeny are always
   limited. Optimal resource allocation theory predicts that parents should
   allocate resources to their offspring in portions that maximise their
   own fitness returns per unit invested, not the fitness of the offspring.
   Females of solitary, nest-constructing bees control the key features of
   offspring fitness by determining both body size and sex of each
   individual. Therefore the sexual size dimorphic red mason bee, Osmia
   bicornis (L.) {[}= Osmia rufa (L.)] (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae),
   constitutes a suitable model system to test optimal resource allocation
   theory. Body size range was analysed by food stock manipulation and
   hedged against possible associated allometric divergences of flight
   parameters. In harmony with the central prediction of the theory,
   O.bicornis females ordinarily provisioned offspring with food that did
   not enable maximal body size, but ensured successful development to
   adulthood. On average, only three-quarters of the actually required food
   to growth to full body size was supplied. Although females fundamentally
   balanced size vs. number of offspring according to the optimal
   allocation theory, the variability in body size was very high and the
   mean body mass of both sexes differed in the field between years. These
   fluctuations in body size over space and time indicate that various
   environmental factors are of prime importance in the actual resource
   assessment decision in addition to the core parental resource allocation
   strategy. As a physiological consequence of optimal resource allocation,
   the sex-specific critical weight of larvae to induce metamorphosis is
   ordinarily not reached at field conditions. Instead, metamorphosis is
   induced by a bail-out process when larvae run out of the food
   provisioned by their mother.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Human land use, including agriculture, is a leading contributor to
   declining biodiversity world-wide and can leave long- lasting legacies
   on ecosystems after cessation. Ecological restoration is an approach to
   mitigate these impacts. However, little is known about how animal
   communities and plant-animal interactions respond to the combined
   effects of land-use legacies and restoration. We investigated how
   restoration and agricultural history affect bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea:
   Anthophila) communities and pollination function. In 27 paired remnant
   (no history of agriculture) and post-agricultural longleaf pine (Pinus
   palustris Mill.) woodlands, we established 4-10 1-ha plots (126 total)
   and experimentally restored half of them, while the other half were left
   as unrestored controls. Restoration was accomplished through canopy
   thinning which reinstates open savanna-like conditions. We collected
   bees in each plot using a combination of bowl trapping and standardized
   netting transects. Thinning increased bee abundance by 169\% and bee
   richness by 110\%, but agricultural land use had no effect on these
   variables. Bee community composition was affected by restoration and was
   marginally affected by agricultural history. To measure pollination
   function, we conducted a sentinel plant experiment in which potted black
   mustard (Brassica nigra L.) plants were placed out in a subset of these
   sites (n = 10) and either bagged to exclude pollinators or left open for
   pollinator access. Then, we measured fruit and seed set of sentinel
   plants to compare pollination function among the restoration and
   land-use history treatments. Seed set and fruit set of sentinel plants
   were higher in open than bagged plants, indicating that this model
   system effectively measured pollination, but we found no differences in
   pollination based on restoration or agricultural history. These results
   indicate that although pollinator communities may show clear responses
   to restoration that are largely independent of prior land-use impacts,
   this does not necessarily translate into differences in pollination
   function after restoration.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the abundance and species richness of bees at 10 sites

   traps) painted fluorescent blue, yellow, or white and filled and with
   soapy water that were intended to mimic flower colors and attract bees.
   We compared the abundance of all species combined and species richness
   among management treatments (clearcuts, old fields, and gravel pits),
   patch area, and time since management action. We also compared the
   combined captures from bee bowls to relative abundance indices from the
   SBMP, as well as flower abundance and richness. Neither captured bee
   abundance nor species richness differed among management treatments;
   however, by removing a possible outlier, both abundance and richness
   were greatest in gravel pits compared to other habitats. There was no
   correlation between bee captures and the SBMP, and no correlation
   between captures and flower abundance or floral diversity. Our study
   demonstrates that habitats managed for New England Cottontail support a
   diverse assemblage of native bees. Gravel pits are potentially valuable
   targets for native bee conservation, but old fields and clearcuts offer
   alternatives in landscapes without gravel pits. Native bees are
   essential to support ecosystem function, and understanding their
   distribution and natural history is important to develop
   habitat-management efforts that benefit not only bees but multiple

Abstract = {{Keel-flowers have evolved structures and mechanisms to protect their
   pollen and enhance pollen removal by pollinators. Polygala myrtifolia L.
   (Polygalaceae) has a keel-flower exclusively pollinated by carpenter
   bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae). The keel also has an elaborate, fluffy
   appendage (crest) which has been proposed to function as a pollinator
   attractant, a landing platform, or a lever. This study explored the
   functional role of the crest. A manipulation experiment determined the
   effects of crest removal on pollinator visitation and the bees' ability
   to access the nectar. Foraging times, preference, and ease of access to
   nectar were recorded for flowers with and without crests. Crest
   attractiveness through scent was investigated using a neutral red assay
   as well as potential attraction through colour contrasts using UV and
   false-colour imaging. Forces required to open the keel were measured at
   the crest and parts of the keel. Carpenter bees had a stronger initial
   preference for crested over non-crested flowers and this translated into
   a higher number of visits for crested flowers. The proportion of visits
   resulting in successful nectar access was significantly higher for
   crested flowers. Crested flowers were visited for significantly longer
   periods than non-crested flowers. Crest colour as perceived by bees
   strongly contrasted with the rest of the flower suggesting an attractive
   function, while crests appear not to be involved in scent production.
   Forces to open the keel were much lower at the crest than at the keel,
   suggesting a lever function. We suggest that the crest functions both as
   a lever and as a visual attractant. (c) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier

   m(2)/ha of basal area. Bee alpha-diversity and abundance positively
   correlated with understory species richness suggesting that forested
   sites with low basal area, likely corresponding to overstory canopy gaps
   and increased site occupancy by forbaceous species, may drive local
   abundance and diversity of wild bee assemblages. This study provides
   basal area threshold values in a mixed conifer forest type that may be

Abstract = {{Multiple barriers may contribute to reproductive isolation between
   closely related species. Understanding the relative strength of these
   barriers can illuminate the ecological factors that currently maintain
   species integrity and how these factors originally promoted speciation.
   Two Himalayan alpine gingers, Roscoea purpurea and R. tumjensis, occur
   sympatrically in central Nepal and have such similar morphology that it
   is not clear whether or how they maintain a distinct identity. Our
   quantitative measurements of the components of reproductive isolation
   show that they are, in fact, completely isolated by a combination of
   phenological displacement of flowering, earlier for R. tumjensis and
   later for R. purpurea, and complete fidelity of visitation by different
   pollinator species, bumblebees for R. tumjensis and a long-tongued fly
   for R. purpurea. Furthermore, the nectar of R. tumjensis flowers is
   available to the shorter tongued bumblebees while R. purpurea nectar is
   less accessible, requiring deep probing from long-tongued flies.
   Although flowering phenology is a strong current barrier that seemingly
   obviates any need for pollinator discrimination, this current pattern
   need not reflect selective forces occurring at the initial divergence of
   R. tumjensis. There has been considerable pollinator switching during
   the radiation of the Himalayan Roscoea, and the association of flowering
   time with type of pollinator in these sympatric species may have
   originated among the earliest or latest flowering individuals or
   populations of an ancestor to exploit either bumblebee activity early in
   the breeding season or long-tongued fly abundance later in the season.
   These two sympatric Roscoea species add to accumulating evidence of the
   primacy of prezygotic pollination traits in speciation among angiosperms
   even in the absence of postzygotic incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-mediated selection toward larger and abundant flowers is

   fitness component from attacked and non-attacked flowers of the
   Brazilian hummingbird-pollinated shrub Collaea cipoensis to determine
   the selective effects of pollinators and floral antagonists on flower
   size and number. We predicted that floral antagonists reduce the female
   fitness component and thus exert negative selective pressures on flower
   size and number, counteracting the positive effects of pollinators.
   Pollinators, mainly hummingbirds, comprised 4\% of total floral
   visitation, whereas antagonist ants and bees accounted for 90\% of
   visitation. Nectar-robbers involved about 99\% of floral antagonist
   visit rates, whereas florivores comprised the remaining 1\%. Larger and

Abstract = {{Clothianidin is a commonly used systemic insecticide in seed treatments.
   Residues of clothianidin can occur in nectar and pollen as a result of
   within-plant-translocation. Foraging bees can collect contaminated
   nectar or pollen. Concerns have been brought forward that exposure to
   pesticide residues might affect colonies especially if they are weakened
   by varroosis. However, there are few scientific studies investigating
   such multiple-stressor scenarios in the context of the entire colony. To
   close this gapa field trial with 24 colonies was set up. The study
   design comprised four groups of six colonies each fed with
   uncontaminated sugar syrup ('C0'), or syrup spiked with 10 mu g L-1
   clothianidin ('C10'), 50 mu g L-1 clothianidin ('C50') or 200 mu g L(-1
   )clothianidin ('C200'). C10 represented a residue concentration that may
   exceptionally occur and therefore a worst-case scenario, the higher
   dietary concentrations exceed and do not reflect fieldrealistic levels.
   A substantial load of 8 mites of Varroa destructor per ten gram bees in
   autumn was adjusted. The colonies were followed up for 328 days. The
   amount of brood and the strength of each colony were regularly assessed.
   Colony health, bee mortality, overwintering success, hive weights, and
   levels of in-hive residues were determined. Varroosis turned out to be
   the significant key factor for the endpoint colony strength.
   Clothianidin did not have a statistically significant impact on C0, C10
   and C50 colonies. No statistical evidence was found for an interaction
   between varroosis andexposure to clothianidin.}},

Abstract = {{Species distribution modelling (SDM) has been applied to multiple bee
   species to examine how they may respond to future climate change. Those
   studies indicate a variety of likely responses to a warming climate. No
   SDM approaches, however, have been undertaken for arid-adapted bees,
   despite their enormous diversity in xeric habitats.
   We applied SDM to an arid-zone allodapine bee, Exoneurella tridentata
   Houston, 1976 (Apidae: Allodapini), and the two tree species it depends
   on for nesting substrate, Alectryon oleifolius (Desf.) S.T. Reynolds
   (Sapindaceae) and Acacia papyrocarpa Benth. (Fabaceae).
   Because of the complete dependency of this bee on these trees, there is
   the possibility that its vulnerability to climate change may be greater
   than for bee species that have broader nesting niches, such as ground or
   non-specific cavity nesting. Using a variety of future climate
   scenarios, both optimistic and pessimistic, and also the bee's nest
   plant species as predictor variables of its distribution in some
   modelling runs, we find that both tree species and E.tridentata are
   likely to be resilient to future climates.
   Our findings suggest that for Australian arid-zone bees, at least
   vulnerability to future climate change may be very different than that

Abstract = {{Geopropolis, a different type of propolis, presents a mixture of resin
   and exudates, containing wax, silt, and sand particles. This product has
   been the subject of research interest for its physicochemical
   properties, economic importance, and likely for environmental
   monitoring. The determination of toxic metals in hive products has been
   reported as an efficient tool for environmental monitoring. As the honey
   production is now common in urban environments, this study aimed to
   determine the concentration of toxic metals in the Melipona scutellaris
   geopropolis of the Metropolitan Region of Salvador, Bahia. Geopropolis
   and soil samples were collected from seven important beehives between
   June 2015 and July 2016. After EPA 3050B acid digestion procedure,
   metals were determined by ICP OES. As the geopropolis is partially made
   from soil, the values of Cr and Fe were extremely more important than
   the values reported in propolis, wax, and honey found in other worldwide
   studies. It gives different characteristics to this product depending on
   the location of the hive and characterizes it as an efficient
   integrating indicator of soil pollution. Using the enrichment factor, we
   determined that the soils around the meliponary are not or only slightly
   polluted by Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn. However, there was a shift in the
   particle size of geopropolis, being loamier and less sandy than the
   surrounding soil. In such case, a higher metal content could be
   expected, though no metal enrichment in the geopropolis was found, even
   a decrease in zinc, possibly due to the exclusion of metals by bees, was
   noted. Nevertheless, the results on the proportions of lithogenic metal
   and anthropogenic metal indicate that some metals have an external
   origin (about 20\% for Ni and Cu). Geopropolis can be considered as a
   good environmental indicator even in low contaminated areas. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Social bees represent an important group of pollinating insects that can
   be exposed to potentially harmful pesticides when foraging on treated or
   contaminated flowering plants. To investigate if such exposure is
   detrimental to bees, many studies have exclusively fed individuals with
   pesticide-spiked food, informing us about the hazard but not necessarily
   the risk of exposure. While such studies are important to establish the
   physiological and behavioural effects on individuals, they do not
   consider the possibility that the risk of exposure may change over time.
   For example, many pesticide assays exclude potential behavioural
   adaptations to novel toxins, such as rejection of harmful compounds by
   choosing to feed on an uncontaminated food source, thus behaviourally
   lowering the risk of exposure. In this paper, we conducted an experiment
   over 10 days in which bumblebees could forage on an array of sucrose
   feeders containing 0, 2 and 11 parts per billion of the neonicotinoid
   pesticide thiamethoxam. This more closely mimics pesticide exposure in
   the wild by allowing foraging bees to (i) experience a field realistic
   range of pesticide concentrations across a chronic exposure period, (ii)
   have repeated interactions with the pesticide in their environment, and
   (iii) retain the social cues associated with foraging by using whole
   colonies. We found that the proportion of visits to pesticide-laced
   feeders increased over time, resulting in greater consumption of
   pesticide-laced sucrose relative to untreated sucrose. After changing
   the spatial position of each feeder, foragers continued to
   preferentially visit the pesticide-laced feeders which indicates that
   workers can detect thiamethoxam and alter their behaviour to continue
   feeding on it. The increasing preference for consuming the
   neonicotinoid-treated food therefore increases the risk of exposure for
   the colony during prolonged pesticide exposure. Our results highlight
   the need to incorporate attractiveness of pesticides to foraging bees
   (and potentially other insect pollinators) in addition to simply
   considering the proportion of pesticide-contaminated floral resources
   within the foraging landscape.}},

   creation of flower-rich habitats on farmland has been subsidized in both
   the USA and EU to support biodiversity and promote delivery of ecosystem
   services. Yet, theory suggests that the landscape context in which local
   diversification strategies are implemented will influence their success.
   However, few studies have empirically evaluated this theory or assessed
   the ability to support multiple ecosystem services simultaneously. Here,
   we evaluate the impact of creating flower-rich habitats in field margins
   on pollination, pest control, and crop yield over 3 years using a paired
   design across a landscape gradient. We find general positive effects of
   natural habitat cover on fruit weight and that flowering borders
   increase yields by promoting bee visitation to adjacent crops only in
   landscapes with intermediate natural habitat cover. Flowering borders
   had little impact on biological control regardless of landscape context.
   Thus, knowledge of landscape context can be used to target wildflower
   border placement in areas where they will have the greatest likelihood
   for success and least potential for increasing pest populations or yield
   loss in nearby crops.}},

Abstract = {{The yellow-banded bumblebee Bombus terricola was common in North America
   but has recently declined and is now on the IUCN Red List of threatened
   species. The causes of B. terricola's decline are not well understood.
   Our objectives were to create a partial genome and then use this to
   estimate population data of conservation interest, and to determine
   whether genes showing signs of recent selection suggest a specific cause
   of decline. First, we generated a draft partial genome (contig set) for
   B. terricola, sequenced using Pacific Biosciences RS II at an average
   depth of 35x. Second, we sequenced the individual genomes of 22
   bumblebee gynes from Ontario and Quebec using Illumina HiSeq 2500, each
   at an average depth of 20x, which were used to improve the PacBio genome
   calls and for population genetic analyses. The latter revealed that
   several samples had long runs of homozygosity, and individuals had high
   inbreeding coefficient F, consistent with low effective population size.
   Our data suggest that B. terricola's effective population size has
   decreased orders of magnitude from pre-Holocene levels. We carried out
   tests of selection to identify genes that may have played a role in
   ameliorating environmental stressors underlying B. terricola's decline.
   Several immune-related genes have signatures of recent positive
   selection, which is consistent with the pathogen-spillover hypothesis
   for B. terricola's decline. The new B. terricola contig set can help
   solve the mystery of bumblebee decline by enabling functional genomics
   research to directly assess the health of pollinators and identify the
   stressors causing declines.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the first complete mitogenome of Andrenidae, namely
   Andrena camellia, is newly sequenced. It includes 13 protein-coding
   (PCG) genes, 22 transfer RNA (rRNA) genes, two ribosomal RNA (tRNA)

   in cytochrome oxidase genes with cox/ exhibits the highest conservation.
   Conversely, NADH dehydrogenase and ATPase subunit genes are more
   variable with atp8 presents the maximal variation. Comparison of the
   gene order indicates complex rearrangement in bees. Most of the
   rearranged events are located in the tRNA clusters of trnl-trnQ-trnM,
   trnW-trnC-trnY, and trnA-trnR-trnN-trnS1-trnE-trnF. Furthermore, we
   present the most comprehensive mitochondrial phylogeny of bee families.
   The monophyly of each family and the long-tongued bees is highly
   supported. However, short-tongued bees are inferred as paraphyletic
   relative to the sister relationship between Melittidae and other bee
   families. Furthermore, to improve the resolution of phylogeny, various
   datasets and analytical approaches are performed. It is indicated that
   datasets including third codons of PCGs facilitate to produce identical
   topology and higher nodal support. The tRNA genes that have typical
   cloverleaf secondary structures also exhibit similar positive effects.
   However, rRNAs present poor sequence alignment and distinct substitution
   saturation, which result in negative effects on both tree topology and
   nodal support. In addition, Gblocks treatment can increase the
   congruence of topologies, but has opposite effects on nodal support
   between the two inference methods of maximum likelihood and Bayesian

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Numerous fossils from the Upper Cretaceous have
   been confidently placed within modern crown groups. Many 95-75 Myr-old
   taxa, however, including the taxon described herein, do not fit well
   with known extant crown or stem groups. Understanding such fossils and
   their possible affinities would certainly enhance our understanding of
   the circumstances involved in a major eudicot radiation.
   METHODS: Bulk samples from the Old Crossman Clay Pit were prepared using
   standard methodology, which includes several washing and sieving steps,
   and a treatment with hydrofluoric acid. The fossil taxon was coded into
   a matrix built from the combination of two previously published
   morphological matrices and was analyzed using the parsimony criterion
   with the computer program TNT.
   KEY RESULTS: The fossils have a unique combination of characters
   relative to living and fossil Ericales taxa, and therefore, a new genus,
   Teuschestanthes, is erected. Mosaic evolution and rapid parallel changes
   in such groups blur taxonomic distinctions, and these issues are
   exacerbated by limited numbers of characters available in fossils.
   Teuschestanthes flowers are slightly bilaterally symmetrical and
   somewhat variable with regard to petal disposition, suggesting an early
   stage in transition to bilaterality from radial symmetry early in
   eudicot history under pollinator selective pressure.
   CONCLUSIONS: While Teuschestanthes shares characters with modern
   Ericales and Sapindales, there are significant non-overlapping
   differences between Teuschestanthes and modern Sapindales (notably,
   among others, ovule number). Based on available evidence, however, the
   position of Teuschestanthes is likely as an early offshoot of the stem
   Glade of core Ericales (Ericales sensu stricto). Its relatively unstable
   floral plan may presage subsequent bilaterality associated with growing
   selective pressure by advanced pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Most pollinators have the foraging flexibility to visit a wide variety
   of plant species. Yet few studies of pollinator-mediated processes in
   plants have considered the effects of variation in individual foraging
   patterns on plant reproductive success. In this study, we use an
   individual-based model of pollinator foraging economics to predict how
   visitation rates and pollination success of two coflowering plant
   species change with their frequency (relative abundance). Whereas
   previous studies suggested that adaptive foraging of pollinators always
   favors pollination of abundant plant species (positive frequency
   dependence), here we show that under certain conditions the per capita
   pollination success of a rare plant species can exceed that of a more
   abundant species. Specifically, when the overall flower density is
   sufficiently high and pollinators' perception ranges are sufficiently
   large, animals with limited memory of previously encountered rewards
   forage in a way that favors pollination of the rarer plant species.
   Moreover, even with perfectly informed foragers, a rare plant species
   benefits more from offering a higher floral reward than a more abundant
   species. Our results show that adaptive foraging of individual
   pollinators can have important implications for plant community dynamics
   and the persistence of rare plant species.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Climate change may alter the timing of flowering and pollinator activity
   to differing degrees, resulting in phenological mismatches between
   mutualistic partners. Assessing the potential for such mismatches
   requires an understanding of the environmental factors that cue
   flowering and pollinator activity. Biological context is key to
   determining specific impacts of climate change, and therefore it is
   important to study mutualisms with pollinators of different nesting
   biologies. Our study focused on the phenology of two mutualists native
   to the coastal dunes of northwestern California: the silky beach pea
   (Lathyrus littorals) and its main pollinator, the ground-nesting
   solitary silver bee (Habropoda miserabilis). We measured the current
   phenological overlap between the two species and took advantage of local
   fine-scale spatial variation in the timing of flowering and bee nesting
   activity to develop predictive models of flowering and flight period
   timing based on variation in soil temperature and moisture. Temperature
   best predicted both flowering and bee activity, although soil moisture
   influenced the timing as well. Comparison of linear regression slopes of
   phenology against temperature suggests that bee nesting time is more
   sensitive to differences in seasonal maximum temperatures, and may
   advance more rapidly than flowering with temperature increases. Although
   the current phenological overlap between the two species is high, this
   differential response to temperature could result in a decrease in
   overlap with climate warming. Our results highlight that nesting biology
   may be critical in determining impacts of climate change on pollination
   mutualisms, as ground-nesting bees may respond differently than other
   bee species. In addition, this work reveals the utility of studying bee
   species that nest in aggregations for understanding ground-nesting bee
   phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence suggests declines in the abundance and diversity of
   wild bees. Increasing habitat that provides forage and nesting sites
   could boost struggling populations, particularly in urban, suburban and
   agricultural landscapes. The millions of acres beneath aerial electric
   transmission lines, sometimes referred to as easements or rights-of-way,
   must be kept free of tall-growing vegetation and hence have the
   potential to provide suitable habitat for many native species. Prior
   work has demonstrated that bee communities in easements managed using
   alternatives to episodic mowing were more diverse than in nearby open
   areas, however true control sites within the easements were unavailable.
   In order to compare vegetation management protocols, we conducted a
   two-year study which enabled us to directly compare transmission line
   easements in three locations currently undergoing Integrated Vegetation
   Management-a dynamic form of management involving spot removal and
   herbicide treatment of unwanted species (treatment) with nearby sites
   undergoing standard management protocols of yearly or biyearly mowing
   (control). Results show that treatment sites had significantly higher
   abundance and species richness than controls. Seasonal differences were
   pronounced, with the spring fauna most affected by differences in
   vegetation management. In addition, the older treatment sites house more
   social bees, more parasitic species and a more even distribution of bees
   across nesting guilds. Finally, we established that treatment sites had
   distinct bee communities, further increasing their value as sources for
   native bee populations in the landscape. Overall, the data clearly show
   the value of implementing alternative active vegetation management in
   the land under powerlines to achieve an increase in the abundance and

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction in heterostylous populations may be vulnerable to

   populations with different morph structures to estimate intermorph
   mating (d). In a field experiment, we used progeny ratios from 47
   spatially isolated individuals to estimate d, and measured the intensity
   of pollen limitation experienced by the morphs. The M-and S-morphs
   experienced high rates of d, regardless of population size or morph
   ratio. Estimates for the L-morph revealed low levels of intramorph
   mating in three dimorphic and two trimorphic populations, but near
   complete intramorph mating in a monomorphic population. Despite high
   levels of intermorph mating in the field experiment, the morphs
   experienced significant pollen limitation of fruit and seed set, but
   this did not differ in intensity among the morphs. Our field experiment
   demonstrates that although plant isolation was associated with pollen

Abstract = {{Due to an increase in environmental and health issues and with the
   excessive use of synthetic pesticides, many studies are investigating
   plant essential oils (EOs) for pest control. These compounds are
   considered safe control agents since they have low toxicity to
   non-target organisms. Thus, this study aimed to select potential EOs
   from the Myrtaceae family and their constituents for the control of
   Ascia monuste (Godart) and to evaluate those EOs selectivity to two
   non-target organisms (Solenopsis saevissima Smith and Tetragonisca
   angustula Latreille). Twelve EOs, extracted by hydrodistillation from
   Corymbia and Eucalyptus plants, were tested in this study. All toxicity
   bioassays were performed by topical application. C. citriodora EO had
   the highest insecticidal activity against A. monuste (LD50 = 20.61 mu
   g/mg) and also presented a fast action (LT50 < 10 min). Citronellal was
   the main compound of C. citriodora EO (86.8\% of the oil constitution)
   and exhibited toxicity similar to this EO. The other compounds caused no
   significant mortality. Hence, the toxicity of the C. citriodora EO is
   mostly explained by the citronellal activity. This EO was selective in
   favor of the predatory ant S. saevissima but caused high mortality of
   the pollinator bee T angustula. Therefore, C. citriodora EO is a
   promising model in the development of insecticides against A. monuste.
   However, to mitigate its impact over pollinators, its application must
   rely on the principles of ecological selectivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{1. Resource pulses, narrow periods of high resource availability, can
   elicit strong behavioural responses across diverse taxa. Mass-flowering
   agricultural crops are an example of a resource pulse that insect
   pollinators exploit. However, the underlying mechanism behind changes in
   pollinator behaviour associated with mass-flowering crops is still
   relatively unexplored. 2. The present study quantified the behavioural
   response of bumble bees, an important wild pollinator, to commercial
   cranberry bloom, an important mass-flowering crop in Wisconsin, U.S.A.
   Over a 2-year period, foraging trip duration was measured using radio
   frequency identification at 14 farms situated across landscape contexts,
   ranging from high to low natural area (woodland amount). Using transect
   surveys, floral resource abundance at a landscape scale was estimated.
   3. It was found that bumble bees were highly sensitive to temporal
   changes in landscape-level resource abundance associated with the onset
   of cranberry bloom, during which they decreased foraging trip duration
   by 22\% and increased the number of foraging trips during bloom by 24\%
   on average relative to the period before and after bloom. This
   phenomenon was consistent across colonies, individual bees, and
   landscape contexts, despite a higher abundance of flowers in low
   woodland landscapes. Bumble bee colonies growing in low- and
   high-woodland landscapes exhibited a similar performance. 4. As
   mass-flowering crops are probably a factor influencing bumble bee
   foraging behaviour in agricultural regions, investigations should
   continue into how variable resource landscapes, particularly those
   offering resource pulses, affect wild pollinators and the pollination
   services they provide.}},

Abstract = {{The buzzing foraging behavior of female bees for pollen harvesting
   called the attention of early pollination biologists. Flower types that
   demand this buzzing behavior comprise about 20,000 species of different
   and phylogenetically unrelated plant taxa, suggesting that it had
   independently evolved many times among the flowering plants. Between the
   late 1970s and early 1980s, theoretical papers had modeled the
   energetics of buzz pollination, but, up to this moment, no hypothesis
   was experimentally tested concerning the theoretical basis of the
   energetics of buzz pollination. We present a cost-effective and simple
   apparatus, including a digital and highly accurate frequency generator,
   and a device for the transference of buzz-frequency energy to the
   receptive floral unity. The receptive floral unities may comprise the
   entire or partial androecium, or the tubular corolla, or, in some cases,
   the whole flower. This apparatus can be easily used in both laboratory
   and field conditions of research, as natural air currents are avoided,
   and the response of pollen liberation can be quantitatively measured by
   pollen grain counts that can be captured by adhesion in slide poured

Abstract = {{Climate oscillations have left a significant impact on the patterns of

   the effect of Quaternary climate instability on population genetic
   variability of a bumble bee pollinator species, Bombus huntii in western
   North America. Pleistocene and contemporary B.huntii habitat suitability
   (HS) was estimated with an environmental niche model (ENM) by
   associating 1,035 locality records with 10 bioclimatic variables. To
   estimate genetic variability, we genotyped 380 individuals from 33
   localities at 13 microsatellite loci. Bayesian inference was used to
   examine population structure with and without a priori specification of
   geographic locality. We compared isolation by distance (IBD) and
   isolation by resistance (IBR) models to examine population
   differentiation within and among the Bayesian inferred genetic clusters.
   Furthermore, we tested for the effect of environmental niche stability
   (ENS) on population genetic diversity with linear regression. As
   predicted, high-latitude B.huntii habitats exhibit low ENS when compared
   to low-latitude habitats. Two major genetic clusters of B.huntii inhabit
   western North America: (a) a north genetic cluster predominantly
   distributed north of 28 degrees N and (b) a south genetic cluster
   distributed south of 28 degrees N. In the south genetic cluser, both IBD
   and IBR models are significant. However, in the north genetic cluster,
   IBD is significant but not IBR. Furthermore, the IBR models suggest that
   low-latitude montane populations are surrounded by habitat with low HS,
   possibly limiting dispersal, and ultimately gene flow between
   populations. Finally, we detected high genetic diversity across
   populations in regions that have been climatically unstable since the
   last glacial maximum (LGM), and low genetic diversity across populations
   in regions that have been climatically stable since the LGM.

Abstract = {{Pollinator foraging behavior has direct consequences for plant
   reproduction and has been implicated in driving floral trait evolution.
   Exploring the degree to which pollinators exhibit flexibility in
   foraging behavior will add to a mechanistic understanding of how
   pollinators can impose selection on plant traits. Although plants have
   evolved suites of floral traits to attract pollinators, flower color is
   a particularly important aspect of the floral display. Some pollinators
   show strong innate color preference, but many pollinators display
   flexibility in preference due to learning associations between rewards
   and color, or due to variable perception of color in different
   environments or plant communities. This study examines the flexibility
   in flower color preference of two groups of native butterfly pollinators
   under natural field conditions. We find that pipevine swallowtails
   (Battus philenor) and skippers (family Hesperiidae), the predominate
   pollinators of the two native Texas Phlox species, Phlox cuspidata and
   Phlox drummondii, display distinct patterns of color preferences across
   different contexts. Pipevine swallowtails exhibit highly flexible color
   preferences and likely utilize other floral traits to make foraging
   decisions. In contrast, skippers have consistent color preferences and
   likely use flower color as a primary cue for foraging. As a result of
   this variation in color preference flexibility, the two pollinator
   groups impose concordant selection on flower color in some contexts but
   discordant selection in other contexts. This variability could have
   profound implications for how flower traits respond to
   pollinator-mediated selection. Our findings suggest that studying
   dynamics of behavior in natural field conditions is important for
   understanding plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects are integral to the health of all terrestrial
   ecosystems and agriculture worldwide. Urbanization can greatly reduce
   nutritional resources and habitat for pollinators. However, these losses
   can be mitigated through targeted landscape practices, such as planting
   nectar- and pollen-rich plants and managing pollinator habitat in urban
   areas, especially home landscapes. As homeowners attempt to conserve
   pollinators through horticultural practices, they often seek the advice
   and guidance of horticulture retail employees. The knowledge
   horticulture employees have about pollinators and the recommendations
   they provide to customers is largely unknown. A nationwide survey was
   developed and distributed with the objectives to 1) assess employee
   knowledge about pollinators and pollination biology, 2) discover what
   plant and management recommendations employees were giving customers
   pertaining to pollinator conservation, and 3) determine where to focus
   possible education and outreach, as well as which topics to focus

Abstract = {{Planting milkweeds on public and private lands has emerged as a central
   conservation strategy for restoring declining North American migratory
   populations of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Nearly all
   actionable science on this issue has focused on restoring common
   milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.) in rural land types. The aim of this
   study was to develop recommendations for the best milkweeds for managed
   gardens intended to support both monarch butterflies and bees. Eight
   milkweed (Asclepias) species varying in height, form, and leaf shape
   were grown in a common-garden experiment at a public arboretum. We
   measured milkweed growth, tillering, and bloom periods, conducted
   bi-weekly counts of eggs and larvae to assess colonization by wild
   monarchs, and evaluated suitability for growth of monarch larvae. We
   also quantified bee visitation and compared the bee assemblages
   associated with six of the eight species, augmented with additional
   collections from other sites. Monarchs rapidly colonized the gardens,
   but did not equally use all of the milkweed species. More eggs and
   larvae were found on taller, broad-leaved milkweeds, but there was
   relatively little difference in larval performance, suggesting
   ovipositional preference for more apparent plants. Asclepias tuberosa
   and A. fascicularis attracted the greatest number of bees, whereas bee
   genus diversity was greatest on A. verticillata, A. fascicularis, and A.
   tuberosa. Milkweeds that do not spread extensively by tillering may be
   best suited for managed gardens. Combining milkweeds that are preferred
   by ovipositing monarchs with ones that are particularly attractive to
   bees may enhance conservation value of small urban gardens.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change impact species richness and functional diversity (FD).
   In the Brazilian Amazon, we examined the impacts of oil palm plantations
   on orchid bee (Apidae: Euglossini) species using abundance and FD. We
   collected male orchid bees in oil palm plantation (PALM), legal reserves
   (LR), and riparian corridors (APP), and then we used morphological and
   life-history traits to characterize each species. We evaluated
   differences in bee body size by comparing intertegular span values. We
   tested the influence of habitat on taxonomic and functional parameters
   of orchid bees by applying a partial redundancy analysis (pRDA). We
   contrasted FD by calculating species richness, functional richness, and
   functional dispersion. We sampled 1176 bees from 30 species in 18
   sampling days across 2015 and 2016. Males from PALM were 13.6\% bigger
   than those in LR areas, and bees from APP showed a similar pattern
   compared to LR and PALM. Less than 15\% of the variation in species
   composition was related to the distance among sampling sites, and 8\%
   was due to habitat structure. In our pRDA, the spatial difference
   explained 6\% of the variation in orchid bee traits, but there were no
   effects of habitat parameters upon FD. FD was reduced with land use
   change caused by oil palm plantations. Our findings support the belief
   that many bees are impacted by cultivated lands. Nevertheless, the

Abstract = {{Orchid bees are important pollinators in tropical forests. Although
   studies have already detected effects of habitat loss and forest
   fragmentation on bee assemblages, little is known about orchid bees in
   urban forest fragments. The aim of this study was to analyse the
   influence of forest fragments (size and edge index) and landscape
   features (forest cover area and built-up area around the forest
   fragments, connectivity and spatial distance from the urban center) on
   the abundance, richness and composition of orchid bees. Male bees were
   attracted by odoriferous baits and collected in ten forest fragments of
   different sizes. In total, we collected 3166 male bees belonging to 4
   genera and 38 species. The increase of the built-up area and the
   reduction of the forest cover area around the forest fragments decreased
   the abundance and richness of bees. We recorded a smaller number of bees
   in areas closer to the urban center. We failed to find a significant
   relationship between abundance/richness of bees and forest fragment
   area, edge index, and connectivity. We observed that the faunistic
   dissimilarity was positively correlated with the geographic distance
   between forest fragments. The forest fragments that presented greater
   landscape dissimilarity also presented greater faunistic dissimilarity.
   Our results suggest that the matrix structure around the forest
   fragments is an important factor that influences the Euglossini bee
   assemblages inside these forest fragments. Based on our results, we

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification leads to large-scale loss of habitats
   offering food and nesting sites for bees. This has resulted in a severe
   decline of wild bee diversity and abundance during the past decades.
   There is an urgent need for cost-effective conservation measures to
   mitigate this decline. We analysed the impact of five different
   high-quality habitats on species richness and abundance of wild bees in
   a complex landscape of north-western Switzerland at six sites. The five
   habitat types included 45 plots situated on eight organic farms and were
   composed of 16 low-input meadows, six low-input pastures, seven
   herbaceous strips adjacent to hedges, five sown flower strips and eleven
   organic cereal fields. All of them are financially subsidised by the
   Swiss agri-environmental scheme. Wild bees were sampled between the end
   of April and end of August 2014 by using trio-pan traps and
   complementary sweep netting on these five habitat types. On 45 plots we
   recorded 3973 bee specimens, belonging to 91 species, 16 of which are
   red listed, revealing a high bee species richness in the study area.
   Wild bee species richness and abundance were best explained by habitat
   type, number of flowering plants and site. A strong relationship of
   increasing number of flowering plants and bee species richness and
   abundance was found. Grassland habitats, especially low-input meadows,
   harboured the highest species richness and abundances. Organic cereal
   fields showed a potential to conserve bee species relevant to nature
   conservation (harbouring exclusively two red list species and four rare
   species). Ordination analysis of the bee communities showed a relative
   dissimilarity between the habitat types and indicates their
   complementary effects to benefit the diversity of wild bees. Our results
   demonstrate that a matrix of low-input habitats are needed to sustain
   rich assemblages of wild bees in agroecosystems.}},

   species, to ecosystem) and understanding that human well-being is a
   two-way process of caring for nature nature providing a well-being
   platform for us. However, human relationships with nature are complex,

Abstract = {{Body size latitudinal clines have been widley explained by the
   Bergmann's rule in homeothermic vertebrates. However, there is no
   general consensus in poikilotherms organisms in particular in insects
   that represent the large majority of wildlife. Among them, bees are a
   highly diverse pollinators group with high economic and ecological
   value. Nevertheless, no comprehensive studies of species assemblages at
   a phylogenetically larger scale have been carried out even if they could
   identify the traits and the ecological conditions that generate
   different patterns of latitudinal size variation. We aimed to test
   Bergmann's rule for wild bees by assessing relationships between body
   size and latitude at continental and community levels. We tested our
   hypotheses for bees showing different life history traits (i.e.
   sociality and nesting behaviour). We used 142 008 distribution records
   of 615 bee species at 50 x 50 km (CGRS) grids across the West
   Palearctic. We then applied generalized least squares fitted linear
   model (GLS) to assess the relationship between latitude and mean body
   size of bees, taking into account spatial autocorrelation. For all bee
   species grouped, mean body size increased with higher latitudes, and so
   followed Bergmann's rule. However, considering bee genera separately,
   four genera were consistent with Bergmann's rule, while three showed a
   converse trend, and three showed no significant cline. All life history
   traits used here (i.e. solitary, social and parasitic behaviour; ground
   and stem nesting behaviour) displayed a Bergmann's cline. In general
   there is a main trend for larger bees in colder habitats, which is

Abstract = {{Through the rapid expansion worldwide of impervious areas and habitat
   fragmentation, urbanization has strong consequences that must be
   understood to efficiently manage biodiversity. We studied the effects of
   urbanization on flower-feeding insects by using data from a citizen
   science program in the Parisian region. We analysed the occurrence of
   insects from 46 different families on flowers of different morphologies,
   using landscape indices in buffer areas from a 100-m to a 4000-m radius
   around 1194 sampled sites. Our aims were to determine (i) how the
   proportion of impervious area around sampled sites affected the
   occurrence of flower-feeding insect families and at which landscape
   scales impervious area calculations best predicted these occurrences;
   (ii) the effect of corolla shape variables on insect family occurrences.
   Twenty-one families were negatively impacted by increasing proportion of
   impervious areas (urbanophobic) and 3 were positively impacted
   (urbanophilic). Urbanophobic families were most affected by the
   proportion of impervious areas when it was estimated within buffers of
   200-m to 1400-m radii, depending on the family. Notable losses of
   urbanophobic families were detected at less than 50\% of impervious
   areas, which highlights the threat to the diversity of flower-feeding
   insects posed by urban sprawl. Corolla shape variables were the
   variables most often significantly implicated in the occurrence of
   insect families. Urbanophobic families were negatively affected by the
   tubular shape of flowers, and tubular corollas were found more often in
   urbanized areas. These results suggest that flora management might be a
   key component for the conservation of insect diversity in cities.}},

   bees may be less likely to persist in small fragments. Lastly, we found
   reductions in the abundance of eusocial stingless bees visiting flowers

Abstract = {{Andrena is a large genus of bees primarily distributed across the

   diets of many Nearctic Andrena remain incompletely resolved. The pollen
   diets of 50 species of Andrena found in Michigan were characterized
   using light microscopy. Twenty-four species (48\%) were classified as
   pollen specialists, collecting pollen from one botanical family. The
   remaining 26 species (52\%) were classified as pollen generalists,
   collecting from many botanical families. Andrena species fell into three
   broad foraging groups: (1) spring-flying species foraging predominantly
   from woody plants; (2) spring-flying species specializing on herbaceous
   ephemerals; and (3) summer-flying species specializing on herbaceous
   prairie plant species. Species of Nearctic Andrena specialized on
   pollens from Asteraceae, Geraniaceae, Hydrophyllaceae and Montiaceae or
   avoided them almost entirely. Botanical families that hosted specialized
   bees showed a higher variation in utilization by the Andrena community
   than botanical families without specialists. In contrast, Palaearctic
   species showed little temporal partitioning and low variation in the

Abstract = {{Floral foraging resources are valuable for pollinator conservation on

   pollinator groups such as solitary bees exploit and benefit from these
   resources is unclear. We used high-throughput sequencing of 164 pollen
   samples extracted from the brood cells of six common cavity-nesting
   solitary bee species (Osmia bicornis, Osmia caerulescens, Megachile
   versicolor, Megachile ligniseca, Megachile centuncularis and Hylaeus
   confusus) which are widely distributed across the UK and Europe. We
   documented their pollen use across 19 farms in southern England, UK,
   revealing their forage plants and examining the structure of their
   pollen transport networks. Of the 32 plant species included currently in
   sown wildflower mixes, 15 were recorded as present within close foraging
   range of the bees on the study farms, but only Ranunculus acris L. was

   commonly found of the 23 plant species identified in the pollen samples,
   suggesting that, in addition to providing a nesting resource for
   Megachile leafcutter bees, it may be an important forage plant for these
   species. Higher levels of connectance and nestedness were characteristic
   of pollen transport networks on farms with abundant floral resources,
   which may increase resilience to species loss. Our data suggest that
   plant species promoted currently by agri-environment schemes are not
   optimal for solitary bee foraging. If a diverse community of pollinators
   is to be supported on UK and European farmland, additional species such

   two varieties that are different from other peaches: `Daifei' and

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many mutualisms are taken advantage of by organisms that take rewards
   from their partners but provide no benefit in return. In the absence of
   traits that limit exploitation, facultative exploiters (partners that
   can either exploit or cooperate) are widely predicted by mutualism
   theory to choose an exploitative strategy, potentially threatening
   mutualism stability. However, it is unknown whether facultative
   exploiters choose to exploit, and, if so, make this choice because it is
   the most beneficial strategy for them. We explored these questions in a
   subalpine plant-insect community in which individuals of several bumble
   bee species visit flowers both ``legitimately{''} (entering via the
   flower opening, picking up and depositing pollen, and hence behaving
   mutualistically) and via nectar robbing (creating holes through corollas
   or using an existing hole, bypassing stigmas and anthers). We applied
   foraging theory to (1) quantify handling costs, benefits and foraging
   efficiencies incurred by three bumble bee species as they visited
   flowers legitimately or robbed nectar in cage experiments, and (2)
   determine whether these efficiencies matched the food handling tactics
   these bee species employed in the field. Relative efficiencies of
   legitimate and robbing tactics depended on the combination of bee and
   plant species. In some cases (Bombus mixtus visiting Corydalis caseana
   or Mertensia ciliata), the robbing tactic permitted more efficient
   nectar removal. As both mutualism and foraging theory would predict, in
   the field, B. mixtus visiting C. caseana were observed more frequently
   robbing than foraging legitimately. However, for Bombus flavifrons
   visiting M. ciliata, the expectation from mutualism theory did not hold:
   legitimate visitation was the more efficient tactic. Legitimate
   visitation to M. ciliata was in fact more frequently observed in
   free-flying B. flavifrons. Free-flying B. mixtus also frequently visited
   M. ciliata flowers legitimately. This may reflect lower nectar volumes
   in robbed than unrobbed flowers in the field. These results suggest that
   a foraging ecology perspective is informative to the choice of tactics
   facultative exploiters make. In contrast, the simple expectation that
   exploiters should always have an advantage, and hence could threaten
   mutualism persistence unless they are deterred or punished, may not be
   broadly applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-mediated pollination is essential for the production and quality
   of fruits and seeds of many crops consumed by humans. However, crop
   pollination services might be compromised when wild pollinators are
   scarce. Managed pollinators are commonly used in crops to supplement
   such services with the assumption that they will enhance crop yield.
   However, information on the spatiotemporal pollinator-dependence of
   crops is still limited. We assessed the contribution of commercial
   bumble bee colonies compared to the available pollinator community on
   strawberry ('Fortuna' variety) flower visitation and strawberry quality
   across a landscape gradient of agricultural intensification (i.e.
   polytunnel berry crop cover). We used colonies of bumble bees in winter
   and in spring, i.e. when few and most wild pollinators are in their
   flight period, respectively. The placement of colonies increased visits
   of bumble bees to strawberry flowers, especially in winter. The use of
   bumble bee colonies did not affect flower visitation by other insects,
   mainly honey bees, hoverflies and other Diptera. Flower visitation by
   both honey bees and wild insects did not vary between seasons and was
   unrelated to the landscape gradient of berry crop cover. Strawberries
   were of the highest quality (i.e. weight) when insect-mediated
   pollination was allowed, and their quality was positively related to
   wild flower visitors in winter but not in spring. However, increased
   visits to strawberry flowers by managed bumble bees and honey bees had
   no effect on strawberry weight. Our results suggest that the pollination
   services producing high quality strawberry fruits are provided by the
   flower visitor community present in the study region without the need to
   use managed bumble bees. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published

Abstract = {{Pollinators search for multiple flora resources throughout their life

   cues in the context of nectar foraging. In the present study, we sought
   to elucidate whether oil-collecting bees discriminate flowers of
   Byrsonima variabilis (Malpighiaceae) with petals of different colours
   when foraging for pollen or oil. As the colour of the standard petal
   changes during anthesis, we characterised the spectral reflectance
   patterns of flowers throughout anthesis and modelled chromatic
   perceptual space to determine how these colour patterns are perceived by
   bees. Through the quantification of flower pollen in the different
   phases, we found that the colour of the standard petal is an honest cue
   of the presence of pollen. Centridine bees preferentially visited
   flowers with a yellow (bee's green) colour when searching for pollen,
   but indiscriminately visited flowers with different petal colours when
   searching for floral oil. We suggest that standard petals, in the
   species studied and others of the genus, like nectar guides, act as
   pollen guides, which oil-collecting females use to detect pollen-rich
   flowers. Moreover, they use different floral clues during foraging for
   different resources in the same host plant.}},

Abstract = {{Floral scent is an important component of the trait repertoire of
   flowering plants, which is used to attract and manipulate pollinators.
   Despite advances during the last decades about the chemicals released by
   flowers, there is still a large gap in our understanding of chemical
   communication between flowering plants and their pollinators. We
   analyzed floral scents of guarana (Paullinia cupana, Sapindaceae), an
   economically important plant of the Amazon, using chemical analytical
   approaches, and determined the attractiveness of the scent to its
   nocturnal bee pollinators using behavioral assays in the field. Pollen
   loads of attracted bees were also analyzed. Inflorescences of guarana
   emit strong scents, both during day and at night, with some
   semi-quantitative differences between day-and night-time scents.
   Synthetic scent mixtures containing some of the identified floral scent
   components, including the most abundant ones, i.e., linalool and
   (E)-beta-ocimene, successfully attracted the nocturnal Megalopta bee
   pollinators. Pollen analyses revealed that many of the attracted bees
   had pollen grains from previous visits to guarana flowers on their
   bodies. Overall, our data show that guarana flowers attract nocturnal
   bee visitors by their strong scents and suggest that the chemical
   communication between this plant and its pollinators is a key component
   in crop production of this economically important plant species.}},

Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is altering the phenology of trophically linked
   organisms, leading to increased asynchrony between species with unknown
   consequences for ecosystem services. Although phenological mismatches
   are reported from several ecosystems, experimental evidence for altering
   multiple ecosystem services is hardly available. We examined how the
   phenological shift of apple trees affected the abundance and diversity
   of pollinators, generalist and specialist herbivores and predatory
   arthropods. We stored potted apple trees in the greenhouse or cold store
   in early spring before transferring them into orchards to cause
   mismatches and sampled arthropods on the trees repeatedly. Assemblages
   of pollinators on the manipulated and control trees differed markedly,
   but their overall abundance was similar indicating a potential insurance
   effect of wild bee diversity to ensure fruit set in flower-pollinator
   mismatch conditions. Specialized herbivores were almost absent from
   manipulated trees, while less-specialized ones showed diverse responses,
   confirming the expectation that more specialized interactions are more
   vulnerable to phenological mismatch. Natural enemies also responded to
   shifted apple tree phenology and the abundance of their prey. While
   arthropod abundances either declined or increased, species diversity
   tended to be lower on apple trees with shifted phenology. Our study
   indicates novel results on the role of biodiversity and specialization
   in plant-insect mismatch situations.}},

Volume = {{285}},

Abstract = {{Widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides, such as imidacloprid, is
   often associated with diminishing populations of bees; this loss of
   pollinators presents a concern for food security and may cause
   unpredictable changes in ecological networks. However, little is known
   about the potential behavioural mechanisms behind the
   neonicotinoid-associated pollinator decline. We quantified the effects
   of low-dose (1 ppb) imidacloprid exposure on the foraging behaviour of
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Individual bumblebees were released into
   a flight arena containing three patches of robotic flowers whose colour
   (yellow, orange, blue) indicated whether the flower delivered a reward
   (sugar solution). Exposure to imidacloprid had no significant effect on
   measures of bumblebee physical performance (such as flight speed) or
   learning (identifying rewarding flowers). However, pesticide-treated
   bumblebees had reduced foraging motivation compared with the control
   bumblebees, as they visited fewer robotic flowers, were slower to start
   foraging and did not visit all three flower colours as often.
   Neonicotinoid concentrations of 1 ppb, often reported in plant nectar
   near agricultural lands, can thus affect the foraging behaviour of
   bumblebees Even without a notable impact on flight performance and
   learning, a reduction in foraging motivation could explain the poor
   performance of colonies of bumblebees exposed to neonicotinoids.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen and seed dispersal patterns greatly influence the spatial
   distribution of plant genetic diversity. Microsatellite-based parentage
   analysis provides accurate estimates of contemporary gene dispersal.
   Although most tropical trees have been shown to exhibit widespread
   pollen dispersal, few studies have estimated contemporary gene dispersal
   after seedling establishment. Bertholletia excelsa (Lecythidaceae) is
   pollinated by large-bodied bees, while previous seed-tracking
   experiments suggest their seeds are mainly dispersed across very short
   distances by scatter-hoarding rodents, who primarily act as seed
   predators. Here we used parentage analysis to provide contemporary
   estimates of pollen and seed dispersal in B. excelsa recruits. We
   examined six 25-ha plots located in two natural stands in the Acre River
   valley, in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon. We used 11 microsatellite
   markers to estimate genetic diversity and fixation index parameters in
   adults, seedlings and saplings. Genetic diversity was moderate and did
   not differ across size classes or sampling locations. We assigned pollen
   and seed parents for < 20\% of the recruits, indicating that most events
   of realized gene flow occurred beyond our 25-ha plots. Only 10 parentage
   assignments were confirmed with 80\% confidence. Pollen distance ranged
   from 33 to 372 m and seed dispersal from 58 to 655 m. Actual
   seed-dispersal distances were far greater than the estimates obtained in
   previous seed-tracking experiments. Thus, studies encompassing larger
   sampling areas are necessary to determine a more representative spatial
   scale of B. excelsa's pollen and seed dispersal capacity in natural
   stands.}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Wildfire changes the demography, morphology, and
   behavior of plants, and may alter the pollinator community. Such trait
   changes may drastically alter the outcome of pollination mutualisms on
   plants; however, the direct role of fire on these mutualisms is poorly
   known.
   METHODS: Following a pair of fires in the northern California coast
   range chaparral, we censused floral visitor communities of Trichostema
   laxum (Lamiaceae), quantified visiting bee behavior, and estimated
   outcrossing rates using a widespread Mendelian recessive floral
   polymorphism across a matrix of populations in burned and unburned
   sites. We also compared pre- and postfire floral visitation in two
   populations.
   RESULTS: Outcrossing rates were significantly lower in burned areas;
   however, our data suggest that the much larger size of plants in burned
   areas, not burn status itself, drove this pattern. Large-bodied bees
   dominated floral visitor communities after fire, likely recruiting to
   the abundant postfire floral resources. These bees visited more flowers
   per plant than did the smaller bees prevalent before fire and in
   unburned areas, likely increasing selfing through geitonogamy
   (within-plant pollination), an effect made possible by the far larger
   size of plants in burned areas.
   CONCLUSIONS: Outcrossing rates dropped substantially after wildfires
   because of changes in the pollinators, plant display size, and their
   interactions. Reductions in outcrossing following fire may have
   important implications for population resilience and evolution in a
   changing climate with more frequent fires.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and abundance of insect pollinators are declining. This
   decline reduces the potential ecosystem services of pollination for wild
   and cultivated plants. Specific agri-environment schemes (AES) are
   subsidised to support and conserve biodiversity in farmlands. In
   Belgium, the pollinator flower-strips AES, strips of flower-rich hay
   meadows, has been promoted as a potential scheme to increase pollinator
   abundance and diversity, even if their effectiveness has not been
   locally evaluated. The main objective of this research is to assess the
   capacity of pollinator-strip AES to provide flower-resources to diverse
   pollinators. During 2 years, we monthly measured the availability of
   flower resources (pollen and nectar) produced on four flower-strips
   surrounded by intensive farming in Belgium. We counted and identified
   insects that visited these flowers, and we constructed the plant-insect
   interactions networks. The pollinator-strip AES presented a mix of both
   sown and spontaneous plant species. The ten sown plant species were all
   present, even after 8 years of strip settings. Three of them, Centaurea
   jacea, Lotus corniculatus, and Daucus carota were mainly visited for
   nectar collection, and a spontaneous non-sown species, Trifolium repens,
   had a key role in providing high-quality pollen to insects. Most of the
   observed flower-visiting insects belonged to common species of
   Hymenoptera and Diptera. All are considered highly efficient
   pollinators. The Belgian pollinator flower-strips are effective AES that
   provide flower resources to pollinators, mainly during summer and
   support pollination services. Nevertheless, spring and autumn flower
   resources remain poor and could reduce the strips' effectiveness for
   supporting long-term insect diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Anthropogenic landscape change, such as urbanization, can affect
   community structure and ecological interactions. Furthermore, changes in
   ambient temperature and resource availability due to urbanization may
   affect migratory and non-migratory species differently. However, the
   response of migratory species to urbanization is poorly investigated,
   and knowledge for invertebrates in particular is lacking. Our aim was to
   investigate whether there was a shift in community structure and
   phenology of hoverflies in urban landscapes, depending on migratory
   status.
   Location: Switzerland.
   Methods: Using a paired design, we compared urban and rural landscapes
   to investigate the impact of urbanization on the abundance, diversity
   and phenology of hoverflies. Furthermore, we tested whether migratory
   and non-migratory species responded differently to urbanization.
   Results: We observed a difference in the response of migratory and
   non-migratory hoverfly communities. Although the abundance of hoverflies
   was higher in the rural ecosystem, driven by a high abundance of
   migratory species, there was no difference in species richness between
   the land use types. However, the community structure of non-migratory
   species was significantly different between urban and rural ecosystems.
   The phenology of hoverflies differed between the two ecosystems, with an
   earlier appearance in the year of migratory species in urban landscapes.
   Main conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   investigate the response of migratory insect communities to
   urbanization. We demonstrated that migratory and non-migratory
   hoverflies respond differently to urbanization. This highlights the
   importance of differentiating between trait and mobility groups to
   understand community assemblage patterns in anthropogenic landscapes.
   The differences in phenology supports the growing evidence that
   urbanization not only affects the phenology of vegetation, but also
   affects the higher trophic levels. Changes in the phenology and
   community composition of species as a result of anthropogenic landscape
   change may have important implications for the maintenance of key
   ecosystem functions, such as pollination.}},

Abstract = {{At a microscopic scale, the shape and fine cell relief of the petal
   epidermal cells of a flower play a key role in its interaction with
   pollinators. In particular, conical shaped petal epidermal cells have
   been shown to have an important function in providing grip on the
   surface of bee-pollinated flowers and can influence bee visitation
   rates. Previous studies have explored interspecific variation in this
   trait within genera and families, but naturally-occurring intraspecific
   variation has not yet been comprehensively studied. Here, we investigate
   petal epidermal cell morphology in 32 genotypes of the crop Vicia faba,
   which has a yield highly dependent on pollinators. We hypothesise that
   conical cells may have been lost in some genotypes as a consequence of
   selective sweeps or genetic drift during breeding programmes. We find
   that 13\% of our lines have a distribution of conical petal epidermal
   cells that deviates from that normally seen in V. faba flowers. These
   abnormal phenotypes were specific to the ad/abaxial side of petals,
   suggesting that these changes are the result of altered gene expression

Abstract = {{Climate change is predicted to result in increased occurrence and
   intensity of drought in many regions worldwide. By increasing plant
   physiological stress, drought is likely to affect the floral resources
   (flowers, nectar and pollen) that are available to pollinators. However,
   little is known about impacts of drought at the community level, nor
   whether plant community functional composition influences these impacts.
   To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the impacts of drought
   on floral resources in calcareous grassland. Drought was simulated using
   rain shelters and the impacts were explored at multiple scales and on
   four different experimental plant communities varying in functional
   trait composition. First, we investigated the effects of drought on
   nectar production of three common wildflower species (Lathyrus
   pratensis, Onobrychis viciifolia and Prunella vulgaris). In the drought
   treatment, L.pratensis and P.vulgaris had a lower proportion of flowers
   containing nectar and O.viciifolia had fewer flowers per raceme. Second,
   we measured the effects of drought on the diversity and abundance of
   floral resources across plant communities. Drought reduced the abundance
   of floral units for all plant communities, irrespective of functional
   composition, and reduced floral species richness for two of the
   communities. Functional diversity did not confer greater resistance to
   drought in terms of maintaining floral resources, probably because the
   effects of drought were ubiquitous across component plant communities.
   The findings indicate that drought has a substantial impact on the
   availability of floral resources in calcareous grassland, which will
   have consequences for pollinator behaviour and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator declines have motivated efforts to plant nectar and host

   established garden plots to determine whether plant type (native vs.

Abstract = {{1. Green tree retention and prescribed burning are the practices used to
   mitigate negative effects of boreal forestry. Beside their effects on
   biodiversity, these practices should also promote non-timber forest
   products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree
   retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry,
   Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea; (2) if there
   are synergies or trade-offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation
   to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of
   forest-dwelling species.
   2. We used a long-term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three
   different harvesting treatments: clear-cut logging, logging with
   retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without
   prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we
   scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats
   within these treatments, while species richness data for five species
   groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic
   beetles, pollinators-here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the
   stand level.
   3. Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing
   in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry
   production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects
   slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower
   compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry
   production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry
   production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the
   effect was neutral.
   4. No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all
   values-NTFPs and richness-and trade-offs among values were common. Only
   bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention
   forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed
   burning favoured many values when performed in combination with
   retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment
   combinations favoured different species groups.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely
   applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to
   benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is
   desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade-offs
   among values, may be more appropriate than the stand-scale conservation
   practices commonly practiced today.}},

Abstract = {{1. In many parts of the world, farmland pollinators decreased
   significantly during the last half of the 20th century mainly due to
   land-use changes and agricultural intensification.
   2. We studied the effect of different typical crop rotations and
   agri-environment schemes (AES) on bumblebee diversity in Estonia. We
   compared species abundances between four crop rotation types (cereal
   rollover {[}no change from 1 year to the next], cereal to mass-flowering
   crops {[}hereafter MFC], MFC rollover and MFC to cereal fields) where
   all counts were conducted in the second year and in three farming types
   (conventional farming, organic farming and environmentally friendly
   management).
   3. We surveyed bumblebees and flower cover along 401 field margins in
   five consecutive years and recorded 20 species and more than 6,000
   individuals. Abundances of long-tongued and threatened bumblebee species
   were higher at the field margins of cereal rollover fields than for the
   other three crop rotation types. In addition, cereal rollover field
   margins had higher abundances of medium colony species, generalists and
   forest-scrub species than MFC rollover and MFC to cereal or cereal to
   MFC field margins. Bumblebee species richness was higher at the field
   margins of both AES types than those of conventional farming. However,
   in general, the strongest driver of bumblebee presence was flower cover.
   4. Higher bumblebee abundances in cereal rollover field margins were
   probably owing to a concentration effect there and/or a dilution effect
   into MFC fields. Both AES schemes supported increasing flower cover in
   field margins and thereby diversity of bumblebees, indicating positive
   AES impacts upon wild pollinators.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Crop rotation and agri-environment
   schemes determine bumblebee richness and abundance via the availability
   of flower resources, but crop rotation constrains bumblebees differently
   based on their traits. Therefore, future agri-environmental policy
   should account for these management options. Crop rotation could be a
   simple, but efficient solution to increase the biodiversity of
   agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{1. The acai palm Euterpe oleracea Mart. in the Amazon river delta has
   seen rapid expansion to meet increased demand for its fruit. This has
   been achieved by transforming lowland forest habitats (floodplains) into
   simplified agroforests and intensive plantation in upland areas. As acai
   palm makes an important contribution to the economy and food security of
   local communities, identifying management approaches that support
   biodiversity and ecosystem processes that underpin fruit production on
   acai farms is essential.
   2. We compared flower-visitor communities and acai fruit production in
   floodplain forests and upland plantations, across gradients of local
   management intensity (i.e. acai density per ha) and surrounding forest
   cover. The relative contribution of biotic pollination and degree of
   pollen limitation were assessed using insect exclusion and
   hand-pollination experiments.
   3. We found that acai flower visitors are highly diverse (c. 200
   distinct taxa) and had variable responses to disturbance. Bee visitation
   was higher in floodplains and positively related to surrounding forest
   cover, but other flower visitors, including specialised curculionid
   beetles, were unresponsive to changes in surrounding forest cover.
   However, intensive management practices (i.e. high acai palm densities)
   in floodplains and uplands had contrasting effects on flower-visitor
   communities, with flower-visitor richness being lower on intensively
   managed floodplain farms and ant densities being higher on intensive
   upland farms.
   4. Pollination experiments revealed acai palm to be highly dependent on
   biotic pollination. Fruit set in open-pollinated inflorescences was
   positively related to flower-visitor richness and specialised
   curculionid beetle visitation, whereas the presence of ants on
   inflorescences had a negative effect.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that pollinators are
   essential for acai fruit production, but that intensive farming
   practices have eroded the relationship between surrounding forest cover
   and ecosystem function in floodplains (i.e. conversion of native forest
   into simplified agroforests) and increased the frequency of antagonistic
   interactions in uplands (e.g. high ant densities). These findings
   underline the value of extensive management practices, such as the
   maintenance of other tree species within farms and adjacent unmanaged
   forest patches, to ensure the long-term sustainability of acai fruit
   production in the Amazon river delta.}},

Abstract = {{1. Large flower plantings are often used to combat negative effects of
   habitat loss on pollinators, but whether these floral additions are
   effective at smaller scales remains unclear, particularly in urban
   settings.
   2. To test the effectiveness of small-scale floral additions on
   enhancing urban bee populations, as well as their impact from 1 year to
   the next, different quantities of potted sweet alyssum (Lobularia
   maritima) flowers were placed across sites in Ann Arbor, Michigan for
   two consecutive years and the resulting Halictid bee visitors were
   monitored.
   3. Overall, we found the number of flowers added at the local level was
   significantly and positively correlated with small Halictid bee
   abundance and species density in an urban landscape. At smaller flower
   quantities, dynamics were clearly linear, where incremental increases in
   number of flowers showed significant increases in bee abundance and
   species density. At larger quantities of floral additions, however,
   dynamics were nonlinear in that incremental increases in flower quantity
   had no effect on bee abundance and highly variable effects on bee
   species density.
   4. When comparing the change in small Halictid bee abundance and species
   density from 1 year to the next, we found a significant increase in bee
   species density in the second year of small-scale floral additions, but
   no significant difference in bee abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that small flower
   plantings can have positive effects on small bee communities in urban
   systems even over a short period of time and therefore confirm that
   encouraging citizens to plant flowers can be an effective conservation
   strategy for certain urban pollinator populations. In addition, our
   finding that smaller flower plantings may have higher impacts on small
   pollinators than larger plantings suggests resource managers interested
   in pollinator conservation should consider spreading multiple, smaller
   floral plantings across the urban landscape, rather than pooling all
   resources into one large flower patch.}},

Abstract = {{Structures such as nests and burrows are an essential component of many
   organisms' life-cycle and require a complex sequence of behaviours.
   Because behaviours can vary consistently among individuals and be
   correlated with one another, we hypothesized that these structures would
   (1) show evidence of among-individual variation, (2) be organized into
   distinct functional modules and (3) show evidence of trade-offs among
   functional modules due to limits on energy budgets. We tested these
   hypotheses using the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata, a
   solitary bee and important crop pollinator. Megachile rotundata
   constructs complex nests by gathering leaf materials to form a linear
   series of cells in pre-existing cavities. In this study, we examined
   variation in the following nest construction traits: reproduction
   (number of cells per nest and nest length), nest protection (cap length
   and number of leaves per cap), cell construction (cell size and number
   of leaves per cell) and cell provisioning (cell mass) from 60 nests. We
   found a general decline in investment in cell construction and
   provisioning with each new cell built. In addition, we found evidence
   for both repeatability and plasticity in cell provisioning with little
   evidence for trade-offs among traits. Instead, most traits were
   positively, albeit weakly, correlated (r0.15), and traits were loosely
   organized into covarying modules. Our results show that individual
   differences in nest construction are detectable at a level similar to
   that of other behavioural traits and that these traits are only weakly
   integrated. This suggests that nest components are capable of
   independent evolutionary trajectories.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of fluctuating thermal
   regimes in insect cold tolerance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Insects exposed to low temperature often have high mortality or exhibit
   sublethal effects. A growing number of recent studies have shown
   beneficial effects of exposing insects to recurrent brief warm pulses
   during low-temperature stress (fluctuating thermal regime, FTR). The
   physiological underpinnings of the beneficial effects of FTR on cold
   survival have been extensively studied over the past few years.
   Profiling with various `-omics' techniques has provided supporting
   evidence for different physiological responses between insects exposed
   to FTR and constant low temperature. Evidence from transcriptomic,
   metabolomic and lipidomic studies points to a system-wide loss of
   homeostasis at low temperature that can be counterbalanced by repair
   mechanisms under FTR. Although there has been considerable progress in
   understanding the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial
   effects of FTR, here we discuss how many areas still lack clarity, such
   as the precise role(s) of heat shock proteins, compatible solutes or the
   identification of regulators and key players involved in the observed
   homeostatic responses. FTR can be particularly beneficial in applied
   settings, such as for model insects used in research, integrated pest
   management and pollination services. We also explain how the application
   of FTR techniques in large-scale facilities may require overcoming some
   logistical and technical constraints. FTR definitively enhances survival
   at low temperature in insects, but before it can be widely used, we
   suggest that the possible fitness and energy costs of FTR must be
   explored more thoroughly. Although FTR is not ecologically relevant,
   similar processes may operate in settings where temperatures fluctuate
   naturally.}},

Abstract = {{1. Declining pollinator populations have caused concern about
   consequences for food production, and have initiated an increasing
   number of initiatives that aim to mitigate pollinator loss through
   enhancement of floral resources. Studies evaluating effects of
   mitigation measures generally demonstrate positive responses of
   pollinators to floral resource enhancement. However, it remains unclear
   whether this represents landscape-level population effects or results
   from a spatial redistribution of individuals from otherwise unaffected
   populations.
   2. Here, we present a method for estimating landscape-level population
   effects using data from commonly used standardized pollinator transect
   surveys. The approach links local density responses of pollinators in
   both mitigation sites and surrounding landscape elements to the area
   these habitats occupy in mitigation landscapes as well as control
   landscapes to obtain landscape-level population estimates.
   3. We demonstrate the method using data from a 2-year study examining
   the effects of experimental wildflower enhancements on wild bumblebees
   and solitary bees in Dutch agricultural landscapes. The results show
   that conclusions based on local responses may differ significantly from
   those based on landscape-level responses.
   4. Wildflower enhancements significantly enhanced landscape-level
   abundance of both bumblebees and solitary bees. Bumblebees showed a
   pronounced positive local density response in mitigation sites and the
   surrounding landscape that was in line with significant landscape-level
   increases in abundance. However, solitary bees showed no local response
   to mitigation sites, and the landscape-level increases in abundance only
   became apparent when the area of bee habitat was taken into account.
   5. Incorporating the area of both newly created and pre-existing
   pollinator habitats into effect estimates accounts for density-dependent
   processes such as dilution, spillover and local concentration of
   individuals. It, therefore, results in more reliable estimates of the
   response to mitigation measures of pollinators, as well as other mobile
   arthropod groups that are often being surveyed using transect surveys.}},

Abstract = {{The Apoidea represent a large and common superfamily of the Hymenoptera

   used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships. Twelve apoid
   mitochondrial genomes were newly sequenced, representing six families
   and nine subfamilies. Gene rearrangement events have occurred in all
   apoid mitochondrial genomes sequenced to date. Sphecid wasps have both
   tRNA and protein-coding gene rearrangements in 5 of 8 species. In bees,
   the only rearranged genes are tRNAs; long-tongued bees
   (Apidae+Megachilidae) are characterized by movement of trnA to the
   trnI-trnQ-trnM tRNA cluster. Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial gene
   sequences support the known paraphyly of sphecid wasps, with bees nested
   within this clade. The Ampulicidae is sister to the remaining Apoidea.
   Crabronidae is paraphyletic, split into Crabronidae s.s. and
   Philanthidae, with the latter group a sister clade to bees. The
   monophyletic bees are either classified into two clades, long-tongued
   bees (Apidae + Megachilidae) and short-tongued bees (Andrenidae +
   Halictidae + Colletidae + Melitidae), or three groups with the Melitidae
   sister to the other bees. Our study showed that both gene sequences and

Abstract = {{Landscape heterogeneity is an important driver of biodiversity in
   agroecosystems. However, the functional heterogeneity of agricultural
   landscapes, taking into account the different resources that habitat
   patches can provide to species, has rarely been studied. In this study,
   we explored the effect of landscape-scale nest availability provided by
   permanent grasslands on wild bee communities. Wild bees were sampled in
   43 cereal fields in south-western France differing in the surrounding
   proportion of permanent grasslands. Using remote sensing tools, we
   measured two parameters of grassland structure known to locally
   influence bee nest density (slope and proportion of sparse vegetation).
   We found that mean slope of surrounding grasslands was the factor that
   most positively influenced bee richness, abundance and trait
   distribution in bee communities. We also found that mean slope of
   surrounding grasslands had a better predictive power of bee community
   structure than the proportion of permanent grasslands. Ground-nesting
   species, species with high dispersal capacities and species with a
   generalist diet were positively affected by the availability of sloped
   ground in the surrounding permanent grasslands. Only bee species with
   specialized flower requirements responded positively to the proportion
   of sparse vegetation in grasslands. Our results suggest that
   landscape-scale availability of nesting resources provided by grasslands
   affects bee communities in agricultural landscapes and can help sustain
   functionally diverse bee assemblages. Using simple remote sensing tools,
   this study highlights the importance of considering nesting resources in
   agricultural landscapes to maintain wild bee diversity in farmlands.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with crop rotation as a method to improve soil
   fertility and control pests from an economic point of view. It outlines
   a new framework for modelling of more sustainable decision-making of
   farmers under the auspices of ecosystem services. It is intended for
   practical application in extension and farmer communication to show
   values of rotations referring to natural capital. In the past farmers
   created complex rotations to benefit from ecological processes which
   enabled them to control natural pests (at least partly), to build soil
   fertility on recycling of organics (humus formation), and to promote
   pollination (including wild bees and other insects) and water retention
   (diverse water requests of different crops). Farmers which were
   accommodating cropping orders in small parcels of fields used long lists
   of crop sequences and offered mixed farming systems: this was a major
   feature of agriculture. Cropping orders evolved from necessity and were
   followed as rules. Today we are faced with large fields and monoculture,
   instead, and ecosystem services are diminished. Usually, attempts to
   recognize economic pay-offs from rotation through modelling are meagre
   because of complexity. We address the issue of complexity by suggesting
   a new flexible type of modelling crop rotations (dynamic optimization)
   which condenses ecological information into matrices. A newly-hosted
   transfer matrix shall delineate the impacts of cropping patterns in
   period t to fertility of land in t + 1. Categorizing different states of
   nature (which have to be brought in line with farmers' knowledge of
   externalities), it can be implemented in models on rotation decision.}},

Abstract = {{Blumenbachia amana possesses the characteristic `tilt-revolver flowers'
   and the pollen partitioning mechanism found exclusively in Loasoideae.
   Stamens are sheltered in naviculate petals that alternate with five

   staminate phase, stamens move successively towards the centre of the
   flower and present pollen. Bees of oligolectic Actenosigynes
   mantiqueirensis (Colletidae) are the unique effective pollinators.
   Clinching the nectar scale-staminode complex, they bend the scales
   outward one by one with their head to take up nectar, thereby triggering
   the movement of a stamen, which arrives in the centre of the flower
   similar to 3 min after the stimulus. Females returned to previously
   visited flowers after short time intervals by establishing pollen
   foraging routes in flower patches that were maintained for days. In
   flowers experimentally hand-stimulated in the nectar scales to simulate
   pollinator visits, twice as many stamens moved, and the longevity of

Title = {{Can honey bees discriminate between floral-fragrance isomers?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Many flowering plants present variable complex fragrances, which usually
   include different isomers of the same molecule. As fragrance is an
   essential cue for flower recognition by pollinators, we ask whether
   honey bees discriminate between floral-fragrance isomers in an
   appetitive context. We used the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis
   extension response, which allows training a restrained bee to an odor
   paired with sucrose solution. Bees were trained under an absolute (a
   single odorant rewarded) or a differential conditioning regime (a
   rewarded versus a non-rewarded odorant) using four different pairs of
   isomers. One hour after training, discrimination and generalization
   between pairs of isomers were tested. Bees trained under absolute
   conditioning exhibited high generalization between isomers and
   discriminated only one out of four isomer pairs, after differential
   conditioning, they learned to differentiate between two out of four
   pairs of isomers but in all cases generalization responses to the
   non-rewarding isomer remained high. Adding an aversive taste to the
   non-rewarded isomer facilitated discrimination of isomers that otherwise
   seemed non-discriminable but generalization remained high. Although
   honey bees discriminated isomers under certain conditions, they achieved
   the task with difficulty and tended to generalize between them, thus
   showing that these molecules were perceptually similar to them. We
   conclude that the presence of isomers within floral fragrances might not
   necessarily contribute to a dramatic extent to floral odor diversity.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{6827-6838}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{All over the world, pollinators are threatened by land-use change
   involving degradation of seminatural habitats or conversion into
   agricultural land. Such disturbance often leads to lowered pollinator
   abundance and/or diversity, which might reduce crop yield in adjacent
   agricultural areas. For West Africa, changes in bee communities across
   disturbance gradients from savanna to agricultural land are mainly
   unknown. In this study, we monitored for the impact of human disturbance
   on bee communities in savanna and crop fields. We chose three savanna
   areas of varying disturbance intensity (low, medium, and high) in the
   South Sudanian zone of Burkina Faso, based on land-use/land cover data
   via Landsat images, and selected nearby cotton and sesame fields. During
   21months covering two rainy and two dry seasons in 2014 and 2015, we
   captured bees using pan traps. Spatial and temporal patterns of bee
   species abundance, richness, evenness and community structure were
   assessed. In total, 35,469 bee specimens were caught on 12 savanna sites
   and 22 fields, comprising 97 species of 32 genera. Bee abundance was
   highest at intermediate disturbance in the rainy season. Species
   richness and evenness did not differ significantly. Bee communities at
   medium and highly disturbed savanna sites comprised only subsets of
   those at low disturbed sites. An across-habitat spillover of bees
   (mostly abundant social bee species) from savanna into crop fields was
   observed during the rainy season when crops are mass-flowering, whereas
   most savanna plants are not in bloom. Despite disturbance
   intensification, our findings suggest that wild bee communities can
   persist in anthropogenic landscapes and that some species even
   benefitted disproportionally. West African areas of crop production such
   as for cotton and sesame may serve as important food resources for bee
   species in times when resources in the savanna are scarce and receive at
   the same time considerable pollination service.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Recent tissue-level observations made indirectly via
   flow cytometry suggest that endoreplication (duplication of the nuclear
   genome within the nuclear envelope in the absence of subsequent cell
   division) is widespread within the plant kingdom. Here, we also directly
   observe ploidy variation among cells within individual petals. relating
   size of nucleus to cell micromorphology and (more speculatively) to
   function.
   Methods We compared the labella (specialized pollinator-attracting
   petals) of two European orchid genera: Dactylorhiza has a known
   predisposition to organismal polyploidy, whereas Ophrys exhibits
   exceptionally complex epidermal patterning that aids pseudocopulatory
   pollination. Confocal microscopy using multiple staining techniques
   allowed us to observe directly both the sizes and the internal
   structures of individual nuclei across each labellum, while flow
   cytometry was used to test for progressively partial endoreplication.
   Key Results In Dactylorhiza, endoreplication was comparatively
   infrequent, reached only low levels. and appeared randomly located
   across the labellum, whereas in Ophrys endoreplication was commonplace,
   being most frequent in large peripheral trichomes. Endoreplicated nuclei
   reflected both endomitosis and endocycling, the latter reaching the
   third round of genome doubling (16C) to generate polytene nuclei. All
   Ophrys individuals studied exhibited progressively partial
   endoreplication.
   Conclusions Comparison of the two genera failed to demonstrate the
   hypothesized pattern of frequent polyploid speciation in genera showing
   extensive endoreplication. Endoreplication in Ophrys appears more
   strongly positively correlated with cell size/complexity than with cell
   location or secretory role. Epigenetic control of gene overexpression by
   localized induction of endoreplication within individual plant organs
   may represent a significant component of a plant's developmental
   programme, contributing substantially to organ plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{One common goal of habitat restoration and reconstruction is to
   reinstate the biodiversity found at intact reference sites. However, few
   researchers have examined whether these practices reinstate communities
   of flower-visiting insects. This is unfortunate, as anthropogenically
   mediated declines in flower visitors, including bees (the primary
   pollinators for most terrestrial ecosystems), beetles, flies, and
   butterflies, have been reported worldwide. Biodiversity declines may be
   especially severe in North America's tallgrass prairie, a once-vast
   grassland that has experienced severe destruction and degradation due to
   agricultural conversion. As such, we assessed the structure of forb and
   flower-visiting insect communities as a whole and two subsets of the
   flower visitor communitybees and phytophagous beetlesacross five
   tallgrass prairie remnants and five reconstructed prairies (former crop
   fields) in Kansas from 2013 to 2015. Remnant prairies had significantly
   higher forb diversity and differed significantly in forb composition,
   compared to reconstructed prairies. Despite the dissimilarities in forb
   community structure, there were no differences in flower visitor
   diversity or abundance between remnants and reconstructed prairies.
   However, when considered separately, bee communities exhibited
   significantly greater variability in composition on reconstructed
   prairies, likely due to the abundance of generalist bee species visiting
   non-native legumes at two reconstructed prairies. Our work provides
   evidence that prairie habitat reconstruction is a valuable tool for
   reestablishing flower-visiting insect communities and also emphasizes
   the considerable role that non-native species may play in structuring
   grassland plant-bee interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental contamination with neonicotinoid insecticides represents
   an issue of wide concern due to their negative effects on pollinators.
   The goal of this work was to evaluate the potential use of biomixtures
   employed in biopurification systems (BPS) to remove two neonicotinoid
   pesticides, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, from wastewater of
   agricultural origin. The removal was assayed by quantification of the
   parent compounds and the detection of putative transformation products
   of imidacloprid by means of LC-MS/MS, and mineralization of radiolabeled
   imidacloprid. Two biomixtures (B1, B2) were prepared using coconut
   fiber, compost and two soils pre-exposed to imidacloprid (volumetric
   composition 50:25:25). After spiking of neonicotinoids and 228 days of
   treatment, the removal ranged from 22.3\%-30.3\% and 38.6\%-43.7\% for
   imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, respectively. Transformation products
   imidacloprid-urea, desnitro-imidacloprid and
   desnitro-olefin-imidacloprid were detected in both biomixtures. The
   mineralization of C-14-imidacloprid revealed DT50 (mineralization
   half-lives) values of 3466 and 7702 days in the biomixtures B1 and B2,
   respectively, markedly lower than those in the soil used in their
   preparation (8667 and 9902 days, respectively). As demonstrated by these
   findings, the high persistence of these compounds in the BPS suggests
   that additional biological (or physicochemical) approaches should be
   explored in order to decrease the impact of neonicotinoid-containing
   wastewater of agricultural origin.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination in Solanum (Solanaceae) species is commonly performed by
   female bees, which vibrate anthers to extract pollen. Another pollen
   removal type is by male euglossine bees, milking the anthers when
   searching for floral scents produced by secretory tissues (osmophorous)
   at the swollen connective of the anthers of species in the Cyphomandra
   clade. Some species of this clade, however, are buzz-pollinated and
   present papillate anthers that should also have secretory activity, a
   hypothesis here tested.
   The anthers of Solanum luridifuscescens were fixed at different stages
   of development and analysed under light microscopy, SEM and TEM.
   Histochemical tests for the detection of starch and lipids were done.
   Epidermal cells of the abaxial surface of the anthers were visibly
   papillose, had large nuclei and dense cytoplasm rich in organelles such
   as mitochondria and plastids, typical features of secretory tissues. In
   this site, lipid droplets were detected, concomitantly with starch
   consumption, compatible with the secretory process in osmophores. No
   exudate or accumulation of substances was seen on the surface; in
   agreement with a previous pollination study performed in field
   conditions, where no pollinators were observed collecting floral scents,
   only pollen. The histochemical and structural analyses have evidenced
   the lipidic composition of the secretion, strongly pointing to terpenes
   as the secreted compounds.
   Ours findings show that papillae of the anthers have secretory
   activities that produce lipophilic compounds. This does not result in
   resources for bees, but could be an evolutionary step to the development
   of more specialised anthers in the Cyphomandra clade.}},

Title = {{Impact of pre- and post-pollination barriers on pollen transfer and
   reproductive isolation among three sympatric Pedicularis (Orobanchaceae)
   species}},

Abstract = {{Pedicularis is the largest genus in the Orobanchaceae (>300) with many
   species co-occurring and co-blooming in subalpine to alpine meadows in
   the Himalayas. Although it is well known that different Pedicularis
   species place pollen on different parts of the same bumblebee's body,
   thus reducing interspecific pollen transfer, it is not known whether
   post-pollination components also contribute to reproductive isolation
   (RI).
   In this study, we quantified the individual strengths and absolute
   contributions of six pre- and post-pollination components of RI between
   three sympatric species in two pairs; Pedicularis gruina x Pedicularis
   tenuisecta (gru x ten) and Pedicularis comptoniifolia x Pedicularis
   tenuisecta (comxten).
   All three Pedicularis species shared the same Bombus species. Individual
   foragers showed a high, but incomplete, floral constancy for each
   species. Therefore, pre-pollination barriers were potentially leaky' as
   Bombus species showed a low but consistent frequency of interspecific
   visitation. The RI strength of pre-pollination was lower in com x ten
   than in gru x ten. In contrast, post-pollination barriers completely
   blocked gene flow between both sets of species pairs. Two
   post-pollination recognition sites were identified. Late acting
   rejection of interspecific pollen tube growth occurred in comfxteno,
   while seeds produced in bi-directional crosses of gruxten failed to
   germinate.
   We propose that, although floral isolation based on pollen placement on
   pollinators in the genus Pedicularis is crucial to avoid interspecific
   pollen transfer, the importance of this mode of interspecific isolation
   may be exaggerated. Post-pollination barriers may play even larger roles
   for currently established populations of co-blooming and sympatric
   species in this huge genus in the Himalayas.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species that are effective colonisers of transient habitats are
   expected to have a capacity for uniparental reproduction and show
   flexibility in pollination systems. Such traits may enable populations
   to be established from a small number of founding individuals without
   these populations succumbing to reductions in fecundity arising from
   pollinator limitation. We tested these predictions for Aloe thraskii
   (Xanthorrhoeaceae), a succulent treelet that colonises shifting coastal
   dunes and has both bird and bee pollinators. We performed
   hand-pollination experiments, and selectively excluded bird visitors to
   determine differences in pollinator effectiveness. We measured
   pollinator visitation rates and fecundity in populations varying in
   their size, density and isolation distance. Controlled hand-pollinations
   revealed that unlike most other Aloe species, A.thraskii is
   self-compatible and thus capable of uniparental reproduction. The
   species does however depend on pollinators and is visited by various
   bird species as well as by bees. Fruit and seed set are not affected by
   selective exclusion of birds, thus indicating that bees are effective
   pollinators. Bird visitation rates increased with increasing plant
   height and population size, while bee visitation rates increased with
   increasing population size and density. We found that seed set per
   flower was lower in large populations than in small populations. These
   results suggest that establishment of populations of A.thraskii from a
   small number of individuals is unlikely to be limited by the fecundity
   of individual plants.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.The relations between orchids and their pollinators
   are so specialized that the pollination of some of these flowers depends
   solely on specific groups of bees. Members of Stanhopeinae are
   pollinated exclusively by fragrance-collecting male euglossines.
   Although many studies have documented the pollination biology of various
   Stanhopeinae, data on the natural history of some genera (e.g., the
   Brazilian endemic Cirrhaea) are still lacking. In addition, few studies
   include molecular data on their pollination systems, and the Brazilian
   representatives of Stanhopeinae are rarely considered in
   phylogenies.Methodology.We documented the floral and reproductive
   biology of Cirrhaea through focal observations and experiments. We
   studied the interaction network between Stanhopeinae and Euglossini by
   reconstructing the phylogenies of both pollinators and orchids from
   molecular data.Pivotal results.Cirrhaea species present floral
   fragrances with different chemical compositions, are self-compatible,
   and are pollinated by two or more euglossine species. A single species
   of Cirrhaea can be pollinated by up to three bee species, and a single
   species of orchid bee can pollinate more than one species of Cirrhaea.
   Our data show that the relation between Cirrhaea and euglossines is not
   species specific and that orchids depend unilaterally on
   bees.Conclusions.The selection pressures of euglossine on flowers have
   promoted the production of divergent perfume bouquets. Moreover, they
   have favored the emergence of peculiar flower morphologies that have
   resulted in particular pollination mechanisms. This close relationship
   between flower and pollinator reduces pollen loss and promotes isolating
   mechanisms between sympatric interfertile species. The combination of
   the phylogeny of Stanhopeinae and Euglossini shows that species-specific
   relations between the evolution of plants and pollinators are rare.}},

Abstract = {{1. Globally, conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land is a
   primary driver of declines in critical ecosystem services, including
   pollination. However, exotic species are often well-adapted to
   human-modified environments and could compensate for ecosystem services
   that are lost when native species decline.
   2. We measured pollination services (pollen delivery to stigma) provided
   by wild insects to a mass flowering crop, pak choi Brassica rapa at 12
   sites across a gradient of increasing agricultural land use
   (agricultural expansion) in New Zealand.
   3. We found that pollination services increased as the proportion of
   agricultural land in the surrounding landscape increased; pollination
   from exotic species exceeded the loss of pollination from native
   species. However, pollination service delivery became increasingly
   dominated by a few exotic fly species that were active throughout the
   day, compared to native species, which had more constrained - activity
   patterns.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The best way to ensure continued
   sufficient crop pollination is to protect and restore diverse natural
   habitats on or around farms, as species-rich pollinator communities are
   relatively resilient to further environmental change. However, we show
   that where human-driven disturbance has caused loss of native pollinator
   species, exotic pollinators can maintain sufficient pollination.
   Therefore, in areas where native species loss cannot easily be reversed,
   decisions about pesticide use and habitat provision that foster
   populations of beneficial exotic species are likely to maintain
   pollination service delivery, at least in the short term. This
   highlights the need for land managers to identify the pollinator
   communities that are present on their farms, whether native or exotic,
   and make decisions to support these important communities accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive alien plants threaten biodiversity, ecosystems and service
   provision worldwide. They can have positive and negative direct and
   indirect effects on herbivorous insects, including those that provide
   pollination services. Here, we quantify how three highly invasive plant
   species (Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Fallopia
   japonica) influence the availability of floral resources and
   flower-visiting insect communities. We compared invaded with comparable
   uninvaded areas to assess floral resources and used pan-trapping to
   quantify insect communities. Only F. japonica influenced floral resource
   availability: sites invaded by this species had a higher flowering plant
   species richness and abundance of open floral units than uninvaded
   sites, probably due to its late flowering and the paucity of other
   flowering species at this time of year. Fallopia japonica was also
   associated with higher abundances of bumblebees, higher overall insect
   diversity and higher hoverfly diversity than uninvaded areas.
   Differences in pollinator communities were also associated with I.
   glandulifera and H. mantegazzianum, despite there being no detectable
   differences in floral resources at these sites. Specifically, there were
   more bumblebees and solitary bees in I. glandulifera sites, and a higher
   overall diversity of insects, particularly hoverflies. By contrast, H.
   mantegazzianum sites had a lower abundance of solitary bees and
   hoverflies. These findings confirm that invasive plant species have a
   range of species-specific effects on ecological communities. This
   supports the emerging view that control of invasive species, as required
   under international obligations, is not simple and that potential losses
   and gains for biodiversity must be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case

   The ultimate objective was to determine an optimal solution for the

   In this context, the proposed procedure optimally selects the capacity
   of three types of generators, namely solar PV, biomass, and battery
   banks. The data for this study was collected from Monshaet Taher

   Three different battery technologies, including Flooded lead-acid (FLA),

   considered in this study.
   The simulation results show that the Firefly Algorithm has the minimum

Abstract = {{Nectar is a floral reward that sustains mutualisms with pollinators,

   Attraction of bees to the flowers through the reward of nectar is
   essential for reproductive success in this economically valuable crop.
   In this study, the sex-dependent variation in composition of male and
   female nectar and the nectaries were defined using a combination of
   GC-MS based metabolomics and LC-MS/MS based proteomics. Metabolomics
   analysis of nectar detected 88 metabolites, of which 40 were positively
   identified, and includes sugars, sugar alcohols, aromatics, diols,
   organic acids, and amino acids. There are differences in 29 metabolites
   between male and female nectar. The nectar proteome consists of 45
   proteins, of which 70\% overlap between nectar types. Only two proteins
   are unique to female nectar, and 10 are specific to male nectar. The
   nectary proteome data, accessible at ProteomeXchange with identifier

   descriptively annotatable by homology to Plantae. The abundance of 45
   proteins differs significantly between male and female nectaries, as

   the known complexity of nectar composition, supports the hypothesis of
   H+C-driven nectar solute export, and provides genetic and chemical

Abstract = {{The loss of flower-rich habitats and agricultural intensification have

   the links of different wild bee functional trait groups with habitat
   types and plant resources in agricultural landscapes remain poorly
   understood, thus impeding the formulation of effective policies for bee

   functional groups responded to variations in habitat type, vegetation
   composition and plant diversity. Natural shrubland sustained the highest
   diversity in bees overall, in large-sized bees, solitary bees and
   belowground-nesting bees, while each habitat harbored unique species. In
   half of the functional bee groups, species were negatively linked to
   tree coverage and herb coverage, respectively, while plant diversity was
   positively related to all functional groups except largesized bees and
   aboveground-nesting bees. Overall bee abundance was positively related
   to abundance of plants in the Sympetalae, and negatively related to
   abundance of plants in the Archichlamydeae. Different bee functional
   groups showed distinct preferences for different plant communities. In
   order to conserve the diversity of wild bees across functional groups to
   optimize associated pollination services, a diverse habitat mosaic, and

   While it is clear that urbanization impacts species abundance and

   reared colonies from wild-caught bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) queens,
   placed them at sites characterized by varying degrees of urbanization
   from inner city to rural farmland and monitored the production of sexual
   offspring across the entire colony cycle. Our land-use cluster analysis
   identified three site categories, and this categorization was a strong
   predictor of colony performance. Crucially, colonies in the two clusters
   characterized by urban development produced more sexual offspring than
   those in the cluster dominated by agricultural land. These colonies also
   reached higher peak size, had more food stores, encountered fewer

   study vertical stratification of plant-pollinator interactions in a dry
   grassland. We observed flower visitors on cut inflorescences of
   Centaurea scabiosa and Inula salicina placed at different heights above
   ground in two types of surrounding vegetation: short and tall. Even at
   such a small-scale, we detected significant shift in total visitation
   rate of inflorescences in response to their vertical position. In short
   vegetation, inflorescences close to the ground were visited more
   frequently, while in tall vegetation, inflorescences placed higher
   received more visits. Moreover, we found major differences in the
   composition of the pollinator community on flowers at different heights.
   In a second experiment, we measured flower visitation rate in
   inflorescences of Salvia verticillata of variable height. Total flower
   visitation rate increased markedly with inflorescence height in this
   case. Data on seed set of individual plants provide evidence for a
   corresponding positive pollinator-mediated selection on increased
   inflorescence height. Overall, our results demonstrate strong vertical
   stratification of plant-pollinator interactions at the scale of mere
   decimetres. This may have important ecological as well as evolutionary
   implications.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between pathogenic and nonpathogenic fungal species in the
   tree canopy are complex and can determine if disease will manifest in
   the plant and in other organisms such as honey bees. Seasonal dynamics
   of fungi were studied in an almond orchard in California where
   experimental release of the atoxigenic biopesticide Aspergillus flavus
   AF36 to displace toxigenic Aspergillus strains has been conducted for
   five years. The presence of the vegetative compatibility group (VCG)
   YV36, to which AF36 belongs, in the blossoms, and the honey bees that
   attend these blossoms, was assessed. In blossoms, A. flavus frequencies
   ranged from 0 to 4.5\%, depending on the year of study. Frequencies of
   honey bees carrying A. flavus ranged from 6.5 to 10\%. Only one A.
   flavus isolate recovered from a blossom in 2016 belonged to YV36, while
   members of the VCG were not detected contaminating honey bees. Exposure
   of pollinator honey bees to AF36 was detected to be very low. The
   density of several Aspergillus species was found to increase during
   almond hull split and throughout the final stages of maturation; this
   also occurred in pistachio orchards during the maturation period.
   Additionally, we found that AF36 effectively limited almond aflatoxin
   contamination in laboratory assays. This study provides knowledge and
   understanding of the seasonal dynamics of Aspergillus fungi and will
   help design aflatoxin management strategies for almond. The evidence of
   the low levels of VCG YV36 encountered on almond blossoms and bees
   during pollination and AF36's effectiveness in limiting aflatoxin
   contamination in almond provided additional support for the registration
   of AF36 with USEPA to use in almond in California.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are among the world's most important groups of pollinating
   insects in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Each spring, queen
   bumblebees emerge from overwintering and initiate new nests, which
   ultimately give rise to workers and new reproductives later in the
   season. Nest initiation and survival are thus key drivers of both
   bumblebee pollination services and population dynamics. We performed the
   first laboratory experiment with the model bumblebee species Bombus
   impatiens that explores how early nesting success is impacted by the
   effects of temporary or more sustained exposure to sublethal levels of a
   neonicotinoid-type insecticide (imidacloprid at 5 ppb in nectar) and by
   reliance on a monofloral pollen diet, two factors that have been
   previously implicated in bumblebee decline. We found that queens
   exhibited increased mortality and dramatically reduced activity levels
   when exposed to imidacloprid, as well as delayed nest initiation and
   lower brood numbers in the nest, but partially recovered from these
   effects when they only received early, temporary exposure. The effects
   of pollen diet on individual queen-and colony-level responses were
   overshadowed by effects of the insecticide, although a monofloral pollen
   diet alone was sufficient to negatively impact brood production. These
   findings speak to the sensitivity of queen bumblebees during the nest
   initiation phase of the colony cycle, with implications for how queens
   and their young nests are uniquely impacted by exposure to threats such
   as pesticide exposure and foraging habitat unsuitability.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{285}},
Number = {{1880}},

Abstract = {{Seemingly mutualistic relationships can be exploited, in some cases
   reducing fitness of the exploited species. In plants, the insufficient
   receipt of pollen limits reproduction. While infrequent pollination
   commonly underlies pollen limitation (PL), frequent interactions with
   low-efficiency, exploitative pollinators may also cause PL. In the
   widespread protandrous herb Campanula americana, visitation by three
   pollinators explained 63\% of the variation in PL among populations
   spanning the range. Bumblebees and the medium-sized Megachile campanulae
   enhanced reproductive success, but small solitary bees exacerbated PL.
   To dissect mechanisms behind these relationships, we scored sex-specific
   floral visitation, and the contributions of each pollinator to plant
   fitness using single flower visits. Small bees and M. campanulae
   overvisited male-phase flowers, but bumblebees frequently visited
   female-phase flowers. Fewer bumblebee visits were required to saturate
   seed set compared to other bees. Scaling pollinator efficiency metrics
   to populations, small bees deplete large amounts of pollen due to highly
   male-biased flower visitation and infrequent pollen deposition. Thus,
   small bees reduce plant reproduction by limiting pollen available for
   transfer by efficient pollinators, and appear to exploit the
   plant-pollinator mutualism, acting as functional parasites to C.
   americana. It is therefore unlikely that small bees will compensate for
   reproductive failure in C. americana when bumblebees are scarce.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flowers can be highly variable in nectar volume and
   chemical composition, even within the same plant, but the causes of this
   variation are not fully understood. One potential cause is
   nectar-colonizing bacteria and yeasts, but experimental tests isolating
   their effects on wildflowers are largely lacking. This study examines
   the effects of dominant species of yeasts and bacteria on the
   hummingbird-pollinated shrub, Mimulus aurantiacus, in California.
   Methods Wildflowers were inoculated with field-relevant titres of either
   the yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii or the bacterium Neokomagataea sp.
   (formerly Gluconobacter sp.), both isolated from M. aurantiacus nectar.
   Newly opened flowers were bagged, inoculated, harvested after 3 d and
   analysed for microbial abundance, nectar volume, and sugar and amino
   acid concentration and composition.
   Key Results Yeast inoculation reduced amino acid concentration and
   altered amino acid composition, but had no significant effect on nectar
   volume or sugar composition. In contrast, bacterial inoculation
   increased amino acid concentration, enhanced the proportion of nectar
   sugars comprised by monosaccharides, and reduced nectar volume.
   Conclusions The results presented suggest that microbial inhabitants of
   floral nectar can make nectar characteristics variable among flowers
   through divergent effects of yeasts and bacteria on nectar chemistry and
   availability, probably modifying plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Trachusa pubescens (Morawitz, 1872) s. 1. has a distribution extending
   from south-eastern Europe over Anatolia and the Caucasus to Iran and
   Turkmenistan, and was formerly regarded as a species with high
   intraspecific variation. By means of an examination of 208 specimens
   from all parts of the distribution area, covering structural features of
   the head (mandibles, dypeus), the apical terga and the genitalia, the
   colouration pattern as well as a morphometric analysis of 26 body
   measurements with multivariate statistical methods (Principal Component
   Analysis, Discriminant Analysis), it was possible to assign the material
   to five species of which two are new to science (Trachusa balcanica sp.
   n. and T. hakkariensis sp. n.). Two taxa which had previously been
   described as ``variations{''} or subspecies are elevated to species
   rank: T. verhoeffi (Mavromoustakis, 1955), stat. n. and T. maxima
   (Friese, 1931), stat. n. Additionally, some populations can be
   distinguished by their colouration pattern or by subtle differences in
   size or body shape, but these features are apparently of no taxonomic
   significance at the species level. Trachusa balcanica sp. n. and T.
   verhoeffi have distribution areas which do not overlap with any of the
   other members of the species group and can thus be characterised as
   allospecies. By contrast, the distribution areas of the other three
   species, T. pubescens, T. maxima and T. hakkariensis sp. n., overlap to
   a certain extent and they co-exist at least to some degree in sympatry.
   While they have been found in the same region, they have so far never
   been found together at exactly the same location and it is suggested
   that species divergence occurred in parallel with ecological
   differentiation. Niche partitioning such as flower preferences is a
   mechanism which may be invoked to explain this. Some specimens with
   intermediate characters were found, particularly in contact zones, and
   it is thought that some hybridisation may occur. A partly melanistic
   individual of T. balcanica sp. n. was found, which is probably the first
   described melanistic individual in the tribe Anthidiini.}},

   compounds were investigated for insecticidal effects against three
   pests, B. tabaci, M. persicae, and F. occidentalis, and nontarget
   effects to a pollinator, Bombus terrestris (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in

   phytoncide essential oil from pine tree, a commercialized disinfectant
   solution, and a type of nitric oxide in aqueous solution. Among these

   compound resulted in the same level of acute lethality to the
   pollinator. Moreover, JP503 caused significant leaf damage when applied
   to sweet pepper plants in greenhouse conditions. The results indicate
   that the candidate compound would have limited potential for wide

   recommended that JP503 be used only in a site-specific manner such as
   applications to trap crops, barrier crops, or wild hosts adjacent to

Abstract = {{The long-term decline of wild and managed insect pollinators is a threat
   to both agricultural output and biodiversity, and has been linked to
   decreasing floral resources. Further insight into the temporal
   relationships of pollinators and their flowering partners is required to
   inform conservation efforts. Here we examined the phenology of British:
   (i) pollinator activity; (ii) insect-pollinated plant flowering; and
   (iii) extinct and endangered pollinator and plant species. Over 1
   million records were collated from the historical databases of three
   British insect monitoring organisations, a global biodiversity database
   and an authoritative text covering the national flora. Almost two-thirds
   (62\%) of pollinator species have peak flight observations during
   late-summer (July and August). This was the case across three of the
   groups studied: aculeate wasps (71\% of species), bees (60\%), and
   butterflies (72\%), the exception being hoverflies (49\%). When species
   geographical range (a proxy for abundance) was accounted for, a clear
   late-summer peak was clear across all groups. By contrast, there is
   marked temporal partitioning in the flowering of the major plant groups:
   insect-pollinated tree species blossoming predominantly during May
   (74\%), shrubs in June (69\%), and herbs in July (83\%). There was a
   positive correlation between the number of pollinator species on the
   wing and the richness of both flowering insect pollinated herbs and
   trees/shrubs species, per calendar month. In addition, significantly
   greater extinctions occurred in late-summer-flying pollinator species
   than expected (83\% of extinct species vs. 62\% of all species). This
   trend was driven primarily by bee extinctions (80\% vs. 60\%) and was
   not apparent in other groups. We contend that this is principally due to
   declines in late-summer resource supplies, which are almost entirely
   provisioned by herbs, a consequence of historical land-use change. We
   hypothesize that the seasonality of interspecific competition and the
   blooming of trees and mass-flowering crops may have partially buffered
   spring flying pollinators from the impacts of historical change.}},

Abstract = {{G. L. Stebbins' most effective pollinator principle states that when

   selection by the most effective pollinator species during two
   consecutive years. Unlike most species in the pollinator community, the
   visitation rate of the recently arrived Bombus terrestris did not change
   substantially between years, which together with its high and stable
   pollen delivery to flower stigmas made this species the most important
   in the pollinator assemblage, followed by the solitary bee Centris
   nigerrima. Flower traits were under significant selection in the
   direction expected for short-tongue bees, suggesting that E. lutea is in
   the initial steps of adaptation to the highly effective exotic

Abstract = {{Wild bees, which are important for commercial pollination, depend on
   floral and nesting resources both at farms and in the surrounding
   landscape. Mass-flowering crops are only in bloom for a few weeks and
   unable to support bee populations that persist throughout the year. Farm
   fields and orchards that flower in succession potentially can extend the
   availability of floral resources for pollinators. However, it is unclear
   whether the same bee species or genera will forage from one crop to the
   next, which bees specialize on particular crops, and to what degree
   inter-crop visitation patterns will be mediated by landscape context. We
   therefore studied local- and landscape-level drivers of bee diversity
   and species turnover in apple orchards, blueberry fields, and raspberry
   fields that bloom sequentially in southern Quebec, Canada. Despite the
   presence of high bee species turnover, orchards and small fruit fields
   complemented each other phenologically by supporting two bee genera
   essential to their pollination: mining bees (Andrena spp.) and bumble
   bees (Bombus spp.). A number of bee species specialized on apple,
   blueberry, or raspberry blossoms, suggesting that all three crops could
   be used to promote regional bee diversity. Bee diversity (rarefied
   richness, wild bee abundance) was highest across crops in landscapes
   containing hedgerows, meadows, and suburban areas that provide ancillary
   nesting and floral resources throughout the spring and summer. Promoting
   phenological complementarity in floral resources at the farmstead and
   landscape scales is essential to sustaining diverse wild bee

Title = {{Presence-only modeling is ill-suited for a recent generalist invader,
   Anthidium manicatum}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Anthidium manicatum, the European wool-carder bee, is an invasive
   species of concern given its worldwide invasion and aggressive behavior
   towards native pollinators. Predicting habitat suitability for this
   species is imperative for estimating threat to native species, and
   predicting future spread. Previous habitat suitability models used
   bioclimatic variables to make predictions across a broad geographic
   region, but these showed little utility at predicting risk at the local
   habitat scale. Therefore, we created a model using environmental inputs
   that vary across a regional scale (land cover type and percent
   impervious surface) and focused within a more restricted geographic
   region, the Northeastern (NE) US. Occurrence records were aggregated
   from open-sourced data and published records, and maximum entropy
   methods were used to create the model. We created a second model using
   bioclimatic variables (temperature and precipitation), to compare
   utility of both model inputs. We then tested the accuracy of both models
   by performing weighted random sampling and stratified random sampling
   across the NE to obtain presence and absence data for A. manicattun.
   Given previous predictions of widespread habitat suitability, it was
   surprising that out of 140 sampled locations, A. manicatum were only
   found at seven. When comparing model accuracy (Cohen's Kappa), both
   models showed low accuracy (land scape variables KHAT = 0.023;
   bioclimatic variables KHAT = -0.094). Models were also not significantly
   different from each other (Z = 0.548). Therefore, presence-only modeling
   may not be suitable for this system, either because these variables are
   not capturing factors restricting A. manicatwn's range, or it is too
   early in the invasion process. Additional probability sampling is
   suggested to refine predictive models.}},

Title = {{Effects of riverine landscape changes on pollination services: A case
   study on the River Minho, Portugal}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{656-666}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Riverine landscapes provide numerous ecosystem services, of which
   pollination is essential to increase the yield, quality, and stability
   of crops and the biodiversity of wild flora. Pollinators' behaviour and
   their community dynamics are often affected by the spatial distribution
   of floral and nesting resources at the landscape scale, and are thus
   sensitive to land-use land-cover (LULC) changes and management
   practices.
   The main objective of this study is to understand how changes in
   riparian vegetation and LULC at River Minho affect pollination services.
   For this, an approach based on the temporal analysis of historical
   cartography (1898) and current satellite imagery (2016) was used. We
   developed a novel Pollination Suitability Index for Riverine Landscapes
   (PSIRL) using LULC data as a proxy of habitat suitability for insect
   pollinators. PSIRL scores were derived from expert judgment of the local
   habitat conditions, floral diversity and field surveys. The PSIRL values
   obtained for both periods were compared using pairwise T-tests.
   We detected an overall reduction of the pollination services in the
   riverine landscape of River Minho from 1898 to 2016. However, at local
   level we observed gains and losses of pollination suitability as a
   result of distinct LULC changes. There was a marked decrease in the
   PSIRL in the most downstream and upstream riverine sections due to
   generalized conversion of scrublands, broadleaved-forests and
   heterogeneous agricultural areas to artificial surfaces and managed
   forests dominated by maritime pine and eucalyptus. However, in the
   middle section of the river, the area occupied by scrublands, riparian
   and broadleaved forests increased, resulting in an increase of the
   foraging resources for insects, and a consequent increase of the PSIRL.
   This index can be used to monitor and capture changes in the pollination
   suitability of complex riverine landscapes and support further land and
   river management decisions. The historical cartography proved to be a
   valuable source of information to characterize LULC change and hence to
   assess the evolutionary trajectory of pollination ecosystem services, at
   global and local level.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is critical for plant fitness and population dynamics, yet
   little attention is paid to the role of flowering and plant-pollinator
   interactions in structuring plant communities, including community
   responses to environmental change. Changes in arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi (AMF), nutrient abundances, and plant litter all affect plant
   access to different resources, and are known regulators of community
   structure. Each factor can also affect flowering and plant-pollinator
   interactions, potentially contributing to changes in community
   structure. To test whether AMF, nutrients, and litter influenced the
   relationship between pollination and community structure, we conducted a
   5-yr field experiment applying fungicide, adding fertilizer, and
   removing plant litter in native grassland. We measured the distribution
   of flowers and floral visits among species in year three and linked
   these measures to changes in plant composition and species richness
   between years three and five. We hypothesized that an uneven
   distribution of flowers and visits among species would lead to greater
   community change, but that the treatments would disrupt this
   relationship by altering sexual allocation and recruitment. Consistent
   with our hypothesis, communities with uneven flower distributions
   exhibited greater changes in community composition and richness under
   ambient conditions. However, AMF suppression neutralized this
   relationship and regulated the other treatment effects, highlighting the
   potential importance of AMF for stabilizing recruitment dynamics.
   Combined, AMF suppression and nutrient addition caused species losses
   when few species flowered, likely by compounding stresses for those
   species. The treatment effects on the relationship between flowering and
   community composition were more nuanced, but were likely driven by
   increased competition and altered flowering among species. By contrast,
   community composition was more stable when visitation rates were uneven
   among species, irrespective of any treatments. This suggests that some
   species require high visitation rates to maintain their populations due
   to greater dependence on sexual reproduction. Combined, these results
   highlight the importance of flowering and floral visitation to the
   dynamics of grassland communities. They also suggest that altered
   recruitment dynamics is a major, yet understudied, mechanism by which
   environmental change affects communities. Consequently, understanding
   the effects of environmental change on plant communities will require
   study of both plant growth and sexual reproduction.}},

   midstory of a temperate forest in North Carolina. Using colored pan
   traps, we sampled flower visitors during the plant growing season

   dominated by halictid bees and vespid wasps. Twenty genera of bees
   representing at least 30 species were captured within our experimental
   plots. Within the forest understory, we found higher abundances and
   diversities of bees and other flower visitors within plots that had been
   treated with prescribed fire or a combination of mechanical thinning and
   prescribed fire compared to control plots. Within our midstory samples,
   we found that forest management practices did not affect the abundance
   of any common flower visitor species/family. However, Augochlora pura
   and Vespula spp. were more abundant in the midstory compared to the
   forest understory. Overall, our study demonstrates that repeated
   applications of prescribed fire maintained elevated abundances and
   diversity of bees and other flower-visiting insects compared to
   untreated plots, likely due to increased herbaceous plant diversity and
   enhanced quality of nesting habitat within the understory. Our results
   also indicate that many flower visitors utilize the midstory of a

Abstract = {{Land-use changes, pollution and climate warming during the 20th century
   have caused changes in biodiversity across the world. However, in many
   cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and
   rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N
   Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly
   selected 2.5 x 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden,
   conducted 1989-2006 and 2008-2015, respectively, and related the change
   in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of
   species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all
   plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern
   distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement,
   response to grazing/mowing,response to soil disturbance), drainage
   (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and
   eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory,
   parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of
   reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our
   results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the
   main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate
   warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern
   distribution limit explaining 30\%-60\% of the variance in the GLMM
   models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among
   habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by
   cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going
   concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most
   productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly
   related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing
   humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of
   mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen
   deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no
   effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees.}},

Abstract = {{Onion (Allium cepa L.) is one of the main vegetable crops. Pollinators
   are required for onion seed production, being honeybees the most used.
   Around the world, two types of onion varieties are grown: open
   pollinated (OP) and hybrids. Hybrids offer numerous advantages to
   growers, but usually have lower seed yields than OP cultivars, which in
   many cases compromise the success of new hybrids. As pollination is
   critical for seed set, understanding the role of floral rewards and
   attractants to pollinator species is the key to improve crop seed yield.
   In this study, the correlation of nectar-analyzed compounds, floral
   traits, and seed yield under open field conditions in two experimental
   sites was determined. Nectar composition was described through the
   analysis of sugars, phenol, and alkaloid compounds. Length and width of
   the style and tepals of the flowers were measured to describe floral
   traits. Floral and nectar traits showed differences among the studied
   lines. For nectar traits, we found a significant influence of the
   environment where plants were cultivated. Nonetheless, flower traits
   were not influenced by the experimental sites.The OP and the
   male-sterile lines (MSLs) showed differences in nectar chemical
   composition and floral traits. In addition, there were differences

Abstract = {{Members of Oncidiinae are widely known for their interactions with
   oil-collecting bees that explore lipophilic secretions on flowers. They
   may also be pollinated through food deception and the offering of
   nectar. Although data on breeding systems are available for many

   Rodriguezia, a neotropical genus of ca. 55 species. In this paper, we
   explore the reproductive biology of two species of Rodriguezia with
   distinctive morphologies: R. decora and R. lanceolata. Floral features,
   spectral reflectance, pollinators and pollination mechanisms, and
   breeding systems were studied. Both species are scentless and produce
   nectar as a reward. Floral nectar is secreted by a gland at the base of
   the labellum and stored into the sepaline spur. Rodriguezia decora
   reflects mainly in the blue and red regions of the light spectrum, while
   R. lanceolata reflects in the red region. Rodriguezia decora is
   exclusively visited and pollinated by butterflies, while Trochilidae
   hummingbirds are the pollinators of R. lanceolata. Pollinaria attach to
   the upper third of the proboscis of butterflies (R. decora), and to the
   bill of hummingbirds (R. lanceolata), during the collection of nectar
   from the spur. Both Rodriguezia species are self-sterile. Flower
   features and floral reflectance support the occurrence of psychophily in

Abstract = {{Hedgerows, flowering strips, and natural areas that are adjacent to
   agricultural land have been shown to benefit crop production, via the
   provision of insect pollinators that pollinate crops. However, we do not
   yet know the extent to which bee habitat in the form of urban gardens
   might contribute to pollination services in surrounding crops. We
   explored whether gardens might provision pollinators to adjacent
   agricultural areas by sampling bees from gardens in the Portland, Oregon
   metropolitan area, and estimating typical foraging distances in the
   context of commercial- and residential-scale pollination-dependent crops
   up to 1000 m from garden study sites. We estimate that garden bees could
   forage outside of the garden in which they were collected, and that when
   pollination-dependent crops (commercial-scale or residential-scale) are
   nearby, 30-50\% of the garden bee community could potentially provide
   pollination services to adjacent crops, if urban bees readily cross
   boundaries and forage among habitat types. Urban gardens might thus be
   well-positioned to provision neighboring farms and food gardens with
   pollination services, or could serve as a refuge for pollinators when
   forage is scarce or crop management practices are inhospitable. The
   actual capacity of gardens to serve as a refuge for pollinators from
   agricultural fields depends upon the extent to which bees forage across
   habitat types. However, relatively little is known about the degree to
   which bees move among habitat patches in heterogeneous landscapes. We
   thus propose a research agenda that can document the extent to which
   gardens contribute to pollinator health and pollination services at the
   interface of urban, peri-urban, and rural landscapes. In particular,
   more data is needed on how landscape context impedes or promotes garden
   bee movement between habitat types.}},

Abstract = {{As cities expand, conservation of beneficial insects is essential to
   maintaining robust urban ecosystem services such as pollination. Urban
   warming alters insect physiology, fitness, and abundance, but the effect
   of urban warming on pollinator communities has not been investigated. We
   sampled bees at 18 sites encompassing an urban warming mosaic within
   Raleigh, NC, USA. We quantified habitat variables at all sites by
   measuring air temperature, percent impervious surface (on local and
   landscape scales), floral density, and floral diversity. We tested the
   hypothesis that urban bee community structure depends on temperature. We
   also conducted model selection to determine whether temperature was
   among the most important predictors of urban bee community structure.
   Finally, we asked whether bee responses to temperature or impervious
   surface depended on bee functional traits. Bee abundance declined by
   about 41\% per A degrees C urban warming, and temperature was among the
   best predictors of bee abundance and community composition. Local
   impervious surface and floral density were also important predictors of
   bee abundance, although only large bees appeared to benefit from high
   floral density. Bee species richness increased with floral density
   regardless of bee size, and bee responses to urban habitat variables
   were independent of other life-history traits. Although we document
   benefits of high floral density, simply adding flowers to otherwise hot,
   impervious sites is unlikely to restore the entire urban pollinator
   community since floral resources benefit large bees more than small
   bees.}},

Abstract = {{Green roofs are potentially valuable habitats for plants and animals in
   urban areas. Wild bees are important pollinators for crops and wild
   plants and may be enhanced by anthropogenic structures, but little is
   known about wild bees on green roofs in cities. This study investigates
   the effects of green roof qualities (floral resources, substrate
   character and depth, roof height and age) on wild bee diversity,
   abundance and traits (nesting type, sociality, pollen specialisation,
   body size) on green roofs in Vienna. Nine green roofs were sampled
   monthly between March and September 2014 by a semi quantitative
   approach. Wild bees were collected in pre-defined sub-areas for the same
   amount of time and floral resources were recorded. Over all green roofs,
   992 individuals belonging to 90 wild bee species were observed. Wild bee
   diversity and abundance was strongly positively affected by increasing
   forage availability and fine substrates. Wild bees on roofs were
   characteristically solitary, polylectic and 8.3-11.2 mm. Regarding
   nesting type, the percentage of above-ground nesting bees was higher
   compared to the common species composition in Middle Europe.
   Ground-nesting wild bees were mainly eusocial, smaller (6.4-9.6 mm) and
   positively affected by roofs with fine substrates. During June, when
   forage availability by wildflowers on roofs was ``low{''} (5-15\% flower
   coverage), flowering Sedum species were an important forage resource. We
   conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance on green roofs are
   enhanced by floral resources. Furthermore, the installations of areas
   with finer and deeper substrates benefit ground nesting and eusocial
   wild bees.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 35\% of all crop production is dependent on

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Pollination of wild plants and agricultural crops is a vitally important
   ecosystem service. Many landscape and environmental factors influence
   the pollination success of crops, including distance from natural
   habitat, wind speed, and solar radiation. Although there is a general
   consensus that increasing distance from forest decreases pollination
   success, few studies have examined the influence of specific
   environmental factors. In this study, we examined which environmental
   factors influence the pollination success of blackberries (Rubus
   glaucus). We measured the number of fruitlets per berry, a proxy for
   pollination success, as well as the weight and sweetness of each berry.
   Our results indicate that number of fruitlets is positively correlated
   with wind speed, but number of unripe red berries per bush is negatively
   correlated with wind speed. In addition, sweetness increased with
   increasing numbers of red berries per bush but was lower when flowers
   and berries were present, though this result should be considered with
   caution due to methodological limitations. Our findings suggest that a
   little studied environmental factor, wind, has a large impact on the
   number of fruitlets in blackberries. Although our findings should be
   confirmed in other locations to draw broader conclusions, they suggest
   that producers should consider the effect of wind on blackberry yield to
   optimize blackberry production.}},

Abstract = {{Jacquemontia species are often found in disturbed areas, and their
   flowers are ephemeral and very attractive to insects. We investigated
   the interaction between the flowers of Jacquemontia evolvuloides and its
   visitors, with emphasis on potential pollinators, considering
   morphological, temporal, and behavioral aspects, between September/2009
   and August/2010 in an anthropized area in Bahia State, Northeastern
   Brazil. Jacquemontia evolvuloides flowers are diurnal, ephemeral
   (approximately five to six hours duration), are present throughout the
   year, and offer nectar and pollen rewards. Because of the floral
   morphology of J. evolvuloides insect visitors have easy access to its
   resources, and its pollination could be considered generalized. While J.
   evolvuloides flowers are visited by several insects, only small bees
   (Augochlora spp.) and syrphids (Toxomerus spp.) appear to play a role in
   pollination of flowers. Although bees have been considered efficient
   pollinators of that plant, the significant presence of syrphids
   (considered occasional pollinators but showing high frequency
   visitation), may indicate their role as potential pollinators,
   especially when bees are not abundant in the fall/winter. As such, even
   in pollination systems that are considered generalized (with flowers

   important factor for efficient pollination, especially when associated

Abstract = {{The Cactaceae are known to be amongst the most endangered plant families

   perform cross pollination, and hence seed production, their population
   performance may be further negatively affected by interrupted biotic

   reproductive biology and pollinators is of prime importance. In our
   study we focused on Uebelmannia buiningii Donald, a microendemic cactus
   from the Serra Negra State Park, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. During four
   field expeditions to three localities of the species between September
   2012 and September 2013, we measured flowers, detected nectar-guides and

   that the flowering period takes place during the dry season, between
   April and October, and that the diurnal flowers open between 7:00 a.m.
   and 5 p.m. The flowers are shortly tubular with yellow
   perianth-segments. We found neither nectar nor nectar-guides, and
   osmophores appeared as glands within the flower tube. Whereas pollen
   viability was 90.25\%, manual cross-pollination tests have shown
   cross-pollination with gametophytic incompatibility. We observed two bee
   species visiting the flowers and acting as effective pollinators:
   Dialictus opacus and Plebeia sp. The combination of low reproductive

Abstract = {{Land-use change is one of the most important drivers of widespread
   declines in pollinator populations. Comprehensive quantitative methods
   for land classification are critical to understanding these effects, but
   co-option of existing human-focussed land classifications is often
   inappropriate for pollinator research. Here, we present a flexible
   GIS-based land classification protocol for pollinator research using a
   bottom-up approach driven by reference to pollinator ecology, with
   urbanization as a case study. Our multistep method involves manually
   generating land cover maps at multiple biologically relevant radii
   surrounding study sites using GIS, with a focus on identifying land
   cover types that have a specific relevance to pollinators. This is
   followed by a three-step refinement process using statistical tools: (i)
   definition of land-use categories, (ii) principal components analysis on
   the categories, and (iii) cluster analysis to generate a categorical
   land-use variable for use in subsequent analysis. Model selection is
   then used to determine the appropriate spatial scale for analysis. We
   demonstrate an application of our protocol using a case study of 38
   sites across a gradient of urbanization in South-East England. In our
   case study, the land classification generated a categorical land-use
   variable at each of four radii based on the clustering of sites with
   different degrees of urbanization, open land, and flower-rich habitat.
   Studies of land-use effects on pollinators have historically employed a
   wide array of land classification techniques from descriptive and
   qualitative to complex and quantitative. We suggest that land-use
   studies in pollinator ecology should broadly adopt GIS-based multistep
   land classification techniques to enable robust analysis and aid
   comparative research. Our protocol offers a customizable approach that
   combines specific relevance to pollinator research with the potential
   for application to a wide range of ecological questions, including
   agroecological studies of pest control.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behavior is a critical adaptation by insects to obtain
   appropriate nutrients from the environment for development and fitness.
   Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) form annual colonies which must rapidly
   increase their worker populations to support rearing reproductive
   individuals before the end of the season. Therefore, colony growth and
   reproduction should be dependent on the quality and quantity of pollen
   resources in the surrounding landscape. Our previous research found that
   B.impatiens foraging preferences to different plant species were shaped
   by pollen protein:lipid nutritional ratios (P:L), with foragers
   preferring pollen species with a similar to 5:1 P:L ratio. In this
   study, we placed B.impatiens colonies in three different habitats
   (forest, forest edge, and valley) to determine whether pollen
   nutritional quality collected by the colonies differed between areas
   that may differ in resource abundance and diversity. We found that
   habitat did not influence the collected pollen nutritional quality, with
   colonies in all three habitats collecting pollen averaging a 4:1 P:L
   ratio. Furthermore, there was no difference in the nutritional quality
   of the pollen collected by colonies that successfully reared
   reproductives and those that did not. We found however, that nutritional
   intake, calculated as the colony-level intake rate of nutrient
   quantities (protein, lipid, and sugar), was strongly related to colony
   growth and reproductive output. Therefore, we conclude that B.impatiens
   colony performance is a function of the abundance of nutritionally
   appropriate floral resources in the surrounding landscape. Because we
   did not comprehensively evaluate the nutrition provided by the plant
   communities in each habitat, it remains to be determined how B.impatiens
   polylectic foraging strategies helps them select among the available
   pollen nutritional landscape in a variety of plant communities to obtain
   a balance of key macronutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees are declining in intensively farmed regions worldwide,
   threatening pollination services to flowering crops and wild plants. To
   halt bee declines, it is essential that conservation actions are based
   on a mechanistic understanding of how bee species utilize landscapes. We
   aimed at teasing apart how foraging resources in the landscape through
   the nesting season affected nesting and reproduction of a solitary bee
   in a farmland region. We investigated how availability of floral
   resources and potentially resource-rich habitats surrounding nests
   affected nest provisioning and reproduction in the solitary polylectic
   bee Osmia bicornis. The study was performed in 18 landscape sectors
   dominated by agriculture, but varying in agricultural intensity in terms
   of proportion of organic crop fields and seminatural permanent pastures.
   Pasture-rich sectors contained more oak (Quercus robur), which pollen
   analysis showed to be favored forage in early season. More oaks 100m
   from nests led to higher proportions of oak pollen in nest provisions
   and increased speed of nest construction in early season, but this
   effect tapered off as flowering decreased. Late-season pollen foraging
   was dominated by buttercup (Ranunculus spp.), common in various noncrop
   habitats. Foraging trips were longer with more oaks and increased
   further through the season. The opposite was found for buttercup. Oak
   and buttercup interacted to explain the number of offspring; buttercup
   had a positive effect only when the number of oaks was above the mean
   for the studied sectors. The results show that quality of complex and
   pasture-rich landscapes for O.bicornis depends on preserving existing
   and generating new oak trees. Lignose plants are key early-season forage
   resources in agricultural landscapes. Increasing habitat heterogeneity
   with trees and shrubs and promoting suitable late-flowering forbs can
   benefit O.bicornis and other wild bees active in spring and early
   summer, something which existing agri-environment schemes seldom target.}},

Abstract = {{Berry crops are increasingly produced in high tunnels, which provide
   growers with the opportunity to extend their production season. This is
   particularly beneficial for the northern region of the United States
   with short and unpredictable growing seasons and where rainfall limits
   fruit quality. However, little is known about the effect of high tunnels
   on the community of pests, natural enemies, or pollinators, especially
   in berry crops, and there are few reports of the insect community in
   raspberries in this region. We compared the abundance of these insects
   during two growing seasons in field-grown and tunnel-grown floricane and
   primocane producing raspberries through direct observation and trapping
   at five sites in southwestern and central Michigan. We found eight key
   pests, including spotted wing Drosophila, leafhoppers, and thrips, and
   seven key natural enemies including parasitoid wasps, spiders, and
   lacewings, that were common across all sites. Pest populations were up
   to 6.6 times higher in tunnels, and pests typical of greenhouse systems
   became more dominant in this environment. Natural enemies observed on
   plants under tunnels were also more abundant than in the field, but this
   trend was reversed for natural enemies trapped on yellow sticky cards.
   There was also a reduction of both honey bees and wild bees under the
   high tunnels, which was balanced by use of commercial bumble bees. These
   data not only provide much-needed information on the phenology of the
   insect community on raspberry plantings, they also highlight the
   entomological implications of protected raspberry culture.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have tested whether model predictions based on species'
   occurrence can predict the spatial pattern of population abundance. The
   relationship between predicted environmental suitability and population
   abundance varies in shape, strength and predictive power. However,
   little attention has been paid to the congruence in predictions of
   different models fed with occurrence or abundance data, in particular
   when comparing metrics of climate change impact. Here, we used the
   ecological niche modeling fit with presence-absence and abundance data
   of orchid bees to predict the effect of climate change on species and
   assembly level distribution patterns. In addition, we assessed whether
   predictions of presence-absence models can be used as a proxy to
   abundance patterns. We obtained georeferenced abundance data of orchid
   bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossina) in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.
   Sampling method consisted in attracting male orchid bees to baits of at
   least five different aromatic compounds and collecting the individuals
   with entomological nets or bait traps. We limited abundance data to
   those obtained by similar standard sampling protocol to avoid bias in
   abundance estimation. We used boosted regression trees to model
   ecological niches and project them into six climate models and two
   Representative Concentration Pathways. We found that models based on
   species occurrences worked as a proxy for changes in population
   abundance when the output of the models were continuous; results were
   very different when outputs were discretized to binary predictions. We
   found an overall trend of diminishing abundance in the future, but a
   clear retention of climatically suitable sites too. Furthermore,
   geographic distance to gained climatic suitable areas can be very short,
   although it embraces great variation. Changes in species richness and
   turnover would be concentrated in western and southern Atlantic Forest.
   Our findings offer support to the ongoing debate of
   suitability-abundance models and can be used to support spatial
   conservation prioritization schemes and species triage in Atlantic
   Forest.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Hybridization is an important driver of plant
   evolutionary processes. By attracting the same pollinators to different
   species, floral scents may be involved in the formation of hybrids and
   breakdown of species boundaries. In contrast, by attracting a different
   suite of pollinators to hybrids and their parents, floral scents are
   believed to contribute to speciation processes initiated by
   hybridization events. Scents may or may not differ between the hybrids
   and their parents, but little is known about the scent chemistry of
   parental species and their hybrids.Methodology.We studied the
   inflorescence scents of parental Calendula maritima and C. suffruticosa
   subsp. fulgida (henceforth, C. fulgida) and a morphologically
   intermediate hybrid. Scents were collected by dynamic headspace and
   analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.
   Insects visiting inflorescences of the three taxa were also
   captured.Pivotal results.Calendula maritima and C. fulgida emitted
   different absolute amounts of scent; the hybrid released intermediate
   amounts of scent. The scents of the parental and hybrid taxa were all
   dominated by monoterpenes, with several compounds in common among the
   taxa. Nevertheless, the three taxa showed differences in qualitative and
   semiquantitative scent patterns. Calendula maritima emitted more and a
   higher amount of sesquiterpenes than the other taxa. The hybrid was
   overall more similar in scent properties to C. fulgida than it was to C.
   maritima.Conclusions.The overlap in scent compounds among the taxa may
   be responsible for attraction of the same insect pollinators, resulting
   in interspecific pollen transfer between the parents and the formation
   of hybrids. Indeed, preliminary observations revealed that all three
   taxa are visited by Panurgus siculus bees (Andrenidae).}},

   This service is valuated among 235 and 577 billion dollars each year.
   Land use change is among the potential cause of pollinator's reduction.
   In most southern Italian regions, as Apulia, there was a land use
   competition between agriculture and renewable energy production, in

   to decarbonize the energy production.
   Lot of agriculture companies moved toward the PV development to retrieve
   certain revenue, thanks to legislative and fiscal policies encouraging

   Here we propose a methodology to harmonize energy production,

Abstract = {{Many animals use body coloration as a strategy to communicate with
   conspecifics, prey, and predators. Color is a trade-off for some
   species, since they should be visible to conspecifics but cryptic to
   predators and prey. Some flower-dwelling predators, such as crab
   spiders, are capable of choosing the color of flowers where they ambush
   flower visitors and pollinators. In order to avoid being captured,
   visitors evaluate flowers visually before landing. The crab spider
   Mecaphesa dubia is a polymorphic species (white/purple color morphs),
   which inhabits the flower heads of a dune plant, Palafoxia lindenii.
   Using full-spectrum photography of spiders and flowers, we evaluated how
   honeybees perceived the spiders at different distances. Using visual
   modeling, we obtained the chromatic and achromatic contrasts of the
   spiders on flower heads as perceived by honeybees. Purple morphs were
   found mainly on the receptacle area and white morphs were equally likely
   to be found in the flowers and receptacle. According to theoretical
   modeling, white morphs were visible to honeybees from a distance of 10
   cm in receptacle area but appeared to be cryptic in the flower area.
   Purple morphs were cryptic on the receptacle and less so when they were
   on the flowers. Spiders on flower heads are predicted to be more easily
   detected by honeybees using chromatic contrast. Our study shows that the
   conspicuousness of flower dwelling spiders to honeybees depends on the
   color morph, the distance of observation, and the position of spider on
   the flower head.}},

Abstract = {{Mikania micrantha (mile-a-minute) reproduces both by seed and
   vegetatively. A study to determine the possible pollinators, seed
   production rates, temperature and salinity limitations to germination
   and its seedbank size and persistence was conducted in Viti Levu, Fiji.
   Representatives of the Diptera had the greatest percentage of all floral
   visits (38\%), followed by Hymenoptera (34\%) and Lepidoptera (27\%),
   while the honeybee was the most recurring visitor (18\% of all visits).
   Flower heads (capitula) within the inflorescence commonly formed four
   viable seeds, resulting in 60820 filled seed being produced per m(2).
   However, the seedbanks formed were not massive (600seedm(-2)) and they
   were moderately persistent (T-50: 1-3years). Seed germination from both
   high and moderate rainfall regions occurred rapidly, under a wide range
   of temperature regimes, with no primary dormancy being observed. This
   study indicates that the seed reproductive success of M.micrantha in the
   two rainfall regions of Fiji is due to a number of factors, including
   the production of large numbers of flowers, successful pollination by
   local insects and the subsequent production of a large number of viable
   seeds. These seeds have high viability, no dormancy and are capable of
   forming small-to-medium seedbanks that are moderately long-lived. In
   addition, seeds can germinate under a wide range of temperature and
   salinity conditions. This knowledge on seed production, biology,

Abstract = {{Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is an important forage crop in temperate

   Flanders? (3) Whether pollinator preferences can explain differences
   between high and low seed-yielding cultivars and genotypes? We found
   that Bombus pascuorum was the most abundant pollinator on red clover in
   the region considered. Nectar volume, nectar composition or pollinator
   preference did not explain the variation in seed yield between
   genotypes, nor between diploid and tetraploid cultivars. To explain seed

Abstract = {{1. In many flowering plants, bumble bees may forage as both pollinators
   and nectar robbers. This mixed foraging behaviour may be influenced by
   community context and consequently, potentially affect pollination of
   the focal plant.
   2. Salvia przewalskii is both pollinated and robbed exclusively by
   bumble bees. In the present study area, it was legitimately visited by
   two species of bumble bees with different tongue length, Bombus
   friseanus and Bombus religiosus, but it was only robbed by Bombus
   friseanus, the shorter-tongued bumble bee. The intensity of nectar
   robbing and pollinator visitation rate to the plant were investigated
   across 26 communities in the Hengduan Mountains in East Himalaya during
   a 2-year project. For each of these communities, the floral diversity,
   and the population size and floral resource of S. przewalskii were
   quantified. The abundances of the two bumble bee species were also
   recorded.
   3. Both nectar robbing and pollinator visitation rate were influenced by
   floral diversity. However, pollinator visitation rate was not affected
   by nectar robbing. The results revealed that relative abundance of the
   two bumble bee species significantly influenced the incidence of nectar
   robbing but not the pollinator visitation rate. Increased abundance of
   B. religiosus, the legitimate visitors, exacerbated nectar robbing,
   possibly by causing B. friseanus to shift to robbing; however,
   pollinator visitation remained at a relatively high level.
   4. The results may help to explain the persistence of both nectar
   robbing and pollination, and suggest that, in comparison to pollination,
   nectar robbing is a more unstable event in a community.}},

   The sizes of forest remnants and reforested areas varied from 32.1 to
   583.9 ha and from 11.3 to 33.3 ha, respectively. All reforested areas
   were located near one forest remnant. During samplings, totaling nine
   per study area, euglossine males were attracted to eight scent baits and
   captured with bait trap and entomological nets. Each forest remnant and
   its respective reforested area were sampled simultaneously by two

   bees distributed in four genera. The number of individuals and species
   did not differ significantly between different areas, except for a
   reforested area (size 33.3 ha), which was located far from its

Abstract = {{Large-scale pesticide application poses a major threat to bee
   biodiversity by causing a decline in bee populations that, in turn,
   compromises ecosystem maintenance and agricultural productivity.
   Bio-pesticides are considered an alternative to synthetic pesticides
   with a focus on reducing potential detrimental effects to beneficial
   organisms such as bees. The production of healthy queen stingless bees
   is essential for the survival and reproduction of hives, although it
   remains unknown whether biopesticides influence stingless bee
   reproduction. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the
   biopesticide azadirachtin on the survival, behavior, morphology,
   development, and reproduction of queens of the stingless bee Partamona
   helleri (Friese, 1900). The neonicotinoid imidacloprid was used as a
   toxic reference standard. Queens were orally exposed in vitro to a
   contaminated diet (containing azadirachtin and imidacloprid) during
   development. Azadirachtin resulted in reduced survival, similarly to
   imidacloprid, altered development time, caused deformations, and reduced
   the size of the queens' reproductive organs. All of these factors could
   potentially compromise colony survival. Results from the present study
   showed azadirachtin posed a toxicological hazard to P. helleri queens.

Abstract = {{Adaptive evolution of invasive species is both particularly exciting for
   the evolutionary biologist and worrisome for those interested in
   controlling or halting spread. Invasive species often have a distinct
   timeline and well-recorded population expansion. As invaders encounter
   new environments, they undergo rapid adaptive evolution. Our aim in this
   study was to measure variation of floral size in the invasive shrub
   Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and measure natural selection by
   pollinators on that trait. Past research has found that this invasive
   plant is pollinator limited in Washington State and that declines in
   pollinator populations can contribute to local extinction in another
   invaded range (New Zealand). This plant is pollinated by both native and
   introduced species of bees, representing a broad range of pollinator
   sizes. Cytisus scoparius has a flower structure that is highly conducive
   to studies on pollinator choice, even in the absence of direct
   pollinator observations.
   We surveyed urban and rural sites in and around the city of Olympia in
   Washington State. Measuring banner width, we were able to show that
   flower size varies substantially between plants but minimally within
   plants. By measuring the proportion of flowers that were `tripped', we
   could determine pollinator visitation rates and thus determine the level
   of selection due to pollinator choice alone.
   We found that C. scoparius is under natural selection by pollinators for
   increased flower size. However, such positive natural selection was only
   seen in urban populations although it was consistent across two
   flowering seasons. Rural populations of Scotch broom do not appear to be
   under selection on flower size. The natural selection by pollinators on
   broom flowers could result in adaptive evolution into a new pollination
   niche by an invading species. A higher level of variation in broom
   flowers seen here than seen in previous works in native regions suggests
   that C. scoparius may be highly diverse and primed for adaptive
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns in within-day hive weight data from two independent datasets in
   Arizona and California were modeled using piecewise regression, and
   analyzed with respect to honey bee colony behavior and landscape
   effects. The regression analysis yielded information on the start and
   finish of a colony's daily activity cycle, hive weight change at night,
   hive weight loss due to departing foragers and weight gain due to
   returning foragers. Assumptions about the meaning of the timing and size
   of the morning weight changes were tested in a third study by delaying
   the forager departure times from one to three hours using screen
   entrance gates. A regression of planned vs. observed departure delays
   showed that the initial hive weight loss around dawn was largely due to
   foragers. In a similar experiment in Australia, hive weight loss due to
   departing foragers in the morning was correlated with net bee traffic
   (difference between the number of departing bees and the number of
   arriving bees) and from those data the payload of the arriving bees was
   estimated to be 0.02 g. The piecewise regression approach was then used
   to analyze a fifth study involving hives with and without access to
   natural forage. The analysis showed that, during a commercial
   pollination event, hives with previous access to forage had a
   significantly higher rate of weight gain as the foragers returned in the
   afternoon, and, in the weeks after the pollination event, a
   significantly higher rate of weight loss in the morning, as foragers
   departed. This combination of continuous weight data and piecewise
   regression proved effective in detecting treatment differences in
   foraging activity that other methods failed to detect.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees are essential pollinators whose survival partly depends on the
   capacity of their environment to offer a sufficient amount of nectar and
   pollen. Semi-natural habitats and mass-flowering crops such as oilseed
   rape provide abundant floristic resources for bees. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the influences of the spatial distribution of
   semi-natural habitats and oilseed rape fields on the abundance and the
   mean body size of a solitary bee in grasslands. We focused on a
   generalist mining bee, Andrena cineraria, that forages and reproduces
   during oilseed rape flowering. In 21 permanent grasslands of Eastern
   France, we captured 1 287 individuals (1 205 males and 82 females) and
   measured the body size of male individuals. The flower density in
   grasslands was quantified during bee captures (2016) and the landscape
   surrounding grasslands was characterized during two consecutive years
   (2015 and 2016). The influence of oilseed rape was tested through its
   distribution in the landscape during both the current year of bee
   sampling and the previous year. Bee abundance was positively influenced
   by the flower density in grasslands and by the area covered by oilseed
   rape around grasslands in the previous year. The mean body size of A.
   cineraria was explained by the interaction between flower density in the
   grassland and the distance to the nearest oilseed rape field in the
   current year: the flower density positively influenced the mean body
   size only in grasslands distant from oilseed rape. A. cineraria
   abundance and body size distribution were not affected by the area of
   semi-natural habitats in the landscape. The spatial distribution of
   oilseed rape fields (during both the current and the previous year) as
   well as the local density of grassland flowers drive both bee abundance
   and the mean value of an intraspecific trait (body size) in permanent
   grasslands. Space-time variations of bee abundance and mean body size in
   grasslands may have important ecological implications on plant
   pollination and on interspecific interactions between pollinators.
   Specifically, a competition between bee species for nesting sites might
   occur in oilseed rape rich landscapes, thus raising important
   conservation issues for bee species that do not benefit from oilseed
   rape resources.}},

   bees}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Apoid wasps and bees (Apoidea) are an ecologically and
   morphologically diverse group of Hymenoptera, with some species of bees
   having evolved eusocial societies. Major problems for our understanding
   of the evolutionary history of Apoidea have been the difficulty to trace
   the phylogenetic origin and to reliably estimate the geological age of
   bees. To address these issues, we compiled a comprehensive phylogenomic
   dataset by simultaneously analyzing target DNA enrichment and
   transcriptomic sequence data, comprising 195 single-copy protein-coding
   genes and covering all major lineages of apoid wasps and bee families.
   Results: Our compiled data matrix comprised 284,607 nucleotide sites
   that we phylogenetically analyzed by applying a combination of
   domain-and codon-based partitioning schemes. The inferred results
   confirm the polyphyletic status of the former family ``Crabronidae{''},
   which comprises nine major monophyletic lineages. We found the former
   subfamily Pemphredoninae to be polyphyletic, comprising three distantly
   related clades. One of them, Ammoplanina, constituted the sister group
   of bees in all our analyses. We estimate the origin of bees to be in the
   Early Cretaceous (ca. 128 million years ago), a time period during which
   angiosperms rapidly radiated. Finally, our phylogenetic analyses
   revealed that within the Apoidea, (eu) social societies evolved
   exclusively in a single clade that comprises pemphredonine and
   philanthine wasps as well as bees.
   Conclusion: By combining transcriptomic sequences with those obtained
   via target DNA enrichment, we were able to include an unprecedented
   large number of apoid wasps in a phylogenetic study for tracing the
   phylogenetic origin of bees. Our results confirm the polyphyletic nature
   of the former wasp family Crabonidae, which we here suggest splitting
   into eight families. Of these, the family Ammoplanidae possibly
   represents the extant sister lineage of bees. Species of Ammoplanidae
   are known to hunt thrips, of which some aggregate on flowers and feed on
   pollen. The specific biology of Ammoplanidae as predators indicates how
   the transition from a predatory to pollen-collecting life style could
   have taken place in the evolution of bees. This insight plus the finding
   that (eu) social societies evolved exclusively in a single subordinated
   lineage of apoid wasps provides new perspectives for future comparative
   studies.}},

Title = {{Overwintering temperature and body condition shift emergence dates of
   spring-emerging solitary bees}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Solitary bees in seasonal environments must align their life-cycles with
   favorable environmental conditions and resources; the timing of their
   emergence is highly fitness relevant. In several bee species,
   overwintering temperature influences both emergence date and body weight
   at emergence. High variability in emergence dates among specimens
   overwintering at the same temperatures suggests that the timing of
   emergence also depends on individual body conditions. However, possible
   causes for this variability, such as individual differences in body size
   or weight, have been rarely studied. In a climate chamber experiment
   using two spring-emerging mason bees (Osmia cornuta and O. bicornis), we
   investigated the relationship between temperature, emergence date, body
   weight, and body size, the last of which is not affected by
   overwintering temperature. Our study showed that body weight declined
   during hibernation more strongly in warm than in cold overwintering
   temperatures. Although bees emerged earlier in warm than in cold
   overwintering temperatures, at the time of emergence, bees in warm
   overwintering temperatures had lower body weights than bees in cold
   overwintering temperatures (exception of male O. cornuta). Among
   specimens that experienced the same overwintering temperatures, small
   and light bees emerged later than their larger and heavier conspecifics.
   Using a simple mechanistic model we demonstrated that spring-emerging
   solitary bees use a strategic approach and emerge at a date that is most
   promising for their individual fitness expectations. Our results suggest
   that warmer overwintering temperatures reduce bee fitness by causing a
   decrease in body weight at emergence. We showed furthermore that in
   order to adjust their emergence dates, bees use not only temperature but
   also their individual body condition as triggers. This may explain
   differing responses to climate warming within and among bee populations
   and may have consequences for bee-plant interactions as well as for the
   persistence of bee populations under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, the cleptoparasitic (cuckoo) bee genus Epeolus (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae) is revised for species occurring in North America, north of
   Mexico, and an updated checklist of all species known to occur in Canada
   and the United States of America is provided with comprehensive
   descriptions, diagnoses, and a single dichotomous key (using the same
   couplets for both sexes) to aid in their identification. To increase
   their recognition among North American naturalists, English common names
   are also proposed for all North American Epeolus. A total of 43 species
   is confirmed as present in the region, 15 of which are newly recognized.
   The following new species are proposed based on unique morphological
   (and in most cases also molecular) attributes: E. andriyi sp. n., E.
   attenboroughi sp. n., E. axillaris sp. n., E. basili sp. n., E. brumleyi
   sp. n., E. chamaesarachae sp. n., E. deyrupi sp. n., E. diadematus sp.
   n., E. ferrarii sp. n., E. gibbsi sp. n., E. inornatus sp. n., E.
   nebulosus sp. n., E. packeri sp. n., E. splendidus sp. n., and E.
   tessieris sp. n. Of the 15, six (E. axillaris, E. brumleyi, E.
   chamaesarachae, E. diadematus, E. splendidus, and E. tessieris) were
   identified as new species under different names (nomina nuda) in an
   M.Sc. thesis by Richard L. Brumley in 1965, but until now they have not
   been formally described. Detailed morphological comparisons with some
   evidence from DNA barcoding support the following synonymies, one of
   which C was first proposed by Brumley (1965): a) E. melectimimus
   Cockerell and Sandhouse, syn. n., under E. asperatus Cockerell; b) E.
   crucis Cockerell, syn. n., under E. compactus Cresson; c) E. mesillae
   palmarum Linsley, syn. n., under E. mesillae (Cockerell); and d) E.
   weemsi Mitchell, syn. n., and e) E. vernalis Mitchell, syn. n., under E.
   ilicis Mitchell. Only one member of the almost entirely Neotropical
   ``Trophocleptria group{''} (Epeolus bifasciatus Cresson) is confirmed as
   occurring north of Mexico, and is widespread East of the Rocky
   Mountains. Known floral associations are indicated for each species, as
   are suspected or known host species of Colletes Latreille. Evidence is
   presented that suggests further investigation into the possible synonymy
   of Colletes wickhami Timberlake under C. scopiventer Swenk is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Maize is a poorly competitive crop. Accordingly, soil preparation and
   high application rates of herbicides are required to reduce early
   competition with weeds. This leaves a large amount of bare ground with
   few flowering weeds, providing a poor farmland habitat for pollinators.
   The present study evaluates the effect of four different maize
   management regimes on pollinator diversity and community composition.
   Flowering plants intercropped with maize attracted pollinators, helping
   to support pollinator communities. Similar intercropping techniques
   using a grass ground cover did not increase pollinator density,
   demonstrating that pollinator richness, density and diversity is
   intrinsically linked to the presence of flowering plants. A maize system
   with a diverse intercrop may make it possible for pollinators to thrive;
   however, these systems may only be sufficiently attractive to bring
   pollinators in temporarily from the surrounding areas. These results
   show that there can be significant improvements to pollinator diversity,
   density and community composition as a result of modifying maize
   cultivation practices; however, these benefits must be balanced with
   yield penalties of approximately 60\% to farmers.}},

Volume = {{259}},

Abstract = {{Declines in pollinators, particularly wild bees, along with rising
   demands for their services has intensified efforts to examine bee
   communities in different types of habitats. In this study we use a
   phylogenetic approach to compare and contrast bee communities associated
   with six small produce farms, eight large prairies, and five naturally
   small hill prairies in Iowa. We compare the mean phylogenetic distance
   (MPD) and the mean nearest taxon distance (MNTD) of bees in each
   community to expected mean MPD and MNTD values generated from 1000
   random permutations of a tree composed of 144 species found across all
   sites. Standardized effect size scores for MPD using presence-absence
   data showed significant clustering of bee communities at five of six
   farms and two of the five hill prairies. Clustering at the farms and
   hill prairies was due primarily to the significantly lower number of
   species in the Andrenidae (0-5 species per site), especially species of
   Andrena, as well as significantly greater number of species in the
   Halictidae (9-22 species/site), particularly Lasioglossum (Dialictus).
   Lack of Andrenidae spp. may be related to a lack of appropriate floral
   resources, indicating that enriched prairie plantings for pollinators at
   farms could enhance the abundance of Andrena species and hence
   pollinator services at these sites. The higher richness of the
   ground-nesting Lasioglossum likely results from soil disturbance regimes
   at produce farms and the naturally shallow, rocky soil with exposed
   surface at hill prairies, respectively. Analyses of MNTD using either
   abundance weighted or presence-absence data and analyses of MPD using
   abundance data did not indicate consistent differences between the three
   site types, but do point to important differences between sites in
   phylogenetic composition of bee communities. Our results show that
   phylogenetic analyses of wild bee community diversity may be a useful
   tool for measuring how bee communities differ in composition as a result
   of natural variation and human-related changes in landscapes.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Understanding beta-diversity, i.e. species turnover in space and time,
   is essential for informing conservation actions. Soaring cultivation of
   mass flowering crops (e.g. oil seed rape OSR) and loss of semi-natural
   habitats (SNH) can strongly affect populations of native pollinators,
   yet it remains unclear how OSR and SNH affect spatial and temporal
   turnover of pollinator communities. Here, we examined how the
   landscape-scale proportions of OSR and SNH affect spatial and temporal
   community turnover in solitary bees and hoverflies, two key provider
   groups of pollination and pest control services in temperate
   agro-ecosystems. Using a novel grid-based landscape-wide sampling
   approach, we quantified pollinator communities within ten 1 km x 1 km
   landscapes representing independent gradients in OSR and SNH
   availability. We sampled during and after OSR flowering, in two
   subsequent years, yielding app. 8800 specimens representing 160 species.
   Spatial community turnover, measured as the slope of the
   dissimilarity-distance relationship, was not influenced by the
   proportion of OSR at any time. In contrast, SNH decreased community
   turnover for bees during OSR flowering and for hoverflies after
   flowering, likely caused by pollinator movement between land use types.
   This suggests that a high availability of SNH may help to promote an
   even distribution of native bees and hoverflies within temperate
   agricultural landscapes, hereby potentially stabilizing landscape-wide
   pollination services.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{221}},
Pages = {{160-174}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Green spaces embedded within the urban matrix, particularly residential
   yards, could mitigate negative aspects of urban development and provide
   pollinator habitat. Lawns represent a dominant green space, and their
   management consists of frequent mowing to inhibit the growth of
   ostensibly ``weedy{''} species (e.g., dandelions and clover). Since
   widespread population declines of bees and other pollinators from
   habitat loss are a growing concern, these spontaneous flowers could
   provide pollen and nectar sources throughout the growing season. We
   experimentally tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (1, 2 or
   3 weeks) influenced bee abundance and diversity in 16 suburban western
   Massachusetts yards by increasing lawn floral resources. Lawns mowed
   every three weeks had as much as 2.5 times more lawn flowers than the
   other frequencies. Interestingly, lawns mowed every two weeks supported
   the highest bee abundance yet the lowest bee richness and evenness. We
   suggest these patterns were driven by a combination of more abundant
   floral resources (compared with 1-week yards), easier access to lawn
   flowers due to shorter grass and a more drastic impact on grass biomass
   and floral resources (compared with 3-week yards), and the dominance of
   a few generalist bees overwhelming our samples, thus driving richness
   and evenness. Our results highlight a ``lazy lawnmower{''} approach to
   providing bee habitat. Mowing less frequently is practical, economical,
   and a timesaving alternative to lawn replacement or even planting
   pollinator gardens. Given the pervasiveness of lawns coupled with
   habitat loss, our findings provide immediate solutions for individual
   households to contribute to urban conservation.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDProper management of bee pastures is considered an important
   activity for diversity of pollinators and conservation of the population
   size. In the present study, the floral composition and diversity,
   flowering spectrum and availability of food resources in natural and
   man-made habitats in four rural municipalities in Lublin Upland, SE
   Poland were evaluated. The connection between pollinator-friendly
   biotopes was also determined and some suggestions are made on
   creation/supplementation of bee pastures adapted to the arable land
   structure in eastern Poland (mean acreage 7.65ha).
   RESULTSForage species richness (S) differed among vegetation types: the
   highest S value was found in field margins, while mixed forests
   represented the lowest species richness (meanstandard deviation=37.8 +/-
   9.5 vs 16.5 +/- 2.3). In all habitats, the most abundant flowering was
   recorded in May. Then the blooming abundance decreased until a complete
   decline at the end of summer. The mean distance between
   pollinator-friendly biotopes is 2.4 +/- 1.53km, which is out of the
   flying range/foraging distance of most pollinators.
   CONCLUSIONShortages of nectar and pollen resources in the agricultural
   landscape of SE Poland are evident. Therefore it is assumed that the
   landscape structure requires support in terms of food niches for
   pollinators and creation/supplementation of bee pastures is necessary,
   e.g. six to nine patches of 0.025-0.3ha each within an area of 100ha.

Abstract = {{With an estimated 6000 species worldwide, hoverflies are ecologically
   important as alternative pollinators to domesticated honeybees. However,
   they are also a useful scientific model to study motion vision and
   flight dynamics in a controlled laboratory setting. As the larvae
   develop in organically polluted water, they are useful models for
   investigating investment in microbial immunity. While large scale
   commercial breeding for agriculture already occurs, there are no
   standardized protocols for maintaining captive populations for
   scientific studies. This is important as commercial captive breeding
   programs focusing on mass output during peak pollination periods may
   fail to provide a population that is consistent, stable and robust
   throughout the year, as is often needed for other research purposes.
   Therefore, a method to establish, maintain and refresh a captive
   research population is required. Here, we describe the utilization of an
   artificial hibernation cycle, in addition to the nutritional and housing
   requirements, for long term maintenance of Eristalis tenax. Using these
   methods, we have significantly increased the health and longevity of
   captive populations of E. tenax compared to previous reports. We

Abstract = {{Males of the neotropical bee genus Ruizantheda Moure sensu lato
   (Halictinae: Caenohalictini) differ from those of other caenohalictine
   genera in having the outer gonostylar plate with a large membranous
   region that extends to the ventral region, and the ventral gonostylar
   lobe retrorse. These features permit the placement of six additional
   species described here, four of which are new, in the genus in this
   broader sense. The males of these six species share the following
   characteristics: profemur swollen; mesofemur exceedingly swollen;
   mesotibia slightly swollen with flat, minutely ridged ventral area and
   small apical tooth; S4 shortened medially, commonly largely hidden under
   S3, with transverse median depression and apical margin emarginate;
   apicolateral lobes of S4 with tuft of branched setae and stout, simple,
   recurved setae on margin; S5 with U-shaped gradulus and setal patch,
   sometimes inconspicuous; outer lateral expansion of penis valve bilobed,
   and median posterior margin of volsella strongly angulate. Together,
   these species constitute a new group within Ruizantheda and share with
   the previously known Ruizantheda inca Coelho, Felizardo, \& Engel, R.
   aerugineus Coelho, Felizardo, \& Engel, and R. kallos Coelho, Felizardo,

Abstract = {{Native bees are declining worldwide, but conserving or restoring their
   habitat requires a better understanding of bee-flower associations. High
   quality bee habitat includes flowers that provide pollen and nectar
   preferred by bees. However, little data exist about which plants are
   commonly used by bees in the Pacific Northwest, or whether bees prefer
   certain plant characteristics over others. We examined bee and plant
   communities in an Oregon riparian ecosystem. Our purpose was to describe
   bee-plant associations, determine which plants are most frequently
   visited by bees, identify plants that may be preferred by bees, and
   examine how a plant's native status, flower color, and floral morphology
   affect the types of bees visiting it. We found that many blooming plants
   received a diverse set of bee visitors, but some plants had a higher
   number and species richness of visiting bees than others. No plant
   species seemed limited to visitation by a small set of specialist bees.
   The number and type of visiting bees were not influenced by the plant's
   native status. However, flower morphology (but not color) significantly
   affected types of bees visiting plants. Bilaterally symmetrical and
   medium tubular flowers, with nectar and pollen typically more difficult
   to reach, were associated with larger bees with longer tongues. while
   smaller, easily accessible flowers attracted smaller bees with shorter
   tongues. Our results suggest that certain plants are particularly useful
   for supporting abundant and diverse bee communities, and increasing
   diversity in the morphology of blooming plants is a key factor to
   consider when restoring riparian areas for bee pollinators.}},

Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{Premise of The Study: Studies on the effects of heterospecific pollen
   (HP) transfer have been focused mainly on insect-pollinated species,
   despite evidence of insect visitation to wind-pollinated species and
   transfer of their pollen onto stigmas of insect-pollinated plants. Thus,
   the potential consequences of HP transfer from wind-pollinated species
   remain largely unknown. Furthermore, accumulation of pesticide residues
   in pollen of wind-pollinated crops has been documented, but its
   potential effects on wild plant species via HP transfer have not been
   tested.
   Methods: We evaluated the effect of wind-dispersed Zea mays pollen on
   pollen tube growth of the insect-pollinated Mimulus nudatus via hand
   pollinations. We further evaluated whether pesticide-contaminated Z.
   mays pollen has larger effects on M. nudatus pollen success than
   non-contaminated Z. mays pollen.
   Key Results: We found a significant negative effect of Z. mays pollen on
   M. nudatus pollen tube growth even when deposited in small amounts.
   However, we did not observe any difference in the magnitude of this
   effect between pesticide-laden Z. mays pollen and non-contaminated Z.
   mays pollen.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that wind-pollinated species can have
   negative effects as HP donors on insect-pollinated recipients. Thus,
   their role in shaping co-flowering interactions for wind- and
   insect-pollinated species deserves more attention. Although we did not
   find evidence that pesticide contamination increased HP effects, we
   cannot fully rule out the existence of such an effect, because pollen
   load and thus the pesticide dose applied to stigmas was low. This result
   should be confirmed using other HP donors and across a range of HP
   loads, pesticide types, and concentrations.}},

   geitonogamous pollination. However, intraflower variation in nectar
   volume might enhance early departure from the flower or inflorescence,
   reducing geitonogamy. To examine the adaptive significance of multiple
   nectar-producing spurs within flowers, we related intraflower variation
   in nectar characteristics to pollinator foraging behavior and plant
   reproductive success in protandrous Aquilegia buergeriana var.
   oxysepala.
   Methods: We investigated if nectar volume and sugar mass relate to spur
   length and if intraflower variation in nectar characteristics differ
   between male- and female-phase flowers. Because male function requires
   more pollinator visits than female function, male-phase flowers are
   expected to have greater nectar volume and lower intraflower variation
   in nectar volume than female-phase flowers. We used intraflower
   variation in spur length as an indicator of variation in nectar
   characteristics and investigated how spur length variation affects
   pollinator behavior, pollen removal, and seed production.
   Key Results: Male-phase flowers had greater nectar volume and lower
   intraflower variation in nectar volume than female-phase flowers.
   Intraflower variation in spur length reduced the duration of bumblebee
   visits. Short visits reduced seed production, but increased pollen
   removal.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that high intraflower variation in
   nectar production rate can reduce geitonogamy and potentially increase
   the genetic diversity of pollen received. Such pattern of nectar
   secretion within and among flowers may allow flowers to ensure effective
   pollen transfer or high seed production.}},

Abstract = {{Comparing traits of invasive species within and beyond their ancestral
   range may improve our understanding of processes that promote aggressive
   spread. Solanum elaeagnifolium (silverleaf nightshade) is a noxious weed
   in its ancestral range in North America and is invasive on other
   continents. We compared investment in flowers and ovules, pollination
   success, and fruit and seed set in populations from Arizona, USA
   ({''}AZ{''}) and Greece ({''}GR{''}). In both countries, the populations
   we sampled varied in size and types of present-day disturbance. Stature
   of plants increased with population size in AZ samples whereas GR plants
   were uniformly tall. Taller plants produced more flowers, and GR plants
   produced more flowers for a given stature and allocated more ovules per
   flower. Similar functional groups of native bees pollinated in AZ and GR
   populations, but visits to flowers decreased with population size and we
   observed no visits in the largest GR populations. As a result, plants in
   large GR populations were pollen-limited, and estimates of fecundity
   were lower on average in GR populations despite the larger allocation to
   flowers and ovules. These differences between plants in our AZ and GR
   populations suggest promising directions for further study. It would be
   useful to sample S. elaeagnifolium in Mediterranean climates within the
   ancestral range (e.g., in California, USA), to study asexual spread via
   rhizomes, and to use common gardens and genetic studies to explore the
   basis of variation in allocation patterns and of relationships between

Abstract = {{Loss of local, effective pollinators may potentially limit plant

   rescued if the plant does not reject other pollen vectors. Firmiana
   kwangsiensis H.H. Hsue (Malvaceae) is an endangered tree endemic to
   limestone areas in South China. Although its preservation status is
   listed as critically endangered, its reproductive ecology is little
   known. We compared floral visitors in three wild populations and one
   transplanted population. Such a comparison allows us to see whether the
   pollinator assemblage varies geographically and to examine the
   plasticity of plant-pollinator interactions, informing sustainable ex
   situ conservation. Our pollination experiments indicated that fruit/seed
   set in F. kwangsiensis largely depended on pollinator visits, and was
   greatly reduced under hand self-pollination or exclusion of bird visits.
   Floral visitors included sunbirds, butterflies, and bees (honeybee and
   wasp) but their visitation frequency varied in the four populations. The
   sunbird Nectarinia jugularis was the major pollinator in the three wild
   populations, but was replaced by the other sunbird Aethopyga christinae
   in the ex situ population. This tree is showy, with orange-red flowers
   blooming before the leaves emerge. The calyx tube accumulates a large
   volume of dilute nectar (sugar concentration was 9.5\%) in the morning,
   rewarding sunbird pollinators. Our investigations indicated that
   sunbirds rather than insects served as a functional group of pollinators
   for this endangered species. Successful ex situ conservation of this

Abstract = {{Urban species and habitats provide important ecosystem services such as
   summertime cooling, recreation, and pollination at a variety of scales.
   Many studies have assessed how biodiversity responds to urbanization,
   but little work has been done to try and create recommendations that can
   be easily applied to urban planning, design and management practice.
   Urban planning often operates at broad spatial scales, typically using
   relatively simplistic targets for land-cover mix to influence
   biodiversity and ecosystem service provision. Would more complicated,
   but still easily created, prescriptions for urban vegetation be
   beneficial? Here we assess the importance of vegetation measures
   (percentage vegetation cover, tree canopy cover and variation in canopy
   height) across four taxonomic groups (bats, bees, hoverflies and birds)
   at multiple spatial scales (100, 250, 500, 1000 m) within a major urban
   area (Birmingham, the United Kingdom). We found that small-scale
   (100-250-m radius) measures of vegetation were important predictors for
   hoverflies and bees, and that bats were sensitive to vegetation at a
   medium spatial-scale (250-500 m). In contrast, birds responded to
   vegetation characteristics at both small (100 m) and large (1000 m)
   scales. Vegetation cover, tree cover and variation in canopy height were
   expected to decrease with built surface cover; however, only vegetation
   cover showed this expected trend. The results indicate the importance of
   relatively small patches of vegetationfor supporting urban biodiversity,
   and show that relatively simple measures of vegetation characteristics
   can be useful predictors of species richness (or activity density, in
   the case of bats). They also highlight the danger of relying upon
   percentage built surface cover as an indicator of urban biodiversity
   potential.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-mediated selection on plants can favor transitions to a new
   pollinator depending on the relative abundances and efficiencies of
   pollinators present in the community. A frequently observed example is
   the transition from bee pollination to hummingbird pollination. We
   present a population genetic model that examines whether the ability to
   inbreed can influence evolutionary change in traits that underlie
   pollinator attraction. We find that a transition to a more efficient but
   less abundant pollinator is favored under a broadened set of ecological
   conditions if plants are capable of delayed selfing rather than
   obligately outcrossing. Delayed selfing allows plants carrying an allele
   that attracts the novel pollinator to reproduce even when this
   pollinator is rare, providing reproductive assurance. In addition,
   delayed selfing weakens the effects of Haldane's sieve by increasing the
   fixation probability for recessive alleles that confer adaptation to the
   new pollinator. Our model provides novel insight into the paradoxical
   abundance of recessive mutations in adaptation to hummingbird
   attraction. It further predicts that transitions to efficient but less
   abundant pollinators (such as hummingbirds in certain communities)
   should disproportionately occur in self-compatible lineages. Currently
   available mating system data sets are consistent with this prediction,
   and we suggest future areas of research that will enable a rigorous test

Abstract = {{Most research on pollination has focussed on a subset of insect taxa
   within a narrow time window during daylight hours. As a consequence, we
   have a limited understanding of the diversity and activity of flower
   visitors during the night or belonging to taxa other than bees or
   syrphid flies. Here, we quantified the abundance and species richness of
   flower visitors in ruderal meadows over repeated 24-h cycles (i.e. day
   and night), and identified abiotic factors influencing these patterns.
   From the plant perspective, we investigated the likelihood of being
   visited by an insect across a 24-h cycle. Activity of flower-visiting
   insects never dropped to zero over 24-h. During the day, non-syrphid
   Diptera and Hymenoptera were the most abundant, and species-rich groups
   of flower visitors, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera during night. While two
   of the seven most frequently visited plant species were most likely to
   be visited during the day, five also had a high likelihood to be visited
   during the night. The abundance and species richness of flower visitors
   was positively related to temperature during both the day and the night,
   whereas there was only a positive relationship with brightness during
   the day. We conclude that non-syrphid Diptera and nocturnal flower
   visitors are currently underappreciated. As the latter seem to respond
   differently to abiotic factors compared to diurnal species, they may
   potentially increase response diversity and resilience of
   plant-pollinator communities. There is an urgent need to improve our

Abstract = {{Long-billed hummingbirds are assumed to be better adapted than
   short-billed ones for the pollination of long tubular flowers. However,
   the majority of the empirical evidence is derived from surveys of
   pollinator feeding performance, which tend to ignore the implications
   for plant fitness. Here, we tested the long-billed performance
   hypothesis from the perspective of the pollinated plant. We conducted a
   comparative survey to evaluate fecundity in relation to the length of
   the beak of the pollinating hummingbirds visiting the long and tubular
   flowers of Costus spiralis (Costaceae), in the Brazilian Atlantic
   forest. The flowers of C.spiralis were pollinated by three hummingbird
   species and their nectar was thieved by the bee Eulaema sp. There was no
   significant difference in the frequency of floral visits nor in the
   production of seeds among the three hummingbirds in fruits formed from
   flowers exposed to a single visit by each pollinator. Unexpectedly, our
   results indicate that the floral morphology of C.spiralis is equally
   compatible with long- and short-billed pollinators, and is apparently
   incompatible with pollination by large insects. These findings emphasize
   the need to test the performance of each floral visitor with the

Abstract = {{1. Agriculture benefits from ecosystem services provided by mobile
   agents, such as biological pest control by natural enemies and
   pollination by bees. However, methods that can generate spatially
   explicit predictions and maps of these ecosystem services based on
   empirical data are still scarce.
   2. Here we propose a generic statistical model to derive kernel
   functions to characterize the spatial distribution of ecosystem services
   provided by mobile agents. The model is similar in spirit to a
   generalized linear model, and uses data of landscape composition and
   ecosystem services assessed at target sites to estimate parameters of
   the kernel. The approach is tested in a simulation study and illustrated
   by an empirical case study on parasitism rates of the diamondback moth
   Plutella xylostella.
   3. The simulation study shows that the scale parameter of the
   exponential power kernel can be estimated with limited bias, whereas
   estimation of the shape parameter is difficult. For the case study the
   model provides biologically relevant estimates for the kernel associated
   with parasitism of P. xylostella. These estimates can be used to
   generate ecosystem service maps for existing or planned landscapes. The
   case study reveals that predictions can be sensitive to the parameter
   values for the width and shape of the kernel, and to the link function
   used in the statistical model.
   4. In the last two decades numerous empirical studies assessed ecosystem
   services at target sites and related these to the surrounding landscape.
   Our method can take advantage of these data by estimating underlying
   kernels that can be used to map the spatial distribution of ecosystem
   services. However, empirical data that can discriminate between
   alternative kernel shapes remain critical.}},

   was receptive and pollen grains from both anther morphs were viable

   species natives or exotics? (4) What plant and leaf traits predict

   LocationTropical South Asia, temperate eastern Canada and US Sonoran

   MethodsWe mapped taxa known to be used by leafcutter bees both from our
   own study and published literature onto the most recent angiosperm
   phylogeny. To determine what plant and leaf traits predict leaf
   selection, we monitored 6,120 individuals of 214 native and exotic plant
   species planted in a 3-sq. km. arboretum in Arizona and recorded leaf
   damage inflicted by bees.
   ResultsMegachile showed a strong preference for species in the rosid
   clade, particularly the phylogenetic cluster of Fabales, Fagales and
   Rosales. Thirty-two to forty-five percentage of the leaf plant species
   were exotic to a given region. Membership in the rosid clade and
   Fabaceae family predicted plant preference, whereas the plant species'
   local abundance and geographical origin did not. Leaf water content,
   morphotype and the presence of latex were important factors influencing
   plant choice, whereas leaf shape and size did not.
   Main conclusionThese patterns point to plant groups whose availability

Abstract = {{AimRange-restricted species are of high conservation concern, and the
   way in which they interact with more widespread species has implications
   for their persistence. Here, we determine how the specialization of
   mutualistic interactions varies with respect to the geographic range
   size of plants and pollinators and assess how they respond to the
   introduction of the alien honeybee. We also compare network
   characteristics (connectance, specialization and nestedness) between an
   invaded low mountain and non-invaded high mountain network.
   LocationSt Katherine Protectorate, South Sinai, Egypt.
   MethodsWe quantified bee-plant interactions in 42 plots between April
   and July 2013 and created visitation networks for the low mountains
   (beehives present) and the high mountains (beehives absent). We then
   compared visitation network metrics between range-restricted, regionally
   distributed and widespread plants and pollinators and assessed
   topological differences between the low and high mountain networks.
   ResultsRange-restricted bees were involved in a significantly higher
   number of total interactions than regional and widespread native bees,
   but showed no evidence of increased generalization. In contrast,
   range-restricted plants were involved in fewer interactions and
   exhibited significantly higher specialization and a high dependency on
   range-restricted pollinators. The introduced honeybee acted as a
   super-generalist and was associated with an increase in network-level
   generalization and nestedness. Honeybees exhibited high levels of
   resource overlap with range-restricted bees and made few visits to
   range-restricted plant species.
   Main conclusionsRange-restricted plants are more specialized in their
   interactions than range-restricted pollinators, suggesting that the
   forces shaping the structure of interaction network can vary between
   partners. Alien honeybees made few visits to range-restricted plants,
   but exhibited disproportionately high levels of floral competition with
   range-restricted bees. If high levels of competition lead to population
   declines then specialized range-restricted plants will be at higher risk
   of pollen deficits than more widespread species.}},

   use) affects syrphid abundance, richness and species assemblages.
   Moreover, the influence of plant richness, flower frequency and
   surrounding landscape on syrphids were assessed. Four managed meadows
   were compared with four abandoned meadows in a mountainous region in
   Austria. Adult syrphids were sampled over two consecutive years (June
   and August 2015-2016) by sweep netting using line transects and
   observation plots. Syrphid abundance was significantly higher in managed
   than abandoned meadows and increased with increasing plant richness and
   flower frequency across management types. Management and sampling time
   also significantly affected syrphid species assemblages. Syrphid
   richness and abundance were not influenced by surrounding landscape. We
   conclude that both abandoned and managed meadows provide important
   habitat types for syrphids. Therefore, efforts should be made to
   maintain both managed and abandoned meadows in order to protect syrphid
   species within mountainous landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Explosive pollen release is a mechanism used by some angiosperms that
   serves to attach pollen to a pollinator's body. It is usually adopted by
   species with zygomorphic tubular flowers and pollinated by birds and
   bees. The tree genus Meliosma (Sabiaceae, Proteales) has unique
   disc-like flowers that are externally actinomorphic, but internally
   zygomorphic, and release pollen explosively. To elucidate the adaptive
   significance of explosive pollen release, we observed flowering
   behaviour, the breeding system and pollinator visits to flowers of the
   Japanese species Meliosma tenuis in a temperate forest. Flowers bloomed
   in June and were nectariferous and protandrous. Explosive pollen release
   was triggered by slight tactile stimuli to anther filaments or
   staminodes in male-stage flowers. Because pollen cannot come into
   contact with the pistils enclosed by staminodes, M.tenuis is
   functionally protandrous. Artificial pollination treatments revealed
   that M.tenuis is allogamous. The dominant flower visitors were
   nectar-seeking drones of the bumblebee species Bombus ardens (Apidae).
   The drones' behaviour, pollen attachment on their bodies and fruit set
   of visit-restricted flowers suggest that they are the only agent
   triggering the explosive pollen release mechanism, and are the main
   pollinator of M.tenuis. The finding that bumblebee workers rarely visit
   these flowers suggests that the explosive pollen release has another
   function, namely to discourage pollen-harvesting bumblebee workers.}},

Abstract = {{Genlisea violacea is a Brazilian endemic carnivorous plant species
   distributed in the cerrado biome, mainly in humid environments, on sandy
   and oligotrophic soil or wet rocks. Studies on reproductive biology or
   pollination in the Lentibulariaceae are notably scarce; regarding the
   genus Genlisea, the current study is the first to show systematic and
   standardised research on reproductive biology from field studies to
   describe the foraging of visiting insects and determine the effective
   pollinators of Genlisea. We studied two populations of G.violacea
   through the observation of flower visitors for 4months of the rainy and
   dry seasons. Stigmatic receptivity, pollen viability, and breeding
   system were evaluated together with histochemistry and morphological
   analyses of flowers. The flowers showed stigmatic receptivity of 100\%
   in open buds and mature flowers, reducing to 80\% for senescent flowers.
   Nearly 80\% of pollen grains are viable, decreasing to 40-45\% after
   48h. Nectar is produced by glandular trichomes inside the spur. Two bee
   species are effective pollinators: one of the genus Lasioglossum
   (subgenus Dialictus: Halictidae) and the other of the genus Ceratina
   (subgenus Ceratinula: family Apidae). Moreover, bee-like flies of the
   Syrphidae family may also be additional pollinators.Genlisea violacea is
   an allogamous and self-compatible species. The differences in
   flower-visiting fauna for both populations can be attributed to factors
   such as climate, anthropogenic effect, seasonal factors related to
   insects and plants, as well as the morphological variation of flowers in
   both populations.}},

Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{Plants can send floral signals to advertise their reward for
   pollinators. Based on the presence or absents of such signals,
   pollinators can determine whether to visit plants. Plants can send
   dishonest signals but foraging behaviours of pollinators can limit the
   cheating strategies of plants. We model the plant-pollinator
   interactions by the two-type Spence signalling game and investigate the
   conditions under which honest signalling can be established. In our
   model, plants either send costly signal or they do not. The cost of
   signal is dependent on the quality of plant. Pollinators can learn from
   the interactions with plants and can update their willingness to visit
   plants' flowers to maximize their foraging efficiency. We find three
   general conditions that are required for the evolutionary stability of
   honest signaling. Those conditions are satisfied if there is (a) a high
   frequency of high-yield signalling plants in the population, (b) the
   balance between cost and benefit of signalling, and (c) high cost of
   dishonest signalling. Our model also predicts that other factors
   contributing to the establishment of honest signaling are the low

Volume = {{258}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators appear to be experiencing worldwide declines, a
   phenomenon that has been correlated both with exposure to chemical
   pesticides and disease prevalence. These factors have been found to have
   strong and often interacting negative effects on multiple pollinator
   species in laboratory based studies, however their interactions in the
   field are less clear. To try and understand the link between pesticide
   use on pollinator communities, and how this might impact on disease
   transmission, we took two complementary approaches. First, we undertook
   a series of pollinator surveys to assess the abundance and diversity of
   pollinator groups across British agricultural field sites subject to
   varying levels of pesticide use. We then screened the offspring of two
   taxa of tube nesting solitary bees (Osmiabicomis and Megachile spp.) for
   three parasite groups commonly associated with pollinators. We found
   lower pollinator abundance, group richness and diversity across
   agricultural sites associated with higher pesticide use. Specifically,
   there were fewer honey bees, hoverflies, solitary bees and wasps.
   Surprisingly, we found a lower prevalence of all three parasite groups
   in O. bicomis offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide
   use compared to lower pesticide use. We also found a lower prevalence of
   Ascosphaera but a higher prevalence of Microsporidia in Megachile
   offspring reared in sites associated with higher pesticide use compared
   to lower pesticide use. Together, our results suggest that agricultural
   sites associated with higher pesticide use may be affecting pollinators
   indirectly by disrupting community structure and influencing disease
   epidemiology and vectoring opportunities. This highlights the importance
   of understanding the interactions between pesticide use and disease in
   both managed and wild bee populations for the future mitigation of
   pollinator declines.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 11}},
Abstract = {{Parasites can induce behavioural changes in their host organisms.
   Several parasite species are known to infect bumblebees, an important
   group of pollinators. Task allocation within bumblebee colonies can also
   cause differences in behaviour. Thus, task allocation may lead to
   context-dependent impacts of parasites on host behaviour. This study
   uses Bombus terrestris and its gut trypanosome Crithidia bombi, to
   investigate the effects of parasitism, task allocation (foraging or
   nest-work) and their interactions, on olfactory learning. Prior to
   undergoing the olfactory learning task, bees were orally infected with a
   field-realistic dose of C. bombi, and observed to determine task
   allocation. Parasitism did not significantly affect olfactory learning,
   but task allocation did, with foragers being significantly more likely
   to learn than nest bees. There was no significant interaction between
   parasitism and task. These results suggest that C. bombi is unlikely to
   affect pollination services via changes in olfactory learning of its
   host if bees are under no environmental or nutritional stress. However,
   wild and commercial colonies are likely to face such stressors. Future
   studies in the field are needed to extrapolate our results to real world
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The puzzling diversity of flowers is primarily shaped by selection and
   evolutionary change caused by the plant's interaction with animals. The
   contribution of individual animal species to net selection, however, may
   vary depending on the network of interacting organisms. Here we document
   that in the buckler mustard, Biscutella laevigata, the crab spider
   Thomisus onustus reduces bee visits to flowers but also benefits plants
   by feeding on florivores. Uninfested plants experience a trade-off
   between pollinator and spider attraction as both bees and crab spiders
   are attracted by the floral volatile beta-ocimene. This trade-off is
   reduced by the induced emission of beta-ocimene after florivore
   infestation, which is stronger in plant populations where crab spiders

Abstract = {{Arable field margins are often sown with wildflowers to encourage
   pollinators and other beneficial or desirable insects such as bees and
   butterflies. Concern has been raised that these margins may be
   contaminated with systemic pesticides such as neonicotinoids used on the
   adjacent crop, and that this may negatively impact beneficial insects.
   The use of neonicotinoids has been linked to butterfly declines, and
   species such as the common blue butterfly (Polyommatus icarus) that feed
   upon legumes commonly sown in arable field margins, may be exposed to
   such toxins. Here, we demonstrate that the larval food plants of P.
   icarus growing in an arable field margin adjacent to a wheat crop
   treated with the neonicotinoid clothianidin not only contain the
   pesticide at concentrations comparable to and sometimes higher than
   those found in foliage of treated crops (range 0.2-48 ppb) but also
   remain detectable at these levels for up to 21 months after sowing of
   the crop. Overall, our study demonstrates that nontarget herbivorous
   organisms in arable field margins are likely to be chronically exposed
   to neonicotinoids. Under laboratory conditions, exposure to clothianidin
   at 15 ppb (a field-realistic dose) or above reduced larval growth for
   the first 9 days of the experiment. Although there was evidence of
   clothianidin inducing mortality in larvae, with highest survival in

Abstract = {{This article investigates the shadow value of resilience in complex
   natural lands acting as wild pollinator habitats. We capture the linkage
   between pollination services in crop production and habitat conditions
   in the surrounding natural land with a bioeconomic model. Our case study
   is buckwheat, which is produced in the hilly and mountainous region of
   central Japan and is greatly dependent on diverse fauna for pollination
   services. We model the mechanism of regime shifts in ecosystems
   consisting of buckwheat fields and the surrounding natural land with a
   threshold estimation model. We then find that the forest around the crop
   fields, which serves as a habitat for wild pollinators, is a determinant
   of an ecological threshold that causes regime shifts. We calculate the
   shadow value of resilience provided by forest habitat around a unit of
   buckwheat field to be \$ 9,796, implying that the total value of
   resilience in complex natural land amounts to half of the stock price of
   buckwheat land. This overlooked value gives us useful insights on the
   sustainable use of ecosystems, including both pollinator-mediated crop
   fields and habitats for pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Because carnivorous plants rely on arthropods as pollinators and prey,

   orders visited flowers; 56\% of visitors carried D. muscipula pollen,
   often mixed with pollen of coflowering species. Within this diverse,
   generalized community, certain bee and beetle species appear to be the
   most important pollinators, on the basis of their abundance, pollen load
   size, and pollen fidelity. Dionaea muscipula prey spanned four
   invertebrate classes and 11 orders; spiders, beetles, and ants were most
   common. At the family and species levels, few taxa were shared between
   traps and flowers, yielding a near-zero value of niche overlap for these
   potentially competing structures. Spatial separation of traps and
   flowers may contribute to partitioning the invertebrate community
   between nutritional and reproductive functions in D. muscipula.}},

Abstract = {{Floral rewards do not only attract pollinators, but also herbivores and
   their predators. Ants are attracted by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs),
   situated near flowers, and may interfere with the efficiency and
   behaviour of pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that the impacts of
   ant-pollinator interactions in plant-pollinator systems are dependent on
   (1) the seasonal activity of EFNs, which increase ant abundance closer
   to flowers; (2) consequently, an ant effect, where ants decrease the
   temporal niche overlap of bees due to predator avoidance; and (3) ant
   density, where higher densities may negatively affect plant-pollinator
   interactions and plant performance. We studied two ant-plant-pollinator
   systems based on Banisteriopsis campestris and Banisteriopsis malifolia
   plant species. The periods of high ant abundance coincided with plant
   species blooming. The presence of ants around flowers reduced the
   visitation rates of the smaller bees and the temporal niche overlap
   between bee species was not higher than randomly expected when ants had
   free access. Additionally, we observed variable ant effects on fruit set
   and duration of bee visits to both Malpighiaceae species when ant
   density was experimentally kept constant on branches, especially on B.
   campestris. Our goal was to show the dual role of ant density effects,
   especially because the different outcomes are not commonly observed in
   the same plant species. We believe that reduced temporal niche overlap
   between floral visitors due to ant presence provides an opportunity for
   smaller bees to improve compatible pollination behaviour. Additionally,
   we concluded that ant density had variable effects on floral visitor
   behaviours and plant reproductive performance.}},

   addition, female flight preceded orchid flowering after warm springs and
   it preceded flowering and male bee flight following the warmest springs.
   Such reversals in phenology have increased in frequency over the last

Abstract = {{1. Parasitism can be an important source of mortality for insect
   populations; however, we know little about the factors influencing
   vulnerability of wild bees to parasites. Mason bees (genus Osmia;
   Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) are important pollinators of crops and wild
   plants and are vulnerable to attack by brood parasites. High nest
   densities may increase rates of brood parasitism by attracting
   disproportionate numbers of parasites. 2. Three years of field
   observations from multiple sites were analysed to assess whether mason
   bee brood parasitism increased with host density. Mason bees were
   allowed to nest in artificial nesting blocks and establish natural
   variation in nesting density. Nest cells constructed by bees were
   checked for the presence of parasite eggs. 3. Parasitism of nest cells
   strongly increased with the number of actively nesting bees at a nesting
   block. Mason bees showed no preference for nesting in blocks that were
   occupied or unoccupied by other mason bees. Parasitism also increased
   with the number of days a nest was provisioned and decreased over the
   course of the season. Nest cells constructed last in a nest were
   significantly more parasitised than inner cells, despite being sealed
   against invasions. 4. These findings show positively density-dependent
   parasitism in mason bees. They also suggest that bees terminate
   parasitised nests, causing parasitised cells to become outermost nest
   cells-a behaviour that may represent a defence against parasites. Our
   results have implications for the management of mason bees as
   agricultural pollinators, as cultivating them at high densities could
   reduce offspring survival.}},

   pollinator (Andrena emeishanica) did not differ between the two color

   morph's pollen was lower, but that of mixtures of pollen from green and

   ex vivo experiments on pollen performance, indicated that pollen
   germination, rather than tube growth, of the green morph was higher than
   that of the yellow morph and was seriously constrained in both morphs if

Abstract = {{Plants need to deal with antagonists, such as herbivores, while
   maintaining interactions with mutualists, such as pollinators that help
   plants to maximize their reproductive output. Although many plant
   species have inducible defences to save metabolic costs of defence in
   the absence of herbivores, plant responses induced by herbivore attack
   can have ecological costs. For example, herbivore-induced responses can
   affect flower traits and alter interactions with flower visitors. Such
   plant-mediated interactions between herbivores and flower visitors can
   affect plant reproductive output. Current knowledge on the generality
   and specificity of plant-mediated herbivore-flower-visitor interactions
   and its consequences for plant fitness is limited.
   In this study, we investigated whether a broad range of herbivores
   feeding on the annual plant Brassica nigra affect interactions with
   flower visitors, whether the direction of interactions is predicted by
   the feeding modes (chewing and sap-feeding) and sites (above- and
   belowground) of the herbivores, and whether it results in fitness
   consequences for the plant.
   Our results show that attack of B. nigra by a range of different
   herbivores influenced plant interactions with mutualist pollinators and
   an antagonist florivore, the pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus. Pollinator
   community composition was affected by herbivory, whereas overall
   pollinator attraction was maintained. Pollinator community composition
   of uninfested plants differed from that of chewing and root
   herbivore-infested plants. Main responders in the pollinator communities
   to changes induced by herbivory were syrphid flies, bumblebees, and
   solitary bees. Although the preference of pollen beetle adults was not
   affected by herbivory, beetle larvae performed best on plants infested
   with the nematode Heterodera schachtii. The changes in pollinator
   community composition and syrphid fly visitation can explain the
   observed increase in seed set of root herbivore-infested plants.
   Interactions of flowering B. nigra plants with mutualist and antagonist
   insects are well integrated and conflicting interactions do not reduce
   reproductive output. Our results suggest some degree of specificity in
   herbivore-flower-visitor interactions with consequences for plant
   fitness. Specificity of plant responses were determined at the species
   level as well as the herbivore functional group level, and differed
   depending on the flower visitor. Because plant reproduction was affected
   by indirect plant-mediated interactions, these can potentially result in
   selection on plant strategies to optimize growth, defence and
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Numbers of bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are decreasing in many
   European countries. Thirty-six species native to Poland are legally
   protected, and 19 are considered as threatened with extinction. A method
   for assessing the attractiveness of garden flowering plants for
   bumblebees was developed in this study. Observations were conducted
   through the growing seasons in 2011 and 2012 in two botanical gardens
   located in Wroclaw city, Poland. Bumblebees were observed and recorded
   on flowers during 30-min observations and determined to species level.
   An algorithm was used to define the attractiveness (Atp) of visited
   flowers, including the frequency of flower visits by bumblebees during
   phenological seasons. The resulting Atp values were assigned to a
   4-level scale of attractiveness. In the botanical garden, the most
   ``valuable'' plant species were: Rhododendron catawbiense Michaux,
   Lathyrus vernus Bentham, Lathyrus odoratus L., Aristolochia clematitis
   L., Cyanus montanus Hill, Aconitum lycoctonum L., Hosta sp., Spiraea
   japonica L. filius, Lavandula 3 intermedia Loiseleur-Deslongchamps, and
   Lavandula angustifolia Miller; and in the Medicinal Plants Botanical
   Garden there were: Geranium phaeum L., Agastache rugosa Kuntze,
   Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Cydonia oblonga Miller, R. catawbiense, Monarda
   didyma L., Aruncus dioicus Fernald, Lavandula angustifolia, Phacelia
   tanacetifolia Bentham, Origanum vulgare L., and Scutellaria baicalensis
   Georgi. The proposed algorithm may be useful in protecting bumblebees,
   which takes into account their nutritional needs or feeding behavior.
   Careful plant selection in planning green urban areas with high rates of
   Atp will likely to contribute to an increase in numbers of bumblebees.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forests have been greatly affected by anthropogenic actions
   with formerly continuous riparian forests being slowly converted into
   small and isolated patches. Riparian forests are extremely important
   habitats for many groups of insects, including bees and wasps, because
   they are sources of shelter and food for them and their offspring. There
   is a growing body of evidence of success in the restoration of riparian
   forest plant communities; however, little research has been done on the
   associated invertebrate communities. We test whether restoring plant
   communities is sufficient for restoring the taxonomic composition of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps and which functional traits are favored in
   different sites. We predict that species richness, abundance, and
   community composition of trap-nesting bees and wasps of riparian sites
   undergoing restoration will converge on the ``target{''} of a reference
   site with increasing time, since restoration increases habitat
   complexity. We also predict that the width of restored patches will also
   influence the species richness, abundance and community composition of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps. Bee richness and abundance, and wasp
   richness, were strongly related to fragment width, but not to age since
   restoration. Our results indicate that although restored sites are
   relatively small and scattered in a fragmented landscape, they provide
   suitable habitat for re-colonization by community assemblages of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps and the traits selected captured the
   responses to the habitat restoration. Hence, restored riparian areas can
   be considered important habitats for invertebrates, thus contributing to
   an increase in local biodiversity and, possibly, the restoration of some

Abstract = {{Critical thermal limits often determine species distributions for
   diverse ectotherms and have become a useful tool for understanding past
   and predicting future range shifts in response to changing climates.
   Despite recently documented population declines and range shifts of
   bumblebees (genus Bombus), the few measurements of thermal tolerance
   available for the group have relied on disparate measurement approaches.
   We describe a novel stereotypical behavior expressed by bumblebee
   individuals during entry into chill coma. This behavioral indicator of
   minimum critical temperature (CTmin) occurred at ambient temperatures of
   3-5 degrees C (approximately 7-9 degrees C core temperatures) and was
   accompanied by a pronounced CO2 pulse, indicative of loss of spiracle
   function. Maximum critical temperature (CTmax) was indicated by the
   onset of muscular spasms prior to entering an unresponsive state and
   occurred at ambient temperatures of approximately 52-55 degrees C (42-44
   degrees C core temperatures). Measurements of CTmin and CTmax were
   largely unaffected by acclimation, age or feeding status, but faster
   ramping rates significantly increased CTmax and decreased CTmin. This
   high-throughput approach allows rapid measurement of critical thermal
   limits for large numbers of individuals, facilitating large-scale
   comparisons among bumblebee populations and species - a key step in
   determining current and future effects of climate on these critical

Abstract = {{Paved roadways, spanning 6.6 million kilometres across the continental
   United States, are often bordered by natural or restored habitats and
   could provide opportunities for pollinator conservation. Because insects
   are frequently killed by auto traffic, roadside habitats may be
   ecological traps that kill more pollinators than they produce. Here we
   compare insect traffic mortality when roadsides are bordered by
   woodlots, meadows, or lawns. We also compare study sites with and
   without restored medians to examine the impact of creating habitat that
   can only be accessed by crossing traffic. We confined our study to high
   speed roads (70-90 km h(-1)) with heavy traffic volume. Both habitat
   type and the presence of a vegetated median affect vehicle strikes fatal
   to insects. Insect mortality in general, and its effect on bees and
   butterflies in particular, was consistently lower when roads were
   bordered by woodlots than when they were bordered by lawn or meadows.
   Which roadside habitats were associated with the highest insect
   mortality depended on the taxon in question and the presence or absence
   of a vegetated median. Butterfly and dragonfly mortality was highest on
   roads with meadow medians, while bee mortality was highest on roadsides
   with lawn medians. Across most site comparisons, vegetated medians
   significantly elevated fatal insect-vehicle strikes. Regardless of the
   habitat bordering roadsides, insect mortality was unacceptably high for
   areas being considered for conservation. We suggest four research
   directions that may lead to reduced insect mortality in roadside
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Stone fruit crops grow in various regions around the world and are
   highly valued for their nutritional content, delicious taste, and
   economic importance, with an annual worldwide production of up to 42
   million tonnes. In spite of their importance as a food resource, little
   is known about the chemistry of the floral volatiles of these crops,
   especially in relation to plant-pollinator interactions. In this study,
   the floral volatiles from four major stone fruit crops (apricot, Prunus
   armeniaca L.; plum, Prunus domestica L.; cherry, Prunus avium L.; and
   peach, Prunus persica L.) were collected and analysed by coupled gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). This was followed by several
   field trials, where selected floral volatiles were tested for
   attractiveness to flower visitors and pollinators. Twenty-six floral
   volatile compounds were identified in the headspace of the four Prunus
   spp. Benzaldehyde was present in the headspace of all four species. The
   norisoprenoid 4-oxoisophorone and lilac aldehyde were the main compounds
   in the headspace of P. armeniaca, P. domestica, and P. avium. The floral
   headspace of P. persica was distinct from the other three Prunus
   species, with 3,5-dimethoxytoluene being the most prominent compound (>
   95\%). In the field trapping trials, 4-oxoisophorone was attractive to
   various flower visitor species in a number of habitats when tested alone
   or in combination with benzaldehyde. Similarly, 3,5-dimethoxytoluene
   attracted several flower visitor species when tested alone or in
   combination with benzaldehyde. Our finding suggests that chemical cues
   are an important signal in plant-pollinator interactions in the four
   stone fruit species. This work provides the first detailed analysis of
   the floral volatiles of these important crops, especially in the context
   of plant-pollinator interactions. The floral compounds identified in
   this study could be used to enhance pollination of these important
   crops, either by direct application in the field (i.e. slow-release
   device) to enhance pollinator foraging or by training pollinators on
   such signature compounds to enhance flower visitation.}},

Abstract = {{Many floral displays incorporate complex contrasting stimuli patterns in
   visual, olfactory and other sensory modalities. These `floral guides'
   can increase pollen transfer rates and visitation rates for flowers
   while reducing the search times of pollinators. Although these guides
   are important in mediating the relationship between plants and
   pollinators, little is known about the evolution of these guides or the
   conditions needed for them to evolve. Here we use a novel approach by
   applying a genetic algorithm, a modelling method inspired by biological
   evolution, to investigate floral guide evolution. Specifically, we
   examine the ways in which pollinator behaviour can affect the evolution
   of radiating floral guides and what conditions are necessary for this
   development. The results suggest that flower size and pollinator
   directionality, starting location and movement type affect the
   development of radiating guides. A preference for cues over a lack of
   cue is also necessary for this development. These findings suggest that
   radiating floral guides can evolve independently of specific perceptual
   biases by the pollinator other than a preference for cues over their
   absence. Despite these findings, we are aware of the limitations of
   computational models, and hope that these findings inform and motivate
   future models and empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of two sympatric varieties of Cypripedium
   parviflorum was compared to determine whether floral dimensions had an
   impact upon potential pollinator diversity. We observed, collected and
   compared 235 insects that entered the labella of sympatric populations
   of C. parviflorum vars. parviflorum and pubescens and compared the
   insects between two allopatric populations in Missouri. In all cases,
   insects most likely to carry the pollen masses of this orchid were
   small-to medium-sized bees (6.75 mm length, 2.28 mm width, 1.82 mm
   depth) native to the central region of the USA. The dominant carriers of
   pollen masses were polylectic females in the family Halictidae. We found
   that 40 bee species visited the flowers of both varieties, although
   floral dimensions of C. parviflorum var. pubescens were significantly
   greater than those of var. parviflorum. Cypripedium parviflorum var.
   parviflorum bloomed earlier than var. pubescens. We observed bees taking
   refuge in flowers of C. parviflorum var. pubescens on cold, overcast
   days. The two isolated populations of var. pubescens shared eight
   species of pollen vectors. Results suggest that C. parviflorum exploits
   a diverse range of bees based on its local distributions and seasonal
   fluctuations. There is overlap between bee species shared by both
   varieties and overlap between flowering periods. However, based on
   floral morphometrics, evidence did not suggest intergradation between
   the two sympatric variants. Intraspecific isolation in C. parviflorum at
   one site appeared to be the result of a combination of differing
   phenology, floral presentation and regional distribution. Bee size
   matters for successful pollination events to occur in C. parviflorum.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide essential services for watermelon, Citrullus lanatus

   bumble bees make to watermelon pollination and how their contribution
   compares to that of other bees is unclear. We used large cages (5.4 x
   2.5 x 2.4 m) to confine bumble bee hives to watermelon plants and
   compared fruit set in those cages to cages containing watermelons but no
   pollinators, and to open areas of field next to cages (allows all
   pollinators). We also collected data on single visit pollen deposition
   onto watermelon stigmas by managed bumble bees, honey bees, and wild
   bees. Overall, more fruit formed within the open cages than in cages of
   the other two treatment groups. B. impatiens and Melissodes spp.
   deposited the most pollen onto watermelon stigmas per visit, but all bee
   species observed visiting watermelon flowers were capable of depositing
   ample pollen to watermelon stigmas. Although B. impatiens did deposit
   large quantities of pollen to stigmas, they were not common within the
   field (i.e., outside the cages) as they were readily drawn to flowering
   plants outside of the watermelon field. Overall, bumble bees can
   successfully pollinate watermelon, but may be useful in greenhouses or
   high tunnels where watermelon flowers have no competition from other
   flowering plants that could draw bumble bees away from watermelon.}},

Abstract = {{Apios priceana B. L. Rob. is federally threatened and little is known

   Alabama, we studied its breeding system, determined major floral

   limitation of fruit and seed production. Fruit initiation was low
   (3.9\%) for cross-pollinated flowers but only marginally greater than
   for self-pollinated or nonpollinated flowers (none initiated a fruit).
   Most floral visits (97\%) were by bees with 43\% of visits by large bees
   (> 1.5 cm in length) and 51\% by medium bees (1-1.5 cm in length). Keel
   petals of A. priceana flowers enclose the style and stamens: flowers
   must be ``tripped'' for pollination to occur. Large and medium bees were
   equally effective in tripping flowers, whereas small bees (< 1 cm in
   length) did not trip flowers. Success of large and medium bee species
   (several Bombus species and Megachile sculpturalis Smith) in initiating
   legumes after a single floral visit ranged from 17-35\% but did not
   differ significantly among species. Pollen supplementation showed legume
   production was pollen-limited: 24\% of supplemented flowers produced
   fruits versus 6\% of nonsupplemented flowers. Seed counts revealed a
   marginally nonsignificant trend for more seeds in legumes from
   pollen-supplemented flowers. We conclude that this rare plant species is
   dependent on medium and large bees for pollination, and that
   reproduction is partially pollen-limited. Conservation efforts should
   include measures to protect bee pollinators of this species to ensure

Abstract = {{Foraging affects survival and reproductive success in animals, including

   suitable model organisms to investigate foraging behaviour of insect
   pollinators, because they can be easily monitored under natural
   conditions. We studied flower visitation patterns in the Clouded Apollo
   butterfly Parnassius mnemosyne in relation to the abundance of available
   floral resources. We recorded flower visitation daily in individually
   marked butterflies, listed flowering species and estimated flower
   abundance categories every 3 days in a single meadow, during five
   consecutive flight periods. Butterflies visited 35 nectar plants from
   the 71 species available. Few nectar plants were frequently visited
   (visit ratios for the annually most visited species: 37-60\%), many were
   scarcely visited and no visits were observed on several abundant
   species. Flower abundance and visit ratio varied among years and within
   flight periods. The number of visits increased with flower abundance in
   the seven most frequently visited plant species, but not in the
   occasionally visited ones. Beside their choosiness, Parnassius mnemosyne
   butterflies were able to adjust foraging behaviour to rapidly changing

   mitigate the effect of the lack of some nectar plants, as complementary

   the pollen preferences and the foraging niche overlap among species
   through time. Bees were sampled during four consecutive years in a

   fidelity to D. albus (60-80\%), even if some taxa preferentially
   collected pollen from other flowering species. The foraging niche
   overlap in the pollinator community decreased together with an increased
   diversity of co-flowering plant species. The results obtained indicate
   that bees preferentially forage on D. albus in the studied area, but
   that co-flowering species contribute to complement their diet and likely

   bees that forage nectar and pollen of plants in their habitats. In
   forest landscapes, silvicultural conifer plantations often have reduced
   and fragmented natural broadleaf forests, which seem to provide more
   floral resources for bees than do the plantations. 2. This study
   evaluated the effects of forest characteristics (i.e. elevation, area,
   edge length, and tree size of natural forests) on pollen diets (plant
   taxa assemblages of pollen grains in provisions) and total provision
   mass in oviposited chambers in nests made by a standardised number of
   Osmia cornifrons bees at 14 sites in a forestry area in central Japan.
   3. From April to May, the numbers of nests and chambers per nest
   increased, and the provision mass per chamber decreased. Main pollen
   sources were Prunus at higher elevations in April and Wisteria at lower
   elevations in May, foraging on which increased the numbers of nests and
   chambers per nest. The provision mass per chamber was smaller at higher
   elevations in more fragmented natural forests. Decreases in the area of
   natural forests within the foraging range (400-m radii) of O. cornifrons
   increased the utilisation of Rubus pollen and decreased the total
   provision mass. 4. These findings suggest that the loss and
   fragmentation of natural broadleaf forests change pollen diets and
   reduce the provision mass of mason bees, which may reduce the number and
   size of their offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Acacia longifolia, a native legume from Australia, has been introduced
   in many European countries and elsewhere, thus becoming one of the most
   important global invasive species. In Europe, its flowering occurs in a
   period unsuitable for insect activity: nonetheless it is considered
   entomophilous. Floral traits of this species are puzzling: brightly
   coloured and scented as liked by insects, but with abundant staminate
   small-sized flowers and relatively small pollen grains, as it is common
   in anemophilous species. Invasion processes are especially favoured when
   reshaping local ecological networks, thus the interest in understanding
   pollination syndromes associated with invasive plant species that may
   facilitate invasiveness. Moreover, a striking difference exists between
   its massive flowering and relatively poor seed set. We introduced a
   novel approach: first, we consider the possibility that a part of the
   pollination success is carried on by wind and, second, we weighted the
   ethological perspective of the main pollinator. During the flowering
   season of A. longifolia (February-April 2016), we carried on exclusion
   experiments to detect the relative contribution of insects and wind.
   While the exclusion experiments corroborated the need for pollen
   vectors, we actually recorded a low abundance of insects. The honeybee,
   known pollinator of acacias, was relatively rare and not always
   productive in terms of successful visits. While wind contributed to seed
   set, focal observations confirmed that honeybees transfer pollen when
   visiting both the inflorescences to collect pollen and the extrafloral
   nectaries to collect nectar. The mixed pollination strategy of A.
   longifolia may then be the basis of its success in invading Portugal's
   windy coasts.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service for agriculture and wider
   ecosystem function. However, most pollination studies focus on
   Hymenoptera, with hoverflies (Syrphidae) frequently treated as a single
   functional group. We tested this assumption by investigating pollen
   carried by eleven species of hoverfly in five genera, Cheilosia,
   Eristalis, Rhingia, Sericomyia and Volucella, using DNA metabarcoding.
   Hoverflies carried pollen from 59 plant taxa, suggesting they visit a
   wider number of plant species than previously appreciated. Most pollen
   recorded came from plant taxa frequently found at our study sites,
   predominantly Apiaceae, Cardueae, Calluna vulgaris, Rubus fruticosus
   agg., and Succisa pratensis, with hoverflies transporting pollen from
   40\% of entomophilous plant species present. Overall pollen transport
   network structures were generalised, similar to other pollination
   networks elsewhere. All hoverfly species were also generalised with few
   exclusive plant/hoverfly interactions. However, using the Jaccard Index,
   we found significant differences in the relative composition of pollen
   loads between hoverfly genera, except for Volucella, demonstrating some
   degree of functional complementarity. Eristalis and Sericomyia species
   had significant differences in relative pollen load composition compared
   to congeners. Our results demonstrate the range of pollens transported

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Due to intensive agriculture honeybees are threatened by various
   pesticides. The use of one group of them, the neonicotinoids, was
   recently restricted by the European Union. These chemicals bind to the
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) in the honeybee brain.
   Recently, Bayer AG released a new pesticide by the name of ``Sivanto{''}
   against sucking insects. It is assumed to be harmless for honeybees,
   although its active ingredient, flupyradifurone, binds nAchR similar to
   the neonicotinoids. We investigated if this pesticide affects the taste
   for sugar and cognitive performance in honeybee foragers. These bees are
   directly exposed to the pesticide while foraging for pollen or nectar.
   Our results demonstrate that flupyradifurone can reduce taste and
   appetitive learning performance in honeybees foraging for pollen and
   nectar, although only the highest concentration had significant effects.
   Most likely, honeybee foragers will not be exposed to these high
   concentrations. Therefore, the appropriate use of this pesticide is
   considered safe for honeybees, at least with respect to the behaviors
   studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid use has increased rapidly in recent years, with a global

   Pollinators and aquatic insects appear to be especially susceptible to
   the effects of neonicotinoids with current research suggesting that
   chronic sublethal effects are more prevalent than acute toxicity.
   Meanwhile, evidence of clear and consistent yield benefits from the use
   of neonicotinoids remains elusive for most crops. Future decisions on

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{The cross-pollination of most alpine plants depends on insects, whose
   altitudinal distribution is limited by temperature. However, although
   global warming is causing shifts in temporal and spatial species
   distribution, we are still largely unaware of how plant-pollinator
   interactions change with elevation and time along altitudinal gradients.
   This makes the detection of endangered interactions and species
   challenging. In this study, we aimed at providing such a reference, and
   tested if and how the major flower-visiting insect orders and families
   segregated by altitude, phenology and foraging preferences along an
   elevational gradient from 970 m to 2700 m in the Alps. Flies were the
   main potential pollinators from 1500 m, as bees and beetles decreased
   rapidly above that limit. Diptera, Coleoptera and Hymenoptera differed
   significantly in the angiosperm assemblages visited. Within Diptera, the
   predominant group, major families segregated by both phenology and
   foraging preferences along the gradient. Empidids, muscids and
   anthomyiids, whose role in pollination has never been investigated,
   dominated the upper part of the gradient. Our results thus suggest that
   flies and the peculiar plants they visit might be particularly at risk
   under global warming, and highlight the blatant lack of studies about
   critical components of these rich, yet fragile mountain ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has reduced biodiversity and leads to

   Conventional approaches to food production are thus no longer suitable.
   In the present work, we discuss the influence of local management and

   services. We used 34 coffee farms (15 with low impact and 19 with high
   impact management) located in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We
   analysed the floral visitor patterns and yield and their relationships
   with landscape and management context over two years. Using a GLM
   analysis, we found that farms close to natural areas and with low
   management intensity have higher potential to reduce yield gaps and
   maintain biodiversity. Biodiversity in turn (represented here by
   pollinators) improved yields by 30\%, and yields were lower on larger,
   intensively managed farms. Low impact farms, on the other hand, may
   depend not only on diversified landscapes but also on proper investment
   in sustainable production practices. Combining landscape and management
   strategies should thus generate synergies between multiple ecosystem
   services, such as pollination, yield, farm profitability, and others not

Abstract = {{Edge contrast, is one of the main determinants of edge effects. This
   study examines the response of plant and pollinator diversity (bees and
   butterflies) to forest edge contrast, i.e. the difference between
   forests and adjacent open habitats with different disturbance regimes.
   We also investigated a potential cascading effect from plants to
   pollinators and whether edge structure and landscape composition mediate
   the relationship between edge contrast and beta diversity of
   pollinators. We sampled 51 low-contrast edges where forests were
   adjacent to habitats showing low levels of disturbance (i.e. grey dunes,
   mowed fire-breaks, orchards, grasslands) and 29 high-contrast edges
   where forests were adjacent to more intensively disturbed habitats (i.e.
   tilled firebreaks, oilseed rape) in three regions of France. We showed
   that plant diversities were higher in edges than in adjacent open
   habitat, whatever the edge contrast. However, plant beta diversity did
   not differ significantly between low and high-contrast edges. While we
   observed higher pollinator diversities in adjacent habitats than in
   low-contrast edges, there were no significant differences in pollinator
   beta diversity depending on edge contrast. We did not observe a
   cascading effect from plants to pollinators. Plant and bee beta
   diversities were mainly explained by local factors (edge structure and
   flower cover) while butterfly beta diversity was explained by
   surrounding landscape characteristics (proportion of land cover in
   grassland). (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Brazil's Atlantic Forest biome is currently undergoing forest loss due

   most frequent pollination system. Over the last decade, network analysis
   has been extensively applied to the study of plant-pollinator
   interactions, as it provides a consistent view of the structure of
   plant-pollinator interactions. The aim of this study was to use
   palynological studies to obtain an understanding of the relationship
   between floral visitor bees and the pioneer plant S. didymum in a
   fragment of the Atlantic Forest, and also learn about the other plants
   that interact to form this network. Five hundred bees were collected
   from 32 species distributed into five families: Andrenidae, Apidae,
   Colletidae, Megachilidae, and Halictidae. The interaction network
   consisted of 21 bee species and 35 pollen types. The Solanum-type bee
   species with the highest number of interactions were Anthrenoides sp. 1,
   Augochlora sp. 2, and Augochloropsis notophos, representing 71.78\% of
   their interactions. Augochloropsis notophos and Augochlora sp. 2 were
   the only common species in the flowers of S. didymum. Given the results
   of our study, we conclude that Solanum is an important source of pollen
   grains for several native bee species, mainly for the solitary species
   that are more diverse in the south of Brazil. Moreover, our results
   indicate that bees from the families Halictidae (A. notophos,
   Augochlora) and Andrenidae (Anthrenoides) are the pollinators of S.

   development was mainly affected by water stress, which decreased flower

Abstract = {{Flowers that release their powdery pollen by being vibrated through
   buzzing are morphologically diverse and have evolved many times
   independently. Most prominently, buzz-pollination is known from Solarium
   (Solanaceae) defining the ``solanoid{''} flower type by Knut Fgri. The
   flowers of buzz-pollinated, Australian Halgania resemble the
   actinomorphic Solarium floral architecture: The plants have a yellow
   anther cone with an apical pore, protruding from a widely funnel-shaped
   to rotate, blue to violet corolla. However, Fgri rejected the solanoid
   flower type for some of the Halgania species due to a contracted
   inflorescence, a funnel-shaped corolla or an ostensible lack of a female
   stage. Using light and scanning electron microscopy, we investigated
   traits referring to the floral architecture of Halgania and compared the
   flowers of different species. In all investigated species the anthers of
   the cone are connected via long, intertwined trichomes (denoted
   ``capillinection{''}) both between the individual anthers and in the
   central stylar channel. The anther opening is functionally reduced to an
   apical pore by 1) capillinection and spatial compression of the thecal
   walls, leaving only small apical slits and 2) by anther appendages that
   unify the ten slits to a single pore. Halgania flowers are
   morphologically similar to each other and are buzz-pollinated. We
   conclude that they are all structurally and functionally matching the
   flowers of tomato, Solanum lycopersicum, and thus the concept of
   solanoid flowers as defined by Knut Fagri.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating oilseed crops into rotations can improve soil health
   benefits, nutrient retention, and pollinator provisions. Field margins
   represent areas where incorporation of oilseeds is feasible. However in
   the northern Great Plains, field margins can oftentimes be areas of
   saline soil, which can impact seed germination and seedling
   establishment. Therefore, a replicated growth chamber experiment was
   used to determine winter camelina (Camelina sativa), winter pennycress
   (Thlaspi arvense L.), echium (Echium plantogineum), cuphea (Cuphea
   viscosissima X Cuphea lanceolata), and calendula (Calendula officinalis)
   tolerance to germinating under saline conditions. A total of 50 seeds,
   replicated 3 times were germinated in petri dishes saturated with NaCl,
   CaCl, and Na2SO4 solution at 0, 0.2, 2, 4, 8, and 16 dS m(-1) in an
   incubator at constant 20 degrees C. Fully germinated seeds were counted
   and removed daily for 7 days, followed by every other day for a total of
   21 days. Final germination percent, corrected germination rate index,
   and germination velocity were calculated. Germination percent, corrected
   germination rate index and germination velocity were negatively affected
   by increases in salinity for camelina, pennycress, cuphea, and
   calendula. Echium germination was not impacted by salt or salinity
   level. Sodium based salts were more detrimental for camelina,
   pennycress, and calendula. Camelina and cuphea germination was tolerant
   to salinity, with average salinity thresholds of 8.0 and 3.1 dS m(-1)
   and a 25\% germination decline at 35.3 and 11.0 dS m(-1), respectively.

Abstract = {{1. The explicit and implicit aims of creating ecological focus areas
   (EFAs) and implementing greening measures in European agro-ecosystems
   include the promotion of regulatory ecosystem services (ES) to sustain
   crop production in conventional cropping systems. However, the extent to
   which these goals are achieved with current policy measures remains
   poorly explored.
   2. We measured insect-mediated pollination and natural pest control
   service provisioning in 18 winter oilseed rape fields as a function of
   the independent and interactive effects of local EFA establishment-sown
   wildflower strips and hedgerows-and landscape-scale greening measures
   within a 1 km radius around focal fields and quantified their
   contribution to crop yield.
   3. Insect pollination potential and pest predation increased on average
   by 10\% and 13\%, respectively, when landscape-scale greening measures
   share was increased from 6\% to 26\%. For pollination, the increase was
   stronger in fields adjoining an EFA (14\%) than in fields without
   adjacent EFA (7\%).
   4. Agricultural management practices were the main drivers of crop
   yield. Neither insect pollination potential or natural pest control
   (pest predation and parasitism) nor adjacent EFAs and landscape-scale
   greening significantly affected crop yield in addition to agricultural
   management.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Local establishment of perennial,
   species-rich wildflower strips and hedgerows, combined with
   landscape-scale greening measures in agricultural landscapes, can
   promote multiple ecosystem services (ES) in conventional production
   systems. Benefits may be maximized when local and landscape measures are
   combined. However, enhanced pollination and natural pest regulation seem
   to contribute relatively little to final crop yield compared to local
   agricultural management practices in the high-input conventional
   production system studied. Further research is needed to better
   understand how to improve the effectiveness of ecological focus areas
   and other greening measures in promoting regulatory ES. Potential
   improvements include minimising trade-offs while promoting synergies
   between ES provision, food production and biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-pollinated plants can be susceptible to changes in pollinator
   availability. Honeydew-producing treehoppers frequently occur on
   inflorescences, potentially enhancing ant-mediated negative effects on
   pollination services. However, the effect of ant-attended,
   honeydew-producing insects on plant reproduction remains uncertain. We
   recorded the abundance of treehoppers and ants on Byrsonima intermedia
   (Malpighiaceae), and monitored floral visitors in a Brazilian cerrado
   savanna. We manipulated the presence of ants and ant-treehopper
   associations on inflorescences to assess their effect on pollination and
   fruit formation. We used dried ants pinned to inflorescences to evaluate
   the effect of ant presence and ant identity on potential pollinators.
   Results show that the presence of treehoppers increases ant abundance on
   flowers and disrupts pollination by oil-collecting bees, decreasing the
   frequency and duration of floral visits and reducing fruit and seed set.
   Treehopper herbivory has no direct effect on fruit or seed production,
   which are independent of treehopper density. Pinned ants promote
   avoidance by floral visitors, reducing the number of visits. Ant
   identity mediates visitation decisions, with Ectatomma brunneum causing
   greater avoidance by floral visitors than Camponotus rufipes. Field
   videos show that pollinating bees are harassed by ants near flowers,
   prompting avoidance behavior by the bees. This is the first
   demonstration of indirect effects by honeydew-gathering ants, via
   disrupted pollination, on plant reproduction in tropical cerrado
   savanna. Our results highlight the importance of studying other
   interactions near flowers, in addition to just observing pollinators,
   for a proper understanding of plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Outbred forage species syn1 polycross seed production has a major impact

   in size from 13 to 96 parents were evaluated for median seed yield per
   plant, seed-parent fecundity Weibull distribution shape parameter
   lambda-values, pollen-parent fecundity distribution lambda-values, and
   seed-pollen-parent fecundity correlations. Seed-pollen-parent fecundity
   correlations were significant and varied from r(2) = 0.187 to 0.879 with
   a median value of 0.464. Seed-pollen-parent fecundity was negatively
   correlated with seed-parent fecundity distribution lambda-values (r =
   -0.633), indicating that less panmictic polycross mating was associated
   with more correlated seed-and pollen-parent fecundity. Multiple
   regression of a polycross's median seed yield per plant and seed-parent
   fecundity distribution l-values onto seed-pollen-parent fecundity
   correlations revealed a positive slope with median seed yield per plant
   (partial r(2) = 0.255) and a negative slope with seed-parent fecundity
   distribution l-values (partial r(2) = 0.400). This study reveals that
   seedand pollen-parent fecundity are correlated and that this correlation
   is higher when median seed yield per plant is lower and when polycross
   mating is less panmictic. To mitigate the impact of increased inbreeding
   due to this correlation, we recommend creating a stress-free polycross
   environment that maximizes seed production per plant in the polycross.}},

Abstract = {{Crithidia bombi and Crithidia expoeki (Trypanosomatidae) are common
   parasites of bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Crithidia bombi was described in
   the 1980s, and C. expoeki was recently discovered using molecular tools.
   Both species have cosmopolitan distributions among their bumble bee
   hosts, but there have been few bumble bee studies that have identified
   infections to species since the original description of C. expoeki in
   2010. Morphological identification of species is difficult due to
   variability within each stage of their complex lifecycles, although they
   can be easily differentiated through DNA sequencing. However, DNA
   sequencing can be expensive, particularly with many samples to diagnose.
   In order to reliably and inexpensively distinguish Crithidia species for
   a large-scale survey, we developed a multiplex PCR protocol using
   species-specific primers with a universal trypanosomatid primer set to
   detect unexpected relatives. We applied this method to 356
   trypanosomatid-positive bumble bees from North America as a first-look
   at the distribution and host range of each parasite in the region.
   Crithidia bombi was more common (90.2\%) than C. expoeki (21.3\%), with
   most C. expoeki-positive samples existing as co-infections with C. bombi
   (13.8\%). This two-step detection method also revealed that 2.2\%
   samples were positive for trypanosmatids that were neither C. bombi nor
   C. expoeki. Sequencing revealed that two individuals were positive for
   C. mellificae, one for Lotmaria passim, and three for two unclassified
   trypanosomatids. This two-step method is effective in diagnosing known
   bumble bee infecting Crithidia species, and allowing for the discovery
   of unknown potential symbionts.}},

Abstract = {{Global consumption of crops with a yield that is dependent on animal

   the floral reward of the bee-pollinated crop Vicia faba (field bean). We
   examined the genetic potential for breeding flowers with a greater
   reward into current commercial varieties and used bee behavioral
   experiments to gain insight into the optimal nectar concentration to
   maximize bee preference. There was a large range of variation in the
   amount of pollen and nectar reward of flowers in the genotypes

Abstract = {{Flowering plants often depend on the attraction of biotic pollinators
   for sexual reproduction. Consequently, the emergence and maintenance of
   selected floral attributes related to pollinator attraction and
   rewarding are driven by pollinator pressure.
   In this paper we explore the effect of pollinators, rainfall,
   temperature and air humidity on the reproduction of a Brazilian
   terrestrial orchid, Cranichis candida based on data of phenology, flower
   resources, olfactory and visual attraction cues, pollinators and
   breeding system.
   The flowers of C.candida are strongly protandrous and pollinated by
   workers of the social native bee Tetragonisca angustula. The bees
   collect labellar lipoidal substances (wax scales), which are transported
   to the nest. The lipoidal substance is composed of sterols, hydrocarbons
   and terpenes. The last presumably protects the bees and their nests
   against pathogens and other arthropods. C.candida sets fruits through
   biotic self- and cross-pollination, and spontaneously due the action of
   raindrops on flowers.
   Our results indicate that in C.candida, although rain-mediated
   spontaneous self-pollination happens, fructification mediated by biotic
   pollinations also occurs, which may result in fruit set by
   cross-pollination. A mixed pollination system must result in higher
   genetic variability when compared to species whose fruits are produced
   entirely by self-pollination. On the other hand, autogamy is a form of
   reproductive assurance, and has commonly evolved where pollination
   services are rare or absent.}},

   contributed to lineage divergences and species differentiation through

   these factors affected species diversification and reconstructed its
   possible biogeographic history in South American arid environments.
   Sequences were obtained from two molecular markers: the ITS nuclear
   region and the trnS-trnG plastid region. Using Parsimony, Maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian inference individual gene trees were
   reconstructed, and a species tree was obtained using multi-species
   coalescent analysis. Divergence times among species were estimated using
   secondary calibrations. Flexible Bayesian models and stochastic
   character mapping were used to elucidate ancestral geographic
   distributions and the evolution of the floral and vegetative phenotypes
   in the genus. Gene trees and species tree analyses strongly support
   Anarthrophyllum as monophyletic; all analyses consistently retrieved
   three well-supported main clades: High Andean Clade, Patagonian Clade 1,
   and Patagonian Clade 2. Main diversification events occurred concomitant
   with the Andean uplift and steppe aridization; the Andean mountain range
   possibly acted as a species barrier for the High Andean Clade.
   Vegetative traits showed adaptations to harsh climates in some clades,
   while pollinator-related floral features were associated with
   independent diversification in bee- and bird-pollinated clades within
   both Patagonian Clades. In conclusion, evolutionary and biogeographic
   history of Anarthrophyllum resulted from the action of ecological,

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Nectar robbers can affect pollinator behavior and
   indirectly affect plant fitness. The signal of such effects (positive,
   neutral, or negative) may depend on how the primary pollinators of a
   given plant species respond to robbed flowers. Comparative studies are
   important to give insight on which factors are linked to these
   differential outcomes of nectar robbing on plant reproductive success.
   Here, we investigated the effect of a common Neotropical nectar robber,
   the stingless bee, Trigona spinipes (Apidae), on the reproductive
   success of the bee-pollinated Crotalaria vitellina (Fabaceae) and the
   hummingbird-pollinated Besleria longimucronata
   (Gesneriaceae).Methodology.We compared the robbing rate (number of
   flowers robbed relative to total flower display) between species and
   evaluated the effect of robbing on plant reproductive success by
   comparing the seed number per fruit of robbed fruits (identified by the
   presence of scars in the calyx, caused by the robber) with that of
   intact fruits.Pivotal results.The hummingbird-pollinated B.
   longimucronata had a higher proportion of robbed flowers than the
   bee-pollinated C. vitellina. Moreover, we found a negative effect of
   robbing on seed number per fruit for B. longimucronata but no effect for
   C. vitellina.Conclusions.The differences in the outcome of nectar
   robbing can be interpreted based on previous studies of pollinator
   behavior: hummingbirds often avoid nectar-robbed flowers, while bees
   often do not exhibit a preference between robbed and intact flowers. Our
   results show that the same robber species can have differential effects
   on the reproductive success of distinct plant species. In this sense,
   the outcome of nectar robbing will depend on the interplay between plant
   traits and pollinator behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of suitable seminatural habitats and homogenization of crop types
   have led to the population decline of pollinating insects in farmland.
   As these insects support crop production, many practical efforts aim to
   sustain pollinator diversity which is especially challenging in
   intensively managed and homogeneous farmland. However, there are ongoing
   changes of the farmland toward its multifunctionality that includes, for
   example, wind farm development. Windmills are often built within crops;
   thus, we examined if the noncropped area around windmills can be
   valuable habitats for wild plants and pollinating insects: bees,
   butterflies, and flies. Species richness, abundances, and species
   diversity index of plants and pollinators around windmills were similar
   to those found in grassland patches (a typical habitat for these
   insects) and higher than in the adjacent crops. Pollinator diversity
   index and species richness at windmills increased with the distance to
   the nearest grassland patch and windmill. The population sizes of
   pollinating insects were also positively associated with plant
   diversity. Particular groups of pollinators showed specific habitat
   associations: bees occurred mostly at windmills, butterflies were highly
   associated with grasslands, while flies occurred in a similar number at
   windmill and on grasslands. Since windmills are frequently built within
   extensive homogeneous fields, thus, they introduce pollination services
   into the interior of cropped areas, contrary to field margins, road
   verges, or seminatural grasslands. Thus, although the development of
   wind farms has various negative environmental consequences, they can be
   alleviated by the increase of the local population size and diversity of
   wild plants and pollinating insects at windmills.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports of pollinator declines have stirred interest in
   investigating the impacts of habitat exploitation on the conservation of
   pollinator and plant communities. An important prerequisite to tailor
   conservation action is to understand the drivers and patterns of
   species-rich communities, and how they change in space and time during a
   whole season. To account for this, we surveyed wild bees and flowering
   plants using standardized transects in 11 natural habitat fragments of
   an IUCN important plant area along the coast of Israel. We used
   phylogeny- and taxon-based methods of community structure analyses to
   study the assembly processes of bee communities, and investigated the
   effects of several landscape parameters on bee diversity using
   generalized linear models (GLMs). Our results illustrate that natural
   habitat sites comprised significantly higher species richness compared
   to disturbed habitat sites, and show that even the smallest habitat
   fragments harbored unique bee assemblages, with significant species
   replacement (turnover) found in both space and time. Our GLMs indicated
   that flower diversity, and semi-natural habitat within 500 m of habitat
   fragments were important drivers of bee diversity, but we found no
   evidence for a species-area relationship among sites. Finally, we
   document a case of phylogenetic overdispersion despite low species
   richness, which highlights the importance of accounting for phylogenetic
   diversity rather than only species richness to reach a more fine-grained
   understanding of pollinator diversity. This, in turn, is pivotal to
   developing conservation actions to protect these essential pollinators
   and their interaction with rare and endemic plant species in this highly
   threatened ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Supplementing small farms with native mason bees increases strawberry
   size and growth rate}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination services, especially those of bees, play a vital role in
   agriculture. Declining honeybee populations require us to find
   alternative solutions for sustainable agriculture. Native bees are
   proving to be efficient pollinators. Mason bees (Osmia lignaria) provide
   valuable pollinator services for some woody orchard species, but their
   value as pollinators for herbaceous crops is largely untested.
   2. We assessed the effectiveness of O. lignaria supplementation on nine
   strawberry farms over two growing seasons. We specifically selected
   mason bees for this work because they emerge from cocoons in the
   springtime, when few other bees are available for pollination. Cocoons
   are easily deployed on farms and emerged bees have a small flight
   radius, so they remain localized. We placed cocoons on one side of each
   berry farm plot (our mason bee addition treatment) but not on the
   opposite side (our control). We tagged and monitored berries on nine
   farms throughout the growing season. We performed statistical
   comparisons of berries from the treatment and control for differences in
   berry growth rate and size. In addition, we supplemented farms with
   native bee homes constructed from three materials (bamboo, Phragmites
   and wood). This allowed us to determine whether adult mason bees would
   produce a subsequent generation of bees on farms and whether the bees
   had a preference for nest material type.
   3. Our work demonstrates that mason bees can be used successfully to
   pollinate herbaceous berry crops. We found that berry growth rate was
   significantly higher and berry volume was significantly larger for
   berries from the treatment relative to the control. We also found that
   adult bees successfully utilized the bee homes for laying the next
   generation of offspring and that bees colonized bamboo homes more than
   other home types.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Our results are the first to show that
   native mason bees (Osmia lignaria) can be used successfully to provide
   pollination services on strawberry farms. Their use results in the
   production of bigger berries and faster berry growth rates than managed
   honeybees alone. Mason bees overwinter (and can be purchased) in
   cocoons, offering great potential for efficient and effective
   pollination services, for a variety of agricultural applications across
   different geographical regions. The availability of suitable nesting
   sites and protection of subsequent generations of cocoons from wasp
   parasitization warrant future consideration.}},

Title = {{Floral Trait Variations Among Wild Tobacco Populations Influence the
   Foraging Behavior of Hawkmoth Pollinators}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Most pollinators visit flowers in the search of nectar rewards. However,
   as the floral nectar can often not be directly detected by pollinators,
   many flower visitors use secondary metabolites such as odor- or
   taste-proxies to anticipate nectar quantity and quality. Plants might
   exploit these sensory inferences of the pollinator to increase their
   pollination rates without increasing their caloric investment into their
   floral rewards. Here we investigated the effects of natural variation in
   certain primary and secondary floral metabolites in three populations of
   the wild tobacco, Nicotiana attenuate, on the pollination behavior of
   the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. Although offering the same caloric value per
   flower, the plants of these populations differ in the compositions and
   concentrations of sugars within the nectar. Moreover, the flowers of
   these plants emitted highly contrasting levels of attractive floral
   volatiles (benzyl acetone), but did not differ in the amounts of
   defensive nectar metabolites (nicotine). In wind tunnel assays with M.
   sexta moths, plants from those populations that released the largest
   amount of benzyl acetone as well as those that had a higher ratio of
   nectar sucrose were more frequently visited and re-visited by the
   hawkmoth. High emissions of benzyl acetone additionally correlated with
   a higher time investment of the moths into individual flowers on each
   visit, leading to the largest foraging success of the moths on those
   flowers that were most strongly scented. We propose that it is the
   variation of flower metabolites and their detection by the pollinator
   rather than the actual caloric value of the nectar, which determines
   pollinator visitations to a certain flower population. Hence, plants
   could potentially create a specialist pollinator community by altering
   their floral signals, either by producing volatiles that pollinators
   prefer or by providing nectar sugars that pollinators are most sensitive
   to, while at the same time keeping the caloric value of their nectar
   rewards at a constant level. These findings highlight the importance of
   variations among floral signals and their detection by specific
   pollinators for plant diversification as well as for the evolution of
   specific plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Parameters estimation of photovoltaic (PV) model based on experimental
   data plays an important role in the simulation, evaluation, control, and

   developing hybrid algorithms based on two or more metaheuristic

   teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO) and artificial bee colony

Abstract = {{Pollinators are sensitive to agricultural intensification at both local
   and landscape scales. High configurational landscape heterogeneity due
   to small fields and a high amount of field boundaries is hypothesized to
   enhance farmland biodiversity. Here, we investigated the effects of
   organic vs. conventional farming in large- vs. small-scale agricultural
   landscapes on wild bee communities and their floral resources to improve
   conservation schemes for pollinators. We sampled bees in Central Germany
   at the field boundaries of 18 pairs of conventionally and organically
   managed winter wheat fields along the former iron curtain using pan
   traps and trap nests. Around traps, we surveyed species richness and
   flower cover of insect-pollinated forbs. Compared to conventional
   farming, organic farming was related to higher insect-pollinated forb
   species richness and flower cover in the field boundaries, presumably
   due to the lack of herbicide use. Interestingly, small-scale agriculture
   did not counteract the loss of floral resources under conventional
   management, as the difference to organic management was even larger in
   Western small-scale agriculture. Organic farming, but not small-scale
   agriculture, enhanced species richness of solitary bees, which is in
   line with their small home ranges. In contrast, bumblebees benefitted
   only from small-scale agriculture, which matches with their high
   dispersal ability. Despite similar levels of abundance and diversity of
   trap-nesting bees in the two landscape types, brood cell parasitism was
   also higher in small-scale agriculture. Both organic farming and
   small-scale agriculture directly and indirectly supported different
   groups of wild bees, suggesting long-term benefits for conservation.
   Agri environment schemes should acknowledge the so far neglected
   benefits of small-scale agriculture for biodiversity and its potential

Abstract = {{In intensive agricultural landscapes, decreased pollinator numbers have
   often been attributed to the loss of natural habitats. However, several
   studies show that certain mass flowering crops, such as oilseed rape
   (OSR), can alter the pattern of pollinator abundance at a field and
   landscape level. These studies have focused mainly on bees; information
   about the effect of OSR crops on other taxa is missing. We evaluated the
   abundance of bees and other (non-bee) flower visitors, and the fruit set
   of insect-pollinated target plants (Raphanus sativus and Onolnychis
   viciifolia) on the margins of OSR and cereal fields in landscapes with
   varying densities of non-cropped habitats (landscape structure). The
   presence of OSR crops and wildflower resources in field margins had
   varying effects on the abundance of bees and non-bee flower visitors.
   Bee abundance was enhanced by OSR crops, but decreased in complex
   landscapes. On the other hand, the abundance of non-bee flower visitors
   depended on the landscape structure, particularly on the location of
   cereal fields. Despite the numerous and diverse communities of
   pollinators attracted by OSR crops and wildflower resources, fruit set
   was enhanced only for generalist insect pollinated plant species,
   because competition processes for pollinators affect specialist plant
   species. We conclude that the incorporation of OSR crops and maintenance

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is one of the main causes for the current
   biodiversity crisis. While reversing habitat loss on agricultural land
   is challenging, increasing the farmland configurational heterogeneity
   (higher field border density) and farmland compositional heterogeneity

   loss. Here, we tested whether increased farmland configurational and
   compositional heterogeneity promote wild pollinators and plant
   reproduction in 229 landscapes located in four major western European
   agricultural regions. High-field border density consistently increased
   wild bee abundance and seed set of radish (Raphanus sativus), probably
   through enhanced connectivity. In particular, we demonstrate the
   importance of crop-crop borders for pollinator movement as an additional
   experiment showed higher transfer of a pollen analogue along crop-crop
   borders than across fields or along semi-natural crop borders. By
   contrast, high crop diversity reduced bee abundance, probably due to an
   increase of crop types with particularly intensive management. This
   highlights the importance of crop identity when higher crop diversity is
   promoted. Our results show that small-scale agricultural systems can
   boost pollinators and plant reproduction. Agri-environmental policies

   traits: Results from an individual-based model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Solitary bees are important but declining wild pollinators. During daily
   foraging in agricultural landscapes, they encounter a mosaic of patches
   with nest and foraging habitat and unsuitable matrix. It is
   insufficiently clear how spatial allocation of nesting and foraging
   resources and foraging traits of bees affect their daily foraging
   performance. We investigated potential brood cell construction (as proxy
   of fitness), number of visited flowers, foraging habitat visitation and
   foraging distance (pollination proxies) with the model SOLBEE
   (simulating pollen transport by solitary bees, tested and validated in
   an earlier study), for landscapes varying in landscape fragmentation and
   spatial allocation of nesting and foraging resources. Simulated bees
   varied in body size and nesting preference. We aimed to understand
   effects of landscape fragmentation and bee traits on bee fitness and the
   pollination services bees provide, as well as interactions between them,
   and the general consequences it has to our understanding of the system.
   This broad scope gives multiple key results. 1) Body size determines
   fitness more than landscape fragmentation, with large bees building
   fewer brood cells. High pollen requirements for large bees and the
   related high time budgets for visiting many flowers may not compensate
   for faster flight speeds and short handling times on flowers, giving
   them overall a disadvantage compared to small bees. 2) Nest preference
   does affect distribution of bees over the landscape, with cavity-nesting
   bees being restricted to nesting along field edges, which inevitably
   leads to performance reductions. Fragmentation mitigates this for
   cavity-nesting bees through increased edge habitat. 3) Landscape
   fragmentation alone had a relatively small effect on all responses.
   Instead, the local ratio of nest to foraging habitat affected bee
   fitness positively through reduced local competition. The spatial
   coverage of pollination increases steeply in response to this ratio for
   all bee sizes. The nest to foraging habitat ratio, a strong habitat
   proxy incorporating fragmentation could be a promising and practical
   measure for comparing landscape suitability for pollinators. 4) The
   number of flower visits was hardly affected by resource allocation, but
   predominantly by bee size. 5) In landscapes with the highest visitation
   coverage, bees flew least far, suggesting that these pollination proxies
   are subject to a trade-off between either longer pollen transport
   distances or a better pollination coverage, linked to how nests are
   distributed over the landscape rather than being affected by bee size.}},

Abstract = {{Wild and domestic bees are essential for the pollination of crops in
   home gardens, agroforests and vegetable fields of rice smallholders.
   However, it remains unclear how rice fields and agroforests affect
   pollinator communities. We investigated the effects of habitat loss and
   isolation on four different components of bee diversity: abundance,
   species richness, functional diversity, and plant-pollinator
   interactions.
   Flower-visiting bees were recorded in a lowland rice-based production
   region on the Philippines. We sampled two different land use systems
   (agroforests and rice fields) and along a gradient of habitat isolation
   (isolated rice fields and rice fields connected to agroforests).
   All components of bee diversity were higher in agroforests than in rice
   fields. Especially above-ground nesting and long-tongued species were
   adversely affected by rice field habitats and body sizes decreased with
   isolation from agroforests. For plant-pollinator interactions we found
   that plants received less diverse pollinator visits in isolated rice
   fields.
   In conclusion, agroforests provide important food and nesting resources
   for bees that translate into taxonomically and functionally diverse
   pollinator communities as well as stable pollinator visitation networks.
   These cultivation systems should therefore be maintained or expanded to
   ensure pollination services and bio-diversity conservation. On the
   contrary, rice fields provide habitat for only few generalist bee
   species and flower visitation is reduced in isolated rice fields,
   possibly also leading to impaired pollination of wild plants and crops.
   Connectivity between bee habitats located in rice production areas is
   probably disrupted even after a few hundred meters and should therefore
   be promoted by measures like flower strips in rice fields.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Plant reproductive success is often the outcome of mutualistic and
   antagonistic plant-animal interactions, which can be moderated by
   landscape composition. Studies addressing single plant-animal
   interactions are common, but studies simultaneously considering multiple
   plant-animal interactions in a landscape context are still scarce. We
   selectively excluded flower-visiting insects on phytometer plants and
   quantified how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions shaped the
   reproductive success of a common annual plant, wild mustard (Sinapis
   arvensis). Floral herbivory by larvae of rape pollen beetles (Meligethes
   spp.) strongly reduced fruit production, but could be minimized by
   insecticide application. Total seed production (the product of fruit
   production and seeds per fruit) strongly increased with pollinator
   visitation. On average, pollinator access to plants enhanced seed
   numbers by 754\%. Insecticide treatment almost redoubled this number.
   The landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitats in 1000 m
   radius) surrounding phytometer plants did not affect plant-animal
   interactions, presumably due to the high dispersal ability of both the
   pollen beetles and the major pollinators (syrphid flies, bumblebees). In
   conclusion, pest control increased reproductive success only in the case

Abstract = {{The majority of studies investigating the effects of landscape
   composition and configuration on bee populations have been conducted in
   regions of intensive agricultural production, ignoring regions which are
   dominated by seminatural habitats, such as the islands of the Aegean
   Archipelago. In addition, research so far has focused on the landscape
   impacts on bees sampled in cropped fields while the landscape effects on
   bees inhabiting seminatural habitats are understudied. Here, we
   investigate the impact of the landscape on wild bee assemblages in 66
   phryganic (low scrubland) communities on 8 Aegean islands. We computed
   landscape metrics (total area and total perimeter-area ratio) in 4
   concentric circles (250, 500, 750, and 1000 m) around the center of each
   bee sampling site including 3 habitat groups (namely phrygana,
   cultivated land, and natural forests). We further measured the local
   flower cover in 25 quadrats distributed randomly at the center of each
   sampling site. We found that the landscape scale is more important than
   the local scale in shaping abundance and species richness of bees.
   Furthermore, habitat configuration was more important than the total
   area of habitats, probably because it affects bees' movement across the
   landscape. Phrygana and natural forests had a positive effect on bee
   demographics, while cultivated land had a negative effect. This
   demonstrates that phryganic specialists drive bee assemblages in these
   seminatural landscapes. This finding, together with the shown importance
   of landscape scale, should be considered for the management of wild bees
   with special emphasis placed on the spatial configuration of seminatural
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Because the ecological similarity between species is expected to
   increase with relatedness and that speciation is a local process,
   phylogeny may provide a common measure for the influence of ecological
   and biogeographic processes on community assembly. We tested if
   similarities in floral visitation patterns within communities and the
   phylogenetic beta-diversity among communities were related to the
   position of bees within the bee phylogeny.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We combined a genus level phylogeny with within-genera
   phylogenies for the bee species occurring within 18 globally distributed
   bee-flower networks. Networks consisted of a matrix of bee and plant
   species and information on whether or not a bee species had been
   observed visiting flowers of a given plant species. For each network, we
   used Abouheif's C-mean to test if the similarity in floral associations
   (niche similarity) between bees and the number of plant species visited
   displayed a significant phylogenetic signal. To test if biogeography
   influenced the relatedness among species within networks we tested if
   the phylogenetic beta-diversity increased with geographical distance and
   dissimilarity in climatic conditions among networks.
   Results: We found a phylogenetic signal for niche similarity in only
   50\% of the bee-flower networks. However, network size influenced the
   likelihood of observing a phylogenetic signal and for seven of the eight
   bee-flower networks with >20 species it was statistically significant.
   On a global scale, the phylogenetic beta-diversity increased with
   geographical distances and with climatic dissimilarity between sites.
   Main conclusions: Bee communities are structured by processes of
   speciation and migration so that regional species pools are dominated by
   a subset of the global phylogenetic clades, resulting in increasing
   phylogenetic beta-diversity with geographical distance. Moreover,
   ecological filtering processes operating at both local (floral resource
   use) and continental (climatic constraints) scale determine the
   distribution of species among resources and geographical regions. The
   assembly of bee communities should therefore be understood as a product
   of both biogeographic and community ecological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Although grapevine is a crop that produces fruit without insect
   pollination, vineyards may provide resources for bees and other
   pollinators. Flower resources such as pollen and nectar are provided by
   the vine plants as well as other flowering plants including cover crops
   grown between the vine rows. Little is known about how management and
   landscape context affects bee communities in pollinator-independent crop
   systems such as grapevine. This study investigates the effect of organic
   versus conventional management on bee species richness and abundance in
   vineyards in Italy and South Africa both having a Mediterranean climate.
   In each country, six pairs of organic and conventional vineyards were
   studied in simplified and complex agricultural landscapes. A total of
   433 bee individuals from 25 species and 1049 individuals from 15 species
   were recovered in pan traps from Italy and South Africa respectively.
   Bee abundance showed region specific response to the effects of vineyard
   management. Flowering plants and proportion of uncultivated land
   mediated differences in bee abundance. Higher flowering plant species
   richness and flower density were found in organic vineyards compared to
   conventional vineyards in South Africa but these flowering plant indices
   were not significantly different between the two vineyard management
   types in Italy. This emphasizes the necessity for local and region

Abstract = {{The response and effect trait framework, if supported empirically, would
   provide for powerful and general predictions about how biodiversity loss
   leads to loss in ecosystem function. This framework proposes that
   species traits will explain how different species respond to disturbance
   (i.e. response traits) as well as their contribution to ecosystem
   function (i.e. effect traits). However, predictive response and effect
   traits remain elusive for most systems. Here, we use data on crop
   pollination services provided by native, wild bees to explore the role
   of six commonly used species traits in determining both species'
   response to land-use change and the subsequent effect on crop
   pollination. Analyses were conducted in parallel for three crop systems
   (watermelon, cranberry, and blueberry) located within the same
   geographical region (mid-Atlantic USA). Bee species traits did not
   strongly predict species' response to land-use change, and the few
   traits that were weakly predictive were not consistent across crops.
   Similarly, no trait predicted species' overall functional contribution
   in any of the three crop systems, although body size was a good
   predictor of per capita efficiency in two systems. Overall we were
   unable to make generalizable predictions regarding species responses to
   land-use change and its effect on the delivery of crop pollination
   services. Pollinator traits may be useful for understanding ecological
   processes in some systems, but thus far the promise of traits-based
   ecology has yet to be fulfilled for pollination ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollination is a vital ecosystem service, and wild bees are
   essential providers of this service for both crops and wild flowering
   plants. The early successional stage of a plantation, which can be
   dominated by grasses and herbaceous plant species, can provide a habitat

   successional plantation patches of different sizes, ranging from 1.3 to
   10 ha. We then applied a hierarchical community model to infer species
   richness/abundancearea relationships. The results showed that estimates
   of population densities of individual species were unchanged with
   respect to area, suggesting that smaller patches can have the same value

   for the small range of patch sizes examined. Total abundance was found
   to linearly increase with area. The inclusion of random site effects
   into the model resulted in significant density variations among patches;
   therefore, patch area was not the only determining factor of species
   abundance. These outcomes in relation to management operations for
   forests and plantations suggest that small patches of early successional

Abstract = {{Bacteria on floral tissue can have negative effects by consuming
   resources and affecting nectar quality, which subsequently could reduce
   pollinator visitation and plant fitness. Plants however can employ
   chemical defences to reduce bacteria density. In North American,
   bee-pollinated Penstemon digitalis, the nectar volatile S-(+)-linalool
   can influence plant fitness, and terpenes such as linalool are known for
   their antimicrobial properties suggesting that it may also play a role
   in plant-microbe interactions. Therefore, we hypothesized linalool could
   affect bacterial growth on P. digitalis plants/flowers. Because P.
   digitalis emits linalool from nectar and nectary tissue but not petals,
   we hypothesised that the effects of linalool could depend on tissue of
   origin due to varying exposure. We isolated bacteria from nectary
   tissue, petals and leaves, and compared their growth relative to control
   using two volatile concentrations representing the natural emission
   range of linalool. To assess whether effects were specific to linalool,
   we compared results with the co-occurring nectar volatile, methyl
   nicotinate. We show that response to floral volatiles can be substance
