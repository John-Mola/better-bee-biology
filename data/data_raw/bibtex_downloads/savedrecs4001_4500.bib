Title = {{Use of Commercially Available Pollenizers for Optimizing Triploid
   Watermelon Production}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted during 2005 and 2006 in Kinston, NC, with
   the objective of maximizing triploid watermelon {[} Citrullus lanatus
   (Thunb.) Matsum, and Nak.] fruit yield and quality by optimizing the
   choice and use of pollenizers. Treatments were pollenizer cultivars
   planted singly {[}'Companion', `Super Pollenizer 1' ('SP1'), `Summer
   Flavor 800' ('SF800'), and `Mickylee'] or in pairs ('Companion' + `SP1',
   `Companion' + `SF800', and `SP1' + `SF800'). All pollenizers from these
   seven treatments were inter-planted with the triploid cultivar
   Tri-X-313. Planting arrangement was compared by establishing `SF800' in
   a hill versus an interplanted held arrangement. Effect of pollenizer
   establishment timing on triploid fruit yields and quality was evaluated
   by establishing `SP1' 3 weeks after planting and comparing it with the
   establishment of `SP1' at the time of triploid plant establishment.
   Finally, a triploid planting with no pollenizer (control) was included
   to determine pollen movement. Fruit yield from the control was 22\% or
   less of yield of the other treatments containing a pollenizer and less
   than 10\% in the initial or early harvests. Pollen movement was minimal
   among plots and differences in yield and fruit quality could be at to
   pollenizer treatment. In 2005, the use of `Companion', `SP1', or
   `Mickylee' as pollenizers produced similar total yields, whereas `SF800'
   produced the lowest yield. In 2005, `Companion' produced more large
   fruit than the other individual pollenizer treatments. Combining the
   pollenizers generally did not enhance triploid yields or quality.
   Interplanting of pollenizers consistently resulted in greater yield
   compared with the hill system. Late planting of `SP1' increased the
   incidence of hollow heart in the marketable fruit and decreased yield
   compared with simultaneously planting `SP1' and triploid plants. Thus,
   selection of pollenizer, planting arrangement, and time of pollenizer
   establishment are all important considerations to optimizing triploid
   yield and quality.}},

Abstract = {{A useful technique for synchronizing pollinators with the alfalfa.
   Medicago savita L. (Fabaceae), bloom is to interrupt the late spring
   incubation of developing bee pupae and pharate adults of Megachile
   rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) with short-term
   low-temperature storage. However, low-temperature exposure can be
   stressful depending on the temperature, duration of exposure, and the
   developmental stage exposed. To evaluate the effect of low-temperature
   storage after development had already been initiated by exposure to 29
   degrees C, three developmental stages (eye pigment pupae, body pigment
   pupae, and pharate adults ready to emerge) were exposed to 6, 12, or 18
   degrees C for durations up to 28 d. The effect of delaying the
   termination of overwintering storage (6 C) from April to July ({''}April
   bees and ``July bees,{''} respectively) also was examined. The following
   observations were made: 1) All developmental stages of the April bees
   and July bees examined can be stored without harmful effects, as
   measured by percentage of survival, for 14 d at 12 C and above. 2)
   Postponing the termination of overwintering storage at 6 degrees C from
   April until July significantly decreased the mean number of days to 95\%
   adult emergence in the July ready-to-emerge bees across the three
   temperatures tested. 3) The increase of overwintering duration also
   caused a decrease in the postemergence longevity of the ready-to-emerge
   adults stored at 6 degrees C for 14 d. 4) Of the three storage
   temperatures examined, 18 degrees C seems to be the optimal storage
   temperature for short-term storage of developing bees because of their
   slow but continuing development without increased mortality either
   during storage or after emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding behavioural interactions among ancestrally solitary
   species is key to understanding the evolutionary origins of group living
   and cooperation. Previously, Packer (2006) showed that circle tube
   arenas can be used to evaluate the social status of species for which
   nesting data are unavailable. We used circle tube arenas to study the
   behaviour among 30 female dyads of the solitary halictid bee, Xeralictus
   bicuspidariae Snelling, a member of the subfamily Rophitinae, all
   members of which are ancestrally solitary. Overall, 75.2\% of frontal
   encounters resulted in avoidance, 20.7\% in aggression, and 4.1\% in a
   successful pass, values which are similar to those previously observed
   in solitary halictids. Although passing events, which are interpreted as
   cooperative behaviour, were rare, they were significantly correlated
   with bees' rates of approach and avoidance, and also with differences
   between dyad members in rates of ovarian development. Rates of
   aggression were not correlated with physical traits of females or with
   other behaviours. We compare the circle tube behaviour of X.
   bicuspidariae to previously studied solitary and social halictids, and
   provide statistical support for this method of assessing social status.}},

Abstract = {{The federally endangered crenulate leadplant, Amorpha herbacea Walter
   var. crenulata (Rydb.) Isely, is an endemic shrub of the globally
   imperiled pine rocklands of southern Florida. Crenulate leadplant is
   near extinction in the wild due to heavy habitat loss, fire suppression,
   altered hydrology, and invasion by non-native species. This study
   examined the floral biology and breeding system of the leadplant and
   factors that may help explain its decline and provide direction for
   conservation. Protogynous flowers and a high pollen/ovule ratio suggest
   a reproductive strategy of outcrossing, while a binucleate pollen grain
   indicates possible gametophytic self-incompatibility. Hand pollinations
   show that while the leadplant is capable of some self-fertilization, it
   is significantly more successful in setting fruit when cross-pollinated,
   and produces a greater percentage of seed when outcrossed. This
   predominantly self-incompatible species may, therefore, suffer decreased
   reproductive fitness in its few remnant localities.}},

   brown. The leaves were odd pinnate and usually alternate with an average
   of 22.68cm long and 3.92cm width having 11.4 leaflets; midrib and rachis
   occasionally striped red. Leaf shading started in November and remained
   up to February. For floral biology, flowers and inflorescences were
   marked and observed until fruit set. Inflorescences appeared as
   clustered racemes on distal parts of new and old wood. The flowers were
   bloom with pink or reddish to lavender color during January and
   February. The fruit was green, tinged reddish purple when imature, light
   yellow-brown when mature narrow an average of 13.8 cm long, 2cm wide,
   5-9 numbers of seeds/pods yellow-brown nearly round. Plants planted
   through seeds and cuttings had better biomass production of cuttings as
   compared to seeds. The nutrients concentration percentage showed minimum

Abstract = {{Species composition and population dynamics of hoverflies
   (Diptera:Syrphidae) in relation to some abiotic and biotic factors were
   studied over a year long period in the District Multan, Pakistan. The
   community of hoverflies was composed of 14 species which were recorded
   from 59 plant species. Among Syrphinae, Ischiodon scutellaris,
   Episyrphus balteatus and Sphaerophoria bengalensis were the most
   abundant whereas among Milesiinae, Eristalinus aeneus and Eristalinus
   laetus were the most frequent floral visitors. The peak abundance and
   richness of hoverflies was observed in spring (March-April), the time
   when the maximum numbers (35) of plant species were in flowering. Only
   four species i.e. E. aeneus, E. laetus, Mesembrius bengalensis and
   Paragus serratus remained active all through the year in variable
   abundance. Among agricultural and wild plant species, Mangifera indica
   and Launaea procumbens were visited by the maximum number of syrphid
   species or in highest abundance, respectively. On! the basis of
   similarity in floral host plant visitation frequencies, Syrphinae could
   easily be distinguished from Miliesiinae. Abundance of hoverflies was

Abstract = {{The corolla tube length of the bumblebee-pollinated plant Isodon
   umbrosus shows conspicuous geographical variation, corresponding with
   the proboscis length of its bumblebee pollinators across its
   distributional range. We hypothesized that altitudinal variation in the
   pollinator assemblage is a principal factor mediating morphological and
   genetic differentiation among I. umbrosus populations. We examined
   determinants of the morphological and genetic differentiation of Isodon
   umbrosus by analyzing floral morphology and allozyme variation across
   the distributional range. A reanalysis of previous data confirmed that
   altitude was a good indicator of pollinator assemblages. Corolla tube
   length was highly variable among the 15 study populations, and genetic
   differentiation among the populations (G(ST) = 0.360) was also highly
   significant. The differentiation in corolla tube length was explained by
   altitudinal difference, a proxy of the difference in pollinator
   assemblages. Genetic differentiation among populations also tended to be
   affected by the same factor, but statistical support was weak. To better
   understand the mechanisms responsible for morphological and genetic
   differentiation in I. umbrosus, we need to investigate altitudinally
   different populations over a narrower geographical scale.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the genetic architecture of admixed hybridizing
   populations helps in evaluating the nature of species boundaries and the
   levels of gene exchange between co-occurring species. In the present
   study, we examined a contact zone between Serapias vomeracea and
   Serapias cordigera, two unrewarding Mediterranean orchid species with a
   non-specific pollination strategy. Fruit production and seed viability
   from interspecific hand-pollination treatments pointed out the
   weaknesses of post-pollination barriers. The occurrence of hybridization
   was molecularly confirmed in the genus Serapias for the first time, as
   parts of plants with a transitional morphology were observed in both
   alleles of the parental LEAFY intron. Amplified fragment length
   polymorphism analysis revealed that plants with uncertain morphology and
   classified as one of the other parental species are actually
   backcrosses, attesting to an extensive interspecific gene exchange.
   Overall, the contact zone is more similar to a hybrid zone of Ophrys
   species, well known for their highly specialized pollination, than to a
   hybrid zone of unspecialized food-deceptive orchids. Therefore, species
   boundaries in Serapias are maintained by pre-pollination mechanisms that
   need to be better investigated. In light of the intriguing similarities
   between Serapias and Ophrys underlined by the present study, we
   hypothesize that the emission of floral scents could be involved in the
   maintenance of species boundaries in Serapias.}},

   2006 to August, 2007. From the 42 pollen types collected, the more

   (Eucalyptus spp.) and Mimosaceae family. The peaks for the values of the
   trophic niche breadth (H') in September (2.32), November (2.29) and
   October (2.02) showed that these bees can be generalist, depending upon
   availabilities and characteristics of flower sources. The values for
   equitability (J') also showed more uniform use of pollen sources during
   these months. The meteorological features (temperature, relative
   humidity and rainfall) did not show a direct relation to equitability
   and niche breadth. Equitability and niche breadth seem to be more
   related to the daily or seasonal cycles of pollen and nectar production.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the rules and mechanisms that determine the composition and
   diversity of naturally co-occurring species assemblages is a central
   topic in community ecology. Although micro-organisms represent the
   `unseen majority' of species, individuals and biomass in many ecosystems
   and play pivotal roles in community development and function, the study
   of the factors influencing the assembly of microbial communities has
   lagged behind that of plant and animal communities. In this paper, we
   investigate experimentally the mechanisms accounting for the low species
   richness of yeast communities inhabiting the nectar of the
   bumble-bee-pollinated Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae), and explore
   the relationships between community assembly rules and phylogenetic
   relatedness. By comparing yeast communities on the glossae of foraging
   bumble-bees (the potential species pool) with those eventually
   establishing in virgin nectar probed with bee glossae (the realized
   community), we address the questions: (i) does nectar filter yeast
   inocula, so that the communities eventually established there are not
   random subsamples of species on bumble-bee glossae? and (ii) do yeast
   communities establishing in H. foetidus nectar exhibit some phylogenetic
   bias relative to the species pool on bumble-bee glossae? Results show
   that nectar filtering leads to species-poor, phylogenetically clustered
   yeast communities that are a predictable subset of pollinator-borne
   inocula. Such strong habitat filtering is probably due to H. foetidus
   nectar representing a harsh environment for most yeasts, where only a
   few phylogenetically related nectar specialists physiologically endowed
   to tolerate a combination of high osmotic pressure and fungicidal
   compounds are able to develop.}},

Title = {{Winter Active Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) Achieve High Foraging Rates
   in Urban Britain}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Foraging bumblebees are normally associated with spring and
   summer in northern Europe. However, there have been sightings of the
   bumblebee Bombus terrestris during the warmer winters in recent years in
   southern England. But what floral resources are they relying upon during
   winter and how much winter forage can they collect?
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To test if urban areas in the UK provide
   a rich foraging niche for bees we set up colonies of B. terrestris in
   the field during two late winter periods (2005/6 \& 2006/7) in London,
   UK, and measured their foraging performance. Fully automatic
   radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology was used in 2006/7 to
   enable us to record the complete foraging activity of individually
   tagged bees. The number of bumblebees present during winter (October
   2007 to March 2008) and the main plants they visited were also recorded
   during transect walks. Queens and workers were observed throughout the
   winter, suggesting a second generation of bee colonies active during the
   winter months. Mass flowering shrubs such as Mahonia spp. were
   identified as important food resources. The foraging experiments showed
   that bees active during the winter can attain nectar and pollen foraging
   rates that match, and even surpass, those recorded during summer.
   Conclusions/Significance: B. terrestris in the UK are now able to
   utilise a rich winter foraging resource in urban parks and gardens that
   might at present still be under-exploited, opening up the possibility of
   further changes in pollinator phenology.}},

   The species is found in Central America with its host, Centris

   the genus. The egg/mature oocyte of C chichimeca, unusually small (like
   known eggs of other Coelioxys), is described. its is egg placement in
   the wall of the brood chamber. The anatomy and behavior of each of the
   five larval instars is described. The First instar develops within the
   egg chorion. from which the second instar emerges. The second and third
   instars apparently normally remain attached by their posterior ends
   either to the egg chorion or to the place where the egg had been
   attached to the cell wall. The second instar possesses an array of large
   spines on the outer surface of each Mandible thought to rupture the
   thick chorion, thus allowing eclosion. Both second and third instars
   have modified head capsules and mandibles enabling them to attack host
   immatures. Both instars possess in extremely large pair of spiracles oil
   the eighth abdominal segment and lesser-enlarged spiracles on the two
   preceding abdominal segments as well as enlarged internal lateral
   tracheal trunks. These modifications are likely related to the need for
   the larva to acquire air from the substrate while the body is submerged
   in nectar. Fourth and fifth instars, no longer attached to the
   substrate. assume the morphological attributes and behavior of normal
   provisions-consuming megachilid larvae. The last larval instar defecates
   and afterwards spins a cocoon bearing a conspicuous nipple. A male pupa
   is also illustrated and described.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is related to fitness in many insects. In solitary bees
   offspring body size is largely determined by maternal provisions and
   microclimate. We studied the effect of quantity and quality of
   provisions and rearing temperatures (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) on body
   size in the Red Mason bee, Osmia bicornis. Cocoon weight increased with
   provision weight and decreased with increasing temperature. High
   temperature (30 degrees C) led to high mortality of larvae and smaller
   body size, partly due to incomplete consumption of the provisions.
   Diversity of pollen in the provisions was low, and most provisions
   primarily consisted of mainly oak and maple pollen. Pollen diversity did
   not affect cocoon weight and males provided with pure oak or pure maple
   pollen showed similar adult size. Our results suggest that the quantity
   of provisions and temperature, but not pollen quality influence the
   development of O. bicornis progeny and might affect population dynamics
   of this abundant European pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Production of biofuel feedstocks in agricultural landscapes will result
   in land use changes that may have major implications for
   arthropod-mediated ecosystem services such as pollination and pest
   suppression. By comparing the abundance and diversity of insect
   pollinators and generalist natural enemies in three model biofuel crops:
   corn, switch-grass, and mixed prairie, we tested the hypothesis that
   biofuel crops comprised of more diverse plant communities would support
   increased levels of beneficial insects. These three biofuel crops
   contained a diverse bee community comprised of 75 species. Overall, bees
   were three to four times more abundant in switchgrass and prairie than
   in corn, with members of the sweat bee (Halictidae) and small carpenter
   bee (Ceratina spp.) groups the most abundant. Switchgrass and prairie
   had significantly greater bee species richness than corn during the July
   sampling period. The natural enemy community at these sites was
   dominated by lady beetles (Coccinellidae), long-legged flies
   (Dolichopodidae), and hover flies (Syrphidae) which varied in their
   response to crop type. Coccinellids were generally most abundant in
   prairie and switchgrass, with the exception of the pollen feeding
   Coleomegilla maculata that was most abundant in corn. Several rare or
   declining coccinellid species were detected in prairie and switchgrass
   sites. Dolichopodidae were more abundant in prairie and switchgrass
   while Syrphidae showed no significant response to crop type. Our results
   indicate that beneficial insects generally responded positively to the
   increased vegetational diversity of prairie and switchgrass sites;
   however, when managed as a dedicated biofuel crop, plant and arthropod
   diversity in switchgrass may decrease. Our findings support the
   hypothesis that vegetationally diverse biofuel crops support higher
   abundance and diversity of beneficial insects. Future policy regarding
   the production of biofuel feedstocks should consider the ecosystem
   services that different biofuel crops may support in agricultural
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{To preserve populations of endangered bee species, sound knowledge of
   their maximum foraging distance between nest and host plants is crucial.
   Previous investigations predicted maximum foraging distances of 100-200
   m for small bee species and up to 1100 m for very large species based on
   mainly indirect methods. The present study applied a new and direct
   approach to experimentally investigate maximum foraging distances in
   solitary bees. One endangered and two common species of different body
   sizes, all of which restrict pollen foraging to a single plant genus,
   were established in a landscape lacking their specific host plants.
   Females were forced to collect pollen on potted host plants that were
   successively placed in increasing distance from fixed nesting stands.
   The maximum foraging distance recorded for the small Hylaeus
   punctulatissimus was 1100 m, for the medium sized Chelostoma rapunculi
   1275 m and for the large Hoplitis adunca 1400 m, indicating that maximum
   foraging distances at species level have been underestimated. However,
   the capability to use resources on such a large spatial scale applied
   only to a small percentage of individuals as 50\% of the females of H.
   punctulatissimus and H. adunca did not forage at distances longer than
   100-225 m and 300 m, respectively. This finding suggests that a close
   neighbourhood of nesting and foraging habitat within few hundred meters
   is crucial to maintain populations of these species, and that threshold
   distances at which half of the population discontinues foraging are a
   more meaningful parameter for conservation practice than the species
   specific maximum foraging distances. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Flower-visiting insect activity to the rare Symphyotrichum sericeum
   (Vent.) G.L. Nesom and the common Solidago nemoralis Ait. var.
   longipetiolata (Mack. \& Bush) Pal. \& Steyerm. was examined to detect
   compositional and temporal similarities. A hand pollination experiment
   was conducted to determine whether pollen was limiting seed set. Of the
   31 insect taxa that visited these plants, Bombus bifarius Cresson was
   the most common visitor to both species. More insect visitors of the
   Halictidae and Bombyliidae were received by S. sericeum than S.
   nemoralis, which received more visitors of the Syrphidae and Tachinidae.
   The insect visitation rate was not significantly different between the
   two plant species. Solidago nemoralis was visited by fewer insect taxa
   per day than S. sericeum, but the constancy of its visitors was higher.
   The insect visitor composition changed over time, with B. bifarius
   ignoring S. sericeum plants initially, then visiting them more
   frequently as the number of receptive S. nemoralis capitula declined.
   Hand pollination increased seed set in the earliest flowering capitula
   of S. sericeum, but not for those flowering during the peak. This
   research shows that the quantity of insect visits to the rare plant is
   comparable with that of the common plant but that pollination quality
   may be lower, particularly for early blooming capitula.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of appropriate pollinators is believed to be an impediment to
   naturalization of orchids. We studied the self-compatibility and
   pollination of an invasive, showy, rewardless, terrestrial orchid
   (Cyrtopodium polyphyllum (Vell.) Pabst ex F. Barrios) in southern
   Florida. Pollination treatments indicated that the orchid is
   self-compatible but not autogamous. Visitor observations indicated that
   the orchid is pollinated by an invasive specialist oil-collecting bee
   (Centris nitida Smith). The presence of the invasive Centris nitida has
   probably contributed to the naturalization of this probable oil reward
   mimicking orchid in Florida. We contrasted our results in the orchid's
   native range. In the invasive range in Florida, the orchid experiences a
   lower inbreeding depression. In both areas, the orchid is pollinated by
   Centris species and the pollination of the orchid is apparently enhanced
   by the presence of oil-rewarding species of the Malpighiaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen limitation of plant reproduction occurs in many plant species,
   particularly those in fragmented habitat; however, causes of pollen
   limitation arc often unknown. We investigated the relationship between
   pollen limitation and pollinator visitation in the purple coneflower.
   Echinacea angustifolia (Asteraceae), which grows in the extremely
   fragmented tallgrass prairie of North America. Previous investigations
   showed that pollen limitation of E. angustifolia increases with plant
   isolation and decreases with population size. We observed insect
   visitation to E. angustifolia over two flowering seasons and estimated
   pollen limitation of observed plants, using seed set as a proxy measure
   in 2004 and persistence of receptive style rows in 2005. We analyzed
   spatial patterns of bee visitation and pollination at two spatial
   scales: individual isolation, as measured by the distance to their kth
   nearest flowering neighbors (k = 1-15), and population size. Our results
   indicate that E. angustifolia is pollinated by over 26 species of native
   bees, with 70-75\% of visits by halictid bees. Surprisingly, in both
   years, bee visitation increased with isolation of individual plants and
   did not vary significantly with population size. As expected, plant
   isolation increased pollen limitation and lowered seed set. There was no
   effect population size on seed set in 2004, and pollen limitation
   decreased nonsignificantly with population size in 2005. We conclude
   that pollen receipt limits reproduction in E. angustifolia, but
   pollinator visitation does not. Remarkably, isolated plants
   simultaneously have increased rates of pollinator visitation by
   pollinators and decreased reproduction. We discuss alternative
   explanations of pollen limitation that are consistent with this apparent
   discrepancy, including a decline in the availability of compatible
   conspecific pollen with increased plant isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Learning ability allows insects to respond to a variable environment,
   and to adjust their behaviors in response to positive or negative
   experiences. Pollinating insects readily learn to associate floral
   characteristics, such as color, shape, or pattern, with appetitive
   stimuli, such as the presence of a nectar reward. However, in nature
   pollinators may also encounter flowers that contain distasteful or toxic
   nectar, or offer highly variable nectar volumes, providing opportunities
   for aversive learning or risk-averse foraging behavior. Whereas some
   bees learn to avoid flowers with unpalatable or unreliable nectar
   rewards, little is known about how Lepidoptera respond to such stimuli.
   We used a reversal learning paradigm to establish that monarch
   butterflies learn to discriminate against colored artificial flowers
   that contain salt solution, decreasing both number of probes and probing
   time on flowers of a preferred color and altogether avoiding artificial
   flowers of a non-preferred color. In addition, when we offered
   butterflies artificial flowers of two different colors, both of which
   contained the same mean nectar volume but which differed in variance,
   the monarchs exhibited risk-averse foraging: they probed the constant
   flowers significantly more than the variable ones, regardless of flower
   color or butterfly sex. Our results add to our understanding of
   butterfly foraging behavior, as they demonstrate that monarchs can
   respond to aversive as well as appetitive stimuli, and can also adjust
   their foraging behavior to avoid floral resources with high variance
   rewards.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{At a global scale the area devoted to agricultural cultivation that
   depends upon insect pollination has grown steadily and, therefore, an
   increased demand of this service would be expected. However lack of
   pollinators is not always an essential factor in the productive system
   at farm level. The present work evaluates the perceptions of passion
   fruit (Passiflora edulis) producers about the main factors determining
   their productivity in three Colombian departments (Huila, Meta and Valle
   del Cauca). In Valle, pollination is manually applied to complement
   insect pollination, and cultivation areas are more isolated from natural
   or semi-natural forests, have a higher density and are subjected to more
   frequent pesticide application than in Huila and Meta. In Meta,
   cultivation depends exclusively on bee (Xylocopa) pollination, density
   of cultivated lots is lower plots are more isolated from
   natural/semi-natural habitat, and pesticide are applied with a lower
   frequency. Eventual interventions to insure the provision of natural
   pollination services would differ For instance, in Valle and Huila the
   probability that producers will adopt the concept of pollination
   services to justify habitat conservation is low, given the
   intensification level observed. In order to improve the level of natural
   pollination services supplied for passion fruit culture in these
   localities, organic production schemes must be promoted, and/or small
   habitat fringes close to the cultivation areas be restored.}},

Abstract = {{In many insect-pollinated angiosperms, stamens are grown with anthers
   cohered, which might affect pollination processes, but the ecological
   significance of this fusion of anthers remains unexplored. We studied
   the breeding system and pollination process of didynamous Campsis
   grandiflora (Bignoniaceae), with anther fusion in pairs. Pollen removal
   and deposition were studied in the field for naturally fused versus
   experimentally separated anthers. Campsis grandiflora flowers were
   protandrous, with a low pollen : ovule ratio, were mostly outcrossed,
   and were self-compatible, with pollinators needed. The main pollinators
   were pollen-collecting halictid bees and nectar-feeding vespid wasps.
   Halictid bees scooped pollen on long anthers for a significantly longer
   time period and removed twice as much pollen from fused anthers than
   from separated anthers. Vespid wasps contacted fused short anthers more
   frequently and more precisely and removed nearly twice as much pollen
   than when contacting separated short anthers. Pollen deposition on
   stigmas was not affected by manipulation of either pair of anthers. Our
   results suggest that anther fusion can promote pollen removal efficiency
   by aggregating anthers at a similar position, increasing the
   pollinator's contact probability and precision with anthers and
   extending the visit duration of the pollinator. The maintenance of
   didynamous stamens may reflect functional advantages of the fused
   anthers in two distinct heights because they can interact with
   pollinators of different behaviors and sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Plants experience damage to both their vegetative and their reproductive
   parts. Loss of leaf area can affect subsequent photosynthesis and
   resources available for growth and reproduction; damage to flowers can
   result in loss of ovules and seeds by consumption, but herbivory may
   also disfigure flowers, interfering with their functions of attracting
   and rewarding pollinators. We examined natural populations of the
   butterfly pea, Centrosema virginianum, in pine rockland habitat in
   Everglades National Park (intact habitat) and a pine rockland fragment
   in suburban Miami-Dade County to answer the following questions: (1)
   What is the breeding system of C. virginianum? (2) What are the
   pollinators of this species in southern Florida pine rocklands? And (3)
   how are flower herbivores affecting pollinator visitation and subsequent
   fruit set? Controlled hand-pollination experiments revealed this species
   to be self-compatible but requiring visitation/pollination for fruit
   set. Cross-pollinated flowers and open-pollinated flowers set
   substantially more seed per fruit than did self-pollinated flowers.
   Flowers are visited by a variety of bees (Bombus pensylvanicus, Xylocopa
   micans, Megachile spp., and Melissodes spp.), which serve as
   pollinators. Flowers were produced abundantly in areas that had
   experienced recent fires, and roughly half of the flowers were damaged
   by one of two florivore guilds (blister beetles that ate the flowers and
   petal-sucking flies in the family Agromyzidae). Damaged flowers were
   visited much less frequently by pollinators than were undamaged flowers,
   and, consequently, they set many fewer fruit and much less seed. We
   conclude that florivory is a major impediment to successful pollination
   and plant sexual reproduction of C. virginianum in areas where the
   species naturally occurs.}},

Title = {{How do landscape composition and configuration, organic farming and
   fallow strips affect the diversity of bees, wasps and their parasitoids?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Habitat destruction and increasing land use intensity result in
   habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, and subsequently in the
   loss of species diversity. The fact that these factors are often highly
   confounded makes disentangling their effects extremely difficult, if not
   impossible, and their relative impact on species loss is mostly
   speculative.
   2. In a two-year study, we analysed the relative importance of changed
   landscape composition (increased areas of cropped habitats), reduced
   habitat connectivity and reduced habitat quality on nest colonization of
   cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids. We selected 23 pairs
   of conventional and organic wheat fields in the centre of landscape
   circles (500 m radius) differing in edge densities (landscape
   configuration) and \% non-crop habitats (landscape composition).
   Standardized trap nests were established in the field centres and in
   neighbouring permanent fallow strips (making a total of 92 nesting
   sites).
   3. Factors at all three scales affected nest colonization. While bees
   were enhanced by high proportions of non-crop habitat in the landscape,
   wasps profited from high edge densities, supporting our hypothesis that
   wasps are enhanced by connecting corridors. Colonization of
   herbivore-predating wasps was lower in field centres than in fallow
   strips for conventional sites, but not for organic sites, indicating a
   fallow-like connectivity value of organic fields. The relative
   importance of habitat type and farming system varied among functional
   groups suggesting that their perception of crop-non-crop boundaries or
   the availability of their food resources differed.
   4. Local and landscape effects on parasitoids were mainly mediated by
   their hosts. Parasitism rates were marginally affected by local factors.
   A specialist parasitoid was more sensitive to high land use intensity
   than its host, whereas generalist parasitoids were less sensitive.
   5. We conclude that the conversion of cropland into non-crop habitat may
   not be a sufficiently successful strategy to enhance wasps or other
   species that suffer more from isolation than from habitat loss.
   Interestingly, habitat connectivity appeared to be enhanced by both
   higher edge densities and by organic field management. Thus, we conclude
   that high proportions of conventionally managed and large crop fields
   threaten pollination and biological control services at a landscape
   scale.}},

Title = {{Combined effects of Impatiens glandulifera invasion and landscape
   structure on native plant pollination}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{440-450}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Habitat loss, land use intensification and biological invasions are
   all threatening pollinator communities, but the combined effects of
   these factors on pollinator diversity and pollination services have not
   been studied yet.
   2. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (i) the invasive plant Impatiens
   glandulifera outcompetes native plant communities for pollinators, and
   (ii) pollinator abundances depend on landscape structure, but are
   modulated by this mass-flowering invader.
   3. We selected 14 study sites in riparian habitats along a landscape
   gradient with decreasing proportion of natural land cover. Within each
   site paired invaded or non-invaded plots were studied. We performed
   standardized surveys of pollinators and established experimental plots
   by adding the native plant Raphanus sativus to assess the impact of I.
   glandulifera on visitation rates and seed set.
   4. Impatiens glandulifera was well integrated in the plant-pollinator
   network, being visited by several native pollinators, mainly bumblebees.
   The invader received higher visitation rates than simultaneously
   flowering native riparian plants and the experimentally added native R.
   sativus. However, visitation rates to the native plant community showed
   no significant differences between invaded and non-invaded plots, with
   the exception of honeybees, which slightly increased their visits in
   invaded plots. With regard to the experimental setting, the presence of
   I. glandulifera reduced bumblebee visitation to R. sativus pots, but had
   no significant effects on seed set.
   5. We found enhanced visitation rates of bumblebees in intensively used
   agricultural landscapes. However, in the presence of I. glandulifera
   this landscape effect was masked by bumblebees being highly attracted to
   I. glandulifera stands independent of the structure of the surrounding
   landscape. Surprisingly, wild bees and hoverflies were not affected by
   landscape structure, but, as also the case with bumblebees, they were
   principally affected by the immediate community flower abundance.
   6. Synthesis. Our data provide no evidence that I. glandulifera
   outcompetes native plants for pollinators. However, social bees were
   very attracted to this late-seasonal floral resource. We conclude that
   both, plant invasions and landscape structure have important effects on
   the plant-pollinator community studied, but that they operate at
   different stages of the flowering season.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of prey sensory systems are important factors shaping the
   design of signals generated by organisms exploiting them. In this study
   we assessed how prey sensory preference affected the exploiter signal
   design by investigating the evolutionary relationship and relative
   attractiveness of linear and cruciate form web decorations built by
   Argiope spiders. Because insects have an innate preference for
   bilaterally symmetrical patterns, we hypothesized that cruciate form
   decorations were evolved from linear form due to their higher visual
   attractiveness to insects. We first reconstructed a molecular phylogeny
   of the Asian members of the genus Argiope using mitochondrial markers to
   infer the evolutionary relationship of two decoration forms. Results of
   ancestral character state reconstruction showed that the linear form was
   ancestral and the cruciate form derived. To evaluate the luring
   effectiveness of two decoration forms, we performed field experiments in
   which the number and orientation of decoration bands were manipulated.
   Decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form were significantly more
   attractive to insects than those arranged in a linear form, no matter
   whether they were composed of silks or dummies. Moreover, dummy
   decoration bands arranged in a cruciate form attracted significantly
   more insects than those arranged in a vertical/horizontal form. Such
   results suggest that pollinator insects' innate preference for certain
   bilateral or radial symmetrical patterns might be one of the driving
   forces shaping the arrangement pattern of spider web decorations.}},

Abstract = {{The comparative pollination biology of a population of Primula beesiana,
   a population of P bulleyana, and an overlapping population of these two
   species in Yulong Shan, Yunnan Province, China, was studied in 2004 and
   2005. The results indicate that both P beesiana and P bulleyana are
   typical heterostylous and obligate outcrossing species; the main
   pollinators of the two species were bees and butterflies. At the sites
   of all three populations, the main pollinating visitors of the two
   species showed preference for one of the two species, resulting in the
   ethological isolation of the two species by the pollinators. This
   ethological isolation contributes to the reproductive isolation of the
   two species, which supports the hypothesis that P beesiana and P
   bulleyana are two distinct species. The reproductive isolation of the
   two species (ethological isolation) is probably an important mechanism
   in maintaining species boundaries in the genus and has contributed to
   the species diversification of Primula in the area. In addition, gene
   exchanges between P beesiana and P bulleyana has occurred to some extent
   in the overlapping population, but whether natural hybridization has
   contributed to species diversification in Primula remains to be

Abstract = {{Regularly, macroscopic sulfur deficiency can be found in oilseed rape on
   production fields. Severe sulfur deficiency causes unique flower
   symptoms with changes in colour from bright to pale yellow and
   modifications in shape and size of the petals. Less known is the fact
   that sulfur deficiency alters the scent of flowers. It was shown in
   previous studies that this has severe implications for pollinating
   insects such as honeybees. So far no studies exist, which investigated
   the influence of the sulfur nutritional status on the emission of
   volatiles by other agricultural plants during flowering. In the present
   study the influence of the sulfur supply on the floral scent of crops
   with (white mustard, oil radish) and without sulfur-containing secondary
   compounds (chamomile, field beans, and peas) was determined. The plant
   sulfur status was monitored at the start of main growth and the volatile
   emissions of flowers were characterized three times during main
   flowering by employing an electronic nose. Sulfur fertilization
   increased the sulfur content in leaves and flowers of all crops.
   Significant differences in the emission of volatiles in relation to
   sulfur fertilization were determined at least at one sampling date for
   all investigated crops except white mustard. It was possible to
   distinguish floral scent patterns of beans from peas and chamomile, and
   that of peas from chamomile and white mustard. Moreover it was possible
   to discriminate the floral scent of the two glucosinolate-containing
   crops white mustard and oil radish, too.}},

Volume = {{162}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity may enhance and stabilise ecosystem functioning, but little
   evidence exists for diversity-function relationships involving
   multitrophic interactions in real landscapes. In multitrophic
   communities diversity may vary at different trophic levels, with either
   synergistic or antagonistic effects on ecosystem functioning.
   Intensification of land-use systems is often found to reduce diversity,
   which in turn may lead to reduced associated ecological functions in
   natural food webs, such as host-parasite interactions. In this study we
   investigated the relationship between the number of natural enemy and
   host species and the mean rate and temporal variability of parasitism
   (inverse of stability), along an intensification gradient of coffee
   agroforests in Ecuador. We used standardised trap nests for bees and
   wasps and their natural enemies in 14 agroforests, and evaluated these
   monthly over a period of 17 months. We found that parasitism rates of
   wasps and bees increased with increasing number of enemy species and
   decreased with increasing number of host species. Temporal variability
   in parasitism rates decreased with increasing number of enemy species
   and increased with temporal variability in enemy species richness;
   however, these effects were restricted to wasp hosts. Intensification of
   agroforests did not significantly affect species richness of hosts or
   enemies or their relation to parasitism and its temporal variability. We
   conclude that high enemy diversity may enhance parasitism rates and that
   high host diversity may provide resistance against consumption.
   Furthermore, we show that a diverse and stable enemy community may also
   have a stabilizing effect on parasitism rates. However, these effects
   may be host-guild specific, as these relations were restricted to wasps.}},

Abstract = {{The irapua Trigona spinipes is considered a pest insect of several crops
   because it feeds on their leaves, flowers and fruits. The aim of this
   study was to characterize the damage caused by irapua on blueberry
   flowers (Vaccinium ashei) over the fruit set and fruit quality. The
   experiment was conducted in a blueberry collection of Embrapa Clima
   Temperado, in Pelotas, RS. Two hundred flowers were observed, being one
   hundred of them with irapua damage and the other 100 flowers without
   damage. The fruit set was recorded as well as the level of soluble
   solids (TSS), the fruit diameter and number of seeds at the time of
   harvesting. A completely randomized design was used. Flowers without
   irapua damage showed a higher percentage of fruit set and the produced
   fruit had a greater diameter and larger quantities of seeds. The TSS
   content on the fruits from flowers with or without irapua damage was
   similar. These results suggest that T spinipes is harmful to the
   blueberry culture, mainly at time of flowering, because the inset damage
   causes low fruit set and the production of small fruits with less seeds.}},

Abstract = {{It is now widely accepted that agricultural intensification drives the
   decline of biodiversity and related ecosystem services like pollination.
   Conservation management, such as agri-environment schemes (AES), has
   been introduced to Counteract these declines, but in Western European
   countries these tend to produce mixed biodiversity benefits. Not much is
   known about the effects of AES in Central and Eastern European
   Countries. We evaluated the effect of reduced stocking rates (0.5 cow/ha
   vs. >1 cow/ha) on bees and insect-pollinated plants in semi-natural
   pastures in Hungary. We sampled bees using sweep net and transect
   surveys in the edge and interior of the fields three times in 2003. On
   the same transects, we also estimated the cover of all plant species. We
   found no management effect on species richness and abundance with
   respect to cover of bees and insect-pollinated plants, but grazing
   intensity resulted in differences in species composition of
   insect-pollinated plants. Furthermore, we compared our results with
   those of a similar study carried out in Switzerland, and the
   Netherlands, but with different management regimes. There were positive
   effects of management in Switzerland, but conservation effects were
   lacking in the Netherlands. Species richness of both bees and
   insect-pollinated plants was highest in Hungary, intermediate in
   Switzerland and lowest in the Netherlands. Across all countries, the
   richness of insect-pollinated plants was a good predictor of bee species
   richness. Grassland extensification schemes were effective for bees and
   insect-pollinated plants in the country with intermediate land-Use,
   intensity and biodiversity only (Switzerland). The absence of effects in
   the Netherlands may have been caused by the management being highly
   intensive on both field types. In Hungarian grasslands biodiversity
   levels were high regardless of management and both investigated stocking
   rates may be qualified as conservation management. Therefore,
   agricultural policy in Hungary should encourage the maintenance of a
   variety of traditional grazing practices for conserving this still
   highly diverse pollinator fauna. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The interactions between bees that depend on floral oil for their larvae
   and flowers that offer oil involve an intricate mix of obligate and
   facultative mutualisms. Using recent phylogenies, new data on
   oil-offering Cucurbitaceae, and molecular-dating, we ask when and how
   often oil-offering flowers and oil-foraging bees evolved, and how
   frequently these traits were lost in the cause of evolution. Local
   phylogenies and an angiosperm-wide tree show that oil flowers evolved at
   least 28 times and that floral oil was lost at least 36-40 times. The
   oldest oil flower systems evolved shortly after the K/T boundary
   independently in American Malpighiaceae, tropical African Cucurbitaceae
   and Laurasian Lysimachia (Myrsinaceae); the ages of the South African
   oil flower/oil bee systems are less clear. Youngest oil flower clades
   include Calceolaria (Calceolariaceae), Iridaceae, Krameria
   (Krameriaceae) and numerous Orchidaceae, many just a few million years
   old. In bees, oil foraging evolved minimally seven times and dates back
   to at least 56 Ma (Ctenoplectra) and 53 Ma (Macropis). The co-occurrence
   of older and younger oil-offering clades in three of the four
   geographical regions (but not the Holarctic) implies that oil-foraging
   bees acquired additional oil hosts over evolutionary time. Such
   niche-broadening probably started with exploratory visits to flowers
   resembling oil hosts in scent or colour, as suggested by several cases
   of Muellerian or Batesian mimicry involving oil flowers. Keywords:}},

Abstract = {{Members of the euasterid angiosperm family Solanaceae have been
   characterized as remarkably diverse in terms of flower morphology and
   pollinator type. In order to test the relative contribution of phylogeny
   to the pattern of distribution of floral characters related to
   pollination, flower form and pollinators have been mapped onto a
   molecular phylogeny of the family. Bilateral flower symmetry
   (zygomorphy) is prevalent in the basal grades of the family, and more
   derived clades have flowers that are largely radially symmetric, with
   some parallel evolution of floral bilateralism. Pollinator types
   ('syndromes') are extremely homoplastic in the family, but members of
   subfamily Solanoideae are exceptional in being largely bee pollinated.
   Pollinator relationships in those genera where they have been
   investigated more fully are not as specific as flower morphology and the
   classical pollinator syndrome models might suggest, and more detailed
   studies in some particularly variable genera, such as Iochroma and
   Nicotiana, are key to understanding the role of pollinators in floral
   evolution and adaptive radiation in the family. More studies of
   pollinators in the field are a priority.}},

Abstract = {{The Southwest Australian Biodiversity Hotspot contains an exceptionally
   diverse flora on an ancient, low-relief but edaphically diverse
   landscape. Since European colonization, the primary threat to the flora
   has been habitat clearance, though climate change is an impending
   threat. Here, we review (i) the ecology of nectarivores and biotic
   pollination systems in the region, (ii) the evidence that trends in
   pollination strategies are a consequence of characteristics of the
   landscape, and (iii) based on these discussions, provide predictions to
   be tested on the impacts of environmental change on pollination systems.
   The flora of southwestern Australia has an exceptionally high level of
   vertebrate pollination, providing the advantage of highly mobile,
   generalist pollinators. Nectarivorous invertebrates are primarily
   generalist foragers, though an increasing number of colletid bees are
   being recognized as being specialized at the level of plant family or
   more rarely genus. While generalist pollination strategies dominate
   among insect-pollinated plants, there are some cases of extreme
   specialization, most notably the multiple evolutions of sexual deception
   in the Orchidaceae. Preliminary data suggest that bird pollination
   confers an advantage of greater pollen movement and may represent a
   mechanism for minimizing inbreeding in naturally fragmented populations.
   The effects of future environmental change are predicted to result from
   a combination of the resilience of pollination guilds and changes in
   their foraging and dispersal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen limitation (PL) of seed production creates unique conditions for
   reproductive adaptation by angiosperms, in part because, unlike under
   ovule or resource limitation, floral interactions with pollen vectors
   can contribute to variation in female success. Although the ecological
   and conservation consequences of PL have received considerable attention
   in recent times, its evolutionary implications are poorly appreciated.
   To identify general influences of PL on reproductive adaptation compared
   with those under other seed-production limits and their implications for
   evolution in altered environments, we derive a model that incorporates
   pollination and post-pollination aspects of PL. Because PL always
   favours increased ovule fertilization, even when population dynamics are
   not seed limited, it should pervasively influence selection on
   reproductive traits. Significantly, under PL the intensity of inbreeding
   does not determine whether outcrossing or autonomous selfing can evolve,
   although it can affect which response is most likely. Because the causes
   of PL are multifaceted in both natural and anthropogenically altered
   environments, the possible outcrossing solutions are diverse and context
   dependent, which may contribute to the extensive variety of angiosperm
   reproductive characteristics. Finally, the increased adaptive options
   available under PL may be responsible for positive global associations
   between it and angiosperm diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The unique floral morphology of the South African orchid H. pulchra,
   with its twin meranthia, is best explained as an adaptation to
   pollination by oil-collecting bees. Flowers consisting of meranthia
   (floral parts that function as single pollination units; commonly
   observed in garden Iris) are extremely rare among the angiosperms and
   their significance poorly understood. Unlike all other known examples of
   meranthia, the novel type described for H. pulchra is not bilabiate. All
   Huttonaea species are unique in having twin petal sacs with glandular
   verrucae that secrete oil and are pollinated by Rediviva (Melittidae)
   oil-collecting bees. But only Huttonaea pulchra has long and widely
   divergent petal claws that place the oil sacs well beyond the reach of a
   centrally positioned bee. The wide separation of these sacs forces the
   pollinator, R. colorata, to visit each side of the flower independently
   and effectively divides the flower into two meranthia. Molecular data
   indicate that the evolution of the Huttonaea-type meranthium was
   dependent on the prior evolution of the oil flower/oil bee relationship.
   Meranthium evolution was also facilitated by the presence of oil in two
   separate structures (petal sacs) that were not physically constrained to
   remain in close proximity.}},

Abstract = {{The European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, was introduced into Japan
   from Europe in 1991 for pollination of tomato plants. Many ecologists
   had warned of biological invasion by this species, and in 1996 a
   naturalized colony was found in Hokkaido, indicating that the species
   had become naturalized. The Ministry of the Environment effected a new
   law, the Invasive Alien Species Act, in 2005 to protect Japanese native
   fauna and flora from invasive alien species. Heated arguments arose
   between conservation ecologists and agriculturalists about whether the
   law should regulate B. terrestris. To reach a scientific decision, we
   began a study to reveal the ecological impacts of B. terrestris and to
   develop methods to control its naturalization. On the basis of our
   results, the Ministry of the Environment classified B. terrestris as
   invasive and requiring regulation by law, but its use would be permitted
   on the condition that it be used only for agriculture and that measures
   to prevent escape be taken. This legal control of B. terrestris in Japan
   is a revolutionary trial that aims to achieve a state of mutualism
   between biodiversity and agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{The earliest deliberate introductions of bumblebees to areas outside of
   their native range occurred over 100 years ago. Transportation of
   bumblebees accelerated in the late 1980s following the development of
   techniques for mass rearing them, and their widespread adoption as the
   preferred pollinator for a range of glasshouse crops, primarily
   tomatoes. There is now a worldwide trade in one species, Bombus
   terrestris dalmatinus, originating from south east Europe. Within North
   America, which does not allow the importation of B. terrestris, the
   trade is primarily in Bombus impatiens. Trade in B. t. dalmatinus
   threatens the integrity of other subspecies within Europe, such as B. t.
   audax which is endemic to Britain and Ireland. However, there is a
   conspicuous absence of data as to whether B. t. dalmatinus has
   established in the wild outside its native range, and whether it
   interbreeds with native subspecies. Perhaps a more significant risk
   associated with trade in bumblebees is the accidental spread of
   parasites, and the subsequent risk that native bumblebee species may be
   exposed to parasites for which they have little resistance. There is
   circumstantial evidence that catastrophic declines of several North
   American bumblebee species may have been triggered by the accidental
   introduction of pathogens from Europe. Even if commercial bumblebee
   colonies are reared locally, the high densities at which they are kept
   mean that glasshouse nests are likely to act as reservoirs for spread of
   disease to wild bumblebee populations nearby. There is clearly the need
   for tight quarantining of bee colonies before transportation, and a
   moratorium should be placed on the transport of bumblebees in cases
   where native species suitable for commercial rearing are readily
   available.}},

Abstract = {{An exotic species can appear in a community unexpectedly. It may

   to mitigate the impact of the newly arrived exotic species on the native
   community. Here, I develop a collection of theoretical models that are
   intended to provide insight into the effects of newly arrived exotic
   pollinators on pollination systems. The models address the effects of
   the presence of an exotic pollinator on plant reproduction, including
   the both the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited and the level of
   outcrossing, and on numerical responses by native pollinator species,
   including switching of flower preferences by economically motivated
   flower visitors. The models are simplistic, but the majority have the
   virtue that their solution is feasible by using data that is easy to
   collect. The models provide first approximations that could be useful to
   ecologists and conservationists when they must guess the potential
   impacts of exotic pollinators. The results from the models should be
   interpreted under appropriate caveats by those who must make do with

Abstract = {{A Japanese native bumblebee, Bombus ignitus, has recently been
   commercialized for crop pollination. To assess the risk of genetic
   disturbance of local bumblebee communities, despite the fact that B.
   ignitis is native, we analyzed a 1048-bp sequence of the cytochrome
   oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) region of mitochondrial DNA in B. ignitus
   specimens that were collected from various localities in Japan, China,
   and Korea. We detected 15 haplotypes, none of which were shared between
   Japanese and continental populations. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed
   that the Japanese populations constituted a distinct clade that is
   genetically divergent from the continental populations. The detection of
   a geographic pattern in the CO1 haplotype distribution within Japan
   suggests genetic differentiation among Japanese populations. These
   results indicate that the genetic endemism of B. ignitus should be taken
   into consideration before commercial colonies of this native bumblebee
   are distributed.}},

Abstract = {{Bombus terrestris L. (Apidae) is a native of temperate Eurasia and has
   been moved around the world since the 1800s. Dispersal of B. terrestris
   gained momentum in the 1980s when bees were reared artificially in
   Europe and supplied commercially for greenhouse pollination services.
   Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that
   this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may
   disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris
   are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability
   under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or
   polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of
   flowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory
   metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural
   enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range,
   and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a
   newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes
   and are better competitors than the local conspecific populations and
   may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented
   evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems
   includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for
   nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread
   of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant
   reproductive capacity. We discuss the possible measures that must be
   taken to minimize the B. terrestris invasion on local as well as on
   global levels.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), is used to
   pollinate alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., for seed production in the United
   States and Canada. It is difficult to reliably sustain commercial M.
   rotundata populations in the United States because of problems with
   disease, parasites, predators, and unexplained mortality. One possible
   explanation for early immature mortality is that, relative to floral
   availability, superfluous numbers of bees are released in alfalfa fields
   where resources quickly become limited. Our objective was to determine
   how M. rotundata density affects bee nesting, pollination efficiency,
   and reproductive success. Various numbers of bees were released into
   enclosures on an alfalfa field, but only 10-90\% of released female bees
   established nests. Therefore, a ``bee density index{''} was derived for
   each enclosure from the number of established females and number of open
   flowers over time. As the density index increased, significant
   reductions occurred in the number of pollinated flowers, number of
   nests, and number of cells produced per bee, as well as the percentage
   of cells that produced viable prepupae by summer's end and the
   percentage that produced adult bees. The percentage of cells resulting
   in early brood mortality (i.e., pollen balls) significantly increased as
   the density index increased. We conclude that bee nest establishment,
   pollination efficiency, and reproductive success are compromised when
   bee densities are high relative to floral resource availability. Open
   field studies are needed to determine commercial bee densities that
   result in sustainable bee populations and adequate pollination for
   profitable alfalfa seed production.}},

Abstract = {{Bowl and pan traps are now commonly used to capture bees (Hymenoptera:
   Apiformes) for research and surveys.
   Studies of how arrangement and spacing of bowl traps affect captures of
   bees are needed to increase the efficiency of this capture technique.
   We present results from seven studies of bowl traps placed in trapping
   webs, grids, and transects in four North American ecoregions
   (Mid-Atlantic, Coastal California, Chihuahuan Desert, and Columbia
   Plateau).
   Over 6000 specimens from 31 bee genera were captured and analysed across
   the studies.
   Based on the results from trapping webs and distance tests, the per bowl
   capture rate of bees does not plateau until bowls are spaced 3-5 m
   apart.
   Minor clumping of bee captures within transects was detected, with 26 of
   56 transects having index of dispersion values that conform to a clumped
   distribution and 39 transects having positive Green's index values, 13
   with zero, and only four negative. However, degree of clumping was
   slight with an average value of only 0.06 (the index ranges from -1 to
   1) with only five values > 0.15. Similarly, runs tests were significant
   for only 5.9\% of the transects.
   Results indicate that (i) capture rates are unaffected by short
   distances between bowls within transects and (ii) that bowls and
   transects should be dispersed throughout a study site.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of four pesticides
   (Mosplian, Kingbo, Score and Lvrtong) applied commonly in greenhouses in
   China, on three bumblebee species (Bombus hypocrita, Bombus ignitus and
   Bombus patagiatus). The study used a contact experiment and oral
   toxicity LD50 values. The results showed that the mortality for B.
   hypocrita after contacting the four pesticides was significantly lower
   than B. patagiatus and B. ignitus, but there was no significant
   difference between B. patagiatus and B. ignitus. The oral toxicity
   median lethal dose (LD50) value of Mosplian to B. hypocrita (0.0028 mu g
   active ingredient/bee) was significantly higher than that to B. ignitus
   (0.0023 mu g active ingredient/bee) and B. patagiatus (0.0021 mu g
   active ingredient/bee). Of the bee species, it can be concluded that B.
   hypocrita was the least susceptible to the four pesticides. The
   mortality rates of each bumblebee species after contact with Mosplian
   were significantly higher than for the other three pesticides and the
   control group. For Kingbo, the rates were significantly higher than the
   control group, but Score and Lvrtong exposed groups showed no
   significant increase in mortality relative to the control group. It can
   therefore be concluded that the pesticides differ in their negative
   influences on bumblebees, and that Mosplian is the most harmful.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{105-113}},

Abstract = {{Competition for floral resources is a key force shaping pollinator
   communities, particularly among social bees. The ability of social bees
   to recruit nestmates for group foraging is hypothesized to be a major
   factor in their ability to dominate rich resources such as
   mass-flowering trees. We tested the role of group foraging in attaining
   dominance by stingless bees, eusocial tropical pollinators that exhibit
   high diversity in foraging strategies. We provide the first experimental
   evidence that meliponine group foraging strategies, large colony sizes
   and aggressive behavior form a suite of traits that enable colonies to
   improve dominance of rich resources. Using a diverse assemblage of
   Brazilian stingless bee species and an array of artificial ``flowers{''}
   that provided a sucrose reward, we compared species' dominance and
   visitation under unrestricted foraging conditions and with experimental
   removal of group-foraging species. Dominance does not vary with
   individual body size, but rather with foraging group size. Species that
   recruit larger numbers of nestmates (Scaptotrigona aff. depilis, Trigona
   hyalinata, Trigona spinipes) dominated both numerically (high local
   abundance) and behaviorally (controlling feeders). Removal of
   group-foraging species increased feeding opportunities for solitary
   foragers (Frieseomelitta varia, Melipona quadrifasciata and Nannotrigona
   testaceicornis). Trigona hyalinata always dominated under unrestricted
   conditions. When this species was removed, T. spinipes or S. aff.
   depilis controlled feeders and limited visitation by solitary-foraging
   species. Because bee foraging patterns determine plant pollination
   success, understanding the forces that shape these patterns is crucial
   to ensuring pollination of both crops and natural areas in the face of
   current pollinator declines.}},

Title = {{Oilseed rape crops distort plant-pollinator interactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{209-214}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. New incentives at the national and international level frequently
   lead to substantial structural changes in agricultural landscapes.
   Subsidizing energy crops, for example, recently fostered a strong
   increase in the area cultivated with oilseed rape Brassica napus across
   the EU. These changes in landscape structure affect biodiversity and
   associated ecosystem services.
   2. Mass-flowering oilseed rape has been shown to positively affect
   colony growth and densities of bumblebees, which may enhance pollination
   services in agroecosystems. Not considered, however, have been
   species-specific traits of pollinators resulting in disproportionate
   benefits from these recurrent resource pulses. A subsequent community
   shift towards the subsidized species potentially distorts
   plant-pollinator interactions in the surrounding landscape.
   3. We analysed the effects of mass-flowering crops on the abundance of
   legitimate long-tongued bumblebee pollinators, nectar robbing by
   illegitimate short-tongued bumblebees and seed set in the long-tubed
   flowers of red clover Trifolium pratense in 12 landscape sectors with
   differing amounts of oilseed rape.
   4. Densities of long-tongued bumblebees visiting long-tubed plants
   decreased with increasing amounts of oilseed rape. The simultaneous
   increase of nectar robbing suggests that resource depletion is a likely
   explanation for this decline which may lead to a distortion in
   plant-pollinator interactions. The decline in long-tongued bumblebees,
   however, did not result in an immediate effect on seed set. In contrast,
   seed set increased with increasing amounts of semi-natural habitats,
   indicating the positive effects of these habitats on the legitimate
   long-tongued pollinators.
   5.Synthesis and applications. Accounting for species-specific traits is
   essential in evaluating the ecological impacts of land-use change. The
   disproportional trait-specific benefits of increasing oilseed rape to
   short-tongued bumblebees may abet an increasingly pollinator-dependent
   agriculture but simultaneously threaten the more specialized and rare
   long-tongued species and their functions. Semi-natural habitats were
   found to positively affect seed set in long-tubed plants indicating that
   they can counteract the potentially distorting effects of transient
   mass-flowering crops on plant-pollinator interactions in agroecosystems.
   Future agri-environmental schemes should aim to provide diverse and
   continuous resources matching trait-specific requirements of various
   pollinators in order to avoid resource competition. Thereby they
   harmonize the economic interest in abundant pollinators and the
   conservation interest in protecting rare species.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal ability is a key determinant of the propensity of an organism
   to cope with habitat fragmentation and climate change. Here we quantify
   queen dispersal in two common bumblebee species in an arable landscape.
   Dispersal was measured by taking DNA samples from workers in the spring
   and summer, and from queens in the following spring, at 14 sites across
   a landscape. The queens captured in the spring must be full sisters of
   workers that were foraging in the previous year. A range of sibship
   reconstruction methods were compared using simulated data sets including
   or no genotyping errors. The program Colony gave the most accurate
   reconstruction and was used for our analysis of queen dispersal.
   Comparison of queen dispersion with worker foraging distances was used
   to take into account an expected low level of false identification of
   sister pairs which might otherwise lead to overestimates of dispersal.
   Our data show that Bombus pascuorum and B. lapidarius queens can
   disperse by at least 3 and 5 km, respectively. These estimates are
   consistent with inferences drawn from studies of population structuring
   in common and rare bumblebee species, and suggest that regular gene flow
   over several kilometres due to queen dispersal are likely to be
   sufficient to maintain genetic cohesion of ubiquitous species over large
   spatial scales whereas rare bumblebee species appear unable to regularly
   disperse over distances greater than 10 km. Our results have clear
   implications for conservation strategies for this important pollinator
   group, particularly when attempting to conserve fragmented populations.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebee detection of a flat circular disc (two-dimensional (2D)
   presentation) and a disc which was presented 10 cm in front of a
   structured background (and thus provided three-dimensional (3D) cues)
   was compared. A dual choice test using a Y-maze apparatus was conducted
   to estimate the minimum visual angle at which the bees were able to
   detect the disc. At large visual angles of 15, 10 and 5A degrees bees'
   performance between the 2D and the 3D presentation did not differ.
   However, when the disc subtended 3A degrees at the bee's eye, the bees
   performed significantly better when 3D information was available.
   Overall, bees were able to detect a target subtending a 40\% smaller
   visual angle when it was presented in front of the structured background
   compared to a 2D presentation. This suggests that previous reports on
   the limits of target detection in bees using flat stimuli might have
   underestimated the bees' ability to locate small flowers under natural
   conditions. Bees use motion parallax, i.e. the apparent relative motion
   of a stationary object against a background, for perceiving the third
   dimension. Our data suggest that bumblebees can integrate information
   from at least two types of feature detectors, motion and area, to
   improve single target detection.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Bumble bees {[}Bombus impatiens (Cresson)] are widely used
   for supplemental pollination of greenhouse vegetables and are at risk of
   pesticide exposure while foraging. The objective of this study was to
   determine the lethal and sub-lethal effects of four insecticides
   (imidacloprid, abamectin, metaflumizone and chlorantraniliprole) and
   three fungicides (myclobutanil, potassium bicarbonate and cyprodinil +
   fludioxonil) used or with potential for use in Ontario greenhouse
   vegetable production to B. impatiens.
   RESULTS: Imidacloprid, abamectin, and metaflumizone were harmful to
   worker bees following direct contact, while chlorantraniliprole and all
   fungicides tested were harmless. Worker bees fed
   imidacloprid-contaminated pollen had shortened life spans and were
   unable to produce brood. Worker bees consumed less pollen contaminated
   with abamectin. Metaflumizone, chlorantraniliprole and all fungicides
   tested caused no sub-lethal effects in bumble bee micro-colonies.
   CONCLUSION: We conclude that the new reduced risk insecticides
   metaflumizone and chlorantraniliprole and the fungicides myclobutanil,
   potassium bicarbonate and cyprodinil + fludioxonil are safe for
   greenhouse use in the presence of bumble bees. This information can be
   used preserve greenhouse pollination programs while maintaining
   acceptable pest management. (C) 2009 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Identifying effective management operations for plantations is important
   for conservation of biodiversity in a plantation-dominated landscape. We
   tested whether pre-commercial thinning influenced community structures
   and could be an effective strategy for increasing diversity and
   abundance of plants and animals in plantations. We designated thinned
   and unthinned study stands in Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica)
   plantations and compared the communities of understory vegetation, bees,
   butterflies, hoverflies, and longhorn beetles 1 and 3 years after
   thinning. The analyses of vegetation showed that pre-commercial thinning
   affected community structure, but species richness and vegetation
   abundance were not significantly affected. Thinning affected insect
   community structure, and both species richness and abundance of all
   insect groups increased 1 year after thinning. However, 3 years after
   thinning, significant differences only remained in the species richness
   of bees and the abundance of bees, butterflies, and hoverflies. These
   results suggest that pre-commercial thinning in plantation stands
   influences the community structure of understory vegetation and can be
   an effective way to increase the diversity and abundance of some insect
   groups in the short term. However, the results also suggest that the
   duration of the operational effects of pre-commercial thinning varies
   among insect groups; thus, the variable effects of pre-commercial
   thinning should be carefully considered in the conservation-based
   management of plantation stands. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: In the emerging field of community and ecosystem genetics,
   genetic variation and diversity in dominant plant species have been
   shown to play fundamental roles in maintaining biodiversity and
   ecosystem function. However, the importance of intraspecific genetic
   variation and diversity to floral abundance and pollinator visitation
   has received little attention.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Using an experimental common garden that
   manipulated genotypic diversity (the number of distinct genotypes per
   plot) of Solidago altissima, we document that genotypic diversity of a
   dominant plant can indirectly influence flower visitor abundance. Across
   two years, we found that 1) plant genotype explained 45\% and 92\% of
   the variation in flower visitor abundance in 2007 and 2008,
   respectively; and 2) plant genotypic diversity had a positive and
   non-additive effect on floral abundance and the abundance of flower
   visitors, as plots established with multiple genotypes produced 25\%
   more flowers and received 45\% more flower visits than would be expected
   under an additive model.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results provide evidence that declines
   in genotypic diversity may be an important but little considered factor
   for understanding plant-pollinator dynamics, with implications for the
   global decline in pollinators due to reduced plant diversity in both
   agricultural and natural ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the habitat of many species is fragmented, resulting in small
   local populations with individuals occasionally dispersing between the
   remaining habitat patches. In a solitary bee metapopulation, extinction
   probability was related to both local bee population sizes and pollen
   resources measured as host plant population size. Patch size, on the
   other hand, had no additional predictive power. The turnover rate of
   local bee populations in 63 habitat patches over 4 years was high, with
   72 extinction events and 31 colonization events, but the pollen plant
   population was stable with no extinctions or colonizations. Both pollen
   resources and bee populations had strong and independent effects on
   extinction probability, but connectivity was not of importance.
   Colonizations occurred more frequently within larger host plant
   populations. For metapopulation survival of the bee, large pollen plant
   populations are essential, independent of current bee population size.}},

Abstract = {{(Reproductive biology of Passiflora capsularis L. e P pohlii Mast.
   (Decolaba, Passifloracae)) The subgenus Decaloba (Passifloraceae) is
   poorly studied on reproductive aspects, which may help our understanding
   on phylogenetic relationships in the genus. The purpose of this work was
   to study the reproductive biology and pollination of Passiflora pohlii
   and P capsularis, two species belonging to this subgenus with occurrence
   in Minas Gerais state. Stigma receptivity, pollen viability and nectar
   concentration were determined. Controlled pollination experiments were
   done to assess the breeding system. Floral visitors-and pollen load were
   observed. In both species, the flowers start to open during the night. P
   pohlii anthesis begins about 3:00 a.m. and its senescence about 11:00
   a.m.; the flowers of P capyularis opened about 3:00 a.m. and closed
   about 2:00 p.m. The concentration of the nectar and viability of the
   pollen had been, respectively, 34.88 +/- 7.66\% and 80 +/- 0.15\% in P
   pohlii and 22.33 +/- 5.82\% and 92 +/- 0.06\% in P capsularis.
   Passiflora pohlii was xenogamous and self-incompatible and P capsularis
   autogamous and self-compatible. Passiflora pohlii had as pollinators
   three species of Ptiloglossa (Colletidae) and in P capsularis all
   observed visitors were considered nectar and pollen thieves. The
   nocturnal anthesis showed by studied species of Passiflora suggests an
   evolutionary relationship among Passiflora subg. Decaloba and
   hymenoptera, especially Ptiloglossa bees.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers are expected to be under strong selection pressure to be
   attractive to pollinators. Yet, floral traits that serve in pollinator
   attraction may inadvertently attract animals that consume flowers. We
   expected animals to Utilize floral Cues in targeting plants to attack so
   for three field seasons we examined florivory in four sympatric Ipomoea
   species that differed in their pollination syndrome (flower color and
   shape) as well as their geographic origin (native vs. introduced). Most
   of the damage to Ipomoea flowers was caused by larval Spodoptera spp.
   that consumed all or parts of the corolla, pistil and stamens. There was
   no overall difference in damage levels to flowers of the bee or
   hummingbird-pollinated plants. However, florivores exhibited a strong
   preference for the native, bumble bee-pollinated L cordatotriloba
   relative to the remaining three non-native Ipomoea species. The
   non-native, hummingbird-pollinated I. hederifolia and I. quamoclit
   consistently experienced the lowest florivory rates. There were
   reproductive consequences to florivory as damaged flowers had reduced
   fruit set. Seed set was not influenced by corolla damage, but was
   reduced when flowers suffered damage to reproductive organs. The results
   of our study suggest that flower-eating insects are not focusing in on
   traits associated with different pollination syndromes, but are
   preferentially visiting the native Ipomoea species, and this may
   contribute to the Successful invasion of introduced Ipomoea plants that
   suffer reduced damage levels.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory and inflorescence size can influence floral visitors. Damaged
   inflorescences have been shown to have fewer floral visitors Clue to
   changes in floral appearance/chemistry, whereas larger inflorescences
   attract more pollinators because of greater pollen/nectar reward. This
   study examined whether floral herbivory by a moth, Coleotechnites
   eryngiella Bottimer (Gelechiidae), and inflorescence size have any
   effect on the attractiveness of Eryngium yuccifolium Michaux (Apiaceae)
   to floral visitors. In particular, the study seeks to determine how
   combined effects of inflorescence size and herbivory affect overall and
   main composition of floral visitors groups. Twelve plants, six with one
   inflorescence stalk (three with and three without herbivory) and six
   with three inflorescence stalks (three with and three without herbivory)
   were observed for floral visitors in 2004 and 2007 at four remnant
   tallgrass prairies located in cast-central Illinois, USA. Damaged
   inflorescences had lower flower visitation than undamaged
   inflorescences. Larger floral displays attracted more floral visitors.
   Differences between the numbers of flies, bees and beetles Visiting the
   flowers were not independent of herbivory and inflorescence size. This
   study provides additional evidence that herbivory and inflorescence size
   can influence insect visitation. In addition, this study provides
   further support to recent publications regarding the more sophisticated
   nature of the pollinator guild associated with members of Apiaceae.
   Finally, it also provides the foundation for future studies to determine
   how differences in the Composition of floral visitors are associated
   With the male and female inflorescence phases of E. yuccifolium and
   their relation to male and female fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate causes of evolution of highly specialized pollination
   systems are little understood. We investigated the relationship between
   specialization and pollination efficiency, defined as the proportion of
   pollinated flowers relative to those that experienced pollen removal,
   using orchids with different pollination strategies as a model system.
   Rewarding orchids showed the highest pollination efficiency. Sexually
   deceptive orchids had comparably high pollination efficiency, but
   food-deceptive orchids had significantly lower efficiency. Values for
   pollinator sharing (a measure of the degree of generalization in
   pollination systems) showed the reverse pattern, in that groups with
   high pollination efficiency had low values of pollinator sharing. Low
   pollinator sharing may thus be the basis for efficient pollination.
   Population genetic data indicated that both food-and sexually deceptive
   species have higher degrees of among-population gene flow than do
   rewarding orchids. Thus, the shift from food to sexual deception may be
   driven by selection for more efficient pollination, without compromising
   the high levels of gene flow that are characteristic of deceptive
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The natural diversity of Bombus terrestris subspecies could be under
   threat from the commercialisation of bumblebees. Therefore, to determine
   whether commercially imported bumblebees are able to establish and
   spread, we carried out long-term observations of bumblebees in southern
   France. Our surveys occurred before, during, and after the importation
   (between 1989 and 1996) of thousands of colonies of the Sardinian
   subspecies B. t. sassaricus. Queens and males of B. t. sassaricus were
   observed foraging outside commercial greenhouses in 1991, 1993, and 1994
   and feral workers were observed foraging on native vegetation nearly two
   years after the importation of B. t. sassaricus ceased. However, no B.
   t. sassaricus, or F1 hybrids were observed after 1998. We conclude that
   B. t. sassaricus remains inconspicuous in France and competition from

Title = {{Ants as dominant insect visitors of the extrafloral nectaries of sponge
   gourd plant, Luffa cylindrica (L.) (Cucurbitaceae)}},
Journal = {{ASIAN MYRMECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},
Pages = {{45-54}},
Abstract = {{The button-shaped extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) located on the bracts,
   bracteoles, calyces and leaves of cultivated sponge gourd plant, Luffa
   cylindrica, were visited by insects belonging to five different orders:
   Hemiptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Lepidoptera. Insects
   with biological-control potential recorded at the EFNs included ants,
   wasps and ladybird beetles. Ants, comprising ten species, constituted by
   far the most abundant group (84.44 +/- 4.34 \% of individuals) at the
   EFNs. Insect pollinators included honey bees, butterflies and wasps,
   which, while visiting the floral nectaries (FNs), also visited the EFNs.
   Ants were found in large numbers on EFN-bearing plant parts,
   particularly leaves and calyces. Aggressive and abundant ant species
   visiting the plants included Camponotus compressus, C. paria and
   Pheidole sp. The major insect herbivore was the red pumpkin beetle,
   Raphidopalpa foveicollis Lucas, which fed predominantly on the corolla
   of the plants and, to a lesser extent, on each of the EFN-bearing
   vegetative parts. The low abundance of herbivores on vegetative parts
   indicates that the ants and, to a lesser extent, wasps, bees and
   ladybirds visiting the EFN-bearing plant structures may be aiding in
   crop plant protection from the herbivores. Thus, though the EFNs of
   sponge gourd plants attract predators, pollinators and also extrafloral
   nectar thieves such as flies, ants are the major group involved in the
   facultative association with the annual crop plant. Such studies may aid
   an environmentally-friendly management approach involving the natural
   enemies of insect pests of EFN-bearing annual crop plants.}},

   Incompatibility and pollen transfer in relation to the breeding system}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{384-391}},
Abstract = {{The onset of stigma receptivity in Melaleuca alternifolia (Maiden \&
   Betche) Cheel was evaluated by observing pollen-tube growth and seed set
   following controlled pollination. Pollen-tube numbers in the style,
   following controlled pollinations, increased from Day 1 to Day 6, then
   declining rapidly. The stigma was most receptive during Days 3-6, and
   still receptive at low levels as early as shortly after anthesis and as
   late as 10 days after pollination. The present study found that
   individuals of M. alternifolia differed in their degree of expression of
   self-incompatibility. Artificial self-pollination, with emasculation, in
   several families resulted in complete self-incompatibility, with no
   capsule retention. The microscopic observation of pollen-tube
   development revealed a mechanism of self-incompatibility in M.
   alternifolia. A self-incompatibility system operates in the style,
   although a few self-pollen grains are capable of germinating and
   producing pollen tubes. It also appears that late-acting
   self-incompatibility mechanisms discriminate against self-pollen tubes
   when they descend to the ovary. Artificial cross-pollination of selected
   parents produced seed with greater germination capacity and seedlings
   that grew faster than the corresponding open-pollinated seed and
   seedlings from the same parent. Freeze-dried pollen stored at -18
   degrees C maintained viability (22\%) over 1 year of storage. This
   finding will allow greater flexibility in undertaking controlled
   pollinations, because stored pollen can be substituted for fresh pollen
   when insufficient quantities are available from new-season flowers. A
   wide variety of insects was observed visiting the flowers of M.
   alternifolia, and capsule set was high even in bags that excluded flower
   visitors greater than 2 mm. Thrips species seem likely to be important
   pollinators of this species because they are small and were abundant
   inside and outside of exclusion bags, although several other insect
   species such as bees, flies and wasps were also identified as frequent
   floral visitors.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Abstract = {{Indirect effects in interactions occur when a species influences a third
   species by modifying the behaviour of a second one. It has been
   suggested that indirect effects of crab spiders (Thomisidae) on
   pollinator behaviour can cascade down the food web and negatively affect
   plant fitness. However, it is poorly understood how different pollinator
   groups react to crab spiders and thus, when a reduction in plant fitness
   is likely to occur. Using continuous video surveillance, we recorded the
   behaviour of pollinators on two flower species and the pollinators'
   responses to three crab spicier treatments: inflorescences (1) with a
   pinned dried spider, (2) with a spicier model made of paper, and (3)
   without spiders (control). We found that pollinators avoided
   inflorescences with dried spiders only on one plant species (Anthemis
   tinctoria). Pollinators showed no significant avoidance of paper
   spiders. Honeybees and bumblebees did not react to dried spiders, but
   solitary bees and syrphid flies showed a strong avoidance. Finally, we
   found no evidence that inflorescences with dried spiders suffered from a
   decrease in fitness in terms of a reduced seed set. We hypothesise that
   top-down effects of predators on plants via pollinators depend on the
   degree of specialisation of pollinators and their tendency to avoid
   spiders. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{106-115}},
Abstract = {{Pesticides are an important potential cause of biodiversity and
   pollinator decline. Little is known about the impacts of pesticides on
   wild pollinators in the field. Insect pollinators were sampled in an
   agricultural system in Italy with the aim of detecting the impacts of
   pesticide use. The insecticide fenitrothion was over 150 times greater
   in toxicity than other pesticides used in the area, so sampling was set
   up around its application. Species richness of wild bees, bumblebees and
   butterflies were sampled at three spatial scales to assess responses to
   pesticide application: (i) the `field' scale along pesticide drift
   gradients; (ii) the `landscape' scale sampling in different crops within
   the area and (iii) the `regional' scale comparing two river basins with
   contrasting agricultural intensity. At the field scale, the interaction
   between the application regime of the insecticide and the point in the
   season was important for species richness. Wild bee species richness
   appeared to be unaffected by one insecticide application, but declined
   after two and three applications. At the landscape scale, the species
   richness of wild bees declined in vine fields where the insecticide was
   applied, but did not decline in maize or uncultivated fields. At the
   regional scale, lower bumblebee and butterfly species richness was found
   in the more intensively farmed basin with higher pesticide loads. Our
   results suggest that wild bees are an insect pollinator group at
   particular risk from pesticide use. Further investigation is needed on
   how the type, quantity and timing of pesticide application impacts
   pollinators. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic habitat disturbance can have profound effects on multiple
   components of forest biotas including pollinator assemblages. We
   assessed the effect of small-scale disturbance on local richness,
   abundance, diversity and evenness of insect pollinator fauna; and how
   habitat disturbance affected species turnover across the landscape and
   overall diversity along a precipitation gradient in NW Patagonia
   (Argentina). We evaluated the effect of disturbance on overall
   pollinator fauna and then separately for bees (i.e. Apoidea) and non-bee
   pollinators. Locally, disturbed habitats had significantly higher
   pollinator species richness and abundances than undisturbed habitats for
   the whole pollinator assemblage, but not for bees or non-bees
   separately. However, significant differences in species richness between
   habitats vanished after accounting for differences in abundance between
   habitat types. At a local scale Shannon-Weaver diversity and evenness
   did not vary with disturbance. A beta diversity index indicated that,
   across forest types, species turnover was lower between disturbed
   habitats than between undisturbed habitats. In addition, rarefaction
   curves showed that disturbed habitats as a whole accumulated fewer
   species than undisturbed habitats at equivalent sample sizes. We
   concluded that small patches of disturbed habitat have a negligible
   effect on local pollinator diversity; however, habitat disturbance
   reduced beta diversity through a homogenization of the pollinator fauna
   (in particular of bees) across the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The study of plant-pollinator interactions is a major tool for
   conservation biology of fragmented habitats like the Atlantic Rain
   Forest and for the study of evolutionary traits that rule these
   interactions. Information on reproductive biology and floral visitor
   interactions of Sophora tomentosa and Crotalaria vitellina (Fabaceae) is
   presented in this study. Both species are common in the restinga
   formation of the Atlantic Rain Forest in the Nucleo Picinguaba, Parque
   Estadual da Serra do Mar, Ubatuba - Sao Paulo. These species occur in
   the same areas, the flowering period is the same for both and they have
   yellow flowers that offer nectar as the major reward. Both are
   self-compatible, although fruit and seed set depend on the pollinators.
   Xylocopa brasilianorum and Megachile sp.1 were pollinators of S.
   tomentosa, whereas C. vitellina was pollinated by both the
   aforementioned bees and Bombus morio, Centris labrosa and two separate
   species of Megachile. All these bees have long tongues and are able to
   reach nectar at the bottom of the nectar chamber by legitimate visits.
   The inflorescences of S. tomentosa received more visits (0,62
   visits/inflorescence/day) than the inflorescences of C. vitellina (0,37
   visits/inflorescence/day). However, the fruit set of S. tomentosa (33\%)
   is similar to that of C. vitellina (42\%) in natural conditions,
   probably due to different pollinator efficiency. Having shorter tongues,
   Trigona and Augochlora bees have no access to the nectar chamber by
   means of legitimate visits. Hence, the dimensions of the nectar chamber
   of S. tomentosa and C. vitellina act as a selective barrier to
   short-tongued bees, thus guaranteeing more nectar to the long-tongued
   visitors. These legume pollinators are very common in the restinga
   forest, and they act as pollen vectors of other species in this
   ecosystem as well. The preservation of these legume plants is important
   to the diversity of bees and essential to the plant community.}},

Abstract = {{Bees in the Rhone-Alpes Region
   Plants and insects have been strongly connected for several hundreds of
   million years. With the appearance of flowers, pollinators or nectar
   gatherers largely diversified and began to play a major role the
   transport of the pollen. This co-evolution is particularly important
   between bees and flowers, as the nutrition activity of some relies on
   the pollination of the others. The word ``bee{''} applies to Apoidea
   Apiformis, represented by nearly 1000 species in France, among which
   only one species is bred in beehives. The decline of pollinators,
   including bees, is becoming more and more alarming. The majority of our
   wild and cultivated plants depend, for their reproduction, on the
   pollinating activity of insects, bees in particular. Thus, the fauna of
   bees of Rhone-Alpes and France is still widely underestimated, for lack
   of references and of specialists. It is crucial to enhance our
   knowledge, to better understand and apprehend the impact of our actions
   in order to decrease the worrisome loss of biodiversity. This article
   tries to offer briefly some elements to enter the vast bee-world.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate sociality in small carpenter bees (Ceratina Latreille), we
   studied the life history and nesting biology of a common eastern North
   American species, Ceratina (Zadontomerus) calcarata Robertson. Pan-trap
   and nest collections throughout the active season (May to September
   2006) were used to assess seasonal phenology and nesting biology of C
   calcarata in southern Ontario. Adults overwintered in their natal nests.
   Males emerged in early May and occupied preexisting hollows in twigs and
   stems. Females emerged from hibernacula 2 weeks later, founding new
   nests. Nest founding and provisioning occurred throughout the spring;
   females remained with developing brood through the summer. Complete
   nests contained, on average, 6.9 offspring, with egg-to-adult
   development averaging 46 days. Ceratina calcarata is subsocial rather
   than solitary: mothers are long-lived and nest-loyal, and care for
   offspring from egg to adulthood. Subsociality is found in all
   behaviourally classified small carpenter bees, while some species cross
   the boundary into social life, making Ceratina an important genus for
   the study of the transition between solitary and social life.}},

   species occurring in the same area as P fervens Include four
   domesticated species (C ficifolia, C maxima maxima, C moschata and C
   pepo) and one non-domesticated species (Cucurbita maxima andreana) It
   was suggested that C. in andreana was the original pollen source to P
   fervens, and this bee expanded its geographical range due to the
   domestication of Cucurbita The potential geographical areas of these
   species were determined and compared using ecological niche modeling
   that was performed with the computational system openModeller and GARP
   with best subsets algorithm The climatic variables obtained through
   modeling were compared using Cluster Analysis Results show that the
   potential areas of domesticated species practically spread all over
   South America The potential area of P fervens Includes the areas of C m
   andreana but reaches a larger area, where the domesticated species of
   Cucurbita also Occur The Cluster Analysis shows a high climatic
   similarity between P fervens and C. m. andreana Nevertheless. P fervens

Abstract = {{Many alpine plants display a generalist pollination system where almost
   any available flower visitor could act as a legitimate pollinator.
   Co-flowering related plant species displaying a generalized pollination
   system can decrease their fitness due to interspecific mating. In this
   study, we determine the difference in diversity and composition of the
   pollination systems of two co-occurring species endemic to the alpine
   region of the Sierra Nevada (SE Spain), Erysimum nevadense Reut. and
   Erysimum baeticum baeticum (Heywood) Polatschek (Brassicaceae), and
   check for the potential role of floral and plant traits in explaining
   the observed differences. For this, we labeled 30 plants in two
   populations of each plant species located in the same area. We
   determined flower visitor assemblage by sampling all insects approaching
   the flowers and contacting the sexual organs during 60-min surveys. We
   found that the diversity of the pollinator assemblage was similar
   between the two studied wallflower species, both species showing a much
   generalized pollination system. However, the composition of the
   pollinator assemblage was different, since the flowers of E. nevadense
   were visited mostly by beetles and in a lesser extent by hover-flies,
   whereas the flowers of E. baeticum baeticum were visited mostly by ants
   and bees. Interestingly, flower traits varied between species, with E.
   nevadense displaying yellow, smaller and shallower flowers and E.
   baeticum baeticum displaying purple, large and deeper flowers. These
   findings suggest that differences in floral traits can explain the
   observed differences in the composition of the pollinator assemblage
   between both wallflower species. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {{Pollen morphology and pollination ecology of Amorphophallus species from
   North Western Ghats and Konkan region of India}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{326-336}},
Abstract = {{The present paper reports on palynology and pollination ecology of eight
   taxa of Amorphophallus from North Western Ghats (NWGS) and Konkan region
   of India. Out of ten known pollen exine ornamentations of the genus, six
   are represented - psilate, striate, fossulate, verrucate, scabrate and
   the new type `pseudofossulate' of Amorphophallus commutatus var.
   wayanadensis. These diverse pollen exine ornamentations can be utilized
   as an important taxonomic tool to distinguish taxa and also to resolve
   taxonomic problems (A. commutatus complex). The pollen of all eight taxa
   had retained their sculptured surface (exine ornamenatation type) after
   acetolysis. This clearly demonstrates that these taxa do not show
   susceptibility to the conventional acetolysis technique as reported
   earlier. The present study also highlights the importance of pollen
   surface morphology concerning phytogeography of the genus.
   Observation of pollination ecology of the studied Amorphophallus taxa
   reveals that all are mostly visited by beetles (Bostrichidae,
   Cetoniidae, Hybosoridae, Lyctidae, Nitidulidae, Rutelinae, Scarabaeidae,
   Staphylinidae), followed by flies (Drosophilidae. Muscidae), bees
   (Apidae: Trigone), ants (Formicidae, Dolichoderinae) and cockroaches
   (Blaberidae/Panesthiinae). The beetle families Bostrichidae, Lyctidae
   and Rutelinae, ant families Formicidae and Dolichoderinae and the
   cockroach family Blaberidae/Panesthiinae are for the first time reported
   as visitors in the genus Amorphophallus. Most of the taxa display
   features characteristic of cantharophily (beetle pollination) except A.
   commutatus var. commutatus and A. commutatus var. wayanadensis, where
   Trigona bees are the actual pollinators. The beetles (Cetoniidae,
   Nitidulidae, Scarabaeidae) and bees (Apidae: Trigona) are the real
   pollinators for the Amorphophallus species of NWGS and Konkan while rest
   of the insects are mere visitors for alimentary/food resources
   (staminode flowers, stigmatic fluid, pollen, appendix surface, appendix
   exudates) and using the inflorescences as mating and egg laying sites.
   Species belonging to the section Rhaphiophallus (Amorphophallus
   konkanensis and Amorphophallus sylvaticus) are pollinated by Epuraea -
   Haptoncurina sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles only. Generally, the species of
   Amorphophallus in NWGS and Konkan region with short flowering peduncle
   are always pollinated by dung beetles or scarabs while species bearing a
   long flowering peduncle are usually pollinated by Epuraea - Haptoncurina
   sp. (Nitidulidae) beetles and Trigona bees. Based on the comparative
   observations, five different phases of insect trapping in Amorphophallus
   taxa are characterized, focusing on the intricacies of pollination
   strategies of various pollinators. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{The ability of degraded areas to recover secondary vegetation and the
   degree of integrity of plant-animal interactions of the resulting
   vegetation is getting increasingly important for biodiversity and
   landscape conservation We studied the seed dispersal and pollination
   modes of woody species of two 12-year-old secondary forest patches,
   beforehand used for sugarcane cultivation Sixty plots were installed
   with a total area of 0.6 ha A total of 61 woody species were
   encountered. Although the study sites were isolated from old-growth
   forests by the matrix of sugarcane, the array of dispersal modes was the
   same as in old-growth forest fragments and the percentage of
   animal-dispersed species was similar (89.8\%) The percentage of
   large-seeded species was even larger than expected (18\%), despite the
   local extinction of large-bodied mammals and birds. Besides the
   dispersal of large seeds mainly by rodents and bats, more than half of
   the large-seeded species are consumed by humans and may have reached the
   study areas this way Most pollination modes found in forest fragments in
   the region were also present in the secondary forests, however, no
   pollination mediated by vertebrates was found among the studied species,
   neither by birds nor by bats, and a high percentage of species showed an
   unspecialized pollination mode (55 7\%) Due to the high abundance of a
   few species pollination by hawkmoths was very common among canopy
   individuals (42 7\%), and many sub-canopy individuals were pollinated by
   large bees (39 8\%) The study exemplifies the resilience of sites
   degraded by intense agriculture, which may still lead to a forest,
   simplified in plant-animal interactions Such secondary forest is likely
   to serve for protection against erosion, and increasing connectivity
   between forest fragments (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved}},

   climatic conditions are restrictive for insect visits. As flowering
   continues and temperatures rise, pollinator activity increases. The two
   plant species share pollinators that visit them indiscriminately. The
   flowers of the two species differ in form and insects visit H. foetidus
   by inserting their heads and H. bocconei ventrally: pollen load on
   insects is highly specialized. With the arrival of spring, many other
   species start to bloom and in spite of the large number of flowers still
   on the plants insects abandon Helleborus species. At the end of spring
   increasing biotic interactions take away pollinators from the Helleborus

   evergreen forests, southern India}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{745-753}},
Abstract = {{Tropical dry evergreen forests (TDEF) are a unique forest type found
   along the east coast of India. They mostly occur as small, isolated
   fragments of varying sizes (0.5 to approximate to 10 ha) and are
   considered as endangered forests types in peninsular India. Although
   plant diversity is well documented in these forests, there is a paucity
   of ecological studies vital for conservation and for planning
   restoration activities. We studied reproductive biology of 13 woody
   species: four trees, six shrubs, and three lianas in fragments of TDEF
   in southern India. The phenology of reproduction, floral biology,
   anthesis and sexual system of each species were recorded. The
   pollination mode was assessed through observations of the visitation
   frequency of pollinators and from the floral characters. The breeding
   system was determined by hand-augmented self- and cross-pollination
   experiments. The plants flowered during the dry season from January to
   July. Plants of nine species had both flowers and fruits at the same
   time. Twelve species were hermaphrodites and one was polygamo-dioecious.
   Flowers of 11 species opened at dawn and two at dusk. Four species were
   self-incompatible and six were self-compatible. Natural fruit set ranged
   from 10\% to 56\%, self-incompatible species having low fruit set.
   Cross-pollen augmentation increased fruit set, suggesting presence of
   outcrossing in all species. The majority of plants species (85\%) had a
   generalized pollination system, receiving visits from diverse insects,
   such as social bees, solitary bees, wasps, moths and flies. However,
   only few of them were functionally important for the species. Two
   species namely: Capparis brevispina and C. zeylanica had butterflies and
   birds, respectively, as their main pollinators. Our data reveal that
   there is a predominance of outcrossing in plant species and a
   generalized pollination system in these forests. We suggest that
   restoration of TDEFs is crucial as habitats, not only for wild plants
   but also for pollinating insects. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

   cyanea (Rubiaceae)}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{205}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{818-824}},
Abstract = {{Currently, pollination is seen as involving more generalist interactions
   than specialized ones. Supporting this trend, some nocturnal distylous
   flowers may also receive floral visitors during the day, and since the
   latter contribute to fruit set, the pollination system is mixed and less
   specialized. Common among the Rubiaceae, distyly has been regarded as a
   reproductive strategy which requires a precise and specialized
   pollination system, and in this important tropical family, environmental
   disturbance and pollination failure have been used to explain anomalies
   in distylous features. Faramea cyanea Mull. Arg. is a common tree
   species in forest formations in the increasingly threatened Cerrado
   biome, the Neotropical savannas in Central Brazil. We evaluated the
   floral morphology, pollination biology and breeding system of a
   population of F. cyanea. Despite their moth pollination features,
   flowers were visited by diurnal (bees) as well as nocturnal (moths)
   pollinators. Experimental results showed that both pollinator groups
   contributed equally to pollen flow and legitimate pollination. The
   population presented distyly, isoplethy and heteromorphic
   self-incompatibility. Although F. cyanea did not present exact
   reciprocal herkogamy between floral morphs, pollination and reproductive
   success were not impaired. Floral features, which allowed pollination by
   complementary groups of pollinators, may explain the absence of
   anomalies in the isoplethy and distylous features in the studied
   population, anomalies which have been observed in other sympatric
   distylous Rubiaceae. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INVERTEBRATE SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{24}},

Pages = {{327-347}},
Abstract = {{Recent molecular phylogenetic data showed the Melittidae as the likely
   sister group to all other bees and indicated that proto-melittids could
   have been host-plant specialists originating in Africa. However, robust
   phylogenetic data at generic and species level are now needed for all
   melittid clades to test these hypotheses and investigate early melittid
   and bee evolution in general. The bee genera Haplomelitta and Samba,
   which comprise the former tribe Sambini (Hymenoptera : Melittidae), are
   revised here. The genera are endemic to the Afrotropical region,
   occurring in eastern and southern Africa. Previous studies hypothesised
   that Samba rendered Haplomelitta paraphyletic but a conclusive taxonomic
   decision was not proposed. By performing a comprehensive phylogenetic
   analysis based on five nuclear genes (28S, CAD, EF-1 alpha (F2 copy),
   long-wavelength rhodopsin (opsin) and RNA polymerase II (RNAp); total
   4179 bp) and morphological characters (34 characters), we here
   synonymise Haplomelitta with Samba. The genus is now subdivided into six
   subgenera containing 10 species, four of which are here described as
   new, namely: S. ascheri, S. gessorum, S. spinosa and S. rubigoinis.
   Moreover, we also considered biogeography, phenology and floral
   visitation data. Samba seems to have originated in southern Africa and
   later colonised eastern Africa. The ancestral host-plant foraging
   strategy was probably specialisation on one plant family (e. g.
   oligolectism). This result supports the hypothesis that the ancestor of
   bees arose in Africa and was a host-plant specialist.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},

Pages = {{170-176}},
Abstract = {{In the outer coastal plain of Georgia, USA, Gelsemium sempervirens
   (Gelsemiaceae) is heavily visited (69-100\% of all flower visits) by
   male and female blueberry bees, Habropoda laboriosa
   (Hymenoptera-Apidae). Fruit set is, however, consistently low (8-36\%
   range). The pollination efficiency of male and female blueberry bees was
   studied using: 1. comparison of pollen loads on foraging male and female
   bees; 2. calculation of pollen loads on fresh stigmas of flowers exposed
   to a single visit by a female bee; and 3. an experimental test of fruit
   and seed set following exposure to one to eight visits by both male and
   female bees. Females had larger pollen loads in four of five body
   regions, but male bees consistently carried pollen in quantities
   sufficient for fertilization. A single visit from a female bee resulted
   in mixed pollen deposition of 76 pollen grains, 20 of which were from
   Gelsemium and 56 from Vaccinium. There was no significant relationship
   of either fruit or seed set with number of visits from either males or
   females. Whilst both male and female bees are effective as pollen
   delivery agents of G. sempervirens, much of the pollen they deliver may
   be from the same floral morph, leading to rejection in this
   self-incompatible distylous species. Low fruit set may also be related
   to other factors such as resource limitation and / or herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Burrowing by semi-fossorial rodents modifies soil properties and plant
   communities. The effects of this burrowing on plants, however, are
   typically evaluated only by assessing changes in photosynthetic or
   production traits, not pollination traits. Therefore little is known
   about the indirect effects of burrowing on pollinators through its
   effects on the emergence of insect-pollinated plants. We recorded the
   relative elevation, grass cover, and flower height of insect-pollinated
   plant species; the number of infiorescences; and the number of
   pollinators in a marmot colony on the Mongolian steppe. We compared
   these parameters on and off marmot mounds and searched for factors that
   might explain variations in pollinator biodiversity at the plot and
   individual-plant levels. Flower numbers and flower visitation frequency
   per plot were significantly higher in the on-mound plots. The number of
   pollinators at the plot level was positively correlated with the
   relative elevation and number of flowers. Species richness of the
   pollinators was negatively correlated with grass cover. These results
   demonstrate that mounds created by marmots attracted pollinators by
   increasing flower numbers and by making flowers more conspicuous by
   raising them above the surrounding vegetation or removing that
   vegetation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the first results of pollinator fauna associated to
   the reproductive biology of Antirrhinum charidemi, Antirrhinum
   graniticum and Antirrhinum braun-blanquetii. Censuses of over 16 hours
   spanning the flowering phenology of each species were drawn up. As
   previously hypothesized, the characteristic occluded (personate) corolla
   of Antirrhinum was exclusively pollinated by bees, but by a higher
   number (four) of bee families than predicted. Seven bee species (Bombus
   hortorum, Anthidium manicatum, Chalicodoma lefebvrei, Anthidium
   sticticum, Anthophora dispar, Xylocopa violacea and Anthidium
   cingulatum) account for over 90\% of flower visits (2098). The flower
   visitation index varied between species (0.0126-0.0320), reaching
   relatively medium values compared to Mediterranean plants. In contrast,
   reproductive success was found to be high when estimated as both fruit
   (45.4-84.2\%) and seed (75.4-98.4\%) sets, suggesting that these bee
   guilds are effective pollinators of the three self-incompatible
   Antirrhinum species. Specialization of the personate flower of
   Antirrhinum is therefore interpreted for bees with both large bodies and
   high visitation indices.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-68}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The issue of mitochondrial heteroplasmy has been cited as a theoretical
   problem for DNA barcoding but is only beginning to be examined in
   natural systems. We sequenced multiple DNA extractions from 20
   individuals of four Hawaiian Hylaeus bee species known to be
   heteroplasmic. All species showed strong differences at polymorphic
   sites between abdominal and muscle tissue in most individuals, and only
   two individuals had no obvious segregation. Two specimens produced
   completely clean sequences from abdominal DNA. The fact that these
   differences are clearly visible by direct sequencing indicates that
   substantial intra-individual mtDNA diversity may be overlooked when DNA
   is taken from small tissue fragments. At the same time, differences in
   haplotype distribution among individuals may result in incorrect
   recognition of cryptic species. Because DNA barcoding studies typically
   use only a small fragment of an organism, they are particularly
   vulnerable to sequencing bias where heteroplasmy and haplotype
   segregation are present. It is important to anticipate this possibility
   prior to undertaking large-scale barcoding projects to reduce the
   likelihood of haplotype segregation confounding the results.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{Typically, floral colour attracts pollinators by advertising rewards
   such as nectar, but how does colour function when pollinators are
   deceived, unrewarded, and may even suffer fitness costs? Sexually
   deceptive orchids are pollinated only by male insects fooled into mating
   with orchid flowers and inadvertently transferring orchid pollinia. Over
   long distances, sexually deceptive orchids lure pollinators with
   counterfeit insect sex pheromones, but close-range deception with colour
   mimicry is a tantalising possibility. Here, for the first time, we
   analyse the colours of four sexually deceptive Cryptostylis orchid
   species and the female wasp they mimic (Lissopimpla excelsa,
   Ichneumonidae), from the perspective of the orchids' single, shared
   pollinator, male Lissopimpla excelsa. Despite appearing different to
   humans, the colours of the orchids and female wasps were effectively
   identical when mapped into a hymenopteran hexagonal colour space. The
   orchids and wasps reflected predominantly red-orange wavelengths, but UV
   was also reflected by raised bumps on two orchid species and by female
   wasp wings. The orchids' bright yellow pollinia contrasted significantly
   with their overall red colour. Orchid deception may therefore involve
   accurate and species-specific mimicry of wavelengths reflected by female
   wasps, and potentially, exploitation of insects' innate attraction to UV
   and yellow wavelengths. In general, mimicry may be facilitated by
   exploiting visual vulnerabilities and evolve more readily at the
   peripheries of sensory perception. Many sexually deceptive orchids are
   predominantly red, green or white: colours that are all potentially
   difficult for hymenoptera to detect or distinguish from the background.}},

   3.9\% of all bees of the family Halictidae (173/4417), nematodes were
   observed in the Dufour's gland, poison sac, oviduct, bursa copulatrix
   and abdominal cavity of dissected female bees and from the genital
   capsule of male bees. Only abdominal glands of 0.6\% (21/3279) of female
   bees from the family Andrenidae were observed with nematodes. Nematodes
   were isolated from the genital capsule of one male bee from the family
   Melittidae. The poison sac was the organ where nematodes were most often
   observed but the highest number of nematodes occurred in the abdominal
   cavity. Most nematodes were in the dauer juvenile stage making
   identification difficult. Sequence analysis using LSU D2/D3 domains and
   a fragment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) allowed for
   putative identification of nematode isolates. Two or three species of
   Bursaphelenchus (B. anatolius, B. debrae, and potentially one or more
   cryptic species closest in morphology to B. anatolius) were isolated
   from six different halictid species (two genera; Halictus and
   Lasioglossum) from different geographical regions in Turkey. An
   additional four species of diplogastrid were recovered from the
   abdominal glands of andrenids; a new species of Koerneria from Andrena
   limata and a separate sister clade to Mononchoides composed of three
   other possible species from four Andrena species. An additional unknown
   species in the order Tylenchida (near Allantonematinae) was recovered
   from three species of Lasioglossum. No molecular data were obtained from
   three mermithid juveniles from two Andrena and one Halictus species
   because samples were lost in transit. The associations of most nematode
   isolates with bees of the families Halictidae and Andrenidae were
   hypothesised to be phoretic, whereas the tylenchid and mermithids were
   parasites.}},

Abstract = {{Ditylenchus halictus n. sp. was collected as dauer juveniles from the
   genital region of adult males and females of the soil-dwelling sweat
   bee, Halictus sexcinctus (Halictidae), in Brandenburg, Germany, and
   cultured on the fungus, Monilinia fructicola. It is the first species of
   Ditylenchus to be reported in an active phoretic association with
   insects and is described and illustrated herein. Dissections revealed
   that 25\% of female bees carried the dauer juveniles of D. halictus n.
   sp. internally in the Dufour's gland and/or seminal receptacle and/or
   genital region (range 1-193 dauer juveniles per bee), and 38\% of males
   were infested in the genital capsule, copulation apparatus, and/or
   distal testes with 1-64 dauer juveniles. Morphologically, D. halictus n.
   sp. has six lines in the lateral field and appears closest to D.
   myceliophagus but can be differentiated based upon a combination of
   morphological characters, the mode of reproduction and molecular
   sequence data. Molecular analysis of the near full length SSU rDNA,
   D2/D3 expansion segments of the large subunit (LSU) rDNA, and internal
   transcribed spacers (ITS-1 and 2) and 5.8S rDNA support that this
   nematode species is unique.}},

Abstract = {{P>Both floral rewards and advertisements can be important in the
   attraction of pollinators, but few studies have separated the individual
   contributions of rewards and advertisements to fitness.
   Here, we investigated selection by pollinators on individual blossoms in
   Dalechampia schottii. This Neotropical vine, endemic to the Yucatan
   Peninsula, rewards bees by secreting fully visible, deep-blue resin from
   a gland subtended by two conspicuous petaloid bracts that may play the
   role of advertisement.
   We used contextual analysis to build a fitness function for four
   morphological traits of individual blossoms: the amount of the reward as
   measured by gland area; the size of the advertisement trait as measured
   by bract length; the flower-pollinator fit as measured by the shortest
   distance between reward and stigma; and the potential for
   self-pollination as measured by the shortest distance between anthers
   and stigma.
   Larger gland area and increased potential for self-pollination directly
   increased the seed production of individual blossoms. However, bract
   size or flower-pollinator fit did not influence the number of seeds
   produced by blossoms. Therefore, in this Dalechampia species,
   pollinators seem to select directly on the reward of individual blossoms
   but not on the advertising bracts.}},

   flowering plants}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{418-425}},
Abstract = {{P>Flowering plants display extraordinary diversity in the morphology of
   male sexual organs, yet the functional significance of this variation is
   not well understood. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of floral
   correlates of heteranthery - the morphological and functional
   differentiation of anthers within flowers - among angiosperm families to
   identify traits associated with this condition.
   We performed a phylogenetic analysis of correlated evolution between
   heteranthery and several floral traits commonly reported from
   heterantherous taxa. In addition, we quantified the effect of
   phylogenetic uncertainty in the observed patterns of correlated
   evolution by comparing trees in which polytomous branches were randomly
   resolved.
   Heteranthery is reported from 12 angiosperm orders and is
   phylogenetically associated with the absence of floral nectaries,
   buzz-pollination and enantiostyly (mirror-image flowers). These
   associations are robust to particularities of the underlying
   phylogenetic hypothesis.
   Heteranthery has probably evolved as a result of pollinator-mediated
   selection and appears to function to reduce the conflict of relying on
   pollen both as food to attract pollinators and as the agent of male
   gamete transfer. The relative scarcity of heteranthery among angiosperm
   families suggests that the conditions permitting its evolution are not
   easily met despite the abundance of pollen-collecting bees and
   nectarless flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental changes in New Zealand over the last 200 years such as the
   intensification of agriculture have nearly eliminated some species of
   native bees from parts of their historic ranges. Consequently, the
   reproductive success of native plants reliant on native bees for
   pollination may be adversely impacted, thereby altering native
   ecosystems. The potential pollination rate of some introduced crops
   might also be reduced. Overwintering prepupae of the ground-nesting
   colletid bee Leioproctus huakiwi Donovan, 2007, were relocated in nests
   in soil and in artificial cells to new nest sites, where they
   established new populations which expanded by about 8-25 times over
   three years (and for the two sites together by 12.75 times), showing
   that large populations can develop rapidly. The two transference methods
   should be applicable to other species of colletids, indicating that
   relocation of these bees to new areas for both conservation and economic
   values is readily achievable.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-89}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Diet has a significant effect on pathogen infections in animals and the
   consumption of secondary metabolites can either enhance or mitigate
   infection intensity. Secondary metabolites, which are commonly
   associated with herbivore defense, are also frequently found in floral
   nectar. One hypothesized function of this so-called toxic nectar is that
   it has antimicrobial properties, which may benefit insect pollinators by
   reducing the intensity of pathogen infections. We tested whether
   gelsemine, a nectar alkaloid of the bee-pollinated plant Gelsemium
   sempervirens, could reduce pathogen loads in bumble bees infected with
   the gut protozoan Crithidia bombi. In our first laboratory experiment,
   artificially infected bees consumed a daily diet of gelsemine
   post-infection to simulate continuous ingestion of alkaloid-rich nectar.
   In the second experiment, bees were inoculated with C. bombi cells that
   were pre-exposed to gelsemine, simulating the direct effects of nectar
   alkaloids on pathogen cells that are transmitted at flowers. Gelsemine
   significantly reduced the fecal intensity of C. bombi 7 days after
   infection when it was consumed continuously by infected bees, whereas
   direct exposure of the pathogen to gelsemine showed a non-significant
   trend toward reduced infection. Lighter pathogen loads may relieve bees
   from the behavioral impairments associated with the infection, thereby
   improving their foraging efficiency. If the collection of nectar
   secondary metabolites by pollinators is done as a means of
   self-medication, pollinators may selectively maintain secondary
   metabolites in the nectar of plants in natural populations.}},

Title = {{Congruence between visitation and pollen-transport networks in a

Pages = {{35-44}},

Abstract = {{Most recent studies describing pollination networks are based on
   observed flower visits, and few have explicitly tested if the floral
   visitors actually carry pollen. Since floral visitors can vary in their
   ability to remove and transfer pollen, it is important to show that
   visitation patterns reflect effective pollination. Given the difficulty
   of measuring per-visit pollen deposition at the community scale, a first
   step is to examine the amount of conspecific pollen carried by insect
   visitors. Here I compared the plant-animal visitation network with the
   pollen-transport network, estimated from insect pollen loads, for a
   montane meadow community from southern California, USA. Visitation and
   pollen-transport networks were positively associated with each other in
   both 2001 and 2002. However, the exclusion of visitors that do not carry
   any conspecific pollen reveals that pollen-transport networks are more
   specialized from the plants' perspective and that species are involved
   in fewer mutualistic interactions compared with estimates derived from
   visitation frequencies. Although conspecific pollen loads were smaller
   in 2002, bees tended to carry the largest conspecific loads in both
   years and were responsible for transporting the most pollen. These
   results suggest that, although visitation networks are suitable
   first-order approximations of pollination networks, information on which
   visitors carry conspecific pollen, and in what amounts, is crucial for
   distinguishing between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions.}},

Journal = {{PACIFIC SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Gossypium tomentosum is a cotton species endemic to the Hawaiian
   Islands. We studied several aspects of its reproductive biology,
   including potential pollinators, floral biology, and diurnal and
   seasonal flowering phenology. Flower visitors were observed in G.
   tomentosum populations on O'ahu, Kaho'o-lawe, and Maui. Primary visitors
   were introduced species, honeybees and carpenter bees, both of which
   were pollinating the flowers. No native bee species were seen visiting
   flowers. In examining floral biology we found that in some cases 10\% of
   flowers had styles that were as short as the anthers or were recurved
   toward the anthers. In the greenhouse, in the absence of pollinators,
   these flowers were the only ones that set fruit. Flowering of G.
   tomentosum commences in January and February, following the rainy
   season, peaks in May, and may continue into August and September. In one
   year, after higher than average precipitation during die rainy season,
   there was a greater abundance of flowering, and flowering persisted
   later into the year. Transgenic varieties of commercial cotton, G.
   hirsutum, are grown in Hawai'i and are interfertile with G. tomentosum.
   Honeybees and carpenter bees are also known pollinators of commercial
   cotton. Because these pollinators are long-distance foragers, we
   estimate that transgenic cotton fields would have to be greater than 10
   kin from a G. to mentosum population to prevent gene flow.}},

Title = {{Reproductive success and pollen dispersal in urban populations of an
   insect-pollinated hay-meadow herb}},
Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-29}},
Abstract = {{Urban development increasingly occupies more landscape and is
   responsible for habitat alteration and fragmentation of so many
   ecosystems that urban environments can no longer be excluded from the
   areas to be considered in conservation strategies. Appropriate
   management measures ensuring population viability are needed, but due to
   the usually irreversible feature of the urbanisation process, the
   measure; may differ from non-urbanised areas. Sufficient gene flow
   levels, leading to successful seed production, appear to be a key
   element in the sustainable persistence of insect-pollinated plant
   remnant populations. This study investigated reproductive success and
   pollen dispersal patterns in Centaurea jacea, an insect-pollinated
   hay-meadow herb, in the Brussels urban area (Belgium). Reproductive
   performance of urban park populations was compared with populations
   occurring in urban semi-natural sites. Pollen dispersal patterns were
   examined within and among-population patches front two urban parks using
   fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Urban park populations showed a
   higher reproductive success than those in urban semi-natural sites.
   Depositions of fluorescent dye particles on recipient individuals were
   found within populations (< 20 m), among populations within parks (over
   a few hundred meters) and among parks (maximal investigated distance:
   2.6 km), indicating pollinator movements and a potential gene flow by
   pollen over relatively long distances. Dye dispersal showed an
   exponential decay distribution with respect to spatial distance. The
   very small populations received more immigrant dye deposition when
   located at short distances from the source population. These findings
   demonstrate that urban populations do not perform worse in reproductive
   success than populations from agricultural landscapes, despite their
   small size, and can function as a network exchanging pollen. The
   conversion of urban park lawns into interconnected networks of
   ecologically managed hay meadows, allowing simultaneous flowering and
   seed production in many patches of target species, is to be strongly
   encouraged. (c) 2009 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier

Pages = {{342-348}},
Abstract = {{A quantitative evaluation of the light emerging from intact petals of
   Rhododendron indicum flowers of different colours was performed.
   Reflectance and fluorescence emission were analyzed in detail. The
   fluorescence quantum yield of petals was determined on entire flowers.
   The obtained values varied from 7.6 x 10(-5) to 6.3 x 10(-4) for the
   emission in the blue region of the electromagnetic spectrum and from 2.4
   x 10(-5) to 1.9 x 10(-4) for the emission in the red one. The
   fluorescence emission that resulted was negligible compared to the light
   reflected by the petals, so it was concluded that in this case only
   reflectance signals should be relevant in biosignal communication with
   pollinators. In addition, a quantitative estimation of the relative
   amount of photons absorbed by eye photoreceptors was achieved. Quantum
   catches were calculated for humans, for honeybees and for a species of
   bird. Contrasts to background values were also estimated in relation to
   the ability to detect flowers.}},

Abstract = {{A commercialized bumble bee pollinator (Bombus terrestris) introduced
   from Europe has colonized in Japan and potentially competes with native
   bumble bees for food and nest sites. To examine the competitive impacts,
   a field removal experiment was conducted in an area in northern Japan
   where B. terrestris has become feral. In 2005 and 2006, totals of 1,511
   and 2,978 B. terrestris bees, respectively, were killed in six removal
   sites. In those 2 years and the pre-removal year (2004), the bee
   abundance and worker body size were measured in the six removal sites
   and seven control sites, and effects of the removal on the measurements
   were examined using statistical models. In 2005 only, the removal
   decreased the number of B. terrestris queens and increased that of two
   native species, B. ardens and B. hypocrita, the tongue length of which
   overlaps that of B. terrestris. The removal in 2005 affected the worker
   body size of neither B. terrestris nor any native species. These results
   show the competitive impacts of exotic B. terrestris on the queen
   abundance of the native species that are likely to share floral
   resources with B. terrestris.}},

   Brazil, the quartzitic range (Ouro Branco) and metaliferous fields (Ouro
   Preto). At these sites ecosystems are endangered by high anthropogenic
   impacts, particularly due to mining and urbanization. The samples were
   collected for 10 months in each site, twice a month, from 8:00 am to
   5:00 pm. The bees belonged to 77 species and 5 subfamilies. Bee species
   and abundance increased with the increase in the number of plant species
   and plant abundance at both sites. Bee richness and abundance were
   higher in Ouro Branco than in Ouro Preto. Our results showed that bee
   diversity may be regulated by resource availability.}},

   Cratylia argentea}},
Journal = {{TROPICAL GRASSLANDS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{246-252}},
Abstract = {{Cratylia argentea is a high-quality forage legume shrub, with particular
   potential for the subhumid tropics owing to its adaptation to acid and
   infertile soils and drought tolerance. However, lack of knowledge about
   the ability of this species to self-pollinate makes purity maintenance
   of accessions difficult. Studies were conducted to investigate whether
   the gametes of C. argentea flowers are self-compatible, and to verify
   the dependence of reproduction on insects. Pod set and seed production
   were assessed in a pollination experiment with 4 treatments (spontaneous
   self-pollination, artificial self-pollination, insect pollination and
   artificial cross-pollination). Our results (0-1.2\% pod set after
   selfing, 3.4\% after insect pollination and 20.3\% after artificial
   crossing) suggest that C. argentea is mostly self-incompatible. Seed:
   ovule ratios were 0.63 with insect pollination and 0.78 with artificial
   crossing. We found that pollen grains mature before the stigma becomes
   receptive, which suggests that the species is cross-pollinated. We also
   found evidence that C. argentea depends on large solitary bees for
   pollination, based on flower structure and the stigma becoming receptive
   only after tripping of the flower. Xylocopa frontalis and 2 Centris
   species were identified as key pollinators. In view of its simplicity,
   the research procedure utilised is suggested for other tropical legume
   species pollinated by large insects.}},

Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Linum aretioides Boiss., a local endemic, is distributed only on 2
   mountains (Izmir: Bozdag; Denizli: Babadag) at the western part of
   Turkey between 1630 and 2300 m altitudes, above the tree line. The
   studies were conducted on Mount Bozdag above the ski complex between
   1750 and 2150 m, and on Mount Babadag between 1630-2300 m both located
   at subalpine zones. Four 8 x 8 m quadrats on Bozdag and 5 on Babadag
   were used for the experiments. The development of reproductive
   structures of plants and frequency of insect visits were observed from
   early May to late June in 2006 and 2007. Blooming and pollination
   periods terminated by the last week in May on Babadag and by the second
   week in June on Bozdag. Temperatures below 10 degrees C before these
   periods appear to affect the activities of main pollinators, such as
   bees and butterflies, resulting in a decline in pollination, and
   eventually in seed formation. In Bozdag, the average relative humidity
   values at 1000 hours, when the insect activities were the highest, were
   65.22 +/- 2.79\% in June 2006, 61.6 +/- 4.44\% in May 2007, and 59.6 +/-
   3.53\% in June 2007. The corresponding values on Babadag were 52.8 +/-
   3.1\%, 59.58 +/- 3.52\%, and 53.28 +/- 3.41\%, respectively. The most
   effective species in pollination process were butterflies, in particular
   Pieris brassicae.}},

Volume = {{1195}},

Abstract = {{Bees pollinate most of the world's wild plant species and provide
   economically valuable pollination services to crops; yet knowledge of
   bee conservation biology lags far behind other taxa such as vertebrates
   and plants. There are few long-term data on bee populations, which makes
   their conservation status difficult to assess. The best-studied groups
   are the genus Bombus (the bumble bees), and bees in the EU generally;
   both of these are clearly declining. However, it is not known to what
   extent these groups represent the approximately 20,000 species of bees
   globally. As is the case for insects in general, bees are
   underrepresented in conservation planning and protection efforts. For
   example, only two bee species are on the global IUCN Red List, and no
   bee is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, even though many
   bee species are known to be in steep decline or possibly extinct. At
   present, bee restoration occurs mainly in agricultural contexts, funded
   by government programs such as agri-environment schemes (EU) and the
   Farm Bill (USA). This is a promising approach given that many bee
   species can use human-disturbed habitats, and bees provide valuable
   pollination services to crops. However, agricultural restorations only
   benefit species that persist in agricultural landscapes, and they are
   more expensive than preserving natural habitat elsewhere. Furthermore,
   such restorations benefit bees in only about half of studied cases. More
   research is greatly needed in many areas of bee conservation, including
   basic population biology, bee restoration in nonagricultural contexts,
   and the identification of disturbance-sensitive bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Biogeographical patterns and diversification processes in Andean and
   Patagonian flora are not yet well understood. Calceolaria is a highly
   diversified genus of these areas, representing one of the most
   specialized plant-pollinator systems because flowers produce nonvolatile
   oils, a very unusual floral reward. Phylogenetic analyses with molecular
   (ITS and matK) and morphological characters from 103 Calceolaria species
   were conducted to examine relationships, to understand biogeographic
   patterns, and to detect evolutionary patterns of floral and ecological
   characters. Total evidence analysis retrieved three major clades, which
   strongly correspond to the three previously recognized subgenera,
   although only subgenus Rosula was retrieved as a monophyletic group. A
   single historical event explains the expansion from the southern to
   central Andes, while different parallel evolutionary lines show a
   northward expansion from the central to northern Andes across the
   Huancabamba Deflection, an important geographical barrier in northern
   Peru. Polyploidy, acquisition of elaiophores, and a nototribic
   pollination mechanism are key aspects of the evolutionary history of
   Calceolaria. Pollination interactions were more frequently established
   with Centris than with Chalepogenus oil-collecting bee species. The
   repeated loss of the oil gland and shifts to pollen as the only reward
   suggest an evolutionary tendency from highly to moderately specialized
   pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal development has led to extensive habitat destruction and the
   near extinction of the beach clustervine, Jacquemontia reclinata
   (Convolvulaceae), an endangered, perennial vine endemic to dune and
   coastal strand communities in south-eastern Florida. We examined the
   breeding system of this rare species, and observed visitors to its
   flowers, as part of a larger effort to document its status and
   facilitate its recovery.
   Reproductively mature experimental plants were grown from seed collected
   from wild plants in two of the largest remaining populations. Controlled
   hand pollinations on potted plants were conducted to determine the level
   of compatibility of the species and to investigate compatibility within
   and between populations. Seeds from the hand pollinations were planted
   in soil, and they were monitored individually, recording time to seed
   germination (cotyledon emergence). Wild plants were observed in several
   of the remaining populations to determine which species visited the
   flowers.
   Hand pollination and seed planting experiments indicate that J.
   reclinata has a mixed mating system: flowers are able to set fruit with
   viable seeds with self-pollen, but outcross pollen produces
   significantly greater fruit and seed set than self-pollen (>= 50 \% for
   crosses vs. < 25 \% for self-pollinations). Visitors included a wide
   array of insect species, primarily of the orders Diptera, Hymenoptera
   and Lepidoptera. All visitors captured and examined carried J. reclinata
   pollen, and usually several other types of pollen.
   Remnant populations of beach clustervine will have greater reproductive
   success not only if floral visitor populations are maintained, but also
   if movement of either pollen or seed takes place between populations.
   Restoration efforts should include provisions for the establishment and
   maintenance of pollinator populations.}},

Title = {{Pollination biology of fruit-bearing hedgerow plants and the role of
   flower-visiting insects in fruit-set}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In the UK, the flowers of fruit-bearing hedgerow plants provide a
   succession of pollen and nectar for flower-visiting insects for much of
   the year. The fruits of hedgerow plants are a source of winter food for
   frugivorous birds on farmland. It is unclear whether recent declines in
   pollinator populations are likely to threaten fruit-set and hence food
   supply for birds. The present study investigates the pollination biology
   of five common hedgerow plants: blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), hawthorn
   (Crataegus monogyna), dog rose (Rosa canina), bramble (Rubus fruticosus)
   and ivy (Hedera helix).
   The requirement for insect pollination was investigated initially by
   excluding insects from flowers by using mesh bags and comparing immature
   and mature fruit-set with those of open-pollinated flowers. Those plants
   that showed a requirement for insect pollination were then tested to
   compare fruit-set under two additional pollination service scenarios:
   (1) reduced pollination, with insects excluded from flowers bagged for
   part of the flowering period, and (2) supplemental pollination, with
   flowers hand cross-pollinated to test for pollen limitation.
   The proportions of flowers setting fruit in blackthorn, hawthorn and ivy
   were significantly reduced when insects were excluded from flowers by
   using mesh bags, whereas fruit-set in bramble and dog rose were
   unaffected. Restricting the exposure of flowers to pollinators had no
   significant effect on fruit-set. However, blackthorn and hawthorn were
   found to be pollen-limited, suggesting that the pollination service was
   inadequate in the study area.
   Ensuring strong populations of insect pollinators may be essential to
   guarantee a winter fruit supply for birds in UK hedgerows.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction in female fitness in large clones can occur as a result of
   increased geitonogamous self-fertilization and its influence through
   inbreeding depression. This possibility was investigated in the
   self-compatible, bee-pollinated perennial herb Aconitum kusnezoffii
   which varies in clone size.
   Field investigations were conducted on pollinator behaviour, flowering
   phenology and variation in seed set. The effects of self-pollination
   following controlled self- and cross-pollination were also examined.
   Selfing rates of differently sized clones were assessed using allozyme
   markers.
   High rates of geitonogamous pollination were associated with large
   display size. Female fitness at the ramet level decreased with clone
   size. Fruit and seed set under cross-pollination were significantly
   higher than those under self-pollination. The pre-dispersal inbreeding
   depression was estimated as 0 center dot 502 based on the difference in
   seed set per flower between self- and cross-pollinated flowers. Selfing
   rates of differently sized clones did not differ.
   It is concluded that in A. kusnezoffii the negative effects of
   self-pollination causing reduced female fertility with clone size arise
   primarily from a strong early-acting inbreeding depression leading to
   the abortion of selfed embryos prior to seed maturation.}},

Abstract = {{Melipona seminigra merrillae is one of the main pollinators of Central
   Amazon native flora. These stingless bees are reared as economic
   alternative and for forest conservation purposes. Nine polymorphic
   microsatellite markers were characterized in 44 genotypes of M.
   seminigra merrillae from the Meliponary of the Instituto Nacional de
   Pesquisas da Amazonia, INPA (3 degrees 05.838'S 059 degrees 59.103'W),
   Manaus, Brazil. The number of alleles observed for each locus ranged
   from 3 to 8, with an average of 3.7 alleles per locus. The polymorphism
   information content (PIC) varied between 0.21 and 0.81 (average 0.50)
   and the discriminating power (D) ranged from 0.59 to 0.98 (average
   0.77). The observed heterozygosity (H-o) and the expected heterozygosity
   (H-e) were 0.04-0.68 and 0.19-0.84, respectively. A cross-amplification
   test in three Melipona species suggested potential transferability of
   these microsatellites. These microsatellite markers should be useful for
   characterizing natural populations and specie conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Fruit set limits the productivity of the tomato crop in the greenhouse.
   In North Mediterranean conditions two tomato crop cycles can be carried
   out in the same year. Environmental constraints limiting pollination in
   the cycles may impose the use of different pollination techniques, both
   from the productive and from the economical point of view. The aim of
   this study is to analyze whether flower vibration, bumblebee
   pollination, or auxin spraying, improve fruit production of early and
   late tomato greenhouse crops.
   Treatments were more effective in the early crop, carried out in spring,
   than in the late one in summer-autumn. For both crop cycles, the highest
   production was for the bumblebee pollinated plants. The mechanical
   flower vibration technique and the auxin treatment significantly
   increased production in the early crop, but they were ineffective in the
   late cycle crop. However, treating the early crop with auxins may result
   in nipple-shape fruits. Earliness was not affected by the treatments.
   Fruit set was improved by all treatments tested and in both crop cycles.
   In both seasons, the use of bumblebees was the most successful
   treatment, and the maximum effectiveness was observed during the periods
   of low night temperatures in the early cycle, when fruit set was limited
   due to impaired production of viable pollen and/or poor pollen release.
   Auxin and vibration enhancement of fruit set was higher for the early
   than for the late crop cycle. The environmental conditions were
   determinant for the effectiveness of the treatments. Moreover, the
   bumblebee efficiency was demonstrated not only when the climatic factors
   were limiting for tomato fruit set, but also when fruit-set was not
   limited by natural climatic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Process planning (PP) has an important role in manufacturing systems
   design and operations. Volume decomposition and machinable volumes (MVs)
   or machining features determination is the core activity in process
   planning. This process requires extraction of elementary volumes (EVs),
   merging or clustering EVs to construct feasible MVs and finally
   selecting an optimal combination of MVs. Development of MVs is an
   important activity, so that better solution is obtained by better
   developed MVs. Generation of limited number of MVs or machining
   features, which is often performed by experts may miss the optimal
   solution. Also, using exact methods such as combinatorial optimization
   not only generate infeasible MVs, but also require an excessive amount
   of computational time. In this research, the meta-heuristic procedure of
   flower pollinating by artificial bees (FPAB) is used in manufacturing
   context to generate and assess the feasibility of MVs. Furthermore, a
   set-covering method is used to select the optimal solution. The
   performance of the proposed model is assessed through some numerical
   examples. The encouraging results of the numerical examples demonstrate
   good performance of the proposed method in machining feature or
   machinable volumes determination problem (MVDP).}},

Abstract = {{Japanese hornfaced bees Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) (Hymenoptera:

   to maximize crop pollination. This study was conducted to deter-mine
   lower temperature thresholds (LTDs), optimum temperatures, and required
   degree-day accumulation for emergence of O. cornifrons adults. Patterns
   of temperature-dependent emergence of O. cornifrons adults at seven
   temperatures (3.9, 12.0, 18.6, 26.6, 30.3, 35.6, and 42.5 degrees C)
   were modeled and simulated with linear and nonlinear regression

   for emergence of male and female O. cornifrons adults were 125.2 DD,
   with LTD of 8.9 degrees C and 179.8 DD, with LTD of 8.6 degrees C,

Abstract = {{Insects provide essential ecological services in both the natural
   environment and in human-dominated habitats. Because pollinator declines
   associated with land use change have been reported across the globe,
   there is great concern that pollinators and the ecosystem services they
   provide will be negatively affected. This study examines the diversity
   and abundance of bee pollinators in grasslands in Boulder County,
   Colorado, USA. Over five years, 5,200 bees were collected in grassland
   plots with different levels of urbanization. Most of the difference in
   species composition among three levels of urbanization was due to rare
   species that may not have been discovered in all plots. Neither the
   number of species nor their abundance differed significantly among the
   plot types, although the trend indicated increasing diversity with
   increasing distance from urbanization. Most notably, measures of
   urbanization, such as the amount of pavement and development, were not
   correlated with diversity. The most important factor affecting bee
   abundance, particularly for ground-nesting bees, was grazing regime. Bee
   abundance also was positively related to the number of flowering plant
   species. Other studies of different insects (grasshoppers and
   butterflies) in these plots showed results similar to ours. In contrast,
   previous studies on song-birds, raptors, and rodents showed significant
   differences between urban edge and remote plots in terms of organism
   abundance and diversity. Together, these results suggest that factors
   other than the degree of urbanization are important in determining
   insect abundance and diversity.}},

   Myrtaceae species were studied in the coastal plain forest (Ubatuba,

   the species flowered each year was consistently the same. However, the
   timing of flowering onset, peak, end, and overlap differed from one year

   the pollen:ovule ratios, but two of them seem to present some degree of
   self-compatibility. Flowers of all species opened at sunrise and lasted
   for I day. Bombus morio (Apidae: Bombini) was the most common visitor

Abstract = {{The composition of the floral nectar sugars and amino acids of four
   species of Passiflora (P. foetida, P. caerulea, P. suberosa, and P.
   misera) included in different infrageneric taxa and with distinct
   pollination mechanisms has been studied. The effect of weather and
   floral age on nectar volume, existence, and total and relative amounts
   of the various compounds was explored. The proportion of sugars was
   rather constant within a given species whereas the composition, number,
   and total quantity of amino acids showed great intraspecific and
   intra-plant variability; these nectar properties were independent of
   floral stage or meteorological conditions. Species belonging to the same
   subgenus displayed equivalent sugar ratios and similar total amount of
   amino acids, so these characteristics might be conservative in the
   genus. For all species, the amino acid concentration surpassed known
   values for their respective pollination syndromes, viz. bee and
   wasp-pollinated flowers. No relationship emerged between pollinators
   with different glossa length and nectars with distinct sugar ratios.
   Rather, nectar chemical composition seems to reflect taxonomic
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{The Putranjivaceae is an enigmatic family, notable for being the only
   lineage outside the Capparales to possess the glucosinolate biochemical
   pathway, which forms the basis of an induced chemical defense system
   against herbivores (the ``mustard oil bomb{''}). We investigated the
   pollination biology and floral scent chemistry of Drypetes natalensis
   (Putranjivaceae), a dioecious subcanopy tree with flowers borne on the
   stein (cauliflory). Flowering male trees were more abundant than female
   ones and produced about 10-fold more flowers. Flowers of both sexes
   produce copious amounts of nectar on disc-like nectaries accessible to
   short-tongued insects. The main flower visitors observed were cetoniid
   beetles, bees, and vespid wasps. Pollen load analysis indicated that
   these insects exhibit a high degree of fidelity to D. natalensis
   flowers. Insects effectively transfer pollen from male to female plants
   resulting in about 31\% of female flowers developing fruits with viable
   seeds. Cetoniid beetles showed significant orientation toward the scent
   of D. natalensis flowers in a Y-maze olfactometer. The scents of male
   and female flowers are similar in chemical composition and dominated by
   fatty acid derivatives and isothiocyanates from the glucosinolate
   pathway. The apparent constitutive emission of isothiocyanates raises
   interesting new questions about their functional role in flowers.}},

Title = {{On the roles of colour and scent in a specialized floral mimicry system}},

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1077-1084}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Sexually deceptive orchids achieve cross-pollination
   by mimicking the mating signals of female insects, generally
   hymenopterans. This pollination mechanism is often highly specific as it
   is based primarily on the mimicry of mating signals, especially the
   female sex pheromones of the targeted pollinator. Like many deceptive
   orchids, the Mediterranean species Ophrys arachnitiformis shows high
   levels of floral trait variation, especially in the colour of the
   perianth, which is either green or white/pinkinsh within populations.
   The adaptive significance of perianth colour polymorphism and its
   influence on pollinator visitation rates in sexually deceptive orchids
   remain obscure.
   Methods The relative importance of floral scent versus perianth colour
   in pollinator attraction in this orchid pollinator mimicry system was
   evaluated by performing floral scent analyses by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) and behavioural bioassays with the pollinators
   under natural conditions were performed.
   Key Results The relative and absolute amounts of behaviourally active
   compounds are identical in the two colour morphs of O. arachnitiformis.
   Neither presence/absence nor the colour of the perianth (green versus
   white) influence attractiveness of the flowers to Colletes cunicularius
   males, the main pollinator of O. arachnitiformis.
   Conclusion Chemical signals alone can mediate the interactions in highly
   specialized mimicry systems. Floral colour polymorphism in O.
   arachnitiformis is not subjected to selection imposed by C. cunicularius
   males, and an interplay between different non-adaptive processes may be
   responsible for the maintenance of floral colour polymorphism both
   within and among populations.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial bumblebee colonies are important crop pollinators. Here we
   assess whether application of artificial foraging recruitment pheromone
   can increase foraging activity in Bombus terrestris colonies on a
   relevant timescale for commercial pollination. We measured bee traffic
   from the nest to a foraging arena, which is correlated with foraging
   activity under natural recruitment conditions. During continuous
   pheromone exposure bee traffic increased by 1.5 to 3.6 times, and this
   increase lasted up to 105 minute. Repeated 20 minute exposures of a
   colony to recruitment pheromone, with at least 30 minutes intermissions,
   triggered consistent traffic increases over a four week period. We
   conclude that artificial recruitment pheromone can reliably boost bee
   traffic leaving previously inactive colonies. This method could improve
   foraging activity and pollination in greenhouse colonies, especially
   young colonies reluctant to start foraging after introduction to the
   crop.}},

   did not reveal uniform results. A null-model analysis of different
   nestedness metrics showed no evidence despite the asymmetric structure
   of bipartite graphs. However, further analysis revealed significant
   modularization within the community with connected hub species within
   modules and module-interlinking connector species. The web is
   characterized by 4-6 dominant connector plant species, representing four
   main flower types. The pattern depends on the year. DCA demonstrates
   that the connector plant species support resources for bees of different

Abstract = {{In many ant species, the queens can keep spermatozoa alive in their
   spermatheca for several years, which goes along with unique
   morphological characteristics of the queen's spermatheca. The relative
   spermatheca size in ant queens is prominently larger than that in social
   wasps. Furthermore, the epithelium lining the spermatheca reservoir of
   ants consists of columnar cells in the hilar region and squamous cells
   in the distal region, whereas it is formed by columnar cells only in
   social wasps. To study the evolution of the unique spermatheca
   morphology in ant queens, we compared the various processes during
   spermatheca development between two ponerine ant species of the genus
   Pachycondyla (= Brachyponera) and three polistine wasp species of the
   genus Polistes. From histological observations, we can define four
   developmental events in the ant queens: (1) invagination of the
   spermatheca primordium, (2) the reservoir wall thickness becomes
   unequal, (3) the reservoir diameter doubles as the lining epithelial
   cells become flattened except for the hilar region, and (4) the increase
   in thickness of the reservoir epithelium is limited to the hilar region
   which doubles in thickness. In polistine wasps, the second and the third
   developmental events are absent and the entire epithelium of the
   spermatheca wall becomes thick in the final step. We therefore conclude
   that for ant queens the second and third steps are crucial for the
   enlargement of the spermatheca size, and that the second to the fourth
   steps are crucial for the specialization of the reservoir wall
   structure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may affect the reproductive success of plant
   populations in many different ways. Thus, negative, neutral, or positive
   plant responses can be observed, according to the balance of the
   different interactions. Variables related to mutualistic and
   antagonistic interactions (pollinator activity and gall occurrence,
   respectively) were measured on Byrsonima sericea populations of a
   fragmented seashore area (restinga) in southeastern Brazil. Pollinator
   visits to the oil-bearing flowers, insect gall occurrence on stems and
   inflorescences, and fruit set of B. sericea were compared between three
   small (up to 0.3 ha) and three large (14.0-99.0 ha) fragments. MANOVA
   showed differences between fragment classes. Nevertheless, a posteriori
   univariate ANOVA showed that the pollinator visit frequency was more
   than twofold higher in small fragments, and that gall occurrence and
   fruit set did not show significant differences between small and large
   fragments. These results suggest that the habitat fragmentation does not
   affect the female reproductive success of B. sericea in the studied
   restinga areas because resource availability seems to be a more
   important factor for fruit set than pollen limitation due to pollination
   failure. This is the first work assessing the effects of habitat
   fragmentation in restinga areas, which are intensely impacted by
   urbanization, so that no generalization about the fragmentation
   consequences can still be made for this ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Floral characteristics often indicate the pollinators' functional group
   visiting the plant and the pollination syndromes associated with them.
   This idea has been challenged in the past decades due to increasing
   evidence that most plants, including those exhibiting floral syndromes,
   are visited by large arrays of species that differ in their
   effectiveness as pollinators. Our study focuses on Mecardonia tenella
   (Plantaginaceae) from the Araucaria forest of southern Brazil, which
   exhibits characteristics of the oil flower pollination syndrome.
   However, it is visited by three types of functional groups of bees: male
   orchid bees, oil-collecting bees, and pollen-seeking bees. The relative
   contribution of each functional group to the plant's reproductive
   success was estimated based on their pollen load, visitation frequency,
   and morphology. We assessed resources, phenology, and breeding system of
   M. tenella. Our results indicate that flowers lack nectar, but
   volatiles, lipids, and pollen are resources that can be gathered by
   visitors. This combination of floral traits and visitors' assemblage
   makes M. tenella a challenge to the concept of pollination syndromes.
   Our findings indicate that the current interactions may not reflect the
   circumstances under which some floral traits of this plant were
   selected.}},

Abstract = {{Poor seed-set limits potential for soybean hybrid seed production. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate effects of different pollinators
   on the rate of seed set in three soybean cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS)
   lines, JLCMS9A, JLCMS82A, and JLCMS89A. The following five treatments
   were applied under net room isolation-conditions: (i) insecticide
   application and release of alfalfa leafcutter bees (Mega-Chile
   rotundata) during flowering; (ii) insecticide application in the absence
   of leafcutter bees; (iii) release of alfalfa leafcutter bees during
   flowering without insecticide application; (iv) the absence of
   insecticide or alfalfa leafcutter bees during flowering; (v) plants
   without a net cover and pesticide application. Results indicated that
   the rate of pod production and seed set differ significantly between CMS
   lines and between treatments. Alfalfa leafcutter bees were an effective
   pollinator as evidenced by increases in pod-bearing rate and seed-set
   rate respectively from 21.35 to 53.22\% and from 19.91 to 58.77\% in the
   three CMS lines. The three CMS lines also showed significant differences
   in seed set, with JLCMS82A exhibiting the highest rate in all five
   treatments, followed by JLCMS9A and then JLCMS89A. These results
   suggested that thrips (Sericothrips variabilis) might have some effect
   on soybean pollination, but did not elicit a major influence based on
   the low increases in seed production. The natural insect population
   served an important role in outcrossing and seed set in soybean.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees leave traces of cuticular hydrocarbons on flowers they visit,
   with the amount deposited being positively related to the number of
   visits. We asked whether such footprint hydrocarbons are retained on
   flowers for sufficiently long periods of time so as to reflect bee
   visitation in pollination studies. In laboratory experiments, flower
   corollae (Primula veris, Digitalis grandiflora) visited by Bombus
   terrestris workers retained bee-derived nonacosenes (C(29)H(58)) in
   near-unchanged quantities for 24 hours, both at 15 and 25A degrees C.
   Additionally, synthetic (Z)-9-tricosene applied to flower corollae of
   the deadnettle Lamium maculatum was retained for 48 hours in an
   unchanged quantity. In a field survey, the amount of footprint alkenes
   on flowers of comfrey (Symphytum officinale) plants was positively
   correlated with the number of bumblebee visits that those plants had
   received during the day. Together, these data suggest that flowers
   retain a long-term quantitative record of bumblebee visitation. The
   analysis of petal extracts by gas chromatography could provide a cheap
   and reliable way of quantifying bumblebee visits in landscape scale
   studies of pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The flagellate Crithidia bombi and the neogregarine Apicystis bombi have
   been found in individuals of Bombus terrestris, a Palaearctic species of
   humble bee commercially reared and shipped worldwide for pollination
   services. B. terrestris has recently entered into the northwestern
   Patagonia region of Argentina from Chile. where it was introduced in
   1998. Prevalence was 21.6\% for C bombi and 3.6\% for A. bombi (n =
   111). The pathogens were not detected in 441 humble bees belonging to
   five of the eight known Argentine native species (Bombus atratus, Bombus
   morio, Bombus bellicosus, Bombus opifex, Bombus tucumanus) collected
   elsewhere in the Country. Although the absence of natural occurrence of
   C bombi and A. bombi in Argentine native humble bees cannot be
   ascertained at present due to the limited surveys performed, it is
   important to report their detection in invasive B. terrestris. The
   invasion event is relatively recent and the accompanying pathogens are
   not species specific within the genus Bombus. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Plants that do not develop flags probably benefit from the flag signals
   displayed by their neighbors, without bearing the costs of signal
   production. Greenhouse-grown S. viridis plants allocated a low
   proportion of their biomass to flags. Plants grown under water stress
   did not reduce biomass allocation to flags as compared to irrigated
   controls. Water loss rates of picked flags were lower than those of
   picked leaves. These findings suggest that the expenses of flag
   production and maintenance are modest, reducing the selective advantage
   of individuals that do not carry flags. We discuss additional potential
   evolutionary mechanisms that may select for flag production.}},

Abstract = {{Wind pollination can provide reproductive insurance for
   animal-pollinated dioecious plants in the absence of available
   pollinators, but combinations of insect and wind pollination (ambophily)
   have rarely been studied in hermaphrodite herbs. We examined the stable
   occurrence of insect pollination and wind pollination over 4 years in a
   population of a biennial Aconitum species (A. gymnandrum) with
   actinomorphic and degenerate sepals. The total frequency of visits of
   two bumblebee species showed no distinct fluctuations in the studied
   population among the 4 years. However, seed production of netted flowers
   after emasculation indicated wind pollination had occurred. The seed
   number of bagged flowers with one visit by bumblebees was significantly
   less than that of netted flowers after one visit, or in control flowers.
   Both seed number and fruit set of netted flowers were significantly
   lower than in control flowers. These results suggest that wind
   pollination provides supplementary pollen to unvisited and/or
   once-visited flowers, but accounts for only a small amount of seed
   production compared to bumblebee pollination in natural conditions. Such
   a combination of insect and wind pollination might play an important
   role in maintaining sexual reproduction of this biennial herb, allowing
   it to persist in arid habitats on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   especially during Quaternary glacial periods when pollinator populations
   oscillated extensively.}},

   flowering G. flavum plants in invaded and uninvaded sites and found that
   G. flavum flowers in uninvaded sites received significantly more total
   visits. In addition, we hand-pollinated flowers on plants of G. flavum
   with (i) pure conspecific pollen, (ii) pure S. elaeagnifolium pollen and
   (iii) three different mixtures of the two types of pollen (containing
   25, 50 and 75\% invasive pollen). As a control, flowers were left
   unmanipulated or were permanently bagged. Seed set did not differ
   significantly between flowers receiving pollen mixtures and pure
   conspecific pollen. However, in the open pollination treatment, seed set
   was significantly lower than in the 100\% conspecific pollen treatment,
   which suggests pollen limitation. Bagged flowers had very low seed set.
   G. flavum was generally resilient against the deposition of S.
   elaeagnifolium pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Homeotic changes played a considerable role during the evolution of
   flowers, but how floral homeotic mutants initially survive in nature has
   remained enigmatic. To better understand the evolutionary potential of
   floral homeotic mutants, we established as a model system Stamenoid
   petals (Spe), a natural variant of Capsella bursa-pastoris
   (Brassicaceae). In the flowers of Spe plants, petals are transformed
   into stamens, whereas all other floral organs are unaffected. In
   contrast with most other homeotic mutants, the Spe variant occurs in
   relatively stable populations in the wild. In order to determine how the
   profound change in floral architecture influences plant performance in
   the wild, we performed common garden experiments running over 3 years.
   Here, we show that Spe and wild-type plants attract the same assemblage
   of floral visitors: mainly hoverflies, wild bees and thrips. However,
   floral visitation is about twice as frequent in wild-type plants as in
   Spe plants. Nevertheless, the numbers of seeds per fruit were about the
   same in both variants. Wild-type plants produced more flowers, fruits
   and seeds per plant than Spe plants, whereas the germination capacity of
   Spe seeds was higher than that of the wild-type. Determination of
   volatile composition revealed monoterpenes and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde,
   which were detected only in wild-type flowers, presumably because they
   are produced only by petals. Our data indicate that the similar fitness
   of Spe and wild-type C. bursa-pastoris in the field results from complex
   compensation between plant architecture and germination capacity. In
   contrast, flower structure and floral visitation are only of minor
   importance, possibly because C. bursa-pastoris is mainly
   self-pollinating.}},

Abstract = {{Despite concern over a putative ``global pollination crisis{''}, we
   still have an incomplete understanding of how bee communities respond to
   land-use change. I studied the responses of social stingless (or
   ``meliponine{''}) bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponini) to surrounding
   forest cover and floral resources in 35 sites in a largely deforested
   landscape in Costa Rica over three years. sampling bees with a
   standardized netting protocol. I recorded a diverse fauna of
   meliponines, comprised of 20 species and nine genera. I found that
   meliponine species richness and abundance are strongly related to forest
   cover, but not floral resource variables (blooming plant species
   richness and abundance). The effect of forest on meliponine abundance,
   but not diversity, disappeared when the most common meliponine species,
   Trigona fulviventris (which comprised similar to 45\% of sampled
   individuals), was excluded from analyses. Meliponine community
   composition, by contrast, was related most strongly to plant species
   richness, only weakly to forest cover, and not related to blooming plant
   abundance. This work differs from past work in the same landscape, which
   did not find evidence of changes in species richness or abundance of
   meliponines and forest-related variables (distance to forest or forest
   fragment size), but did find shifts toward meliponine-dominated
   communities near forests, especially larger ones. The larger true sample
   size (i.e. number of sample sites) of the present work likely improved
   the statistical power to detect these relationships. While meliponines
   are forest dependent, I recorded some species in the smallest forest
   fragments in the landscape, and as a group they respond strongly to
   overall forest cover in the landscape (i.e. including both small and
   large patches of forest) Both of these observations support arguments
   for preserving even small fragments of forest in agricultural
   landscapes. Given the ecological and economic importance of meliponine
   bees, it is imperative that we better understand their long-term
   conservation needs in the changing tropical landscapes of the world. (C)

Abstract = {{Natural tropical forests are highly diverse and are known to contribute
   to forest-based services such as pollination of nearby crops. Landscape
   changes cause spatial and temporal bee community changes, but
   consequences how the community changes affect pollination is not well
   analyzed. This paper addresses the effects of rainforest distance and on
   site flower resources in agro-forests on spatial and temporal variation
   in pollinator communities and the consequences for coffee pollination.
   The Study was conducted in 24 agro-forests dominated by coffee and cacao
   in Sulawesi, Indonesia differing in their distance to rainforest margin
   of the Lore-Lindu National Park and in flower density and its temporal
   variation. In all agro-forests, (1) transect surveys of the understory
   were obtained over a five-month period to assess bee community
   compositional similarity, bee diversity, and the temporal variation in
   bee diversity; and (2) coffee flower visitors were observed and open and
   bagged pollination treatments conducted over one week of coffee blooming
   to assess bee diversity and the spatial variation in bee diversity and
   coffee pollination.
   Mean number of shared species of the understory ranged between 40 and
   60\% per agro-forest and was higher in agro-forests nearby the
   rainforest than in agro-forests with a minimal distance of 500 m
   isolated from the rainforest. Mean species richness in the understory
   and in coffee flowers decreased with rainforest isolation and increased
   with flower resource availability. Temporal variation in bee species
   richness of the understory and spatial variation of the coffee
   flower-visiting bee species richness per agro-forest increased with
   forest distance. The variation in bee species richness decreased the
   mean and increased the spatial variation in bee-pollinated coffee fruit
   set per agro-forest.
   In conclusion, crops grown near intact rainforests and which profit from
   the pollination by many species may fluctuate less in bee-pollinated
   fruit set across crop plants than crop plants in isolated agriculture
   that receive low or even single species pollination services (C) 2009

Abstract = {{As the body of research on the ecosystem service of pollination grows,
   our ability to tackle a range of agricultural, conservation, and land
   management issues is limited by our understanding of pollinator foraging
   patterns and requirements. In particular, better knowledge of which
   habitats bees utilize for foraging over their lifetime would inform a
   range of applied and theoretical questions Traditional methods of
   studying foraging are either impractical for insects (e.g. radio
   tracking) or else are limited spatially or temporally (e g. observations
   by researchers). Here we describe a method for using stable isotopes of
   carbon and nitrogen from bee tissues to gain an integrated signal of
   which habitats a bee has foraged in over its lifetime, using three
   species of social stingless bee (Apidae: Meliponini) in a fragmented
   tropical forest landscape in southern Costa Rica as a test case.
   There were strongly significant differences in the carbon and nitrogen
   isotope signals of bees collected in the landscape extremes: the largest
   forests and largest open pastures in the region We could not estimate
   proportions of dietary carbon and nitrogen derived from different
   habitats. however, due to the high sample variance. Still, isotope
   ratios reflect a signature of the habitat that a bee has foraged in, and
   we found significant relationships between foraging patterns and season,
   landscape context (proportion of forest surrounding sample sites) and
   local biotic context (bee and plant diversity and abundance). Landscape
   context was the most consistent factor among the analyses, in line with
   the idea that meliponines do not preferentially forage in deforested
   habitats. Bee and plant diversity and abundance showed various
   significant relationships with the isotopic values of the different
   species. but the patterns were inconsistent. These results are
   potentially consistent with habitat switching from pasture to forest in
   areas of greater competition, but the extreme spatiotemporal variability
   in resource density likely blurs these patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators provide important services in both wild and

   widespread anthropogenic landscape change. We explored the responses of
   wild bees to exotic floral species and novel habitat in a fragmented,

   bee specimens collected in 13 suburban grassland fragments in Denver,
   Colorado were sampled and compared with a pollen reference collection.
   Averaged across two seasonal sampling rounds, 45\% of the bee-borne
   pollen grains were identified to the species level. Wild bees in this
   system were very receptive to using alien plants for pollen foraging, at
   least 45\% of pollen sampled from bee specimens consisted of non-native
   pollen grains. During peak flowering in early summer, bees obtained at
   least 32\% of their pollen resources from within-fragment sources and at
   least 7.5\% from surrounding suburban residential yards. In midsummer,
   within-fragment sources represented 58\% of pollen sampled while yards
   dropped to 1.5\%. These bees appear to be more accepting of exotic
   floral species than of exotic habitat types (yards). The advantages and
   disadvantages of pollen load analysis for movement studies are

Abstract = {{The morphology and development of the digestive tract of insects has
   been extensively studied, but little attention has been given to the
   development of the rectal pads. These organs are responsible for
   absorption of water and salts. In insects where they occur, there are
   usually six ovoid rectal pads located in the medial-anterior portion of
   the rectum. The rectal pad has three types of cells: principal, basal,
   and junctional. The arrangement of these three cell types delimits an
   intrapapillary lumen. The aim of the current study is to describe the
   development of the rectal pads during postembryonic development of
   Melipona quadrifasciata anthidioides and Melipona scutellaris. Specimens
   were analyzed at the following developmental stages: white-, pink-,
   brown-, and black-eyed pupae, and adult workers. The development of the
   rectal pad begins as a thickening of the epithelium in white-eyed pupae
   at 54 hr. At this stage, there is neither a basal cell layer nor
   intrapapillary lumen. The basal layers begin to form in the pink-eyed
   pupa and are completely formed at the end of the development of the
   brown-eyed pupa. In the brown-eyed pupal stage, the intrapapillary lumen
   is formed and the junctional cells are positioned and completely
   differentiated. Necrotic and apoptotic cell death were detected along
   with cell proliferation in the whole rectum during pupal development,
   suggesting that the development of the rectal pads involves cell
   proliferation, death, and differentiation. The rectal pads originate
   only from the ectoderm. Anat Rec, 292:1602-1611, 2009. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{If stabilizing selection by pollinators is a prerequisite for
   pollinator-mediated floral evolution, spatiotemporal variation in the
   pollinator assemblage may confuse the plant-pollinator interaction in a
   given species. Here, effective pollinators in a living fossil plant
   Nelumbo nucifera (Nelumbonaceae) were examined to test whether beetles
   are major pollinators as predicted by its pollination syndrome.
   Pollinators of N. nucifera were investigated in 11 wild populations and
   one cultivated population, and pollination experiments were conducted to
   examine the pollinating role of two major pollinators (bees and beetles)
   in three populations.
   Lotus flowers are protogynous, bowl shaped and without nectar. The
   fragrant flowers can be self-heating during anthesis and produce around
   1 million pollen grains per flower. It was found that bees and flies
   were the most frequent flower visitors in wild populations, contributing
   on average 87 center dot 9 and 49 center dot 4 \% of seed set in Mishan
   and Lantian, respectively. Beetles were only found in one wild
   population and in the cultivated population, but the pollinator
   exclusion experiments showed that beetles were effective pollinators of
   Asian sacred lotus.
   This study indicated that in their pollinating role, beetles, probable
   pollinators for this thermoregulating plant, had been replaced by some
   generalist insects in the wild. This finding implies that contemporary
   pollinators may not reflect the pollination syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variation in pollinator composition and abundance is a
   well-recognized phenomenon. However, a weakness of many studies claiming
   specificity of plant-pollinator interactions is that they are often
   restricted to a single locality. The aim of the present study was to
   investigate pollinator effectiveness of the different flower visitors to
   the terrestrial orchid Eulophia alta at three different localities and
   to analyse whether differences in pollinator abundance and composition
   effect this plant's reproductive success.
   Natural pollination was observed in vivo, and manipulative experiments
   were used to study the pollination biology and breeding system of E.
   alta at three sites near Manaus, Brazil. To gain a better understanding
   of the underlying mechanisms of pollinator attraction, nectar
   composition and secretion patterns were also studied, floral scent
   composition was analysed and a bioassay was conducted.
   Flower visitors, pollinator composition, pollinia transfer efficiency of
   particular pollinator species and natural fruit set differed among the
   investigated populations of E. alta. Flowers were self-compatible,
   partially autogamous and effectively pollinated by five bee species
   (four Centris species and Xylocopa muscaria). Visiting insects appeared
   to imbibe small amounts of hexose-rich nectar. Nectar sugar content was
   highest on the third day after flower opening. Floral fragrance analyses
   revealed 42 compounds, of which monoterpenes and benzenoids
   predominated. A bioassay using floral parts revealed that only floral
   tissue from the labellum chamber and labellum tip was attractive to
   flower visitors.
   The data suggest that observed differences in reproductive success in
   the three populations cannot be explained by absolute abundance of
   pollinators alone. Due to behavioural patterns such as disturbance of
   effective pollinators on flowers by male Centris varia bees defending
   territory, pollinia transfer efficiencies of particular pollinator
   species also vary between study sites and result in differing
   reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) play a key role within agricultural systems as
   pollinators of crops and wild flowers. However, this taxon has suffered
   severe declines as a result of agricultural intensification.
   Conservation efforts largely focus on providing forage resources for
   bumblebees through the summer, but providing suitable habitat during the
   period of nest foundation in early spring could be a more effective
   method of boosting local bumblebee populations. This study assesses the
   attractiveness of three different farmland habitat types (hedgerow,
   field margin and grassland), and the relative merits of respective land
   management prescriptions under the Scottish Rural Stewardship scheme to
   nest site searching and foraging bumblebee queens during the period of
   queen emergence and colony foundation. Hedgerows were the least
   attractive habitat type to spring queens. Rural Stewardship species-rich
   grassland comprised a complex vegetation structure attracting nest site
   searching queens, whilst grassland that had been abandoned allowing
   natural regeneration contained more flowers, attracting foraging queens.
   Field margin habitats were the most attractive habitat type, and Rural
   Stewardship field margins attracted both nest site searching and
   foraging queens at relatively high densities. This management option
   consisted of a sown grass mix, giving rise to the complex vegetation
   structure preferred by nest site searching queens, but regular
   disturbance allowed invasion by early flowering bumblebee forage plants.
   These findings suggest that it should be possible to develop simple
   combined management strategies to provide both suitable nesting sites
   and spring forage resources on farmland, promoting bumblebee colony
   foundation and therefore abundance in the agricultural environment. (C)

Abstract = {{Recent declines in North American honeybee populations have highlighted
   the importance of native bee conservation, and the need for research on
   the ecological requirements of native bees in farmland. In this study,
   we investigated the value of hedgerows as foraging habitat for native
   bees in mosaics of small-scale agriculture and natural vegetation in two
   riparian landscapes in southeast Arizona, USA. In the summers of 2002
   and 2003, we surveyed bees and flowers in four habitats: hedgerows,
   agricultural fields, woodlots, and native woodland. We asked: (1) How do
   hedgerows compare to other available habitats in bee abundance and
   species richness? (2) How does bee species composition in hedgerows
   compare to species composition in agricultural fields and woodland? (3)
   How do flower resources in hedgerows compare to those in fields and
   woodland?
   We found that hedgerows were attractive foraging habitat for native
   bees, especially in early summer, when hedgerows tended to have higher
   species richness than other agricultural or natural habitats. Cumulative
   species richness was highest in agricultural fields, although cumulative
   species richness did not significantly differ among fields, hedgerows,
   and woodland. While bee faunas overlapped among habitats, bee
   assemblages in hedgerows were more similar to those in woodland than to
   those in fields. The hedgerow herbaceous flora was roughly intermediate
   to that of fields and woodland; hedgerows also supported high densities
   of woodland-characteristic shrubs. These flowering shrubs were important
   in attracting bees that were otherwise uncommon in the landscape,
   including some species that are potentially valuable pollinators of
   agricultural crops. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research into plant breeding systems enables the evaluation of whether
   seed production depends on pollination agents and gene flow mechanisms
   within and among populations. This aids, in turn, the estimation of the
   appropriate population sizes needed to maintain both genetic and
   species' diversity. Little is known about plant reproductive biology in
   the Monte Desert (Patagonia, Argentina), a habitat threatened by
   desertification as a result of human impact. The mating systems,
   flowering phenologies and pollinator networks were studied in five
   representative plant species of the Monte Desert. The mating systems
   studied ranged from anemophilous pollen dispersion in the dioecious
   Atriplex lampa, to a gradient of dependence on pollinators, from the
   less dependent (facultative self-compatible) Gutierrezia solbrigii and
   two Larrea spp. (L. divaricata and L. cuneifolia) to the most dependent
   Grindelia chiloensis (self-incompatible). Flowering phenology was
   restricted to spring and coincided with pollinator abundance. Solitary
   bees were the main pollinator group, but beetles, flies and butterflies
   were also important. The four insect-pollinated species were moderately
   generalist, but they maintained their own pollinator assemblage.
   Coleopterans depended more on Grindelia chiloensis and dipterans on
   Gutierrezia solbrigii. Lepidopterans frequently visited Gutierrezia
   solbrigii and Larrea divaricata, whereas hymenopterans visited both
   Larrea spp. more frequently. The studied plant species are ecologically
   important, not only as resources for a wide range of pollinator species
   but also for other insects. The Monte Desert is a very
   disturbance-sensitive environment and, as these plant species hardly
   show vegetative regeneration, sexual reproduction is essential for their
   survival. (c) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of

Abstract = {{Field work during the past 15 years has resulted in the discovery of 12
   new species of the western southern African genus Geissorhiza Ker Gawl.
   and range extensions for several more. Following a survey of pollen
   morphology in the genus, we describe new pollen types in one section
   each of the two subgenera: five species of section Ciliatae Goldblatt
   and two of section Weihea Eckl. ex Baker have more complex apertures
   than the plesiomorphic single aperture with a 2-banded operculum found
   in other species. In addition, populations currently referred to the
   typical white (cream)-flowered G. inflexa (D.Delaroche) Goldblatt with
   larger, pink, red or purple flowers, have a third pollen type and are
   recognized as G. erosa (Salisb.) R.C.Foster. The new species are G.
   altimontana from the high Langeberg near Grootvadersbos; G. helmei from
   the Piketberg; G. lapidosa from the Du Toits Kloof Mtns; G. monticola
   from the Swartberg; G. platystigma from Darling, north of Cape Town; G.
   sufflava from the Piketberg; G. tricolor from Riversdale (all subgenus
   Weihea (Eckl. ex Baker) Goldblatt); and G. cantharophila from the Klein
   Roggeveld; G. demissa from the Kamiesberg, Gifberg and Cold Bokkeveld;
   G. exilis from the Waaihoek Mtns in the Worcester District; G. reclinata
   from the Swartberg; and G. saxicola from the northern Cedarberg-Pakhuis
   Mountain complex (all subgenus Geissorhiza). We also report range
   extensions and provide morphological notes for several species,
   including G. monanthos Eckl., new collections of which show that the
   inclusion of G. lewisiae R.C.Foster in that species was incorrect and we
   resurrect the species. The addition of 12 new species and recognition of
   G. erosa and G. lewisiae bring to 99 the number of species in the genus.
   New identification keys for Geissorhiza are provided that include all
   new species. We have also accumulated observations of floral ecology in
   the genus and integrate them with what is known about this aspect of the
   biology of Geissorhiza. Unusual strategies include deceptive pollination
   in G. tulbaghensis F.Bolus by tabanid flies and in two species,
   pollination using empid flies in combination with halictid bees.}},

Abstract = {{To discover the effect of environmental factors on pollinator visitation
   to flowering Medicago sativa, several field experiments were designed to
   examine the diurnal movement patterns of wild bee species in the Hexi
   Corridor of northwestern China. Our study results showed that Megachile
   abluta, M. spissula, and Xylocopa valga showed unimodal diurnal foraging
   behavior, whereas Andrena parvula and Anthophora melanognatha showed
   bimodal diurnal foraging behavior. Correlation analysis indicated that
   diurnal foraging activities of pollinators were significantly correlated
   with environmental factors. Correlations of foraging activities versus
   environmental factors for M. abluta, M. spissula, and X. valga best fit
   a linear model, whereas those of A. parvula and A. melanognatha best fit
   a parallel quadratic model. Results of this study indicated that
   solitary wild bees such as M. abluta, M. spissula, X. valga, A. parvula,
   and A. melanognatha are potential alfalfa pollinators in the Hexi
   Corridor. An understanding of the environmental factors that affect the
   behaviors of different wild bees foraging in alfalfa are basic to the
   utilization of solitary wild bees in a practical way for increased, or
   more consistent, pollination of alfalfa for seed production.}},

Title = {{Floral volatiles controlling ant behaviour}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Ants show complex interactions with plants, both facultative and
   mutualistic, ranging from grazers through seed predators and dispersers
   to herders of some herbivores and guards against others. But ants are
   rarely pollinators, and their visits to flowers may be detrimental to
   plant fitness.
   2. Plants therefore have various strategies to control ant
   distributions, and restrict them to foliage rather than flowers. These
   `filters' may involve physical barriers on or around flowers, or `decoys
   and bribes' sited on the foliage (usually extrafloral nectaries - EFNs).
   Alternatively, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are used as signals to
   control ant behaviour, attracting ants to leaves and/or deterring them
   from functional flowers. Some of the past evidence that flowers repel
   ants by VOCs has been equivocal and we describe the shortcomings of some
   experimental approaches, which involve behavioural tests in artificial
   conditions.
   3. We review our previous study of myrmecophytic acacias, which used in
   situ experiments to show that volatiles derived from pollen can
   specifically and transiently deter ants during dehiscence, the effects
   being stronger in ant-guarded species and more effective on resident
   ants, both in African and Neotropical species. In these plants,
   repellence involves at least some volatiles that are known components of
   ant alarm pheromones, but are not repellent to beneficial bee visitors.
   4. We also present new evidence of ant repellence by VOCs in temperate
   flowers, which is usually pollen-based and active on common European
   ants. We use these data to indicate that across a wide range of plants
   there is an apparent trade-off in ant-controlling filter strategies
   between the use of defensive floral volatiles and the alternatives of
   decoying EFNs or physical barriers.}},

Title = {{The importance of scent and nectar filters in a specialized
   wasp-pollination system}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{931-940}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Plants with open flowers and exposed nectar should attract a wide
   diversity of flower visitors, yet, for reasons that are not yet well
   understood, some plants with these `generalist' floral traits have
   highly specialized pollination systems.
   2. We investigated this problem in the African milkweed Pachycarpus
   grandiflorus which has open flowers that produce copious amounts of
   exposed and concentrated nectar, yet is visited almost exclusively by
   spider-hunting wasps in the genus Hemipepsis.
   3. These wasps were the only visitors found to consistently carry
   pollinaria and a cage experiment showed that they are capable of
   successfully pollinating this plant. Furthermore, experimental
   hand-pollinations showed that P. grandiflorus is genetically
   self-incompatible and thus reliant on pollinators for seed set.
   4. We investigated the roles of chemical (nectar and floral scent) and
   spectral properties in the selective attraction of wasps and the
   filtering out of other potential flower visitors. Nectar palatability
   experiments showed that the nectar is unpalatable to honeybees but
   palatable to the wasps. Choice experiments conducted in the field and
   using a Y-maze in the laboratory showed that wasps are attracted
   primarily by scent rather than visual cues. Analysis of scent using Gas
   Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry showed that these inflorescences
   produce 36 different compounds, mostly monoterpenes and aliphatics.
   Analysis of spectral reflectance showed that flowers have similar
   colouring to the background vegetation.
   5. We conclude that P. grandiflorus is specialized for pollination by
   Hemipepsis wasps, and in the absence of morphological filters, achieves
   specialization through unpalatable nectar, cryptic colouring and scent
   as a selective pollinator attractant.
   6. This study demonstrates that plants whose flowers are not
   morphologically adapted to exclude particular floral visitors can
   achieve specialization through non-morphological filters.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering (Cornus florida L.) and kousa (C kousa Hance) dogwoods are
   ornamental trees valued for their four-season appeal, but also for their
   importance to retail and wholesale nurseries. The popularity of kousa
   dogwood has increased in recent years as a result of its resistance to
   dogwood anthracnose and powdery mildew as compared with flowering
   dogwood, which is typically susceptible to those diseases. This range of
   resistance allows the development of intra- and interspecific cultivars
   with multiple disease resistance or a combination of disease resistance
   and specific ornamental traits. Breeding requires controlled crosses
   that are usually done manually, which is a labor-intensive process.
   Cornus florida and C kousa have generally been found to be
   self-incompatible allowing for the breeding process to be made more
   efficient by not having to emasculate flowers. We have capitalized on
   the natural ability of honeybees and the self-incompatible nature of
   dogwood to perform self- and crosspollinations of flowering and kousa
   dogwood. Self-pollinations were conducted in 2006 and 2007 with C.
   florida `Appalachian Spring' and `Cherokee Brave' and with C. kousa
   `Blue Shadow' and Galilean (R). The flowering dogwood self-pollinations
   resulted in no seed production, whereas the kousa dogwood
   self-pollinations resulted in low seed production, indicating
   self-incompatibility. Intra- and interspecific crosses of flowering and
   kousa dogwood cultivars and breeding lines were conducted in 2006 to
   2008. Honeybees were effective in facilitating seed production for all
   intraspecific crosses conducted. Seedling phenotypes of putative intra-
   and interspecific hybrids are similar and practically indistinguishable,
   so dogwood-specific simple sequence repeats were used to verify a sample
   of the putative hybrids. The results demonstrated that honeybees were
   effective in performing controlled pollinations and that
   honeybee-mediated pollinations provide an alternative to time-consuming
   hand pollinations for flowering and kousa dogwood.}},

Title = {{Restoration of riverine inland sand dune complexes: implications for the
   conservation of wild bees}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1097-1105}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The evaluation of restoration measures is an important task of
   conservation biology. Inland sand dunes and dry, oligotrophic grasslands
   have become rare habitat types in large parts of Central Europe and
   their restoration and management is of major importance for the
   preservation of many endangered plant and insect species. Within such
   habitats, it is important to restore key ecosystem services, such as
   pollination networks. As wild bees are the most important pollinators in
   many ecosystems, they represent a suitable key group to evaluate
   restoration measures. Furthermore, the recent decline of many bee
   species and the potential ecological and economic consequences are
   currently topics of strong scientific interest.
   2. We studied the succession of bee communities in response to
   restoration measures of sand dunes and sand grasslands and compared
   these communities with those of old sand dune complexes.
   3. Our results show that wild bees respond rapidly to restoration
   measures indicated by a high species richness and abundance. The
   community structure of bees at restoration sites converged only slightly
   to those of the target sites. A higher similarity was found between bee
   communities at the restoration sites (sand dunes and grasslands),
   indicating that their close proximity was an important determinant of
   species overlap. Environmental factors such as the number of
   entomophilous plant species and moisture had a strong influence on wild
   bee species composition.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The restoration of inland sand dune
   complexes provides opportunities for colonization by a diverse wild bee
   community. Although it is difficult to establish a given target
   community, restoration measures gave rise to a high pollinator diversity
   and abundance, suggesting that community function can be re-established.}},

Abstract = {{Southern African grasslands harbour diverse plant communities, and
   recent studies have revealed remarkable plant-pollinator interactions in
   this biome. However, there has been no attempt to study community-wide
   patterns in breeding systems or plant-pollinator mutualisms. Here, we
   present the results of extensive field work on twenty-one wildflower
   species with large, showy flowers, belonging to a broad range of
   angiosperm families. Most of the plant species investigated were found
   to be self-incompatible and therefore completely dependent on
   pollinators. Based on over 250 h of field observations during which we
   recorded over 1000 individual insects, 368 of which were examined for
   pollen loads, we identified pollination systems involving, inter alia,
   bees and flies (both short- and long-tongued), wasps, butterflies,
   hawkmoths, beetles, and sunbirds. The most important pollinators of the
   wildflowers investigated in the community were long-tongued solitary
   bees. Several plant species appear to be dependent on a single or a few
   pollinator species, and few are true generalists. This high degree of
   specialisation indicates a well-structured pollination landscape,
   suggesting both a history of climatic and ecological stability and
   potential sensitivity to human disturbance. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by

Abstract = {{Within the South African Plectranthus species two specialized lines of
   corolla adaptations have evolved. Long-proboscid flies (Nemestrinidae)
   appear to have driven the development of Plectranthus species with long
   corolla tubes that are limited to the sub-continent. Plectranthus s.l.
   (including Coleus) species with sigmoid corollas are far more widespread
   and evidence presented here supports the hypothesis that this floral
   type has evolved as a response to melittophily. Thirty percent of
   southern African Plectranthus species have corolla tubes that are bent
   to some degree. Pollination of the following four labiate species with
   sigmoid corollas was Studied in detail: Plectranthus petiolaris, P.
   laxiflorus, P. calycinus and Pycnostachys urticifolia. The pollination
   of three other species was investigated to a lesser degree: Plectranthus
   spicatus, P. rehmannii and Aeollanthus parvifolius. Bee pollination is
   confirmed for P. laxiflorus and Py. urticifolia and is recorded here for
   the first time in P. petiolaris and P. calycinus. A new group of floral
   visitors comprising nemestrinid flies of the genus Prosoeca with
   moderately long proboscids is recorded for P. laxiflorus and P.
   calycinus, where the corolla tube shape allows visits by
   medium-proboscid floral visitors. The sigmoid corolla shape limits the
   type and size of insects that can access nectar and act as pollinators.
   Explanations for the existence and function of the sigmoid corolla shape
   are suggested. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Flower visitors that do not fit a perceived floral syndrome are often
   over-looked and deemed unimportant. In Tritoniopsis revoluta, an irid
   with a very long corolla tube conforming to the long proboscid fly
   pollination syndrome, we determine visitation rates of bees and long
   proboscid flies, as well as ascertain whether bees could be important
   pollen vectors in this system. We confirmed the presence of extremely
   long proboscid Prosoeca longipennis flies in one T revoluta population,
   but found that fly visitation was absent in most populations. Instead,
   we found that in the absence of flies, nectar wells LIP the corolla
   tubes and becomes accessible to Amegilla bees, which were the most
   frequent visitors to T revoluta at most sites and carried pollen,
   suggesting they could effect pollination. The highest bee visitation
   rates were in T revoluta populations with unusually short tubed plants,
   where nectar was more accessible than in plants with long corolla tubes.
   Short tubed populations with more bee activity had higher average sced
   set than long tubed populations, suggesting that bees might contribute
   significantly to fitness in this apparently long-proboscid fly
   pollinated plant. Although these results do not support the use of
   syndromes for predicting all of a flower's important pollinators, they

Abstract = {{Aloe marlothii and A. greatheadii var. davyana are two sympatric
   winter-flowering succulents that occur in the summer rainfall regions of
   northern and north-eastern South Africa. Both have flower
   characteristics that are strongly Suggestive of bird pollination,
   although their nectar differs in volume and concentration. We conducted
   pollinator exclusion experiments to determine the importance of birds
   and insects as pollinators of these Aloe species. For both species fruit
   set and the number of seeds per fruit were higher in control treatments
   (all pollinators) and lower in treatments that excluded all pollinators.
   The contribution of insect pollinators to fruit set in A. marlothii was
   low (3-4\%), like that of no pollinators (0-2\%) whilst that of all
   pollinators (14-19\%) was significantly higher, suggesting that
   generalist avian pollinators, which visited flowers in large numbers,
   are the most important pollinators. In A. greatheadii var. dayvana fruit
   set in the absence of pollinators was also very low (2-6\%), while the
   contribution to fruit set by insects (36-51\%) was similar to that of
   all pollinators (55-55\%), confirming the importance of honeybees to
   pollination. Clear understanding of both flower and nectar
   characteristics, and observations of flower visitors, are therefore
   required before an accurate prediction of pollinator type can be made.

Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{Most Aloe species have long-tubed orange-red flowers, and many of these
   have been shown to be pollinated by birds. A few Aloe species have
   relatively short-tubed whitish or cream flowers, and one of these
   species, Aloe inconspicua, has been shown to be pollinated by insects.
   Here we further document exclusive insect-pollination in Aloe minima and
   A. linearifolia, two short-tubed summer flowering aloes in the
   grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Despite sunbirds being
   present in the study area, only bee species were observed to visit and
   pollinate these two aloes. There was little difference in seed set
   between bird-excluded and open-pollinated treatments, indicating that
   bee visitors are effective as pollinators of these two species. In a few
   cases, a single visit by a bee was enough for Successful fertilization.
   Other floral traits, including UV reflectance, small quantities of
   concentrated nectar, and the presence of floral scent (associated with
   pollination by insects), strengthen the argument for evolutionary
   specialization for exclusive insect-pollination in certain species of

Abstract = {{Recent Studies indicate that short-billed birds which visit flowers
   opportunistically for nectar arc important pollinators of African plants
   and select for floral characteristics which are distinct from those
   found in sunbird-pollinated species. Here we report the existence of a
   pollination system involving opportunistic nectarivores in Kniphofia
   caulescens, a high altitude member of a genus previously considered to
   contain only sunbird- and insect-adapted pollination systems. Plants of
   K. caulescens set approximately twice as many fruits and produced more
   seeds per fruit when exposed to both bird and insect pollination than to
   just insect pollination. Controlled pollination experiments showed that
   the species is genetically self-incompatible and thus totally reliant on
   pollinator visits for seed set. Opportunistic nectar-feeding birds
   appear to be the most important pollinators of this plant. In
   particular, Drakensberg Siskins (Crithagra symonsi) and Yellow Canaries
   (Crithagra flaviventris) were the most frequent visitors and carried the
   highest pollen loads. The Malachite Sunbird (Nectarinia famosa),
   although often feeding on Kniphofia caulescens, carried very little
   pollen, presumably on account of its long bill which reduces contact
   between the floral anthers and its head feathers. Honey bees were also
   frequent flower visitors and made a secondary contribution to fruit set.
   Flowers of K. caulescens contained copious amounts (c. 30 mu l) of very
   dilute (c. 9\%) hexose-rich nectar which is consistent with the
   pollination syndrome found in plants pollinated by opportunistic avian
   nectarivores. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{For the first time in South Africa nocturnal rodent pollination was
   observed and photographed under natural conditions. In the Northern
   Cederberg area of the Western Cape field studies and experiments showed
   that flowers of Whiteheadia bifolia (Hycaninthaceae) are visited at
   night by rodents, mainly the Namaqua Rock Mouse Aethomys namaquensis.
   The mice were observed licking nectar while being dusted with pollen and
   touching the stigmas. No other visitors were observed during the day or
   night. W. bifolia pollen was found around the snouts and in the faeces
   of live-trapped mice, the latter likely as a result of grooming their
   fur, since they visited the flowers without eating or destroying them.
   W. bifolia has characters of the rodent pollination floral syndrome Such
   as visually inconspicuous, bowl-shaped flowers close to the ground, with
   stiff stamens as well as easily accessible, very Viscous nectar and a
   weak, slightly sourish-nutty scent. Furthermore, these findings support
   the hypothesis that pollination syndromes can be used to make testable
   predictions about floral trait evolution due to pollinator selection.

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that nectarivorous yeasts are an important
   third player in plant-pollinator mutualisms, but their distribution and
   ecological effects remain poorly known. Here we provide a survey of the
   frequency and abundance of yeasts in floral nectar from 40 taxonomically
   diverse South African plant species, test whether they affect nectar
   properties, and investigate associations between yeast incidence and
   pollinator type. Microscopical observations of nectar samples revealed
   that yeasts are widespread in floral nectar of South African species, as
   revealed by the high percentage of plants (51.3\%) and flowers (43.2\%)
   containing those microbes, and that when present, they can reach high
   densities (up to 3.6 x 10(6) yeast cells/mm(3) in Moraea graminicola).
   Further, a significant negative correlation was found between yeast
   density and sugar content (R-s=-0.463, P=0.039) and yeast density and
   nectar concentration (R-s=-0.470, P=0.037) in a Watsonia species.
   Interestingly, variation in yeast incidence among plant species was
   related to differences in pollinator type, in Such a way that the plant
   species pollinated by birds showed the highest proportion of plants and
   flowers with yeasts, while those visited only by Hymenoptera showed the
   lowest values. Our study confirms the ubiquity of nectarivorous yeasts
   in plant Communities and identifies novel ways of approaching the study
   of nectar characteristics and exciting new perspectives on the role of
   yeasts in plant-pollinator relationships. (C) 2009 SAAB. Published by

Abstract = {{To better understand the dynamics of bee populations in crops, we
   assessed the effect of landscape context and habitat type on bee
   communities in annual entomophilous crops in Europe. We quantified bee
   communities in five pairs of crop-country: buckwheat in Poland,
   cantaloupe in France, field beans in the UK, spring oilseed rape in
   Sweden, and strawberries in Germany. For each country, 7-10 study fields
   were sampled over a gradient of increasing proportion of semi-natural
   habitats in the surrounding landscape. The CORINE land cover
   classification was used to characterize the landscape over a 3 km radius
   around each study field and we used multivariate and regression analyses
   to quantify the impact of landscape features on bee abundance and
   diversity at the sub-generic taxonomic level. Neither overall wild bee
   abundance nor diversity, taken as the number of sub-genera. was
   significantly affected by the proportion of semi-natural habitat.
   Therefore, we used the most precise level of the CORINE classification
   to examine the possible links between specific landscape features and
   wild bee communities. Bee community composition fell into three distinct
   groups across Europe: group I included Poland, Germany, and Sweden,
   group 2 the UK, and group 3 France. Among all three groups, wild bee
   abundance and sub-generic diversity were affected by 17 landscape
   elements including some semi-natural habitats (e.g., transitional wood
   land-shrub), some urban habitats (e.g., sport and leisure facilities)
   and some crop habitats (e.g., non-irrigated arable land). Some bee taxa
   were positively affected by urban habitats only, others by semi-natural
   habitats only, and others by a combination of semi-natural, urban and
   crop habitats. Bee sub-genera favoured by urban and crop habitats were
   more resistant to landscape change than those favoured only by
   semi-natural habitats. In agroecosystems, the agricultural
   intensification defined as the loss of semi-natural habitats does not
   necessarily cause a decline in evenness at the local level, but can
   change community composition towards a bee fauna dominated by common
   taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen dispersal by animals varies extensively because of differences in
   pollinator visitation rates among plants, dissimilar pollination by the
   various pollinators that visit individual plants, and stochastic
   variation in deposition as an individual pollinator disperses a plant's
   pollen to subsequently visited recipient flowers. Such variation reduces
   expected female and male success if seed production decelerates with
   increasing pollen receipt, because less than average receipt diminishes
   mean seed production more than copious pollination increases it
   (Jensen's inequality). We report empirical studies of the nature and
   magnitude of pollen dispersal variance, which provide the basis for a
   numerical model of the consequences of dispersal for expected seed
   production. Model fitting revealed that dispersal of Brassica napus
   pollen by bumblebees and especially butterflies exhibited much more
   variation than is expected of a binomial process and was best modeled as
   a beta-binomial process with a constant mean. Overdispersion arose
   primarily during pollen dispersal by individual insects, since
   differences between individuals of the same pollinator type were
   limited. Our model revealed variance limitation as a previously
   unrecognized, substantial, and ubiquitous component of pollen limitation
   of seed production. Variance limitation should select for floral traits
   that increase pollinator visitation, reduce dispersal variance, or
   reduce the postpollination nonlinearities that cause Jensen's
   inequality.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{174}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{413-423}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Bayesian foraging in patchy environments requires that foragers have
   information about the distribution of resources among patches (prior
   information), either set by natural selection or learned from past
   experience. We test the hypothesis that bumblebee foragers can rapidly
   learn prior information from past experience in two very different
   experimental environments. In the high-variance environment (patches of
   low and high quality), stochastic optimality models predicted that
   finding rewards should sometimes sharply increase an optimal forager's
   tendency to stay in a patch (an incremental response), whereas in the
   uniform environment, finding rewards should always decrease the tendency
   to stay (a decremental response). We use Cox regression models to show
   that, in a matter of hours, bees learned to match both predicted
   responses, resulting in a reward intake rate that averaged 80\% of the
   predicted maximum. Following training in either environment, bees'
   adaptive behavior carried over to a common test environment, thus
   confirming the influence of memorized prior information. Although
   Bayesian foraging by learning is often presumed, this study is the first
   to clearly isolate the adaptive use of a learned prior expectation. More
   generally, it highlights the remarkable adaptive plasticity of an
   important generalist pollinator and agent of selection.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and late development of the flowers of the South-East
   Asian bee-pollinated palm Licuala peltata are described with special
   focus on the architecture of the unusual labyrinthine nectaries. The
   nectaries are derived from septal nectaries by extensive convolution of
   the carpel flank surfaces below the ovary throughout the inner floral
   base, thus also encompassing the inner surface of the corolla-androecium
   tube. A comparison with septal nectaries elsewhere in Arecaceae and with
   labyrinthine nectaries in other monocots shows that labyrinthine
   nectaries situated below the ovary, as described here, are not known
   from any other palms, but are similar to those of a few Bromeliaceae
   and, less strongly convoluted, some Haemodoraceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae.
   In addition, the substantial participation of parts other than the
   gynoecium in the nectary architecture of Licuala appears unique at the
   level of monocots. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical

Abstract = {{We describe a reproductive and population dynamic study of the total
   population of a Critically Endangered plant over 10 years, during which
   part of the population was protected from the main threat, feral
   ungulates. Linum cratericola (Linaceae) was first discovered in 1966 at
   two sites on Floreana Island, Galapagos. It has since disappeared from
   one site and survives in three groups of plants at the other, where it
   has been threatened with extinction by introduced ungulates and invasive
   plants. Population size, and growth rate and mortality of individual
   plants, have been monitored since 1997. The population appears highly
   responsive to changes in threat levels: the three plant groups increased
   rapidly following protection by fencing and ungulate control, but
   temporarily declined when feral goat pressure increased and during dry
   periods. Natural factors that may contribute to population limitation
   include dry years, grazing by native snails and competition from native
   vascular plants and cryptogams. Linum cratericola has a single flowering
   period per year and produces abundant seed with 28\% germination after
   scarification, but with no obvious adaptations for long-distance
   dispersal. Potential pollinators included the butterfly Leptotes
   parrhasioides, the hoverfly Toxomerus crockeri and the carpenter bee
   Xylocopa darwinii, all endemic to Galapagos. The continued survival of
   L. cratericola in the wild depends on effective protection from
   introduced herbivores and invasive plants. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society

Abstract = {{Six Ctenoplectra species are recorded from Southeast Asia and Taiwan.
   They are C. chalybea Smith, C. cornuta Gribodo, C. davidi Vachal, C.
   elsei Engel, C. sandakana sp. nov. and C. vagans Cockerell. Females of
   C. sandakana sp. nov. from North Borneo are similar to the mainland
   species C. chalybea, but differ mainly in the clypeal keel and the
   length of the antennal segments. The small blackish species, C. cornuta,
   is distributed in Myanmar, China and Taiwan and C. davidi is distributed
   in China, Russia and Taiwan; both species are seen at the flowers of
   Thladiantha. Ctenoplectra chalybea was collected from the Malay
   Peninsula, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam. Ctenoplectra apicalis Smith and
   C. kelloggi Cockerell are allied to C. chalybea; however, C. kelloggi is
   excluded from this study due to insufficient material. A key to the six
   known Ctenoplectra species is given. The large metallic species, C.
   chalybea and C. elsei, visit flowers of Momordica cochinchinensis
   (Lour.) Spreng. For the first time observations on the nest structures
   of C. chalybea and C. cornuta are presented. They choose remarkable
   places, such as artificial structures and buildings, for nest sites. The
   nest architecture prevents rain and direct sunlight from entering the
   nest. Bees used pre-existing holes or crevices in wood for nesting
   shelters and collected soil and appeared to mix it with some other
   substance to build nests. The cell lining materials and rubbing
   behaviors against the cell wall suggest that Ctenoplectra bees use
   floral oil mainly for cell lining materials.}},

Abstract = {{In the sexually deceptive orchid genus Ophrys, reproductive isolation is
   based on the specific attraction of males of a single pollinator species
   by mimicking the female species-specific sex pheromone. Changes in the
   odor composition can lead to hybridization and speciation by the
   attraction of a new pollinator that acts as an isolation barrier toward
   other sympatrically occurring Ophrys species. On Sardinia, we
   investigated the evolutionary origin of two sympatrically occurring
   endemic species, Ophrys chestermanii and O. normanii, which are both
   pollinated by males of the cuckoo bumblebee Bombus vestalis. Chemical
   and electrophysiological analyses of floral scent and genetic analyses
   with amplified fragment length polymorphisms and plastid-markers clearly
   showed that O. normanii is neither a hybrid nor a hybrid species. The
   two species evolved from different ancestors, viz. O. normanii from O.
   tenthredinifera and O. chestermanii from O. annae, and converged to the

Title = {{Pollination networks of oil-flowers: a tiny world within the smallest of

Abstract = {{In the Neotropics, most plants depend on animals for pollination.
   Solitary bees are the most important vectors, and among them members of
   the tribe Centridini depend on oil from flowers (mainly Malpighiaceae)
   to feed their larvae. This specialized relationship within `the smallest
   of all worlds' (a whole pollination network) could result in a `tiny
   world' different from the whole system. This `tiny world' would have
   higher nestedness, shorter path lengths, lower modularity and higher
   resilience if compared with the whole pollination network.
   In the present study, we contrasted a network of oil-flowers and their
   visitors from a Brazilian steppe ('caatinga') to whole pollination
   networks from all over the world.
   A network approach was used to measure network structure and, finally,
   to test fragility. The oil-flower network studied was more nested (NODF
   = 0 center dot 84, N = 0 center dot 96) than all of the whole
   pollination networks studied. Average path lengths in the two-mode
   network were shorter (one node, both for bee and plant one-mode network
   projections) and modularity was lower (M = 0 center dot 22 and four
   modules) than in all of the whole pollination networks. Extinctions had
   no or small effects on the network structure, with an average change in
   nestedness smaller than 2\% in most of the cases studied; and only two
   species caused coextinctions. The higher the degree of the removed
   species, the stronger the effect and the higher the probability of a
   decrease in nestedness.
   We conclude that the oil-flower subweb is more cohesive and resilient
   than whole pollination networks. Therefore, the Malpighiaceae have a
   robust pollination service in the Neotropics. Our findings reinforce the
   hypothesis that each ecological service is in fact a mosaic of different
   subservices with a hierarchical structure ('webs within webs').}},

Abstract = {{Four cultivars of each of three cucurbit species were used to examine
   the effects of pollen-load (i.e., the number of pollen grains deposited
   on the stigma of pistillate flowers) on fruit-set, seed-set, and
   germinability (i.e., germination percentage and germination rate) in
   four greenhouse experiments. Increasing pollen-load increased the number
   of fruit per plant in the four melon cultivars over two growing seasons,
   and in two non-parthenocarpic cucumbers, but had no effect on all four
   squash cultivars. In most cases, increasing pollen-load increased the
   number of fully-developed seeds, decreased the percentage of empty
   seeds, and tended to decrease mean seed weights. On average, melons
   produced 2.2 fruits per plant in the Winter, and only 0.9 fruits per
   plant in the Autumn. In contrast, melons produced 275 fully-developed
   seeds per fruit in the Autumn, but only 57 seeds in the Winter. Mean
   melon seed weight was higher in Autumn, and the sum of all seed yield
   component effects resulted a significantly higher seed yield per plant
   in the Autumn. Germinability of melon seeds from the Autumn season, and
   of squash seeds from the Winter season, were not significantly affected
   by pollen-load treatment. These data are contrary to the theory that
   microgametophyte competition has a positive effect on the vigour of the
   progeny. The lower germinability of melon seeds obtained by passive
   pollination (i.e., self-pollination in covered flowers) may be due to
   the fact that pollination without insect or human interference yielded
   only a few seeds per fruit, and, under such circumstances, there may be
   a survival advantage for slow and distributed germination.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of climate on the plant-pollinator communities in
   the West Indies. We constructed plots of 200 m x 5 m in two distinct
   habitats on the islands of Dominica, Grenada and Puerto Rico (total of
   six plots) and recorded visitors to all plant species in flower. In
   total we recorded 447 interactions among 144 plants and 226 pollinator
   species. Specifically we describe how rainfall and temperature affect
   proportional richness and importance of the different pollinator
   functional groups. We used three measures of pollinator importance:
   number of interactions, number of plant species visited and betweenness
   centrality. Overall rainfall explained most of the variation in
   pollinator richness and relative importance. Bird pollination tended to
   increase with rainfall, although not significantly, whereas insects were
   significantly negatively affected by rainfall. However, the response
   among insect groups was more complex: bees were strongly negatively
   affected by rainfall, whereas dipterans showed similar trends to birds.
   Bird, bee and dipteran variation along the climate gradient can be
   largely explained by their physiological capabilities to respond to
   rainfall and temperature, but the effect of climate on other insect
   pollinator groups was more obscure. This study contributes to the
   understanding of how climate may affect neotropical plant-pollinator
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Although there are many reasons to expect distinct pollinator types to
   differentially affect a plant's reproductive success, few studies have
   directly examined this question. Here, we contrast the impact of two
   kinds of pollinators on reproductive success via male and female
   functions in the Rocky Mountain columbine, Aquilegia coerulea. We set up
   pollinator exclusion treatments in each of three patches where Aquilegia
   plants were visited by either day pollinators (majority bumble bees), by
   evening pollinators (hawkmoths), or by both (control). Day pollinators
   collected pollen and groomed, whereas evening pollinators collected
   nectar but did not groom. Maternal parents, potential fathers and
   progeny arrays were genotyped at five microsatellite loci. We estimated
   female outcrossing rate and counted seeds to measure female reproductive
   success and used paternity analysis to determine male reproductive
   success. Our results document that bumble bees frequently moved pollen
   among patches of plants and that, unlike hawkmoths, pollen moved by
   bumble bees sired more outcrossed seeds when it remained within a patch
   as opposed to moving between patches. Pollinator type differentially
   affected the outcrossing rate but not seed set, the number of outcrossed
   seeds or overall male reproductive success. Multiple visits to a plant
   and more frequent visits by bumble bees could help to explain the lack
   of impact of pollinator type on overall reproductive success. The
   increase in selfing rate with hawkmoths likely resulted from the
   abundant pollen available in experimental flowers. Our findings
   highlighted a new type of pollinator interactions that can benefit a
   plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Eufriesea violacea (Blanchard) is a very seasonal euglossine species,
   more frequently found in the southern and southeastern regions of
   Brazil. A number of studies have revealed large variations in the
   abundance of males of this species present in Atlantic Forest remnants
   throughout both regions. In this paper, we report variations in the
   abundance of E. violacea males sampled in several forest patches of
   different sizes (ranging from 10 to 580 ha), and we propose that this
   species is possibly sensitive to the reduction in size of forest
   remnants. Surveys were carried out in nine forest remnants of Atlantic
   rainforest located in northern Parana State, southern Brazil. Male
   euglossine bees were collected with an entomological net when visiting
   scent-baits, between 10:00 am and 1:00 pm, from October to December of
   2001 and 2006. A total of 360 E. violacea males were captured in the
   nine forest fragments studied. The number of bees attracted to scent
   baits in each forest patch varied from zero to 261. A very high
   association (r = 0.993) was detected between the forest patch size and
   the visitation rate of E. violacea males at different sites, with the
   highest mean number of males visiting baits/sampling (43.5) being
   observed for bees from the largest forest remnant. Although alternative
   hypothesis should not be discharged for the decline in the abundance or
   absence of E. violacea in small forest patches, our results indicate
   that populations of this euglossine species need larger forest areas for
   existing.}},

Abstract = {{The role of biological diversity in maintaining ecosystem functioning is
   a central issue in ecology. Most studies on diversity-functioning
   relationships have focused on ecosystem and community levels, leaving
   the extension of those relationships to other organization levels, such
   as populations, as a challenging and unsolved issue. Empirical studies
   have shown links between pollinator diversity and plant fecundity,
   suggesting that a diversity-functioning relationship at the population
   level may occur in pollination systems. We theoretically explored the
   effect of pollinator diversity on plant reproduction. We found that low
   pollinator diversity is beneficial when the most abundant pollinators
   are the most effective. In contrast, when the most effective pollinators
   are not the most abundant, we found an optimal value of pollinator
   diversity at which plant fecundity is maximized. When we parametrized
   our model with real data, we obtained that an increase in pollinator
   diversity was beneficial for the reproduction of some plants whereas it
   was harmful for other plants, the outcome depending exclusively on the
   differences in effectiveness among pollinators. Consequently, our
   theoretical approach suggests that in pollination systems the
   diversity-function relationship may be explained as the consequence of
   the interaction between among-pollinator differences in effectiveness
   and frequency of interaction, without the need to invoke additional
   ecological mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to identify any potential adverse
   side effects of the use of seven microbiological control agents (MCAs)
   on the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L., in the context of combined use
   in integrated pest management (IPM). AQ10 (R) (Ampelomycesquisqualis),
   Binab-T-vector (R) (Hypocreaparapilulifera + T.atroviride; 1/1),
   Prestop-Mix (R) (Gliocladium catenulatum J1446), Serenade (R) (Bacillus
   subtilis QST713), Trianum-P (R) (Trichoderma harzianum T22), Botanigard
   (R) (Beauveria bassiana GHA) and Granupom (R) (Cydia pomonella
   granulovirus), comprising five biofungicides and two bioinsecticides,
   were investigated. Bumblebee workers were exposed under laboratory
   conditions to each MCA at its maximum field recommended concentration
   (MFRC) via three different routes of exposure: dermal contact and orally
   via either treated sugar water or pollen.
   RESULTS: The tested MCAs were found to be safe for workers of B.
   terrestris, with the exception of Botanigard (R) and Serenade (R).
   Exposure to Botanigard (R) via contact at its MFRC caused 92\% mortality
   after 11 weeks, while the 1/10 MFRC killed 46\% of exposed workers. For
   Serenade (R), topical contact and oral delivery via sugar water resulted
   in 88 and 100\% worker mortality respectively. With lower concentrations
   (11/2, 1/5 and 1/10 MFRC) the toxicity decreased, but the effect
   depended on the route of exposure. In addition to lethal effects, nests
   were also evaluated for sublethal effects after treatment with the seven
   MCAs at their respective MFRCs over 11 weeks. In these bioassays, only
   Botanigard (R) and Serenade (R) gave rise to a significant (P < 0.05)
   decrease in drone production. Sublethal effects on foraging behaviour
   were also evaluated, and only Botanigard at its MFRC delivered via
   treated sugar water induced negative effects.
   CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that most of the MCAs tested can be
   considered safe for use in combination with B. terrestris, based on the
   International Organisation for Biological Control of Noxious Animals and
   Plants (IOBC) classification. However, some can be harmful, such as the
   biofungicide Serenade (R) and the bioinsecticide Botanigard (R).
   Therefore, it is recommended that all should be tested before use in
   combination with pollinators. In this context, it is also advisable that
   these MCAs should be evaluated in more realistic field situations for
   the assessment of potentially deleterious effects on foraging behaviour.

Title = {{Effective Long-Distance Pollen Dispersal in Centaurea jacea}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: Agri-environment schemes play an increasingly important role
   for the conservation of rare plants in intensively managed agricultural
   landscapes. However, little is known about their effects on gene flow
   via pollen dispersal between populations of these species.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In a 2-year experiment, we observed
   effective pollen dispersal from source populations of Centaurea jacea in
   restored meadows, the most widespread Swiss agri-environment scheme, to
   potted plants in adjacent intensively managed meadows without other
   individuals of this species. Potted plants were put in replicated source
   populations at 25, 50, 100 m and where possible 200 m distance from
   these source populations. Pollen transfer among isolated plants was
   prevented by temporary bagging, such that only one isolated plant was
   accessible for flower visitors at any one time. Because C. jacea is
   self-incompatible, seed set in single-plant isolates indicated insect
   mediated effective pollen dispersal from the source population. Seed set
   was higher in source populations (35.7 +/- 4.4) than in isolates (4.8
   +/- 1.0). Seed set declined from 18.9\% of that in source populations at
   a distance of 25 m to 7.4\% at 200 m. At a distance of 200 m seed set
   was still significantly higher in selfed plants, indicating
   long-distance effective pollen dispersal up to 200 m. Analyses of
   covariance suggested that bees contributed more than flies to this
   long-distance pollen dispersal. We found evidence that pollen dispersal
   to single-plant isolates was positively affected by the diversity and
   flower abundance of neighboring plant species in the intensively managed
   meadow. Furthermore, the decline of the dispersal was less steep when
   the source population of C. jacea was large.
   Conclusions: We conclude that insect pollinators can effectively
   transfer pollen from source populations of C. jacea over at least 200 m,
   even when ``recipient populations'' consisted of single-plant isolates,
   suggesting that gene flow by pollen over this distance is very likely.
   Source population size and flowering environment surrounding recipient
   plants appear to be important factors affecting pollen dispersal in C.
   jacea. It is conceivable that most insect-pollinated plants in a network
   of restored sites within intensively managed grassland can form
   metapopulations, if distances between sites are of similar magnitude as
   tested here.}},

Abstract = {{Bees and wasps provide important ecosystem services such as pollination
   and biocontrol in crop-dominated landscapes, but surprisingly little
   information is available on hymenopteran communities in temperate forest
   ecosystems. Species richness and abundance of bees and wasps can be
   hypothesised to increase with plant diversity, structural complexity,
   and availability of food and nesting resources. By experimentally
   exposing standardised nesting sites, we examined abundance and species
   richness of cavity-nesting bees (pollinators), wasps (predators) and
   their associated parasitoids across a tree diversity gradient in a
   temperate deciduous forest habitat. In addition, spatial distribution of
   individuals and species across forest strata (canopy vs. understory) was
   tested. Abundance and species richness was high for predatory wasps, but
   generally low for pollinators. Species-rich forest stands supported
   increased abundance, but not species richness, of pollinators and
   predatory wasps, and also increased abundance and species richness of
   natural enemies. In addition, the forests showed a distinct spatial
   stratification in that abundance of bees, wasps and parasitoids as well
   as parasitism rates were higher in the canopy than understory. We
   conclude that particularly the canopy in temperate forest stands can
   serve as an important habitat for predatory wasp species and natural
   enemies, but not bee pollinators. Enhanced tree diversity was related to
   increased hymenopteran abundance, which is likely to be linked to an
   increase in nesting and food resources in mixed forest stands. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Floral morphology, particularly the angle of lip attachment to the
   column, has historically been the fundamental character used in
   establishing generic limits in subtribe Oncidiinae (Orchidaceae), but it
   has also been long recognized that reliance on this character alone has
   produced a highly artificial set of genera. In essence, lip/column
   relationships reflect syndromes associated with pollinator preferences;
   most genera of Oncidiinae as previously defined have consisted of a
   single floral type. Here, the degree to which this has influenced
   generic delimitation in Brazilian members of the largest genus of
   Oncidiinae, Oncidium, which previous molecular (DNA) studies have
   demonstrated to be polyphyletic, is evaluated.
   Phylogenetic analyses of the following multiple DNA regions were used:
   the plastid psbA-trnH intergenic spacer, matK exon and two regions of
   ycf1 exon and nuclear ribosomal DNA, comprised of the two internal
   transcribed spacers, ITS1 and ITS2, and the 5 center dot 8S gene.
   Results from all regions analysed separately indicated highly similar
   relationships, so a combined matrix was analysed.
   Nearly all species groups of Brazilian Oncidium are only distantly
   related to the type species of the genus, O. altissimum, from the
   Caribbean. There are two exceptions to this geographical rule: O. baueri
   is related to the type group and O. orthostates, an isolated species
   that lacks the defining tabula infrastigmata of Oncidium, is not
   exclusively related to any previously described genus in the subtribe.
   Several well-supported subclades can be observed in these results, but
   they do not correspond well to sections of Oncidium as previously
   circumscribed or to segregate genera as defined by several recent
   authors. In spite of their floral differences, these groups of Oncidium,
   formerly treated as O. sections Barbata, Concoloria pro parte, Crispa,
   Ranifera, Rhinocerotes, Rostrata (only O. venustum), Synsepala,
   Verrucituberculata pro parte and Waluewa, form a well-supported clade
   with Gomesa (including Rodrigueziella and Rodrigueziopsis) embedded in
   it. Two often recognized segregate genera, Baptistonia and Ornithophora,
   and the recently described Carriella are also embedded within the
   Brazilian clade. The level of variation within major subclades of the
   Gomesa clade is low and similar to that observed within other genera of
   Oncidiinae.
   Convergence on a stereotypical syndrome of floral traits associated with
   pollination by oil-collecting bees has resulted in these characters not
   being reliable for producing monophyletic taxa, and the genus Oncidium,
   defined by these characters, is grossly polyphyletic. Vegetative and a
   few floral/inflorescence characters link these taxa with a mainly
   Brazilian distribution, and they were all transferred to Gomesa on this
   basis rather than separated from Gomesa based on their floral
   differences, which we hypothesize to be simple shifts in pollination
   strategies. Other authors have described a large number of new genera
   for these former members of Oncidium, but most of these are not
   supported by the results presented here (i.e. they are not
   monophyletic). A new genus, Nohawilliamsia, is described for O.
   orthostates because it does not fit in any currently recognized genus
   and is only distantly related to any other member of Oncidiinae.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen fates strongly influence mating success in plants but are
   difficult to quantify. By promoting foraging constancy in pollinators,
   floral rewards such as nectar may enhance the overall efficiency of
   pollen transfer. However, this can also lead to high levels of
   geitonogamy. Pollen fates were studied in Acrolophia cochlearis, a
   member of a terrestrial epidendroid orchid genus that includes both
   rewarding and deceptive species.
   Pollinator observations were conducted. Pollen transfer efficiency
   (PTE), the proportion of removed pollinia deposited on stigmas, was
   measured in a large population at regular intervals throughout the
   5-month flowering season. The level of cross-pollination in two
   populations was estimated from the percentage of seeds with embryos in
   naturally pollinated fruits.
   Acrolophia cochlearis (and a congener A. micrantha) produce minute but
   concentrated nectar rewards. Observations showed that A. cochlearis is
   pollinated exclusively by a solitary bee species, Colletes claripes.
   Although both sexes visited flowers, only males carried pollinaria.
   Overall levels of pollination and PTE of the rewarding A. cochlearis
   were much higher than in a deceptive congener, A. capensis. Seeds
   resulting from self-fertilization had a significantly lower probability
   of containing viable embryos than did those from cross-fertilization.
   This dichotomy in fruit quality was used to estimate that
   cross-pollination occurred in approx. 66 \% of A. cochlearis flowers in
   a large dense population and approx. 10 \% in a small sparse population.
   Traits of A. cochlearis that limit geitonogamy include pollinarium
   reconfiguration that exceeds the visit time of pollinators and rapid
   flower senescence following visitation.
   Presence of a nectar reward in Acrolophia cochlearis results in high
   levels of PTE. It is estimated that approx. 33-90 \% of fruits in
   natural populations arise from self-pollination in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Exclusion experiments were used to assess the effect of different
   pollinator groups on outcrossing and seed production in Metrosideros
   excelsa. The main study site was Little Barrier Island, New Zealand
   where indigenous bird and native solitary bees are the main flower
   visitors. Our results showed that native birds were more important
   pollinators of M. excelsa than native bees. Seed production was much
   higher in open pollination than in two exclusion experiments where
   either birds were excluded and native bees only had access to flowers,
   or where all pollinators had been excluded. The number of fertile seeds
   per capsule was 45\% higher after open pollination than in treatments
   with bee visitation only and 28\% higher than in treatments where all
   flower visitors were excluded. Estimated outcrossing rates were
   significantly higher (t(m) = 0.71) for open pollination in the upper
   canopy (> 4 m above-ground level) where bird visitation is presumed to
   be more frequent than for a treatment with native bee access only (t(m)
   = 0.40). Our results also suggest that a large proportion of seeds
   (66\%) arise from autonomous self-pollination when all pollinators are
   excluded. In four trees of a modified mainland population with
   predominantly introduced birds and a mixture of introduced and native
   bees there was no decrease in seed production for the treatment allowing
   bee access only, indicating that - in contrast to native bees -
   honeybees may be more efficient pollinators of M. excelsa. Observation
   of the foraging behaviour of both groups of bees showed that native bees
   contact the stigma of flowers less frequently than honeybees. This is
   likely to be a consequence of their smaller body size relative to
   honeybees.}},

Abstract = {{Cross- and self-fertilization in angiosperms are regulated by several
   factors, and a knowledge of the mechanism and time of spontaneous
   self-pollination offers opportunities for a better understanding of the
   evolution of mating systems and floral traits. The floral biology of
   five species of Gentianaceae found in high-altitude neotropical
   grassland is presented, with emphasis on the mechanisms that promote
   spontaneous self-pollination. A presumed floral Batesian mimicry system
   is suggested between the rare and rewardless Zygostigma australe and
   Calydorea campestris, a species of Iridaceae with pollen-flowers,
   pollinated by syrphids and bees. The floral morphology of the other four
   gentian species points to three different pollination syndromes:
   melittophily, phalaenophily and ornithophily. However, with the
   exception of the nocturnal Helia oblongifolia, flowers are nectarless
   and appear to exhibit non-model deceptive mechanisms, providing similar
   floral cues to some sympatric rewarding species with the same syndrome.
   The similar mechanism of spontaneous self-pollination in Calolisianthus
   pedunculatus, Calolisianthus pendulus and H. oblongifolia (Helieae) is
   based on the stigmatic movements towards the anthers. Selfing is
   promoted by movements of the style/stigma and of the corolla in Deianira
   nervosa and Z. australe (Chironieae), respectively. The movements of
   stamens, style and stigma during anthesis seem to be the most common
   method of spontaneous self-pollination in angiosperms. It is suggested
   that the evolution of delayed spontaneous self-pollination would be more
   expected in those taxa with dichogamous flowers associated with
   herkogamy. Such a characteristic is frequent in long-lived flowers of
   certain groups of Asteridae, which comprise most documented cases of
   autonomous selfing. Thus, the presence of dichogamy associated with
   herkogamy (which supposedly evolved as a result of selection to promote
   both separation of male and female functions and the efficient transfer
   of cross pollen) may be the first step in the adaptive evolution of
   delayed selfing to provide reproductive assurance. (C) 2009 The Linnean

Abstract = {{There is a severe shortage of knowledge of bee biogeography. Some former
   studies have highlighted a link between bee diversity and xeric
   ecosystems, but we know practically nothing of the macro-ecological
   factors driving bee diversity. The present study aims to analyse the
   main macro-ecological factors driving bee species-richness in the
   Saharan region. Our dataset includes 25,000+ records for localities in
   Africa, between 37 degrees and 10 degrees N. Maps and GIS were used to
   get a first overview of the distribution of the Studied taxa. Partial
   least squares analysis (PLS) was used to study the impact of a set of
   ecological factors on the bee species richness (SR). The mapping
   highlighted the clustering of the highest bee SR Values in some parts of
   the Saharan area (e.g. Maghreb, western Africa). In Central Sahara,
   there is an obvious topological coincidence of the high SR, the local
   mountain chains and the inland waters. The PLS helped to quantify the
   relationships between bee SIR and a set of eco-climatic variables. It
   also highlighted a residual variance not explained by the considered
   descriptors. Our results recover the tight link between bee SR and xeric
   ecosystems. The), also Suggest that, within these ecosystems, bee SR is
   driven by an optimum of the energy-water balance (on which adjustment is
   allowed by the above gradients).}},

Abstract = {{It is widely agreed that in many parts of the world some bumblebee
   (Bombus) species have declined, and that this has often been driven by
   land-use changes that cause reductions in the abundance of food plants.
   There is much less agreement about how changes in food plants affect
   some bumblebee species more than others. We sought to identify which
   species' characteristics are generally associated with the relative
   winners and losers by comparing the 3 independent bumblebee faunas from
   parts of Britain, Canada, and China. Using available survey data, we
   assessed species characteristics, including competition with congeners,
   climatic specialization, proximity to climatic range edge, food
   specialization, phenology, body size, and range size. Results of our
   meta-analysis of correlations showed support for the hypotheses that
   decline susceptibility is generally greater for species that have
   greater climatic specialization, for species in areas where they occur
   closest to the edges of their climatic ranges, and for species that have
   queens that become active later in the year. The latter characteristic
   may render a species at a particular disadvantage when they have long
   colony cycles if there are losses of food plants in mid to late colony
   development.}},

Abstract = {{Community and biogeographic surveys often conclude that plant-pollinator
   interactions are highly generalized. Thus, a central implication of the
   pollination syndrome concept, that. oral trait evolution occurs
   primarily via specialized interactions of plants with their pollinators,
   has been questioned. However, broad surveys may not distinguish whether
   flower visitors are actual pollen vectors and hence lack power to assess
   the relationship between syndrome traits and the pollinators responsible
   for their evolution. Here we address whether the. oral traits of three
   closely related hermaphroditic Silene spp. native to eastern North
   America (S. caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata) correspond to
   predicted specialized pollination based on. oral differences among the
   three species and the congruence of these. oral features with recognized
   pollination syndromes. A nocturnal/diurnal pollinator exclusion
   experiment demonstrated that all three Silene spp. have diurnal
   pollinators, and only S. stellata has nocturnal pollinators. Multiyear
   studies of visitation rates demonstrated that large bees, hummingbirds,
   and nocturnal moths were the most frequent pollinators of S.
   caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata, respectively. Estimates of
   pollen grains deposited and removed per visit generally corroborated the
   visitation rate results for all three species. However, the relatively
   infrequent diurnal hawkmoth pollinators of S. caroliniana were equally
   effective and more efficient than the most frequent large bee visitors.
   Pollinator importance (visitation 3 deposition) of each of the animal
   visitors to each species was estimated and demonstrated that in most
   years large bees and nocturnal moths were the most important pollinators
   of S. caroliniana and S. stellata, respectively. By quantifying
   comprehensive aspects of the pollination process we determined that S.
   virginica and S. stellata were specialized on hummingbirds and nocturnal
   moths, respectively, and S. caroliniana was the least specialized with
   diurnal hawkmoth and large bee pollinators. Compared across the Silene
   species, divergent. oral character states are consistent with increasing
   the attraction and/or pollen transfer efficiency of their respective
   major pollinators, which suggests that the pollinators are past and/or
   contemporary selective agents for. oral trait evolution in these three
   Silene species. We conclude that the pollination syndrome concept allows
   us to effectively relate the functional significance of. oral morphology
   to the major pollinators of these Silene species.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebee species, Bombus, is an invaluable natural resource for
   greenhouse pollination. Low levels of genetic variation of Bombus m-dens
   have been reported in a previous mitochondrial (mt) gene study. In this
   study, we sequenced the complete internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of
   the nuclear rDNA obtained from 100 B. ardens individuals collected from
   several Korean localities, in an effort to assess its usefulness in
   characterizing the genetic diversity and relationships among populations
   of B. ardens. The ITS2 sequences of B. m-dens were shown to be longest
   among known insects, ranging in size from 1,971 - 1,984 bp. The
   sequences harbor four duplicated repeats-similar to 27 bp repeats,
   similar to 20 bp repeats, similar to 33 bp repeats, and similar to 34 bp
   repeats-which have never before been reported in other insect ITS2 rDNA
   The maximum sequence divergence of 1.01\% among 96 sequence types
   confirmed the applicability of this molecule to the Study of
   intraspecific variation, revealing higher sequence variation as compared
   to the previously studied mt COT gene. Overall, a very high per
   generation migration ratio (Nm = 5.83 similar to infinite) and a very
   low level of genetic fixation (F-ST = 0 - 0.08) were noted to exist
   among populations of B. ardens. The high estimation of gene flow among
   most populations-in particular, between the remote island Ulleungdo and
   several inland populations-suggest that historical events may be more
   responsible for the contemporary population structure of B. ardens. The
   finding of the lowest genetic diversity (pi) in the population on
   Ulleungdo Island (pi = 0.007434) may be reflective of a relatively small
   population size and the geographical isolation of the population as
   compared with other inland populations.}},

Abstract = {{Allodapine bees present particular problems for taxonomy due to a high
   level of morphological conservatism in adults, even between genera.
   However, this tribe of bees also presents a unique opportunity to
   explore the evolution of social parasitism because of the comparatively
   large number of origins of socially parasitic species. Morphological
   differences presented here, along with DNA sequence data and molecular
   phylogenetic analyses, indicate a much larger number of Australian
   social parasite species in the genus Inquilina than previously
   anticipated, and suggest that the final number of socially parasitic
   species may be considerable. We describe five new species and present
   sequence data that will help elucidate the delineation of further new
   species. Inquilina provides a unique opportunity to study the evolution
   of social parasitism in social insects, but further studies will need to
   encompass both population genetic and phylogenetic approaches.}},

Title = {{Responses of invertebrate trophic level, feeding guild and body size to
   the management of improved grassland field margins}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{920-929}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe
   often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and
   silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of
   these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community
   combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland
   invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be
   used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally
   diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees
   and spiders).
   2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of
   management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant
   community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and
   sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As
   many of these management practices are common to grassland systems
   throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is
   important for the maintenance of biodiversity.
   3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting
   increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic
   levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In
   all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively
   correlated with measures of plant species richness.
   4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively
   weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the
   continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward
   architecture or plant species richness.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the
   remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland
   management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting
   native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with
   a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes,
   promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By
   increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also
   increased (by c. 60\% across the range of sward architectural measures
   seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic
   levels, such as birds and mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the role of unmanaged arthropod flower visitors as crop
   pollinators is critical if robust and reliable long-term alternatives
   are to be found for honey bee pollination. However, data on pollinator
   assemblages can be scant. Field observation of crop flower visitors is a
   common data collection technique but it can be inadequate for species
   identification and is labour-intensive if used across many sites.
   Trapping may reduce this problem, but trap performance and sampling
   consistency over long distances (sites separated by > 100 km) are rarely
   examined. Window traps were designed to collect flower-visiting
   arthropods from peak-flowering onion (Allium cepa) and pak choi
   (Brassica rapa var. chinensis) fields across several regions throughout
   New Zealand. Trap efficacy was evaluated by comparing trapped samples
   with observations of flower visiting arthropods during the same trapping
   period, from dawn (6:00 to 7:00 hours) through to dusk (20:00-21:00
   hours) at the same locations. Similar types of larger arthropods (length
   >= 3 mm) were observed and trapped within both crops, with the
   hymenopteran genera Apidae, Colletidae and Halictidae and the dipteran
   families Syrphidae, Calliphoridae, Anthomyiidae, Stratiomyidae,
   Sarcophagidae, Bibionidae, Tachinidae and Muscidae the most commonly
   recorded. The total counts of these taxa across fields were strongly
   correlated between the two methods; however, the ratio of trapped to
   observed individuals could vary greatly between taxa. Trapping allowed
   more arthropods to be identified to the species level and also helped
   record more small arthropods (body length < 3 mm) when compared with
   observation. Window traps can be effective for assessing the relative
   diversity of flower visitor assemblages and the abundance of specific
   taxa in specific cropping systems at the regional scale, but variation
   in trap efficiency between arthropod taxa must be assessed for a true
   measure of assemblage composition.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F. (Hymenoptera:
   Megachilidae), is widely used as a pollinator for production of alfalfa,
   Medicago sativa L., seed, and populations of these bees can be
   maintained by alfalfa seed growers or can be purchased from mostly
   Canadian bee providers. M. rotundata raised in Canada have higher
   survival rates during the incubation that occurs after winter storage
   than do bees produced in the northwestern United States, but no reason
   has been found for this difference. We investigated whether storing
   immature M. rotundata for various time periods at a warm temperature (16
   degrees C) before winter or allowing them to remain unmanaged at ambient
   temperatures affects physiological aspects of prepupae during the winter
   as well as the survival and longevity of adult bees after spring or
   summer incubation. Our results show that the timing of the onset of
   winter storage and incubation does affect prepupal weights, prepupal
   lipid and water contents, adult emergence, and adult female longevity.
   Winter storage of prepupae in November or December with a late June
   incubation resulted in heavier adults that emerged more readily than
   bees incubated in late May. However, adult females incubated in May
   thrived longer than June-incubated bees if fed a honey-water diet. Thus,
   some prewinter management regimes for M. rotundata commercial stocks may
   be more effective than others for achieving optimal adult emergence
   synchrony, as well as adult survival and longevity for pollination of a
   summer crop.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers adapted for hummingbird pollination are typically red. This
   correlation is usually explained by the assertion that nectar- or
   pollen-stealing bees are ``blind{''} to red flowers. However, laboratory
   studies have shown that bees are capable of locating artificial red
   flowers and often show no innate preference for blue over red. We
   hypothesised that these findings might be artefacts of the simplified
   laboratory environment. Using bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) that had
   been trained to visit red and blue artificial flowers, we tested whether
   colour preference was influenced by complexity of the background on
   which they were foraging. Many bees were indifferent to flower colour
   when tested using a uniform green background like those commonly used in
   laboratory studies, but all bees showed strong colour preferences
   (usually for blue) when flowers were presented against a photograph of
   real foliage. Overall, preference for blue flowers was significantly
   greater on the more realistic, complex background. These results support
   the notion that the red of ``hummingbird syndrome{''} flowers can
   function to reduce bee visits despite the ability of bees to detect red
   and highlight the need to consider context when drawing inferences about
   pollinator preferences from laboratory data.}},

Abstract = {{It is hypothesized that two main factors drive the foraging patterns of
   native and exotic species: food resource availability and habitat
   composition. These factors are particularly relevant for native bees and
   exotic honeybees, essential crop pollinators that are sensitive to
   floral resources and habitat management, and that have recently
   exhibited alarming population declines. Mechanisms driving native and
   exotic bee foraging patterns may critically depend on floral resource
   availability and habitat composition, yet the impacts of these factors
   on bee foraging have never been simultaneously analyzed. In a coffee
   producing region in southern Mexico, we investigated the influence of
   coffee floral resource levels and habitat management on native and
   exotic bee foraging. We measured the amount of flowering coffee
   available at multiple spatial scales within two distinct agroforestry
   habitat types (high-shade and low-shade coffee) and recorded visits to
   coffee flowers, documenting bee species, visit duration and visit
   frequency. We observed a significantly greater number of visits in
   high-shade coffee habitats than in low-shade coffee habitats for both
   native and exotic bees. In high-shade coffee habitats, native solitary
   bee and native social bee visitation decreased significantly in response
   to increasing floral resource availability, exhibiting a `dilution
   effect' at the smallest spatial scale. In contrast, in low-shade coffee
   habitats, Africanized honeybees exhibited a `concentration effect',
   increasing visitation significantly in response to increasing floral
   resource availability at the largest spatial scale. This study is the
   first to show that foraging patterns of native bees and exotic honeybees
   contrast in response to floral resource level and scale and that this
   response is mediated by the vegetation management of the local habitat.}},

Abstract = {{In Daucus carota L. (Apiaceae) the florets comprising the central
   umbellet of inflorescences are usually pink or dark purple, presenting a
   marked contrast to the surrounding umbellets, which are generally white.
   The number of dark florets varies, and some inflorescences have no dark
   florets. It has been proposed that the dark florets function as an
   insect mimic, and in so doing serve to attract insects to the flower. In
   contrast, other authors, Darwin included, suggest that they are
   functionally redundant. The present study examined whether the dark
   florets attract insects, and also whether this effect can be replicated
   by replacing these florets with an insect. At the study site in Portugal
   the predominant insect visitor was the beetle Anthrenus verbasci L.
   (Dermestidae), which is similar in size and shape to the dark florets.
   Large inflorescences and those with more dark florets attracted more
   beetles than small inflorescences and those with fewer or no dark
   florets. Inflorescences with the dark florets removed attracted fewer
   beetles visitors compared with intact inflorescences. Inflorescences in
   which the dark florets were replaced with one or a cluster of five dead,
   freeze-killed A. verbasci attracted more beetles than inflorescences
   from which the dark florets had been removed. Replacement of the dark
   florets with a relatively large Meloid beetle resulted in the attraction
   of markedly fewer A. verbasci. We conclude that the dark florets can act
   as an insect attractant for some insect groups by acting as an insect
   mimic, and that they are adaptive, in contrast to the speculations of
   Darwin.}},

Abstract = {{Cyrtopodium punctatum (Linnaeus) Lindley is an endangered epiphytic
   orchid restricted in the USA to southern Florida. This species has been
   extensively collected from the wild since the early 1900s, and today
   only a few plants remain in protected areas. As part of a conservation
   plan, a reproductive biology study was conducted to better understand
   the ecology of this species in Florida. Cyrtopodium punctatum relies on
   a deceit pollination system using aromatic compounds to attract
   pollinators. Nine aromatic compounds were identified as components of
   the fragrance of C. punctatum inflorescences, including two compounds
   that are known to be Euglossine bee attractants. However, this group of
   bees is not native to Florida. Of the four bee species observed to visit
   C. punctatum flowers in the present study, carpenter bees (Xylocopa
   spp.) are likely to be the main pollinators. Pollination experiments
   demonstrated that C. puntatum is self-compatible, but requires a
   pollinator and thus does not exhibit spontaneous autogamy. In addition,
   the rates of fruit set were significantly higher for flowers that were
   outcrossed (xenogamy) than for those that were self-crossed. Thus, the
   species has evolved a degree of incompatibility. Examples of natural
   pollination and fruit set were observed during the present study
   (2007-2008), but the rates of reproduction were modest as a consequence
   of the low plant numbers and possible changes in insect densities as a
   result of anthropogenic influences.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean orchid Anacamptis papilionacea, despite showing a
   typical food-deceptive floral display, has also been reported to
   frequently attract male pollinators, suggesting a potentiality for
   sexual attraction. In a survey from a southern Italian population of A.
   papilionacea and their hybrids with Anacamptis morio, we collected 37
   pollinators belonging to five bee species carrying 126 orchid pollinia.
   The main pollinator of A. papilionacea was Anthophora crinipes male
   (48.6\%), but the number of females was not negligible (22.9\%). We also
   found pollinator sharing between the hybrid and the parental species.
   Our findings confirm that, contrary to other food-deceptive species, A.
   papilionacea mainly attracts male insects, but also that, in contrast to
   sexually deceptive species, this attraction is not specific. We suggest
   that A. papilionacea adopts a complex mix of food and sexually deceptive
   pollination and could represent a helpful model for studying the
   transition between different pollination strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The life-history characteristics of Lycoris sanguinea Maxim., a bulbous
   perennial of the Amaryllidaceae, are described here. Its geographical
   range is in the warm-temperate to cool-temperate zone of Honshu, Shikoku
   and Kyushu, Japan, extending further to the Korean Peninsula and China.
   Its growth form and seasonality are very unique, that is, the productive
   and reproductive phases are separate, which has been observed in other
   Lycoris species as well. In late March to mid-April for approximately 2
   months, only radical leaves appear above ground; these leaves wither and
   disappear in late April to early May when the canopy of the deciduous
   trees casts heavy shade on the ground layer; then, in mid- to late-July
   when the forest floor becomes even darker, only scapes appear above
   ground, with two to six orange-red flowers borne on the umbels,
   occasionally forming large clumps here and there on the forest floor.
   Lycoris sanguinea is a typical insect-pollinated polycarpic perennial
   that is pollinated by small bees, such as Amegilla florae, and small
   butterflies, such as Thymelicus leoninus leoninus and Thymelicus
   sylvaticus sylvaticus. The seed output per plant is not very high, and
   6-20 black spherical seeds, each approximately 6 mm in size, are
   produced.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of hymenopteran populations especially that of ecologically
   and economically important pollinators and parasitoids, has become a
   major topic for empirical and theoretical studies. Complementary sex
   determination (CSD) in Hymenoptera may impose a substantial genetic load
   through the production of inviable or sterile diploid males. Modelling
   and laboratory studies have indicated that this genetic load may trigger
   a `diploid male vortex' leading to rapid extinction of populations.
   Here we take a broader theoretical approach to analyze why populations
   exhibiting CSD persist in nature, even if they contain large proportions
   of homozygous diploid individuals. Using an individual-based model of
   spatially structured hymenopteran populations, we show that (i)
   inviability or reduced fertility of homozygous individuals, (ii)
   female-biased sex ratio, and (iii) strong intra-specific competition can
   mitigate the negative influence of CSD on population persistence and
   that (iv) already extremely low dispersal rates will result in long term
   survival. These findings underline the importance of life history traits
   for population survival and demonstrate that rather specific conditions
   must be met to initiate the `diploid male vortex'. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-39}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Most research on the widespread phenomenon of nectar robbing has focused
   on the effect of the nectar robbers' behaviour on host-plant fitness.
   However, attention also needs be paid to the characteristics of host
   plants, which can potentially influence the consequences of nectar
   robbing as well. A system of three sympatric Corydalis species sharing
   the same nectar-robbing bumble-bee was therefore studied over 3 years in
   order to investigate the effect of nectar robbing on host reproductive
   fitness.
   Three perennial species of Corydalis were studied in the Shennongjia
   Mountain area, central China. Observations were conducted on visitor
   behaviour and visitation frequencies of nectar-robbers and legitimate
   pollinators.
   The results indicated that the effect of nectar robbing by Bombus
   pyrosoma varied among species, and the three species had different
   mating systems. Seed set was thus influenced differentially: there was
   no effect on seed set of the predominantly selfing C. tomentella; for
   the facultative outcrossing C. incisa, nectar robbing by B. pyrosoma had
   a positive effect; and nectar robbing had a significant negative effect
   on the seed set of outcrossing C. ternatifolia.
   A hypothesis is proposed that the type of host-plant mating system could
   influence the consequences of nectar robbing on host reproductive
   fitness.}},

Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-56}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The Marantaceae (550 spp.) is the most derived family in the order
   Zingiberales and exhibits a complex explosive pollination mechanism. To
   understand the evolutionary significance of this unique process of
   pollen transfer, comparative morphological and ecological studies were
   conducted in Gabon.
   During a total stay of 11 months, 31 species of Marantaceae were
   investigated at different sites in Gabon. The study included analyses of
   floral diversity, observations on the pollinator spectrum as well as
   ecological measurements (e.g. nectar sugar concentration and volume).
   Analyses reveal five flower types based on flower size and pigmentation,
   spatial arrangement of the floral tube and presence/absence of nectar
   guides and conspicuous outer staminodes. Each type is associated with a
   specific functional pollinator group leading to the description of
   distinct pollination syndromes. The `small (horizontal)' flowers are
   predominantly pollinated by small bees (Thrinchostoma spp., Allodapula
   ornaticeps), the `large (horizontal)' and `medium-sized (horizontal)'
   flowers by medium-sized bees (Amegilla vivida, Thrinchostoma bicometes),
   the `locked (horizontal)' flowers by large bees (Xylocopa nigrita, X.
   varipes) and the `(large) vertical' flowers by sunbirds.
   The longevity of Marantaceae individuals and the omnipresence of their
   pollinators allowed the specialization to a given functional pollinator
   group. Intermediate ecological values, however, make occasional
   pollinator overlaps possible, indicating potential pathways of
   pollinator shifts. Similar radiation tendencies observed on other
   continents hint at similar selective pressures and evolutionary
   constraints.}},

Abstract = {{A commercialized pollinator introduced from Europe, Bombus terrestris,

   produced triploid workers. The inbreeding coefficient of diploid workers
   representing individual colonies was significantly positive (F-IS =
   0.048) in a site where triploids were found. Genetic diversity in the
   sites was as high as that in native regions in Europe, and genetic
   differentiation between the sites was low (F-ST = 0.006). The maximum
   distance between sampling locations of full-sib worker pairs indicated
   that the radius of a foraging range was at least 782 m. The estimates of

Abstract = {{Although the alien Impatiens glandulifera successfully invades riparian
   habitats and is visited by native insects, knowledge of its impact on
   native bees is limited. We assessed pollinator abundance in field sites
   where I. glandulifera was absent, present or had been experimentally
   removed. We measured insect visitation to flowers of potted native
   plants and to I. glandulifera. Bombus spp. comprised the highest
   proportion of visitors in invaded sites, whereas solitary bees made up
   the highest proportion in sites where I. glandulifera was removed. More
   bees, especially medium- and long-tongued Bombus spp. ( B. pascuorum and
   B. hortorum), foraged on I. glandulifera than the native plant species (
   possibly because the alien was more abundant). We detected no impact of
   invasion on standardised pollinator abundance, B. pascuorum abundance,
   nor functional insect diversity, which may be due to variable climatic
   conditions. We suggest that future studies focus on impacts on rare or
   specialised pollinator taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is hypothesized to play a major role in animal foraging,
   particularly in pollinators. In general, species with larger bodies
   forage over greater distances. Studies have found support for this body
   size-foraging range hypothesis across a wide variety of pollinator
   species, but have not investigated the possibility that this effect also
   applies within a pollinator species. We trained foragers of the
   stingless bee Melipona mandacaia to feeders in their native habitat
   under natural conditions, and found that larger foragers forage at and
   recruit to significantly greater distances than smaller foragers. The
   maximum foraging and recruitment distances are significantly greater (
   by 24\% and 48\% respectively) for larger as compared to smaller
   foragers. We also provide the first direct evidence that stingless bees
   can forage in their native habitat at distances up to 2.1 km and recruit
   over 1 km from their nest, recruiting more than 230\% farther than
   previously reported for any stingless bee feeder experiments. Natural
   size variation among colonies within the same species may play a role in
   foraging range, and could thus influence plant gene flow and population
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing spread of invasive alien plants has changed biodiversity
   throughout the world. To date research in this area has focused on how
   invasive plant species affect pollinator behaviour, but there is a lack
   of data on the impact that alien plant species have on wild pollinator
   populations. Since their introduction in the 19th century, and rapid
   spread after the 1950s, alien goldenrods (Solidago canadensis, Solidago
   gigantea) have been among the most successful invasive plant species in
   Europe. We studied the effects of goldenrods on wild pollinator
   communities in SE Poland. The abundance, species richness and diversity
   of wild bees, hoverflies and butterflies were compared between wet
   meadows invaded by goldenrod (10 transects) and non-invaded controls (10
   transects). Furthermore, we compared the plant diversity and average
   cover between the two groups of sites. Invasion of goldenrods had a very
   strong negative effect on wild pollinator diversity as well as
   abundance. Plant diversity and average cover were also negatively
   affected by goldenrod invasion. Wild pollinators were grouped according
   to their nesting and food specialization, but none were resistant to the
   invasion, indicating that introduced goldenrod may affect the entire
   wild pollinator community. Our study emphasises the urgent need to
   develop specific protection plans for wild pollinators in habitats
   threatened by foreign plants and we call for the introduction of
   programs to stop the invasion of goldenrod not only in Poland, but also
   on a continental scale. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing how floral visitors forage efficiently among flowers is
   important to understanding plant-pollinator interactions. When bees
   search for rewarding flowers, they use several visual cues to detect the
   available floral resources. In addition to these cues, bees can
   recognize scent marks, which are olfactory cues left on flowers foraged
   by previous visitors. This behavior is well known in social bees, such
   as honeybees and bumblebees. Although solitary bees do not need to give
   information about which flowers were foraged to conspecifics, several
   pieces of evidence have indicated the use of scent marks. However, it is
   unknown whether the behavior is widely used in many different bee
   species. We investigated whether four different solitary bees, Colletes
   patellatus (Colletidae), Andrena prostomias (Andrenidae), Osmia
   orientalis (Megachilidae), and Tetralonia mitsukurii (Apidae), can
   recognize flowers that have been foraged previously by visitors within 3
   min. All four bees showed rejection responses to flowers foraged by
   conspecifics. However, our results showed that responses to foraged
   flowers varied among bee species. The tendency of A. prostomias and T.
   mitsukurii to reject the foraged flowers was pronounced, while in C.
   patellatus and O. orientalis it was weak. In both A. prostomias and T.
   mitsukurii, the rejection rate of flowers foraged by conspecifics
   decreased as the time lag after the last visit increased. Both bees
   visited the flowers from which pollen or nectar had been artificially
   removed. We suggest that A. prostomias and T. mitsukurii would recognize
   scent marks left by previous visitors, while the other two bees would
   not recognize them so strongly. It is likely that the decision to use
   scent marks is dependent either on the richness of resources or on the
   complexity of floral structure.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions provide ideal frameworks for studying
   interactions in plant communities. Despite the large potential influence
   of such interactions on plant community structure, biodiversity and
   evolutionary processes, we know surprisingly little about the relative
   importance of positive and negative interactions among plant species for
   pollinator attraction. Therefore, we explored the relationships between
   conspecific and heterospecific floral densities and the flower
   visitation rates of nine plant species mainly visited by bumble bees,
   and six plant species mainly visited by flies, in a temperate grassland,
   through stepwise multiple regressions. Significant relationships were
   interpreted as interactions for pollinator attraction. Our results
   revealed that positive intra- and interspecific interactions for
   pollinator attraction were far more frequent than negative ones.
   Seventeen interspecific interactions were revealed of which 14 were
   significantly positive, whereas three of four significant intraspecific
   interactions were positive. Seven species experienced only positive
   interactions and two species experienced only negative interactions. The
   results presented here indicate that negative interactions are not
   necessarily the dominant ecological interaction for pollination among
   plants within a community, and the study represents a straightforward
   approach to study intra- and interspecific interactions among multiple
   species within a community. We discuss which mechanisms may drive the
   positive interactions for pollinator attraction and whether this may
   result in facilitative effects on reproductive success.}},

   pollinators, and the parasites, parasitoids, and pathogens of the bumble
   bees at heathland sites. We found the lower trophic levels of the
   community successfully reinstated at restored relative to control sites.
   However the abundance, load per host, prevalence of parasitism,
   prevalence of superparasitism, and host range of a key dipteran
   parasitoid of the family Conopidae were all significantly reduced in
   restored heathlands. Potential causes for this incomplete
   reestablishment at restored sites include the lag in floral resources
   due to differences in. oral species composition, and the reduced ability
   of this parasitoid species in accessing host resources relative to other
   natural enemy species present in these communities. Moreover the
   incomplete reinstatement of the natural enemy community was found to
   significantly reduce levels of network vulnerability (a measure of how
   vulnerable prey is to being consumed) at restored sites relative to
   ancient, control networks.}},

Abstract = {{Kiwifruit vines rely on bees for pollen transfer between spatially
   separated male and female individuals and require synchronized flowering
   to ensure pollination. Volatile terpene compounds, which are important
   cues for insect pollinator attraction, were studied by dynamic headspace
   sampling in the major green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa)
   cultivar `Hayward' and its male pollinator `Chieftain'. Terpene volatile
   levels showed a profile dominated by the sesquiterpenes alpha-farnesene
   and germacrene D. These two compounds were emitted by all floral tissues
   and could be observed throughout the day, with lower levels at night.
   The monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene was also detected in flowers but was
   emitted predominantly during the day and only from petal tissue. Using a
   functional genomics approach, two terpene synthase (TPS) genes were
   isolated from a `Hayward' petal EST library. Bacterial expression and
   transient in planta data combined with analysis by enantioselective gas
   chromatography revealed that one TPS produced primarily
   (E,E)-alpha-farnesene and small amounts of (E)-beta-ocimene, whereas the
   second TPS produced primarily (+)-germacrene D. Subcellular localization
   using GFP fusions showed that both enzymes were localized in the
   cytoplasm, the site for sesquiterpene production. Real-time PCR analysis
   revealed that both TPS genes were expressed in the same tissues and at
   the same times as the corresponding floral volatiles. The results
   indicate that two genes can account for the major floral sesquiterpene
   volatiles observed in both male and female A. deliciosa flowers.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to identify the major volatiles and
   their relative concentrations in intact grapefruit, sweet orange, sour
   orange, mandarin, lemon, lime and pummelo blossoms. Volatiles from
   freshly picked blossoms were collected and concentrated using static
   headspace solid-phase microextraction and then separated and identified
   using GC-MS. Seventy volatiles were detected, 66 identified, of which 29
   were identified for the first time in citrus blossoms. Major volatiles
   consisted of linalool, beta-myrcene, alpha-myrcene, limonene,
   (E)-ocimene, methyl anthranilate and indole. In terms of total
   volatiles: pummelo >> grapefruit approximate to sweet orange > sour
   orange approximate to mandarin approximate to lemon-lime > Volkamer
   lemon > Kaffir lime. Principal component analysis of blossom volatiles
   demonstrated that there were three widely separated, tightly clustered
   groups which consisted of mandarin, lemon-lime and pummelo. Other
   cultivars of possible mixed parentage produced non-overlapping values
   within the boundaries of these three clustered groups. The first two
   Eigenvectors explained 83\% of the total variance. Linalool, limonene
   and myrcene had the highest loading values. Those cultivars requiring
   insect pollination such as pummelo produced highest levels of total
   volatiles as well as highest levels of known honeybee stimulants such as
   1-hexanol and linalool. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied gland morphology, anatomy and the chemical composition of the
   floral fragrance in the sweat bee-pollinated orchid Cyclopogon elatus.
   This is apparently the first such analysis for any Cyclopogon species,
   and one of very few studies in which both odour and osmophore are
   characterised in a nectar-rewarding orchid. Structures responsible for
   floral scent production were localised with neutral red staining and
   histochemical assays for lipids and starch. Their morphology and anatomy
   were studied with scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy thin
   sections, respectively. Fragrance samples were collected using SPME
   fibres and analysed with GC-MS. Anatomical evidence suggests that two
   parallel oval- shaped patches of unicellular trichomes on the abaxial
   surface of the labellum are osmophores. These are rich in stored lipids,
   while the parenchyma surrounding the vascular bundles contains starch.
   Only freshly opened flowers produced odours, while buds and withered
   flowers lacked scent. The chemical composition of the odour was
   dominated (>99.8\%) by a single compound,
   trans-4,8-dimethyl-nona-1,3,7-triene (DMNT). Gland anatomy and position
   on the outside of the perianth are unusual for scent glands in general.
   The presence of DMNT, a nearly ubiquitous compound in herbivore-induced
   vegetative emissions and one of the major floral volatiles of Yucca, is
   not surprising in view of hypotheses on the evolutionary origin of
   flower scents, suggesting that wound volatiles are utilised as
   kairomonal attractants by florivores whose activities result in
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The bee family Melittidae comprises a small, but biologically
   fascinating, group of mostly oligolectic bees, some of which are oil
   collecting. Phylogenetic relationships within this family are poorly
   understood and some genera cannot be placed with confidence at the
   subfamily level. We analysed melittid phylogeny using a combined dataset
   of five nuclear genes {[}28S, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha, F-2
   copy), long-wavelength rhodopsin, Na-K ATPase and RNA polymerase II]
   spanning 4842 bp plus 68 adult morphological characters. Our study
   included 25\% of the species-level diversity and 81\% of the
   generic-level diversity and included all previously recognized tribes
   and subfamilies. We analysed the dataset using parsimony, maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian methods. All methods yielded congruent results.
   All topologies recovered the three previously recognized subfamilies
   (Dasypodainae, Melittinae, Meganomiinae), but two genera (Afrodasypoda
   and Promelitta) are transferred from Dasypodainae to Melittinae. On the
   basis of our tree topologies we identify four tribes (Dasypodaini
   comb.n., Hesperapini stat.n., Macropidini comb.n. and Melittini), only
   one of which (Melittini) matches a widely used classification. Lastly,
   we discuss the evolution of host-plant association in the light of our
   new phylogenetic hypothesis. Our results strongly support multiple
   independent origins of oil-collecting behaviour in the Melittinae.}},

Abstract = {{The prospect that a global pollination crisis currently threatens
   agricultural productivity has drawn intense recent interest among
   scientists, politicians, and the general public {[}1-5]. To date,
   evidence for a global crisis has been drawn from regional or local
   declines in pollinators themselves {[}6-9] or insufficient pollination
   for particular crops {[}9, 10]. In contrast, our analysis of Food and
   Agriculture Organization (FAO) {[}11] data reveals that the global
   population of managed honey-bee hives has increased similar to 45\%
   during the last half century and suggests that economic globalization,
   rather than biological factors, drives both the dynamics of the global
   managed honey-bee population and increasing demands for agricultural
   pollination services {[}12]. Nevertheless, available data also reveal a
   much more rapid (>300\%) increase in the fraction of agriculture that
   depends on animal pollination during the last half century, which may be
   stressing global pollination capacity. Although the primary cause of the
   accelerating increase of the pollinator dependence of commercial
   agriculture seems to be economic and political and not biological, the
   rapid expansion of cultivation of many pollinator-dependent crops has
   the potential to trigger future pollination problems for both these
   crops and native species in neighboring areas. Such environmental costs
   merit consideration during the development of agriculture and
   conservation policies.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers act as ``sensory billboards{''} with multiple signals (color,
   morphology, odor) attracting and manipulating potential pollinators
   {[}1]. Many use changing signals as indicators that visitation and/or
   pollination have occurred (2, 3]). Floral color change is commonly used
   to transmit this information {[}3-7] (often correlated with reduced
   nectar reward {[}8, 9]) and can be specifically triggered by pollination
   or visitation. By retaining color-changed flowers, plants benefit from
   larger floral displays but also indicate at close range which flowers
   are still rewarding (and still unpollinated), so that visitors forage
   more efficiently {[}5, 6]. However, the legume Desmodium setigerum shows
   a unique ability, if inadequately pollinated, to reverse its flowers'
   color and shape changes. Single visits by bees mechanically depress the
   keel and expose stigma and anthers (termed ``tripping{''}); visits also
   initiate a rapid color change from lilac to white and turquoise and a
   slower morphological change, the upper petal folding downwards over the
   reproductive parts. But flowers receiving insufficient pollen can
   partially reopen, re-exposing the stigma, with a further color change to
   deeper turquoise and/or lilac. Thus, most flowers achieve pollination
   from one bee visit, but those with inadequate pollen receipt can reverse
   their signals, earning a ``second chance{''} by eliciting attention from
   other potential pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Predators of pollinators can influence pollination services and plant
   fitness via both consumptive (reducing pollinator density) and
   non-consumptive (altering pollinator behaviour) effects. However, a
   better knowledge of the mechanisms underlying behaviourally mediated
   indirect effects of predators is necessary to properly understand their
   role in community dynamics. We used the tripartite relationship between
   bumblebees, predatory crab spiders and flowers to ask whether
   behaviourally mediated effects are localized to flowers harbouring
   predators, or whether bees extend their avoidance to entire plant
   species. In a tightly controlled laboratory environment, bumblebees
   (Bombus terrestris) were exposed to a random mixture of equally
   rewarding yellow and white artificial flowers, but foraging on yellow
   flowers was very risky: bees had a 25 per cent chance of receiving a
   simulated predation attempt by `robotic' crab spiders. As bees learnt to
   avoid `dangerous' flowers, their foraging preferences changed and they
   began to visit fewer yellow flowers than expected by chance. Bees
   avoided spider-free yellow flowers as well as dangerous yellow flowers
   when spiders were more difficult to detect (the colour of yellow spiders
   was indistinguishable from that of yellow flowers). Therefore, this
   interaction between bee learning and predator crypsis could lead flower
   species harbouring cryptic predators to suffer from reduced reproductive
   success.}},

Volume = {{121}},

Month = {{JUN 2}},
Abstract = {{An apple orchard consisting of a single commercial cultivar and of
   pollinizers such as Crab apples under the condition of natural
   pollination needs pollinators for stable fruit production. We
   investigated the foraging behavior of pollinators, especially Osmia
   cornifrons Radoszkowski, in order to evaluate their use instead of
   honeybees.
   O. cornifrons showed strong flower constancy for 4-8 min during one
   pollen-nectar foraging trip, as observed in honeybees. However, the bees
   seemed to forage for different types of flowers, e.g. from a red to a
   white petal color, during their 16-22 pollen-nectar foraging trips based
   on the S-RNase allele and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses of
   pollen loaves made during those trips. After one pollen-nectar foraging
   trip, the bees brushed their abdomen with their hind legs at a nester
   tube, but ca. 10\% of pollen was not brushed from their bodies. The
   remaining pollen on the body retained the ability for the fertilization
   of apple for 12 days, suggesting that the pollen on the pollinator's
   body from a pollinizer could be used for the fertilization of a
   commercial cultivar visited on their next foraging trip.
   O. cornifrons seems to be a useful pollinator in apple orchards
   consisting of a single cultivar, such as, `Fuji', and of pollinizers of
   different types, such as the red petal color type, `Maypole' or
   `Makamik'. Moreover, most pollen loaves investigated contained
   S-28-RNase allele, which was specific for pollen of `Starking Delicious'
   planted at a great distance (55.2 m) from the nestiny shelter,
   suggesting that O. cornifrons is a useful pollinator for `Delicious',
   which is difficult for honeybees to use as a pollinator for its
   sideworking behavior. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1365-1378}},

Abstract = {{Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding
   locations) has been often observed in pollinators collecting nectar or
   pollen from flowers. Although field studies on bumble-bees and
   hummingbirds have clarified fundamental aspects of this behaviour,
   trapline foraging still poses several difficult questions from the
   perspectives of both animals and plants. These questions include whether
   and how traplining improves foraging performance, how animals develop
   traplines with accumulating foraging experience, and how traplining
   affects pollen flow or plant reproduction.
   First, we review our previous work performed by using computer
   simulations and indoor flight-cage experiments with bumble-bees foraging
   from arrays of automated feeders. Our findings include the following:
   (1) traplining benefits foragers that are competing for resources that
   replenish in a decelerating way, (2) traplining is a learned behaviour
   that develops over a period of hours and (3) the establishment of
   traplines could be hampered by spatial configuration of plants such as
   zigzags. Second, using a simulation model linking pollinator movement
   and pollen transfer, we consider how service by pollinators with
   different foraging patterns (searchers or trapliners) would affect
   pollen flow. Traplining increases mating distance and mate diversity,
   and reduces `iterogamy' (self-pollination caused by return visits) at
   the population level. Furthermore, increased visitation rates can have
   opposite effects on the reproductive success of a plant, depending on
   whether the visitors are traplining or searching. Finally, we discuss
   possible consequences of traplining for plants in the light of new
   experimental work and modelling.
   We suggest that trapline foraging by pollinators increases variation
   among plant populations in genetic diversity, inbreeding depression and
   contributions of floral traits to plant fitness, which should in turn
   affect the rates and directions of floral evolution. More theoretical
   and empirical studies are needed to clarify possible outcomes of such a
   neglected side of pollination.}},

Title = {{Pollinator visitation patterns strongly influence among-flower variation
   in selfing rate}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1379-1383}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Adjacent flowers on Mimulus ringens floral displays often vary markedly
   in selfing rate. We hypothesized that this fine-scale variation in
   mating system reflects the tendency of bumble-bee pollinators to probe
   several flowers consecutively on multiflower displays. When a pollinator
   approaches a display, the first flower probed is likely to receive
   substantial outcross pollen. However, since pollen carryover in this
   species is limited, receipt of self pollen should increase rapidly for
   later flowers. Here the first direct experimental test of this
   hypothesis is described.
   In order to link floral visitation sequences with selfing rates of
   individual flowers, replicate linear arrays were established, each
   composed of plants with unique genetic markers. This facilitated
   unambiguous assignment of paternity to all sampled progeny. A single
   wild bumble-bee was permitted to forage on each linear array, recording
   the order of floral visits on each display. Once fruits had matured, 120
   fruits were harvested (four flowers from each of five floral displays in
   each of six arrays). Twenty-five seedlings from each fruit were
   genotyped and paternity was unambiguously assigned to all 3000 genotyped
   progeny.
   The order of pollinator probes on Mimulus floral displays strongly and
   significantly influenced selfing rates of individual fruits. Mean
   selfing rates increased from 21 \% for initial probes to 78 \% for the
   fourth flower probed on each display.
   Striking among-flower differences in selfing rate result from increased
   deposition of geitonogamous (among-flower, within-display) self pollen

Abstract = {{Because of differences in snowmelt time, the reproductive phenologies of
   alpine plants are highly variable among local populations, and there is
   large variation in seed set across populations. Temporal variation in
   pollinator availability during the season may be a major factor
   affecting not only seed production but also outcrossing rate of alpine
   plants.
   Among local populations of Phyllodoce aleutica that experience different
   snowmelt regimes, flowering phenology, pollinator availability, seed-set
   rate, and outcrossing rate were compared with reference to the mating
   system (self-compatibility or heterospecific compatibility with a
   co-occurring congeneric species).
   Flowering occurred sequentially among populations reflecting snowmelt
   time from mid-July to late August. The visit frequency of bumble-bees
   increased substantially in late July when workers appeared. Both seed
   set and outcrossing rate increased as flowering season progressed.
   Although flowers were self-compatible and heterospecific compatible, the
   mixed-pollination experiment revealed that fertilization with
   conspecific, outcrossing pollen took priority over selfing and
   hybridization, indicating a cryptic self-incompatibility. In early
   snowmelt populations, seed production was pollen-limited and autogamous
   selfing was common. However, genetic analyses revealed that selfed
   progenies did not contribute to the maintenance of populations due to
   late-acting inbreeding depression.
   Large variations in seed-set and outcrossing rates among populations
   were caused by the timing of pollinator availability during the season
   and the cryptic self-incompatibility of this species. Despite the
   intensive pollen limitation in part of the early season, reproductive
   assurance by autogamous selfing was not evident. Under fluctuating
   conditions of pollinator availability and flowering structures, P.
   aleutica maintained the genetic composition by conspecific outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{One peculiarity of floral nectar that remains relatively unexplored from
   an ecological perspective is its role as a natural habitat for
   micro-organisms. This study assesses the frequency of occurrence and
   abundance of yeast cells in floral nectar of insect-pollinated plants
   from three contrasting plant communities on two continents. Possible
   correlations between interspecific differences in yeast incidence and
   pollinator composition are also explored.
   The study was conducted at three widely separated areas, two in the
   Iberian Peninsula (Spain) and one in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico).
   Floral nectar samples from 130 species (37-63 species per region) in 44
   families were examined microscopically for the presence of yeast cells.
   For one of the Spanish sites, the relationship across species between
   incidence of yeasts in nectar and the proportion of flowers visited by
   each of five major pollinator categories was also investigated.
   Yeasts occurred regularly in the floral nectar of many species, where
   they sometimes reached extraordinary densities (up to 4 x 10(5) cells
   mm(-3)). Depending on the region, between 32 and 44 \% of all nectar
   samples contained yeasts. Yeast cell densities in the order of 10(4)
   cells mm(-3) were commonplace, and densities > 10(5) cells mm(-3) were
   not rare. About one-fifth of species at each site had mean yeast cell
   densities > 10(4) cells mm(-3). Across species, yeast frequency and
   abundance were directly correlated with the proportion of floral visits
   by bumble-bees, and inversely with the proportion of visits by solitary
   bees.
   Incorporating nectar yeasts into the scenario of plant-pollinator
   interactions opens up a number of intriguing avenues for research. In
   addition, with yeasts being as ubiquitous and abundant in floral nectars
   as revealed by this study, and given their astounding metabolic
   versatility, studies focusing on nectar chemical features should
   carefully control for the presence of yeasts in nectar samples.}},

Abstract = {{Although the ecological and evolutionary consequences of foliar
   herbivory are well understood, how plants cope with floral damage is
   less well explored. Here the concept of tolerance, typically studied
   within the context of plant defence to foliar herbivores and pathogens,
   is extended to floral damage. Variation in tolerance to floral damage is
   examined, together with some of the mechanisms involved.
   The study was conducted on Ipomopsis aggregata, which experiences floral
   damage and nectar removal by nectar-robbing bees. High levels of robbing
   can reduce seeds sired and produced by up to 50 \%, an indirect effect
   mediated through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants. Using an
   experimental common garden with groups of I. aggregata, realized
   tolerance to robbing was measured. Realized tolerance included both
   genetic and environmental components of tolerance. It was hypothesized
   that both resource acquisition and storage traits, and traits involved
   in pollination would mitigate the negative effects of robbers.
   Groups of I. aggregata varied in their ability to tolerate nectar
   robbing. Realized tolerance was observed only through a component of
   male plant reproduction (pollen donation) and not through components of
   female plant reproduction. Some groups fully compensated for robbing
   while others under- or overcompensated. Evidence was found only for a
   pollination-related trait, flower production, associated with realized
   tolerance. Plants that produced more flowers and that had a higher
   inducibility of flower production following robbing were more able to
   compensate through male function.
   Variation in realized tolerance to nectar robbing was found in I.
   aggregata, but only through an estimate of male reproduction, and traits
   associated with pollination may confer realized tolerance to robbing. By
   linking concepts and techniques from studies of plant-pollinator and
   plant-herbivore interactions, this work provides insight into the role
   of floral traits in pollinator attraction as well as plant defence.}},

Abstract = {{A deeper understanding of mutualism can be reached by studying systems
   with measurable costs and benefits. Most studies of this type focus on
   an unusual class of obligate, species-specific pollination mutualisms.
   The interaction between Datura wrightii (Solanaceae) and the hawkmoth
   Manduca sexta offers similar advantages but greater generality. Adult
   moths both nectar at and deposit eggs on the same plant; larvae are
   herbivorous. The antagonistic component of this interaction has been
   well studied. Here the role of M. sexta as a pollinator of D. wrightii,
   particularly in the context of this moth's frequent nectaring visits to
   the bat-pollinated plant Agave palmeri, is documented.
   Hand-pollinations were used to determine breeding system and the
   reproductive consequences of mixed loads of A. palmeri and D. wrightii
   pollen. Plants and moths were caged overnight to assess whether
   nectaring visits led to fruit and seed set. Finally, pollen deposited on
   field-collected stigmas was identified, with a particular focus on
   documenting the presence of D. wrightii and A. palmeri grains.
   Datura wrightii is highly self-compatible, and a visit that deposits
   either outcross or self pollen almost doubles fruit and seed set
   compared with unvisited flowers. Manduca sexta transferred enough pollen
   to produce fruit and seed sets comparable to hand-pollination
   treatments. Agave palmeri did not interfere with D. wrightii success: in
   the field, stigmas received almost pure D. wrightii pollen, and
   hand-addition of large quantities of A. palmeri pollen had no measurable
   effect on fruit and seed set.
   The floral visitation component of the D. wrightii-M. sexta interaction
   is indeed mutualistic. This finding is essential background to future
   development of this interaction as a model system for studying
   mutualism's costs and benefits. It is already proving valuable for
   dissecting third-species effects on the outcome of mutualism. Results
   indicate that M. sexta's heavy visitation to A. palmeri has no negative
   effect on the benefits conferred to D. wrightii. However, it can be
   predicted to augment M. sexta populations to the point where the costs
   of the interaction begin to exceed its benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent studies show that plant-pollinator interaction webs exhibit
   consistent structural features such as long-tailed distributions of the
   degree of generalization, nestedness of interactions and asymmetric
   interaction dependencies. Recognition of these shared features has led
   to a variety of mechanistic attempts at explanation. Here it is
   hypothesized that beside size thresholds and species abundances, the
   frequency distribution of sizes (nectar depths and proboscis lengths)
   will play a key role in determining observed interaction patterns.
   To test the influence of size distributions, a new network parameter is
   introduced: the degree of size matching between nectar depth and
   proboscis length. The observed degree of size matching in a Spanish
   plant-pollinator web was compared with the expected degree based on
   joint probability distributions, integrating size thresholds and
   abundance, and taking the sampling method into account.
   Nectar depths and proboscis lengths both exhibited right-skewed
   frequency distributions across species and individuals. Species-based
   size matching was equally close for plants, independent of nectar depth,
   but differed significantly for pollinators of dissimilar proboscis
   length. The observed patterns were predicted well by a model considering
   size distributions across species. Observed size matching was closer
   when relative abundances of species were included, especially for
   flowers with openly accessible nectar and pollinators with long
   proboscises, but was predicted somewhat less successfully by the model
   that included abundances.
   The results suggest that in addition to size thresholds and species
   abundances, size distributions are important for understanding
   interaction patterns in plant-pollinator webs. It is likely that the
   understanding will be improved further by characterizing for entire
   communities how nectar production of flowers and energetic requirements
   of pollinators covary with size, and how sampling methods influence the
   observed interaction patterns.}},

Abstract = {{A South American cactus species, Echinopsis ancistrophora (Cactaceae),

   Eleven populations of E. ancistrophora were studied in their habitats in
   northern Argentina, and comparisons were made of relevant floral traits
   such as depth, stigma position, nectar volume and sugar concentration,
   and anthesis time. Diurnal and nocturnal pollinator assemblages were
   evaluated for populations with different floral trait combinations.
   Remarkable geographical variations in floral traits were recorded among
   the 11 populations throughout the distribution range of E.
   ancistrophora, with flower lengths ranging from 4.5 to 24.1 cm. Other
   floral traits associated with pollinator attraction also varied in a
   population-specific manner, in concert with floral depth. Populations
   with the shortest flowers showed morning anthesis and those with the
   longest flowers opened at dusk, whereas those with flowers of
   intermediate length opened at unusual times (2300-0600 h). Nectar
   production varied non-linearly with floral length; it was absent to low
   (population means up to 15 mu L) in short- to intermediate-length
   flowers, but was high (population means up to 170 mu L) in the longest
   tubed flowers. Evidence from light-trapping of moths, pollen carriage on
   their bodies and moth scale deposition on stigmas suggests that sphingid
   pollination is prevalent only in the four populations with the longest
   flowers, in which floral morphological traits and nectar volumes match
   the classic expectations for the hawkmoth pollination syndrome. All
   other populations, with flowers 4.5-15 cm long, were pollinated
   exclusively by solitary bees.
   The results suggest incipient differentiation at the population level
   and local adaptation to either bee or hawkmoth (potentially plus bee)
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators together with other biotic and some abiotic factors can
   select for floral traits. However, variation in pollinator abundance
   over time and space can weaken such selection. In the present study, the
   variation in pollinator abundance over time and space was examined in
   populations of the Rocky Mountain columbine. The variation in three
   floral traits is described and correlations between pollinator type,
   functional pollinator groups or altitude and floral traits are examined.
   Pollinator observations took place in six Aquilegia coerulea populations
   over 1-4 years and spur length, flower colour and sepal length were
   measured in 12 populations. Pollinator abundance, measured as visits per
   flower per hour, was compared among populations and years. Pollinators
   were grouped into two functional groups: pollen or nectar collectors.
   The following associations were examined: annual presence of hawkmoths
   and whiter flowers with longer spurs; the presence of Sphinx vashti and
   longer spurs; and higher altitudes and whiter flowers. The study looked
   at whether an increase in the proportion of hawkmoths in a population
   was associated with whiter and larger flowers with longer spurs.
   The abundance of different pollinator groups varied over time and space.
   Floral traits varied among populations. Higher altitude was correlated
   with bluer flowers. Whiter flowers were associated with the annual
   presence of hawkmoths. Populations visited by Sphinx vashti had longer
   spurs than populations visited only by Hyles lineata. Populations with
   greater percentage of nectar-collecting pollinators did not have whiter,
   larger flowers with longer spurs.
   Despite the large variation in pollinator abundance over time and space,
   one species of bumble-bee or hawkmoth tended to predominate in each
   population each year. Future studies of Aquilegia coerulea should
   examine the specific influences of pollinators and the environment on
   flower colour and of hawkmoth species on spur length.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1579-1588}},

Abstract = {{Productivity of many crops benefits from the presence of pollinating
   insects, so a decline in pollinator abundance should compromise global
   agricultural production. Motivated by the lack of accurate estimates of
   the size of this threat, we quantified the effect of total loss of
   pollinators on global agricultural production and crop production
   diversity. The change in pollinator dependency over 46 years was also
   evaluated, considering the developed and developing world separately.
   Using the extensive FAO dataset, yearly data were compiled for 1961-2006
   on production and cultivated area of 87 important crops, which we
   classified into five categories of pollinator dependency. Based on
   measures of the aggregate effect of differential pollinator dependence,
   the consequences of a complete loss of pollinators in terms of
   reductions in total agricultural production and diversity were
   calculated. An estimate was also made of the increase in total
   cultivated area that would be required to compensate for the decrease in
   production of every single crop in the absence of pollinators.
   The expected direct reduction in total agricultural production in the
   absence of animal pollination ranged from 3 to 8 \%, with smaller
   impacts on agricultural production diversity. The percentage increase in
   cultivated area needed to compensate for these deficits was several
   times higher, particularly in the developing world, which comprises
   two-thirds of the land devoted to crop cultivation globally. Crops with
   lower yield growth tended to have undergone greater expansion in
   cultivated area. Agriculture has become more pollinator-dependent over
   time, and this trend is more pronounced in the developing than developed
   world.
   We propose that pollination shortage will intensify demand for
   agricultural land, a trend that will be more pronounced in the
   developing world. This increasing pressure on supply of agricultural
   land could significantly contribute to global environmental change.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1589-1600}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Crop pollination by bees and other animals is an essential ecosystem
   service. Ensuring the maintenance of the service requires a full
   understanding of the contributions of landscape elements to pollinator
   populations and crop pollination. Here, the first quantitative model
   that predicts pollinator abundance on a landscape is described and
   tested.
   Using information on pollinator nesting resources, floral resources and
   foraging distances, the model predicts the relative abundance of
   pollinators within nesting habitats. From these nesting areas, it then
   predicts relative abundances of pollinators on the farms requiring
   pollination services. Model outputs are compared with data from coffee
   in Costa Rica, watermelon and sunflower in California and watermelon in
   New Jersey-Pennsylvania (NJPA).
   Results from Costa Rica and California, comparing field estimates of
   pollinator abundance, richness or services with model estimates, are
   encouraging, explaining up to 80 \% of variance among farms. However,
   the model did not predict observed pollinator abundances on NJPA, so
   continued model improvement and testing are necessary. The inability of
   the model to predict pollinator abundances in the NJPA landscape may be
   due to not accounting for fine-scale floral and nesting resources within
   the landscapes surrounding farms, rather than the logic of our model.
   The importance of fine-scale resources for pollinator service delivery
   was supported by sensitivity analyses indicating that the model's
   predictions depend largely on estimates of nesting and floral resources
   within crops. Despite the need for more research at the finer-scale, the
   approach fills an important gap by providing quantitative and
   mechanistic model from which to evaluate policy decisions and develop
   land-use plans that promote pollination conservation and service
   delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Competitive ability of transgenic oilseed rape transformed with a pea
   lectin gene was estimated by comparisons of its performance when grown
   in a mixture with its non-transgenic counterpart and when grown singly,
   with and without pollen beetles present. The experiments were carried
   out in cages, once with bumblebees as pollinators and once without. In
   the absence of herbivory but with the presence of bumblebees, singly
   grown plant lines without lectin generally performed better than lines
   with lectin. Pollen beetles affected plant growth and reproduction, but
   there were no consistent differences between the lectin and non-lectin
   plant lines indicating that the transgenic trait did not protect plants
   from pest attack. Herbivory reduced the number of seeds when bumblebees
   were present. In the absence of bumblebees, however, plants produced
   more seeds with pollen beetles than without, indicating that some
   pollination was carried out by the beetles. Efficient pollination
   affected the competitive abilities of the lines; lectin lines were more
   competitive with bumblebees present and the reverse was true when
   bumblebees were absent. In the presence of bumblebees, lectin lines
   gained from being grown mixed with its non-transgenic counterpart.
   Because the transgenic plants expressed pea lectin in developing pollen
   it is possible that pollen quality in those plants was reduced, which
   may explain why the lectin lines had an advantage over non-lectin lines
   when exchange of pollen between the two plant types was facilitated by
   bumblebees.}},

   of the cuticular lipids were C(23)-C(33) alkanes with nearly the same
   quantities of the same chain-length mono-alkenes (45\%). For the
   mono-alkenes of O. lignaria, 14 mono-alkene constituents were
   identified, with two of these, 9-heptacosene and 7-nonacosene,
   comprising 67\% of the total alkene distribution. For M. rotundata
   females, the mixtures of mono-alkenes were more complex with 26
   constituents identified and quantified. For the M. rotundata
   mono-alkenes, 57\% of the total composition consisted of the three
   alkenes, 7-pentacosene, 9-pentacosene and 7-heptacosene. For both bee
   species, small quantities Of C(40)-C(48) wax esters were also
   characterized with the major components possessing a C(18)
   mono-unsaturated fatty acid (9-octadecenoate) moiety esterified to

   protects native bee communities. A two-year study of bee communities on
   a Great Basin sand dune complex in Dugway Proving Ground located in
   northwestern Utah revealed low similarity index values between closely
   situated collecting plots (1-40 km apart). Similarity values ranged from
   0.13 to 0.70 for species composition, and from 0.07 to 0.57 when
   similarity was weighted by abundance. Distance between plots had no
   significant relationship to similarity when richness and abundance were
   considered. Bee similarity between plots was significantly correlated
   with floral similarity. These results indicate that dune conservation
   strategies that preserve ``representative{''} portions of dune systems
   may be insufficient to protect bees and the pollination services they
   provide. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aside from pollen and nectar, bees of the subfamily Megachilinae are
   closely associated with plants as a source of materials for nest
   construction. Megachilines use resins, masticated leaves, trichomes and
   other plant materials sometimes along with mud to construct nests in
   cavities or in soil. Among these, the leafcutter bees (Megachile s.l.)
   are the most famous for their behaviour to line their brood cells with
   discs cut from various plants. We report on fossil records of one body
   fossil of a new non-leafcutting megachiline and of 12 leafcuttings from
   three European sites-Eckfeld and Messel, both in Germany (Eocene), and
   Menat, France (Paleocene). The excisions include the currently earliest
   record of probable Megachile activity and suggest the presence of such
   bees in the Paleocene European fauna. Comparison with extant
   leafcuttings permits the interpretation of a minimal number of species
   that produced these excisions. The wide range of size for the
   leafcuttings indirectly might suggest at least two species of Megachile
   for the fauna of Messel in addition to the other megachiline bee
   described here. The presence of several cuttings on most leaves from
   Eckfeld implies that the preferential foraging behaviour of extant
   Megachile arose early in megachiline evolution. These results
   demonstrate that combined investigation of body and trace fossils
   complement each other in understanding past biodiversity, the latter
   permitting the detection of taxa not otherwise directly sampled and
   inferences on behavioural evolution.}},

Title = {{Specialized pollination in the African milkweed Xysmalobium orbiculare:
   a key role for floral scent in the attraction of spider-hunting wasps}},
Journal = {{PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{280}},

Pages = {{37-44}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Specialized pollination by prey-hunting wasps is poorly documented in
   rewarding plants. Furthermore, the mechanisms of achieving
   specialization are not clear since flowers typically produce exposed
   nectar and have no morphological adaptations (such as long spurs) to
   exclude non-pollinating visitors. We investigated the pollination of
   Xysmalobium orbiculare and explored the functional roles of floral scent
   and nectar in attracting pollinators and deterring nectar robbers.
   Floral visitor observations showed that this milkweed is visited almost
   exclusively by pompilid wasps in the genus Hemipepsis. These wasps were
   the only insects to carry pollinia, and a cage experiment confirmed
   their effectiveness in removing and inserting pollinia on flowers.
   Hand-pollinations showed that plants are genetically self-incompatible
   and thus reliant on pollinators for seed set. Palatability experiments
   with honeybees showed that nectar is distasteful to non-pollinating
   insects and is therefore likely to play a functional role in deterring
   nectar thieves. Choice experiments in the field showed that the wasp
   pollinators are attracted primarily by floral scent rather than visual
   cues. Analysis of spectral reflectance of flowers revealed that flowers
   are dull colored and are unlikely to stand out from the background
   vegetation. We conclude that X. orbiculare is specialized for
   pollination by spider-hunting wasps in the genus Hemipepsis and utilizes
   floral scent to selectively attract its pollinators and unpalatable
   nectar to deter non-pollinating visitors.}},

Journal = {{SOUTHERN FORESTS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{125-132}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The spotted gum species complex represents a group of four eucalypt
   hardwood taxa that have a native range that spans the east coast of
   Australia, with a morphological cline from Victoria to northern
   Queensland. Of this group, Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (CCV) is
   widespread in south-eastern Queensland and northern New South Wales. It
   is currently the most commonly harvested native hardwood in Queensland.
   However, little basic knowledge of the reproductive biology of the
   species is available to inform genetic improvement and resource
   management programmes. Here we take an integrative approach, using both
   field and molecular data, to identify ecological factors important to
   mating patterns in native populations of CCV. Field observation of
   pollinator visitation and flowering phenology of 20 trees showed that
   foraging behaviour of pollinator guilds varies depending on flowering
   phenology and canopy structure. A positive effect of tree mean flowering
   effort was found on insect visitation, while bat visitation was
   predicted by tree height and by the number of trees simultaneously
   bearing flowers. Moreover, introduced honeybees were observed
   frequently, performing 73\% of detected flower visits. Conversely,
   nectar-feeding birds and mammals were observed sporadically with
   lorikeets and honeyeaters each contributing to 11\% of visits. Fruit
   bats, represented solely by the grey-headed flying fox, performed less
   than 2\% of visits. Genotyping at six microsatellite markers in 301
   seeds from 17 families sampled from four of Queensland's native forests
   showed that CCV displays a mixed-mating system that is mostly
   outcrossing (t(m) = 0.899 +/- 0.021). Preferential effective pollination
   from near-neighbours was detected by means of maximum-likelihood
   paternity analysis with up to 16\% of reproduction events resulting from
   selfing. Forty to 48\% of fertilising pollen was also carried from
   longer distance (>60 m). Marked differences in foraging behaviour and
   visitation frequency between observed pollinator guilds suggests that
   the observed dichotomy of effective pollen movement in spotted gums may
   be due to frequent visit from introduced honeybees favouring geitonogamy
   and sporadic visits from honeyeaters and fruit bats resulting in
   potential long-distance pollinations.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of social bees was assessed at 15 sites across five
   locations of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats, India, from
   January to December 2007. We also conducted floristic analyses of local
   vegetation in each site using one-hectare sample plots. All woody
   species with a dbh (diameter at breast height) : 30 cm were recorded
   within the plots. A total area of 9.72 ha was assessed for floristic
   composition. Similarity of floristic composition between sites was
   determined using the Jaccard's distance measure and a dendrogram
   constructed based on the hierarchical clustering of floristic
   dissimilarities between sites. A Bee Importance Index (BII) was
   developed to give a measure of the bee diversity at each site. This
   index was a sum of the species richness of bee species in a site and
   their visitation frequencies to flowers, calculated as mean flower
   visits hour 1 within 2 focal patches within one hectare plots. The
   visits of bee species to flowers were also recorded. The Jaccard
   distance measure indicated that the montane sites were quite dissimilar
   to the low elevation sites in floristic diversity. The BII was 7-9 for
   the wet forest sites and ranged from 4-6 for drier forest sites. Seventy
   three plant species were identified as social bee plants and of them
   45\% were visited by one species of bee, 37\% by two bee species and
   18\% by more than two bee species, indicating a certain degree of floral
   specialization among bees.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have been conducted with bees of the subtribe Euglossina
   using odor baits as attractants. The objective of this study was to
   analyze the daily activity pattern of visits by males of four species of
   Eulaema - Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, 1841, Eulaemo flavescens (Friese,
   1899), Eulaema cingulata (Fabricius, 1804) and Eulaema bombiformis
   (Packard, 1869) - to vanillin and benzyl acetate baits, and their
   relationship with climatic and environmental factors throughout the day
   in different months of the year in a tropical forest fragment in Bahia.
   Eulaema nigrita was the most frequent species on vanillin baits and E.
   flavescens was the most frequent species on benzyl acetate baits. The
   highest frequency of visits was observed in February and December.
   Activities started between 5:00 and 9:00 h. In February and November,
   visits of E. nigrita to the bait were observed daily, following a
   bimodal pattern. The same activity pattern was observed for E.
   bombiformis in December. Males of four species of Eulaema occurred in
   all remaining months in a unimodal daily activity pattern, with a higher
   frequency before 9:30 h. The correlation between the visiting activity
   to odor baits and climatic factors was low. This result can be due to
   bee flight activity occurring within a range of adequate climatic
   variation, particularly temperature, which in our study ranged from 23
   to 32 degrees C. Daily activity patterns of Euglossina males on odor
   baits can represent patterns of flower fragrance collection under
   natural conditions, with visits usually at the time of highest
   production.}},

   monotypic Ericrocidini genus Aglaomelissa Snelling \& Brooks, 1985.
   Aglaomelissa duckei (Friese, 1906) emerged from trap-nests of Centris
   (Heterocentris) analis (Fabricius, 1804) and C. (Heterocentris)
   terminata Smith, 1874 from two sites in the Brazilian Amazonian region.
   The parasitism ratio caused by A. duckei was high, varying from 80 to
   100\% of the brood cells in a single trap-nest. Also, a compilation of
   the known host records for the species of Ericrocidini is presented and
   host-parasite associations are discussed. Host associations are known
   for seven of the 11 genera and about 17 of the 42 species of the tribe,
   involving a total of 34 confirmed or putative host species of Centridini
   bees. All species of the tribe are known to attack only nests of Centris
   Fabricius, 1804, except Mesoplia rufipes (Perty, 1833) that also
   parasitizes nests of Epicharis Klug, 1807. Although the phylogenetic
   relationships within Ericrocidini and among the subgenera of Centris are
   not well resolved, the current knowledge of the host-parasite
   associations points to a relatively high degree of specificity and
   possible coevolution between them.}},

Title = {{Bumble Bees (Bombus spp) along a Gradient of Increasing Urbanization}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bumble bees and other wild bees are important pollinators of
   wild flowers and several cultivated crop plants, and have declined in
   diversity and abundance during the last decades. The main cause of the
   decline is believed to be habitat destruction and fragmentation
   associated with urbanization and agricultural intensification.
   Urbanization is a process that involves dramatic and persistent changes
   of the landscape, increasing the amount of built-up areas while
   decreasing the amount of green areas. However, urban green areas can
   also provide suitable alternative habitats for wild bees.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied bumble bees in allotment
   gardens, i.e. intensively managed flower rich green areas, along a
   gradient of urbanization from the inner city of Stockholm towards more
   rural (periurban) areas. Keeping habitat quality similar along the
   urbanization gradient allowed us to separate the effect of landscape
   change (e.g. proportion impervious surface) from variation in habitat
   quality. Bumble bee diversity (after rarefaction to 25 individuals)
   decreased with increasing urbanization, from around eight species on
   sites in more rural areas to between five and six species in urban
   allotment gardens. Bumble bee abundance and species composition were
   most affected by qualities related to the management of the allotment
   areas, such as local flower abundance. The variability in bumble bee
   visits between allotment gardens was higher in an urban than in a
   periurban context, particularly among small and long-tongued bumble bee
   species.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest that allotment gardens and
   other urban green areas can serve as important alternatives to natural
   habitats for many bumble bee species, but that the surrounding urban
   landscape influences how many species that will be present. The higher
   variability in abundance of certain species in the most urban areas may
   indicate a weaker reliability of the ecosystem service pollination in
   areas strongly influenced by human activity.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in flowering plant density can have conflicting effects on
   pollination and seed production. Dense flower patches may attract more
   pollinators, but flowers in those patches may also compete for
   pollinator visits and abiotic resources. We examined how natural and
   experimental conspecific flowering plant density affected pollen receipt
   and seed production in a protandrous, bumble bee-pollinated wildflower.
   Delphinium barbeyi (Ranunculaceae). We also compared floral sex ratios,
   pollinator visitation rates, and pollen limitation of wed set from early
   to title in the season to determine whether these factors mirrored
   seasonal changes in pollen receipt and wed production. Pollen receipt
   increased with natural floweing plant density, while seed production
   increased across lower densities and decreased across higher flower
   densities. Experimental manipulation of flowering plant density did not
   affect pollinator visitation rate, pollen receipt, or seed production.
   Although pollinator visitation rate increased 10-fold from early to late
   in the season, pollen receipt and seed set decreased over the season.
   Seed set was never pollen-limited. Thus despite widespread effects of
   flowering plant density oil plant reproduction in other species, the
   effects of conspecific flowering plant density on D. barbeyi pollination
   and seed production are minor.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the pollination efficiency of a stingless bee, Melipona
   quadrifasciata, individuals originating from tropical and subtropical
   regions of South America were examined on tomatoes (cv. Momotaro 8)
   cultivated in a greenhouse in summer and autumn. We compared differences
   in the rates of foraged flowers, pollen weights foraged from anthers,
   rates of fruit set of tomatoes, seed number of tomato fruits and yields
   of tomato fruit weight between M. quadrifasciata and the bumblebee,
   Bombus terrestris. When the amount of tomato pollen was sufficient,
   there were no differences in pollination efficiency between the
   stingless bee and the bumblebee; however, the rates of foraged flowers,
   the rate of fruit set and the yields were significantly reduced in the
   stingless bee compared with the bumblebee when fertile tomato pollen
   decreased markedly during the hottest period of the summer. During this
   period, the rate of flowers foraged by bumblebees did not decrease, but
   the rates of fruit set, the seed number and the yields of tomato fruits
   decreased significantly in comparison with the other periods. It is
   known that tomato pollen production is inhibited at high temperatures;
   thus, we consider that the high temperatures in the greenhouse (average
   daily temperature higher than 28 degrees C) caused the extreme decrease
   in pollen production. These results indicate that M. quadrifasciata can
   be used as a suitable pollinator of tomatoes if sufficient amounts of
   fertile pollen are provided.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the use of ecological niche-modeling from data compiled in a
   participatory program of thousands of volunteer observers to
   quantitatively evaluate the spatial risk of invasion by the alien
   species Bombus terrestris. B. terrestris has been commercially
   introduced to japan for the pollination of greenhouse tomato crops since
   1991. Recently, naturalized populations of this species have spread
   rapidly, particularly in Hokkaido, northern Japan. Two niche-based
   models were constructed from independent data sets (presence-absence and
   presence-only data sets) and were used to validate one another. Both
   models performed well and indicated that the data compiled by
   participatory programs were useful for generating predictive models of
   the potential distribution of this invasive species. The models also
   revealed that the potential distribution of B. terrestris is negatively
   related to the proportion of woodland area, which corresponds to the
   known biology of this species. In contrast, the effect of the number of
   colonies introduced for tomato pollination (represented by tomato
   production) did not significantly affect the distribution of B.
   terrestris, indicating that its spread is now entering a phase of
   dispersal from established feral populations and that primary dispersal
   from commercial colonies in greenhouses is no longer a limiting factor
   for the distribution of this invasive species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Anogeissus dhofarica (Combretaceae) is an endemic tree of the monsoon
   affected coastal mountains of the southern Arabian Peninsula, being the
   character species of the Hybantho durae-Anogeissetum dhofaricae
   association, a drought deciduous, monsoon forest community found only in
   the Dhofar region of southern Oman and the eastern Al-Mahra region of
   south-east Yemen. Due to the steep precipitation gradient from the
   centre to the edges in this monsoon affected area, A. dhofarica is found
   in two different habitat types: in continuous woodland belts of the Hawf
   and Dhofar mountains, and in isolated, scattered woodland patches, as
   found especially in the Fartak Mts (south-east Yemen). Fifteen
   populations (212 individuals) from across the whole distribution area of
   the species were analysed using amplified fragment length polymorphism
   fingerprinting to: (1) evaluate the consequences of population
   fragmentation on the genetic diversity harboured in isolated patches
   versus cohering stands of the species and (2) to reconstruct the
   phylogeographical pattern of A. dhofarica as a consequence of
   oscillations in the monsoon activity during the Pleistocene and
   Holocene. The analysis of among-population genetic differentiation and
   within-population genetic diversity in A. dhofarica populations resulted
   in a lack of genetic pauperization and genetic differentiation of
   populations of the distinctly isolated patches of the Fartak Mts
   compared to the more luxurious forests of the Hawf and Dhofar regions.
   This is considered to be due to the high buffer capacity against the
   loss of genetic diversity caused by the long-lived life-form of the
   species combined with the capability to propagate clonally and the
   relatively recent fragmentation of Anogeissus forests into the described
   patches rather than due to high values of gene flow among remnant
   populations caused by bee pollination and anemochorical and
   hydrochorical diaspore dispersal. The phylogeographical pattern of the
   species argues for a quite recent fragmentation of a once continuous
   forest belt of A. dhofarica that is rather connected with climate
   changes in the Holocene than triggered by aridity-humidity oscillations
   reported for the Pleistocene. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{Approximately one-third of orchid species offer no reward to their
   floral visitors and instead trick them into pollination. Typically,
   these deceptive systems have low visitation and fruiting rates because
   pollinators can learn to avoid non-rewarding species. Consequently,
   pollination ecology studies in these species often require long hours in
   the field to witness relatively few floral visitations relative to
   rewarding plants. Cypripedium parviflorum is a food-deceptive orchid
   with a pouch-like trap that temporarily imprisons pollinators. To
   escape, pollinators exert pressure on the stigma which facilitates
   pollination and widens the escape holes located near each anther. This
   study reports the use of a ribbon and clip to block the escape
   passageway of this species in order to retain and observe visiting
   insects. The device was tested in a large population and was shown to
   increase significantly the probability of observing floral visitors by
   nearly three-fold. Ten species of hymenopteran visitors in the families
   Andrenidae, Apidae, Halictidae and Megachilidae were observed, with two
   female Adrena tridens and one male Adrena perplexa successfully removing
   pollen. Insect visitation to the orchids occurred during the first half
   of the flowering period and was significantly associated with warm,
   clear days. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate the probability of suitable habitats in the
   USA for two adventive orchid bee species (Eulaema polychroma (Mocsary)
   and Euglossa viridissima Friese), one of which has become established in
   southern Florida despite the absence of its associated orchid hosts.
   North and Central America, northern South America and the Caribbean.
   Using positive occurrence data within the native range of both orchid
   bee species, Maxent species distribution modelling was employed to
   evaluate the probability of suitable habitats in the USA. The power of
   predictability for the model was tested using partitions of the data.
   Our results show the absence of suitable habitat in southern Arizona for
   E. polychroma to maintain populations there, as well as establishing the
   northernmost limit for the species at around 29 degrees N in
   north-western Mexico. Suitable habitat was found for E. viridissima in
   various locations throughout southern Florida. This species is predicted
   to spread to occupy roughly the southern half of the Florida Peninsula.
   The findings indicate that species distribution modelling is useful for
   evaluating records of species occurrence outside of their native range.
   Our results indicate that the isolated record of a male of E. polychroma
   from southern Arizona should not be considered representative of an
   established population in the absence of further males and females from
   the same region. Conversely, E. viridissima has successfully become
   established in south-eastern Florida after a seemingly accidental
   introduction first noticed in the summer of 2003. We discuss the
   naturalization of E. viridissima in Florida, the probability of suitable
   habitat across the Caribbean (where orchid bees are otherwise natively
   absent today) and the absence of perfume orchids (Orchidaceae). Lastly,
   we discuss the implications of these results for understanding the
   biology and biogeography of Euglossini.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Selection Mosaic is central to the Geographic Mosaic
   Theory of Coevolution. Most information on coevolving interactions,
   however, comes from specialized organisms. In contrast, an accurate
   understanding of the effect of geographically varying evolutionary
   dynamics on the evolution of generalist organisms is lacking, although
   these kinds of organisms are the most frequent in nature. In flowering
   plants, pollinators and herbivores are important selective agents. In
   this study we investigate whether a geographic selection mosaic for.
   oral traits in a generalist plant, Erysimum mediohispanicum
   (Brassicaceae), can be mediated by the interplay of mutualistic and
   antagonistic interacting organisms. In eight populations we quantified
   the selection exerted by these organisms on several plant traits. We
   found significant spatial variation in pollinator assemblage. In
   different populations, the main pollinators belonged to different
   functional groups (beeflies, large bees, small bees, and beetles).
   Damage by ungulates also varied among populations. Consequently, we
   found that different populations were under different selective regimes,
   and the traits affected by selection depended on the local interaction
   intensity with pollinators and mammal herbivores. Some traits, such as
   flower number and stalk height, were selected similarly in most
   populations. Other traits, such as corolla diameter and tube length,
   were selected only in some populations. Finally, we found divergent
   selection for some traits, such as corolla tube width and corolla shape,
   which were selected in contrasting directions in different localities.
   This spatial variation in selective scenarios results in populations
   with strong selective regimes (hot spots) intermingled with populations
   with weak selective regimes (cold spots). Four important outcomes emerge
   from the E. mediohispanicum selection mosaic. (1) Interactions with
   generalist organisms may produce strong selection. (2) Spatial changes
   in main pollinators result in divergent selection across populations.
   (3) Geographic mosaics depend on a balance between mutualistic and
   antagonistic selection. (4) Selection mosaics operate at fairly small
   spatial scales. These findings will surely contribute to expanding the
   conceptual framework of the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution.}},

Abstract = {{Combining the needs of agricultural production with enhancing
   biodiversity requires a landscape-scale approach since the geographic
   scale at which most non-farmed species operate is unconstrained by farm
   boundaries. Bumblebees are a key component of farmland biodiversity as
   pollinators of both crops and wild flora. However, the factors
   determining their densities in such landscapes remain poorly understood.
   Using a combination of remote-sensed landscape data and molecular
   markers, we quantify the effects of land use (oilseed rape, field beans
   and non-cropped areas, all of which provide suitable bumblebee forage),
   at various spatial scales to find the best predictor of colony density
   for the bumblebee Bombus pascuorum Scopoli in an arable landscape.
   Estimated colony density was positively correlated with the area of all
   habitat categories within 1000 m of the sample site. No significant
   relationships were found for greater or lesser distances. This concurs
   with earlier estimates of the foraging range of this species. We found
   no evidence that nest sizes increased with forage availability, although
   our data do not allow us to categorically exclude this possibility.
   It has long been suspected that forage availability limits bee abundance
   in agricultural landscapes but there is little direct evidence for this.
   Here we report a direct relationship between floral abundance and
   bumblebee nest density within a notionally fixed area. Importantly, we
   suggest that the forage availability within the previously published
   estimated foraging distance for this species at this location is a good
   predictor of the scale of impact of forage provision on nesting density.}},

Abstract = {{A recent article presents a study of pollinator visitation behaviour
   that is used to evaluate the selective pressure that pollinator
   visitation rate might have on the timing of the production of
   nonrewarding flowers. Here we take issue with the conclusions of the
   paper that there should be selection pressure for nonrewarding flowers
   to be available earlier in the season in order to avoid dissimilar
   sympatric rewarding species. Consideration of selection pressure must
   take into account temporal variation in total pollinator availability,
   pollinator longevity and unlearned response, and the stability of plant
   communities over time, as well as the learned responses of individual
   pollinators that the original study focused on. Learning alone would not
   necessarily select for early flowering by nonrewarders if temporal
   variation in pollinator numbers is strong or naive pollinators
   consistently appear throughout the flowering season. Further, we argue
   that early flowering could simply be a natural corollary of longevity of
   flowers needed to combat negative frequency-dependent selection and low
   overall visitation rates by pollinators, rather than a trait that has
   been specifically selected to reduce temporal overlap with competing
   rewarding species.}},

Abstract = {{Orchids of the genus Ophrys are pollinated by males of solitary bees and
   wasps through sexual deception. The flowers mimic the behaviourally
   active compounds of the sex pheromone of receptive females and thus
   attract males that seek to copulate. Odour is the main attractant while
   visual stimuli have been assumed so far to play only a minor role. In
   contrast to most species of the genus, Heldreich's orchid Ophrys
   heldreichii, which is pollinated by males of the long-horned bee
   Tetralonia berlandi, possesses a bright pink perianth that appears
   conspicuous to a human observer. We investigated the role of this floral
   colour signal in pollinator attraction. We filmed approach flights of
   male bees to flowers in which we removed the original perianth and in
   which we substituted the perianth with an artificial one of a particular
   selected colour. At distances >30 cm, male search time correlated only
   with wind speed but not with the spectral parameters of the perianth,
   i.e. chromatic and green receptor-specific contrast. By contrast, in the
   close range (<30cm), where the perianth subtends a visual angle of at
   least 5 deg. to the bee's eye, search time decreased with increasing
   green receptor contrast between perianth and background; however, no
   correlation with chromatic contrast or wind speed was found. Our results
   indicate that pollinators are first attracted by olfactory signals from
   a distance. Once in the vicinity of the flower where spatial vision of
   the males is sufficient, they are guided exclusively by vision. However,
   it can be expected that possession of a `non-private' colour signal
   would increase the risk of pollen loss in sexually deceptive orchids by
   accidentally attracting non-specific flower visitors. We therefore
   discuss the occurrence of colour signals in the genus Ophrys in respect
   to the species-specific visual system of the pollinators.}},

   known `Zutano' polliniser trees, were selected to investigate the impact
   of honeybees on pollen transfer. `Zutano' pollen (5 g per insert) was
   placed at the entry to beehives (approx. eight beehives per orchard) and
   refreshed four-to-five times during the flowering season. Successful
   pollinations were determined by parental analysis of harvested `Hass'
   fruit from trees located at various distances from the beehives, and at
   three different stages of fruit development, using microsatellite DNA
   markers. The results showed no significant difference in the proportions
   of `Zutano'-pollinated fruit with respect to distance and/or development
   stage between orchards provided with beehives containing `Zutano' pollen
   and those without supplemented pollen. This strongly suggests that
   honeybees are not the major pollinators of avocado, and that most
   avocado flowers are self-pollinated by wind.}},

Abstract = {{Direct comparison of genetic patterns between museum specimens and
   contemporary collections can be a powerful approach for detecting recent
   demographic changes. Using microsatellite markers, we examined
   historical and contemporary genetic variation from an apparently
   declining bumble bee species, Bombus pensylvanicus, and from a stable
   species, Bombus impatiens, in central Illinois. For each species, we
   genotyped specimens from the Illinois Natural History Survey collected
   from three populations between 1969-1972 and from a resurvey of the same
   areas conducted in 2008. Population structure in B. pensylvanicus
   increased markedly over the last four decades (from theta(ST) = 0.001 to
   0.027) while no structure was detected in B. impatiens for either time
   period (theta(ST) = -0.006 to -0.003). Changes in genetic diversity were
   not significant for either species, although small reductions were
   observed for B. pensylvanicus in all three populations. Coalescent
   simulations incorporating both contemporary and historical samples
   suggest that this small change is not surprising for recent population
   declines, as large reductions in genetic diversity were only apparent
   under the most severe bottleneck scenarios. These results demonstrate
   how comparisons of genetic patterns between temporal periods and species
   can help elucidate potential threats to population health and suggest
   several strategies that might be useful in the conservation of B.
   pensylvanicus in the Midwestern USA.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A small but vocal community of critics has questioned the
   epistemological value of DNA barcoding by suggesting that either it
   `cannot work' for the identification or discovery of species or that it
   ignores the `richness' inherent in traditional approaches. We re-examine
   these arguments through a comparison of DNA barcoding and morphological
   taxonomy in terms of their accuracy and diversity of characters
   employed. We conclude that morphology often does not work and that it is
   often nowhere near as `rich' as has been argued. Morphology is
   particularly poor in numerous important situations, such as the
   association of larvae with adults and discrimination among cryptic
   species. The vehemence of some of the criticisms is surprising given
   that morphology alone is known to be inadequate to the task of
   species-level identification in many instances.}},

Abstract = {{DNA barcoding has been evaluated for many animal taxa and is now
   advocated as a reliable and rapid means for species-level
   identification. The coming-to-light of this identification tool is
   timely as we are now facing perhaps the greatest rate of species loss in
   recent millennia. This study contributes to an ever-increasing number of
   published accounts of DNA barcoding successfully and accurately
   distinguishing animal taxa, in this instance, the bee fauna of Nova
   Scotia, Canada. Most members of this well-known fauna were resolved with
   particular clarity; the average intraspecific divergence was less than
   0.5\%, and COI sequences from over 75\% of the province's species are
   now in the Barcodes of Life Data System. DNA barcoding also revealed
   some surprises within this fauna, including the possible recognition of
   two undescribed genetically unique species, one in the genus Ceratina
   (subgenus Zadontomerus), the second in the genus Andrena (subgenus
   Larandrena); both are presently receiving further taxonomic study. In
   addition, DNA barcoding has allowed sex-associations among two pairs of
   cleptoparasitic species. The resulting utility of DNA barcoding for
   ecological studies of bee communities is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Like ants and termites some species of stingless bees (Meliponini),
   which are very important pollinators in the tropics, use pheromone
   trails to communicate the location of a food source. We present data on
   the communicative role of mandibular gland secretions of Meliponini that
   resolve a recent controversy about their importance in the laying of
   such trails. Volatile constituents of the mandibular glands have been
   erroneously thought both to elicit aggressive/defensive behaviour and to
   signal food source location. We studied Trigona spinipes and
   Scaptotrigona aff. depilis ('postica'), two sympatric species to which
   this hypothesis was applied. Using extracts of carefully dissected
   glands instead of crude cephalic extracts we analysed the substances
   contained in the mandibular glands of worker bees. Major components of
   the extracts were 2-heptanol (both species), nonanal (T. spinipes),
   benzaldehyde and 2-tridecanone (S. aff. depilis). The effect of
   mandibular gland extracts and of individual components thereof on the
   behaviour of worker bees near their nest and at highly profitable food
   sources was consistent. Independent of the amount of mandibular gland
   extract applied, the bees overwhelmingly reacted with defensive
   behaviour and were never attracted to feeders scented with mandibular
   gland extract or any of the synthetic chemicals tested. Both bee species
   are capable of using mandibular gland secretions for intra-and
   interspecific communication of defence and aggression and share
   2-heptanol as a major pheromone compound. While confirming the role of
   the mandibular glands in nest defence, our experiments provide strong
   evidence against their role in food source signalling.}},

Abstract = {{(Reproductive success of four species of Eugenia L. (Myrtaceae)).
   Eugenia uniflora, E. punicfolia, E. neonitida and E. rotundifolia are
   perennial species, usually shrubs, which occur in the restinga of the
   Grumari Natural Municipal Park, in western Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They
   have Papaver-type pollen-flowers that are hermaphrodite, polystemonous
   and pollinated mainly by bees. An assessment of the breeding systems
   showed that only E. uniflora and E. punicifolia are self-compatible. The
   fruit/flower, seed/ovule and seed/fruit ratios were calculated for each
   species. Fruit and seed predators were identified and predation rates
   were estimated. Total reproductive success for each species in the
   restinga was extremely low. In order to have one viable seed free from
   herbivore attack at the end of the reproductive process, the species
   Would need to produce 312.5 E. uniflora, 9090.9 E. neonitida, 11111.1 E.
   punicifolia and 19230.8 E. rotundifolia flowers. In short, the
   reproductive success of the four species is affected by pollination
   efficiency, low seed/ovule ratios and mainly, high predation rates. Mass
   flowering strategy in these species can minimize low reproductive
   efficiency, thus ensuring the maintenance of population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most widely accepted explanations for floral diversification
   in angiosperms is the pollinator-shift model developed by Verne Grant
   and Ledyard Stebbins. According to this model, the most profound changes
   in floral traits (such as morphology, color, patterning and scent) Occur
   when plants undergo adaptive shifts between pollinator classes. We
   tested this model through investigations of geographical variation in
   floral form and pollinator assemblages in the South African annual daisy
   Gorteria diffusa. This species has elaborate insect-like ornaments on
   the capitulum, which attract bee flies belonging to the genus
   Megapalpus. We found unprecedented levels of geographically structured
   intraspecific variation and identified 14 discrete forms that vary in
   the morphology and ornamentation of the capitulum. This variation is not
   clue to phenotypic plasticity because differences among forms were
   maintained in plants grown from seed in a common garden experiment.
   Contrary to predictions from the pollinator-shift model, all
   populations, regardless of floral phenotype, were pollinated primarily
   by a single species of Megapalpus bee fly. Much of the extensive
   variation in floral form in G. diffusa therefore appears to have arisen
   Without evolutionary shifts between pollinator types.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebees fauna (Hymenoptera: Apidae) of the Parc National des

   important group of pollinators in mountain ecosystems. However, factors
   driving their diversity are poorly understood. We investigated
   bumblebees diversity in the Pyrenees National Park (France) as model of
   likely diverse community. Intensive inventories were carried out in
   July-August 2002, 2003 and 2005, which allowed the observation of 5.889
   specimens belonging to 29 bumblebee species. Considering the literature
   of the last fifty years, the specific diversity of the park reaches 30
   bumblebee species, This specific diversity is remarkable and similar to
   other Pyrenean sectors like Eyne or Nohedes valleys
   (Pyrenees-Orientales). The weak difference of diversity observed among
   the Park, the Eyne valley and the Nohedes valley suggests that the
   bumblebee fauna of the all Pyrenees is exceptionally diversified.}},

Abstract = {{Scattered trees are set to be lost from agricultural landscapes within
   the next century without sustained effort to increase recruitment. Thus,
   understanding the reproductive dynamics of scattered tree populations
   will be critical in determining how they can contribute to population
   restoration. The distance between conspecifics should be a key predictor
   of reproductive success, as more isolated trees are expected to receive
   fewer pollinator visits and experience increased transfer of self-pollen
   during longer pollinator foraging bouts. Further, isolation effects
   should be greater in species with less mobile pollinators. Here we
   contrast the effects of plant isolation on reproductive success of two
   species of eucalypt ``paddock trees{''}, Eucalyptus camaldulensis and
   Eucalyptus leucoxylon, with insect- and bird-pollination, respectively.
   Seed production was not affected by tree isolation in either the insect-
   or bird-pollinated species and once outliers were removed, neither was
   there an effect on germination rate. As somatic mutations may bias
   outcrossing rate estimates, we initially screened our microsatellite
   markers for mutations but found no variation in microsatellite profiles
   throughout the canopy of trees. individual outcrossing rates did not
   decline with increasing tree isolation in either the insect- or
   bird-pollinated species, though there was considerable variation in
   these rates at large distances, suggesting that pollination becomes
   unreliable with increasing tree isolation. We found that pollination
   distances have likely increased in tree species in agricultural
   landscapes, and that this may be facilitated by introduced honeybees in
   the case of E. camaldulensis. We therefore suggest that even isolated
   trees of these species produce seed of sufficient quantity and quality
   to contribute to population restoration. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented
   declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in
   the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin
   management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity
   back into intensive grasslands.
   Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we
   manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic
   fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to
   generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing
   management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments
   which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and
   legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed
   cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to
   provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not
   intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated
   block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots
   (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006.
   Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown
   treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The
   diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse
   bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment.
   The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based
   treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of
   adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the
   grass-based treatments.
   Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral
   abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and
   sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly
   larval abundance.
   Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options
   in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and
   butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management
   by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing,
   benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more
   interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both
   approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment
   schemes in the UK and Europe.}},

Abstract = {{A cleptoparasitic mite, the Krombein's hairy-footed mite, Chaetodactylus
   krombeini Baker (Acari, Chaetodactylidae) became a key pest that affects
   the maintenance and propagation of Osmia spp. (Hym., Megachilidae), thus
   disrupting orchard pollination in the United States. Although hypopi,
   the dispersal stages of C. krombeini, are known to disperse from nest to
   nest by hitchhiking on Osmia cornifrons adults, we observed that they
   might disperse in other ways too in commercial orchards. This study was
   conducted to elucidate the nest-to-nest dispersal mechanisms of C.
   krombeini hypopi. We tested three potential dispersal mechanisms of C.
   krombeini other than phoresy by O. cornifrons: (1) dispersal by walking
   from nest to entrances of nearby nests, (2) dispersal by walking from
   nest to nest through emergence holes made by parasitic wasps on nests,
   and (3) dispersal by being unloaded and uptaken to and from flowers by
   O. cornifrons. Results of this study showed that C. krombeini hypopi
   could disperse from a nest to nearby nests by walking through nest
   entrances and holes made by parasitic wasps of O. cornifrons. Although
   0.06\% of C. krombeini hypopi on blueberry flowers were picked up by O.
   cornifrons, they were not able to be unloaded to flowers from O.
   cornifrons and no hypopi could inhabit or survive on blueberry flowers.
   This indicated no or very low chance of C. krombeini hypopi dispersal
   via blueberry flowers. Based on our findings of C. krombeini dispersal
   ecology, development of C. krombeini control strategies are discussed in
   this article.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new, electronic, apparatus for measuring the activity of
   bumblebees as they fly from and to their nests. The bee activity
   recorder (BAR) works on the principle that bees leaving and returning to
   their nest crawl through a tube equipped with infrared emitters and
   detectors so that when the beam is interrupted by the passage of a bee,
   the event is recorded as either an exit or an entry. Tests of BARs
   indicate that they are highly accurate, BAR counts and visual counts
   highly correlated with an almost one-to-one correspondence. We suggest
   that BARs can be used for recording the foraging activities of
   bumblebees through nest exit and entry counts in many practical and
   research applications.}},

Abstract = {{In most developing countries, crop production is by small scale farmers,
   who mainly produce for their own consumption and the extra for market,
   Pollination in such systems is unmanaged and is usually incidental,
   Supported by nearby ecosystems. One of the reasons of not managing
   pollination is the lack of understanding of its economic value. The
   ``public-good{''} nature of pollination in these systems also
   discourages individual initiatives intended to conserve pollinators. We
   evaluate the economic returns from bee pollination in small-holder
   farming systems. To do this we apply the factor of production method, a
   form of revealed preferences methods available for valuing ecosystem
   services. Our analyses show that bee pollination enhances the yield of
   most crops grown in the farmland and improves immensely the quality of
   produce. Almost 40\% of the annual value of crops under consideration
   represented the net returns derived from bee pollination. More than 99\%
   of this benefit is attributed to pollination by feral bees. We provide
   in-depth valuation of pollination service and discuss applicability and
   limitations of the factor of production method in developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{Recent declines in managed and feral honey bee populations have greatly
   increased interest in the current and potential role of wild pollinators
   in agricultural pollination. Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.) has great
   potential to be served by wild pollinators because of a reliable and
   widespread group of bee species that are commonly associated with their
   flowers, including bumble bees (Bombus spp.), and, in the Americas, two
   genera of specialist ground nesting bees (Peponapis and Xenoglossa). We
   examined the effects of several key fat-m management practices and
   landscape variables on bee abundance in pumpkin on 20 farms in Virginia
   and Maryland during summer 2006. We evaluated bee abundance with respect
   to tillage, irrigation practices, soil properties, natural habitat
   (forest and grassland), flowering crop, and disturbed areas.
   Additionally, we examined nest site preference (within or outside of
   crop areas) of Peponapis pruinosa (Say) at one farm and in a large
   screenhouse. We found P. pruinosa nesting preferentially within crop
   areas and near the vines and leaves of their host plant. Although these
   bees typically place some of their brood cells within tillage depth, we
   did not find a tillage effect on their abundance at flowers. We found a
   negative effect of soil clay content (R-2 = 0.24, P = 0.03) and a
   positive effect of irrigation (F-1,F- 15 = 12.2; P < 0.001) on P.
   pruinosa abundance. Using published data on pollinator visitation
   requirements, we found wild bee densities were sufficient to fully
   pollinate all pumpkin flowers on 13-17 of the 20 farms studied.}},

Abstract = {{In many nectarless flowering plants, pollen serves as both the carrier
   of male gametes and as food for pollinators. This can generate an
   evolutionary conflict if the use of pollen as food by pollinators
   reduces the number of gametes available for cross-fertilization.
   Heteranthery, the production of two or more stamen types by individual
   flowers reduces this conflict by allowing different stamens to
   specialize in `pollinating' and `feeding' functions. We used
   experimental studies of Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae) and theoretical
   models to investigate this `division of labour' hypothesis. Flight cage
   experiments with pollinating bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) demonstrated
   that although feeding anthers are preferentially manipulated by bees,
   pollinating anthers export more pollen to other flowers. Evolutionary
   stability analysis of a model of pollination by pollen consumers
   indicated that heteranthery evolves when bees consume more pollen than
   should optimally be exchanged for visitation services, particularly when
   pollinators adjust their visitation according to the amount of pollen
   collected.}},

Abstract = {{The bee tribe Ceratinini is important for understanding early stages in
   social evolution. Their extant sister tribe Allodapini contains no
   strictly solitary species, and while some Ceratinini are commonly
   regarded as solitary, little behavioural data exist to substantiate
   this. Studies on Asian congeners have shown recurrent sociality in
   temperate and subtropical ranges while behavioural data are lacking in
   tropical regions. Field work along the west coast of Borneo in Sarawak,
   Malaysia, has provided some insight into these tropical taxa. Here we
   describe the nesting biology and social behaviour of four taxonomically
   described yet behaviourally unclassified Ceratina species. These four
   species are from three subgencra, namely Ceratina (Ceratinidia)
   accusator Cockerell, C (Ceratinidia) nigrolateralis Cockerell, C.
   (Neoceratina) dentipes Friese, C (Pithitis) smaragdula Fabricius. Nests
   of all species were typically attended by an adult female while all
   species except C accusator had a low frequency of multi-female nesting
   assemblages. The four tropical ceratinines described here and all other
   behaviourally classified species exhibit recurrent patterns of maternal
   care, maternal longevity, and nest protection. Prolonged parental care
   found across the genus and occasional transitions into sociality make
   Ceratina of future interest for the study of life history and social
   evolution.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural habitats provide essential resources for pollinators within
   agricultural landscapes and may help maintain pollination services in
   agroecosystems. Yet, whether or not pollinators disperse from
   semi-natural habitat elements into the adjacent agricultural matrix may
   to a large extent depend on the quality of this matrix and the
   corresponding pollinator-specific life history traits. To investigate
   the effects of matrix quality on the distance decay of wild bees and
   hoverflies, six transects along vegetated field tracks originating at a
   large semi-natural main habitat and leading into the adjacent
   agricultural matrix were established in the Wetterau Region, central
   Hesse, Germany. Species richness of wild bees did not change with
   distance from the main habitat in landscapes with sufficient grassland
   cover in the surrounding landscape, but significantly declined when
   semi-natural grasslands where scarce and isolated in the adjacent
   agricultural matrix. Abundance of wild bees declined with distance
   regardless of matrix quality. Species richness of hoverflies did not
   decline with increasing distance in any landscape. Abundance even
   increased with distance to the main habitat independently of matrix
   quality. Thus, our data show that taxa of the pollinator guild may
   perceive landscapes quite differently. Because of their differing
   dispersal modes and resource requirements as compared to wild bees,
   hoverflies may play an important role in maintaining pollination
   services in agricultural landscapes unsuitable for bee species. Our
   results highlight the need for considering these taxon-specific
   differences when predicting the effect of landscape structure on
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The oil-secreting orchids of southern Africa belong to the sub-tribe
   Coryciinae within Diseae. A phylogeny of Diseae is inferred using
   sequence data from all genera in the tribe, with an emphasis on
   resolving generic classifications within Coryciinae. Nuclear (ITS) and
   plastid (trnLF and matK) gene region sequences were analysed for 79
   ingroup taxa and three outgroup taxa. Coryciinae is confirmed to be
   diphyletic, with Disperis and Coryciinae sensu stricto (s.s.) forming
   separate monophyletic clades. The current genera Corycium and
   Pterygodium are not monophyletic according to our analysis and we
   propose a subdivision of Coryciinae s.s. into 10 monophyletic clades
   including three monotypic groups. Previous generic classifications of
   Coryciinae s.s. have been hampered by convergent evolution of floral
   parts, a consequence of few pollinator species and limited pollinia
   attachment sites in the oil-bee pollination system common to this group.

Abstract = {{The European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, is an invasive eusocial
   species whose distribution is expanding greatly beyond its native range
   because numerous colonies are imported to or locally produced in
   non-native countries for pollination of agricultural crops. Closely
   related species exist in Japan where the unrestricted import and use of
   B. terrestris has resulted in the establishment of wild colonies.
   Laboratory studies previously showed that B. terrestris and Japanese
   native species can copulate and produce fertilized eggs. Although these
   eggs do not hatch, the interspecific mating can cause a serious
   reproductive disturbance to native bumblebees. In this study, we
   determined the frequencies of interspecies mating between B. terrestris
   males and native bumblebee queens in the wild on the islands of Hokkaido
   and Honshu by analyzing the DNA sequences of spermatozoa stored in
   spermathecae of native queens. We found that 20.2\% of B. hypocrita
   hypocrita queens and 30.2\% of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queens had
   spermatozoa of B. terrestris males in their spermathecae. Given that a
   Bombus queen generally mates only once in her life, such high
   frequencies of interspecific mating with B. terrestris pose serious
   threats to the populations of native bumblebees in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine vegetation occurs over a wide range of ecological conditions.
   Thus, the breeding systems of alpine plants are likely to be diverse and
   vary from one geographical area to another. The reproductive
   characteristics of Nastanthus spathulatus (Calyceraceae) and Rhodophiala
   rhodolirion (Amaryllidaceae), species with contrasting floral
   morphology, were studied in the high Andes of Chile, which has a
   Mediterranean-type climate. Natural and supplemental open pollination,
   and cross pollination and self-pollination trials were carried out in
   the field. Flower visitors were quantified by field and video
   observations. Both species had high outcrossing properties, and
   Nastanthus was strongly self-incompatible. Rhodophiala could form some
   seed by self-pollination, but fruit and seed sets were much lower after
   self-pollination compared with outcrossing. The phenology and
   flower/inflorescence forms of these species supported the view that
   alpine flowers are comparatively long lived and that the floral display
   contributes to a large proportion of the plant biomass. Rhodophiala was
   well attended by a native bee species (Megachile sauleyi) that was
   appropriately sized for efficient pollination. Although no flower
   visitors were observed on Nastanthus and wind pollination was discarded
   experimentally, a high proportion of the flowers produced seeds under
   natural pollination. Therefore, the seed set was not severely pollen
   limited in these species. Including previously published information,
   breeding systems are now known for 12 species on this Mediterranean
   alpine site and current knowledge suggests an emphasis on outcrossing
   breeding systems.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of the common shrub Pultenaea villosa Willd. was
   examined in a subtropical dry sclerophyll forest in eastern Australia.
   We determined floral phenology and morphology, the timing of stigma
   receptivity and anther dehiscence, nectar availability, the plant
   breeding system, and flower visitors. The shrub's flowers are typical
   zygomorphic pea flowers with hidden floral rewards and reproductive
   structures. These flowers require special manipulation for insect
   access. A range of insects visited the flowers, although bees are
   predicted to be the principle pollinators based on their frequency on
   the flowers and their exclusive ability to operate the wing and keel
   petals to access the reproductive structures. Nectar and pollen are
   offered as rewards and were actively collected by bees. Nectar is
   offered to visitors in minute amounts at the base of the corolla. In
   Toohey Forest, A villosa flowers in spring and is the most abundant
   floral resource in the understory of the forest at this time. The
   breeding system experiment revealed that P. villosa requires outcrossing
   for high levels of seed set and that the overlap of stigma receptivity
   and pollen dehiscence within the flower suggests the potential for
   self-incompatibility.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN SYSTEMATIC BOTANY}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Diuris is a terrestrial orchid genus of at least 61 and possibly more
   than 100 species, restricted to Australia except for one species endemic
   in Timor. Distinctive species groups have respective eastern and western
   centres of distribution. Although species affinities have been vaguely
   understood for many years, no formal infrageneric treatment has been
   undertaken as Diuris possesses few reliable morphological characters for
   a classification system. We have undertaken cladistic parsimony and
   Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of Diuris by using the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2
   region of nuclear rDNA and morphological characters, with a subset of
   samples also studied by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) as
   an independent test of phylogenetic relationships. Four major clades
   with strong bootstrap support were resolved and are named here according
   to a recently published classification; D. sulphurea forms a lineage
   (subg. Paradiuris) of its own that is well supported as the sister to
   the rest of Diuris. Two other major eastern clades contained species
   related to D. maculata (subg. Xanthodiuris) and D. punctata (subg.
   Diuris), respectively. Although these latter two subgenera are
   genetically well resolved, there is minimal genetic variation at species
   level, consistent with recent, rapid speciation. A fourth clade (subg.
   Hesperodiuris) has a centre of distribution in Western Australia, and
   has more genetic and morphological variation than the eastern subgenera.
   Total evidence analysis provides support for the western clade being
   sister group to the two eastern subgenera Diuris and Xanthodiuris;
   however, this relationship was not resolved by molecular data.
   Hybridisation is known to be common among species within subgenera
   Diuris and Xanthodiuris. Instances of incongruence between different
   datasets were found suggestive of hybridisation events between species
   of different sections of Diuris.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental changes, such as current climate warming, can exert
   directional selection on reproductive phenology. In plants, evolution of
   earlier flowering requires that the individuals bearing genes for early
   flowering successfully reproduce; for non-selfing, zoophilous species,
   this means that early flowering individuals must be visited by
   pollinators. In a laboratory experiment with artificial flowers, we
   presented captive bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) with flower arrays
   representing stages in the phenological progression of a two-species
   plant community: Bees that had been foraging on flowers of one colour
   were confronted with increasing numbers of flowers of a second colour.
   Early flowering individuals of the second `species' were significantly
   under-visited, because bees avoided unfamiliar flowers, particularly
   when these were rare. We incorporated these aspects of bee foraging
   behaviour (neophobia and positive frequency dependence) in a simulation
   model of flowering-time evolution for a plant population experiencing
   selection against late flowering. Unlike simple frequency dependence, a
   lag in pollinator visitation prevented the plant population from
   responding to selection and led to declines in population size.
   Pollinator behaviour thus has the potential to constrain evolutionary
   adjustments of flowering phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Ptilothrix plumata is a solitary bee, oligolectic on Malvaceae. In this
   study we evaluate its oligoletic behavior through quantitative and
   qualitative analyses of larval provisioning in the National Park of
   Catimbau, Brazil. Quantitative pollen analysis showed that, to feed one
   larva, females collect pollen from an average of 17.2 flowers of Pavonia
   cancellata, 8.5 flowers of P. varians, 4.8 flowers of P. humifusa and
   12.4 flowers of Sida galheirensis. Preference for pollen of Pavonia
   seems to be characteristic for the species and is even more accentuated
   when considering the volumes of the very large Pavonia pollen grains in
   the pollen mass: more than 90\% of total pollen volume of larval food
   was from Pavonia species. Comparison to food preferences of P. plumata
   at other sites shows that the degree of specialization also depends on
   the composition of plant species at a given locality and a local
   seemingly monolectic relationship may result from missing opportunities
   for choice.}},

Abstract = {{Historic data in the form of pinned specimens in entomological
   collections offer the potential to determine trends in genetic diversity
   of bumble bees (Bombus). We screened eight microsatellite loci in pinned
   bumble bee specimens from the U. S. National Pollinating Insects
   Collection. We tested three species (Bombus appositus, Bombus huntii and
   Bombus occidentalis) representing three subgenera of bumble bees
   (Subterraneobombus, Pyrobombus and Bombus sensu stricto) respectively.
   Bombus occidentalis is a species of particular concern for conservation
   biologists. Single mid-legs of ninety-six individuals from each species
   were assayed to determine microsatellite amplification success rates of
   historic material in a museum collection. Microsatellite alleles
   amplified in specimens up to 101 years old, but the rate of
   amplification success was significantly lower in material over 60 years
   of age. Loci with shorter allele sizes amplified more frequently than
   relatively longer alleles in samples from all age classes. We correlate
   the age of specimens to the age at which loci fail to amplify and
   discuss potential impacts of using certain markers for population
   genetic studies of museum specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Flower visitors learn to avoid food-deceptive plants and to prefer
   rewarding ones by associating floral cues to rewards. As co-occurring
   plant species have different phenologies, cue-reward associations vary
   over time. It is not known how these variations affect flower visitors'
   foraging costs and learning. We trained bumblebees of two colonies to
   forage in a community of deceptive and rewarding artificial
   inflorescences whose flower colours were either similar or dissimilar.
   We then modified the community composition by turning the rewarding
   inflorescences into unrewarding and adding rewarding inflorescences of a
   novel flower colour. In the short term, bees trained to similar rather
   than dissimilar inflorescences experienced higher costs of foraging
   (decreased foraging speed and accuracy) in the novel community. The
   colonies differed in their speed-accuracy trade-off. In the longer term,
   bees adapted their foraging behaviour to the novel community composition
   by increasingly visiting the novel rewarding inflorescences.}},

Volume = {{159}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Grobya amherstiae flowers release a honey-like scent produced by an
   osmophore, comprising a papillate epidermis. The scent attracts bee
   pollinators (Paratetrapedia fervida), which collect floral oils produced
   by elaiophores on the lip apex and column base. The secretory tissue of
   the elaiophore on the lip apex consists of both palisade-like epidermal
   cells and conspicuously elongated unicellular trichomes. From an
   anatomical point of view, this elaiophore differs in structure from
   those known in angiosperms to date. The elaiophore on the column base is
   exclusively composed of short unicellular trichomes. In addition, there
   is an elaiophore comprising a papillate epidermis on the internal
   surface of the lip. The elaiophores produce a heterogeneous secretion,
   composed of fatty acids and mucilage. The elaiophore on the internal
   surface of the lip produces oil in non-collectible amounts, but it is
   enough to maintain the interest of the bees, guiding them to the
   elaiophore on the column base, a necessary step in pollination. The
   former elaiophore is here identified as an oil guide and it plays an
   essential role in ensuring pollination. The presence of three types of
   elaiophores on the flowers of this species of Orchidaceae is peculiar
   and noteworthy. (C) 2009 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical

Abstract = {{Flower size dimensions, colour, and nectar quantities potentially
   account for differences in pollinator species between Penstemon
   centranthifolius (Benth.) Benth. (tubular, red, nectar-rich, hummingbird
   pollinated) and Penstemon spectabilis Thurber (wide, purple,
   nectar-poor, hymenopteran pollinated). For this study, floral characters
   and pollinator attraction were measured for the two species, F-1
   hybrids, and backcrosses. Floral dimensions, nectar characters, and
   color spectra combined in the hybrids in a largely linear fashion,
   consistent with an interpretation of net additive gene expression. In
   other words, the changes from one pollination syndrome to another
   appeared to be quantitative. There were some deviations from linearity,
   but not so much as to obscure the linear effect. Generally, backcrosses
   were not more variable than F-1 hybrids or pure parents. Hummingbirds
   preferred P. centranthifolius over P. spectabilis. The strength of this
   preference varied by year, and the birds did not respond to hybrids in a
   strictly linear fashion. When there was a preference, adding nectar
   hourly to under-visited plants quickly changed the foraging of
   hummingbirds. Bees in the genus Ceratina preferred the bee-pollination
   syndrome of P. spectabilis.}},

   verify abundance and spatial distribution of the nests and patterns of
   the plants used as nesting sites. Seventy-three nests of 15 species were
   found. The most abundant species were Partamona chapadicola Pedro \&
   Camargo, 2003 (34,25\%) and Oxytrigona sp. 2 (20,55\%). Eleven tree
   species were used as nesting sites. The most common host tree species
   was Qualea parviflora (Vochysiaceae) where 38,36\% of the nests (n=28)
   nestled, followed by Salvertia convallariodora (Vochysiaceae) (n=17,
   23,29\%). The 95\% confidence interval of DHB was between 36,21 cm and
   41,68 cm. This interval is related with older trees that should have
   more hollows to be used as nesting sites. This process might be
   occurring with S. convallariodora and Q. parviflora. The patterns of
   spatial distribution for study sites 1 and 2 were random and the pattern
   for study site 3 was uniform. Random pattern would be a sign for absence

   Number of seeds, flesh and juice ratio of fruit were different
   significantly, whereas, hardness and compressive strength of pericarp
   were not different significantly among fruiting methods. There were not
   significant differences among fruiting methods on soluble solids,
   acidity content, ratio of fruit reduction, and occurrence ratio of
   unmarketable fruit of investigated tornatoes on the 7th day after
   harvest. It is not easy to distinguish the difference of pericarp color
   with naked eye among the fruiting methods or between varieties because,
   L{*} value is low and a{*}, b{*} value is closed together at the same
   position of L{*}a{*}b{*} color chart. So, it is not supported that
   storage quality was decreased and pericarp color was changed dark-red in
   bee pollination treatment. There were not significant differences in
   thickness and state of pericarp observed by microscope among fruiting
   methods or between varieties. Therefore, it was considered that the bee
   fruiting method is good because fruit quality was not different
   significantly among fruiting methods or between varieties.}},

Abstract = {{The bees of subtribe Euglossina are an important component of
   neotropical fauna and have greater species diversity in tropical forests
   than in spits. They play an important role in the pollination of several
   plant species and are considered good indicators of environmental
   conditions. From February 2005 to January 2006, a total of 429 specimens
   belonging to three genera {[}Euglossa (Latreille), Eulaema (Lepeletier)
   and Eufriesea (Cockerell)] and 14 species were collected. Eulaema
   cingulata (Fabricius) (24.5\%), Euglossa cordata (L.) (20.5\%) and
   Eufriesea nigrescens (Friese) (19.8\%) were the most abundant species,
   representing 64.8\% of all bees collected. Rainfall was the
   environmental variable with the greatest relative influence on species
   composition, particularly for some species of Eufriesea. Euglossa
   cordata and Eg. gaianii Dressler nested in trap nests, suggesting they
   are resident species. The larger number of individuals and greater
   richness of species compared with data available in the literature may
   result from the great variety of plant species found in the areas
   adjacent to the collection site.}},

Abstract = {{A new treatment protocol was developed to analyze pollen residues found
   in nests of Centris tarsata Smith harvested from nest-traps. The study
   area was located in the Canudos Biological Station in the municipality
   of Canudos (09 degrees 56'34{''}S; 38 degrees 59'17{''} W), in the
   northeastern micro-region of Bahia State, Brazil. The local vegetation
   is an open caatinga (deciduous dryland vegetation), the regional climate
   is semi-arid, the average annual temperature is 24.1 degrees C, and the
   annual regional rainfall rate is 454 mm. Ten nests of C. tarsata were
   collected in trap-nests during the first semester of 2004. Pollen
   analysis from the nests required the development of a new methodology
   that combined techniques of palynological sediment analysis with the
   more common pollinic analysis by acetolysis. Microscopic analyses
   employed optical microscopy techniques. The pollinic spectrum of the
   samples from C. tarsata indicated the presence of 17 pollen types from
   seven plant families, which were present in assemblage of five to eleven
   pollen types, pointed to the plants used by bees to feed on their
   offspring. The most represented plant families were Leguminosae (49.3\%)
   and Solanaceae (43.2\%). The most frequent pollen types in the samples
   were from Solanum paniculatum (43.8\%) and Senna rizzini (32.1\%). The
   protocol developed provides a new tool for diet assessment of Centris
   and other groups of solitary bees.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{159}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of the effects of introduced invasive pollinators on
   plants has been exclusively drawn from studies on introduced social
   bees. One might expect, however, that the impacts of introduced solitary
   bees, with much lower population densities and fewer foragers, would be
   small. Yet little is known about the potential effects of naturalized
   solitary bees on the environment. We took advantage of the recent
   naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, in southern
   Florida to study the effects of this solitary bee on reproduction of
   Solanum torvum, an invasive shrub. Flowers of S. torvum require
   specialized buzz pollination. Through timed floral visitor watches and
   two pollination treatments (control and pollen supplementation) at three
   forest edge and three open area sites, we found that the fruit set of S.
   torvum was pollen limited at the open sites where the native bees
   dominate, but was not pollen limited at the forest sites where the
   invasive orchid bees dominate. The orchid bee's pollination efficiency
   was nearly double that of the native halictid bees, and was also
   slightly higher than that of the native carpenter bee. Experiments using
   small and large mesh cages (to deny or allow E. viridissima access,
   respectively) at one forest site indicated that when the orchid bee was
   excluded, the flowers set one-quarter as many fruit as when the bee was
   allowed access. The orchid bee was the most important pollinator of the
   weed at the forest sites, which could pose additional challenges to the
   management of this weed in the fragmented, endangered tropical hardwood
   forests in the region. This specialized invasive mutualism may promote
   populations of both the orchid bee and this noxious weed. Invasive
   solitary bees, particularly species that are specialized pollinators,
   appear to have more importance than has previously been recognized.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar robbers access floral nectar in illegitimate flower visits
   without, in general, performing a pollination service. Nevertheless,
   their effect on fruit set can be indirectly positive if the nectar
   removal causes an incremental increase in the frequency of legitimate
   flower visits of effective pollinators, especially in obligate
   outcrossers. We studied pollination and the effect of nectar robbers on
   the reproductive fitness of Jacaranda rugosa, an endemic shrub of the
   National Park of Catimbau, in the Caatinga of Pernambuco, Brazil.
   Xenogamous J. rugosa flowers continuously produced nectar during the day
   at a rate of 1 mu l.h(-1). Female and male Euglossa melanotricha were
   the main pollinators. Early morning flower visits substantially
   contributed to fruit set because stigmas with open lobes were almost
   absent in the afternoon. Ninety-nine per cent of the flowers showed
   damage caused by nectar robbers. Artificial addition of sugar water
   prolonged the duration of flower visits of legitimate flower visitors.
   Removal of nectar, simulating the impact of nectar robbers, resulted in
   shorter flower visits of euglossine bees. While flower visits of
   nectar-robbing carpenter bees (Xylocopa frontalis, X. grisescens, X.
   ordinaria) produced only a longitudinal slit in the corolla tube in the
   region of the nectar chamber, worker bees of Trigona spinipes damaged
   the gynoecium in 92\% of the flowers. This explains the outstandingly
   low fruit set (1.5\%) of J. rugosa in the National Park of Catimbau.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies of 13 of the estimated 17 species of the southern African
   geophytic genus Ferraria (Iridaceae: Iridoideae) identified four
   distinct pollination systems. Ferraria flowers are radially symmetric
   and cupped with a large, mostly pale or dull-colored perianth. Perigonal
   nectaries secrete hexose dominant (fructose and glucose) nectar. Most
   species are pollinated by Diptera of four families, apparently attracted
   by strong floral odors, mostly putrid or fermenting, but sometimes
   apparently sweet, and a large perianth mottled and edged with dark
   color. Concentrated sugary secretions are produced on the tepal claws
   that form a shallow floral cup. In contrast, flowers of F. ferrariola
   have a deep, narrow floral cup, a pale blue or yellow perianth, and a
   spicy scent and are pollinated by bees in the family Apidae, rewarded by
   nectar of moderate sugar concentration. Ferraria divaricata and F.
   variabilis have dull-colored, darkly speckled or streaked perianths and
   produce ample, highly dilute nectar pooled at the base of the floral cup
   and are pollinated by eumenid and masarine wasps (Vespidae). Lastly, F.
   uncinata has flowers with a narrow floral cup and dull violet tepals
   with brown margins. They are visited only by meloid and melyrid beetles.
   All pollen transfers from the anther of a Ferraria flower to an insect's
   body are passive, regardless of pollinator. Pollen load analyses
   suggests that all pollinators show a high degree of faithfulness to
   Ferraria flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Sparattosperma leucanthum (Vell.) K. Schum. (Bignoniaceae) is a tree
   pollinated by carpenter bees, although other floral visitors also
   explore the nectar or pollen of the flowers without exerting any
   reproductive benefit. This study focused on aspects of the pollination
   system and attempted to infer whether the inter-plant spacing found in
   the sampled area and the number of flowers produced by the tree limited
   pollination by crossbreeding with S. leucanthum. Reproductive tests were
   carried out to obtain fruit-flower relationship, counting of the number
   of seeds per fruit and number of trees in the transects sampled and
   estimate of the number of flowers per tree. S. leucanthum is
   self-incompatible and needs floral visitors to carry out pollination,
   since it only reproduces by crossbreeding. The fruit-flower relationship
   obtained was 0.0054, indicating a high energy cost attributed to the
   floral visitors' low efficiency in promoting pollination. The
   inter-plant distance was relatively shorter than the maximum distance
   traveled by the carpenter bees, while the trees produced few flowers per
   inflorescence and in moderate intensity, helping the pollination process
   by crossbreeding accomplished by the carpenter bees. However, the fruits
   produced a large number of seeds, allowing a wide proliferation of S.

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships among and within the major groups of bees
   (Apoidea Apiformes) were recently reconsidered using extensive molecular
   and morphological datasets. The next step in the study of bee evolution
   will consist in estimating the antiquity of the nodes within the
   inferred topologies. We describe here the third oldest bee fossil,
   Paleohabropoda oudardi gen. n. sp. n. (Apidae, Apinae, Anthophorini)
   from the Paleocene of Menat (France, Puyde-Dome; 60 Myr). Phylogenetic
   analysis of 17 morphological characters and morphometric analysis of the
   wing shape were used to recover, respectively, its taxonomic position
   and morphological affinities. Our results indicate that Paleohabropoda
   oudardi gen. n. sp. n. clearly belongs to the Anthophorini.
   Paleohabropoda is therefore the oldest fossil that can be confidently

   for the right target: oviposition and feeding behavior in Bombylius bee
   flies (Diptera: Bombyliidae). Zoological Studies 48(2): 141-150. Bee
   flies (Diptera: Bombyliidae) are ectoparasitoids of larval stages of
   insects, often digger bees and wasps. We studied the behavior of 4
   species of the genus Bombylius at a nest aggregation of their host bee,
   Lasioglossum malachurum Kirby, and at an adjacent feeding site. Although
   eggs were frequently thrown on vegetation patches, the number of eggs
   oviposited and the time spent in hovering flight were higher at host
   nest entrances. Bombylius females fed essentially on 3 (2
   Caryophyllaceae and 1 Asteraceae) of 9 blooming plant species found in
   the area. Oviposition and feeding activities had different daily
   distributions. In general agreement with optimal foraging theories,
   Bombylius females exhibited the strongest interest in the predicted
   target, i.e., the host nest, and fed essentially on a few but highly
   exploited plants in the close vicinity of the host nesting site.

Abstract = {{For animals to execute odor-driven behaviors, the olfactory system must
   process complex odor signals and maintain stimulus identity in the face
   of constantly changing odor intensities {[}1-5]. Surprisingly, how the
   olfactory system maintains identity of complex odors is unclear
   {[}6-10]. We took advantage of the plant-pollinator relationship between
   the Sacred Datura (Datura wrightii) and the moth Manduca sexta {[}11,
   12] to determine how olfactory networks in this insect's brain represent
   odor mixtures. We combined gas chromatography and neural-ensemble
   recording in the moth's antennal lobe to examine population codes for
   the floral mixture and its fractionated components. Although the floral
   scent of D. wrightii comprises at least 60 compounds, only nine of those
   elicited robust neural responses. Behavioral experiments confirmed that
   these nine odorants mediate flower-foraging behaviors, but only as a
   mixture. Moreover, the mixture evoked equivalent foraging behaviors over
   a 1000-fold range in dilution, suggesting a singular percept across this
   concentration range. Furthermore, neural-ensemble recordings in the
   moth's antennal lobe revealed that reliable encoding of the floral
   mixture is organized through synchronized activity distributed across a
   population of glomerular coding units, and this timing mechanism may
   bind the features of a complex stimulus into a coherent odor percept.}},

Abstract = {{Adhatoda vasica Nees. (Acanthaceae) is an important and widely used
   medicinal plant. The flowers last for 3-5 days, they are protandrous and
   pass through three distinct phases: male, bisexual and female. Two
   species of carpenter bees, Xylocopa verticalis and Xylocopa sp. are the
   effective pollinators. Pollen grains are deposited on the dorsal surface
   of the thorax during Xylocopa visit to the flowers in the male phase,
   and the stigma rubs the pollen-coated thorax and is pollinated when the
   bees visit the flowers in bisexual and female phases. There is a high
   level of geitonogamy. Pollination efficiency under field conditions is
   high (95\%). However, fruit set is poor (6\%). The species is
   self-incompatible. None of the self-pollinated flowers sets fruits, but
   over 50\% of the cross-pollinated flowers sets fruits. The results
   indicate that protandry does not prevent self-pollination, but reduces
   interference in export and import of pollen. Although the flowers have
   adapted well to achieve a high level of pollination, reproductive
   success in terms of fruit set is low, largely due to the limitation of
   compatible pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Despite scientific ant, media attention on pollinator declines, there is
   still only a rudimentary understanding of the response of bees-the most
   important group of pollinators worldwide-to ongoing land use changes.
   Euglossine bees are an ecologically important Neotropical clade of
   forest-dependent pollinators. Despite the fact that euglossines are well
   studied relative to other groups of tropical bees, only three previous
   studies, all from Brazil, address the response of euglossines to forest
   fragmentation. In this study, I tripled the maximum sample size of
   previous efforts by sampling male euglossines in 22 forest fragments
   ranging in area from 0.25 ha to 230 ha in southern Costa Rica, using
   chemically baited Van Somerer, traps. Abundance of euglossine bees was
   significantly positively related to forest fragment size, negatively
   related to shape (edge:area ratio), and marginally related to fragment
   isolation. Euglossine species richness showed similar, but weaker
   trends: richness was significantly positively related to the quantity of
   forest edge, marginally negatively related to fragment area, and not
   related to fragment isolation. The positive relationship between
   euglossine richness and abundance and forest fragment edge is consistent
   with other studies that have found high euglossine density in secondary
   or disturbed forest. The data suggest that individual euglossines move
   between forest fragments, as has been shown in other systems. Still,
   forest fragmentation appears to affect euglossine bees more strongly
   than other bee groups in the study region. Their large flight range and
   positive relationship with forest edges may help to buffer the negative
   effects of fragmentation, allowing euglossines to utilize even the very
   smallest forest fragments in the study area. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although nectar robbing is a common phenomenon in plant species with
   tubular flowers or flowers with nectar spurs, the potential effect of
   this illegitimate interaction on plant reproductive success has not
   received the deserved attention. In the present study, we analysed the
   functional relationship between flower morphology and nectar robbing,
   and examined the reproductive consequences of the interaction in a
   population of Duranta erecta (Verbenaceae) on the island of Cuba. The
   results show that nectar robbing is conducted by the carpenter bees
   Xylocopa cubaecola and affects up to 44\% of flowers in the studied
   population. However, not all the flowers have the same probability of
   being robbed. The chance of flowers being robbed increases with flower
   length and flower diameter. Moreover, nectar robbing significantly
   decreases the chance that flowers will set fruit. Also, the impact of
   nectar robbing on the probability of flowers to set fruits is dependent
   on the plant. We suggest that nectar robbing may represent an opposite
   selective force that balances the selection for longer corollas often
   imposed by pollinators specializing in visiting tubular flowers. Such a
   relationship with nectar robbers would have obvious implications for the
   evolution of tubular or closed flowers. This preliminary finding
   deserves further research in light of the ecological and evolutionary
   consequences of nectar robbing in tubular flowers. (C) 2009 The Linnean

Abstract = {{Bees are frequent visitors to plants that, on the basis of floral
   traits, would be expected to be specialized for bird pollination. We
   conducted bird exclusion experiments to establish the contribution that
   bees make to the female component of pollination success of five
   ``ornithophilous'' Aloe species in the succulent-rich subtropical
   thicket vegetation in southeastern South Africa. Experiments showed that
   all five aloes are genetically self-incompatible and require
   cross-pollination for seed set. Seed set in flowers exposed to both bird
   and bee visitors was generally severalfold higher than in flowers
   exposed to bee visitors only. The magnitude of this effect varied
   greatly among species and was affected by floral traits and bee
   behavior. In three aloes where the relatively short corolla tubes are
   blocked by exserted filaments, bees made a negligible contribution to
   seed production. However, in two aloes with long tubular flowers and
   included filaments, bees often crawled into the perianth tube to obtain
   nectar and contributed to seed production. Pollen-collecting honeybees
   contribute the least to pollination and may even impact negatively on
   aloe reproductive success by acting as pollen thieves.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a vital ecosystem service, which is endangered by the
   ongoing declines of pollinators. These declines also affect bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.), which are important generalist pollinators in
   agricultural landscapes. Most studies focussing on the conservation of
   bumblebees have investigated the effects of local flower-rich habitats
   on bumblebee density and diversity. However, bumblebee densities do not
   necessarily correlate with the colonies' reproductive success (i.e. the
   presence or absence of males and/or queens).
   We analysed the effects of landscape-wide availability of mass flowering
   oilseed rape Brassica napus on the growth and sexual reproduction of
   Bombus terrestris colonies. Thirty-two young colonies were established
   and monitored in different resource environments represented by 16
   landscapes (circular study areas with 3000 m radius) with large or small
   amounts of oilseed rape. As an indicator of colony growth, we used
   weight gain, which was strongly correlated with the numbers of brood
   cells in the colonies.
   The colonies gained significantly more weight in study areas with large
   amounts of oilseed rape particularly during early colony stages.
   Despite early weight gain, the colonies in study areas with large
   amounts of oilseed rape did not reproduce more successfully. The
   frequencies of colonies that produced males and/or queens did not differ
   between the two resource environments.
   Synthesis and applications. Early mass flowering oilseed rape has a
   beneficial effect on colony growth, which however, does not translate
   into a greater likelihood of colonies producing sexual offspring. This
   may be due to food plant scarcity later in the colony cycle.
   Conservation measures should enhance food plant availability in
   agricultural landscapes, particularly during the most critical phases of
   the colony cycle: the colony establishment in spring and the
   reproductive phase in mid- to late summer.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Within highly modified European landscapes, limestone quarries can act
   as important secondary habitats for a range of endangered wild bee
   species. However, the relative influence of quarry habitat area, habitat
   age and within-habitat diversity on the conservation value of these
   secondary habitats is mainly unknown.
   We assessed species richness and abundance of wild bees by variable
   transect walks in 24 limestone quarries ranging in size from 0.01 to
   21.2 ha. Species traits such as social status, resource specialization
   and nesting substrate were used to define functional guilds of bees.
   In total, 41\% of all wild bee species known from southern Lower Saxony,
   Germany, were found in the studied quarries. Total species richness
   increased with habitat area but, in contrast to our expectations, not
   with habitat age, although we tested an age gradient of over 120 years.
   Solitary species were more strongly affected by decreasing habitat area
   than social species but response did not differ with respect to habitat
   age.
   Hierarchical partitioning analyses revealed that habitat area per se,
   within-habitat diversity and sampling effort were of similar importance
   in explaining species richness patterns.
   Synthesis and applications. Even newly created limestone quarries
   provide an important secondary habitat for wild bees. Therefore,
   maintenance and management of secondary succession of these sites should
   be given high priority in species conservation plans. Landscape
   management schemes involving filling or flooding such quarries should be
   prevented.}},

Abstract = {{Acerola (Malpighia emarginata DC; Malpighiaceae) is an important fruit
   crop in Brazil. Among its pollinators, Centris (Heterocentris) analis
   (F.) stands out due to its abundance at flowers and prompt acceptance of
   trap-nets. For the first time, we propose the commercial use of Centris
   bees as orchard pollinators. To develop protocols for rearing and
   management of these bees, we analyzed trap-nest acceptance, brood-cell
   construction, and larval diet in Acerola orchards. Although Centris
   species, in general, use numerous pollen host plants, females of C.
   analis showed remarkable flower fidelity to Acerola for pollen supply
   when nesting in the orchard. Such fidelity was previously expected only
   for floral oil collection. The ease of acceptance of trap-nests by
   females of C. analis, their prolonged yearly activity period,
   multivoltine life history, and high pollinator efficiency characterize
   C. analis as an excellent potentially manageable pollinator in Acerola
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Andrena hattorfiana is a rare solitary bee which has declined during the
   last decades throughout western Europe. It is specialised to forage
   pollen from plants of the family Dipsacaceae. Knowledge of distribution,
   dispersal propensity, and local population sizes is essential for
   successful conservation of A. hattorfiana. The investigated local bee
   populations (n = 78) were dominated by small local populations and 60\%
   were smaller than 10 female individuals and 80\% were smaller than 50
   female individuals. The area of the median occupied habitat patch was
   1.25 hectare and harboured 7 female bees. Mark-release-recapture studies
   of female A. hattorfiana revealed a sedentary behaviour. Among
   pollen-foraging female bees the average registered distance moved was 46
   m. The patch emigration rate was about 2\%, with an observed maximum
   colonization distance of 900 m. Only 10\% of the individuals crossed
   areas without the pollen plant within grassland patches, such as unpaved
   roads, stone walls and small tree-stands, even if these areas were less
   than 10 m wide. This study shows that solitary bees can occur in local
   populations of extremely small size and they have a sedentary behaviour.
   These are features that usually increase the risk of local population
   extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Colletidae comprise approximately 2500 species of bees primarily
   distributed in the southern continents (only two colletid genera are
   widely distributed: Colletes and Hylaeus). Previously published studies
   have failed to resolve phylogenetic relationships on a worldwide basis
   and this has been a major barrier to the progress of research regarding
   systematics and evolution of colletid bees. For this study, data from
   four nuclear gene loci: elongation factor-1 alpha (F2 copy), opsin,
   wingless, and 28S rRNA were analyzed for 122 species of colletid bees,
   representing all subfamilies and tribes currently recognized; 22 species
   belonging to three other bee families were used as outgroups. Bayesian,
   maximum likelihood, and parsimony methods were employed to investigate
   the phylogenetic relationships within Colletidae and resulted in highly
   congruent and well-resolved trees. The phylogenetic results show that
   Colletidae are monophyletic and that all traditionally recognized
   subfamilies (except Paracolletinae) are also strongly supported as
   monophyletic. Our phylogenetic hypothesis provides a framework within
   which broad questions related to the taxonomy, biogeography, morphology,
   evolution, and ecology of colletid bees can be addressed. (C) 2008

Journal = {{NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{221-232}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The Canary Islands are home to a guild of endemic, threatened
   bird-pollinated plants. Previous work has suggested that these plants
   evolved floral traits as adaptations to pollination by flower specialist
   sunbirds, but subsequently, they appear to have co-opted generalist
   passerine birds as sub-optimal pollinators. To test this idea, we
   carried out a quantitative study of the pollination biology of three of
   the bird-pollinated plants, Canarina canariensis (Campanulaceae),
   Isoplexis canariensis (Veronicaceae) and Lotus berthelotii (Fabaceae),
   on the island of Tenerife. Using colour vision models, we predicted the
   detectability of flowers to bird and bee pollinators. We measured
   pollinator visitation rates, nectar standing crops as well as seed-set
   and pollen removal and deposition. These data showed that the plants are
   effectively pollinated by non-flower specialist passerine birds that
   only occasionally visit flowers. The large nectar standing crops and
   extended flower longevities (> 10 days) of Canarina and Isoplexis
   suggests that they have evolved a bird pollination system that
   effectively exploits these low frequency non-specialist pollen vectors
   and is in no way sub-optimal. Seed set in two of the three species was
   high and was significantly reduced or zero in flowers where pollinator
   access was restricted. In L. berthelotii, however, no fruit set was
   observed, probably because the plants were self-incompatible
   horticultural clones of a single genet. We also show that, while all
   three species are easily detectable for birds, the orange Canarina and
   the red Lotus (but less so the yellow-orange Isoplexis) should be
   difficult to detect for insect pollinators without specialised red
   receptors, such as bumblebees. Contrary to expectations if we accept
   that the flowers are primarily adapted to sunbird pollination, the
   chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis) was an effective pollinator of
   these species.}},

Abstract = {{Natural hybrids among the specialized terrestrial oil-secreting orchids
   of South Africa are extremely rare even where multiple closely related
   species co-occur. We found putative hybrids between Pterygodium
   catholicum Sw. and P. acutifolium Lindl., two closely related
   oil-secreting orchids that lack morphological barriers to
   inter-breeding. The purpose of this study was to confirm the parentage
   of the putative hybrids using molecular data from one nuclear (ITS) and
   two plastid (matK-trnK and trnL/F introns) DNA regions. Phylogenetic
   analyses of sequences as well as nucleotide substitution patterns of the
   putative hybrids, putative parents, and their closest relatives were
   consistent with a hypothesis of hybridization. We suggest that the
   hybrids were the result of visits to both orchids by a single species of
   oil-collecting bee during a brief period of flowering overlap. These
   results suggest that the rarity of hybrids between these orchids is due
   to factors other than genetic incompatibility.}},

Abstract = {{Biological diversity could enhance ecosystem service provision by
   increasing the mean level of services provided, and/or by providing more
   consistent (stable) services over space and time. Ecological theory
   predicts that when an ecosystem service is provided by many species, it
   will be stabilized against disturbance by a variety of `stabilizing
   mechanisms.' However, few studies have investigated whether stabilizing
   mechanisms occur in real landscapes affected by human disturbance. We
   used two datasets on crop pollination by wild native bees to screen for
   and differentiate along three stabilizing mechanisms: density
   compensation (negative co-variance among species' abundances); response
   diversity (differential response to environmental variables among
   species); and cross-scale resilience (response to the same environmental
   variable at different scales by different species). In both datasets, we
   found response diversity and cross-scale resilience, but not density
   compensation. We conclude that stabilizing mechanisms may contribute to
   the stability of pollination services in our study areas, emphasizing
   the insurance value of seemingly `redundant' species. Furthermore, the
   absence of density compensation that we found at the landscape scale
   contrasts with findings of previous small-scale experimental and
   modelling work, suggesting that we should not assume that density
   compensation will stabilize ecosystem services in real landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Insect mediated out-crossing poses a lot of problems in plant breeding
   and seed production by creating unwanted genotypes or off-types in the
   field including mixtures in seed lots. Removal of off-types in the field
   or seed lots increases costs of production. Information on level of
   out-crossing in cowpea and its insect pollinators as well as associated
   pollen movement would be useful in developing strategies to reduce
   outcrossing related problems. The objectives of this paper were to
   identify insect pollinators of cowpea, determine the level of
   outcrossing in the crop, and its implications in the deployment of
   genetically transformed cowpeas. Two experiments were conducted in
   Nigeria (IITA Ibadan and Mokwa) and Benin Republic (Cotonou) to assess
   geneflow frequency in cowpea under different planting arrangements. The
   first experiment was to quantify level of insect mediated out-crossing
   when three cowpea varieties (IT95K-1491, Sanzi, and IT86D-719) were
   respectively planted in alternate rows (one metre apart) with
   IT95K-1093-5. The second was to assess the level of insect mediated
   outcrossing when IT95K-1491, a breeding line with morphological marker
   (anthocyanin pigment), was planted in 3 4 concentric inner rows of 1 m
   apart while IT95K-1093-5 was planted in outer concentric rows up to 16 m
   from the epicenter. Incidence of insects visiting the plots was taken
   during the flowering stage of the crop. During harvesting, pods of
   IT95K-1093-5 were harvested from every plant within 3-4 m length along
   north, south, west and east axes of each concentric circle. In the case
   of alternate row planting, pods from single plants were harvested from
   rows of IT95K-1093-5 of each pair. Seeds derived from these plants
   (IT95K-1093-5) were planted in the field in order to assess the level of
   outcrossing that resulted from the movement of pollens from IT95K-1491,
   Sanzi, and IT86D-719 onto IT95K-1093-5 in the case of alternate row
   planting and IT95K-1491 onto IT95K-1093-5 for the concentric planting.
   Percentage of hybrids bearing the morphological trait of the marker
   parent was determined. Results obtained showed that level of out
   crossing was higher (0.5 to 0.85\%) when cowpea was planted in alternate
   rows than in concentric rows (0.01 to 0.13\%). Outcrossing was found to
   have occurred in a random fashion beyond 13 m. Among the insects
   observed, only honey and bumble bees were found with cowpea pollen dusts
   on their legs and abdomens, and were responsible for the observed level
   of outcrossing.}},

Title = {{Economic valuation of the vulnerability of world agriculture confronted
   with pollinator decline}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{810-821}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence of pollinator decline all over the world and
   consequences in many agricultural areas could be significant. We
   assessed these consequences by measuring 1) the contribution of insect
   pollination to the world agricultural output economic value, and 2) the
   vulnerability of world agriculture in the face of pollinator decline. We
   used a bioeconomic approach, which integrated the production dependence
   ratio on pollinators, for the 100 crops used directly for human food
   worldwide as listed by FAO. The total economic value of pollination
   worldwide amounted to (sic)153 billion, which represented 9.5\% of the
   value of the world agricultural production used for human food in 2005.
   In terms of welfare, the consumer surplus loss was estimated between
   (sic)190 and (sic)310 billion based upon average price elasticities of -
   1.5 to - 0.8, respectively. Vegetables and fruits were the leading crop
   categories in value of insect pollination with about (sic)50 billion
   each, followed by edible oil crops, stimulants, nuts and spices. The
   production value of a ton of the crop categories that do not depend on
   insect pollination averaged (sic)151 while that of those that are
   pollinator-dependent averaged (sic)761. The vulnerability ratio was
   calculated for each crop category at the regional and world scales as
   the ratio between the economic value of pollination and the current
   total crop value. This ratio varied considerably among crop categories
   and there was a positive correlation between the rate of vulnerability
   to pollinators decline of a crop category and its value per production
   unit. Looking at the capacity to nourish the world population after
   pollinator loss, the production of 3 crop categories - namely fruits,
   vegetables, and stimulants - will clearly be below the current
   consumption level at the world scale and even more so for certain
   regions like Europe. Yet, although our valuation clearly demonstrates
   the economic importance of insect pollinators, it cannot be considered
   as a scenario since it does not take into account the strategic
   responses of the markets. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Iridescence, the change in hue of a surface with varying observation
   angles, is used by insects, birds, fish, and reptiles for species
   recognition and mate selection. We identified iridescence in flowers of
   Hibiscus trionum and Tulipa species and demonstrated that iridescence is
   generated through diffraction gratings that might be widespread among
   flowering plants. Although iridescence might be expected to increase
   attractiveness, it might also compromise target identification because
   the object's appearance will vary depending on the viewer's perspective.
   We found that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) learn to disentangle flower
   iridescence from color and correctly identify iridescent flowers despite
   their continuously changing appearance. This ability is retained in the
   absence of cues from polarized light or ultraviolet reflectance
   associated with diffraction gratings.}},

Abstract = {{This Study was aimed at identifying the potential different insect
   visitors of Origanum syriacum flowers and at evaluating their role in
   seed set in Syrian Oregano grown under its native semiarid Mediterranean
   conditions. Three treatments were imposed on O. syriacum plants before
   flowering: 1) Plants were left uncovered to permit insect visiting, 2)
   plants were covered and hand pollinated with pollen from flowers of
   other plants, and 3) plants were covered (control). The results showed
   that 21 bee species were identified visiting O. syriacum flowers, of
   which 8 species were recorded for the first time in Jordan.
   Supplementary pollination produced a higher significant number of seeds
   and seed set than other pollination treatments that led us to conclude
   that O. syriacum flowers are affected by pollen shortage under natural
   conditions. Wind plays little or no role in its pollination process.
   There is low seed yield production and seed set by O. syriacum under
   natural conditions in Jordan. The number of bee colonies as well as the
   wild bees must be enhanced in the area to improve their value in O.

Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecological process that provides important services to
   humans. Pollination service in agroecosystems depends on several
   factors, including the land management systems used by farmers. Here we
   focused on the effects of insect pollinator diversity on coffee fruit
   production along a gradient of management systems in central Veracruz,
   Mexico. The gradient ranged from low environmental impact management
   systems (the native forest is not completely removed) to high
   environmental impact management systems (the native forest is completely
   removed). We hypothesized that pollinator diversity should be higher in
   low-impact systems. Then, if fruit production is positively related to
   pollinator diversity, plantations with low-impact management systems
   should display higher fruit production than plantations with high-impact
   management systems. We used observational and experimental data to test
   this hypothesis. Our results indicated that low-impact management
   systems have higher species richness and relative diversity (measured
   with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index) of pollinators than high-impact
   management systems. In all cases, fruit production was positively
   related with species richness and diversity of pollinators. Moreover,
   fruit production was higher in low-impact than in high-impact management
   systems. These results suggest that the diversity of insect pollinators
   can be influenced by the management system applied by farmers, and that
   such effects may have strong consequences on coffee fruit production.

Abstract = {{Nyssa yunnanensis W. Q. Yin ex H. N. Qin \& Phengklai (Nyssaceae) is a
   critically endangered range-restricted tree species known from only
   three small populations in a tropical forest area of southern Yunnan
   Province, southwestern China. Two types, of individuals occur, one
   bearing staminate flowers and the other with morphologically perfect
   flowers that produce both pollen and fruit suggesting an androdioecious
   breeding system. Field an(] laboratory studies conducted between 2004
   and 2007 indicate, however, that N yunnanensis is functionally
   dioecious: pollen front the morphologically perfect flowers is
   inaperturate and inviable, rendering the trees that bear these flowers
   functionally female. Field observations showed that the staminate
   flowers opened 10 to 15 (lays earlier than the protogynous female
   flowers hot that flowering ceased ill nearly the same time in both
   sexes. Thirty-six species of insects were observed and collected visting
   the flowers of N. yunnanensis, four of which served as effective
   pollinators. Breeding system experiments demonstrated that the
   predominantly entomophilous pollination system is supplemented by
   anemophily and further indicated that X yunnanensis is xenogamous and
   does not appear to exhibit parthenogenesis. The average sex ratio of
   individuals within the three populations was female-biased (0.5-1:1),
   but the ratio among flowers was male-biased (2.56:1) because flower
   production was higher in males. The 37 known trees of N. yunnanensis are
   likely the remnants of a once more widespread, abundant species that has
   been heavily impacted by human disturbance, it fine shared with many
   other threatened Southeast Asian taxa whose continued survival will
   require dedicated conservation efforts informed by it detailed
   understanding of population structure an(] reproductive biology.}},

Pages = {{18-25}},
Abstract = {{Insect visitors to the flowers of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. in a
   remnant natural stand were classified into 33 functional pollinator
   groups according to taxonomic affinity and body size. In total, 92\% of
   insects caught were dipterans; however, most of these were small and did
   not contribute significantly to pollination. For the majority of taxa,
   which have short mouthparts and therefore need to intrude themselves
   into the flower while feeding on nectar, there was a highly significant
   relationship between body length and the number of E. regnans pollen
   grains carried on the body. Mean pollen loads ranged from 20 grains per
   insect for sepsid flies to 84 000 for large tachinid flies. An index of
   pollen-deposition potential, which is based on population size and
   pollen load, suggested that the larger tachinid, calliphorid and syrphid
   flies were the most important pollen vectors and that larger sphecid
   wasps also played a significant role. Many taxa appeared to contribute
   little to pollination because they were uncommon and/or did not carry
   large quantities of pollen. A convention is proposed whereby groups are
   weighted according to their contribution to total pollen-deposition
   potential. For E. regnans, a ratio of 5 Diptera/1 Hymenoptera +
   (Coleoptera/Lepidoptera) is described, with the taxa in parentheses
   contributing less than 10\% of the total.}},

Abstract = {{Caladenia is very unusual in that it contains species that attract
   pollinators by two different strategies, food and sexual deception.
   Among the sexually deceptive species, baiting for pollinators has shown
   that within populations orchid species are typically pollinated by a
   single species of thynnine wasp. However, some wasp species can be
   pollinators of more than one species of orchid usually when their ranges
   do not overlap. There is a trend for closely related orchids to exploit
   wasps from the same genus, with different lineages of orchids often
   pollinated by different genera. Very little is known about pollination
   of food-deceptive Caladenia species, although it is evident they attract
   a suite of generalist food-seeking insects. Food-deceptive species have
   a higher pollination rate than do sexually deceptive species. Studies of
   population genetics and pollen movements are few, although they suggest
   a pattern of fine-scale genetic structuring within populations, owing to
   predominantly restricted seed dispersal and low genetic differentiation
   among populations as a consequence of rare long-distance seed-dispersal
   events. Both evolutionary and ecological research of Caladenia will
   greatly benefit from a better understanding of the insect species
   involved in pollination, their ecological requirements and the
   ecological and genetic consequences of food and sexual deception.}},

Abstract = {{Orchids of the genus Caladenia have been shown to utilise two quite
   different pollination strategies, namely species-specific sexual
   deception of thynnine wasps and a more generalist strategy attracting a
   larger spectrum of foraging insects. While baiting techniques have
   enabled the identification of numerous pollinators of sexually deceptive
   Caladenia, insects that pollinate food-advertising species have received
   little attention. The present study employed a multidisciplinary
   approach to better evaluate the pollination syndrome of the white spider
   orchid, Caladenia rigida R. S. Rogers, a species previously reported to
   utilise both food and sexual deception. This included the observation
   and capture of potential pollinators of C. rigida through direct
   observation, pantraps, Malaise traps and pollinator-baiting experiments,
   and the use of molecular techniques to identify orchid pollinia isolated
   from carrier insects. We describe a suite of generalist insects visiting
   and bearing pollinia from C. rigida. In addition, samples collected from
   the labellum and column of C. rigida contained sugars at levels
   comparable to those of a known nectar-producing orchid, Microtis
   parviflora R.Br. Potential osmophores in the clubs and calli stained
   positively with neutral red and although this character is often
   associated with sexual deception, we found no evidence for this
   secondary pollination syndrome in C. rigida. The present study is the
   first one to provide a detailed description of the pollinators and
   pollination syndrome of a non-sexually deceptive species within the
   genus Caladenia and the first report to provide evidence of nectar
   production by a species within this genus.}},

Volume = {{142}},

Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Declines in many bumble bee species have been documented in Europe
   raising several ecological and economic concerns. The nature and extent
   of bumblebee decline in North America is poorly understood due mainly to
   a lack of baseline and long-term data. Museum collections provide
   excellent sources of information on past and current species
   distributions, which can be used to infer changes in the composition of
   insect communities. Using the Illinois Natural History Survey's
   electronic database of Hymenoptera and a recent biodiversity survey of
   historically sampled localities, we were able to examine changes in the
   richness and distribution of the bumble bee fauna of Illinois over the
   last century. We found that bumble bee species richness declined
   substantially during the middle of the century (1940-1960). Four species
   were locally extirpated: Bombus borealis, Bombus temarius, Bombus
   terricola and Bombus variabilis. The ranges of Bombus affinis, Bombus
   fraternus, Bombus pensylvanicus and Bombus vagans have also decreased in
   Illinois. Our analyses also indicated that current bumble bee diversity
   is highest in northern Illinois, where conservation efforts would be
   most productive. Our study demonstrates that half of the bumble bee
   species found historically in Illinois have been locally extirpated or
   have suffered declines, supporting observations of broader declines in
   North America. Major declines in the bumble bee fauna coincided with
   large-scale agricultural intensification in Illinois between 1940 and
   1960. Attempts to conserve bumble bees in Illinois should involve
   wildlife-friendly approaches to agriculture, such as increasing
   agricultural land set-asides and hedgerows, and employing integrated
   pest management. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   nesting in trap-nests. These ones are important pollinators of wild and
   cultivated plants. Studies about the nesting biology of these
   pollinators are essential in order to trace management alternatives of
   these bees. The present work aimed to verify the percentage of
   occupation and structure of the trap-nests used by Centris (Hemisiella)
   tarsata and Centris ( Hemisiella) vittata. The study was carried out in
   two areas of the Triangulo Mineiro, where bamboo canes had been used as
   trap-nests. They were inspected monthly, from January to October 2006.
   It was verified 35 nests of C. tarsata and 12 of C. vittata. The length
   and diameter measurements of trap-nest occupied by C. tarsata varied
   from 1.5 to 11.4 cm and 0.54 to 1.69 cm, respectively and the number of
   cells constructed ranged from one to ten. For C. vittata, the length and
   diameter measurements ranged from 4.7 to 20.5 cm and 1.06 to 1.87 cm,
   respectively, and the number of cells ranged from two to nine. These
   species construct their cells linearly with a mixture of sand and oil.
   Therefore, C. tarsata can also constructed their nests with two parallel
   rows of cells. Since these two species are the West Indian Cherry's
   pollinators, the introduction of trap-nests near to the culture areas,
   could increase these pollinators populations and the natural pollination
   rates.}},

Abstract = {{Way of pollination in sunflower is allogamy and therefore the presence
   of insects is essential for successful production. Trial material was
   consisting of six sunflower hybrids that were grown on majority of
   sunflower's fields in Croatia. Trial was conducted on trial-field
   situated in Knezevi Vinogradi (Baranja region). Honey bees were
   transported in Langstroth-Rooth (LR) beehives to the trial-field; three
   days before sunflower's blooming. Impact of honey bee on selection and
   production traits of sunflower was expressed as a difference between
   results gained by free pollination and results under the condition of
   isolation. The most important pollinator of sunflower is a honey bee.
   Weather conditions (air temperature, relative air humidity and
   rainfalls) considerably influenced activities of honey bees during
   sunflower blooming. Honey bees were mostly active during the days
   without rain, at air temperature from 23 to 26 degrees C and relative
   air humidity from 65 to 75 \%. The most attractive hybrid for honey bee
   was hybrid H4. Presence of pollinators resulted in improvement of
   selection and production traits of sunflower: number of flowers per
   head, number of full up field grains per head, percentage of
   pollination, 1000 kernel weight, hectolitre mass, oil content and oil
   yield. Considerable economic rationale was determined for the
   introduction of pollination with honey bee in agriculture practice.}},

Abstract = {{The variation of floral morphology and its effect on the flower visitors
   of Polygala vayredae Costa (Polygalaceae), a narrow endemic species from
   the Oriental pre-Pyrenees, were examined. First, to account for the main
   floral reward (i.e., nectar), the relationship between the dimensions of
   the nectar gland and nectar production was investigated. Second, floral
   traits variation was assessed within and between the three most
   representative populations of the species. Finally, the role of several
   floral traits in the female fitness was evaluated. Furthermore, as
   nectar robbing was highly frequent, preferences of robbers for specific
   floral traits and their impact on legitimate pollinations were also
   evaluated. The flowers of this species are characterized by significant
   variations in floral characteristics and nectar rewards. A significant
   and positive correlation between the nectar gland dimensions and nectar
   production per flower was observed, with the gland dimensions being a
   good measure to infer the rewards offered by the flowers of P. vayredae.
   In general, corolla traits were significant and positively correlated
   with each other. Nectar was revealed to be an important trait in
   flower-visitor interactions, with legitimate pollinations being
   primarily influenced by this floral reward. Negative correlations
   between robbing frequency and legitimate pollinations were observed in
   two of the studied populations, and positive correlations between flower
   size and robbing frequency were observed in one population. An indirect
   negative selection over phenotypic floral traits mediated by nectar
   robbers is proposed.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{215-223}},

Abstract = {{Pollination success of plants is highly susceptible to the frequency of
   visits and foraging behavior of pollinators. Pollination of the
   nectarless flowers of Pedicularis species depends on bumblebee workers
   collecting pollen by vibrating the anthers (buzz pollination). However,
   little is known about the efficiency of the pollination system. Foraging
   behavior, pollen removal from anthers and pollen deposition on stigmas
   of P. chamissonis were studied to assess the effectiveness of buzz
   pollination in an alpine snowbed population of northern Japan. Although
   bumblebees tended to visit most of the flowers open at a given time
   within inflorescences during a single visit, pollen removal rate at the
   first visit was about 20\%, and buzzing period decreased with increasing
   number of previous visits, resulting in a decreasing proportion of
   pollen removed per visit as the number of visits increased. These trends
   enable plants to provide pollen for more pollinators. The number of
   pollen grains deposited on stigmas was not saturated during the first
   visit and increased with additional visits. Irrespective of weak
   self-compatibility, evidence of interference between self and outcross
   pollen was lacking for seed production. Therefore, buzz pollination in
   P. chamissonis acts as a mechanism that improves the chance of
   cross-pollination upon multiple visits if pollinator visitation is
   frequent.}},

Title = {{Resource-tracking by bumble bees: What explains local responses to
   density of bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) flowers?}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{470-475}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection theory predicts that consumers should distribute
   themselves across alternative resources in a fitness-maximizing manner.
   One such distribution is the ideal free distribution, where consumer
   density matches local resource density. Alternatively, if wing wear is
   an important cost of wing use for bees, there should be relatively more
   bee consumers in high density patches, resulting in ``overmatching{''}.
   If the energetic costs of flight influence patch choice, there also
   should be relatively more consumers in high density patches (where
   flight costs are lower), resulting in ``overmatching{''}. To examine
   these hypotheses, I observed the visitation of bumble bees (genus
   Bombus) across experimental manipulations of plant density in patches of
   bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) in southwest Alberta, Canada over 2
   summers. Bees flew more often and for a greater proportion of time, and
   hit their wings more frequently, in low-density patches. In 2004., bees
   ``undermatched{''} resources (relatively few bees in high density
   patches). In 2005, bees achieved an ideal free distribution. Overall,
   wing wear and energy costs alone cannot explain bumble bee use of their
   floral resources (in either year), while the ideal free distribution
   sometimes can (i.e., in 2005), This study therefore complements the
   findings of ideal free distribution in other aspects of the foraging
   ecology of pollinators.}},

   nests made of quartz grains embedded in a resinous matrix on the surface
   of sandstone rocks. Brood cells are exclusively provisioned with pollen
   of Asteraceae. The meloid beetle Stenoria hessei and the chrysidid wasp
   Chrysura schultzei are here recorded for the first time as parasitoids
   of O (M) schultzei. The nesting biology of the species is discussed and

Abstract = {{Reproductive biology and pollination of Stanhopea lietzei and Stanhopea
   insignis were studied ill a semi-deciduous mesophytic forest in the
   Serra do Japi (SJ), and in the coastal plain of Picinguaba. both in the
   State of Sao Paulo. Brazil. Floral morphology, pollination, breeding
   system and fruit set of both species were investigated. S. lietzei and
   S. insignis are pollinator-specific, being pollinated by male bees of
   Eufriesea (Apidae, Euglossini), which collect the fragrance produced by
   pluricellular osmophores at the base of the saccate hypochile. S.
   lietzei and S. insignis were pollinated by Eufriesea pulchra and
   Eufriesea purpurata, respectively. Observations using substances present
   in the floral fragrance of both studied species as chemical baits were
   also performed. E purpurata was attracted by benzyl alcohol, the major
   compound of the perfume of S. insignis, while E pulchra was attracted by
   none of the compounds used. Both Studied Stanhopea are self-compatible
   but pollinator dependent. Self-pollination, however, tends to be avoided
   by floral mechanisms. In experimental self- and cross-pollinations the
   proportion of fruit abortion was high and related to resource
   limitation. The reproductive success of S. lietzei and S. insignis was
   low as a consequence of deficient pollen transference while pollinator
   scarcity was the main factor. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Currently, the identification of pollinators is a critical necessity of
   conservation programs. After it was found that features extracted from
   patterns of wing venation are sufficient to discriminate among insect
   species, various studies have focused on this structure. We examined
   wing venation patterns of males and workers of five stingless bee
   species in order to determine if there are differences between sexes and
   if these differences are greater within than between species. Geometric
   morphometric analyses were made of the forewings of males and workers of
   Nannotrigona testaceicornis, Melipona quadrifasciata, Frieseomelitta
   varia, and Scaptotrigona aff. depilis and Plebeia remota. The patterns
   of males and workers from the same species were more similar than the
   patterns of individuals of the same sex from different species, and the
   patterns of both males and workers, when analyzed alone, were
   sufficiently different to distinguish among these five species. This
   demonstrates that we can use this kind of analysis for the
   identification of stingless bee species and that the sex of the
   individual does not impede identification. Computer-assisted
   morphometric analysis of bee wing images can be a useful tool for
   biodiversity studies and conservation programs.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the success of two stingless bee species in pollinating
   strawberries in greenhouses. Three greenhouses and one open field area
   were used; one greenhouse had only strawberry plants (control), another
   (G1) had three colonies of Scaptotrigona aff. depilis and another (G2)
   had three colonies of Nannotrigona testaceicornis. In the open field
   area, the flowers could be visited by any bee. The total production of
   fruits was counted and a random sample (N = 100) from each area was used
   to measure weight, length, circumference, and achenes number (N = 5).
   The percentages of deformed strawberries were: 23\% (no bees); 2\%
   (greenhouses with bees) and 13\% (open field). The strawberries from the
   greenhouse with N. testaceicornis and the open field were heavier than
   those from the greenhouses with no bees and with S. depilis. The fruit
   circumference was largest in the greenhouses with bees. The achenes
   number did not differ among the experimental areas. The strawberries
   produced in the greenhouses with stingless bees had more quality and
   greater commercial value than the fruits produced in the open field area
   and the greenhouse without bees. We conclude that stingless bees are
   efficient pollinators of strawberry flowers cultivated in greenhouses.}},

Abstract = {{In order to analyze the pollen resources used by the orchid bee Euglossa

   were taken from 12 different trap nests (wooden boxes) on Santa Catarina
   Island, southern Brazil. The 43 samples collected between 2002 and 2005
   represented all months except December. Overall, 74 pollen types from 24
   families were distinguished. Among the 26 pollen types that reached more
   than 10\% in monthly means, the families Melastomataceae, Bromeliaceae,
   Ochnaceae, Fabaceae, and Myrtaceae were most frequently represented. The
   Shannon-Weaver diversity index H' for the 43 brood cells varied from
   0.10-1.65 and the annual diversity was 0.98. Similarity indices ranged
   from 0 to 0.87 and were highest during spring and summer. The results

Abstract = {{We studied the community ecology of trap-nesting bees in two forest
   fragments of the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, during two years, utilizing
   bamboo canes and tubes made of black cardboard as trap nests. The traps
   were inspected once a month with an otoscope. One hundred and fifteen
   nests were obtained at Estacao Ecologica de Paulo de Faria, Paulo de
   Faria (EEPF). These included nine species belonging to five genera and
   two families. At Santa Cecilia Farm (SCF), 12 species belonging to seven
   genera and three families built 392 nests. Natural enemies reared from
   nests of both areas included Hymenoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera.
   Species richness was similar between the areas but the communities
   differed considerably in species composition. The higher diversity found
   at EEPF was due to more even distribution of the species. No difference
   was observed between the numbers of nests built in each year in each
   area. Although the species richness was lower in the cool/dry season of
   both years at SCF, and in the first year at EEPF, the nesting
   frequencies did not differ between seasons for both the overall
   community but for each of the most abundant species. No annual
   fluctuation in the frequencies of nesting was observed. As temperature
   and precipitation were not found to be significantly different between
   the two years of study in each area, we concluded that climatic
   stability resulted in population stability.}},

Abstract = {{Five surveys of the bee communities in four ``Cerrado{''} ecosystem
   reserves in Sao Paulo State were compared for species richness and
   similarity. These areas are fragment vegetation reser-reserves located
   in the Cerrado Corumbata Reserve (Corumbata), Jata Ecological Park (Luiz
   Antonio), Cajuru (Cajuru), and Vassununga State Park - ``Gleba de
   Cerrado de Pe-de-Gigante{''} (Santa Rita do Passa Quatro). The
   methodology consisted of capturing bees foraging on flowers along
   transects, though with small differences between surveys. These
   ``cerrado{''} areas have a large number of species of native bees, which
   are important pollinators in several Brazilian ecosystems. The community
   of bees varied among these different fragments. Based on 500 individuals
   (standardized by rarefaction), Cajuru, Corumbata 1 and Corumbata 2 were
   the areas with highest species richness, and Jata and Pe-de-Gigante had
   the lowest species richness in the bee communities. The bee faunas of
   Corumbata 2 and Pe-de-Gigante had the highest similarity, forming a
   group with the bee fauna of Cajuru. The bee faunas of Corumbata 1 and
   Jata were isolated from this group. We found that the bee species
   richness and similarity found in these ``cerrado{''} areas cannot be
   explained by general factors such as the size of the fragment, the
   species richness of plants and the distance between the areas.
   Therefore, we suppose that local factors that differ among areas, such
   as interactions between populations, and competition and interference
   from surrounding areas influence and determine bee species richness and
   similarity in these reserves.}},

Abstract = {{Loss and fragmentation of foraging habitats, and extreme seasonality in
   the flowering phenology of wild plants, limit honeybee populations in
   Israel. This problem can be alleviated by the planting of bee forage
   plants in forests, parks, and along roadsides. To provide
   recommendations for such planting, we combined a literature survey and
   qualitative evaluations of experts to compile a list of 266 local wild
   plant species that have high food potential for bees. We also
   quantitatively evaluated the food potential of 32 species of trees and
   shrubs planted by Keren Kayemeth Lelsrael-Jewish National Fund
   (KKL-JNF). We recorded the following parameters of each species: main
   flowering season; flower morphology; type of food reward; number of
   flowers per plant; nectar standing crop; hourly nectar production rate;
   type of insect visitors; and frequency of insect visits. We ranked the
   surveyed species according to their potential importance as food plants,
   assigning high ranks to species that (a) bloom between July and February
   (the period of dearth in flowering natural vegetation), (b) produce
   large amounts of nectar, and (c) are highly attractive to honeybees. Of
   the species surveyed, Amygdalus communis, Eucalyptus camaldulensis,
   Ceratonia siliqua, and Ziziphus spina-christi best combined these
   benefits. A regression model indicated that high nectar production rates
   increased insect visitation rates, while long flowers reduced them, in
   an inter-specific analysis. Our study highlights the importance of
   diversified forestry planting to address agricultural, conservation, and
   recreational needs.}},

Pages = {{185-191}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollination is essential for almond production, and most growers
   rely exclusively on honeybees for pollination, However, the number of
   honeybee hives has declined drastically over the last few decades and
   their efficiency in pollinating almond might be limited. Wild bee
   communities inhabiting the habitats surrounding almond orchards may
   provide significant pollination services to almond, but this has yet to
   be studied. In this preliminary investigation, we looked at spatial
   diversity patterns of wild bees in almond orchards and their surrounding
   landscape. The study was conducted in the Judean Foothills, a region
   with a Mediterranean ecosystem in central Israel, during almond bloom in
   2008. We sampled bees and blooming plants in natural habitats, almond
   orchards, a weedy orchard (where wild flowers had been allowed to grow),
   and the margin between orchard and natural habitat. The margin and
   natural habitats had a significantly higher abundance of wild bees
   compared to the orchard, while the weedy orchard showed intermediate
   abundances. No significant differences were found among habitats in the
   number of wild bee genera, but there were significant differences in
   genera composition between the natural and orchard habitats. Honeybees
   were the main bee visitor to almond flowers. Nevertheless, the diverse
   and abundant wild bee community surrounding the orchards warrants
   further investigation of their role as almond pollinators.}},

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{How non-rewarding flowers are able to receive sufficient pollinator
   visits to enable successful reproduction is an intriguing question. This
   study investigates the psychophysics of honeybee perception when
   individual honeybees are presented with a choice of a known
   non-rewarding color that is perceptually similar to a previously
   rewarding (but not present) target color, or a novel color. In
   experiment one, bees were tested for color preferences to three
   different artificial ``blue{''} flowers, two of which were very similar
   in color; there was no color preference for any of the stimuli. In a
   second experiment, bees were provided with absolute conditioning to one
   of the perceptually similar stimuli. In subsequent non-rewarded tests
   these bees could not discriminate between the similar colors but could
   discriminate the non-similar color. In a third experiment, bees provided
   with differential conditioning (target rewarded and distractor
   unrewarded) learned to reliably discriminate between the perceptually
   similar stimuli. Surprisingly, when these bees were presented with a
   task of choosing between the known non-rewarding flower and a novel
   flower, bees chose the non-rewarding flower. The finding reveals that
   there is a strong perceptual effect on bees to choose stimuli that are
   perceptually similar to known rewarding flowers. The results explain how
   non-rewarding floral mimics may gain sufficient pollinator visits to
   enable pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Some studies have claimed that flowers in bloom at particular times of
   year are more likely to be of particular colors to better attract
   pollinating insects. To test this, we analyzed a data set collected from
   five field sites near Strausberg, Germany, which included information on
   flower color and months of blooming. However, we chose to consider
   flower color as perceived by bee as well as human visual systems, as
   well as independent of any color vision system, to reveal whether
   trends, if present, have any ecological relevance. Using randomization
   analyses, we were able to consider whether blooming time interacts with
   flower color, and how this interaction depends upon other factors. Our
   results show that there is an association between the months of
   flowering and the colors of flowers-but only when flowers are considered
   according to human color categories. Further analysis showed that this
   is merely a consequence of flowers from the same family being more
   likely to flower at the same time and have similar colors. All these
   effects disappeared when flowers were considered using bee color
   categories, and in the analyses of physical spectral reflectances.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted during 2005/2006 at Jordan University
   of Science and Technology campus (32 degrees 30 `' N, 35 degrees 59 `'
   E), Irbid, Jordan, to study the role of bee visitors on seed set and
   production of Vicia villosa spp. dasycarpa grown under semiarid
   conditions. Two treatments were imposed on Vicia villosa plants before
   flowering: 1) Plants were covered in cages (control) or 2) Plants were
   left uncovered to permit bee visiting. The results of this experiment
   showed that V. villosa flowers were very attractive to worker honeybees
   as well as to few numbers of wild bees. The most frequent visitor
   species were A. mellifera and Anthophora albigena of family Apidae. V.
   villosa flowers attracted most of the bee visitors in the early hours of
   the day. The duration of their visit on the flowers also peaked early in
   the day and decreased toward the end of the day. The percentage of pod
   set of the un-covered plants averaged 14\% out of the total florets on
   the plants, which was significantly higher than the covered plants
   (2\%). These results indicated that the percentage of flower abscission
   was high and averaged more than 86\%. Plant covering significantly
   reduced seed yield by reducing seed and pod number per plant and seed
   number per pod, but had no effect on individual seed weight. In
   conclusion, preventing bees from visiting during flowering of V. villosa
   spp. dasycarpa decreased seed set, seed yield and yield components.
   Further studies are needed to understand the high flower abscission and
   failure of seed set in this species.}},

Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{98-108}},

Abstract = {{Valuable insights into mechanisms of community responses to
   environmental change can be gained by analysing in tandem the variation
   in functional and taxonomic composition along environmental gradients.
   We assess the changes in species and functional trait composition (i.e.
   dominant traits and functional diversity) of diverse bee communities in
   contrasting fire-driven systems in two climatic regions: Mediterranean
   (scrub habitats in Israel) and temperate (chestnut forests in southern
   Switzerland).
   In both climatic regions, there were shifts in species diversity and
   composition related to post-fire age. In the temperate region,
   functional composition responded markedly to fire; however, in the
   Mediterranean, the taxonomic response to fire was not matched by
   functional replacement.
   These results suggest that greater functional stability to fire in the
   Mediterranean is achieved by replacement of functionally similar species
   (i.e. functional redundancy) which dominate under different
   environmental conditions in the heterogeneous landscapes of the region.
   In contrast, the greater functional response in the temperate region was
   attributed to a more rapid post-fire vegetation recovery and shorter
   time-window when favourable habitat was available relative to the
   Mediterranean.
   Bee traits can be used to predict the functional responses of bee
   communities to environmental changes in habitats of conservation
   importance in different regions with distinct disturbance regimes.
   However, predictions cannot be generalized from one climatic region to
   another where distinct habitat configurations occur.}},

Pages = {{126-133}},
Abstract = {{The Kakamega district is endowed with good climatic and soil conditions
   that have favoured agricultural production, and houses the Kakamega
   Tropical Rain Forest, the only remaining patch of the easternmost end of
   the Congo Forest. In efforts to halt its fragmentation and to salvage
   the remaining fragments, studies are being undertaken to convince
   farmers of the importance of conservation. This study considers bees and
   their pollinating importance in the livelihood of farmers, in order to
   understand the level of knowledge local farmers have about bees, and
   their role in crop production. A questionnaire was sent in January and
   February 2006 to representatives of 352 households randomly selected
   from 19,972 households living around the forest. Respondents were shown
   pictures and specimens of different insects, and after correct
   identification, were asked to state the food sources and nesting sites
   of these bees. They were asked to state how they utilize these bees and
   about their willingness to conserve them as pollinators. We found that
   Kakamega farmers could identify bees of different species, and had some
   knowledge of bee floral and nesting needs. Only about 50\% were,
   however, aware of pollination and could relate it to crop productivity,
   but after having been introduced to the importance of bee pollination in
   crop production, they showed willingness to conserve bees for such
   purposes.}},

Title = {{Decline in Bee Diversity and Abundance from 1972-2004 on a Flowering
   Leguminous Tree, Andira inermis in Costa Rica at the Interface of

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of bees in specific sites provides information on
   changes in species diversity and abundance, especially in areas close to
   human habitation. Evaluations of this monitoring data combined with
   relevant measures of anthropogenic activity can aide in interpreting
   emerging patterns of bee pollinators. In 1972, we sampled bees visiting
   flowers of a population of the leguminous tree, Andira inermis (W.
   Wright) DC in a dry forest site adjacent to the town of Liberia,
   Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. Slightly more than 800 bees were
   recorded on the average per tree site, with an overall bee diversity
   among the trees of approximately 70 species. Standardized bee samples
   were taken again from the same population of A. inermis in 1996, 1999,
   and 2004. In each of these years average abundance level per tree was
   greatly reduced, as was overall species diversity. Andira inermis trees
   were also observed to have variable attraction for large anthophorid
   bees versus honey bees. Some trees attracted significantly more
   anthophorids than honey bees, whereas other trees attracted the
   opposite.
   Since 1972 there were many changes in land use that were directly
   related to a rapidly growing human population in Liberia. These changes,
   which greatly modified the natural landscape and vegetation, are
   believed to have caused a major decline in species diversity and
   abundance of bees to a low but consistent level. Concurrently, increased
   urban growth has resulted in many more residential neighborhoods that
   have a wide variety of ornamental flowering plant species, many of which
   are native to Costa Rica, that attract a wide variety of native bee
   species. Evidence is offered to suggest that urban residential areas
   represent a source of bees that continue to visit A. inermis at low
   levels in and immediately around Liberia.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and temporal factors can influence animal foraging patterns
   and may obscure our understanding of how native and exotic species
   interact. To understand how such factors affect foraging, the visitation
   of native and exotic bees and wasps was observed at nectar feeders
   within Mexican agroforestry systems, while documenting (1) vegetation
   management (low-shade vs. high-shade coffee), (2) light and floral
   resource levels and (3) recruiting ability, as measured by the change in
   visitation between two consecutive experimental days. On day one,
   Africanized honeybee visitation was significantly greater in low-shade
   habitats, and native solitary bee abundance was significantly greater in
   high-shade habitats, while native social bee and solitary wasp
   visitation were not significantly different between habitat types. After
   24 h, Africanized honeybee visitation increased significantly in both
   habitat types, while native social bee visitation increased
   significantly only in high-shade coffee. In contrast, native solitary
   bee and native solitary wasp visitation decreased in both habitat types.

Abstract = {{Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Ait.) Hassk. is widely distributed in tropical
   Asia and is an invasive species in Florida, USA. The purpose of the
   present study was to investigate the reproductive ecology of the species
   in order to provide information that may be useful in elucidating
   factors contributing to its invasiveness. The research was carried out
   at Heshan Hilly Land Integrated Experimental Station, the Chinese
   Academy of Sciences, Guangdong Province, China in 2003 and 2004.
   Rhodomyrtus tomentosa flowers in March or April and the flowering period
   lasts for about 3 months. Flowers open early in the morning and last 2-3
   days. The pollen remain viable for about 12 h and the stigma is only
   receptive on the blooming day. The breeding system is a mixed mating
   system (outcrossing and geitonogamy). The species is bee-pollinated with
   pollen as the floral reward. Almost all pollinators appeared before 12
   am. Amegilla florea (Smith) Brooks and Xylocopa nasalis Westwood are the
   primary pollinators for the species. The results indicate that the
   reproductive features of R. tomentosa - with the mixed mating system and
   common generalist pollinators - are not limiting factors when
   colonization occurs in a new environment.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the relative contributions to seed sets of each of a plant

   study we compared the seed set of the gynodioecious Knautia arvensis
   (Dipsacaceae) in 49 local plant populations in two regions of southern
   Sweden. We measured the seed set for hermaphroditic and female plant
   individuals. In both plant sexes and both regions, the seed set was
   positively related to the abundance of Apidae. The seed set was
   negatively related to the abundance of pollen-foraging solitary bees

   seed set was not related to plant population size, plant density or
   female frequency. Our results confirm that pollination success in
   generalised plant-pollinator systems varies between pollinator groups.
   Flower-visitors foraging for pollen might not contribute to increased
   pollination success in generalised pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{Five mycoheterotrophic species of Cephalanthera have been proposed from
   tropical Asia. Until recently, all of them were only known from the type
   specimens, for which reason it has been difficult to judge if some of
   them were actually conspecific. The recent discovery of two large
   populations of C. exigua in Thailand made it possible to describe the
   range of variation of this species in much more detail, and we then
   found it to be well distinguished from the others. A phylogenetic
   analysis based on nuclear rDNA ITS sequences corroborated the systematic
   position of C. exigua at the generic level. Examination of the
   previously neglected type of C. pusilla from Myanmar lead to the
   conclusion that this taxon of disputed generic affinity likewise belongs
   to Cephalanthera, and that it is a clearly distinct species. Finally, we
   accept that also C. ericiflora from Laos as well as C. gracilis and C.
   calcarata from Yunnan are probably distinct species. Cephalanthera
   exigua grows in hill evergreen forest, but we found little floristic
   similarity between its two localities in Thailand (ISS=22.5\%).
   Ectomycorrhizal trees of the families Fagaceae and Ulmaceae are probably
   the ultimate carbon source for C. exigua at both sites, as the
   mycorrhizal partners of this orchid (basidiomycetes of the family
   Thelephoraceae) obtain their carbon nutrition through ectomycorrhizal
   association with forest trees. Pollination experiments demonstrated that
   the nectarless flowers of C. exigua are not spontaneously autogamous.
   Based on the pollination syndrome and previously published observations
   on other species of the genus, we suggest that C. exigua has an
   insect-operated breeding system acting by deceit, and that the
   pollinators are probably solitary bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination webs have recently deepened our understanding of complex
   ecosystem functions and the susceptibility of biotic networks to
   anthropogenic disturbances. Extensive mutualistic networks from tropical
   species-rich communities, however, are extremely scarce. We present
   fully quantitative pollination webs of two plant-pollinator communities
   of natural heathland sites, one of which was in the process of being
   restored, on the oceanic island of Mauritius. The web interaction data
   cover a full flowering season from September 2003 to March 2004 and
   include all flowering plant and their pollinator species. Pollination
   webs at both sites were dominated by a few super-abundant,
   disproportionately well-connected species, and many rare and specialised
   species. The webs differed greatly in size, reflecting higher plant and
   pollinator species richness and abundance at the restored site. About
   one fifth of plant species at the smaller community received < 3 visits.
   The main pollinators were insects from diverse taxonomic groups, while
   the few vertebrate pollinator species were abundant and highly linked.
   The difference in plant community composition between sites appeared to
   strongly affect the associated pollinator community and interactions
   with native plant species. Low visitation rate to introduced plant
   species suggested little indirect competition for pollinators with
   native plant species. Overall, our results indicated that the community
   structure was highly complex in comparison to temperate heathland
   communities. We discuss the observed differences in plant linkage and
   pollinator diversity and abundance between the sites with respect to
   habitat restoration management and its influence on pollination web
   structure and complexity. For habitat restoration to be successful in
   the long term, practitioners should aim to maintain structural diversity
   to support a species-rich and abundant pollinator assemblage which
   ensures native plant reproduction. (c) 2009 Rubel Foundation, ETH

Abstract = {{Pollination of Unonopsis stipitata (Annonaceae) by males of two
   perfume-collecting bees, Euglossa imperialis and Eulaema bombiformis
   (Euglossini) is described. This is the first detailed account of this
   pollination mode in a member of a basal angiosperm family. Pollinator
   behaviour, identification of the odour bouquet and electrophysiological
   reaction of one of the two pollinators to the odour bouquet were
   determined. The collected odour is produced by `osmophores' located
   adaxially on the petals. Starch and polysaccharides accumulated in
   petals are metabolized during odour emission. Mainly monoterpenes were
   detected in the scent samples, among them trans-carvone oxide. This
   molecule is thought by several authors to be the key attractant for male
   Eulaema bees and may be pivotal for convergent evolution of the
   perfume-collecting syndrome among dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous
   plants. It is speculated that Unonopsis, which on the basis of molecular
   age dating is considered a relatively recent genus of the Annonaceae
   (being 15-30 million years old), has diversified in relation to male
   euglossine bee pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Clonal growth can increase not only floral display but also geitonogamy
   and may affect sexual reproduction both positively and negatively. A
   clonal woody species, Prunus ssiori, was partially self-incompatible
   according to a pollination experiment. Its main pollinators, bumble
   bees, were often observed to consecutively visit inflorescences within a
   tree. Clone identification revealed that its genets formed mutually
   exclusive patches. These features suggest frequent geitonogamous
   pollination. In a 6.24-ha plot, 212 trees belonged to 59 genets, and 42
   genets consisted of a single tree, whereas the rest contained two or
   more clonal trees. The largest genet had 65 trees and occupied 0.4 of a
   hectare. Fruit set was measured in 127 inflorescences sampled from nine
   maternal trees at the center of the plot. Paternal genets of 107 of
   their 300 seeds were assigned in the plot using microsatellites. There
   were no selfed seeds. Male reproductive success (the probability that
   individual trees of each genet sired a seed) increased as tree size
   increased, as the distance between the trees and maternal trees
   decreased, when the genet did not contain the maternal trees, and when
   the genet consisted of a single tree. Female reproductive success (fruit
   set in individual inflorescences of each maternal tree) increased as the
   within-tree geitonogamy index, which reflected the frequency of
   pollination within the maternal tree, decreased. These results suggest
   that clonal growth reduces male reproductive success, at least, in P.
   ssiori, because of pollen discounting.}},

Abstract = {{Historical and recent records of both plants and insects are synthesized
   for uplands along the eastern edge of Maryland's Patuxent River from the
   edge of the Piedmont south to Jug Bay. This strip is characterized by
   deep sandy soils found in the Evesboro and Galestown sandy loams soil
   series. Within this narrow strip there exists a unique flora and fauna
   adapted to open dry sandy soils and occurring in small remnant patches
   associated with old sand mining operations and scattered protected
   areas. We illustrate the uniqueness of these sites using four groups:
   vascular plants, tenebrionid beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), tiger
   beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae), and bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea:
   Anthophila). Within each of these groups, rare species were detected
   whose populations were locally restricted to this soil type and whose
   nearest known populations were often hundreds of kilometers away. In
   addition to documenting the direct conservation importance of these
   small sandy openings along the Patuxent, we contrast the lack of any
   indication from vertebrate inventories that this region is unique. The
   combination of plant and insect inventories appears to be a better means
   of clarifying a site's importance than does any survey of a single
   taxonomic group.}},

Abstract = {{Alfalfa, Medicago sativa (L, 1753), one of the most important forage
   crops in the world; leafcutting bees which belong to Family Megachilidae
   are very promising pollinator of Alfalfa is USA and Canada. Different
   lefacutting natural nests were discovered in Ismailia (east part of
   Egypt). Artificial polystyrene foam nests were used for bees nesting; it
   is easy to manage and handle it in alfalfa fields. Different
   fertilization treatments were carried out for testing their impact on
   alfalfa seed production in the presence of artificial nests. The seed
   production depends basically on the pollination of leafcutting bees
   (tripping mechanism) more than fertilization treatment; we found no
   significant differences between different fertilization treatments. It
   is highly recommended to use phosphorus and potassium fertilizers during
   the blooming season synchronized with leafcutting bees.}},

Abstract = {{Two bumblebee species'. Bombus eximius and B. sonani, were reared
   artificially to investigate the characteristics of colony development
   Under laboratory conditions in Taiwan. A total of 53 queens of B.
   eximius and 37 queens of A sonani were collected in the field during
   2007 and 2008. A eximius has a longer period for colony initiation,
   immature stages ill each caste, and a larger colony size (63 - 271
   workers) than B. sonani (21 - 68 workers). Under the laboratory
   conditions queens of B. eximius laid 4 - 6 eggs in each eggcup, while B.
   sonani laid 2 - 3 eggs. The queen production point (QP) of A eximius
   started before the switch point (SP), and the queen production eggs were
   laid in phase 3. However, queen production eggs of B. sonani were
   probably laid during the Phase 2 and Phase 3. It was found that. B.
   eximius has a longer period of colony development than B. sonani, and
   the main difference between the two species was the number of third
   worker brood during Phase 3. In the field, the endemic species A sonani
   is considered to adapt to the temperate climate, while B. eximius is
   adapted to the subtropical climate ill Taiwan. The colony development
   and seasonal occurrence of B. eximius is expected to be from September
   -/October to April or later, and from April to August or later in B.
   sonani. The results showed no differences between the two species in the
   queen nesting rate, successful colonization rate, successful mating rate
   of laboratory-reared queens, and egg laying rare of laboratory-reared
   queens. We strongly suggest that B. eximius has great merit for
   pollination programs of commercial Utilization, while B. sonani call
   only serve as a substitute species for pollinations in Taiwan.}},

   the communities of two taxa of Hymenoptera in an agricultural area using
   direct seeding in Rio Claro city, southeastern Sao Paulo, with Moericke
   traps, focusing on the abundance of parasitoids and richness of
   Formicidae. A total of 5308 parasitoid hymenopterans was collected,
   comprising 8 superfamilies and 22 families; Mymaridae was the most
   abundant. Among Formicidae, 6039 individuals, 38 morphospecies, 19
   genera, 16 tribes, and 7 subfamilies were collected; Myrmicinae was the
   richest. the composition of these communities as a result of direct
   seeding and the importance of the use of Moericke traps in environmental

Abstract = {{Neotropical solitary bee-hunting wasps of the genus Trachypus
   (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) are ecologically and behaviourally little
   known. Here, we report information on prey types used by the digger wasp
   Trachypus denticollis Spinola in central Chile. Female wasps hunted at
   least 12 species of prey in five families, with Halictidae the most
   commonly represented. Brood cells are filled with one to eight prey.
   Cells with greater numbers of prey contained fewer species than
   expected, suggesting a temporal constancy in individual prey use. A
   positive linear relationship exists between the number of prey stored in
   a cell and their total biomass. Larger females tended to collect larger
   bees than did smaller females; however, because wasp and prey size
   distributions did not overlap, small wasps may be not constrained to a
   narrower prey spectrum compared to large ones. We conclude that prey
   size is an important factor determining prey use in T. denticollis, and
   these findings match that observed for species of the sister beewolf
   genus Philanthus and other philanthine wasps.}},

Abstract = {{Nierembergia (Solanaceae) contains 21 species found primarily in South
   America, with one species occurring disjunctly in Mexico. Among other
   features, a pollination system not found elsewhere in the Solanaceae
   typifies this genus. In most species, nectaries are absent, but
   oil-producing elaiophores are present on the corolla limb and these
   attract oil-collecting bees. Molecular phylogenetic hypotheses based on
   nuclear ITS and chloroplast rpl16 intron data support the monophyly of
   Nierembergia, which is sister to a clade composed of Bouchetia plus
   Hunzikeria. The data reconstruct two clades within the genus: one
   composed primarily of herbaceous species with broad stigmas and the
   second containing woody species with crescent-shaped stigmas.
   Morphological homoplasy is frequent among the species of the herbaceous
   clade, while the woody clade is morphologically cohesive. Chromosome
   counts are confirmed and karyotype features are given for 13
   Nierembergia species (including six varieties) and for Bouchetia
   anomala, Leptoglossis linifolia, and Petunia axillaris. The two clades
   are also supported by karyotypic features: one has asymmetrical
   karyotypes, small chromosomes, and two chromosome pairs with nucleolar
   organizing regions (NOR) and the other has symmetrical karyotypes, large
   chromosomes, and only one NOR.}},

Abstract = {{Aconitum heterophyllum Wall. is a critically endangered wild medicinal
   herb of alpine Himalaya and cultivation is recommended owing to its
   large demand in the herbal market and to ensure the conservation of wild
   habitats. Therefore, observations on floral biology, pollen germination,
   pollination, and fruit and seed setting after implying different
   breeding systems were carr ed out for its successful domestication and
   improvement in cultivation practices. The study reveals that the plants
   grown in hothouse conditions showed considerable variation in the
   production of flowers and seeds. Flowering occurs from the second week
   of September to late October, with 20 days of peak flowering. Anthers
   dehisced longitudinally between 7:30 and 11:00 AM, strongly dependent on
   higher temperature. The pollen grains per anther varied between 2000 and
   6000, which means an average of 80,000 pollen grains per flower. Nectar
   production begins at anther dehiscence and coincides with maximum
   stigmatic receptivity. Bees were observed as pollinators. Pollen
   germination and pollen tube elongation were maximum in 5\% sucrose.

Abstract = {{Two new halictine bees (Halictidae: Halictinae) are described and
   figured from females preserved in Early Miocene (Burdigalian) amber from
   the Dominican Republic. Oligochlora semirugosa sp. n. (Augochlorini) is
   similar to O. micheneri Engel but differs in the shape of the pronotal
   dorsolateral angle, the partially rugulose gena (entirely imbricate in
   the latter species), and the sculpturing of the face, mesosoma, and
   metasomal terga. Nesagapostemon moronei gen. n. sp. n. (Caenohalictini)
   resembles Eickwortapis in the absence of carinae bordering the dorsal
   horizontal surface of the propodeum while having the vertical posterior
   surface encircled. The genus differs from Eickwortapis in the much
   larger and more robust body size (nearly twice as large), the
   non-slanting and shorter horizontal surface of the propodeum,
   sculpturing, and pilosity of the hind legs. A second specimen of O.
   grimaldii Engel is recorded and a provisional key to halictid bees in
   Dominican amber is provided.}},

Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are confronted with spatial heterogeneity in. oral
   resources. Acquiring information about their environment enables
   pollinators to exploit. oral resources optimally, and hence strongly
   affects their fitness. Despite their evolutionary importance, spatial
   resource distribution and social information use have never been
   addressed in a plant-pollinator framework. We experimentally tested the
   effects of inadvertent social information (ISI) use (without or with an
   experienced demonstrator) in relation to spatial flower distribution
   (random or patchy) in foraging Bombus terrestris. We studied naive bees'
   associative learning when confronted with rewarding and nonrewarding
   flowers that differed slightly in colour, reproducing the natural
   mimicry of deceptive species. Naive bees were more efficient foragers
   with than without a demonstrator in the patchy flower distribution,
   suggesting that they used ISI from conspecifics, probably in the form of
   social attraction at the patch scale. In the random flower distribution,
   however, ISI did not improve performance of naive bees, and could not
   replace individual sampling. Analyses of nonrewarding intraspecific
   transitions indicate that the efficiency of naive bees in deceptive
   species pollination was lowered when rewarding and nonrewarding
   inflorescences were patchily distributed and especially when bees relied
   on ISI. Thus, spatial flower distribution and ISI availability interact
   in determining pollinator behaviour, which has important consequences
   for plant community pollination. This suggests that bumblebees are
   adapted to exploit patchily distributed resources socially, a
   characteristic that might be exploited by deceptive plant species. By
   coupling behavioural and community ecology, this study offers promising
   perspectives for cognitive ecology studies in plant-pollinator
   interactions. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Comparative Anatomy and Morphology of Nectar-producing Melastomataceae}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{899-909}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Most neotropical Melastomataceae have bee-pollinated flowers with
   poricidal anthers. However, nectar rewards are known to be produced in
   about 80 species in eight genera from four different tribes. These
   nectar-producing species are pollinated by both vertebrates and
   invertebrates.
   The floral morphology and anatomy of 14 species was studied in six
   genera of nectar-producing Melastomataceae (Blakea, Brachyotum,
   Charianthus, Huilaea, Meriania and Miconia). Anatomical methods included
   scanning electron microscopy, and serial sections of paraffin-embedded
   flowers.
   All vertebrate-pollinated melastome flowers have petals that do not open
   completely at anthesis, thus forming a pseudo-tubular corolla, while
   closely related species that are bee pollinated have rotate or reflexed
   corollas. In most species, nectar secretion is related to stomatal or
   epidermal nectaries and not filament slits as previously reported.
   Moreover, the nectar is probably supplied by large vascular bundles near
   the release area. Blakea and Huilaea have nectary stomata located upon
   the dorsal anther connective appendages. Brachyotum also has nectary
   stomata on the anther connectives, but these are distributed lengthwise
   along most of the connective. Meriania may release nectar through the
   anther connective, but has additional nectary stomata on the inner walls
   of the hypanthium. Miconia has nectary stomata on the ovary apex.
   Charianthus nectaries were not found, but there is circumstantial
   evidence that nectar release occurs through the epidermis at the apex of
   the ovary and the lower portions of the inner wall of the hypanthium.
   Nectar release in Melastomataceae is apparently related to nectary
   stomata and not filament slits. The presence of nectary stomata on
   stamens and on ovary apices in different lineages suggests that the
   acquisition of nectaries is a derived condition. Nectary location also
   supports a derived condition, because location is strongly consistent
   within each genus, but differs between genera.}},

Abstract = {{Bee-pollinated plants are frequently dichogamous: e. g. each flower has
   a discernable male and female phase, with only the male phase offering a
   pollen reward. Pollen-collecting bees should therefore discriminate
   against female-phase flowers to maximise their rate of pollen harvest,
   but this behaviour would reduce plant fitness due to inferior
   pollination. Here, we test the hypothesis that flowers use
   pollen-mimicking floral guides to prevent flower-phase discrimination.
   Such floral guides resemble pollen in spectral reflection properties and
   are widespread among angiosperm flowers. In an array of artificial
   flowers, bumblebees learned less well to discriminate between flower
   variants simulating different flowering phases when both flower variants
   carried an additional pollen-yellow guide mark. This effect depended
   crucially on the pollen-yellow colour of the guide mark and on its
   spatial position within the artificial flower. We suggest that floral
   guides evolved to inhibit flower-phase learning in bees by exploiting
   the innate colour preferences of their pollinators.}},

Title = {{Little evidence for negative effects of an invasive alien plant on

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1353-1363}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many invasive alien plants occur in large populations with abundant
   flowers which are highly attractive to pollinators, and thus might
   affect pollination of co-occurring native species. This study focuses on
   the invasive Heracleum mantegazzianum and distance-dependent effects on
   pollination of Mimulus guttatus in abandoned grassland over 2 years.
   First, we examined pollinator abundance in yellow traps at 0, 10, 30 and
   60-200 m from H. mantegazzianum. We then placed M. guttatus plants at
   the same distances to monitor effects of the invasive species on
   pollinator visitation and seed set of neighbouring plants. Finally, we
   conducted a garden experiment to test if deposition of H. mantegazzianum
   pollen reduces seed set in M. guttatus. No distance effect was found for
   the number of bumblebees in traps, although the invasive species
   attracted a diverse assemblage of insects, and visitation of M. guttatus
   was enhanced close to H. mantegazzianum. This positive effect was not
   reflected by seed set of M. guttatus, and heterospecific pollen
   decreased seed set in these plants. Overall there is little evidence for
   negative effects of the invasive species on pollination of neighbouring
   plants, and flower visitation even increases close to the invaded

Abstract = {{To assess the pollen hosts of 60 western palaearctic bee species of the
   genus Colletes (Colletidae), we microscopically analysed 1336 pollen
   loads of collected females. Twenty-six species (43.3\%) were found to be
   specialized at the level of plant family, subfamily or genus.
   Thirty-four species (56.7\%) proved to be pollen generalists to varying
   degrees, visiting the flowers of up to 15 different plant families.
   Flowers of the subfamily Asteroideae (Asteraceae) are by far the most
   important pollen source, contributing 23.6\% to the pollen-plant
   spectrum of the whole bee genus. The high significance of Asteroideae
   pollen is due to the large number of specialists: 14 Colletes species
   belonging to four different taxonomic groups harvest pollen exclusively
   or predominantly on flowers of the Asteroideae. By striking contrast,
   Asteroideae pollen plays only a marginal role in the diets of the pollen
   generalists: it was recorded in only 2.7\% of the pollen loads and in
   seven out of the 34 pollen generalists. Among the few generalists
   exploiting Asteroideae for pollen, three closely related species have
   ancestors which were possibly specialized on Asteraceae. The pattern of
   use of Asteroideae pollen by the Colletes bees supports recent findings
   that this pollen possesses unfavourable or protective properties, which
   render its digestion difficult, and suggests that bees need
   physiological adaptations to successfully utilize it. (C) 2008 The

Abstract = {{During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on
   agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural grasslands have been
   highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural
   landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent
   further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent
   for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our
   aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of
   pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are
   related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any
   differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if
   red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species
   richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all
   semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50
   km(2) in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to
   September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness
   of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and
   after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species
   richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural
   grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural
   grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the
   density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the
   proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary
   bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was
   positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after
   mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of
   burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation
   height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest
   on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional
   hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting
   traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K.
   arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high
   species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species.
   Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be
   used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of the butterfly bush, Buddleja davidii Franch., are visited by
   butterflies as well as other insects. Night captures revealed also that
   moths visit butterfly bush flowers. Moths captured in traps over flowers
   included 12 species of Noctuidae, 6 species of Pyralidae 2 species of
   Geometridae, and 1 tortricid species. The majority of moths trapped at
   these flowers were cabbage loopers, Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), and
   alfalfa loopers, Autographa californica (Speyer). Both males and females
   were captured at butterfly bush flowers. Additionally, butterflies,
   bees, wasps, flies, and other insects also were captured. Analysis of
   volatile compounds collected from air over clusters of butterfly bush
   flowers yielded the consistent presence of nine chemicals: benzaldehyde,
   6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, hexyl acetate, 4-oxoisophorone,
   (E,E)-alpha-farnesene, (Z)-cinnamaldehyde, dihydrooxoisophorone,
   beta-cyclocitral, and oxoisophorone oxide. Emitted amounts of these
   floral odorants averaged 57 ng per h per floret or 21 mu g per h per
   flower cluster (raceme). Five of those floral chemicals benzaldehyde,
   4-oxoisophorone, dihydrooxoisophorone, oxoisophorone oxide, and
   (E,E)-alpha-farnesene triggered antennal responses in cabbage looper
   moths, while benzaldehyde, oxoisophorone oxide, and 4-oxoisophorone also
   stimulated antennal responses in alfalfa looper moths. Some of these
   compounds may be attractants or co-attractants for moths and play a key
   role in locating flowers as nectar sources.}},

Abstract = {{Determining factors affecting pollinator visitation is the key to
   understanding the reproductive success of animal-pollinated plants. The
   inclination of the ground where plants grow, which has been little
   studied, could be one such factor. There may be differences in foraging
   performance when visiting flowers on horizontal planes compared with
   flowers on inclines planes. And if this is the case, pollinators may
   have a preference for horizontal or inclined planes. To test these
   possibilities, a series of laboratory experiments with bumble bees and
   arrays of artificial flowers were conducted.
   In the first experiment, bees were presented with a pair of floral
   arrays, one on a horizontal plane and one sloping. The bees preferred
   visiting flowers on the horizontal array.
   In the second experiment, bees were allowed to forage on a flower array
   tilted at various angles ranging from 0 degrees (horizontal) to 90
   degrees (vertical). It was found that their foraging performance
   decreased with increasing angles, showing a 9.1\% reduction from 0
   degrees to 90 degrees arrays. This reduction was caused by an increased
   travel time between flowers, when moving upslope or downslope.
   These results suggest that plants growing on steep slopes may be less
   preferred by pollinators. Future studies are needed to clarify how
   slopes affect pollinator behaviour in field conditions and the
   ecological influences on plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Many Tibetans who were formerly nomadic yak herders are settling near

   We find that intensive summer grazing significantly reduces the
   vegetation height and is associated with significant reductions in
   bumblebee-food-plant abundance and bumblebee diversity. For the
   significantly reduced bumblebee species, we identify the most frequently
   used and preferred bumblebee-food plants. For the food plants, we
   identify changes in absolute flower availability and changes in
   bumblebee visits. In particular, reductions in the bumblebees Bombus

Abstract = {{Pollinators play a key role in the reproduction of most plant species,
   and pollinator and plant diversity are often related. We studied an
   experimental gradient of plant species richness for a better
   understanding of plant-pollinator community interactions and their
   temporal variability, because in non-experimental field surveys plant
   richness is often confounded with gradients in management, soil
   fertility, and community composition. We observed pollinator species
   richness and frequency of visits six times in 73 plots over two years,
   and used advanced statistical analysis to account for the high number of
   zeroes that often occur in count data of rare species. The frequency of
   pollinator visits increased linearly with both the blossom cover and the
   number of flowering plant species, which was closely related to the
   total number of plant species, whereas the number of pollinator species
   followed a saturation curve. The presence of particularly attractive
   plant species was only important for the frequency of flower visits, but
   not to the richness of pollinators. Plant species richness, blossom
   cover, and the presence of attractive plant species enhanced the
   temporal stability in the frequency of pollinator visits.
   In conclusion, grasslands with high plant diversity enhance and
   stabilize frequent and diverse flower visitations, which should sustain
   effective pollination and plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nectar robbing on plant fitness is poorly understood and
   restricted to a few plant species. Furthermore, the available studies
   generally evaluate the effects of nectar robbing on female fitness,
   disregarding the male component. Here we measured the effects of the
   nectar-robbing bumblebees on male (measured as pollen analogue flow
   distance) and female (measured as seed production) reproductive success
   in the insect-dependent Polygala vayredae, a narrow endemic species from
   the pre-Pyrenees (Spain). Intense nectar robbing by bumblebees
   significantly reduced the nectar available to legitimate pollinators in
   the studied population, and this reduction affected both male and female
   fitness. Significant differences were observed in fluorescent dye
   dispersion between robbed and non-robbed flowers within the population.
   Fluorescent dyes from non-robbed flowers were dispersed to larger
   distances and over a larger number of flowers when compared with robbed
   ones. Moreover, significant differences were observed in both fruit set
   and seed ovule ratios between the two groups, with non-robbed flowers
   presenting higher reproductive outcomes. However, no effect on seed
   weight was detected among treatments. The data obtained suggest that in
   this species, nectar robbing has important indirect and negative effects
   on plant fecundity, through both male and female functions, due to a
   modification in the foraging behaviour of legitimate visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Many members of the family Thymelaeaceae are highly praised and
   economically important for the production of fragrant scent, but little
   is known about the ecological significance of their secondary
   metabolites. To explore the potential role that secondary metabolites
   play in pollination, we studied the pollination systems of five
   Diplomorpha species in Japan by investigating their floral morphology
   and flower-visiting insect fauna. We also analyzed the composition and
   temporal emission pattern of floral volatiles in one of the species to
   determine if there were any characteristics associated with the observed
   flower visitors. In Diplomorpha, anthesis began at dusk and various
   nocturnal moths were found visiting the flowers, often carrying numerous
   pollen grains on their proboscises. However, no hawkmoths were observed
   visiting Diplomorpha flowers. Diurnal insects visited the flowers less
   often, and most of them had short mouthparts and did not effectively
   contact the stigma. The floral scent of Diplomorpha sikokiana was
   released only at night when the moths were active and consisted mainly
   of monoterpenes and benzenoids, with a small amount of a sesquiterpene.
   The present study is the first to examine the pollination system of
   Diplomorpha and suggests that these plants exhibit a range of floral
   features associated with pollination by nocturnal moths. The single
   ovule in Diplomorpha flowers probably does not favor pollination by
   optimally foraging bees, which are more likely to cause intraplant
   pollen transfer, and might have facilitated adaptation to pollination by
   nocturnal moths, despite the lower number of pollen grains that are
   carried by these insects.}},

Abstract = {{Astrophytum asterias (star cactus) is an obligate outcrosser that does
   not reproduce vegetatively, so all reproduction is the result of
   inter-plant transfer of pollen by insects. By measuring seed set
   resulting from single pollinator visits, we evaluated effectiveness
   (mean seed set per visit) and importance of pollinator (effectiveness
   times frequency of visitation) of insects visiting flowers of A.
   asterias. Results indicate that the most common visitor, Macrotera
   lobata, is relatively ineffective pollinator, while the less common
   Diadasia rinconis is the most effective and important pollinator. Two
   behavioral variables (duration of visit, whether or not visitors landed
   on the stigma) were assessed as possible predictors of fruit set. While
   duration of visit was not predictive of fruit set, there was a positive
   correlation between fruit set and the proportion of visits a visitor
   landed on the stigma when entering the flower.}},

Abstract = {{Substantial industrial development, agricultural intensification, and an
   increasing human population have led to the demise of many seminatural
   habitats, Such as wet meadows, in many Countries of Europe. This process
   can cause the extinction and decline of associated insect species. The
   present paper is the first study analyzing wild bee diversity and
   abundance patterns in wet meadows. We Surveyed bees using pan traps,
   transect walks, and nest traps in four Molinietum (Poaceae) meadows near
   Krakow, Poland. During one season, we identified a relatively high
   gamma-diversity of wild bees, consisting of 105 species (13 from the
   Polish Red List) belonging to 22 genera, which represent almost
   one-fourth of the Polish bees. The wild bee fauna between sites was not
   variable, which was indicated by low beta-diversity. We found that
   nesting preference of bees did riot differ between the study area and
   xerothermic meadows, which suggests that differentiation in bee fauna of
   wet and dry grasslands is mostly due to food specialization rather than
   nesting preference. Abundance analysis of the bee community Showed that
   the least abundant species were disproportionately comprised of
   oligolectic species, indicating that species closely associated to
   plants of wet meadows are especially threatened. Moreover, using
   occurrence data we found that 34\% of the species belonging to the
   families Halictidae, Melittidae, and the tribe Nomadini Found in wet
   meadows are considered rare in Poland. Our results highlight an urgent
   need to perform further investigations and develop specific protection
   plans for bees not only in Krakow's Molinietum meadows, but also in
   wetlands throughout Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Forests with different flora and vegetation types harbor different
   assemblages of flower visitors, plant-pollinator interactions vary among
   forests. In monsoon-dominated East and Southeast Asia, there is a
   characteristic gradient in climate along latitude. creating a broad
   spectrum of forest types with potentially diverse pollinator
   communities. To detect a geographical pattern of plant-pollinator
   interactions. we investigated flowering phenology and pollinator
   assemblages in the least-studied forest type. i.e.. tropical monsoon
   forest. in the Vientiane plain in Laos. Throughout the 5-year study, we
   observed 171 plant species blooming and detected flower visitors on 145
   species. Flowering occurred throughout the ear. although the number of
   flowering plant species, peaked at the end of dry season. The dominant
   canopy trees, including Dipterocarpaccae, bloomed annually, in contrast
   to the general flowering that occurs in Southeast Asian tropical rain
   forests. Among the 134 native plain species, 68 were pollinated by
   hymenopterans and others by lepidopterans. beetles, flies, or diverse
   insects. Among the observed bees. Xylocopa megachilids. and honeybees
   mainly contributed to the pollination of canopy trees, whereas
   long-term, tongued Amegilla bees pollinated diverse perennials with long
   corolla tubes. This is the first community-level study of
   plant-pollinator interactions in an Asian tropical monsoon forest

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{699-711}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Bignoniaceae is a Neotropical family with > 100
   genera, only two of which, Jacaranda and Digomphia, have a developed
   staminode. Jacaranda oxyphylla, whose flowers possess a conspicuous
   glandular staminode, is a zoophilous cerrado species. Here, the
   composition of the secretion of the glandular trichome and the influence
   of the staminode on the pollination biology and reproductive success of
   J. oxyphylla were studied.
   Methods The floral morphology, pollen viability, stigma receptivity,
   nectar volume and nectar concentration were studied. Compatibility
   system experiments were performed and floral visitors were observed and
   identified. Experiments comparing the effect of staminode presence and
   absence on pollen removal and pollen deposition efficiency were
   conducted in open-pollinated flowers. Histochemistry, thin-layer
   chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization
   detection (GC-FID) analyses were performed to determine the main
   chemical components of the staminode's glandular trichome secretion.
   Key Results Flower anthesis lasted 2 d and, despite the low frequency of
   flower visitation, pollination seemed to be effected mainly by
   medium-sized Eulaema nigrita and Bombus morio bees, by the small bee
   Exomalopsis fulvofasciata and occasionally by hummingbirds. Small bees
   belonging to the genera Ceratina, Augochlora and Trigona were frequent
   visitors, collecting pollen. Jacaranda oxyphylla is predominantly
   allogamous. Staminode removal resulted in fewer pollen grains deposited
   on stigmas but did not affect total pollen removal. The secretion of
   capitate glandular trichome occurs continually; the main chemical
   compounds detected histochemically were phenolic and terpenoid
   (essential oils and resins). Monoterpene cineole, pentacyclic
   triterpenes and steroids were identified by TLC and GC-FID.
   Conclusions The staminode of J. oxyphyllla is multifunctional and its
   importance for female reproductive success was attributed mainly to the
   secretion produced by capitate glandular trichomes. This secretion is
   involved in complex chemical interactions with pollinating bees,
   including the solitary bees Euglossini. These bees are common
   pollinators of various species of Jacaranda.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Until recently, there was no consensus regarding the
   phylogenetic relationships of the Neotropical orchid genera Scuticaria
   Lindl. and Dichaea Lindl. However, recent evidence derived from both
   gross morphological and molecular studies supports the inclusion of
   Scuticaria and Dichaea in sub-tribes Maxillariinae and Zygopetalinae,
   respectively. The present paper describes the labellar micromorphology
   of both genera and seeks to establish whether labellar characters
   support the assignment of Scuticaria and Dichaea to these sub-tribes.
   Methods The labella of four species of Scuticaria and 14 species of
   Dichaea were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy, and their micromorphology was compared with that of
   representative species of Maxillariinae sensu lato and Zygopetalinae
   (Huntleya clade).
   Key Results and Conclusions In most specimens of Scuticaria examined,
   the papillose labella bear uniseriate, multicellular, unbranched
   trichomes. However, in S. steelii (Lindl.) Lindl., branched hairs may
   also be present and some trichomes may fragment and form pseudopollen.
   Multicellular, leaf-like scales were also present in one species of
   Scuticaria. Similar, unbranched hairs are present in certain species of
   Maxillaria Ruiz \& Pav. (Maxillariinae sensu stricto) and Chaubardia
   Rchb. f. (Huntleya clade). As yet, moniliform, pseudopollen-forming
   hairs have not been observed for Zygopetalinae, but their presence in
   Scuticaria steelii, Maxillaria and Heterotaxis Lindl. supports the
   placing of Scuticaria in Maxillariinae. As other genera are sampled, the
   presence of branched hairs, hitherto unknown for Maxillariinae sensu
   lato, may prove to be a useful character in taxonomy and phylogenetic
   studies. Euglossophily occurs in Dichaea, as well as Chondrorhyncha
   Lindl. and Pescatorea Rchb. f. (Huntleya clade), and all three genera
   tend to lack distinctive labellar features. Instead, lip micromorphology
   is relatively simple and glabrous or papillose. However, two of the
   Dichaea species examined bear unicellular, labellar trichomes very
   similar to those found in Bifrenaria Lindl. (pollinated by both
   euglossine bees and Bombus spp.), and this feature may have arisen by
   convergence in response to similar pollination pressures.}},

Abstract = {{As suburban landscapes expand, it is critical to understand their
   capacity to support wildlife. Pollinators, specifically bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), are to some degree compatible with
   urbanization and may be able to exist in suburbs in diverse assemblages.
   We surveyed 21 residential gardens for bees in Westchester County, a
   suburban area immediately north of New York City. From a sample of 1,675
   individuals, we documented 110 species, of which 95\% were native, 50\%
   were solitary, and 93\% were polylectic. In terms of abundance of
   specimens, eusocial (50\% of specimens), native (97\%), and polylectic
   (98\%) bees were dominant. Contrary to our expectation, based on
   previous bee surveys in urban landscapes, the bee community documented
   was not depauperate in either soil-nesting or parasitic species (65 and
   19\% of species, respectively), nor was it enriched in exotic species
   (6\% of species). Instead, the assemblage resembled the richer bee fauna
   documented at a 1,520-ha research preserve (forest) located in the same
   region, although certain specialist (oligolectic) and/or
   forest-associated species were absent. These results suggest that
   suburban landscapes in eastern North America have the potential to host
   relatively diverse and intact bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed at developing an agro-biodiversity indicator based on
   trophic interactions between 25 common arable weeds and individual
   groups of farmland birds, pollinators (wild bees), phytophagous insects
   and insect pests. Each weed species was weighted based on the number of
   reported linkages with each animal group. Four biodiversity indices
   based on these weights were constructed and applied to exploring the
   ecological consequences of long-term changes in weed populations in
   Finland. Data were used from weed surveys of Finnish spring cereal
   fields conducted in the 1960s, 1980s and 1990s. The relative importance
   of weed species varied according to animal groups. Annual weed species
   able to produce numerous seeds were important for the farmland birds and
   some perennial weed species were important for the pollinators. The
   highest number of linkages was established between weed species and
   phytophagous insects. The number of harmful pest species associated with
   broad-leaved weeds was low for all species. The general pattern of
   changes in values of indices over recent decades was similar: there was
   a marked decline in the values between the 1960s and the 1980s, and a
   slight increase between the 1980s and the 1990s. These changes were
   regarded as being a consequence of changes in the intensity of
   agricultural practices. The slowest recovery of the values was for
   pollinators. The results suggest that the ecological consequences of
   changes in the intensity of agriculture can be explored with the aid of
   a biodiversity indicator based on species interactions. Owing to the
   differences in the importance of weed species for different animal
   groups, maintaining weed species richness is necessary to ensure
   ecosystem services are provided for the higher trophic levels in
   farmland. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Females of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima, recently naturalized in
   southern Florida, routinely collect resin to construct their brood cells
   from the flowers of two Clusia (Clusiaceae) and two Dalechampia

   of these species including: (1) the newly naturalized D. scandens, which
   it pollinates in Mexico; (2) the ornamental D. aristolochiifolia native
   to Peru; and (3) the ornamental C. lanceolata native to Brazil, but not
   the apomictic Clusia rosea native to Florida. Field observations
   indicated that the bee promotes outcrossing in a naturalized D. scandens
   population. Comparisons of fruit set between unmanipulated control
   flowers and flowers supplemented with additional pollen indicated that
   the presence of bee eliminates pollen limitation for cultivated C.

Abstract = {{Bee pollinators are currently recorded with many different sampling
   methods. However, the relative performances of these methods have not
   been systematically evaluated and compared. In response to the strong
   need to record ongoing shifts in pollinator diversity and abundance,
   global and regional pollinator initiatives must adopt standardized
   sampling protocols when developing large-scale and long-term monitoring
   schemes.
   We systematically evaluated the performance of six sampling methods
   (observation plots, pan traps, standardized and variable transect walks,
   trap nests with reed internodes or paper tubes) that are commonly used
   across a wide range of geographical regions in Europe and in two habitat
   types (agricultural and seminatural). We focused on bees since they
   represent the most important pollinator group worldwide. Several
   characteristics of the methods were considered in order to evaluate
   their performance in assessing bee diversity: sample coverage, observed
   species richness, species richness estimators, collector biases
   (identified by subunit-based rarefaction curves), species composition of
   the samples, and the indication of overall bee species richness
   (estimated from combined total samples).
   The most efficient method in all geographical regions, in both the
   agricultural and seminatural habitats, was the pan trap method. It had
   the highest sample coverage, collected the highest number of species,
   showed negligible collector bias, detected similar species as the
   transect methods, and was the best indicator of overall bee species
   richness. The transect methods were also relatively efficient, but they
   had a significant collector bias. The observation plots showed poor
   performance. As trap nests are restricted to cavity-nesting bee species,
   they had a naturally low sample coverage. However, both trap nest types
   detected additional species that were not recorded by any of the other
   methods.
   For large-scale and long-term monitoring schemes with surveyors with
   different experience levels, we recommend pan traps as the most
   efficient, unbiased, and cost-effective method for sampling bee
   diversity. Trap nests with reed internodes could be used as a
   complementary sampling method to maximize the numbers of collected
   species. Transect walks are the principal method for detailed studies
   focusing on plant-pollinator associations. Moreover, they can be used in
   monitoring schemes after training the surveyors to standardize their
   collection skills.}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance of foliar damage is widely recognized as an effective defense
   against herbivores and pathogens. However, tolerance of the impacts of
   antagonists on pollination success is less well understood. Here, we
   extend the framework of tolerance to foliar damage to understand how
   plants mitigate the pollination and fitness costs of. oral larceny
   (i.e., the consumption of. oral nectar often without pollination). We
   focused on two mechanisms: high nectar rewards per flower to feed all.
   oral visitors and high flower production to compensate for reproductive
   losses under reduced pollination and seed set. We compared the efficacy
   of these mechanisms in two plant species: Polemonium viscosum and
   Ipomopsis aggregata. In Polemonium, ants acting as larcenists reduce
   nectar accumulation but do not completely empty flowers. When nectar
   reserves were augmented, ant consumption increased, negating the
   efficacy of this putative tolerance mechanism. Similarly, in Ipomopsis,
   nectar addition had little effect on tolerance to larceny by bumble
   bees, perhaps because residual intact flowers do not have enough nectar
   to compensate for lost rewards. Flower production in both species
   mitigated some of the negative impacts of larceny on seed set. In
   Polemonium,flower number was not plastic in response to larceny, but
   large inflorescences enhanced female fitness only when larcenists were
   present, suggesting that ``surplus'' flowers in large inflorescences can
   function to replace reproductive losses due to larceny. In Ipomopsis,
   high rates of larceny induced flower production, but the fecundity
   benefits of making more flowers declined inversely to larcenist
   intensity. Overall, our results suggest (1) that tolerance to. oral
   larceny involves ``banking'' extra flowers to replace lost reproduction
   rather than maintaining pollination of ones with larceny, and (2) that
   the efficacy of flower production as a tolerance mechanism varies
   inversely to larceny rate.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Although specific associations between spiders and particular types of
   plants have been reported for several taxonomic groups, their
   consequences for spiders and plants are still poorly understood. The
   most common South American lynx spiders, Peucetia flava and P.
   rubrolineata, live strictly associated with various plant species that
   have glandular trichomes. To understand more about these spider-plant
   relationships, we investigated the influence of the spiders on the
   fitness of a neotropical glandular shrub (Trichogoniopsis adenantha) and
   on the arthropod community structure on the plant. We also tested
   whether glandular hairs provided any benefit to the spiders. Spiders
   reduced the abundance of several species and guilds of herbivores on the
   leaves and inflorescences. Consequently, damage to the leaves, capitula,
   ovaries, corollas, and stigmas caused by leaf-mining and chewing
   insects, as well as endophagous insects, were strongly reduced in the
   presence of Peucetia spp. Although the spiders fed on flower visitors,
   their negative influence on ovary fertilization was only marginally
   nonsignificant (P=0.065). Spiders on plants of Trichogoniopsis adenantha
   that fed on common fruit flies that had died before adhering to the
   glandular trichomes did not lose body mass. However, those living on
   plants without stalked glandular trichomes (Melissa officinalis) did not
   feed on dead flies and lost 13-20\% of their biomass. These results
   indicate that Peucetia spiders are effective plant bodyguards and that
   when there is limited live prey they may feed on insect carcasses
   adhered to glandular trichomes. Since several spider species of the
   genus Peucetia live strictly associated with glandular trichome-bearing
   plants in neotropical, Neartic, Paleartic, and Afrotropical regions,
   this type of facultative mutualism involving Peucetia and glandular
   plants may be common worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen-mediated gene flow between red clover fields by bumblebees is
   predicted by estimating or simulating the parameters in a gene flow
   model for insect-pollinated crops. Generally, the predicted level of
   gene flow was found to depend on the visiting bee species and the
   spatial arrangement of the red clover fields. When the fields are close
   to each other, the gene flow depends mainly on the typical foraging
   distance of the visiting bee species, but when the fields are far apart,
   the gene flow between red clover fields is more sensitive to the
   distances between red clover fields than to the actual bumblebee species
   that pollinates the fields. Using the suggested methodology, the gene
   flow may be predicted in different agricultural scenarios. For example,
   if the gene flow between red clover fields is mediated by Bombus
   terrestris and the red clover fields that were assumed to be quadrates
   with sides of 100 m are separated by 200 m, then the median gene flow is
   predicted to be 0.17\%.}},

Abstract = {{The exotic tree Muntingia calabura L. (Muntingiaceae), a species native
   to Central America, is used as fish feed and fiber and cellulose
   production in Brazil. This study was carried out in urban areas and
   verified the reproductive biology of this plant species. Flower and
   fruit morphology, compatibility system, reproductive phenology,
   pollination and frugivore animals, and germination of disseminated seeds
   were recorded by standard field and laboratory procedures. This tree is
   self-compatible and autonomously self-pollinated, with its flowers being
   mainly visited by bees and its fruits consumed by birds and bats.
   Germination of its dispersed seeds is fast and occurs at a high rate.
   The results of this work suggest that M. calabura is very adaptable to
   cultivated areas, thus being an excellent choice for urban
   reforestation. However, its reproductive characteristics place this

Abstract = {{Most Aloe species are wholly or partly bird-pollinated, but a suite of
   seven Aloe species and two genera (Haworthia and Chortilirion) that
   likely belong within the Aloe clade (Asphodelaceae, subfamily Alooidea)
   share morphological characteristics suggestive of insect pollination.
   Field studies of one of these species, Aloe inconspicua, revealed that
   it is effectively and exclusively pollinated by insects, especially
   females of Amegilla fallax (Apidae) that visit its flowers for nectar
   and pollen. The small (7.9 mm +/- SD = 2.0) white flowers produce a
   standing nectar crop of 0.097 +/- 0.10 mu l, much less than that of
   bird-pollinated aloes. Unlike other aloes studied to date, birds did not
   visit A. inconspicua, and bird exclusion had no effect on fruit or seed
   production. Visiting individuals of A. fallax typically contacted
   stigmas and anthers with their heads while accessing nectar, and single
   visits by them and a halictid bee resulted in seed set. Recent molecular
   evidence suggests that insect-pollination is the ancestral state for the
   Alooidea. If similar floral morphology indicates similar pollination
   systems, shifts from insect- to bird-pollination and possibly reversions
   back to insect pollination have occurred repeatedly within the ALOE
   clade. (C) 2008 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pterygodium vermiferum, a new orchid belonging to the subtribe
   Coryciinae, is described from the coastal region in the southwestern
   part of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa. It is most similar to
   Pterygodium volucris (L.f.) Sw. and differs most obviously in the
   possession of several remarkable long twisted appendages arising from
   the rostellum and in having a cucullate rather than tubular galea. The
   flowers open very briefly before wilting and setting seed by autonomous
   self-pollination. The morphological autapomorphies that define the
   species are interpreted as adaptations for autonomous self-pollination
   in a clade that is ancestrally pollinated by oil-collecting Rediviva
   bees. The description of P. vermiferum requires that another pollination
   independent Pterygodium taxon (P. newdigateae Bolus var. cleistogamum
   Bolus) also be awarded species status. (C) 2008 SAAB. Published by

Abstract = {{Reproduction of flowering dogwood trees occurs via obligate
   out-crossing, and U.S. native bees have been suggested to be primary
   pollinators of this ecologically and economically important deciduous
   tree. Whether floral volatiles play a role in reproduction of the
   dogwood remains unclear. Objectives of this study were to identify
   principal volatile chemicals emitted from dogwood flowers and to assess
   a temporal volatile emission profile and volatile consistency across
   four cultivars. Inflorescences with intact bracts and 5 cm flower
   pedicel were removed from dogwood trees and subjected to headspace
   volatile collection. Six principal volatile compounds were detected from
   the flowers of the cultivar `World's Fair' with 3-formylpyridine as the
   most abundant constituent. Subsequent headspace analyses performed using
   inflorescences without bracts or floral pedicels alone indicated that
   3-formylpyridine, E-beta-ocimene, S-linalool, and ketoisophorone were
   mainly emitted from inflorescences. Experiments were also conducted to
   determine whether volatile emissions differed across time and between
   different cultivars of flowering dogwood. When volatile emission was
   analyzed for 48 h using 12 h light/dark cycles, the emission of several
   volatile compounds displayed diurnal patterns. Finally, whereas florets
   in inflorescences of four different dogwood cultivars emitted similar
   levels of the six principal floral volatile chemicals, `Cherokee Brave'
   flowers alone yielded 4-methoxybenzaldehyde and germacrene-D. The
   implications of the findings of this study to dogwood breeding programs
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive role of corolla shape has been often asserted without an
   empirical demonstration of how natural selection acts on this trait. In
   generalist plants, in which flowers are visited by diverse pollinator
   fauna that commonly vary spatially, detecting pollinator-mediated
   selection on corolla shape is even more difficult. In this study, we
   explore the mechanisms promoting selection on corolla shape in the
   generalist crucifer Erysimum mediohispanicum Polatschek (Brassicaceae).
   We found that the main pollinators of E. mediohispanicum (large bees,
   small bees and bee flies) discriminate between different corolla shapes
   when offered artificial flowers without reward. Importantly, different
   pollinators prefer different shapes: bees prefer flowers with narrow
   petals, whereas bee flies prefer flowers with rounded overlapping
   petals. We also found that flowers with narrow petals (those preferred
   by bees) produce both more pollen and nectar than those with rounded
   petals. Finally, different plant populations were visited by different
   faunas. As a result, we found spatial variation in the selection acting
   on corolla shape. Selection favoured flowers with narrow petals in the
   populations where large or small bees are the most abundant pollinator
   groups. Our study suggests that pollinators, by preferring flowers with
   high reward, exert strong selection on the E. mediohispanicum corolla
   shape. The geographical variation in the pollinator-mediated selection
   on E. mediohispanicum corolla shape suggests that phenotypic evolution
   and diversification can occur in this complex floral trait even without
   specialization.}},

Abstract = {{Niche complementarity is a commonly invoked mechanism underlying the
   positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning,
   but little empirical evidence exists for complementarity among
   pollinator species. This study related differences in three functional
   traits of pollinating bees ( flower height preference, daily time of
   flower visitation and within-flower behaviour) to the seed set of the
   obligate cross-pollinated pumpkin Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir.
   across a land-use intensity gradient from tropical rainforest and
   agroforests to grassland in Indonesia. Bee richness and abundance
   changed with habitat variables and we used this natural variation to
   test whether complementary resource use by the diverse pollinator
   community enhanced final yield. We found that pollinator diversity, but
   not abundance, was positively related to seed set of pumpkins. Bees
   showed species-specific spatial and temporal variation in flower
   visitation traits and within-flower behaviour, allowing for
   classification into functional guilds. Diversity of functional groups
   explained even more of the variance in seed set (r(2)=45\%) than did
   species richness (r(2)=32\%) highlighting the role of functional
   complementarity. Even though we do not provide experimental, but rather
   correlative evidence, we can link spatial and temporal complementarity
   in highly diverse pollinator communities to pollination success in the
   field, leading to enhanced crop yield without any managed honeybees.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse cage trials were conducted to determine the optimal
   concentration of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota:
   Hypocreales) (BotaniGard 22WP (R) formulation) as vectored by the bumble
   bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) pollinator for
   control of greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood)
   (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) on greenhouse tomato, tarnished plant bug,
   Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois) (Hemiptera: Miridae) and green
   peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on
   greenhouse sweet pepper. Three inoculum concentrations of B. bassiana:
   low, 9 x10(9); middle, 6.24 x10(10); and high, 2 x10(11) conidia g(-1)
   of inoculum and two controls (one with bees and heat-inactivated
   inoculum, and the other which contained only the host plants and pest
   species) were tested in a completely randomized block design. Beauveria
   bassiana killed 18, 54 and 56\% of the adult T. vaporariorum and 33, 70
   and 67\% of the adult L. lineolaris, respectively, at the low, middle
   and high concentrations; but no infection from B. bassiana occurred in
   each of the control treatments. Internal infection rates after surface
   sterilization of the pest insects were 11, 34 and 35\% for adult T.
   vaporariorum, 29, 54 and 58\% for adult L. lineolaris, 22, 34 and 30\%
   for nymphal M. persicae and 17, 29 and 32\% for nymphal T. vaporariorum,
   respectively, at the low, middle and high concentrations. Significantly
   more bumble bees died at the high concentration of B. bassiana (42-45\%)
   than at the other concentrations (9-15\%) and the controls (5-7\%).
   Spores of B. bassiana were collected throughout the plant canopy with
   the greatest numbers sampled from the top third of the canopy {[}ca.
   1,200 colony forming units (CFU) per cm(-2)]. The middle concentration
   was selected as the optimal concentration because it provided the best
   pest control with the least impact on the bees.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the interspecific relationships between alien and native
   pollinator species can help forecast the success of alien species as
   well as assess the extent of disturbance to native plant-pollinator
   interactions. We examined the habitat and flower resource occupancy by
   the invasive introduced bumble bee Bombus terrestris and three dominant
   native bumble bees in central Hokkaido, northern Japan, in relation to a
   landscape factor (forest cover ratio) and flower morphology with respect
   to the proboscis length of bees. Three years of monitoring the invasive
   boundary of B. terrestris indicated that this species, which dominates
   open agricultural areas, probably will not invade the forests in which
   the native species dominate. This habitat partitioning likely followed
   the displacement of the natives by the invader in open agricultural
   lands. In forested areas, the native species partitioned flower
   resources on the basis of the relationship between proboscis length and
   the lengths of the corolla tubes of flowers. However, in open
   agricultural areas, both the long- and short-tubed flowers were
   primarily visited by the exotic short-tongued B. terrestris, which
   foraged illegitimately (by nectar robbing) on long-tubed flowers
   (Trifolium pratense L.) and legitimately on short-tubed flowers (T
   repens L. and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.). The invasion of B.
   terrestris into open natural vegetation, in addition to open
   agricultural areas, has recently been reported in Hokkaido. Even though
   the exotic and dominant native bumble bees partition their habitat
   according to landscape factors, the invasive bee has the potential to
   alter the overall interactions within plant-pollinator systems in the
   regions of open vegetation on Hokkaido island. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Marginal habitats such as hedgerows or roadsides become especially
   important for the conservation of biodiversity in highly modified
   landscapes. With concerns of a global pollination crisis, there is a
   need. for improving pollinator habitat. Roadsides restored to native
   prairie vegetation may provide valuable habitat to bees, the most
   important group of pollinators. Such roadsides support a variety of
   pollen and nectar sources and unlike agricultural fields, are unplowed,
   and therefore can provide potential nesting sites for ground-nesting
   bees. To examine potential effects of roadside restoration, bee
   communities were sampled via aerial netting and pan trapping along
   roadside prairie restorations as well as roadsides dominated by
   non-native plants. Management of roadside vegetation via the planting of
   native species profoundly affected bee communities. Restored roadsides
   supported significantly greater bee abundances as well as higher species
   richness compared to weedy roadsides. Floral species richness, floral
   abundance, and percentage of bare ground were the factors that led to
   greater bee abundance and bee species richness along restored roadsides.
   Traffic and width of roadside did not significantly influence bees,
   suggesting that even relatively narrow verges near heavy traffic could
   provide valuable habitat to bees. Restored and weedy roadside bee
   communities were similar to the prairie remnant, but the prairie remnant
   was more similar in bee richness and abundance to restored roadsides.
   Restoring additional roadsides to native vegetation could benefit
   pollinator conservation efforts by improving habitat on the millions of
   acres of land devoted to roadsides worldwide, land that is already set
   aside from further development. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1. Nosema bombi is a microsporidian parasite of bumblebees that is of
   potentially great ecological and economic importance. Nosema bombi has
   been shown to have detrimental fitness effects on the bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris under laboratory conditions. The present study investigates
   whether N. bombi also has negative fitness effects under natural
   conditions.
   2. A field experiment was conducted with B. terrestris spring queens
   caught from the wild. In the laboratory these queens were assigned to
   either infected or control treatment groups. On the emergence of
   workers, colonies were placed in the field and a number of fitness and
   life-history traits were measured.
   3. The size of colonies produced by infected queens was significantly
   smaller than those of control queens. None of the 14 infected colonies
   produced sexual offspring, whereas four of the 14 control colonies
   reached the male production stage. Results of the field experiment are
   in agreement with prior laboratory-based results, and even imply that
   such effects are amplified under natural conditions.
   4. The evidence suggests that, on entering the colony early, N. bombi
   has a highly detrimental effect on the fitness of its host. It would
   seem that this parasite reduces its opportunities to transmit into the
   next host generation.}},

Abstract = {{To trace the evolution of host-plant choice in bees of the genus
   Chelostoma (Megachilidae), we assessed the host plants of 35 Palearctic,
   North American and Indomalayan species by microscopically analyzing the
   pollen loads of 634 females and reconstructed their phylogenetic history
   based on four genes and a morphological dataset, applying both parsimony
   and Bayesian methods. All species except two were found to be strict
   pollen specialists at the level of plant family or genus. These
   oligolectic species together exploit the flowers of eight different
   plant orders that are distributed among all major angiosperm lineages.
   Based on ancestral state reconstruction, we found that oligolecty is the
   ancestral state in Chelostoma and that the two pollen generalists
   evolved from oligolectic ancestors. The distinct pattern of host
   broadening in these two polylectic species, the highly conserved floral
   specializations within the different clades, the exploitation of
   unrelated hosts with a striking floral similarity as well as a recent
   report on larval performance on nonhost pollen in two Chelostoma species
   clearly suggest that floral host choice is physiologically or
   neurologically constrained in bees of the genus Chelostoma. Based on
   this finding, we propose a new hypothesis on the evolution of host range
   in bees.}},

   their pollinators. Some 20 000 species, however, offer only pollen and
   rely on pollen-foraging bees for pollination. This creates a dilemma
   since pollen grains contain the male gametes and should be protected
   from becoming bee food. Darwin was the first to hypothesize that a
   `division-of-labour' among stamens could solve this dilemma, with some
   stamens providing pollen as food, others providing pollen for
   fertilization. This hypothesis can only be tested if pollen grains from
   the two sets of stamens can be distinguished and their fates determined
   to the point of attachment on the stigma.
   2. We tested Darwin's hypothesis in Melastoma malabathricum
   (Melastomataceae), a pollen-only flower with conspicuously
   differentiated stamens, an inner set that is short and yellow and an
   outer set that is much longer and purple with small yellow spurs. Pollen
   release is through terminal anther pores. Taking advantage of different
   exine patterns on the pollen produced by the two sets of stamens, we
   carried out a series of experimental manipulations to compare pollinator
   foraging behaviour and pollen pathways from anthers to stigmas.
   3. The results demonstrate that in spite of all 10 stamens being buzzed
   simultaneously by the carpenter bees that pollinate M. malabathricum,
   pollen from the purple `fertilization' stamens is dramatically more
   likely to land on stigmas than pollen from the yellow `feeding' stamens.
   Removal experiments showed that the yellow `feeding' stamens also
   attracted pollinators from a distance. Flowers that had their anther
   pores plugged received fewer buzzing bouts per visit, indicating that
   bees assessed the amount of pollen received per bout. Surprisingly,
   there was no significant difference in pollen loads on stigmas of
   flowers that had their anthers plugged and stigmas of controls,
   demonstrating the efficiency of vector-assisted cross-pollination and
   the lack of vector-assisted self-pollination.
   4. The unexpectedly precise placement of pollen grains even with buzz
   pollination, with a large proportion of the grains deposited out of the
   bees' grooming reach, helps explain the evolutionary persistence of
   pollen as a reward in spite of the bees' ability to assess the amount of
   pollen received during foraging bouts. Together, these results strongly
   support Darwin's division-of-labour hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebee Bombus terrestris is not only an effective pollinator, but
   also a potential invasive alien species outside its native range.
   Recently, nearly 30\% of queens of the Japanese native species Bombus
   hypocrita sapporoensis and B. hypocrita hypocrita were estimated to
   copulate with B. terrestris males in the field, suggesting that
   indigenous bumblebees could be genetically deteriorated through hybrid
   production with the introduced species. In this study, we evaluated
   hybrid production between the introduced B. terrestris and the
   indigenous B. hypocrita sapporoensis under laboratory conditions. The
   hatching rate of eggs derived from interspecific matings was 0\% and
   8.6\% depending on the direction of the cross, which was significantly
   lower than that from intraspecific matings of B. terrestris (76.9\%) and
   B. hypocrita sapporoensis (78.9\%). Genetic studies using microsatellite
   markers revealed that both haploid and diploid individuals were present
   in the egg stage, whereas all hatched larvae were haploid. In addition,
   histological studies revealed that eggs derived from interspecific
   matings terminated development 2 days after oviposition. These results
   strongly suggested that eggs derived from interspecific matings are
   inviable due to post-mating isolation mechanisms. Mass release of exotic
   pollinators could cause serious population declines of native bumblebee
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Differentiation in floral traits among clusters of related species may
   reflect a process of pollinator-driven evolution. Pollination systems in
   the morphologically diverse southern African genus Syncolostemon
   (Lamiaceae) were investigated by means of field observations of floral
   visitors and analysis of their pollen loads. Among the five study
   species, those with short corolla tubes (S. parviflorus, S. ramulosus)
   were pollinated solely by bees, while those with long corolla tubes were
   pollinated by a broader array of visitors, primarily long-proboscid
   flies in S. rotundifolius and S. macranthus and sunbirds in S.
   densiflorus. The predominately insect-pollinated taxa have lax
   inflorescences, but S. densiflorus has a compact terminal inflorescence,
   which facilitates feeding by sunbirds from a single perching position.
   Experimental hand-pollinations involving three taxa (S. macranthus, S.
   densiflorus, and S. rotundifolius) showed that these possess a genetic

Abstract = {{Community of bees (Hymenoptera. Apoidea) and plants in an area of
   Agreste in Pernambuco, Brazil. The Agreste is a transition region of
   tropical rainforest and Caatinga in northeastern Brazil. In this region,
   the majority of the native Atlantic Rainforest was destroyed to give
   place to livestock firming. It is not known whether degraded areas
   maintain a diversified bee-plant community or not and which kinds of
   bee-plant interactions occur. The vegetation at the study site comprises
   pastures, ruderal vegetation and minute remanents of rainforest
   vegetation. Both bees and associated plants were collected monthly, from
   August 2001 to July 2002, sampling during two consecutive days from 5:30
   am to 5:30 pm. We collected a total of 1004 bees from 79 species. Apidae
   was the most abundant and species-rich bee family (732 individuals, 43
   species) followed by Halictidae (194 individuals and 20 spp.),
   Megachilidae (47 individuals and 13 spp.), Colletidae (16 individuals
   and 2 spp.) and Andrenidae (15 individuals and 1 sp.). Only three
   species of eusocial bees and five of euglossine bees were recorded, even
   though both groups arc diversified in Neotropical rainforests. The
   absence of native stingless bees of the genera Plebeia, Friescomelitta,
   Partamona, Scaptotrigona and Trigoniaca. as well as of other euglossine
   bee species, is probably due to the lack of nesting sites and to the
   paucity of pollen and nectar resources in this disturbed area. The bees
   visited flowers of 87 plant species, mainly of herbs and small shrubs.
   Isolated rainforest trees in the pasture as well as cultivated fruit
   crops contributed to some extent to maintain a diversified native bee
   community.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging range, an important component of bee ecology, is of
   considerable interest for insect-pollinated plants because it determines
   the potential for outcrossing among individuals. However, long-distance
   pollen flow is difficuit to assess, especially when the plant also
   relies on self-pollination. Pollen movement can be estimated indirectly
   through population genetic data, but complementary data on pollinator
   flight distances is necessary to validate such estimates. By using
   radio-tracking of cowpea pollinator return flights, we found that
   carpenter bees visiting cowpea flowers can forage up to 6 km from their
   nest. Foraging distances were found to be shorter than the maximum
   flight range, especially under adverse weather conditions or poor reward
   levels. From complete flight records in which bees visited wild and
   domesticated populations, we conclude that bees can mediate gene flow
   and, in some instances, allow transgene (genetically engineered
   material) escape over several kilometers. However, most between-flower
   flights occur within plant patches, while very few occur between plant
   patches.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of the genetic compatibility between self-incompatible
   cultivars is crucial in agriculture. The Rosaceae family carries the
   S-RNase-mediated gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) system. Each
   haplotype is conferred by an S-locus. The S-locus contains two highly
   polymorphic genes, S-RNase and SFB, which are characteristic of each
   haplotype and therefore these genes are ideal markers for molecular
   S-genotyping. In this study 43 Japanese plum cultivars grown in Israel
   were S-genotyped based on their S-RNase gene sequences. Four alleles,
   S-b, S-c, S-e and S-h are widespread and together are responsible for
   87\% of the S-haplotypes therefore many of the cultivar combinations are
   semi-compatible. In Israel semi-compatibility was shown to correlate
   with low yield. However, two cultivars, `Wickson' (SSk)-S-f and `Shiro'
   (SSg)-S-f carry rare S-haplotypes and, therefore, are fully compatible
   with most of the analyzed cultivars. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Vigna caracalla has the most complex flower among
   asymmetrical Papilionoideae. The objective of this study was to
   understand the relationships among floral characteristics,
   specialization, mating system and the role of floral visitors under
   different ecological contexts.
   Methods Five populations were studied in north-western Argentina, from
   700 to 1570 m a.s.l. Anthesis, colour and odour patterns, stigmatic
   receptivity, visitors and pollination mechanism were examined and
   mating-system experiments were performed.
   Key Results The petals are highly modified and the keel shows 3.75-5.25
   revolutions. The sense of asymmetry was always left-handed. Hand-crosses
   showed that V. caracalla is self-compatible, but depends on pollinators
   to set seeds. Hand-crossed fruits were more successful than hand-selfed
   ones, with the exception of the site at the highest elevation. Bombus
   morio (queens and workers), Centris bicolor, Eufriesea mariana and
   Xylocopa eximia trigger the pollination mechanism (a `brush type'). The
   greatest level of self-compatibility and autonomous self-pollination
   were found at the highest elevation, together with the lowest

   Conclusions Self-fertilization may have evolved in the peripheral
   population at the highest site of V. caracalla because of the benefits
   of reproductive assurance under reduced pollinator diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Anther appendages play diverse roles in anther
   dehiscence and pollen dispersal. This study aims to explore the
   pollen-dispensing mechanism triggered by special anther appendages in
   Incarvillea arguta.
   Methods Field studies were conducted to record floral characteristics,
   pollinator visitations, and flower-pollinator interactions. Measurements
   of flowers and pollinators were analysed statistically. Pollen counts
   following a series of floral manipulations were used to evaluate pollen
   dispensing efficiency and function of the anther appendages.
   Key Results Field observations determined that two species of Bombus
   (bumble-bees) were the primary pollinators of I. arguta with a mean
   visiting frequency of 1.42 visitations per flower h(-1). The results
   display a diminishing pollen dispensing pattern; the proportion of
   remaining pollen removed by pollinators decreased from 27 \% to 10 \%
   and 7 \% in subsequent visits. Anther appendages act as a trigger
   mechanism to dispense pollen. The arrangement of the anthers and
   appendages function to control pollen load and timing. Mechanical
   stimulation experiments revealed that one set of appendages is only
   triggered by stimulation in the direction moving into the flower, while
   the other set is only triggered by stimulation in the opposite direction
   (exiting the flower).
   Conclusions The anther appendage is a pollen-dispensing trigger
   mechanism. The configuration of the stamens and duel trigger system has
   evolved to allocate pollen in allotments to enhance male function.}},

Abstract = {{Animals collecting resources that are fixed in space but replenish over
   time, such as floral nectar and pollen, often establish small foraging
   areas to which they return faithfully. Some repeatedly visit a set of
   patches in a significantly predictable sequence (so-called ``trapline
   foraging{''}), which may allow them to focus on more profitable patches
   in their foraging areas. The functional significance of trapline
   foraging itself, however, has not been empirically demonstrated,
   especially in competitive situations. We conducted laboratory
   experiments with artificial flowers to test whether and how accumulated
   foraging experience in bumble bees affects their movement patterns and
   foraging performance in the presence of competition. Experienced bees
   with prior access to flowers achieved higher rates of nectar intake than
   did later arrivals because they traveled faster between flowers and
   returned to flowers at more regular intervals. These behavioral skills
   improved foraging performance in competitive situations in 2 ways:
   nectar that accumulated in flowers could be harvested before its
   replenishment rate slowed down, and nectar could be taken before the
   arrival of a competitor. In each foraging trip, however, bees traveled
   more slowly as they followed more repeatable routes. Despite this
   trade-off between speed and accuracy in traplining, bees constantly
   upgraded both skills as they gained experience from trip to trip. This
   upgrading still occurred in the absence of a competitor. Foraging area
   fidelity thus allowed bumble bees to establish long-term spatial memory
   required for fast movements and accurate traplining and, in turn,
   increased their foraging performance in competition with less
   experienced individuals.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The potential value of biofungicides for the control of important plant
   pathogens, such as the gray mold Botrytis cinerea, requires
   investigation due to the general requirement for very low pesticide
   residues in foodstuffs, and concerns over the increasing development of
   resistance to the different classes of chemical fungicides. Furthermore,
   the use of bumblebees as pollinators in agriculture and horticulture has
   become more widespread in recent years, which has generated the need to
   determine the potential risks of biological control agents against these
   insects. This study investigated the side-effects of two commercial
   Trichoderma-based biofungicides against the bumblebee Bombus terrestris.
   The two commercial compounds tested were Binab-TF-WP and
   Binab-TF-WP-Konc, both of which contain combinations of Trichoderma
   harzianum ATCC20476 and Dichoderma polysporum ATCC20475. The bumblebees
   were exposed to the biocontrol agents under laboratory conditions at
   their respective maximum concentration in the field (MFRC), and then
   exposed via three potential routes of exposure: dermal contact, orally
   via the drinking of treated sugar water, and via treated pollen. The
   treatments were evaluated through recording worker mortality (lethal
   effects) and any effects on the production of drones (sublethal
   effects). The laboratory tests demonstrated that the two Binab products
   did not cause worker mortality or adversely affect reproduction. In
   addition, we investigated whether the Trichoderma-based products could
   survive or grow on the bodies of the adult workers. In no case was
   survival or growth of the biofungicide observed on the workers. When the
   effects of these compounds were evaluated against bumblebee larvae
   (third and fourth instars), no entomopathogenic effects were found.
   Overall, the results obtained under laboratory conditions indicate that
   the two Binab products are safe for use in combination with B.
   terrestris. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse cage trials were conducted to assess the effectiveness of
   bumble bee pollinators for the co-vectoring of two fungi (Beauveria
   bassiana {[}Balsamo] Vuillemin {[}BotaniGard 22WP (R) formulation] and
   Clonostachys rosea Lnk: Fr. {[}Endofine (R)), in greenhouse tomato and
   sweet pepper for control of insect pests (greenhouse whitefly,
   Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood; and tarnished plant bug, Lygus
   lineolaris {[}Palisot de Beauvois]), and grey mould (Botrytis cinerea
   Pets: Fr.). Three treatments were evaluated: 6.24 x 10(10) coniclia of
   B. bassiana + 1.38 x 10(7) Conidia of C. rosea/g of inoculum vectored by
   bees (active inoculum); heat-in activated inoculum vectored by bees; and
   a control with no inoculum and no bees. In each crop, the treatments
   were arranged in a completely randomized block design with four
   replications. When applied in the tomato crop, the active inoculum
   killed 49\% of the T vaporariorum and suppressed grey mould by 57\% and
   46\%, respectively, on the flowers and leaves. In sweet pepper,
   mortality of L. lineolaris was 73\% and grey mould was suppressed by
   59\% and 47\%, respectively, on the flowers and leaves in the active
   inoculum treatment. The incidence of grey mould in sweet pepper and
   tomatoes treated with the heat-inactivated inoculum or no inoculum
   (control) was approximately 80\% on the flowers and leaves. Thus, the
   combined inoculum of B. bassiana and C. rosea can potentially control T.
   vaporaniorum and L. lineolaris, and suppress grey mould in greenhouse
   tomatoes and sweet peppers, when vectored simultaneously by bumble bees.
   Commercial greenhouse trials need to be conducted next to determine
   control efficacy under large scale production conditions. Crown

Abstract = {{The ecology of nectarivorous microbial communities remains virtually
   unknown, which precludes elucidating whether these organisms play some
   role in plant pollinator mutualisms beyond minor commensalism. We
   simultaneously assessed microbial abundance and nectar composition at
   the individual nectary level in. flowers of three southern Spanish
   bumble bee-pollinated plants (Helleborus foetidus, Aquilegia vulgaris,
   and Aquilegia pyrenaica cazorlensis). Yeasts were frequent and abundant
   in nectar of all species, and variation in yeast density was correlated
   with drastic changes in nectar sugar concentration and composition.
   Yeast communities built up in nectar from early to late. oral stages, at
   which time all nectaries contained yeasts, often at densities between
   10(4) and 10(5) cells/mm(3). Total sugar concentration and percentage
   sucrose declined, and percentage fructose increased, with increasing
   density of yeast cells in nectar. Among-nectary variation in microbial
   density accounted for 65\% (H. foetidus and A. vulgaris) and 35\% (A. p.
   cazorlensis) of intraspecific variance in nectar sugar composition, and
   60\% (H. foetidus) and 38\% (A. vulgaris) of variance in nectar
   concentration. Our results provide compelling evidence that nectar
   microbial communities can have detrimental effects on plants and/or
   pollinators via extensive nectar degradation and also call for a more
   careful interpretation of nectar traits in the future, if uncontrolled
   for yeasts.}},

Abstract = {{Although predators can affect foraging behaviors of oral visitors,
   rarely is it known if these top-down effects of predators may cascade to
   plant fitness through trait-mediated interactions. In this study we
   manipulated artificial crab spiders on flowers of Rubus rosifolius to
   test the effects of predation risk on flower-visiting insects and
   strength of trait-mediated indirect effects to plant fitness. In
   addition, we tested which predator traits (e. g., forelimbs, abdomen)
   are recognized and avoided by pollinators. Total visitation rate was
   higher for control flowers than for flowers with an artificial crab
   spider. In addition, flowers with a sphere (simulating a spider abdomen)
   were more frequently visited than those with forelimbs or the entire
   spider model. Furthermore, the presence of artificial spiders decreased
   individual seed set by 42\% and fruit biomass by 50\%. Our findings
   indicate that pollinators, mostly bees, recognize and avoid flowers with
   predation risk; forelimbs seem to be the predator trait recognized and
   avoided by hymenopterans. Additionally, predator avoidance by
   pollinators resulted in pollen limitation, thereby affecting some
   components of plant fitness (fruit biomass and seed number). Because
   most pollinator species that recognized predation risk visited many
   other plant species, trait-mediated indirect effects of spiders
   cascading down to plant fitness may be a common phenomenon in the
   Atlantic rainforest ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Both the number and the density of flowering plants in a population can
   be important determinants of pollinator abundance and behavior. We
   report the joint effects of population size and density on pollinator
   visitation and pollination success for Lupinus perennis (Fabaceae).
   Focusing on five pairs of populations, we matched one small population
   (125-800 flowering plants) with one distinctly larger population
   (1000-3000 flowering plants). In these pairs, population size did not
   affect pollinator communities or pollination success. All measures of
   pollination success increased significantly with density. Only bee
   behavior (number of flowers probed per inflorescence) exhibited a
   significant interaction of size and density. Testing whether population
   sizes smaller than those in the paired populations might affect
   pollination, we gathered pollen tube samples from 14 unpaired
   populations (16-215 flowering plants). Combining these data with those
   from the paired populations revealed a significant decrease in
   pollination for smaller populations, indicating that effects of
   population size may be detectable only when populations smaller than a
   few hundred plants are sampled. We found that effects of density are
   consistent and much stronger than those of population size. Our results
   suggest that both size and density of natural populations should be
   considered in designing restoration and reintroduction programs for this
   threatened plant.}},

Title = {{Generalist foraging of pollinators: diet expansion at high density}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1002-1010}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant-pollinator interactions are crucial for the reproduction of
   most angiosperms. When faced with perturbations, plant-pollinator
   networks might be robust mainly due to the presence of highly generalist
   species. Perturbations can, in turn, affect how pollinators exploit
   their food sources and therefore their degree of generalization.
   2. In particular, generalization of pollinators might vary with forager
   density. At high densities floral resources available in plant
   communities would be more rapidly depleted than at low densities.
   According to optimal foraging theory (OFT), this decrease in resources
   should lead to an increase in diet breadth.
   3. We investigated the impact of pollinator density on diet breadth of
   Bombus terrestris. We recorded the individual foraging behaviour of
   bumblebees from eight colonies. They foraged in presence of either one
   or several conspecifics on experimental plant communities composed of
   five plant species. Diet breadth was calculated as the number of plant
   species visited, as well as by the Levins index. We analyzed the effect
   of forager density on diet breadth at both the individual and the colony
   levels.
   4. We found that forager density affected degree of generalization at
   individual and colony levels. A more competitive environment increased
   individual generalization, as predicted by OFT, and decreased the
   variability in generalization across colonies. Moreover, we found that
   bumblebee size was positively related to the amplitude of diet breadth
   change.
   5. Synthesis. Our study sheds light on an additional level of complexity
   of plant-pollinator systems, showing that pollinator diet breadth is a
   flexible trait which results from behavioural adaptation to resource
   availability. More generally, changes in foraging insects' diet via
   competition for resources are likely to ensue from anthropogenic
   ecosystem disturbance and to impact upon the functioning of
   plant-pollinator networks.}},

Abstract = {{Many plant species reward their pollinators, whereas some species,
   particularly among orchids, do not. Similarity of floral cues between
   co-flowering species influences how rapidly pollinators learn to avoid
   deceptive plants. This learning process, which affects the reproductive
   success of deceptive plants, may additionally depend on relative timing
   of flowering of sympatric rewarding and deceptive species. We tested the
   combined effects of corolla colour similarity and flowering order of
   rewarding and deceptive artificial inflorescences on visitation by naive
   bumblebees. When deceptive inflorescences were offered after rewarding
   inflorescences, bumblebees visited them four times more often if both
   species were similar compared with when they were dissimilar. Pollinator
   visitation rate to deceptive inflorescences offered before rewarding
   inflorescences was intermediate and independent of similarity. Thus,
   early-flowering deceptive species avoid the costs of dissimilarity with
   rewarding species. This mechanism may favour adaptive evolution of
   flowering phenology in deceptive species and explain why temperate
   deceptive orchids usually flower earlier than rewarding ones.}},

Abstract = {{Although the floral traits of Parkia conform to the bat-pollination
   syndrome, many visitors other than bats have been observed at their
   flowers. Some chiropterophilous plants are also pollinated by other
   animals; the syndrome is therefore best regarded as a hypothesis for
   which field observations and pollination experiments are required. The
   present study aimed. for the first time, to determine the breeding
   system of the economically important canopy trees. Parkia speciosa and
   P. timoriana, and to identify their pollinators. Pollination experiments
   carried out in Trang and Songkhla Provinces. in 28 trees of P. speciosa
   and four P. timoriana indicated that they are self incompatible. Open
   pollination resulted in the highest fruit set (average 60-67\% of
   inflorescences per tree) although this was not significantly different
   from hand-crossed pollination (48-60\%). Insect pollination resulted in
   fruit set in only 12\% of P. speciosa inflorescences. Fruit bats, mainly
   Eonycteris spelaea, visit flowering plants continuously from dusk till
   after midnight. Nocturnal and diurnal insects (moths and stingless bees
   respectively) visit capitula, mostly at the nectar zone. Nectarivorous
   bats are the most effective pollinator for P. speciosa and P. timoriana.
   The fact that populations of E. spelaea appear to be declining
   throughout their distribution is therefore a matter of increasing
   concern.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have found that flowers that are warmer than their
   surrounding environment have an advantage in attracting pollinators.
   Bumblebees will forage preferentially on warmer flowers, even if equal
   nutritional reward is available in cooler flowers. This raises the
   question of whether warmth and sucrose concentration are processed
   independently by bees, or whether sweetness detectors respond to higher
   sugar concentration as well as higher temperature. We find that
   bumblebees can use lower temperature as a cue to higher sucrose reward,
   showing that bees appear to process the two parameters strictly
   independently. Moreover, we demonstrate that sucrose concentration takes
   precedence over warmth, so that when there is a difference in sucrose
   concentration, bees will typically choose the sweeter feeder, even if
   the less sweet feeder is several degrees warmer.}},

   present study, we investigated the effectiveness of the stingless bees
   Scaptotrigona aff. depilis Moure and Nannotrigona testaceicornis
   Lepeletier as pollinators of cucumber plants (Cucumus sativus var.
   caipira) in greenhouses during the Brazilian winter season. The study
   was conducted in four greenhouses (GH), of which two greenhouses
   contained bee colonies to ascertain pollination of the cucumber plants
   (GH I, with S. aff. depilis, GH II, with N. testaceicornis), whereas the
   other two greenhouses (GH III, GH IV) had no bee colonies and served as
   control groups. Furthermore, we planted cucumbers in an open field plot
   (OA) where pollination by any/various visiting insects could occur. Each
   of the experimental areas measured 87.5 m(2). Without pollination (GH
   III, GH IV), the plants produced a low number of cucumbers, and the
   fruits were smaller and less heavy than in those experimental areas
   where pollination occurred. In the open field area, not protected
   against unfavorable climatic conditions, the plants produced fewer
   flowers than the plants in the greenhouses. The highest cucumber yield
   (with the highest amount of perfect fruits) was found in those
   greenhouses which housed the stingless bees as pollinators (GH I, GH
   II). Our results demonstrate that stingless bees can be successfully and
   efficiently used as pollinators of greenhouse cucumbers during the

Abstract = {{Considerable overlap exists in the plant,genera present in New Zealand
   and Australian alpine areas. There is also significant overlap, at the
   level of family and even genus, of pollinating insects present. This
   study uses two published surveys, Primack (1983) for New Zealand and
   Inouye \& Pyke (1988) for Australia, to test whether the same taxa of
   plants and pollinators are associated in the two countries. Sixteen
   plant genera, 12 insect families, and seven insect genera were common to
   both studies. There was no tendency for insects in families common to
   both Australia and New Zealand to preferentially visit plant genera in
   common to both countries. However, for the seven insect taxa that did
   visit at least one matching plant genus in both studies, the fly family.
   Tachinidae, and the native bee genus, Lasioglossum, showed significantly
   more matches than expected from random association.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{643-649}},

Abstract = {{Clonal growth, which allows the multiplication of flowering shoots of
   the same genet, can lead to a large floral display and may thus increase
   the rate of selfing through geitonogamy as a consequence of an increase
   in the number of successively visited flowers. The aim of the present
   research was to analyse the combined effect of the diversity and
   intermingling of clones on the rate of selfing in Vaccinium myrtillus.
   Four mother plants were selected within patches characterised by
   contrasting clonal structure (low versus high number and intermingling
   of clones). The selfing rate was significantly lower for plants situated
   within patches characterised by a high number of intermingled clones
   (3\%) than for plants situated in patches with a low number of clones
   (50\%). Therefore, for this species suffering from inbreeding
   depression, an increase in the number or the intermingling of the clones
   could reduce the rate and the cost of geitonogamy and allow a large
   floral display to attract pollinators. We also found that the main
   pollinators, bumblebee queens, presented a foraging behaviour favouring
   geitonogamy, as their successive visits to flowers were quite short
   (89\% of flights were 40 cm or less).}},

Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The genus Cyrtopodium comprises about 42 species distributed from
   southern Florida to northern Argentina. Cyrtopodium polyphyllum occurs
   on rocks or in sandy soils, in restinga vegetation along the Brazilian
   coast. It flowers during the wet season and its inflorescences produce a
   high number of resupinate yellow flowers. Cyrtopodium polyphyllum offers
   no rewards to its pollinators, but mimics the yellow, reward-producing
   flowers of nearby growing Stigmaphyllon arenicola (oil) and Crotalaria
   vitellina (nectar) individuals. Several species of bee visit flowers of
   C. polyphyllum, but only two species of Centris (Centris tarsata and
   Centris labrosa) act as pollinators. Visits to flowers of C. polyphyllum
   were scarce and, as a consequence, low-fruit set was recorded under
   natural conditions. Such low-fruit production contrasts with the number
   of fruits each plant bears after manual pollination, suggesting
   deficient pollen transfer among plants. C. polyphyllum is
   self-compatible and has a high-fruit set in both manual self- and
   cross-pollinated flowers. Furthermore, fruits (2\%) are formed by
   self-pollination assisted by rain. This facultative self-pollination
   mechanism is an important strategy to provide reproductive assurance to
   C. polyphyllum as rainfall restricts the foraging activity of its
   pollinating bees. Fruits derived from treatments and under natural
   conditions had a similar high rate of potentially viable seed. Moreover,
   these seeds had a low polyembryony rate, which did not exceed 5\%. C.
   polyphyllum acts by deceit involving optical signals and exploits other
   yellow-flowered species within its habitat by attracting their
   pollinators. The low capsule production under natural conditions was
   expected, but its reproductive success is assured through
   self-pollination by rain and high seed viability.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic and fitness consequences of habitat fragmentation on the dry
   grassland species Anthericum liliago L. (Anthericaceae) were examined.
   We used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to determine the
   distribution of genetic diversity within and among 10 German A. liliago
   populations, ranging in size from 116 to over 2 million ramets. The
   genetic diversity of an A. liliago population was highly positively
   correlated with its population size. The overall differentiation among
   populations (Phi-ST = 0.41, P < 0.0001, AMOVA) was considerably higher
   than expected for a species with a mixed breeding system. No strong
   correlation (P < 0.01) was detected between fitness parameters and
   population size and genetic diversity. The reproductive output (seeds
   per ramet) was only highly correlated (P < 0.001) with the proportion of
   flowering ramets in a population which could be caused by a more
   effective pollination in large populations which are more attractive to
   specialized pollinators. The specialized A. liliago pollinator Merodon
   rufus (Syrphidae) and high abundances of solitary bees could only be
   found in A. liliago populations with more than 10,000 individuals.
   Genetic differentiation among the investigated A. liliago populations
   may have been caused by limited seed and pollen dispersal and a mixed
   mating system permitting a high selfing rate. The differentiation among
   the small and isolated populations lacking main pollinators seems to be
   caused by genetic drift.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination requirements of eggplant (Solanum melongena) were
   investigated. One variety of eggplant exhibited a significantly reduced
   seed set in absence of pollinators, and two varieties significantly
   increased seed numbers when pollen deposition was enhanced. Two solitary
   bee species, Xylocopa caffra and Macronomia rufipes, were identified as
   effective pollinators of the crop. The visitation rates of these
   pollinators to eggplant flowers declined significantly with distance
   from the wild habitat. The importance of wild plants as alternative
   forage source for pollinators was assessed by a survey of the flowering
   plants in different habitats surrounding eggplant fields. While ruderal
   farm weeds provide much of these resources, the Acacia tortilis riverine
   forest experienced high visitation rates in one critical period of the
   dry season. The spatio-temporal foraging behaviour of eggplant
   pollinators highlights the role of the agricultural matrix in conserving
   ecosystem services. Interspersion of wild habitats with cultivated land
   promoted increased pollination services. (C) 2008 Food and Agriculture

Abstract = {{The amount and genetic composition of pollen grains that are transported
   to flowers influence the reproduction and fitness of plants. Despite the
   importance of insect-pollination systems. an understanding of those
   systems is still lacking due to the absence of a genetic analysis of
   pollen grains that are transported to flowers. We evaluated the
   pollination efficiencies of bumblebees (Apidae, Bombus spp.), flower
   beetles (Scarabaeidae, subfamily Cetoniinae, Protaetia and Eucetonia
   sp.), and small beetles (Lagriidae, Arthromacra sp.) that visited the
   flowers of Magnolia obovata (Magnoliaceae) using quantitative (flower
   visitation frequency, amount of adherent pollen per insect) and
   qualitative (origin and genetic diversity of adherent pollen per insect)
   criteria. Most of the pollen adhering to bumblebees and small beetles
   was self-pollen. This result suggests that visitation by these insects
   may cause geitonogamous pollen flow and negatively affect the
   reproduction of M. obovota, causing inbreeding depression. In contrast,
   flower beetles transported large amounts of genetically diverse outcross
   pollen. Our results suggest that certain beetle species contribute
   quantitatively and qualitatively to the pollination of M. obovata.
   Direct genetic analysis of pollen grains will advance our understanding
   of plant mating systems and may shed light on the mutualism and
   coevolution of plants and flower visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Flower morphology and pollinator dynamics play an important role in the
   evolution and maintenance of marly breeding systems, including
   andromonoecy. We used a series of field experiments to test the
   functional relationship between flower morphology and pollination
   dynamics (e.g., pollen receipt and export) in Solanum carolinense. We
   find that long-styled flowers serve primarily as pollen recipients and
   short-styled flowers as pollen donors, making this the first study to
   Support the male-female interference hypothesis for the evolution of
   andromonoecy. However. this difference in the primary male or female
   function of the flowers depends on the pollinator identity. In flowers
   visited by Bombus impatiens, style length has a positive relationship
   with pollen deposition and a negative relationship with pollen removal.
   In contrast, neither morphological nor behavioral traits determine
   pollen deposition or removal by small halictid bees. We demonstrate that
   different pollinators could select for different floral morphologies,
   and thus, Our research suggests that pollinator-specific interactions
   with flower morphology play an important role in the evolution and
   maintenance of andromonoecy.}},

Abstract = {{Melipona quadrifasciata and Melipona rufiventris are stingless bee
   species which present low and high heterochromatin content,
   respectively, on their mitotic chromosomes as assessed visually after a
   C-banding assay. However, these species do not show differences in the
   C-banding responses of their Malpighian tubule interphase nuclei. In the
   present study, the Feulgen-DNA response, which could inform on
   differences in DNA depurination due to differences in chromatin
   condensation, was compared in the cell nuclei of the Malpighian tubules
   of these species. It was hypothesized that differences in acid
   hydrolysis kinetics patterns, as assessed by Feulgen reaction and
   studied microspectrophotometrically, could discriminate M.
   quadrifasciata and M. rufiventris interphase nuclei not distinguishable
   with the C-banding method. Feulgen-DNA values corresponding to more than
   one ploidy class were found in both species; these values at the
   hydrolysis time corresponding to the maximal DNA depurination for each
   ploidy degree were higher in M. quadrifasciata, reflecting a higher DNA
   content in the Malpighian tubule cell nuclei of this species compared to
   those of M. rufiventris at the same larval instar. The maximal
   Feulgen-DNA values of M. quadrifasciata after short (50 min) and long
   (90 min) hydrolysis times were found to be closer to each other, while
   those of M. rufiventris occurred sharply at the long hydrolysis time,
   indicating that DNA depurination in M. quadrifasciata occurred faster.
   This result is probably related to the involvement of differences in
   chromatin condensation; it agrees with the idea that M. rufiventris
   contains more heterochromatin than M. quadrifasciata, which is supported
   by the analysis of results obtained with the image analysis parameter
   average absorption ratio. The depurination kinetics studied here with
   the Feulgen reaction were revealed to be more pertinent than the
   C-banding technique in establishing differences in levels of chromatin
   condensation for these cell nuclei. (c) 2008 International Federation

Abstract = {{One of the most pressing issues surrounding transgenic oilseed rape
   cultivation is the potential impact of GM genes entering neighboring
   non-GM oilseed rape plants, related weeds or closely related wild
   relatives. Following the principle of a case-by-case for transgenic crop
   safety assessment, we designed experiments to study pollen-mediated gene
   flow from herbicide-resistant transgenic oilseed rape to Chinese
   commercial varieties. The pollen dispersal was detected as the progeny
   of recipient plants that were identified as glufosinate resistant. The
   results indicated that pollen dispersal occurred up to 2000 m and its
   rate sharply decreased as the distance from the pollen source increased.
   However, the rate of long-distance pollen dispersal from 33 to 2000 m
   was less than 0.015\% and did not present a gradual decrease, indicating
   the randomization of dispersal and pollination. Most pollen dispersed
   within a 4.5 m area around the transgenic pollen source plot, with a
   maximum of 1.19\% at the sampling site of 1.4 m. Wind direction
   significantly affected the direction and the distance of pollen
   dispersal, resulting in the more and farther dispersal in southwest
   direction. However, the number of potentially pollinating bees was not
   correlated with direction and distance from the pollen source plot,
   suggesting that bee density and distribution would not contribute to the
   differences in pollen dispersal among different directions. This paper
   is the first report on research in a large-scale experiment of
   pollen-mediated gene flow under the China's environmental conditions and
   provided scientific evidence for the effective commercialization of
   transgenic oilseed rape and its safe management. Our results also
   provided important data on pollen spatial distribution pattern.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major mechanisms of plant diversification has been the
   evolution of polyploid populations that differ from their diploid
   progenitors in morphology, physiology, and environmental tolerances.
   Recent studies have indicated that polyploidy may also have major
   effects on ecological interactions with herbivores and pollinators. We
   evaluated pollination of sympatric diploid and tetraploid plants of the
   rhizomatous herb Heuchera grossulariifolia (Saxifragaceae) along the
   Selway and Salmon Rivers of northern Idaho, USA, during four consecutive
   years. Previous molecular and ecological analyses had indicated that the
   tetraploid populations along these two river systems are independently
   derived and differ from each other in multiple traits. In each region,
   we evaluated. oral visitation rate by all insect visitors, pollination
   efficacy of all major visitors, and relative contribution of all major
   pollinators to seed set. In both regions, diploid and tetraploid plants
   attracted different suites of floral visitors. Most pollination was
   attributable to several bee species and the moth Greya politella.
   Lasioglossum bees preferentially visited diploid plants at Lower Salmon
   but not at Upper Selway, queen Bombus centralis preferentially visited
   tetraploids at both sites, and worker B. centralis differed between
   sites in their cytotype preference. Hence, diploid and autotetraploid H.
   grossulariifolia plants act essentially as separate ecological species
   and may experience partial reproductive isolation through differential
   visitation and pollination by their major. oral visitors. Overall the
   results, together with recent results from other studies, suggest that
   the repeated evolution of polyploidy in plants may contribute
   importantly to the structure and diversification of ecological
   interactions in terrestrial communities.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen movement within and among plants affects inbreeding, plant
   fitness, and the spatial scale of genetic differentiation. Although a
   number of studies have assessed how plant and. oral traits in fluence
   pollen movement via changes in pollinator behavior, few have explored
   how nectar chemical composition affects pollen transfer. As many as 55\%
   of plants produce secondary compounds in their nectar, which is
   surprising given that nectar is typically thought to attract
   pollinators. We tested the hypothesis that nectar with secondary
   compounds may benefit plants by encouraging pollinators to leave plants
   after visiting only a few flowers, thus reducing self-pollen transfer.
   We used Gelsemium sempervirens, a plant whose nectar contains the
   alkaloid gelsemine, which has been shown to be a deterrent to foraging
   bee pollinators. We found that high nectar alkaloids reduced the total
   and proportion of self-pollen received by one-half and one-third,
   respectively. However, nectar alkaloids did not affect female
   reproduction when we removed the potential for self-pollination (by
   emasculating all flowers on plants). We then tested the assumption that
   self-pollen in combination with outcrossed pollen depresses seed set. We
   found that plants were weakly self-compatible, but self-pollen with
   outcrossed pollen did not reduce seed set relative to solely outcrossed
   flowers. Finally, an exponential model of pollen carryover suggests that
   high nectar alkaloids could benefit plants via increased pollen export
   (an estimate of male function), but only when pollinators were efficient
   and abundant and plants had large. oral displays. Results suggest that
   high nectar alkaloids may benefit plants via increased pollen export
   under a restricted set of ecological conditions, but in general, the
   costs of high nectar alkaloids in reducing pollination balanced or
   outweighed the benefits of reducing self-pollen transfer for estimates
   of female and male reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{1. Although it is well established that different plant species vary
   considerably in the quality of pollinator rewards they offer, it is
   unclear how plant reproductive systems, in particular an obligate
   dependence on insects for pollination, might influence the evolution of
   pollinator rewards. Moreover, unlike the interaction between nectar
   reward and pollinator visitation, we have a limited understanding of the
   way in which pollen quality influences pollinator foraging behaviour.
   2. We quantified the pollen protein and amino acid content for 23 NW
   European plant species. Pollen quality was compared with breeding system
   (facultative- vs. obligate insect-pollinated). A subset of 18 plants was
   sampled from a single habitat. For these we compared the proportion of
   pollen collection visits made by bumblebees with the quality of pollen
   offered.
   3. We found a significant association between pollen quality and
   reproductive system; pollen of obligate insect-pollinated species
   contained higher protein content. We also found a significant
   relationship with pollinator use; plants most frequently visited by
   pollen-collecting bumblebees produced the highest-quality pollen.
   4. We discuss how the close relationship between pollen quality and
   bumblebee attraction may have important benefits for plant reproductive
   success. However, we also show how the disruption of this mutualism can
   have detrimental consequences for plant and pollinator alike.}},

   the larvae. Here, we evaluate the toxicity Of four fungicides, Benlate,
   Captan, Orbit, and Rovral, to adult bees by using three different
   bioassays. In the first test, fungicides were applied to bees' thoraces,
   fit the second test, mimicking foliage residue, a piece of filter paper
   soaked in fungicide was placed on the bottom of a container of bees. The
   third test evaluated oral toxicity by incorporating fungicides into a
   sugar,water solution that was fed to the bees. The filter paper test did
   not discriminate among the fungicides well, and the oral test resulted
   in the greatest mortality. Toxicity to males was greater than to
   females. The use of fungicides for chalkbrood control is a logical
   choice, but caution should be used in how they are applied in the
   presence of bees.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination syndrome hypothesis has provided a major conceptual
   framework for how plants and pollinators interact. However, the
   assumption of specialization in pollination systems and the reliability
   of floral traits in predicting the main pollinators have been questioned
   recently. In addition, the relationship between ecological and
   evolutionary specialization in pollination interactions is still poorly
   understood. We used data of 62 plant species from three communities
   across southern Norway to test: (1) the relationships between floral
   traits and the identity of pollinators, (2) the association between
   floral traits (evolutionary specialization) and ecological
   generalization, and (3) the consistency of both relationships across
   communities. Floral traits significantly affected the identity of
   pollinators in the three communities in a way consistent with the
   predictions derived from the pollination syndrome concept. However,
   hover flies and butterflies visited flowers with different shapes in
   different communities, which we mainly attribute to among-community
   variation in pollinator assemblages. Interestingly, ecological
   generalization depended more on the community-context (i.e. the plant
   and pollinator assemblages in the communities) than on specific floral
   traits. While open yellow and white flowers were the most generalist in
   two communities, they were the most specialist in the alpine community.
   Our results warn against the use of single measures of ecological
   generalization to question the pollination syndrome concept, and
   highlight the importance of community comparisons to assess the
   pollination syndromes, and to understand the relationships between
   ecological and evolutionary specialization in plant-pollinator
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In the conservation and management practices of natural forests, sound
   reproduction and regeneration form the basis of the maintenance and
   viability of the tree populations. To obtain and serve biological
   information for sustainable forest management, we investigated
   reproductive biology and inbreeding depression in seeds of an important
   dipterocarp tree species, Shorea acuminata (Dipterocarpaceae), by both
   field and laboratory experiments. Results of parental analysis of
   immature and mature seeds showed that selfing rates varied greatly, from
   7.6 to 88.4\% among eight mother trees, and the mean overall selfing
   rate was 38.3\%. Observed outcrossing events within a 40-ha study plot
   were predominantly (76.5\%) short-distance events with a mating distance
   (md) : 100 m. Since the selfing rate sharply decreased with increase in
   the number of flowering conspecifics (i.e., individuals of the same
   species) within a 100-m radius from the mother trees, the local density
   of flowering conspecifics appears to be the key factor determining the
   outcrossing rate in S. acuminata. However, the extremely high selfing
   rate (88.4\%) observed for one tree could not be simply explained by the
   low local density of flowering conspecifics. Instead, differences in its
   flowering phenology (its flowering peaked ca. a week earlier than most
   of the other examined individuals) may have severely limited its receipt
   of pollen from other conspecifics, and thus promoted selfing. Since
   there were no significant differences in the proportion of selfed
   progeny between immature and mature seed stages, there was no evidence
   of selective abortion of selfed seeds during seed development. However,
   the seed mass of outcrossed progeny was heavier than that of selfed
   progeny, and heavier seeds showed higher success rates at germination
   and seedling establishment. These results suggest that inbreeding
   depression resulted in reductions in seed mass and may reduce the
   fitness of selfed seeds in S. acuminata. In addition, the outcrossing
   rate of S. acuminata was more sensitive to low local conspecific
   flowering-tree densities than that of a sympatric bee-pollinated
   dipterocarp, species with greater pollination distances. These results
   suggest that the management of local adult-tree densities is important
   for avoiding selfing and inbreeding depression in future generations,
   especially in a species like S. acuminata with predominantly
   short-distance pollination. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Social transmission of acquired foraging techniques is rarely considered
   outside of a vertebrate context. Here, however, we show that nectar
   robbing by bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)-an invertebrate behaviour of
   considerable ecological significance-has the potential to spread through
   a population at the accelerated rates typical of social transmission.
   Nectar robbing occurs when individuals either bite through the base of a
   flower to `steal' nectar (primary robbing) or use robbing holes that
   others have made (secondary robbing). We found that experience of
   foraging from robbed flowers significantly promoted the development of
   primary robbing in previously legitimate foragers, thus implying that
   the acquisition of nectar robbing by one individual will facilitate its
   adoption in others. Our findings suggest that the positive feedback
   effects of social transmission may potentially play an ecologically
   important role in the relationship between plants and pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Despite their importance as pollinators in crops and wild plants,
   solitary bees have not previously been included in nontarget testing of
   insect-resistant transgenic crop plants. Larvae of many solitary bees
   feed almost exclusively on pollen and thus could be highly exposed to
   transgene products expressed in the pollen. The potential effects of
   pollen from oilseed rape expressing the cysteine protease inhibitor
   oryzacystatin-1 (OC-1) were investigated on larvae of the solitary bee
   Osmia bicornis (= O. rufa). Furthermore, recombinant OC-1 (rOC-1), the
   Bt toxin Cry1Ab and the snowdrop lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin
   (GNA) were evaluated for effects on the life history parameters of this
   important pollinator. Pollen provisions from transgenic OC-1 oilseed
   rape did not affect overall development. Similarly, high doses of rOC-1
   and Cry1Ab as well as a low dose of GNA failed to cause any significant
   effects. However, a high dose of GNA (0.1\%) in the larval diet resulted
   in significantly increased development time and reduced efficiency in
   conversion of pollen food into larval body weight. Our results suggest
   that OC-1 and Cry1Ab expressing transgenic crops would pose a negligible
   risk for O. bicornis larvae, whereas GNA expressing plants could cause
   detrimental effects, but only if bees were exposed to high levels of the
   protein. The described bioassay with bee brood is not only suitable for
   early tier non-target tests of transgenic plants, but also has broader
   applicability to other crop protection products.}},

Abstract = {{A major determinant of bumblebees pollination efficiency is the distance

   We employ a transect setting, controlling for both forage and nest

   distance. The mean foraging distance of B. terrestris workers was 267.2
   m +/- 180.3 m (max. 800 m). Nearly 40\% of the workers foraged within
   100 m around the nest. B. terrestris workers have thus rather moderate
   foraging ranges if rewarding forage is available within vicinity of the
   nests. We found the spatial distribution and the quality of forage plots
   to be the major determinants for the bees foraging decision-making,

Abstract = {{Cyrtopodium punctatum is a rare epiphytic orchid in southern Florida,
   made rare by historical over-collection. We examined the potential
   pollination of this orchid by the recently naturalized orchid bee
   (Euglossa viridissima), recorded as a pollinator of the orchid in
   tropical America, and found that this orchid bee is not a pollinator of
   the plant. We sought to learn what is responsible for relatively heavy
   fruit set in a Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden population of C.
   punctatum, and determined that the native oil-collecting bee, Centris
   errans, is the most important pollinator. C. punctatum flowers at
   Fairchild have 18 times the fruit set of flowers in Everglades National
   Park. The difference is probably due to the many species and individuals
   of oil-reward plants in the Malpighiaceae in the garden, compared to one
   uncommon native species in the park. Female C. errans visit these
   oil-reward flowers to obtain edible oils to provision their brood.
   Cyrtopodium flowers appear to mimic the oil-reward flowers of the
   Malpighiaceae to attract Centris bee pollinators, much as many Oncidium
   orchids do in tropical America. We recommend that Brysonima lucida, a
   rare native mal-pighiaceous shrub, and C. punctatum be planted together
   in Everglades National Park and other natural areas to attempt to
   increase C. errans pollination, to restore and enhance the long-term
   survival of the orchid. Planting model malpighiaceous plants to enhance
   Centris bee pollination may be a useful restoration tactic for other
   rare orchid mimics in the American tropics, including Atlantic Forest in
   Brazil. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plants engage in diverse and intimate interactions with unrelated taxa.
   For example, aboveground. oral visitors provide pollination services,
   while belowground arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) enhance nutrient
   capture. Traditionally in ecology, these processes were studied in
   isolation, reinforcing the prevailing assumption that these above- and
   belowground processes were also functionally distinct. More recently,
   there has been a growing realization that the soil surface is not a
   barrier to many ecological interactions, particularly those involving
   plants (who live simultaneously above and below ground). Because of the
   potentially large impact that mycorrhizae and. oral visitors can have on
   plant performance and community dynamics, we designed an experiment to
   test whether these multi-species mutualisms were interdependent under
   field conditions. Using benomyl, a widely used fungicide, we suppressed
   AMF in a native grassland, measuring plant, fungal, and floral-visitor
   responses after three years of fungal suppression. AMF suppression
   caused a shift in the community of. oral visitors from large-bodied bees
   to small-bodied bees and flies, and reduced the total number of. oral
   visits per flowering stem 67\% across the 23 flowering species found in
   the plots. Fungal suppression has species-specific effects on. oral
   visits for the six most common flowering plants in this experiment.
   Exploratory analyses suggest these results were due to changes in.
   oral-visitor behavior due to altered patch-level. oral display, rather
   than through direct effects of AMF suppression on. oral morphology. Our
   findings indicate that AMF are an important, and overlooked, driver of.
   oral-visitor community structure with the potential to affect
   pollination services. These results support the growing body of research
   indicating that interactions among ecological interactions can be of
   meaningful effect size under natural field conditions and may influence
   individual performance, population dynamics, and community structure.}},

   pollinators, resulting in no conflicting selection on. oral traits.
   Unlike pollinators, whose preference for certain. oral traits does not

Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Understanding population declines has been the objective of a wide range
   of ecological studies. When species have become rare such studies are
   complicated because particular behavior or life history traits may be
   the cause but also the result of the decline of a species. We approached
   this problem by studying species' characteristics on specimens that were
   collected before the onset of their decline and preserved in natural
   history museums. In northwestern Europe, some bumble bee species
   declined dramatically during the 20th century whereas other,
   ecologically similar, species maintained stable populations. A
   long-standing debate focuses on whether this is caused by declining
   species having stricter host plant preferences. We compared the
   composition of pollen loads of five bumble bee species with stable
   populations and five with declining populations using museum specimens
   collected before 1950 in Belgium, England, and The Netherlands. Prior to
   1950, the number of plant taxa in pollen loads of declining species was
   almost one-third lower than that in stable species even though
   individuals of stable and declining species generally originated from
   the same areas. There were no systematic differences in the composition
   of pollen loads between stable and declining species, but the plant taxa
   preferred by declining species before 1950 had experienced a stronger
   decline in the 20th century than those preferred by stable species. In
   2004 and 2005, we surveyed the areas where bumble bees had been caught
   in the past and compared the composition of past and present pollen
   loads of the stable, but not of the by now locally extinct declining
   species. The number of collected pollen taxa was similar, but the
   composition differed significantly between the two periods. Differences
   in composition reflected the major changes in land use in northwestern
   Europe but also the spread of the invasive plant species Impatiens
   glandulifera. The main question now is why declining species apparently
   were not able to switch to less preferred food plants when stable
   species were. This study shows that natural history collections can play
   an important role in improving our understanding of the ecological
   mechanisms driving species population change.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent selection is a method for population improvement which has
   been used in soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merrill] to modify traits such
   as grain yield, seed-protein content, seed-oil content, tolerance to
   iron-deficiency chlorosis, and seed size. Nuclear male-sterility with
   insect-mediated cross-pollination has been successfully used in
   recurrent selection schemes in soybean. However, little attention has
   been given to selection to increase the agronomic performance of
   male-sterile plants per se. The objective of this study was to evaluate
   the response of male-sterile lines segregating for male-sterile alleles
   ms2, ms3, ms6, ms8, and ms9 to phenotypic recurrent selection for
   increased seed-set after 3 cycles, using a selected group of male
   parents. Bees halictidae, anthophoridae, andrenidae, and megachilidae
   were utilized as the pollinator vector. The results indicated that
   recurrent selection in a favorable environment was successful to
   increase the number of seeds per male-sterile plant. Although a
   differential response was observed among populations, the seed-set
   observed would justify the use of some specific male-sterile selections

Abstract = {{We examined natural hybridization between two morphologically and
   ecologically divergent species on Yakushima Island-the light-purple
   flowered Rhododendron eriocarpum native to seaside habitats and the red
   flowered R. indicum native to riverside habitats. By investigation of
   morphological traits and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP)
   we found that hybrid individuals morphologically and genetically
   intermediate between the two species grow mainly in the seaside areas of
   the island. The degree of morphological and genetic variation was
   different among the seaside hybrid populations. Although most pollinator
   species were exclusive to one of the two flower color groups, the
   halictine bees of Lasioglossum were observed in both the color types.
   The crucial interspecific incompatibility after pollination has not been
   previously described. Geographic distance between the populations is
   likely to be an important primary factor in bringing about natural
   hybridization and determining the degree of introgression between R.
   eriocarpum and R. indicum. The fact that hybrids occur mostly in the
   seaside area on Yakushima Island indicates that asymmetrical
   introgression occurs from R. indicum to R. eriocarpum. Alternatively,
   strong habitat-mediated selection from recurrent floods may prevent the
   hybrids from colonizing riverside habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In order to make a scientific and practical plan for conservation of an
   endangered species, it is indispensable to identify the kind of insects
   effective in legitimate pollination and to clarify the main factors on
   their pollination behavior. Primula merrilliana, a small biennial
   rosette herb with distylous flowers, is an endangered and endemic
   species of China. In this study, the effective pollinators and the
   effects of flower density and population size on pollination efficiency
   were investigated. The results indicated that the primary effective
   pollinators of this distylous herb were two bee flies, Bombylius major
   and Anastoechus chinensis rather than Thrips sp., which was previously
   considered as an effective pollinator for the plant. The density of
   flowers and the population size were the two main factors that
   influenced pollination efficiency of P merrilliana. Flowers with higher
   density attracted more pollinator visits, particularly in low dense
   populations. The number of pollinators and flowers visited per day and
   the average time of a flower visited per day were significantly
   positively correlated to the density of flowers in the samples.
   Legitimate pollination and its percentage of total stigmatic pollen
   loads were higher in larger populations. The biased ratio of
   short-styled and long-styled flowers and pollinator limitation might be
   responsible for pollination disadvantages in small populations.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutter bee, Megachile rotundata (Fab.) (Hymenoptera:
   Megachilidae), was introduced into the lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium
   angustifolium and V. myrtilloides (Ericaceae), agro-ecosystems of
   Atlantic Canada and the state of Maine in the early 1990's. As a managed
   pollinator of this crop, this typical ``summer-active{''} bee is
   released approximately one month earlier than for alfalfa pollination
   and therefore is exposed to a different set of climatological
   conditions, primarily night time temperatures which can reach as low as
   -8 degrees C during flowering. The objectives of this study were to
   investigate aspects of cold-hardiness in post-diapausing M. rotundata,
   and to determine the potential effects of subzero temperatures on adult
   females through studies of supercooling capacity and survival at low
   temperatures. Post-diapausing M. rotundata maintain a supercooling
   capacity below -23 degrees C until pupation, after which all
   developmental stages freeze between -15 degrees C and -17 degrees C. Fed
   and unfed adult females show significant differences in their
   supercooling capacity; -8 degrees C and -16 degrees C, respectively.
   Bees which have fed showed very little susceptibility to temperatures
   above -5 degrees C, but mortality significantly increased at -10 degrees
   C, and was 100\% at -15 degrees C. As such, M. rotundata populations are
   likely susceptible to unusually cool night time temperatures when used
   for lowbush blueberry pollination. The implications of earlier release
   times on bee biology and population recovery for pollination are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Pan traps (colored plastic bowls) are frequently used as an efficient
   standardized method of sampling bee faunas. We explored the utility of
   pan traps in three colors compared to net collecting using simultaneous
   sampling at biweekly intervals throughout the flowering season (May-Sep)
   at 11 sites in the eastern Great Basin Desert. Pan traps deployed for
   one day (9:00-16:00) on average captured significantly larger samples
   than net collections (2 hr.) at all intervals except the latter half of
   May. Average species richness for net collections exceeded pan traps
   only during late May and late September, periods with abundant floral
   resources. Capture rates were similar between colors. The composition of
   bees was also similar; Sorensen's similarity values exceeded 0.7. Color
   preferences for pollen specialists did not match flower color of their
   hosts. There were significant differences in species composition between
   net collections and pan trap collections. Almost one-third of the
   species showed a strong bias toward one method and in some cases between
   pan trap colors. The methods appear complementary: Halictinae and
   Perdita were predominantly collected in pan traps (85\%); three genera,
   Anthidium, Colletes, Epeolus were largely or entirely detected by
   netting. Net collecting should be used in addition to pan traps if
   comprehensive inventories are desired. Though pan trapping constitutes a
   standardized method that avoids collector bias, it may not be unbiased;
   capture rates were lowest when flowering plant richness was greatest.}},

Abstract = {{Merremia macrocalyx is a vine that grows over other plants or as a low
   creeper and is considered a weed of important crops. Study of its
   reproductive biology showed that its flowers comprise the typical
   features of the melittophilous pollination syndrome. Anthophoridae,
   Apidae, and Halictidae were its main floral visitors. Merremia
   macrocalyx showed a mixed mating system with features that promote
   outcrossing while allowing some autogamy. Floral biomass was allocated
   mainly to the corolla (attraction) which, together with the presence of
   herkogamy and protandry, favors out-crossing. Nevertheless, it is
   self-compatible and partially autogamous due to the position of anthers
   above the stigma. Foraging behavior of pollinators could also facilitate
   deposition of self pollen on the stigma. Ovule abortion was the main
   predispersal loss of potential seed production, closely followed by
   flower and fruit abortion. Predispersal seed predation and seed abortion
   were relatively low. Specimens of Megacerus flabelliger (Bruchidae) were
   found emerging from the seeds as well as some wasps belonging to
   families recognized as parasitoids. The mixed mating system showed by
   Merremia macroclayx, together with its pollination by generalist bees,
   provides advantages for its development as a weed.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to estimate the rate of exploitation of the floral resources of
   Sparattosperma leucanthum (Veil.) K. Schum. as well as the interaction
   with their floral visitors in the pollination, the number of visits by
   flower was sampled, according to the type of visitation, the collected
   resource and the visitor's behavior during the forage for flowers. The
   floral visitors were grouped into seven guilds, organized in decreasing
   order of benefit to the S. leucanthum flower's pollination: effective
   pollinator, occasional pollinator, endogamic pollinator, generalist
   visitor, thievery visitor, thievery-pi I lager ant and pillager visitor.
   The total of 48.2 +/- 8.84 visits were recorded by flower. Nearly 50\%
   of the visits resulted in nectar thief or pillage, which posed some
   problems to the reproduction of S. leucanthum, such as the drop in the
   attractiveness to pollinators and the harm to the flower's reproductive
   tissues. Trigona spinipes (Fabr.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was considered
   the most harmful species owing to the high frequency of pillage and
   forage. Bombus sp 1, however, was probably the species that pollinated
   S. lecanthum flowers the most, making use of the crossed pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the consequences of declining diversity and abundance of
   pollinators for crops and floral biodiversity is a major challenge for
   current conservation ecology. However, most studies on this issue focus
   on bees, while other invertebrate taxa are largely ignored. We
   investigated the pollination efficiency of the globally abundant hover
   fly Episyrphus balteatus on the common crop, oilseed rape (Brassica
   napus). The study was conducted over a period of 2 consecutive years by
   means of enclosure experiments at an agricultural site located in
   Central Hesse (Germany). E. balteatus significantly increased both seed
   set and yield. This effect was very constant in the 2 years, despite
   considerable interannual differences in total seed numbers and seed
   mass. It highlights the important role of hover flies as pollinators of
   arable crops under varying environmental conditions. In contrast to
   bees, the effect of E. balteatus was lower at high pollinator densities
   than at low pollinator densities. This suggests adverse effects of
   density-dependent factors on pollination efficiency at high densities.
   Thus, models ignoring the modulating effect of biotic interactions by
   generally assuming a simple positive relationship between pollinator
   density and pollination efficiency might not apply to a vital component
   of the pollinator community.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions might constitute a major threat to mutualisms.
   Introduced pollinators might competitively displace their native
   counterparts, which in turn affects the pollination of native plants, if
   native and alien visitors differ in pollinator effectiveness. Since its
   invasion in 1994 into south-west Argentina, the introduced European
   bumblebee Bombus ruderatus has continuously increased in abundance,
   along with a simultaneous decrease in the abundance of the native Bombus
   dahlbomii. The latter is the only native bumblebee species of the
   temperate forests of southern South America, and the main pollinator of
   the endemic herb Alstroemeria aurea. In order to evaluate the impact of
   the ongoing displacement of the native by the alien bumblebee, we
   compared the pollinator effectiveness (i.e., the combination of
   pollinator efficiency per visit and visitation frequency) between both
   bumblebee species, as well as related pollinator traits that might
   account for potential differences in pollinator efficiency. Native
   Bombus dahlbomii, which has a larger body and spent more time per
   flower, was the more efficient pollinator compared to Bombus ruderatus,
   both in terms of quantity and quality of pollen deposited per visit.
   However, Bombus ruderatus was a much more frequent flower visitor than
   Bombus dahlbomii. As a consequence, Bombus ruderatus is nowadays a more
   effective pollinator of A. aurea than its native congener. Despite the
   lack of evidence of an increase in seed set at the population level,
   comparisons with historical records of Bombus dahlbomii abundances prior
   to Bombus ruderatus' invasion suggest that the overall pollination
   intensity of A. aurea might in fact have risen as a consequence of this
   invasion. Field experiments like these, that incorporate the natural
   variation in abundance of native and alien species, are powerful means
   to demonstrate that the consequences of invasions are more complex than
   previous manipulated and controlled experiments have suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid zones can form when two species of plants hybridize along an
   environmental gradient. Changes in floral morphology across such a
   gradient and the degree of reproductive isolation can be influenced by
   pollinator behavior, but little is known about pollinator visitation to
   hybridizing species that receive visits from a diverse array of animals.
   I studied floral morphology, nectar rewards and pollinator visitation
   for Penstemon newberryi, P. davidsonii and their hybrids along an
   elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada of California. Sixty-two
   floral visitor species were observed visiting plants, making this system
   highly generalized compared to previous studies of visitation in hybrid
   zones. Morphological measurements were used to construct a plant hybrid
   index and examine the correlation with elevation and with floral
   visitors. Using observations of floral visitors along the gradient, I
   performed an ordination to determine whether the pollinator community
   changed along with plant morphology. Plants varied in a clinal pattern
   along the elevational gradient. The visitor community varied
   incrementally with altitude, although visitors to Penstemon davidsonii
   were separated from those to P. newberryi and hybrids along the main
   ordination axis. Hummingbirds were only found at low and middle
   elevations, and small halictid bees were relatively more abundant at
   high elevations. Although there is some potential for ecological
   isolation in the pollinator community, I I common pollinator species
   visited both parent species and could be contributing to hybrid
   formation.}},

   rain and covered treatments. In spite of a heavy crop load, fruits
   obtained under open and supplemental pollination were also heavier and
   larger, this could be partly due to a significant increase in seeds and
   flesh weight. Sugar content was good for both open and supplemental
   pollination. Wind plays little or no role in loquat pollination process.
   Loquat flowers attracted very limited number of bee visitors, A.

Abstract = {{Fruit set and quality of highland coffee (Coffea arabica) have been
   experimentally shown to be higher with bee-mediated or manual pollen
   supplementation than with autonomous self-pollination. Based on
   extrapolation from these small-scale experiments, very substantial
   monetary values for the pollination service have recently been
   suggested. However, previous research has not included direct
   measurement of coffee yield at a farm level in relation to pollinator
   activity, testing if pollinators are not only limiting fruit set and
   quality, but also coffee yield and farm profit. The extrapolations from
   small-scale experiments may be subject to error, because resource
   reallocation during fruit development, associated with enhanced
   pollination, was neglected, and many studies were restricted to a single
   coffee farm, limiting the validity of extrapolation. Here, we
   investigate the relationship between coffee yield and the community of
   coffee flower-visiting bees on 21 farms in Ecuador, where coffee is
   grown under tree shade. Our data show, for the first time on a
   farm-scale, that coffee yield was positively related to the density of
   non-managed, social flower-visiting bees per coffee shrub, but not to
   the number of inflorescences per shrub. Our data revealed that a
   fourfold increase in bee density was associated with an 80\% increase in
   yield and an 800\% increase in net revenues. Consequently, in our study
   higher yield associated with increased pollination generated higher
   revenues per hectare, so that farm profit was higher when bees were
   abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Floral rewards may be associated with certain
   morphological floral traits and thus act as underlying factors promoting
   selection on these traits. This study investigates whether some traits
   that are under pollinator-mediated selection (flower number, stalk
   height, corolla diameter, corolla tube length and corolla tube width) in
   the Mediterranean herb E. mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae) are associated
   with rewards (pollen and nectar).
   Methods During 2005 the phenotypic traits and the visitation rate of the
   main pollinator functional groups were quantified in 720 plants
   belonging to eight populations in south-east Spain, and during 2006 the
   same phenotypic traits and the reward production were quantified in 400
   additional plants from the same populations.
   Key Results A significant correlation was found between nectar
   production rate and corolla tube length, and between pollen production
   and corolla diameter. Visitation rates of large bees and butterflies
   were significantly higher in plants exhibiting larger flowers with
   longer corolla tubes.
   Conclusions The association between reward production and floral traits
   may be a factor underlying the pattern of visitation rate displayed by
   some pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar standing crops in flowers within an individual plant are often
   highly variable. This variability may be a by-product of the foraging
   activity of insect pollinators. Alternatively, plants may be selected to
   produce highly variable rewards to reduce consecutive visitation by
   risk-averse pollinators, thus diminishing within-plant pollen transfer.
   This study evaluated the roles of pollinator control vs. plant control
   over nectar variability in the bee-pollinated shrub Rosmarinus
   officinalis L. (Lamiaceae). We sampled nectar production, standing crop
   and pollinator visits in three shrubs of one population over 17 days
   during one blooming season. Nectar production rates were highly variable
   (CV = 1.48), and increased after rainy days. Nectar standing crops were
   even more variable (CV = 2.16), decreased with increasing temperatures,
   and increased with time since the last rain. Pollinator visit rates
   decreased with variability in nectar standing crops, increased with
   flower number per shrub, and were unaffected by variability in nectar
   production rates. Repeated sampling of marked flowers revealed no
   correlation between their nectar standing crops and production rates.
   These findings support the role of reward variance in reducing
   pollinator visits, but suggest that plants are not in complete control
   of this variability. Rather, plant-generated variability can be modified
   by intensive foraging activity of pollinators. Such pollinator control
   over nectar variability is likely to reduce the selective advantage of
   plant-generated reward variation.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) have been declining rapidly in many temperate
   regions of the Old World. Despite their ecological and economic
   importance as pollinators, North American bumblebees have not been
   extensively surveyed and their conservation status is largely unknown.
   In this study, two approaches were used to determine whether bumblebees
   in that region were in decline spatially and temporally. First, surveys
   performed in 2004-2006 in southern Ontario were compared to surveys from
   1971 to 1973 in the same sites to look at changes in community
   composition, in one of the most bumblebee diverse areas of eastern North
   America. Second, the extent of range decline for a focal species (Bombus
   affinis Cresson) was estimated by surveying 43 sites throughout its
   known native range in eastern Canada and the United States. Our study
   documents an impoverishment of the bumblebee community in southern
   Ontario over the past 35 years. Bombus affinis in particular was found
   to have declined drastically in abundance not only in southern Ontario
   but throughout its native range. The loss of any bumblebee species may
   result in cascading impacts on native fauna and flora and reduce
   agricultural production. Implications for the conservation of this
   important group of pollinators are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are among the most important pollinators of angiosperm plants. Many
   bee species show narrow host-plant preferences, reflected both in
   behavioral and morphological adaptations to particular attributes of
   host-plant pollen or floral morphology. Whether bee host-plant
   associations reflect co-cladogenesis of bees and their host plants or
   host-switches to unrelated host plants is not clear. Rophitinae is a
   basal subfamily of Halictidae in which most species show narrow
   host-plant preferences (oligolecty). We reconstructed the phylogenetic
   relationships among the rophitine genera using a combination of adult
   morphology (24 characters) and DNA sequence data (EF-1 alpha, LW
   rhodopsin, wingless; 2700 bp total). The data set was analyzed by
   parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. All methods yielded
   highly congruent results. Using the phylogeny, we investigated the
   pattern of host-plant association as well as the historical biogeography
   of Rophitinae. Our biogeographical analysis suggests a number of
   dispersal/vicariance events: (1) a basal split between North America and
   South America (most likely a dispersal from South America to North
   America), and (2) at least two subsequent interchanges between North
   America and Eurasia (presumably via the northern hemisphere land
   bridges). Our analysis of host-plant associations indicates that
   Rophitinae specialized on a closely related group of angiosperm orders
   in the Euasterid I clade (mainly Gentianales, Lamiales and Solanales).
   However, there is little evidence of cocladogenesis between bees and
   plants and strong evidence of host switches to unrelated host plants.
   Based on our phylogenetic results we describe two new tribes of
   Rophitinae: Conanthalictini new tribe (including the genus
   Conanthalictus) and Xeralictini new tribe (including Xeralictus and
   Protodufourea). (C) The Willi Hennig Society 2007.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptic species diversity is thought to be common within the class
   Insecta, posing problems for basic ecological and population genetic
   studies and conservation management. Within the temperate bumble bee
   (Bombus spp.) fauna, members of the subgenus Bombus sensu stricto are
   amongst the most abundant and widespread. However, their species
   diversity is controversial due to the extreme difficulty or inability
   morphologically to identify the majority of individuals to species. Our
   character-based phylogenetic analyses of partial CO1 (700 bp) from 39
   individuals spread across their sympatric European ranges provided
   unequivocal support for five taxa (3-22 diagnostic DNA base pair sites
   per species). Inclusion of 20 Irish specimens to the dataset revealed >=
   2.3\% sequence divergence between taxa and <= 1.3\% within taxa. We
   developed a PCR-RFLP based method for unequivocally distinguishing
   amongst the four cryptic European taxa of this subgenus, B. cryptarum,
   B. lucorum, B. magnus and B. terrestris, and used it to analyse 391
   females of the former three species collected across Ireland, all of
   which could be unambiguously assigned to species. Bombus lucorum was the
   most widely distributed and abundant of the cryptarum-lucorum-magnus
   species complex, comprising 56\% of individuals, though it was
   significantly less abundant at higher altitudes (> 200 m) whilst B.
   cryptarum was relatively more abundant at higher altitudes. Bombus
   magnus was rarely encountered at urban sites. Both B. lucorum and B.
   terrestris are nowadays reared commercially for pollination and
   transported globally. Our RFLP approach to identify native fauna can
   underpin ecological studies of these important cryptic species as well
   as the impact of commercial bumble bees on them.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1583-1595}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Plants that lack floral rewards can attract pollinators if they share
   attractive floral signals with rewarding plants. These deceptive plants
   should benefit from flowering in close proximity to such rewarding
   plants, because pollinators are locally conditioned on floral signals of
   the rewarding plants (mimic effect) and because pollinators are more
   abundant close to rewarding plants (magnet effect). We tested these
   ideas using the non-rewarding South African plant Eulophia zeyheriana
   (Orchidaceae) as a study system. Field observations revealed that E.
   zeyheriana is pollinated solely by solitary bees belonging to a single
   species of Lipotriches (Halictidae) that appears to be closely
   associated with the flowers of Wahlenbergia cuspidata (Campanulaceae), a
   rewarding plant with which the orchid is often sympatric. The pale blue
   color of the flowers of E. zeyheriana differs strongly from flowers of
   its congeners, but is very similar to that of flowers of W. cuspidata.
   Analysis of spectral reflectance patterns using a bee vision model
   showed that bees are unlikely to be able to distinguish the two species
   in terms of flower color. A UV-absorbing sunscreen was applied to the
   flowers of the orchid in order to alter their color, and this resulted
   in a significant decline in pollinator visits, thus indicating the
   importance of flower color for attraction of Lipotriches bees.
   Pollination success in the orchid was strongly affected by proximity to
   patches of W. cuspidata. This was evident from one of two surveys of
   natural populations of the orchid, as well as experiments in which we
   translocated inflorescences of the orchid either into patches of W.
   cuspidata or 40 m outside such patches. Flower color and location of E.
   zeyheriana plants relative to rewarding magnet patches are therefore key
   components of the exploitation by this orchid of the relationship
   between W. cuspidata and Lipotriches bee pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Natural vegetation is often replaced by invasive alien plants on
   isolated oceanic islands. To determine how invasive alien plants affect
   insect diversity, we compared flying insects captured using Malaise
   traps among different vegetation types on a small island (Nishijima;
   0.49 km(2)) in the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands in the
   north-western Pacific. The numbers of individuals and species, and the
   species composition of pollinators (bees), predators (wasps) and wood
   borers (cerambycid, mordellid and elaterid beetles) were compared among
   three vegetation types: Casuarina equisetifolia (an invasive alien tree)
   forest, natural forest and natural grassland (forest edge), during two
   seasons (June and October-November 2005). In traps, 80.0, 66.7, 87.5,
   85.7 and 100.0\% of bee, wasp, cerambycid, mordellid and elaterid beetle
   species, respectively, were endemic to the Ogasawara Islands. Grassland
   had the highest wasp and bee species richness, whereas natural forest
   had the highest species richness of wood-boring beetles. The C.
   equisetifolia forest had the poorest species richness for most insect
   groups (except mordellid beetles). More individuals of most insect
   groups (except bees) were captured in June than in October-November.
   More individual bees and wasps were captured in grassland than in
   forests, whereas more individual mordellid and elaterid beetles were
   captured in forests than in grassland. The number of cerambycid
   individuals did not differ among vegetation types. Redundancy analysis
   suggested that most insect species preferred natural forest or grassland
   to alien forest. Therefore, further invasion of natural grassland and
   forest by the alien tree C. equisetifolia may negatively affect the
   endemic insect fauna of Nishijima.}},

Abstract = {{1. Over the last decades, biodiversity in agricultural landscapes has
   declined drastically. Initiatives to enhance biodiversity, such as
   agri-environment schemes, often have little effect, especially in
   intensively farmed landscapes. The effectiveness of conservation
   management may be improved by scheme implementation near high-quality
   habitats that can act as a source of species. We evaluated up to what
   distance high-quality habitats (nature reserves and artificially created
   flower-rich patches) affect the diversity of forbs and pollinators in
   intensively farmed landscapes of the Netherlands.
   2. We surveyed forbs, inflorescences, bees and hover flies and estimated
   pollination services in transects along ditch banks extending 300 m from
   four nature reserves forming small islands in landscapes dominated by
   agriculture.
   3. In a separate experiment, we surveyed inflorescences, bees and hover
   flies in 1500 m long transects on farmland adjacent to five newly
   introduced flower-rich patches and in five control transects.
   4. Species density of forbs declined over the first 75 m and species
   density and abundance of hover flies declined over the first 125 m
   beyond the nature reserves. Beyond these distances, no further declines
   were observed. The effects of flower-rich patches were spatially
   limited. The species density and abundance of bees and hover flies were
   significantly enhanced in the flower-rich patch, but only the abundance
   of hover flies was enhanced up to 50 m beyond the patch.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In intensively farmed areas, remnant
   high-quality habitats sustain more abundant and diverse pollinator and
   forb communities than the surrounding countryside. They do enhance
   biodiversity on nearby farmland but increases are spatially restricted
   (< 150 m) and relatively small. These habitats may therefore function
   only as dispersal sources for ecological restoration sites or
   agricultural fields under extensification schemes that are located in
   close proximity. Habitat restoration in intensively used farmland should
   therefore be implemented preferentially in the immediate vicinity of
   high-quality habitats. In the short term, newly created flower-rich
   habitats are no alternative to pre-existing seminatural habitats for the
   promotion of pollinators on nearby farmland.}},

Title = {{The influence of grazing intensity and landscape composition on the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{763-772}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. The loss of semi-natural grasslands in agro-ecosystems has increased
   the importance of adequate management of remaining grasslands.
   Recommendations for intensive grazing have been debated because the
   effects of different management practices may differ between taxa and
   species. The increased fragmentation of grasslands suggests that the
   influence of management practices should be studied in a landscape
   context.
   2. We studied four groups of flower visitors, many of which are
   pollinators, bees (Apoidea), butterflies (Lepidoptera), hoverflies
   (Syrphidae) and beetles (Coleoptera), in semi-natural grasslands managed
   at three intensity levels in eight areas in central Sweden. Local
   characteristics of the grasslands were recorded and landscape diversity
   was quantified. Vegetation height was correlated with grazing intensity:
   intensive grazing with the shortest vegetation and abandoned grassland
   with the tallest.
   3. The insect groups responded differently to grazing intensity. Species
   richness and abundance differed between management regimes for beetles
   and hoverflies but not for bees and butterflies.
   4. The effects of local habitat and landscape composition on species
   richness, abundance and composition differed between groups. Bee
   diversity responded to both local and landscape factors. Butterflies
   were mainly affected by local vegetation height and linear elements in
   the landscape. More species of hoverflies were recorded in tall
   vegetation and in landscapes with high forest cover. Beetles responded
   only to local environment characteristics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the importance of studying
   different insect groups simultaneously when evaluating habitat and
   landscape qualities for diversity. The results suggest that planning for
   conservation of biodiversity at landscape scales may be better than
   implementing grazing guidelines for individual grasslands. Grazing
   intensity should vary within or between landscapes to preserve
   pollinator diversity. Conservation management to encourage flower
   visitors cannot be generalized to include all groups simultaneously.}},

Title = {{Quantifying and comparing bumblebee nest densities in gardens and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Bumblebees provide an important pollination service to both crops and
   wild plants. Many species have declined in the UK, particularly in
   arable regions. While bumblebee forage requirements have been widely
   studied, there has been less consideration of whether availability of
   nesting sites is limiting. It is important to know which habitats
   contain the most bumblebee nests per unit area in order to guide
   conservation and management options; particularly in the light of
   current emphasis on environmental stewardship schemes for farmed
   landscapes. However, it is extremely difficult to map the distribution
   of bumblebee nests.
   2. We describe the findings of the National Bumblebee Nest Survey, a
   structured survey carried out by 719 volunteers in the UK during early
   summer 2004. The surveyors used a defined protocol to record the
   presence or absence of bumblebee nests in prescribed areas of gardens,
   short grassland, long grassland and woodland, and along woodland edge,
   hedgerows and fence lines. The records allowed us to estimate the
   density of bumblebee nests in each of these habitats for the first time.
   3. Nest densities were high in gardens (36 nests ha(-1)), and linear
   countryside habitats (fence lines, hedgerows, woodland edge: 20-37 nests
   ha(-1)), and lower in non-linear countryside habitats (woodland and
   grassland: 11-15 nests ha(-1)).
   4. Findings on nest location characteristics corroborate those of an
   earlier survey carried out in the UK (Fussell \& Corbet 1992).
   5. Synthesis and applications. Gardens provide an important nesting
   habitat for bumblebees in the UK. In the countryside, the area occupied
   by linear features is small compared with that of non-linear features.
   However, as linear features contain high densities of nests, management
   options affecting such features may have a disproportionately large
   effect on bumblebee nesting opportunities. Current farm stewardship
   schemes in the UK are therefore likely to facilitate bumblebee nesting,
   because they provide clear guidance and support for `sympathetic'
   hedgerow and field margin management.}},

Abstract = {{Cavity-nesting alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (F.)
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), are excellent pollinators of alfalfa,
   Medicago savita L., for seed production. In commercial settings,
   artificial cavities are placed in field domiciles for nesting and,
   thereby, bee populations are sustained for future use. For this study,
   cells from leafcutting bee nests were collected in late summer from
   commercial seed fields. Over 3 yr (2003-2005), 39 samples in total of
   approximate to 1,000 cells each were taken from several northwestern
   U.S. states and from Manitoba, Canada. X-radiography of 500 cells from
   each sample was used to identify ``pollen balls{''} (i.e., cells in
   which the pollen-nectar provision remained, but the egg or larva, if
   present, was not detectable on an x-radiograph). Most U.S. samples
   seemed to have higher proportions of pollen ball cells than Manitoba
   samples. Pollen ball cells were dissected to determine the moisture
   condition of the mass provision and true contents of each cell. Most
   pollen ball cells from Manitoba samples contained fungus, the frequency
   of which was positively correlated with cool, wet weather. In the United
   States, most pollen ball cells had moist provisions, and many of them
   lacked young brood. Correlation analysis revealed that pollen ball cells
   occurred in greater proportions in fields with more hot days (above 38
   degrees C). Broodless pollen ball cells occurred in greater proportions
   under cool conditions, but dead small larvae (second-third instars)
   seemed to occur in greater proportions under hot conditions. Pollen ball
   cells with unhatched eggs and first instars (in the chorion) occurred in
   lesser proportions under hot conditions.}},

Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{535-543}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Rapid speciation within some plant families has been attributed to the
   evolution of floral spurs and to the effect of spur length on plant
   reproductive success. The flowers of Impatiens capensis (jewelweed)
   possess a long, curved spur in which nectar is produced and stored. Spur
   length and curvature varies among plants within one population. Here I
   document that spur shape is variable in natural populations, variation
   within plants is less than variation among plants, and spur shape is
   correlated with components of female and male reproductive success. The
   apparent natural selection is weakly directional in 1 of 2 years, with
   greatest seed production and pollen removal occurring in flowers with
   the greatest spur curvature. Bee pollinator visit length is longest at
   flowers with highly curved spurs, and they leave less nectar in these
   spurs than in flowers with straighter spurs. Spur angle evolution may be
   limited, at least in part, by opposing selection by nectar-robbers who
   prefer to visit flowers with greater spur curvature. Other factors that
   might contribute to the maintenance of spur angle variation are temporal
   variation in the strength of selection and potential genetic
   correlations of spur shape with other traits under selection.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in floral phenotype (color, depth, nectar) suggests incipient
   specialization for bee or hawkmoth pollination across the geographic
   distribution of Echinopsis ancistrophora, with flower depth ranging from
   4.5 to 24 cm. We used chemical and behavioral analyses to test whether
   fragrance has evolved in concert with morphology in these Andean cacti.
   Floral scent (145 total compounds) was collected using dynamic headspace
   methods and analyzed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,
   revealing subspecies-specific odors dominated by sesquiterpenes in E.
   ssp. ancistrophora and arachnacantha and fatty acid derivatives or
   aromatics in E ssp. cardenasiana and pojoensis. Compounds indicative of
   sphingophily were not consistently found in moth-pollinated plants, and
   total scent emissions were significantly lower in populations with
   nocturnal anthesis. In wind tunnel assays, Manduca sexta moths were
   attracted to scent of ssp. ancistrophora from both bee and
   hawkmoth-pollinated populations, but not to scent of ssp. cardenasiana.
   However, hawkmoths were most attracted to the methyl benzoate-dominated
   scent of a distant relative, Echinopsis mirabilis. Thus,
   hawkmoth-pollinated descendants of the E ancistrophora lineage may be
   phylogenetically constrained to emit weak, sesquiterpene-dominated
   fragrances that are not optimally attractive to hawkmoths, or floral
   scent may be under stronger selection by destructive flower visitors.}},

   apples and pears cultivated in Israel, where conditions for pollination
   are usually unfavorable, it was demonstrated that yields may be
   correlated with compatibility levels of pollinators. In the present
   study fruit-set of semi- and fully compatible plum couples was
   determined for a wide range of cultivars, in unfavorable and favorable
   conditions. Full compatibility was found superior to semi-compatibility,
   in both unfavorable and favorable conditions for pollination. These
   findings should be taken into consideration in determining the orchard

Abstract = {{Many orchids lack floral nectar rewards and therefore rely on deception
   to attract pollinators. To determine the effect that a mutation for
   nectar production would have on overall pollination success of the
   deceptive orchid Dactylorhiza sambucina, we recorded pollen deposition
   and removal in flowers of plants that had either been supplemented with
   an artificial nectar solution or left unmanipulated as controls. Nectar
   supplementation resulted in significant increases in the proportion of
   flowers pollinated, regardless of morph colour and the density of plants
   supplemented in the population. However, nectar supplementation had a
   significant positive effect on pollinaria removal only for the yellow
   morph in one experiment in which a low proportion of plants were
   supplemented. Thus a mutation for nectar production would have a
   positive effect on overall pollination success in D. sambucina,
   particularly the female component. The observed patterns are discussed
   in relation to other factors, such as cross-pollination and the
   reallocation of nectar,resources for other plant functions, which are
   traditionally considered to shape the rewardless strategies of orchids.

Abstract = {{The world's only intensively managed ground-nesting bee, the alkali bee
   (Nomia melanderi Cockerell), has been used for >50 years as an effective
   pollinator of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) grown for seed in the western
   USA. Across a 240 km(2) watershed in Washington, the 24 most populous of
   56 nest sites found were annually surveyed for nesting bees for 8 years.
   Alkali bees multiplied 9-fold to 17 million females, the largest
   reported metapopulation of non-social bees. Several sites have remained
   populous for an unprecedented 50 years. The most populous nesting bed
   (1.5 ha) grew to 5.3 million nesting females (median = 278 nests/m(2)),
   the largest bee nesting aggregation ever recorded. This first-ever
   exhaustive landscape-level survey for any non-social bee reveals that
   even amid intensive conventional agriculture, a native bee can
   sustainably multiply to vast numbers, its nesting aggregations
   persisting for decades.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of bottom-up or top-down forces has been mainly
   studied for herbivores but rarely for pollinators. Habitat fragmentation
   might change driving forces of population dynamics by reducing the area
   of resource-providing habitats, disrupting habitat connectivity, and
   affecting natural enemies more than their host species. We studied
   spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in
   size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central
   Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate
   of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests
   as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally
   enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean
   local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002.
   Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with
   habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among
   years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with
   highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of
   regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of
   independent time series showed on average a negative impact of
   population size on population growth rates but provides no support for
   top-down regulation by natural enemies. We conclude that population
   dynamics of O. rufa are mainly driven by bottom-up forces, primarily
   nest site availability.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive characteristics and pollination system of Rhododendron

   species is protandrous, partially self-incompatible at postzygotic
   stages, and requires outcrossing via pollinator visitation for effective
   seed production. The effective pollinators were two bumblebee species:
   males of Bombus ardens at Miyama, and workers of Bombus honshuensis at
   Agematsu. The flowers possess two staminodes ornamented with whitish
   hairs, which do not reflect UV light, on the filaments. Nectar was
   secreted continuously during the flowering period, and nectar production
   rate differed between the sites. Visitation by B. ardens males was more
   frequent and varied among and within days, whereas that by B.
   honshuensis workers was less frequent and constant throughout the
   observation period. A single visit by a B. ardens male was more
   effective for seed production than visitation by a B. honshuensis
   worker, resulting in pollen limitation in the latter case. Differences
   in resource requirements between the two pollinators, representing
   different castes, might affect their behavior, resulting in B. ardens
   males contributing to more effective seed production.}},

   The plant is abundant in the area, aggregated, and has a long flowering
   period, with very variable daily flower output. Although it can
   self-fertilize, it requires a pollen vector. Insect visitors totalled 21
   species of bees and lepidopterans, including both pollinators and nectar
   robbers. Individuals of C. serrirostris defend their territories against
   other hummingbirds and large insects. Nectar production per hummingbird
   territory (mean size c. 462 m(2)) was estimated as 68.6-104 mL d(-1) in
   dense areas at the flowering peak, an amount well above the estimated
   daily consumption of 13 mL by territory holders. Still, defence of large
   areas seems necessary to reduce nectar theft and cope with spatial
   resource unpredictability. Phenological characteristics, high density,
   and the fact that plants are perennial make S. glabra an attractive

Abstract = {{The bee tribe Ctenoplectrini, with two genera, comprises nine species in
   tropical Africa and ten in Asia and Australia. Most of them collect
   floral oil, pollen, and nectar from Cucurbitaceae, but three species are
   thought to be cleptoparasites. The unusual morphology of Ctenoplectrini
   has made it difficult to infer their closest relatives, in turn
   preventing an understanding of these bees' geographic and temporal
   origin. We used two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers (4741
   nucleotides) generated for most of the species to test the monophyly of
   the tribe, its relationships to other Apidae, and its biogeographic
   history. Ctenoplectrini are strongly supported as monophyletic and
   closest to the Long-horned bees, Eucerini. The presumably
   cleptoparasitic species form a clade (Ctenoplectrina) that is sister to
   the remaining species (Ctenoplectra), confirming the independent
   evolution of cleptoparasitism in this tribe. Tree topology and molecular
   dating together suggest that Ctenoplectrini originated in Africa in the
   Early Eocene and that Ctenoplectra dispersed twice from Africa to Asia,
   sometime in the Late Eocene, 30-40 my ago, from where one species
   reached the Australian continent via Indonesia and New Guinea in the
   mid-Miocene, c. 13 my ago. Dry and cool mid-Miocene climates also
   coincide with the divergence between Ctenoplectra bequaerti from West
   Africa and Ctenoplectra terminalis from East and South Africa, perhaps
   related to fragmentation of the equatorial African rainforest belt. (c)

Abstract = {{Ninety-five nests of Centris (Heterocentris) terminata Smith were
   collected in trapnests, during November/ 2001 and January/ 2003, at two
   fragments (PZGV e CFO-UFBA) of secondary Atlantic Forest, in Salvador,
   Bahia State (13 degrees 01' W e 38 degrees 30' S). The highest nest
   frequencies occurred from December to February (summer), with no nests
   foundations from August to October (winter - early spring). Two-hundred
   eight adults emerged from 347 brood cells, being 164 males and 116
   females (1: 0.42). During the study period sex ratio was male biased
   (chi(2) = 9.342; gl = 10; P < 0.05). C. terminata nested in holes with
   diameters 6, 8, 10 mm, but 84,2\% were constructed in 8 and 10 mm. nests
   had one to seven cells arranged in a linear series with the cell's
   partitions built with a mixture of sand and resin or oil. Male is
   significantly smaller than female, which emerges from the first cells
   constructed. Immature mortality occurred in 14.1\% of brood cells (n =
   49), of which 13.0\% were due fail in development and 1.2\% due to
   parasitism of Coelioxys sp. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) e Tetraonyx sp.
   (Coleoptera: Meloidae). In the study site, weather, mainly pluviosity,
   rather than natural enemies influenced seasonal population abundance.
   The long period of nesting activity, local abundance and usage of trap
   nests, suggest the potential of C. terminata for management aiming at
   pollination of native and cultivated plants.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{156}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{325-332}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator importance, the product of visitation rate and pollinator
   effectiveness, is a descriptive parameter of the ecology and evolution
   of plant-pollinator interactions. Naturally, sources of its variation
   should be investigated, but the SE of pollinator importance has never
   been properly reported. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation study and a
   result from mathematical statistics on the variance of the product of
   two random variables are used to estimate the mean and confidence limits
   of pollinator importance for three visitor species of the wildflower,
   Silene caroliniana. Both methods provided similar estimates of mean
   pollinator importance and its interval if the sample size of the
   visitation and effectiveness datasets were comparatively large. These
   approaches allowed us to determine that bumblebee importance was
   significantly greater than clearwing hawkmoth, which was significantly
   greater than beefly. The methods could be used to statistically quantify
   temporal and spatial variation in pollinator importance of particular
   visitor species. The approaches may be extended for estimating the
   variance of more than two random variables. However, unless the
   distribution function of the resulting statistic is known, the
   simulation approach is preferable for calculating the parameter's
   confidence limits.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{156}},

Pages = {{341-350}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Pollen dispersal by pollinators is governed by the extent to which
   diverse effects on pollinator behaviour act independently or augment or
   moderate each other. Using artificial inflorescences, we assessed the
   behavioural responses of bumble bees to inflorescence architecture
   (raceme, panicle, and umbel), inflorescence size (7 or 13 flowers),
   inter-inflorescence distance and the proportion of empty flowers per
   inflorescence. The advantage of large inflorescences in terms of
   attractiveness was larger for racemes and umbels than for panicles,
   whereas the effect of inter-inflorescence distance on the number of
   successive probes was smaller for racemes than for panicles and umbels.
   The number of flowers probed per visit increased almost proportionally
   with display size when fewer flowers were empty, whereas the number
   increased less when many flowers were empty. Our results suggest that
   display size and the spatial arrangement of flowers and nectar within
   inflorescences can contribute to efficient pollination by affecting
   pollinator behaviour interactively.}},
