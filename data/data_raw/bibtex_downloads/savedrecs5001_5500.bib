Abstract = {{The fungus Fusarium semitectum infects the flowering heads of Rudbeckia
   auriculata at two sites in Alabama. This is the first report of a fungal
   agent infecting this globally rare species. The fungus produces
   orange-tinged or pinkish-white spores on the flower heads and renders
   infected flowers sterile. Fungal spores superficially resembled pollen
   and are picked up by the main pollinator, the composite specialist bee
   Andrena aliciae, which serves as a dispersal agent for the fungal
   pathogen. Fungal spores were found attached in higher ratios in those
   areas of the bee's body that come into most direct contact with the
   flowering heads during feeding. The rate of spread of the fungus on
   potted plants indicated significant negative correlations between number
   of infections and the distance from the fungal source. Fusarium colonies
   were isolated from the entire length of flowering stems, and apparently
   invade vegetative portions of the plants. As R. auriculata is a
   perennial plant that reproduces almost exclusively by the production of
   short stolons, the fungus poses no serious threat to its immediate
   existence.}},

Abstract = {{A phylogenetic analysis of molecular (ITS, trnL-F trnK including the
   matK coding region) and morphological data is presented for the
   pantropical monocot family Costaceae (Zingiberales), including 65
   Costaceae taxa and two species of the outgroup genus Siphonochilus
   (Zingiberaceae). Taxon sampling included all four currently described
   genera in order to test the monophyly of previously proposed taxonomic
   groups. Sampling was further designed to encompass geographical and
   morphological diversity of the family to identify trends in
   biogeographic patterns and morphological character evolution.
   Phylogenetic analysis of the combined data reveals three major clades
   with discrete biogeographic distribution: (1) South American, (2) Asian,
   and (3) African-neotropical. The nominal genus Costus is not
   monophyletic and its species are found in all three major clades. The
   Melanesian genus Tapeinochilos is monophyletic and included within the
   Asian clade. Monocostus and Dimerocostus are sister taxa and form part
   of the South American clade. The African-neotropical clade is composed
   entirely of the genus Costus; moreover, there is support for previously
   recognized subgeneric groupings within the Costus clade. Evolutionary
   trends in floral morphology show that close associations with
   pollinators have evolved several times from an ancestral generalist
   pollinator floral form. Bee pollination has evolved once in the family,
   arising in Africa from an open-flowered (generalist) ancestor. Bird
   pollination has evolved multiple times: once from an open-flowered
   ancestor in Southeast Asia and multiple times from a bee-pollinated
   ancestor in the neotropics. Additional morphological characters not
   traditionally used to define taxonomic groups, but having high
   consistency in the current phylogenetic analysis, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{No qualitative cladistic analysis has been performed previously for the

   proposed six subfamilies, but their validity and relationships remain
   inconclusive. The objective of this study was to perform a quantitative
   analysis of phylogenetic relationships of the Pompilidae, with emphasis
   on testing the validity of proposed subfamilies. Two cladistic analyses
   were performed based on morphological evidence. First, a
   maximum-parsimony analysis of Shimizu's original morphological data
   matrix (72 taxa by 54 characters) was conducted, with the data subjected
   to a heuristic search for the first time with phylogenetic software. The
   resulting strict-consensus cladogram yielded a monophyletic Ceropalinae
   that was sister group to a large polytomy containing members of the
   remaining five subfamilies. In a second analysis, several of Shimizu's
   characters were re-examined, and new characters and more taxa were added
   to the data set. Terminal taxa were coded as species rather than as
   generic abstractions, and 20 additional morphological characters were
   introduced. The analysis was based on 77 morphological characters
   derived from the adults of 84 taxa. This second analysis suggested that
   Notocyphinae sensu Shimizu (1994) was nested within Pompilinae and that
   Epipompilinae sensu Shimizu (1994) was nested within Ctenocerinae;
   neither should retain their status as a separate subfamily. Lastly,
   Chirodamus s.s., which historically has been a member of the Pepsinae,
   is placed within the Pompilinae with reservations rather than erecting a
   new subfamily. After these allowances were made, a strict consensus tree
   gave the following relationships: (Ceropalinae + (Pepsinae +
   (Ctenocerinae + Pompilinae))).}},

Abstract = {{We examined the levels of pollen-host specificity in North American
   Diadasia (Hymenoptera: Apoidea), a clade of specialist bees. We analysed
   the scopal pollen loads of 409 individuals representing 25 of the 30
   species of Diadasia that occur in North America. Each Diadasia species
   showed a preference for one of five plant families. However, the 25
   species varied in their level of host specificity: the average
   percentage by volume of the preferred host in pollen loads ranged from >
   99\% to < 75\%. In 17 of the 25 species, all or most individuals
   examined contained pure loads of one host taxon, while in eight species
   individuals were less specialized and carried mixtures of several
   unrelated host taxa. Mapping these host preferences onto a phylogenetic
   tree indicated that Malvaceae is the most likely ancestral host for the
   genus, and use of other hosts can be explained by a single switch to
   each of the other four host-plant families. Thus, most speciation events
   were not associated with a host switch; this pattern does not support
   host switching as a niche partitioning strategy to avoid competition.
   Diadasia species are more likely to use host-plant families that are
   used by other Diadasia and Emphorine bees; however, there was no
   evidence of residual adaptation to ancestral hosts. Diet breadth appears
   to be a labile trait: transitions from narrower to broader host use, as
   well as vice versa, were observed. The observed patterns of host-use
   evolution may be driven, in part, by host morphology and/or chemistry.

Abstract = {{Oligolectic bees are specialists that collect pollen from one or a few
   closely related species of plants, while polylectic bees are generalists
   that collect pollen from both related and unrelated species of plants.
   Because of their more restricted range of floral hosts, it is expected
   that specialists persist in more isolated populations than do
   generalists. We present data on the population structure of two closely
   related bee species sampled from a super abundant floral host in the
   southern Atacama Desert. Pairwise comparisons of population subdivision
   over identical distances revealed that the specialist bee had
   significantly more differentiated populations in comparison to the
   generalist. Further, populations of the specialist had significantly
   less genetic variation, measured as observed and expected
   heterozgyosity, than those of the generalist. Our data support the
   hypothesis of decreased gene flow among populations of the specialist
   bee even at equivalent geographic distances. The resulting reductions in
   effective population size for specialists make them particularly prone
   to extinction due to both demographic and genetic reasons. Our findings
   have important implications for the conservation of bees and other

Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators may choose which flowers to visit by direct assessment of
   rewards or by indirect assessment of ``honest{''} advertisements or
   other traits correlated with the quantity or quality of reward. We
   wished to know whether selection generated by pollinators acted directly
   or indirectly on floral rewards, on advertisement traits, and/or traits
   affecting pollinator efficiency (their fit with flowers) in Dalechampia
   vines (Euphorbiaceae) and whether the advertisement (bract size) was
   correlated honestly with reward amount (measured by resin-gland area).
   In Gabon we studied bee visitation and pollen arrival rates to blossoms
   of D. ipomoefolia Benth. and found that, despite the apparent visibility
   of the resin reward (and its volume), the strongest bee-mediated natural
   selection acted directly on bract size rather than gland area. Blossoms
   with larger bracts were visited more often by the only pollinators,
   female Heriades nr. spiniscutis (Apoidea: Megachilidae), and these
   blossoms received more pollen on their stigmas. Blossoms with larger
   resin glands were also visited more often and received more pollen
   overall, but this effect disappeared when bract size (which was
   phenotypically correlated with gland size) was controlled for
   statistically. These observational data were confirmed by experimental
   reduction of bract size, which significantly decreased pollen arrival
   rates. Thus, the bees appear to rely on the ``honest'' correlation
   between advertisement and reward in choosing the best blossoms to visit,
   and this behavior generates direct selection for larger bracts and
   indirect selection for larger resin glands. Bees visiting blossoms with
   larger separation between the gland and stigmas contacted the stigmas
   less frequently, and such blossoms received less pollen on their
   stigmas. Because gland area, bract size, and gland-stigma separation are
   positively correlated phenotypically, response to selection for larger
   bracts may be limited in this population by conflicting selection
   against large gland-stigma separation.}},

Abstract = {{Blueberry species (Vaccinium section Cyanococcus) benefit from
   cross-pollination. Outcrossing increases fruit set, berry size, and
   ripening rate. Although knowledge of pollen dispersal is essential for
   maximizing cross-pollination and achieving optimal planting designs,
   this process has not been quantified previously in blueberry plantings.
   A novel method was developed to estimate the proportion of self- and
   cross-pollen transported by blueberry pollinators. The proposed
   technique requires a consistent difference in pollen size between two
   cultivars; to predict the composition of a pollen mixture based on
   frequency distributions of pollen diameter. Vaccinium ashei Reade
   `Brightwell' and `Climax' were chosen for this study because they
   produce pollen tetrads of different size. Tetrad diameter and number
   were analyzed with a particle counter. The technique was validated by
   predicting the proportion of `Brightwell' in pollen mixtures where the
   cultivar composition was known, and predicted and actual values were
   linearly correlated (r = 0.995, P < 0.0001). The technique was then
   applied to pollen samples extracted from the bodies of pollinators that
   were collected in a mixed `Brightwell' and `Climax' blueberry plot.
   Numbers of blueberry tetrads extracted per bumblebee (Bombus spp.)
   averaged 4595 and 797 in 2003 and 2004, respectively, which was
   considered adequate to make accurate predictions based on frequency
   distributions of tetrad diameter. The proportion of `Brightwell' pollen
   carried by bumblebees changed with the phenology of the crop following
   an expected pattern, indicating that the method performed well under
   field conditions. This technique could potentially be used to quantify
   the likelihood for outcrossing and establish the effect of cultivar

Abstract = {{Rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei Reade) is a bee-potlinated small
   fruit crop that often exhibits poor fruit set. Mixed cultivar plantings
   are recommended because cross-pollination is required for optimum
   yields, and bees are expected to transfer pollen from one cultivar to
   another. The objective of this study was to assess transport of
   cross-pollen by bumblebees in a rabbiteye blueberry planting.
   Experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 in a plot composed of
   `Brightwell' and `Climax' plants arranged in alternating rows. The
   proportion of `Brightwell' and `Climax' pollen carried on the bodies of
   bumblebees was estimated based on frequency distributions of pollen
   diameter, measured with a particle counter. About 75\% of bumblebees
   collected in 2003 carried < 20\% cross-pollen. Proportions of
   cross-pollen in 2004 were higher than in 2003, but still, about 85\% of
   bumblebees collected carried < 40\% cross-pollen. The proportion of
   cross-pollen carried by bumblebees changed during the flowering season.
   The greatest likelihood for cross-pollination occurred during the time
   of maximum bloom overlap, although the median proportion of cross-pollen
   was not > 30\% on any sampling day of 2004. The results from this study
   emphasize the need to select more self-fertile rabbiteye blueberry
   cultivars and to maximize bloom overlap in blueberry plantings.}},

Abstract = {{The role of secondary compounds (SC) in deterring herbivores and
   pathogens from vegetative parts of plants is well established, whereas
   their role in plant reproductive organs such as floral nectar is
   unclear. The present study aimed to reveal the response of free-flying

   nectar. We selected nicotine, anabasine, caffeine, and amygdalin, all of
   which are found in nectar of various plants. In repeated paired-choice
   experiments, we offered 20\% sucrose solution as control along with test
   solutions of 20\% sucrose with various concentrations of the above SC.
   Except for anabasine, naturally occurring concentrations of SC did not
   have a deterring effect. Furthermore, low concentrations of nicotine and
   caffeine elicited a significant feeding preference. SC can, therefore,
   be regarded as postingestive stimulants to pollinators, indicating that
   the psychoactive alkaloids in nectar may be a part of their mutualistic
   reward. Further studies are needed to test our hypothesis that
   psychoactive alkaloids in nectar impose dependence or addiction effects
   on pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The solitary bee Osmia lignaria Say continues to be developed as an
   orchard pollinator in the United States and southern Canada. Female bees
   are active during the early spring and construct nests consisting of a
   linear series of unlined cells delimited by mud partitions. Cells are
   provisioned with a pollen/nectar mass on which an egg is deposited, and
   nests are sealed with a mud plug. In 1997, we initiated two experiments
   on the development, mortality, and emergence of O. lignaria at selected
   laboratory temperature regimes and outdoors. In the first experiment
   (published previously), we compared temperature treatments for their
   adequacy in maintaining healthy O. lignaria populations. In a second
   experiment (reported here), we determined the relationship between
   rearing temperatures and prepupa-adult development rates as well as
   emergence time and longevity after wintering and incubation the
   following spring. We observed important differences in O. lignaria
   prepupa versus pupa responses to selected temperature treatments. The
   relationship between temperature and days to pupa was U-shaped, with
   additional time to transit the prepupa-pupa interval at temperatures
   above and below 26 degrees C. The negative relationship between
   temperature and the length of the pupa to adult interval contrasts with
   the U-shaped thermal response observed for prepupae. Thus, with each
   increase in thermal beat units over the range of temperature treatments
   tested, we observed an additional reduction in the pupa-adult interval.
   Individuals reared at constant 18 degrees C required 2.4 times as many
   days to transit the pupa-adult interval compared with those at constant
   32 degrees C. Our results suggest that there is a need for the
   development of regionally adapted, latitude-specific breeding
   populations of this outstanding orchard crop pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of elevated CO2 and nutrient availability on nectar production
   and onset of flowering in five different seed families (genotypes) of

   Elevated CO2 significantly increased nectar production per day (+51\%, p

   concentration (+65\%,p < 0.05) and total amino acids per flower(+
   192\%,p < 0.001). All other parameters tested, i.e., nectar sugar
   concentration, proportion of glucose/fructose and proportion of
   sucrose/(glucose + fructose), were not significantly affected by
   elevated CO2 and/or fertilization. However, elevated CO2 caused a
   marginally significant trend for earlier flowering in highly fertilized
   plants. No significant family x CO2 interaction was found in any of the
   tested parameters, but the response in nectar production varied
   considerably among seed families (+ 10 to + 104\%) and was significantly
   positive in two of the five seed families investigated. Our results are
   not consistent with earlier studies on effects of elevated CO2 on nectar
   production and flowering phenology in other plant species. It seems, on
   the other hand, that CO2 effects on nectar production are specific to
   species and genotype. Hence, no general conclusions about effects of
   elevated CO2 on these floral traits can be drawn at present. but it must
   be cautioned that elevated CO2 might not only increase floral rewards as

Abstract = {{A critical issue in pollination ecology is the evolution of generalist

   generalist and specialist flower-visitors. The present study tested
   pollinator effectiveness and pollinator importance of the pollen
   specialist solitary bee Andrena hattorfiana (Andrenidae) vs. the
   generalist flower-visitors to K. arvensis on the island of Oland, SE
   Sweden. Females of the specialist bee removed more pollen per
   inflorescence-visit than the major groups of generalist visitors such as
   bumblebees and flies. They also deposited more pollen per
   inflorescence-visit than any of the generalist visitor groups. The
   females have a preference for pollen-presenting vs. stigma-presenting
   inflorescences, a pattern shared with most of the generalist
   flower-visitors. Females of the specialist exert such a strong
   preference that they, despite their great pollinator effectiveness, make
   modest contribution to pollen transfer in K. arvensis. The females of A.
   hattorfiana accounted for 14.2\% of the overall visits and 5.8\% of the
   total pollination, the rest being performed by generalist visitors and

Abstract = {{In this paper we presented a review of the advances in the studies of
   breeding system and pollination biology of gingers. The Zingiberaceae is
   a large family of animal-pollinated pantropical monocotyledons with more
   than 1500 species in ca. 50 genera. There are many kinds of sexual
   variations occurring in the ginger family, such as gynodioecy,
   andromonoecy, flexistyly, protandry and self-incompatibility. Major
   pollinators include bees, hawkmoth, butterfly and birds, and different
   pollinators correspond with different morphological characteristics of
   flowers. Among the relatively few studies on the pollination biology,
   members of this family display some unique pollination mechanisms and
   breeding systems. Flexistyly, found in the genera of Amomum and Alpinia,
   is regarded as a unique behaviour mechanism that encourages outcrossing;
   a new self-pollination mechanism has been discovered in Caulokoempferia

Abstract = {{A new kind of stylar polymorphism, provisionally called inversostyly, is
   described. The polymorphism occurs in Hemimeris racemosa
   (Scrophulariaceae), a common annual herb of the Cape region of South
   Africa. Most populations are dimorphic for style orientation: the style
   alternates with the two stamens and is deflected either upwards or
   downwards. Thus, there is reciprocal placement of the style and stamens
   in a vertical plane in zygomorphic flowers. The flowers are symmetrical,
   and the floral parts do not vary in length. All flowers on a given plant
   are of the same stylar orientation. Pollination is by specialized
   oil-collecting bees (Rediviva spp.), which carry the pollen of the two
   morphs separately in discrete anterior or posterior locations on the
   underside of the body. Most inversostylous populations have a slightly
   higher proportion of the style-down morph, and this bias increases with
   decreasing pollinator abundance. In contrast with inversostylous
   populations, all individuals in homostylous populations of H. racemosa
   have the style and the stamens clustered together in the down position
   and high levels of autogamous seed set. Homostylous populations of H.
   racemosa, as well as the homostylous species Hemimeris sabulosa, occur
   where oil-collecting bees are less abundant.}},

   scenario for the diversification of Costus, in which rapid floral
   adaptation in geographic isolation and range shifts in response to

Abstract = {{In considerations of sexual floral size dimorphism, there is a conflict
   between sexual selection theory, which predicts that larger floral

   the ideal free distribution-which predict that pollinators' visits

   flowers before visiting smaller female flowers, thereby promoting
   effective pollination. To investigate optimality predictions, I offered
   pollinators a choice between smaller, less numerous, but more rewarding
   flowers; and larger, more numerous, but less rewarding flowers. Foragers
   initially favored the larger and more numerous flowers, but rapidly
   shifted preferences to conform with the predictions of the ideal free
   distribution. To test Muller's hypothesis, I offered pollinators choices
   between larger and smaller corollas of equal caloric reward. Results
   showed that although pollinators tended to visit larger corollas first,
   they did not visit them more often. These experiments highlight the need

   morphological study was conducted. Furthermore, the evolution of eight
   vegetative and floral characters is explored and explained in relation
   to pollination syndrome. Three most parsimonious trees were retrieved
   from heuristic searches. Govenia is corroborated as monophyletic with
   six recognized groups: three monotypic groups (G.aciliilabia, G.
   powellii, and G. boliviensis) and three major clades (Purpusii,
   Capitata, and Superba groups). The Purpusii group is characterized by a
   well-developed rhizome, a solitary leaf, and 3-12 white flowers. The
   Capitata group is characterized by the lack of a rhizome, two leaves,
   and 10-30 white flowers. The Superba group is characterized by the lack

   identified in Govenia. The first trend is represented by plants with a
   rhizome and reduced leaf and flower numbers that occur in taxa from the

   length and the number of flowers, to change flower colour from white to
   yellow with an ascending position of the column, and is represented in

   the hypothesis that there was a shift in pollinator from small

Abstract = {{Knowledge about plant-plant interactions for pollinator service at the
   plant community level is still scarce, although such interactions may be
   important to seed production and hence the population dynamics of
   individual plant species and the species compositions of communities. An
   important step towards a better understanding of pollination
   interactions at the community level is to assess if the variation in
   floral traits among plant species explain the variation in flower
   visitation frequency among those species. We investigated the relative
   importance of various floral traits for the visitation frequency of all
   insects, and bumblebees and flies separately, to plant species by
   measuring the visitation frequency to all insect-pollinated species in a
   community during an entire flowering season. Visitation frequency was
   identified to be strongly positive related to the visual display area
   and the date of peak flowering of plant species. Categorical variables,
   such as flower form and symmetry, were important to the visitation
   frequency of flies only. We constructed floral similarity measures based
   on the species' floral traits and found that the floral similarity for
   all species' traits combined and the continuous traits separately were
   positively related to individual visitation frequency. On the other
   hand, plant species with similar categorical floral traits did not have
   similar visitation frequencies. In conclusion, our results show that
   continuous traits, such as flower size and/or density, are more
   important for the variation in visitation frequency among plant species
   than thought earlier. Furthermore, differences in visitation frequency
   among pollinator groups give a poor support to the expectations derived

   We used long-term population and weather data to parameterize models of
   flowering based on stored resources and pollen limitation in Astragalus
   scaphoides, a bee-pollinated plant that flowers in alternate years. We
   used these models to test whether internal resource dynamics could
   explain mast seeding in A. scaphoides and, if so, whether synchrony was

   compared predictions of models that included all combinations of three
   factors: constant versus precipitation-dependent resource gain, uniform
   versus heterogeneous resource gain (among individual plants), and
   resource-dependent versus resource- and pollen-limited fruit set. Pollen
   limitation and heterogeneous resource gain were necessary and sufficient
   to explain alternate-year flowering, but precipitation increased the
   quantitative match between model predictions and flowering dynamics.
   Together, our results support the importance of density-dependent pollen
   limitation as an ultimate and proximate cause of mast seeding in A.

Abstract = {{The rattleweed Crotalarta retusa was introduced in Brazil from Africa,

   behavior to explain its reproductive success. We performed manual
   pollination and germination experiments, and monitored the behavior of C
   retusa's main pollinators in monospecific plots, and in mixed plots
   where C retusa occurred together with two congeners, Crotalaria pallida
   and Crotalaria lanceolata. Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and
   capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the
   level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited
   the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter
   bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together,
   accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on
   C retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter
   flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per
   inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover,
   but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it
   visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The
   different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages
   represented by pollen overlap on X grisescens' body, may partially
   explain the much lower seed germination observed in C pallida and C
   lanceolata. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a
   reduction in flower constancy may significantly depress viable seed set

   Observation and experiments were carried out in Northeastern Brazil.
   Thirty-three species of the visitor were recorded. Hawkmoths

   (Nymphalidae and Hesperiidae) with long mouth parts were effective
   pollinators of H. speciosa. Access to nectar, the only reward for flower

   diameters and dried mouth parts from a number of flower visitors were
   used in experiments to simulate flower visits. The number of pollen
   grains removed during such simulated visits showed no significant
   difference. Although xenogamic, H. speciosa presented a low pollen/ovule
   ratio (77). This might be related to the high efficiency of its

Abstract = {{Male orchid bees (Euglossini) are attracted to floral and non-floral
   odours, which they collect and accumulate in hind tibial cavities for
   subsequent exposure during courtship. Fragrance preferences are
   species-specific, leading to relatively specialised pollination of
   euglossophilous plants. We tested the hypothesis that preferences for
   attractive compounds have led to species-specific sensory adaptations
   that are measurable by electroantennography (EAG). All of 16 synthetic
   fragrance compounds elicited significant responses on male bee antennae,
   with some difference of response spectra between individuals of Euglossa
   spp. and bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) controls, but no difference
   between three different species of Euglossa. There was no correspondence
   between a compounds' attractiveness in baiting assays and the size of
   its electrophysiological response. Our results strengthen the view that
   fragrance preferences are largely mediated by processes in higher
   nervous centres. Peripheral sensory tuning to single attractive odorants
   may be constrained by the need to detect and discriminate between many
   fragrances, including many that have repellent effects on male bees.}},

Abstract = {{Caulokaempferia coenobialis ( Zingiberaceae) forms dense populations on
   steep cliffs in shady, humid monsoon forests in south China. It produces
   few consecutively opening bright yellow flowers that are 3 cm long and
   oriented parallel to the ground. Upon anther dehiscence at about 0600
   hours, each pollen sac releases a drop of pollen onto the horizontally
   oriented style, and the two drops then merge to form an oily film that
   slowly flows toward the stigma, carrying out self-pollination between
   about 1500 and 0730 hours the next day. The distance covered by the
   pollen film is ca. 3 mm. There is no significant difference in fruit set
   between experimentally cross- and self-pollinated flowers or between
   naturally pollinated and bagged flowers. The low pollen/ovule ratio of
   664 probably relates to the pollen grains being held together by
   pollen-connecting threads. The latter ensure that pollen grains always
   arrive as multiples, and this is the first report of such threads in the
   Zingiberaceae. During 35 h of observation at several locations and
   during three flowering periods, only three individual bees, five flies,
   and two butterflies visited single flowers. It remained unclear whether
   they affected pollination because no return visits were observed. The
   automatic selfing by pollen that reaches the stigma ca. 9 h after the
   onset of anthesis apparently constitutes a case of delayed selfing,
   providing reproductive reassurance in situations of low pollinator
   visitation.}},

Abstract = {{The vine cactus Selenicereus megalanthus, known as ``yellow pitaya{''},
   produces attractive tasty fruits and has considerable economic potential
   as a new exotic fruit crop. This study explored the effects of different

   14 clones of S. megalanthus. Hand-pollinated flowers set more viable

   effectiveness of spontaneous self-pollination or bee pollination was
   low. Similar fruit set and seed set were obtained for both hand
   self-pollinated and hand cross-pollinated flowers, indicating full
   self-compatibility of all tested clones. Our results indicate that, to
   obtain high quality and high yield, commercial growers should
   hand-pollinate flowers, possibly using self-pollen. An orchard of one of
   the clones examined here, could thus be planted with a single clone,

Abstract = {{Nectar robbers are often assumed to be plant antagonists; however,
   empirical data show that the impacts of these animals range from

   We experimentally evaluated the combined effects of nectar robbing and
   ant visitation on three indices of reproductive fitness in Linaria
   vulgaris in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, via indirect effects on
   flower- and seed-eating beetles (Brachypterolus pulicarius and
   Gymnaetron antirrhinni). Nectar robbing Bombus occidentalis leave holes
   in the nectar spurs, effectively creating ``extra-floral nectaries{''}
   that attract ants. In a paired-plant experiment, ants were significantly
   more abundant on robbed than on unrobbed plants. Manipulation of ant
   access and nectar robbing showed that ant exclusion increased beetle
   attack and decreased female fitness. There was a significant
   ant-by-robbing interaction on flower damage. Patterns in the other two
   indices were suggestive of ant-by-robbing interactions, but these were
   not statistically significant. We also found correlations between spider
   occupancy on some plants and the mean number of ants (marginally
   negative) or beetles (significantly positive). Although the effect we
   report in this study may be highly dependent on spatial and temporal
   distributions of several interacting species, we discuss its potential
   role in mitigating the costs of floral parasitism, and its importance to
   the study of nectar robbing in general.}},

Abstract = {{The non-rewarding flowers of Disa spathulata (L.f) Sw. have a highly
   elongated scent-producing lip that varies in size and form between the
   two subspecies of this orchid. We investigated whether this unusual
   morphology is associated with the evolution of a specialized scent-based
   pollination system. Field observations carried out in South Africa
   showed that flowers of D. spathulata are pollinated solely by bees
   belonging to the genus Tetraloniella (Anthophoridae). Flowers of D.
   spathulata subsp. spathulata were visited by Tetraloniella brevikeraia,
   while flowers of D. spathulata subsp. tripartita (Lindl.). H. P. Linder
   were visited by Tetraloniella junodi. The floral fragrance of D.
   spathulata is emitted by the lip blade and differs markedly between the
   two subspecies (only 24 {[}42.1] of the 57 compounds identified were
   shared). Fragrance of D. spathulata subsp spathulata is dominated by the
   fatty acid derivatives decyl actetate, octanol, and decanol, while that
   of D. spathulata subsp. tripartita is dominated by the terpenoids (E) -
   ocimene, caryophyllene, and (E) nerolidol. Both male and female
   Tetraloniella bees were strongly attracted to cut flowers of D.
   spathulata subsp spathulata, even at sites where the orchid does not
   naturally occur. Bees visit the orchids repeatedly despite the lack of
   rewards in their flowers. Sexual deception in D. spathulata can be
   excluded by the attraction of both male and female bees, and yet the
   manner in which bees are attracted seems too intense and
   species-specific to be characterized as food-deception. This implies the
   existence in D. spathulata of a system of scent-based deception of
   insects that has not been described previously in plants.}},

   moth Manduca sexta. Hawk moth pollinated P. axillaris releases high
   levels of several compounds compared to the bee-pollinated P.
   integrifolia that releases benzaldehyde almost exclusively. The three
   dominating compounds in P. axillaris were benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol
   and methyl benzoate. In P. axillaris, benzenoids showed a circadian
   rhythm with an emission peak at night, which was absent from P.
   integrifolia. These characters were highly conserved among different P.
   axillaris subspecies and P. axillaris accessions, with some differences
   in fragrance composition. Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings using
   flower-blends of different wild Petunia species on female M. sexta
   antennae showed that P. axillaris odours elicited stronger responses

   responses to odour-samples collected from P. axillaris flowers confirmed
   that odours collected at night evoked stronger responses from M. sexta

   odour emissions by P. axillaris is in tune with nocturnal hawk moth

   24-h periods during peak flowering. A diverse array of visitors was
   documented, including members of the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera,
   Hymenoptera, and Coleoptera. Although Phlox is generally considered to
   exhibit a lepidopteran pollination syndrome, all of these species
   experienced some visitation from non-lepidopterans. Phlox superba and P.
   grayi received greatest visitation from a hawkmoth (Hyles lineata), and
   P dolichantha and P. stansburyi received the most visits from small
   flies (Anthomyia and Tachypeza, respectively). All Phlox species were

   We report the first evidence of bat visitation in the subgenus Littaea

   Glossophaga sp.) are the primary pollinators in four species. Honeybees,
   hummingbirds, bumblebees and hawkmoths were also common visitors. We
   propose that the presence of diurnal pollinators may increase the
   reproductive success of the plant when offering pollinator services
   additional to the coadapted pollinator. We also found evidence of
   selection pressures toward semelparity because pollinators are selecting
   for taller inflorescences in three of the five species. There is
   phenological complementarity in this community because the flowering
   periods of the five species span the entire year, although there are
   some periods when pairs of species overlap. Additionally, we found

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Although it was generally assumed that Maxillaria
   spp. do not produce nectar, in recent years, nectar has been reported
   for a number of these orchids. Nevertheless, our current understanding
   of nectary structure and nectar secretion in Maxillaria is based solely
   on M. coccinea (Jacq.) L. O. Williams ex Hodge, which, since it shows
   many features characteristic of ornithophilous flowers, is atypical of
   this largely entomophilous genus. The aim of the present paper is to
   describe, for the first time, nectar secretion in a presumed
   entomophilous species of Maxillaria.
   Methods The structure of the nectary of M. anceps Ames \& C. Schweinf.,
   nectar composition and the process of nectar secretion were investigated
   using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy, histochemistry, refractometry and high performance
   liquid chromatography.
   Key Results and Conclusions Nectar appears as droplets that are exuded
   by modified stomata borne upon the labellar callus and collects upon the
   labellum and at the base of the column-foot. Although such stomata are
   known to occur in a number of angiosperm families, this is the first
   time for them to be observed in orchids. The callus consists largely of
   parenchyma with raphides and is supplied by eight to ten collateral
   bundles. This tissue, together with the single-layered epidermis,
   seemingly contains terpenoids. During the bud stage, the callus cells
   contain an organelle complement consistent with secretory cells whereas
   by day 4 of anthesis, much of the cell is occupied by a vacuole. The
   nectar is sucrose- dominant but also contains low concentrations of
   glucose, fructose, free amino acids and possibly terpenoids. The high
   sugar concentration (approx. 66 \%) is consistent with melittophily and
   may indicate that, like the majority of Maxillaria spp., M. anceps is
   visited by stingless bees ( Meliponini).}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims In plant populations the magnitude of spatial
   genetic structure of apparent individuals ( including clonal ramets) can
   be different from that of sexual individuals (genets). Thus,
   distinguishing the effects of clonal versus sexual individuals in
   population genetic analyses could provide important insights for
   evolutionary biology and conservation. To investigate the effects of
   clonal spread on the fine-scale spatial genetic structure within plant
   populations, Hosta jonesii (Liliaceae), an endemic species to Korea, was
   chosen as a study species.
   Methods Using allozymes as genetic markers, spatial autocorrelation
   analysis of ramets and of genets was Key
   Results Join- count statistics revealed that most clones are
   significantly aggregated at < 3- m interplant distance. Spatial
   autocorrelation analysis of all individuals resulted in significantly
   higher Moran's I values at 0-3- m interplant distance than analyses of
   population samples in which clones were excluded. However, significant
   fine-scale genetic structure was still observed when clones were
   excluded.
   Conclusions These results suggest that clones enhance the magnitude of
   spatial autocorrelation due to localized clonal spread. The significant
   fine-scale genetic structure detected in samples excluding clones is
   consistent with the biological and ecological traits exhibited by H.
   jonesii including bee pollination and limited seed dispersal. For
   conservation purposes, genetic diversity would be maximized in local
   populations of H. jonesii by collecting or preserving individuals that
   are spaced at least 5 m apart.}},

   and blue artificial flowers, we measured the foraging rate (flowers
   visited per minute, flower handling time, and flight time between
   flowers) and flower constancy (tendency to sequentially visit flowers of
   the same type) of bees with varying intensities of infection. Bumble bee
   workers infected with tracheal mites foraged as rapidly as uninfected
   workers, but were considerably more constant to a single flower type
   (yellow or blue). In contrast, workers infected with intestinal protozoa
   showed similar levels of flower constancy, but visited 12\% fewer
   flowers per minute on average than uninfected bees. By altering the
   foraging behavior of bees, such parasites may influence interactions
   between plants and pollinators, as well as the reproductive output of
   bumble bee colonies. Our study is the first to investigate the effects
   of parasitic protozoa and tracheal mites on the foraging behavior of
   bumble bees, and provides the first report of Crithidia bombi in
   commercial bumble bees in North America.}},

Abstract = {{1. Adaptive floral divergence may evolve in plants that are generalized
   for pollination when geographic variation in pollinator assemblages
   produces a mosaic of phenotypic optima. Within a Dudleya species
   complex, I estimated the relationship between pollination success and
   floral phenotype at four sites, and asked whether this relationship
   depended on the composition of the pollinator assemblage.
   2. Flowers were visited by hummingbirds and insects (primarily bees),
   and the frequency of visitors varied among sites and between years. In
   2000, pollination success did not depend on floral phenotype, but in
   2001 visitation by hummingbirds increased, and flowers that were longer,
   produced more nectar, and had more inserted stigmas received more
   pollen.
   3. An independent experiment with hummingbirds confirmed a positive
   relationship between pollination success and these floral traits, which
   was due in part to a hummingbird visitation preference for longer, more
   rewarding flowers.
   4. The absence of a trade-off in obtaining service from insects vs birds
   suggests that variation in pollination environment will not promote
   floral divergence in Dudleya. However, if longer, more rewarding flowers
   incur metabolic costs, then the difference between insects and birds as
   agents of selection on floral function may be sufficient to generate
   trade-offs in total fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Resolving the controversy over the prevalence of generalization in
   plant-pollinator interactions requires field studies characterizing the
   pollination effectiveness of all a plant's floral visitors. Herein, the
   pollination effectiveness of all visitors to two species of barrel
   cactus (Ferocactus) was quantified.
   2. Flowers of both species were pollinated almost exclusively by
   cactus-specialist bees: 99\% (F. cylindraceus (Engelm.) Orcutt) and 94\%
   (F. wislizeni (Engelm.) Britt. and Rose) of all seeds produced in this
   study resulted from cactus bee visits.
   3. For F. cylindraceus, the cactus-specialist Diadasia rinconis was the
   most abundant visitor. For F. wislizeni, three cactus-specialists
   (including D. rinconis) plus generalists in the family Halictidae (which
   did not act as pollinators) each accounted for a quarter of all visits.
   4. Diadasia rinconis visits to F. wislizeni flowers were more effective
   (per-visit) than visits by the other two cactus-specialists.
   5. Pollen-collecting and nectar-collecting visits were equally
   effective. Nectar-collecting visits were the most abundant.
   6. Apart from the non-pollinating halictids, floral visitors
   surprisingly did not include commonly co-occurring generalist bees.
   7. These data suggest that, just as apparently specialized flowers may
   be visited by a diverse assemblage of generalists, so apparently
   generalized flowers may be visited predominantly by specialists, and
   that these specialists may perform virtually all of the pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Apple (Malus domestica) has a gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI)
   system. Consequently, fertilization is achieved by cross-pollination
   with a compatible pollinator. Compatibility is governed by a
   multiallelic S locus. Cultivars are fully compatible when both of their
   S-loci differ and are semi compatible when one locus is identical and
   the other differs. In a previous study we found that the fruit set and
   yield of the apple cultivar `Topred' was reduced when it was pollinated
   by a semi compatible cultivar. To examine if this occurrence is a
   general feature in apples grown under suboptimal conditions, three
   additional cultivars, `Golden Delicious', `Granny Smith' and `Royal
   Gala', were studied as pollen recipients of semi and fully compatible
   pollinators. Based on PCR analysis of the S-RNase allele, it was
   determined that the pollination rate of the semi compatible was
   significantly lower than that of the fully compatible pollinator in all
   cases. This was reflected by the lower fruit set and seed set of `Golden
   Delicious' and `Royal Gala', but not of `Granny Smith'. In hand
   pollination experiments, where pollen was in excess, no difference was
   found between the semi and fully compatible pollinators in all three
   cases. These results indicate that the low yield, conferred by semi
   compatible pollinators, is due to insufficient cross-pollination (and
   not to cultivar characteristics). Thus, low yields due to semi
   compatibility may be avoided by appropriate honeybee management that
   will increase pollination. Still, under suboptimal conditions, for
   growth and pollination, full compatibility is preferable.}},

Abstract = {{Male Colletes cunicularius bees pollinate the orchid, Ophrys exaltata,

   identification of the target compounds by coupled gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we performed behavioral tests
   using synthetic blends of the active components. We detected 22 EAD
   active compounds in cuticular extracts of C. cunicularius females.
   Blends of straight chain, odd-numbered alkanes and (Z)-7-alkenes with
   21-29 carbon atoms constituted the major biologically active compounds.
   Alkenes were the key compounds releasing mating behavior, especially
   those with (Z)-7 unsaturation. Comparison of patterns of bee volatiles
   with those of O. exaltata subsp. archipelagi revealed that all
   EAD-active compounds were also found in extracts of orchid labella.
   Previous studies of the mating behavior in C. cunicularius showed
   linalool to be an important attractant for patrolling males. We
   confirmed this with synthetic linalool but found that it rarely elicited
   copulatory behavior, in accordance with previous studies. A blend of
   active cuticular compounds with linalool elicited both attraction and
   copulation behavior in patrolling males. Thus, linalool appears to
   function as a long-range attractant, whereas cuticular hydrocarbons are
   necessary for inducing short-range mating behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.), is a solitary,
   cavity-nesting bee that has been managed in large numbers to pollinate
   alfalfa, Medicago spp., seed crops since the 1960s. Propagation of these

   United States, attempts to control the disease have been fairly
   unsuccessful, but include removing nests from the nesting boards and
   then disinfecting the boards with heat treatments or a fumigant. The
   problem is that many boards are made of polystyrene (so heat cannot be
   used), and very few fumigants are registered for this use. In this
   study, ozone was tested as a fumigant and compared with heat treatments
   and methyl bromide fumigation. Ozone was found to be inadequate for
   killing A. aggregata spores and for reducing chalkbrood levels in the
   field. Methyl bromide and heat treatments did greatly reduce spore
   viability in the boards, but did not reduce chalkbrood levels in the
   field. Surprisingly, larvae in new nesting boards (boards free of

   be necessary for controlling chalkbrood, but the results reported here

Abstract = {{Small beetles, usually species of Nitidulidae, are the natural

   custard apple) flowers but commercial atemoya growers often need to
   carry out labor-intensive hand pollination to produce enough
   high-quality fruit. Because Australian rain forest has plant species in
   the same family as atemoya (Annonaceae) and because many rain forest
   plants are beetle pollinated, we set out to discover whether tropical
   rain forest in far north Queensland harbors beetles that could provide
   this ecosystem service for atemoya crops. Orchards were chosen along a
   gradient of increasing distance from tropical rain forest (0.1-24 km).
   We sampled 100 flowers from each of nine atemoya orchards and determined
   the identity and abundance of insects within each flower. To assess the
   amount of pollination due to insects, we bagged six flowers per tree and
   left another six flowers per tree accessible to insects on 10 trees at
   an orchard near rain forest. Results indicated that atemoya orchards !
   0.5 km from rain forest were predominantly visited by five previously
   unrecognized native beetle pollinators that are likely to originate in
   tropical rain forest. These native beetles occurred reliably enough in
   crops near rain forest to have a positive effect on the quantity of
   fruit produced but their contribution was not great enough to satisfy
   commercial production needs. Management changes, aimed at increasing
   native beetle abundance in crops, are required before these beetles
   could eliminate the need for growers to band pollinate atemoya flowers.
   Appreciation of the value of this resource is necessary if we are to
   develop landscapes that both conserve native biodiversity and support

   pollination and nectar robbing ecology of Linaria vulgaris in the
   Colorado Rocky Mountains, with emphasis on the role of bumblebee
   proboscis length. Bees can extract nectar from a nectar spur
   legitimately, by entering the front of the flower, or illegitimately, by
   biting or reusing holes in the spur. Although L. vulgaris flowers are
   apparently adapted for pollination by long-tongued bees, short-tongued
   bees visited them legitimately for trace amounts of nectar but switched
   to secondary robbing in the presence of primary robbers. Longer-tongued
   bees removed more nectar in less time than did shorter-tongued bees, and

   of flowers had been pierced. As the proportion of robbed flowers in the
   population increased, the relative number of legitimate visits decreased
   while the relative number of robbing visits increased. Robbing decreased
   nectar standing crop and increased the proportion of empty flowers per
   inflorescence. Despite these potentially detrimental effects of robbers,
   differences in inflorescence use among robbers and pollinators, and the
   placement of holes made by primary robbers, may mitigate negative
   effects of nectar robbing in L. vulgaris. We discuss some of the reasons

   season of these species highly overlapped and they shared the same
   method of pollination (via bumblebees). The floral density and nectar
   production were higher in P. caerulea in the early snowmelt habitat, but
   they were higher in P. aleutica in the late snowmelt habitat, reflecting
   the species-specific sensitivity to a short growing season. Bumblebee
   preference shifted from P. caerulea to P. aleutica along the snowmelt
   gradient, reflecting the changes in the relative reward level between
   the species. The extent of pollen limitation of P. caeruea was severe in
   the late snowmelt habitat, whereas that of P. aleutica was obvious in
   the early snowmelt habitat. A pollination experiment revealed that P.
   caerulea showed a consistently low selfing ability, whereas P. aleutica
   showed a high selfing ability in the early snowmelt habitat and shifted
   to an obligate outcrosser in the late snowmelt habitat. The frequency of

   of interspecific bumblebee movement. However, heterospecific
   compatibility of P. aleutica disappeared in the late snowmelt habitat,
   where the risk of heterospecific pollen receipt was low. Therefore,
   changes in interspecific bumblebee movement might have been responsible

Abstract = {{The role of genetic factors in extinction is firmly established for

   determination ancestral to the haplodiploid Hymenoptera (ants, bees, and
   wasps) imposes a substantial genetic load through homozygosity at the
   sex locus that results in the production of inviable or sterile diploid
   males. Using stochastic modeling, we have discovered that diploid male
   production (DMP) can initiate a rapid and previously uncharacterized
   extinction vortex. The extinction rate in haplodiploid populations with
   DMP is an order of magnitude greater than in its absence under realistic
   but conservative demographic parameter values. Furthermore, DMP alone
   can elevate the base extinction risk in haplodiploids by over an order
   of magnitude higher than that caused by inbreeding depression in
   threatened diploids. Thus, contrary to previous expectations,
   haplodiploids are more, rather than less, prone to extinction for

   visitation rates (and resulting seed set) occurred during the morning
   and afternoon diurnal time periods and the evening crepuscular time
   period. The relative frequencies of the different visitors varied over
   the 24-h day and between flowering seasons. Most visitors that could be
   evaluated were found to be effective pollinators. Thus, a pollinator's
   importance to reproductive success was generally dictated by its
   visitation frequency, H. diffinis being the most important pollinator.

Abstract = {{This study examines how, over the short term, logging affects the
   density of bumble bees (Apidae: Bombus), the understory plants commonly
   visited by bumble bees, and the numerical relationship between bumble
   bees and flowers. In the summers before and after winter logging, bumble
   bees and plants were surveyed in 50 deciduous stands (each of 8-10 ha)
   in the boreal forest of northern Alberta, Canada. Logging was replicated
   at three different intensities: 0, 10-20, and 50-75\% of trees
   remaining. There were generally more bumble bees, species of bumble
   bee-visited plants, and flowers in moderately (50-75\%) logged sites,
   but this pattern depended on the time of year. Before logging, bumble
   bees matched resources according to an ideal free distribution (IFD).
   Logging affected the distribution of bumble bees across floral
   resources: the slope of the regression relating bumble bee and flower
   proportions was less than one for clearcut and control treatments (i.e.,
   undermatching), with too many bumble bees in the flower-poor
   compartments and too few in the flower-rich ones. Deviations from an IFD
   were negative in control sites, such that fewer bumble bees occurred
   here than warranted by flower numbers. Controlling for flower density,
   bumble bee density was significantly greater in clearcuts than in the
   other treatments. By disproportionately visiting plants in clearcuts
   (relative to flower density), and by undermatching, bumble bees in
   clearcuts should experience higher levels of competition. Conversely,
   the fewer (and undermatching) bumble bees in control sites (relative to
   flower abundances there) may cause these plants to obtain diminished
   pollination service. The proximity of clearcut logging to pristine areas
   may therefore negatively impact plants and bumble bees in the pristine
   areas, at least in the season immediately following logging.}},

Abstract = {{The land area covered by powerline easements in the United States
   exceeds the area of almost all national parks, including Yellowstone. In
   parts of Europe and the US, electric companies have altered their land
   management practices from periodic mowing to extraction of tall
   vegetation combined with the use of selective herbicides. To investigate
   whether this alternate management practice might produce higher quality
   habitat for native bees, we compared the bee fauna collected in unmowed
   powerline corridors and in nearby mowed grassy fields at the Patuxent
   Wildlife Research Center (MD). Powerline sites had more spatially and
   numerically rare species and a richer bee community than the grassy
   fields, although the difference was less pronounced than we expected.
   Powerline sites also had more parasitic species and more cavity-nesting
   bees. Bee communities changed progressively through the season, but
   differences between the site types were persistent. The surrounding,
   non-grassland landscape likely has a strong influence on the bee species
   collected at the grassland sites, as some bees may be foraging in the
   grasslands but nesting elsewhere. Improving habitat for native bees will
   help ameliorate the loss of pollination services caused by the collapse
   of wild and managed honeybee populations. This study suggests that
   powerline strips have the potential to provide five million acres of
   bee-friendly habitat in the US if utilities more generally adopt

Abstract = {{The consequences of fragmentation for communities of mutualist partners
   are for the most part unknown; moreover, most studies addressing this
   issue have been conducted on plant-pollinator communities. We evaluated
   how the experimental fragmentation of lowland Amazonian rain forest
   influenced a community of ant-plant mutualists. We inventoried a total
   of 1057 myrmecophytes in four fragments and four continuous forest
   sites; the twelve plant species recorded were occupied by 33 ant
   morphospecies, of which 11 were obligate plant inhabitants. Neither
   plant species richness, ant species richness, nor total ant-plant
   density were significantly lower in forest fragments. However, eight of

   isolation, most species are rare and populations sizes in fragments are
   extremely low. Environmental and demographic stochasticity could

Abstract = {{A recent alternative model to conventional coevolution, the geographic

   episodic and local, rather than persistent and spatially extensive.
   However, little empirical evidence addresses this model's tenets, in
   particular the temporal stability of local plant-pollinator
   interactions. We evaluated this tenet using the richly diverse guild of
   bees at creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), a generalist plant that hosts
   many specialist bees. We systematically resampled over 2-5 years at 11
   sites across the south-western USA. Incidence and abundance also were
   compared for survey sites sampled 20 2 years earlier. Average
   Morisita-Horn faunal similarities of local bee guilds was 87\% for
   sequential years and 36\% after 20 years. Similarities in taxonomic
   composition of resampled local bee guilds could be statistically
   represented as a random assemblage drawn from the regional source pool
   of 54-68 bee species that could be expected at Larrea, weighted by
   regional abundance. At every site, only the minority of abundant bee
   species was typically persistent in local guilds, even after > 20 years.
   Most bee species in the Larrea guild were chronically uncommon,
   geographically sporadic and temporally unpredictable, attributes that
   render them numerically inconsequential as pollinators in their local
   guild. Persistence among abundant bee species in local pollinator
   assemblages satisfies one condition by which reciprocal selection could
   act locally. The well-being of these more abundant core species, and not
   bee diversity per se, may better characterize the health of such
   plant-pollinator associations. (c) 2005 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Pedicularis has a conflicted infrageneric taxonomic history in which

   specialized floral forms from generalized ancestors. In this study,
   molecular phylogenetic analysis of Pedicularis reveals a low concordance
   of robust clade support and taxonomic groups. Nevertheless, the basic

Abstract = {{Male orchid bees (Euglossini) pollinate 10\% of the neotropical orchid
   flora while collecting floral scents, which they store and accumulate in
   hind tibial pouches. The purpose of these fragrances is unclear, as is
   the context, timing and mechanism of their possible exposure. Here we
   show for the first time that males expose and relocate their fragrances
   during courtship display. We present high-speed video analyses revealing
   an intricate and repetitive leg movement performed by displaying male
   Euglossa cognata. The behavior involves several morphological structures
   of hitherto unknown function and suggests transfer of substances from
   the hind tibia to a contralateral mid-tibial tuft of hairs.
   Body-side-specific fluorescent dye application and consecutive detection
   of signals on males after display confirmed this transfer. Deposited on
   the mid-tibial tufts, the fragrances are ideally placed in order to
   become ventilated by jugal combs on the wing bases, as previously
   suggested by Bembe (in Apidologie 35:288-291, 2004). Being clearly
   distinct from motor patterns involved in fragrance collection, the
   described movement is continuously performed by displaying males,
   suggesting an equally continuous exposure of volatiles. Although the

Abstract = {{Worldwide trade in non-native bumblebees remains largely unrestricted
   despite well-documented cases where introductions of non-native bees
   have gone dramatically wrong. Within Europe, indiscriminate importation
   of non-native populations of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) for the
   pollination of glasshouse crops continues on a massive scale. However,
   no risk assessment has been conducted for these introductions, perhaps
   because B. terrestris is considered a native species, so shipping
   populations from one region to another has been implicitly assumed to
   present no risk. This view is clearly unjustified because Bombus
   terrestris populations differ significantly in their genetic makeup as
   demonstrated by strong differences in coat colour and behavioural
   traits. Therefore, for the first time we compare an important
   competitive trait, namely foraging performance, between commercially
   available B. terrestris populations in contrasting environments. We test
   whether commercially reared populations differ in their nectar foraging
   performance and whether this is influenced by both their source
   environment and the one they are introduced into. We do this by means of
   a reciprocal transplant experiment. Strong, consistent interpopulation
   differences in performance occurred irrespective of test location:
   Canary Island bees (B.t. canariensis) were superior to Sardinian bees
   (B.t. sassaricus), which were generally superior to mainland European
   bees (B.t. terrestris). These inter-population differences in
   performance were largely explained by inter-population variation in
   forager size, with larger bees being superior foragers. However, even
   when body size was accounted for, ``native{''} bees were not superior to
   transplanted non-native bees in all but one case. We conclude that
   non-native populations, especially those with large foragers, can be
   highly competitive foragers. This could lead to their establishment and
   displacement of native bees. Therefore, we recommend that unregulated
   movements of non-native B. terrestris populations within Europe should
   not be carried out without a full risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments of new families of pesticides and growing awareness
   of the importance of wild pollinators for crop pollination have
   stimulated interest in potential effects of novel pesticides on wild
   bees. Yet pesticide toxicity studies on wild bees remain rare, and few
   studies have included long-term monitoring of bumble bee colonies or
   testing of foraging ability after pesticide exposure. Larval bees
   feeding on exogenous pollen and exposed to pesticides during development
   may result in lethal or sublethal effects during the adult stage. We
   tested the effects of a naturally derived biopesticide, spinosad, on
   humble bee (Bombus impatiens Cresson) colony health, including adult
   mortality, brood development, weights of emerging bees and foraging
   efficiency of adults that underwent larval development during exposure
   to spinosad. We monitored colonies from an early stage, over a 10-week
   period, and fed spinosad to colonies in pollen at four levels: control,
   0.2, 0.8 and 8.0 mg kg(-1), during weeks 2 through 5 of the experiment.
   At concentrations that bees would likely encounter in pollen in the wild
   (0.2-0.8 mg kg(-1)) we detected minimal negative effects to humble bee
   colonies. Brood and adult mortality was high at S. 0 mg kg-1 spinosad,
   about twice the level that bees would be exposed to in a `worst case'
   field scenario, resulting in colony death two to four weeks after
   initial pesticide exposure. At more realistic concentrations there were
   potentially important sub-lethal effects. Adult worker bees exposed to
   spinosad during larval development at 0.8 mg kg(-1) were slower foragers
   on artificial complex flower arrays than bees from low or no spinosad

Abstract = {{Bromelia antiacantha flowered from December to February and during this

   inflorescence bears 150-350 flowers, with 10-35 flowers opening per day
   over 4-5 days. The flowers are dark magenta coloured with white margins,
   tubular-shaped with a wide opening, and their stigma is situated below
   the anthers. Anthesis began around 4:00 h and flowers lasted
   approximately 15 h. The highest nectar volume and sugar concentration
   occurred between 4:00 - 6:00 h; after this period, both decreased
   throughout the day. B. antiacantha is partially self-incompatible,
   non-autogamous, and therefore, pollinator dependent. The hummingbirds
   Thalurania glaucopis, Amazilia fimbriata, and Ramphodon naevius were its
   most frequent pollinators (55\% of the visits), visiting flowers mainly
   in the afternoon. The scattered distribution of B. antiacantha promoted
   trap-lining behaviour of the hummingbirds, which favoured fruit set
   through xenogamy. Corolla colour, wide flower opening, sweet odour and
   concentrated nectar early in the day favoured bee visitation. Of the
   38\% of bee visits, 96\% were made by Bombus morio, mainly in the
   morning and their behaviour promoted self-pollination. The bee Trigona
   spinipes frequently acted as a pollen and nectar thief early in the
   morning, excluding most of the hummingbirds. Bromelia antiacantha has
   ornithophilous and melittophilous features, and despite being pollinated
   by two kinds of agents, its reproductive success depends on a given set

Abstract = {{Irises in the section Oncocyclus (Siems.) Baker (Iris: Iridaceae) grow
   throughout the Middle East and have large and dark-coloured flowers but
   no nectar reward available to flower visitors. Consequently, no
   reward-collecting pollinators have been observed visiting the flowers
   during daytime. The only visitors are solitary male bees (Eucera spp.:
   Apidae) that enter the flowers at dusk and stay there overnight. Here we
   describe the mating system of Oncocyclus irises, and the role of
   night-sheltering male bees in their pollination system. Pollen viability
   in I. haynei on Mt. Gilboa was very high (> 90\%) throughout all floral
   life stages. Stigmas were receptive in buds and in open flowers, but not
   in older ones. Self-pollination yielded no fruits in three species,
   confirming complete self-incompatibility in Oncocyclus irises. On
   average, 1.9 flowers were visited by each male bee before it settled for
   the night in the last one. Moreover, Iris pollen was present on the
   dorsal side of 38.8\% of males caught sheltering in flower models
   mounted near an I. atrofusca population, indicating that pollen is
   transferred between flowers by night-sheltering solitary male bees. We
   have surveyed 13 flowering populations of six Oncocyclus species for the
   presence of night-sheltering male bees as well as for fruit set. We
   found a positive correlation, indicating that sexual reproduction in
   Oncocyclus irises is dependent on night-sheltering solitary male bees.
   Based on their complete self-incompatibility, the absence of
   nectar-collecting visitors during the day, and the transfer of pollen
   grains by the night-sheltering solitary male bees, we conclude that
   fertilization of Oncocyclus irises is totally dependent on pollination
   by night-sheltering solitary male bees.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate and univariate analyses were used to investigate patterns
   of floral and foliar morphological diversification among the eight
   taxonomic varieties of Pedicularis bracteosa (Orobanchaceae). Canonical
   discriminant analysis supported six varieties but not without
   considerable morphological overlap. Discrimination was most strongly
   based upon three floral characters: galea shape, throat length, and
   calyx tip length; and secondarily on three foliar characters: subtending
   bract width, longest leaflet width, and longest leaflet length. Analysis
   of variance on the ratio between calyx length and the length of the
   connate portion of the calyx did not corroborate a taxonomic difference
   among all varieties. Because galea shape is associated with specific
   pollination syndromes that promote reproductive isolation in other
   Pedicularis species, selection by the different pollinating behaviors of
   queens versus worker castes of the same species of bumblebees may be
   driving the diversification of floral morphology. While the taxa are
   largely allopatric and supported by several strong morphological
   discriminators, the high degree of morphological overlap among them does
   not justify their re-ranking above variety. Lack of discrimination
   between varieties siifolia and canbyi argues for their merger into a

Abstract = {{Arrowleaf balsamroot, Balsamorhiza sagittata (Pursh) Nutt, is a common,
   sometimes dominant, long-lived forb that flowers early in spring from
   the foothills to upper-montane areas of the northern Rocky Mountains and

   (46\% of ovules yielded plump achenes) but partially self-compatible
   (31\% of achenes were plump). Unvisited flower heads formed virtually no
   mature achenes; only plump achenes contained seeds with endosperm.
   Freely visited flower heads in 2 populations produced as many achenes as
   manual outcross pollinations of flower heads, suggesting that seed
   production was not pollinator limited. Two species of Osmia bees rely

Abstract = {{Numerous Australian terrestrial orchid species in the genus Diuris may
   be pollinated by food source mimicry. In our field studies, direct
   observations of orchid-pollinator interactions were rare, but native
   bees were frequently captured carrying orchid pollinaria, or pollinaria
   remnants. Sometimes, pollinaria remnants were minimal and included only
   the viscidium, a sticky pad that was often highly persistent.
   Confirmation of such tissue as being of orchid source, and attributing
   them to a particular species can aid pollination studies. DNA-based
   methods that may identify more or less intact orchid pollinaria are
   available, but extremely small and degraded samples can pose technical
   challenges. We have developed an AFLP protocol for such difficult
   samples that offers some significant advantages over direct PCR-based
   analysis. We simulated AFLP profiling of very low-DNA samples using DNA
   template from serial dilutions. A DNA sample range from 6.4 picograms to
   at least as high as 100 nanograms (15500-fold range) all yielded AFLP
   fingerprints. The practical application of this inherent sensitivity of
   AFLP is demonstrated by the identification of remnants of orchid
   pollinaria sampled from bees, presented here as a case study. It is
   expected that this approach will find many applications where sample DNA
   is limiting, or possibly where pollen of similar appearance may comprise
   species mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator specificity has traditionally been considered the main
   reproductive isolation mechanism in orchids. Among Mediterranean
   orchids, however, many species attract and deceive pollinators by
   mimicking nectar-rewarding plants. To test the extent to which deceptive
   orchid species share pollinators, we collected and identified
   hernipollinaria-carrying insects, and used ribosomal sequences to
   identify the orchid species from which hernipollinaria were removed. We
   found that social and solitary bees, and also flies, carried
   hemipollinaria belonging to nine orchid species with different degrees
   of specialization. In particular, Anacamptis morio, Dactylorhiza romana
   and Orchis mascula used a large set of pollinator species, whereas
   others such as Orchis quadripunctata seemed to be pollinated by one
   pollinator species only. Out of the insects with hernipollinaria, 19\%
   were found to carry hernipollinaria from more than one orchid species,
   indicating that sympatric food-deceptive orchids can share pollinators.
   This sharing was apparent even among orchid sister-species, thus
   revealing an effective overlap in pollinator sets among closely related
   species. These results suggest varying degrees of pollinator specificity
   in these orchids, and indicate that pollinator specificity cannot always
   act as the main isolation mechanism in food-deceptive temperate orchids.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Based on the bell shape and greenish colour of the
   flowers, bat-pollination was suggested for some Sinningieae species
   (Gesneriaceae). Actually, there are no reports on pollination biology
   and visitors for these species. This paper reports on pollination
   biology of Sinningia brasiliensis, Paliavana prasinata and P.
   sericiflora in south-eastern Brazil.
   Methods Flowers were observed in situ to determine phases of anthesis,
   colour patterns and scent intensity. Corolla measures were taken from
   fresh flowers. Nectar production and concentration were measured in
   flowers bagged at the pre-anthesis phases. Direct visual observations of
   visitors were made during the day and night, and photographs were taken
   to analyse their visiting behaviour.
   Key Results Some floral features of the three species fit the
   bat-pollination syndrome: large, robust and gullet-shaped corollas,
   colour patterns and large amount of nectar. However, other floral
   features-such as onset of anthesis, nectar attributes and odour
   intensity-differ among the species. Nectar volume and total sugar
   production increased significantly at midnight in S. brasiliensis and P.
   prasinata, but in P. sericiflora there were no significant differences
   in the total nectar and sugar production during anthesis. Scent
   intensity is much higher in S. brasiliensis and P. prasinata than P.
   sericiflora. Flowers of S. brasiliensis and P. prasinata, whose features
   fit the chiropterophilous syndrome, are pollinated by glossophagine bat
   species. Paliavana sericiflora, on the other hand, presents floral
   features intermediate between bat and hummingbird syndromes, but is
   visited and pollinated only by hummingbirds.
   Conclusions These data strengthen the statement that the bat syndrome in
   Sinningieae originated independently in Sinningia brasiliensis and in
   Paliavana species. Paliavana sericiflora may be another example of a
   plant `in transition' from the hummingbird to the bat pollination, but a
   reversion in the direction of bat to hummingbird might not be excluded.
   It is also possible that this is a case of speciation on both bat and
   hummingbird pollination. Studies on Paliavana sister species may provide
   insights about origins and the evolutionary directions of the
   pollination systems of these species.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Floral design in self-compatible plants can

   longispathus, a self-compatible bee-pollinated species with wide
   variation in anther-stigma separation (herkogamy), to determine the
   relationship between variation in this floral trait and the relative
   amounts of cross- and self-fertilization.
   Methods Anther-stigma separation was measured in the field in six
   populations of N. longispathus from southeastern Spain. Variation in
   herkogamy during the life of individual flowers was also quantified.
   Multilocus out-crossing rates were estimated from plants differing in
   herkogamy using allozyme markers.
   Key Results Anther-stigma separation varied considerably among flowers
   within the six populations studied (range= 1-10 mm). This variation was
   nearly one order of magnitude larger than the slight, statistically
   non-significant developmental variation during the lifespan of
   individual flowers. Estimates of multilocus outcrossing rate for
   different herkogamy classes (t(m) range = 0.49-0-76) failed to reveal a
   monotonic increase with increasing herkogamy.
   Conclusions It is suggested that the lack of a positive relationship

Abstract = {{Enantiostyly, the reciprocal deflection of the style to the left or
   right side of the floral axis has evolved independently in at least a
   dozen angiosperm families. Unlike other plant sexual polymorphisms, the
   adaptive significance of these mirror-image flowers remains unclear.
   Most authors have interpreted enantiostyly as a floral mechanism that
   promotes cross-pollination. However, any functional interpretation is
   complicated by the fact that enantiostyly occurs in two forms. In
   monomorphic enantiostyly there are left- and right-styled flowers on the
   same plant, while in dimorphic enantiostyly they are on separate
   individuals. In this paper we develop a model of pollen transfer which
   indicates that monomorphic enantiostyly should reduce geitonogamous
   pollination compared to a non-enantiostylous condition, and that the
   lowest levels of geitonogamous pollination should occur in dimorphic
   enantiostyly. We tested these predictions using floral manipulations of
   bee-pollinated Solanum rostratum in garden arrays. We compared mating
   patterns and fertility in five array types: non-enantiostylous and
   straight-styled, monomorphic enantiostylous, dimorphic enantiostylous,
   and arrays uniform for either left or right stylar deflection.
   Outcrossing rates in non-enantiostylous arrays (t = 0.33 +/- 0.04) were
   significantly lower than all other arrays, while monomorphic
   enantiostylous arrays (t = 0.74 +/- 0.06) had significantly lower
   outcrossing rates than dimorphic enantiostylous arrays (t = 0.88 +/-
   0.04) and those uniform for stylar deflection (t = 0.84 +/- 0.04). In
   dimorphic enantiostylous arrays, intermorph pollen transfer accounted
   for 75\% of all outcrossing events. In pollen-limited situations, both
   types of enantiostylous arrays had significantly higher female fertility
   than arrays fixed for one direction, demonstrating that enantiostyly
   promotes pollen transfer between flowers of opposite stylar orientation.
   Our results provide support for the hypothesis that enantiostyly
   functions to increase the precision of cross-pollination in
   bee-pollinated plants by reducing geitonogamy. (c) 2005 The Linnean

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of agriculture are of concern, especially with
   genetically modified and other intensive, modern cropping systems, yet
   little is known about effects on wild bee populations and subsequent
   implications for pollination. Pollination deficit (the difference
   between potential and actual pollination) and bee abundance were
   measured in organic, conventional, and herbicide-resistant, genetically
   modified (GM) canola fields (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in northern
   Alberta, Canada, in the summer of 2002. Bee abundance data were
   collected using pan traps and standardized sweep netting, and
   pollination deficit was assessed by comparing the number of seeds per
   fruit from open-pollinated and supplementally pollinated flowers. There
   was no pollination deficit in organic fields, a moderate pollination
   deficit in conventional fields, and the greatest pollination deficit in
   GM fields. Bee abundance was greatest in organic fields, followed by
   conventional fields, and lowest in GM fields. Overall, there was a
   strong, positive relationship between bee abundance at sampling
   locations and reduced pollination deficits. Seed set in B. napus
   increased with greater bee abundance. Because B. rapa is an obligate
   outcrossing species, the lack of pollination deficit in the organic (B.
   rapa) fields likely was due to the high bee abundance rather than a
   lower dependence of B. rapa on pollinators than B. napus canola. Our
   study illustrates the importance of wild bees to agricultural production
   and suggests that some agroecosystems may better sustain wild bee
   abundance, resulting in greater seed production. Further research on why
   some cropping systems, such as genetically modified, herbicide-resistant
   canola, have low wild bee abundance would be useful for management of
   agroecosystems to promote sustainability of food production.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollen can be transported thousands of kilometres by insects but its
   viability after long-distance transport is not known. Knowing the

   2. The viability of pollen from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and
   canola (Brassica napus L.) was determined after placing it on the
   proboscis of Helicoverpa armigera moths for intervals of up to 32 h.
   Viability of both cotton and canola pollen declined at a much greater
   rate when in contact with the moth proboscis. Most was non-viable by 8 h
   compared with 16 h for control cotton pollen or 32 h for canola pollen.
   3. There was no significant difference in the rate of decline of pollen
   viability between the five conventional cotton varieties, or between
   these and the one GM cotton variety used in these experiments.
   4. The number of canola pollen grains remaining on the proboscis
   declined over time. Very few cotton pollen grains were retained on the
   proboscis.
   5. The reduction in pollen viability during contact with the proboscis
   might indicate partial ingestion of the pollen via the proboscis.
   6. The points above suggest that pollen is unlikely to remain attached

Abstract = {{1. Pollinator visitation patterns in relation to variation in floral
   display size may be modified both quantitatively and qualitatively by
   local plant density. In this study four measures of pollinator response
   by Bombus spp. (plant visitation rate, bout length, proportion of
   flowers visited, flower visitation rate) were investigated under two or
   three different plant densities in two consecutive years in a natural
   population of Digitalis purpurea L.
   2. Plant visitation rate increased with floral display size in both
   years, and was higher in dense patches compared with sparse ones in
   1999. Bout lengths increased with display size in 1999, and bouts were
   longer in sparse patches. However, the actual rate of increase with
   display size was independent of plant density for both response
   measures.
   3. The proportion of flowers visited decreased with floral display size
   in both years, and in 1999 the decline was faster in high-density
   patches. As a result, the proportion visited was higher in dense patches
   for the smallest display sizes, and higher in sparse patches for larger
   display sizes.
   4. Flower visitation rate decreased with floral display size in both
   years. This is inconsistent with the idea that bees achieve an ideal
   free distribution across flowers. There was no significant effect of
   plant density.
   5. These results demonstrate that local plant density variation may
   modify the functional relationship between floral display size and
   pollinator visitation rate, and potentially influence plant mating
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of variation in plant-pollinator (p-p) systems in response to
   environmental variables have been the focus of much recent attention. We
   analyzed species diversity and generalization of interactions of flower
   visitors belonging to eight p-p networks along a steep rainfall gradient
   in NW Patagonia, Argentina. To our knowledge, this is the first
   published study that applies a humidity-gradient approach to p-p
   networks analysis. Throughout the gradient, we recorded 1232
   interactions between 413 different animal species and 111 plant species.
   We found that (a) specialization measures showed no clear pattern of
   variation throughout the rainfall gradient, (b) the diversity of
   flower-visiting insects does not consistently respond to rainfall
   gradients along the gradient, and (c) as we predicted, flies dominated
   the wetter end of the gradient, while at the drier end bees prevailed.
   The lack of differences in diversity could be explained by the repeated
   cycles of species extinctions undergone in the past by the southern
   temperate forests, which dominate the wetter end of the gradient. A
   logistic model that related the flies' dominance of the visitor
   assemblage with latitude was good predictor of the average fly
   composition of the entire region, although we found major between-site
   variations in response to local environmental conditions. The
   replacement of flies by bees towards the drier end of the gradient
   seemed to repeat a worldwide pattern where flies dominate humid regions
   while bees attain their greatest abundance in xeric regions. Regional
   patterns in the structure of our p-p systems (composition of the visitor
   fauna) were better explained by altitudinal differences, while function
   (percentage of interactions established by each taxon) seemed to be more

Abstract = {{Insects visiting the flowers of slickspot peppergrass, Lepidium

   southwestern Idaho, 7.5 +/- 2.7\% of L. papilliferum plants (range

   a spider, only 15 predation attempts were observed, with only 3 of those
   being successful. Despite the relatively low incidence of predation by
   crab spiders, an experiment revealed that the number of insects visiting

   a crab spider than at plants free of spiders. In another experiment,
   floral visits increased significantly following the removal of crab
   spiders from individual plants. The deterrent effect of spiders was not
   due to a disproportionate avoidance response by certain types of
   insects; all insect families included in our analysis showed decreases
   in visitations to flowers when spiders were present, although none of
   these differences were statistically significant at the individual
   level. We found no significant change in the duration of visits to

   oblivious to the predator's presence, or that they were aware of the

Abstract = {{The flowers of two species of threatened New Zealand mistletoes

   explosive buds that do not open unless force is applied by birds or two
   species of native short-tongued bees. Opened flowers are visited by a
   variety of birds and insects. Although both species of Peraxilla conform
   to a pollination syndrome of ornithophily, bees may be effective
   alternative pollinators. We investigated the effectiveness of bees and
   birds as pollinators of P. colensoi at one site and P. tetrapetala at
   two sites in the South Island. Bees and other insects outnumbered birds
   as flower visitors at all three sites. By excluding birds with wire
   cages, we showed that two bee species regularly open flowers of P.
   tetrapetala, but only rarely open flowers of P. colensoi. Few pollen
   grains were deposited when either birds or bees opened buds, so opening
   buds was not by itself sufficient for adequate pollination. Instead,
   pollen continued to accumulate over the next 6 or 7 days, even inside
   cages that excluded birds. Both populations of P. tetrapetala were
   regularly pollen-limited, but in different ways. At Ohau, opened flowers
   gained enough pollen to produce seeds, but many buds were not opened and
   hence failed to set seed. In contrast, at Craigieburn, nearly all buds
   were opened, but many of these did not receive enough pollen. These
   results demonstrate that native bees can partially replace birds as
   pollinators of mistletoes, despite their apparent ornithophilous
   syndrome. Ongoing reductions in New Zealand forest bird numbers means
   that the service bees provide may be important for the long-term future

   questions and key approaches in four areas: (1) identifying the
   important `ecosystem service providers'; (2) determining the various
   aspects of community structure that influence function in real
   landscapes, especially compensatory community responses that stabilize
   function, or non-random extinction sequences that rapidly erode it; (3)

Abstract = {{Floral morphology and observations on insect and avian visitors to

   Tritoniopsis indicate that short-tubed pink flowers, ancestral in the

   shifts to more specialized pollination systems have occurred in the
   genus during its evolution. Four species with elongate floral tubes and
   a pink to red bilabiate perianth are pollinated either by sunbirds
   (Nectarinia) alone or by sunbirds and the satyrid butterfly Aeropetes
   tulbaghia. Another red-flowered species with an actinomorphic flower is
   inferred to be pollinated only by Aeropetes, while two species with pale
   pink flowers with red markings are pollinated by long-proboscid flies in
   the genus Prosoeca (Nemestrinidae). Tritoniopsis parviflora is unique in
   the African Iridaceae in producing floral oils as a reward to the
   short-tongued bee Rediviva gigas (Melittidae), as well as conventional
   sugar nectar. Tritoniopsis nervosa has white, sweetly scented,
   long-tubed flowers and is assumed to be pollinated by night-flying
   moths. Although relationships within Tritoniopsis are poorly understood,
   it is clear that at least five shifts in pollination strategy have

   bimodal pollination systems using two different pollinator groups occur
   in several species, using sunbirds and Aeropetes, anthophorine bees and

   Such bimodal systems are probably important for the successful

Abstract = {{High-pressure liquid chromatography analyses of 73 plant species showed
   that the nectars of phrygana (East Mediterranean garrigue) mainly
   contain sucrose, glucose, and fructose, and traces of 10 minor sugars.
   Although the sucrose/hexose ratio was not related to plant life habit,
   ecological constraints had a detectable effect in shaping sugar
   composition. This was detected by distinguishing the phryganic plant
   species into ``spring-summer{''} and ``winter{''} flowering, with the
   distinction made on the basis of the water deficit in the study area.
   Plants flowering in spring-summer had a higher rate of ``high
   sucrose{''} (i.e., sucrose/hexose ratio >= 0.5; 60.8\% of the plant
   species) vs. ``low hexose{''} nectars (i.e., ratio < 0.5; 39.2\%). The
   ratio was reversed in winter flowering species (36.4\% vs. 63.6\% with
   ``high sucrose{''} and ``high hexose,{''} respectively). Sucrose/hexose
   ratios were associated with plant family. The highest values were those
   of Lamiaceae, which differed significantly from the ``low sucrose{''}
   Liliaceae and Apiaceae. Based on recorded plant-pollinator interactions
   in the community, the present data provide evidence of a partitioning of
   nectar resources by the existing pollinator guilds within the community,
   based on the sugar profiles of nectar (all sucrose/hexose ratios for all
   interactions). Among all major groups, bees and wasps (aculeates)
   preferred ``high sucrose{''} nectars, which differed significantly from
   syrphids, anthomyid a.o. flies, and beetles that visited ``low
   sucrose{''} nectars. Similarly, butterflies visited ``lower sucrose{''}
   nectars compared to bees. Within families, only Megachilidae could be
   clearly characterized as ``high sucrose{''} consumers, differing in this
   respect from all the remaining insect groups including most other bee
   families. This confirms previous findings that Megachilidae have a key
   position in Mediterranean communities where they probably constitute a
   selective factor for ``high sucrose{''} nectars.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are major pollinators of crops and wildflowers in northern
   temperate regions. Knowledge of their ecology is vital for the design of
   effective management and conservation strategies but key aspects remain
   poorly understood. Here we employed microsatellite markers to estimate
   and compare foraging range and nest density among four UK species:
   Bombus terrestris, Bombus pascuorum, Bombus lapidarius, and Bombus
   pratorum. Workers were sampled along a 1.5-km linear transect across
   arable farmland. Eight or nine polymorphic microsatellite markers were
   then used to identify putative sisters. In accordance with previous
   studies, minimum estimated maximum foraging range was greatest for B.
   terrestris (758 m) and least for B. pascuorum (449 m). The estimate for
   B. lapidarius was similar to B. pascuorum (450 m), while that of B.
   pratorum was intermediate (674 m). Since the area of forage available to
   bees increases as the square of foraging range, these differences
   correspond to a threefold variation in the area used by bumblebee nests
   of different species. Possible explanations for these differences are
   discussed. Estimates for nest density at the times of sampling were 29,
   68, 117, and 26/km(2) for B. terrestris, B. pascuorum, B. lapidarius and
   B. pratorum, respectively. These data suggest that even among the most
   common British bumblebee species, significant differences in fundamental
   aspects of their ecology exist, a finding that should be reflected in
   management and conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Flower colour is a major advertisement signal of zoophilous plants for
   pollinators. Bees, the main pollinators, exhibit innate colour
   preferences, which have often been attributed to only one single floral
   colour, though most flowers display a pattern of two or several colours.
   The existing studies of floral colour patterns are mostly qualitative
   studies. Using a model of bee colour vision we quantitatively
   investigate two questions: whether or not component colours of floral
   colour patterns may mimic pollen signals, and whether or not bumblebees
   exhibit innate preferences for distinct parameters of naturally existing
   floral colour patterns. We analysed the spectral reflectances of 162
   plant species with multicoloured flowers and inflorescences,
   distiniguishing between inner and outer colours of floral colour
   patterns irrespective of the particular structures so coloured.
   We found that:
   The inner colour of radially symmetrical flowers and inflorescences and
   of zygomorphic flowers appears less diverse to bees than the peripheral
   colour.
   The inner colour of most radial flowers and inflorescences as well as
   the inner colour of a large number of non-related zygomorphic flowers
   appears to bees to be very similar to that of pollen.
   Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) exhibit innate preferences for
   two-coloured over single-coloured dummy flowers in a spontaneous choice
   test.
   Bumblebees exhibit innate preferences for dummy flowers with a large
   over those with a small centre area.
   Bumblebees exhibit innate preferences for dummy flowers with a centre
   colour similar to that of pollen over those with another centre colour.
   Our findings support the hypotheses that the inner component of floral
   colour patterns could be interpreted as a generalised and little
   recognised form of mimicry of the colour of visually displayed pollen,
   that bumblebees exhibit innate preferences regarding colour and size
   parameters of floral colour patterns, and that these correspond to
   visually displayed pollen. These findings together suggest a prominent
   role of floral colour patterns in advertisement to and guidance of naive
   flower visitors.}},

   polifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Ledum palustre, Oxycoccus palustris,
   Vaccinium myrtillus, V. uliginosum, and V. vitis-idaea L. were studied.
   Some species of insects visiting flowers were excluded from the list of
   pollinators on the basis of observation on their behavior. L. palustre
   was visited mainly by flies where as other investigated species were
   visited mainly by bumblebees. In some cases bumblebees were the only

   from flies and short-tongued solitary bees visits and ensure a best
   pollination by bumblebees are various among different species of
   Ericaceae. Efficiency of nectary protection also differs among different
   plant species and is defined by particularities of their habitats and
   flowering phenology. As far as all species of this family during the
   flowering are dominants in typical habitats, a competition for the
   pollination with species of other families in most cases is megligible.
   Flowering periods of V. vitis-idaea and V.

Abstract = {{Pollinators often sequentially visit one flower type while bypassing
   other equally rewarding flower types in the process. Many explanations
   for this pattern of flower choice in pollinators, known as flower
   constancy, have been proposed; yet, a sufficient answer to the question
   of why pollinators are constant still remains elusive. We tested the
   hypothesis that flower constancy in pollinators is related to the number
   of traits distinguishing available flowers by measuring the floral
   selectivity (both constancy and preference) of bumblebees, Bombus
   impatiens, when artificial flower types differed in either colour only
   (variation in a single trait) or colour and other floral traits
   (variation in multiple traits). As expected, bees showed increased
   degrees of selectivity (constancy and preference) when available flower
   types differed in colour and other floral traits compared with when
   available flower types differed in colour only. In addition, bee
   foraging rates (measured in flowers visited per min) varied inversely
   with the number of variable floral traits added to colour but not with
   the number of colours. Together, these results are consistent with the
   idea that the mechanism underlying flower constancy in bumblebees is a
   limitation on their ability to effectively search for and/or remember
   multiple combinations of floral traits at the same time. We discuss the
   roles of floral-trait variation, flower constancy and pollinator
   cognitive limitations in the coevolution of flowering plants and their

Abstract = {{Pollinators whose foraging habitats consist of several plant types
   (species or morph) may continue to choose the plant type last visited
   because information about the type. of plant last visited dominates over
   all other memory contents, in particular of short-term memory. In this
   study, I extracted this overstrike effect on the plant choices of
   pollinators by analyzing patterns of visitation sequences within a
   single round-trip between the hive and foraging patch (bout). First, I
   simulated the visitation sequences within single bouts with a model to
   show how factors, including the bees' plant-type preferences, the
   arrangement of plants and the effect of overstrike on short-term memory,
   affect visitation sequences. Here, bees are assumed to forage in a patch
   consisting of two plant types (H and L). The model predicts that only
   the effect of overstrike on short-term memory causes assorted visitation
   sequences according to plant type (within-bout flower constancy). That
   is, if the overstrike-effect on short-term memory is the primary
   determinant of plant choice, then bees will fly to a type-L plant after
   visiting a type-L plant even if they predominantly visit type-H plants
   and vice versa. Next, I investigated individual bumblebees' visitation
   sequences at a patch of artificial inflorescences with a set-up similar
   to that assumed in the model. Two types of inflorescences were arranged
   on a Cartesian grid. Assorted visitation sequences according to
   inflorescence type were observed, depending on the distances among
   inflorescences. This result supports the hypotheses that bees fly to the
   same plant type as that last visited because short-term memory is
   displaced (overstruck) with information about the most recently visited
   plant type.}},

Abstract = {{Application of Serenade, a commercial biofungicide formulation

   open blueberry flowers suppresses floral infection by the mummy berry
   fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. The deliberate targeting of the
   stigma with the biocontrol agent in this pathosystem prompted us to
   evaluate potential negative impacts on pollination and
   pollination-related fruit characteristics. Application of Serenade to
   the stigmatic surface of detached blueberry flowers in the laboratory
   had no effect (P > 0.05) on the number of pollen tubes entering the
   style or their growth rates within the stylar canal. There was also no
   reciprocal effect, i.e., population dynamics of B. subtilis were
   unaltered by the presence of pollen. Application of the biocontrol
   product to open flowers, regardless of whether it was done I day before
   or immediately prior to pollination, did not impact fruit set or the
   number of seeds per berry, but marginally (P=0.048) affected fruit
   weight in one of two experimental runs in the greenhouse; fruit weights
   in the two Serenade timing treatments were significantly different from
   each other but neither was different from that of the control that
   received pollen only. In a field experiment in which honey bees were
   utilized to vector the biocontrol product to open flowers, application
   of Serenade did not affect fruit weight but significantly reduced fruit
   set from 49.1 to 38.1\% (P=0.0382) and seed number to about half of that
   of the untreated control (P=0.0109). However, fruit weights and seed
   numbers in the experiment were low even in treatments receiving no
   Serenade, indicative of poor pollination overall. Taken together, these
   results indicate that application of Serenade has no inherently adverse
   effects on pollination and associated fruit characteristics, but caution

Abstract = {{The introduction of exotic species to an island can have significant
   effects on the population density and distribution of native species and
   on the ecological and evolutionary interactions among them (e.g.,
   plant-animal mutualisms). The disruption of these interactions can be
   dramatic, significantly reducing the reproductive success of the species
   and even leading to their extinction. On Menorca Island (Balearic
   Islands, western Mediterranean), we examined the consequences of the
   disruption of the mutualism between two endemic species: a perennial
   shrub, ( Daphne rodriguezii {[}Texidor]) and a frugivorous lizard
   (Podarcis lilfordi {[}Gunther]). The lizard became extinct from this
   island (as well as from Mallorca) as a result of the introduction of
   carnivorous mammals, which has continued since Roman times. The relict
   mutualism between D. rodriguezii and the lizard currently persists only
   in an islet (60 ha) where P. lilfordi is still abundant. We hypothesized
   that the absence of this lizard from most Menorcan populations is the
   factor causing the regression of this plant, currently considered at
   risk of extinction. Through observation and experimentation in the field
   and laboratory, we found strong evidence that a lack of seed dispersal
   in Menorca is the main cause of the low seedling recruitment. First, the
   population with greatest seedling recruitment was that in the islet
   where lizards were abundant. Second, lizards appeared to be the only
   dispersers of D. rodriguezii. Lizards consumed large amounts of fruits,
   without affecting either germination or seedling growth, and moved seeds
   to sites suitable for plant establishment. Seedlings in Menorca, in
   contrast, recruited almost exclusively under the parent plants. Third,
   the effect of other factors that may influence plant population growth
   (a low fruit set and a high postdispersal seed predation) was similar
   between the islet and the Menorcan populations. To our knowledge, our
   results are the first that quantitatively show that a biological
   invasion can cause a disruption of a specialized plant-vertebrate
   mutualism that sets the plant partner on the road to extinction.}},

Abstract = {{We followed the daily and seasonal foraging patterns of the solitary bee

   During the foraging season, the bees exhibited a clear bimodal daily

   We found that snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus L.) was a major source of

   significantly higher during the morning activity period of P. olivieri
   than during mid-day. Bees of numerous other species foraged on
   snapdragon, but their activity periods hardly overlapped with P.
   olivieri. Foraging activity in P. olivieri was highest at a combination
   of high (25-35 degrees C) temperatures and low (1-100 Lux) illumination
   levels. We suggest that P. ofivieri benefits from foragirig at dawn and
   dusk on snapdragon, and possibly additional food plants, because of
   exploitation of the large amounts of nectar produced. A nectar
   enrichment experiment revealed that P. olivieri does not cease foraging
   because of lack of available nectar. We suggest that the P. olivieri's
   ability to fly at low light levels enables it to dominate a unique
   foraging niche.}},

Abstract = {{The repeated evolutionary transition from outcrossing to
   self-pollination in flowering plants has been suggested to occur because
   selfing provides reproductive assurance. Reports from biogeographical
   and ecological surveys indicate that selfing taxa are often associated
   with stressful and ephemeral environments, situations in which plant
   abundance is low (e.g., Baker's law) and with novel plant communities,
   however experimental tests of ecological hypotheses are few. In this
   study, we examined the ecological context of selection on mating system
   traits (herkogamy and protandry) in a California annual, Clarkia
   xantiana, where natural selfing populations differ from outcrossing
   populations in that they are often of small size or low density and
   occur mainly outside the range of pollinator-sharing congeners. We
   constructed artificial populations of plants with broad genetic
   variation in floral traits and manipulated two ecological factors, plant
   population size, and the presence versus absence of pollinator-sharing
   congeners, in the center of the geographic range of outcrossing
   populations. We found evidence for context-dependent selection on
   herkogamy and protandry via female fitness in which reduced traits,
   which promote autonomous selfing, were favored in small populations
   isolated from congeners whereas selection was comparatively weak in
   large populations or when congeners were present. In small, isolated
   populations, the fertility of plants with low herkogamy or protandry was
   elevated by 66\% and 58\%, respectively, compared to those with high
   herkogamy or protandry. The presence of pollinator-sharing congeners
   augmented bee visitation rates to C. xantiana flowers by 47\% for all
   bees and by 93\% for pollen specialists. By facilitating pollinator
   visitation, congeners mitigated selection on mating system traits in
   small populations, where outcross mating success is often low (the Allee
   effect). We also found support for the hypothesis that pollinator
   availability directly influenced variation in the strength of selection
   on herkogamy among populations. The striking parallels between our
   experimental results and patterns of variation in ecological factors
   across the geographic range of outcrossing and selfing populations
   suggest that reproductive assurance may play a central role in directing
   mating system evolution in C. xantiana.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{245-254}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Most flowering plants display multiple flowers, so that the
   interaction with pollinators that determines their mating success can
   vary with both the characteristics of individual flowers and aggregate
   properties of the entire floral display, especially the number of open
   flowers (floral display size). These effects are seldom examined in
   concert and their collective consequences for interspecific differences
   in reproductive performance have not been considered previously.
   2. In this paper, we characterize the relation of pollen removal and
   seed production to differences in floral and inflorescence
   characteristics among six species of herbaceous legumes (Fabaceae).
   3. Several aspects of reproductive performance varied significantly
   among species with either plant traits or aspects of pollinator
   behaviour that depend on plant traits. Pollinator visitation, as
   measured by the ratio of pollen removal during 24 h to first-visit
   removal, varied positively with both nectar production per flower and
   floral display size. Bumble-bees visited more flowers per inflorescence
   on species with large floral displays, with no increase in the
   proportion of flowers visited. Pollen removal during a flower's first
   visit varied negatively among species with the mean number of flowers
   visited by bees per inflorescence.
   4. These results indicate that floral and inflorescence traits act
   together to influence both pollinator energetics, which affects a plant
   species' attractiveness, and the rate of pollen removal, which should
   affect pollen export. In contrast, neither pollen removal during 24 h,
   nor female fecundity varied significantly with floral or display
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotropical stingless bee Melipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier was
   evaluated for pollinating tomatoes (variety Rodas; long-life hybrid) in
   greenhouses under plastic and with a hydroponic system and ``organic
   concepts{''} in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Flowers not pollinated did
   not set any fruit. Pollination by bees plus manual pollination did Dot
   differ from either bee or manual pollination. Maximum fruit diameter,
   fruit height, and roundness (quotient between maximum fruit diameter and
   fruit height) were not significantly different between treatments, but
   fruit visited by M. quadrifasciata had 10.8\% less seeds (dry mass) than
   manual pollination. This apparently low efficiency of M. quadrifasciata
   pollination was attributed to the overlap of only 30 min between highest
   bee foraging activity and highest flower stigma receptivity. Thus, it
   was concluded that M. quadrifasciata is a feasible pollinator of
   greenhouse tomatoes because of 1) the observed increase in fruit quality
   with lower mechanical injury than traditional manual pollination, 2) no
   significant decrease in fruit size, and 3) high price of such product in
   the market. Some considerations for sustainable use of M. quadrifasciata
   as greenhouse pollinator are presented. Although techniques for keeping
   captive colonies of M. quadrifasciata are currently available, the sole
   current method for acquiring new colonies is removing them from the
   forest, and if demand was created for large numbers of colonies for
   commercial use, techniques for captive rearing must be developed to
   prevent serious declines in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999, bees were sampled from several flowering individuals of the
   leguminous tree, Andira inermis (Papilionoideae), at two sites in
   northwestern Guanacaste Province of Costa Rica. One site, city outskirts
   of Liberia, was experiencing steady encroachment of human development,
   whereas the other was a moderately impacted cattle ranch/wildland area
   near the small town of Bagaces. A standardized method was employed to
   sample the bees, which had been used previously in 1996 in the same tree
   populations at the same two sites (Frankie et al., 1997).
   Results of the 1999 samples were compared with those taken in 1996 to
   examine possible changes in bee diversity and abundance. During this
   three-year period, El Nino and La Nina climatic events had occurred
   back-to-back, and this combination of weather patterns provided an
   opportunity to evaluate possible short-term changes in the bee taxa that
   use A. inermis as one of their preferred host plants. Other bee host
   plants at both sites were also surveyed for seasonal flowering, the
   results of which formed a broader context for assessing the A. inermis
   bee samples.
   The comparison revealed the follwing. 1) The composition of bees had
   changed with reductions in large bees from 1996 to 1999; most noticeably
   some anthophorids and especially Centris and Epicharis. Africanized
   honey bees and smaller bee taxa remained about the same in composition
   and overall abundance. 2) During El Nino and La Nina years from mid 1997
   through early 1999, the flowering of key resources for large bees,
   especially Byrsonima crassifolia, was substantially delayed (and
   sometimes reduced) to the point where building and provisioning of bee
   nests was likely reduced, which apparently led to declines in large bee
   taxa. Other possible causes of decline, including increasing
   agricultural development in the region, are also discussed. 3) Intertree
   variation in attraction of bees to A. inermis was documented in both
   1999 and 1996, but persistence of this variable attraction on the same
   individual trees could be only partially evaluated in 1999. The
   flowering pattern(s) of individual A. inermis trees has proved to be
   highly variable within and between the two study sites.}},

Abstract = {{White clover is a weed in apple orchards that competes with the crop;
   also, flowers of this weed are unwanted attractants of honey bees at
   times when insecticides, which are harmful to these pollinators, are
   being applied. In 1997 and 1998, white clover flower head and plant
   control by clopyralid alone and with 2,4-D and apple tolerance to these
   herbicides were determined. Treatments consisted of clopyralid at 0.10
   and 0.21 kg ae/ha, 2,4-D at I.] kg ae/ha, and 2,4-D at 1.1 kg ac/ha plus
   0.03 or 0.05 kg ae/ha clopyralid, which were applied 2 wk before full
   apple bloom and 2 wk after full apple bloom, and a nontreated check. No
   crop injury occurred with any treatment. All herbicide treatments
   provided some white clover control and flower head suppression. No
   differences in white clover bloom reduction were observed through May
   among treatments containing clopyralid. As summer progressed, the effect
   of clopyralid rate became more apparent. Clopyralid at 0.21, regardless
   of application time, provided 99\% vegetative control and 100\% flower
   head reduction through July. Clopyralid plus 2,4-D controlled white
   clover better than 2,4-D alone. However, vegetative control and flower
   head reduction with clopyralid at reduced rates (0.03 or 0.05 kg ae/ha)
   plus 2,4-D were not acceptable (76\% or less and 78\% or less,
   respectively). Thus, clopyralid at 0.10 and 0.21 kg ae/ha will be
   necessary for acceptable white clover vegetation control and flower head
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Meaningful ecological studies on insect communities require sampling
   protocols that take into consideration temporal fluctuations in
   abundance and species composition. Bees with their specific requirements
   for nutrition and nesting are good indicators of landscape structure and
   overall biodiversity, provided the ecological and seasonal patterns they
   show are taken into consideration. The present two year study traced the
   ecological and seasonal patterns on 2 km(2) of a southern slope in the
   Swiss Alps, ranging from 1150 to 1550 in above sea level. The study area
   consisted mainly of grassland under different regimes, mostly hay
   meadows and pastures. By direct netting at five monthly intervals in
   each year a total of 247 bee species were recorded. This comprehensive
   sampling scheme identified one of the most diverse bee faunas in Central
   and Northern Europe, consisting of a statistically estimated 280
   species. Most species were rare with 14.6\% represented by a single
   individual. Ecological analysis of the bee community showed that the
   primitively eusocial species were over represented among the abundant
   species and the parasitic species among the rarest.
   Both abundance and species richness were subject to marked seasonal
   variations. A substantial turnover in species composition as well as
   changes in ecological patterns were observed. More than 25\% of all
   species were recorded in only one of the two years, in particular many
   of the parasitic species. Singletons accounted for a higher proportion
   when individual years rather than the pooled data were analysed. All
   these findings underline the importance of season-long sampling and
   sampling over more than one year if bees are to be used as indicators in

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims The gynoecium of the domestic apple, Malus x
   domestica, has been assumed to be imperfectly syncarpic, whereby
   pollination of each stigmatic surface can result in fertilization within
   only one of the five carpels. Despite its implied effect on fruit
   quantity and quality, the resulting influence of flower form on seed set
   and distribution within the apple fruit has seldom been investigated.
   Instead, poor fruit quality is usually attributed to problems with
   pollination, such as low bee numbers and/or ineffective pollinators
   within apple agro-ecosystems. The objective of this study was to
   determine the true nature of gynoecial structure and its influence on
   fruit production in the apple cultivar `Summerland McIntosh'.
   Methods A stigma-excision method was used to determine the effects of
   uneven pollination among the five stigmas on fruit quantity (as measured
   by fruit set), and quality (seed number and distribution). In addition,
   flowers were examined microscopically to determine pollen tube pathways.
   Key Results Fruit set, seed number, seed distribution, and the
   microscopic examination of flower gynoecial structure reported in this
   study indicated that the gynoecium of the cultivar Summerland McIntosh
   is perfectly syncarpic and not imperfectly syncarpic as previously
   thought.
   Conclusions Pollination levels among the five stigmas need not be
   uniform to obtain full seed development within Summerland McIntosh
   fruit; even if one stigmatic surface is adequately pollinated, a full
   complement of seeds is likely. The importance of perfect syncarpy in
   recognizing true causes of poor fruit quality in apple is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Many bumblebee (Bombus) species are thought to have declined in
   abundance in the last 50 years, while a small number of species remain
   abundant. Here we examine which factors render some British bumblebee
   species more susceptible to environmental change than others. We present
   forage data on workers of 15 bumblebee species gathered from 172 one
   hour searches conducted at sites in southern UK, the Hebrices (western
   Scotland) and in New Zealand (to which UK bumblebees were introduced).
   We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of
   these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source
   for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging
   species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus
   specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of
   bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge
   of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more
   sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species
   is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich
   grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that
   remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in
   the season and have less specialized diets: these species are very
   common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad
   range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly
   associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have
   probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species
   are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are
   not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their
   geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined. Much of the
   ecology of rare bumblebee species remains poorly understood and in need
   of further study. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The introgression of genes from exotic species or populations into gene
   pools of native species is a widespread concern in agricultural systems.
   This is also an issue of increasing importance in forest systems as
   there has been a dramatic expansion of tree plantations, which have now
   reached 180 million ha globally. This has recently occurred in Australia
   with eucalypts. To help assess the risk of genetic pollution, we assess
   the pattern of realised pollen dispersal from exotic Eucalyptus nitens
   plantations into native E. ovata forest in Tasmania. We assessed the
   frequency of F(1) hybrids in open-pollinated seed collected from native
   E. ovata trees located at varying distance from three exotic E. nitens
   plantations in Tasmania. Over 119,000 seedlings were screened for
   morphological markers diagnostic of each species and the F(1) hybrid.
   F(1) hybridisation averaged 7.2\% within 100 m of the exotic E. nitens,
   with one native tree reaching 56\%, but diminished to 0.7\% by 200 - 300
   m and continued at this low level to the limits of the sampling at 1.6

   distance followed a power function with a negative exponent (\% F(1) =
   91.435distance(-0.789); R(2) = 0.84). Eucalyptus nitens is exclusively
   pollinated by small insects ( smaller than honeybees), which the study
   shows can disperse pollen over 1.6 km. However, the restriction of most
   exotic F(1) hybridisation to within 200 m of exotic plantations presents
   clear opportunities to manage the genetic impacts of plantations on

   siphilitica, which co-occur in wet meadows of central and eastern North
   America, produce blue zygomorphic flowers, and share several species of
   bumble bee pollinators. To test for effects of competition for
   pollination, we planted experimental arrays of Mimulus ringens, each
   consisting of genets with unique combinations of homozygous marker
   genotypes. In two arrays we planted mixtures of Mimulus and Lobelia. and
   in two additional arrays we planted Mimulus without a competitor for
   pollination. Bumble bee pollinators frequently moved between Mimulus and
   Lobelia flowers in the mixed-species arrays, with 42\% of plant-to-plant
   movements being interspecific transitions. Pollinator movements between
   species were associated with a reduction in the amount of conspecific
   pollen arriving on Mimulus stigmas. The presence of Lobelia led to a
   significant 37\% reduction in the mean number of Mimulus seeds per
   fruit. In addition, Mimulus had a significantly lower rate of
   outcrossing in the mixed-species arrays (0.43) than in the ``pure{''}

Abstract = {{Because the range boundary is the locale beyond which a taxon fails to
   persist, it provides a unique opportunity for studying the limits on
   adaptive evolution. Adaptive constraints on range expansion are
   perplexing in view of widespread ecotypic differentiation by habitat and
   region within a species' range (regional adaptation) and rapid
   evolutionary response to novel environments. In this Study of two
   parapatric subspecies, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana and C. x. ssp.
   parviflora, we compared the fitness of population transplants within
   their native region, in a non-native region within the native range, and
   in the non-native range to assess whether range expansion might be
   limited by a greater intensity of selection on colonists of a new range
   versus a new region within the range. The combined range of the two
   subspecies spans a west-to-east gradient of declining precipitation in
   the Sierra Nevada of California, with ssp. xantiana in the west being
   replaced by ssp. parviflora in the east. Both Subspecies had
   significantly higher fitness in the native range (range adaptation),
   whereas regional adaptation was weak and was found only in the
   predominantly outcrossing ssp. xantiana but was absent in the inbreeding
   ssp. parviflora. Because selection intensity on transplants was Much
   stronger in the non-native range relative to non-native regions, there
   is a larger adaptive barrier to range versus regional expansion. Three
   of five sequential fitness components accounted for regional and range
   adaptation, but only one of them, survivorship from germination to
   flowering, contributed to both. Flower number contributed to regional
   adaptation in ssp. xantiana and fruit Set (number of fruits per flower)
   to range adaptation. Differential survivorship of the two taxa or
   regional Populations of ssp. xantiana in non-native environments was
   attributable. in part, to biotic interactions, including competition,
   herbivory, and pollination. For example. low fruit set in ssp. xantiana
   in the east was likely due to the absence of its principal specialist
   bee pollinators in ssp. parviflora's range. Thus, convergence on
   self-fertilization may be necessary for ssp. xantiana to invade ssp.

Abstract = {{Loss of suitable habitat has historically been the primary threat to
   Wenatchee Mountains checker-mallow (Sidalcea oregana var. calva), a
   narrow endemic of Chelan County, Washington. The largest population of
   this federally listed endangered species is now protected from loss by
   Natural Area Preserve status, yet the survival of the plant is still in
   jeopardy. Possible threats to population growth and persistence include
   seed predation by weevils, succession in meadow habitats due to fire
   suppression, and loss of pollinator populations. This two-year
   exploratory study examined these threats in an effort to determine their
   relative impacts on the species and to guide future study. Macrorhoptus
   sidalceae, a Sidalcea specialist insect was identified as a primary seed
   predator. Seed predation by this weevil was severe; only 17\% of seeds
   examined escaped weevil predation across all study sites. Few
   significant differences were found in prescribed burn experiments
   designed to determine effects of fire on checker-mallow individuals and
   on the surrounding herbaceous community. This may indicate that the
   species is not detrimentally affected by fire, and that prescribed fire
   may be a valuable management tool for habitat conservation. A second
   Sidalcea specialist insect, the bee Diadasia nigrifrons, was observed to
   be a consistent flower visitor and possibly important pollinator of the
   checker-mallow. These results have implications for future study and
   management of both the checker-mallow and other endangered species,

Abstract = {{The nests used in this study were obtained from trap-nests (tubes of
   cardboard and cut bamboo stems) placed on Santa Carlota Farm (Itaoca
   Section-IS, Santana Section-SS and Cerrado-Ce), Cajuru, SP, Brazil. The
   number of nests and corresponding species obtained were as follows: 5 16
   nests of T. curvitarsis, 104 of T. rugulosa, 399 of T. diversipes and 98
   of T. garofedoi. The most abundant species from SS and Cc was T.
   curvitarsis, and from IS it was T. diversipes. In general, most nests
   were collected during the hot and wet season (September to April). The
   nests were constructed with sand and an oily substance, and a single
   female established them. The cells were constructed in a linear series,
   sometimes followed by a vestibular cell. The number of brood cells
   ranged from I to 10 in T. curvitarsis (n=200), and in T. garofuloi (n =
   51), from 1 to 8 (n = 30) in T. rugulosa, and from 1 to 6 (n = 37) in T.
   diversipes. The pollen mass (pollen + oily substance) contained a
   hollow, sometimes divided by a transverse ridge, on the exposed face of
   the pollen mass. The egg was vertically positioned in the lower part of
   the hollow. At times, the closing of a cell was initiated before
   provisioning was completed, with a construction of a collar at the cell
   limit. In sonic nests the final cellular partition also acted as a
   closure plug. Females began activities at 6: 19 a.m. and ended between
   3:31 and 6:26 p.m. Some females (T. curviteirsis, T. rugulosa and T.
   garofaloi) did not spend the nights at their nests, returning to them
   only the following morning with additional material. In general, the
   development period (for males and females) was greater in nests
   collected near the end of the hot and wet season than it was for nests
   collected in other months. Sex ratios for each species were as follows:
   T. curvitarsis, 1: 1; T. rugulosa, 1.6:1 female; T. diversipes, 1.9:1 T.
   garqfaloi, 2.8:1. Males and females of T. diversipes exhibited
   statistically similar sizes and in the other three species the females
   were larger than the males. The mortality rates were statistically
   similar: 33.2\% for T. curvilarsis, 25.8\% for T. rugulosa, 26.8\% for
   T. diversipes and 38.2\% for T. garofaloi. The parasitoids were:
   Coelioxoidcs e-vuhms, Leticospis cayenensis, Anthrax sp., Coelioxi sp.,
   Coelioxoides sp. and individuals of the family Meloidae.}},

Abstract = {{We performed field experiments to measure the relative importance of
   olfactory and visual cues in nectar foraging by wild tobacco hornworm
   moths, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera, Sphingaidae) in the Sonoran Desert of
   Arizona, U.S.A. We manipulated flowers of sacred Datura (Datura
   wrightii; Solanaceae) to experimentally decouple floral scent from
   visual display and presented these cues to free-flying moths in mixed
   and homogeneous arrays. Moths did not feed from cloth-bagged fragrant
   flowers lacking strong visual contrast, nor did they feed from paper
   model flowers lacking plant odours. Unexpectedly, moths fed from paper
   model flowers that were associated solely with vegetative odours, albeit
   at lower levels than when floral scent was present. Subsequent
   experiments revealed that the combination of floral and vegetative
   odours did not incrementally increase nectar feeding and that floral
   scent without vegetation was sufficient to elicit feeding when paper
   flowers were present. Thus, wild M. sexta in our study did not show
   generalized feeding responses to natural or artificial flowers with
   single sensory stimuli; like naive laboratory-reared moths, they
   required a combination of visual and olfactory cues. However, given the
   prior foraging experience of our study population on Datura flowers,
   their lack of generalized feeding responses may reflect a learned
   preference for the full complement of floral cues, rather than the
   persistence of innate sensory constraints. Future efforts to distinguish
   between these hypotheses should focus on whether M. sexta can be
   conditioned to associate nectar with visual cues alone, and whether
   moths that feed ad libitum from nectar-rich plants learn floral
   attributes as a search image or generalize to single-modality stimuli.}},

Volume = {{95}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flowers are relatively invariant organs within
   species, but quantitative variation often exists among conspecifics.
   These variations represent the raw material that natural selection can
   magnify, eventually resulting in morphological divergence and
   diversification. This paper investigates floral variability in
   Rosmarinus officinalis. a Mediterranean shrub.
   Methods Nine populations were selected in three major southern Spanish
   habitats (coast, lowland and mountains) along an elevation gradient.
   Flower samples from randomly chosen plants were collected from each
   population, and a total of 641 flowers from 237 shrubs were weighed
   while still fresh to the nearest 0.1 mg. Leaves from the same plants
   were also measured. Variations among habitats, sites and plants were
   explored with general linear model ANOVA. Leaf-flower covariation was
   also investigated.
   Key Results Most (58\%) mass in flowers was accounted for by the
   corolla, whose linear dimensions correlated directly with flower mass.
   Averaged over plants, the mass of a flower varied between 12 mg and 38
   mg. Habitat, site (within habitat) and shrub identity had significant
   effects on mass variance. Flowers from the coast were the smallest (17
   mg) and those from the mountains the largest (25 mg on average). A
   pattern of continuously increasing flower size with elevation emerged
   which was largely uncoupled from the geographical pattern of leaf size
   variation.
   Conclusions As regards flower size, a great potential to local
   differentiation exists in Rosmarinus. Observed divergences accord with a
   regime of large-bodied pollinator selection in the mountains, but also
   with resource-cost hypotheses on floral evolution that postulate that
   reduced corollas are advantageous under prevailingly stressful
   conditions. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{The stingless bee Melipona rufiventris is an important pollinator in

   isoenzyme data for a better understanding of the genetic structure of
   several M. rufiventris colonies. Samples of 35 colonies were collected
   from 12 localities and evaluated by nine enzymatic systems, which
   yielded 17 loci. M. rufiventris genetic variation was found to be low,
   typical of an endangered species. The proportion of polymorphic loci was
   5.88\% in both ecosystems. Only Est-4 was polymorphic in colonies from
   the Forest and Mdh-1 in colonies from the Cerrado. The expected
   heterozygosity ranged from 0.0068 in the Cerrado to 0.0078 in the
   Forest. Despite this, enzyme electrophoretic analyses provided a good
   idea of the diversity between samples from Cerrado and Forest which

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and the intensification of farming practices have caused
   severe declines in the range and abundance of many bumblebee species in
   the UK. This study examines the long-term effectiveness of four
   different management strategies to enhance and restore bumblebee
   foraging habitat on arable field margins in two regions with markedly
   contrasting landscape structure, farming systems and amount of
   semi-natural habitat. Bumblebees were monitored on 120 field margins in
   July and August, together with estimates of flower abundance and the
   vegetation composition. There were no differences in the abundance and
   diversity of the bumblebee assemblage between the two regions (East
   Anglia and the West Midlands), despite a greater abundance of flowers
   and flowering species on the lighter soils of the West Midlands. Very
   few bumblebees were recorded on intensively managed cereal field margins
   due to the lack of dicot species. Conservation headlands supported a
   significantly greater number of flowering dicots, but the majority of
   these were annuals which did not provide good forage for bumblebees.
   From an agronomic and ecological perspective, the removal of field
   margins from the cropping system was the best strategy for providing
   foraging habitat for bumblebees. Non-crop habitat resulting from natural
   regeneration provided good foraging habitat for bumblebee species, but
   most of the key forage species were pernicious weeds of agriculture
   (Cirsium spp.). Sowing non-crop field margins with wildlife seed
   mixtures had the potential for providing the best foraging habitat for
   bumblebees, so long as preferred forage species were introduced (e.g.
   Trifolium pratense). Further research is required to refine and target
   this management prescription for bumblebee conservation in the wider
   countryside. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oligolectic bees collect pollen from one or a few closely related
   species of plants, whereas polylectic bees visit a variety of flowers
   for pollen. Because of their more restricted range of host plants, it
   maybe expected that specialists exist in smaller, more isolated
   populations, with lower effective population sizes than generalists.
   Consequently, we hypothesized that oligolectic bees have reduced levels
   of genetic variation relative to related polylectic species. To test
   this hypothesis, we used five phylogenetically independent pairs of
   species in which one member was oligolectic and the other was
   polylectic. We assayed genetic variation in our species pairs at an
   average of 32 allozyme loci. Within each species pair, the oligolectic
   member had fewer polymorphic loci, lower average allelic richness, and
   lower average expected heterozygosity than its polylectic relative.
   Averaged over all species pairs, this corresponds to a 21\% reduction in
   allelic richness, a 72\% reduction in the proportion of polymorphic
   loci, and an 83\% reduction in expected heterozygosity in specialists
   compared with generalists. Our data support the hypothesis of reduced
   effective population size in oligolectic bees and suggest that they may
   be more prone to extinction as a result. We suggest that in instances in
   which bee specialists are involved in mutually codependent relationships
   with their floral hosts, these mutualisms may be endangered for genetic
   and ecological reasons.}},

Abstract = {{Human enterprise is increasingly affecting biodiversity beyond outright
   species losses, causing changes in ecosystem functions and the services
   they deliver to human beings. However, few tools are available to
   analyze how community attributes other than simple species richness
   affect ecosystem functioning, or how relative contribution to the
   function is distributed among the species within a community. Here, we
   adapted methods for describing the evenness in relative abundance among
   species (i.e., community structure) to the description of the evenness
   in species' relative contribution to ecosystem function (i.e.,
   functional structure). We developed graphical approaches to: (1)
   describe the functional structure, (2) show the relationship between
   community and functional structures, (3) examine the influence of
   species identity on, ecosystem function, and the relationship between
   species' relative functional contribution and relative abundance, and
   (4) determine the effects of management on the total magnitude of
   ecosystem function, on community and functional structures, and on
   individual species' contribution to the function.
   We applied these methods to two contrasting ecosystem function cases:
   watermelon pollination by native bees in California and carbon storage
   in trees of a tropical humid forest in Chiapas, Mexico. Functional
   structure for pollination under organic management within a conserved
   forest matrix showed that the first two species contributed 80\% of the
   function. Increasingly intensive management (e.g., conventional
   agriculture) caused the loss of 60\% of the species, reductions in
   abundance of functionally important species, loss of 60-80\% of the
   pollination function, and decreased evenness in functional structure.
   Functional structure for carbon storage of a conserved forest showed
   that 13\% of species contributed 90\% of the function. Forest under a
   hypothetical scenario of selective timber extraction showed a loss of
   60\% of carbon storage, no species loss, and an increase in evenness of
   the species' contribution to the function. Compared to conserved forest,
   secondary forests shared only 17\% of species, 80\% less carbon storage,
   but similar evenness of species' contribution to this function.
   Overall, the tools developed here, and their applications, show that
   impacts of management regimes on functional. structure vary with the
   analyzed function and ecosystem, differentially affecting species
   richness, species composition, dominance of the first-ranked species,
   evenness in species' functionality, and potentially the stability of the
   function itself.}},

Abstract = {{Negative effects of habitat fragmentation are thought to be diminished
   when habitat patches are joined by a corridor. A key assumption is that
   corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise
   isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be
   important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants
   that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase
   the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby
   increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by
   butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia
   hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 >= 1-ha
   patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each
   of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor
   (150 x 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the
   area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape
   also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might
   function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors
   increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits
   between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors
   function by ``capturing{''} organisms dispersing through the matrix,
   redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent
   powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies
   between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than
   between unconnected patches (all values mean +/- 1 SE: 59\% +/- 9.2\%
   vs. 25\% +/- 5.2\% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen
   transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected
   patches than between unconnected patches (30\% +/- 4.2\% vs. 14.5\% +/-
   2.2\%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There
   was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To
   generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of
   pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 x
   75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with
   respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer
   probability on the scale of our previous experiment. These results
   suggest that corridors facilitate pollen transfer in fragmented
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological consequences of disruptions in plant-pollinator
   mutualisms are poorly understood. We examined how seed production and
   recruitment of juveniles in populations of the spectacular grassland
   geophyte Brunsvigia radulosa (Amaryllidaceae) correlate with various
   indices of habitat fragmentation, including habitat fragment area,
   population size and population isolation. The species was found to be
   self-incompatible and adapted for pollination primarily by the
   long-proboscid fly Philoliche aethiopica (Tabanidae). In places where
   this fly is locally extinct, carpenter bees appear to act as substitute,
   though less effective, pollinators. Seed production in B. radulosa
   showed a significant positive relationship with population size, but not
   with habitat fragment area or spatial isolation of populations when all
   three indices of habitat fragmentation were included as predictor
   variables in multiple regression models. Reduced seed production in
   small populations was attributable to pollen limitation, as supplemental
   hand pollinations resulted in proportionally greater increases in seed
   production in these populations. Pollen limitation appears to have
   demographic consequences; specifically, the proportion of juvenile
   plants in populations showed significant positive relationships with
   current levels of seed production per plant and size of populations.
   Thus the long term persistence of small B. radulosa populations in
   habitat fragments may be threatened by a pollination deficit.}},

Abstract = {{Comparative studies on pollination biology of two floral morphs in
   Alpinia hainanensis were carried out in Hainan Province and Guangzhou,
   Guangdong Province, southern China. Populations of A. hainanensis have
   two floral morphs and the behaviors of stylar movements in the two
   floral morphs are similar to those found in other species of Alpinia
   previously reported. However, the stylar movement behavior of the
   cataflexistylous morph is 2 h slower than that of the anaflexistylous
   morph. There are some asynchronous stylar movements on the same floral
   morph, even on the same inflorescence. Yet, all anthers of the
   anaflexistylous floral morphs dehisce only after all stigmas of the same
   phenotype have moved out of the receptive position, viz., above the
   anthers. Our results indicate that the anaflexistylous morph has more
   pollen grains per flower, higher pollen/ovule ratio (P/O), and larger
   nectar volume than the cataflexistylous morph, while approximately equal
   ovule numbers, sugar and amino acid concentration. Field experiments
   indicate that the fruit sets are significantly high in both artificially
   out-crossed and self-pollinated flowers, while no fruit set was observed
   in bagged emasculated flowers and the unpollinated bagged flowers. These
   facts exhibit that A. hainanensis is self-compatible and there is no
   self-pollination and agamospermy in the species. There are significant
   differences in the fruit sets among the anaflexistylous flowers with
   hand-pollination treatments at different times during the day, but not
   in the cataflexistylous flowers. The fruit set by hand pollination is
   much higher than that under natural condition. This means that A.
   hainanensis is dependent upon insects for pollination, and insufficiency
   of pollinators limited fruit set under natural condition. The effective
   pollinators were Ameglla sp. and two species of carpenter bees (Xylocopa
   sp.). However, only fewer insects at a lower frequency visited flowers
   of A. hainanensis in nature. The breeding system of A. hainanensis is
   xenogamy with flexistyly.}},

Abstract = {{Although poppies ( Papaver somniferum L.) are one of the oldest
   cultivated plants relatively little is known of their pollination
   biology. We have investigated the relative importance of wind and
   insects in the pollination of poppies and identified potential insect
   pollinators. Wind pollination was found to be negligible, insect
   pollination was responsible for the majority of out-crossing, and
   self-pollination was the dominant mode of poppy fertilisation. Honeybees
   and flies were identified as the main potential cross-pollinators of
   Tasmanian poppies. Using a transgenic poppy field trial in which
   approximately 50\% of the pollen grains produced were transgenic, we
   have determined the level of pollen-mediated gene flow by scoring over
   50 000 seeds for the presence of a selectable marker gene. Gene flow was
   measured using a 10-m buffer area that surrounded the field trial. It
   was highest at 0.1 m with 3.26\% of seeds found to be transgenic and
   declined over distance with 1.73\% transgenic seeds at 0.5 m, 1.80\% at
   1 m, 0.86\% at 2m, 0.34\% at 5 m, 0.12\% at 9 m, and 0.18\% at 10 m.
   These results demonstrate that under Tasmanian conditions,

   related to pollinator castes, and reproductive isolation and efficiency

Abstract = {{Proponents of importation of the European bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (

   that this species will have little impact on Australian native
   ecosystems because it prefers to forage on flowers of introduced species
   of plants rather than Australian native plants. However, data presented
   as evidence of preference for introduced plants have been equivocal.
   This study compared the attractiveness of introduced and Australian
   native plants to free- foraging B. terrestris in a garden at the
   interface between an urban area and native vegetation in the Australian
   island of Tasmania, where a feral population of B. terrestris had been
   established for over 10 years. No evidence was found to support the
   proposal that B. terrestris forages on flowers of introduced plants in
   preference to those of Australian native plants. The numbers of B.
   terrestris seen foraging per 1000 flowers did not differ significantly
   between introduced plants and Australian native plants, and the
   preferred food sources of B. terrestris included flowers of both
   introduced and Australian native species. Because B. terrestris forages
   frequently on many species of both introduced and native plants,
   assessments of its ecological impacts must include the effects of
   altered pollination on recruitment rates in both introduced weeds and

Abstract = {{In situations of aggressive mimicry, predators adapt their color to that

   Females of few crab-spider species encounter such situations when lying
   on flowers to ambush pollinators. To evaluate the efficiency of spider
   camouflage on flowers, we measured by spectroradiometry adult female
   Thomisus onustus and marguerite daisies, Leucanthemum vulgare. We
   compared chromatic contrast (color used for short-range detection) of
   each pair of spider and flower to detection thresholds computed in the
   visual systems of both Hymenopteran prey and passerine bird predator. We
   also computed achromatic contrast (brightness) used for long-range
   detection. In both visual systems, each individual spider was
   efficiently matching the precise color of the flower center on which it
   was hunting. Being significantly darker than flowers, crab-spiders could
   in theory be detected at long range by either predator or prey using
   achromatic contrast. However, long-range detection is unlikely, owing to
   small spider size. Spiders also generated significant chromatic and
   achromatic contrasts to both Hymenoptera and bird when moving on flower
   periphery. Our study is the first to identify which photoreceptors of

   terrestris was more flower constant, and predominantly outperformed B

   larger bees are more efficient at nectar foraging, i.e. they bring home
   more nectar per unit time. However B pascourum, the least flower
   constant of the three species tested, was the most efficient of them at
   collecting nectar, collecting 50\% more nectar than B terrestris per

Abstract = {{Our research assesses the feasibility of using artificial selection on
   pre-mating floral traits to modify the mating system of faba bean (Vicia
   faba). This analysis considered two synthetic populations, which were
   derived from different genetic pools and had undergone five years of
   multiplication. For these populations, we identified floral and
   inflorescence traits that influence outcrossing per plant and examined
   the relative importance of these traits in governing yield. Codominant
   isozyme loci and the mixed-mating model were used to estimate the
   multilocus female outcrossing rate. A maternal half-sib design was used
   to evaluate the additive genetic component of floral and inflorescence
   traits, yield and yield components. Multiple regression was used to
   assess the effects of floral and inflorescence traits on outcrossing and
   yield and components of yield. The two populations exhibited mixing
   mating. Self-fertilization appears to result from the action of
   pollinating bees, so that its incidence could be modified by selection
   on floral and inflorescence traits that affect pollination. Floral and
   inflorescence traits affected individual differences in outcrossing
   unequally, with most variation being associated with the numbers of
   displayed flowers and inflorescences. Variation among plants in reward
   traits and in shape, although statistically significant, had limited and
   inconsistent influences on individual differences in outcrossing. Yield
   and its components varied strongly with aspects of floral display and,
   to a lesser extent, floral design, except for seed weight. Overall, our
   results imply that both outcrossing and yield could be enhanced by
   selection for plants that produce more inflorescences, each with
   relatively few flowers.}},

   switching of preference reflected the changes in the relative floral
   densities of these species along the snowmelt gradients. The frequency
   of bumblebee movements from P aleutica to P caerulea flowers increased
   at late-snowmelt plots, whereas that from P caerulea to P. aleutica
   flowers decreased at late-snowmelt plots. Thus, the risk of
   heterospecific pollen receipt increased in P caerulea but decreased in P
   aleutica from early- to late-snowmelt habitats. Phyllodoce caerulea
   showed similar seed-set rates among conspecific, heterospecific and

   that there is no mechanism to avoid hybridization at P aleutica pollen.
   On the other hand, P aleutica pollinated with P. caerulea pollen showed
   a very low seed set in comparison with that pollinated with conspecific
   pollen in early- and middle-snowmelt plots. However, the seed set of P

   Zygomorphic flowers are known to orient vertically. We conducted field

   vertically like other zygomorphic flowers. Then, we artificially

   to natural pollinators (syrphid flies and bumblebees). We found that the
   frequency of approach by syrphid flies and bumblebees was not influenced
   by flower angle, but there were fewer landings on downward-oriented
   flowers than on control and upward-oriented flowers. Moreover, the
   upward flower orientation increased illegitimate landings (landing on
   the flower without touching the stigmas or mating-related anthers)
   compared with controls. Thus, vertical flower orientation in zygomorphic
   flowers serves to control pollinator landings. Our findings suggest that
   deviations from vertical orientation may reduce fitness in C communis by
   reducing the efficiency of insect-mediated pollen transfer.}},

Abstract = {{We made a comparison between life history and reproductive
   characteristics of a group of Dutch rare (30) and common (105) plant
   species, all dicotyledonous and insect-visited forbs. The traits life
   span, clonality, breeding system, seed production, seed dispersal, and
   soil seed bank longevity are considered. All trait values have been
   ranked according to their possible effect on the vulnerability of a
   species for extinction, where low values indicate a low risk and high
   values a high risk for a species. Rare and common plants differed
   significantly in four traits: seed production, breeding system, seed
   bank longevity and clonality. The discriminant analysis showed that 79\%
   of the 135 species was correctly classified in the group they presently
   belong to. Especially species that are rare now but were much more
   common 50-100 years ago were classified as being common species,
   pointing at the detrimental effect of habitat loss these species
   encountered at which they have not yet been able to adapted to. The data
   set included eight hemiparasitic plant species (family Orobanchaceae),
   of which six are endangered in The Netherlands and two more common. Both
   rare and common hemiparasites scored high traits values, indicating that
   they are vulnerable for extinction. The hemiparasites had several
   characteristics in common: they are all annuals or biennials that have
   no means of clonal reproduction. They all have non-clustered,
   zygomorphic flowers that produce nectar and have a precise pollen
   presentation and are mainly visited by (bumble) bees. Mean life span was
   significantly shorter in the eight hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae than in
   the non-hemiparasitic Scrophulariaceae used for comparison (4 species).
   Overall, we concluded that hemiparasitic plants have a special
   combination of life history traits which makes them vulnerable for local
   and regional extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Group aggression influences communication and defense strategies in many
   social insect communities. Such aggression plays a particularly
   significant role in the lives of stingless bees, important native
   Neotropical pollinators, in which the battle for food resources can be
   deadly and critical to colony survival. However, the effects of group
   size on individual aggression levels and the spatio-temporal aggression
   strategy of communal aggressors have not been fully explored. We
   therefore investigated how group size affects the aggression levels and
   the spatio-temporal attack strategy (which body parts, and the amount of
   time spent in attacking each part) in close combats between Trigona
   spinipes foragers and a natural competitor, Melipona rufiventris. In all
   trials, T spinipes foragers competitively excluded M rufiventris
   foragers from nearby feeders, exhibiting four levels of aggressive
   behavior ranging from threat displays to prolonged grappling and
   decapitation. Surprisingly, aggression levels and spatial strategy
   corresponded to the size of group attacks. Larger groups of attackers
   used individually lower aggression levels than small groups of
   attackers. Smaller groups also attacked appendages linked to escape
   (legs and wings) with greater frequency than larger groups, which
   focused on vital central body areas (abdomen, thorax, and head).
   Increased aggression corresponded to increased risks for attackers and
   the attacked. All combatants engaging at the highest level of aggression
   died (100\% mortality). Thus the dominance style of T spinipes may
   minimize attack risk and maximize victim harm with finely tuned

Abstract = {{The structure of diverse floral visitor assemblages and the nature of

   visitor communities across the geographic range of Clarkia xantiana ssp.
   xantiana ( hereafter C. x. xantiana) ( Onagraceae) to examine the
   structure of visitor communities, the specificity of the pollination
   system, and the role of variation in the abiotic vs. biotic environment
   in contributing to spatial variation in pollinator abundance and
   community composition. Although the assemblage of bee visitors to C. x.
   xantiana is very diverse ( 49 species), few were regular visitors and
   likely to act as pollinators. Seventy-four percent of visitor species
   accounted for only 11\% of total visitor abundance and 69\% were
   collected in three or fewer plant populations ( of ten). Of the few
   reliable visitors, Clarkia pollen specialist bees were the most frequent
   visitors, carried more Clarkia pollen compared to generalist foragers,
   and were less likely to harbor foreign pollen. Overall, the core group
   of pollinators was obscured by high numbers of incidental visitors that
   are unlikely to contribute to pollination. In a geographic context, the
   composition of specialist pollinator assemblages varied considerably
   along the abiotic gradient spanning the subspecies' range. However, the
   overall abundance of specialist pollinators in plant populations was not
   influenced by the broad-scale abiotic gradient but strongly affected by
   local plant community associations. C. x. xantiana populations sympatric
   with pollinator-sharing congeners were visited twice as often by
   specialists compared to populations occurring alone. These positive
   indirect interactions among plant species may promote population
   persistence and species coexistence by enhancing individual reproductive

Abstract = {{There has been much recent interest in explaining patterns of body size
   variation within species assemblages. One observation is that frequency
   distributions of species' body size commonly exhibit a right-skew, even
   on a logarithmic scale. Here we examine the species' body size
   distributions in two assemblages of large Costa Rican moths. We find
   that neither adult Sphingidae or Saturniidae exhibit the classic log
   right-skewed pattern. Furthermore, the species' body size distributions
   in these two groups are markedly different, which we suggest is a result
   of differential selective pressures related to resource and mate
   acquisition. For Sphingidae, we show (1) that body size is positively
   correlated with tongue length, and (2) that the distribution of sphingid
   body sizes/tongue lengths closely matches the distribution of flower
   corolla tube depths in sphingid-pollinated plants. Thus, morphological
   fitting between plants and pollinators seems to underlie the species'
   body size distribution of this sphingid assemblage. We discuss the
   significance of these results in the context of current theory on
   mechanisms driving species' body size distributions. Finally, we present
   an evolutionary hypothesis for the diversity of body sizes seen in this
   sphingid assemblage related to reciprocal interactions between plants
   and pollinators. This hypothesis can be tested within a rigorous
   phylogenetic framework, although a systematic phylogenetic analysis of
   Neotropical Sphingidae does not currently exist.}},

Abstract = {{Mutually beneficial interactions between flowering plants and animal
   pollinators represent a critical `ecosystem service' under threat of
   anthropogenic extinction. We explored probable patterns of extinction in
   two large networks of plants and flower visitors by simulating the
   removal of pollinators and consequent loss of the plants that depend
   upon them for reproduction. For each network, we removed pollinators at
   random, systematically from least-linked (most specialized) to
   most-linked (most generalized), and systematically from most- to
   least-linked. Plant species diversity declined most rapidly with
   preferential removal of the most-linked pollinators, but declines were
   no worse than linear. This relative tolerance to extinction derives from
   redundancy in pollinators per plant and from nested topology of the
   networks. Tolerance in pollination networks contrasts with catastrophic
   declines reported from standard food webs. The discrepancy may be a
   result of the method used: previous studies removed species from
   multiple trophic levels based only on their linkage, whereas our
   preferential removal of pollinators reflects their greater risk of
   extinction relative to that of plants. In both pollination networks, the
   most-linked pollinators were bumble-bees and some solitary bees. These

Abstract = {{We examined the adaptive significance of a temporal decrease in the

   Bombus diversus (long proboscis) and B. honshuensis (short proboscis).
   We compared visitation frequency, pollen removal, pollen deposition, and
   fruit set after a single visit among three flower stages, differentiated
   by calyx tube length. Bombus diversus frequently visited and removed
   significantly more pollen from long flowers. Bombus honshuensis visited
   and tended to remove more pollen from short flowers. Both pollinators
   deposited more pollen in short flowers, resulting in higher fruit set.
   These results indicate that size correspondence between the proboscis

   not pollen deposition. Because a single visit does not fertilize all
   Ovules of a flower, multiple visits by two humble bee species may
   increase seed production and genetic diversity of offspring. By
   temporally changing calyx tube length, C. stans can use two humble bee
   pollinators and maintain specialized relationships with each. This
   strategy may be adaptive when the pollinator fauna fluctuates, and is

Abstract = {{Xerophyllum tenax is a mass-flowering, nectarless herb in which

   Ovaries of flowers from inflorescences bagged to prevent insect
   pollination produced small capsules containing undeveloped or no seeds.
   Epifluorescence analyses suggest that 0.95 of the uncovered flowers are

Abstract = {{Human disturbance of tropical rainforests may change pollinator
   communities indirectly as a result of changes in resource availability.
   We studied the mechanisms by which human disturbance affects a community
   of major pollinators, stingless bees, in Sarawak, Malaysia. We surveyed
   forest structure and flowering activity, and conducted a nest census and
   a bait-trap survey of stingless bees, both in primary forests and in
   forests disturbed by logging and shifting cultivation. The densities of
   late successional trees and large trees (diameter at breast height > 50
   cm) were higher in the primary forests than in the disturbed forests.
   The density of flowering trees was lower one year after logging, but
   recovered in old disturbed forests because of the active flowering of
   pioneer trees that became established after the disturbance. Stingless
   bees nest only in large trees, and nest density was positively
   correlated with the density of large trees. However, we found no
   relationship between the numbers of foragers and floristic parameters.
   Some species preferred nesting in dipterocarps, while others preferred
   dead trees. The results of the bait-trap survey also indicated that some
   species were abundant in the primary forests, whereas other species were
   abundant in the disturbed forests. These results suggest that human
   disturbance alters the species composition of the stingless bee
   community. Such changes in the bee community may affect the reproductive
   success of plants, and ultimately forest composition. (C) 2004 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Outcrossing in plants is influenced by the availability of pollinators
   and compatible mates. both of which may be modified by the population
   and community Context in which plant-pollinator interactions occur.
   Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators
   are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be
   beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of
   pollinators. In this study. I tested the hypothesis that
   pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon.
   Clarkia xantiana ssp. xontiana, and that positive interactions are most
   pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population Surveys revealed
   that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing
   congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied
   extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely
   associated with pollinator-sharing congeners conversely, Populations
   occuring,11 alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia
   communities ranged from segreated to aggregated. Although there was not
   strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering, time were
   often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted
   flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator
   availability in populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39
   replicate populations revealed that populations occuring with multiple
   congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of
   reproduction compared to populations occuring alone. Population size was
   inversely related to pollen limitation but did not affect pollinator
   availability, suggesting that Allee effects were caused by mate
   limitation. Intraspecific interactions were also positive at a fine
   spatial scale where pollen deposition increased with the density of
   closely neighboring conspecifics across 11 populations. Overall, inter-
   and intraspecific interactions through shared pollinators were generally
   facilitative, suggesting that population viability and title coexistence
   of ecologically similar Clarkia species may be promoted by positive
   reproductive interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Dichogamy, the temporal separation of male and female function, is
   widespread among angiosperms, yet its causes and consequences are not
   well understood. Two forms of dichogamy exist: protandry, in which
   pollen dispersal precedes stigma receptivity, and protogyny, in which
   the reverse occurs. Species-level comparative studies show that
   protandrous species tend to be pollinated by bees or flies, whereas
   protogynous species tend to be wind-or beetle-pollinated. This suggests
   a functional role for pollinators in the evolution of dichogamy. We
   mapped dichogamy and pollination characters onto a phylogeny of
   angiosperm species. Using the program Discrete, two models of
   evolutionary change (one allowing only for independent evolution and the
   other allowing correlated evolution of the two traits) were fit to the
   phylogeny to test for correlations. Log-likelihood ratio tests and Monte
   Carlo simulations support a correlated model for the evolution of the
   type of dichogamy and the form of pollination, demonstrating that the
   previously reported correlations are robust to phylogenetic correction.
   However, pollination mode was not found to affect transitions between
   protandry and protogyny. Rather, an examination of transition rates
   revealed that the rate of transitions between biotic and abiotic
   pollination depends on whether a species is protandrous or protogynous.
   Additionally, we found more support for a role of pollination in the
   evolution of protogyny from non-protogyny than in the evolution of
   protandry from non-protandry. This study calls into question some
   previous findings regarding the role of pollinators in the evolution of
   dichogamy.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The flower of Brassica napus L. appears to be typically zoophilous
   (suited to animal pollination) because of its visually attractive
   petals, robust stigma and nectaries. Pollination by wind is feasible,
   however, and its likely effectiveness is not immediately foreseeable
   because of the complexity of interactions between objects and windborne
   particles.
   2. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind-tunnel experiments were
   used to investigate the aerodynamic interactions between the flower and
   a windborne suspension of its pollen.
   3. The flower's petals handicapped wind pollination by reducing the
   target efficiency of the upwind-facing stigma. For downwind-facing
   flowers, pollen reception was negligible.
   4. Several aspects of the plant's architecture (floral structure, pollen
   cohesiveness, inflorescence structure) are uncompromisingly zoophilous.
   Estimates of the amount of wind pollination suggest that it is unlikely
   to be important for the long-distance dispersal of B. napus genes such
   as those from genetically modified varieties.

Abstract = {{Aims Several bird-pollinated or ornithophilous flowers are present on
   the Macaronesian archipelagos, the Canary Islands and Madeira, but
   absent from nearby NW Africa and Europe. In Macaronesia, no specialist
   nectar-feeding birds are found, but several generalist passerine bird
   species visit flowers for nectar. Two hypotheses attempt to explain the
   origin and evolution of ornithophily in the Macaronesian flora.
   According to `the island de novo hypothesis', bird-flowers evolved from
   mainland insect-pollinated ancestors after island colonization.
   Alternatively, ancestors of the ornithophilous Macaronesian plant
   species evolved bird-flowers before reaching the islands ('the relict
   hypothesis'). In this study we first compile information of Macaronesian
   bird-flower interactions from the literature and our own field
   observations. Secondly, we discuss the two hypotheses of origin of
   ornithophily in the light of evidence from recent molecular plant
   phylogenies, palaeontology, historical biogeography of the African
   avifauna and flora, and present-day ecological patterns.
   Location Madeira and Canary Islands.
   Results At least eleven endemic Macaronesian plant species from six
   genera have typical ornithophilous floral traits. These genera are:
   Canarina and Musschia (Campanulaceae), Isoplexis (Scrophulariaceae),
   Echium (Boraginaceae), Lotus (Fabaceae) and Lavatera (Malvaceae). These
   lineages have clear affinities to the Mediterranean region, except for
   Canarina whose closest relatives grow in East African mountains. Six
   generalist passerine bird species of Sylvia, Phylloscopus (Sylviidae),
   Serinus (Fringillidae) and Parus (Paridae) visit this flora for nectar.
   Main Conclusion We suggest that the origin and evolution of
   ornithophilous traits in these plant species took place mostly in
   mainland areas prior to island colonization. In Canarina and Lavatera,
   it is well supported that ornithophily is a relict condition, which
   originated in mainland areas possibly in association with specialist
   nectar-feeding birds. For the remaining plant species except Echium
   wildpretii bird floral traits probably also are a relict condition.
   These species may be derived from ancestors, which were visited by
   specialist nectar-feeding birds during geological periods when the
   Mediterranean and the Ethiopian vegetation were intermingled in mainland
   Africa. Probably, these mainland ancestors went extinct due to severe
   climatic fluctuations, while their Macaronesian descendants survived in
   `refuge' on the islands. Finally, the island de novo hypothesis may
   explain the evolution of a mixed bird/insect-pollination system in the
   neo-endemic red-flowered Echium wildpretii.}},

Abstract = {{1. Few studies of pollination success in fragmented systems measure
   stigmatic pollen load, and those that do often find it unrelated to
   plant or population density, size or isolation. Reduced reproductive
   output, however, is commonly reported, probably because incompatible
   pollen is contributing substantially to pollen loads of isolated
   flowers.
   2. We used manipulated floral arrays of a bee-pollinated species
   (Dianella revoluta) to investigate isolation effects on deposition of
   outcross pollen, while precluding self-pollen transfer.
   3. Outcross pollen receipt declined significantly over short distances
   up to approximately 50 m but even the most isolated flowers received
   some pollen grains. In contrast, heterospecific pollen did not decline,
   indicating that the outcross-pollen decline was not due to reduced
   pollinator visitation. Increased distance of experimental arrays from a
   nature reserve did not reduce the probability of pollen receipt.
   4. Many flowers were damaged by flower feeding beetles in the genus
   Arsipoda, which would be likely to substantially reduce the efficiency
   with which flowers are converted to fruits. The probability of flower
   damage from these predators was significantly lower in arrays that were
   more distant from the nature reserve.
   5. This study indicates that reduced plant density and increased
   isolation from a source of outcrossed pollen can lead to a substantial
   decline in the probability of outcrossing, even when pollinator
   visitation is maintained at a high level. Depending on the mating
   system, this process will lead to reduced seed set or increased
   inbreeding for plants in fragmented habitats, even when pollinator
   abundance and behaviour are unaffected.}},

   orchid species and comprise up to 25\% of bee species richness in
   neotropical rainforests. As one of the first studies of comparative
   phylogeography in a neotropical insect group, we performed a
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-based analysis of 14 euglossine species
   represented by populations sampled across the Andes and/or across the
   Amazon basin. The mtDNA divergences within species were consistently
   low; across the 12 monophyletic species the mean intraspecific
   divergence among haplotypes was 0.9\% (range of means, 0-1.9\%). The
   cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) divergence among populations separated by the
   Andes (N = 11 species) averaged 1.1\% (range 0.0-2.0\%). The mtDNA CO1
   data set displayed homogeneous rates of nucleotide substitution,
   permitting us to infer dispersal across the cordillera long after the
   final Andean uplift based on arthropod molecular clocks of 1.2-1.5\%
   divergence per million years. Gene flow across the 3000-km breadth of
   the Amazon basin was inferred from identical cross-Amazon haplotypes
   found in five species. Although mtDNA haplotypes for 12 of the 14
   euglossine species were monophyletic, a reticulate CO1 phylogeny was
   recovered in Euglossa cognata and E. mixta, suggesting large ancestral
   populations and recent speciation. Reference to closely related
   outgroups suggested recent speciation for the majority of species.
   Phylogeographical structure across a broad spatial scale is weaker in
   euglossine bees than in any neotropical group previously examined, and
   may derive from a combination of Quaternary speciation, population
   expansion and/or long-distance gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{Floral visitors vary in their pollination efficiency and their
   preferences for floral traits. If low-efficiency pollinators decrease
   the amount of pollen available to higher efficiency visitors, then
   low-efficiency visitors may actually have negative fitness consequences
   for the plants that they visit. We used experimental arrays in two
   populations to determine the floral preferences and the fitness effects
   of low-efficiency ( or ``ugly{''}) pollinators on Campanula americana.
   These ugly pollinators (halictid bees) preferentially visited flowers
   with pollen over flowers that had had their pollen removed. C. americana
   pollen color varies quantitatively from light tan to dark purple, and we
   found that natural variation in pollen color influenced the magnitude of
   halictid preferences for flowers with pollen. In general, preferences
   for flowers with pollen were stronger when the ugly pollinators foraged
   in arrays of flowers with tan-colored pollen than in arrays with
   purple-colored pollen. When plants received few visits by efficient
   Bombus pollinators, visits by ugly pollinators significantly decreased
   siring success relative to plants where visits by ugly pollinators were
   prevented. In contrast, ugly pollinators did not influence siring
   success when higher efficiency pollinators were more abundant. Thus, the
   relationship between low-efficiency pollinators and the plants that they
   visit varies from commensalistic to antagonistic depending on the
   presence of other pollinators in the community. Our findings suggest
   that the negative fitness effects and floral preferences of
   low-efficiency or ``ugly{''} pollinators may contribute to the
   maintenance of a pollen color polymorphism in C. americana.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are important pollinators of crops and
   wildflowers, but many species have suffered dramatic declines in recent
   decades. Strategies for their conservation require knowledge of their
   foraging range and nesting density, both of which are poorly understood.
   Previous studies have mainly focussed on the cosmopolitan bumblebee
   species Bombus terrestris, and implicitly assume this to be
   representative of other species. Here we use a landscape-scale
   microsatellite study to estimate the foraging range and nesting density
   of two ecologically dissimilar species, B. terrestris and R pascuorum.
   Workers were sampled along a 10 kin linear transect and 8-9 polymorphic
   microsatellite markers used to identify putative sisters. We provide the
   first published estimates of the number of colonies using a circle of
   radius 50 in in an agricultural landscape: 20.4 for R terrestris and
   54.7 for R pascuorum. Estimates of nest density differed significantly
   between the two species: 13 km(-2) for B. terrestris and 193 km(-2) for
   B. pascuorum. Foraging ranges also differed substantially, with R
   pascuorum foraging over distances less than 312 in and R terrestris less
   than 625 m. Clearly bumblebee species differ greatly in fundamental
   aspects of their ecology. This has significant implications for the
   development of conservation strategies for rare bumblebees and isolated
   plant populations, for the management of bumblebees as pollinators, and
   for predicting patterns of gene flow from genetically modified plants.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary transitions to dim-light foraging (predawn matinal,
   crepuscular, nocturnal) have occurred repeatedly in bees, and may be
   associated with an escape from enemies or competitors. To date, however,
   little information has been available to test these hypotheses. Here we
   provide the first detailed information on the nesting behaviour of two
   species of Neotropical, nocturnal sweat bees, Megalopta genalis and M.
   ecuadoria (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). Females are facultatively social or
   solitary, and construct nests in dead wood. Nocturnal foraging behaviour
   is bimodal. Bees began foraging after sunset (similar to18:30 h) and
   ceased foraging approximately 1 h later even though nocturnal flowers
   with pollen were still abundant; a second foraging bout occurred in the
   predawn morning, which began at similar to04:45 h and ended around
   sunrise (similar to06:15 h) when diurnal-blooming flowers were abundant.
   Bees are capable of controlled flight in full light. They utilized
   pollen from both canopy and understory plant species, which have diurnal
   or nocturnal pollen anthesis. Megalopta nests are attacked by generalist
   predators such as ants, as well as the endoparasitic fly Melaloncha sp.
   nov. (Phoridae), the beetle Macrosaigon gracilis (Rhipophoridae), the
   parasitic wasp Lophostigina cincta (Mutillidae), and the brood parasite
   Megalopta byroni (Halictidae). Overall nest survivorship rates were
   comparable to those for diurnal relatives, but rates of cell parasitism
   for Megalopta (much less than 5\%) were substantially lower than they
   are for day-flying relatives, offering some support for the hypothesis
   that the evolution of nocturnal behaviour enables escape from natural
   enemies. (C) 2004 The Linnean Society of London.}},

   illustrate a novel approach for quantifying nectar reward structures in

   explains the majority of variation in bee species richness, while other
   nectar variables (volume, concentration, energy value, and water
   content) have little predictive value per se. The new measure of nectar
   resource diversity is highly correlated with floral species richness and
   particularly with the species richness of annuals, yet it is additive in
   its effect on bee diversity. We conclude that relying solely upon

Abstract = {{Animal-mediated pollination is essential in the reproductive biology of
   many flowering plants and tends to be associated with pollination
   syndromes, sets of floral traits that are adapted to particular groups
   of pollinators. The complexity and functional convergence of various
   traits within pollination syndromes are outstanding examples of
   biological adaptation, raising questions about their mechanisms and
   origins. In the genus Petunia, complex pollination syndromes are found
   for nocturnal hawkmoths (P. axillaris) and diurnal bees (P.
   integrifolia), with characteristic differences in petal color, corolla
   shape, reproductive organ morphology, nectar quantity, nectar quality,
   and fragrance. We dissected the Petunia syndromes into their most
   important phenotypic and genetic components. They appear to include
   several distinct differences, such as cell-growth and cell-division
   patterns in the basal third of the petals, elongation of the ventral
   stamens, nectar secretion and nectar sugar metabolism, and enzymatic
   differentiation in the phenylpropanoid pathway. In backcross-inbred
   lines of species-derived chromosome segments in a transposon tagging
   strain of P. hybrida, one to five quantitative trait loci were
   identified for each syndrome component. Two loci for stamen elongation
   and nectar volume were confirmed in introgression lines and showed large
   allelic differences. The combined data provide a framework for a
   detailed understanding of floral syndromes from their developmental and
   molecular basis to their impact on animal behavior. With its molecular
   genetic tools, this Petunia system provides a novel venue for a pattern
   of adaptive radiation that is among the most characteristic of flowering

Abstract = {{The showy corolla of Mimulus guttatus is generally considered an

   the lower portion of the corolla facilitates autogamy by retaining
   pollen released from the anthers. A substantial portion of
   self-fertilization seems to occur late in the floral life span as the
   stigma contacts the corolla. When pollinators are present, the corolla
   facilitates outcrossing before, during, and after insect visitation. A
   large fraction of cross-pollen is actually captured by the corolla and
   not by the stigma. This ``indirect'' pathway for pollen reception
   suggests that a large fraction of cross-pollination in M. guttatus

   investigate the behavior and movement of male Colletes cunicularius, an
   important bee pollinator of Ophrys. Our study site was located in
   northern Switzerland where a large population of the bees was nesting.
   Within two plots, (10x40 in), we marked bees with different colors and
   numbered tags. Seventeen percent of the 577 marked bees were recaptured
   over a period of 1 to a maximum of 11 days. However, the number of
   recaptures dropped dramatically after 3-5 days, suggesting an average
   lifetime of less than 10 days. Mark-recapture distances varied from 0 to
   50 in, with a mean of 5 in. Our findings show that individual male bees
   patrol a specific and restricted region of the nesting area in search of
   mates. This mark-recapture study provides the first clues about the
   potential movement of pollen within populations of Ophrys orchids. We
   predict that orchid-pollen movements mediated by bees will be similar to
   the mark-recapture distances in this study. Parallel studies within

   relative retention times. The number of compounds per species ranged
   between 16 in Silene rupestris and 40 in S. viscaria. Main compounds in
   most species were fatty acid derivatives (FADs, cis-3-hexen-1-ol,
   cis-3-hexenyl acetate, n-nonanal), benzenoids (benzaldehyde,
   phenylacetaldehyde, methyl benzoate), and monoterpenes (limonene,
   linalool), accompanied by sesquiterpenes, and nitrogen-containing
   compounds.
   Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (CNESS, NMDS) based on relative
   amounts of single components leads to the same conclusion as
   visualization of similarities based on component classes reflecting to
   some degree biosynthetic pathways: differences in floral scent
   composition can be related to both the taxonomy and the pollination
   biology of the species investigated. In all but one species of the
   Silene group, and all species of the Lychnis group (S. dioica, S.
   flos-cuculi, S. flos-jovis, S. pendula), the dominating compound classes
   are benzenoids followed by FADs. The relatively high amounts of aromatic
   compounds (e.g. benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, methyl benzoate) are
   indicative of an adaptation towards butterfly pollination. Species of
   the Viscaria and Eudianthe groups showed high relative amounts of FADs
   but a lower content of benzenoids. Relatively high amounts of
   monoterpenes (>10\%) were found in S. alpestris, S. coeli-rosa, S.
   gallica, and S. viscaria. It is suggested that the high relative content
   of the most volatile monoterpene alkenes (e.g. limonene) in S. gallica
   and S. coeli-rosa may be indicative of an adaptation to bees as
   pollinators in these species. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study considers how a forager moves through its environment when
   food is patchily distributed and the patches differ in quality. One
   possibility is to move directionally among patches, staying longer in
   the best patches (the ``Local-Experience Hypothesis{''}). Additionally,
   when foragers reuse patches in a regenerating environment, they can
   potentially benefit from remembering the most profitable patches, and
   return preferentially to these (the ``Memory Hypothesis{''}). Both
   hypotheses were tested with foraging humble bees (Bombus spp.)
   collecting nectar in the foothills and mountains of southwest Alberta,
   Canada. Individually marked worker humble bees were observed visiting
   flowers on focal plants of five species visited primarily by bumble
   bees. In three plant species (Epilobium angustifolium, Hedysarum
   alpinum, and Penstemon confertus), variation in nectar secretion rate
   was experimentally induced by defoliation and fertilization of
   individual plants. In the other two species (H. sulphurescens and
   Oxytropis monticola), bees' responses to natural variation in
   plant-level nectar secretion were measured. Considering the bee
   population as a whole, plants with higher nectar production rates
   attracted more bees (three of five plant species) and had more of their.
   flowers visited (three of five plant species). The Local -Experience
   Hypothesis was supported in three of the five plant species: individual
   bees stayed longer by visiting more flowers on plants with higher rates
   of nectar production. The Memory Hypothesis was supported in four of the
   five plant species; individual bees were more likely to return to plants
   with higher rates of nectar secretion. Overall, there was a positive
   correlation between the extent to which individual plants differed in
   their rate of nectar secretion (a species-level trait), and the strength
   of support for the Memory Hypothesis (measured as a standardized effect
   size). That is, individual bumble bees more strongly adjusted their
   visitation rate based on plant quality as the magnitude of natural
   differences in plant quality increased. Support for the Memory
   Hypothesis may explain why bumble bees often revisit the same plants on
   successive foraging trips: memory for good plants gives them a fitness
   advantage over naive bees using the same area. Bumble bees appear to use
   a relatively sophisticated spatial memory in resource tracking, which
   may constrain the evolution of empty-flower strategies of plant nectar
   secretion.}},

   to complete constancy. When flowers contained greater reward volumes and
   were spaced farther apart, bees showed less flower constancy and more
   moves to closely neighbouring flowers. Changes in reward concentration
   had no effect on flower constancy; however, more dilute rewards produced
   shorter flight times between flowers. In addition, there was a strong
   positive relationship between degree of flower constancy and net rate of
   energy gain when flowers were spaced farther apart, indicating that

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile rotundata) is solitary and

   prevalent form of chalkbrood is caused by Ascosphaera aggregata, but
   this ascomycete is difficult to culture. Hyphae will grow on standard
   fungal media, but spore germination is difficult to achieve and highly
   variable. We found that germination can be enhanced with oils. Lipids
   derived from plants and bee larvae increased germination from 50\%
   (without oil) to 75-85\% (with oil). Percent germination was
   significantly greater in the presence of lipids but germination was not
   significantly different when different oils, including mineral oil, were
   used. A. aggregata spores oriented along the oil-aqueous interface in
   the broth in a polar fashion, with swelling and germ tube formation
   always occurring into the aqueous portion of the broth. The other half
   of the spore tended to attach to a lipid droplet, where it remained,
   without swelling, during germ tube formation. The physical attachment of
   spores to the oil-aqueous interface is what most probably stimulates
   spore germination, as opposed to some nutritional stimulation. However,
   further research is needed to determine if and where the spores
   encounter such an interface when germinating in the host gut, where

   effort is attained with the 2.5-4.0 cm diameter size class: 38\% of
   these plants produced 84\% of the flower heads. Few plants survived past
   the 4-cm size class. The species is primarily self-incompatible: neither

   significant number of achenes. Unlike some populations of some
   congeners, the Ivie Creek population was not apomictic. Outcrossing is
   the primary means of reproduction and native solitary bees are the most

Abstract = {{Background and aims Pollination is a critical stage in plant
   reproduction and thus in the maintenance and evolution of species and
   communities. The Caatinga is the fourth largest ecosystem in Brazil, but
   despite its great extent and its importance few studies providing
   ecological information are available, with a notable lack of work
   focusing on pollination biology. Here, general data are presented
   regarding the frequency of pollination systems within Caatinga
   communities, with the aim of characterizing patterns related to floral
   attributes in order to make possible comparisons with data for plant
   communities in other tropical areas, and to test ideas about the utility
   of syndromes. This paper also intends to provide a reference point for
   further studies on pollination ecology in this threatened ecosystem.
   Methods The floral traits and the pollination systems of 147 species
   were analysed in three areas of Caatinga vegetation in northeastern
   Brazil, and compared with world-wide studies focusing on the same
   subject. For each species, floral attributes were recorded as form,
   size, colour, rewards and pollination units. The species were grouped
   into 12 guilds according to the main pollinator vector. Analyses of the
   frequencies of the floral traits and pollination systems were
   undertaken.
   Key Results Nectar and pollen were the most common floral resources and
   insect pollination was the most frequent, occurring in 69.9\% of the
   studied species. Of the entomophilous species, 61.7\% were considered to
   be melittophilous (43.1\% of the total). Vertebrate pollination occurred
   in 28.1\% of the species (ornithophily in 15.0\% and chiropterophily in
   13.1\%), and anemophily was recorded in only 2.0\%.
   Conclusions The results indicated that the pollination systems in
   Caatinga, despite climatic restrictions, are diversified, with a low
   percentage of generalist flowers, and similar to other tropical dry and
   wet forest communities, including those with high rainfall levels. (C)

Abstract = {{Most models of floral specialization assume that adaptations to a
   particular type of pollinator incur a fitness trade-off in reduced
   effectiveness of others. To examine this assumption and characterize the
   form of trade-offs, I manipulated floral form in Dudleya greenei
   (Crassulaceae), a species that is pollinated by hummingbirds, bumble
   bees, and other insects. Existing pollination literature predicts that
   pollination by hummingbirds should favor narrower flowers than
   pollination by humble bees. When hummingbirds alone visited experimental
   populations, narrow flowers indeed performed best by most measures.
   Hummingbirds showed a slight preference for flowers of intermediate
   width but deposited more pollen per visit and more pollen overall, and
   they exported more dye (a pollen analogue) as corolla flare decreased.
   Bees were more effective than birds at pollinating wide flowers but did
   not generate overall performance trade-offs. Bees also preferred flowers
   of intermediate width and deposited more pollen per visit and more
   pollen overall as corolla flare decreased, but the overall efficiency
   with which bumble bees exported dye was independent of corolla flare.
   This demonstrates that phenotypic specialization for hummingbirds might
   evolve without trading-off the effectiveness of bumble bees. However,
   both birds and bees tended to transfer dye most efficiently between like
   phenotypes, suggesting that the form of selection and presence of
   trade-offs may be frequency dependent in natural populations.}},

   with flower age, being greater on the first day of floral anthesis,
   declining until the third day when it almost disappeared. Nectar from
   all cultivars was hexose-dominated (glucose and fructose), although
   sucrose was identified in most samples. The sucrose to hexoses ratio was
   very variable, not only between cultivars, but also within the same
   cultivar. That ratio varied among samples of the same cultivars,
   depending on the time of collection. The importance of nectar volume and

Abstract = {{Pollination of vinca {[}Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don] `Parasol' and
   `Cooler Peppermint' was investigated to improve commercial seed
   production. The flower was functionally close to cleistogamous with
   pollination limited by the foraging behaviour of insects. Only probosces
   of butterflies and hawkmoths could reach the anthers and stigmas. The
   pollen and stigmas were sticky, with autonomous self-pollination
   occurring from day -1 to day 0 (anthesis) when the pistils and corolla
   tubes elongated. Seventy percent of pollen germinated on the stigma at
   anthesis, with less germination at 35degreesC than at lower
   temperatures. Flowers lived 4-5 d after anthesis, but were functional
   for only a few days. Only the probosces of butterflies or hawkmoths
   reached the stigmas and pollen, with bees and droneflies absent. More
   than 30\% of flowers set seed by autonomous self-pollination, with
   pollinators greatly increasing fruit set and the number of seeds per
   fruit. In `Cooler Peppermint', fruit set in open pollination was 95\%,
   while it was 38\% in plants covered with net. Thus, reproduction in
   vinca is largely dependent on pollinators which are agricultural pests.
   Promotion of autonomous self-pollination is important for commercial

Abstract = {{Many alpine plants are predominantly outcrossing, thus plant
   reproductive success is highly dependent on effectiveness of
   pollinators. How pollinators transfer pollen from one flower to another
   is of great interest in understanding the genetic structure in plant
   populations. We studied (1) the role and effectiveness of insect
   visitors for pollination, and (2) their contribution as pollen vectors
   for gene dispersal in a Rhododendron ferrugineum population. Various
   insect visitors were recorded, including Hymenoptera, Diptera,
   Coleoptera, and Lepidoptera. The most frequent and effective insects
   were honey bees and bumblebees. Muscid flies were considered as
   important pollinators, particularly due to their relatively high
   visitation rate. Syrphid flies, Formicidae, and Coleoptera were
   ineffective in transporting pollen, while the effectiveness of
   Lepidoptera and Empididae was negligible. A fluorescence labelling
   experiment revealed that pollen dispersal was restricted (0 - 2 m) in a
   dense R. ferrugineum stand and decreased in a leptokurtic fashion. This
   might lead to geitonogamous self-pollination that could explain the
   close relationship between individuals found in genetic studies of R.
   ferrugineum. However, some pollen grains may travel 40-45 m, which
   implies the occurrence of cross-pollination through the foraging
   activities of bumblebees and honey bees.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is an important selection pressure in the life history of
   plants. Most studies use seed or fruit production as an indication of
   plant fitness, but the impact of herbivory on male reproductive success
   is usually ignored. It is possible that plants compensate for resources
   lost to herbivory by shifting the allocation from seed production to
   pollen production and export, or vice versa. This study examined the
   impact of herbivory by Helix aspersa on both male and female
   reproductive traits of a monoecious plant, Cucumis sativus. The effects
   of herbivory on the relative allocation to male and female flowers were
   assessed through measurements of the number and size of flowers of both
   sexes, and the amount of pollinator visitation. We performed two
   glasshouse experiments; the first looked at the impact of three levels
   of pre-flowering herbivory, and the second looked at four levels of
   herbivory after the plants had started to flower. We found that
   herbivory during the flowering phase led to a significant increase in
   the number of plants without male flowers. As a consequence there was
   significantly less pollen export from this population, as estimated by
   movement of a pollen analog. The size of female flowers was reduced by
   severe herbivory, but there was no affect on pollen receipt by the
   female flowers of damaged plants. The decrease in allocation to male
   function after severe herbivory may be adaptive when male reproductive
   success is very unpredictable.}},

Abstract = {{Can economic forces be harnessed for biodiversity conservation? The
   answer hinges on characterizing the value of nature, a tricky business
   from biophysical, socioeconomic, and ethical perspectives. Although the
   societal benefits of native ecosystems are clearly immense,they remain
   largely unquantified for all but a few services. Here, we estimate the
   value of tropical forest in supplying pollination services to
   agriculture. We focus on coffee because it is one of the world's most
   valuable export commodities and is grown in many of the world's most
   biodiverse regions. Using pollination experiments along replicated
   distance gradients, we found that forest-based pollinators increased
   coffee yields by 20\% within approximate to1 km of forest. Pollination
   also improved coffee quality near forest by reducing the frequency of
   ``peaberries{''} (i.e., small misshapen seeds) by 27\%. During
   2000-2003, pollination services from two forest fragments (46 and 111
   hectares) translated into approximate to\$60,000 (U.S.) per year for one
   Costa Rican farm. This value is commensurate with expected revenues from
   competing land uses and far exceeds current conservation incentive
   payments. Conservation investments in human-dominated landscapes can
   therefore yield double benefits: for biodiversity and agriculture.}},

   bilateral symmetry. The presence of color cues did not influence the

   is innately preferred in the context of food search, a fact that
   supports the selection of symmetry in flower displays. Furthermore, such

Abstract = {{Pollination modes ecology of a total of 164 plant species was evaluated

   (13.9\%), fly (12.7\%), and wasp (10.8\%) pollination were the second
   most frequent. Moth (6.2\%) and wind (10.4\%) pollination occurred with
   similar frequency, and the least common were bird (3.1\%), beetle
   (2.3\%) and bat (1.9\%) pollination. There was a significant interaction
   effect indicating that pollination mode was affected by the type of
   habitat. Bee pollination was the most common pollination mode in all
   habitats with butterfly, fly and wasp pollination being secondary for
   forest and forest-savanna transition; and butterfly, wasp, wind and fly
   pollination being secondary for savanna. Wind, butterfly and fly
   pollination were found in disturbed areas as secondary pollination
   modes. Pollination modes were significantly associated and affected by
   life forms. Bee pollination was dominant in all life forms with wasp,
   butterfly and fly pollination being the secondary for trees, shrubs, and
   lianas; and butterfly and wind pollination being the secondary for
   herbaceous species. The number of pollination modes (richness) among
   life forms ranged between four and nine for epiphytes and perennial
   herbs respectively. The highest values of diversity indexes among life
   forms were found in trees and shrubs. The richness and diversity indices
   of pollination modes were statistically higher for more structured
   habitats, forest and forest-savanna transition, than herbaceous
   habitats, savanna and disturbed areas, which is associated with the
   highest values of diversity indexes in trees and shrubs. Equitability
   was higher for forest and disturbed areas than forest-savanna transition
   and savanna. The results of comparative richness, equitability,
   diversity indices, and the frequency distribution of pollination modes

   richness of pollination modes may be different between tropical and

Abstract = {{Stenocereus eruca is a clonal cactus with an extremely narrow
   distribution in Baja California, in which seedling recruitment has
   rarely been observed. Low seedling recruitment in clonal plants may be
   caused by low seed production as a consequence of pollinator limitation
   or if seed input is sufficient, by lack of favorable conditions or
   microsites for seedling establishment. In this paper, we study the
   reproductive ecology of S. eruca along four years in order to explore
   the proximate causes of the low seedling recruitment observed in its
   populations. Flowers are self-incompatible, secrete up to 200 mul of
   nectar with sugar concentration of 21-23\% and are predominantly
   nocturnal, with little opportunities for diurnal visitors. Major flower
   visitors were sphingids (Hyles lineata and Erinnys ello) and an
   unidentified native bee. The proportion of flowers setting fruit (fruit
   set) was in general low, with values ranging from 0.03 to 0.15 among
   four populations from 1999 to 2002. Bees were observed visiting flowers
   during 1999, 2001 and 2002 while sphingids were observed visiting the

   pollen provisions and fecal material for different nests (3) and cells
   (8). Nomioides variegatus is polylectic, but individuals bees exhibited
   a high degree of foraging consistency for the provisioning of single
   cells. Eleven different pollen types representing 10 plant families were

Abstract = {{Background and Aims This study on reproductive biology examines the
   stigmatic morphology of 12 Brazilian Malpighiaceae species with regard
   to their pollination and breeding system.
   Methods The species were studied in natural populations of a
   semi-deciduous forest fragment. Style tips were processed for
   observation by SEM and pollen-tube growth was analyzed under
   fluorescence microscopy. The breeding system was investigated by
   isolating flowers within waterproof bags. Floral visitors were recorded
   through notes and photographs.
   Key Results Flowers are yellow, pink or white, protogynous, herkogamous
   and sometimes lack oil glands. While Banisteriopsis pubipetala has
   functional female flowers (with indehiscent anthers), I I species
   present hermaphrodite flowers. Stigmas of these species may be terminal,
   with a slightly concave surface, or internal, consisting of a circular
   cavity with a large orifice, and are covered with a thin, impermeable
   cuticle that prevents pollen from adhering, hydrating, or germinating.
   Malpighiaceae have a special type of `wet' stigma, where a secretion
   accumulates under the cuticle and is released by mechanical means-mainly
   rupture by pollinators. Even though six species show a certain degree of
   self-compatibility, four of them present a form of late-acting
   self-incompatibility, and the individual of B. pubipetala is
   agamospermous. Species of Centris, Epicharis and Monoeca bees pollinate
   these flowers, mainly collecting oil. Some Epicharis and Monoeca species
   collected pollen by vibration. Paratetrapedia and Tetrapedia bees are
   pollen and oil thieves.
   Conclusions The Malpiguiaceae species studied are pollinator-dependent,
   as spontaneous self-pollination is limited by herkogamy, protogyny and
   the stigmatic cuticle. Both the oil- and pollen-collecting behaviours of
   the pollinators favour the rupture of the stigmatic cuticle and the
   deposition of pollen on or inside the stigmas. As fruit-set rates in

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is likely to have been a major factor
   leading to serious declines in bumblebee abundance and diversity in the
   UK and elsewhere over recent decades. Opportunities to restore habitat
   for bumblebees on uncropped arable field margins are now available,
   although the methods by which this restoration can be achieved have not
   been fully investigated. We present the results of a three year study
   undertaken to investigate the response of foraging bumblebees to five
   different arable field margin treatments (sown and unsown), as part of a
   replicated field experiment on arable farmland in northern England (UK).
   Bumblebee abundance was closely linked to successional changes in
   availability of suitable forage plant species. Field margin treatments
   sown with a `grass and wildflower' mixture had the highest bumblebee
   abundance, and provided a consistent supply of forage species, with
   different components of the seed mixture flowering in each year. The
   unsown natural regeneration treatment attracted foraging bumblebees in
   only the second year due to the local abundance of thistles, so we
   consider this option to be both inconsistent in terms of forage
   provision and agronomically unacceptable. Our results are discussed in
   terms of developing suitable measures to achieve the restoration of
   habitats for bumblebees on arable farmland. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This special issue provides ample evidence why it is becoming
   increasingly important to be able to track the movement of predatory
   insects in agroecosystems through space and time. Tracking predatory
   insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small,
   cryptic and highly mobile organisms. Using insect-borne pollen present
   either on the exoskeleton or within the gut, presents a useful technique
   by which the movements (spatial displacements) of insects can be
   determined, based on the distribution of flowering plants in the area,
   an appropriate pollen key or atlas, and an understanding of pollination
   ecology. Pollen has successfully been used to track the movement of bees
   and moths, but has rarely been used to track predatory insects. Since
   many predators are likely to encounter pollen as they forage on flowers,
   they are good candidates for this technique. In this review we examine
   two types of study that use pollen to track the movements of predatory
   insects: (a) those in which pollen from the surrounding landscape is
   used to assess habitat usage and short-term movement of generalist
   predators from a range of insect orders, and (b) those in which pollen
   from a known point-source is used to assess the movement and dispersal
   distance of the insects. We discuss the benefits and limitations of
   using pollen to determine the movement of predatory insects, and explain
   how the information derived can contribute to optimising the use of
   predatory insects within the agricultural landscape in integrated pest
   management programmes.}},

   type found in all provisions and feces, accounting for 98.0 to 99.9\% of
   the pollen based on the number of grains. This proportion was similar

Abstract = {{Pollination by male and female Euglossini bees, euglossophily, was
   suggested for a number of neotropical Gesneriaceae species. Information
   on bee species other than Euglossini as pollinators of neotropical
   members of this family is limited, and in the tribe Sinningieae data
   about bee pollination are still lacking. Here, we report on floral
   biology and bee pollination of four Sinningia species: S. schiffneri, S.
   eumorpha, S. villoso, and Sinningio ``canastrensis{''}. The flower
   features, such as corolla size, shape, and colour, are very different
   among the four species, but all conform to the melittophilous syndrome.
   The average nectar volume and sugar amount is low in S. schiffneri, S.
   eumorpha, and Sinningia ``canastrensis{''}, when compared to that of S.
   villosa, but low nectar amounts is a general feature of Sinningia
   species. The main pollinators of the four species are: small
   Tapinotaspidini (Trigonopedia ferruginea) of S. schiffneri, large
   Bombini (Bombus morio) and large Centridini (Epicharis morio) of S.
   eumorpha, large Euglossini (Eulaema cingulata and Eufriesea
   surinamensis) of S. villosa, and large Euglossini (Eufriesea violascens)
   and Megachilini (Megachile sp.) of Sinningia ``canastrensis{''}. Out of
   the four species, only S. villosa is exclusively Euglossini-pollinated.
   The marked differences in flower features and nectar production of these
   Sinningia species may reflect their pollination by distinct groups of
   bees. These results strengthen the idea of multiple origins for the
   pollination systems involving bees within this genus, which is highly
   supported by molecular phylogenetic analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Eryngium alpinum (Apiaceae) is an endangered
   perennial, characteristic of the Alpine flora. Because the breeding
   system influences both demographic (reproductive success) and genetic
   (inbreeding depression. evolutionary potential) parameters that are
   crucial for population maintenance, the reproductive ecology of E.
   alpinum was investigated. Specifically, the aims of the study were (1)
   to determine the factors (resources and/or pollen) limiting plant
   fitness; and (2) to assess the potential for gene flow within a plant,
   within a patch of plants, and across a whole valley where the species is
   abundant.
   Methods Field experiments were performed at two sites in the Fournel
   valley, France, over three consecutive years. Studies included a
   phenological survey, observations of pollinators (visitation rates and
   flight distances), dispersal of a fluorescent powder used as a pollen
   analogue, the use of seed traps, determination of the pollen/ovule
   ratio. and an experiment to test whether seed production is limited by
   pollen and/or by resources.
   Key results E. alpinum is pollinated by generalist pollinators,
   visitation rates are very high and seed set is resource-rather than
   pollen-limited. The short flights of honeybees indicate a high potential
   for geitonogamy, and low pollen and seed dispersals suggest strong
   genetic structure over short distances. These results are interpreted in
   the light of previous molecular markers studies, which, in contrast,
   showed complete outcrossing and high genetic homogeneity.
   Conclusions. The study highlights the usefulness of adopting several
   complementary approaches to understanding the dynamic processes at work
   in natural populations. and the conservation implications for E. alpinum
   are emphasized. Although the studied populations do not seem threatened
   in the near future, long-term monitoring appears necessary to assess the
   impact of habitat fragmentation. Moreover, this study provides useful
   baseline data for future investigations in smaller and more isolated
   populations. (C) 2004 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Pollination through sexual mimicry, also known as
   pseudocopulation, has been suggested to occur ill some genera of the
   Neotropical orchid subtribe Maxillariinae. However, it has been
   demonstrated so far only for Trigonidium obtusum. This study reports and
   illustrates pollination through sexual mimicry in Mormolyca ringens.
   Methods A total of 70 h were dedicated to the observation of flowers and
   pollinator behaviour, which was photographically recorded. Flower
   features involved in pollinator attraction were studied using a
   stereo-microscope and by SEM analyses. Preliminary observations on the
   plant breeding system were made by manually self-pollinating flowers.
   The chemical composition of the fragrance volatiles was determined by
   GC/MS analysis.
   Key Results The flower features of M. ringens parallel those of other
   psuedocopulatory flowers. The labellum shape and indument are
   reminiscent of all insect. Sexually excited drones of Nannotrigona
   testaceicornis and Scaptotrigona sp. (both in the Apidae: Meliponini)
   attempt copulation with the labellum and pollinate the flower in the
   process. In both bee species, the pollinarium is attached to the
   scutellum. Pollinator behaviour may promote some degree of
   self-pollination, but preliminary observations indicate that M. ringens
   flowers are self-incompatible. Flowers are produced all the year round,
   which ties in with the production of bee males several times a year. The
   phylogenetic relationships of M. ringens are discussed and a number of
   morphological and phenological features supporting them are reported.
   Conclusions It is expected that further research could bring to light
   whether other Maxillariinae species are also pollinated through sexual
   mimicry. When a definitive and robust phylogeny of this subtribe is
   available, it should be possible to determine how many times
   pseudocopulation evolved and its possible evolutionary history. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{To obtain basic information on spatial foraging patterns of the
   bumblebee Bombus ignitus, we conducted a tracking experiment of marked
   bumblebees foraging among systematically arranged potted plants, Cosmos
   sulphureus, in an enclosed system, i.e., a net cage, for 21 days. A
   sequence of 100 plant visits by a bumblebee typically comprised visits
   to about 30 individual plants on average, not all the plants. The bees
   showed gradual changes in their spatial foraging patterns, and we found
   that the size of the foraging area varied across days in the same bees
   and among bees foraging on the same days. Air temperature and bee body
   size were unlikely to affect their spatial foraging patterns. The
   observed bees visited the same plants at significantly different rates
   on 11 of the 17 days for which sufficient data could be collected,
   perhaps resulting from displacement of foraging areas among the bees.
   From this result, we suggest that the presence of simultaneously
   foraging bees may affect their spatial foraging patterns. The
   preferences for large display plants were significant on 15 of the 21
   days if data were pooled for all bees foraging on the same day, but the
   preference of individuals was not significant in most cases, suggesting
   the possibility that spatial foraging patterns of individual bees may
   not simply depend on such preference. These results are important for
   future studies to examine factors affecting spatial foraging patterns of
   bumblebees.}},

   eriocephalus (Thymeleaceae), pollinated by weak-flying, sedentary
   beetles. We studied a single H. quadriloculare population over high and
   low flowering years and found no difference in bee visitation rates
   between these years. For H. quadriloculare, neighborhood floral display
   did not make a significant contribution to reproductive success. We
   investigated dense and sparse L. eriocephalus populations in the same
   year. In the low density L. eriocephalus population, individual floral
   displays were higher than in the dense population, yet reproductive
   success was low, indicating that plant isolation was a major factor
   influencing fruit set. This result was due to the extremely low number
   of beetles per plant and per flower in this population. In the dense L.
   eriocephalus population, although the displays of individual neighbors
   were smaller and plants were closer, neighborhood floral display did not
   contribute significantly to reproductive success, whereas the effect of
   individual floral display was ambiguous. Species with self-incompatible
   rather than self-compatible breeding systems are expected to experience
   neighborhood effects on reproductive success; however, at the spatial
   scale and floral display levels of plants in this study, only individual
   floral display affected fruit set in H. quadriloculare, whereas neither
   individual nor neighborhood display influenced fruit set in L.
   eriocephalus. Therefore, pollinator type, pollinator behavior, and plant
   and population isolation, rather than breeding system alone, will
   determine if neighborhood floral display affects fruit set.}},

Abstract = {{Despite recent interest in the non-sugar components of floral nectar,
   nearly nothing is known about the ecological importance and phylogenetic
   distribution of scented nectar. If present, the scent of nectar would
   provide an honest signal to nectar-feeding animals. Nectar odors may
   directly impact plant reproductive fitness, through pollinator
   attraction or deterrence of nectar robbers and florivores. In addition,
   nectar odors may indirectly impact plant fitness through antimicrobial
   activity, pleiotropic interactions with plant defense, and communication
   with predators and parasitoids. The literature provides only
   circumstantial evidence for scented nectar, through the study of bee
   honey odors. Here I confirm the presence of scent in the nectar of four
   out of seven angiosperm species sampled with solid-phase
   micro-extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In Abelia x
   grandiflora and Hedychium coronarium, nectar odors are a hydrophilic
   subset of the compounds emitted by surrounding floral tissues,
   suggesting passive absorption by the nectar standing crop. Sucrose
   solution applied to the petals of a nectarless flower, Magnolia
   grandiflora, absorbed a hydrophilic subset of scent compounds after one
   hour, lending support to this hypothesis. Nectar from Oenothera
   primiveris and Agave palmeri contained unique scent compounds compared
   to the floral tissues. The presence of fermentation volatiles in A.
   palmeri nectar suggests a dynamic role for yeast in its floral biology.
   These data highlight the need for systematic studies on the distribution
   and mechanistic importance of scented floral nectar to plant-animal
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Plants are under siege from a diversity of enemies that consume both
   leaf and floral parts. Plants resist damage to leaves in a variety of
   ways, and we now have a rich literature documenting how plants defend
   themselves against herbivore attack. In contrast, the mechanisms by
   which plants resist enemies that consume floral parts or resources are
   much less known, even though damage to floral tissue usually has tighter
   links to plant fitness than damage to leaf tissue. Many plants
   experience nectar robbing, whereby floral visitors remove nectar from
   flowers, often without pollinating. Nectar robbers can reduce plant
   fitness to degrees comparable to, or even surpassing, reduction by
   herbivores. However, because nectar attracts both pollinators and nectar
   robbers, plants face a dilemma in defending against nectar robbers
   without also deterring pollinators. Here, we extend the conceptual
   framework of resistance to herbivores to include resistance to nectar
   robbers, focusing on nectar traits. We review published data and find
   that an array of nectar traits may deter robbers without deterring
   pollinators. Although resistance traits against robbers have been
   broadly identified, the costs and benefits of these traits in terms of
   plant fitness remain poorly understood. We present data showing that a
   nectar trait (dilute nectar) might directly, as well as indirectly,
   benefit plant fitness by deterring nectar-robbing bumble bees of
   Ipomopsis aggregata without deterring hummingbird pollinators. However,
   the magnitude of any plant fitness benefit will depend on the degree to
   which plants are pollen- vs. resource-limited in a given year. The
   results of our work offer both conceptual and empirical insight into how
   plants cope with attack by nonpollinating floral visitors through a
   relatively unexplored trait, nectar.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{1. Theory predicts that the susceptibility of patches of plants to gene
   flow mediated by incoming pollinators will depend on the length of
   pollinator residence (the number of flowers visited during a bout in a
   patch). We sought to determine whether pollinator residence is
   sufficiently sensitive to patch size and separation to influence levels
   of gene flow significantly. We studied oilseed rape Brassica napus as an
   exemplar of a conventional animal-pollinated plant and as a species
   where there is a risk of genetic escape from genetically modified (GM)
   varieties.
   2. We determined pollinator residence in 36 patches created by mowing an
   agricultural field of flowering oilseed rape. Each square patch had an
   edge length of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 m. Patches were separated by either 9
   m or 18 m from the border of a large unmown area of crop. We used the
   residence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) to solve a model of
   bumblebee-mediated gene flow.
   3. Bumblebee residence increased significantly with patch area, but did
   not depend on the separation distance of the patch from the large areas
   of crop. Even in the largest patches, bees visited only c. 60 of the c.
   1 x 10(5) flowers before leaving.
   4. If bumblebees were the sole pollinators, the model predicted that
   4-8\% of the seed produced by the smaller patches (c. 80-320 plants) had
   fathers outside the patch, whereas in the larger patches (720-8000
   plants) the prediction was 2-4\%. Nevertheless, larger patches should
   produce the greatest number of seeds with extrinsic paternity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our observations demonstrate that
   susceptibility to pollinator-mediated gene flow is liable to decrease
   systematically as the size of plant patches increases. These findings
   can inform the management of genetic diversity in and among small or
   fragmented populations. If the patch size-gene flow relationship that we
   observed applies to larger scales, the model could estimate gene flow
   between GM crops and volunteer or feral populations in agricultural
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Small populations of reward-producing plants are likely to be less
   attractive to animal pollinators than large populations. As a result,
   both the quantity and the proportion of compatible pollen deposited on
   receptive stigmas, and seed output per plant, may be lower in small than
   in large populations.
   2. We examined whether pollinator visitation, pollen deposition and seed
   set varied with population size in the self-incompatible, tristylous
   herb Lythrum salicaria, in the Skeppsvik archipelago, northern Sweden.
   We documented both the number of compatible and incompatible conspecific
   and heterospecific pollen grains received per flower, seed set and
   degree of pollen limitation of long-styled plants in 14 populations of
   different size in two consecutive years, and recorded the visitation
   rate to individual plants and the number of flowers visited per plant in
   eight of the populations.
   3. As predicted, the visitation rate tended to increase, while the
   number of flowers visited per plant tended to decrease with increasing
   population size. However, visitation rates were low overall and
   temporally highly variable, and these relationships only approached
   statistical significance. The proportion and absolute number of
   compatible pollen grains received increased with population size, while
   the total amounts of conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains
   received did not vary significantly with population size. The results of
   supplemental hand-pollinations indicated that the among-population
   variation in seed set was due to insufficient transfer of compatible
   pollen in small populations.
   4. Seed output increased with the receipt of compatible pollen grains up
   to about 200 compatible pollen grains received per flower. Between 73\%
   and 98\% of the L. salicaria pollen grains received were incompatible,
   and between 9\% and 81\% of the pollen grains deposited were
   heterospecific (population means). However, there was no evidence that
   the deposition of high numbers of incompatible conspecific and
   heterospecific pollen grains reduced seed set.
   5. In the study populations of L. salicaria, variation in seed output
   and pollen limitation are apparently governed primarily by factors
   influencing the transfer of compatible pollen. The results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in the efficiency of
   pollen transfer among compatible mating types may markedly reduce the
   reproductive output in small populations of self-incompatible plants. In
   light of the current rapid transformation and fragmentation of habitats,
   there is a pressing need both to clarify how the pollination success of
   plants with different pollination systems is affected by large-scale
   changes in population size, density and isolation, and to determine the
   demographic consequences of differences in pollination intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Of the set of syndromes displayed by specialized
   (euphilic) flowers, adaptation to pollination by bats (chiropterophily)
   is the least known. Accumulated new evidence reveals that this
   pollination mode plays a considerable role in tropical communities,
   especially in the neotropics. One family in which bat-pollinated species
   are known in several genera is the Bignoniaceae. Here is reported, for
   the first time, bat pollination and floral ecology in Adenocalymna
   dichilum (tribe Bignonieae). Methods Floral features of this species
   growing in Bahia (north-east Brazil) indicated possible chiropterophily,
   which was subsequently confirmed by direct observation and from
   photographs of bat visits. Timing of anthesis and nectar parameters were
   monitored in the field, and floral morphology was investigated with
   fixed flowers. Key Results One to two flowers open per night on the
   upright, simple racemes of A. dichilum during several weeks in a `steady
   state' mode. The bilabiate, cream-coloured corollas are functional for
   only a single night and wilt during the following day. A stout corolla,
   with a musky odour, and a large nectary disc with large quantities of
   watery nectar also conform to the syndrome. Glossophaga soricina
   (Glossophaginae) visited and pollinated the flowers in a trap-lining
   manner. Whilst hovering, the bats put their heads into the corolla mouth
   for less than 1s to feed, thereby effecting the transfer of pollen which
   is deposited on their backs. Conclusions Adenocalymna, a New World genus
   comprising approx. 50 species, exhibits floral adaptive radiation
   including species pollinated by bees, birds and possibly moths. The
   discovery of chiropterophily in A. dichilum adds another facet to the
   array of floral syndromes represented in the genus. (C) 2004 Annals of

Abstract = {{Levels of specialization of the pollination systems were evaluated in
   155 plant species from the Venezuelan Central Plain. In all, 29
   pollination systems were found, resulting from various combinations of
   nine pollen-vector types or pollinating agent classes. The number of
   pollen-vector types composing a pollination system ranged from one to
   five. Ninety-one species were pollinated by only a single pollen-vector
   type; the frequency of pollination systems fell monotonically with
   increasing number of constituent pollen-vector types. Some 30-40 per
   cent of bee-, moth-, beetle- and bat-pollinated species were pollinated
   by that group of vectors alone. The highest incidence of co-occurrence
   between pollen-vector types was found for the combinations fly-wasp,
   butterfly-wasp, butterfly-fly, and to a lesser extent bird-butterfly,
   bat-bird, bat-moth and butterfly-moth. The average number of
   pollen-vector types per plant species was significantly higher for trees
   and shrubs than for lianas and perennial herbs. The distribution of
   polyphily, oligophily, monophily and anemophily was significantly
   associated with life form and habitat. The relative frequencies of these
   types varied least through the year in the forest-savannah ecotone and
   in the vegetation as a whole, reflecting the combination of life forms.
   There were significantly fewer night-pollinated than day-pollinated
   species. Day-pollinated species tended to be polyphilous, and most of
   the night-pollinated species were monophilous or oligophilous. Time of
   pollination activity was related to habitat. The relative importance of
   night pollination among life forms decreased from trees to perennial
   herbs. Plant species exclusively pollinated during the night reached a
   peak during the rainy season (May to November) for trees, lianas and
   perennial herbs. The data as a whole show that the relative frequency of
   polyphily, oligophily, monophily and anemophily, and the time of

   species richness, and may change from season to season. (C) 2004 The

   species of Echium in the archipelago. For each Echium species, we
   analyzed variation in species richness of bee visitors in relation to
   geographical distribution of the plants (area and altitude), floral
   traits ( morphology and color), and sampling effort (observation time
   and number of study populations). Geographical distribution range was
   the only good predictor of species richness of bees. In our study,
   widespread species of Echium were visited by a larger fraction of
   Echium-visiting bee taxa than were rare species. Thus, plant commonness
   per se may act as a strong attractant of bees. Alternatively, if
   widespread species interact with different flower visitor faunas across
   their distribution range, they can accumulate flower visitor taxa across
   populations. The influence of floral traits on the level of
   generalization appeared to be negligible in the Canarian Echium species.
   However, floral traits cannot be completely dismissed because of the
   confounding effect of phylogeny. The introduced E. plantagineum was more
   widespread in the Canary Islands than any of the congeneric endemic
   species. Further, it had larger flowers and attracted most of the
   Echium-visiting bee taxa. This species may become a serious competitor
   for pollinators for the endemic Echium species.}},

Abstract = {{1. Most animals have to bridge some distances in space and time to
   provide all resources necessary for survival. Little is known about how
   the local and regional management of tropical agroforestry systems,
   differing in the availability of food resources and suitable nesting
   sites, determine foraging trip duration and density of bees and wasps
   (Hymenoptera Aculeata).
   2. In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap
   nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species,
   which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central
   Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff. fulvescens
   (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium
   haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator
   Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were
   characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light
   intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest.
   3. The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the
   relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the
   pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are
   correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In
   contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were
   not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food
   resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in
   adjacent natural forests).
   4. The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management
   illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit
   access to a multiple set of resources. Accordingly, habitat evaluations
   using only foraging time may lead to wrong conclusions, as key drivers
   of population dynamics may not be inside but outside the local systems,
   emphasizing the need for a landscape approach.}},

Abstract = {{Many angiosperm species produce cones of anthers which release pollen
   through pores in response to vibration by pollinating bees
   ({''}buzz-pollination{''}). Anther cones of varying degrees of strength
   are a defining morphological trait for the genus Solanum. Anthers
   arranged in a robust ('pepper pot') cone are restricted to a single
   clade within the genus, and may therefore be assumed to be monophyletic.
   We show that in some species within this clade, such as tomato (Solanum
   lycopersicum), the anther cone is held together by interlocking hairs
   (trichomes) along the edges of the anthers. In other species within the
   clade, such as woody nightshade (Solanum dulcamara), the expanded anther
   surfaces are closely appressed to form the tightly bound cone,
   strengthened by extracellular secretions. Ectopic expression of the
   MIXTA gene from Antirrhinum majus in S. dulcamara results in the
   formation of ectopic trichomes on the anthers which cause the cone to
   disintegrate. Therefore, these two species produce the same macroscopic
   structure through two mutually exclusive developmental routes and the
   robust anther cone is derived differently within the clade. This example
   demonstrates that convergence between closely related species can be
   easily mistaken for homology, and may thus be underestimated. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the absence of floral rewards in many orchid
   species causes pollinators to probe fewer flowers on a plant, and thus
   reduces geitonogamy, i.e. self-pollination between flowers, which may
   result in inbreeding depression and reduced pollen export. We examined
   the effects of nectar addition on pollinator visitation and pollen
   transfer by tracking the fate of colour-labelled pollen in Anacamptis
   mono, a non-rewarding orchid species pollinated primarily by queen
   bumble-bees. Addition of nectar to spurs of A. morio significantly
   increased the number of flowers probed by bumble-bees, the time spent on
   an inflorescence, pollinarium removal and the proportion of removed
   pollen involved in self-pollination through geitonogamy, but did not
   affect pollen carryover (the fraction of a pollinarium carried over from
   one flower to the next). Only visits that exceeded 18 s resulted in
   geitonogamy, as this is the time taken for removed pollinaria to bend
   into a position to strike the stigma. A mutation for nectar production
   in A. morio would result in an initial 3.8-fold increase in pollinarium
   removal per visit, but also increase geitonogamous self-pollination from
   less than 10\% of pollen depositions to ca. 40\%. Greater efficiency of
   pollen export will favour deceptive plants when pollinators are
   relatively common and most pollinaria are removed from flowers or when
   inbreeding depression is severe. These findings provide empirical
   support both for Darwin's contention that pollinarium bending is an
   anti-selfing mechanism in orchids and for the idea that floral deception
   serves to maximize the efficiency of pollen export.}},

   the foraging area of Lipotriches notabilis have been observed during
   three years in the Ngaoundere region of Cameroon. The pollen diet of
   this bee is made up mainly of the pollen from Gramineae, notably
   Brachiaria ruziziensis, which is abundant in this area. Corn is also
   visited and the bee contributes indirectly to its pollination via the
   increase of the Pollen release in the air. Since Poaceae do not produce
   nectar, females as well as males of L. notabilis forage from time to
   time on Asteraceae for nectar. The consumption of grass pollen by
   females is also observed. The species nests in clusters that comprises
   about 10 to nearly 100 nests. The nest dug in horizontal ground belongs
   to the progressive type. It comprises a tumulus, a vertical chimney, a
   main vertical duct which can reach 65 cm deep and a mean of three
   lateral and oblique ducts having a length of four to 16 cm which end up
   in one or many successive cells. Cells of lateral ducts are supplied
   simultaneously and closed in a regressive way. A maximum of 10 cells was

   some nests are inhabited by two or three of them. The foraging activity
   of this species takes place in the morning. At about 07:00 at dawn, the
   female opens her nest and flies to the foraging area. After 11:00, there
   is generally no nest left opened. Males were not seeing at the nesting
   site. The mating occurs in the foraging area. The period of activity
   starts with the rainy season in April and ends at the beginning of the

Abstract = {{Verticordia staminosa C. Gardner \& A. S. George staminosa (Myrtaceae)
   is a rare granite endemic shrub that grows in discrete subpopulations on
   one isolated rock outcrop in a remnant of native vegetation in the
   Western Australian wheat belt. Key considerations in assessing the risk
   of extinction for rare plant species in fragmented landscapes are the
   reproductive dependence on a pollinator, breeding system, importance of
   seeds in demography, and regeneration niche. The present study
   determined the extent to which these factors constrain population growth
   in V. staminosa ssp. staminosa. Measurements across nine subpopulations
   on the breeding system, pollinator activity, rates of flowering,
   pollination and seed production, seedling demography, mature plant
   mortality and size-class structure were undertaken over three
   consecutive years. The study species has a mixed mating system with
   similar rates of pollen tube development and fertilization observed in
   self-, cross- and open-pollinated flowers. Floral morphology,
   orientation and the concentration and volume of nectar produced suggest
   some degree of specialization associated with pollination by birds,
   which were occasionally seen visiting flowers. However, feral honey bees
   were the most commonly observed flower visitor and they seem to have
   replaced honeyeaters as the primary pollinator. Honey-bee abundance
   increased with subpopulation size. However, rates of pollination and the
   subsequent proportion of flowers that produced viable seeds were
   independent of subpopulation size. Germination and seedling emergence
   occurred each winter but were greatest in the wettest winter.
   Recruitment was heavily biased towards individuals growing in or over
   cracks/fissures in the rock. Over the 3-year study, recruitment exceeded
   mortality. A relatively unspecialized flower and mixed mating system
   have buffered the taxon against the effects of pollinator disruption.
   Seed production does not constrain population growth. The environmental
   variables of climate and suitable establishment crevices appear to be
   the major constraints to population growth.}},

Abstract = {{1. Traditionally, losses in plant fitness or yield resulting from insect
   damage have been redressed by reducing pest populations using
   insecticides or biocontrol; these approaches rely on the untested
   assumption that reduced plant fitness or yield is caused by diminished
   resources available to damaged plants.
   2. By experimentally manipulating pollination and damage levels
   independently, it is shown that pollination, as well as lack of
   resources, may be limiting to damaged plants in a model
   insect-pollinated crop, cantaloupe.
   3. With enhanced pollination, damaged plants produce as much fruit as
   undamaged plants, even under high damage levels. In contrast, damaged
   plants without supplemental pollination produced significantly less
   fruit than undamaged plants.
   4. This approach is unique in shifting the focus away from reducing pest
   populations and toward enhancing mutualistic interactions. It avoids
   risks posed by insecticides (which also kill pollinators) and by
   biocontrol agents, known threats to native species.
   5. Determining the mechanism underlying compensation sheds light on
   recovery from insect damage in both natural and managed systems. These

Abstract = {{The development of genetically modified (GM) crops has precipitated the
   need for risk assessment and regulation of pollen-mediated gene flow. In
   response to this need we present a mathematical model to predict the
   spatial distribution of outcrossing between progenitor populations of
   oilseed rape. The model combines the processes of pollen dispersal and
   pollination, resulting from wind and insect activity. It includes the
   effects of post-pollination reproductive processes by relating the
   number of progeny to both pollen deposition and competition at the
   stigma. Predictions compare well with a range of experimental results
   for different-sized GM source crops (i.e. 0.0064-0.8 ha) and non-GM
   target crops with different fertilities (i.e. self-fertile to 80\%
   male-sterile). For these comparisons, we represent the variation caused
   by wind and insect exposure as a constrained set of random functions and
   limit the range of insect transport to typical plant-scale distances. In
   addition, the model is used to examine the relative sensitivity to the
   factors that determine gene flow. Target-crop fertility and source-crop
   size are shown to be more important than other factors, including
   background pollen and the natural range of insect activity. The concept
   of isolation distance to regulate gene flow is most effective for
   self-fertile target crops, but is ineffective for male-sterile target
   crops with low background pollen.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of ecological and genetic factors in regulating
   the demographic processes of small populations is unknown for most rare
   plants. Dithyrea maritima (beach spectacle pod; Brassicaceae) is a rare,
   rhizomatously spreading, and self-incompatible herbaceous perennial
   endemic to coastal sand dunes of southern California. Low seed
   production in this species may be caused by insufficient pollinator
   visits, which may be exacerbated by competition for pollinator visits
   from non-native plants that have invaded the coastal dunes. I tested
   this `ecological' hypothesis by removing flowers of Cakile maritima and
   Carpobrotus spp. from three experimental plots on San Nicolas Island. A
   second possible limitation on seed set is low diversity of genets within
   subpopulations, which could lead to scarcity of compatible mates. I
   tested this `genetic' hypothesis by assigning ramets to clones using
   isozymes, and by relating clonal diversity within populations to seed
   set. Removal of non-native plants had no detectable effect on
   pollination service to D. maritima or on seed set, and seed set was
   unrelated to natural variation in pollination service among populations
   within a single year. In contrast, clonal diversity within a 10 m(2)
   patch was a strong predictor of seed set. Hence a genetic factor
   explains spatial variation in seed set on San Nicolas Island. On larger
   spatial and temporal scales, however, pollination service also affects
   patterns of seed set: a shift in pollination from flies in 1998 to bees
   in 1999 probably caused a corresponding increase in seed set across San
   Nicolas Island, while extremely low seed set at another site (San Miguel
   Island) is probably caused by a virtual absence of pollinators there.

Abstract = {{We compared the floral biology of female, male, and cosexual plants in
   sympatric populations of Wurmbea dioica (Colchicaceae) from Western
   Australia to assess evidence that changes in pollination biology
   accompanied a transition between monomorphic to dimorphic sexual systems
   in this species. In W. dioica, sex-specific differences in floral design
   and display, the quantity and quality of rewards, and reproductive
   phenology represent alternative strategies for pollinator attraction and
   the avoidance of self-pollination. Unisexual plants had smaller flowers
   containing less pollen than flowers of cosexuals; males and cosexuals
   produced nectar with higher sugar content than did females. These
   patterns were associated with differences in the composition and
   visitation rates of pollinators. Nectar-foraging flies visited all three
   sexes, but pollen-collecting bees visited only cosexuals. Fly-pollinated
   females achieved greater seed fertility relative to their bee-pollinated
   cosexual relatives, and males and cosexuals received longer and more
   frequent visits than did females. Although there were no differences in
   flower number among sexes, females maintained larger displays throughout
   flowering. In contrast, males and cosexuals staggered both floral
   anthesis and anther dehiscence as mechanisms for promoting enhanced
   pollen dispersal. We propose that sex-based differences in floral design
   and display in W. dioica have mediated a shift in the effectiveness of
   nectar-foraging insects as pollinators and that gender dimorphism
   enforces outcrossing under pollination conditions that would otherwise
   cause selfing. Differences in pollination biology probably also
   contribute to the maintenance of combined versus separate sexes in
   sympatric populations of W. dioica in Western Australia.}},

Abstract = {{Baker's globe mallow, a fire-following mallow endemic to the Modoc
   Plateau of northeast California and southern Oregon, has recently been
   designated a sensitive species. Management conservation decisions for
   such rare species are strengthened by information on natural history,
   but little is known about this plant. Our objectives are to describe
   aspects of its reproductive success in several occurrences of different
   burn age and size, to determine its need for pollinators in sexual
   reproduction, and to identify important flower-visitors. Reproductive
   success (fruits/flower, seeds/fruit) for Baker's globe mallow varied
   significantly across occurrences, and was not associated with age or
   size of burn. There were significant positive correlations between
   fruits/flower and site elevation, and with distance to nearest burn.
   There was no phenological pattern to fruit or seed production, nor were
   clumped plants more likely to produce fruits or seeds than isolated
   plants. Flowers did not set fruit or produce seeds without pollinator
   visitation. The most abundant flower-visitor in most occurrences was
   Diadasia nitidifrons, a native solitary bee that visits only flowers of
   plants in the mallow family. Diadasia nitidifrons was present in all
   Baker's globe mallow occurrences monitored, including those most
   isolated. The plant's need for pollinators, and the tendency for plants
   in occurrences with the highest visitation to set the highest proportion
   of fruits per flower, suggests that Diadasia nitidifrons is vital to the
   reproductive success of Baker's globe mallow if it proves to be superior
   to generalist bees at pollen deposition. Pollinator effectiveness
   comparisons for abundant visitors are needed.}},

   is one of the predominant pollen vectors there. The trial consisted of
   two identical strips (9 m X 45 m) along the forest ground-level discrete
   vegetation having herbaceous diversity. The design was a `V', truncated
   in such a way that the zone, without any vegetation, between the two
   strips varied from 4.5 to 18 m in width. A nest of M. panamica colony

   colours according to each sector of one strip, named the donor strip.
   Almost all bees were marked until their number was nearly balanced

   within the nest, showing high diversity of pollens from outgoing bees,
   rather than incoming ones. The pollen viability study along the body of

Abstract = {{Background and Aims China is one of the centres of geographical
   distribution of Impatiens L. Studies of the pollination ecology of this
   genus in China have, until now, been unreported. Impatiens reptans, a
   species endemic to China, was studied. The aims were to examine the
   pollination ecology and pollination system of this species, to compare
   its pollination ecology with other Impatiens species growing in Sumatra
   and Japan, and to discuss possible reasons for its limited distribution.
   Methods The pollination ecology of I. reptans was studied by carrying
   out continuous observations within three naturally growing populations.
   Its pollination system was studied using different pollination methods,
   marking and counting pollen grains, assessing pollen viability and
   observing pollinator behaviour.
   Key Results The flowering phase of the protandrous I. reptans lasted for
   89 d. The life span of an individual flower was 3.6 d. Primary
   pollinators were honey-bees and bumble-bees. Secondary pollinators were
   diurnal hawk moths and butterflies. Bombus briviceps and Bombus sp. were
   nectar gatherers. The mean nectar sugar concentration was 29.5\%, and
   the mean value of sucrose/glucose + fructose was 0.82. The proportion of
   seed set ranged from 0.857 to 0.873. Distances that seeds were ejected
   ranged from 0.58 to 1.17 m. Percentage seed germination under controlled
   conditions was 23.1. Pollen viability was highest on the day of anthesis
   and thereafter decreased. Ratios of pollen : ovules ranged from 958.8 to
   970.6.
   Conclusions Impatiens reptans reproduces by means of cross-pollination.
   Its dependence on a specialized habitat, a narrow environmental niche, a
   low percentage of seed germination, and habitat loss could be reasons
   for its limited distribution and endemism. Key words: Impatiens reptans,
   Balsaminaceae, pollination ecology, pollination system. (C) 2004 Annals

Abstract = {{For development of an F-1 hybrid of lettuce cultivars, an efficient
   pollinator must be found. To evaluate pollination effects of a candidate
   pollinator, Lasioglossum villosulum trichopse, the foraging behavior and
   pollination ability of this sweat bee were investigated on the flowers
   of male-fertile (MF) and genic male-sterile (GMS) lettuce. Females of
   the sweet bee visited three lettuce cultivars for a short time
   corresponding to each cultivar's full blooming time and showed unique
   foraging behavior on the MF lettuce flower. The flower heads thus
   visited by a single pollen-gathering female sweat bee indicated a seed
   set as high as that of self-pollinated flower heads on a fine day. On
   the GMS lettuce, the rate of seed set was significantly lower in the
   bee-pollinated flower heads than that of hand-pollinated flower heads
   which bloomed on fine days. The low seed set was considered to be
   associated with weather conditions during the experimental period. This
   is the first report of successful F-1 hybrid seed production of lettuce
   using a pollinator insect.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollinators visiting large floral displays may probe several flowers
   in sequence, leading to geitonogamous (among-flower) self-pollination.
   To investigate the relationship between floral display size and patterns
   of pollinator movement, we studied foraging by several pollinator
   species in four replicate arrays of Mimulus ringens (Scrophulariaceae).
   In each array displays were trimmed to two, four, eight and 16 flowers
   per plant.
   2. Bees preferred large displays, and probed more flowers in sequence on
   large than on small displays. However, the proportion of available
   flowers probed decreased with display, resulting in nearly equal floral
   visitation rates across treatments.
   3. Because pollinators probed more flowers in sequence on large
   displays, plants with numerous flowers should experience more
   geitonogamous self-pollination than plants with small displays.
   4. In all four treatments, pollinators frequently visited only one
   flower before leaving the plant. As the first flower probed on a plant
   cannot receive geitonogamous pollen, this potentially reduces selfing
   rates for those flowers, compared to flowers probed late in a long
   visitation sequence on a plant. Such differences among flowers in
   pollination history should increase variation in geitonogamous
   self-pollination among fruits within plants.
   5. The three most abundant pollinator species differed significantly in
   behaviours that could influence plant mating patterns, including number
   of flowers probed per plant; interplant movement distances; and
   grooming. Variation in foraging patterns was also evident among
   individuals within species. These subtle differences in response should
   affect the pollination services provided to plants.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollinators typically visit more flowers on plants with larger floral
   displays, which should present such attractive plants with significant
   pollen transport losses.
   2. Many-flowered plants with hermaphrodite flowers might reduce the
   costs of attractiveness by encouraging fewer sequential flower visits by
   pollinators. One mechanism that accomplishes this is to produce variable
   nectar rewards, which will cause risk-averse foragers to leave the plant
   after visiting fewer flowers.
   3. We test the prediction that within-plant variability in nectar
   production rate increases with the relative number of open flowers on a
   plant. A field survey of nine herbaceous angiosperm species native to
   Alberta, Canada revealed a significant positive correlation between
   nectar variability (measured as standard deviation) and the size of the
   floral display within species. This relationship existed over and above
   the null expectation of a positive correlation between mean and SD.

Abstract = {{1 The presence, concentration and composition of plant secondary
   compounds, which confer plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens,
   vary greatly both within and among individuals. Optimal defence theory
   predicts that plant tissues most closely tied to plant fitness should be
   most defended at the constitutive level, and that more expendable
   tissues should be inducible with damage.
   2 We examined variation in glucosinolate content between leaves and
   petals, as well as among four petal colour morphs of wild radish,
   Raphanus sativus. We predicted greater levels of constitutive defences
   in petals, and greater inducibility of glucosinolates in leaves, based
   on previous studies that could relate leaves and petals to plant
   fitness.
   3 While, overall, optimal defence predictions were supported, individual
   glucosinolates differed in both their degree of inducibility as well as
   in their distribution between tissue types.
   4 Petal colour variants differed in their induced responses to damage,
   but not in their constitutive levels of compounds. Yellow and white
   morphs, which are preferred by the dominant bee pollinators as well as
   by herbivores, were generally less inducible than
   anthocynanin-containing pink and bronze petal morphs.
   5 Pleiotropic effects between petal colour and defence loci, or tight
   linkage between these loci, may allow pollinators to maintain variation
   in secondary chemistry, as well as allow herbivores to influence colour
   morph fitness and prevalence.}},

   aggregata inflorescences to mimic browsing, observing subsequent visits
   by pollinators and nectar-robbers, and adding pollen by hand to flowers
   of some clipped and unclipped plants. Clipping reduced floral display
   size and increased inflorescence branching, but neither hummingbirds,
   the primary pollinators, nor nectar-robbing bumblebees showed any
   preference for unclipped versus clipped plants. Clipping delayed
   flowering; this shift in phenology caused clipped plants to miss the
   peak of hummingbird activity and to have lower per-flower visitation
   rates than unclipped controls in one year, but to have greater overlap
   with birds and higher visitation rates in the subsequent year. In three
   sites and 2 years, clipped plants exposed to natural pollination
   suffered extreme undercompensation, producing on average only 16\% as

   clipping effects on pollination, however, because clipped plants were
   unable to increase fecundity when provided with supplemental pollen by
   hand. Taken altogether, our results suggest that compensation was
   constrained less by indirect effects of browsing on pollination than by
   its direct impacts on resource availability and hence on the ability of
   plants to regrow lost inflorescence tissue and to fill seeds. Exploring
   the physiological and developmental processes involved in regrowth of

Abstract = {{Negative frequency dependent selection (FDS) had been proposed as a
   mechanism for the maintenance of the high levels of variability in
   floral traits of rewardless plants. Thus far the evidence has been
   equivocal for discontinuous traits. We experimentally tested the FDS
   hypothesis for continuous variation in flower color of Psychilis
   monensis, a rewardless, epiphytic orchid of Mona Island, Puerto Rico. P.
   monensis flowers all year long with a peak in June and July. Plants are
   self-incompatible. Individual flowers last 9-15 days if unpollinated.
   Over a 9-month observation of an unmanipulated population, a high
   percentage of plants showed pollinarium removals (79\%) and fruit
   initiation (63\%), but the actual percentage of flowers visited was very
   low (12\%) and final fruit set was as low as the lowest recorded for
   orchids (2.4\%). In a FDS experiment using a Latin Square design, we
   manipulated flower color in three populations. Over 50\% of the
   variation in either male or female reproductive success was explained by
   time and site with no significant effect of treatment except as part of
   a three-way interaction of time x site x treatment. Paired comparisons
   with the controls gave equivocal results for both male and female
   measures of reproductive success. Major community changes had occurred
   during the FDS experiment with flower activity falling dramatically and
   by the third run of the experiment, only P. monensis was in flower.
   Coincidentally, the numbers of effective visits increased with time,
   presumably as pollinators became less discriminating in search of new
   food resources. Thus, negative frequency dependent selection is either
   sporadic or non-existent. Reproductive success was statistically related
   to locality and date, which was reflected in the flowering phenology of
   the local communities. High natural levels of color variation may be
   more influenced by drift than selection.}},

Abstract = {{The seeming ubiquity of spatio-temporal variation in pollination regime
   suggests that flowers ought to be adapted to a wide range of
   pollinators, yet many comparative biologists perceive that in groups
   with complex flowers there is considerable specialization onto
   pollination syndromes. Statistical documentation of such syndromes has
   been presented for very few groups of flowers. Accordingly, we measured,
   for 49 species of Penstemon and close relatives, both the morphology of
   the flowers and visitation by pollinators. We describe the mechanics of
   pollination for representative species. Ordinations show a distinct
   difference between hummingbird-pollinated species and
   hymenopteran-pollinated species. Flower color is particularly good at
   separating hummingbird- from hymenopteran-flowers. Other characters are
   also correlated with this dichotomy. Within the hymen opteran-pollinated
   species, there are additional relationships between floral morphology
   and the size of the principal pollinators. Flowers frequented by large
   bees, such as Xylocopa, have large open vestibules and relatively short
   floral tubes. Flowers frequented by smaller bees, such as Osmia, have
   long narrow floral tubes. Unlike nectar-collecting bees,
   pollen-collecting bees tend to be attracted to flowers of the
   hummingbird syndrome. The overarching pattern was that syndrome
   characterizations were successful at predicting pollination by
   hummingbirds versus Hymenoptera, two types of animals that are

Abstract = {{Observations of insects visiting strongly protandrous flowers of Tolmiea
   menziesii (Saxifragaceae) show that Gnoriste megarrhina
   (Mycetophilidae), a large fungus gnat with a body ca. 7 mm long and a
   proboscis ca. 6.5 mm long, is the primary pollinator. Pollen is
   transferred to ventral portions of the gnat's thorax while it probes for
   an unusually dilute nectar (8.3\% to 12\% sucrose equivalents) produced
   at the base of the floral tube. Grains are transferred to the two
   receptive stigmas on each pistil when it forages for nectar on a female
   phase flower. Pollen load analyses indicate that Tolmiea menziesii may
   be the only nectar source visited by the gnat while it is in bloom.
   While hoverflies (Syrphus spp.) and bumblebees (Bombus spp.) also visit
   T. menziesii flowers, they do not forage for nectar and usually behave
   as pollen robbers visiting only male phase flowers after earlier visits
   by G. megarrhina. When the modes of floral presentation of T. menziesii
   are compared to other species pollinated primarily by micro-dipterans,
   and mycetophilids in particular, there appears to be a floral
   convergence in some spring-flowering, perennial herbs of moist,
   evergreen woodlands and forests. Analyses of open (gnat-pollinated) vs.
   hand-pollinated pistils show that manual cross-pollinations are slightly
   more successful than open pollinations. Fluorescence microscopy confirms
   two sites of self-recognition and rejection within the pistil: following
   controlled self-pollination experiments almost half of the pollen tubes
   produced either stop growing once they reach the top of the ovary and/or
   grow horizontally. The remaining tubes produced by self-pollination
   penetrate ovules but seed is never set. This double mode of
   self-recognition and rejection is similar to the one described for
   Heuchera micrantha var. diversifolia (Saxifragaceae) but may also
   confirm an earlier report of post-zygotic rejection made for Tolmiea.}},

Abstract = {{Filed observations, floral dissections of a representative range of
   Hesperantha species, and pollen load analyses of insects captured on
   many of them indicate that flowers of this African genus are cross
   pollinated by a relatively broad range of insects. The pollination
   ecology of Hesperantha can be divided into four overlapping systems that
   exploit insects of four orders (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, and
   Lepidoptera). Species of the H. falcata type have erect or nodding,
   salver-shaped, strongly fragrant, white flowers that open in the mid to
   late afternoon and evening and are pollinated by long-tongued apid bees
   and/or noctuid moths. Species of the H. pauciflora type have a virtually
   identical floral morphology, but the perianth is yellow or pink to mauve
   or blue and the flowers are usually unscented and are open during the
   day, closing between midday and late afternoon, ca. 16:30 H. Flowers of
   this type are also pollinated by apid bees, but in the southern African
   winter-rainfall zone other effective pollinators include nemestrinid
   flies (Prosoeca) with relatively short probosces and hopliine scarab
   beetles. In H. latifolia type flowers the perianth is pink to magenta or
   red (rarely pale yellow), odorless, opens during the day but has an
   elongate perianth tube exceeding 18 mm in length. These flowers are
   pollinated mainly by long-proboscid flies in the genera Prosoeca and
   Stenobasipteron (Nemestrinidae) or Philoliche (Tabanidae), but the red
   flowers of H. coccinea are pollinated by a guild of large butterflies
   including Papilio and the satyrid Aeropetes. Lastly, H. vaginata has
   odorless and nectarless, short-tubed yellow flowers, usually with
   contrasting dark markings, that open only during the day and are
   pollinated exclusively by the hopliine scarab beetle, Clania
   glenlyonensis. The taxonomic distribution of plant species with these
   pollination systems makes it clear that shifts in pollination systems
   have occurred repeatedly across Hesperantha, although floral morphology
   and nectar biochemistry are relatively conservative. Whether flowers are
   nocturnal, crepuscular, or diurnal, only four variables affect the
   floral ecology: length of the perianth tube, presence or absence of
   floral fragrance, timing of anthesis, and the closely associated trait
   of perianth color. Thus, species with pink, magenta, red, or yellow
   flowers close at night and are rarely fragrant, whereas those with white
   or pale yellow flowers are nearly always fragrant and either open late
   in the day or only at sunset and remain open for most of the night.
   Species show considerable variation in nectar volume and sugar
   concentration, closely correlated with pollination system, while two
   long-tubed species with floral characters typical of long-proboscid fly
   pollination produce no nectar and are inferred to be Batesian or guild
   mimics that achieve pollination by deception.}},

   fertilised ovules, fertilisation rates, and the percentage of marketable
   fruit. The results showed that one colony of this species in a
   greenhouse with approximately 1350 strawberry plants was adequate to
   pollinate `Oso Grande' primary flowers. The contribution of T angustula
   to the weight and shape of primary berries demonstrated that this bee

Abstract = {{We used pollinator observation, flower manipulation, controlled

   a single pollinator visit, but is only partially self-compatible. This
   may be the first direct demonstration of pollinator-facilitated,
   autogamous self-pollen transfer accounting for a significant proportion
   of stigmatic pollen load. Frequent high self-pollen transfer may account
   for the observed low rate of fruit development in open-pollinated
   flowers. Self-pollen tubes reached the base of the style in comparable
   numbers and at the same rate as outcross pollen tubes, with no sign of
   pollen-tube competition favouring outcross pollen. Barriers to greater
   self-fertility occur late, probably through early abortion of selfed
   ovules. We also investigated what impact overlapping distribution with

   such as the increasing anterior divergence of the sternal apodemes and
   the decreasing ratio of posterior to anterior width of the more
   posterior sterna. Other characteristics vary inconsistently among sterna

   large number of apomorphic traits, particularly in the Andrenidae and

Abstract = {{We studied variations in reproductive success, pollinator behaviour, and

   self-incompatible and predominantly pollinated by bumblebees. Bombus
   hypocrita subsp. sapporoensis was a dominant flower visitor in lowland
   populations. It behaved as a nectar robber but contributed as a
   pollinator. A legitimate pollinator, Bombus hypnorum subsp. koropokkrus,
   was common in mountainous areas. Seed production in lowland populations
   was intensively restricted by pollen limitation caused by low
   pollination efficiency of robber-like pollinators, whereas the extent of
   pollen limitation was small in mountain populations. Seed-set success
   under natural pollination significantly decreased in upper flowers
   within inflorescences in every population. Pistil mass, ovule number,
   and corolla mass decreased from bottom to top flowers in every
   population, corresponding to the seed-set pattern. Stamen mass and
   pollen number were almost identical among flower positions in lowland
   populations, whereas they increased from bottom to top flowers in
   mountain populations. Legitimate pollinators showed larger pollen
   removal per visit and tended to visit more flowers during a single stay
   than robber-like pollinators, resulting in more geitonogamous pollen
   flow (i.e., self pollination between flowers). When geitonogamy is
   intense, higher allocation to male function in upper flowers should
   increase donation success because bumblebees tend to leave an
   inflorescence, from upper flowers. These results suggest that pollinator

   cells that are provisioned but lack healthy eggs or developing larvae.
   Dissection of these cells showed that most contained pollen-nectar
   provisions with collapsed eggs or early, pre-defecating larvae, and a
   moderate proportion of them had a provision onto which no egg had been
   laid. Other cells contained incomplete or no provisions along with older
   dead larvae, beetle larvae and their faeces, or saprophytic fungi (as
   hyphae). Most provisions were at least somewhat moist, with 25\% being
   very dry. A significant difference in the moisture condition and in the
   proportions of cell content categories was found among the bee
   populations examined. These results help direct future studies into
   understanding why bee cells are provisioned with nectar and pollen but
   fail to produce mature larvae, and why there are differences in the
   types of failure between commercial populations. X-ray analysis is
   inadequate for determining the true moisture condition and content of
   pollen ball cells. The use of the term pollen ball should be reserved

   ambiguous nature should not be used to implicate bee mortality.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid decline in bumblebee populations within Europe has been linked
   to habitat loss through agricultural intensification, and a
   consequential reduction in the availability of preferred forage plants.
   The successful introduction of four European Bombus species to the South
   Island of New Zealand from England (in 1885 and 1906) provides an
   opportunity to determine how important different forage plants (also
   introduced from the U.K.) are to two severely threatened European
   bumblebee species (Bombus ruderatus and B. subterraneus). In January
   2003 we conducted a survey of bumblebee populations across 70 sites in
   the central and southern South Island, recording which plant species
   were being used as pollen and nectar sources for each Bombus species.
   All four bumblebee species showed a clear preference for plants of
   European origin. Only B. terrestris, the most polylectic species, was
   recorded feeding on native plant species. The longer-tongued bumblebees,
   B. hortorum, B. ruderatus, and B. subterraneus, foraged predominantly on
   just two plant species; Trifolium pratense for both nectar and pollen,
   and Echium vulgare for nectar. These plant species are now declining in
   abundance in the U.K. Our results provide support for the hypothesis
   that the loss of flower-rich meadows, particularly those containing
   populations of Fabaceae species with long corollae, is responsible for
   the decline of bumblebee species across Europe. Comparison with earlier
   bumblebee surveys suggests that long-tongued bumblebees may also be in
   decline in New Zealand, particularly B. subterraneus which is now very

Abstract = {{The impact of coevolutionary interaction between species on adaptive
   radiation processes is analysed with reference to pollination biology
   case studies. Occasional colonization of archipelagos can bring together
   coevolving partners and cause coradiation of the colonizing species,
   e.g. the drepanidids and the lobelioids on Hawaii. Permanent reciprocal
   selective pressure between pairs of coevolving species can lead to a
   coevolutionary race and rapid evolutionary change. This is exemplified
   by spurred flowers and long-tongued flower-visitors. The geographic
   patterning of diffuse coevolution systems can lead to dramatic changes
   in species interactions. In different populations, interaction between
   pollinating and seed-parasitizing Greya moths and their host plants
   varies from mutualism to commensalism and antagonism, depending on the
   presence of copollinators. Asymmetrical coevolution between angiosperms
   and oligolectic flower-visitors may facilitate rapid reproductive
   isolation of populations following a food-plant switch, if the
   oligoleges use their specific food plants as the rendezvous sites.
   Diffuse coevolution between angiosperm species and pollinating insects
   may cause frequent convergent evolution of floral traits such as nectar
   reward instead of pollen reward, floral guides, zygomorphic flowers, or
   mimicry of pollen signals, since the multiple plant species experience
   similar selective pressures via the coevolving partners. Patterns of
   angiosperm adaptive radiation are highlighted in the context of
   coevolution with pollinators. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Tetratheca juncea Smith (Tremandraceae) has undergone a range
   contraction of approx. 50 km in the last 100 years and is now listed as
   a vulnerable sub-shrub restricted to the central and north coast regions
   of New South Wales, Australia. There are approx. 250 populations in a
   110 km north-south distribution and populations are usually small with
   fewer than 50 plants/clumps. The reproductive ecology of the species was
   studied to determine why seed-set is reportedly rare. Flowers are
   bisexual, odourless and nectarless. Flowers are presented dependentally
   and there are eight stamens recurved around the pistil. Anthers are
   poricidal, contain viable pollen and basally contain a deep-red tapetal
   fluid that is slightly oily. Thus flowers are presented for buzz
   pollinators, although none were observed at flowers during our study.
   The species was found to be facultatively xenogamous with only one in 50
   glasshouse flowers setting seed autogamously, i.e. without pollinator
   assistance. Field studies revealed fertile fruit in 24 populations but
   production varied significantly across sites from exceedingly low (0.6
   fruits per plant clump) to low (17 fruits per plant clump). Fruit-set
   ranged from 0 to 65\%, suggesting that pollen vectors exist or that
   autogamy levels in the field are variable and higher than glasshouse
   results. Fruit production did not vary with population size, although in
   three of the five populations in the south-west region more than twice
   as much fruit was produced as in populations elsewhere. A moderately
   strong relationship between foliage volume and fruit : flower ratios
   suggests that bigger plants may be more attractive than smaller plants
   to pollinators. A review of Tetratheca pollination ecology revealed that
   several species are poorly fecund and pollinators are rare. The habitat
   requirements for Tetratheca, a genus of many rare and threatened
   species, is discussed. (C) 2003 Annals of Botany Company.}},

   disease of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in Europe, North America, and

   farm implements, and through air and water. Recent studies in Canada
   reveal that V. albo-atrum can also be spread by insect pests, predators,

Abstract = {{We investigated the flowering phenology, pollinator visitation, and
   fruit set of 25 animal-pollinated woody species in a warm temperate
   secondary forest in Japan. Various species flowered sequentially from
   February to October. The principal pollinators were bumblebees,
   honey-bees, flies and/or beetles and birds; bumblebees and flies/beetles
   pollinated most trees. The duration of flowering was shorter for species
   that bloomed in the middle of the season than it was for species that
   bloomed earlier or later in the season. The timing of flowering was more
   synchronous within species that had a shorter flowering duration; this
   was also detected when phylogenetically independent contrasts were
   calculated. This could be important for the effective pollination of
   species with a short flowering duration because such species bloom
   sequentially over a short period of less than 1 month around May. Fruit
   set was related not to pollinator type, sex expression, flowering
   sequence (in order of the date of peak flowering) or flowering duration,
   but to the relative abundance of the species in the forest. This
   correlation was detected for fly- and beetle-pollinated species but not
   for bumblebee-pollinated species. Thus, relatively rare plant species
   with opportunistic pollinators might experience limited fruit set
   because of insufficient pollinator services. Bagging experiments
   conducted on eight hermaphrodite species revealed that the fruit set of
   bagged flowers was nearly zero, lower than that of control flowers.
   These results indicate the importance of pollinators for successful
   reproduction and thus for the coexistence of plants in this secondary

Abstract = {{It has been debated whether pollination success in nonrewarding plants
   that flower in association with nectar-producing plants will be
   diminished by competition for pollinator visits or, alternatively,
   enhanced through increased local abundance of pollinators (the magnet
   species effect). We experimentally evaluated these effects using the
   nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated
   nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success
   (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was
   significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of
   nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for
   individuals placed outside (similar to20 m away) such patches. These
   results provide support for the existence of a facilitative magnet
   species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A.
   morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we
   correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density
   of sympatric nectar plants in 1-m(2) and 100-m(2) plots centered around
   groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows
   (similar to0.5-2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not
   correlated with the 1-m(2) patch density of G. rivale and A.
   schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with
   density of these nectar plants in 100-m(2) plots. In addition,
   visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to
   the density of A. schoenoprasum at the level of the meadow. Choice
   experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A.
   schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple
   flowers of A. morio more readily (47.6\% of choices) than bees foraging
   on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17\% of choices). Overall
   similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a
   pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing ``magnet{''}
   plant to a nonrewarding plant. We discuss the possibility of a mimicry
   continuum between those orchids that exploit instinctive food-seeking
   behavior of pollinators and those that show an adaptive resemblance to

Title = {{Effects of seed bank disturbance on the fine-scale genetic structure of

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal in most plants is mediated by the movement of seeds and
   pollen, which move genes across the landscape differently. Grevillea
   macleayana is a rare, fire-dependent Australian shrub with large seeds
   lacking adaptations for dispersal; yet it produces inflorescences
   adapted to pollination by highly mobile vertebrates (eg birds).
   Interpreting fine-scale genetic structure in the light of these two
   processes is confounded by the recent imposition of anthropogenic
   disturbances with potentially contrasting genetic consequences: (1) the
   unusual foraging behaviour of exotic honeybees and 2. widespread
   disturbance of the soil-stored seedbank by road building and quarrying.
   To test for evidence of fine-scale genetic structure within G.
   macleayana populations and to test the prediction that such structure
   might be masked by disturbance of the seed bank, we sampled two sites in
   undisturbed habitat and compared their genetic structure with two sites
   that had been strongly affected by road building using a test for
   spatial autocorrelation of genotypes. High selfing levels inferred from
   genotypes at all four sites implies that pollen dispersal is limited.
   Consistent with this, we observed substantial spatial clustering of
   genes at 10 m or less in the two undisturbed populations and argue that
   this reflects the predicted effects of both high selfing levels and
   limited seed dispersal. In contrast, at the two sites disturbed by road
   building, spatial autocorrelation was weak. This suggests there has been
   mixing of the seed bank, counteracting the naturally low dispersal and
   elevated selfing due to honeybees. Pollination between near neighbours
   with reduced relatedness potentially has fitness consequences for G.
   macleayana in disturbed sites.}},

Abstract = {{The floral biology of night-blooming Peniocereus cacti and Datura plants
   was studied in North America's Sonoran Desert. In populations of two
   rare cactus species ( Peniocereus greggii and Peniocereus striatus),
   individual plants bloom synchronously on less than five nights per year
   and are self-incompatible. In contrast, the abundant Datura discolor and
   Datura wrightii bloom nearly continuously from spring to autumn and are
   self-compatible. Flowers of all species studied are visited by hawk
   moths at dusk and by honeybees and native bees the following morning.
   Hawk moths have the appropriate behavior and body dimensions to
   pollinate Peniocereus effectively, but visits are rare. Nonnative
   honeybees also visit P. greggii and may contribute incrementally to
   fruit set. Peniocereus and Datura flowers are highly reflective at all
   wavelengths above 400 nm but lack UV reflectance or contrast. All
   species studied secrete 10-80 muL of sucrose-rich nectar within flared
   corollas so deep that moths must land within them, ensuring pollen
   carriage. These flowers provide rich energetic resources for hawk moths
   because the caloric content of a single flower would support from 3 to
   20 min of hovering flight. Floral scents were more species specific than
   visual cues because D. discolor and D. wrightii emit complex blends of
   terpenoid, benzenoid, aliphatic, and nitrogenous scent compounds,
   whereas flowers of P. greggii produce only eight benzenoid compounds (
   all of which are present in Datura species) and Peniocereus striatus is
   scentless. Peniocereus cacti may benefit from sequential mutualism with
   the more abundant Datura species by way of pollinators nurtured as
   larvae by Datura foliage and as adults by Datura floral nectar.}},

Abstract = {{Akebia quinata is a nectarless monoecious vine and has a flower-size

   In a field experiment, we examined the effects of resemblance between
   male and female flowers on pollinator behavior and the amount of
   geitonogamous pollination. When the same numbers of female and male
   flowers were presented in an artificial floral array, solitary bees
   tended to visit female flowers first and then visit male flowers in a
   foraging sequence. However, when sepals of male flowers were glued to
   female flowers from which the original sepals had been removed to
   produce floral monomorphism, solitary bees frequently moved from male to
   female flowers. Consequently, the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas
   per array visit was increased. The results show that floral monomorphism
   increases geitonogamous pollination, and flower-size dimorphism in A.
   quinata can avoid geitonogamous female 1 male pollination. We discuss
   the effect of pollinator selectivity on the evolution of flower-size

Abstract = {{Classes of blossoms (here defined as pollination units, flowers,
   inflorescences, or flower-inflorescences) of two classification systems
   (Leppik, 1969, and Faegri \& van der Pijl, 1979) were evaluated for
   1,495 samples from 1,235 plant species according to pollination unit,
   pollination system specialization (polyphily, oligophily, monophily, and
   anemophily) and pollinating agent classes. Residual analysis of blossom
   classes according to the Leppik system showed that: polyphilous flowers
   are pleomorphic and stereomorphic; polyphilous inflorescences are
   haplomorphic; monophilous flowers are zygomorphic; and anemophilous
   inflorescences are amorphic. Pleomorphic flowers are pollinated by bees,
   flies, and wasps; stereomorphic flowers are pollinated by bees,
   butterflies, moths, birds, and bats; zygomorphic flowers are pollinated
   by bees, and beetles; and amorphic inflorescences are wind- and
   beetle-pollinated species. Residual analysis of blossom classes
   according to the Faegri \& van der Pijl system showed that: polyphilous
   flowers are mostly dish-, bell-, and tube-blossom types; monophilous
   flowers are flag-, gullet-, and trap-blossom types; and inflorescence
   anemophilous are brush-blossom type. Dish-flowers are pollinated by
   bees, flies, and wasps; tube-flowers are pollinated by butterflies,
   moths, and birds; flag- and gullet-flowers are pollinated by bees-,
   brush-inflorescences are pollinated by wind; and trap-inflorescences are
   pollinated by beetles. Relationships between blossom types (Leppik vs.
   Faegri \& van der Pijl) are statistically significant: (1) amorphic and
   haplomorphic, are each associated with brush-blossoms, (2) actinomorphic
   and pleomorphic blossoms are each associated with dish-blossoms, (3)
   tube and bell-blossoms are associated with stereomorphic blossoms, and
   (4) zygomorphic and paramorphic blossoms are each associated with flag-
   and gullet-blossoms. Further, statistically significant differences were
   found in fruit set in relation to pollination unit, and among blossom
   types in both the Faegri \& van der Pijl and the Leppik systems.
   Inflorescences produced significantly more fruit per flower than the
   pollination unit alone of flower or flower-inflorescence. Gullet-shaped
   blossoms exhibit the lowest fruit set; the highest fruit set is found in
   inconspicuous and trap-blossoms. The lowest values for fruit set are
   found for zygomorphic and paramorphic blossoms, and the highest are
   haplomorphic and actinomorphic blossoms.}},

Abstract = {{The Annonaceae show a broader flower biological radiation than
   originally thought, with flowers being pollinated not only by beetles,
   but also by thrips, flies and even bees. The majority of species have
   hermaphroditic protogynous flowers. Species with white or
   yellowish-white, small, delicate, day-active flowers, may be pollinated
   either solely by thrips, or by thrips and small beetles (e.g., species
   of Bocageopsis, Oxandra, Xylopia). Several of these thrips-pollinated
   species have stamens with an elongated, tongue-like connective.
   Pollination by flies is not well documented for American species,
   notwithstanding it appears to be more common in Old World species, e.g.,
   in the genus Pseuduvaria. The mitriform flowers exhale an unpleasant
   smell, produce nectar in purple-colored petal glands and have a
   sapromyiophilous syndrome. Flies enter the flower center through large
   openings between the inner petals. Beetle-pollinated Annonaceae have
   flowers with comparatively thick and, often, fleshy petals, which,
   during anthesis frequently form a pollination chamber with the petals
   inclining over the flower center. The stamens usually have peltate
   connective shields, probably a device for protection against voracious
   beetles. Some cantharophilous species have flowers which are day-active
   while others are night-active. When they are in their pistillate phase,
   the beetles are attracted by characteristic odor components. They enter
   the pollination chamber and usually remain in the interior of the flower
   until the flower has changed to its staminate phase, when pollen is shed
   and afterwards petals and stamens detach. Two lines of cantharophilous
   Annonaceae are recognizable on the basis of present knowledge. Species
   with smaller and more delicate flowers are pollinated by small beetles
   (Nitidulidae, Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae and Staphylinidae), whereas
   species with large, more robust flowers in the Neotropics are pollinated
   by large beetles of the family Scarabaeidae, subfamily Dynastinae. Some
   species of the cantharophilous Annonaceae, especially the large-flowered
   ones, but also some species with smaller flowers, produce beat during
   anthesis (thermogenesis). Food bodies, developed on the adaxial surfaces
   or sides of the petals, provide unique nourishment possibilities for
   beetles when they stay inside the flowers during the pistillate phase.
   In the staminate stage of the flower, after pollen is shed, beetles also
   feed on pollen. Apparently, no dynastid-flower relationship has evolved
   in Asia and Australia. Pollination by bees was discovered recently in
   Unonopsis guatterioides in Amazonia and Uvaria concava in North
   Queensland: the first by scent-collecting euglossine males and the
   second by pollen-collecting Meliponinae. The general trends in
   morphological/functional floral characteristics in the family are
   discussed in a presumptive phylogenetic context.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic interactions are diverse and widespread and often involve
   multispecies guilds of mutualists competing for access to one or more
   partner species. Despite the ubiquity of these interactions, we know
   little about the dynamics of competition and coexistence within these
   guilds or how interactions between mutualists and their shared resource
   (the partner species) may influence these dynamics. In this article, we
   review the evidence for interspecific competition for partners within
   mutualist guilds in both plant-pollinator and ant-myrmecophyte systems.
   We then review evidence for the operation of different coexistence
   mechanisms within these guilds and discuss how the dynamics of
   competition and coexistence may be uniquely shaped by multispecies
   mutualist interactions. In particular, we note that adaptive and plastic
   responses by mutualists to variation in partner quality are likely to
   play an important role in determining these dynamics. We summarize by
   considering the ecological conditions that are likely to restrict or
   promote species coexistence within mutualist guilds. We suggest that
   these guilds may provide powerful model systems for exploring multiple
   mechanisms of species coexistence, and we discuss how these mechanisms

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, and declines in some
   pollinator communities around the world have been reported.
   Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is
   essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We
   examined the structure of plant-pollinator communities in a dynamic
   Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating
   habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity.
   Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance
   distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was
   consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental
   factors govern the community.
   Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage
   resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities
   at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116
   species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar
   resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar
   volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to
   nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age.
   (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to
   floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and
   post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common
   species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and
   nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on
   age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained
   39-50\% of overall variation observed in bee community structure.
   Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of
   similarity in their species composition (27-59\%); however, the
   geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but
   significant component to bee community structure.
   We conclude that floral resources act in specific and previously
   unexplored ways to modulate the diversity of the local geographic
   species pool, with specific disturbance factors, superimposed upon these
   patterns, mainly affecting the dominant species.}},

   encompasses several closely related species that differ slightly in

   Populations representing different species of the O. sphegodes group
   often flower simultaneously in sympatry. To test whether gene flow
   across the species boundaries occurs in these sympatric populations, or
   whether they are reproductively isolated, we examined the distribution
   of genetic variation within and among populations and species of this
   group. We collected at each of five different localities in southern
   France and Italy two sympatric, co-flowering Ophrys populations,
   representing six Ophrys species in total. The six microsatellite loci
   surveyed were highly variable. Genetic differentiation among
   geographically distant populations of the same species was lower than
   differentiation among sympatric populations of different species.
   However, the strength of genetic differentiation among species was among
   the lowest reported for orchids. Genotype assignment tests and
   marker-based estimates of gene flow revealed that gene flow across
   species boundaries occurred and may account for the low observed

Abstract = {{1. Pollination of crops depends on local agricultural management and the
   quality of adjacent habitats. Lowland coffee Coffea canephora, is an
   important tropical cash crop. Fruit set depends on cross-pollination by
   bees, so inadequate pollination leads to reduced yield. In this study we
   analyse the relationship between bee pollinators, fruit set in coffee,
   and the local and regional agroforestry systems to identify the optimal
   conditions for pollinators.
   2. We analysed the abundance and species composition of coffee
   flower-visiting bees in 15 agroforestry systems differing in distance to
   forest (important for wood-nesting species), light intensity (important
   for ground-nesting species), blossom cover of coffee and
   noncoffee-flowering plants, and species richness of flowering plants (as
   pollen and nectar resources) in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia). We
   examined which factors were most important for optimal pollination
   success. We carried out bagged and open pollination experiments in each
   agroforestry system, to measure the pollination efficiency of 15 bee
   species.
   3. The number of social bee species decreased with distance to forest,
   whereas the number of solitary bee species increased with light
   intensity (less shade) and greater quantities of blossoms.

   cross-pollinated flowers) increased with the diversity and abundance of
   flower-visiting bees. In the agroforestry systems studied, a bee
   community of 20 species or more led to a higher fruit set (95\%) than a
   species-poor bee community of six species (70\% fruit set).
   5. Pollination activity by members of the species-rich solitary bee
   assemblage led to higher levels of fruit set than that arising from
   pollination activity by members of the more abundant social bee
   assemblage.
   6. Synthesis and applications. A species-rich and abundant bee
   assemblage will facilitate high pollination success in lowland coffee.
   This will increase fruit set and coffee yield. Farmers can encourage
   different species of bees through simple management measures such as
   growing coffee in shade beneath a variety of trees; by pruning trees to
   increase levels of sunlight and numbers of flowering herbs; and by
   increasing the availability of nesting sites for solitary bees. Weed
   control and the use of herbicides should be kept to a minimum so that a
   diverse nectar and pollen resource is available to bees throughout the
   year. Natural forests and forest fragments should be preserved in the
   vicinity of coffee agroforestry systems (< 500 m) so that forest-nesting
   social bees can travel easily to the coffee fields to pollinate the
   flowers.}},

Abstract = {{In the previous two papers in this three-part series, we have examined
   visual pigments, ocular media transmission, and colors of the coral reef
   fish of Hawaii. This paper first details aspects of the light field and
   background colors at the microhabitat level on Hawaiian reefs and does
   so from the perspective and scale of fish living on the reef. Second,
   information from all three papers is combined in an attempt to examine
   trends in the visual ecology of reef inhabitants. Our goal is to begin
   to see fish the way they appear to other fish. Observations resulting
   from the combination of results in all three papers include the
   following. Yellow and blue colors on their own are strikingly well
   matched to backgrounds on the reef such as coral and bodies of
   horizontally viewed water. These colors, therefore, depending on
   context, may be important in camouflage as well as conspicuousness. The
   spectral characteristics of fish colors are correlated to the known
   spectral sensitivities in reef fish single cones and are tuned for
   maximum signal reliability when viewed against known backgrounds. The
   optimal positions of spectral sensitivity in a modeled dichromatic
   visual system are generally close to the sensitivities known for reef
   fish. Models also predict that both UV-sensitive and red-sensitive cone
   types are advantageous for a variety of tasks. UV-sensitive cones are
   known in some reef fish, red-sensitive cones have yet to be found.
   Labroid colors, which appear green or blue to us, may he matched to the
   far-red component of chlorophyll reflectance for camouflage. Red
   cave/hole dwelling reef fish are relatively poorly matched to the
   background they are often viewed against but this may be visually
   irrelevant. The model predicts that the task of distinguishing green
   algae from coral is optimized with a relatively long wavelength visual
   pigment pair. Herbivorous grazers whose visual pigments are known
   possess the longest sensitivities so far found. ``Labroid complex
   colors{''} are highly contrasting complementary colors close up but
   combine, because of the spatial addition, which results from low visual
   resolution, at distance, to match background water colors remarkably
   well. Therefore, they are effective for simultaneous communication and
   camouflage.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable conservation management in cultivated landscapes urgently
   needs indicators that provide quantitative links between landscape
   patterns and biodiversity. As a contribution to this aim, the influence
   of the matrix surrounding managed grassland sites on species richness of
   ants, wild bees and vascular plants was investigated at two different
   scales (50 and 200 m radius). In addition, patch variables describing
   habitat quality were included in the analyses. Species richness of the
   three taxa was not significantly inter-correlated. Multiple linear
   regression analysis revealed significant predictor variables for the
   species richness of the different taxa at both matrix scales. The
   variation of the matrix radius had no impact on the variance explanation
   of the regression models. The degree of variance explained by the
   regression models varied between taxa (bees > plants > ants). Moreover,
   the predictive variables were different for the taxa, with the
   regression model for wild bees including both patch and matrix
   variables, that for plants richness including patch variables only, and
   that for ants including matrix variables only. We conclude that
   landscape diversity and percentage cover of certain land-use types might
   serve as useful indicators for species richness at the landscape scale.
   However, the specific response patterns revealed in our study suggest
   that a variety of taxa must be included in this type of approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Two alpine-snowbed shrubs, Phyllodoce caerulea and P. aleutica
   (Ericaceae), co-occur in locales in northern Japan with early to late
   snowmelt, but they have different mating systems. Phyllodoce caerulea is
   an obligate outcrosser in any population, whereas the selfing ability of
   P. aleutica is highly variable among neighboring populations along
   snowmelt gradients: it shows high self-compatibility in early to middle
   snowmelt populations but low self-compatibility in late snowmelt
   populations. We investigated the relationships between pollinator
   availability and mating systems of these species along three snowmelt
   gradients. Relative abundance of flowers and nectar standing crop of P.
   caerulea decreased from early to late snowmelt plots. Bumble bees
   preferred P. caerulea to P. aleutica in early and middle snowmelt plots,
   while their preference shifted to P. aleutica in late snowmelt plots.
   Pollen limitation was severe in P. aleutica in early to middle snowmelt
   plots but it was severe in P. caerulea in late snowmelt plots. Seed-set
   success under natural conditions of P. aleutica was higher than that of
   P. caerulea in all plots. Thus, we infer that the setting ability of P.
   aleutica under pollinator limitation acts as a reproductive assurance.
   We conclude that the interaction through pollination between the
   sympatric species is strong enough to cause a phenotypic change in
   mating system even within a local area.}},

Abstract = {{Floral longevity is assumed to reflect a balance between the benefit of
   increased pollination success and the cost of flower maintenance.
   Flowers of Kalmia latifolia (Ericaceae), mountain laurel, have a long
   duration and can remain viable up to 21 d if unpollinated. I
   experimentally tested whether this long duration increases pollination
   success by clipping stigmas to reduce functional floral longevity to 3-4
   d. Clipping stigmas decreased fruit set from 65\% to only 10\%. Flowers
   with natural life spans were not pollination-limited, demonstrating that
   long floral duration ensured female reproductive success. The long
   floral duration of K. latifolia was unique in this site (the Great
   Swamp, Rhode Island, USA). Coflowering shrubs in summer had a mean
   floral life span of 3.4 d. Spring-flowering species had significantly
   longer mean floral durations (7.2 d). These duration differences may
   reflect seasonal variation in pollinator availability. However, K.
   latifolia flowers in summer, when its humble bee pollinators are
   abundant but it is a poor competitor for bees because its flowers
   produce little nectar. The long floral duration allows K. latifolia to
   outlast coflowering competitors and attract sufficient pollinators. I
   hypothesize that the long floral duration of K. latifolia functions as a
   mechanism for competitive avoidance and reproductive assurance.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator visual systems differ considerably among broad groupings such
   as bees, bats, and birds, and it has been proposed that factors shaping
   the diversity of flower color in tropical plants include differences in
   pollinator perceptual abilities. Within the pollinators of the
   Neotropics, one major difference between taxa is that hummingbirds
   perceive color well across a broad range of wavelengths from 300-660 nm
   whereas most bees perceive color well over a narrower range spanning
   300-550 nm. Thus, hummingbirds can see red and other long-wavelength
   reflection much better than bees. Another factor that could potentially
   influence flower color in tropical forests is the difference in light
   availability among habitats such as gaps, canopy, and forest understory.
   I conducted a survey of floral color in four Neotropical forests using a
   portable spectroradiometer to provide an unbiased measure of color
   reflectance. The primary pollinator agents and light habitats of each
   plant species were classified using primary literature or accounts of
   direct observations by experts. Flower color was not influenced by
   differences in light availability between open and closed habitats but
   was influenced by pollinator visual systems. Specifically, insect
   flowers reflected across a broad range of the spectrum but hummingbird
   flowers reflected mostly long-wavelength light (typically median
   wavelength >585 nm). Thus, hummingbird-pollinated flowers are not tuned
   specifically to hummingbird color sensitivity but instead may decrease
   conspicuousness to bees and other insects that have poor visual
   sensitivity to long-wavelength color.}},

Abstract = {{In the flower of the monogeneric family Cyphiaceae, distributed in
   tropical and southern Africa, a pollen box is formed by the five
   connivent anthers and the headlike style tip as bottom. Pollen with
   abundant pollenkitt is released into this box just before anthesis. The
   flowers either have a salverform shape or are bilabiate with three
   petals forming the upper lip; transitions between these flower types can
   also be observed. On the flower biology, we only can speculate the
   following: ( 1) Flowers with the pollen box represent the ( perhaps
   longlasting) male phase of anthesis. ( 2) In the female phase, the
   anthers are spreading and the mouth of the stylar channel opens
   presumably by disintegration of closing hairs. A mucilaginous secretion
   coming out of the mouth may receive the pollen from pollinators. ( 3)
   Pollinators of the salverform flowers are presumably butterflies,
   whereas pollinators of bilabiate flowers are bees. ( 4) Pollen is
   presumably applied at the proboscis of the butterflies that comes in
   contact with the pollen mass between the anthers. If pollinators are
   bees, pollen may be loaded on the ventral side of the insect (
   sternotribic pollen loading). The insects may press the pollen box down
   - with flower orientation more or less horizontal - so that pollen comes
   out of the pollen box between the upper two anthers. The less elaborate
   pollen presentation in Cyphiaceae is in agreement with a basal position
   of the family within the Campanulales as indicated by recent molecular
   studies.}},

   self-compatible. The characteristics of floral morphology and its highly
   specialized pollination mechanism are efficient in limiting autogamy and
   geitonoganny and favouring cross-pollination. Three species of Euglossa
   were found (E cordata, E perpulchra and an undescribed species) visiting
   the flowers of G. quinquenervis. All these efficiently removed the
   pollinaria of the flowers, which adhered to the posterior margin of the
   scutellum. Even though there was a high pollinaria removal rate by
   pollinators, the reproductive success in the field was extraordinarily
   low. We suggest that low fruit set, despite high pollinator frequency,
   is a result of a combination of the particular phonological
   characteristics of G. quinquenervis, such as short flower longevity and
   low overlap of flowering phases between individuals, leading to the
   reduced population of this orchid in the degraded Atlantic Forest.
   Conservation measures are necessary to guarantee the survival of C.
   quinquenervis in the northern part of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{The tree cactus Opuntia quimilo is one of three known gynodioecious
   cacti. Its flowers deviate from most Opuntias in features that are
   attributable to ornithophily: petals are shiny red in colour, and fleshy
   in consistency, a nectar chamber is present, and stamen seismonasty is
   lacking. Pollinators include large matinal bees (predominantly
   Ptilothrix tricolor and Megachile sp.) and hummingbirds (Chlorostilbon
   aureoventris and Heliomaster furcifer). Hummingbirds rarely visit other
   local Opuntias. Hummingbirds, which are more common in the afternoon,
   prefer female flowers whereas bees prefer hermaphroditic flowers. Female
   flowers have more dilute nectar than hermaphroditic flowers. Under
   experimental conditions female fertility is as high as that of
   hermaphrodites, however, seeds from females always result from
   cross-pollination and from more severe ovule selection (ovule number is
   higher in female flowers). Under natural conditions female plants are
   reproductively more successful than hermaphrodites. Known cases of bird
   pollination in Opuntia and the incidence of ornithophilic features in
   Opuntia and related genera are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the androecium differs in male and hermaphroditic flowers of
   the andromonoecious Solanum carolinense. Although the anthers in male,
   and in the much more abundant hermaphroditic flowers, are the same size
   and they bear the same quantity of pollen, these organs exhibit some
   specialization in the two flower types. Experimental results imply that
   significant roles of the male organs in hermaphroditic flowers are as
   sources of pollinator reward (pollen) in these nectarless flowers, at
   least as near-distance attractive elements, and as landing platforms.
   Evidence for the latter comes from experiments that showed bees visited
   flowers (alighted) that lack stamens with a much lower frequency. In
   contrast, the stamens of the male flowers function primarily as possible
   near-distance attractors and as a source of pollen for reproduction.
   Male flowers are seldom open concurrently with the hermaphroditic
   flowers on the same plant and thus the staminate flowers function
   primarily as pollen donors because they cannot often serve as
   attractants to hermaphroditic flowers.}},

   Wintering durations greater than or equal to 210 d required temperatures
   : 4 degreesC for acceptable survival. Time to emerge following
   incubation at 20 degreesC decreased with increasing wintering duration
   and wintering temperature. Many bees emerged before incubation when

Abstract = {{The shapes, sizes, and chorionic ornamentation of mature oocytes/eggs
   are described along with ovariole and mature oocyte numbers of six
   lineages of primarily South American cleptoparasitic bees. This
   information is related to whether the eggs are introduced into brood
   chambers that are still open and being provisioned by the host female or
   whether the chambers have already been closed by the host females. The
   lineages, all in the Apidae, are as follows: (1) Kelita (Nomadinae:
   Brachynomadini), (2) Isepeolus and Melectoides (Apinae: Isepeolini), (3)
   Leiopodus (Apinae: Protepeolini), (4) Rhathymus (Apinae: Rhathymini),
   (5) Mesoplia and Epiclopus (Apinae: Ericrocidini), and (6) Exaerete
   (Apinae: Euglossini).
   A table in the section on Discussion and Analyses summarizes information
   on mature oocyte/egg size (egg index), total number of mature oocytes,
   mature oocytes per ovariole, and ovariole number (ovariole formula) for
   all taxa of cleptoparasites, worldwide, that have been studied to date.
   It shows that almost all of the Nomadinae have more than the
   plesiomorphic number of ovarioles, a feature also found in two of the
   three studied genera of the Ericrocidini. All other cleptoparasitic
   lineages lack extra ovarioles. The potential selective advantage of
   extra ovarioles is discussed. Also discussed is whether the large number
   of mature oocytes carried by cleptoparasites might result, in part, from
   the length of time required for chorion deposition after the oocytes
   reach maturity.
   The table shows not only that the mature oocytes/eggs of cleptoparasitic
   bees in general tend to be smaller than those of solitary bees, but that
   the mature oocytes/eggs of those cleptoparasites that hide their eggs in
   open host brood cells are significantly smaller than those that
   introduce their eggs into cells that have been closed by the host. The
   potential selective advantages of small egg size in cleptoparasitism are
   explored.
   Lastly, the unusual modified shapes of mature oocytes/eggs and the thick
   chorions of cleptoparasites that oviposit in open host cells are
   attributed to ways of protecting the eggs from discovery and damage by
   returning host females.

   American Stelis elongativentris Parker (Megachilidae: Anthidiini), the
   ovariole and oocyte statistics of which have been published earlier.

Abstract = {{Reproductive assurance is frequently used to explain the evolution of
   selfing but has become controversial from lack of evidence. We studied
   the pollination system of the near carnivorous plant genus Roridula and
   showed that reproductive assurance is important in this system.
   Hemipterans have a digestive mutualism with Roridula and have been
   implicated in pollination but flowers show adaptations to hymenopteran
   pollination. We deduce that hemipterans are the primary pollinators of
   Roridula because seed set is significantly reduced when hemipterans are
   excluded from the flowers. Using allozyme electrophoresis, we show that
   hemipterans are responsible for mostly selfed progeny. Although bees
   still pollinate Roridula on very rare occasions, their exclusion does
   not affect seed set. The complicated floral structures that occur in
   Roridula most likely evolved as adaptations for bee pollination.
   Resident hemipterans facilitate selfing by Roridula, and this acts as a
   reproductive assurance mechanism because it increases seed production
   and ensures that plants still reproduce in the absence of more motile,
   outcrossing pollinators.}},

   mixed with pollen was found adhered to the integument on the parts

   antennae. These trichomes are anatomically identical to the glandular
   scales common in the entire family and are formed by a multicellular
   cuticle-bounded structure, with a foot and head. The secretion is
   accumulated as a milky emulsion under the cuticle, outside the primary
   cell wall, and is liberated by rupture of the cuticle. The composition
   possibly differs from what generally distinguishes these glandular

Abstract = {{I present a new exposition of a model of gene flow by animal-mediated
   pollination between a source population and a sink population. The
   model's parameters describe two elements: (i) the expected portion of
   the source's paternity that extends to the sink population; and (ii) the
   dilution of this portion by within-sink pollinations. The model is
   termed the portion-dilution model (PDM). The PDM is a parametric
   restatement of the conventional view of animal-mediated pollination. In
   principle, it can be applied to plant species in general. I formulate a
   theoretical value of the portion parameter that maximizes gene flow and
   prescribe this as a benchmark against which to judge the performance of
   real systems. Existing foraging theory can be used in solving part of
   the PDM, but a theory for source-to-sink transitions by pollinators is
   currently elusive.}},

   Total visitation rates were generally low, averaging 3.2 visits per

Abstract = {{1. Effects of anther arrangement on pollen deposition and removal in
   hermaphrodite flowers were experimentally quantified to assess the
   ecological significance of stamen structure. The anther arrangement of
   Brassica rapa was modified into six types with respect to anther number
   and the spatial arrangement of long and short stamens. Each anther
   treatment was combined with a nectar-intact and nectar-depleted
   treatment. After single visits by bumblebees in a glasshouse, the visit
   duration to each flower and the number of pollen grains deposited on
   stigmas and pollen grains remaining in long and short anthers were
   measured.
   2. Visits were significantly shorter in nectar-depleted flowers. Short
   anthers also extended visit duration, but modification of the long
   anther arrangement had no effect. Pollen deposition on stigmas depended
   on the number of long anthers and on visit duration. Although an
   increase in long anther number accelerated self-pollination, removal of
   short anthers did not influence pollen deposition.
   3. Pollen removal from long anthers depended on anther treatment and
   visit duration, but not on nectar availability. Any modification of
   anther arrangement tended to increase pollen removal during single
   visits. Long anthers contributed to the decrease in pollen removal per
   visit, while pollen removal from short anthers depended only on visit
   duration. Short anthers appeared to have a different function from the
   restriction of pollen removal during single visits by bumblebees.
   4. Thus, long and short anthers made different contributions to
   pollination efficiency of nectar-feeding bumblebees. The maintenance of
   different types of stamens in Brassicaceae plants (tetradynamous
   stamens) may reflect functional advantages for a diverse pollination
   syndrome if the pollination efficiency of long and short anthers varies
   depending on the type of pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide decline of pollinators may negatively affect the fruit set

   self-fertilizing highland coffee (Coffea arabica) is highly variable and
   related to bee pollination. In a comparison of 24 agroforestry systems
   in Indonesia, the fruit set of coffee could be predicted by the number
   of flower-visiting bee species, and it ranged from ca. 60\% (three
   species) to 90\% (20 species). Diversity, not abundance, explained
   variation in fruit set, so the collective role of a species-rich bee
   community was important for pollination success. Additional experiments
   showed that single flower visits from rare solitary species led to
   higher fruit set than with abundant social species. Pollinator diversity
   was affected by two habitat parameters indicating guild-specific nesting
   requirements: the diversity of social bees decreased with forest
   distance, whereas the diversity of solitary bees increased with light
   intensity of the agroforestry systems. These results give empirical
   evidence for a positive relationship between ecosystem functions such as
   pollination and biodiversity. Conservation of rainforest adjacent to

   Among self-pollinated individuals a large variation was found in the

Abstract = {{To detect plant specialization to pollinator insects and to further

   community. Associations between plant species and insect groups were
   analyzed using binomial tests based on census data obtained from two

   was expressed as a significant deviation of the actual proportion (i.e.
   the proportion of the number of flower visits by the insect group to the
   plant species in the total number of visits to the plant species) of the
   expected proportion (i.e. the proportion of the number of visits by the

   `Preference to a plant species by an insect group' was similarly

   from temporal and spatial variations in the abundance and species
   composition of both flowers and insects. However, in species showing
   variable preferences, significant specialization in the pollinator
   insect group (i.e. relatively constant, mutual preferences) were
   demonstrated for seven and five plant species at the two study sites,

Abstract = {{Entomophilous species that bloom in early spring are more frequently
   confronted with severe pollen limitation and low fruit set than species
   that bloom later. On the other hand, early flowering species may benefit
   by escaping the peak of flower and/or seed predator activity. Previous
   studies have implicated unpredictable weather conditions and the
   inactivity of pollinator and predator insects early in spring as causes
   of severe pollen limitation and light predation in early flowering
   species. However, differences not only in flowering schedule, but also
   in floral morphological traits and breeding systems, could induce
   variations in fruit set and intensity of predation among species.
   Comparing two species while simultaneously observing individual flowers
   within species could help determine the cause of these interspecific
   differences. For four years, I followed the fate of individual flowers,
   from bud to fruit, in two Vaccinium species that bloom successively in
   spring and share pollinators and pre-dispersal seed predators. My
   predictions were as follows: (1) the early flowering species, V. hirtum,
   would not easily gain pollinator services because of low ambient
   temperature, and its fruit set would be low in comparison with the late
   flowering species, V. smallii; (2) the early flowering species would
   avoid attacks by flower and pre-dispersal seed predators via
   phenological escape from the predators' activity peak. Hand-pollination
   experiments showed both species had incomplete self-compatibility, with
   bumblebees required for pollination. As predicted, only the early
   flowering species seemed to suffer from pollen limitation. However,
   Studies of individual flowers suggested that pollen limitation resulted
   not only from pollinator limitation early in spring, but also from
   geitonogamy and reproductive interference between plant species. Moth
   and fly larvae consumed flowers and fruit, while the pre-dispersal seed
   predator was a weevil (Mecysmoderes sp.). Far from escaping flower and
   seed predation, the early flowering species suffered more severe insect
   attacks than the late flowering species in two years out of four.
   Studies of individual flowers clearly showed that flower predators'
   activity was not limited, even in the early weeks of the flowering
   season.}},

   to22-27\%) in managed and cultivated populations. Diurnal pollination
   was similar to35-55\% effective in winter and 100\% in spring. Nocturnal
   pollination was successful only in winter (15\%). Crosses among
   individuals were more effective within populations than among
   populations, including populations under a similar management regimen.
   The least successful crosses were between wild and cultivated
   populations. Flowers were produced in all populations from January to
   March, but flowering peaks differed by 1 mo among wild, managed, and
   cultivated populations and by 2 mo, between wild and cultivated
   populations. The latter interrupted pollen exchange in May. Seeds from
   managed and cultivated populations germinated faster than those from
   wild individuals. Domestication has seemingly favored self-compatible P.
   chichipe plants with higher fruit yield, a longer period of fruit
   production, and faster seed germination, attributes that have resulted
   in partial reproductive barriers between wild and manipulated
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{A long-term survey (1990-2000) of pollination modes of 86 tree species
   was carried out at Kakachi, a mid-elevation wet forest site in southern

   comprises 80\% of the total arborescent species present in the site.
   Approximately 75\% of these species were specialized to a single
   pollinator group such as bee, beetle, or moth. Pollinators from diverse
   groups pollinate the remaining 25\% of the tree species. Global
   comparison with other wet forest sites showed that diversity and
   specialized pollination modes observed in Kakachi bore closer
   resemblance to other lowland than montane forest sites described so far.
   However, the number of pollinators involved in pollination was
   comparable with montane sites. We examine the consequences that might
   have led to selection of the observed pollination modes in Kakachi. We
   discuss the conservation implications of these results.}},

Pages = {{537-552}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of plants that provide no form of reward for their
   pollinators is puzzling because they receive low numbers of pollinator
   visits and so have low reproductive success. To predict the evolutionary
   dynamics of empty morphs within a plant population, we modeled different
   foraging strategies that pollinators could use to avoid them. We
   predicted that the optimal strategy was to visit empty inflorescences
   randomly when these were infrequent but to use strategies such as
   visiting fewer flowers per inflorescence to avoid wasting time on them.
   As the frequencies of empty inflorescences increased, discriminating
   directly against empty morphs was more likely to be an optimal strategy
   than was avoiding the species altogether and switching to an alternative
   one. An experimental test of this model using artificial inflorescences
   showed that bumblebees used a variety of strategies to minimize time
   wasted on empty inflorescences. They showed weak discrimination against
   empty inflorescences but switched to an alternative type of
   inflorescence as the frequency of empty inflorescences increased. We
   predicted that empty morphs would be at a visitation rate disadvantage
   even when at low frequencies in a plant population. Differences in
   outcrossing rates, or male function, may explain how rewardlessness
   spreads in a plant population.}},

   The number of ovarioles is 6 (3 per ovary) in most sphecids (including

   ovarioles in cleptoparasites probably increases the number of eggs that
   a female can deposit. both during tier lifetime and within a given short
   time period, This is probably an adaptation to the patiotemporally
   limited resource of suitable host nests. The number of mature oocytes
   increases from nonparasitic to cleptoparasitic to pseudoparasitoid
   species. Also, parasitic sphecids tend to ha c smaller oocytes than

Abstract = {{Flowers of Sisyrinchium are regarded as fugacious and bee-pollinated. We

   pattern, floral longevity, and frequency and behavior of pollinators of
   Sisyrinchium vaginatum were studied in a high-altitude grassland in the
   Serra da Bocaina, southeastern Brazil. Anthesis starts between 10:00 and
   16:30 h, but most flowers open in the middle of the day. Flowers open
   and close every day, or may remain closed on their second day of
   anthesis, to then re-open the subsequent day. The regulation of flower
   longevity and blooming pattern seems to be endogenous, but climatic
   conditions and pollinator activity may also be involved. As a floral
   reward, the yellow, dish-shaped flowers only offer pollen. Although
   small bees were reported as the main or exclusive pollinators for other
   areas, syrphids were the main pollinators of S. vaginatum in the Serra
   da Bocaina. For this population, the flowering peak occurred during the
   winter, while for populations of other areas it took place during the
   summer. Since, in winter, the diversity and number of small bees is
   extremely reduced in those high-altitude grasslands, the
   syrphid-pollination in the Bocaina's population is probably linked to
   its flowering peak in that season.}},

   conditions are constant throughout the flowering season. However, data

   in early season flowers, anthers dehisce over a number of days, while
   late season flowers present all anthers simultaneously. I show that
   pollinator visitation rates to individual plants are higher but more
   variable early in the season than late in the season. Furthermore,
   per-male availability of female-phase flowers increases over the course
   of the flowering season in this population. I suggest that seasonal

Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-112}},

Abstract = {{Globally, plant-pollinator communities are subject to a diverse array of
   perturbations and in many temperate and semi-arid systems fire is a
   dominant structuring force. We present a novel and highly integrated
   approach, which quantifies, in parallel, the response to fire of
   pollinator communities, floral communities and floral reward structure.
   Mt Carmel, Israel is a recognised bee-flower biodiversity hotspot, and
   using a chronosequence of habitats with differing post-fire ages, we
   follow the changes in plant-pollinator community organisation from
   immediately following a burn until full regeneration of vegetation.
   Initially, fire has a catastrophic effect on these communities, however,
   recovery is rapid with a peak in diversity of both flowers and bees in
   the first 2 years post-fire, followed by a steady decline over the next
   50 years. The regeneration of floral communities is closely matched by
   that of their principal pollinators. At the community level we quantify,
   per unit area of habitat, key parameters of nectar and pollen forage
   known to be of importance in structuring pollinator communities. Nectar
   Volume, nectar water content, nectar concentration and the diversity of
   nectar foraging niches are all greatest immediately following fire with
   a steady decrease as regeneration proceeds. Temporal changes in energy
   availability for nectar, pollen, total energy (nectar + pollen) and
   relative importance of pollen to nectar energy show a similar general
   decline with site age, however, the pattern is less clear owing to the
   highly patchy distribution of floral resources. Changes in floral reward
   structure reflect the general shift from annuals (generally low-reward
   open access flowers) to perennials (mostly high-reward and restricted
   access flowers) as post-fire regeneration ensues. The impact of fire on
   floral communities and their associated rewards have clear implications
   for pollinator community structure and we discuss this and the role of
   other disturbance factors on these systems.}},

Abstract = {{We review the pollination ecology of acacias worldwide, discussing (1)
   the rewards provided to flower visitors, (2) the temporal patterns of
   flowering and reward provision and (3) the taxonomic composition of
   flower visitor assemblages. The flowers of most acacias (including all
   members of the subgenus Phyllodineae) offer only pollen to flower
   visitors and floral nectar is limited to a minority of species in the
   subgenera Acacia and Aculeiferum. The most important pollinators of
   acacias are social and solitary bees, although other insects and
   nectar-feeding birds are important in specific cases. Acacias that
   secrete nectar attract far more species-rich assemblages of flower
   visitors, although many of these are probably not important as
   pollinators. Most acacias in the subgenus Phyllodineae have long-lived
   protogynous flowers, without clear daily patterns in reward provision
   and visitation. In contrast, most members of the other two subgenera
   have flowers that last for a single day, appear to be protandrous and
   have clear daily patterning in reward provision and visitation. The
   generality of these patterns should not be assumed until the pollination
   ecology of many more phyllodinous acacias has been studied, particularly
   in arid environments. The accessibility of the floral rewards in acacia
   flowers makes them important examples of two general issues in plant
   communities-the partitioning of shared pollinators and the evolution of
   floral ant repellents.}},

Abstract = {{Honeybees communicate the distance and location of resource patches by
   bee dances, but this spatial information has rarely been used to study
   their foraging ecology. We analysed, for the first time to the best of
   the authors' knowledge, foraging distances and dance activities of
   honeybees in relation to landscape structure, season and colony using a
   replicated experimental approach on a landscape scale. We compared three
   structurally simple landscapes characterized by a high proportion of
   arable land and large patches, with three complex landscapes with a high
   proportion of semi-natural perennial habitats and low mean patch size.
   Four observation hives were placed in the centre of the landscapes and
   switched at regular intervals between the six landscapes from the
   beginning of May to the end of July.
   A total of 1137 bee dances were observed and decoded. Overall mean
   foraging distance was 1526.1 +/- 37.2 m, the median 1181.5 m and range
   62.1-10 037.1 m. Mean foraging distances of all bees and foraging
   distances of nectar-collecting bees did not significantly differ between
   simple and complex landscapes, but varied between month and colonies.
   Foraging distances of pollen-collecting bees were significantly larger
   in simple (1743 +/- 95.6 m) than in complex landscapes (1543.4 +/- 71 m)
   and highest in June when resources were scarce. Dancing activity, i.e.
   the number of observed bee dances per unit time, was significantly
   higher in complex than in simple landscapes, presumably because of
   larger spatial and temporal variability of resource patches in complex
   landscapes. The results facilitate an understanding of how human
   landscape modification may change the evolutionary significance of bee
   dances and ecological interactions, such as pollination and competition
   between honeybees and other bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Ophrys flowers mimic virgin females of their pollinators, and thereby
   attract males for pollination. Stimulated by scent, the males attempt to
   copulate with flower labella and thereby ensure pollination. Here, we
   show for the first time, to our knowledge, that pollinator attraction in
   sexually deceptive orchids may be based on a few specific chemical
   compounds. Ophrys speculum flowers produce many volatiles, including
   trace amounts of (omega-1)-hydroxy and (omega-1)-oxo acids, especially
   9-hydroxydecanoic acid. These compounds, which are novel in plants,
   prove to be the major components of the female sex pheromone in the
   scoliid wasp Campsoscolia ciliata, and stimulate male copulatory
   behaviour in this pollinator species. The specificity of the signal
   depends primarily on the structure and enantiomeric composition of the
   oxygenated acids, which is the same in wasps and in the orchids. The
   overall composition of the blend differs significantly between the
   orchid and its pollinator and is of secondary importance.
   9-Hydroxydecanoic acid is a rarely occurring compound that until now has
   been identified only in honeybees. Contrary to the standard hypothesis
   that Ophrys flowers produce only `second-class attractivity compounds'
   and are neglected once the pollinator females are present, we show that
   flowers are more attractive to the males than are their own females.}},

   part of the spadix and is the most attractive region, attracted these
   pollinators by emitting volatiles, although the male zone of the

   the protogynous spadix, attracted flies aggregated in the lower part
   (female zone) to mate, lay eggs, and perhaps obtain nutrients. The flies
   moved to the upper part (male zone) of the spadix by the tightening of
   the constriction separating the upper and lower parts, and then the

   promotes outcrossing of A. odora. Removal of the appendix or the whole

Abstract = {{Food limitation can reduce reproductive success directly, as well as

   solitary bee Osmia pumila suffers brood parasitism by the
   cleptoparasitic wasp Sapyga centrata, which enters the host nest to
   oviposit while the female bee is away. I studied foraging and
   reproduction of O. pumila nesting within cages stocked with rich or
   sparse floral resources, and the presence or absence of S. centrata to
   test (1) the response of nesting female O. pumila to food shortages, (2)
   the response of nesting female O. pumila to the presence of parasites,
   and (3) whether brood produced under scarce resources are more likely to
   be parasitized by S. centrata. The rate of brood cell production was
   significantly lower in cages with sparse floral resources, although
   females in sparse cages did not produce significantly fewer brood cells
   overall. Sapyga centrata did not influence the rate of brood cell
   production, but females exposed to the cleptoparasites had marginally
   significantly lower reproductive output. Nests in parasite cages had
   significantly fewer brood cells than those in parasite free cages. The
   mean duration of foraging bouts made by female O. pumila in sparse cages
   was not significantly longer than that in rich cages. O. pumila spent
   less time in the nest between pollen and nectar foraging bouts in sparse
   cages with S. centrata than those in other cages suggesting that these
   individuals made more frequent food foraging trips. Despite the weak
   effects of parasites and bloom density on foraging behavior, O. pumila
   brood cells experienced a 15-fold higher probability of parasitism by S.
   centrata in cages with sparse bloom than in those with rich bloom. These
   results support the hypothesis that indirect effects of food scarcity
   increase O. pumila susceptibility to brood parasitism, although the
   exact mechanism is not entirely clear yet.}},

   effectiveness over two flowering seasons to evaluate their importance to
   plant reproduction. Insects of the order Hymenoptera predominate in A.
   incarnata pollination, but there appears to be no specialization for
   pollination within this order. Pollinators varied significantly in
   nearly every component of effectiveness that we measured, including
   pollen load, removal and deposition of pollen, pollination efficiency
   (deposition/removal), flower-handling time, and potential for
   geitonogamy (fractional pollen deposition). The visitation rate of
   pollinators also varied significantly between years and through time
   within years. Pollination success and percentage fruit-set of
   unmanipulated plants in the population also varied significantly between
   years, and pollination success varied among sample times within years.
   Most components of effectiveness were weakly correlated, suggesting that
   the contributions of visitor species toward pollination varied among
   effectiveness components. Mean flower-handling time, however, was
   strongly correlated with several components, including pollen removal

Abstract = {{The genus Viola is represented by four related species in Brazil
   belonging to section Leptidium, one of the most primitive sections in
   the genus. Floral biology and pollination by bees were studied in Viola
   cerasifolia and V. subdimidiata in high-altitude areas in south-eastern
   Brazil. Flowers are zygomorphic and spurred. The five stamens are
   arranged in a cuff around the ovary, and pollen is released by means of
   apical connective projections, which form a cone surrounding the base of
   the style. The connective projections of the inferior stamens are
   elongated and curved to form a hook-shaped structure. Nectar-secreting
   tissue can occur in the basal connective appendages of the inferior
   stamens, which project into the spur. Flowers of V. subdimidiata
   secreted a mean volume of 0-14 mul nectar over a 24-h period; approx. 40
   \% of flowers did not secrete any nectar. The main pollinators of these
   Viola species are female bees belonging to the genus Anthrenoides
   (Andrenidae), which search mainly for pollen. These bees seem to be
   oligolectic and obtain large amounts of pollen from Viola by vibrating
   the flowers or by moving the hook repeatedly back and forth. Males of
   Anthrenoides patrol Viola clusters and also feed on nectar, acting as
   secondary pollinators. The basic floral structure in the genus Viola
   fits that of `nectar flowers'. The uncommon hook-shaped projections,
   scanty nectar production, and behaviour of pollinators suggest that V.
   cerasifolia and V. subdimidiata are shifting their reward for
   pollinators from nectar to pollen. Based on floral morphology, this
   shift may be widespread in Viola sect. Leptidium. (C) 2003 Annals of

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of forest patch size on the behaviour of
   birds feeding on the flower nectar of the proteaceous tree Embothrium
   coccineum J. R. et G. Forster, which is typically restricted to forest
   edges in agricultural landscapes in southern Chile. We quantified
   reproductive parameters of trees (no. inflorescences per branch, total
   and open flowers per inflorescence) in forest fragments varying from 1
   ha (small), to 20 ha (medium) and to >150 ha (large), and in remnant
   trees in pastures. Visits to flowers by nectar-feeding birds were
   recorded during 30-min observation periods, spread throughout the day
   during two flowering seasons, November 1992 and 1993 (n = 242 periods
   overall). Aggressive encounters among flower visitors were recorded in
   1992. We expected less visits to trees in pastures and small forest
   patches because abundances of Embothrium's main pollinators, the
   flycatcher Elaenia albiceps and the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes,
   decreased in smaller patches. We found, however, that pollinator
   visiting rates were negatively correlated with forest patch area and
   were highest for pasture trees. This trend was largely due a decline in
   the number of visits by E. albiceps , the main flower visitor, in larger
   patches. Hummingbird visits did not change with forest patch size. Lower

Abstract = {{Floral nectar spurs are hypothesized to have had a major role in the
   evolution of floral diversity and plant-pollinator coadaptation. We
   examined variation in the degree of nectar spur curvature in two species
   of jewelweed (Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida) pollinated by
   different sets of pollinators. To distinguish between adaptive and
   nonadaptive explanations for between-species differences in curvature,
   we determined the relationship between spur curvature and pollen
   removal, which is one estimate of male reproductive success. Spur
   curvature exhibited considerable variation both within and among three
   populations, with spur angles ranging from 0degrees to 297degrees. A
   greenhouse experiment determined that spur curvature of I. capensis
   flowers has a broad-sense heritability of 0.636. Laboratory experiments
   indicated that flowers having recurved spurs deposit significantly more
   pollen grains on hummingbird visitors than flowers having perpendicular
   spurs, apparently as a result of greater contact between the androecium
   of curve-spurred flowers and the upper bill of hummingbirds. We also
   found a significant relationship between spur curvature and flower
   length, suggesting a developmental link between the two traits. We
   discuss the degree of spur curvature in bird-pollinated I. capensis as a
   function of both adaptive evolution and developmental constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen movement within and among plants affects levels of inbreeding
   and, plant fitness as well as the spatial scale of genetic
   differentiation. Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a
   function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators;
   however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers,
   may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering
   plant-pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing
   should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen
   dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and
   inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with
   reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect
   effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the
   distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement
   within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen
   analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host,
   Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the
   theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80\% of available
   flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of
   dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were
   50\% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with
   low robbing relative to a plant With high robbing, suggesting that
   pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high
   robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing
   reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I
   manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs
   associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation
   (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed. any advantages associated
   with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the
   negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through
   decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from
   plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased
   geitonogamy. Given the widespread nature of plant attack by nectar
   robbers, these indirect effects are likely common phenomena structuring
   natural plant populations.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Protandry, a form of temporal separation of gender within hermaphroditic
   flowers, may reduce the magnitude of pollen lost to selfing (pollen
   discounting) and also serve to enhance pollen export and outcross siring
   success. Because pollen discounting is strongest when selfing occurs
   between flowers on the same plant, the advantage of protandry may be
   greatest in plants with large floral displays. We tested this hypothesis
   with enclosed, artificial populations of Chamerion angustifolium
   (Onagraceae) by experimentally manipulating protandry (producing
   uniformly adichogamous or mixed protandrous and adichogamous
   populations) and inflorescence size (two-, six-, or 10-flowered
   inflorescences) and measuring pollinator visitation, seed set, female
   outcrossing rate, and outcross siring success. Bees spent more time
   foraging on and visited more flowers of larger inflorescences than
   small. Female outcrossing rates did not vary among inflorescence size
   treatments. However, seed set per fruit decreased with increasing
   inflorescence size, likely as a result of increased abortion of selfed
   embryos, perhaps obscuring the magnitude of geitonogamous selfing.
   Protandrous plants had a marginally higher female outcrossing rate than
   adichogamous plants, but similar seed set. More importantly, protandrous
   plants had, on average, a twofold siring advantage relative to
   adichogamous plants. However, this siring advantage did not increase
   linearly with inflorescence size, suggesting that protandry acts to
   enhance siring success, but not exclusively by reducing between-flower
   interference.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of Notylia nemorosa was elucidated from field
   and ex situ observations. Field observations were carried out in Minas
   Gerais, southeastern Brazil, where this orchid is pollinated by males of
   Eulaema nigrita (Euglossini). Plants cultivated in Campinas (Sao Paulo
   State, southeastern Brazil) were eventually pollinated by males of
   Eulaema nigrita and Euglossa melanothricha (Euglossini). In both cases,
   Euglossini males collect aromatic compounds produced on the surface of
   the lip, fix the pollinaria on the dorsal surface of the labrum and
   perform pollination. This species is protandrous. Recently opened
   flowers present their stigmatic surfaces blocked and thus flowers act
   only as pollen donors. After 2-3 days the viscidium dries out and
   pollinaria cannot be removed anymore. Then, a narrow slit opens in the
   stigmatic cavity, allowing pollen deposition. Experiments performed with
   cultivated plants suggest that this orchid species is strongly, though
   not completely self-incompatible. Pollination experiments showed that
   bees tend to stay several minutes in each inflorescence. This behavior
   may promote some degree of geitonogamous pollination because flowers in
   male and female phases coexist in the same inflorescence. The
   combination of self-incompatibility with this specific pollinator
   behavior may explain the rarity of fruits in several neotropical
   reward-offering Orchidaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting habits of highly social stingless bees (Meliponini) were studied
   in lowland dipterocarp forests in Sabah, Borneo. A total of 275 nests of
   12 species of bees were located. All nests were closely associated with
   living (91.5\%) or dead (8.5\%) trees, either within pre-formed cavities
   in the trunk (cavity nests) or situated in or under the tree base (base
   nests). Species of bees differed in nesting habit. The majority of
   species (seven) were cavity nesters, but the majority of nests (81\%)
   were base nests. Nests were often aggregated (mean of 1.94 nests/nest
   tree), with up to eight colonies and three species in a single tree.
   Nest trees were mostly large to very large (86.1\% above 60 cm dbh)
   commercial timber trees; 47.3\% of nest trees were dipterocarps.
   According to visual inspection nest trees were of significantly lower
   expected timber quality then randomly chosen control trees. Taking into
   account information on tree species, size and expected timber quality,
   we estimated that 34.0 or 42.6\% of nest trees were potential harvest
   trees, depending on harvesting regulations (reduced impact logging (RIL)
   versus conventional). Lower percentages under RIL guidelines were mostly
   due to size restrictions that protect very large trees (>120 cm dbh).
   Harvesting is likely to kill bee colonies associated with the respective
   tree. Therefore, and because meliponine colonies are long-lived and have
   low fecundity, direct impact from logging may have lasting effects on
   bee populations. Harvesting guidelines that retain high proportions of
   large and hollow trees should be promoted in order to preserve
   meliponine pollination in sustainable forest management. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Unlike most social insects, many Cardiocondyla ant species have two male
   morphs: wingless (ergatoid) males, who remain ill the natal nest, and
   winged males who disperse but, strangely, before leaving may also mate
   within the nest. Whereas ergatoid males are highly intolerant of each
   other and fight among themselves, they tend to tolerate their winged
   counterparts. This is despite the fact that these winged males, like
   ergatoid males, represent mating competition. Why should ergatoid males
   tolerate their winged rivals? We developed a mathematical model to
   address this question. Our model focuses on a number of factors likely
   to influence whether ergatoid males are tolerant of winged males:
   ergatoid male-winged male relatedness, number of virgin queens, number
   of winged males, and the number of ejaculates a winged male has (winged
   males are sperm limited, whereas ergatoid males have lifelong
   spermatogenesis). Surprisingly, we found that increasing the number of
   virgin queens favors a kill, strategy, whereas an increase in other
   factors favors a let-live strategy; these predictions appear true for C.
   obscurior and for a number of other Cardiocondyla species. Two further
   aspects, unequal insemination success and multiple mating in queens,
   were also incorporated into the model and predictions made about their
   effects on toleration of winged males. The model is applicable more
   generally in species that have dimorphic males, such as some other ants,

   sugar-water rewards, the colour mauve, and specific floral scents)
   butterflies were tested for their preference for floral versus
   vegetative scents, and to floral scent versus colour. The butterflies
   were also tested for their ability to switch floral scent preferences in
   response to rewards. Flower-naive butterflies demonstrated a preference
   for the floral scent of the butterfly-favourable plants C. arvense and
   K. arvensis over the floral scent of the non-favourable plants Achillea

   scents of either C. arvense, K. arvensis, or B. davidii readily switched
   their floral scent preferences to the one most recently associated with
   reward, thus demonstrating that floral scent constancy is a result from
   learning. These findings suggest that these butterflies use floral scent
   as an important cue signal to initially identify and subsequently
   recognize and distinguish among rewarding plants.}},

Title = {{Genetic transformation in commercial Tasmanian cultivars of opium poppy,

Abstract = {{We report a new transformation protocol for the pharmaceutically
   important opium poppy, Papaver somniferum L.; the protocol allows
   transformation for the first time of high yielding commercial cultivars.
   The method involves Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection of hypocotyl
   explants, followed by the production of antibiotic- or
   herbicide-resistant embryogenic callus and the subsequent induction of
   somatic embryos and plants. Key elements of the improvement are the use
   of buffering agents to stabilise medium pH and bottom-cooling of the
   cultures. Transformation was verified by PCR and Southern blot
   hybridisation. Transcription of transgenes was confirmed by RT-PCR and
   product sequencing. Expression of transgenes was detected by
   histochemical GUS staining, phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT)
   enzyme assays for bar and pat genes, and western analysis of transgenic
   sunflower seed albumin protein. Expression of various transgenes was
   detected in stem, leaf, seed, capsule and latex. The pat gene was
   demonstrated to be stably inherited to the T(2) generation and to confer
   phosphinothricin (PPT) herbicide resistance. Most T(0) plants showed
   normal morphology, were self-fertile and the transgenes displayed the
   expected Mendelian segregation. The percentage of explants producing
   somatic embryos that developed into plantlets able to be transplanted to
   soil, ranged from 6-11\% in two Tasmanian cultivars.
   A field trial using pat transgenic plants was designed to estimate the
   frequency of hybridisation at various distances into buffer rows of
   non-transgenic poppies and to related weed species, P. somniferum spp.
   setigerum and P. dubium. The frequency of hybridisation to completely
   compatible poppy fell sharply with distance, being 2.6\% at 20 cm,
   2.13\% at 0.5 m and falling to 0\% at 2.5 and 5 m. No hybridisation
   could be detected to two weed species under open pollination conditions,
   including the compatible P. somniferum spp. setigerum, when grown as
   close as 20 cm, despite flowering at the same time as the transgenic
   plants in the presence of foraging bees.}},

Abstract = {{Materials and construction methods were investigated to improve
   artificial nests suitable for Osmia rufa that were simple to use and

   stalks, plastic drinking straws, plastic thermoshrink electro-insulating
   tubing, packing paper and grooved wooden laminates (which were assembled
   to form blocks with cylindrical chambers inside); these nesting tubes
   were all 6 mm in diameter and 22 cm long. In 2000 we tested reed, wood,
   cork and wooden tubes lined with plastic sheet used for inkjet printers;
   all tubes were 7 mm in diameter and 18 cm long. We measured the
   percentage of each type of material actively provisioned by female O.
   rufa, the number of the brood cells and cocoons in the tubes, and the
   number of adults that emerged. All nest tubes made of reed and those
   made of printer sheeting inserted into openings in wooden blocks were
   occupied by O. rufa. The greatest mean number of brood cells was found
   in nests made of wood (8.3 in 1999 and 12.2 in 2000). The number of

Abstract = {{Restoration of perennial herbs may be influenced by plant-animal
   interactions. For example, projects may be aided by native pollinators
   or seed dispersers or impeded by herbivores. Our previous work at Jockey
   Hollow, a U.S. National Park, indicated that abundance of native
   woodland herbs was low and herbivory by Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman
   (white-tailed deer) was intense. The goal of our experiment was to test
   the feasibility of herbaceous plant restoration in spite of a large O.
   virginianus herd. By examining small-scale reintroductions of nine
   species of native herbaceous perennials (Asarum canadense L., Geranium
   maculatum L., Mitella diphylla L., Polemonium reptans L., Sanguinaria
   canadensis L., Smilacina racemosa (L.) Desf., Tiarella cordifolia L.,

   and 5\% flowered inside exclosures, while 23\% of plants planted outside
   survived; no plants surviving outside exclosures flowered. Within deer
   exclosures, native bees visited five species and ants dispersed
   Sanguinaria seeds in experimental depots. However pollination and seed
   dispersal occurs only with,protection from O. virginianus. Overabundant
   O. virginianus and the relatively long generation time of perennial
   herbs may prevent restoration of similar plant communities at this time.}},

Abstract = {{Kincaid's lupine (Lupinus sulphureus ssp. kincaidii {[}Smith] Phillips),
   a perennial, leguminous herb of 57 sites in western Oregon and
   Washington, USA, was recently listed as threatened under the federal
   Endangered Species Act. Results from genetic, pollination,
   morphological, mating, and distributional studies describe Kincaid's
   lupine as (a) strongly outcrossing, relying on native insects for most
   pollination; (b) having large, spreading genets within populations: (c)
   once widely distributed and abundant, with high levels of
   interpopulation gene flow; (d) now with isolated populations and a high
   genetic load that might be causing inbreeding depression: and (e) with
   high levels of insect predation on flowers and seeds that contribute to
   poor reproductive success. Conservation efforts for Kincaid's lupine are
   often linked with conservation of the closely associated Fender's blue
   butterfly (Icaricia icarioides fenderi {[}Macy]), for which it is the
   main larval host plant, and have focused on stopping habitat destruction
   and on managing and restoring habitat. Reducing prairie dominance by
   tall, herbaceous weeds and woody plants increases Kincaid's lupine
   vigor. Reestablishment of Kincaid's lupine is possible but requires
   large numbers of seeds and protection of seedlings from crowding.
   Further research into the genetics, symbiotic associations, demography,
   and habitat requirements of Kincaid's lupine is needed for effective
   recovery of this threatened species.}},

Journal = {{NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{217-223}},
Abstract = {{An apparent predominance of plant taxa with pale flowers in the alpine
   floras of Australia and New Zealand may be due to the prevalence of
   insects, such as flies, that prefer pale colours and the absence of
   other types of potential pollinators that are attracted to bright
   colours such as social bees and birds. In this study, the diversity of
   flower colours, and the preference of insects for different colours were
   examined for the largest contiguous alpine area in Australia, around Mt
   Kosciuszko. Out of an alpine flora of 204 taxa, 127 species were found
   to have large showy flowers. The most common flower colour among these
   taxa was white (53.5\%), then yellow (21.3\%), followed by pink (6.3\%),
   and cream (6.3\%). Only a handful of taxa had red, blue, brown, green,
   orange or purple flowers. When the colour preference of insects was
   tested using five different coloured traps (white, yellow, orange, red
   and purple), the most successful traps were white then yellow, with
   these two colours accounting for 66\% of all individual insects
   collected. Diptera were the most common insects caught (576 insects
   greater than 4 mm in length, 31 morphotaxa) showing an apparent
   preference for white and yellow coloured traps over others. Therefore,
   the results add some support to the proposition that the `white' flora
   of the Australian Alps may be associated with the colour preference of
   flies, which have previously been found to be the most common type of
   pollinators in the Kosciuszko alpine zone.}},

Abstract = {{We relate nectar sugar composition with floral visitors in samples from
   two biogeographic regions from Argentina: Chaco (99 spp. from its
   southern region) and Patagonia (48 spp. from its central region), using
   our own data published in earlier papers. The variables to be compared
   were sugar ratio and sucrose percentage. Differences in the sugar
   composition were observed when comparing both regions. Bee- and
   butterfly-visited Patagonian species showed lower sucrose percentages
   and sugar ratios than Chaquean species; i.e., a convergence in sugar
   composition was not verified. Moth-visited species showed a wide range
   of sucrose proportions and sugar ratios in both regions with no
   significant differences between them. As the differences found in sugar
   ratio between Chaco and Patagonia, according to the predominant
   pollinator guilds, may have been influenced by the sample size, we
   searched for similarities in sugar ratios between plants with the same
   visitor type in a comparative way, comparing our data pooled together
   against data by Baker and Baker's (1983a). Our data do not agree with
   theirs, i.e., no trends can be drawn for bees, moths, and butterflies
   sugar preferences. The exceptions were the hummingbird-visited species
   that showed a similar pattern in both cases, i.e., there is a
   convergence among plants offering nectar with a predominance of sucrose.
   To evaluate whether closely related species within a family have similar
   nectar composition and flower visitors, regardless of their region,
   sugar proportions were compared in several families. Hexose nectars were
   predominant in Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, and Verbenaceae, while
   sucrose nectars prevailed in Bromeliaceae and Onagraceae. Nectar
   composition seems to be a more conservative trait than flower
   morphology. This may be a reason to explain the absence of a convergence
   in sugar composition between plants growing in different biogeographical
   regions that share the same animal visitor guilds.}},

Abstract = {{Various aspects of the reproductive biology of Atamisquea emarginata
   Miers ex Hook. et Arn. were studied in a population from Tucuman,
   northern Argentina. Flowering took place in late (austral) spring to
   early summer. The creamy white, entomophilous flowers were protandrous
   and lasted 3.5-4.5 days. A pleasant odor along with nectar and pollen
   attracted 36 mostly diurnal insect species of which 41.7\% were
   Hymenoptera, 38.9\% Lepidoptera and 19.4\% Diptera. However, 75\% from
   all recorded species were infrequent, and domestic bees made ca. 94\% of
   all visits. One halictid bee, one sphecid wasp, one myzinid wasp, four
   small- to medium-sized butterflies and a hawkmoth completed the set of
   relatively frequent insect visitors. Pollen and stigma were presented in
   the same place within the flower, but interference was prevented by a
   movement-assisted, complete dichogamy mechanism in which the bending
   ability of the gynophore played a fundamental role. This form of
   dichogamy was previously unknown in the Capparaceae. In comparison with
   the known species of the closely allied genus Capparis L., A. emarginata
   has diurnal, smaller, longer-lasting flowers, that offer much smaller
   nectar amounts, and that attract a rather generalized array of
   non-hovering visitors, while Capparis behaves as a more
   crepuscular-biased sphingophile or ornithophile or chiropterophile. Low
   levels of seed set under bagging indicates dependence on insect visits
   and are partly congruent with an earlier report of self-incompatibility
   in A. emarginata. Pollen tubes arrived to ovules in 90.6\% of the
   inspected flowers. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers was
   43.6\%-53.7\%. Ninety-five percent of all ovules were regularly aborted
   in each fruiting ovary; thus, each fruit contained 1.2 developed seeds.

Abstract = {{Biotic pollination should be an important consideration when devising
   management plans for endangered plant species. In this study we
   documented inter-annual shifts in the suite of floral visitors to
   Clematis socialis, a federally endangered species. These pollinator
   shifts were correlated with shifts in climatic variables that we used as
   a proxy for the potential effects of climatic change. In addition, we
   characterized floral visitor behavior and conducted single-visit seed
   set experiments to assess the pollination effectiveness of floral
   visitors. Five insect species visited flowers of C. socialis: two
   lepidopteran species (Erynnis juvenalis and Hemaris diffinis) and three
   bee species (Anthophora ursina, Bombus pennsylvanicus and Xylocopa
   virginica). Due to their relatively greater frequency of flower
   visitation and high single-visit seed set (ca. 2.6-3 seeds/visit), two
   bee species (Anthophora ursina and Bombus pennsylvanicus) are considered
   to be the major pollinators of C. socialis. However, the relative
   importance of each pollinator species varied between years. Anthophora
   ursina was the most important pollinator in 1997, a year when C.
   socialis bloomed later in the spring. Queens of Boinbus pennsylvanicus
   were the primary pollinator during 1996, a year when C. socialis bloomed
   relatively early in the spring. We conclude that management plans that
   focus on the ``best pollinator{''} of a suite of pollinators may not
   preserve the long-term reproductive integrity of endangered plants with
   generalized pollination systems. We further conclude that asynchrony

Abstract = {{A phylogeny for genus Agapostemon (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) is
   reconstructed from morphological characters, using all species, with
   four representatives of Agapostemonini as outgroup taxa. Parsimony
   analysis using 150 unordered characters resulted in eighteen equally
   parsimonious trees, a strict temon. Based on this analysis, consensus of
   which is highly resolved for Agapostemon. Based on this analysis,
   Agapostemonoides Roberts \& Brooks is returned to generic status, and a
   new subgenus is described: Notagapostemon, which includes the
   rhopalocerus, heterurus, atrocaeruleus, erebus, kohliellus, nasutus and
   intermedius groups of Moure \& Hurd. Species groups are proposed for
   Notagapostemon and revised in A. (Agapostemon). Agapostemon cockerelli
   Crawford is synonymized with A. obliquus (Provancher), A. epichryseus
   (Morelos) with A. leunculus Vachal, A. inca Roberts with A. heterurus
   Cockerell, A. hispaniolicus Roberts female with A. centratus (Vachal)
   and A. hispaniolicus Roberts male with A. alayoi Roberts. Optimization
   of known behaviours suggests communal ancestry for the genus and infers
   the prevalence of this behaviour in Agapostemon. Optimization of
   geographical range suggests a Central American or Caribbean origin of
   Agapostemon, with one invasion of North America and multiple invasions
   of South America and the Caribbean. One invasion of the Caribbean
   suggests arrival from North America via Florida.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns are important cues for flower detection and recognition
   by nectar-feeding insects. Pattern vision has been studied in much
   detail in bees and flies but rarely in butterflies and moths. In this
   paper, I present a first proof of pattern-learning abilities in a moth,
   and discuss reasons for the limitations to their pattern learning. The
   diurnal hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum spontaneously prefers
   patterned to uniformly coloured stimuli but can be trained to choose the
   uniform stimulus. By contrast, experience does not override the innate
   preferences for radial over tangential patterns, and for tangential over
   striped patterns. These results do not reflect bad visual discrimination
   but rather a lack of learning ability and motivation to abolish innate
   preferences. I propose that radial and tangential flower patterns are
   good predictors of nectar reward, a condition under which learning is
   unlikely to evolve. These patterns serve not only as cues for flower
   detection but also as guides to the reward. Hovering pollinators
   strongly depend on these guides and should therefore: (i) have rigid
   pattern preferences; and (ii) not be motivated to abolish these
   preferences as easily as their innate preferences for colours.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report observations of flower visitors of the endemic
   Echium wildpretii in Tenerife, Canary Islands. This plant inhabits the
   high altitudinal sub-alpine zone, which is characterized by a harsh
   climate, low species diversity and a short growing season. Echium
   wildpretii is a monocarpic perennial, producing a 2-3 m column-shaped,
   red-flowered, nectar-rich inflorescence. Although these floral traits
   have previously been suggested as being typical of ornithophilous
   flowers, this is the first study reporting observations of native birds
   (Phylloscopus collybita and Serinus canarius) in addition to insects
   visiting the flowers for nectar. The purposes of this study were firstly
   to, investigate levels of visitation by native birds, native insects,
   and introduced honey bees. Secondly, we studied the influence of floral
   display (plant height and number of flowers), nearest neighbours
   (distance and size) and local vegetation structure on visitation rate.
   Finally, we discuss the evolution of ornithophily in an otherwise
   entomophilous plant lineage. We found that the level of bird visitation
   was relatively high early in the flowering season, but decreased in
   mid/late season, while the opposite pattern was found for introduced
   honey bees. For native insects, the frequency of visits was similar in
   early and late season. Bird visits were correlated with floral display.
   In the early season, visitation rates of honey bees and the two most
   common native bee species were correlated with size of the plant or its
   nearest neighbours, consistent with preference patterns for larger
   resource patches. Since only insects visit the flowers of other species
   in the Echium clade, E. wildpretii appears to have evolved from a truly
   insect-pollinated lineage. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{Populations of Eichhornia azurea (Swartz) Kunth (Pontederiaceae) are
   often composed of three floral morphs that differ in style length and
   anther position. Hence, E. azurea is described as tristylous. For sexual
   reproduction the plant requires specialized pollinators able to transfer
   pollen from flowers with long-, mid-, or short-level anthers to flowers
   with long-, mid-, or short-styles, respectively. This is because within
   a floral morph, self-incompatibility is the rule. Populations of E.
   azurea were studied from six localities in south-eastern Brazil (Sao
   Paulo and Minas Gerais). The frequencies of floral morphs, floral
   morphology and flower-visiting bees were recorded in each population.
   Ten different bee species were observed visiting plants. Four of them
   were considered generalist bees and not appropriate for legitimate
   pollination of the three floral morphs. Another three species were
   considered opportunists and only three species were considered to be
   potential pollinators. At the coastal region (Jureia), the plant
   population lacked the short-styled morph and the mid-styled morph and
   exhibited a semi-homostylous condition, in which the low-level anthers
   were adjacent to the stigma. This morph showed high level of
   self-compatibility. The disappearance of the short-styled morph from
   this region is likely correlated with the absence of Ancyloscelis gigas
   Friese, a specialized long-tongued bee that is oligolectic on this plant
   in other localities. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{I address how floral complexity influences geitonogamous
   self-pollination through manipulation of pollinator behavior in Salvia
   nipponica. The pivoting stamens of S. nipponica hinder nectar-collecting
   bumblebees from crawling into flowers, increasing the probing time per
   flower. I predicted that longer probing times would reduce the relative
   cost of moving between plants, causing bees to leave plants earlier. To
   test this prediction, I simplified S. nipponica flowers by removing the
   stamens from all open flowers within a 75-m(2) quadrat. Bumblebees
   probed these flowers more quickly than intact flowers, but the stamen
   removal affected neither the frequency of flower revisitation nor the
   flight distance between plants. In response to the decrease in the
   probing time per flower, bees probed more flowers on these plants.
   Therefore, in S. nipponica, floral complexity reduces the opportunity
   for geitonogamous self-pollination. Stamen removal also increased bee
   visitation per flower, suggesting that this sort of complexity deters
   visitation. To keep complex flowers attractive, therefore, selection
   might increase floral rewards or longevity. Floral complexity might
   evolve in an integrative manner with the rest of the floral phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in the interactions among plants and animals is

   of nectar robbing and the strength of its effects on plant fitness, we
   know relatively little about the magnitude and, intensity of spatial and

   purpose of the present study was to quantify spatial and temporal
   variation in the interactions between a nectar-robbing bumblebee and its
   host plants. In the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA, over 7 years, and
   multiple locations, we measured levels of nectar robbing by the

   host plants, Delphinium nuttallianum (Ranunculaceae), Ipomopsis

   robbing rates experienced by different species. Within species, there
   was variation in robbing rates on an annual basis, on a seasonal basis,

   important consequences with respect to the population dynamics of host

Abstract = {{Specialization of a plant on a particular pollinator may not evolve if
   co-pollinators are effective and abundant. This is particularly evident
   if fruit set is resource limited and cannot be increased above the
   levels produced by the actions of co-pollinators. The pollinating
   seed-consuming interaction between senita cacti and senita moths in the
   Sonoran Desert presents a paradox because it exhibits many traits
   resembling those of the highly specialized yucca/yucca moth system, but
   also involves co-pollinators. For 6 years, we studied how contributions
   of nocturnal senita moths and diurnal co-pollinating bees to fruit set
   depended on resource and pollen limitation, time of flower closing, and
   the onset and phenology of flowering. Fruit set was typically resource
   limited. Fruit set of flowers exposed only to senita moths was not
   different from resource-limited fruit set of control flowers. When only
   co-pollinating bees were allowed to visit flowers, however, fruit set
   became pollen limited. Only in one year when fruit set was pollen
   limited were bees able to increase fruit set beyond the level resulting
   from senita moth pollination. High temperatures commonly induced flowers
   to close before sunrise so that diurnal bees were unable to visit
   flowers. This was particularly important from 1998 to 2000, when
   flowering did not begin until late in spring when temperatures were
   already high enough to induce flowers to close before sunrise. Bees were
   typically functionally redundant with senita moths; excluding bees from
   visiting flowers did not alter fruit set. Nevertheless, extreme
   specialization of floral traits to exclude co-pollinators has not
   evolved in senita, possibly because there are times when bees do
   increase fruit set. This can occur when senita moths are rare, fruit set
   is pollen limited, cool temperatures prevent flowers from closing before
   sunrise, and flowering begins early in spring.}},

   head-space adsorption and were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Most of the 108 compounds recorded were of isoprenoid
   origin, but only 28 of the compounds were found in all 62 samples

   confirming that G. macrostachys var. macrostachys is outbreeding and
   indicating that the individual populations are part of a metapopulation
   linked by sufficient gene flow to avoid local differentiation. However,
   a negative correlation between distance and similarity of floral scent
   chemistry indicates a case of clinal variation within the distribution
   area of G. macrostachys. Male euglossine bees are infrequent visitors to
   G. macrostachys, while other groups of insects are abundant. However,
   the level of variation and the chemical composition lend support to a

Abstract = {{We analyse the hypothesis that predictable gradients occur in
   plant-pollinator interactions along altitudinal gradients due to thermal
   constraints on insect body size and floral traits being selected for by
   pollinators. Pollinators' size should follow Bergmann's rule in
   mountains (larger body size at higher altitudes) and selection should,
   in turn, lead to larger flower size at higher altitudes. The study
   focuses on the flower and pollinator size variation in 11 Cytisus
   scoparius populations located between 680 and 1300 m a.s.l., and on the
   relationship between flower size and pollination success of plants in
   each population. Significant differences among populations were found in
   flower size, pollinator size and fruiting success (ANOVA, P < 0.001 in
   all cases). Regression models show that (i) pollinator size increases
   significantly with altitude, (ii) a parallel quadratic increase in
   flower size and (iii) a quadratic decrease in pollination success with
   altitude. Moreover, there is a tendency of plants with smaller flowers
   in each population to have a higher percentage of flowers initiating
   development into fruits (ANCOVA, P < 0.05). All these observations

Abstract = {{Ant-acacias represent a classic insect-plant mutualism: the ants defend
   the plant from attack by herbivores, and in return are provided with
   trophic rewards and living space within swollen thorns. A potential
   drawback of this and other ant-plant mutualisms is that ant-guards may
   drive away useful insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the
   potential for ant-pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant-acacia, Acacia
   hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex
   veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is
   provided with extrafloral nectar and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Acacia
   hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were
   visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time
   period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on
   young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped
   substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources
   exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth,
   while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year.
   Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older, leaves near
   inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant-pollinator conflict.
   Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce
   an avoidance response in its ant-guards, which reinforces spatial
   segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect,is absent from
   buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two
   non-myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less
   potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant-repellents
   in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic analyses of four plastid DNA regions, the rbeL exon, trnL
   intron, trnL-trnF intergenic spacer, and rps16 intron from each of 73
   species in the African genus Moraea (Iridaceae: Irideae) including
   accessions of all major species clusters in the genus, show Moraea to be
   paraphyletic when Barnardiella, Galaxia, Hexaglottis, Homeria (all
   southern African), and Gynandriris (Eurasian as well) were recognized as
   separate genera. There are several small, isolated species clusters at
   the basal nodes of the tree that are all restricted to the
   winter-rainfall zone of southern Africa (the Greater Cape floral
   kingdom) and a few, highly derived, large species groups that have
   radiated extensively within the winter-rainfall zone. Mapping of floral
   traits shows that an Iris-type flower is ancestral in Moraea. Floral
   changes are associated with shifts in pollination systems, either from
   passive pollen deposition on long-tongued bees foraging for nectar to
   active pollen collection by female bees foraging for pollen, fly, or
   hopliine scarab beetle pollination. Dating the nodes of the phylogenetic
   tree using non-parametric rate smoothing with a calibration point
   derived from broad dating of the angiosperms indicates that the
   divergence between Moraea and its sister genus Ferraria occurred about
   25 mya in the early Miocene. The early radiation of Moraea took place
   against a background of aridification and the spread of open habitats,
   such as desert, shrubland, and fynbos. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In this study we quantify the relative rates and amounts of
   between-morph (legitimate) cross-pollination, within-morph
   (illegitimate) cross-pollination and self-pollination in a natural
   population of distylous Gaertnera vaginata (Rubiaceae) endemic to the
   oceanic island of La Reunion in the Indian Ocean. Since pollen size
   distributions of each morph overlap we develop a method, based on
   chi-squared comparisons of observed to expected pollen size
   distributions, to quantify pollen transfer proficiencies. This method,
   unlike previous methods, does not assume an equal chance of pollen
   transfer for pollen grains in the region of overlap. The probability
   that a single pollen grain from a short-styled plant undergoes
   legitimate pollen transfer to long-styled flowers (4.19 x 10(-2)) was
   more than twice that for illegitimate transfer to other short-styled
   plants (1.56 x 10(-2)). In contrast, the probability that a single
   pollen grain from a long-styled flower undergoes legitimate pollen
   transfer to short-styled flowers (1.65 x 10(-2)) was no greater than
   that of illegitimate pollen transfer to other long-styled plants (2.15 x
   10(-2)). The transfer proficiencies of individual pollen grains are thus
   highly asymmetric. However, because long-styled flowers produce
   significantly more pollen, the ratio of legitimate to illegitimate
   pollen on the stigmas of short-styled flowers (1.85) markedly exceeded
   that for long-styled flowers (1.11). Short-styled flowers incurred
   significantly higher levels of self-pollination than long-styled plants,
   emphasizing the importance for self-pollination to be removed before
   comparing stigmatic pollen loads. The method we propose could be applied
   to other distylous species with pollen size overlap between morphs and
   thus allow for a more widespread study of the pollination ecology of
   heterostylous species.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are expected to respond to low reward availability in an
   inflorescence by visiting fewer flowers before departure, thus
   potentially causing reduced visitation, but also reduced geitonogamous
   selfing. I tested this hypothesis using Anacamptis morio, an orchid that
   does not reward its pollinators. Supplementation of inflorescences with
   artificial nectar did not result in an increase in fruit set on
   supplemented inflorescences compared to control inflorescences and
   tended to reduce pollinia removal. Supplementation resulted in reduced
   fruit quality, but there was no evidence that this was as a result of
   inbreeding depression. Behavioral experiments showed that pollinating
   humble bees, as predicted, visited more flowers on supplemented
   inflorescences. Bumble bees also deposited more self-pollen on
   supplemented inflorescences, but this was marginally significant. Bumble
   bee queens removed significantly more pollinia from control
   inflorescences, while Bombus terrestris and B. lucorum workers did not.
   I conclude that while pollinators behaved as predicted, there was weak
   evidence that pollinia removal, pollen deposition, and fruit set
   followed the predictions of the hypothesis. I argue that this was
   probably because some pollinators were more efficient at removing and
   depositing pollen on control inflorescences, while others were not.}},

Abstract = {{The study explores whether or not there are convergent patterns in
   floral scent composition among plant species that completely or
   partially rely on butterflies for pollination. Floral scent compounds
   were analysed from 22 flowering butterfly-pollinated plant species,
   representing 13 families which originate mainly from temperate North
   Europe but also from tropical and temperate America. Scents were
   collected using the dynamic headspace adsorption method and identified
   with coupled gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In total,
   217 floral scent compounds were identified, with the number per species
   ranging from 8 to 65. The major emerging pattern is the occurrence of
   certain compounds emitted exclusively by the flowers of many of the
   investigated species in major amounts - the benzenoids
   phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, the monoterpenes linalool and
   linalool oxide (furanoid) I and II and the irregular terpene
   oxoisophorone. It is likely that these compounds serve as a signal to
   attract pollinating butterflies, and may have evolved in conjunction
   with the sensory capabilities of butterflies as a specific group of
   pollinators. While there is convergence in terms of the compounds
   sharing this function there has been a geographical divergence in terms
   of their relative abundance. The predominance (in terms of both numbers
   and relative amount) of benzenoids in many of the scent blends of the
   European temperate species and of linalool and its derivatives in those
   of the American species constitute two discernible groups among these

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of habitat fragmentation on the pollinator
   diversity and reproductive success of seven perennial plant species in
   renosterveld shrublands in South Africa. We sampled pollinators in small
   (0.5-2 ha), medium (3-10 ha), and large (>30 ha) habitat fragments
   during the peak flowering period in spring and summer. We also compared
   fruit set and seed set in the seven plant species on different-sized
   fragments. Hand-pollinated controls were used to determine pollination
   deficits in three species. Seed-germination studies were done on two
   species to determine the effect of reduced seed set on reproductive
   output. Overall, the species richness of bees, flies, and butterflies
   did not vary significantly among different-sized fragments. However, the
   abundance of particular species of bees and monkey beetles
   (Scarabaeidae: Hopliini) was significantly affected by fragment size,
   together with other factors such as vegetation cover and the ratio of
   grass to shrubs. Fragment size and distance to large remnants of
   vegetation had a significant influence on seed or fruit set in four of
   the seven plant species examined. One species failed to set any seed in
   small- and medium-sized fragments. Comparisons of fruit and seed set
   among hand-pollinated and naturally pollinated plants confirmed that
   seed set was pollinator-limited in the orchid Pterygodium catholicum .
   Our results suggest that perennial plant species respond in different
   ways to fragmentation, and that populations on small fragments do not
   always experience pollination deficits. Existing classifications of
   pollination systems, in relation to their vulnerability to
   fragmentation, do not adequately explain our results. We argue that
   there needs to be a greater focus on the habitat requirements of
   pollinators to predict the effects of habitat fragmentation on
   pollination systems and plant reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care is thought to increase offspring success but entails a
   cost in terms of a decrease in the parent's ability for subsequent
   reproduction. Females of most bees and wasps show extensive parental
   care. Thus, they are ideal organisms to study the expenditure for
   offspring production and the resulting costs of reproduction. We
   examined parental behaviour in the solitary bee Osmia ruff (Linne 1758)
   (Hymenoptera Megachilidae) by use of a new method that allows
   observation of within nest behaviour and quantification of most aspects
   of nest construction and provisioning. The method does not cause
   disturbance of provisioning females and does not increase immature
   mortality. To characterise maternal expenditure we recorded the number
   of foraging trips and the time spent for one brood cell, the duration of
   single foraging trips to gather provisions and loam (for brood cell
   partitions), and the amount of provisions and loam gathered per trip. We
   predicted that, due to the large expenditure for provisioning, females
   would loose weight in the course of the flight season. Alternatively, a
   weight loss could be caused by decreasing ambient temperatures and a
   shortage of food resources. Our results show that female O. rufa lost
   mass towards the end of the flight season. Though ambient temperatures
   had some effect, the high expenditure for reproduction were probably the
   major cause of the weight loss. The weight loss was independent of the
   rate of brood cell construction but was significantly more pronounced in
   smaller females. Thus, if the weight loss represents a cost of
   reproduction our results suggest that the magnitude or type of cost

   By changing the calyx tube length, the flowers of C. stans accept the

Abstract = {{1. Habitat requirements of solitary bees include nesting sites, food

   establish foraging distances and measured foraging trip duration to
   analyse how solitary bees cope with the distance between nesting sites
   and suitable food plants in different habitat types.
   2. Maximum foraging distance between nesting site and food patch was
   150-600 m for the 16 bee species examined. Foraging distance was
   correlated positively with body length. Mean foraging trip duration,
   measured for seven bee species, ranged from 6 to 28 min and was also
   correlated with body length. In a study of the polylectic species Osmia
   rufa, we found a significant decrease in foraging trip duration with
   increasing number of plant species. Logistic regressions showed that the
   oligolectic Megachile lapponica nested in trap nests with a probability
   of 50\% if the distance between trap nest and food patch was less than
   250 m. The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the
   distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m.

   sustaining viable populations must be within this range. Therefore, it
   is necessary to maintain and restore a dense network of habitat patches

Abstract = {{We present a model that predicts the level of gene flow mediated by
   animal pollinators from a source population to a sink population. The
   model requires specification of three elements: (1) the paternity that
   originates from a single flower, the paternity shadow; (2) the mean
   number of flowers that pollinators visit during stays in the sink
   population, the residence; (3) the proportion of pollinators arriving at
   the sink that carry pollen from the source population. Provided that
   pollinators visit enough flowers in the sink to exhaust the paternity
   shadows from the source, the general results are that gene flow is
   inversely proportional to the mean pollinator residence in the sink
   population, and is proportional to the fraction of pollinators arriving
   with pollen from the source. These results are used to propose
   explanations for two of the widely observed patterns in gene flow among
   plant populations. Numerical solutions to the model are derived using
   experimentally determined values of elements (1) and (2) that represent
   bumblebees, Bombus spp., visiting agricultural fields of oilseed rape,
   Brassica napus L. In B. napus, the paternity shadow attenuates rapidly
   over approximately 20 recipient flowers. Mean bumblebee residences in
   the fields studied varied between 490 and 720 flowers. In the absence of
   a direct measurement of element (3), we calculated the maximum level of
   bumblebee-mediated gene flow by assuming that all bees arrived at the
   sink saturated with pollen from extrinsic sources. In this case, the
   model predicts that bumblebee-mediated gene flow accounted for between
   0.1\% and 0.5\% of the progeny in the agricultural fields studied. A
   likelihood analysis Of Our observations is unable to reveal convincingly
   the proportion of bees arriving at the sink via a source population, but
   the literature suggests that bumblebees have high site fidelity, which
   implies that bee-mediated gene flow may be substantially less than our
   estimated maximum. We consider the role of various factors, including
   wind pollination, in accounting for the differences between the model's
   predictions and the generally higher levels of gene flow observed in
   previous studies of oilseed rape.}},

Abstract = {{Data on pollination biology constitute important clues for the
   comprehension of pollen flow and genetic differentiation in plant
   populations. Pollinator type, availability and behaviour may modify
   morphological and mating patterns in populations of typically distylous
   species. This study investigates the pollination biology of four
   distylous species of Rubiaceae in the Atlantic rain forest, SE Brazil.
   Data on flowering phenology, floral lifespan, stigmatic receptivity,
   pollen availability, nectar volume and concentration, and pollinator
   activity were collected. The species studied flower sequentially
   throughout the wet season, and produce terminal inflorescences which
   bear small, tubular, diurnal, nectariferous flowers. Despite these
   similarities, some of the species studied are pollinated by different
   groups of pollinators, probably due to their distribution, availability
   of flowers and corolla length. On the other hand, pollinator specificity
   does not seem to be so important for distylous species. Long mouthparts,
   like those of most of the recorded pollinators, may reach lower sexual
   organs and, together with the self- and intramorph-incompatibilities
   observed, be sufficient to perform legitimate pollination and maintain
   levels of intermorph mating.}},

Abstract = {{Silene alba, a perennial, dioecious plant, produces flowers that open in

   different kinds of pollinators with differential success: moths visit
   the flowers at night. and their movements result in broad pollen
   dispersal and large seed production, whereas bees, wasps, and flies
   visit the flowers in the mornings and have decreased pollination
   effectiveness. However, this differential succeed may be due to a
   decrease in stigmatic receptivity soon after the flowers open. We
   performed controlled pollinations to determine the effect of stigma age
   on pollen germination and seed set We pollinated flowers at 12-h
   intervals up to 120 h and divided these into two sets. from one set. we
   removed stigmas 24 h after pollination to examine percentage of pollen
   germination. The second set of flowers was allowed to produce fruits,
   and the seeds were counted and weighed. Pollen germination declined
   significantly with stigma age, but there was no significant effect of
   stigma age at pollination on the number or mass of resulting seeds.
   Thus, the decreased pollination success of bees is not due to a decrease
   in stigmatic receptivity but is most likely a result of pollinator
   inefficiency.}},

   structure by hand-pollinating plants at increasing distances and
   measuring fruit set (berries/pollinated flowers) and seed number per
   fruit in natural populations of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) and
   lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.). Bagging of the flower buds
   without natural (pollination by insects) or hand-pollination yielded
   almost no fruit or seed, suggesting that the species are obligately

   seed number per fruit and increased seed abortion compared with
   cross-pollination. Moreover, seed number increased with increasing
   distance between the pollen donor and pollen recipient. Flight distances
   of bumblebees were estimated for bilberry by monitoring between-flower
   and, for lingonberry, between-inflorescence flight distances. About 90\%
   of all flights were at distances of less than 1 m. At this distance, we

Abstract = {{Tropical landscapes are dominated by agroecosystems, and most species

Abstract = {{1. Patterns of pollinator responses to variation in floral display size
   have significance for pollen flow among plants. Here we test a
   theoretical model for explaining such patterns by simultaneously
   assessing bumble bee behaviour and nectar availability in two native
   stands of Cirsium purpuratum with different spatial densities.
   2. A bumble bee (Bombus diversus ) foraging on a plant remembered and
   avoided only one or two flower heads that it had probed before, so that
   the flower-head revisitation rate increased as it stayed longer on a
   plant. Moreover, the revisitation rate increased less rapidly on larger
   displays.
   3. The number of heads probed per plant increased less than
   proportionally with display size, and this increase was smaller at
   higher plant density. This pattern is consistent with our expectation
   that a bee leaves a plant when the cost of flower-head revisitation
   exceeds that of interplant movement. However, bees left plants slightly
   earlier than predicted.
   4. As predicted, the visitation rate of bees per plant showed a
   decelerated increase with floral display size, and this increase was
   greater at higher plant density.
   5. As a result of these complementary changes in the number of heads
   probed per plant and visitation rate per plant across plant densities,
   nectar rewards per head were equalized among displays (an ideal free

   biological information and immature stages reflected this relationship.
   Tetrapedia diversipes normally nests in holes in wood such as old beetle
   burrows, and it was induced to use trap nests for this study. Many
   aspects of the nesting behavior of females of this species are
   described, including the following: diurnal flight period; sleeping
   habits; nest structure; nest provisioning; egg placement; and sequence
   of nest construction, provisioning, and oviposition. Eggs produced by
   this species are categorized as ``giant{''} (K. Iwata and S.F. Sakagami.
   1966. Gigantism and dwarfism in bee eggs in relation to the mode of
   life, with notes on the number of ovarioles. Japanese Journal of Ecology
   16: 4-16). Its first instar was discovered to be pharate within the
   chorion while the following four instars actively feed. Defecation
   starts early in the last larval stadium. Females use floral oils both in
   nest construction and in provisioning, and they carry pollen, oil, and
   soil with their scopae. The biology of T. diversipes was compared with
   that of other species in the genus and then compared with that of other
   apines that are known to nest in preformed cavities and that provision
   nests with pollen and floral oils.
   The host-nest searching behavior of Coelioxoides waltheriae is
   described. The cleptoparasite introduces its egg into the closed cell of
   the host shortly after cell closure. This egg is characterized as
   ``small{''} (Iwata and Sakagami, ibid.) and has a very short incubation
   period. The highly modified first instar immediately feeds on the host
   egg and grows remarkably fast on the host yolk. This species has only
   four instars.
   Rates of development of the host and cleptoparasite are compared. Both
   have four ovarioles per ovary. Eggs, first instars, last larval instars,
   and pupae of host and cleptoparasite are taxonomically described and
   compared. In conclusion, the immatures of Coelioxoides and Tetrapedia
   are quite distinct from those of other known apids. While these two
   genera are probably sister genera based on the similarities identified
   by Roig-Alsina (op. cit.) and by this study, they are quite different
   from one another based on features of the eggs, first instars, and
   pupae.}},

   species, and one rewardless putative mimic species (Dactylorhiza
   sambucina) which had two colour morphs. We found that when bees were
   inexperienced, they visited both rewardless morphs randomly. However,
   after bees had gained experience with the rewarding model, and it was
   removed from the experiment, bees resampled preferentially the
   rewardless morph most similar to it in corolla colour. This is the first
   clear evidence, to our knowledge, that pollinators could select for
   floral mimicry. We suggest that floral mimicry can be a selective force
   acting on rewardless orchids, but only under some ecological conditions.
   In particular, we argue that selection on early-flowering rewardless
   orchids that receive visits from a large pool of naive pollinators will
   be weakly influenced by mimicry.}},

Abstract = {{Bee-flies (Bombyliidae) have morphological adaptations of the mouthparts
   to particular floral traits. To investigate this the short,
   plesiomorphic proboscis of Hemipenthes morio was compared with the long,
   apomorphic proboscis of Bombylius major. A novel feeding position
   enables B. major to use flowers that open to the side as additional
   nectar sources. The new horizontal feeding position is enabled by the
   prolonged ventral base of the proboscis. Bombylius major exploits deep
   corolla tubes with an elongate proboscis, and an increased efficiency in
   both the suction pumps and the sealing mechanisms of the proboscis. The
   exploitation of narrow corolla tubes is made possible by the shift from
   a sponging feeding mode, exhibited by H. morio, to the exclusively
   sucking mode in B. major. Besides quantitative changes in the
   proportions of the different proboscis components, labellar movements as
   well as the structures of saliva distribution are changed along with
   this shift. The labial musculature of B. major does not significantly
   differ from the plesiomorphic state, since both examined species do not
   only feed on nectar, but also on pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Caldesia grandis Samuelsson is an endangered wetland herb on the brink
   of extinction in the vast area of Mainland China, which holds close to
   one eighth of the world's vascular plant species. The pollination
   ecology and breeding system of C. grandis were investigated from three
   natural populations occurring in two wetlands near the top of Mangshan
   Mountain in Hunan Province, central China. The species is in flower from
   early July to late September with a peak in August. The process of
   flower anthesis in C. grandis begins at about 10.00 am and lasts about
   four- and-one-quarter h. The flowers lasted ca. 5.5 h. Caldesia grandis
   is self-compatible; however, autogamy resulted in lower seed set than
   geitonogamy and xenogamy as well as free pollination. Both pollen
   viability and the seed set in open-pollinated controls at the same site
   were typically high (65.44\% and 71.78\% respectively). Mean pollen:
   ovule ratios in the three populations ranged from 901.75 to 931.354. No
   seed germination was observed, either in the field or in laboratory
   experiments. Propagation is achieved through turions, which commonly
   occur in the inflorescences. Flies (Insecta; Diptera) were the most
   frequent visitors to the flowers of C. grandis; however, bees (Insecta;
   Hymenoptera) composed a larger proportion of effective pollinators.
   Existence analysis revealed a peak of mortality density in mid-May
   corresponding to an environmental sieve in the period following the
   establishment of plantlets. An updated diagnostic of the conservation
   status of C. grandis in China was formulated. The main threats to this
   species are catastrophic events, especially human impact activities
   (agriculture, hobbyists' collections, and infrastructure construction).
   Establishment of a monitoring program is proposed, and both in-situ and
   ex-situ strategies are recommended for effective conservation of C.
   grandis.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted laboratory experiments assessing the relationship between
   commercial greenhouse polyethylene coverings and bumble bee, Bombus
   impatiens Cresson (Hymenoptera: Apidae), activity and loss from
   ventilation systems. Bee activity was measured in four small
   greenhouses, each with a different polyethylene covering. Bee activity
   was quantified using photodiode tunnels mounted in the hive entrances.
   Contrary to commercial greenhouse experiments. there was no difference
   in bee activity based on covering type. There was a positive linear
   relationship between temperature in the experimental greenhouses and bee
   activity. The potential for bee loss through open ventilation systems
   for five covering types was quantified using a Y-maze decision box. Bees
   were more attracted to direct light than to light transmitted through
   ultraviolet (UV) blocking coverings, whereas bees were equally attracted
   to direct light as they were to UV-transmitting coverings. These
   experiments suggest that greenhouses with UV-transmitting plastics may
   result in less bee loss through ventilation systems.}},
