Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine the floral traits of eight
   cultivars of sour passion fruit and identify their pollinators, as well
   as to evaluate the influence of natural pollination on fruit quality, in
   the region of Tangara da Serra, MT, Brazil. A completely randomized
   experimental design was carried out, with ten replicates and one flower
   per plot to evaluate morphometry, and with four replicates and five
   flowers per cultivar to determine the fruiting rate. The following
   parameters were evaluated: flower morphology and morphometry, flower
   longevity, frequency of floral visitors, natural fruiting rate, and
   fruit quality. Flower morphology and morphometry were compatible with
   pollination by large-size bees; they were also compatible with
   pollination by medium-size bees for the cultivars IAC-275-Maravilha,
   IAC-277-Joia, BRS SC1, BRS RC, and BRS GA1. The greatest flower
   longevity was observed for the IAC-277-Joia, BRS GA1, BRS RC, and BRS
   OV1 cultivars. The frequency of bees as Xylocopa (2.0\%) and Bombus
   (3.9\%) was low, and `BRS GA1' received the highest number of these bee
   visits. Natural fruiting rate was low (36.67\%). Naturally pollinated
   fruit show physical traits compatible with those required by the market
   standards.}},

Abstract = {{This monograph deals with all 95 names described in the Cucurbitaceae
   genus Coccinia and recognizes 25 species. Taxonomic novelties are
   Coccinia adoensis var. aurantiaca (C.Jeffrey) Holstein, stat. nov., C.
   sessilifolia var. variifolia (A. Meeuse) Holstein, stat. nov., and C.
   adoensis var. jeffreyana Holstein, var. nov. For the 25 species 3157
   collections were examined, of which 2024 were georeferenced to produce
   distribution maps. All species are distributed in sub-Saharan Africa
   with one species, C. grandis, extending from Senegal in West Africa east
   to Indonesia and being naturalized on Pacific Islands, in Australia, the
   Caribbean, and South America. Coccinia species are dioecious creepers or
   climbers with simple or bifid tendrils that occupy a range of habitats
   from arid scrubland, woodlands to lowland rainforest and mist forest.
   The corolla of Coccinia species is sympetalous, usually pale yellow to
   orange, and 1 to 4.5 cm long. Pollination is by bees foraging for pollen
   or nectar. After pollination, the developing ovary often exhibits
   longitudinal mottling, which usually disappears during maturation. All
   species produce berries with a pericarp in reddish colors (orange-red
   through to scarlet red), hence the generic name. The globose to
   cylindrical fruits contain numerous grayish-beige flat to lenticular
   seeds. Chromosome numbers are 2n = 20, 24, and 22 + XX/XY. Many Coccinia
   species are used for food, either as roasted tubers, greens as spinach,
   or the fruits as vegetables. Medicinal value is established in C.
   grandis, of which leaves and sap are used against diabetes.}},

Title = {{Theoretical predictions of plant-pollinator interactions in sympatric
   species of Psychotria (Rubiaceae) in Cerrado of Brazil}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{148}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{229-236}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - In highly seasonal habitats, sympatric species are
   often constrained to flower simultaneously. Many sympatric species of
   Psychotria have similar floral traits, are pollinated by bees, moths,
   butterflies and flies and flower at the same time of year. This genus
   provides an opportunity to analyse the relationships between sympatric
   congeneric plants and pollinators. Interactions between potentially
   sympatric Psychotria species and their pollinators were surveyed to
   assess the occurrence of sharing, specialisation, or generalisation of
   pollinators and plants in the system.
   Methods - A dataset compiled from studies of pollination biology of this
   genus was used to investigate aspects of interactions with shared
   pollinators and flowering overlap. These data were used to draw a
   bipartite graph and analyse the interaction network and degree of niche
   overlap.
   Key results - In total, the dataset included eight species of
   potentially co-occurring Psychotria species, which interacted with 24
   species of pollinators. The most generalised plant in the network was
   Psychotria trichophoroides. The pollinators with the highest number of
   links, and therefore the most important for the network, belonged to
   orders Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. Pollinators were shared among
   Psychotria species, thus pollination niches did overlap (theta = 0.20,
   P-random (>=) (observed) = 0.04), and plants of this genus depended on
   pollinators that were generalists among them.
   Conclusion - The peak of overlap in flowering phenology, when all of the
   species may potentially co-flower, coincided with the Cerrado rainy
   season. Since all Psychotria species occurred in sympatry, overlapped in
   flowering phenology, and had asymmetric interactions with floral
   visitors, it is possible that pollination facilitation is present in
   this system.}},

Abstract = {{Series Crocus comprises ten autumn-flowering species, including the

   variation was examined in all species of the series, except for C.
   naqabensis. Intraspecific genetic and morphological variation was
   considered in the three Greek endemics, C. cartwrightianus, C.
   hadriaticus and C. oreocreticus. Genetic variation was evaluated based
   on amplified fragment length polymorphism and simple sequence repeats
   analyses, including 94 and 233 specimens, respectively. Analysis of
   molecular variance demonstrated significant genetic variation within
   populations, compared with low genetic variation between populations
   suggesting substantial gene flow between populations. In Neighbour-Net
   analysis, C. hadriaticus samples from mainland Greece were separated
   from Peloponnesian samples; C. cartwrightianus, C. hadriaticus and C.
   oreocreticus generally were grouped with C. sativus samples. Pollination
   and maintenance of genetic variation are discussed. The large
   intraspecific variation found within the three specifically studied
   species reflects dynamic population structures with potential to meet
   future ecological fluctuations. It emphasises a large gene pool which
   should be considered by including a larger number of accessions in

Abstract = {{Living organisms can use minute structures to manipulate the reflection
   of light and display colours based on interference. There has been
   debate in recent literature over whether the diffractive optical effects
   produced by epoxy replicas of petals with folded cuticles persist and

   pigment and illumination are taken into account. We explored the optical
   properties of the petal of Hibiscus trionum by macro-imaging, scanning
   and transmission electron microscopy, and visible and ultraviolet (UV)
   angle-resolved spectroscopy of the petal. The flower of Hibiscus trionum
   is visibly iridescent, and the iridescence can be captured
   photographically. The iridescence derives from a diffraction grating
   generated by folds of the cuticle. The iridescence of the petal can be
   quantitatively characterized by spectrometric measurements with several
   square-millimetres of sample area illuminated. The flower of Hibiscus
   trionum has the potential to interact with its pollinators (honeybees,

Abstract = {{Evidence for declining populations of both wild and managed bees has
   raised concern about a potential global pollination crisis. Strategies
   to mitigate bee loss generally aim to enhance floral resources. However,
   we do not really know whether loss of preferred floral resources is the
   key driver of bee decline because accurate assessment of host plant
   preferences is difficult, particularly for species that have become
   rare. Here we examine whether population trends of wild bees in The
   Netherlands can be explained by trends in host plants, and how this
   relates to other factors such as climate change. We determined host
   plant preference of bee species using pollen loads on specimens in
   entomological collections that were collected before the onset of their
   decline, and used atlas data to quantify population trends of bee
   species and their host plants. We show that decline of preferred host
   plant species was one of two main factors associated with bee decline.
   Bee body size, the other main factor, was negatively related to
   population trend, which, because larger bee species have larger pollen
   requirements than smaller species, may also point toward food limitation
   as a key factor driving wild bee loss. Diet breadth and other potential
   factors such as length of flight period or climate change sensitivity
   were not important in explaining twentieth century bee population
   trends. These results highlight the species-specific nature of wild bee
   decline and indicate that mitigation strategies will only be effective
   if they target the specific host plants of declining species.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies analyze the interactions between plants and their
   pollinators in ecological communities using a network approach. However,
   field studies rarely record all the interactions occurring in the field.
   In this sense Natural History Collections (NHCs) can provide information
   on interactions that may have been missed by field sampling. In this
   study we compare a network based on field sampling with a network based
   on data retrieved from specimens at NHCs, and we assess the degree to
   which these two sources of data are complementary. For this we used data
   available from a bee biodiversity study conducted in Southern Argentina
   for the South American bee genus Corynura (Halictidae: Augochlorini).
   Data on the floral associations of the specimens at NHCs were retrieved
   from the specimens' labels, as the name of the plant species on which a
   given bee was captured is often recorded for many specimens at NHCs.
   Although field sampling recorded an unusually high number of
   insect-plant interactions, it misses some unique interactions present in
   the NHCs networks. Some structural properties of these networks are
   briefly analyzed, and usefulness and limitations of using NHCs data are
   discussed. We conclude that the information about insect-plant
   interactions extracted from NHCs could complement field-based data,

Abstract = {{High tree species richness in the western Amazon has been attributed to
   heterogeneous soils, which harbor edaphic specialist trees. While rapid
   transitions in tree communities are well documented across these
   variable soils, few studies have investigated the role of habitat
   heterogeneity in structuring animal communities. Stingless bees are
   taxonomically diverse and important natural pollinators in Neotropical
   forests. However, little is known about their community structuring at
   local scales in naturally heterogeneous environments. We systematically
   sampled stingless bee communities found across three paired sites that
   included adjacent patches of white-sand and non-white-sand forest in the
   lowland Amazonian region of Loreto, Peru. We sought to understand: (1)
   How stingless bee species richness and abundance differ among white-sand
   and non-white-sand habitats and (2) The relative influence of fine scale
   geographic distance and habitat type in structuring stingless bee
   communities. We found that species richness did not differ between
   habitats and that species abundances were highest in white-sand
   habitats. Community analyses for sampling sites pooled across all months
   demonstrated that location and soil type played a significant role in
   structuring bee communities and that community turnover may be more
   strongly influenced by distance in white-sand habitats than non-white
   sand habitats. Our results suggest that distance and habitat play an
   important role in driving stingless bee community turnover at fine
   scales and that the interaction between habitat and geographic distance
   may promote higher stingless bee community turnover in white-sand
   habitats than non-white sand habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of protected cultivation in world agriculture has driven
   crops traditionally cultivated in open field to greenhouse, which, in
   turn, prevent the access of pollinators to flowers. Therefore, it is
   necessary to identify suitable pollinators for closed environments.
   Stingless bees have been identified in Brazil as the ideal pollinators
   for crop pollination under greenhouse conditions. Colonies of two
   stingless bee species (Melipona subnitida Ducke) and Scaptotrigona sp.
   nov. were evaluated in a greenhouse during the flowering of seeded
   (diploid) and seedless (triploid) mini watermelon (Citrullus lanatus T.)
   varieties. The feasibility of using these bees in this production system
   was based on their adaptation and foraging behavior. M. subnitida did
   not show any interest to the crop under the experimental conditions; and
   this species stopped foraging trips and egg laying in a diapause-like
   stage. In comparison, Scaptotrigona sp. nov. foragers were active and
   collected floral resources soon after their introduction. Moreover, the
   foragers of Scaptotrigona sp. nov. showed an essential behavior for mini
   watermelon pollination, because they visited staminate and pistillate
   flowers from both seeded and seedless genotypes for nectar collection.
   Thus, we concluded that M. subnitida did not adapt to greenhouse mini
   watermelon cultivation under the experimental conditions and should not
   to be used for pollination purposes in this environment; however,
   Scaptotrigona sp. nov. adapted well as a pollinator in the greenhouse
   and can be used for mini watermelon pollination in protected culture.}},

Abstract = {{The distance a bee can fly to collect food is quite relevant, among
   other aspects, for successful pollination. However, studies on this
   aspect concerning stingless bees usually do not take into consideration
   their homing ability. The objectives of this study were to verify the
   maximum distance that foragers of Melipona mandacaia Smith can fly, and
   whether experience is relevant for their homing ability in a Caatinga
   region of Northeast Brazil. Five colonies were used to collect foragers.
   These were marked and released starting from 100 m from their nests and
   at every 100 m up to a maximum distance on which there would be no bee
   returning to the nest. To evaluate the influence of experience, after
   being marked, another group of bees was put back into colonies,
   collected again after eight days and released in five distances only
   (500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 and 2,500 m). In both experiments, as the
   distance increased, the returning success of the bees decreased
   significantly. In fact, there was a significant negative correlation
   between their returning success and the distances they were released.
   The maximum distance a translocate bee returned to its hive was 2,700 m.
   The percentage of success was very high for bees released at 500 and
   1,000 m (100\% and 77\%, respectively), suggesting this is the common
   flight range for the species. In most cases, average percentage of
   success was significantly higher for experienced bees than for other
   bees reinforcing the idea that experience is quite relevant for homing

   species-related: 3.70 mg (C. montana), 4.02 mg (C. mollis), and 6.01 mg
   (C. dealbata) per 100 anthers. The total pollen yield was related to the
   mass of pollen produced in flowers and the abundance of blooming. Pollen
   grains were medium-sized, spheroid (C. dealbata) or prolato-spheroid (C.
   mollis and C. montana) in shape, and characterized by high viability

Abstract = {{The Japanese hornfaced bee, Osmia cornifrons Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera:
   Megachilidae), is an important pollinator of apple. It overwinters as
   diapausing adult in cocoon and the synchronization of the adult
   emergence in spring with apple blossom is critical for successful
   pollination, specifically in the environment with variable climate. To
   this end, prediction model of adult emergence would help manage O.
   cornifrons populations for planed pollination. In this study, by using
   temperature-dependent emergence data of O. cornifrons, emergence rate
   were mathematically described using linear and Lactin's nonlinear
   regression methods. The lower emergence thresholds estimated from linear
   regression for female was 7.98 degrees C and the thermal constant (DD,
   degree days) was 112.43DD. Pattern of emergence completion was described
   by using Weibull function and prediction of spring emergence was modeled
   based on functions of emergence rate and distribution. The model
   predicted the emergence of O. cornifrons between 100-130 Julian date and
   the observation fell between 108-129 Julian date. The prediction ranges
   of O. cornifrons emergence were wider than that of observation. This
   model could help predict spring emergence of O. cornifrons in the field

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, populations of honey bees and other pollinators have
   been reported to be in decline worldwide. A number of stressors have
   been identified as potential contributing factors, including the
   extensive prophylactic use of neonicotinoid insecticides, which are
   highly toxic to bees, in agriculture. While multiple routes of exposure
   to these systemic insecticides have been documented for honey bees,
   contamination from puddle water has not been investigated. In this
   study, we used a multi-residue method based on LC-MS/MS to analyze
   samples of puddle water taken in the field during the planting of
   treated corn and one month later. If honey bees were to collect and
   drink water from these puddles, our results showed that they would be
   exposed to various agricultural pesticides. All water samples collected
   from corn fields were contaminated with at least one neonicotinoid
   compound, although most contained more than one systemic insecticide.
   Concentrations of neonicotinoids were higher in early spring, indicating
   that emission and drifting of contaminated dust during sowing raises
   contamination levels of puddles. Although the overall average acute risk
   of drinking water from puddles was relatively low, concentrations of
   neonicotinoids ranged from 0.01 to 63 mg/L and were sufficient to
   potentially elicit a wide array of sublethal effects in individuals and
   colony alike. Our results also suggest that risk assessment of honey bee
   water resources underestimates the foragers' exposure and consequently
   miscalculates the risk. In fact, our data shows that honey bees and
   native pollinators are facing unprecedented cumulative exposure to these
   insecticides from combined residues in pollen, nectar and water. These
   findings not only document the impact of this route of exposure for
   honey bees, they also have implications for the cultivation of a wide
   variety of crops for which the extensive use of neonicotinoids is
   currently promoted.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Over the past 75 Myr, successive groups of plants
   have entered the ``oil bee pollination niche,{''} meaning that they
   depend on oil-collecting bees for their pollination. The highly
   dissimilar numbers of plant species and bee species involved in these
   mutualisms imply evolutionary host switching, asymmetric mutual
   dependencies, and uncoupled diversification. Among the clades with the
   best field data on oil bee behavior is the Angelonieae, which we here
   investigate to better understand the evolutionary time frame of this
   pollination syndrome.
   Methods: We generated nuclear and plastid data matrices for 56\% of the
   Angelonieae species (plus outgroups) and used Bayesian methods of
   molecular clock dating, ancestral state reconstruction, and
   biogeographic inference.
   Key results: We found that Angelonieae have two major clades, Angelonia
   (including Monopera) and Basistemon, and Monttea, Melosperma, and
   Ourisia.
   Conclusions: Angelonieae date back to the Uppermost Eocene, ca. 35
   (26-47) Myr ago (Ma) and diversified in dry areas of southern South
   America; they switched from nectar to oil as a reward four or five times
   over the past 25 Ma. As predicted in a previous non-clock-dated study,
   dispersal to Australasia dates to the Miocene/Pliocene.}},

Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Floral adaptation to a functional pollinator group
   does not necessarily mean close specialization to a few pollinator
   species. For the more than 950 species of Salvia, only bee and bird
   pollinations are known. Restriction to these pollinators is mainly due
   to the specific flower construction (lever mechanism). Nevertheless, it
   has been repeatedly suggested that Salvia flowers might also be
   pollinated by flies. Are flies able to handle the lever mechanism? Are
   they functionally equivalent pollinators? In this study, we compared and
   quantified pollen transfer by bees and flies to test whether flies are
   true pollinators in Salvia.
   Methods: We identified pollinators using field observations and photos.
   Video documentation of the visitation rate and the site of pollen
   placement on the pollinator body, morphometric measurements,
   quantification of pollen placement, pollen load, handling time, and
   stigma contact ratio were analyzed.
   Key results: Field investigations revealed that 19 insect species
   pollinated S. virgata and four pollinated S. verticillata, including 16
   bee species from seven genera of the Apidae and three fly species from
   three genera of the Nemestrinidae and Tabanidae.
   Conclusions: Flies have been found to be pollinators in primarily
   bee-pollinated Salvia species. This result demonstrates the potential of
   a given ``melittoid{''} flower construction to broaden the range of
   pollinators to guarantee successful pollination and seed production.
   Though bees, particularly Bombus terrestris, were more efficient than
   flies, the study shows that flies significantly contribute to pollen
   transfer in Salvia.}},

Title = {{Buzz pollination in eight bumblebee-pollinated Pedicularis species: does

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{114}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Buzz pollination involves explosive pollen release
   in response to vibration, usually by bees. The mechanism of pollen
   release is poorly understood, and it is not clear which component of
   vibration (acceleration, frequency, displacement or velocity) is
   critical; the role of buzz frequency has been particularly
   controversial. This study proposes a novel hypothesis that explosive
   pollen release results from vibration-induced triboelectric charging. If
   it does, pollen release is expected to depend on achievement of a
   critical threshold velocity.
   Methods Eight sympatric buzz-pollinated species of Pedicularis that
   share bumblebee pollinator species were studied, giving a rare
   opportunity to compare sonication behaviour of a shared pollinator on
   different plant species.
   Key Results Reconsidering previous experimental studies, it is argued
   that they establish the critical role of the velocity component of
   vibration in pollen release, and that when displacement is constrained
   by body size bees can achieve the critical velocity by adjusting
   frequency. It was shown that workers of Bombus friseanus assorted
   themselves among Pedicularis species by body size, and that bees
   adjusted their buzz/wingbeat frequency ratio, which is taken as an index
   of the velocity component, to a value that corresponds with the galea
   length and pollen grain volume of each species of Pedicularis.
   Conclusions Sonication behaviour of B. friseanus differs among
   Pedicularis species, not only because worker bees assort themselves
   among plant species by body size, but also because bees of a given size
   adjust the buzz frequency to achieve a vibration velocity corresponding
   to the floral traits of each plant species. These findings, and the
   floral traits that characterize these and other buzz-pollinated species,
   are compatible with the hypothesis of vibration-induced triboelectric
   charging of pollen grains.}},

Title = {{Potential Disruption of Pollination in a Sexually Deceptive Orchid by

Abstract = {{Warmer springs advance many phenological events, including flowering
   time in plants and the flight time of insects {[}1]. Pollination by
   insects, an ecosystem service of immense economic and conservation
   importance {[}2], depends on synchrony between insect activity and
   flowering time. If plants and their pollinators show different
   phenological responses to climate warming, pollination could fail.
   Information about the effects of warming on specific plant-insect
   mutualisms is difficult to obtain from complex pollination networks
   {[}3]. In contrast, the extraordinarily specific deceptions evolved by
   orchids {[}4] that attract a very narrow range of pollinators allow
   direct examination of the potential for climatic warming to disrupt
   synchrony. Here we show that a sexually deceptive orchid and the
   solitary bee on which it depends for pollination will diverge in
   phenology with increasing spring temperature. Male bees inadvertently
   pollinate the orchid flowers during pseudocopulation. Analysis of museum
   specimens (1893-2007) and recent field-based records (1975-2009) showed
   that flight date of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea is advanced more
   by higher temperatures than is flowering date in the deceptive orchid
   Ophrys sphegodes. Male bees emerged slightly earlier than females, which
   attract male copulatory attentions away from the deceptive flowers.
   Warming by as little as 2 degrees C increased both the probability of
   male flight and the proportion of females flying in the bee population
   before orchid flowering; this would reduce the frequency of
   pseudocopulation and thus lower pollination success rate in the orchid.
   Our results demonstrate a significant potential for coevolved
   plant-pollinator relationships to be disrupted by climatic warming.}},

Abstract = {{Honeydew is abundant in many ecosystems and may provide an alternative
   food source (a buffer) for pollinators during periods of food shortage,
   but the impact of honeydew on pollination systems has received little
   attention to date. In New Zealand, kanuka trees (Myrtaceae: Kunzea
   ericoides (A. Rich) Joy Thompson) are often heavily infested by the
   endemic honeydew- producing scale insect Coelostomidia wairoensis
   (Maskell) (Hemiptera: Coelostomidiidae) and the period of high honeydew
   production can overlap with kanuka flowering. In this study, we
   quantified the sugar resources (honeydew and nectar) available on kanuka
   and recorded nocturnal insect activity on infested and uninfested kanuka
   during the flowering period. Insects were abundant on infested trees,
   but flowers on infested trees received fewer insect visitors than
   flowers on uninfested trees. There was little evidence that insects had
   switched directly from nectar-feeding to honeydew- feeding, but it is
   possible that some omnivores (e.g., cockroaches) were distracted by the
   other honeydew- associated resources on infested branches (e.g., sooty
   molds, prey). Additional sampling was carried out after kanuka flowering
   had finished to determine honeydew usage in the absence of adjacent
   nectar resources. Moths, which had fed almost exclusively on nectar
   earlier, were recorded feeding extensively on honeydew after flowering
   had ceased; hence, honeydew may provide an additional food source for
   potential pollinators. Our results show that honeydew resources can
   impact floral visitation patterns and suggest that future pollinator
   studies should consider the full range of sugar resources present in the
   study environment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bowl traps to sample bee diversity has become common in
   recent years. To provide guidance in optimizing bee bowl sampling
   effort, we used several independent datasets from North America (Pacific
   Northwest golf courses, suburban Maryland, and Chihuahuan Desert) to
   estimate the number of bowls in a sampling event at which additional
   bowls added little to estimates of species richness or to cumulative
   species lists. We examined changes in the value of a nonparametric
   richness estimator (Chao2) as a function of bowl number by randomly
   resampling (without replacement) the data for each sampled transect. We
   also carried out rarefaction (interpolation of expected species richness
   for all numbers of bowls up to the actual number). Using as our
   criterion of ``optimal{''} number of bowl samples per transect the
   number of samples at which five additional bowls added < 1 additional
   species to the Chao2 estimate, we find that 30-bowl transects would have
   met this standard for nearly three quarters or more of the sampling
   events in any of our three datasets (for the suburban Maryland and
   Chihuahuan Desert data sets, at least three quarters of sampling events
   met this criterion with just 20 and 25 bowls, respectively). Results
   from rarefaction analysis for all sampling events indicate that 30-bowl
   transects would have met our ``five additional bowls{''} standard for
   more than 80 \% of our suburban Maryland and Chihuahuan Desert sampling
   events, but for only about 61 \% of our Pacific Northwest sampling
   events. For the Pacific Northwest sampling events, there was notable
   among-site heterogeneity in required sampling intensity. Thus, although
   30-bowl transects appear to be adequate for assessing local bee species
   richness in most instances, investigators may wish to increase (or
   decrease) this number based on their particular goals and specific
   knowledge about local bee diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The available studies on Hymenoptera assemblages in fragmented
   landscapes have shown that these insects are sensitive to fragmentation,
   besides some different conclusions which are possibly linked to
   different landscape attributes and sampling designs. The present
   objective is to determine the correlation among the descriptors of bees
   and wasps assemblages with fragment predictors (size, connectivity and
   edge effect) within a fragmented landscape of Semidecidual Seasonal
   Forest (Parana State, Brazil). For this purpose five forest fragments,
   from three to 484 hectares, were sampled during a year, summing up 480
   samples of baited traps and 3,480 of bowl traps. We have found that
   abundance of Apinae and oligolectic bees increase and the richness of
   Augochlorini bees decreases with increasing fragment size. Connectivity
   has positively influenced bee richness and edge effect has positively
   influenced the abundance of oligoletic bees. Orchid bees also respond to
   the site predictors, especially for the Eufriesea violacea, which
   abundance was positively correlated with fragment size and connectivity,
   however negatively with edge effect, and Eufriesea nigrita which
   abundance was negatively correlated with fragment size, but positively
   with edge effect. Composition of bees, Crabronidae and Pompilidae wasps
   were influenced by fragment size. Plebeia droryana and Tetrapedia
   diversipes could be considered as indicators, according to their
   sensitiveness to habitat predictors. Our results are congruent with
   previous studies which found that bees are sensitive to landscape
   fragmentation, we suggest that the group be used in ecological indicator
   and monitoring studies.}},

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{The phylogeny of Petunia species has been difficult to resolve,
   primarily due to the recent diversification of the genus. Several
   studies have included molecular data in phylogenetic reconstructions of
   this genus, but all of them have failed to include all taxa and/or
   analyzed few genetic markers. In the present study, we employed the most
   inclusive genetic and taxonomic datasets for the genus, aiming to
   reconstruct the evolutionary history of Petunia based on molecular
   phylogeny, biogeographic distribution, and character evolution. We
   included all 20 Petunia morphological species or subspecies in these
   analyses. Based on nine nuclear and five plastid DNA markers, our
   phylogenetic analysis reinforces the monophyly of the genus Petunia and
   supports the hypothesis that the basal divergence is more related to the
   differentiation of corolla tube length, whereas the geographic
   distribution of species is more related to divergences within these main
   clades. Ancestral area reconstructions suggest the Pampas region as the
   area of origin and earliest divergence in Petunia. The state
   reconstructions suggest that the ancestor of Petunia might have had a
   short corolla tube and a bee pollination floral syndrome. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We report observations of generalist insect visitation and probable

   tonduzii, both of which belong to Miconia section Cremanium. The most
   diverse assemblage of insect visitors was recorded for M. brevitheca,
   which has some of the smallest flowers in the Melastomataceae. Visitors
   included butterflies of at least five families. Miconia tonduzii, on the
   other hand, was visited mostly by Diptera of the families Syrphidae and
   Tachinidae. Scanning electron microscopy revealed stomata on the lower
   part of the anthers on the abaxial surface, which has been recently
   reported in other melastomes as the nectar-secreting site. Flowers of a
   closely related buzz pollinated control, Leandra subseriata, confirmed
   the absence of stomata in the flowers of this species. Flowers of these
   Miconia also are unusual in that they have broad pores, filaments that
   are geniculate at the middle of their length, and short styles that are
   not exserted beyond the stamens (not herkogamous). The floral
   morphology, along with observations of many generalist insect visitors
   and almost no buzzing bees, suggest these species are generalist
   pollinated. The implications of these observations are relevant to the
   understanding of pollinator systems, because the lineage to which these

   clade, adding support to previous suggestions of a shift from pollinator

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification typically has detrimental effects on

   sequentially-flowering crops have the potential to benefit pollinators
   through the provision of additional floral resources. In this study we
   investigate the importance of cultivated flora for flower visitors in
   ten agricultural gardens in South Sinai, Egypt. Insect-flower
   interactions in gardens and unmanaged plots were surveyed across a
   four-month period in two environmentally distinct years (pre-flood and
   post-flood). Despite containing an equal abundance and diversity of wild
   plants as unmanaged habitat, gardens supported a higher abundance and
   diversity of flower visitors due to the additional presence of
   cultivated flora. Visitation networks exhibited dramatic intra-annual
   changes in composition, with cultivated plants becoming increasingly
   important in later months. Trends were highly conserved across 2 years
   despite highly contrasting rainfall. Several key crop species were
   strongly involved in shaping the structure of the networks, the majority
   of which were herbs with strong cultural significance (fennel, rosemary,
   mint) and grown incidentally alongside the primary orchard crops.
   Minority crops are frequently overlooked in agricultural systems due to
   their low economic value, but we show that they can have a dramatic
   influence upon the structure of visitation networks, increasing both
   pollinator abundance and diversity, and emphasising the link between
   cultural practices and biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiverse environments provide a variety of resources that can be
   exploited by consumers. While many studies revealed a positive
   correlation between biodiversity and consumer biomass and richness, only
   few studies have investigated how resource diversity affects single
   consumers. To better understand whether a single consumer species
   benefits from diverse resources, we tested how the protective function
   of a defensive plant resource (i.e. resin exploited by social bees)
   varied among different sources and target organisms (predators,
   parasites and pathogens). To assess synergistic effects, resins from
   different plant genera were tested separately and in combination. We
   found that resin diversity is beneficial for bees, with its functional
   properties depending on the target organisms, type and composition of
   resin. Different resins showed different effects, and mixtures were more
   effective than some of the single resins (functional complementarity).
   We conclude that resins of different plant species target different
   organisms and act synergistically where combined. Bees that rely on
   resin for protection benefit more when they have access to diverse resin
   sources. Loss of biodiversity may in turn destabilize consumer
   populations due to restricted access to a variety of resources.}},

Abstract = {{We use an extensive historical data set on bumble bee host choice
   collected almost 50 years ago by L. W. Macior (Melanderia 15:1-59, 1974)
   to examine how resource partitioning by bumble bees varies over a
   2,700-m altitudinal gradient at four hierarchical scales: individual,
   colony, species and community. Bumble bee behavior, resource overlap
   between castes, and plant-bumble bee networks change with altitude in
   accordance with tightening temporal constraints on flowering and colony
   growth in alpine habitats. Individual bees were more likely to collect
   pollen from multiple sources at high altitude. Between-caste foraging
   niche overlap increased with altitude. Similarly, alpine forager
   networks were more highly nested than either subalpine or montane
   networks due to increased asymmetric specialization. However,
   interspecific resource partitioning showed a more complex spatial
   pattern with low niche overlap at intermediate altitude (subalpine)
   compared to montane (disturbed) and alpine (unproductive) sites. Results
   suggest that spatial variation in interspecific resource partitioning is
   driven by a shift in the behavior of long-tongued bumble bees.
   Long-tongued bumble bees specialized in the subalpine but generalized in
   montane and alpine zones. Our reanalysis of Macior's data shows that
   bumble bee behavior varies substantially with altitude influencing
   plant-bumble bee interaction networks. Results imply that pollination
   services to alpine host plants will change dramatically as subalpine

Abstract = {{Making quantitative predictions of the effects of human activities on
   ecological communities is crucial for their management. In the case of
   plant-pollinator mutualistic networks, despite the great progress in
   describing the interactions between plants and their pollinators, the
   capability of making quantitative predictions is still lacking. Here, in
   order to estimate pollinator species abundances and their niche
   distribution, I propose a general method to transform a plant-pollinator
   network into a competition model between pollinator species. Competition
   matrices were obtained from first principles' calculations, using
   qualitative interaction matrices compiled for a set of 38
   plant-pollinator networks. This method is able to make accurate
   quantitative predictions for mutualistic networks spanning a broad
   geographic range. Specifically, the predicted biodiversity metrics for
   pollinators - species relative abundances, Shannon equitability and
   Gini-Simpson indices - agree quite well with those inferred from
   empirical counts of visits of pollinators to plants. Furthermore, this
   method allows building a one-dimensional niche axis for pollinators in
   which clusters of generalists are separated by specialists thus
   rendering support to the theory of emergent neutrality. The importance
   of interspecific competition between pollinator species is a
   controversial and unresolved issue, considerable circumstantial evidence
   has accrued that competition between insects does occur, but a clear
   measure of its impact on their species abundances is still lacking. I
   contributed to fill this gap by quantifying the effect of competition
   between pollinators. Particular applications of our analysis could be to
   estimate the quantitative effects of removing a species from a community
   or to address the fate of populations of native organisms when foreign
   species are introduced to ecosystems far beyond their home range.}},

Abstract = {{In South Africa, the wild leafless Vanilla roscheri Rchb. f.
   (Orchidaceae) is distributed only on the banks of the Lake Sibaya in
   KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Forest in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park. It is the
   southernmost vanilloid orchid on the African continent and a species of
   high conservation priority with little understanding of its reproductive
   biology and levels of genetic diversity. Mating systems and pollination
   ecology of the species were assessed by in situ experiments, in addition
   to genotyping plants at 16 microsatellite markers. Allogamous but
   self-compatible, V. roscheri depends on pollinators to achieve sexual
   reproduction. Its natural fruit set (26.3 \%) is the highest reported
   for a non-spontaneously self-pollinating Vanilla species. It was
   associated with numerous flower visitors including two female allodapine
   bees (Allodapula variegata and Allodape rufogastra, Xylocopinae),
   captured with pollinia stored on the hind legs, and one female
   anthophorine bee. On the other hand, we report an absence of genetic
   diversity and homozygosity of the South-African populations of V.
   roscheri for all the genetic markers. Given the preferential
   outbreeding, the high natural fruit set and the pollinator/visitor
   richness of V. roscheri in Sibaya, a high level of genetic diversity was
   expected, but this was not the case. We detected a counterintuitive
   situation between the results of reproductive biology and genetics,
   making sense once the population situation on the margins of the species
   distribution is included. The null diversity expressed through the
   homozygous monomorphic markers is a consequence of the range-edge
   localization of the populations, which may have been subjected to severe
   bottlenecks (due to long distance colonization or fragmentation) along
   with inbreeding, in the past. The analysis highlights the
   complementarity of the approaches for which the implications in terms of
   conservation of the species in South Africa are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Native wildflower plantings can be used to provide nutritional resources
   to support pollinating insects, yet the effects of planting size and
   bloom richness on the density, diversity, and function of these insects
   are not well understood. We established stands of twelve native
   flowering perennial plant species in replicated plots ranging in size
   from 1 to 100 m(2). These plots were sampled for insect pollinators,
   bloom richness, and seed production by three wild flower species.
   Honeybees, wild bees, and hoverflies all responded positively to
   increasing flower richness, whereas particular insect pollinator groups
   responded differently to the size of the flowering plant area. The
   density of honeybees and hoverflies was not affected by increasing
   flowering patch size, whereas in general, wild bees were observed at
   higher density and diversity in the 30 and 100 m(2) patches. Increasing
   wildflower patch size, and thus wild bee density, resulted in greater
   seed set in the sampled wild flowers. These results indicate that wild
   bees are sensitive to the area and richness of floral resources in
   patches, even at relatively small scales. Therefore, larger wildflower
   plantings with more diverse flower species mixes are more suitable for
   the conservation of wild pollinators and reproduction of sown species.

Abstract = {{Population genetic analyses are especially relevant for species
   considered threatened or highly endemic and for which other forms of
   biological information are lacking. Patellapis doleritica is a recently
   described communally nesting halictid bee of conservation concern
   because it is rare and endemic to the Succulent Karoo of South Africa.
   Moreover, its dispersal is considered to be restricted by its
   specialised nesting requirements and inclement weather conditions during
   its limited annual flight period, traits which may be common to other
   bee species of the region. We hypothesised that gene flow in P.
   doleritica was low, leading to marked genetic differentiation. Using 7
   microsatellites, we investigated its mating and population genetic
   structure in 258 individuals (171 females and 87 males) from 7
   populations spanning most of its known range. Deviation from
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (F-IS = + 0.254) suggested P. doleritica to
   be inbred, as in many other communal nesting bee species. Global F-ST
   (0.028) and global G'(ST) (0.216) revealed modest but significant
   differentiation between most populations, even across the very limited
   range of the species (ca. 25 km), with one genetically extreme outlier
   population. Despite inbreeding, we detected a surprisingly low frequency
   of diploid males (2 \%). Patellapis doleritica nevertheless deserves
   special conservation attention since it is an endemic species with a low
   overall abundance and therefore possibly prone to environmental change
   and local extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Different resource use strategies manifest as differences in the
   realized niches of species. Niche segregation may involve several
   dimensions of the niche, such as diet, space, and time. We measured the
   level of redundancy and complementarity of a bee-plant interaction
   network in an agricultural system. Because flower resource diversity is
   high and resource abundance associated with flowering phenology varies
   throughout the year, we hypothesized that trophic overlap in the
   community would be low (i.e., high niche complementarity). In contrast,
   we expected a combination of physiological constraints and exploitation
   competition to create high temporal overlap, leading to high redundancy
   in the time of use of floral resources. Dietary overlap was low (NOih =
   0.18): niches of 88\% of species pairs had less than 30\% overlap. In
   contrast, temporal overlap was intermediate (NOih = 0.49): niches of
   65\% of species pairs had 30\% to 60\% overlap. Network analysis showed
   that bees separated their dietary niches and had intermediate
   complementary specialization (H-2'aEuro parts per thousand= 0.46). In
   terms of their temporal niches (H-2'aEuro parts per thousand= 0.12),
   bees were generalists, with high temporal redundancy. Temperature was
   not a key factor in the determination of niche overlap, suggesting that
   environmental factors do not likely have a primary role in determining
   high redundancy in the temporal use of floral resources. Rather,
   temporal overlap is likely associated with the timing of nectar
   production by flowers. Our results suggest that bees partition a wide
   variety of available floral resources, resulting in low dietary overlap
   and intermediate temporal overlap.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation is a major factor in driving
   the diversification of flowering plants. Studies of floral traits
   involved in reproductive isolation have focused nearly exclusively on
   visual signals, such as flower color. The role of less obvious signals,
   such as floral scent, has been studied only recently. In particular, the
   genetics of floral volatiles involved in mediating differential
   pollinator visitation remains unknown. The bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus
   lewisii and hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis are a model system
   for studying reproductive isolation via pollinator preference. We have
   shown that these two species differ in three floral terpenoid volatiles
   - d-limonene, -myrcene, and E--ocimene - that are attractive to
   bumblebee pollinators. By genetic mapping and in vitro analysis of
   enzyme activity we demonstrate that these interspecific differences are
   consistent with allelic variation at two loci, LIMONENE-MYRCENE SYNTHASE
   (LMS) and OCIMENE SYNTHASE (OS). Mimulus lewisii LMS (MlLMS) and OS
   (MlOS) are expressed most strongly in floral tissue in the last stages
   of floral development. Mimulus cardinalis LMS (McLMS) is weakly
   expressed and has a nonsense mutation in exon 3. Mimulus cardinalis OS
   (McOS) is expressed similarly to MlOS, but the encoded McOS enzyme
   produces no E--ocimene. Recapitulating the M.cardinalis phenotype by
   reducing the expression of MlLMS by RNA interference in transgenic
   M.lewisii produces no behavioral difference in pollinating bumblebees;
   however, reducing MlOS expression produces a 6\% decrease in visitation.
   Allelic variation at the OCIMENE SYNTHASE locus is likely to contribute
   to differential pollinator visitation, and thus promote reproductive
   isolation between M.lewisii and M.cardinalis. OCIMENE SYNTHASE joins a
   growing list of speciation genes' (barrier genes') in flowering plants.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers bear the function of filters supporting the attraction of
   pollinators as well as the deterrence of floral antagonists. The effect
   of epidermal cell shape on the visual display and tactile properties of
   flowers has been evaluated only recently. In this study we
   quantitatively measured epidermal cell shape, gloss and spectral
   reflectance of flowers pollinated by either bees or birds testing three
   hypotheses: The first two hypotheses imply that bee-pollinated flowers
   might benefit from rough surfaces on visually-active parts produced by
   conical epidermal cells, as they may enhance the colour signal of
   flowers as well as the grip on flowers for bees. In contrast,
   bird-pollinated flowers might benefit from flat surfaces produced by
   flat epidermal cells, by avoiding frequent visitation from
   non-pollinating bees due to a reduced colour signal, as birds do not
   rely on specific colour parameters while foraging. Moreover, flat petal
   surfaces in bird-pollinated flowers may hamper grip for bees that do not
   touch anthers and stigmas while consuming nectar and thus, are
   considered as nectar thieves. Beside this, the third hypothesis implies
   that those flower parts which are vulnerable to nectar robbing of bee-as
   well as bird-pollinated flowers benefit from flat epidermal cells,
   hampering grip for nectar robbing bees. Our comparative data show in
   fact that conical epidermal cells are restricted to visually-active
   parts of bee-pollinated flowers, whereas robbing-sensitive parts of
   bee-pollinated as well as the entire floral surface of bird-pollinated
   flowers possess on average flat epidermal cells. However, direct
   correlations between epidermal cell shape and colour parameters have not
   been found. Our results together with published experimental studies
   show that epidermal cell shape as a largely neglected flower trait might
   act as an important feature in pollinator attraction and avoidance of
   antagonists, and thus may contribute to the partitioning of
   flower-visitors.}},

Abstract = {{In the United States, policy initiatives aimed at increasing sources of
   renewable energy are advancing bioenergy production, especially in the
   Midwest region, where agricultural landscapes dominate. While policy
   directives are focused on renewable fuel production, biodiversity and
   ecosystem services will be impacted by the land-use changes required to
   meet production targets. Using data from field observations, we
   developed empirical models for predicting abundance, diversity, and
   community composition of flower-visiting bees based on land cover. We
   used these models to explore how bees might respond under two
   contrasting bioenergy scenarios: annual bioenergy crop production and
   perennial grassland bioenergy production. In the two scenarios, 600,000
   ha of marginal annual crop land or marginal grassland were converted to
   perennial grassland or annual row crop bioenergy production,
   respectively. Model projections indicate that expansion of annual
   bioenergy crop production at this scale will reduce bee abundance by 0
   to 71\%, and bee diversity by 0 to 28\%, depending on location. In
   contrast, converting annual crops on marginal soil to perennial
   grasslands could increase bee abundance from 0 to 600\% and increase bee
   diversity between 0 and 53\%. Our analysis of bee community composition
   suggested a similar pattern, with bee communities becoming less diverse
   under annual bioenergy crop production, whereas bee composition
   transitioned towards a more diverse community dominated by wild bees
   under perennial bioenergy crop production. Models, like those employed
   here, suggest that bioenergy policies have important consequences for
   pollinator conservation.}},

Title = {{Partitioning interaction turnover among alpine pollination networks:
   spatial, temporal, and environmental patterns}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ecologists have taken two distinct approaches in studying the
   distribution and diversity of communities: a species-centric focus and
   an interaction-network based approach. A current frontier in
   community-level studies is the integration of these perspectives by
   investigating both simultaneously; one method for achieving this is
   evaluating the relative contributions of species turnover and host
   switching towards interaction turnover (i.e., the dissimilarity in
   interactions between two networks). We performed observations of
   plant-pollinator interactions to investigate (1) patterns in interaction
   turnover across spatial, temporal, and environmental gradients and (2)
   the relative contribution of pollinator species turnover, floral
   turnover, simultaneous pollinator \& floral turnover, and host switching
   towards interaction turnover. Field work was conducted on the Beartooth
   Plateau, an alpine ecosystem in Montana and Wyoming, with weekly
   observations of plant-pollinator interactions across one growing season.
   Interaction turnover increased through time, with magnitudes
   consistently greater than 80\%, even at time intervals as short as one
   week. Floral species turnover (41\%) and simultaneous floral and
   pollinator species turnover (36\%) accounted for almost all interaction
   turnover while host switching accounted for only 5\%. Interaction
   turnover also significantly increased with spatial and elevational
   distance, albeit with lesser magnitudes than with temporal distance. The
   marginal spatial pattern was present for only some taxa (Bombus spp. and
   solitary bee species), potentially indicating variable habitat use by
   pollinators across the landscape. Weak environmental trends may be a
   consequence of unmeasured environmental variables, yet our finding that
   environmental gradients structure plant-pollinator interaction
   partitions had not previously been tested with empirical data. Our
   observations suggest that host switching does not readily occur at the
   scales of alpine flowering phenology (i.e., similar to 1 week); however,
   whether lack of host switching is indicative of inflexible pollinator
   foraging, or, more likely, a lack of opportunity or necessity to switch
   hosts, requires further investigation.}},

   of the bumblebee wings on the wingbeat is investigated. It is shown that
   the wingbeat frequencies of the two species are significantly different,

Abstract = {{Pollinators play a key role in biodiversity conservation, since they
   provide vital services to both natural ecosystems and agriculture. In
   particular, bees are excellent pollinators; therefore, their mapping,
   classification, and preservation help to promote biodiversity
   conservation. However, these tasks are difficult and time consuming
   since there is a lack of classification keys, sampling efforts and
   trained taxonomists. The development of tools for automating and
   assisting the identification of bee species represents an important
   contribution to biodiversity conservation. Several studies have shown
   that features extracted from patterns of bee wings are good
   discriminatory elements to differentiate among species, and some have
   devoted efforts to automate this process. However, the automated
   identification of bee species is a particularly hard problem, because
   (i) individuals of a given species may vary hugely in morphology, and
   (ii) closely related species may be extremely similar to one another.
   This paper proposes a reference process for bee classification based on
   wing images to provide a complete understanding of the problem from the
   experts' point of view, and a foundation to software systems development
   and integration using Internet services. The results can be extended to
   other species identification and taxonomic classification, as long as
   similar criteria are applicable. The reference process may also be
   helpful for beginners in this research field, as they can use the
   process and the experiments presented here as a guide to this complex
   activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebee Bombus ignitus, which is indigenous to Korea, Japan, and
   China, has been recognized as a valuable pollinator for both crops and
   wild plants. Bombus ignitus has now become commercially important as a
   pollinator because of its use in the agricultural industry, particularly
   for greenhouse pollination. For long-term management and effective
   conservation of B.ignitus, an understanding of the genetic structure of
   its naturally occurring populations is practically important. In this
   study, the genetic structure among the five populations of B.ignitus in
   South Korea was assessed using nine microsatellite loci. These markers
   showed high levels of genetic variability, with the number of alleles
   ranging from 6 to 22 (mean = 13.4) and the frequency of the most common
   allele ranging from 0.11 to 0.66. Only the Sabuk (SB) population showed
   a genetic signature of a recent bottleneck, which was further supported
   by the lowest level of allelic richness (AR) (mean AR = 3.944). Genetic
   differentiation was highly significant among all pairs of populations (P
   < 0.001) across the nine microsatellite markers, suggesting a lack of
   gene flow among those populations. Interestingly, F-ST (and R-ST and
   D-est) values were always greater for the Taebaek population than for
   the four remaining populations. The phylogenetic analysis showed
   evidence supporting our hypothesis that the Taebaek population is
   genetically more divergent than the other populations. Overall, our
   results suggest that the Korean populations of B.ignitus might have
   undergone geographic isolation and have become highly separated
   spatially from one another, thereby having a limited range of migration
   among their local habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem degradation leads to loss of interactions between animals and

   Brazil, and to understand the organization of those plant communities.
   We analyzed the reproductive biology of 243 tree species found in 10

   and relative density of the species were used to estimate the importance
   of each reproductive feature. The study was based on a compilation of
   data present in specialized works and community surveys conducted in the
   region. We aggregated the species of these communities in ecological
   groups according to their reproductive characteristics. The frequency of
   species in each reproductive ecological group was, to a certain extent,
   similar between remnants. The pollination by small insects (small bees,
   wasps and flies) represented 42\%, dispersal by birds 35\%, and
   hermaphrodite sexual system 54\% of the species. Clearer differences
   among fragments were found on the relative densities of each

Abstract = {{Native bee abundance has long been assumed to be limited by floral
   resources. This paradigm has been established in large measure because
   more bees are often found in areas supporting greater floral abundance.
   This could result from attraction to resource-rich sites as well as
   greater local demographic performance in sites supporting high floral
   abundance; however, demographic performance is usually unknown. Factors
   other than floral resources such as availability of nest sites, pressure
   from natural enemies, or whether floral resources are from a mixed
   native or mostly monodominant exotic assemblage might influence survival
   or fecundity and hence abundance. We examined how the survival and
   fecundity of the native solitary bee Osmia lignaria varied along a
   gradient in floral resource abundance. We released bees alongside a nest
   block at 27 grassland sites in Montana (USA) that varied in floral
   abundance and the extent of invasion by exotic forbs. We monitored nest
   construction and the fate of offspring within each nest. The number of
   nests established was positively related to native forb abundance and
   was negatively related to exotic forb species richness. Fecundity was
   positively related to native forb species richness; however, offspring
   mortality caused by the brood parasite Tricrania stansburyi was
   significantly greater in native-dominated sites. These results suggest
   that native floral resources can positively influence bee populations,
   but that the relationship between native floral resources and bee
   population performance is not straightforward. Rather, bees may face a
   trade-off between high offspring production and low offspring survival
   in native-dominated sites.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to determining the value of insect pollinators to
   crop yield assume that plants are primarily pollen limited. This is
   particularly relevant in a crop such as lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium
   angustifolium, where no fruit will set without insect-mediated
   cross-pollination. However, such valuations usually ignore other factors
   that are necessary to maximise crop yields. We conducted an experiment
   to test whether yields of lowbush blueberry attributed to pollinator
   activity increased independently of pest management. The experiment was
   a 2x2 factorial design, incorporating two intensities of pollination
   (25\% or 100\% of flowers), and two levels of insect and disease
   management with recommended fungicide and insecticide sprays (full
   inputs' or no inputs'). We demonstrated an interaction between these two
   factors, such that increased fruit set at harvest was only possible if
   100\% pollination was combined with the full input' treatment.
   Furthermore, increases in fruit weight among the remaining treatments
   were only realised in the full input' plots. These results suggest that
   the value accorded to pollinator activity in blueberries is strongly
   dependent upon pest and disease management of the crop.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of space on the structure (e.g. modularity) of complex
   ecological networks remains largely unknown. Here, we sampled an
   individual-based plant-pollinator network by following the movements and
   flower visits of marked bumblebee individuals within a population of
   thistle plants for which the identities and spatial locations of stems
   were mapped in a 50 x 50 m study plot. The plant-pollinator network was
   dominated by parasitic male bumblebees and had a significantly modular
   structure, with four identified modules being clearly separated in
   space. This indicated that individual flower visitors opted for the
   fine-scale division of resources, even within a local site. However,
   spatial mapping of network modules and movements of bumblebee
   individuals also showed an overlap in the dense center of the plant
   patch. Model selection based on Akaike information criterion with traits
   as predictor variables revealed that thistle stems with high numbers of
   flower heads and many close neighbours were particularly important for
   connecting individuals within the modules. In contrast, tall plants and
   those near the patch center were crucial for connecting the different
   modules to each other. This demonstrated that individual-based
   plant-pollinator networks are influenced by both the spatial structure
   of plant populations and individual-specific plant traits. Additionally,
   bumblebee individuals with long observation times were important for
   both the connectivity between and within modules. The latter suggests
   that bumblebee individuals will still show locally restricted movements
   within sub-patches of plant populations even if they are observed over a
   prolonged time period. Our individual-based and animal-centered approach
   of sampling ecological networks opens up new avenues for incorporating
   foraging behaviour and intra-specific trait variation into analyses of

Abstract = {{Orchid species that are food mimics produce fewer fruits than species
   offering rewards, but few studies have shown the impact of environmental

   the sole population of the endangered Calanthe yaoshanensis as it
   secretes no nectar. We investigated its floral biology, fruit set rates
   and prevailing environmental factors over three seasons (2008-2010).
   Mechanical self-pollination did not occur in C.yaoshanensis, but
   hand-selfed and crossed flowers produced equal numbers of fruit.
   However, seed viability and embryo size were significantly higher in
   cross-pollinated fruits maximizing embryonic fitness. Large hoverflies
   (Syrphidae) and Bombus patagiatus (gynes) were the only pollinarium
   vectors, but they often failed to disperse pollinaria. We interpret the
   temporary retention of the anther cap over the pollinarium as an
   adaptation lowering self-pollination. Insect-mediated rates of
   pollinarium removal were always higher than rates of pollinia deposition
   on stigmas. Over 3 years, natural rates of pollinarium removal differed
   significantly, whereas natural rates of fruit set were not significantly
   different (<22\%). Climate, herbivory and anthropogenic collections also
   inhibited some fruit set and maturation. Both biotic and abiotic factors

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides have been studied as possible contributors to

   significance in corn agro-ecosystems since this crop is frequently
   treated with neonicotinoids and dominates much of the agricultural
   landscape in North America and Europe where bumble bees and other

   bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) hives were placed during pollen shed next
   to corn (Zea mays) fields that were grown from ``conventional{''} seed
   that was treated with neonicotinoids, or ``organic{''} seed that was not

   plants for neonicotinoid residue analysis, pollen types carried by
   worker bees returning to hives were determined, and in autumn hives were
   dissected to measure various endpoints that serve as markers of colony
   vigor. Clothianidin was detected (0.1-0.8 ng/g) in pollen collected from
   all conventional fields, but was not detected in pollen from organic

   no effect on any hive endpoints measured, except the number of workers,

Abstract = {{Jatropha curcas L. is the subject of many research and breeding programs
   concerned with its potential as an oil crop for biodiesel production.
   Despite an increasing amount of information regarding this relatively
   new crop, pollination requirements of this plant are largely neglected.
   The aim of the study was to evaluate the relative significance of ants
   and honeybees as potential pollinators of J. curcas grown under
   Mediterranean conditions. Jatropha curcas plants bloomed throughout the
   summer and fall, peaking twice, in early summer and late fall. During
   this period, the plants were visited by 70 species of insects
   representing 45 families from seven orders, with most species rarely
   being observed. Ants and Honeybees were the most common species,
   accounting for >95\% of all flower visits. The foraging behavior of the
   honeybees followed the pattern of bloom phenology, especially during the
   summer, and mostly promoted cross-pollination. Ants on the other hand,
   mostly promoted self pollination showing no such correlative behavior,
   reacting often too late to nectar availability, and were highly
   susceptible to climatic changes. Pollinator exclusion treatments
   revealed that during summer, fruit and seed sets, as well as seed size
   and oil and protein contents, were relatively similar for ant and
   bee-pollinated flowers. During fall, however, reproductive success of
   bee-pollinated flowers was relatively high (66\%), while fruit set of
   ant-pollinated flowers was significantly reduced from 71 to 11\%. In
   conclusion, while both groups are equal in their pollination
   effectiveness in the summer, during the fall the honeybees are almost
   the sole pollinators of the plant. Based on bloom phenology and
   pollination activity data, the honeybees are responsible for the
   pollination of more than 80\% of the annual reproductive potential of J.
   curcas, under Mediterranean conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Angiosperms engage in distributed reproduction, producing sex organs in
   multiple flowers on one or more inflorescences, including on different
   physical individuals of clonal plants. We investigated the effects of
   alternative deployments of artificial flowers for pollinator behavior
   and simulated pollen dispersal. Plants presented 18 flowers on either
   one inflorescence (1-I plants) or three inflorescences (3-I plants)
   spaced either closely or widely. Bees often skipped inflorescences on
   3-I plants, visiting an average of 1.5 fewer flowers overall than on 1-I
   plants. In simulations with all flowers receiving and donating pollen,
   this behavior caused 7\% less geitonogamy for 3-I plants, contradicting
   a common supposition that clonality increases geitonogamy. Bees
   generally moved upward within inflorescences and downward between
   inflorescences. Consequently, in simulations, segregation of pollen
   receipt to lower flowers and pollen donation to upper flowers reduced
   self-pollination and enhanced pollen export much more for 1-I plants.
   Nectar volume per flower had little relevant influence on bee behavior.
   The observed bee responses and simulated mating results suggest that
   production of multiple inflorescences and clonality promote pollination
   quality when flowers simultaneously receive and donate pollen, whereas a
   single large inflorescence is advantageous when segregation of sex roles
   among flowers reduces geitonogamy effectively.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{185-191}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Social learning is a widespread phenomenon allowing animals to use
   information provided by other animals when presented with a novel
   situation. A number of recent studies suggest that nonspecific Pavlovian
   conditioning may explain some forms of social learning, so that animals
   simply learn to use the presence of conspecifics as a predictor of
   reward. In this study, we investigated the conditions of flower choice
   copying behaviour in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We raised
   bumblebees in controlled laboratory conditions to compare the social
   learning performance of bees with different previous associative
   experiences. We investigated the influence of foraging experience with
   conspecifics on transferring the preference for a socially indicated
   flower type to flowers of the same species not occupied by conspecifics.
   Observers that had the opportunity to associate conspecifics with
   rewarding flowers instantly acquired the social flower preference and
   equally visited occupied and unoccupied flowers of the socially
   indicated flower type (stimulus enhancement). Such usage of social cues
   requires prior experience with live conspecifics (bees familiarized only
   with inanimate model bees did not display the same generalization from
   socially indicated flowers to other flowers of the same type). By
   contrast, nonsocial cues and immobile model bees, even if they had been
   previously associated with rewarding flowers, resulted in a wholly
   different pattern of preference, where observers preferred only those
   individual flowers with the nonsocial cue or model bee attached (local
   enhancement). This difference suggests a special salience of live social
   cues as information providers and results in different patterns of
   associative learning than nonsocial cues. (C) 2014 The Association for

Abstract = {{Pollination is one of the most important ecosystem services and bees the

   potential pollination impact of Diptera, and among them Empidinae, in an
   alpine environment, where the abundance of bees is naturally lower.
   Interactions between 19 entomophilous plants and their flower visitors
   were recorded in a subalpine meadow in the French Alps during six weeks.
   Visitation frequencies were used to build the flower-visitor network.
   Our results show that interactions between flies and plants are
   dominant; flies represent more than 60\% of all visitors, with 54\% of
   them being Empidinae. We especially found that flies, Empidinae and bees
   are the main visitors of 11, three and one plants, respectively. When
   considering both bees and Syrphidae together, six plants were more
   visited by Empidinae; when considering bees and Syrphidae separately, 10
   plants were more visited by Empidinae than by bees or Syrphidae. The

Abstract = {{Mass flowering is a widespread blooming strategy among Neotropical trees

   mass-flowering tree Handroanthus impetiginosus, addressing its breeding
   system, the role in pollination of different visitors, the impact of
   nectar robbers on fruit set and the function of colour changes in nectar
   guides. This xenogamous species is mainly pollinated by Centris and
   Euglossa bees (Apidae) seeking nectar, which are known to fly long
   distances. The flowers favour these bees by having: (1) a closed
   entrance in newly opened flowers which provides access only to strong
   bees capable of deforming the flower tube; and (2) a nectar chamber that
   is accessible only to long-tongued bees. Only first-day flowers with
   yellow nectar guides produce nectar. Pollinators prefer these flowers
   over second- and third-day flowers with orange and red nectar guides,
   respectively. Nectar robbers damage two-thirds of the flowers and this
   robbing activity decreases fruit set by half. We attribute the low fruit
   set of H.impetiginosus to the intense nectar robbing and hypothesize

Abstract = {{We analyze evolution of individual flowering phenologies by combining an
   ecological model of pollinator behavior with a genetic model of
   inbreeding depression for plant viability. The flowering phenology of a
   plant genotype determines its expected daily floral display which,
   together with pollinator behavior, governs the population rate of
   geitonogamous selfing (fertilization among flowers on the same plant).
   Pollinators select plant phenologies in two ways: they are more likely
   to visit plants displaying more flowers per day, and they influence
   geitonogamous selfing and consequent inbreeding depression via their
   abundance, foraging behavior, and pollen carry-over among flowers on a
   plant. Our model predicts two types of equilibria at stable intermediate
   selfing rates for a wide range of pollinator behaviors and pollen
   transfer parameters. Edge equilibria occur at maximal or minimal selfing
   rates and are constrained by pollinators. Internal equilibria occur
   between edge equilibria and are determined by a trade-off between
   pollinator attraction to large floral displays and avoidance of
   inbreeding depression due to selfing. We conclude that unavoidable
   geitonogamous selfing generated by pollinator behavior can contribute to
   the common occurrence of stable mixed mating in plants.}},

Abstract = {{In some angiosperm groups, a parallelism between nectar traits and
   pollination syndromes has been demonstrated, whereas in others there is
   not such relationship and it has been explained as due to phylogenetic
   constraints. However, nectar trait information remains scarce for many
   plant groups. This paper focuses on three groups of Scrophularia
   species, with different flower sizes and principal pollinators, to find
   out whether nectar sugar composition is determined by pollinator type or
   reflects taxonomic affinities. Since the species we examined have
   protogynous flowers, and gender bias in nectar sugar composition has
   been noted in few plant groups, we also investigated whether sexual
   phase influenced Scrophularia nectar composition. The sugar composition
   was found to be similar in all species, having high-sucrose nectar,
   except for the Macaronesian Scrophularia calliantha, which was the only
   species with balanced nectar; this last kind of nectar could be
   associated with the high interaction rates observed between S.calliantha
   and passerine birds. The nectar sugar composition (high in sucrose) was
   unrelated to the principal pollinator group, and could instead be
   considered a conservative taxonomic trait. No gender bias was observed
   between functionally female and male flowers for nectar volume or
   concentration. However, sexual phase significantly affected sucrose
   percentage in the largest-flowered species, where the female phase
   flowers had higher sucrose percentages than the male phase flowers.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Bees (Anthophila) are one of the major groups of angiosperm-pollinating
   insects and accordingly are widely studied in both basic and applied
   research, for which it is essential to have a clear understanding of
   their phylogeny, and evolutionary history. Direct evidence of bee
   evolutionary history has been hindered by a dearth of available fossils
   needed to determine the timing and tempo of their diversification, as
   well as episodes of extinction. Here we describe four new compression
   fossils of bees from three different deposits (Miocene of la Cerdanya,
   Spain; Oligocene of Cereste, France; and Eocene of the Green River
   Formation, U.S.A.). We assess the similarity of the forewing shape of
   the new fossils with extant and fossil taxa using geometric
   morphometrics analyses. Predictive discriminant analyses show that three
   fossils share similar forewing shapes with the Apidae {[}one of
   uncertain tribal placement and perhaps near Euglossini, one definitive
   bumble bee (Bombini), and one digger bee (Anthophorini)], while one
   fossil is more similar to the Andrenidae. The corbiculate fossils are
   described as Euglossopteryx biesmeijeri De Meulemeester, Michez, \&
   Engel, gen. nov. sp. nov. (type species of Euglossopteryx Dehon \&
   Engel, n. gen.) and Bombus cerdanyensis Dehon, De Meulemeester, \&
   Engel, sp. nov. They provide new information on the distribution and
   timing of particular corbiculate groups, most notably the extension into
   North America of possible Eocene-Oligocene cooling-induced extinctions.
   Protohabropoda pauli De Meulemeester \& Michez, gen. nov. sp. nov. (type
   species of Protohabropoda Dehon \& Engel, n. gen.) reinforces previous
   hypotheses of anthophorine evolution in terms of ecological shifts by
   the Oligocene from tropical to mesic or xeric habitats. Lastly, a new
   fossil of the Andreninae, Andrena antoinei Michez \& De Meulemeester,
   sp. nov., further documents the presence of the today widespread genus
   Andrena Fabricius in the Late Oligocene of France.}},

   Community of Native Forbs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Biological invasions can strongly influence species interactions such as
   pollination. Most of the documented effects of exotic plant species on
   plant-pollinator interactions have been observational studies using
   single pairs of native and exotic plants, and have focused on dominant
   exotic plant species. We know little about how exotic plants alter
   interactions in entire communities of plants and pollinators, especially
   at low to medium invader densities. In this study, we began to address
   these gaps by experimentally removing the flowers of a showy invasive
   shrub, Rosa multiflora, and evaluating its effects on the frequency,
   richness, and composition of bee visitors to co-flowering native plants.
   We found that while R. multiflora increased plot-level richness of bee
   visitors to co-flowering native plant species at some sites, its
   presence had no significant effects on bee visitation rate, visitor
   richness, bee community composition, or abundance overall. In addition,
   we found that compared to co-flowering natives, R. multiflora was a
   generalist plant that primarily received visits from generalist bee
   species shared with native plant species. Our results suggest that
   exotic plants such as R. multiflora may facilitate native plant
   pollination in a community context by attracting a more diverse
   assemblage of pollinators, but have limited and idiosyncratic effects on
   the resident plant-pollinator network in general.}},

Abstract = {{Zucchini squash (Cucurbitapepo) has a high pollination demand, and the
   native, ground-nesting squash bee (Peponapis pruinosa) provides the
   majority of the crop's pollination requirement in some environments.
   Squash bees nest directly in crop fields, and nests can be disturbed by
   tillage and other management operations. Mulches that use municipal
   waste materials may provide a weed control strategy for squash plantings
   that is more benign to squash bees than cultivation. Field and
   greenhouse studies were conducted in 2011 and 2012 to compare the
   effects of nontillage weed control methods including polyethylene black
   plastic, woodchips, shredded newspaper, a combination of shredded
   newspaper plus grass clippings (NP + grass), and bare soil (control) on
   soil characteristics, squash pollination and fruit production, and
   squash bee nesting. Woodchips, shredded newspaper, and NP + grass mulch
   decreased soil temperature, while soils beneath newspaper mulch retained
   more moisture. Unmarketable, misshapen fruit occurred more frequently in
   plastic than in the other mulch treatments. No measurable differences in
   floral resource production or crop pollination were found among
   treatments, suggesting that misshapen fruit resulted from high soil
   temperatures in black plastic plots rather than poor pollinator
   attraction. Squash bee nests were located within bare soil, newspaper,
   and NP + grass plots, indicating that these mulches did not prevent
   nesting. NP + grass mulch had a positive effect on plant growth and
   fruit production, possibly from an addition of plant-available nitrogen
   or the presence of preferable nesting ground. Shredded newspaper when
   combined with grass clippings performed as an effective mulch material
   that improved crop performance with no apparent negative impacts on
   squash bee nesting or on squash floral resources and pollination.}},

   development of conopid flies was studied, beginning at the larval
   instars (LO to L3) and PUP, until the emergence of the imago under
   laboratory conditions and inside the host. At the first instar, or LO,
   the microtype larvae measured less than 1 mm in length. During the
   transition from L1 to L3, the larvae grew in length. At L3, the larvae
   doubled their length (4 mm) and then started to develop both in length
   and width, reaching the PUP stage with 10 mm in length and 7 mm in
   width. The main characteristic that differentiates L3 from the early
   instars is the larger body size and the beginning of posterior spiracle
   development. The development from PUP to puparium took less than 24h.
   The bees died ten days after the fly oviposition, or just before full
   PUP development. The early development stages (egg-LO to L1) were
   critical for larva survival. The pupa was visible between the
   intersegmental sternites and, 32 days after pupation, a female imago of
   Physocephala sp. emerged from one bee. The puparium and the fly measured
   approximately 10 mm in length. In a single day of collection, up to 45\%

Abstract = {{Breeding system and pollination biology of Paeonia delavayi
   (Peaoniaceae) from Shangri-La, Yunnan Province, southwest of China were
   studied. Flowering phenologies and flower visitors were observed or
   collected from 2008 to 2011. The pollen viability, stigma receptivity
   and pollination efficiency of different visitors were detected and
   tested. The florescence lasted for 6-9d in a single flower from mid-May
   to late June. A high percentage of flower damage promoted early anther
   dehiscence. Flowers started disseminating pollen at 1-2 d after
   flowering, and lasted for 5-6 d. Pollen viability could be preserved for
   more than 10 d at normal temperature. High seed rate from the stigma was
   observed at 1 d before flowering to 3d after flowering, and the
   dissemination hysteresis was defined as protogyny. The P/O ratios were
   6,124 to 9,713:1, suggesting that the larger quantity of pollen to
   increased the seed setting rate. Three species of bees, eight species of
   beetles, seven species of syrphid flies, four species of ants, and three
   species of butterflies were observed on the flowers. P delavayi rewarded
   to the visitors by releasing fragrance, providing pollen and nectar. On
   the bodies of the visitors under stereomicroscope and scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), much pollen from the plants of similar flowering
   period inner community were found which indicated that these
   incompatible visitors were not species-specific pollinators. The bagging
   experiments showed that P delavayi was self-incompatible and no
   apomixes. Anemophily only played a minor role in the fertilization. A
   few seeds with poor plumpness can be produced by geitonogamy. Seed
   setting rate of artificial xenogamy was higher than natural pollination.
   Artificial control of the visitors' species showed bees being the most
   important pollinators. Beetles and ants participated in pollination to
   some extent and were unstable. Syrphid flies and butterflies were very
   unreliable with low pollination efficiency. Reproductive success
   depended largely on cross-pollination assisted by pollinator activities,
   especially the bees.}},

Abstract = {{Microorganisms frequently colonize the nectar of angiosperm species.
   Though capable of altering a suite of traits important for pollinator
   attraction, few studies exist that test the degree to which they mediate
   pollinator foraging behavior. The objective of our study was to fill
   this gap by assessing the abundance and diversity of yeasts associated
   with the perennial larkspur Delphinium barbeyi (Ranunculaceae) and
   testing whether their presence affected components of pollinator
   foraging behavior. Yeasts frequently colonized D. barbeyi nectar,
   populating 54-77\% of flowers examined depending on site. Though common,
   the yeast community was species-poor, represented by a single species,
   Metschnikowia reukaufii. Female-phase flowers of D. barbeyi were more
   likely to have higher densities of yeasts in comparison to male-phase
   flowers. Pollinators were likely vectors of yeasts, as virgin
   (unvisited) flowers rarely contained yeasts compared to flowers open to
   pollinator visitation, which were frequently colonized. Finally,
   pollinators responded positively to the presence of yeasts. Bombus
   foragers both visited and probed more flowers inoculated with yeasts in
   comparison to uninoculated controls. Taken together, our results suggest
   that variation in the occurrence and density of nectar-inhabiting yeasts
   have the potential to alter components of pollinator foraging behavior
   linked to pollen transfer and plant fitness.}},

Abstract = {{A mismatch of resource availability in certain periods can lead to
   spillover of insects between habitats, resulting in temporal differences

   Hymenoptera to monthly monitor bee and wasp abundance and species
   richness in 12 gardens and 12 rapeseed fields. Half of the gardens and
   rapeseed fields were located in the urban-rural interface and bordered
   each other (a garden paired with a rapeseed field) and the other half
   were isolated in the rural landscape (isolated rapeseed fields) and in
   the urban city centre (isolated gardens). In general, gardens in the
   urban-rural interface comprised the highest richness of bees and wasps.
   The abundance of bees but not of wasps was highest in paired habitats
   and peaked at full rapeseed blooming, indicating that mass-flowering
   rapeseed offers foraging resources for bees nesting in adjacent gardens.
   Thus, bees nest and increase their populations in both areas, benefiting
   from the mass-flowering resource in the agricultural habitat as well as
   the nesting resources from gardens, suggesting spillover of bees but not

   highlights the value of gardens in the urban-rural interface for the

   can promote local pollinator populations and benefit adjacent croplands.}},

Abstract = {{1. Females of solitary, nest-constructing bees determine both sex
   (haplo-diploidy) as well as body size (by amount of provision) of each
   single offspring. 2. According to the Optimal Allocation Theory, females
   should allocate resources in portions that maximise fitness returns. A
   key fitness component in bees is body size that is determined solely by
   the provisions supplied by the mother. 3. The optimal progeny body size
   relies on different factors in both sexes. In females, provision
   efficiency is crucial for reproductive success. In males, however,
   fitness depends primarily on mating success. 4. Provision efficiency of
   Osmia bicornis L. females depends on the capacity to stow pollen (scopa)
   and their ability to carry the packed loads. Scopa capacity increases
   isometrically with body size whereas indices of flight performance (EPI,
   free lift) decrease. These complementary effects substantially
   contribute to the adjustment of optimal body size in daughters. 5. The
   impact of body mass on fitness of males is determined by the mating
   system. Owing to the opportunistic polygyny in O. bicornis, there was no
   detectable correlation between body size and male mating success.
   Consequently, mother bees distribute their provisions to many, but small
   sons to increase the number of descendant competitors in the race for
   matings. Optimal body size in sons is a trade-off between a large male
   advantage in rare scrambles over receptive females and
   small-size-related disadvantages in viability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Functional diversity (FD) of pollinators can increase plant
   reproductive output and the stability of plant-pollinator communities.
   Yet, in times of world-wide pollinator declines, effects of global
   change on pollinator FD remain poorly understood. Loss of natural
   habitat and exotic plant invasions are two major drivers of global
   change that particularly threaten pollinator diversity. 2. In a
   subtropical South African landscape, we investigated changes in the FD
   of flower visitor assemblages on native and exotic plants along
   gradients of natural habitat loss and relative abundance of exotic
   plants. We used a data set of 1434 flower visitor individuals sampled on
   131 focal plants and calculated the FD in three flower visitor traits
   that are strongly related to plant-flower visitor interactions and
   pollination processes: proboscis length, proboscis diameter and body
   length. 3. Multivariate FD of flower visitors decreased with both
   increasing natural habitat loss and relative exotic abundance.
   Importantly, changes in FD went beyond those in flower visitor richness.
   Furthermore, flower visitor richness was not related to either natural
   habitat loss or relative exotic abundance. Loss in multivariate FD
   seemed to be mediated by complementary reductions of FD in proboscis
   length with natural habitat loss and of FD in body length with both
   global change drivers. Correspondingly, we recorded lower abundances of
   long-tongued flower visitors with natural habitat loss and reduced
   variance in body size with both drivers. In contrast, FD in proboscis
   diameter was unaffected by either driver. All effects of the two global
   change drivers were non-interactive. 4. Our results show that both
   natural habitat loss and exotic plants negatively affect flower visitor
   FD, which may imperil pollination of specialized plant species in
   degraded habitats. In contrast, flower visitor richness may not cover
   all facets of flower visitor FD that are relevant to pollination
   processes. Distinct responses of visitor traits to the two drivers
   suggest limited options to infer relations of one trait to another.
   Finally, additive effects of natural habitat loss and exotic plant
   invasions highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global
   change when investigating ecosystem processes at a community scale.}},

Abstract = {{Floral orientation may affect pollinator attraction and pollination
   effectiveness, and its influences may differ among pollinator species.
   We, therefore, hypothesized that, for plant species with a generalized
   pollination system, changes in floral orientation would affect the
   composition of pollinators and their relative contribution to
   pollination. Geranium refractum, an alpine plant with downward floral
   orientation was used in this study. We created upward-facing flowers by
   altering the flower angle. We compared the pollinator diversity,
   pollination effectiveness, and pollinator importance, as well as female
   reproductive success between flowers with downward- and upward-facing
   orientation. Results indicated that the upward-facing flowers were
   visited by a wider spectrum of pollinators (classified into functional
   groups), with higher pollinator diversity than natural flowers.
   Moreover, due to influences on visitation number and pollen removal, the
   pollinator importance exhibited by the main pollinator groups differed
   between flower types. Compared with natural flowers, the pollination
   contribution of principal pollinators (i.e., bumblebees) decreased in
   upward-facing flowers and other infrequent pollinators, such as solitary
   bees and muscoid flies, removed more pollen. Consequently, stigmatic
   pollen loads were lower in upward- than in downward-facing flowers.
   These findings reveal that floral orientation may affect the level of
   generalization of a pollination system and the relative importance of
   diverse pollinators. In this species, the natural downward-facing floral
   orientation may increase pollen transfer by effective pollinators and
   reduce interference by inferior pollinators.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{320-331}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Conservation of pollinator abundance and diversity is an important issue
   because it contributes to maintaining a diverse community of plant
   species in agroecosystems. The presence of semi-natural areas favorable
   to pollination is a key factor for achieving this objective of
   sustainability. Sowing mixtures of dicotyledonous plants that are rich
   in pollen and nectar as flower strips along field margins is an
   efficient solution to attract pollinators and to support their foraging
   activity on arable land. The enhancement of agroecosystems requires
   operational methods that make it possible to assess the impact of
   existing and sown semi-natural areas on pollination. We developed here a
   new predictive indicator that can be used at the field margin and floral
   levels, which predicts the pollination value of floral diversity and
   abundance of field margins on arable land.
   We based the predictive indicator on decision trees using ``if-then{''}
   linguistic rules because of the lack of sufficient quantitative
   knowledge about the relationships between floral traits and pollination.
   This approach makes it possible to use quantitative and qualitative
   information. We associated fuzzy subsets to the decision trees and the
   classes of variables in order to avoid the knife-edge effect of class
   limits. At the species level, the indicator depends on three criteria:
   (i) visual attractiveness in terms of flower size, color and UV
   reflection; (ii) flower accessibility according to the botanical family,
   the symmetry and the shape of the flower; and (iii) the reward linked to
   pollen and nectar quantity and quality. An aggregation procedure allows
   us to obtain a value at the field margin level for each month as a
   function of the flowering period and pollination activity. Examples of
   calculations for honeybees, wild bees, bumblebees and hoverflies are
   shown.
   The evaluation of the predictive quality yielded significant
   correlations between pollinator abundance and the indicator value. The
   level of correlation is satisfying for this type of indicator, which
   might be further improved with additional data on plant traits. Coupling
   this indicator with a model that assesses the impact of management on
   plant diversity and abundance will be a further step to help agronomists
   who work on the improvement of arable farming management in order to
   lower its negative impact on pollination. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   visited by P. palpalis, and tested the main volatile compounds of both
   species under field conditions to evaluate their attractiveness to bees
   of P. palpalis. Methoxylated aromatics were the dominant floral scent
   components in both species, but each species exhibited a characteristic
   scent profile. Dual choice bioassays using artificial flowers made of
   yellow and blue adhesive paper clearly revealed that rho-methylanisole
   alone, the dominant volatile of H. martii, attracted significantly more
   bees than unbaited flowers. This compound represents an olfactory
   communication channel used by the plant that lures its effective
   oligolectic pollinators to its flowers. Yellow artificial flowers baited
   significantly more bees than blue ones. Our study reinforces the recent
   findings that specific compounds in complex floral scent bouquets are
   crucial for host-plant location in oligolectic bees.}},

Abstract = {{Bee species diversity and the effectiveness of four sampling methods
   were investigated in a west-central Illinois restored tallgrass prairie.
   Bees were sampled using malaise traps, ground-level pan traps, elevated
   pan traps, and vane traps. A total of 4,622 bees representing 31 genera
   and 111 species were collected. Malaise traps collected the greatest
   number of bees and species, and ground-level pan traps the least. Among
   the pan traps and vane traps, blue-colored traps collected the greatest
   abundance and species richness, and yellow traps the least. Chao1
   estimator and rarefaction analyses showed that substantial increases in
   sample sizes would be necessary to achieve asymptotic species richness
   levels, particularly if ground-level pan traps alone were used. Elevated
   pan traps and vane traps collected relatively similar species
   composition. Different colored pan traps at the same height collected
   more similar species composition than did those at different heights,
   but species composition of blue ground-level pan traps was relatively
   similar to elevated pan traps, regardless of color. Indicator species
   analysis revealed 22 species that were significantly associated with a
   specific trap type, and 11 species that were associated with a
   particular pan trap color/elevation. Results of this study show that
   elevated traps can increase the effectiveness of bee surveys in
   tallgrass prairie, and that a combination of trap types gives a more
   complete picture of the bee fauna than does a single survey method.
   These results should be considered along with cost, ease of use, and

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{480-489}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Competition for pollinators between phenotypically similar flowers is
   believed to play an important role in floral trait diversification in
   the angiosperms. However, in many plant communities, species with
   apparently similar floral phenotypes and generalist pollination systems
   co-flower. Here, the pollination systems of Ranunculus acris L. and
   Ranunculus repens L. were investigated to determine the factors enabling
   the species to coexist within apparently overlapping pollination niches.
   Methods
   Sympatrically flowering populations of R. acris and R. repens were
   investigated at three study sites in West Wales. The floral phenotypes
   of the two species were compared using measurements of floral morphology
   and spectral analyses of petal reflectance, using principal component
   analysis and bee and fly colour-space models. Evidence of inter-specific
   discrimination by foraging insects was tested for in the field and using
   floral arrays. The relative roles of behavioural constancy and spatial
   patchiness in maintaining pollinator fidelity were estimated.
   Important Findings
   The floral phenotypes of R. acris and R. repens differed significantly.
   Social bees were highly constant when foraging at flowers of the two
   species and patchy floral distribution explained some of the observed
   fidelity. Dipterans visiting mixed floral arrays appeared to
   discriminate between the species, visiting more R. acris than R. repens
   flowers, but there was no difference in the number of visits to
   single-species arrays. Social bees were more likely to display constancy
   to flowers of R. repens in the field.
   Patchiness in floral distribution, subtle differences in floral
   phenotype, pollinator preferences and behavioural constancy are all
   likely to contribute to the continued coexistence of R. acris and R.
   repens, despite apparent overlap in their pollination niches. Such
   differences have the potential to facilitate the maintenance of species
   diversity in plant communities, even where plants appear to share
   similar floral phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{In temperate and tropical environments agricultural intensification has
   primarily negative consequences for pollinator conservation. However, in
   arid environments agriculture is often highly dependent on irrigation
   and farms can offer higher availability of floral resources than the
   external environment.
   This study compares floral visitation rates to wild plants inside and
   outside 40 agricultural gardens in South Sinai, Egypt. The mean number
   of flower visitors per plant during a 30 min focal watch was
   significantly higher inside the gardens than outside, and this was true
   of orders Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.
   In total, 23 insect families were recorded inside the garden and 17
   outside. The average family richness per plant was significantly higher
   inside the gardens, with higher rates of family accumulation across
   focal plants. Pollinating insects (hoverflies, solitary bees and
   honeybees) all had higher visitation rates inside the gardens.
   Seed set was assessed for two common pollinator-dependent plants,
   Stachys aegyptiaca and Alkanna orientalis. Neither species showed a
   significant difference in the seed set achieved inside and outside of
   the gardens, but S. aegyptiaca produced a higher number of seeds per
   plant inside the gardens because plants tended to be larger.
   In contrast to many other studies, the presence of agriculture appears
   to increase the abundance and diversity of flower visitors in this
   under-studied system, with no negative effect on the seed set of two
   common wild species. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bumblebees (Bombus species) are major pollinators of commercial crops
   and wildflowers but factors affecting their abundance, including causes
   of recent population declines, remain unclear. Investigating the ecology
   of species with expanding ranges provides a potentially powerful means
   of elucidating these factors. Such species may also bring novel
   pollination services to their new ranges. We therefore investigated
   landscape-scale habitat use and foraging preferences of the Tree
   Bumblebee, B. hypnorum, a recent natural colonist that has rapidly
   expanded its range in the UK over the past decade. Counts of B. hypnorum
   and six other Bombus species were made in March-June 2012 within a mixed
   landscape in south-eastern Norfolk, UK. The extent of different
   landscape elements around each transect was quantified at three scales
   (250 m, 500 m and 1500 m). We then identified the landscape elements
   that best predicted the density of B. hypnorum and other Bombus species.
   At the best fitting scale (250 m), B. hypnorum density was significantly
   positively associated with extent of both urban and woodland cover and
   significantly negatively associated with extent of oilseed rape cover.
   This combination of landscape predictors was unique to B. hypnorum.
   Urban and woodland cover were associated with B. hypnorum density at
   three and two, respectively, of the three scales studied. Relative to
   other Bombus species, B. hypnorum exhibited a significantly higher
   foraging preference for two flowering trees, Crataegus monogyna and
   Prunus spinosa, and significantly lower preferences for Brassica napus,
   Glechoma hederacea and Lamium album. Our study provides novel,
   quantitative support for an association of B. hypnorum with urban and
   woodland landscape elements. Range expansion in B. hypnorum appears to
   depend, on exploitation of widespread habitats underutilised by native
   Bombus species, suggesting B. hypnorum will readily co-exist with these
   species. These findings suggest that management could target bumblebee
   species with distinctive habitat requirements to help maintain
   pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss-one of the most prominent forms of modern
   environmental change-has been heavily driven by terrestrial habitat loss
   and, in particular, the spread and intensification of agriculture.
   Expanding agricultural land-use has led to the search for strong
   conservation strategies, with some suggesting that biodiversity
   conservation in agriculture is best maximized by reducing local
   management intensity, such as fertilizer and pesticide application.
   Others highlight the importance of landscape-level approaches that
   incorporate natural or semi-natural areas in landscapes surrounding
   farms. Here, we show that both of these practices are valuable to the
   conservation of biodiversity, and that either local or landscape factors
   can be most crucial to conservation planning depending on which types of
   organisms one wishes to save. We performed a quantitative review of 266
   observations taken from 31 studies that compared the impacts of
   localized (within farm) management strategies and landscape complexity
   (around farms) on the richness and abundance of plant, invertebrate and
   vertebrate species in agro-ecosystems. While both factors significantly
   impacted species richness, the richness of sessile plants increased with
   less-intensive local management, but did not significantly respond to
   landscape complexity. By contrast, the richness of mobile vertebrates
   increased with landscape complexity, but did not significantly increase
   with less-intensive local management. Invertebrate richness and
   abundance responded to both factors. Our analyses point to clear
   differences in how various groups of organisms respond to differing
   scales of management, and suggest that preservation of multiple
   taxonomic groups will require multiple scales of conservation.}},

Volume = {{176}},

Abstract = {{Loquat(Eriobotryajaponica Lindl.), a member of the Rosaceae, carries the
   RNase-dependent gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) fertilization
   system. However, some cultivars, including the Israeli `Yehuda' and
   `Akko 1', are self-compatible (SC). Since SC cultivars are not dependent
   on pollen donors, they are usually planted in `solid blocks'.
   Nevertheless, in some SC Rosaceae species, such as apricot, cherry and
   almond, enhanced self- or cross-pollination increases fruit set. To
   determine whether enhanced pollination can improve `Yehuda' and `Akko 1'
   fruit set and fruit size relative to spontaneous self-pollination, the
   impact of introducing honey beet and the effect of cross-pollination
   were examined. We found that honey bees are highly attracted to `Yehuda'
   and `Akko 1' flowers, and fruit size in both cultivars was positively
   correlated with the number of seeds per fruit. In a net-caged tree
   experiment, fruit set of `Yehuda' and `Akko 1' benefited from the
   presence of honey bees. However, fruit set was also relatively high for
   the caged trees without honey bees which underwent spontaneous
   self-pollination, and commercial fruit thinning was required for all
   treatments. For both cultivars, seed set after spontaneous
   self-pollination was the same as for self-pollination in the presence of
   honey bees. The impact of cross-pollination between different cultivars
   moderately increased `Yehuda' fruit set and `Akko 1' seed set. Taken
   together, the results suggest that spontaneous self-pollination meets
   the pollination requirements for the SC loquat cultivars `Yehuda' and
   `Akko 1', and that the presence of pollen donors and/or honey bees
   confers a minor commercial advantage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic linear developments, such as trails and firebreaks, also

   altering the ecological interactions in which animals are involved. For
   example, SID can affect the behavior of pollinators and herbivores, but
   little is known about the combined effect of these three elements on
   plant reproduction.
   We evaluated the combined effect of SID, insect pollinators and
   herbivores (ungulates) on three reproductive output variables (fruit
   set, seed set, and seed mass) of a Mediterranean shrub (Hahn-dual
   Italian:Milani), We considered two different habitats (SLD verges vs
   adjacent scrublands), two scenarios of herbivory (with and without
   ungulates), and three scenarios of pollinator activity (without
   pollinators, with manual pollination and with natural pollination).
   SLD had contrasting effects on H. halimplium reproduction. In the
   absence of herbivores, overall fruit set was lower in the verges of SLD
   than in adjacent scrublands, probably due to lower flower pollination
   rates. Where herbivores were present, overall fruit set was similar
   between habitats, because ungulate browsing was lower in SLD verges than
   in adjacent scrublands. The quantity and weight of seeds per fruit was
   similar in both habitats, probably because all fertilized flowers
   received similar amounts of pollen.
   SLD can alter the interaction among pollinators, herbivores and plants,
   leading lo changes in the reproductive performance of the latter. These
   changes can have strong negative impacts on endangered plants that rely

Abstract = {{Geographic trait variations are often caused by locally different

   altitudinal floral size variation of Campanula punctata var. hondoensis

   whether the altitudinal floral size variation was correlated with the
   size of the local bumblebee pollinator and to assess whether floral size

   variations in pollinator assemblages along altitude, which consequently
   produced a geographic change in pollinator size. Similarly, we found
   altitudinal changes in floral size, which proved to be correlated with
   the local pollinator size, but not with altitude itself. Furthermore,
   pollen removal from flower styles onto bees (plant's male fitness) was
   strongly influenced by the size match between flower style length and
   pollinator mouthpart length. These results strongly suggest that C.

   disturbance in the study area; and 3) whether the most important plants
   for pollinators in terms of interspecific interactions contribute
   differentially to temporal stability. The most diverse communities were
   more stable in floral resource production along the flowering season.
   Stability of flower production was also influenced by a positive
   indirect effect of elevation. The plants that contributed the most to
   temporal stability were the most abundant and densely connected species,
   those at the core of the plant-pollinator network. Our study shows that
   species richness enhances the availability of floral resources for
   pollinators, providing a strong support for the diversity-stability
   hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. The Neotropical family Cyclanthaceae is one of five
   families of the order Pandanales, which includes some misfit taxa that
   are morphologically highly anomalous. In the taxonomically isolated
   genus Cyclanthus, which is sister to all other Cyclanthaceae, individual
   flowers are not readily distinguishable. Instead, flowers are replaced
   by discoidal rings that encircle the inflorescence. We compare features
   that are shared among misfit taxa.
   Methodology. We use scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to
   describe the reproductive structures of both subfamilies of
   Cyclanthaceae, including Cyclanthus bipartitus (Cyclanthoideae) and
   several Carludovicoideae.
   Pivotal results. Our pollination observations on Carludovica palmata
   flowers contrast with some other reports, because we observed only small
   black bees of the Meliponini tribe visiting this species. The anomalous
   reproductive structures of Cyclanthus show some features in common with
   Carludovicoideae, especially the presence of large axial mucilage
   canals. However, Cyclanthus differs from Carludovicoideae in several
   respects; for example, the outer integument is relatively poorly
   developed in Cyclanthus. The staminodes on male flowers of
   Carludovicoideae are secretory, with elongated epidermal cells.
   Conclusions. We interpret as staminodes the sterile secretory lobes that
   are present on the androphore of most Carludovicoideae. Our observations
   enhance existing knowledge of floral anatomy of Cyclanthaceae,
   especially Cyclanthus, and provide a comparative basis for future
   studies of Pandanales.}},

Abstract = {{Honeybees and bumblebees are the most important pollinators of
   agricultural crops. For this purpose honeybees and bumblebees are reared
   and transported. A pathogen-free status of bees in general, is crucial.
   Indeed anthropogenic transports of hosts carrying parasites could alter
   the natural host/pathogen association, inducing an extra pathogenic
   stress. Therefore the creation of a pathogen-free rearing environment is
   needed. For bumblebees this is possible, as these species are reared in
   a closed environment. Although, a link remains between reared bumblebees
   and the outside bee community, as honeybee-collected pollen is essential
   food for bumblebee mass rearing. Here we evaluated if gamma irradiation
   can minimize the risk of this potential route of exposure and can
   inactivate viral particles present in honeybee-collected pollen. We show
   that 16.9 kGy gamma irradiation induced a 100-1000 fold reduction on the
   ability of IAPV to cause mortality after injections. This result opens
   avenues toward rearing pathogen-free bumblebees and towards eliminating
   the risks of pathogen spillover to native wild bee species. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the complete life cycle of a parasite is crucial to
   understand the epidemiology and population dynamics of a disease. The
   populations of several social insect pollinators are decreasing, and
   parasites are often cited as a contributing factor. The exact
   transmission pathway of the bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi (Lipa \&
   Triggiani) (Kinetoplastea: Trypanosomatidae) between two hosts is still
   unknown, although a previous laboratory experiment suggests transmission
   via the nectar of flowers. Plant species may differentially protect or
   negatively affect the parasite while it resides in the flower, for
   instance if plants vary in their floral shape or the compounds present
   in their nectar. This will lead to differential transmission success and
   potentially influence disease epidemiology. In the present study we
   aimed at determining whether the parasite may indeed be transmitted in
   the nectar by the bumblebee Bombus terrestris (L.) (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae). We found that parasite survival was significantly decreased in
   water with higher sugar concentrations. However, none of the
   field-collected nectar samples contained parasite cells, and no parasite
   cells were transmitted between two artificial flowers by a foraging

Title = {{Biological Flora of the British Isles: Epipactis palustris}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1341-1355}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Epipactis palustris (L.) Crantz that are relevant to understanding its
   ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented
   within the framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:
   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characteristics, herbivores and disease, history, and
   conservation.
   2. Epipactis palustris is native to Britain, being widely distributed
   throughout England and Wales, but is less common in the north. Although
   absent from most of Scotland, it occurs as far north as Perthshire. It
   is widely distributed in Ireland. The species extends throughout most of
   Europe, occurring as far east as Mongolia and the north of Turkey, but
   it is absent from the southern Mediterranean region.
   3. Epipactis palustris grows mainly in full sunlight, rarely under
   shade, and on calcareous, but nutrient-poor, moist to wet substrates. It
   favours flushed or seasonally inundated areas in which the intensity of
   competition from other vegetation is low. It is most commonly found in
   wet dune slacks, calcareous fens and on peat, but it also occurs on
   sandy substrates overlying heavy clay or loamy soils. Occasionally, it
   can also be found near the top of slopes in chalk downland.
   4. Epipactis palustris multiplies both by vegetative propagation and
   sexual reproduction. Vegetative propagation involves the production of
   regularly branched rhizomes. It flowers in Britain from the end of June
   until the beginning of September. The flowers produce nectar, which is
   often colonized by bacteria and to a lesser extent by yeasts. The
   species is pollinated by a wide range of insects, including honeybees,
   flies, wasps, beetles, bumblebees and ants, but is also capable of
   limited spontaneous autogamy. The most efficient pollinators are small
   bees and solitary wasps. Fruit production is generally high (>80\% of
   the flowers produce capsules).
   5. Epipactis palustris is vulnerable to changes in soil water level and
   to substrate nutrient enrichment. It has suffered a strong decline in
   its distribution range in Britain, with most losses of local populations
   occurring before 1930. Habitat destruction and drainage of marshes and
   fens appear to be the most common causes for the decline of the species.
   Restoration of old wet dune slacks by topsoil removal and addition of
   hay from neighbouring vegetation has been successful in encouraging
   colonization and establishment of populations of the species within a
   few years. Cessation of draining of mires may also promote the long-term
   survival of populations of the species.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Vanilla is the most diverse in Vanilloideae, with ca 90
   species distributed among tropical regions. Despite their economic
   importance, studies on pollination of Vanilla are very scarce and data
   on pollinators of species endemic to Brazil are lacking. Based on
   fieldwork and laboratory investigations, the floral biology of V.
   edwallii was studied. The pollinators and pollination process were
   recorded at the Serra do Japi reserve, state of Sao Paulo, southeastern
   Brazil, and the presence of floral reward was also investigated. Vanilla
   edwallii blooms in summer. The lateral inflorescences produce up to four
   pale green flowers. The white labellum is united to the base of the
   column forming a mentum. In the studied population V. edwallii is
   pollinated by Epicharis (Hoplepicharis) affinis, where the males exhibit
   a territorial behavior, defending flowers from other possible flower
   visitors. The pollen is deposited on the scutellum of bees when they
   abandon the flower. The mentum region is dry, suggesting no nectar
   production. The only secretory structures are osmophores dispersed on
   the inner surface of the lip responsible for production of a sweet
   fragrance, which together with color and morphology of flowers is
   related to bee attraction. The labellum is rich in mucilaginous cells,
   while the mucilaginous substance is retained inside the cells. The
   histochemical analysis also detected the presence of phenolic compounds
   and starch concentrated mainly at the adaxial surface of the lip and
   around the vascular bundles.}},

Abstract = {{Continually flowering plants bloom continuously throughout the year, as

   suffruticosa (Griff. ex Hook. f. \& Thomson) Martelli (Dilleniaceae) is
   one such continually flowering shrub that flowers during periods of
   community-wide mass flowering, general flowering (GF), and non-GF.
   During irregularly occurring GF periods, when species of all forest
   layers flower synchronously for several months, some pollinators migrate
   to the canopy layer, where GF promotes the pollination success of
   participating plants. Continually flowering plants share the available
   pollinator community with GF plants, and the reproductive success of
   continually flowering plants may be affected during the GF period. To
   assess the effects of GF on the reproductive success of a diverse range
   of continually flowering plants, we examined the differences in
   pollinator density and reproductive success between GF and non-GF
   periods in D.suffruticosa at four different research sites. Although the
   seed set differed among the four research sites, pollinator density and
   fruit set did not differ between GF and non-GF periods or research

   with higher proportions of non-arable agricultural land (e.g. permanent

Abstract = {{Understanding how climate change can affect crop-pollinator systems
   helps predict potential geographical mismatches between a crop and its
   pollinators, and therefore identify areas vulnerable to loss of
   pollination services. We examined the distribution of orchard species
   (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in
   Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for
   2050 under the SRES A1B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of
   pollinator availability as a proxy for pollination service. At present,
   there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators,
   but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for
   orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability. However, we found
   that pollinator availability may persist in areas currently used for
   fruit production, which are predicted to provide suboptimal

Abstract = {{There is growing interest in improving the biodiversity of urban and

   intervention that may be used to boost flower and pollinator abundance;
   the sowing of plots of wildflowers in amenity grasslands. The abundance
   of flowers, bumblebees (Bombus spp.), and hoverflies (Syrphidae) was
   surveyed in 30 such plots, either 1 or 2years after they had been sown.
   Overall, sown plots had 25 times more flowers, 50 times more bumblebees,
   and 13 times more hoverflies compared to paired control plots. Floral
   abundance and bee abundance increased from year 1 to year 2, but
   hoverflies were more abundant in plots in their first year, reflecting
   their preference for shallow annual flowers. Our data demonstrate that
   flower-poor amenity grasslands can be readily converted to flower-rich
   areas that are highly attractive to pollinators, providing a simple tool

Abstract = {{Urban gardens may support bees by providing resources in otherwise

   to ask: 1) Does bee diversity, abundance, and community composition
   differ in backyard gardens with and without native plants? 2) What
   characteristics of backyard gardens and land cover in the surrounding
   landscape correlate with changes in the bee community? 3) Do bees in
   backyard gardens respond more strongly to local or landscape factors? We
   sampled bees with pan trapping, netting, and direct observation. We
   examined vegetation characteristics and land cover in 500 m, 1 km, and 2
   km buffers surrounding each garden. Abundance of all bees, native bees,
   and cavity-nesting bees (but not ground-nesting bees) was greater in
   native plant gardens but only richness of cavity-nesting bees differed
   in gardens with and without native plants. Bee community composition
   differed in gardens with and without native plants. Overall, bee
   richness and abundance were positively correlated with local
   characteristics of backyard gardens, such as increased floral abundance,
   taller vegetation, more cover by woody plants, less cover by grass, and
   larger vegetable gardens. Differences in the amount of forest, open

   and ground-nesting bees, but at different spatial scales. Thus, presence
   of native plants, and local and landscape characteristics might play
   important roles in maintaining bee diversity within urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) are important pollinators in many
   ecosystems, but their diversity has declined in Europe during the past
   century, mainly due to habitat loss. However, some of the habitat
   requirements of wild bees are met in anthropogenic landscape elements,
   such as road sides, power-line strips and field edges. Moreover, as the
   bee species assemblages change throughout the season the habitat
   requirements of the bee fauna may change accordingly. Understanding such
   seasonally distinct responses of solitary bees with different
   phenologies may be of high value for local conservation planning. The
   purpose of this study was to examine if the habitat quality of field
   edges for solitary bees change throughout the season, and how this
   temporal variation relates to local habitat and landscape conditions. By
   sampling solitary bees in 18 field edges in southeast Norway throughout
   the season we found that the species richness and abundance of bees was
   highest in sun exposed field edges, independently of the season.
   However, we found phenologically distinct responses to the landscape
   context. Moreover, field edges situated in landscapes with a high
   proportion of forests and semi-natural landscape elements hosted the
   most phenologically diverse bee species assemblages. We conclude that in
   order to fulfil the habitat requirements of bee species assemblages
   throughout the season, one should conserve and direct habitat
   restoration schemes towards increasing sun exposure at field edges with
   a diverse flora and a high proportion of semi-natural areas in the
   vicinity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Plant hybrid zones often display a large diversity in floral

   and level of flower constancy.Methods: To test the influence of floral
   diversity on the number of visits to inflorescences of the most common
   type and on the level of flower constancy, we monitored bumblebees'
   behaviour in experimental arrays of artificial inflorescences with a
   common (parental') floral type mixed with either one or three uncommon
   (hybrid') floral types.Results: We found that pollinators preferentially

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification and loss of semi-natural habitats have induced
   a severe decline of bee diversity in agricultural landscapes.
   Semi-natural habitats like calcareous grasslands are among the most
   important bee habitats in central Europe, but they are threatened by
   decreasing habitat area and quality, and by homogenization of the
   surrounding landscape affecting both landscape composition and
   configuration. In this study we tested the importance of habitat area,
   quality and connectivity as well as landscape composition and
   configuration on wild bees in calcareous grasslands. We made detailed
   trait-specific analyses as bees with different traits might differ in
   their response to the tested factors. Species richness and abundance of
   wild bees were surveyed on 23 calcareous grassland patches in Southern
   Germany with independent gradients in local and landscape factors. Total
   wild bee richness was positively affected by complex landscape
   configuration, large habitat area and high habitat quality (i.e. steep
   slopes). Cuckoo bee richness was positively affected by complex
   landscape configuration and large habitat area whereas habitat
   specialists were only affected by the local factors habitat area and
   habitat quality. Small social generalists were positively influenced by
   habitat area whereas large social generalists (bumblebees) were
   positively affected by landscape composition (high percentage of
   semi-natural habitats). Our results emphasize a strong dependence of
   habitat specialists on local habitat characteristics, whereas cuckoo
   bees and bumblebees are more likely affected by the surrounding
   landscape. We conclude that a combination of large high-quality patches
   and heterogeneous landscapes maintains high bee species richness and
   communities with diverse trait composition. Such diverse communities
   might stabilize pollination services provided to crops and wild plants
   on local and landscape scales.}},

   Gradient}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Wild bees are important pollinators that have declined in
   diversity and abundance during the last decades. Habitat destruction and
   fragmentation associated with urbanization are reported as part of the
   main causes of this decline. Urbanization involves dramatic changes of
   the landscape, increasing the proportion of impervious surface while
   decreasing that of green areas. Few studies have investigated the
   effects of urbanization on bee communities. We assessed changes in the
   abundance, species richness, and composition of wild bee community along
   an urbanization gradient.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Over two years and on a monthly basis,
   bees were sampled with colored pan traps and insect nets at 24 sites
   located along an urbanization gradient. Landscape structure within three
   different radii was measured at each study site. We captured 291 wild
   bee species. The abundance of wild bees was negatively correlated with
   the proportion of impervious surface, while species richness reached a
   maximum at an intermediate (50\%) proportion of impervious surface. The
   structure of the community changed along the urbanization gradient with
   more parasitic species in sites with an intermediate proportion of
   impervious surface. There were also greater numbers of cavity-nesting
   species and long-tongued species in sites with intermediate or higher
   proportion of impervious surface. However, urbanization had no effect on
   the occurrence of species depending on their social behavior or body
   size.
   Conclusions/Significance: We found nearly a third of the wild bee fauna
   known from France in our study sites. Indeed, urban areas supported a
   diverse bee community, but sites with an intermediate level of
   urbanization were the most speciose ones, including greater proportion
   of parasitic species. The presence of a diverse array of bee species
   even in the most urbanized area makes these pollinators worthy of being
   a flagship group to raise the awareness of urban citizens about
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Distinct floral pollination syndromes have emerged multiple times during
   the diversification of flowering plants. For example, in western North
   America, a hummingbird pollination syndrome has evolved more than 100
   times, generally from within insect-pollinated lineages. The hummingbird
   syndrome is characterized by a suite of floral traits that attracts and
   facilitates pollen movement by hummingbirds, while at the same time
   discourages bee visitation. These floral traits generally include large
   nectar volume, red flower colour, elongated and narrow corolla tubes and
   reproductive organs that are exerted from the corolla. A handful of
   studies have examined the genetic architecture of hummingbird
   pollination syndrome evolution. These studies find that mutations of
   relatively large effect often explain increased nectar volume and
   transition to red flower colour. In addition, they suggest that adaptive
   suites of floral traits may often exhibit a high degree of genetic
   linkage, which could facilitate their fixation during pollination
   syndrome evolution. Here, we explore these emerging generalities by
   investigating the genetic basis of floral pollination syndrome
   divergence between two related Penstemon species with different
   pollination syndromes-bee-pollinated P. neomexicanus and closely related
   hummingbird-pollinated P. barbatus. in an F-2 mapping population derived
   from a cross between these two species, we characterized the effect size
   of genetic loci underlying floral trait divergence associated with the
   transition to bird pollination, as well as correlation structure of
   floral trait variation. We find the effect sizes of quantitative trait
   loci for adaptive floral traits are in line with patterns observed in
   previous studies, and find strong evidence that suites of floral traits
   are genetically linked. This linkage may be due to genetic proximity or
   pleiotropic effects of single causative loci. Interestingly, our data
   suggest that the evolution of floral traits critical for hummingbird
   pollination was not constrained by negative pleiotropy at loci that show
   co-localization for multiple traits.}},

Abstract = {{Taxonomy has far-reaching effects throughout biology, and incorrect
   taxonomy can be detrimental in many ways. Polymorphic species complexes,
   many of which exist in the bee genus Anthophora Latreille, lend
   themselves to such difficulties. This study employs environmental niche
   mapping (ENM) and traditional morphological analyses to investigate the
   validity of the subjective synonymy of Anthophora (Heliophila) curta
   Provancher with the senior synonym A. squammulosa Dours. Eleven of fifty
   morphological characters consistently differentiate the two putative
   species, with an additional five characters sometimes separating them.
   Additionally, based on over 1000 georeferenced museum specimens, the
   geographic ranges of the two taxa do not overlap. The two entities also
   react differently to the bioclimatic variables based on correlation
   analysis. We further tested the two-species hypothesis by constructing
   ENMs with informative bioclimatic variables associated with locality
   records. Their modelled distributions overlapped less than 1\%,
   suggesting discrete environmental boundaries. The variables which
   contributed most to each species' model also differed. These differences
   are explored in relation to their habitats. The combined morphological
   and biogeographic analysis indicates that A. curta and A. squammulosa
   are distinct species. Based on the accumulated evidence the synonymy is
   formally rejected and A. curta is recognized as a valid species. Five
   additional taxa (A. bispinosa Cockerell, A. franciscana Cockerell, A.
   usticauda Cockerell, A. u. cinerior Cockerell, A. zamoranella Cockerell)
   are newly synonymized with A. squammulosa and Anthophora curta var.
   melanops Cockerell is newly synonymized with A. curta. Implications
   outside of taxonomy are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Cavity-nesting megachilid bees in the genus Osmia, found throughout the
   Palearctic and Nearctic regions, are good candidates for domestication.
   In North America, Osmia lignaria Say has been reported to be an
   excellent pollinator of tree fruit and is currently being developed for
   commercial use in orchards. This is largely because of research over
   several decades with the western subspecies of this bee, Osmia lignaria
   propinqua Cresson, in western orchards. The behavior of the eastern
   subspecies, O. lignaria lignaria Say, in eastern orchards has not
   previously been reported. This study evaluated the nesting activity and
   pollen preference of a population of the eastern subspecies in five
   orchards in the foothills and piedmont regions of North Carolina and
   Virginia over a 2-yr period. Apple was present in all orchards and all
   were bordered by hardwood forest. Shelters were placed both within
   orchards and the forest border. Emergence dates, nest construction, and
   orchard bloom were monitored weekly. Bee populations increased by 2-3
   times annually at most orchards. Pollen species comprising nest
   provisions from 720 individual nest cells were identified and quantified
   using scanning electron microscopy. The greatest amount of pollen
   (46-82\%) was that of a small understory tree, Eastern redbud (Cercis
   canadensis L.), at all orchard sites where these trees were present
   nearby. The quantity of orchard pollen was relatively low, <20\% at full
   apple bloom, except for one orchard (53\%) without nearby redbud. O.
   lignaria lignaria appears to prefer Eastern redbud pollen over orchard
   pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali bees, Nomia melanderi Cockerell, are solitary, gregarious,
   soil-nesting bees native to the western United States that are
   commercially managed in the Walla Walla Valley of Washington State to
   provide pollination service on alfalfa, Medicago sativa L., produced as
   a seed crop. In 2010 and 2011, we compared two techniques for estimating
   N. melanderi abundance in commercially managed bee beds. The first
   technique involved quantifying the abundance of emergence holes in 24
   0.5-m(2) quadrats on the surface of 13 bee beds during the peak period
   of N. melanderi foraging activity in July of both years. When we counted
   emergence holes, we marked a subset of eight quadrats per bee bed with
   plastic tabs. Subsequently, in late October of the same year, 0.014-m(3)
   soil cores were collected in close proximity to the plastic tabs. The
   soil cores were teased apart in the laboratory and the absolute
   abundance of overwintering prepupae was quantified per core. Simple
   regression was highly significant between the means of emergence holes
   within the 0.5-m(2) soil surface quadrats and the means of the counts
   from the 0.014-m(3) soil cores. Using mean emergence hole counts, mean
   prepupae counts from the soil cores, and the surface area of the bee
   beds, we were able to calculate the estimated abundance of N. melanderi
   in each bee bed. We conclude that the nondestructive quadrat method of
   sampling N. melanderi abundance in commercially managed beds is robust

Abstract = {{Prevalence and floral host plant range of indigenous Bombus pollinators

   Commercial enclosed farming has increased the use of the bumblebees as
   economically important pollinators for high economic return and

   important to rear and use for such pollination services than imported
   bumblebees to avoid possible environmental and pest problems. Bombus
   haemorrhoidalis Smith, the only bumblebee species of this region, was
   collected at monthly interval from different non-agricultural and
   agricultural flora of Margalla and Murree hills of Pakistan during
   2011-12. Plant species for floral host plant resources, variation in
   seasonal population and distribution with different climatic regions of
   this indigenous bumblebee were observed. Twenty four plant species of
   thirteen plant families were found as floral host plants visited for
   nectar and pollens with seven new localities ranging from 542-1986 m
   altitude. The most commonly visited plant family was Asteraceae.
   Reproductive stages including males and daughter queens were observed
   from October to December. Prevalence of queen, workers and males differ
   from parks to forests with altitude. Workers were observed active in
   early and late day hours to avoid harsh climate of June to August.
   Present study provides the possible available floral host plants,
   variation in its availability of different life stages and possible
   distribution for future utilization in possible alternate pollinator
   rearing programs. It also focuses on the ecological and biological

Abstract = {{1. Colour patterns on flowers can increase pollinator visitation and
   enhance foraging behaviour. Flowers uniform in colour to humans,
   however, can appear patterned to insects due to spatial variation in UV
   reflectance on petals. A UV `bullseye' pattern that is common among
   angiosperms - UV-absorbing petal bases and UV-reflective apices -
   purportedly functions as a nectar guide, enhancing pollinator
   orientation and experimental evidence suggests that UV reflectance
   increases floral apparency to pollinators.
   2. We test the pollinator-attracting and pollinator-orienting functions
   of floral UV pattern and UV reflectance under natural conditions.
   Specifically, we address whether UV reflection alone, or UV pattern
   influences small bee and syrphid fly attraction rates (approaching,
   landing and foraging visits), foraging rates, and likelihood of foraging
   and orienting to the centre of flowers, using Argentina anserina, a
   species whose flowers exhibit variability in the size of the UV
   bullseye. We manipulated UV properties while maintaining uniformly
   yellow petals to create three phenotypes - uniformly UV-absorptive,
   uniformly UV-reflective, and inversed bullseye (reflective bases and
   absorptive apices) and compared insect visitation and behaviour to
   control flowers with the common UV bullseye phenotype.
   3. The presence of UV pattern increased attraction rates by both bees
   and syrphid flies relative to either fully UV reflective or absorptive
   flowers. However, only in the inverse array did the bullseye phenotype
   elicit higher foraging rates than the test flower. Neither the presence
   of pattern, nor the reversal of the common pattern influenced the
   likelihood of pollinator foraging or orientating to the flowers' centre
   during a visit.
   4. We provide some of the first evidence to suggest that flowers with
   spatial variation in UV reflectance may be more conspicuous to insects
   than those with petals that uniformly absorb or reflect UV, all of which
   are naturally occurring phenotypes. Further, we verify that the most
   common UV pattern in nature increases insect attraction and foraging
   rate relative to the inverse pattern. Results confirm a distance
   apparency function of the UV bullseye, but we argue for reconsideration
   of the notion that pollinators benefit from this ubiquitous floral motif
   through enhanced foraging efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Recent anthropogenic climate change is strongly associated with average
   shifts toward earlier seasonal timing of activity (phenology) in
   temperate-zone species. Shifts in phenology have the potential to alter
   ecological interactions, to the detriment of one or more interacting
   species. Recent models predict that detrimental phenological mismatch
   may increasingly occur between plants and their pollinators. One way to
   test this prediction is to examine data from ecological communities that
   experience large annual weather fluctuations. Taking this approach, we
   analyzed interactions over a four-year period among 132 plant species
   and 665 pollinating insect species within a Mediterranean community. For
   each plant species we recorded onset and duration of flowering and
   number of pollinator species. Flowering onset varied among years, and a
   year of earlier flowering of a species tended to be a year of fewer
   species pollinating its flowers. This relationship was attributable
   principally to early-flowering species, suggesting that shifts toward
   earlier phenology driven by climate change may reduce pollination
   services due to phenological mismatch. Earlier flowering onset of a
   species also was associated with prolonged flowering duration, but it is
   not certain that this will counterbalance any negative effects of lower
   pollinator species richness on plant reproductive success. Among plants
   with different life histories, annuals were more severely affected by
   flowering pollinator mismatches than perennials. Specialized plant
   species (those attracting a smaller number of pollinator species) did
   not experience disproportionate interannual fluctuations in phenology.
   Thus they do not appear to be faced with disproportionate fluctuations
   in pollinator species richness, contrary to the expectation that
   specialists are at greatest risk of losing mutualistic interactions
   because of climate change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{When examining how the ecosystems of remote islands have developed, it
   is important to know the timing of when various elements arrived and
   whether they then diversified. Our understanding of the histories behind
   the biodiverse south west Pacific (SWP) archipelagos is limited, and
   further impeded by the complex geological histories of this region.
   Previous studies of the SWP short-tongued halictine bee fauna suggest
   their presence is much younger than the geological ages of these
   archipelagos, which is surprising given their critical role as
   pollinators in other terrestrial ecosystems. The long-tongued megachilid
   bees represent a considerable proportion of the known bee species for
   the region, yet little is known of their origin. Here we use genetic
   diversity within mitochondrial DNA to infer the likely ages and origins
   of megachilid species from Vanuatu, Fiji, and Samoa. Our results
   indicate a very recent origin for megachilids in the SWP, with many
   species exhibiting small intraspecific genetic distances. Three species
   share almost identical haplotypes with specimens from Southeast Asia,
   suggesting multiple human-aided introductions. Combined with data from
   recent studies on other bee groups present in the region, our results
   have broad implications for how the Pacific island biota developed and
   how we should approach its management.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in bee fauna, such as the disappearance of certain species or
   increasing abundance of others, are very important. The common belief
   that pollinating insects are facing problems also prompts detailed
   studies of the bee fauna in order to track on-going changes. Assessment
   of the state of bee communities in particular ecosystems or ecosystem
   complexes within a landscape, tracing the course of trends in fauna and
   also predicting their future structures resulting from current changes,
   are only possible if sampling is carried out at an appropriate
   frequency, so that representative materials are obtained. The aim of the
   present study was to determine what sampling intensity during the
   growing season would enable the collection of representative materials
   to evaluate species diversity of bees in a study area. Repeated bee
   sampling at monthly intervals throughout the period of activity of bees
   resulted in the identification of 73 bee species, corresponding to 51.4
   \% of the estimated number of bee species in the study area. When
   samples were obtained twice a month, 93 bee species were captured,
   accounting for 65.5 \% of the estimated number of bee species. When
   sampling took place nearly four times a month, 108 bee species were
   captured, making up 76 \% of the estimated number of bee species; the

Abstract = {{Many insects, including some bees, have extensive subcontinental
   distributions that can differ in climatic conditions. Within and beyond
   these distributions, humans intentionally transport beneficial insects,
   including bees, to non-natal geographic locations. Insects also are
   experiencing unprecedented climatic change in their resident localities.
   For solitary bees, we know very little about the adaptive plasticity and
   geographic variation in developmental physiology that accommodates the
   different climates experienced within distributional ranges. Osmia
   lignaria Say (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a widely distributed North
   American spring-emerging bee being developed as a managed pollinator for
   tree fruit crops, including almonds. We examined the development and
   survival of O. lignaria progeny that were descended from populations
   sourced from southern California, western Washington, and northern Utah,
   and then were reared together under an hourly and weekly temperature
   regime simulating those of a California almond-growing region. We found
   that developmental physiologies of Washington and Utah progeny were
   generally similar. However, California progeny developed slower, were
   more metabolically active, and survived better under California
   conditions than did populations native to regions at higher latitudes.
   Regardless of geographic origin, cocooned adults managed under
   prescribed thermal regimes emerged faster and lived longer after
   wintering. Progeny of parents from different regions exhibited some
   acclimatory plasticity in developmental phenologies to a novel climatic
   regime, but overall their responses reflected their geographic origins.
   This outcome is consistent with their developmental phenologies being
   largely heritable adaptations to regional climates. (C) Published by

   determine the critical rainfall periods for rain-fed fig production and
   supplementary irrigation water application. Further, economic analysis
   for rain-fed fig production was considered in this region to control the

Abstract = {{Flowers that are pollinated both during the day and at night could

   its diurnal and nocturnal pollinators. We measured frequency of flower
   visitors, analyzed floral scents, measured nectar production and sugar
   concentration, and performed pollination exclusion experiments. Bees
   were the main visitors at daytime and hawkmoths at nighttime. Diurnal
   scents were dominated by several compounds that can attract a wide range
   of pollinators, whereas nocturnal scents were less diverse and were
   dominated by (E)-nerolidol, a compound eliciting antennal responses in
   hawkmoths. Nectar volume and sugar concentration at night were similar
   to those recorded in hawkmoth-pollinated flowers. Daytime nectar volume
   was higher than those commonly found in bee-pollinated flowers, but
   similar to those found in flowers pollinated by several pollinators.
   Daytime sugar concentration was similar to those recorded in
   bee-pollinated flowers. Flowers of E. chiloensis ssp. chiloensis seem
   morphologically adapted to hawkmoth pollination, but diurnal and

Abstract = {{In response to global declines in bee populations, several studies have
   focused on floral resource provisioning schemes to support bee
   communities and maintain their pollination services. Optimizing
   host-plant selection for supplemental floral provisioning requires an
   understanding of bee foraging behavior and preferences for host-plant
   species. However, fully characterizing these preferences is challenging
   due to multiple factors influencing foraging, including the large degree
   of spatiotemporal variability in floral resources. To understand bee
   pollen foraging patterns, we developed a highly controlled mechanistic
   framework to measure pollen foraging preferences of the bumble bee
   Bombus impatiens to nine plant species native to Pennsylvania. We
   recorded continuous observations of foraging behavior of the
   experimental bee community and individual bees, while simultaneously
   standardizing for the number of foragers in the environment and
   differences in floral display of each plant species, while controlling
   for flowering phenology such that bees only foraged when all plant
   species' flowers were open. Our results demonstrate that B. impatiens
   exhibit predictable daily patterns in their pollen foraging choices, and
   their preferences are dominated by the host-plants they visit first. We
   hypothesize that these patterns at the community and individual levels
   are driven by the interplay between pollen abundance and quality. We
   recommend that daily cycles of host-plant visitation be considered in
   future studies to ensure precise and accurate interpretations of
   host-plant preference. Such precision is critical for comprehensive
   analyses of the proximate and ultimate mechanisms driving bee foraging
   behavior and the selection of host-plant species to use in habitat
   restoration protocols.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Pollination services are at risk from land use change and
   intensification, but responses of individual pollinator species are
   often variable, making it difficult to detect and understand
   community-level impacts on pollination. We investigated changes in
   community composition and functional diversity of insect pollinator
   communities under land use change in a highly modified landscape.
   Location Canterbury region, South Island, New Zealand.
   Methods We trapped insect pollinators every month for 1 year at 24 sites
   across four land use types of increasing intensity in New Zealand:
   gardens with native vegetation, blackcurrant orchards, dairy farms, and
   rotational cropping farms. We investigated changes in pollinator species
   and functional richness and differences in species and functional
   composition.
   Results Under increasing land use intensity, both species and functional
   richness declined markedly. Changes in functional richness, however,
   were overall not significantly different than expected based on the
   observed declines in species richness. Nevertheless, there was a
   significant trend towards greater than expected functional richness
   within less-intensive land use types and lower than expected functional
   richness within intensive land use types. The order of species loss
   under increasing land use intensity was non-random, as pollinators with
   a narrow diet breadth, large body size, solitary behaviour and a
   preference for non-floral larval food resources were lost first.
   Main conclusions Our study shows that pollinator species bearing
   particular trait attributes are susceptible to differences in land use.
   Our study suggests that pollination services may be more vulnerable to
   environmental changes and disturbances in more intensive land use types
   as a result of lower pollinator functional richness.}},

Abstract = {{Megachile rotundata (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is the primary
   pollinator of alfalfa in the northwestern United States and western
   Canada and provides pollination services for onion, carrot, hybrid
   canola, various legumes, and other specialty crops. M. rotundata females
   are gregarious, nest in cavities either naturally occurring or in
   artificial nesting blocks, where they construct a linear series of brood
   cells. Because of the physical layout of the nest, the age of the larvae
   within the nest and the microenvironment the individual larvae
   experience will vary. These interacting factors along with other
   maternal inputs affect the resulting phenotypes of the nest mates. To
   further our understanding of in-nest physiology, gender and
   developmental rates were examined in relationship to cell position
   within the nest. Eighty-two percent of the females were located within
   the first three cells, those furthest from the nest entrance. For those
   individuals developing in cells located in the deepest half of the nest,
   the sex of the previous bee had a significant effect on the female
   decision of the gender of the following nest mate. Removing the prepupae
   from the nest and rearing them under identical conditions demonstrated
   that position within the nest during larval development had a
   significant effect on the postdiapause developmental rates, with males
   whose larval development occurred deeper in the nest developing more
   slowly than those toward the entrance. No positional effect on
   postdiapause developmental rates was noted for the females. The cell
   position effect on male postdiapause developmental rate demonstrates
   that postdiapause development is not a rigid physiological mechanism
   uniform in all individuals, but is a dynamic plastic process shaped by
   past environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination services from wild insects contribute to crop
   productivity around the world, but are at risk of decline in
   agricultural landscapes. Using highbush blueberry as a model system, we
   tested whether wildflower plantings established adjacent to crop fields
   would increase the abundance of wild pollinators during crop bloom and
   enhance pollination and yield.
   2. Plantings were seeded in 2009 with a mix of 15 perennial wildflower
   species that provided season-long bloom and increased plant density and
   floral area during the subsequent
   3 years. 3. Honeybees visiting blueberry flowers had similar abundance
   in enhanced and control fields in all 4 years of this study, whereas
   wild bee and syrphid abundance increased annually in the fields adjacent
   to wildflower plantings.
   4. Crop pollination parameters including percentage fruit set, berry
   weight and mature seeds per berry were significantly greater in fields
   adjacent to wildflower plantings 3 and 4 years after seeding, leading to
   higher crop yields and with the associated revenue exceeding the cost of
   wildflower establishment and maintenance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We suggest that provision of forage
   habitat for bees adjacent to pollinator-dependent crops can conserve
   wild pollinators in otherwise resource-poor agricultural landscapes.
   Over time, these plantings can support higher crop yields and bring a
   return on the initial investment in wildflower seed and planting
   establishment, also insuring against loss of managed pollinators.
   Further understanding of the importance of planting size, location and
   landscape context will be required to effectively implement this
   practice to support crop pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory defence chemicals in plants can affect higher trophic levels

   species from Europe and South America) accumulate toxic quinolizidine
   alkaloids in vegetative tissues, conferring resistance to herbivorous
   pests such as aphids. We identified the alkaloid lupanine and its

   ecologically-relevant concentrations to queenless microcolonies of
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) in their pollen to determine how foraging
   on these crops may impact bee colony health and fitness. Fewer males

   they were significantly smaller than controls. This impact on males was
   not linked to preference as workers willingly fed lupanine-treated
   pollen to larvae, even though it was deleterious to colony health.
   Agricultural systems comprising large monocultures of crops bred for

Abstract = {{Sown wildflower strips are increasingly being established in Europe for

   Floral resources were provided in four experimental levels characterised
   by a cumulatively increasing flower trait diversity and vegetation stand
   complexity. The first level consisted of a bare control strip, whilst in
   each subsequent level three wildflower species with different functional
   traits were added (Level 0: control; Level 1: three Apiaceae species;
   Level 2: three Apiaceae and three Fabaceae species; Level 3: three
   Apiaceae, three Fabaceae species, and Centaurea jacea (Asteraceae),
   Fagopyrum esculentum (Polygonaceae), Sinapis alba (Brassicaceae)). Plots

   experimental plots of organically-managed tomato crop, which is attacked

   services. Results obtained here show that the inclusion of functionally
   diverse wildflower species was associated with an augmented availability
   of floral resources across time, and this increased the abundance of
   bees and anthocorids throughout the crop season. Several natural enemy

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchids employ floral volatiles to sexually lure
   their specific pollinators. How and why this pollination system has
   evolved independently on multiple continents remains unknown, although
   preadaptation is considered to have been important. Understanding the
   chemistry of sexual deception is a crucial first step towards solving
   this mystery.
   The combination of gas chromatography-electroantennographic detection
   (GC-EAD), GC-MS, synthesis and field bioassays allowed us to identify
   the volatiles involved in the interaction between the orchid Drakaea
   glyptodon and its sexually attracted male thynnine wasp pollinator,
   Zaspilothynnus trilobatus.
   Three alkylpyrazines and one novel hydroxymethyl pyrazine were
   identified as the sex pheromone of Z. trilobatus and are also used by D.
   glyptodon for pollinator attraction. Given that our findings revealed a
   new chemical system for plants, we surveyed widely across representative
   orchid taxa for the presence of these compounds. With one exception, our
   chemical survey failed to detect pyrazines in related genera.
   Collectively, no evidence for preadaptation was found.
   The chemistry of sexual deception is more diverse than previously known.
   Our results suggest that evolutionary novelty may have played a key role

Abstract = {{Pollinating insect populations, essential for maintaining wild plant
   diversity and agricultural productivity, rely on (semi) natural
   habitats. An increasing human population is encroaching upon and
   deteriorating pollinator habitats. Thus the population persistence of
   pollinating insects and their associated ecosystem services may depend
   upon on man-made novel habitats; however, their importance for ecosystem
   services is barely understood. We tested if man-made infrastructure
   (railway embankments) in an agricultural landscape establishes novel
   habitats that support large populations of pollinators (bees,
   butterflies, hoverflies) when compared to typical habitats for these
   insects, i. e., semi-natural grasslands. We also identified key
   environmental factors affecting the species richness and abundance of
   pollinators on embankments. Species richness and abundance of bees and
   butterflies were higher for railway embankments than for grasslands. The
   occurrence of bare (non-vegetated) ground on embankments positively
   affected bee species richness and abundance, but negatively affected
   butterfly populations. Species richness and abundance of butterflies
   positively depended on species richness of native plants on embankments,
   whereas bee species richness was positively affected by species richness
   of nonnative flowering plants. The density of shrubs on embankments
   negatively affected the number of bee species and their abundance. Bee
   and hoverfly species richness were positively related to wood cover in a
   landscape surrounding embankments. This is the first study showing that
   railway embankments constitute valuable habitat for the conservation of

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding in plants typically reduces individual fitness but may also
   alter ecological interactions. This study examined the effect of
   inbreeding in the mixed-mating annual Mimulus guttatus on visitation by
   pollinators (Bombus impatiens) in greenhouse experiments. Previous
   studies of M. guttatus have shown that inbreeding reduced corolla size,
   flower number, and pollen quantity and quality. Using controlled
   crosses, we produced inbred and outbred families from three different M.
   guttatus populations. We recorded the plant genotypes that bees visited
   and the number of flowers probed per visit. In our first experiment,
   bees were 31\% more likely to visit outbred plants than those selfed for
   one generation and 43\% more likely to visit outbred plants than those
   selfed for two generations. Inbreeding had only a small effect on the
   number of flowers probed once bees arrived at a genotype. These
   differences were explained partially by differences in mean floral
   display and mean flower size, but even when these variables were
   controlled statistically, the effect of inbreeding remained large and
   significant. In a second experiment we quantified pollen viability from
   inbred and self plants. Bees were 37-54\% more likely to visit outbred
   plants, depending on the population, even when controlling for floral
   display size. Pollen viability proved to be as important as floral
   display in predicting pollinator visitation in one population, but the
   overall explanatory power of a multiple regression model was weak. Our
   data suggested that bees use cues in addition to display size, flower
   size, and pollen reward quality in their discrimination of inbred
   plants. Discrimination against inbred plants could have effects on plant
   fitness and thereby reinforce selection for outcrossing. Inbreeding in
   plant populations could also reduce resource quality for pollinators,
   potentially resulting in negative effects on pollinator populations.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to use melissopalynology to delineate the
   foraging preferences of bees in tropical environs. This was done by
   comparing pollen spectra obtained from the same hives every three months
   for three years at four sampling locations (in two sites) within a
   confined landscape mosaic. If melissopalynology is highly replicable,
   the spatial variation of the pollen spectrum from the honey samples
   would be much more than the temporal (inter-annual) variations. In other
   words, given the three factors, Month, Year and Location, honey pollen
   from different Locations, in a given Year and Month, would be much less
   similar than samples from different Years, in a given Location and
   Month. We then determined how the factors, Month, Year and Location,

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are important pollinators for wild flowers and agricultural
   crops. North China is a region of varied geomorphology and vegetation,
   with plateaus, plains, mountains and deserts, and is part of the
   greatest hotspot of bumblebee diversity worldwide. We report on a field
   survey of the bumblebees of North China made between 2005-2012. A sample
   of 21,636 bumblebee specimens are assigned to 76 species. One older
   specimen held in London added one more species to this list. Together,
   these 77 species represent 10 subgenera of the genus Bombus. Seven
   species are recorded from North China for the first time: B. (St.)
   distinguendus, B. (Th.) anachoreta, B. (Th.) pseudobaicalensis, B. (Th.)
   exil, B. (Ps.) campestris, B. (Pr.) infirmus and B. (Ag.) validus. We
   provide identification keys for both males and females, photographs of
   the common colour patterns, and distribution maps for all species. We
   describe variation in local species richness and abundance, and list the
   food plants used by bumblebees in North China. The most abundant 10
   bumblebee species are: B. (Ml.) pyrosoma, B. (Bo.) lantschouensis, B.
   (Bo.) patagiatus, B. (St.) melanurus, B. (Sb.) sibiricus, B. (Bo.)
   ignitus, B. (Th.) hedini, B. (Pr.) picipes, B. (Mg.) trifasciatus and B.
   (Mg.) longipes. Bumblebees are distributed widely within North China,
   from low elevations near the edge of the North-China plain to high
   elevations at the edge of the east Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (65 4011 m).
   The highest species richness is found in meadows of the high elevation
   east Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and in forests of the Qilianshan mountains
   in southwestern Gansu. The 337 food plant species recorded here belong
   to 49 families, showing that bumblebees play an important role in
   interconnecting agricultural and natural ecosystems in North China.}},

Volume = {{352}},

Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are among the best known and ubiquitous
   plant-animal mutualisms and are crucial for ecosystem functioning and
   the maintenance of biodiversity. Most pollinators are insects with
   several life-stages (e.g. egg, larva, pupa, adult) and the mutualistic
   interaction depends on the pollinator surviving these different
   life-stages. However, to our knowledge, pollinator population structure
   has been ignored in most theoretical models of plant-pollinator
   dynamics, and we lack understanding of the role of different life-stages
   in determining the stability of the mutualism. Here we therefore develop
   a simple plant-pollinator model with a facultative plant and an obligate
   pollinator with stage-structure. Our model predicts a globally stable
   equilibrium when pollinator demography is dominated by adults and a
   locally stable equilibrium when the plants are strongly dependent on
   pollination and pollinator demography is dominated by the larval stage.
   In the latter case, the mutualism is vulnerable to fluctuations in the
   pollinator population size or structure caused by external factors (e.g.
   pesticides) reducing larval development and increasing adult mortality.
   This may cause a sudden collapse rather than gradual decrease of the
   mutualism, after which the pollination service cannot be recovered by
   reducing these detrimental external factors, but must be accompanied by
   large increases in pollinator populations. This highlights the
   importance of considering population structure in plant-pollinator
   interactions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the beginning of honey production, certain honey types have been
   favored because they taste better, are better for cooking or do not
   rapidly crystallize. Thus, they are preferred over others, are in high
   demand and are sold at higher prices. The pollen of 37 honey samples
   from East Texas was examined. Pollen was recovered from the honey by
   using an alcohol-dilution method. Overall, 431 taxa identified into 61
   families, 104 genera and 85 species were found in the samples. The
   number of taxa per sample varied from 17-52. Half of the samples
   contained 31-40 taxa, indicating a high diversity in botanical origin.
   Three taxa were found in >50\% of the samples and are the most
   important: Berchemia scandens, Salix nigra and Toxicodendron radicans.
   Berchemia scandens was found in 89\% of the samples and was a
   predominant type in three samples and an important secondary type in 14.
   Both Salix nigra and Toxicodendron radicans pollen occurred in 83\% of
   the samples and neither occurred as a predominant or secondary type.
   Three samples were Berchemia scandens unifloral honey. By examining the
   pollen in honey, it can determined which habitats honeybees visit, which
   plants honeybees use as food, if they visit row crops and orchards and
   their role in pollination. In order to differentiate honey from the
   United States of America (USA) from honey produced in other countries,
   the honey from each state must be analyzed. Only by analyzing the pollen
   in the honey of the USA can it be reliably differentiated from foreign
   honey that is being sold as produced in the USA.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen viability ranges substantially among and within plant species,

   has not been studied. To test this, we created a greenhouse population
   of Mimulus guttatus plants that ranged in pollen viability from 17\% to
   98.5\% and related both pollen quantity and pollen protein content to
   pollen viability. We found that crude protein concentration ranged from
   15\% to 45\% and was positively associated with pollen viability. We
   also found that pollen mass per flower ranged 5-fold, also positively
   related to pollen viability. Across experimental plants, there was an
   11-fold difference in protein mass per flower between plants of the
   lowest and highest pollen viabilities. We conclude that conditions that

   development, may greatly reduce the awards available to plant

Abstract = {{High-elevation rock outcrop ecosystems are home to a unique flora, with
   endemic and disjunct species hypothesized to be susceptible to shifts in
   species composition or phenology with climate warming. Easily accessed
   outcrops also are susceptible to human disturbance. We surveyed
   vegetation, flowering plant species, and insect pollinators on seven
   outcrops that range from relatively inaccessible to frequently visited
   to determine if: (1) vegetation composition or abundance correlates with
   accessibility; (2) establish baseline information on species composition
   and abundance; and (3) determine if specialized plant-pollinator
   interactions indicate susceptibility to shifts in flowering time.
   Richness of plant cover was not related to outcrop accessibility;
   however, the least accessible outcrop had the lowest frequency of bare
   rock, relatively high lichen cover, and vegetation patches with a
   distinct flora of spikemoss (Selaginella sp.), mosses, lichens, and
   vascular plants. Bare rock was most abundant on the most accessible
   outcrop. Almost half of obligate outcrop plant species within sampled
   vegetation occurred on only one or two of the seven outcrops. Each
   outcrop had a unique subset of species in flower at each sampling time.
   Flowering plants were visited, on average, by five different insect
   morpho-species and families. Each insect morpho-species visited at least
   two plant species; bumblebees (Bombus) and sweatbees (Halictidae)
   visited as many as eight plant species. Generalist interactions suggest
   lower susceptibility to temporal mismatches between plants and
   pollinators with climate warming; however, individual outcrops do not
   harbor the full suite of specialized and sensitive plant species, and
   conservation efforts should focus on retaining outcrop plant
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{The rocky shoals spider-lily (Hymenocallis coronaria (J. Le Conte) Kunth

   the Fall Line in scattered populations in Alabama, Georgia, and South

   pollination ecology of this plant has not been fully explored.
   Sphingophily (Lepidoptera) (hawkmoth) pollination has been suggested as

   blooming season (May - June 2011 and 2012) we made numerous observations
   and documented potential pollinators/insect visitors of H. coronaria
   with camera equipment at various times of the day and night. We recorded
   623 total flower visits during the 96 hours of camera and observation
   time. Of the nineteen species of flower visitors documented, Apidae:
   Bombus spp. (Bumblebees), Hesperiidae: Epargyreus clarus Cramer (Silver
   spotted skipper), Papilionidae: Papilio glaucus Linnaeus (Tiger
   swallowtail), and Battus philenor Linnaeus (Pipevine swallowtail) were
   the most common visitors, comprising over 80\% of the visitations. Using
   a Chi-square test we determined that insects were attracted to different
   parts of the flower bloom (P < 0.01). The majority of flower visitors
   were observed during the morning and midday hours (P = 0.01). Our
   results indicate that numerous insect species may act as potential

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{933-944}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators often sequentially visit 1 flower type while bypassing other
   equally rewarding flower types, behavior known as flower constancy. One
   explanation for flower constancy is that pollinators use the search
   image of a specific flower type to efficiently find flowers because they
   are often cryptic. The so-called search image hypothesis predicts that
   temporal specialization to 1 flower type by an individual pollinator
   declines as flower conspicuousness increases because if flowers are
   conspicuous, pollinators can divide their attention among different
   flower types. To test this prediction, we investigated visitation
   sequences of individual bumble bees (Bombus ignitus) to a patch of blue
   and yellow artificial flowers. We used different flower sizes and
   interflower distances as independent determinants of flower visual size
   and noisiness of the background and, thus, of flower crypsis. Flower
   color selectivity and flower search time decreased and subsequently
   increased with visual size of the nearest flowers, with a minimum of
   approximately 15 degrees of the visual angle. Within-bout constancy,
   measured as the tendency of flying to the same flower types in
   succession compared with the expectation of a given flower selectivity
   within a bout, increased with visual size of the nearest flowers. Flower
   selectivity and within-bout constancy did not differ among arrays that
   shared the same floral visual angle, indicating that visual size, rather
   than flight distance or flower size itself, had a substantial effect on
   flower choices. Our results suggest that flower visual size and
   background noisiness affect flower crypsis and constancy, providing
   support for the search image hypothesis.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Gynodioecy is a dimorphic breeding system in which female individuals
   coexist with hermaphroditic individuals in the same population. Females
   only contribute to the next generation via ovules, and many studies have
   shown that they are usually less attractive than hermaphrodites to
   pollinators. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how
   females manage to persist in populations despite these disadvantages.
   The `resource reallocation hypothesis' (RRH) states that females channel
   resources not invested in pollen production and floral advertisement
   towards the production of more and/or larger seeds. We investigated
   pollination patterns and tested the RRH in a population of Thymus
   vulgaris. We measured flower display, flower size, nectar production,
   visitation rates, pollinator constancy and flower lifespan in the two
   morphs. In addition, we measured experimentally the effects of pollen
   and resource addition on female reproductive success (fruit set, seed
   set, seed weight) of the two morphs. Despite lower investment in floral
   advertisement, female individuals were no less attractive to pollinators
   than hermaphrodites on a per flower basis. Other measures of pollinator
   behaviour (number of flowers visited per plant, morph preference and
   morph constancy) also showed that pollinators did not discriminate
   against female flowers. In addition, stigma receptivity was longer in
   female flowers. Accordingly, and contrary to most studies on
   gynodioecious species, reproductive success of females was not pollen
   limited. Instead, seed production was pollen limited in hermaphrodites,
   suggesting low levels of cross-pollination in hermaphrodites. Seed
   production was resource limited in hermaphrodites, but not in females,
   thus providing support for the RRH. (C) 2014 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{Megachile rotundata, the alfalfa leafcutting bee, is a solitary,
   cavity-nesting bee. M. rotundata develop from eggs laid inside brood
   cells constructed from leaf pieces and placed in series in an existing
   cavity. Due to the cavity nesting behavior of M. rotundata, developing
   bees may experience hypoxic conditions. The brood cell itself and the
   position of cell inside the cavity may impact the rates of oxygen
   diffusion creating hypoxic conditions for developing animals. We
   hypothesized that bees would be adapted to living in hypoxia and
   predicted that they would be highly tolerant of hypoxic conditions. To
   test the hypothesis, we measured critical PO2 (P-crit) in pupal M.
   rotundata of varying ages. Defined as the atmospheric O-2 level below
   which metabolic rate cannot be sustained, P-crit is a measure of an
   animal's respiratory capacity. Using flow through respirometry, we
   measured CO2 emission rates of developing bees exposed to 21, 10, 6, 5,
   4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 kPa PO2 and statistically determined P-crit. Mean
   P-crit was 4 Kpa PO2 and ranged from 0 to 10 kPa PO2, similar to those
   of other insects. P-crit was positively correlated with age, indicating
   that as pupae aged, they were less tolerant of hypoxia. To determine if
   there were developmental changes in tracheal structure that accounted
   for the increase in P-crit, we used synchrotron X-ray imaging and
   measured the diameter of several tracheae in the head and abdomen of
   developing bees. Analyses of tracheal diameters showed that tracheae
   increased in size as animals aged, but the magnitude of the increase
   varied depending on which trachea was measured. Tracheal diameters
   increased as pupae molted and decreased as they neared adult emergence,
   possibly accounting for the decrease in hypoxia tolerance. Little is
   known about respiratory structures during metamorphosis in bees, and
   this study provides the first description of tracheal system structure
   and function in developing M. rotundata. Studies such as this are
   important for understanding how basic physiological parameters change
   throughout development and will help to maintain healthy pollinator
   populations. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   into a watery glucose solution in increasing densities and their effect
   on the proportion of bumblebees displaying the PER after antennal

   trial, the proportion of bumblebees that accepted the watery glucose
   solution was negatively correlated with the bacterial density. Nearly
   half of the bacteria tested evoked avoidance at naturally occurring
   densities. Our results suggest that bacteria colonizing flowers have the
   potential to negatively affect the reproduction of plants via reduced

Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{The orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus (Insecta: Mantodea) is a deceptive
   predator that attracts pollinators as prey. Their resemblance to a
   flower has given rise to the hypothesis that they are flower mimics.
   However, floral mimicry as a predatory strategy, and in particular, how
   predatory floral mimicry functions at a mechanistic level is poorly
   understood. Two main morphological characteristics are thought to make
   orchid mantises appear similar to flowers and thus attractive to
   pollinators: (1) their flower-like' white colouration and (2) their
   petal-shaped' expansions of exoskeleton on their mid-femur and hind
   femur (femoral lobes). I investigated the contribution of these colour
   and shape characteristics to pollinator attraction using artificial
   orchid mantis models. Models with the flower-like' white colouration of
   the orchid mantis had higher rates of pollinator inspection than brown
   models. Manipulating overall body shape by removing or changing the
   orientation of the petal-shaped' femoral lobes did not affect the
   attractiveness of models. As certain flower-like characteristics
   (symmetry and petals) did not affect the attractiveness of models,
   pollinators may not necessarily cognitively misclassify orchid mantises
   as flowers. Rather, mantises may be exploiting sensory biases of their
   pollinator prey, and their UV-absorbing white colouration may be
   sufficient to lure pollinators. The effectiveness of using artificial
   models established here provides a basis for future research into orchid
   mantis morphology and the fine-scale interactions between orchid
   mantises and pollinators.}},

   xanthotricha, 12 species-specific microsatellite loci were analyzed in
   42 colonies sampled throughout the species range. The results indicated
   5 distinct clusters throughout the sampled area with high rates of
   genetic diversity, and the greatest diversity was found in southern
   Bahia. Greater differentiation was observed between samples from the
   extremes of the distribution, with an F-ST value of 0.189 between
   cluster 1 and 5. The genetic differentiation analysis for all loci had
   an F-ST value of 0.113, a result that is consistent with the analysis of
   molecular variance, which revealed 7.72\% of the variation occurring
   between groups. The Mantel correlation between a genetic differentiation
   matrix and a geographic distance matrix (r = 0.184, P = 0.043) indicated
   a tendency toward increased differentiation with increased distance.

Abstract = {{Nectar robbery is usually thought to impact negatively on the
   reproductive success of plants, but also neutral or even positive
   effects have been reported. Very few studies have investigated the
   effects of nectar robbing on the behaviour of legitimate pollinators so
   far. Such behavioural changes may lead to the reduction of geitonogamy
   or to increased pollen movement. We simulated nectar robbing in
   experimental sites as well as in natural populations of Aconitum
   napellus ssp. lusitanicum, a rare plant pollinated by long-tongued
   bumblebees. In an experimental setup, we removed the nectaries of 40 \%
   of the flowers, which is similar to rates of robbing observed in wild
   populations. Patches of plants with experimentally robbed flowers were
   compared with control patches containing plants with untreated flowers.
   We observed pollinator behaviour, mimicked male reproductive success
   (pollen dispersal) using fluorescent dye, and measured female
   reproductive success (seed set). The main legitimate visitors were
   bumblebees while honeybees were often observed robbing nectar. They did
   so by ``base working{''}, i.e. sliding between tepals. Bumblebees tended
   to visit fewer flowers per plant and spent less time per single flower
   when these had been experimentally robbed. This change in behaviour
   consequently increased the proportion of flowers visited by bumblebees
   in patches with robbed flowers. Fluorescent dye mimicking pollen flow
   was dispersed larger distances after pollinators had visited patches
   with robbed flowers compared to control patches. Average seed set per
   plant was not affected by nectar robbing. Our results demonstrated that
   A. napellus does not suffer from nectar robbery but may rather benefit
   via improved pollen dispersal and thus, male reproductive success.
   Knowledge on such combined effects of behavioural changes of pollinators
   due to nectar robbery is important to understand the evolutionary
   significance of exploiters of such mutualistic relationships between
   plants and their pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction networks between plants and their floral visitors are often
   studied with a plant-centered approach, and the results obtained with
   these data may generate incomplete conclusions on network topology.
   Thus, we propose to elucidate how biases associated with the approach to
   data collection can influence the topology of interaction networks by
   examining species richness, interactions, generalization levels, and
   nestedness in three interaction matrices: plant-centered,
   animal-centered, and their combination. The results of the combined data
   indicate an increase in connectance in relation to animal-centered
   networks and differences in the mean degree for plants and animals,
   showing the importance of complementary methods of collecting data to
   reduce the sampling biases of each isolated method. The nestedness level
   was most time significant and higher in the animal-centered networks.
   Our work shows that the apparently specialist behavior of some visitor
   species may be in part circumvented with the supplementation of
   plant-centered data with animal-centered data, thereby leading to a
   result closer to that expected by theory, which predicts a more

Abstract = {{The relationship between flowering phenology and abundance of bumble
   bees (Bombus spp.) was investigated using 2 years of phenological data
   collected in an alpine region of northern Japan. Abundance of Bombus
   species was observed along a fixed transect throughout the flowering
   season. The number of flowering species was closely related to the
   floral resources for pollinators at the community scale. In the year
   with typical weather, the first flowering peak corresponded to the
   emergence time of queen bees from hibernation, while the second
   flowering peak corresponded to the active period of worker bees. In the
   year with an unusually warm spring, however, phenological synchrony
   between plants and bees was disrupted. Estimated emergence of queen bees
   was 10 days earlier than the first flowering date owing to earlier soil
   thawing and warming. However, subsequent worker emergence was delayed,
   indicating slower colony development. The flowering season finished 2
   weeks earlier in the warm-spring year in response to earlier snowmelt. A
   common resident species in the alpine environment, B. hypocrita
   sapporoensis, flexibly responded to the yearly fluctuation of flowering.
   In contrast, population dynamics of other Bombus species were out of
   synchrony with the flowering: their frequencies were highest at the end
   of the flowering season in the warm-spring year. Therefore, phenological
   mismatch between flowers and pollinators is evident during warm years,
   which may become more prevalent in a warmer climate. To understand the
   mechanism of phenological mismatch in the pollination system of the
   alpine ecosystem, ground temperature, snowmelt regime, and life cycle of
   pollinators are key factors.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use changes have threatened populations of many insect pollinators,
   including bumble bees. Patterns of dispersal and gene flow are key
   determinants of species' ability to respond to land-use change, but have
   been little investigated at a fine scale (<10 km) in bumble bees. Using
   microsatellite markers, we determined the fine-scale spatial genetic
   structure of populations of four common Bombus species (B. terrestris,
   B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. hortorum) and one declining species
   (B. ruderatus) in an agricultural landscape in Southern England, UK. The
   study landscape contained sown flower patches representing
   agri-environment options for pollinators. We found that, as expected,
   the B. ruderatus population was characterized by relatively low
   heterozygosity, number of alleles and colony density. Across all
   species, inbreeding was absent or present but weak (F-IS = 0.01-0.02).
   Using queen genotypes reconstructed from worker sibships and colony
   locations estimated from the positions of workers within these sibships,
   we found that significant isolation by distance was absent in B.
   lapidarius, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus. In B. terrestris and B.
   pascuorum, it was present but weak; for example, in these two species,
   expected relatedness of queens founding colonies 1 m apart was 0.02.
   These results show that bumble bee populations exhibit low levels of
   spatial genetic structure at fine spatial scales, most likely because of
   ongoing gene flow via widespread queen dispersal. In addition, the
   results demonstrate the potential for agri-environment scheme
   conservation measures to facilitate fine-scale gene flow by creating a
   more even distribution of suitable habitats across landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Some rabbiteye blueberry cultivars (Vaccinium virgatum Aiton syn. ashei)

   severe enough, could cause sterility. Overcoming sterility and
   associated yield loss in `Premier' flowers was possible with two
   applications of an exogenous plant growth regulator (PGR), 250 ppm
   gibberellin-As (GA). Interestingly, the dual emulsifier and surfactant
   chosen for our GA dips, 0.5\% coconut oil soap, behaved like a PGR by
   inducing adventitious embyony, possibly apomixis. Resulting berries were
   20-25\% heavier and matured 7-14 days earlier. Fruit sets as high as
   80-90\% stemmed from the emulsion's GA ingredient. Yet, the heaviest
   seed-rich berries either resulted from cross-pollinated flowers or from
   unpollinated ones treated with GA/coconut oil soap emulsion (hereafter
   known as the emulsion). A second greenhouse experiment incorporated
   chemical dips containing four concentrations of coconut oil soap, five
   component fatty acids with medium length to long-chain aliphatic tails
   (C-10-C-18), and three new cultivars. Again, these replicated trials
   achieved similar results. GA stimulated high fruit set, while coconut
   oil soap plus its component long-chained fatty acids produced heavier
   faster growing berries for unpollinated blooms of `Austin', and

Abstract = {{The impacts of glacial cycles on the geographical distribution and size

   time to the LGM, followed by rapid expansion post-LGM. Our data
   therefore suggest that Pleistocene climate change has had major impacts

   widespread Holarctic effects of the LGM, our data suggest a much wider
   range of latitudes, extending to the tropics, where these climate change
   repercussions were important. As key pollinators, the inferred changes

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction and fragmentation accelerate pollinator decline,
   consequently disrupting ecosystem processes such as pollination. To
   date, the impacts of multilevel spatial structure on pollination
   services have rarely been addressed. We focused on the effects of
   population spatial structure on the pollination services of Comarum
   palustre at three levels (i.e. within-population, between-populations
   and landscape). For three years, we investigated 14 Belgian populations,
   which differed in their within-population flower density, population
   surface, closure (i.e. proportion of the population edge that consisted
   of woody elements) and isolation (i.e. percentage of woody area cover
   within a 500 m radius from the population centre). We tested whether
   these spatial characteristics impact on pollinator abundance and
   visitation rate and thus, reproductive success of C. palustre. Insects
   were observed in 15 randomly-chosen plots in each population. We tested
   for pollen limitation with supplemental hand-cross pollination. Bumble
   bees and solitary bees were the major pollinators through all
   populations. Within populations, plots with high flower densities
   attracted high numbers of bumble bees and other insects. High bumble bee
   and solitary bee abundance was observed in populations presenting high
   proportions of woody edges and in populations within landscapes
   presenting high proportions of woody areas. Seed set resulting from open
   pollination varied with bumble bee and solitary bee visitation rate,
   leading to increased pollen limitation when pollinators were scarce.
   Since the reproductive success depended on the visitation rate of the
   main pollinators, which depended on multilevel spatial structure,
   wetland management plans should pay special attention to favour a mosaic
   of biotopes, including nesting sites and food resources for insects.
   This study particularly supports the relevance of a mix wetlands and
   woody habitats to bees.}},

Abstract = {{Many temperate deciduous forests are recovering from past logging, but
   the effects of logging legacies and environmental gradients on forest
   insect pollinators have not been well studied. In this study, we asked
   how pollinator abundance and community composition varied with distance
   from logging roads and elevation in old (logged >90 years ago) and young
   (logged 20-40 years ago) southern Appalachian forests. Insect
   pollinators were sampled at 15 previously logged sites along an
   elevation gradient at 5 distances from logging roads during summer 2010
   and spring 2011 using pan traps. In summer, many pollinator groups were
   more abundant in younger forests and closer to logging roads, likely due
   in part to more light availability and a greater abundance of floral
   resources near roads. Total bee abundance was greater near logging
   roads, but only in younger forests, suggesting that the role of roads in
   providing nectar and other resources may diminish as forests mature. In
   spring, many pollinator families were less abundant at mid-distances
   (2-10 m) from roads compared to road edges (0 m), but abundances were
   generally the same at 100 in from the road as at road edges. Two
   important bee families. Apidae and Andrenidae, were strongly associated

Abstract = {{Among the diversity of pollination strategies, food deception is
   intriguing because of the lack of rewards offered for the pollination
   services. Floral food deception has been frequently recorded in orchids;
   however, there is little evidence for food deception outside the
   Orchidaceae. One putative non-orchid candidate is the Mediterranean Iris
   lutescens, which displays an heritable polymorphism for flower colour,
   with yellow and purple morphs. Colour polymorphism is frequently thought
   to be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection, where rare
   morphs are visited more frequently than common ones. Here, we present
   data on reproductive biology and pollination ecology of the species in
   the light of the deceptive pollination strategy and the maintenance of
   flower colour polymorphism. There was no difference in sex allocation
   and flowering phenology between morphs, with a blooming period early in
   spring. Both colour morphs are equally self-incompatible and they depend
   on insects for seed production. The most common visitors with pollen
   loads are small and large Apoids. These were observed foraging for
   non-existent nectar (rather than pollen) on Iris flowers. Most of them
   appear to learn to avoid Iris flowers as classically observed for
   rewardless species, and there was no evidence of an advantage for the
   rare morph. Instead, we found that in some populations, large bee
   pollinators appeared to prefer the most common morph (positive
   frequency-dependent selection). Iris lutescens appears to be a hitherto
   neglected but relevant candidate to investigate deceptive reproductive
   strategy and selective pressures in generalist plants.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies focusing on the effects of urban land use on pollinators
   have compared urban sites with one type of rural site. However, there is
   a lot of variation in the amount of natural habitats or intensive
   agriculture in rural areas. The position of urban areas within that
   continuum in terms of pollinator communities remains unclear. In this
   work, we studied bee and hoverfly communities (abundance, diversity, and
   species composition) in three site types along two river systems
   crossing urban areas, rural areas dominated by agriculture (termed
   rural-agricultural) and rural areas with high amounts of semi-natural
   land use (termed rural-natural). Pollinators were caught in August 2011.
   Abundance and diversity were highest in rural-natural sites for both
   taxonomic groups. Our data also indicate that hoverflies and bees
   responded differently to the surrounding land use, with bee abundance
   and diversity only significantly reduced in rural-agricultural sites but
   not in urban sites, and hoverfly abundance and diversity only
   significantly reduced in urban sites but not in rural-agricultural
   sites. The observed differences in the response of pollinators point out
   the importance of incorporating different types of rural land use and
   clearly defining the rural end of an urban rural gradient in getting a
   clear view on how urban land use affects a specific pollinator group.

Abstract = {{The effect of a pollinator species on a plant depends on their

   pollinators and in others as antagonists damaging flowers, robbing
   nectar or disrupting pollination. Pollinator visitation frequency has
   been demonstrated as the most important factor determining their impact
   on plants. Ants are commonly seen as visitors of the desert shrub
   Condalia microphylla, but their effectiveness as pollinators is unknown.
   In this study we assess the quantitative and qualitative role of ants
   and other winged flower visitors as pollinators of C. microphylla by
   experimentally quantifying their contribution to fruit production. The
   study was conducted in the Monte Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve,
   Mendoza, Argentina. A diverse assemblage of insects visited flowers of
   C. microphylla, including bees, ants, flies, beetles and vespids. Ants
   (Camponotus mus and Camponotus punctulatus) accounted for a high
   proportion of interactions. Fruit set resulted mostly from pollination
   by winged insects, while flowers visited by ants did not set fruits.
   Thus, although ants were commonly seen on flowers, their effectiveness

Abstract = {{1. Size variations in pollinator populations may modify competitive
   interactions among foragers. Competition among pollinators has been
   shown to lead to one of two contrasting behaviours: either
   specialisation to the most profitable plant species or generalisation to
   several species. When foraging, pollinators are also confronted with
   heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of plant resources. Because
   variations in both the forager density and plant spatial distribution
   can affect pollinator behaviour, focus was on the interactive effect of
   these two factors. 2. Bumble bee (Bombus terrestris L.) individuals were
   trained on a focal species (Lotus corniculatus L.) and experimentally
   tested whether variations in the forager density (two or six bumble bees
   foraging together), plant community spatial distribution (two plant
   species: L. corniculatus and Medicago sativa, which were either patchily
   or randomly distributed), and their interaction modified bumble bee
   foraging behaviour. 3. It was shown that when confronted with a high
   forager density, bumble bees focused their visits towards the most
   familiar species, especially when foraging under a random plant
   distribution. These modifications affected the fruiting of the focal
   plant species, with a significantly lower reproductive success under low
   density/patchy conditions. 4. This study demonstrates that the foraging
   decisions of bumble bees are influenced by variations in both the
   conspecific density and plant spatial distribution. Given the increasing
   impact of human activities on plant-pollinator communities, this raises
   the question of the potential implications of these results for plant
   communities in natural conditions when confronted with variations in the
   pollinator density and spatial distribution of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence suggests that pollen chemistry plays an important
   role in shaping the pollen host spectra of many bee species. Although
   the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, pollen diets of several
   plant taxa have experimentally been found to impede larval development
   of unspecialized bees. The pollen of all plant taxa, for which such a
   detrimental effect on bee larval development has been observed so far,
   is freely accessible in the flowers and thus easily harvestable for
   flower visitors, suggesting that this pollen might be chemically
   protected in order to reduce its loss to pollen-feeding animals. In the
   present study, we compared larval performance of five solitary bee
   species on pollen diets of the two Fabaceae species Onobrychis
   viciifolia and Lotus corniculatus, which have their anthers concealed
   inside the flowers, with that on control diets composed of host pollen
   provisions. As the complex flower morphology of the two Fabaceae species
   already considerably narrows the spectrum of pollen harvesting bee taxa,
   which might supersede costly chemical protection of the pollen, we
   expected bees that usually do not exploit Fabaceae to develop well on
   Onobrychis and Lotus pollen diets. Larval survival on the Onobrychis
   pollen diet was successful for all five bee species tested. In contrast,
   larval survival on the Lotus pollen diet was reduced in three species
   despite the fact that Lotus flowers are more difficult to exploit for
   pollen than Onobrychis flowers. We conclude that there is no trade-off
   between pollen concealment and pollen defence in Lotus and that pollen
   of morphologically complex flowers with a restricted visitor spectrum is
   not necessarily an easy-to-use nutritional source.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are highly important because of its direct
   link to plant fitness and because such interactions involve species at
   different trophic levels. Our understanding of competitive and
   facilitative interactions among plants for pollination is of large
   importance to govern conservation of species and management of crop
   production. Still we know little about the scale dependency of
   plant-plant interactions for pollinator visitation which is central to
   both basic and applied ecology.
   Here, I tested whether plant-plant interactions for bumblebee visitation
   and subsequent reproduction were scale-dependent by studying the
   ecologically and economically important red clover (Trifolium pratense)
   and its floral neighbourhood. I expected that high floral densities at
   small scale could trigger facilitative interactions due to concentration
   effects of pollinators. This was expected to change into competitive
   interactions when floral densities became higher at coarser scales
   because of dilution effects. I also expected that increased bumblebee
   visitation would increase fruit production in red clover.
   The interaction for pollination success in red clover appeared to be
   scale-dependent in the landscape under study. At plot scale, the
   bumblebee visitation rate to red clover inflorescences increased with
   both intra- and interspecific floral density, indicating facilitative
   interaction for pollinator visitation among red clover flowers and its
   nearest floral neighbourhood. Increased visitation of bumblebees led to
   subsequent increased fruit set, but there was a saturating effect as
   fruit set did not increase when visitation rates exceeded a certain
   level. As the floral neighbourhood became denser at a coarser scale, the
   interactions for pollinator visitation changed towards competition.
   This study shows that key ecological processes such as plant-pollinator
   interactions may indeed be scale-dependent and that the relative
   importance of competition and facilitation among plants for attracting
   pollinators may change with scale. The density of the floral
   neighbourhood of a focal species (e.g. key-, rare-, crop species) may
   thus be of large importance for its pollination and fruit production. My
   findings suggest that increasing floral densities at fine scales may
   have facilitative effects on pollinator visitation to red clover,
   whereas pollinators may be drawn away when floral resources become
   denser at coarser scale.}},

Abstract = {{Losses of both habitat area and connectivity have been identified as
   important drivers of species richness declines, but little theoretical
   and empirical work exists that addresses the effect of fragmentation on
   relative commonness of highly mobile species such as pollinating
   insects. With a large dataset of wild bee and butterfly abundances
   collected across Europe, we first tested the effect of habitat area and
   connectivity on evenness in pollinator communities using a large array
   of indexes that give different weight to dominance and rarity. Second,
   we tested if traits related to mobility and diet breadth could explain
   the observed evenness patterns. We found a clear negative effect of area
   and a weaker, but positive effect of connectivity on evenness.
   Communities in small habitat fragments were mainly composed of mobile
   and generalist species. The higher evenness in small fragments could
   thereby be generated by highly mobile species that maintain local
   populations with frequent inter-fragment movements. Trait analysis
   suggested an increasing importance of dispersal over local recruitment,
   as we move from large to small fragments and from less to more connected
   fragments. Species richness and evenness were negatively correlated
   indicating that the two variables responded differently to habitat area
   and connectivity, although the mechanisms underlying the observed
   patterns are difficult to isolate. Even though habitat area and
   connectivity often decrease simultaneously due to habitat fragmentation,
   an interesting practical implication of the contrasting effect of the
   two variables is that the resulting community composition will depend on
   the relative strength of these two processes.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species sometimes exhibit dynamic contrasting patterns in terms of
   reproductive traits. Floral colour change - the retention of old,
   non-productive, rewardless, but fully turgid flowers in an altered
   colour - has been considered as a plant strategy for enhancing
   pollinator attraction while minimizing visits to non-reproductive
   flowers. Considering the perceptive and cognitive abilities of animals,
   these advantages should apply in most systems. It seems paradoxical, and
   therefore, that floral colour change occurs in only a portion of
   angiosperms.
   This divergence may be explained if floral colour change adds as yet
   unknown costs or benefits under specific conditions. To explore such
   possibilities, we compared details of trait combinations and pollination
   consequences between a floral colour-changing (Weigela coraeensis) and a
   non-colour-changing (Weigela hortensis) species in a shared environment.
   Flowers of W.coraeensis secreted nectar for initial 2-3days and remained
   white, after which they persisted for a few more days with discoloured,
   red purple petals and reduced nectar levels. Flowers of W.hortensis also
   secreted nectar for initial 2-3days. They persisted for a few more days
   with the same colour and reduced amounts of nectar, but did so only when
   pollinators were scarce. Because only W.hortensis suffered from
   pollination difficulty at our site, both species retained their flowers
   for 4-5days.
   Bees strongly preferred to visit W.coraeensis, leading to a greater
   proportion of seed set than in W.hortensis. In addition to their higher
   nectar productivity, only W.coraeensis plants offered bees colour
   difference as a visual cue to choose rewarding flowers and improve both
   long-term and short-term rates of nectar intake. By learning where to
   return, bees apparently responded to the difference in resource
   exploitability.
   Results indicate that floral colour change yields an additional benefit
   of attracting bee-like pollinators that return preferentially to more
   easily exploitable plants. Under conditions where benefits of enhancing
   both conspicuousness and exploitability cannot outweigh the costs of

Abstract = {{Nectar guides can enhance pollinator efficiency and plant fitness by
   allowing pollinators to more rapidly find and remember the location of
   floral nectar. We tested if a radiating nectar guide around a nectary
   would enhance the ability of na < ve bumble bee foragers to find nectar.
   Most experiments that test nectar guide efficacy, specifically radiating
   linear guides, have used guides positioned around the center of a
   radially symmetric flower, where nectaries are often found. However, the
   flower center may be intrinsically attractive. We therefore used an
   off-center guide and nectary and compared ``conjunct{''} feeders with a
   nectar guide surrounding the nectary to ``disjunct{''} feeders with a
   nectar guide separated from the nectary. We focused on the innate
   response of novice bee foragers that had never previously visited such
   feeders. We hypothesized that a disjunct nectar guide would conflict
   with the visual information provided by the nectary and negatively
   affect foraging. Approximately, equal numbers of bumble bees (Bombus
   impatiens) found nectar on both feeder types. On disjunct feeders,
   however, unsuccessful foragers spent significantly more time (on average
   1.6-fold longer) searching for nectar than any other forager group.
   Successful foragers on disjunct feeders approached these feeders from
   random directions unlike successful foragers on conjunct feeders, which
   preferentially approached the combined nectary and nectar guide. Thus,
   the nectary and a surrounding nectar guide can be considered a
   combination of two signals that attract na < ve foragers even when not
   in the floral center.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding biodiversity distribution is a primary goal of community
   ecology. At a landscape scale, bee communities are affected by habitat
   composition, anthropogenic land use, and fragmentation. However, little
   information is available on local-scale spatial distribution of bee
   communities within habitats that are uniform at the landscape scale. We
   studied a bee community along with floral and nesting resources over a
   32 km(2) area of uninterrupted Mediterranean scrubland. Our objectives
   were (i) to analyze floral and nesting resource composition at the
   habitat scale. We ask whether these resources follow a geographical
   pattern across the scrubland at bee-foraging relevant distances; (ii) to
   analyze the distribution of bee composition across the scrubland. Bees
   being highly mobile organisms, we ask whether bee composition shows a
   homogeneous distribution or else varies spatially. If so, we ask whether
   this variation is irregular or follows a geographical pattern and
   whether bees respond primarily to flower or to nesting resources; and
   (iii) to establish whether body size influences the response to local
   resource availability and ultimately spatial distribution. We obtained
   6580 specimens belonging to 98 species. Despite bee mobility and the
   absence of environmental barriers, our bee community shows a clear
   geographical pattern. This pattern is mostly attributable to
   heterogeneous distribution of small (<55 mg) species (with presumed
   smaller foraging ranges), and is mostly explained by flower resources
   rather than nesting substrates. Even then, a large proportion (54.8\%)
   of spatial variability remains unexplained by flower or nesting
   resources. We conclude that bee communities are strongly conditioned by
   local effects and may exhibit spatial heterogeneity patterns at a scale
   as low as 500-1000 m in patches of homogeneous habitat. These results
   have important implications for local pollination dynamics and spatial
   variation of plant-pollinator networks.}},

Abstract = {{Within-individual variation in floral advertising and reward traits is a
   feature experienced by pollinators that visit different flowers of the
   same plant. Pollinators can use advertising traits to gather information
   about the quality and amount of rewards, leading to the evolution of
   signal-reward correlations. As long as plants differ in the reliability
   of their signals and pollinators base their foraging decisions on this
   information, natural selection should act on within-individual
   correlations between signals and rewards. Because birds and bees differ
   in their cognitive capabilities, and use different floral traits as
   signals, we tested the occurrence of adaptive divergence of the
   withinindividual signal-reward correlations among Salvia species that
   are pollinated either by bees or by hummingbirds. They are expected to
   use different floral advertising traits: frontal traits in the case of
   bees and side traits in the case of hummingbirds. We confirmed this
   expectation as bee- and hummingbird-pollinated species differed in which
   specific traits are pre-dominantly associated with nectar reward at the

Abstract = {{Background: Field studies confirmed that unusually long-tubed
   populations of Pelargonium dipetalum from between Swellendam and
   Albertinia, Western Cape Province, South Africa, are a distinct ecotype
   adapted to pollination by the long-proboscid fly, Prosoeca longipennis.
   The geographical and morphological isolation of these populations
   suggests that they are reproductively isolated from short-tubed
   populations, which are pollinated by bees.
   Objectives: To determine and describe the floral variation in
   Pelargonium dipetalum, with a view to recognising the long-tubed
   populations at some taxonomic level.
   Method: All available collections were measured and compared.
   Results: Populations of Pelargonium dipetalum were segregated into a
   short-tubed form with hypanthium 3 mm - 24 mm long and mostly pink
   petals that occurs from Betty's Bay to Knysna, and a long-tubed form
   with the hypanthium 34 mm - 54 mm long and consistently white petals
   that is restricted to a small area east of Swellendam between Suurbraak
   and Albertinia. We described the long-tubed form as the new subspecies
   Pelargonium dipetalum subsp. stenosiphon.
   Conclusion: The new subspecies increases our understanding of the

Abstract = {{Insects have an unremitting impact on human life, in both beneficial and

   life cycles by pollinating many plants and consuming dead tissues or
   acting as predators to pests and therefore having a vital part in
   shaping our ecosystem. Certain species have a direct economic benefit,
   e.g. bees and silkworms, while many others cause extensive damage on
   stored products, crops and plantations by feeding on grain, leaves or
   fruits. At the top of the hazard scale a few parasitic species transmit
   harmful viruses that cause serious illnesses and even death to humans,
   pets and livestock. To understand and assess the impact of insects one
   needs to have a picture of species existence, spatial distribution and
   population density. Our discussion on classifying flying insects is
   based on the recordings of novel advanced sensors and highly accurate
   classification techniques. The ultimate goal is to embed the
   classification module in insect traps and form a wireless network of

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes to ecosystems typically result in decreased

   generality of this result for bees given that most studies have included
   extremely disturbed areas and are from a limited set of biogeographical
   areas. Repeat sampling of an unusually specialised, species-rich bee
   community was done in the north-western Chihuahuan Desert, North America
   at sites in five habitats (riparian, mesquite forest, abandoned field,
   grassland, and desert scrub) that either had been intensely grazed by
   cattle in the previous year or not been grazed for 22+ years. Species
   density and species composition of bees did not change in response to
   grazing, abundance and proportion of singleton species (those
   represented by one specimen) did. In all habitats, other than the
   riparian, there was lower overall abundance and a greater proportion of
   singleton species at sites that had been recently grazed than at sites
   that had not been grazed since 1979. The proportion of singletons was
   greater in recently grazed than in long-term ungrazed areas, but
   pollen-specialist species did not respond more strongly than pollen
   generalists. The substantial variation in bee abundance and rarity was
   probably associated with differences in floral resources. Overall, lower
   bee abundance in grazed areas reflects the continuous removal by grazers
   of the flowers that bees use. Despite reduced bee abundance due to
   long-term grazing, species richness, and composition in this desert bee
   community remained high.}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of herkogamy has been ascribed to preventing autonomous
   selfing within flowers, but this argument has received challenges due to
   the negative effects of sexual interference on reproductive success of
   plant species. We examined the effects of the two contrasting modes of
   herkogamy, detailed by the different patterns of style movement, on the
   foraging time of pollinators on flowers, pollen removal, and deposition
   in two Chamerion species. Our results suggested that the duration of
   foraging time of bumblebees was generally higher in C. angustifolium
   (L.) Holub than in C. conspersum (Hausskn.) Holub during the male-phase
   of flowers, but the reverse during the female-phase of flowers. As a
   result, stigma interfered with pollen removal more in C. conspersum than
   in C. angustifolium, based on examinations of pollen removal after one
   visit by a pollinator. However, this negative effect on total pollen
   removal was covered by the high pollinator diversity and the possible
   high visitation rate in the study sites. In contrast, we found that
   almost no difference existed in pollen deposition rate after one visit
   of a pollinator between the two Chamerion species, and emasculation did
   not increase the total pollen deposition in either species, indicating
   that anthers did not interfere with pollen deposition in the two
   Chamerion species. Our results suggested that, compared with C.
   conspersum, the derived mode of herkogamy in C. angustifolium reduced
   interference of stigmas in pollen removal. This might contribute to the
   wide distribution of C. angustifolium, to some degree, in environments
   of pollinator scarcity and low activity in newly colonized habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Plants are adapted for rodent pollination in diverse and intricate ways.
   This study explores an extraordinary example of these adaptations in the
   pincushion Leucospermum arenarium (Proteaceae) from South Africa.
   Live trapping and differential exclusion experiments were used to test
   the role of rodents versus birds and insects as pollinators. To explore
   the adaptive significance of geoflory, inflorescences were raised above
   ground level and seed production was compared. Captive rodents and
   flowers with artificial stigmas were used to test the effect of grooming
   on the rate of pollen loss. Microscopy, nectar composition analysis and
   manipulative experiments were used to investigate the bizarre nectar
   production and transport system.
   Differential exclusion of rodents, birds and insects demonstrated the
   importance of rodents in promoting seed production. Live trapping
   revealed that hairy-footed gerbils, Gerbillurus paeba, and striped field
   mice, Rhabdomys pumilio, both carried L. arenarium pollen on their
   forehead and rostrum, but much larger quantities ended up in faeces as a
   result of grooming. Terrarium experiments showed that grooming
   exponentially diminished the pollen loads that they carried. The nectar
   of L. arenarium was found to be unusually viscous and to be presented in
   a novel location on the petal tips, where rodents could access it
   without destroying the flowers. Nectar was produced inside the perianth,
   but was translocated to the petal tips via capillary ducts. In common
   with many other rodent-pollinated plants, the flowers are presented at
   ground level, but when raised to higher positions seed production was
   not reduced, indicating that selection through female function does not
   drive the evolution of geoflory.
   Despite the apparent cost of pollen lost to grooming, L. arenarium has
   evolved remarkable adaptations for rodent pollination and provides the
   first case of this pollination system in the genus.}},

Abstract = {{Coffea arabica, the wild ancestor of all commercial Arabica coffee
   cultivars worldwide, is endemic to the montane rainforests of Ethiopia.
   These forests, which harbour the most important C. arabica gene pool,
   are threatened by increasing anthropogenic disturbance, potentially
   altering the mating patterns, pollen dispersal and maintenance of
   genetic diversity in C. arabica understorey populations. We genotyped
   376 adult coffee shrubs and 418 progenies from three natural unmanaged,
   and three highly managed coffee populations, using 24 microsatellite
   markers. Mating system analysis of C. arabica yielded an overall
   multilocus outcrossing rate of 76\%, which contrasts with the common
   knowledge that C. arabica is a predominantly selfing species. In highly
   managed coffee populations, paternity could be assigned to 78\% of the
   progenies, whereas in the unmanaged natural coffee populations, only
   57\% of the progenies could be assigned to a father, indicating reduced
   long-distance pollen dispersal in managed forests. Furthermore, the
   fraction of selfed progenies was significantly higher in managed (23\%)
   than unmanaged (10\%) coffee forests. Finally, the lack of spatial
   genetic structure in all studied populations suggests high seed
   dispersal in unmanaged populations, and intense berry harvesting and
   coffee planting in the managed populations. Our results imply that in
   situ conservation of the wild gene pool of C. arabica must focus on
   limiting intensification of coffee forest management, as decreased
   pollen dispersal and increased selfing in C. arabica in intensively
   managed populations may increase the risk of genetic erosion. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{The recent decline in pollinator biodiversity, notably in the case of
   wild bee populations, puts both wild and agricultural ecosystems at risk
   of ecological community collapse. This has triggered calls for further
   study of these mutualistic communities in order to more effectively
   inform restoration of disturbed plant-pollinator communities. Here, we
   use a dynamic network model to test a variety of translocation
   strategies for restoring a community after it experiences the loss of
   some of its species. We consider the reintroduction of extirpated
   species, both immediately after the original loss and after the
   community has reequilibrated, as well as the introduction of other
   native species that were originally absent from the community. We find
   that reintroducing multiple highly interacting generalist species best
   restores species richness for lightly disturbed communities. However,
   for communities that experience significant losses in biodiversity,
   introducing generalist species that are not originally present in the
   community may most effectively restore species richness, although in
   these cases the resultant community often shares few species with the
   original community. We also demonstrate that the translocation of a
   single species has a minimal impact on both species richness and the
   frequency of community collapse. These results have important
   implications for restoration practices in the face of varying degrees of
   community perturbations, the refinement of which is crucial for
   community management.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable uncertainties exist on how increased biofuel cropping
   affects biodiversity. Regarding oilseed rape, the most common biofuel
   crop in the EU, positive responses of flower-visiting insects to
   plentiful nectar and pollen seem apparent. However, previous
   investigations on this insect guild revealed conflicting results,
   potentially because they focused on different taxonomic groups
   representing a narrow range of ecological traits and considered only
   short time periods. Here, using trap nests in landscapes with
   independent gradients in area of oilseed rape and seminatural habitats,
   we assessed the whole community of cavity-nesting bees and wasps,
   including early- and late-emerging species. Our study's temporal
   resolution allowed determination of flowering and postflowering effects
   of oilseed rape on these species' richness, abundance, and mortality.
   Species richness of cavity-nesting bees and wasps significantly
   increased with oilseed rape, although nesting activity was considerably
   higher after mass flowering. In addition to increasing richness
   independently of oilseed rape, the amount of seminatural habitat in the
   landscape was the sole positive driver of insect abundance once the
   community's dominant species was accounted for as a covariate. Thus,
   growth of the co-occurring species' community is not stimulated by the
   resource pulse provided by oilseed rape early in the year, but by
   persistent resources provided by seminatural habitats after mass
   flowering. Early individuals of bivoltine species' first generations
   accumulated in seminatural habitats when these habitats were scarce, but
   became increasingly diluted when habitat availability increased. Once
   established, later foraging females generally benefited from the
   resource availability of seminatural habitats when initializing the
   second generation. We conclude that mass-flowering crops, despite
   covering only a short interval of the community's main activity phase,
   benefit bee and wasp species richness. However, seminatural habitats are
   crucial in maintaining viable communities of flower-visiting insects at
   the landscape scale, mitigating potential negative effects of high
   land-use intensities in modern agro-ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Plant reproductive success is supposedly influenced by phenology and
   individual size, which may be modified under edge effects. We tested if
   reproductive success, estimated by fruit set, in Senefeldera
   verticillata (Euphorbiaceae) is related to flowering synchrony and tree
   size, including plant height and circumference at breast height. The
   study was carried out in the interior and in edges of clearings for gas
   pipelines and electric lines of a lowland rainforest in south-eastern
   Brazil. Monthly observations were performed during one reproductive
   season, of 19 individuals that grew at edges of electric lines and gas
   pipelines and at forest interior. Reproductive success was significantly
   higher at forest interior than at gas pipeline area; there was no
   significant difference between gas pipeline and electric line areas or
   between forest interior and electric line area. In the forest edges,
   only plant height was positively related to plant reproductive success.
   This is probably related to crown exposure to sunlight, which enhances
   flower production. At forest interior, reproductive success was
   positively influenced by the synchrony of flowering activity among
   neighbouring individuals. In contrast, flowering synchrony based on
   phenophase intensity negatively impacted reproductive success.
   Senefeldera verticillata shows temporal dioecy and is mainly pollinated
   by small social bees, and the high degree of flowering synchrony at low
   intensity may increase the number of mating partners and therefore
   enhance its reproductive success. Inside the forest fragments,
   individuals with thicker trunks showed lower reproductive success, which
   may be related to a loss of reproductive capacity of older individuals.
   Our results evidenced the complexity of responses experienced by
   tropical plants subjected to forest fragmentation because of linear
   clearings.}},

Abstract = {{Bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen that contain nutrients
   and simultaneously facilitate plant sexual reproduction. Paradoxically,
   nectar produced to attract pollinators often contains deterrent or toxic
   plant compounds associated with herbivore defence. The functional
   significance of these nectar toxins is not fully understood, but they
   may have a negative impact on pollinator behaviour and health, and,
   ultimately, plant pollination. This study investigates whether a
   generalist bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, can detect naturally occurring
   concentrations of nectar toxins. Using paired-choice experiments, we
   identified deterrence thresholds for five compounds found in the nectar
   of bee-pollinated plants: quinine, caffeine, nicotine, amygdalin and
   grayanotoxin. The deterrence threshold was determined when bumblebees
   significantly preferred a sucrose solution over a sucrose solution
   containing the compound. Bumblebees had the lowest deterrence threshold
   for the alkaloid quinine (0.01 mmol l(-1)); all other compounds had
   higher deterrence thresholds, above the natural concentration range in
   floral nectar. Our data, combined with previous work using honeybees,
   suggest that generalist bee species have poor acuity for the detection
   of nectar toxins. The fact that bees do not avoid nectar-relevant
   concentrations of these compounds likely indicates that it is difficult
   for them to learn to associate floral traits with the presence of
   toxins, thus maintaining this trait in plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects are tolerant of hypoxic conditions, but survival may come
   at a cost to long-term health. The alfalfa leaf-cutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata, develops in brood cells inside natural cavities, and may be
   exposed to hypoxic conditions for extended periods of time. Whether M.
   rotundata is tolerant of hypoxia, and whether exposure results in
   sub-lethal effects, has never been investigated. Overwintering M.
   roiundata prepupae were exposed to 10\%, 13\%, 17\%, 21\% and 24\% O-2
   for 11 months. Once adults emerged, five indicators of quality emergence
   weight, body size, feeding activity, flight performance, and adult
   longevity, were measured to determine whether adult bees that survived
   past exposure to hypoxia were competent pollinators. M. rotundata
   prepupae are tolerant of hypoxic condition and have higher survival
   rates in hypoxia, than in normoxia. Under hypoxia, adult emergence rates
   did not decrease over the 11 months of the experiment. In contrast, bees
   reared in normoxia had decreased emergence rates by 8 months, and were
   dead by 11 months. M. rotundata prepupae exposed to extended hypoxic
   conditions had similar emergence weight, head width, and cross-thorax
   distance compared to bees reared in standard 21\% oxygen. Despite no
   significant morphological differences, hypoxia-exposed bees had lower
   feeding rates and shorter adult lifespans. Hypoxia may play a role in
   post-diapause physiology of M. rotundata, with prepupae showing better
   survival under hypoxic conditions. Extended exposure to hypoxia, while
   not fatal, causes sub-lethal effects in feeding rates and longevity in
   the adults, indicating that hypoxia tolerance comes at a cost. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The net effect of pollen production on fecundity in plants can range
   from negative - when self-pollen interferes with fecundity due to
   incompatibility mechanisms, to positive -when pollen availability is
   associated with increased pollinator visitation and fecundity due to its
   utilization as a reward. We investigated the responses of bees to pollen
   and nectar rewards, and the effects of these rewards on pollen
   deposition and fecundity in the hermaphroditic succulent shrub Aloe
   tenuior. Self-pollinated plants failed to set fruit, but their ovules
   were regularly penetrated by self-pollen tubes, which uniformly failed
   to develop into seeds as expected from ovarian self-incompatibility (or
   strong early inbreeding depression). Bees consistently foraged for
   pollen during the morning and early afternoon, but switched to nectar in
   the late afternoon. As a consequence of this differential foraging, we
   were able to test the relative contribution to fecundity of
   pollen-versus nectar-collecting flower visitors. We exposed emasculated
   and intact flowers in either the morning or late afternoon to foraging
   bees and showed that emasculation reduced pollen deposition by insects
   in the morning, but had little effect in the afternoon. Despite the
   potential for self-pollination to result in ovule discounting due to
   late-acting self-sterility, fecundity was severely reduced in
   artificially emasculated plants. Although there were temporal
   fluctuations in reward preference, most bee visits were for pollen
   rewards. Therefore the benefit of providing pollen that is accessible to
   bee foragers outweighs any potential costs to fitness in terms of gender
   interference in this species.}},

   attract nectarivorous birds had floral colours in a small, isolated
   region of colour space characterized by an emphasis on long-wavelength
   reflection. The distinctiveness of this `red arm' region was much
   greater when colours were modelled for violet-sensitive (VS) avian
   vision than for the ultraviolet-sensitive visual system. Honeyeaters
   (Meliphagidae) are the dominant avian nectarivores in Australia and have
   VS vision. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest that 31 lineages
   evolved into the red arm region, whereas simulations indicate that an
   average of five or six lineages and a maximum of 22 are likely to have
   entered in the absence of selection. Thus, significant evolutionary
   convergence on a distinctive floral colour syndrome for bird pollination
   has occurred in Australia, although only a subset of bird-pollinated

   the apparent driver of this convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Many major branches in the Tree of Life are marked by stereotyped body
   plans that have been maintained over long periods of time. One possible
   explanation for this stasis is that there are genetic or developmental
   constraints that restrict the origin of novel body plans. An alternative
   is that basic body plans are potentially quite labile, but are actively
   maintained by natural selection. We present evidence that the conserved
   floral morphology of a species-rich flowering plant clade,
   Malpighiaceae, has been actively maintained for tens of millions of
   years via stabilizing selection imposed by their specialist New World
   oil-bee pollinators. Nine clades that have lost their primary oil-bee
   pollinators show major evolutionary shifts in specific floral traits
   associated with oil-bee pollination, demonstrating that developmental
   constraint is not the primary cause of morphological stasis in
   Malpighiaceae. Interestingly, Malpighiaceae show a burst in species
   diversification coinciding with the origin of this plant-pollinator
   mutualism. One hypothesis to account for radiation despite morphological
   stasis is that although selection on pollinator efficiency explains the
   origin of this unique and conserved floral morphology, tight pollinator
   specificity subsequently permitted greatly enhanced diversification in
   this system.}},

Abstract = {{A new bee genus from Argentina, Psaenythisca, is described and includes
   three species: P. flavifrons (Vachal, 1909), n. comb. (originally
   described as Psaenythia), P. wagneri (Vachal, 1909), n. comb.
   (originally described as Psaenythia), and P. punctata (Urban, 2009), n.
   comb. (originally described as Anthrenoides). The new genus is proposed
   based on a comparative study of the Protandrenini lineages. Psaenythisca
   is closely related to Cephalurgus and Rhophitulus, and can be
   distinguished mainly by the forewing with three submarginal cells,
   premarginal area of S2 to S5 of male with dense pubescence, distal
   margin of S6 of male slightly emarginated, and male genitalia with
   relatively broad basal sclerite. Among Protandrenini genera with three
   submarginal cells, it differs from. Anthrenoides and Psaenythia by the
   combination of male genitalia with a basal sclerite, metasomal terga
   lacking yellow markings, propodeum rounded, middle tibial spur of the
   female finely serrate, and slender basal area of S8 of male. In
   addition, a lectotype is designated for Psaenythia (Psaenythia) wagneri
   Vachal, 1909. The holotype of P. flavifrons and the ledotype of P.
   wagneri are redescribed, and the female of P. flavifrons and male of P.
   punctata are described for the first time. An identification key to, and
   distribution maps of, the species of Psaenythisca are also provided.
   Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Arturo Roig-Alsina and the second
   author discovered a communal nest of one of the species, now known as
   Psaenythisca wagneri (Vachal, 1909). The nest descended approximately 2
   m into the ground and is described herein. From this nest, provision
   masses, eggs, larvae, and pupae were retrieved as well as developmental
   and behavioral information. The immatures are described and compared
   with those of related taxa, and the developmental and behavioral
   information are recorded. Of special interest is the fact that males
   exhibit a wide range of head sizes and head shapes. All of this gives
   rise to intriguing new questions for future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical raceme or spike inflorescences that are bee-pollinated tend to
   present their flowers horizontally. Horizontal presentation of flowers
   is hypothesized to enhance pollinator recognition and pollination
   precision, and it may also ensure greater consistency of pollinator
   movement on inflorescences. We tested the hypotheses using
   bee-pollinated Corydalis sheareri which has erect inflorescences
   consisting of flowers with horizontal orientation. We altered the
   orientation of individual flowers and prepared three types of
   inflorescences: (i) unmanipulated inflorescences with horizontal-facing
   flowers, (ii) inflorescences with flowers turned upward, and (iii)
   inflorescences with flowers turned downward. We compared number of
   inflorescences approached and visited, number of successive probes
   within an inflorescence, the direction percentage of vertical movement
   on inflorescences, efficiency of pollen removal and seed production per
   inflorescence. Deviation from horizontal orientation decreased both
   approaches and visits by leafcutter bees and bumble bees to
   inflorescences. Changes in floral orientation increased the proportion
   of downward movements by leafcutter bees and decreased the consistency
   of pollinator movement on inflorescences. In addition, pollen removal
   per visit and seed production per inflorescence also declined with
   changes of floral orientation. In conclusion, floral orientation seems
   more or less optimal as regards bee behavior and pollen transfer for
   Corydalis sheareri. A horizontal orientation may be under selection of
   pollinators and co-adapt with other aspects of the inflorescence and
   floral traits.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging bees use color cues to help identify rewarding from unrewarding
   flowers. As environmental conditions change, bees may require behavioral
   flexibility to reverse their learnt preferences. Learning to
   discriminate perceptually similar colors takes bees a long time, and
   thus potentially poses a difficult task to reverse-learn. We trained
   free-flying honeybees to learn a fine color discrimination task that
   could only be resolved (with about 70\% accuracy) following extended
   differential conditioning. The bees were then tested for their ability
   to reverse-learn this visual problem. Subsequent analyses potentially
   identified individual behavioral differences that could be broadly
   classified as: `Deliberative-decisive' bees that could, after several
   flower visits, decisively make a large change to learnt preferences;
   `Fickle-circumspect' bees that changed their preferences by a small
   amount every time they received a reward, or failed to receive one, on a
   particular color; and `Stay' bees that did not change from their
   initially learnt preference. To understand the ecological implications
   of the observed behavioral diversity, agent-based computer simulations
   were conducted by systematically varying parameters describing flower
   reward switch oscillation frequency, flower handling time, and fraction
   of defective `target' stimuli that contained no reward. These
   simulations revealed that when the frequency of reward reversals is
   high, Fickle-circumspect bees are more efficient at nectar collection,
   but as reward reversal frequency decreases, the performance of
   Deliberative-decisive bees becomes most efficient. As the reversal
   frequency continues to fall, Fickle-circumspect and
   Deliberative-decisive strategies approach one another in efficiency. In
   no tested condition did Stay bees outperform the other groups. These
   findings indicate there is a fitness benefit for honeybee colonies
   containing individuals exhibiting different strategies for managing
   changing resource conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Rancho La Brea Tar Pits is the world's richest and most important
   Late Pleistocene fossil locality and best renowned for numerous fossil
   mammals and birds excavated over the past century. Less researched are
   insects, even though these specimens frequently serve as the most
   valuable paleoenvironemental indicators due to their narrow climate
   restrictions and life cycles. Our goal was to examine fossil material
   that included insect-plant associations, and thus an even higher
   potential for significant paleoenviromental data. Micro-CT scans of two
   exceptionally preserved leafcutter bee nest cells from the Rancho La
   Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles, California reveal intact pupae dated
   between, similar to 23,000-40,000 radiocarbon years BP. Here identified
   as best matched to Megachile (Litomegachile) gentilis Cresson
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) based on environmental niche models as well
   as morphometrics, the nest cells (LACMRLP 388E) document rare
   preservation and life-stage. The result of complex plant-insect
   interactions, they offer new insights into the environment of the Late
   Pleistocene in southern California. The remarkable preservation of the
   nest cells suggests they were assembled and nested in the ground where
   they were excavated. The four different types of dicotyledonous leaves
   used to construct the cells were likely collected in close proximity to
   the nest and infer a wooded or riparian habitat with sufficient pollen
   sources for larval provisions. LACMRLP 388E is the first record of
   fossil Megachile Latreille cells with pupae. Consequently, it provides a
   pre-modern age location for a Nearctic group, whose phylogenetic
   relationships and biogeographic history remain poorly understood.
   Megachile gentilis appears to respond to climate change as it has
   expanded its distribution across elevation gradients over time as
   estimated by habitat suitability comparisons between low and high
   elevations; it currently inhabits mesic habitats which occurred at a
   lower elevation during the Last Glacial Maximum,21,000 years ago.
   Nevertheless, the broad ecological niche of M. gentilis appears to have
   remained stable.}},

Abstract = {{Silene spaldingii S. Watson (Spalding's catchfly) is a threatened
   wildflower that relies on insect-mediated pollination. However, its
   pollination ecology is not well understood, particularly in the Zumwalt
   Prairie of northeastern Oregon, which contains the largest known S.
   spaldingii population. Our objectives were to: (1) describe the
   principal insect visitors to S. spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie, (2)
   quantify the available pool of pollinators in the area, and (3)
   determine whether the visitation rate to individual plants is associated
   with the density of S. spaldingii at the patch scale, as predicted by
   the resource concentration hypothesis, and/or by the density and
   composition of non-S. spaldingii blooming plants, as predicted by the
   facilitation and competition hypotheses. We recorded insect visits to S.
   spaldingii during peak bloom at 30 patches and characterized the local
   bee community using blue vane traps. We quantified the patch-scale
   density of S. spaldingii and the composition and abundance of other
   blooming species at each patch. Two bumble bee species comprised all
   observed visits, although they constituted only 20\% of the total bees
   sampled on the prairie. Bumble bees showed a high degree of host
   fidelity even when other blooming plants were present. Per capita
   visitation rates increased with catchfly density and blooming plant
   abundance at the patch scale, supporting the resource concentration and
   facilitation hypotheses. Silene spaldingii in the Zumwalt Prairie
   appears to rely on a narrow pool of pollinators that may preferentially
   visit it over other blooming plants, and more dense patches of S.
   spaldingii may increase pollination efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization is a dominant form of land-use change driving species
   distributions, abundances, and diversity. Previous research has
   documented the negative impacts of urbanization on the abundance and
   diversity of many groups of organisms. However, some organisms, such as
   bees, may benefit from moderate levels of development, depending on how
   development alters the availability of foraging and nesting resources.
   To determine how one type of low-intensity human development,
   suburbanization, affects bee abundance and diversity and the mechanisms
   involved, we surveyed bees across suburban and natural forests in the
   Raleigh-Durham area of North Carolina. We sampled for bees using a
   combination of bee bowls and hand-netting from March through July of
   2008 and 2009. We found higher bee abundance in suburban than natural
   forests, and although observed species richness was greater in suburban
   than natural forests, there were no significant differences in rarefied
   richness or evenness estimates in either year. In addition, the effects
   of suburbanization were similar across bee species of varying ecological
   and life-history characteristics. At the local scale, bee abundance and
   species richness were both positively related to the abundance and
   richness of flowering species within forests, while the proportion of
   surrounding developed open areas, such as yards and roadsides, was a
   strong positive predictor of both bee abundance and richness at the
   landscape scale. These results suggest that open habitats and the
   availability of floral resources in suburban sites can support abundant
   and diverse bee communities and underscore the potential for native bee
   conservation in urban habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Native plants attractive to beneficial insects may improve the value of
   buffer strips by increasing biodiversity and enhancing the delivery of

   found in buffers of USDA-certified organic farms in Iowa (typically a
   single species), recommended for prairie reconstruction, or recommended
   for attracting beneficial insects. We hypothesized that the diversity

   floral resources, 2) intermediate in buffers with reduced species
   richness and availability of floral resources, and 3) lowest in buffers

   beneficial insects were collected in buffers composed of species
   selected for their attractiveness to beneficial insects than a community
   recommended for prairie restoration. These differences suggest 1) plant
   communities that dominate existing buffers are not optimal for
   attracting beneficial insects, 2) adding flowering perennial species
   could improve buffers as habitat for beneficial insects, 3) buffers can
   be optimized by intentionally combining the most attractive native

Abstract = {{In peanut-cotton farmscapes in Georgia, the stink bugs Nezara viridula

   tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica L.), a nectar-producing plant,
   can increase parasitism of these bugs by Trichopoda pennipes (F.)

   Adult T. pennipes, monarch butterflies, honey bees, and native insect
   pollinators readily fed on floral nectar of milkweed. Monarch larvae
   feeding on milkweed vegetation successfully developed into pupae. In
   2009, N. viridula was the primary host of T. pennipes in cotton, and
   parasitism of this pest by the parasitoid was significantly higher in

   parasitism of N. viridula, C. hilaris, and L. phyllopus by T. pennipes
   was signi\_cantly higher in milkweed cotton (24.0\%) than in control
   cotton (1.1\%). For both years of the study, these treatment differences
   were not owing to a response by the parasitoid to differences in host
   density, because density of hosts was not significantly different

Abstract = {{Given that many pollinators have exhibited dramatic declines related to

   collection across human-altered landscapes is essential to conservation
   efforts. Despite the importance of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) as global
   pollinators, little is known regarding how pollen collection patterns

   Vosnesensky bumble bees (Bombus vosnesenskii Radoszkowski) were
   collected from a range of human-altered and natural landscapes in
   northern California. Extensive vegetation surveys and Geographic
   Information System (GIS)-based habitat classifications were conducted at
   each site, bees were genotyped to identify colony mates, and pollen
   loads were examined to identify visited plants. In contrast to
   predictions based on strong competitive interactions, pollen load
   composition was significantly more similar for bees captured in a shared
   study region compared with bees throughout the research area but was not
   significantly more similar for colony mates. Preference analyses
   revealed that pollen loads were not composed of the most abundant plant
   species per study region. The majority of ranked pollen preference lists
   were significantly correlated for pairwise comparisons of colony mates
   and individuals within a study region, whereas the majority of pairwise
   comparisons of ranked pollen preference lists between individuals
   located at separate study regions were uncorrelated. Results suggest
   that pollen load composition and foraging preferences are similar for
   bees throughout a shared landscape regardless of colony membership. The
   importance of native plant species in pollen collection is illustrated
   through preference analyses, and we suggest prioritization of specific
   rare native plant species for enhanced bumble bee pollen collection.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal resource continuity promotes persistence of mobile animal
   populations. Current agricultural landscapes are poor in flowers
   resources for bumble bees. Available forage crops are predominantly
   early-season mass-flowering crops (MFC). It has been suggested, but not
   tested, that scarcity of late-season flower resources are limiting
   bumble bee populations. We examined whether addition of late-season
   flowering red clover affected worker, queen and male bumble bee
   densities. Bumble bees were surveyed in flower-rich uncultivated field
   borders across 24 landscapes (radius 2 km) with or without a clover
   field in the centre, varying in semi-natural grassland (SNG) and early
   MFC availability. Clover fields had over ten times higher worker
   densities compared to field borders, suggesting red clover as favoured
   forage. Five times more queens and 71\% more males were found in
   landscapes with clover fields compared to control landscapes, despite
   these fields constituting less than 0.2\% of the landscape area. Both
   MFC and SNG increased the density of males, but only in the presence of
   clover fields. Our results suggest that late-flowering red clover
   positively affects bumble bee reproduction, likely by increasing

   collecting orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae): active sampling (at
   chemical baits with hand nets) versus passive sampling (with baited
   traps). Data were retrieved from previous field studies in which both
   methodologies were employed simultaneously. We evaluated the
   effectiveness of each method in terms of the number of species collected
   and the composition of the bee species through paired t test and
   Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance, respectively. Active
   sampling collected significantly more bee species than passive sampling
   in all but one study. The composition of bee species collected by each
   of the two methods was also significantly different. Larger bees
   belonging to Eulaema and Eufriesea species tended to be more frequent in
   traps. In contrast, all Euglossa species presented comparatively higher
   relative frequencies with active sampling. We challenge previous
   assertions that both methodologies are equally effective and argue that
   insisting on the sole use of baited traps in orchid-bee inventories may
   result in retrieving strongly biased raw data which will eventually lead
   to incorrect conclusions about the actual composition of orchid-bee
   assemblages. Since orchid bees have been more and more used as key
   organisms in studies on environmental impact in the Neotropics,
   particularly in Brazil, and the passive sampling methodology has been
   adopted as the ``official{''} one by the Brazilian environmental agency
   (IBAMA), we suggest a re-evaluation of this practice and the adoption of
   the more expensive, but more reliable, methodology of using well-trained
   field researchers to actively collect data on these important
   Neotropical pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Native and exotic plants can influence one another's fecundity through
   their influence on shared pollinators. Specifically, invasion may alter
   abundance and composition of local floral resources, affecting
   pollinator visitation and ultimately causing seedset of natives in
   more-invaded and less-invaded floral neighborhoods to differ. Such
   pollinator-mediated effects of exotic plants on natives are common, but
   native and exotic plants often share multiple pollinators, which may
   differ in their responses to altered floral neighborhoods. We quantified
   pollinator-mediated interactions between three common forbs of western
   Washington prairies (native Microseris laciniata and Eriophyllum lanatum
   and European Hypochaeris radicata) in three floral neighborhoods: 1)
   high native and low exotic floral density, 2) high exotic floral density
   and low native density, and 3) experimentally manipulated low exotic
   floral density. Pollinator visitation rates varied by floral
   neighborhood, plant species identity, and their interaction for all
   three plant species. Similarly, pollinator functional groups (eusocial
   bees, solitary bees, and syrphid flies) contributed differing
   proportions of total visitation to each species depending upon
   neighborhood context. Consequently, in exotic neighborhoods H. radicata
   competed with native M. laciniata, reducing seed set, while
   simultaneously facilitating visitation and seed set for native E.
   lanatum. Seed set of H. radicata was also highest in exotic
   neighborhoods (with high densities of conspecifics), raising the
   possibility of a positive feedback between exotic abundance and success.
   Our results suggest that the outcome of indirect interactions between
   native and exotic plants depends on the density and the composition of
   the floral neighborhood and of the pollinator fauna, and on
   context-dependent pollinator foraging.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this trial was to test a wildflower roof in order to show how
   a country landscape fits in an urban environment. The bio-agronomic
   performance, the biodiversity dynamics during the two-years experiment,
   and the pollinating fauna, were analysed.
   Each plant group was able to efficiently colonize the surface of the
   roof though in different periods and with various modalities. Thermal
   insulation of green roof was connected to different development dynamics
   of leaf canopies. In particular, this cooling effect took place during
   the peak of the vegetation's growth pattern. As expected, each plant
   group had differing flowering periods, during which were observed
   coincided highest rate of pollinator' visits (domestic and solitary
   bees, bumblebees, lepidoptera, diptera both syrphidae and bombyliidae).
   The agronomic management, consisting in senescent vegetation mowing, was
   of crucial importance to ensure the plant equilibrium of spring and
   summer flowering species. The lack of a prevailing species was
   highlighted by several biodiversity indexes. On the contrary, early and
   late flowering species (geophytes) did not require any vegetation
   management. In conclusion, even if wildflowers exhibit critical aspects

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of past climatic events on the demographic
   history of extant species is critical for predicting species' responses
   to future climate change. Palaeoclimatic instability is a major
   mechanism of lineage diversification in taxa with low dispersal and
   small geographical ranges in tropical ecosystems. However, the impact of
   these climatic events remains questionable for the diversification of
   species with high levels of gene flow and large geographical
   distributions. In this study, we investigate the impact of Pleistocene
   climate change on three Neotropical orchid bee species (Eulaema
   bombiformis, E.meriana and E.cingulata) with transcontinental
   distributions and different physiological tolerances. We first generated
   ecological niche models to identify species-specific climatically stable
   areas during Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Using a combination of
   mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we inferred calibrated phylogenies
   and estimated historical demographic parameters to reconstruct the
   phylogeographical history of each species. Our results indicate species
   with narrower physiological tolerance experienced less suitable habitat
   during glaciations and currently exhibit strong population structure in
   the mitochondrial genome. However, nuclear markers with low and high
   mutation rates show lack of association with geography. These results
   combined with lower migration rate estimates from the mitochondrial than
   the nuclear genome suggest male-biased dispersal. We conclude that
   despite large effective population sizes and capacity for long-distance
   dispersal, climatic instability is an important mechanism of maternal
   lineage diversification in orchid bees. Thus, these Neotropical
   pollinators are susceptible to disruption of genetic connectivity in the
   event of large-scale climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes of the environment influence the distribution and
   abundance of pollinators such as bumblebees and have been proposed as
   one of the main causes in their worldwide decline. In order to evaluate
   the impact of expanding anthropogenic landscapes on supporting
   pollinator potential, reliable tools are needed. Bombus terrestris is
   one of the most abundant bumblebee species in Europe, and these
   bumblebees are known as generalist pollinators of not only wild flowers
   in nature but also of crops in agriculture. For more than two decades,
   these bumblebees have been commercially mass reared for biological
   pollination in greenhouses. In this project, we placed commercial hives
   of the bumblebee B. terrestris containing one queen and 40 workers, in
   three different locations in the region of Ghent (Belgium), and the
   performance of these hives was followed during a 4-week period in spring
   2012. In parallel, we determined the floral richness and diversity index
   in the chosen study sites. The sites consisted of a rich urban
   environment with patchy green areas opposed to an urban environment with
   poor landscape metrics; a third rural study site showed average positive
   landscape metrics. The results demonstrated that the hive biomass and
   numbers of workers increased significantly in the rich compared to the
   poor environment, providing a mechanism to discriminate between study
   sites. In addition, the bumblebee-collected pollen showed that the
   flowering plants Salix spp. and Rosaceae/Prunus spp. are dominant food
   sources in all anthropogenic environments during early spring. Finally,
   the results are discussed in relation to the optimization of the

Abstract = {{Although urban gardens provide opportunities for pollinators in an
   otherwise inhospitable environment, most garden plants are not native to
   the recipient biogeographical region and their value to local
   pollinators is disputed. This study tested the hypothesis that
   bumblebees foraging in English urban gardens preferentially visited
   sympatric Palaearctic-range plants over species originating outside
   their native range.
   Twenty-seven surveys of flower availability and bumblebee visitation
   (Bombus spp.) were conducted over a 3-month summer period. Plants were
   categorized according to whether they were native British, Palaearctic
   or non-Palaearctic in origin. A phylogeny of the 119 plant species
   recorded was constructed and the relationship between floral abundance
   and the frequency of pollinator visits investigated by means of
   phylogenetically independent contrasts. Differentiation in utilization
   of plant species by the five bumblebee species encountered was
   investigated using niche overlap analyses.
   There was conflicting evidence for preferential use of native-range
   Palaearctic plant species by bumblebees depending on which plants were
   included in the analysis. Evidence was also found for niche partitioning
   between species based on respective preferences for native and
   non-native biogeographical range plants. Two bumblebees (Bombus
   terrestris and B. pratorum) concentrated their foraging activity on
   non-Palaearctic plants, while two others (B. hortorum and B. pascourum)
   preferred Palaearctic species.
   The long-running debate about the value of native and non-native garden
   plants to pollinators probably stems from a failure to properly consider
   biogeographical overlap between plant and pollinator ranges. Gardeners
   can encourage pollinators without consideration of plant origin or bias
   towards local biogeographical species. However, dietary specialist
   bumblebees seem to prefer plants sympatric with their own
   biogeographical range and, in addition to the cultivation of these
   species in gardens, provision of native non-horticultural (weed) species
   may also be important for pollinator conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of agriculture reduces heterogeneity at local and
   landscape levels and thereby impact biodiversity and ecosystem
   processes. We studied a host-antagonist system of cavity-nesting bees,
   wasps and their antagonists and hypothesised that hosts and antagonists
   show different responses to local land-use intensity, the diversity of
   landscape in terms of composition and the spatial structure of landscape
   in terms of configuration.
   In a highly replicated study, we established nesting resources on 95
   grasslands in three geographic regions across Germany and measured
   species richness and abundance of hosts (bees and wasps) and their
   antagonists, and rates of parasitism. For each site, we quantified local
   land-use intensity as well as landscape heterogeneity in terms of
   composition and configuration at spatial scales ranging from 250 m to
   2000 m.
   Increasing landscape heterogeneity enhanced species richness, abundance
   and parasitism rate, whereas local land-use intensity only marginally
   negatively affected total abundance. Bee and wasp abundance as well as
   wasp species richness were enhanced by landscape composition at 250 m,
   whereas their antagonists were enhanced by landscape configuration at
   1500 m.
   In conclusion, landscape composition and configuration affect trophic
   levels differently and are more relevant than local land-use intensity.
   Solitary bees and wasps, which offer important pollination and pest
   control services, could be supported by enhancing landscape diversity,
   while their antagonists could benefit from measures that promote
   landscape connectivity. Hence, scale-dependent and trophic group
   specific conservation management schemes are required, that address
   different components of landscape heterogeneity to enhance functional
   diversity and trophic interactions in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2014

   sub-lethal effects on the bumblebee workforce, and hence in reducing

   significantly different than that of control bees, treated bees brought
   back pollen less often than control bees (40 \% of trips vs 63 \% trips,
   respectively) and, where pollen was collected, treated bees brought back
   31 \% less pollen per hour than controls. This study demonstrates that
   field-realistic doses of these pesticides substantially impacts on

Abstract = {{1. Pollinating insects are globally declining, with one of the main
   causes being the loss of flowers. With the value of countryside
   reducing, urban areas, particularly gardens, are increasingly recognized
   as of benefit to wildlife, including flower-visiting insects.
   2. Many gardeners specifically select plant varieties attractive to
   wildlife. Given the wide public interest, many lists of recommended
   varieties have been produced by both amateurs and professional
   organizations, but appear not to be well grounded in empirical data.
   These lists, however, are not without merit and are an obvious starting
   point. There is clearly a need to put the process onto a firmer footing
   based more on data and less on opinion and general experience.
   3. We collected data over two summers by counting flower-visiting
   insects as they foraged on 32 popular summer-flowering garden plant
   varieties in a specially planted experimental garden, with two smaller
   additional gardens set up in year two to check the generality of the
   results. With many thousands of plant varieties available to gardeners
   in the United Kingdom, and other countries or regions, it would have
   been an impossible task to make a comprehensive survey resulting in a
   complete and authoritative list.
   4. Our results are valuable and encouraging. Garden flowers attractive
   to the human eye vary enormously, approximately 100-fold, in their
   attractiveness to insects. Insects, especially bees and hover flies, can
   be attracted in large numbers with clear differences in the distribution
   of types attracted by different varieties.
   5. Our results clearly show that there is a great scope for making
   gardens and parks more beeand insect-friendly by plant selection.
   Horticulturally modified plant varieties created by plant breeding,
   including hybrids, are not necessarily less attractive to insects and in
   some cases are more attractive than their wild-type counterparts.
   Importantly, all the plants we compared were considered highly
   attractive to humans, given that they are widely sold as ornamental
   garden plants.
   6. Helping insect pollinators in gardens does not involve extra cost or
   gardening effort, or loss of aesthetic attractiveness. Furthermore, the
   methods of quantifying insect-friendliness of plant varieties trialled
   in this study are relatively simple and can form the basis of further
   research, including `citizen science'.}},

   native, wild bee pollinators and the pollination services they provided
   to highbush blueberry Vaccinium corymbosum L. crops at 16 sites that
   varied in the proportion of surrounding agricultural land cover at both
   the field scale (300-m radius) and the landscape scale (1500-m radius).
   We designed our study such that agricultural land cover at the field
   scale was uncorrelated with agricultural cover at the landscape scale
   across sites. We used model selection to determine which spatial scale
   better predicted aggregate bee abundance, abundance of large versus
   small bees and crop pollination services. We found that, overall, bees
   responded more strongly to field-scale than to landscape-scale land
   cover, but the scale at which land cover had the strongest effect varied
   by bee body size. Large bees showed a negative response to increasing
   agricultural cover at both scales, but were most strongly affected by
   the landscape scale. Small bees were negatively affected by agricultural
   land cover but only at the field scale, while they had a small positive
   response to agricultural cover at the landscape scale. Aggregate
   pollination services from native bees were more strongly influenced by
   field-scale agricultural cover, due to the combined effects of both
   large and small bees responding at that scale.Synthesis and
   applications. Bee abundance and pollination services were strongly
   determined by field-scale agricultural cover, suggesting that
   field-scale set-asides may provide significant benefits to pollination
   services. Further, we found that pollinators respond differently to land
   use depending on body size, but all groups of bees benefit from
   decreasing agricultural cover at the field scale. Therefore, small-scale
   modifications to habitat can have significant impacts on both pollinator
   abundance and pollination services to crop plants.

   Bees are exposed to pesticides when foraging in agricultural areas and
   growing evidence suggests that such compounds can be harmful to managed
   and wild populations. Given the economic and ecological importance of
   bees, and the evidence of widespread population declines, the full
   impacts of pesticides and their interactions with other stressors in the
   environment need to be investigated.
   Here, we focus on the impacts of chronic exposure to the commonly used
   pyrethroid pesticide lambda ()-cyhalothrin on the bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris at both the individual and colony level. Furthermore, we
   investigated the interactions of pesticide exposure with a highly
   prevalent trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi. Colonies were exposed to
   -cyhalothrin in the laboratory, and colony growth and reproductive
   output were monitored for up to 14weeks. The potential interactions
   between the pesticide and C.bombi were investigated by quantifying the
   impact of pesticide treatment on susceptibility to, and success of
   experimental infections, as well as the survival of workers. Male
   survival after larval pesticide exposure was also monitored.
   Pesticide-treated colonies produced workers with a significantly lower
   body mass. However, out of the twelve variables of colony development
   measured, this was the only metric that was significantly affected by
   pesticide treatment and there was no subsequent significant impact on
   the reproductive output of colonies.
   Lambda-cyhalothrin had no significant impact on the susceptibility of
   workers to C.bombi, or intensity of parasitic infection.
   Pesticide exposure did not cause differential survival in workers or
   males, even when workers were additionally challenged with C.bombi.
   Synthesis and applications. Chronic exposure to -cyhalothrin has a
   significant impact on worker size, a key aspect of bumblebee colony
   function, particularly under conditions of limited food resources. This
   could indicate that under times of resource limitation, colonies exposed
   to this pesticide in the field may fail. However, the lack of other
   impacts found in this study indicate that further field trials are
   needed to elucidate this.

Abstract = {{Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), such as alkaloids, are often found
   in many parts of a plant, including flowers, providing protection to the
   plant from various types of herbivores or microbes. PSMs are also
   present in the floral nectar of many species, but typically at lower
   concentrations than in other parts of the plant. Nectar robbers often
   damage floral tissue to access the nectar. By doing so, these nectar
   robbers may initiate an increase of PSMs in the floral nectar. It is
   often assumed that it takes at least a few hours before the plant
   demonstrates an increase in PSMs. Here, we addressed the question of
   whether PSMs in the floral tissue are immediately being released into
   the floral nectar following nectar robbing. To address this research
   question, we investigated whether there was an immediate effect of
   nectar robbing by the Palestine Sunbird (Nectarinia osea) on the
   concentration of nectar alkaloids, nicotine and anabasine, in Tree
   Tobacco (Nicotiana glauca). We found that the concentration of
   anabasine, but not nicotine, significantly increased in floral nectar
   immediately following simulated nectar robbing. These findings suggest
   that nectar robbers could be ingesting greater amounts of PSMs than they
   would if they visit flowers legitimately. As a consequence, increased
   consumption of neurotoxic nectar alkaloids or other PSMs could have
   negative effects on the nectar robber.}},

Abstract = {{Bees produce vibrations in many contexts, including for defense and
   while foraging. Buzz pollination is a unique foraging behavior in which
   bees vibrate the anthers of flowers to eject pollen which is then
   collected and used as food. The relationships between buzzing properties
   and pollen release are well understood, but it is less clear to what
   extent buzzing vibrations vary among species, even though such
   information is crucial to understanding the functional relationships
   between bees and buzz-pollinated plants. Our goals in this study were
   (1) to examine whether pollination buzzes differ from those produced
   during defense, (2) to evaluate the similarity of buzzes between
   different species of bumblebees (Bombus spp.), and (3) to determine if
   body size affects the expression of buzzing properties. We found that
   relative peak amplitude, peak frequency, and duration were significantly
   different between species, but only relative peak amplitude differed
   between pollination and defensive buzzes. There were significant
   interactions between species and buzz type for peak frequency and
   duration, revealing that species differed in their patterns of
   expression in these buzz properties depending on the context. The only
   parameter affected by body size was duration, with larger bees producing
   shorter buzzes. Our findings suggest that although pollination and
   defensive buzzes differ in some properties, variability in buzz
   structure also exhibits a marked species-specific component. Species
   differences in pollination buzzes may have important implications for
   foraging preferences in bumblebees, especially if bees select flowers
   best matched to release pollen for their specific buzzing
   characteristics.}},

Title = {{Contribution of insect pollinators to crop yield and quality varies with
   agricultural intensification}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Background. Up to 75\% of crop species benefit at least to some degree
   from animal pollination for fruit or seed set and yield. However, basic
   information on the level of pollinator dependence and pollinator
   contribution to yield is lacking for many crops. Even less is known
   about how insect pollination affects crop quality. Given that habitat
   loss and agricultural intensification are known to decrease pollinator
   richness and abundance, there is a need to assess the consequences for
   different components of crop production.
   Methods. We used pollination exclusion on flowers or inflorescences on a
   whole plant basis to assess the contribution of insect pollination to
   crop yield and quality in four flowering crops (spring oilseed rape,
   field bean, strawberry, and buckwheat) located in four regions of
   Europe. For each crop, we recorded abundance and species richness of
   flower visiting insects in ten fields located along a gradient from
   simple to heterogeneous landscapes.
   Results. Insect pollination enhanced average crop yield between 18 and
   71\% depending on the crop. Yield quality was also enhanced in most
   crops. For instance, oilseed rape had higher oil and lower chlorophyll
   contents when adequately pollinated, the proportion of empty seeds
   decreased in buckwheat, and strawberries' commercial grade improved;
   however, we did not find higher nitrogen content in open pollinated
   field beans. Complex landscapes had a higher overall species richness of
   wild pollinators across crops, but visitation rates were only higher in
   complex landscapes for some crops. On the contrary, the overall yield
   was consistently enhanced by higher visitation rates, but not by higher
   pollinator richness.
   Discussion. For the four crops in this study, there is clear benefit
   delivered by pollinators on yield quantity and/or quality, but it is not
   maximized under current agricultural intensification. Honeybees, the
   most abundant pollinator, might partially compensate the loss of wild
   pollinators in some areas, but our results suggest the need of
   landscape-scale actions to enhance wild pollinator populations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{In dioecious, zoophilous plants potential pollinators have to be
   attracted to both sexes and switch between individuals of both sexes for
   pollination to occur. It often has been suggested that males and females
   require different numbers of visits for maximum reproductive success
   because male fertility is more likely limited by access to mates,
   whereas female fertility is rather limited by resource availability.
   According to sexual selection theory, males therefore should invest more
   in pollinator attraction (advertisement, reward) than females. However,
   our knowledge on the sex specific investment in floral rewards and
   advertisement, and its effects on pollinator behaviour is limited. Here,
   we use an approach that includes chemical, spectrophotometric, and
   behavioural studies i) to elucidate differences in floral nectar reward
   and advertisement (visual, olfactory cues) in dioecious sallow, Salix
   caprea, ii) to determine the relative importance of visual and olfactory
   floral cues in attracting honey bee pollinators, and iii) to test for
   differential attractiveness of female and male inflorescence cues to
   honey bees. Nectar amount and sugar concentration are comparable, but
   sugar composition varies between the sexes. Olfactory sallow cues are
   more attractive to honey bees than visual cues; however, a combination
   of both cues elicits the strongest behavioural responses in bees. Male
   flowers are due to the yellow pollen more colourful and emit a higher
   amount of scent than females. Honey bees prefer the visual but not the
   olfactory display of males over those of females. In all, the data of
   our multifaceted study are consistent with the sexual selection theory
   and provide novel insights on how the model organism honey bee uses
   visual and olfactory floral cues for locating host plants.}},

   in the solitary bee Megachile rotundata}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Females of solitary, nest-provisioning bees have relatively low
   fecundity, but produce large eggs as part of their overall strategy of
   investing substantially in each offspring. In intraspecific comparisons
   of several species of solitary, nest-provisioning bees and wasps, the
   size of the mature eggs produced increases with female body size. We
   further examined oocyte size-body size correlations in the solitary bee
   Megachile rotundata (F.), an important crop pollinator. We hypothesized
   that larger females carry larger basal oocytes (i.e., those next in line
   to be oviposited) but that body size-oocyte size correlations would be
   absent soon after emergence, before their first eggs fully matured.
   Because egg production is likely affected by the quantity of stored
   lipids carried over from the bees' immature stages, we also tested the
   hypothesis that female body size is correlated with the body lipid
   content at adult emergence, the time during which oocyte growth
   accelerates. We found significant correlations of body size with oocyte
   size variables chosen to reflect: (1) the magnitude of the investment in
   the next egg to be laid (i.e., the length and volume of the basal
   oocyte) and (2) the longer term potential to produce mature oocytes
   (i.e., the summed lengths and volumes of the three largest oocytes in
   each female). Positive correlations existed throughout the nesting
   season, even during the first week following adult emergence. The
   ability to produce and carry larger oocytes may be linked to larger
   females starting the nesting season with greater lipid stores (which we
   document here) or to greater space within the abdomen of larger females.
   Compared to other species of solitary bees, M. rotundata appears to have
   (1) smaller oocytes than solitary nest-provisioning bees in general, (2)
   comparable oocyte sizes relative to congeners, and (3) larger oocytes
   than related brood parasitic megachilids.}},

Abstract = {{Recent declines in bee populations coupled with advances in

   pollinator, but is stricken by chalkbrood, a disease caused by the

   four treatments to the pollen provisions of M. rotundata eggs and young

   454 pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR (for A. aggregata) to

   Antifungals lowered A. aggregata abundance but increased the diversity
   of surviving fungi. This suggests that A. aggregata inhibits the growth

   Bacterial richness decreased under the antifungal treatment, suggesting
   that changes in the fungal community caused changes in the bacterial
   community. We found no evidence that bacteria affect fungal communities.

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{221-230}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Here, we report on the results of an experimental study that assessed
   the visitation frequency of wild bees to conspecific flowers with
   different sized floral guides. UV absorbent floral guides are ubiquitous
   in Angiosperms, yet surprisingly little is known about conspecific
   variation in these guides and very few studies have evaluated pollinator
   response to UV guide manipulation. This is true despite our rich
   understanding about learning and color preferences in bees. Historical
   dogma indicates that flower color serves as an important long-range
   visual signal allowing pollinators to detect the flowers, while floral
   guides function as close-range signals that direct pollinators to a
   reward. We initiated the work presented here by first assessing the
   population level variation in UV absorbent floral guides for conspecific
   flowers. We assessed two species, Rudbeckia hirta and R. fulgida. We
   then used several petal cut-andpaste experiments to test whether UV
   floral guides can also function to attract visitors. We manipulated
   floral guide size and evaluated visitation frequency. In all
   experiments, pollinator visitation rates were clearly associated with
   floral guide size. Diminished floral guides recruited relatively few
   insect visitors. Exaggerated floral guides recruited more visitors than
   smaller or average sized guides. Thus, UV floral guides play an
   important role in pollinator recruitment and in determining the relative
   attractiveness of conspecific flower heads. Consideration of floral
   guides is therefore important when evaluating the overall
   conspicuousness of flower heads relative to background coloration. This
   work raises the issue of whether floral guides serve as honest
   indicators of reward, since guide size varies in nature for conspecific
   flowers at the same developmental stage and since preferences for larger
   guides were found. To our knowledge, these are the first cut-andpaste
   experiments conducted to examine whether UV absorbent floral guides
   affect visitation rates and pollinator preference.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Interactions with pollinators are proposed to be one of the
   major drivers of diversity in angiosperms. Specialised interactions with
   pollinators can lead to specialised floral traits, which collectively
   are known as a pollination syndrome. While it is thought that
   specialisation to a pollinator can lead to either an increase in
   diversity or in some cases a dead end, it is not well understood how
   transitions among specialised pollinators contribute to changes in
   diversity. Here, we use evolutionary trait reconstruction of
   bee-pollination and bird-pollination syndromes in Australian
   egg-and-bacon peas (Mirbelieae and Bossiaeeae) to test whether
   transitions between pollination syndromes is correlated with changes in
   species diversity. We also test for directionality in transitions that
   might be caused by selection by pollinators or by an evolutionary
   ratchet in which reversals to the original pollination syndrome are not
   possible.
   Results: Trait reconstructions of Australian egg-and-bacon peas suggest
   that bee-pollination syndrome is the ancestral form and that there has
   been replicated evolution of bird-pollination syndromes. Reconstructions
   indicate potential reversals from bird-to bee-pollination syndromes but
   this is not consistent with morphology. Species diversity of
   bird-pollination syndrome clades is lower than that of their
   bee-pollination syndrome sisters. We estimated the earliest transitions
   from bee-to bird-pollination syndrome occurred between 30.8 Ma and 10.4
   Ma. Geographical structuring of pollination syndromes was found; there
   were fewer bird-pollination species in the Australian southeast
   temperate region compared to other regions of Australia.
   Conclusions: A consistent decrease in diversification rate coincident
   with switches to bird pollination might be explained if greater
   dispersal by bird pollinators results in higher levels of connectivity
   among populations and reduced chances of allopatric speciation. The
   earliest transitions overlap with the early diversification of
   Australian honeyeaters-the major lineage of pollinating birds in
   Australia. Our findings are consistent with the idea that environment
   and availability of pollinators are important in the evolution of
   pollination syndromes. Changes in flower traits as a result of
   transitions to bird-pollination syndrome might also limit reversals to a
   bee-pollination syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Animal species in the Neotropics have evolved under a lower
   spatiotemporal patchiness of food resources compared to the other
   tropical regions. Although plant species with a steady-state
   flowering/fruiting phenology are rare, they provide predictable food
   resources and therefore may play a pivotal role in animal community
   structure and diversity. I experimentally planted a supplemental patch
   of a shrub species with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology,
   Hamelia patens Jacq., into coffee agroforests to evaluate the
   contribution of this unique phenology to the structure and diversity of
   the flower-visiting community. After accounting for the higher abundance
   of captured animals in the coffee agroforests with the supplemental
   floral resources, species richness was 21\% higher overall in the
   flower-visiting community in these agroforests compared to control
   agroforests. Coffee agroforests with the steady-state supplemental
   floral patch also had 31\% more butterfly species, 29\% more hummingbird
   species, 65\% more wasps and 85\% more bees than control coffee
   agroforests. The experimental treatment, together with elevation,
   explained 57\% of the variation in community structure of the
   flower-visiting community. The identification of plant species that can
   support a high number of animal species, including important ecosystem
   service providers, is becoming increasingly important for restoration
   and conservation applications. Throughout the Neotropics plant species
   with a steady-state flowering/fruiting phenology can be found in all
   aseasonal forests and thus could be widely tested and suitable species
   used throughout the tropics to manage for biodiversity and potentially
   ecosystem services involving beneficial arthropods.}},

   outside the greenhouse, but with confinement the daily period of
   foraging decreased and bees started collecting pollen from the flowers
   after approximately six months. The difficulty in orienting to and
   identifying flowers by the workers was attributed to sunlight diffusion

Abstract = {{Across N.W. Europe intensive agricultural management has increased
   productivity to the detriment of floral resources vital for insect
   pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. While the creation of
   wildflower habitats has been widely used to re-establish such resources
   into arable ecosystems (e.g. sown into field margins), comparable low
   cost methods for enhancing floristic diversity in production grasslands
   are lacking. We investigated how simple and cheep seed mixtures based
   around three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and
   non-leguminous forbs) could be used to enhance flowering resources to
   benefit insect pollinator communities over a four year period. We
   demonstrate that the abundance and species richness of pollinators was
   correlated with the increased availability of legume and non-legume forb
   flowers. While the flowering resources provided by agricultural
   cultivars of legumes declined rapidly once sown, the inclusion of a forb
   component within seed mixtures was effective in increasing the long-term
   persistence of these resources. As a result the abundance and species
   richness of insect pollinators over the four years showed greater
   stability where forbs were also sown. Sward management also played a
   role in the persistence of floral resources, with grazing more likely to
   maintain legume cover than cutting. In conclusion, we demonstrate that
   low cost seed mixtures can be used to enhance floristic diversity to
   benefit pollinators, although the continued value of these grasslands
   over time is dependent on complementarity between sown legumes and
   forbs. As permanent grassland covers c. 40\% of the UK the enhancement
   of their floristic diversity has a huge potential to benefit insect
   pollinators. The type of land sharing approaches suggested here maintain
   modest agricultural productivity and so may be the most likely to
   achieve benefit to pollinators through wide-scale farmer uptake. (C)

Abstract = {{Processes such as competition and facilitation are believed to be
   important in defining pollination niches in species-rich plant
   communities. Species with similar floral phenotypes are expected to
   flower together where this facilitates pollination, while differences in
   floral phenology are expected if such flowers compete for pollinators.
   These expectations were tested at seven sites by comparing the observed
   co-flowering of plants with similar floral phenotypes with null model
   outcomes. Phenotypic classifications were evaluated using observations
   of plant-pollinator interactions. Pollinator guilds differed in the
   number of visits made to flowers in different floral colour and shape
   categories, indicating that such categories were ecologically relevant.
   For species with complex flowers, each floral category contained few
   species, so that the observed low occurrence of co-flowering could be
   explained by chance. In contrast, within phenotypic categories species
   with simple flowers bloomed together more than expected at three sites,
   but these overlaps could be explained by family membership. Most species
   with complex flowers could be segregated into unique pollination niches
   by broad floral colour and shape categories, so that there was little
   opportunity for competition between flowers within such categories.
   Species with simple floral phenotypes were less well defined by floral
   phenotype and phenology. Historical sorting may explain differences
   between complex flowers, while co-flowering between species with simple
   flowers requires further investigation. Differences found between
   species with simple and complex flowers suggest that levels of
   phenotypic specialisation should be taken into account in community
   level studies of pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. Selection on floral traits by pollinators is
   expected to play a key role in the diversification of floral phenotypes
   and the maintenance of species boundaries in sympatry. However,
   relatively few studies have tested the generality of these assumptions
   in natural systems, and fewer still have examined multiple phenotypes to
   better understand which ones are most important to pollinators.
   Methodology. We created F-2 hybrids between two sympatric species of
   dioecious Silene to segregate groups of floral characteristics from
   their associated pollination syndromes. Arrays of hybrid female plants
   were placed among natural field populations, where we observed native
   pollinators (diurnal and crepuscular) in order to address which
   individual traits or groups of traits influenced pollinator visitation,
   seed set, or predation. Pollinator visits included bees, bee flies,
   butterflies, and moths, including the mutualist nursery pollinator/seed
   predator Hadena bicruris.
   Pivotal results. Regardless of time of day, large flowers and tall
   plants had higher visitation rates. However, large flowers and tall
   plants were also more likely to be preyed on by H. bicruris. In all
   treatments, pollinators showed no preferences for flower color, despite
   the hypothesized general importance of color for pollinator attraction.
   Conclusions. Floral phenotypes are the result of both floral preferences
   by pollinators and antagonistic interactions with floral predators in
   this system. These findings provide further empirical evidence that
   floral traits may be important for maintaining species boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Plant interactions with mutualists and antagonists vary remarkably
   across space, and have played key roles in the ecology and evolution of
   flowering plants. One dominant form of spatial variation is human
   modification of the landscape, including urbanization and
   suburbanization. Our goal was to assess how suburbanization affected
   plant-animal interactions in Gelsemium sempervirens in the southeastern
   United States, including interactions with mutualists (pollination) and
   antagonists (nectar robbing and florivory). Based on differences in
   plant-animal interactions measured in multiple replicate sites, we then
   developed predictions for how these differences would affect patterns of
   natural selection, and we explored the patterns using measurements of
   floral and defensive traits in the field and in a common garden. We
   found that Gelsemium growing in suburban sites experienced more robbing
   and florivory as well as more heterospecific but not conspecific pollen
   transfer. Floral traits, particularly corolla length and width,
   influenced the susceptibility of plants to particular interactors.
   Observational data of floral traits measured in the field and in a
   common garden provided some supporting but also some conflicting
   evidence for the hypothesis that floral traits evolved in response to
   differences in species interactions in suburban vs. wild sites. However,
   the degree to which plants can respond to any one interactor may be
   constrained by correlations among floral morphological traits. Taken
   together, consideration of the broader geographic context in which
   organisms interact, in both suburban and wild areas, is fundamental to
   our understanding of the forces that shape contemporary plant-animal
   interactions and selection pressures in native species.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating insects are not only important in wild plant pollination,
   but also in the production of a large number of crops. Oilseed rape
   production is increasing globally due to demands for biofuels which may
   have impacts on pollinating insects which visit the crop and on the
   pollination services delivered to co-flowering wild plants. In this
   study, we tested (1) the degree of pollinator sharing between oilseed
   rape and native wild plants in field margins and hedgerows and (2) the
   effects of oilseed rape on the quality of pollination service delivered
   to these wild plants. We found large overlap between flower visitors of
   wild plants and oilseed rape, but the composition of species overlap
   differed with respect to each wild plant species. Nearly all individual
   visitors caught on both the crop and foraging on wild species carried
   crop pollen, but more than half the insects also carried pollen from
   wild plants. However, very little oilseed rape pollen was deposited on
   wild plant stigmas. This shows that (1) oilseed rape overlaps in
   pollinator niche with most co-flowering wild plants, and (2) crop pollen
   deposition on wild plant stigmas is low which may indicate that it is
   unlikely to cause reductions in seed set of wild plants, although this
   was not measured here. Furthermore, wild plants in field margins and
   hedgerows are important sources of alternative forage for pollinating
   insects even when a crop is mass flowering, and we suggest maintenance
   and augmentation of field margins and hedgerows to provide alternative
   forage for pollinator conservation to continue provision of pollination
   services to both crops and wild plants.}},

Abstract = {{Xylocopa species are large solitary bees, which are effective
   pollinators of yellow passion fruit, a self-incompatible crop dependent
   on pollination for fruit production and economic viability. We tested
   the mark-recapture method to estimate these bees' population size in a
   passion fruit commercial orchard in Central Brazil. We collected data
   during 3 years and population was estimated as 118, 339, and 1,032
   individuals. Population size and abundance of Xylocopa bees were higher
   in the last studied year. These bees maintained 32.5 \% of natural fruit
   set, above economic viability levels, and higher than other commercial
   orchards, although population size showed no direct correlation with
   natural fruit set. Improvement of nesting site may explain population
   increase, reinforcing the importance of management. Our results showed
   that the mark-recapture technique can provide reliable estimates of
   Xylocopa bees population size and, thus, be useful in monitoring
   population trends.}},

Abstract = {{Six faba bean gene-pools were cultivated to develop locally adapted
   genetic material for low-input (LI) systems that take advantage of the
   observed benefit of LI agriculture in pollinator density and diversity.
   Bee pollinators intensify selection on floral traits important in
   attraction and mechanical-fit but may also select for traits that
   increase seed set through outcrossing and aided selfing. Our research is
   focused on examining the impact of natural selection in crop performance
   under different pollination management strategies, taking into account
   traits relevant for the inter-phase plant and pollinator. Architectural
   and floral patterns are the result of natural selection and they reflect
   local adaptation to factors of the environment and adaptations to
   differences in pollination management strategy. However, seed production
   patterns seem to be affected by natural selection in an inconsistent
   way. Principal Component models showed a large proportion of the
   temporal variation accounted by plant height and number of open flowers
   and by floral shape and sexual dimensions. Discriminant Analysis
   indicated that plant architecture and floral traits related to
   pollinators are also the result of selection for particular patterns in
   each pollination management strategy. Flowers with an increase in the
   zygomorphy were favored under the open-pollination. Our work confirms
   the need for careful management of plant-pollinator inter-phase in faba
   bean breeding for LI systems.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting resources structure native bee communities and the availability

   Nesting rates of ground-nesting bees have proven challenging to assess
   due to a lack of standardized methods, We quantified the abundance of
   ground-nesting native bees using emergence traps over a seven-month
   study period. We then compared specimens captured in emergence traps
   with pan- and net-collected specimens. We hypothesized that
   ground-nesting bees would be highly similar to bees found foraging
   within our study site. However, the species assemblage of ground-nesting
   bees collected from emergence traps was significantly dissimilar from
   the assemblages collected with aerial nets and pan traps, indicating
   different sampling methods target different components of the species
   assemblage. We then examined the importance of nesting resources found
   at each emergence trap on the abundance of ground-nesting bees collected
   from emergence traps. Quantification of potential nesting resources,
   such as percent bare soil, has been proposed as a proxy of nesting
   habitat for ground-nesting guilds. Sloped ground and soil compaction
   were the most predictive nesting resources at the community-level.
   Further, spatial distribution of nesting resources within the study
   landscape also affected nesting rates, although this varied by species.
   Bees occurred in 85\% of emergence traps, with sampling date strongly
   affecting the number of bees collected. Emergence traps provide a useful

Abstract = {{Changes in plant diversity have consequences for higher trophic levels,
   e.g., higher plant diversity can enhance the reproduction and fitness of
   plant-associated insects. This response of higher trophic levels
   potentially depends on diversity-related changes in both resource
   quantity (abundance) and quality (nutritional content). The availability
   of elemental nutrients in plant resources is one aspect of nutritional
   quality, hut has rarely been addressed as a pathway relating plant
   diversity to associated insects. Using the experimental plant diversity
   gradient of a large biodiversity grassland project, the Jena-Experiment,
   we analysed the \%C, \%N and \%P and the molar ratios of those elements
   (C:N, C:P and N:P) in a pollinating bee, Chelostoma distinctum, and an
   herbivorous grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus, reared on plots of
   different plant diversity. Insects showed higher content of C. N and P

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction threatens biodiversity by reducing the amount of
   available resources and connectivity among geographic areas. For
   organisms living in fragmented habitats, population persistence may
   depend on dispersal, which maintains gene flow among fragments and can
   prevent inbreeding within them. It is centrally important to understand
   patterns of dispersal for bees living in fragmented areas given the
   importance of pollination systems and recently documented declines in
   bee populations. We used population and landscape genetic techniques to
   characterize patterns of dispersal over a large fragmented area in
   southern Costa Rica for the orchid bee species Euglossa championi.
   First, we estimated levels of genetic differentiation among forest
   fragments as (PT), an analog to the traditional summary statistic F-ST,
   as well as two statistics that may more adequately represent levels of
   differentiation, G'(ST) and D-est. Second, we used a Bayesian approach
   to determine the number and composition of genetic groups in our sample.
   Third we investigated how genetic differentiation changes with distance.
   Fourth, we determined the extent to which deforested areas restrict
   dispersal. Finally, we estimated the extent to which there were temporal
   differences in allele frequencies within the same forest fragments.
   Within years we found low levels of differentiation even over 80km, and
   no effect of land use type on level of genetic differentiation. However,
   we found significant genetic differentiation between years. Taken
   together our results suggest that there are high levels of gene flow

Abstract = {{<list list-type={''}1{''} id={''}icad12040-list-0001{''}> Bees are one
   of the most important groups of pollinators in the temperate zone.
   Although heavy metal pollution is recognised to be a problem affecting
   large parts of the European Union, we currently lack insights into the
   effects of heavy metals on wild bee survival and reproduction. We
   investigated the impact of heavy metal pollution on the wild bee Osmia
   rufa (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) by comparing their survival,
   reproduction and population dynamics along two independent gradients of
   heavy metal pollution, one in Poland and the other in the United
   Kingdom. We used trap nests to evaluate the response of fitness and
   survival parameters of O. rufa. To quantify the levels of pollution, we
   directly measured the heavy metal concentration in provisions collected
   by O. rufa. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration,
   there was a steady decrease in number of brood cells constructed by
   females and an increase in the proportion of dead offspring. In the most
   polluted site, there were typically 3-4 cells per female with 50-60\%
   dead offspring, whereas in unpolluted sites there were 8 to 10 cells per
   female and only 10-30\% dead offspring. Moreover, the bee population
   growth rate (R-0) decreased along the heavy metal pollution gradients.
   In unpolluted sites, R-0 was above 1, whereas in contaminated sites, the
   values tended to be below 1. Our findings reveal a negative relationship
   between heavy metal pollution and several fitness parameters of the wild
   bee O. rufa, and highlight a mechanism whereby the detrimental effects
   of heavy metal pollution may severely impact wild bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{The two widespread tropical Solanum species S.paniculatum and
   S.stramoniifolium are highly dependent on the visits of large bees that
   pollinate the flowers while buzzing them. Both Solanum species do not
   offer nectar reward; the rewarding of bees is thus solely dependent on
   the availability of pollen. Flower visitors are unable to visually
   assess the amount of pollen, because the pollen is hidden in poricidal
   anthers. In this study we ask whether and how the amount of pollen
   determines the attractiveness of flowers for bees. The number of pollen
   grains in anthers of S.stramoniifolium was seven times higher than in
   S.paniculatum. By contrast, the handling time per five flowers for
   carpenter bees visiting S.paniculatum was 3.5 times shorter than of
   those visiting S.stramoniifolium. As a result foraging carpenter bees
   collected a similar number of pollen grains per unit time on flowers of
   both species. Experimental manipulation of pollen availability by gluing
   the anther pores showed that the carpenter bees were unable to detect
   the availability of pollen by means of chemical cues before landing and
   without buzzing. Our study shows that the efficiency of pollen
   collecting on S.paniculatum is based on large inflorescences with short
   between-flower search times and short handling time of individual
   flowers, whereas that of S.stramoniifolium relies on a large amount of
   pollen per flower. Interestingly, large carpenter bees are able to
   adjust their foraging behaviour to drastically different strategies of
   pollen reward in otherwise very similar plant species.}},

   more than 90 \% of all pollen collected by each bee species. Despite

Abstract = {{Pollinator decline has been linked to landscape change, through both

   gives a simple method for exploring the effects of the removal of wild

Abstract = {{Most insects harbor two paralogous circadian genes, namely timeout and

   purifying selection than timeout, and timeout has positively selected
   sites in insects, especially in the Hymenoptera. Within the Hymenoptera,
   the function of timeout may be conserved in bees and ants, but still
   evolving rapidly in some wasps such as the chalcids. In fig wasps,
   timeout is rhythmically expressed only in females when outside of the

Abstract = {{Hofferia and Stenoheriades are closely related, species-poor genera of
   the osmiine bees (Megachilidae). Analysis of female pollen loads and
   field observations indicate that species of both genera have a strong
   affinity to Asteraceae as pollen hosts. Both genera use insect burrows
   in dead wood as nesting site, and Hofferia schmiedeknechti was found to
   build cell walls and nest plug with resin partly mixed with small
   pebbles. The taxonomic revision of the Palaearctic Hofferia and
   Stenoheriades species revealed the existence of a still undescribed
   species in the Levant, Stenoheriades levantica spec. nov.. Stenoheriades
   hofferi (Tkalcu, 1984) is synonymized with S. coelostoma (Benoist,
   1935), which is distinct from S. asiatica (Friese, 1921), and Heriades
   integra Benoist, 1934, formerly considered a Stenoheriades species, is
   synonymized with Osmia (Hoplosmia) scutellaris Morawitz, 1868. Keys for
   the delimitation of Hofferia and Stenoheriades from the other
   Palaearctic osmiine bee genera and for the identification of the

Title = {{Evaluating the Interacting Influences of Pollination, Seed Predation,
   Invasive Species and Isolation on Reproductive Success in a Threatened
   Alpine Plant}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Reproduction in rare plants may be influenced and limited by a complex
   combination of factors. External threats such as invasive species and
   landscape characteristics such as isolation may impinge on both
   pollination and seed predation dynamics, which in turn can strongly
   affect reproduction. I assessed how patterns in floral visitation, seed
   predation, invasive ant presence, and plant isolation influenced one
   another and ultimately affected viable seed production in Haleakala
   silverswords (Argyroxiphium sandwicense subsp. macrocephalum) of
   Hawai'i. Floral visitation was dominated by endemic Hylaeus bees, and
   patterns of visitation were influenced by floral display size and number
   of plants clustered together, but not by floral herbivory or nearest
   flowering neighbor distance. There was also some indication that
   Argentine ant presence impacted floral visitation, but contradictory
   evidence and limitations of the study design make this result uncertain.
   Degree of seed predation was associated only with plant isolation, with
   the two main herbivores partitioning resources such that one
   preferentially attacked isolated plants while the other attacked clumped
   plants; total seed predation was greater in more isolated plants. Net
   viable seed production was highly variable among individuals (0-55\%
   seed set), and was affected mainly by nearest neighbor distance,
   apparently owing to low cross-pollination among plants separated by even
   short distances (> 10-20 m). This isolation effect dominated net seed
   set, with no apparent influence from floral visitation rates, percent
   seed predation, or invasive ant presence. The measured steep decline in
   seed set with isolation distance may not be typical of the entire
   silversword range, and may indicate that pollinators in addition to
   Hylaeus bees could be important for greater gene flow. Management aimed
   at maintaining or maximizing silversword reproduction should focus on
   the spatial context of field populations and outplanting efforts, as
   well as on conserving the widest possible range of pollinator taxa.}},

   Lithurgus huberi in South America}},

Abstract = {{The wood-boring bee Lithurgus huberi Ducke (Apidae: Megachilinae:
   Lithurgini) is arguably an exotic species to South America. This
   solitary bee is the only representative in the Western Hemisphere of the
   Old World genus Lithurgus, and likely a conspecific with the
   Indo-Australian species Lithurgus atratus. L. huberi appears to have
   reached the continent at least 100 years ago, when it was discovered and
   described. Because this species seems to be oligolectic on pollen of
   Convolvulaceae flowers in South America, we attempted to integrate this
   biotic interaction (plant-bee relationships) to our species distribution
   model (SDM) procedures to predict its potential distribution in South
   America. The modeled distribution of seven L. huberi's host plant
   species did not improve the algorithms' ability to predict its
   distribution, but it produced constrained ranges. These results suggest
   that our biotic variables are not independent of the abiotic variables
   used (mostly related to climate). We employed five modeling algorithms,
   Envelope Score, GARP, Mahalanobis Distance, Support Vector Machines, and
   MaxEnt, but only the former two showed a good performance when
   predicting the occurrence of both, the host plant species and L. huberi.
   Our results indicate that this exotic pollinator is mainly distributed
   in eastern, northeastern, central, and southwestern South America, with
   few suitable areas in the Amazon region. We also highlight suitable
   areas for future surveys and present new occurrence records. (C) 2013

Title = {{Observational Conditioning in Flower Choice Copying by Bumblebees
   (Bombus terrestris): Influence of Observer Distance and Demonstrator
   Movement}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bumblebees use information provided inadvertently by
   conspecifics when deciding between different flower foraging options.
   Such social learning might be explained by relatively simple associative
   learning mechanism: the bee may learn to associate conspecifics with
   nectar or pollen reward through previous experience of foraging jointly.
   However, in some studies, observers were guided by choices of
   `demonstrators' viewed through a screen, so no reward was given to the
   observers at the time of seeing other bees' flowers choice and no
   demonstrator bee was present at the moment of decision. This behaviour,
   referred to observational conditioning, implies an additional
   associative step as the positive value of conspecific is transferred to
   the associated flower. Here we explore the role of demonstrator
   movement, and the distance between observers and demonstrators that is
   required for observation conditioning to take place.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We identify the conditions under which
   observational conditioning occurs in the widespread European species
   Bombus terrestris. The presence of artificial demonstrator bees leads to
   a significant change in individual colour preference toward the
   indicated colour if demonstrators were moving and observation distance
   was limited (15 cm), suggesting that observational conditioning could
   only influence relatively short-range foraging decisions. In addition,
   the movement of demonstrators is a crucial factor for observational
   conditioning, either due to the more life-like appearance of moving
   artificial bees or an enhanced detectability of moving demonstrators,
   and an increased efficiency at directing attention to the indicated
   flower colour.
   Conclusion: Bumblebees possess the capacity to learn the quality of a
   flower by distal observation of other foragers' choices. This confirms
   that social learning in bees involves more advanced processes than
   simple associative learning, and indicates that observational
   conditioning might be widespread in pollinating insects, raising
   intriguing questions for the underlying mechanisms as well as the spread
   of social information in pollinator-plant interactions.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1776}},

Abstract = {{Although pollinators can play a central role in determining the
   structure and stability of plant communities, little is known about how
   their adaptive foraging behaviours at the individual level, e. g. flower
   constancy, structure these interactions. Here, we construct a
   mathematical model that integrates individual adaptive foraging
   behaviour and population dynamics of a community consisting of two plant
   species and a pollinator species. We find that adaptive foraging at the
   individual level, as a complementary mechanism to adaptive foraging at
   the species level, can further enhance the coexistence of plant species
   through niche partitioning between conspecific pollinators. The
   stabilizing effect is stronger than that of unbiased generalists when
   there is also strong competition between plant species over other
   resources, but less so than that of multiple specialist species. This
   suggests that adaptive foraging in mutualistic interactions can have a
   very different impact on the plant community structure from that in
   predator-prey interactions. In addition, the adaptive behaviour of
   individual pollinators may cause a sharp regime shift for invading plant
   species. These results indicate the importance of integrating individual
   adaptive behaviour and population dynamics for the conservation of
   native plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between flowers and pollinators are generally considered
   cases of mutualism since both agents gain benefits. Fine-tuned
   adaptations are usually found in the form of strict one-to-one
   coevolution between species. Many insect pollinators are, however,
   considered generalists, visiting numerous kinds of flowers, and many
   flower species (angiosperms) are also considered generalists, visited by
   many insect pollinators. We here describe a fine-tuned coevolutionary
   state of a flower-visiting bee that collects both nectar and pollen from
   an early spring flower visited by multiple pollinators. Detailed
   morphology of the bee proboscis is shown to be finely adjusted to the
   floral morphology and nectar production of the flower. Behavioral
   observations also confirm the precision of this mutualism. Our results
   suggest that a fine-tuned one-to-one coevolutionary state between a
   flower species and a pollinator species might be common, but frequently
   overlooked, in multiple flower-pollinator interactions.}},

Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: For successful cultivation and conservation of plants a
   detailed knowledge of their reproductive biology is required. The
   reproductive features of trees are important to determine the diversity
   patterns and community structure of tropical forests. The present study
   on reproductive biology of Pittosporum dasycaulon, a rare medicinal
   tree, was conducted in the shola forests of Vaghamon hills, one of the
   foot hills of Southern Western Ghats of India from 2008-2011.
   Results: The plant flowers profusely during February to April.
   Inflorescence is a raceme and the total number of flowers per
   inflorescence varies from 96-217. The flowers are comparatively small,
   hermaphrodite, short pedicellate, complete, zygomorphic, pentamerous,
   polypetalous, hypogynous and light cream in colour with an average
   length of 1.14 cm. Anthesis started at 08.30 h and the flowers were
   completely opened at approximately 09.30 h followed by anther
   deshiscence at 10.00-11.30 h. The pollen grains were trizonocolpate with
   45 +/- 5.6 mu m in size.
   Acetocarmine staining showed 66 +/- 6\% fertile pollen at the time of
   anther dehiscence. The number of pollen grains in an anther is 5246 +/-
   845 and per flower is 26230 +/- 1021. The stigma is wet, non-papillate,
   capitate and contains a thin film of exudates under the light
   microscope. The superior ovary is densely covered with papillate hairs
   and containing 3-8 ovules. The important floral visitors include bees
   and butterflies. The plant is self-incompatible and an out crosser.
   Fruit set under open-pollination was poor (24\%) with 58.3\% fruits
   having seeds inside. There was no fruit set in manually self pollinated
   flowers while over 57\% of the cross pollinated flowers set fruits.
   Conclusions: Our study presents a detailed account on reproductive
   biology of this medicinal tree which may help in the conservation and
   genetic improvement of this particular taxa.}},

Abstract = {{We studied community structures of mainly threatened types of sandy dry
   grassland, and those of flower-visiting wild bees, in successional,
   non-ruderal or ruderal gradients in the Upper Rhine Valley (Germany).
   We searched for congruent characteristics in the floristic/faunistic
   structure of plant and bee species, and for differences between two
   study years. We also asked which vegetation type or complex plays the
   most important role as a pollen or nectar resource for wild bees, and
   what conclusions can be drawn for nature conservation. The vegetation
   types or complexes range from basiphytic pioneer stages to consolidated
   basiphytic to slightly acidophytic grasslands (classes
   Koelerio-Corynephoretea and Festuco-Brometea): Koelerion glaucae complex
   (1), Armerio-Festucetum trachyphyllae (2a, typical; 2b, ruderalized),
   ruderalized ex-arable field (3), and Allio-Stipetum capillatae (4).
   We used a plot-based approach for recording vegetation data and
   flower-visiting wild bees. Releves were sampled and flower-visiting bees
   netted on defined flower resources (2004, 2005). Data were analyzed by
   ordination, mixed linear models and regression analysis.
   Phytosociological table and DCA show clear floristic differentiations
   between the vegetation types and complexes. For the bee data there were
   weaker species-based differentiations. In the year 2004 there were two
   bee assemblages, in the year 2005 this differentiation was not
   detectable. The most species- and individual-rich wild-bee populations
   were detected in the vegetation types 2b, 3 and 4. These types were
   characterized by a high diversity of entomophilous plant species in
   combination with high flower density. Although ruderalized sandy
   grasslands have only moderate conservation value based on vegetation
   characteristics, they offer remarkable resources for species-rich
   populations of wild bees. Important flower resources for endangered
   wild-bee species are, among others, Centaurea stoebe s.l., Berteroa
   incana and Carduus nutans.
   The diversity characteristics of the studied vegetation types or
   complexes do not always correspond to those of the flower-visiting bees,
   which should be taken into account in developing conservation
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of study: Floral thermogenesis is an unusual floral trait with a
   well-documented physiological process, and yet, there is limited
   understanding of how this trait influences plant reproduction. The
   current study was undertaken to gain a better understanding of how
   floral thermogenesis in Nelumbo lutea impacts pollinator attraction and
   consequent plant reproduction.
   Methods: We conducted field studies on floral thermogenesis and
   thermoregulation, flower sexual development, floral visitation patterns,
   breeding system, pollen transfer dynamics, and floral scent production.
   Key results: The most abundant visitors to the thermoregulatory flowers
   included the Phoridae (Diptera), Chrysomelidae (Coleoptera), and
   Hymenoptera. Chrysomelid beetles, particularly Diabrotica, were frequent
   visitors to both first-day female-and second-day bisexual-phase flowers,
   while phorid flies were most common in bisexual-phase flowers. Pollen
   transfer experiments indicated that Diabrotica was equally effective in
   depositing pollen on stigmas, as were the less frequent, but
   pollen-loaded halictid bees.
   Conclusions: Flowers received a taxonomically wide assemblage of floral
   visitors and appear adapted to attract beetles, primarily Chrysomelidae
   and medium-sized bees. This study is the first to provide strong support
   that beetles can comprise the dominant portion of floral visitors and
   are as effective in pollen transfer as bees. Thermogenesis aids in
   dispersing the main floral scent
   component-1,4-dimethoxybenzene-attracting both chrysomelids and bees,
   while thermoregulation causes chrysomelid beetles to actively seek out
   new flowers for evening residence. This search behavior likely results
   in chrysomelids affecting cross-pollination.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{32-43}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of Annonaceae are characterized by fleshy petals, many stamens
   with hard connective shields and numerous carpels with sessile stigmas
   often covered by sticky secretions. The petals of many representatives
   during anthesis form a closed pollination chamber. Protogynous dichogamy
   with strong scent emissions especially during the pistillate stage is a
   character of nearly all species. Scent emissions can be enhanced by
   thermogenesis. The prevailing reproductive system in the family seems to
   be self-compatibility. The basal genus Anaxagorea besides exhibiting
   several ancestral morphological characters has also many characters
   which reappear in other genera. Strong fruit-like scents consisting of
   fruit-esters and alcohols mainly attract small fruit-beetles (genus
   Colopterus, Nitidulidae) as pollinators, as well as several other
   beetles (Curculionidae, Chrysomelidae) and fruit-flies (Drosophilidae),
   which themselves gnaw on the thick petals or their larvae are petal or
   ovule predators. The flowers and the thick petals are thus a floral
   brood substrate for the visitors and the thick petals of Anaxagorea have
   to be interpreted as an antipredator structure. Another function of the
   closed thick petals is the production of heat by accumulated starch,
   which enhances scent emission and provides a warm shelter for the
   attracted beetles. Insight into floral characters and floral ecology of
   Anaxagorea, the sister group of the rest of the Annonaceae, is
   particularly important for understanding functional evolution and
   diversification of the family as a whole. As beetle pollination
   (cantharophily) is plesiomorphic in Anaxagorea and in Annonaceae,
   characters associated with beetle pollination appear imprinted in
   members of the whole family. Pollination by beetles (cantharophily) is
   the predominant mode of the majority of species worldwide. Examples are
   given of diurnal representatives (e.g., Guatteria, Duguetia, Annona)
   which function on the basis of fruit-imitating flowers attracting mainly
   fruit-inhabiting nitidulid beetles, as well as nocturnal species (e.g.,
   large-flowered Annona and Duguetia species), which additionally to most
   of the diurnal species exhibit strong flower warming and provide very
   thick petal tissues for the voracious dynastid scarab beetles
   (Dynastinae, Scarabaeidae). Further examples will show that a few
   Annonaceae have adapted in their pollination also to thrips, flies,
   cockroaches and even bees. Although this non-beetle pollinated species
   have adapted in flower structure and scent compounds to their respective
   insects, they still retain some of the specialized cantharophilous
   characters of their ancestors.}},

   pollen-filled anthers-providing the first demonstration that Ni is
   accumulated in pollinator rewards. Further, S. polygaloides grown in
   Ni-supplemented soils received fewer visits per flower per hour from
   both bees and flies (both na < ve to Ni-rich floral resources in the
   study area) relative to plants grown in control soils, although the
   probability a plant was visited initially was unaffected by Ni
   treatment. Our findings show that while Ni-rich floral rewards decrease
   floral visitation, floral visitors are not completely deterred, so some
   floral visitors may collect and ingest potentially toxic resources from
   metal-hyperaccumulating plants. In addition to broadening our
   understanding of the effects of metal accumulation on ecological
   interactions in natural populations, these results have implications for
   the use of insect-pollinated plants in phytoremediation.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of land use and management on plant and pollinator diversity at

   available on the spatial and temporal aspects of plant-pollinator
   mutualist diversity relative to farm management. Information on these
   aspects will provide a better understanding of agri-environment schemes

   partitioning (sum of within and among community diversity) to determine
   local (alpha) diversity and spatial and temporal (beta) diversity of
   bees and flowering plants in differently managed vineyards and adjacent
   natural vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot.
   Alpha, spatial beta and temporal beta diversities accounted for 18-61\%,
   19-72\% and 7-36\% of total bee diversity, respectively. Local diversity
   and spatial turnover of flowering plant diversity were significantly
   higher in the natural vegetation compared with organic and conventional
   vineyards. Spatial turnover of bees varied significantly with
   longitudinal coordinates of study sites. We show that wildlife-friendly
   management practices ensure species-rich plant communities that promote
   pollinator diversity. We demonstrate the necessity to conserve mosaics
   of natural and semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes to

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid pesticides are currently implicated in the decline of wild
   bee populations. Bumble bees, Bombus spp., are important wild
   pollinators that are detrimentally affected by ingestion of
   neonicotinoid residues. To date, imidacloprid has been the major focus
   of study into the effects of neonicotinoids on bumble bee health, but
   wild populations are increasingly exposed to alternative neonicotinoids
   such as thiamethoxam. To investigate whether environmentally realistic
   levels of thiamethoxam affect bumble bee performance over a realistic
   exposure period, we exposed queenless microcolonies of Bombus terrestris
   L workers to a wide range of dosages up to 98 mu g kg(-1) in dietary
   syrup for 17 days. Results showed that bumble bee workers survived fewer
   days when presented with syrup dosed at 98 mu g thiamethoxam kg(-1),
   while production of brood (eggs and larvae) and consumption of syrup and
   pollen in microcolonies were significantly reduced by thiamethoxam only
   at the two highest concentrations (39, 98 mu g kg(-1)). In contrast, we
   found no detectable effect of thiamethoxam at levels typically found in
   the nectars of treated crops (between 1 and 11 mu g kg(-1)). By
   comparison with published data, we demonstrate that during an exposure
   to field-realistic concentrations lasting approximately two weeks, brood
   production in worker bumble bees is more sensitive to imidacloprid than
   thiamethoxam. We speculate that differential sensitivity arises because
   imidacloprid produces a stronger repression of feeding in bumble bees
   than thiamethoxam, which imposes a greater nutrient limitation on
   production of brood. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   weighting visitation by the amount of conspecific pollen delivered per

   presumed pollinators, solitary bees and flies contributed substantially
   (42\%) to pollination. In manipulations of one trait at a time, insects
   visited flowers presenting the natural colour and shape over flowers
   manipulated to present artificial mutants with either paler colour or a
   more open or more tubular flower. When both colour and shape were
   manipulated in combination, selection on both traits arose, with
   bumblebees responding mainly to colour and flies responding mainly to
   shape. Despite selection on both floral traits, in a year with many
   bumblebees, we saw no evidence for correlational selection of these

Abstract = {{Insect pollination is important for food production globally and apples
   are one of the major fruit crops which are reliant on this ecosystem
   service. It is fundamentally important that the full range of benefits
   of insect pollination to crop production are understood, if the costs of
   interventions aiming to enhance pollination are to be compared against
   the costs of the interventions themselves. Most previous studies have
   simply assessed the benefits of pollination to crop yield and ignored
   quality benefits and how these translate through to economic values. In
   the present study we examine the influence of insect pollination
   services on farmgate output of two important UK apple varieties; Gala
   and Cox. Using field experiments, we quantify the influence of insect
   pollination on yield and importantly quality and whether either may be
   limited by sub-optimal insect pollination. Using an expanded bioeconomic
   model we value insect pollination to UK apple production and establish
   the potential for improvement through pollination service management. We
   show that insects are essential in the production of both varieties of
   apple in the UK and contribute a total of 36.7 pound million per annum,
   over 6 pound million more than the value calculated using more
   conventional dependence ratio methods. Insect pollination not only
   affects the quantity of production but can also have marked impacts on
   the quality of apples, influencing size, shape and effecting their
   classification for market. These effects are variety specific however.
   Due to the influence of pollination on both yield and quality in Gala,
   there is potential for insect pollination services to improve UK output
   by up to 5.7 pound million per annum. Our research shows that continued
   pollinator decline could have serious financial implications for the
   apple industry but there is considerable scope through management of
   wild pollinators or using managed pollinator augmentation, to improve
   the quality of production. Furthermore, we show that it is critically
   important to consider all production parameters including quality,
   varietal differences and management costs when valuing the pollination
   service of any crop so investment in pollinator management can be
   proportional to its contribution. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Land use is known to reduce the diversity of species and complexity of

   pollinator species on 166 plant species. Species-specific plant and
   pollinator responses to land use were significantly predicted by the
   weighted average land-use response of each species' partners. Moreover,
   more specialized pollinators were more vulnerable than generalists. Both
   predictions are based on the relative interaction strengths provided by
   the observed interaction network. Losses in flower and pollinator

Abstract = {{Declining plant species richness in agro-ecosystems and thus reduced

   leading to reduced pollination and biological control. Here we test if
   plant diversity can affect arthropod diversity and abundance on a very
   small scale, manipulating plant species richness (2, 6, 12 and 20 sown
   species) in small adjacent subplots (6 x 9 m) in 10 wildflower strips in
   an agricultural landscape. We simultaneously analyzed the effect of
   plant species richness, vegetation structure, and plant composition on
   the species richness and abundance of cavity-nesting wild bees, wasps,
   their prey and natural enemies, and on the structure of their food webs.
   By separating the trap-nesting species into functional groups according
   to their prey, we aimed to understand the underlying patterns for the
   effects of plant diversity. Increasing plant species richness had a
   significant effect only on spider-predating wasps, the group of wasps
   trophically most distant from plants. In contrast, bees and food-web
   structure were unaffected by plant diversity. Spider-predating wasp
   abundance negatively correlated with the abundance of spiders,
   suggesting top-down control. Interestingly, the abundance of spiders was
   the only variable that was strongly affected by plant composition. The
   hypothesis that the effect of plant diversity decreases with increasing

Abstract = {{1Many flowering plant species have a facultative or obligate dependence
   on insect pollination for reproductive success. Anthropogenic
   disturbance may alter these species interactions, but the extent to
   which structural changes to plant-pollinator networks affect plant
   species mating systems is not well understood. We used long-term
   livestock grazing of a birch wood ecosystem to test whether disturbance
   of this semi-natural habitat altered floral resources, the structure of
   plant-insect visitation networks and the mating system of a focal plant
   species, Cirsium palustre. Grazed habitat had a higher species richness
   of floral resources for pollinators. Visitation networks in grazed
   habitats were larger, more diverse, with an increase in the number of
   pollinators per plant species. Controlling for sampling effects,
   however, showed networks in grazed habitats were less nested and
   revealed a positive correlation between network connectance and floral
   species richness. Network connectance was negatively related to
   C.palustre outcrossing rate within grazed and ungrazed sites. However,
   on average, the effects of grazing, including greater mean connectance,
   produced higher overall outcrossing rates and more pollen donors
   compared with ungrazed habitat. The number of different pollen donors,
   spatial genetic structure and mating among close relatives were all
   correlated with greater extent of suitable C.palustre habitat in the
   landscape, consistent with the effects of increasing plant population
   size but limited seed dispersal. Pre-adaptation of C.palustre to
   disturbance coupled with a preponderance of highly dispersive flies
   attracted to the greater food resources in grazed habitat is a likely
   mechanism underpinning this increased pollen transport. Habitat
   modification by long-term mammalian grazing fundamentally shifted
   visitation network structure and the state of a plant mating system,
   indicating how ecosystem disturbance can cascade across levels of
   biological organization through altered interspecific interactions.
   Cirsium palustre retains flexibility to bias reproduction towards
   selfing where pollen donor diversity is limited; such reproductive
   flexibility may be an important mechanism structuring plant populations
   in human-modified landscapes.}},

   services are crucial to world-wide crop production. Understanding
   national patterns in the spatial structure of natural pest control and

   Functional diversity represents the value and range of morphological and
   behavioural traits that support ecosystem services. We modelled the rate
   at which functional diversity collapsed in response to species
   extinctions to provide an index of functional redundancy. Deficits in
   functional diversity for both pest control and pollination were found in
   areas of high arable crop production. Ground beetle functional
   redundancy was positively correlated with the landscape cover of
   semi-natural habitats where extinctions were ordered by body size and
   dispersal ability. For bees, functional redundancy showed a weak
   positive correlation with semi-natural habitat cover where species
   extinctions were ordered by feeding specialization.Synthesis and
   applications. Increasingly, evidence suggests that functionally diverse
   assemblages of ground beetles and bees may be a key element to

Abstract = {{Flowering plants employ a wide variety of signals, including scent, to
   attract the attention of pollinators. In this study we investigated the
   role of floral scent in mediating differential attraction between two
   species of monkeyflowers (Mimulus) reproductively isolated by pollinator
   preference. The emission rate and chemical identity of floral volatiles
   differ between the bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and the
   hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis. Mimulus lewisii flowers produce an
   array of volatiles dominated by D-limonene, beta-myrcene and
   E-beta-ocimene. Of these three monoterpenes, M. cardinalis flowers
   produce only D-limonene, released at just 0.9\% the rate of M. lewisii
   flowers. Using the Bombus vosnesenskii bumblebee, an important
   pollinator of M. lewisii, we conducted simultaneous gas chromatography
   with extracellular recordings in the bumblebee antennal lobe. Results
   from these experiments revealed that these three monoterpenes evoke
   significant neural responses, and that a synthetic mixture of the three
   volatiles evokes the same responses as the natural scent. Furthermore,
   the neural population shows enhanced responses to the M. lewisii scent
   over the scent of M. cardinalis. This neural response is reflected in
   behavior; in two-choice assays, bumblebees investigate artificial
   flowers scented with M. lewisii more frequently than ones scented with
   M. cardinalis, and in synthetic mixtures the three monoterpenes are
   necessary and sufficient to recapitulate responses to the natural scent
   of M. lewisii. In this system, floral scent alone is sufficient to
   elicit differential visitation by bumblebees, implying a strong role of
   scent in the maintenance of reproductive isolation between M. lewisii
   and M. cardinalis.}},

   Recruitment Dancing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 27}},
Abstract = {{Predators can reduce bee pollination and plant fitness through
   successful predation and non-consumptive effects. In honey bees,
   evidence of predation or a direct attack can decrease recruitment
   dancing and thereby magnify the effects of individual predation attempts
   at a colony level. However, actual predation attempts and successes are
   relatively rare. It was not known if a far more common event, just
   detection of a predator, could inhibit recruitment. We began by testing
   honey bees' avoidance of the praying mantis (Tenodera sinensis). Larger
   predators (later mantis instars, >= 4.5 cm in body length) elicited
   significantly more avoidance (1.3 fold) than smaller mantis instars.
   Larger instars also attempted to capture honey bees significantly more
   often than did smaller instars. Foragers could detect and avoid mantises
   based upon mantis odor (74\% of bees avoided an odor extract) or visual
   appearance (67\% avoided a mantis model). Finally, foragers decreased
   recruitment dancing by 1.8 fold for a food source with a live adult
   mantis, even when they were not attacked. This reduction in recruitment
   dancing, elicited by predator presence alone, expands our understanding
   of predator non-consumptive effects and of cascading ecosystem effects
   for plants served by an important generalist pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination improves the yield of most crop species and contributes to
   one-third of global crop production, but comprehensive benefits
   including crop quality are still unknown. Hence, pollination is
   underestimated by international policies, which is particularly alarming
   in times of agricultural intensification and diminishing pollination
   services. In this study, exclusion experiments with strawberries showed
   bee pollination to improve fruit quality, quantity and market value
   compared with wind and self-pollination. Bee-pollinated fruits were
   heavier, had less malformations and reached higher commercial grades.
   They had increased redness and reduced sugar-acid-ratios and were
   firmer, thus improving the commercially important shelf life. Longer
   shelf life reduced fruit loss by at least 11\%. This is accounting for
   0.32 billion US\$ of the 1.44 billion US\$ provided by bee pollination
   to the total value of 2.90 billion US\$ made with strawberry selling in
   the European Union 2009. The fruit quality and yield effects are driven
   by the pollination-mediated production of hormonal growth regulators,
   which occur in several pollination-dependent crops. Thus, our
   comprehensive findings should be transferable to a wide range of crops
   and demonstrate bee pollination to be a hitherto underestimated but
   vital and economically important determinant of fruit quality.}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator-plant relationships are found to be particularly vulnerable
   to land use change. Yet despite extensive research in agricultural and
   natural systems, less attention has focused on these interactions in
   neighboring urban areas and its impact on pollination services. We
   investigated pollinator-plant interactions in a peri-urban landscape on
   the outskirts of the San Francisco Bay Area, California, where urban,
   agricultural, and natural land use types interface. We made standardized
   observations of floral visitation and measured seed set of yellow
   starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis), a common grassland invasive, to
   test the hypotheses that increasing urbanization decreases 1) rates of
   bee visitation, 2) viable seed set, and 3) the efficiency of pollination
   (relationship between bee visitation and seed set). We unexpectedly
   found that bee visitation was highest in urban and agricultural land use
   contexts, but in contrast, seed set rates in these human-altered
   landscapes were lower than in natural sites. An explanation for the
   discrepancy between floral visitation and seed set is that higher plant
   diversity in urban and agricultural areas, as a result of more
   introduced species, decreases pollinator efficiency. If these patterns
   are consistent across other plant species, the novel plant communities
   created in these managed landscapes and the generalist bee species that
   are favored by human-altered environments will reduce pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are generally assumed to be in decline but a proper habitat
   management could help to conserve pollination services. In 2012 we
   surveyed the groundcover in nine cider-apple orchards to (I) identify
   the floral and faunal communities present in the ground floor, (II)
   assess the attractiveness of the local spontaneous flowers to insects
   and (III) determine the role that the flower community may play for the
   conservation of the associated arthropods in general and of pollinators
   in particular. The apple orchards provided a continuous succession of
   floral resources in the groundcover with differences among orchards in
   the abundance, richness and diversity of flowers. Flowering plant
   species were visited by a wide variety of insects, mostly from the
   orders Hymenoptera (70\%) and Diptera (25\%). Wild bees accounted for
   27\% of hymenopterans and hoverflies for 30\% of dipterans. Flowering
   plants differed in the number of taxa they attracted and in their
   attractiveness for particular insect groups and for insects as a whole.
   A total of 16,159 arthropods were collected from the groundcover, and
   2064 individuals belonged to taxa involved in the pollination.
   Pollinators and arthropods (exemplified by hemipterans and coleopterans)
   differed between orchards and periods and were affected by the plant
   community. Plant species richness and the abundance of some plant
   species favored the presence of both pollinators and arthropod
   assemblages while flower abundance had only a marginal effect on those
   communities. Pollinators were also affected by plant diversity.
   Among-orchard differences in the plant community suggest that management
   recommendations must be site-specific to ensure the permanent
   availability of diverse floral resources for the arthropod community and
   for pollinators in particular. Therefore, a proper groundcover
   management could provide benefits for apple growers by improving
   pollination services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are a key component of biodiversity as they ensure a crucial
   ecosystem service: pollination. This ecosystem service is nowadays
   threatened, because bees suffer from agricultural intensification. Yet,
   bees rarely benefit from the measures established to promote
   biodiversity in farmland, such as agri-environment schemes (AES). We
   experimentally tested if the spatio-temporal modification of mowing
   regimes within extensively managed hay meadows, a widespread AES, can
   promote bees. We applied a randomized block design, replicated 12 times
   across the Swiss lowlands, that consisted of three different mowing
   treatments: 1) first cut not before 15 June (conventional regime for
   meadows within Swiss AES); 2) first cut not before 15 June, as treatment
   1 but with 15\% of area left uncut serving as a refuge; 3) first cut not
   before 15 July. Bees were collected with pan traps, twice during the
   vegetation season (before and after mowing). Wild bee abundance and
   species richness significantly increased in meadows where uncut refuges
   were left, in comparison to meadows without refuges: there was both an
   immediate (within year) and cumulative (from one year to the following)
   positive effect of the uncut refuge treatment. An immediate positive
   effect of delayed mowing was also evidenced in both wild bees and honey
   bees. Conventional AES could easily accommodate such a simple management
   prescription that promotes farmland biodiversity and is likely to
   enhance pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollination is essential for the reproductive success of many
   wild and crop plants. Loss and isolation of (semi-) natural habitats in
   agricultural landscapes can cause declines of plants and pollinators and
   endanger pollination services. We investigated the independent effects
   of these drivers on pollination of young cherry trees in a
   landscape-scale experiment. We included (i) isolation of study trees
   from other cherry trees (up to 350 m), (ii) the amount of cherry trees
   in the landscape, (iii) the isolation from other woody habitats (up to
   200 m) and (iv) the amount of woody habitats providing nesting and
   floral resources for pollinators. At the local scale, we considered
   effects of (v) cherry flower density and (vi) heterospecific flower
   density. Pollinators visited flowers more often in landscapes with high
   amount of woody habitat and at sites with lower isolation from the next
   cherry tree. Fruit set was reduced by isolation from the next cherry
   tree and by a high local density of heterospecific flowers but did not
   directly depend on pollinator visitation. These results reveal the
   importance of considering the plant's need for conspecific pollen and
   its pollen competition with co-flowering species rather than focusing
   only on pollinators' habitat requirements and flower visitation. It
   proved to be important to disentangle habitat isolation from habitat
   loss, local from landscape-scale effects, and direct effects of pollen
   availability on fruit set from indirect effects via pollinator
   visitation to understand the delivery of an agriculturally important
   ecosystem service.}},

Abstract = {{An on-farm pollination experiment was conducted during the June-August
   and November-February blooming seasons of 2007 to 2008, in 30
   small-scale coffee fields characterised by different habitat and
   vegetation types. The study was conducted in order to determine the best
   pollinator groups for coffee in Uganda and to collect relevant field
   information and determine the pollination efficiency of different bee
   species. Results indicate that across blooming seasons, coffee flowers
   were visited by 24-36 bee species. Hypotrigona gribodoi was the most
   frequent flower visitor, comprising over 60\% of 5941 bee-visits
   recorded. Foraging rate and pollination speed varied among bee species.
   Solitary bees foraged on more flowers than social bees, but they spent
   less time per flower visited. Solitary bees visited more coffee trees
   and fields, but deposited less pollen, whereas social bees visited less
   trees and coffee fields in the landscape, but deposited more pollen on
   flowers. Fruit set was of 87\%, 64\% and 0.9\%, respectively, in
   hand-cross pollination, open pollination and controlled-pollination
   treatments. Fruit abortion due to self-pollination was insignificant in
   this study. There was variability in pollination efficiency of different
   bee species. Pollination efficiency varied more significantly with
   sociality than with other bee functional traits and was not
   significantly influenced by tongue length and bee body size.
   Single-flower visits by social and solitary bees resulted in 89.7\% and
   68.14\% fruit set, respectively. The most efficient bee species was
   Meliponula ferruginea (98.3\%) followed by Meliponula nebulata (97.1\%).
   Thus, very good pollinator species were wild social bees (mainly
   stingless bees) as opposed to honeybees and solitary bees that were
   previously reported to be the best pollinators of coffee in Panama and
   Indonesia. Morphological and anatomical characteristics of the bee
   pollen storage features may explain the difference in foraging behaviour
   activities and in pollination efficiency of social and solitary
   afrotropical bee species visiting lowland coffee in Uganda. In addition,
   pollination efficiency was influenced by land-use intensity, field
   management systems and habitat types found in the immediate surroundings
   of coffee fields, but not by coffee field size, coffee genotypes and
   mass blooming wild vegetation. It is recommended to farmers to adopt
   pollinator-friendly conservation and farming practices such as keeping
   an uncultivated portion (25\%-30\%) of their farms as pollinator
   reservoirs, protecting semi-natural habitats found in the vicinity of
   coffee fields, as well as promoting high on-farm tree cover to benefit a
   functionally diverse pollinator community.}},

   are important for pollen collection to achieve hybridization and get
   good seed set. Based on viable seed formation and per cent germination
   in different pollination treatments studied, pollinations using bumble
   bee thorax was most successful. No stevia pollen was observed to be

Abstract = {{Cities provide resources for the animals that live in them or their
   surroundings. There has been an increase in the number of ecological
   studies in urban areas, including interactions between plants and bees.
   Bees are pollinators that provide a vital ecosystem service to crops and
   wild plants. We assessed plant community structure in the campus of
   Universidade de Sao Paulo in Ribeirao Preto, Brazil, included in the
   neotropical Atlantic Forest biome, focusing on floristic composition,
   pollination syndromes, flowering phenology, and spatiotemporal
   distribution of floral resources for bees. Currently, the city is
   surrounded by sugar cane plantations. Once a month, from April 2011 to
   March 2012, we sampled plant species and individuals in bloom in an area
   with 500 m radius from the bee-rearing facilities of Faculdade de
   Filosofia, Ciencias e Letras de Ribeirao Preto (FFCLRP), totaling 78
   hectares. We sampled 289 plant species of 73 families; Leguminosae was
   the richest family. Plants pollinated by bees predominated (67\%),
   followed by plants pollinated by hummingbirds (18\%). Melittophilous
   species flowered throughout the year and, hence, food availability for
   bees was continuous. The flowering of plant individuals that provided
   pollen, nectar, and floral oil was seasonal in all vegetation (except
   for nectar in shrubs), with peaks in resource availability in the
   transition from the dry to the rainy season, and also in the rainy
   season. Our results show that the campus is able to maintain bee
   populations amid a monoculture matrix, acting as a refuge. In addition,
   it provides a list of several attractive native plants to different
   pollinator groups, coupled with a phenogram, that can be used in the
   design and planning of urban areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{In long-lived plants, sexual expression can be highly variable in time
   and space. The extent to which sexual dimorphism of flowers is expressed
   in the same or in separate individuals, may have implications for the
   plants' dependence on pollen vectors, the compatibility of the pollen
   received, and the potential for setting fruit. Here, we account for
   variability in sexual expression in the small tree Acacia caven, which
   produces hermaphrodite and male flowers on the same or in separate
   individuals. We focus on whether individual sexual expression influences
   fruit set, which latter has been reported to be extremely low in this
   species. Individual sexual expression, estimated as the hermaphrodite:
   male flowers ratio was variable both within and among plants across two
   reproductive seasons. Though male flower production could be very high
   (up to 99\% of the flowers), all trees produced both flower types within
   the same individual, thus confirming andromonoecy in this species. More
   interestingly, hermaphrodite: male flowers ratio had a negative effect
   on fruit set. This pattern was consistent across two reproductive
   seasons and suggests that maleness should favor female function. Similar
   trends found in other plant species with the same sexual system support
   the hypothesis that male flowers of andromonoecious species may
   contribute to reduce self-pollen interference compared with
   hermaphrodite flowers. By favoring the deposition of compatible pollen
   grains and increasing fruit set, maleness would then help to maintain
   andromonoecy in this and other andromonoecious species. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In dichogamous species, it is necessary that pollinators are attracted
   both to male- and female-phase flowers in order to achieve effective
   cross-pollination. We investigated, over a two-year period, how nectar
   production and composition differs in protandrous flowers of Aconitum
   lycoctonum L and Aconitum carmichaelii Debeaux, two species originating
   from different geographical regions. Flowers of A. carmichaelii secreted
   approx. 2.5-fold more nectar than flowers of A. lycoctonum. The nectar
   of A. carmichaelii was sucrose-dominant (87.6:9.5:2.9,
   sucrose:fructose:glucose), whereas sucrose-rich nectar, lacking glucose,
   occurred in A. lycoctonum (39.9:60.1, sucrose:fructose). Total sugar
   concentration was similar (53\%, on average) in both species. These
   species also showed contrasting patterns in nectar production and
   composition between the floral sexual phases. On average, in A.
   carmichaelii, male-phase flowers produced 2.4-fold more nectar than
   female-phase flowers in the two years of study, and nectar was
   sucrose-dominant, irrespective of sexual phase. By contrast, nectar
   production in A. lycoctonum was biased towards the male phase in one
   year of study and towards the female phase in the other, and whereas
   nectar was sucrose-dominant during the male-phase, it was fructose-rich
   during the female phase, indicating sucrose re-absorption. Although the
   characteristics of nectar in these Aconitum species indicate pollination
   by bumblebees, it is possible that their biogeographical history, and
   not pollinator selection alone, 4 important in understanding the lack of
   glucose in A. lycoctonum nectar. Variability in nectar production and/or
   carbohydrate composition between sexual phases suggests indirectly that
   nectar traits complement each of the latter. Nevertheless, further
   research is required if we are to understand the significance of these
   disparities in pollination ecology, i.e. for promoting pollinator
   movements between flowers and plants in order to achieve
   cross-pollination and avoid inbreeding. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{To date, more than 65 species of Brazilian bees (of the superfamily
   Apoidea) have been cytogenetically studied, but only a few solitary
   species have been analyzed. One example is the genus Melitoma Lepeletier
   \& Serville, 1828, for which there is no report in the literature with
   regard to cytogenetic studies. The objective of the present study is to
   analyze the chromosome number and morphology of the species Melitoma
   segmentaria (Fabricius, 1804), as well as to determine the pattern of
   heterochromatin distribution and identify the adenine-thymine (AT)- and
   guanine-cytosine (GC)-rich regions. Melitoma segmentaria presents
   chromosome numbers of 2n = 30 (females) and n = 15 (males). With
   C-banding, it is possible to classify the chromosomes into seven
   pseudo-acrocentric pairs (AM), seven pseudo-acrocentric pairs with
   interstitial heterochromatin (A(Mi)), and one totally heterochromatic
   metacentric pair (M-h). Fluorochrome staining has revealed that
   heterochromatin present in the chromosomal arms is rich in GC base pairs
   (CMA(3)(+)) and the centromeric region is rich in AT base pairs
   (DAPI(+)). The composition found for Melitoma diverges from the pattern
   observed in other bees, in which the heterochromatin is usually rich in
   AT. In bees, few heterochromatic regions are rich in GC and these are
   usually associated with or localized close to the nucleolus organizer
   regions (NORs). Silver nitrate impregnation marks the heterochromatin
   present in the chromosome arms, which makes identification of the NOR in
   the chromosomes impossible. As this technique reveals proteins in the
   NOR, the observation that is made in the present study suggests that the
   proteins found in the heterochromatin are qualitatively similar to those
   in the NOR.}},

Title = {{MATING BETWEEN ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA (ASTERACEAE) INDIVIDUALS INCREASES
   WITH THEIR FLOWERING SYNCHRONY AND SPATIAL PROXIMITY}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},

Pages = {{180-189}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Although spatial distance is considered the
   primary factor in determining plant mating patterns, flowering time and
   synchrony are also likely to be important.
   Methods: We quantified the relationships of both distance and flowering
   phenology to the probability of mating between individual plants. In an
   experimental plot, we followed daily flowering phenology in Echinacea
   angustifolia, a self-incompatible perennial pollinated by solitary bees.
   We assigned paternity to 832 of 927 seedlings from 37 maternal plants
   using 11 microsatellite loci. Potential pollen donors included the
   experiment plot's 202 flowering plants and a nearby plot's 19 flowering
   plants. For each maternal plant sampled, we examined the pollen pool by
   quantifying correlated paternity and the effective number of pollen
   donors.
   Key results: Significantly more pollinations occurred between
   neighboring and synchronous plants than expected under random mating,
   with distance being more important than flowering synchrony. The
   distance pollen moved varied over the course of the season, with late
   flowering plants mating with more distant plants compared to early or
   peak flowering plants. All maternal plants had a diverse set of mates
   (mean number of effective pollen donors = 23.7), and the composition of
   the pollen pools overlapped little between maternal plants.
   Conclusion: Both distance and flowering synchrony influenced pollination
   patterns in E. angustifolia. Our results suggest that pollen movement
   between incompatible mates and flowering asynchrony could be
   contributing to the reduced seed set observed in small E. angustifolia
   remnants. However, we also found that individual plants receive pollen
   from a diverse group of pollen donors.}},

Abstract = {{In countries containing a mega diversity of wildlife, such as Brazil,
   identifying and characterizing biological diversity is a continuous
   process for the scientific community, even in face of technological and
   scientific advances. This activity demands initiatives for the taxonomic
   identification of highly diverse groups, such as stingless bees,
   including molecular analysis strategies. This type of bee is distributed
   in all of the Brazilian states, with the highest species diversity being
   found in the State of Amazonia. However, the estimated number of species
   diverges among taxonomists. These bees are considered the main
   pollinators in the Amazon rainforest, in which they obtain food and
   shelter; however, their persistence is constantly threatened by
   deforestation pressure. Hence, it is important to classify the number
   and abundance of bee specie, to measure their decline and implement
   meaningful, priority conservation strategies. This study aims to
   maximize the implementation of more direct, economic and successful
   techniques for the taxonomic identification of stingless bees.
   Specifically, the genes 16S rRNA and COI from mitochondrial DNA were
   used as molecular markers to differentiate 9 species of Amazonian
   stingless bees based on DNA polymorphism, using the polymerase chain
   reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We
   registered different, exclusive SSCP haplotypes for both genes in all
   species analyzed. These results demonstrate that SSCP is a simple and
   cost-effective technique that is applicable to the molecular
   identification of stingless bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Commercially-reared nests of bumble bees are widely used for pollination
   of glasshouse crops such as tomatoes, and in recent years they have
   begun to be increasingly used outdoors for soft fruit crops which are
   either uncovered or in open-sided polytunnels. In the UK, approximately
   15,000 Bombus terrestris nests per year are imported for use in this
   way. Here we examine pollen loads on commercial bumble bees returning to
   their nests, stationed next to soft fruit crops at three farms in
   Scotland, UK, to determine whether pollen-collecting bees are visiting
   the target crop. Only 12\% of pollen was of Rubus type (most likely
   raspberry) and 15\% was of Potentilla type (probably strawberry). The
   remaining 73\% of pollen was from a range of non-target wildflowers, in
   declining importance: Brassicaceae (22\%), Filipendula type (18\%),
   Violaceae (11\%), Trifolium type (6\%) and Apiaceae (6\%). It is unclear
   how this relates to the pollination service provided, since the bees may
   make nectar-collecting visits to the fruit crops. Nonetheless a
   substantial proportion of foraging by commercial bees is clearly not on
   the target crops. Means for improving the efficiency of fruit
   pollination, and possible ecological implications of use of wild flowers

Abstract = {{Bee-pollinated lip flowers of two synchronopatric species of Centrosema
   were used as models to examine the influence of specialized pollination
   systems on the ecological mechanisms of pollinator sharing. Regression
   analysis of bee abundances in the habitat on bee abundances on C.
   pubescens flowers was significant (r = 0.69; P = 0.001) and became very
   consistent and highly significant (r = 0.87; P = 0.00001) using a size
   threshold of bee pollinators longer than 15mm. These same relationships
   were not significant (P > 0.01), however, for C. brasilianum flowers.
   The structures of the two pollination systems also sustained the
   hypothesis of a size threshold for pollinators, although only the C.
   pubescens-bees interactions sustained the hypothesis of random
   interactions proportional to species abundances in the habitat. The
   flower visitor pools of the two plant species shared the same four main
   bee guilds: the pollinators Centridini, Xylocopa, and Euglossini and the
   primary nectar robber Oxaea. However, a significant divergence (P <
   0.01) was detected between the two systems when the abundances and
   behaviors (pollinators or cheaters) of the main shared flower visitors
   were incorporated into the overall quantitative analysis (NMDS). The

   explain these divergences. Particularly, the concentrations of the
   largest pollinators Eulaema and Xylocopa on C. pubescens flowers and the
   behavior shift of Centridini bees that act as legitimate pollinators in
   C. pubescens and as nectar robbers in C. brasilianum are better
   understood as functional foraging responses triggered by the
   synchronopatry and by nectar volume differences (P = 0.001) between both

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{260-268}},
Abstract = {{Bee foraging is complex and observed patterns often deviate from
   predictions. Much of this deviation can be explained through differences
   in the characteristics of the flower patch, but not all. We suggest that
   the position of the flower patch within the landscape can have strong
   effects on bee patch use, independent of the characteristics of the
   flower patch, through changes in access to nesting resources and the
   microclimate. Further, the effects of different habitat configurations
   are likely to vary among bee groups, depending on flight distances and
   resource requirements. We surveyed local habitat and plant community
   characteristics around 100 observation plots in native grassland within
   temperate savannah and recorded bee patch use by direct observation.
   Using structural equation modeling, we quantified the direct and
   indirect effect of plant community and habitat configuration on patch
   use for all bees, only bumblebees, and only non-bumblebees. Our models
   explained nearly 50\% of the variation in bee patch use, with equal
   importance assigned to local habitat configuration and the plant
   community. Flower abundance was the best indicator of patch use,
   followed by distance to forest edge, site productivity and proportion
   forest cover. Contrary to previous findings, flower diversity had weak,
   yet negative effects on patch use after accounting for covariance with
   other factors. Although all bees most frequently visited plots with high
   flower densities, bumblebees preferentially used edge habitats, while
   non-bumblebees were mostly found in productive grassland areas with
   access to forest habitat. Our results show that small-scale habitat
   configuration can have direct effects on bee patch use as strong as or
   stronger than those of the flower patch itself. Further, the exact
   habitat configuration that drives bee patch choices is likely to vary
   among groups. This suggests that habitat configuration should be
   considered in bee conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Onion is an important vegetable crop which depends heavily on
   cross-pollinating insects for any significant increase in seed
   production. Nectar is the most important floral reward offered by
   plants. Minor components such as phenolic compounds in nectar affect bee

   naringenin, rutin, cinnamic acid, syringic acid, chlorogenic acid,
   apigenin, vanillic acid, luteolin, quercetin, and caffeic acid in onion
   nectar lines by CZE-UV is reported. Limited nectar amounts make it
   difficult to apply the most commonly employed methods of extraction for
   phenolic compounds. Thus, the extraction of phenolic compounds in nectar
   was performed by solid phase extraction (SPE) using a home-made
   minicolumn packed with a suitable filtering material (C-18, 50 mg)
   connected to a vacuum pump. Effects of several important factors

   The nest making period for C. propinqua and C. simillima at Pantnagar

   brood cells which were frequently separated by empty cells (the oldest
   cell below) while C. simillima nests were observed without empty cells.
   Cell partitions were made of pith compactly packed together, partitions
   upper surfaces were irregularly flat and lower surfaces were usually
   concave in both the species. Brood cells have immature stages along with
   or without bee bread (provision) and faecal materials. Orientation of

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{209}},

Pages = {{244-249}},
Abstract = {{Plants and ants have widespread relationships that are commonly Mediated
   by the offer of extrafloral nectar (EFN) to ants that protect plants
   against herbivores. However, these ant-plant interactions are highly
   facultative and vary in time and space, mainly depending on the
   characteristics of the ant species, such as density and aggressiveness.
   In general, the outcomes of these relationships are positive, but in
   some cases, the presence of ants is neutral or negative to plants. Some
   studies suggest that aggressive attacks or merely the presence of ants
   might reduce the visitation rate of insect pollinators, such as bees, to
   flowers. We used experimental manipulation in natural conditions to test
   the hypothesis that ants on flowers of EFN-bearing plants might be
   recognized as a danger by pollinators (bees) and reduce the plant
   fitness (fruit-set). Our results show that the avoidance that ant
   bodyguard species feeding on EFNs of the Malpighiaceae Heteropterys
   pteropetala cause in pollinators, is not enough to decrease plant
   fruit-set. However, ants were indeed identified as a danger to
   pollinators as hypothesized and as suggested for other plant-pollinator
   relationships: flowers with plastic ants placed on the petals produced
   significantly fewer fruits than other treatments (using instead a
   plastic circle) or the control (natural condition). Indirect costs of
   facultative mutualisms are the focus of few studies and have been
   performed only rarely in the Neotropics; our results show that mutualism
   must be considered in multitrophic interactions studies for a better
   understanding of the functioning of the system. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{Urban land use strongly affects pollinators and plant pollination due to
   fragmentation and isolation of natural plant populations. On the other
   hand, urban land use can potentially be beneficial to pollinators
   through the presence of urban gardens and parks which are usually
   designed to ensure abundant flowering. However, little is known about
   the effects of urban land use on bees and the pollination services they
   provide. In an urban-pen-urban gradient around Leuven, Belgium we
   studied flower visitation rates to, and seed set of Trifolium repens
   (white clover) in public lawns. T. repens is an obligatory outcrossing
   plant and is therefore sensitive to reductions in pollinator services.
   We related our results to both local and regional variables using
   Boosted Regression Trees. The two variables that best explained the
   variability in visitation rates and seed set were the amount of green
   areas (gardens, parks, grasslands) in the surroundings and the abundance
   of T. repens in the lawns. Surprisingly, an increasing amount of green
   areas in the surroundings had a negative effect on both flower
   visitation rates to, and seed set of T. repens. Flower visitation rates
   by bumblebees responded positively to urban land use resulting in higher
   visitation rates and increased seed set in the more urban sites. This
   may point either to increased abundance of bumblebees in more urban
   sites or to a concentration effect of bumblebees in our urban study
   sites due to a lack of alternative forage resources. Responses will
   likely differ for other bee and plant species, but this shows that at
   least for T. repens, pollination is not compromised by urban land use.

   Florida, using colored cups (bee bowls; pan traps) and netting from
   flowers including Balduina angustifolia (Pursh) Robins and other
   Asteraceae and the legume Dalea pinnata (J. F. Gmel.) Barneby. The 5462
   bees captured comprised 76 species in 29 genera and five families.
   Megachilidae was the family represented by the most species, whereas
   Halictidae included the five most numerous species. Notable differences
   in species composition and abundance from the bee fauna found in
   adjacent Alachua County included the presence of several rarely
   collected autumnal species associated with sandhill habitat such as
   Colletes holvardi Swenk, a new state record for Florida, and Trachusa

   of OSBS is quite different from that of sites further south in Florida
   but shares apparent sandhill specialist species with Southern Pines in
   North Carolina, a site of historical interest due to extensive surveys

Abstract = {{This is the first study of the nesting ecology of Megachile
   (Pseudocentron) alleni, a common ground-nesting solitary bee found
   throughout the Bahamas. While apparently an important pollinator in
   coastal communities, very little is known about its nesting behavior.
   Previously, we observed females collecting three plant resources:
   nectar, pollen, and leaves. We hypothesized which plants would be used
   for nectar and which for pollen based on the architecture of the floral
   display and observations of insect behavior. To test these hypotheses,
   we isolated and identified pollen occurring in cocoons from nest cells.
   We observed 412 interactions between M. alleni individuals and the
   flowers of 26 plant species in 14 families. Fifteen pollen species were
   identified from 15 dissected cocoons; cells averaged 5.5 pollen species
   +/- 1.7 SD. Two-thirds of the cocoons contained pollen from three
   species (Corchorus hirsutus, Jacquemontia cayensis, and Lantana
   involucrata), and more than half of the pollen species were found in at
   least twenty-seven percent of the cells. We found pollen from eight of
   the hypothesized sources, but also pollen from four species hypothesized
   to provide only nectar, and from three species not previously recognized
   as floral resources. Leaves of at least four species were used for nest
   cell construction.
   Females searching for suitable nests flew over the ground, often
   searching in cavities under rocks or asphalt. Substrate under 52 nests
   was usually light sand (78\%) or darker sand with humus (16\%). Nests
   averaged 2.88 cells +/- 2.0 SD (N = 37). Actively nesting females made
   numerous provisioning trips daily, each preceded by a brief orientation
   flight. One female was observed carrying leaf pieces, and later pollen,
   into her nest. On average, she spent 50\% more time in the nest and
   150\% more time away from the nest while handling pollen. We observed
   one species of beefly parasitizing the nests.}},

Abstract = {{The examination of specimens collected from various parts of Turkey,

   Anatolia. New distribution areas were added for each species and the
   plant species visited were included. Although the genus Dasypoda visits
   mostly wild flowers, D. hirtipes also frequently visits sunflowers and
   it is an important pollinator of this plant. In the case of the genus
   Macropis, females collect oil and pollen from the flowers of Lysimachia
   (Primulaceae) as larval food. Melitta leporina, M. dimidiata, and M.
   bicollaris are important pollinators of fodder crops, such as alfalfa,

Abstract = {{Generalist flowers are visited by a broad variety of insects that
   function as pollinators, occasional visitors and as pollen and/or nectar
   robbers. Moreover, among legitimate pollinators the pollination
   efficiency can be different. Nectar greatly affects visitor behaviour
   and fidelity to a certain species, influencing plant reproductive
   effort. In this study we have investigated a generalist system (Gentiana
   lutea L.), examining the role of flower visitors and quantifying the
   contribution of each pollinating taxon in three natural populations. In
   order to verify the level of generalization, we introduce an index of
   Pollinator Performance (PoP), based on insect visitation rate and
   cross-pollen transport efficiency. Our results confirm the high degree
   of pollinator-generalization of the study species. Nevertheless, flower
   visitors show various degree of pollinating performance, mainly defined
   by their sedentary versus dynamic behaviour. Sedentary insects enhance
   geitonogamous pollen transfer, which results in reduced seed set and
   pollen limitation. In particular, an unusual sluggish behaviour was
   observed in bumblebees feeding on nectar. The hexoserich abundant nectar
   offered by G. lutea flowers is remarkably rich in praline and
   beta-alanine amino acids: this composition presumably influences feeding
   choice and insect dynamism, likely exerting a narcotic effect on
   pollinators. The consequences on plant fitness are discussed in an
   evolutionary perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Tradescantia alliance (subtribes Tradescantiinae and Thyrsantheminae
   of tribe Tradescantieae, family Commelirtaceae) comprises a group of
   closely related New World genera exhibiting considerable variation in
   morphological, life history, and genomic traits. Despite ecological and
   cytogenetic significance of the Tradescantia alliance, phylogenetic
   relationships among genera and species remain uncertain. In particular,
   variation in inflorescence morphology has confounded classification and
   taxonomy. We inferred phylogenetic relationships using two plastid loci
   (rpL16, trnL-trnF) for 85 taxa in Commelinaceae, with sampling focused
   in the Tradescantia alliance. Constraint tests supported only subtribe
   Tradescantiinae, Tripogandra and Tinantia as monophyletic, with
   Tripogandra nested within Callisia. We estimated ancestral states for
   both breeding system and inflorescence condensation and tested for a
   correlation. Inflorescence morphology, an important character for
   generic identification, is more labile than previously expectdd, with
   condensed inflorescences evolving twice with three subsequent reversals.
   Breeding system evolution is more complex, with many more switches
   between self compatibility and self incompatibility and more uncertainty
   in ancestral state estimates. The presence of self compatible and
   incompatible species allowed us to test the hypothesis that self
   compatible species will have condensed inflorescences, as less
   allocation to floral display is necessary. While we did not find a
   correlation between self compatibility and inflorescence condensation,
   we propose additional floral and inflorescence characteristics that may

Volume = {{60}},

Pages = {{90-103}},
Abstract = {{Cases of imperfect or non-model mimicry are common in plants and animals
   and challenge intuitive assumptions about the nature of directional
   selection on mimics. Many non-rewarding flower species do not mimic a
   particular species, but attract pollinators through `generalised food
   deception'. Some predatory animals also attract pollinators by
   resembling flowers, perhaps the most well known, yet least well
   understood, is the orchid mantis Hymenopus coronatus. This praying
   mantis has been hypothesised to mimic a flower corolla and we have
   previously shown that it attracts and captures pollinating insects as
   prey. Predatory pollinator deception is relatively unstudied and whether
   this occurs through model mimicry or generalised food deception in the
   orchid mantis is unknown. To test whether the orchid mantis mimics a
   specific model flower species we investigated similarities between its
   morphology and that of flowers in its natural habitat in peninsular
   Malaysia. Geometric morphometrics were used to compare the shape of
   mantis femoral lobes to flower petals. Physiological vision models were
   used to compare the colour of mantises and flowers from the perspective
   of bees, flies and birds. We did not find strong evidence for a specific
   model flower species for the orchid mantis. The mantis' colour and shape
   varied within the range of that exhibited by many flower petals rather
   than resembling one type in particular. We suggest that the orchid
   mantis resembles an average, or generalised flower-like stimulus. Thus
   predatory pollinator deception in the orchid mantis is likely to
   function as a form of generalised food deception, as opposed to model
   mimicry.}},

Abstract = {{Floral polymorphism is frequently attributed to pollinator-mediated
   selection. Multiple studies, however, have revealed the importance of
   non-pollinating visitors in floral evolution. Using the polymorphic
   annual daisy Ursinia calenduliflora, this study investigated the
   importance of different insect visitors, and their effects on fitness,
   in the maintenance of floral polymorphism.
   The spatial structure of a discrete floral polymorphism was
   characterized based on the presence/absence of anthocyanin floret spots
   in U. calenduliflora. A 3-year observational study was then conducted in
   polymorphic populations to investigate differences in visitation rates
   of dominant visitors to floral morphs. Experiments were performed to
   explore the floral preference of male and female Megapalpus capensis
   (the dominant insect visitor) and their effectiveness as pollinators.
   Next, floral damage by antagonistic florivores and the reproductive
   success of the two floral morphs were surveyed in multiple populations
   and years.
   Floral polymorphism in U. calenduliflora was structured spatially, as
   were insect visitation patterns. Megapalpus capensis males were the
   dominant visitors and exhibited strong preference for the spotted morph
   in natural and experimental observations. While this may indicate
   potential fitness benefits for the spotted morph, female fitness did not
   differ between floral morphs. However, as M. capensis males are very
   efficient at exporting U. calenduliflora pollen, their preference may
   likely increase the reproductive fitness of the spotted morph through
   male fitness components. The spotted morph, however, also suffered
   significantly greater costs due to ovule predation by florivores than
   the spotless morph.
   The results suggest that pollinators and florivores may potentially
   exert antagonistic selection that could contribute to the maintenance of
   floral polymorphism across the range of U. calenduliflora. The relative
   strength of selection imposed by each agent is potentially determined by
   insect community composition and abundance at each site, highlighting
   the importance of community context in the evolution of floral
   phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying evolutionary processes of pollinator-driven floral
   diversification are still poorly understood. According to the
   GrantStebbins model speciation begins with adaptive local
   differentiation in the response to spatial heterogeneity in pollinators.
   Although this crucial process links the micro- and macroevolution of
   floral adaptation, it has received little attention. In this study
   geographical phenotypic variation was investigated in Patagonian
   Calceolaria polyrhiza and its pollinators, two oil-collecting bee
   species that differ in body size and geographical distribution.
   Patterns of phenotypic variation were examined together with their
   relationships with pollinators and abiotic factors. Six floral and seven
   vegetative traits were measured in 45 populations distributed across the
   entire species range. Climatic and edaphic parameters were determined
   for 25 selected sites, 216 bees per site of the most frequent pollinator
   species were captured, and a critical flowerbee mechanical fitting trait
   involved in effective pollination was measured. Geographical patterns of
   phenotypic and environmental variation were examined using uni- and
   multivariate analyses. Decoupled geographical variation between corolla
   area and floral traits related to the mechanical fit of pollinators was
   explored using a Mantel test.
   The body length of pollinators and the floral traits related to
   mechanical fit were strongly correlated with each other. Geographical
   variation of the mechanical-fit-related traits was decoupled from
   variation in corolla size; the latter had a geographical pattern
   consistent with that of the vegetative traits and was mainly affected by
   climatic gradients.
   The results are consistent with pollinators playing a key role in
   shaping floral phenotype at a geographical scale and promoting the
   differentiation of two floral ecotypes. The relationship between the
   critical floral-fit-related trait and bee length remained significant
   even in models that included various environmental variables and an
   allometric predictor (corolla area). The abiotic environment also has an
   important role, mainly affecting floral size. Decoupled geographical
   variation between floral mechanical-fit-related traits and floral size
   would represent a strategy to maintain plantpollinator phenotypic
   matching in this environmentally heterogeneous area.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Interest in pollinator-mediated evolutionary divergence of flower
   phenotype and speciation in plants has been at the core of plant
   evolutionary studies since Darwin. Specialized pollination is predicted
   to lead to reproductive isolation and promote speciation among sympatric
   species by promoting partitioning of (1) the species of pollinators
   used, (2) when pollinators are used, or (3) the sites of pollen
   placement. Here this last mechanism is investigated by observing the
   pollination accuracy of sympatric Pedicularis species (Orobanchacae).
   Pollinator behaviour was observed on three species of Pedicularis (P.
   densispica, P. tricolor and P. dichotoma) in the Hengduan Mountains,
   south-west China. Using fluorescent powder and dyed pollen, the accuracy
   was assessed of stigma contact with, and pollen deposition on,
   pollinating bumble-bees, respectively.
   All three species of Pedicularis were pollinated by bumble-bees. It was
   found that the adaptive accuracy of female function was much higher than
   that of male function in all three flower species. Although peak pollen
   deposition corresponded to the optimal location on the pollinator (i.e.
   the site of stigma contact) for each species, substantial amounts of
   pollen were scattered over much of the bees bodies.
   The Pedicularis species studied in the eastern Himalayan region did not
   conform with Grants Pedicularis Model of mechanical reproductive
   isolation. The specialized flowers of this diverse group of plants seem
   unlikely to have increased the potential for reproductive isolation or
   influenced rates of speciation. It is suggested instead that the extreme
   species richness of the Pedicularis clade was generated in other ways
   and that specialized flowers and substantial pollination accuracy
   evolved as a response to selection generated by the diversity of
   co-occurring congeners.}},

   for example, can outweigh benefits if ants deter pollinators. Plants can
   dissuade ants from occupying flowers, but such arrangements may break
   down when novel ant partners infiltrate mutualisms. Here, we examine how
   floral visitation by ants affects pollination services when the invasive
   Argentine ant (Linepithema humile) replaces a native ant species in a
   food-for-protection mutualism with the coast barrel cactus (Ferocactus
   viridescens), which, like certain other barrel cacti, produces
   extrafloral nectar. We compared the effects of floral visitation by the
   Argentine ant with those of the most prevalent native ant species
   (Crematogaster californica). Compared to C. californica, the Argentine
   ant was present in higher numbers in flowers. Cactus bees (Diadasia
   spp.), the key pollinators in this system, spent less time in flowers
   when cacti were occupied by the Argentine ant compared to when cacti
   were occupied by C. californica. Presumably as a consequence of
   decreased duration of floral visits by Diadasia, cacti occupied by L.
   humile set fewer seeds per fruit and produced fewer seeds overall
   compared to cacti occupied by C. californica. These data illustrate the
   importance of mutualist identity in cases where plants balance multiple
   mutualisms. Moreover, as habitats become increasingly infiltrated by
   introduced species, the loss of native mutualists and their replacement
   by non-native species may alter the shape of trade-offs between plant
   defense and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plants may compete with native species for abiotic factors as
   light, space and nutrients, and have also been shown to affect native
   pollination interactions. Studies have mainly focused on how invasive
   plants affect pollinator behaviour, i.e. attraction of pollinators to or
   away from native flowers. However, when an invasive plant provides
   resources utilized by native pollinators this could increase pollinator
   population sizes and thereby pollination success in natives. Effects
   mediated through changes in pollinator population sizes have been
   largely ignored in previous studies, and the dominance of negative
   interactions suggested by meta-analyses may therefore be biased. We
   investigated the impact of the invasive Lupinus polyphyllus on
   pollination in the native Lotus corniculatus using a study design
   comparing invaded and uninvaded sites before and after the flowering
   period of the invasive. We monitored wild bee abundance in transects,
   and visit rate and seed production of potted Lotus plants. Bumblebee
   abundance increased 3.9 times in invaded sites during the study period,
   whereas it was unaltered in uninvaded sites. Total visit rate per Lotus
   plant increased 2.1 times in invaded sites and decreased 4.4 times in
   uninvaded sites. No corresponding change in seed production of Lotus was
   found. The increase in visit rate to Lotus was driven by an increase in
   solitary bee visitation, whereas mainly bumblebees were observed to
   visit the invasive Lupinus. The mechanism by which the invasive
   increases pollinator visit rates to Lotus could be increased
   availability of other flower resources for solitary bees when bumblebees
   forage on Lupinus.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesize interactions among plants for pollination may depend on

   has different effects on plant reproductive success. Honeybee-pollinated
   plants, Lotus corniculatus, and its commonly coflowering neighbor,
   Potentilla reptans var. sericophylla, were used in a two-year project.
   We designed six types of plant combinations with different conspecific
   and interspecific flower densities in 2011 and repeated this in the same
   site in 2012. Meanwhile, we artificially increased pollinator abundance
   by hiring beehives only in 2011. Pollinator abundance as well as flower
   density significantly affected pollination of L. corniculatus plants
   from both the conspecific and interspecific plots. Total number of bees
   visiting a plot was enhanced by an increase in both the conspecific and
   interspecific flower densities regardless of high or low pollinator
   abundance. However, changes in visitation rates and fruit sets in the
   focal plants when flower densities were increased depended on pollinator
   abundance. Under high pollinator abundance, an increase in both the
   conspecific and interspecific flower densities significantly enhanced
   pollinator visits to L. corniculatus. However, under low pollinator
   abundance, the pollinator visitation rate remained unchanged as
   conspecific flower density increased, but decreased when there was an
   increase in interspecific flower density. Coflowering plants enhanced
   fruit sets of L. corniculatus only when the pollinator abundance was

Abstract = {{In the papilionaceous flowers with explosive pollination mechanism, the
   androecium and the gynoecium are subjected to great pressure in the
   keel. It has been suggested that at the first visit nearly all pollen
   grains are released and that the floral parts do not return to their
   original positions; this would be a cue for pollinators to avoid
   activated flowers. The dependence on the pollinators suggests that
   explosive flowers will not produce fruits if the mechanism is not
   activated. In this paper, we have tested these ideas studying the
   reproductive biology of three Desmodium species, D. incanum, D.
   subsericium and D. uncinatum. Specifically, we studied the floral
   traits, reproductive system, pollination mechanism and floral visitors,
   for the three species. The results indicated that the keel and the wings
   play a key role in the activation of the explosive mechanism. The three
   species have a secondary pollen presentation, diurnal flowers, and a
   short floral cycle. According to the results, all the species studied
   were self-compatible, with two species producing fruits by autonomous
   self-pollination. Desmodium flowers were visited and activated by native
   and exotic bee species. During the first visit nearly all the pollen was
   released; after that, new visits were low or null. Our results indicated
   that the activation of the mechanism is not essential for the production
   of fruits, that explosive flowers are visited only once and that the
   changes in the positions of the floral parts are the cues that keep
   pollinators away from the flowers with activated mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Arundina graminifolia is an early successional plant on Iriomote Island,
   the Ryukyus, Japan, where it is endangered. Populations flower for more
   than half a year, and many inflorescences bloom for one to several
   months. The nectarless gullet flowers, which open for up to six days,
   are self-compatible but cannot self-pollinate spontaneously; thus they
   rely on pollinating agents for capsule production. Field observations at
   two habitats identified at least six species of bees and wasps,
   primarily mate-seeking males of Megachile yaeyamaensis and Thyreus
   takaonis, as legitimate pollinators. Thus, this orchid is a pollinator
   generalist, probably owing to its long blooming period and simple flower
   morphology. Carpenter bees, which were previously reported to pollinate
   this orchid, frequently visited flowers but were too large to crawl into
   the labellum chamber and never pollinated the flowers. Extrafloral
   nectaries on inflorescences attracted approximately 40 insect taxa but
   were not involved with pollination. Fruit-set ratios at the population
   level varied spatiotemporally but were generally low (5.2-12.4 \%),
   presumably owing to infrequent flower visits by mate-seeking pollinators

Abstract = {{Gynomonoecy, a sexual system in which plants have both pistillate
   (female) flowers and perfect (hermaphroditic) flowers, occurs in at
   least 15 families, but the differential reproductive strategies of the
   two flower morphs within one individual remain unclear. Racemes of
   Eremurus anisopterus (Xanthorrhoeaceae) have basal pistillate and distal
   perfect flowers. To compare sex allocation and reproductive success
   between the two flower morphs, we measured floral traits, pollinator
   preferences, and pollen movement in the field. Pollen limitation was
   more severe in pistillate flowers; bee pollinators preferred to visit
   perfect flowers, which were also capable of partial self-fertilization.
   Pollen-staining experiments indicated that perfect flowers received a
   higher proportion of intra-plant pollen (geitonogamy) than pistillate
   flowers. Plants with greater numbers of pistillate flowers received more
   outcross pollen. The differential reproductive success conformed with
   differential floral sex allocation, in which pistillate flowers produce
   fewer but larger ovules, resulting in outcrossed seeds. Our flower
   manipulations in these nectarless gynomonoecious plants demonstrated
   that perfect flowers promote seed quantity in that they are more
   attractive to pollinators, while pistillate flowers compensate for the
   loss of male function through better seed quality. These results are
   consistent with the outcrossing-benefit hypothesis for gynomonoecy.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Scent glands, or osmophores, are predominantly floral secretory
   structures that secrete volatile substances during anthesis, and
   therefore act in interactions with pollinators. The Leguminosae family,
   despite being the third largest angiosperm family, with a wide
   geographical distribution and diversity of habits, morphology and
   pollinators, has been ignored with respect to these glands. Thus, we
   localised and characterised the sites of fragrance production and
   release in flowers of legumes, in which scent plays an important role in
   pollination, and also tested whether there are relationships between the
   structure of the scent gland and the pollinator habit: diurnal or
   nocturnal. Flowers in pre-anthesis and anthesis of 12 legume species
   were collected and analysed using immersion in neutral red, olfactory
   tests and anatomical studies (light and scanning electron microscopy).
   The main production site of floral scent is the perianth, especially the
   petals. The scent glands are distributed in a restricted way in
   Caesalpinia pulcherrima, Anadenanthera peregrina, Inga edulis and Parkia
   pendula, constituting mesophilic osmophores, and in a diffuse way in
   Bauhinia rufa, Hymenaea courbaril, Erythrostemon gilliesii, Poincianella
   pluviosa, Pterodon pubescens, Platycyamus regnellii, Mucuna urens and
   Tipuana tipu. The glands are comprised of cells of the epidermis and
   mesophyll that secrete mainly terpenes, nitrogen compounds and phenols.
   Relationships between the presence of osmophores and type of anthesis
   (diurnal and nocturnal) and the pollinator were not found. Our data on
   scent glands in Leguminosae are original and detail the type of diffuse
   release, which has been very poorly studied.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen presentation theory (PPT) predicts that plant species typically
   pollinated by frequent and wasteful pollinators ought to be much more
   parsimonious and only gradually release pollen compared to plant species

   the pollen they remove. To test PPT, we compare the pollen presentation
   schedules and pollination systems in three related Epimedium species,
   having different pollinators. Results showed that differences in anther
   dehiscence and flowering traits resulted in different pollen packaging
   schedules. For E. sutchuenense and E. franchetii, a special `roll-up'
   movement of the anther wall during anther dehiscence increased pollen
   removal compared to the dehiscence pattern in E. mikinorii, which lacked
   the `roll-up' movement. Investigations revealed that honeybees had a
   higher pollen removal rate and lower stigmatic pollen load compared to
   bumblebees. In accordance with PPT, E. sutchuenense presents pollen
   sequentially and slowly for the frequent and wasteful honeybees. In
   comparison to E. sutchuenense, E. franchetii had a faster presentation
   rate and was adapted to the efficient and infrequent bumblebees.
   However, E. mikinorii was pollinated by both bumblebees and honeybees at
   high frequency and had the fastest pollen presentation. This pattern
   could reduce pollen wastage by honeybees and might be an adaptation to
   its short flower longevity (less than 1 day), to increase the chances of
   pollen deposition on stigmas. The study indicates that pollen
   presentation schedules can be a consequence of interactions among anther

   There were no correlations in this population between flower color and

   hummingbirds undervisited the two most yellow color classes, overvisited
   orange flowers, and visited the two most red color classes in proportion

   flowers expressing red pigments to those that did not, the flowers with

   morphology, scent chemistry and phenology, and a test was made of
   whether these differences represent adaptations for different
   pollinators.
   Multivariate analysis of floral and vegetative traits revealed that
   there are at least two discrete morphological forms in the species
   complex. Field observations revealed that each form is pollinated by a
   different insect species, and thus represent distinct ecotypes. The
   early-flowering coastal form which has long spurs and floral scent
   dominated by sesquiterpene compounds is pollinated exclusively by the
   long-tongued bee Amegilla fallax (Apidae, Anthophorinae), while the
   late-flowering inland form with short spurs and floral scent dominated
   by benzenoid compounds is pollinated exclusively by the beetle
   Cyrtothyrea marginalis (Cetoniinae; Scarabaeidae). Choice experiments in
   a Y-maze olfactometer showed that beetles are preferentially attracted
   to the scent of the short-spurred form. A spur-shortening experiment
   showed that long spurs are required for effective pollination of the
   bee-pollinated form. Although it was initially thought likely that
   divergence occurred across a geographical pollinator gradient, plants of
   the long-spurred form were effectively pollinated when transplanted to
   an inland locality outside the natural coastal range of this form. Thus,
   the underlying geographical basis for the evolution of ecotypes in the
   E. parviflora complex remains uncertain, although early flowering in the
   long-spurred form to exploit the emergence of nave bees may restrict
   this form to coastal areas where there is no frost that would damage
   flower buds. Later flowering of the short-spurred form coincides closely
   with the emergence of the pollinating beetles following winter frosts.
   This study identifies a shift between bee and beetle pollination as the
   main driver of floral divergence in an orchid species complex. Floral
   scent and spur length appear to be key traits in mediating this
   evolutionary transition.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinated mass flowering crops are becoming more widespread and
   there is a need to understand which insects are primarily responsible
   for the pollination of these crops so conservation measures can be
   appropriately targeted in the face of pollinator declines. This study
   used field surveys in conjunction with cage manipulations to identify
   the relative contributions of different pollinator taxa to the
   pollination of two widespread flowering crops, field beans and oilseed
   rape. Flower visiting pollinator communities observed in the field were
   distinct for each crop; while field beans were visited primarily by a
   few bumblebee species, multiple pollinator taxa visited oilseed, and the
   composition of this pollinator community was highly variable spatially
   and temporally. Neither pollinator community, however, appears to be
   meeting the demands of crops in our study regions. Cage manipulations
   showed that multiple taxa can effectively pollinate both oilseed and
   field beans, but bumblebees are particularly effective bean pollinators.
   Combining field observations and cage manipulations demonstrated that
   the pollination demands of these two mass flowering crops are highly
   contrasting, one would benefit from management to increase the abundance
   of some key taxa, whilst for the other, boosting overall pollinator
   abundance and diversity would be more appropriate. Our findings
   highlight the need for crop specific mitigation strategies that are
   targeted at conserving specific pollinator taxa (or group of taxa) that
   are both active and capable of crop pollination in order to reduce
   pollination deficits and meet the demands of future crop production. (C)

Abstract = {{Within the genus Osmia, the three subgenera Osmia, Monosmia, and
   Orientosmia form a closely-related group of predominantly pollen
   generalist (polylectic') mason bees. Despite the great scientific and
   economic interest in several species of this clade, which are promoted
   commercially for orchard pollination, their phylogenetic relationships
   remain poorly understood. We inferred the phylogeny of 21 Osmia species
   belonging to this clade by applying Bayesian and maximum likelihood
   methods based on five genes and morphology. Because our results revealed
   paraphyly of the largest subgenus (Osmia s.s.), we synonymized Monosmia
   and Orientosmia under Osmia s.s. Microscopical analysis of female pollen
   loads revealed that five species are specialized (oligolectic') on
   Fabaceae or Boraginaceae, whereas the remaining species are polylectic,
   harvesting pollen from up to 19 plant families. Polylecty appears to be
   the ancestral state, with oligolectic lineages having evolved twice
   independently. Among the polylectic species, several intriguing patterns
   of host plant use were found, suggesting that host plant choice of these
   bees is constrained to different degrees and governed by flower
   morphology, pollen chemistry or nectar availability, thus supporting
   previous findings on predominantly oligolectic clades of bees.(c) 2013

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{131-141}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Biotic pollination is an important ecosystem service for the production
   of many food crops. The supply of pollination is mostly studied at the
   landscape scale while recent studies on the demand for pollination
   services provide a global-scale picture based on aggregate
   national-level data. This paper quantifies both demand and supply of
   pollination in the European Union (EU) at a relatively high spatial
   resolution, allowing an analysis of the match between demand and supply.
   Finally, we evaluate how policies interact with the spatial differences
   between demand and supply of this ecosystem service.
   We mapped the crop area requiring pollination for optimal production
   (demand) and both bee habitat and related visitation probability
   (supply) using detailed agricultural and landscape data. We compared the
   maps of demand and supply by visual comparison, descriptive statics and
   a trend surface generalized additive model to analyze the relation
   between visitation probability and the presence or absence of pollinator
   dependent crops. A sensitivity analysis was done to test the robustness
   of the pollination supply model. Finally, the impact of EU Biodiversity
   Strategy and Biofuel Directive were evaluated by identifying areas where
   these policies would influence the demand or supply of pollination.
   In the EU, 12\% of the total cropland area was dependent on pollinators
   for optimal agricultural production. Pollinator habitat is especially
   abundant in mosaic landscapes as found in hilly and mountainous areas.
   Although covering less than 0.5\% of the agricultural area, the presence
   of green linear elements increased the visitation probability by 5-20\%
   while being the sole providers of pollinators in 12\% of the croplands.
   In half of the area with a high pollination demand, the supply of
   pollination is also high. Irrespective of the different
   parameterizations, total habitat areas and visitation probability were
   highest in croplands without pollinator dependent crops and lowest in
   hotspots of pollination demand.
   The analysis of the match between pollination supply and demand for this
   service indicates that for improving or ensuring pollination one must
   consider both the demand and supply of the process of crop pollination
   for optimal results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   The objectives of this study were to: (i) investigate the spectrum of

   in caatinga (dry vegetation) areas in the semiarid region of
   Northeastern Brazil; (ii) identify pollen types that could be used as
   regional geographical markers and (iii) determine the pollen niche
   breadth and the pattern of use of floral resources by this stingless
   bee. In total, 23 samples of the pollen stored by T. angustula were
   collected monthly and subjected to acetolysis. Of the 45 pollen types
   identified that of Prosopis juliflora (Fabaceae) and Solanum
   (Solanaceae) were the most frequently represented in the samples and 19
   were collected by the bees at both study sites. Species characteristic
   of caatinga, such as Poincianella pyramidalis (Tulasne) L. P. Queiroz
   and Senna macranthera (de Candolle ex Colladon) H. S. Irwin \& Barneby,
   were among the pollen identified and they were used as indicators of the
   geographical origin of the samples. The average values of the pollen

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Batesian mimicry has been repeatedly reported in syrphid flies (Diptera:
   Syrphidae), with noxious Hymenoptera identified as the models, including
   bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Aculeata). Despite the number of detailed
   studies of bumblebee mimics from the Holarctic, only minimal biological
   and ecological information is available for the same phenomenon in most
   other biogeographical regions. Here, we analyse in detail a case of
   Batesian mimicry by the syrphid fly Aneriophora aureorufa Philippi
   towards the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii Guerin from Patagonia, a
   relationship only briefly noted previously in taxonomic studies. A.
   aureorufa possesses strikingly similar red tawny colouration to the
   highly hairy body of its model, and somewhat resembles it also in size.
   Cluster analysis suggests that the mimicry is more pronounced towards
   larger rather than smaller bumblebee workers. The mimicry is visually
   very good, but there was no evidence of a behavioural component.
   Foraging activity of both species seems to be largely restricted to the
   endemic plant Eucryphia cordifolia. The time spent on flowers was much
   higher in syrphid flies than in B. dahlbomii and other pollinators, and
   the time spent between flower visits largely overlapped between all the
   tested species. The endemic distribution, the apparent plant
   specialisation, and the invasion of alien bumblebees, make B. dahlbomii
   and A. aureorufa potentially threatened in some parts of the austral
   American forests, a priority conservation area.}},

Abstract = {{This in farm research study was aimed at evaluating new strategies in
   the use of plastic protective covers in field grown melon in order to
   expand the production period and reduce costs. Four experiments were set
   up in 2010 and repeated in 2011 in Central Italy, in an inland region
   with a temperate climate. We evaluated: i) the use of high tunnels for
   two growing cycles per year, i.e for very early and very late production
   (target transplanting in late winter and mid summer, respectively), for
   either one year or two consecutive years, and the use of grafted plants
   in the second year as an alternative to normal plants to prevent soil
   born diseases; ii) the use of ethylene-vinyl-acetate film low tunnels
   alone or combined with non woven floating row covers for transplanting
   in early spring; iii) the use of non-woven low tunnels for transplanting
   in mid-spring; iv) the use of biodegradable and conventional
   polyethylene ground mulch films, both in the presence of non-woven low
   tunnels. As far as the non woven cover is concerned, we adopted the
   strategy of removing later with respect to usual practices. i.e, ten
   days after the onset of first pistillate flowers. This was based on the
   evidence that covers hamper honeybee circulation, which may be exploited
   on a farm-scale to delay pollination until an adequate number of
   pistillate flowers set, in order to shorten scaled fruit ripening and
   harvest Our results demonstrate that high tunnels may be used for at
   least four consecutive melon growing cycles (early and late productions
   for two years) with good off-season yields and no appreciable drawbacks
   in terms of disease scale up, irrespective of the use of normal or
   grafted plants. The non woven low tunnel was effective in hampering
   honeybee circulation and its delayed removal allowed the harvest period
   to be halved, a more uniform fruit size to be obtained, and labour
   productivity of harvest to be increased. This had positive implications
   on the management of irrigation and chemical disease control close to
   the harvest period, and on the management of harvest and post harvest
   operation schedules including fruit processing packaging and delivery to
   markets. In the presence of a non woven low tunnel, there was no
   substantial difference in the biodegradable mulch compared to other
   mulches in terms of effects on harvest dates, yield and weed control, so
   that its use can be cost-effective and convenient provided that costs
   are not higher than those for traditional polyethylene films and their
   usage/disposal.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory induces changes in plants that influence the associated insect
   community. The present study addresses the potential trade-off between
   plant phytochemical responses to insect herbivory and interactions with
   pollinators. We used a multidisciplinary approach and have combined
   field and greenhouse experiments to investigate effects of herbivory in
   plant volatile emission, nectar production, and pollinator behavior,
   when Pieris brassicae caterpillars were allowed to feed only on the
   leaves of Brassica nigra plants. Interestingly, volatile emission by
   flowers changed upon feeding by herbivores on the leaves, whereas,
   remarkably, volatile emission by leaves did not significantly differ
   between infested and non-infested flowering plants. The frequency of
   flower visits by pollinators was generally not influenced by herbivory,
   but the duration of visits by honeybees and butterflies was negatively
   affected by herbivore damage to leaves. Shorter duration of pollinator
   visits could be beneficial for a plant, because it sustains pollen
   transfer between flowers while reducing nectar consumption per visit.
   Thus, no trade-off between herbivore-induced plant responses and
   pollination was evident. The effects of herbivore-induced plant
   responses on pollinator behavior underpin the importance of including
   ecological factors, such as herbivore infestation, in studies of the
   ecology of plant pollination.}},

   pollen composition of larval food, both species predominantly used
   medium-sized pollen grains. Although C. analis and C. tarsata are
   sympatric species, belonging to the same functional group and presenting
   an overlap in nesting periods, they used different pollen sources, which
   suggests the occurrence of food niche partitioning.}},

Abstract = {{New molecular studies suggested that the family Melittidae is either a
   paraphyletic group from which all the other bees are derived, or the
   sister clade to all other existing bees. Studying the historical
   biogeography and evolution of each major lineage within this group is a
   key step to understand the origin and early radiation of bees. Melitta
   is the largest genus of melittid bees, for which a robust molecular
   phylogeny and a biogeographic analysis are still lacking. Here, we
   derive a phylogenetic hypothesis from the sequences of seven independent
   DNA fragments of mitochondrial and nuclear origin. This phylogenetic
   hypothesis is then used to infer the evolution of the species range and
   of the host-plant shifts in Melitta. Our results confirmed the monophyly
   of Melitta, but did not recover all previously defined clades within the
   genus. We propose new taxa by splitting the genus in three subgenera
   (including two new subgenera described in the Appendix: Afromelitta
   subgen. nov., Plesiomelitta subgen. nov.) and describe two new species:
   Melitta avontuurensis sp. n. and M. richtersveldensis sp. n. Regarding
   the evolution of host-plant use, our analysis suggests that all species
   currently specialized on one plant family originated from an ancestor
   that was specialized on Fabaceae plants. The inferred biogeographic
   history for the genus supported an African origin. In concordance with
   previous studies identifying Africa as the geographic origin for many
   clades of bees, our data bring new evidence for an African origin of
   melittid bees. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Communication in plant-animal mutualisms frequently involves multiple
   perceivers. A fundamental uncertainty is whether and how species adapt
   to communicate with groups of mutualists having distinct sensory
   abilities. We quantified the colour conspicuousness of flowers and
   fruits originating from one European and two South American plant
   communities, using visual models of pollinators (bee and fly) and seed
   dispersers (bird, primate and marten). We show that flowers are more
   conspicuous than fruits to pollinators, and the reverse to seed
   dispersers. In addition, flowers are more conspicuous to pollinators
   than to seed dispersers and the reverse for fruits. Thus, despite marked
   differences in the visual systems of mutualists, flower and fruit
   colours have evolved to attract multiple, distinct mutualists but not
   unintended perceivers. We show that this adaptation is facilitated by a
   limited correlation between flower and fruit colours, and by the fact
   that colour signals as coded at the photoreceptor level are more similar
   within than between functional groups (pollinators and seed dispersers).
   Overall, these results provide the first quantitative demonstration that
   flower and fruit colours are adaptations allowing plants to communicate
   simultaneously with distinct groups of mutualists.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of natural vegetation creates one of the largest threats
   to plant-pollinator interactions. Although fragmentation impacts on
   plant populations have been explored in many, mainly herbaceous,
   species, the response of wild mass-flowering species is poorly known.
   Here, we studied 28 heathland patches dominated by the mass-flowering
   shrub Rhododendron ferrugineum, each presenting different R.ferrugineum
   floral display sizes (total inflorescence number per patch) and patch
   isolation (median distance to the three nearest patches). We assessed
   the impacts of these two factors on (i) heathland patch visitor
   assemblage (considering R.ferrugineum versus surrounding community) and
   (ii) R.ferrugineum flower visitation rate and pollen transfer limitation
   (comparing seed set from emasculated to pollen-supplemented flowers). We
   found that diversity and abundance of bees visiting R.ferrugineum in
   heathland patches significantly decreased with decreasing R.ferrugineum
   floral display, while overall visitor density per patch and flower
   visitation rate increased. Moreover, a decrease in massive floral
   display and increase in patch isolation resulted in reduced visitor
   density in the surrounding community. Even in patches with few
   individuals, we found disproportionate visitor abundance in
   R.ferrugineum compared to the surrounding community. Finally, pollen
   transfer limitation in R.ferrugineum was neither affected by visitation
   rate nor by patch attributes. By disproportionally attracting
   pollinators from co-flowering species, and probably promoting
   geitonogamous pollen transfer, the mass-flowering trait appears adequate
   to compensate, in terms of conspecific pollen transfer, for the decrease
   in visitor diversity and abundance and in mate availability, which
   usually result from population fragmentation.}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{SI}},

Abstract = {{In Western Australia, Thelymitra crinita Lindl. and T. macrophylla
   Lindl. are pollinated by female, polylectic bees but offer no edible
   rewards. Flowers of Orthrosanthus laxus (Endl.) Benth. (Iridaceae) offer
   granular pollen and previous authorities suggest it is a Batesian model
   of T. crinita. We analyzed the floral fragrances and measured the floral
   dimensions of the orchid species, their putative hybrid, and O. laxus.
   Although the `scentless' T. crinita emitted low levels of monoterpenoids
   and sesquiterpenoids, the pleasantly discernible fragrance of T.
   macrophylla was dominated by 2-phenylethanol. Their putative hybrid
   produced slightly lower levels of 2-phenylethanol compared with T.
   macrophylla and failed to produce any sesquiterpenoids associated with
   T. crinita. However, the hybrid produced higher volumes of the
   monoterpene linalool than either parent species. The fragrance of O.
   laxus contained 2-phenylethanol but lacked the sesquiterpenoids. We also
   measured perianth area and symmetry as well as the length and width of
   contrastingly pigmented floral centres for each taxon. Significant
   differences in floral area and symmetry were detected between the
   putative hybrid, the two parent species, and O. laxus. In contrast, the
   floral reward centre area (tuft of stamens) in O. laxus was
   significantly larger than the pseudo-reward centres (mitras) of both
   Thelymitra species and their hybrid. At the peak of their respective,
   but overlapping flowering periods, an inflorescence of T. macrophylla
   produced more than twice the number of open flowers as T. crinita and
   more than four times the number of open flowers on cymes of O. laxus.
   Based on scent production and visual displays, T. macrophylla appears
   more likely to be a Batesian floral mimic of O. laxus. We suggest that
   large-flowered Thelymitra species appear to produce a novel, visual and
   olfactory attractant pattern of fraudulence we call the `New Again, More
   Again Effect'.}},

   occurrence records comprising 9657 unique events are documented for 92
   species of Anthidium, including the invasive range of two introduced
   species from Eurasia, A. oblongatum (Illiger) and A. manicatum
   (Linnaeus). The geospatial coverage of the dataset extends from northern
   Canada and Alaska to southern Argentina, and from below sea level in
   Death Valley, California, USA, to 4700 m a.s.l. in Tucuman, Argentina.
   The majority of records in the dataset correspond to information
   recorded from individual specimens examined by the authors during this
   project and deposited in 60 biodiversity collections located in Africa,
   Europe, North and South America. A fraction ( 4.8\%) of the occurrence
   records were taken from the literature, largely California records from
   a taxonomic treatment with some additional records for the two
   introduced species. The temporal scale of the dataset represents
   collection events recorded between 1886 and 2012. The dataset was
   developed employing SQL server 2008 r2. For each specimen, the following
   information is generally provided: scientific name including
   identification qualifier when species status is uncertain (e.g.
   ``Questionable Determination{''} for 0.4\% of the specimens), sex,
   temporal and geospatial details, coordinates, data collector, host
   plants, associated organisms, name of identifier, historic
   identification, historic identifier, taxonomic value (i.e., type
   specimen, voucher, etc.), and repository. For a small portion of the
   database records, bees associated with threatened or endangered plants
   (similar to 0.08\% of total records) as well as specimens collected as
   part of unpublished biological inventories (similar to 17\%),
   georeferencing is presented only to nearest degree and the information
   on floral host, locality, elevation, month, and day has been withheld.
   This database can potentially be used in species distribution and niche
   modeling studies, as well as in assessments of pollinator status and
   pollination services. For native pollinators, this large dataset of
   occurrence records is the first to be simultaneously developed during a
   species-level systematic study.}},

Abstract = {{Seedlessness is one of the main requirements for the Citrus fresh
   market. `Afourer' mandarin has been registered as self-incompatible,
   producing seedless fruit in the absence of cross-pollination. Under
   field conditions, a high number of seeded fruits is produced, which
   reduces its quality and commercial value. The purpose of this work was
   to characterize self-incompatibility type of `Afourer' mandarin, to
   determine its parthenocarpic capacity, and to reduce the presence of
   seeds under field conditions. Four experiments were performed, including
   net-covered trees during flowering period (experiments 1 and 2), single
   flower emasculation and self-pollination (experiment 3), in vivo pollen
   germination, pollen tube development and ovule viability (experiment 1),
   and field application of copper sulfate (CuSO4) and gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)) during flowering period (experiment 4); open pollination was the
   control in all situations. Under open pollination, relatively low
   seedless fruit percentage was found (7\% and 34\%), whereas with
   anti-bee nets this percentage reached 98-99\% of the fruits. Relatively
   high fruit set percentage and fruit number per tree was found in
   net-covered trees and in bagged or emasculated flowers, indicating that
   `Afourer' mandarin presents facultative parthenocarpy. Emasculated or
   self-pollinated flowers resulted in similar seedless fruit number,
   indicating an autonomous parthenocarpy. In flowers from open or
   net-covered trees, similar pollen tube growth was registered until 6
   days after anthesis, but, thereafter, growth was interrupted in
   self-pollination condition, reaching only 40\% of the style length,
   which suggests a gametophytic self-incompatibility system. GA(3) applied
   during flowering period reduced the percentage of seeded fruits and seed
   number per fruit; the most efficient treatment was three applications of
   GA(3) (50 mg l(-1)) combined with CuSO4 (25 mgl(-1)), that increased
   seedless fruit from 19\% to 31\% and reduced from 3.7 to 2.3 the number

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator systems may be considered as biological markets in

   first time that scent advertisement is higher in plant species that

   surplus of pollinators relative to flowers. We also show that less
   abundant flowering species that may compete with dominant species for
   pollinator visitation early in the flowering period emit much higher
   proportions of the generalist attractant beta-ocimene. Overall, we
   provide a first community-wide description of the key role of seasonal

Abstract = {{Floral color polymorphism of annatto (Bixa orellana L.) offers a wide
   range of colors that are maintained in the population by either
   pollinators or non pollinator agents of selection. In the present study,
   maintenance of different floral colors was analyzed in relation to
   reproductive success of Bixa orellana. The different floral petal colors
   (white, amaranth rose, petunia purple or cobalt violet) were determined
   from selected plants with reflectance spectrophotometry. Phenotypic
   measures of other floral traits, female reproductive success, seed set,
   seed output and seed weight also revealed variation between different
   floral morphs. Records on seed set varied significantly for different
   floral color morphs. Maximum fruit maturation (58 \%) was observed in
   amaranth rose and least fruit maturation (25 \%) in the white morph.
   Seed set data indicates pollinators' preference for more intensely
   colored flowers. This preference may be due to ability of the
   pollinators to distinguish the morphs through differentially reduced
   sensitivity at the green wavelengths. In flowers which received fewer
   insect visits, polymorphism might be maintained by self fertilization.
   The color morphs showed differences in Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) profile indicating a genetic basis for floral color variation and
   consequent differences in seed set. Out of 88 bands generated with nine
   operon primers, 70 were polymorphic. The present study provides valuable
   information on the influence of petal color on maternal fitness in B.

Abstract = {{The vast majority of plant species, including one-third of crops,
   require a pollinator in order to set seed. While habitat disturbance has
   been shown to reduce the abundance and species richness of native bee
   species, a comprehensive study of the impacts of disturbance on plant
   reproductive success is lacking. In a meta-analysis of 41 studies we
   show that, overall, habitat disturbance is associated with a decrease in
   fruit set. Moreover, the magnitude of this effect depends on disturbance
   type. The presence of livestock or fire in a plant's habitat was
   associated with a reduction in fruit set, whereas the presence of human
   use, deforestation, or agricultural use was associated with a
   non-significant trend in the same direction. We also examined the
   potential for plant traits to influence a species' response to
   disturbance. We found that tropical plants suffered a greater impact of
   habitat disturbance than temperate plants, as did plants with dry
   relative to fleshy fruit types. No differences were found between woody
   and herbaceous plants, or between crops and non-crop species.
   Self-incompatible species in disturbed temperate habitats suffered a
   greater reduction in fruit set than self-compatible species, suggesting
   a role of pollination on the effect of the disturbance. Our results
   indicate that while species' responses to habitat disturbance are highly
   variable, certain plant traits could serve to predict the impact of a
   disturbance on a species' reproductive success. This information will be
   useful in focusing conservation efforts on the plant species most
   vulnerable to disturbance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate how bee (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) communities repopulate

   years. All sites were identically sampled using pan traps and sweep
   netting, from early May to late September 2003, equalising collection
   effort among sites. In addition, we carried out five-minute aerial net
   samplings wherever sites contained large patches of wildflowers. We
   predicted that abundance and diversity of bees would be highest in
   recent sites and lowest in new sites. This prediction was partially
   supported: bees were most abundant in recent sites followed by control,
   then new sites, but species richness was highest (82 species) in recent
   sites, followed by new sites (67 species), then control (66 species). A
   randomisation analysis showed that there were more species than expected
   in new sites and fewer than expected in control sites. Differences in
   blossom availability likely explain differences in bee abundance and
   diversity among habitat regeneration levels. Overall, our results

Abstract = {{While the discussion of native pollinator decline has grown dramatically
   worldwide, information on how native pollinators utilise floral

   an essential component of larval and adult bee food, and whether pollen
   collection patterns change across habitats, spatial scales, and/or
   native and non-native floral resource distributions. In this study, the
   pollen collection patterns and preferences of the yellow-faced bumble
   bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, were examined across a gradient of natural and
   human-altered sites. Three hypotheses were investigated: (i)
   landscape-scale (2km) but not local-scale (250m) floral and habitat
   composition factors are most predictive of bee-collected pollen
   composition; (ii) collection of native pollen is greater in sites with
   greater proportions of natural habitat at landscape scales; and (iii)
   bees exhibit greater preference' for native versus non-native
   pollen.Bombus vosnesenskii collected more species of pollen when
   landscape-scale riparian forest cover was low but local- and
   landscape-scale floral species richness was high. Also, B.vosnesenskii
   collected pollen from a wide range of plant families and did not exhibit
   a significant preference for native versus non-native species. Finally,
   preference analysis indicated that the only significant preference
   exhibited by B.vosnesenskii during the study period was for Heteromeles
   arbutifolia, a native shrub. Overall, results from this study reveal the

Abstract = {{Landscape-wide mass-flowering of oilseed rape (canola Brassica napus)
   can considerably affect wild bee communities and pollination success of
   wild plants. We aimed to assess the impact of oilseed rape on the
   pollination of wild plants and bee abundance during and after
   oilseed-rape bloom, including effects on crop-noncrop spillover at
   landscape and adjacent-field scales. We focused on two shrub species
   (hawthorn Crataegus spp., dog rose Rosa canina) and adjacent herb
   flowering in forest edges, connected hedges, and isolated hedges in
   Lower Saxony, Germany. We selected 35 landscape circles of 1 km radius,
   differing in the amount of oilseed rape; 18 were adjacent to oilseed
   rape and 17 to cereal fields, and we quantified bee density via pan
   traps at all sites. Adjacent oilseed rape positively affected fruit mass
   and seed number per fruit of simultaneously flowering hawthorn (no
   effect on dog rose, which flowers after the oilseed rape bloom). At the
   landscape scale, oilseed rape had a negative effect on bumble bee
   density in the hedges during flowering due to dilution of pollinators
   per unit area and the consequently intensified competition between
   oilseed rape and wild shrubs, but a positive effect after flowering when
   bees moved to the hedges, which still provided resources. In contrast,
   positive landscape-scale effects of oilseed rape were found throughout
   the season in forest edges, suggesting that edges support nesting
   activity and enhanced food resources. Our results show that oilseed rape
   effects on bee abundances and pollination success in seminatural
   habitats depend on the spatial and temporal scale considered and on the
   habitat type, the wild plant species, and the time of crop flowering.
   These scale-dependent positive and negative effects should be considered
   in evaluations of landscape-scale configuration and composition of
   crops. Food resources provided by mass-flowering crops should be most
   beneficial for landscape-wide enhancement of wild bee populations if
   seminatural habitats are available, providing (1) nesting resources and
   (2) continuous flowering resources during the season.}},

Abstract = {{Floral divergence among congeners may relate to differential utilization

   To investigate whether and how floral differences are associated with
   differential utilization of pollinators in three sympatric Adenophora
   species, we analyzed floral traits and evaluated the contribution of
   different visitors to pollination. We compared visitation rates of
   different pollinator categories in different years and sites. A suite of
   floral traits differed among the three Adenophora species, suggesting
   adaptation to diurnal versus nocturnal pollination and an intermediate
   condition. However, many visitor species were shared among the three
   plant species, suggesting that floral traits did not rigorously filter
   visitors. Effective pollinators were large bees and moths. The
   importance of large bees as pollinators decreased whereas that of moths
   increased along the gradient from typically bee-pollinated to
   moth-pollinated flowers. The intermediate species (A. khasiana) differed
   substantially from the other two species in pollinator species but not
   in pollinator categories. The principal pollinator category of each
   species was constant across years and sites except in the intermediate
   species where it differed between two sites. Overall, the three

Abstract = {{Biodiversity can provide insurance against environmental change, but
   only if species differ in their response to environmental conditions
   (response diversity). Wild bees provide pollination services to wild and
   crop plants, and response diversity might insure this function against
   changing climate. To experimentally test the hypothesis that bee species
   differ in their response to increasing winter temperature, we stored
   cocoons of nine bee species at different temperatures during the winter
   (1.5-9.5 A degrees C). Bee species differed significantly in their
   responses (weight loss, weight at emergence and emergence date). The
   developmental stage during the winter explained some of these
   differences. Bee species overwintering as adults generally showed
   decreased weight and earlier emergence with increasing temperature,
   whereas bee species overwintering in pre-imaginal stages showed weaker
   or even opposite responses. This means that winter warming will likely
   affect some bee species negatively by increasing energy expenditure,
   while others are less sensitive presumably due to different physiology.
   Likewise, species phenologies will respond differently to winter
   warming, potentially affecting plant-pollinator interactions. Responses
   are not independent of current flight periods: bees active in spring
   will likely show the strongest phenological advances. Taken together,
   wild bee diversity provides response diversity to climate change, which

Abstract = {{Insects have a complex and highly successful immune system that responds
   specifically to different types of parasites. Different genotypes of a
   parasite species can differ in infectivity and virulence; which is
   important for host-parasite co-evolutionary processes, such as
   antagonistic, fluctuating selection. Such coevolution obviously requires
   a genetic basis, but little is known about how hosts immunologically
   respond to different genotypes. The common European bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris is infected by the highly prevalent trypanosome gut parasite,
   Crithidia bombi. Here we examined expression of 26 immunological and
   metabolic genes in response to infection by two clones of C. bombi and
   compared that with exposure to injection with a bacterial challenge.
   Exposure to the two clones of C. bombi elicits qualitatively different
   immune expression responses. Interestingly, infection with one clone
   results in up regulation of AMP's similar to bees given the bacterial
   challenge, while genes related to metabolism, signalling, and other
   effectors were similar between the two Crithidia exposures. Bees given
   different challenges were distinct enough to discern using linear
   discriminant analyses. We also found strong correlations, both positive
   and negative, among genes, which may shed light on how suites of genes
   are regulated and trade-offs in expression within this gene set. (C)

Abstract = {{Many pollinators specialize on a few plants as food sources and rely on
   flower scents to recognize their hosts. However, the specific compounds
   mediating this recognition are mostly unknown. We investigated the
   chemical basis of host location/recognition in the Campanula-specialist
   bee Chelostoma rapunculi using chemical, electrophysiological, and
   behavioral approaches. Our findings show that Ca. trachelium flowers
   emit a weak scent consisting of both widespread and rare (i.e.,
   spiroacetals) volatiles. In electroantennographic analyses, the antennae
   of bees responded to aliphatics, terpenes, aromatics, and spiroacetals;
   however, the bioassays revealed a more complex response picture.
   Spiroacetals attracted host-naive bees, whereas spiroacetals together
   with aliphatics and terpenes were used for host finding by
   host-experienced bees. On the intrafloral level, different flower parts
   of Ca. trachelium showed differences in the absolute and relative
   amounts of scent, including spiroacetals. Scent from pollen-presenting
   flower parts elicited more feeding responses in host-naive bees as
   compared to a scentless control, whereas host-experienced bees responded
   more to the nectar-presenting parts. Our study demonstrates the
   occurrence of learning (i.e., change in the bee's innate chemical
   search-image) after bees gain foraging experience on host flowers. We
   conclude that highly specific floral volatiles play a key role in
   host-flower recognition by this pollen-specialist bee, and discuss our

   economic value of insect pollination to the crop at a national level.
   Our data showed that winter oilseed rape is visited by a wide variety of
   insect species, including the honeybee, bumblebees, solitary bees, and
   hoverflies. The honeybee, Eristalis hoverflies and bumblebees
   (especially Bombus sensu stricto and B. lapidarius) were the best
   pollinators of winter oilseed rape based on the number of pollen grains
   they carry, visitation rates per flower and their relative abundance per

   number of seeds produced, and a 30 \% decrease in seed weight per pod in
   winter crops, with comparable values from a spring oilseed rape field
   also. The economic value of insect pollination to winter oilseed rape

Abstract = {{Plants surrounded by individuals of other co-flowering species may
   suffer a reproductive cost from interspecific pollen transfer (IPT).
   However, differences in floral architecture may reduce or eliminate IPT.
   A study was made of Pedicularis densispica (lousewort) and its common
   co-flowering species, Astragalus pastorius, to compare reproductive and
   pollination success of lousewort plants from pure and mixed patches.
   Floral architecture and pollinator behaviour on flowers of the two
   plants were compared along with the composition of stigmatic pollen load
   of the louseworts. The extent of pollen limitation of plants from pure
   and mixed patches was also explored through supplemental pollination
   with self- and outcross pollen (PLs and PLx).
   Mixed patches attracted many more nectar-searching individuals of Bombus
   richardsi. These bumble-bees moved frequently between flowers of the two
   species. However, they pollinated P. densispica with their dorsum and A.
   pastorius with their abdomen. This difference in handling almost
   completely eliminated IPT. Lousewort plants from mixed patches yielded
   more seeds, and seeds of higher mass and germinability, than those from
   pure patches. Moreover, louseworts from mixed patches had lower PLs and
   PLx compared with those from pure patches.

Abstract = {{A significant proportion of orchid species assigned to subtribe
   Oncidiinae produce floral oil as a food reward that attracts specialized
   bee pollinators. This oil is produced either by glabrous glands
   (epithelial elaiophores) or by tufts of secretory hairs (trichomal
   elaiophores). Although the structure of epithelial elaiophores in the
   Oncidiinae has been well documented, trichomal elaiophores are less
   common and have not received as much attention. Only trichomal
   elaiophores occur in the genus Lockhartia, and their distribution and
   structure are surveyed here for the first time.
   Flowers of 16 species of Lockhartia were studied. The location of floral
   elaiophores was determined histochemically and their anatomical
   organization and mode of oil secretion was investigated by means of
   light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy.
   All species of Lockhartia investigated have trichomal elaiophores on the
   adaxial surface of the labellum. Histochemical tests revealed the
   presence of lipoidal substances within the labellar trichomes. However,
   the degree of oil production and the distribution of trichomes differed
   between the three major groups of species found within the genus. All
   trichomes were unicellular and, in some species, of two distinct sizes,
   the larger being either capitate or apically branched. The trichomal
   cuticle was lamellate, and often appeared distended due to the
   subcuticular accumulation of oil. The labellar trichomes of the three
   species examined using transmission electron microscopy contained dense,
   intensely staining cytoplasm with apically located vacuoles. Oil-laden
   secretory vesicles fused with the plasmalemma and discharged their
   contents. Oil eventually accumulated between the cell wall and cuticle
   of the trichome and contained electron-transparent profiles or droplets.
   This condition is considered unique to Lockhartia among those species of
   elaiophore-bearing Oncidiinae studied to date.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the nest pollen provisions in Western Argentina are composed
   only of Prosopis, the fact that the ground-nesting bee Eremapis parvula
   visits several floral hosts suggested that it is a generalist bee
   species. In the South American Dry Chaco forest, seven nest aggregations
   of E. parvula were found during three different spring periods. From 34
   to 73 species of floral hosts were recorded around each nest
   aggregation. However, all nest pollen samples were composed of Prosopis
   pollen alone, as previously found in nests from Western Argentina. Thus,
   pollen analysis proved that E. parvula is a specialist bee of Prosopis.
   The ``monolecty{''} and ``narrow oligolecty{''} pollen specialization
   categories cannot be differentiated using pollen analysis alone. For
   this reason, a complementary floral visitation method was used. As
   several Prosopis species have been reported in floral records, the
   narrow oligolecty category for E. parvula is supported here. Considering
   that this exomalopsine is a multivoltine bee, and that flowers of some
   of the more than seven Prosopis species are always available during
   spring, synchronization between them in rainy periods is highly
   probable. Thus, it is unlikely that E. parvula has to forage on
   alternative pollen hosts.}},

Abstract = {{The flora of north-eastern Brazil offers a source of

   assessed the flora exploited by Tetragonisca angustula in two caatinga
   (dry vegetation) areas in the Brazilian semi-arid region through pollen
   analysis of honeys with the goal of answering the following questions:
   (a) What are the most representative pollens found in the honeys? (b) Do
   certain pollen types function as regional geographic markers? (c) What
   are the characteristics of the trophic niche of T. angustula in these
   areas? The honeys (n = 27) were collected every month from October 2010
   to December 2011 in Itaberaba and Ruy Barbosa, diluted in tepid water
   and 95 \% ethanol and subsequently acetolysed. The results revealed 67
   pollen types in the honeys, with 25 common to both study areas and most
   of them belonging to the family Fabaceae (> 10 types). The most frequent
   pollen types were Heteropterys, Mikania, Myrcia, Prosopis juliflora and
   Solanum for Itaberaba and Heteropterys, Mimosa tenuiflora, P. juliflora,
   Schinus, Senna macranthera, Solanum and Syagrus coronata for Ruy

Abstract = {{Determining unknown parentage in autotetraploid alfalfa (Medicago sativa

   analysis-based paternity testing SAS code, amenable to genotyping
   errors, is presented for autotetraploid species utilizing co-dominant
   molecular markers with ambiguous dosage. To demonstrate the paternity
   testing SAS code, 19 SSR loci were genotyped and analyzed on 1,107
   progeny from a commercial, isolated, clonally replicated, 16-parent
   alfalfa breeding polycross which was pollinated by leafcutter bees
   (Megachile rotundata F.). Paternal assignment success rate was over 90
   \%. Among typed progeny, 45 \% were the result of self-fertilization.
   Significant differences were detected between the 15 parents that
   produced seed and were observed as fathers for (1) total fertilizing
   pollen contribution (\% deviation from expectation), (2)
   self-fertilization rates (\%), and (3) outcrossing fertilizing pollen
   contribution (\% deviation from expectation). Physical within-cage
   distance between parental plants was correlated with outcrossing
   fertilizing pollen frequency (negative power function). Parental seed
   yield was positively correlated with total fertilizing pollen
   contribution, particularly with self-fertilization rates (42 \%
   self-fertilization and 17 \% outcrossing). These correlations suggest
   that selecting for increased seed yield may result in indirect selection
   for increased self-fertilization rates. Parental total fertilizing
   pollen contribution was 62 \% determined by outcrossing and 35 \% by
   self-fertilization. This study cautions alfalfa breeders that heretofore
   unconsidered sources of inbreeding could be present in some breeding
   materials. This study also provides cost effective and easy to use
   molecular genetic tools for detecting, managing, and/or selecting
   against (through breeding) those sources of inbreeding.}},

Abstract = {{Current bee population declines and colony failures are well documented

   investigate how these results can be due to sublethal stress impairing
   colony function. We mathematically modelled stress on individual bees
   which impairs colony function and found how positive density dependence
   can cause multiple dynamic outcomes: some colonies fail while others
   thrive. We then exposed bumblebee colonies to sublethal levels of a
   neonicotinoid pesticide. The dynamics of colony failure, which we
   observed, were most accurately described by our model. We argue that our

Abstract = {{We conducted a broad geographic survey in the northwestern United States
   to quantify production losses in the alfalfa leafcutting bee (Megachile
   rotundata (F.), Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), a solitary pollinator used
   extensively in alfalfa seed production. Viable larvae were found in only
   47.1\% of the nest cells collected at the end of the season. Most of the
   rest of the cells contained pollen balls (typified by a provision but no
   larva; 16.7\%), unknown causes of mortality (15.5\%), or larvae killed
   by chalkbrood (8.0\%). Prevalence of pollen balls was correlated
   positively with bee release rates and negatively with alfalfa stand age.
   The unknown mortality was correlated with the U. S. Department of
   Agriculture-Plant Hardiness Zone, and thus, some of the mortality may be
   caused by high temperature extremes, although the nesting season
   degree-days were not correlated with this mortality. Chalk-brood
   prevalence was correlated with possible nesting-resource or
   crowding-related factors, such as the number of bees released per
   hectare and the number of shelters used, but not with nesting board
   disinfection practices. Vapona is used to control parasitoids when the
   parent bees are incubated before release, and use of this fumigant was
   associated with an increase in both chalkbrood and diapausing offspring,

Abstract = {{With growing concern surrounding global pollinator declines, it is
   important to understand how habitat destruction and agricultural

   tropical forest-dependent pollinators responsible for pollination of
   both economically important crops and wild plant species. A growing body
   of work has focused on the effect of habitat fragmentation on euglossine
   bees, yet little is known about how these bees are impacted by
   agricultural intensification. Coffee cultivation is widespread in the
   tropics, and its management is conducted along a gradient of intensity,
   which ranges from monoculture (i.e., no shade, high inputs) to
   polyculture (shade overstory retained, fewer inputs). We used a
   landscape in Soconusco, Chiapas, Mexico, that allowed for comparison
   between monoculture and polyculture coffee farms, while holding distance
   to native habitat, as well as native habitat quality, constant. We found
   that habitat management influenced abundance, estimated richness, and
   community composition of euglossine bees. The polyculture coffee farm
   boasts a more similar community composition to the forest than to the
   monoculture coffee farm. In addition, the polyculture farm had almost
   double the euglossine abundance compared with the monoculture farm. Our
   results suggest that coffee management regimes may strongly impact

Abstract = {{Pollinators serve critical roles for the functioning of terrestrial
   ecosystems, and have an estimated annual value of over \$150 billion for
   global agriculture. Mounting evidence from agricultural systems reveals
   that pollinators are declining in many regions of the world, and with a
   lack of information on whether pollinator communities in natural systems
   are following similar trends, identifying factors which support
   pollinator visitation and services are important for ameliorating the
   effects of the current global pollinator crisis. We investigated how
   fire affects resource structure and how that variation influences floral
   pollinator communities by comparing burn versus control treatments in a
   southeastern USA old-field system. We hypothesized and found a positive
   relationship between fire and plant density of a native forb, Verbesina
   alternifolia, as well as a significant difference in floral visitation
   of V. alternifolia between burn and control treatments. V. alternifolia
   density was 44\% greater and floral visitation was 54\% greater in
   burned treatments relative to control sites. When the density of V.
   alternifolia was experimentally reduced in the burn sites to equivalent
   densities observed in control sites, floral visitation in burned sites
   declined to rates found in control sites. Our results indicate that
   plant density is a proximal mechanism by which an imposed fire regime
   can indirectly impact floral visitation, suggesting its usefulness as a
   tool for management of pollination services. Although concerns surround
   the negative impacts of management, indirect positive effects may
   provide an important direction to explore for managing future ecological
   and conservation issues. Studies examining the interaction among
   resource concentration, plant apparency, and how fire affects the
   evolutionary consequences of altered patterns of floral visitation are
   overdue.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator mutualisms are one of the several functional
   relationships that must be reinstated to ensure the long-term success of
   habitat restoration projects. These mutualisms are unlikely to reinstate
   themselves until all of the resource requirements of pollinators have
   been met. By meeting these requirements, projects can improve their
   long-term success. We hypothesized that pollinator assemblage and
   structure and stability of plant-pollinator networks depend both on
   aspects of the surrounding landscape and of the restoration effort
   itself. We predicted that pollinator species diversity and network
   stability would be negatively associated with distance from remnant
   habitat, but that local floral diversity might rescue pollinator
   diversity and network stability in locations distant from the remnant.
   We created plots of native prairie on a reclaimed strip mine in central
   Ohio, U.S.A. that ranged in floral diversity and isolation from the
   remnant habitat. We found that the pollinator diversity declined with
   distance from the remnant habitat. Furthermore, reduced pollinator
   diversity in low floral diversity plots far from the remnant habitat was
   associated with loss of network stability. High floral diversity,
   however, compensated for losses in pollinator diversity in plots far
   from the remnant habitat through the attraction of generalist
   pollinators. Generalist pollinators increased network connectance and
   plant-niche overlap. As a result, network robustness of high floral
   diversity plots was independent of isolation. We conclude that the
   aspects of the restoration effort itself, such as floral community
   composition, can be successfully tailored to incorporate the restoration
   of pollinators and improve success given a particular landscape context.}},

   pollinators spectra has allowed to designate groups (subcomplexes) of
   plants with regard to dominance of various groups of pollinators:
   myiophylous (flies from the superfamily Muscomorha dominate),
   syphidophylous (flies from the family Syrphidae dominate), psychophylous
   (butterflies dominate), cantharophylous (beetles dominate),
   nonspecialized and specialized melittophylous (Apidae, mainly
   bumblebees, dominate). The belonging of plants to a specific subcomplex
   is defined mainly by the structure of flowers and inflorescences. Modes
   of mechanical and attractive isolation are discussed that lead to
   restriction of pollinators composition. Competition abatement between
   species with similar spectra of pollinators and belonging to the same
   subcomplex is achieved mainly by spatial (ecological) and temporal
   (different timing of flowering) isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Chinese privet (Ligustrum sinense) is an invasive shrub of the
   Southeastern U.S. that forms dense stands and limits biodiversity. It
   was removed from heavily infested riparian forests of the Georgia
   Piedmont in 2005 by mulching machine or chainsaw felling and subsequent
   herbicide application. Abundance and species richness of bees and
   butterflies were sampled using pan traps on removal plots, heavily
   invaded control plots, and reference plots in 2012, approximately five
   years after complete removal of privet. Removal plots had nearly three
   times as many species as control plots and were similar to reference
   plots in numbers of species. Traps on removal plots captured four times
   more individuals than those on control plots and similar numbers to
   reference plots. Bee and butterfly abundance and richness were
   positively correlated with non-privet plant cover, diversity, and
   evenness and negatively correlated with privet shrub cover. Removing
   Chinese privet from riparian forests had a beneficial effect on insect
   pollinator communities five years after removal and is a relatively
   simple method of improving pollinator habitat. These findings provide
   justification for allocating resources for invasive shrub species
   removal to support long term conservation of these important insect
   groups and the ecological services they provide. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective was to identify the reproductive phenology and the
   pollination and dispersal syndromes of understory species of
   Semi-deciduous Dry Forest. The work was carried out from May 2010 to May
   2011 in a forest fragment, about 29 hectares, localized in Catalao city,
   Goias State, Brazil. The phenological phases were observed weekly along
   a transect at 1000m. Pollination and dispersion syndromes were
   determined through literature data, and theses data were linked to
   phenology. The flowering proportion reached the peak (43,13\%) in
   December 2010 (rainy) and fruiting (30\%) in September 2010 (dry).
   Acanthaceae flowering peak in May 2010 and February 2011; Piperaceae
   peaked in October 2010 and Rubiaceae in December 2010. Fruiting in the
   Acanthaceae occurred during the dry period and the beginning of the
   rainy season, with the highest incidence in October 2010, Piperaceae
   reached their peak in May 2011, while in the Rubiaceae, it went on for
   11 months, with the highest incidence being in March 2011. Two
   Acanthaceae and one Piperaceae species not fruited, but all species
   presented flowering. Pollination syndromes found were Ornithophily,
   peaking in May 2010, Melittophily, in October 2010, and Psycophily, in
   January 2011. Dispersal syndromes found were Anemochoric, with a higher
   incidence in October 2010, and Ornithocoric with two peaks, one in July
   2010 and other in May 2011. The year-long presence of flowering and/or
   fruiting species contributes to the survival and dynamics of the
   community studied, because these species play an important role
   maintaining bees and birds in the fragment, which are important vectors
   of pollination and dispersal, respectively. Considering the rapid loss
   of the Cerrado vegetation in recent times and the study site to be a
   fragment localized inside the urban environment, the conservation of the
   green area becomes important, regardless of its small size, due to the
   important ecological processes that lie therein, as portrayed in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Distyly is a genetically controlled flower dimorphism. Most species in

   Makino consisted of one floral morph only in the populations studied in
   southern China. The present study aimed at illuminating the
   characteristics of floral monomorphism in M. shikokiana, and elucidating
   the mechanism behind the evolution of monomorphism from distyly. We
   examined floral morphology in five natural populations across the
   species' distribution range. Experiments and observations on the floral
   biology, pollinating fauna, and breeding system were carried out in two
   to four natural populations. We also screened allozyme markers to
   estimate the degree of outcrossing. The results indicated that M.
   shikokiana was a self-compatible, partially autogamous species and
   pollinators were required to maximize seed set. Anthers dehisced and
   pollen showed the highest viability 8-12h before flower opening, and
   stigmas were receptive in bud, resulting in bud-selfing. Pollen
   viability decreased sharply after flower opening, whereas stigma
   receptivity lasted to the third day. Pollinators including bees,
   butterflies, and hawkmoths visited the flowers of M. shikokiana
   frequently at the study sites. There was no significant difference among
   pollen tube growth rates in selfing and outcrossing; pollen tubes
   reached ovules within 16h in all treatments, indicating lack of typical
   self-incompatibility or cryptic self-incompatibility. Our results
   suggested that M. shikokiana is a homostylous species, and that
   homostyly promoting self-pollination was selected in its evolutionary

Abstract = {{Premise of research.The rush family (Juncaceae) is most often described

   approximate to approximate to 700. Few pollen grains were transported by
   wind to sticky slides in close proximity to plants, and the seed set of

Abstract = {{1. Understanding the environmental factors that structure biodiversity
   and food webs among communities is central to assess and mitigate the
   impact of landscape changes. Wildflower strips are ecological
   compensation areas established in farmland to increase pollination
   services and biological control of crop pests and to conserve insect
   diversity. They are arranged in networks in order to favour high species
   richness and abundance of the fauna. We describe results from
   experimental wildflower strips in a fragmented agricultural landscape,
   comparing the importance of landscape, of spatial arrangement and of
   vegetation on the diversity and abundance of trap-nesting bees, wasps
   and their enemies, and the structure of their food webs. The proportion
   of forest cover close to the wildflower strips and the landscape
   heterogeneity stood out as the most influential landscape elements,
   resulting in a more complex trap-nest community with higher abundance
   and richness of hosts, and with more links between species in the food
   webs and a higher diversity of interactions. We disentangled the
   underlying mechanisms for variation in these quantitative food web
   metrics. We conclude that in order to increase the diversity and
   abundance of pollinators and biological control agents and to favour a
   potentially stable community of cavity-nesting hymenoptera in wildflower
   strips, more investment is needed in the conservation and establishment
   of forest habitats within agro-ecosystems, as a reservoir of beneficial

Abstract = {{Although secondary metabolites are prevalent in floral nectar, the
   ecological consequences for pollinators and pollination remain
   relatively unexplored. While often deterrent to pollinators at high
   concentrations, secondary metabolite concentrations in nectar tend to be
   much lower than secondary metabolite concentrations in leaves and
   flowers; yet, they may still affect the maintenance of pollination
   mutualisms.Delphinium barbeyi, a common montane herb, contains
   norditerpene alkaloids in its nectar but at concentrations that are
   substantially lower than those found in its leaves or flowers. By
   manipulating nectar alkaloid concentrations in the field and laboratory,
   we assessed the degree to which varying concentrations of alkaloids in
   nectar influenced pollinator behaviour and activity and plant
   reproduction. In the field, nectar alkaloids significantly reduced both
   the number of flower visits and the time spent per flower by free-flying
   bumblebee pollinators, but we only observed effects at alkaloid
   concentrations 50 times that of natural nectar. When we supplemented
   D.barbeyi nectar with alkaloids at concentrations almost 15 times that
   of natural nectar, we found no evidence for direct or
   pollinator-mediated indirect effects on female plant reproduction. In
   the laboratory, the direct consumptive effects of nectar alkaloids on
   bumblebee pollinators were also concentration dependent. Bumblebees
   exhibited reduced mobility and vigour but only at alkaloid
   concentrations more than 25 times higher than those found in natural
   nectar.Synthesis. We found that nectar alkaloids have dose-dependent
   effects on pollinator behaviour and activity. While concentrations of
   nectar alkaloids rivalling those found in leaves would negatively affect
   pollinator behaviour and pollination services, the natural
   concentrations of nectar alkaloids in D.barbeyi have no negative direct
   or pollinator-mediated indirect effects on plant reproduction. These
   results provide experimental insight into the dose-dependent ecological
   consequences of nectar secondary metabolites for pollinators and
   pollination, suggesting that low nectar alkaloid concentrations incurred
   no ecological costs for D.barbeyi.}},

Abstract = {{Even though the importance of selection for trait evolution is well
   established, we still lack a functional understanding of the mechanisms
   underlying phenotypic selection. Because animals necessarily use their
   sensory system to perceive phenotypic traits, the model of sensory bias
   assumes that sensory systems are the main determinant of signal
   evolution. Yet, it has remained poorly known how sensory systems
   contribute to shaping the fitness surface of selected individuals. In a
   greenhouse experiment, we quantified the strength and direction of
   selection on floral coloration in a population of cornflowers exposed to
   bumblebees as unique pollinators during 4days. We detected significant
   selection on the chromatic and achromatic (brightness) components of
   floral coloration. We then studied whether these patterns of selection
   are explicable by accounting for the visual system of the pollinators.
   Using data on bumblebee colour vision, we first showed that bumblebees
   should discriminate among quantitative colour variants. The observed
   selection was then compared to the selection predicted by psychophysical
   models of bumblebee colour vision. The achromatic but not the chromatic
   channel of the bumblebee's visual system could explain the observed
   pattern of selection. These results highlight that (i) pollinators can
   select quantitative variation in floral coloration and could thus
   account for a gradual evolution of flower coloration, and (ii)
   stimulation of the visual system represents, at least partly, a
   functional mechanism potentially explaining pollinators' selection on
   floral colour variants.}},

   flowers belonging to 63 plant species were recorded in the hedgerows
   from May to September 2012. Flower abundance and species richness
   decreased as the season progressed. Orchard differences were observed
   for plant species richness but not for the total number of flowers in
   the hedgerows, likely as a result of similar management among orchards.
   Hymenoptera pollinators (honey bees, bumblebees and wild bees) accounted
   for 37.8\% of the total insects recorded visiting flowers, whereas
   predatory hoverflies (14.9\%) were the dominant natural enemies. The

   unoccupied and occupied carpenter bee nests could lead to (a) an
   increase in crop visitation by carpenter bees and (b) a decrease in
   visitation by thieves. We found that introduction of occupied nests can
   influence visitation by both carpenter bees and thieves in the expected
   ways, while the sole provision of unoccupied nests did not achieve this.
   Our study can be regarded as an important step for increasing
   pollinators' population in yellow passion fruit orchards using
   trap-nests as nesting substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Bathysa australis is a common subcanopy tree from
   the Atlantic Forest that is pollinated by bees and wasps and produces
   autochoric seeds. This species exhibits great phenotypic plasticity
   along the elevational gradient of Serra do Mar in southeastern Brazil.
   We expect to assess the genetic diversity and gene flow between
   populations of this species along the elevational gradient.
   Methods and Results: We developed a microsatellite-enriched genomic
   library for B. australis, and 10 microsatellite loci were successfully
   amplified, ranging from one to 13 alleles per locus. The observed and
   expected heterozygosities ranged from 0.333 to 0.900 (average: 0.629)
   and 0.564 to 0.900 (average: 0.742), respectively.
   Conclusions: These are the first microsatellite markers developed for
   the genus Bathysa and may be useful in other species of the Condamineeae
   tribe. These primers will be an important tool for studies of population

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{169-173}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The proximal reasons and ultimal consequences of decisions made during
   foraging by breeding individuals are widely studied in numerous avian
   systems. However, the effects of these decisions are more pronounced in
   migratory birds because they spend more time and energy foraging than on
   the actual journey itself. The peak flowering and pollination period of
   crops in southern Israel, when large numbers of hives are transported to
   the region, coincide with the peak migration of Bee-eaters. We
   hypothesized that Bee-eaters cue on conspecifics while foraging at a
   stopover site, react to perceived danger at a given foraging patch, and
   that the degree of risk taken by an individual was a function of body
   condition and sex. Bee-eaters were caught on 44 different mornings in
   spring 2004, 2005, and 2009. A sex-dependent trapping was noted and
   significantly more females were caught in the first bout. The sex ratio
   remained significantly male biased in bouts 3-8. Birds caught in the
   first bout were heavier in comparison to those caught in the second
   bout, and there was a significant interaction between sex and bouts.
   From the second bout onwards both sexes showed a significant increase in
   body mass, by 1.05 g/bout on average (+/- 0.6 SD), however wing lengths
   remained similar for both sexes. We conclude that migrant Bee-eaters cue
   on conspecifics to evaluate predation risks when socially foraging at a
   localized food patch and males, who we assume to be time-minimizers, are
   more likely to forage at a novel site and once danger of foraging is
   perceived only high energy demand individuals will attempt to hunt. (C)

Abstract = {{Climate change has the potential to alter the phenological synchrony

   with historical records of bee pollinators over the same period. When
   the key apple pollinators are considered altogether, we found extensive
   synchrony between bee activity and apple peak bloom due to
   complementarity among bee species' activity periods, and also a stable
   trend over time due to differential responses to warming climate among
   bee species. A simulation model confirms that high biodiversity levels

Abstract = {{The continuing spread of exotic plants and increasing human land-use are
   two major drivers of global change threatening ecosystems, species and
   their interactions. Separate effects of these two drivers on
   plant-pollinator interactions have been thoroughly studied, but we still
   lack an understanding of combined and potential interactive effects. In
   a subtropical South African landscape, we studied 17 plant-pollinator
   networks along two gradients of relative abundance of exotics and
   land-use intensity. In general, pollinator visitation rates were lower
   on exotic plants than on native ones. Surprisingly, while visitation
   rates on native plants increased with relative abundance of exotics and
   land-use intensity, pollinator visitation on exotic plants decreased
   along the same gradients. There was a decrease in the specialization of
   plants on pollinators and vice versa with both drivers, regardless of
   plant origin. Decreases in pollinator specialization thereby seemed to
   be mediated by a species turnover towards habitat generalists. However,
   contrary to expectations, we detected no interactive effects between the
   two drivers. Our results suggest that exotic plants and land-use promote
   generalist plants and pollinators, while negatively affecting
   specialized plant-pollinator interactions. Weak integration and high
   specialization of exotic plants may have prevented interactive effects
   between exotic plants and land-use. Still, the additive effects of

   would have been overlooked in a single-factor study. We therefore
   highlight the need to consider multiple drivers of global change in

   tree Tetracentron sinense Oliv. (Trochodendraceae)}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL STUDIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tetracentron sinense Oliv. is an endangered tree mainly
   distributed in south-central China. The breeding system and pollination
   ecology of T. sinense are unclear. With a conservation perspective, the
   floral biology, breeding system and pollination ecology of Tetracentron
   sinense Oliv. were investigated, in order to discuss the endangered
   factors related to pollination, and to provide important information for
   its conservation.
   Results: Our results revealed four important aspects of the reproductive
   biology of T. sinense. 1) T. sinense usually flowers by the beginning of
   June, and the flowering period of the population is about two months,
   and the florescence of florets lasted for 15 to 24 days with delicate
   fragrance. 2) The pollen/ovule ratio is 720 +/- 28, and the outcrossing
   index is three. Artificial pollination experiments showed that T.
   sinense is self-compatible, with facultative xenogamy and no indication
   of agamospermy. 3) The pollination syndrome is ambophily, and
   self-pollination plays an important role in fruit production if wind and
   insect pollination is unavailable. 4) Insect pollinators were
   predominantly represented by Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera.
   Syrphid fly and bees were the main effective pollinators.
   Conclusions: The results suggested that T. sinense exhibits a
   mixed-mating system, and autogamy in its breeding system may provide
   reproductive assurance for the population maintenance. During flowering
   and pollination in natural population, the decrease of population
   density and harsh environmental condition might be one of crucial
   reasons resulting in endanger for this species.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Bees and eudicot plants both arose in the mid-late Cretaceous, and their
   co-evolutionary relationships have often been assumed as an important
   element in the rise of flowering plants. Given the near-complete
   dependence of bees on eudicots we would expect that major extinction
   events affecting the latter would have also impacted bees. However,
   given the very patchy distribution of bees in the fossil record,
   identifying any such extinctions using fossils is very problematic. Here
   we use molecular phylogenetic analyses to show that one bee group, the
   Xylocopinae, originated in the mid-Cretaceous, coinciding with the early
   radiation of the eudicots. Lineage through time analyses for this bee
   subfamily show very early diversification, followed by a long period of
   seemingly no radiation and then followed by rapid diversification in
   each of the four constituent tribes. These patterns are consistent with
   both a long-fuse model of radiation and a massive extinction event close
   to the K-T boundary. We argue that massive extinction is much more
   plausible than a long fuse, given the historical biogeography of these
   bees and the diversity of ecological niches that they occupy. Our
   results suggest that events near the K-T boundary would have disrupted
   many plant-bee relationships, with major consequences for the subsequent
   evolution of eudicots and their pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Eusocial behavior has arisen in few animal groups, most notably in the

   Hymenoptera remain contentious {[}6-12]. We address this problem here by
   generating and analyzing genomic data for a representative series of
   taxa. We obtain a single well-resolved and strongly supported tree,
   robust to multiple methods of phylogenetic inference. Apoidea
   (spheciform wasps and bees) and ants are sister groups, a novel finding
   that contradicts earlier views that ants are closer to ectoparasitoid
   wasps. Vespid wasps (paper wasps, yellow jackets, and relatives) are
   sister to all other aculeates except chrysidoids. Thus, all eusocial
   species of Hymenoptera are contained within two major groups,
   characterized by transport of larval provisions and nest construction,
   likely prerequisites for the evolution of eusociality. These two
   lineages are interpolated among three other clades of wasps whose

Abstract = {{Generalist pollinators are important in many habitats, but little
   research has been done on small-scale spatial variation in interactions
   between them and the plants that they visit. Here, using a spatially
   explicit approach, we examined whether multiple species of flowering
   plants occurring within a single meadow showed spatial structure in
   their generalist pollinator assemblages. We report the results for eight
   plant species for which at least 200 individual visits were recorded. We
   found that for all of these species, the proportions of their general
   pollinator assemblages accounted for by particular functional groups
   showed spatial heterogeneity at the scale of tens of metres. This
   heterogeneity was connected either with no or only subtle changes of
   vegetation and flowering species composition. In five of these species,
   differences in conspecific plant density influenced the pollinator
   communities (with greater dominance of main pollinators at
   low-conspecific plant densities). The density of heterospecific plant
   individuals influenced the pollinator spectrum in one case. Our results
   indicate that the picture of plant-pollinator interactions provided by
   averaging data within large plots may be misleading and that within-site
   spatial heterogeneity should be accounted for in terms of sampling

Abstract = {{The proliferation of oil palm plantations has led to dramatic changes in
   tropical landscapes across the globe. However, relatively little is
   known about the effects of oil palm expansion on biodiversity,
   especially in key ecosystem-service providing organisms like
   pollinators. Rapid land use change is exacerbated by limited knowledge
   of the mechanisms causing biodiversity decline in the tropics,
   particularly those involving landscape features. We examined these
   mechanisms by undertaking a survey of orchid bees, a well-known group of
   Neotropical pollinators, across forest and oil palm plantations in Costa
   Rica. We used chemical baits to survey the community in four regions:
   continuous forest sites, oil palm sites immediately adjacent to forest,
   oil palm sites 2km from forest, and oil palm sites greater than 5km from
   forest. We found that although orchid bees are present in all
   environments, orchid bee communities diverged across the gradient, and
   community richness, abundance, and similarity to forest declined as
   distance from forest increased. In addition, mean phylogenetic distance
   of the orchid bee community declined and was more clustered in oil palm.
   Community traits also differed with individuals in oil palm having
   shorter average tongue length and larger average geographic range size
   than those in the forest. Our results indicate two key features about
   Neotropical landscapes that contain oil palm: 1) oil palm is selectively
   permeable to orchid bees and 2) orchid bee communities in oil palm have
   distinct phylogenetic and trait structure compared to communities in
   forest. These results suggest that conservation and management efforts

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollination benefits over three quarters of the world's major
   crops. There is growing concern that observed declines in pollinators
   may impact on production and revenues from animal pollinated crops.
   Knowing the distribution of pollinators is therefore crucial for
   estimating their availability to pollinate crops; however, in general,
   we have an incomplete knowledge of where these pollinators occur. We
   propose a method to predict geographical patterns of pollination service
   to crops, novel in two elements: the use of pollinator records rather
   than expert knowledge to predict pollinator occurrence, and the
   inclusion of the managed pollinator supply. We integrated a maximum
   entropy species distribution model (SDM) with an existing pollination
   service model (PSM) to derive the availability of pollinators for crop
   pollination. We used nationwide records of wild and managed pollinators
   (honey bees) as well as agricultural data from Great Britain. We first
   calibrated the SDM on a representative sample of bee and hoverfly crop
   pollinator species, evaluating the effects of different settings on
   model performance and on its capacity to identify the most important
   predictors. The importance of the different predictors was better
   resolved by SDM derived from simpler functions, with consistent results
   for bees and hoverflies. We then used the species distributions from the
   calibrated model to predict pollination service of wild and managed
   pollinators, using field beans as a test case. The PSM allowed us to
   spatially characterize the contribution of wild and managed pollinators
   and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low pollination
   service provision, which can help direct local scale interventions. This
   approach can be extended to investigate geographical mismatches between
   crop pollination demand and the availability of pollinators, resulting
   from environmental change or policy scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{In many flowering plants individual fruits contain a mixture of half-

   probed consecutively during a single pollinator visitation sequence,
   will have a lower effective number of mates. We compared these
   predictions with observed values for bumble bee-pollinated Mimulus
   ringens, which has restricted carryover, and hummingbird-pollinated

   predicted that the effective number of mates is much higher in the

Abstract = {{Floral oils as reward to pollinators occur in eleven plant families and
   appeared at least 28 times in the evolutionary history of flowering
   plants. They are produced in epithelial or tricomatic glands and
   collected by oil bee visitors. The present paper focuses on
   floral-oil-producing species of Plantaginaceae, a Neotropical group
   namely Angelonia clade. This group comprises around 40 described species
   in the genera Angelonia, Basistemon, Monttea, Monopera and the oil-less
   Melosperma. We present a revision of all species of the Angelonia clade,
   their geographical distribution, resources offered to pollinators and
   records of flower visitors, especially oil-collecting bees. These plants
   rely only on oil-collecting species in the tribe Centridini and
   Tapinotaspidini for a successful pollination, being the interaction
   between both partners an especial case of bee/flower adaptation in
   Neotropical region. Some bee species depend only on the oil of
   Plantaginaceae flowers to survive, while others can collect on several
   floral oil sources. The pollinating bees explore the oil glands located
   in sacs using specialized hairs in the forelegs. With this study, we
   hope to inspire further research relating to this fascinating group of
   plants, in which most species are rare and occur in highly endangered
   habitats in South American open vegetation biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploidization is common among angiosperms and might induce typically
   allogamous plants to become autogamous (self-compatible, relying on
   sexual self-fertilization) or apomictic (achieving asexual reproduction
   through seeds). This work aimed to determine whether neopolyploidy leads
   to the breakdown of the self-incompatibility system in the hexaploid
   non-apomictic species Handroanthus serratifolius (Vahl) S. Grose,
   through analyses of its floral biology, pollination biology and breeding
   system. Although anthesis lasted for three days, increasing the overall
   floral display, receptivity decreased as of the second day. Centridini
   and Euglossini bees were the main pollinators, and low nectar
   availability (1.95 +/- 1.91 mu l/flower) might have obliged them to
   visit multiple flowers. We observed low reproductive efficacy. That
   might be explained by self-sterility and by the great number of flowers
   per individual, which could increase the frequency of geitonogamy. Ovule
   penetration by the pollen tubes in self-pollinated pistils with
   posterior abscission indicated late-acting self-incompatibility in H.
   serratifolius, as observed in other diploid Bignoniaceae species,
   although inbreeding depression cannot be excluded. The self-sterility
   found in the monoembryonic, hexaploid individuals studied here contrasts
   with the results for other neopolyploid Handroanthus and Anemopaegma
   species, which are often autogamous and apomictic. Our results suggest
   that neopolyploidy is not the main factor leading to self-fertility in
   Handroanthus.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies on native bees in urban tropical environments are
   rare, however, ever-increasing urban areas world-wide necessitate study
   on how many of these bees can and have adjusted to human constructs.
   Predictable ecological patterns that emerge from these studies can
   provide guidance on how future urban constructs can be designed to
   provide habitat for conserving and protecting native bees. These
   patterns can also be used for bee habitat restoration in natural and
   agricultural environments. An extensive survey of native bees and honey
   bees and their relationships to a community of 102 plant types in urban
   residential environments of Bagaces and Liberia in northwestern Costa
   Rica was conducted from 2003-2012. Bees were attracted and recorded at
   measurable frequencies to 82 plant genera in 41 families, the most
   common of which was Fabaceae. Forty-two plant types were native
   ornamentals; 39 were non-natives; and 21 were native weed species.
   Standardized bee visitation (frequency) counts, 17,000+, were used to
   record relationships between bees and flowers. The following data were
   recorded for each plant type: flowering phenology in months, type of
   floral reward(s) (pollen, nectar, and/or oil), main daily attraction
   period, and most frequently visiting bee taxa. Plant life forms included
   trees, shrubs, lianas/vines, herbs, and palms. Each plant group had a
   different seasonal flowering phenology with native ornamentals and
   native weeds having patterns that closely resembled the general patterns
   for wild plants in the dry forest. Predictable associations of certain
   bee taxa with each plant type emerged from the count data, which allowed
   for categorizing relationships into four types: small bee, diverse bee,
   specialized bee, and nocturnal pollination systems. Intraspecific
   variations in bee attraction to several plant types were also noted.
   Honey bees (Africanized) did not figure prominently in most pollination
   relationships, especially with regard to native plants. Most native bee
   species were generalized foragers. Beyond the urban environment, it is
   suggested that knowledge of predictable bee-flower relationships can
   also be used to restore bee habitat in disturbed environments such as
   deforested areas. With some imagination and outreach education, bee
   habitats could also be installed for some agricultural crops.
   Outreaching information on native bee-flower relationships at local,
   regional, and state levels is important for short and long-term
   propagation of urban (and agricultural) plants. Yet, very few outlets
   for transferring this knowledge currently exist in Costa Rica. A few
   limited options for sharing this information are discussed, including
   collaborative partnerships with local NGOs.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation to different pollinators is considered one of the
   possible initial stages of ecological speciation as reproductive
   isolation is a by-product of the divergence in pollination systems.
   However, pollinator-mediated divergent selection will not necessarily
   result in complete reproductive isolation, because incipient speciation
   is often overcome by gene flow. We investigated the potential of
   pollinator shift in the sexually deceptive orchids Ophrys sphegodes and
   Ophrys exaltata and compared the levels of floral isolation vs. genetic
   distance among populations with contrasting predominant pollinators. We
   analysed floral hydrocarbons as a proxy for floral divergence between
   populations. Floral adoption of pollinators and their fidelity was
   tested using pollinator choice experiments. Interpopulation gene flow
   and population differentiation levels were estimated using AFLP markers.
   The Tyrrhenian O.sphegodes population preferentially attracted the
   pollinator bee Andrena bimaculata, whereas the Adriatic O.sphegodes
   population exclusively attracted A.nigroaenea. Significant differences
   in scent component proportions were identified in O.sphegodes
   populations that attracted different preferred pollinators. High
   interpopulation gene flow was detected, but populations were genetically
   structured at species level. The high interpopulation gene flow levels
   independent of preferred pollinators suggest that local adaptation to
   different pollinators has not (yet) generated detectable genome-wide
   separation. Alternatively, despite extensive gene flow, few genes
   underlying floral isolation remain differentiated as a consequence of
   divergent selection. Different pollination ecotypes in O.sphegodes might
   represent a local selective response imposed by temporal variation in a
   geographical mosaic of pollinators as a consequence of the frequent
   disturbance regimes typical of Ophrys habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are key pollinators in almost all terrestrial ecosystems and can
   have major roles in agricultural production. Records of bees in the
   Southwest Pacific indicate a very low diversity, with the Fijian bee
   fauna one of the least diverse, despite an otherwise rich biota.
   Megachilid bees represent a large proportion of the bee fauna for almost
   all island groups in the Southwest Pacific and, because they are wood-
   and stem-nesting, their wide distribution is likely to have been
   influenced by rafting and anthropogenic maritime trade. Our study is the
   first to apply molecular techniques to the study of megachilid bees in
   this region and indicates between four and five recent introductions to
   Fiji, likely from Southeast Asia. The study also provides the first
   record of Heriades (Michenerella) in the Southwest Pacific and the first
   record of the subgenus Megachile (Callomegachile) in Fiji. These results
   indicate that a large proportion of the Fijian bee fauna is likely to
   have been introduced only very recently and, therefore, has had only a
   very recent role in Fijian ecosystems, despite their current abundance.
   This has very wide implications for understanding Fijian
   plant-pollinator relationships. We argue that there is a strong need to
   understand ancient plant-pollinator relationships that may have evolved
   in Fiji before the mid late Pleistocene and Holocene and whether these
   could be disrupted by recent bee introductions.}},

Abstract = {{Pulsed food resources lead to mismatches between distribution of
   consumers and resources in space and time. Many studies have
   investigated how pollinators and floral resources covary in space, but
   few have looked at their covariance among years. I studied responses of
   two bee taxa, Bombus (a social genus) and Anthophora (a solitary genus),
   to variation in flowering by Astragalus scaphoides, a perennial herb
   that flowers in alternate years. First, I quantified the rate at which
   individual plants were visited by bees. Anthophora showed evidence of a
   demographic response to resource pulsesthat is, more individuals were
   seen in the year after a high-flowering yearwhereas Bombus did not.
   Second, I quantified pollinator behavior by following individual bees
   and recording the proportion of visits to A. scaphoides within single
   foraging bouts. The proportion of visits to A. scaphoides by both taxa
   increased with A. scaphoides''s flowering density. Higher specialization
   in high-flowering years likely makes both taxa better pollinators in
   high-flowering years. If these taxa differ in effectiveness as
   pollinators, then these responses translate into variation in
   pollination services in space and time, specifically, more activity by
   Bombus in high-flowering years and more by Anthophora in years following
   high-flowering years. They also emphasize that pollinator activity
   depends in part on pastas well as currentfloral resources.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological networks of two interacting guilds of species, such as
   flowering plants and pollinators, are common in nature, and studying
   their structure can yield insights into their resilience to
   environmental disturbances. Here we develop analytical methods for
   exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks
   consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then
   apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator
   community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the
   statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related
   pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative
   frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit
   closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait
   information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely
   responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are
   important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect
   pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced
   their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced
   earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species
   experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the
   eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient
   to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have
   ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed
   here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct
   pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore,
   pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition;
   closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant
   species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting
   different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and
   symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers
   of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants
   share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a
   common fate in a changing climate.}},

Abstract = {{Reciprocal herkogamy, including enantiostyly and heterostyly, involves
   reciprocity in the relative positions of the sexual elements within the
   flower. Such systems result in morphologically and, since pollen is
   deposited on and captured from different parts of the pollinator,
   functionally distinct floral forms. Deviations from the basic pattern
   may modify the functionality of these mechanisms. For heterostylous
   species, such deviations are generally related to environmental
   disturbances, pollination services and/or reduced numbers of one floral
   morph. Deviations for enantiostylous species have not yet been reported.
   This study aims to investigate enantiostyly in Chamaecrista flexuosa, in
   particular the presence of deviations from the standard form, in an area
   of coastal vegetation in north-east Brazil.
   Observations and investigations of floral biology, the reproductive
   system, pollinator behaviour, floral morphology and morphometry were
   performed.
   In C. flexuosa flowers, anthers of different size but similar function
   are grouped. The flowers were self-compatible and set fruits after every
   treatment, except in the spontaneous self-pollination experiment,
   thereby indicating their dependence on pollen vectors. The flowers were
   pollinated by bees, especially Xylocopa cearensis and X. grisencens.
   Pollen is deposited and captured from the ventral portion of the
   pollinators body. Variations in the spatial arrangement of floral
   elements allowed for the identification of floral morphs based on both
   morphological and functional criteria. Using morphological criteria,
   morphologically right (MR) and morphologically left (ML) floral morphs
   were identified. Three floral morphs were identified using functional
   criteria: functionally right (FR), functionally central (FC) and
   functionally left (FL). Combinations of morphologically and functionally
   defined morphs did not occur in equal proportions. There was a reduced
   frequency of the MRFR combination.
   The results indicate the occurrence of an atypical enantiostyly in C.
   flexuosa. This seems to improve reproductive success by increasing the
   efficiency of pollen deposition and capture.}},

   parasite represents an obligate first step in the appearance of a brood
   parasitic lineage; this ultimately evolves into a strategy in which an
   open host cell is parasitized and the host offspring is killed by a
   specialized larval instar. The transition to parasitizing open nest
   cells expanded the range of potential hosts for brood parasitic bees and
   played a fundamental role in the patterns of diversification seen in

   specialization and consequently enhanced reproductive assurance. The

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator relationships are often mediated by floral traits that
   advertise the presence or amount of rewards. However, herbivores may
   also use these traits to find their hosts. In Dalechampia scandens, we
   tested whether floral advertisements that attract pollinators were also
   used by seed predators, and whether this generated conflicting selection
   pressures. We studied the influence of natural variation in the size of
   showy bracts, amount of reward, and two shape traits on pollinator
   visitation, pollen arrival on stigmas, seed production and seed
   predation. We then built a multivariate fitness function for these
   traits to estimate selection generated by pollinators and seed
   predators. Blossoms with larger bracts were visited by bees more
   frequently and received more pollen on their stigmas. Seed predators
   laid more eggs on blossoms with larger bracts and also on blossoms later
   producing more seeds. Consequently, selection for larger bract size
   exerted by pollinators was counteracted by the selection exerted by seed
   predators. As a result, net selection on bract size tended to be
   stabilizing. Additionally, we found selection on traits that increased
   the rate of self-pollination (assuming uniform seed quality). These

Abstract = {{Foraging bumblebees focus mainly on one flower species (their `major'),
   and occasionally visit other flowers ('minors') that are less rewarding.
   Minoring allows tracking of potential alternative resources that might
   become more profitable with time. This is expected to provide an
   adaptive benefit under unstable foraging conditions, but to reduce
   foraging efficiency when resources are steady. We tested how
   predictability of food sources affects minoring and foraging success,
   using Bombus terrestris workers that fed on sucrose solution in
   artificial flowers. Bees exposed to three colour-distinct flower types
   with fluctuating food rewards performed more minoring (visits to a
   fourth, nonrewarding flower type) than bees that encountered a stable
   reward schedule. This difference was mostly due to a higher frequency of
   flower type shifts in the fluctuating-reward treatment. Flowers of the
   highest-rewarding type were visited less frequently in the
   fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward treatment. This suggests
   that the fluctuating-reward schedule limited the bees' ability to track
   the most profitable flower type. Intervals between successive visits
   were longer in the fluctuating-reward than in the stable-reward
   treatment, possibly because the fluctuating schedule required
   time-consuming neural processing. As expected, the number of minoring
   visits correlated negatively with the number of colour shifts and with
   foraging success in the stable-reward treatment. In the
   fluctuating-reward treatment, on the other hand, sucrose intake rates
   were independent of minoring and colour shift frequencies. We suggest
   that novelty seeking by foragers can evolve when food sources offer
   fluctuating rewards, which reduce foraging success but also the cost of
   exploring new resources. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{The impacts of exotic plants on the pollination and reproductive success
   of natives have been widely reported; however, in spite of its
   importance for the invasive process, the role of native plants in the
   pollination and reproduction of exotic plants has been less explored. To
   fill this gap, we compared the patterns of pollination and reproductive
   success in the invasive herb Echium vulgare (Boraginaceae) between
   monospecific patches (only E. vulgare) and mixed patches (sympatry with
   native herbs Schizanthus hookeri and Stachys albicaulis) in central
   Chile. Using sample quadrats of 1 m x 2 m, we quantified the richness,
   diversity and visitation rate of flower visitors in 15-min observation
   intervals. We conducted an assay to assess the effect of the patch types
   (monospecific and mixed) and the isolation of flowers to visitors on
   both the fruit set and seed/ovule ratio. We showed that native plants
   favoured the richness of visitors of E. vulgare; however, they did not
   lead to increases in visitation rate. The reproductive success of E.
   vulgare did not show differences between contrasted patches; however,
   the isolation of visitors decreased the fruit set, although seed
   production was maintained in the absence of pollinators, presumably by
   an autogamous mechanism. Complementary to our main research focus, we
   assessed changes in pollination variables and reproductive output in two
   coflowering native plants that occur with E. vulgare, S. hookeri and S.
   albicaulis. Despite the fact that our correlational study did not allow
   us to dissect the effects of mixed patches and relative plant abundances
   on variables measured for natives, we observed an increase in pollinator
   richness in mixed patches for the two plants studied. These results
   suggest a potential facilitation for visitor richness of the exotic
   plant in coexistence with native plants, although this facilitation does
   not result in changes in the visit rate or on the reproductive success
   of any of the studied species. This work underlines the need for
   additional research on community levels that assess reciprocal effects
   on pollination between coflowering natives and exotics.}},

Abstract = {{The way in which flower visitors share floral resources or compete for

   species and tested whether such patterns depend on: (1) the body size of
   the species, (2) the daily patterns of variation in weather and nectar
   standing crop, and (3) the effects of weather on the daily rhythm of
   variation in nectar standing crop. After 1 year of biweekly samplings,
   we encountered 56 bee species visiting basil flowers. Larger bee species
   were more active in the cooler and more humid hours of the morning.
   Smaller species foraged later, during the warmer and drier hours.
   Throughout the day, nectar volume decreased. In the laboratory, we
   determined a positive effect of increase in temperature on nectar
   volume, unlike the negative correlation recorded in the field. Nectar
   volume decreased in plants under experimental drought, showing
   similarity with the driest hours of the day. The daily cycle of
   temperature is the fundamental factor that, directly and indirectly, via
   air humidity, soil moisture, and nectar supply, influences bee activity

   positive effect of increasing temperatures on nectar volume is masked by
   a stronger, negative effect of decreasing air humidity and soil moisture

Abstract = {{Plant species and their pollinators are linked by their mutualistic
   interactions, which form the basis of pollination networks. The use of a
   network approach allows one to take into account all interactions
   between a group of plants and its animal pollinators, and to reveal the
   structure of these connections. We analysed pollination interactions for
   urban habitat fragments located within the Warsaw city environment. We
   compared two similar, ruderal communities (phytosociological order
   Onopordetalia acanthii) located in distant parts of the city of Warsaw
   (Poland) that differed with the surrounding ecosystems. The aim of this
   study was to define the structures and properties of flower-visitor
   (visitation) and pollen transport networks (based on analysis of pollen
   loads carried by insects) and to assess the differences between the
   studied sites. Although the sites differed in insect relative abundance
   (Diptera dominated one study site, whereas Hymenoptera dominated the
   other), network size and structure were similar for both communities. In
   both cases, networks contained moderately specialized species (based on
   H (2)' index); however, networks were dominated by apparently
   ecologically generalized insect taxa as well as those represented by a
   single specimen. Networks based on pollen transport indicated greater
   generality of insect species (more links) than those based on our
   samples of visitation. The most highly linked plant species represented
   were either the most abundant (Fabaceae) or phenotypically generalized
   taxa (Daucus carota). We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions in
   such highly disturbed and isolated habitats are composed mostly of
   ecologically generalised species. Moreover, we stress the usefulness of
   pollen load analysis in the development and verification of visitation

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators are becoming more valuable to global agriculture as the

   other stressors. Perennial tree crops are particularly reliant on insect
   pollination, and are often pollen limited. Research on how different
   tree crop production systems influence the richness and abundance of
   wild pollinators is, however, limited. We investigated, for the first
   time, the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators in
   commercial temperate almond orchards in Australia, and compared them to
   potential pollinator communities in proximate native vegetation. We
   quantified ground cover variables at each site and assessed the value of
   ground cover on the richness and abundance of potential wild pollinators
   in commercial almond systems focussing on three common taxa: bees, wasps
   and flies. More insects were caught in orchards with living ground cover
   than in native vegetation or orchards without ground cover, although
   overall species richness was highest in native vegetation. Percent
   ground cover was positively associated with wasp richness and abundance,
   and native bee richness, but flies showed no association with ground
   cover. The strongest positive relationship was between native bee
   abundance and the richness of ground cover plants. Our results suggest
   that maintaining living ground cover within commercial almond orchards

Abstract = {{Retention of habitat fragments within the urban matrix can provide
   critical resources for the maintenance of regional biodiversity while
   still providing socio-economic value. Euglossini bees are important
   components in a community as they are important pollinators for
   economically valuable plants as well as hundreds of orchid species.
   However, some species are very sensitive to environmental impacts like
   urbanization. This study presents the role of antique urban fragments in
   a historical city in Brazil and compares it with a conservation area on
   the aspects of orchid bee assemblage, such as richness, composition, and
   abundance. Four fragments inside the city of Ouro Preto and three inside
   Parque Estadual do Itacolomi (PEIT) were sampled for Euglossini bees.
   Sorensen similarity index was used to compare community composition. The
   Mantel test was applied to verify the hypothesis that an urban center is
   a barrier for the mobility of the individuals. Fourteen Euglossini
   species from the region were registered. Close to 75\% of the sampled
   bees were collected from the PEIT sampling areas. The fragments
   presented differences in Euglossini richness and abundance. A majority
   of the sampled fragments were dominated by the Eulaema cingulata
   Fabricius, Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, and Euglossa securigera Dressler
   species. We found differences on community composition between the
   fragments localized in PEIT and those located in the urban center. The
   data suggest that there is a possible flux of individuals between the

Abstract = {{To preserve biodiversity and ecosystem functions in a globally changing
   world it is crucial to understand the effect of land use on ecosystem
   processes such as pollination. Floral colouration is known to be central
   in plant-pollinator interactions. To date, it is still unknown whether
   land use affects the colouration of flowering plant communities. To
   assess the effect of land use on the diversity and composition of flower
   colours in temperate grasslands, we collected data on the number of
   flowering plant species, blossom cover and flower reflectance spectra
   from 69 plant communities in two German regions, Schwabische Alb (SA)
   and Hainich-Dun (HD). We analysed reflectance data of flower colours as
   they are perceived by honeybees and studied floral colour diversity
   based upon spectral loci of each flowering plant species in the Maxwell
   triangle. Before the first mowing, flower colour diversity decreased
   with increasing land-use intensity in SA, accompanied by a shift of mean
   flower colours of communities towards an increasing proportion of white
   blossom cover in both regions. By changing colour characteristics of
   grasslands, we suggest that increasing land-use intensity can affect the
   flower visitor fauna in terms of visitor behaviour and diversity. These
   changes may in turn influence plant reproduction in grassland plant
   communities. Our results indicate that land use is likely to affect
   communication processes between plants and flower visitors by altering
   flower colour traits.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a flower color polymorphism in Iris lutescens, a species
   widespread in the Northern part of the Mediterranean basin. We studied
   the biochemical basis of the difference between purple and yellow
   flowers, and explored the ecological and evolutionary consequences of
   such difference, in particular visual discrimination by insects, a
   potential link with scent emitted and the association between color and
   scent. Anthocyanins were found to be present in much greater
   concentrations in purple flowers than in yellow ones, but the
   anthocyanin composition did not differ between color morphs. Likewise,
   no quantitative difference in anthocyanin content was found between
   vegetative tissues of the two morphs. Floral anthocyanins were dominated
   by delphinidin 3-O-(p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside (also called
   delphanin) and its aliphatic derivatives. Small amounts of delphinidin
   3-O-(p-caffeoylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside and its aliphatic derivatives
   were also characterized. Based on a description of bumblebees' (one of
   the main pollinators of I. lutescens) color perception, purple and
   yellow flowers of I. lutescens could be visually discriminated as blue
   and blue-green, respectively, and likely by a wide variety of other
   insects. The overall chemical composition of the scent produced was not
   significantly different between morphs, being dominated by terpenoids,
   mainly myrcene, (E)-beta-ocimene and limonene. A slight color-scent
   correlation was nevertheless detected, consistent with the shared
   biosynthetic origin of both pigments and volatile compounds. Therefore
   in this species, the difference in the amounts of pigments responsible
   for flower color difference seems to be the major difference between the
   two morphs. Pollinators are probably the main selective agent driving
   the evolution of flower color polymorphism in I. lutescens, which
   represents a suitable species for investigating how such polymorphism is
   maintained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   populations during three consecutive years. The flowers were visited by
   a diverse array of insects, totalling 24 different species. However,
   only four species were effective pollinators, depositing pollen on
   stigmas after one visit, while the remaining species behaved as nectar
   robbers, secondary nectar robbers or nectar thieves and were completely
   ineffective for pollination. Among the effective pollinators, two groups
   with distinct foraging behaviours were observed: the nectar collecting
   long-tongued bees Bombus pascuorum and Anthophora sp. and the pollen
   collectors Eucera longicornis and Halictus sp. No significant
   differences were observed among pollinators in their efficiency in
   pollen deposition on stigmas, but significant differences were observed
   in the foraging behaviour between nectarivorous and pollen collectors.
   Variation in the abundance and assemblage of floral visitors was
   observed at the temporal scale and among populations, with the effective

Abstract = {{Sown wildflower strips have been used to mitigate against the loss of

   this four-year field experiment, conducted on six field parcels, the
   ability of wildflower strips to simultaneously promote the availability
   of pollination services (using bumblebee abundance as a proxy), species
   diversity (total species richness of bumblebees, butterflies and diurnal
   moths) and conservation (abundance of habitat specialist butterflies)
   was evaluated. The results showed that the first two indicators

   independent of experimentally varied strip properties. It is concluded
   that wildflower strips are a flexible mitigation tool to promote
   different biodiversity targets in agricultural systems. Pollination
   services and species diversity can be promoted in different kinds of

   to the loss of natural habitats and reduction of plant diversity
   resulting from agricultural intensification. To mitigate the negative
   effects of agricultural intensification, agri-environmental schemes
   (AES) have been proposed to sustain bees and others pollinators in
   agrosystems. AES include the preservation of semi-natural habitats such
   as grasslands, fallows, woodlots, hedgerows or set-aside field margins.
   However, empirical evidence suggest that the use of those semi-natural
   habitats by bees may vary greatly among bee functional groups and may
   further be influenced by the presence of alternative foraging habitats
   such as mass-flowering crops. The present study sets out to investigate
   whether the three bee groups typically targeted by AES (honey bees,
   bumble bees and other wild bees) differ in the way they use those
   semi-natural habitats relative to common mass-flowering crops (oilseed
   rape, sunflower, alfalfa) in an intensive agricultural farming system. A
   clear segregation pattern in the use of floral resources appeared
   between honey bees and wild bees, with the former being tightly
   associated with mass-flowering crops and the latter with semi-natural
   habitats. Bumble bees had an intermediate strategy and behaved as
   habitat generalists. Therefore, it would be sensible to treat the three
   bee groups with distinct AES management strategies, and to further
   consider potential effects on AES efficiency of alternative foraging
   habitats in the surrounding. This study also stresses the importance of
   native floral resources, particularly in semi-natural herbaceous
   habitats, for sustaining wild bee populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Bees foraging for nectar often have to discriminate between flowers with
   similar appearance but different nectar rewards. At the same time, they
   must be vigilant for ambush predators, such as crab spiders, which can
   camouflage themselves on flowers. We investigated whether bees, Bombus
   terrestris, can efficiently discriminate similar flower colours while
   exposed to predation threat from cryptic predators. Bees were
   individually tested in tightly controlled laboratory experiments using
   artificial flowers whose nectar supply was administered with precision
   pumps. Predation risk was simulated by automated crab spider `robots'
   that captured bees for a limited duration without injuring them. Bees'
   behaviour was monitored by a 3D video tracking system. We experimented
   with both cryptic and conspicuous spiders, finding that bees had no
   difficulty avoiding conspicuous spiders while still foraging adaptively.
   Conversely, they prioritized predator avoidance at the expense of
   maximizing energy intake when faced with detecting cryptic predators and
   a difficult colour discrimination task. This difference in behaviour was
   not due to cognitive limitations: bees were able to discriminate between
   similar flower types under predation risk from cryptic spiders when
   choosing the safe flower type incurred a gustatory punishment in the
   form of bitter quinine solution. However, this resulted in bees
   incurring substantially higher costs in terms of floral inspection
   times. We conclude that bees have the capacity to attend to difficult
   foraging tasks while simultaneously avoiding cryptic predators, but only
   do so when avoidance of gustatory punishment justifies the increased
   costs. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Visual and olfactory cues are the first interface between flowers and
   their visitors and are adaptations to facilitate successful pollination.
   Initial responses to and associative learning of multimodal cues by
   flower visitors are based on the perception of colours and volatiles. In
   this study, we tested how visual, olfactory and multimodal stimuli
   affect the behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and correlated
   the properties of 28 stimuli in relation to the insects' sensory
   equipment to these behaviours. Initial responses and associative
   learning were recorded using a radio frequency identification system,
   tracking the visitation sequences of individual bumblebees to artificial
   flowers treated with naturally occurring pigments and/or volatiles. The
   salience of the stimuli was evaluated as the colour contrast to the
   background and as electroantennogram responses. The main finding was
   that both initial responses and learning performance were positively
   correlated to the salience of the stimuli, suggesting that salience is a
   key feature of flower cues in the interactions with insects. The
   salience of compound stimuli consisting of two or more pigments and/or
   volatiles was largely additively determined by the saliences of
   individual compounds. Potentially, the valence of the stimuli may
   interfere with the positive relationship between salience and behaviour,
   which is indicated by our results, too. The salience of multimodal cues
   depends on the species-specific equipment of visual and olfactory
   receptors and thus enables flowers to be advertising for some but rather
   inconspicuous for other flower visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plants may decrease native plant density and disrupt
   interactions between native plants and their pollinators. We
   hypothesized that invasive Solidago canadensis (Asteraceae) competes for
   pollination services with two confamilial species, Ixeris chinensis and
   Sonchus arvensis. Breeding-system studies revealed that both native
   species are self-incompatible. In plots with all three species we found
   that Solidago received the highest visitation rates. To test the
   hypothesis of competition for pollination in the context of reduced
   native density, we established 3 plots for both native species with
   three Solidago densities (uninvaded, 50 and 75 \% invaded) and
   corresponding decreases in native density. We investigated the effects
   of varying densities of Solidago on honeybee visitation rates, number of
   successive visits within individual ramets, pollen-load composition on
   bees, and seed set. For both native species, increasing Solidago density
   and decreasing native density resulted in bees carrying higher ratios of
   Solidago pollen and in bees visiting fewer capitula prior to departing
   from a plant. However, for other aspects of pollination, the native
   species responded very differently to Solidago. With increasing Solidago
   and decreasing native density, Ixeris received fewer honeybee visits and
   produced fewer seeds, demonstrating competition for pollination, but
   Sonchus attracted more honeybee visits and showed a non-significant
   trend toward setting more seeds, suggesting facilitation. These opposing
   effects occurred despite similarities in the native species' floral
   morphology, suggesting that the effects of invasive plants are difficult
   to predict. In this case the different effects may relate to Sonchus
   being a taller plant with larger flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming accelerates the timing of flowering and insect
   pollinator emergence, especially in spring. If these phenological shifts
   progress independently between species, features of plant-pollinator
   mutualisms may be modified. However, evidence of phenological mismatch
   in pollination systems is limited. We investigated the phenologies of a
   spring ephemeral, Corydalis ambigua, and its pollinators (bumble bees),
   and seed-set success over 10-14 years in three populations. Although
   both flowering onset and first detection of overwintered queen bees in
   the C. ambigua populations were closely related to snowmelt time and/or
   spring temperature, flowering tended to be ahead of first pollinator
   detection when spring came early, resulting in lower seed production
   owing to low pollination service. Relationships between flowering onset
   time, phenological mismatch, and seed-set success strongly suggest that
   phenological mismatch is a major limiting factor for reproduction of
   spring ephemerals. This report demonstrates the mechanism of
   phenological mismatch and its ecological impact on plant-pollinator
   interactions based on long-term monitoring. Frequent occurrence of
   mismatch can decrease seed production and may affect the population

Abstract = {{Research quantifying ecosystem services (ES) - collectively, the
   benefits that society obtains from ecosystems -is rapidly increasing.
   Despite the seemingly straightforward definition, a wide variety of
   methods are used to measure ES. This methodological variability has
   largely been ignored, and standard protocols to select measures that
   capture ES provision have yet to be established. Furthermore, most
   published papers do not include explicit definitions of individual ES.
   We surveyed the literature on pollination ES to assess the range of
   measurement approaches, focusing on three essential steps: (1)
   definition of the ES, (2) identification of components contributing to
   ES delivery, and (3) selection of metrics to represent these components.
   We found considerable variation in how pollination as an ES - a
   relatively well-defined service - is measured. We discuss potential
   causes of this variability and provide suggestions to address this
   issue. Consistency in ES measurement, or a clear explanation of selected
   definitions and metrics, is critical to facilitate comparisons among

Abstract = {{Over a million commercially produced bumblebee colonies are imported
   annually on a global scale for the pollination of greenhouse crops.
   After importation, they interact with other pollinators, with an
   associated risk of any parasites they carry infecting and harming native
   bees. National and supranational regulations are designed to prevent
   this, and commercially produced bumblebee colonies are accordingly now
   often sold and imported as being parasite-free. Here, we used molecular
   methods to examine the occurrence of parasites in bumblebee colonies
   that were commercially produced in 2011 and 2012 by three producers. We
   then used controlled experiments to determine whether any parasites
   present were infectious. We found that 77\% of the commercially produced
   bumblebee colonies from the three producers, which were imported on the
   basis of being free of parasites, in fact carried microbial parasites,
   with five different parasites being detected across the total sample of
   bumblebees and a further three in the pollen supplied with the colonies
   as food. Our controlled experiments demonstrated that at least three of
   these parasites were infectious to bumblebees with significant negative
   effects on their health. Furthermore, we also found that at least four
   of the parasites carried by commercially produced bumblebees were
   infectious to honeybees, indicating that they pose a risk to other
   pollinators as well.Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate
   that commercially produced bumblebee colonies carry multiple, infectious
   parasites that pose a significant risk to other native and managed
   pollinators. More effective disease detection and management strategies

Abstract = {{In the western United States, up to 90\% of quaking aspen (Populus
   tremuloides Michx.) is estimated to have disappeared since European
   settlement due to human activities. This loss poses a significant threat
   to many forms of biodiversity associated with aspen, including plants,
   birds, and mammals. However, no work has investigated native bee
   diversity associated with aspen. Our objectives were to: (1) describe
   the diversity, taxonomic composition, and sex ratios of bees in aspen
   stands in native bunchgrass prairie of northeastern Oregon, (2) compare
   bee communities in aspen with those in an adjacent grassland, and (3)
   document differences in floral resources associated with each habitat.
   We sampled native bees and quantified blooming non-anemophilous plant
   richness in four aspen stands and four locations in bunchgrass prairie
   three times during the summer. Bee abundance increased in both habitats
   as the summer progressed. Although taxa richness and overall abundance
   of bees did not differ significantly between habitats, community
   composition did. Bumble bees (Bombus) were more abundant in aspen
   stands, while sweat bees (Lasioglossum and Halictus) were more abundant
   in grassland locations. Four species of bumble bees were significantly
   associated with aspen stands and sex ratios of bumble bees were
   significantly more male-biased in aspen stands compared to grassland
   locations. Floral resources are one potential driver of observed
   differences between habitats. In late summer, aspen stands had higher
   blooming plant richness, as well as a distinctive floral community. This
   study suggests that conserving aspen benefits not only many plants and
   vertebrates, but also ecologically significant invertebrates, such as
   native bees.}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of low input farming on biodiversity and ecosystem services
   are already well-established, however most of these studies focus only
   on the focal field scales. We aimed to study whether these benefits
   exist at the whole farm scale, to find the main environmental driving
   effects on biodiversity at the whole farm scale in farms of different
   grassland grazing intensity, applying three well-known species diversity
   indicator groups of different ecological traits.
   Edaphic (earthworms), epigeic (spiders) and flying (bees) taxa were
   sampled in each identified habitat type within 18 low-input farms in
   Central Hungary, 2010. The number of habitat types, the number of
   grassland plots, the cumulative area of grasslands and habitat type had
   an effect on the species richness and abundance of spiders, while
   grassland grazing intensity influenced the species richness of bees.
   Both bees and spiders were sensitive to vegetation and weather
   conditions, resulting in more bees on flower-rich farms and those having
   higher temperature; and more spiders on farms with more heterogeneous
   vegetation structure and in low-wind areas. Relatively few earthworms
   were found in the whole study, and their abundance was not influenced by
   any of the farm composition and management variables.
   We conclude that local field management (grazing intensity of grassland
   patches) can have a farm scale effect, detectable on species diversity
   indicators that have high dispersal ability and strong connection to
   grasslands as important foraging sites (bees). However, other farmland
   biota (spiders) is also strongly determined by farmland composition and
   habitat diversity, therefore the maintenance of a mosaic within-farm
   habitat structure is strongly recommended. The application of earthworms
   as farmland composition or management indicators is strongly restricted
   because of their special needs of soil conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Weber's Law, the Magnitude Effect and Discrimination of Sugar
   Concentrations in Nectar-Feeding Animals}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{Weber's law quantifies the perception of difference between stimuli. For
   instance, it can explain why we are less likely to detect the removal of
   three nuts from a bowl if the bowl is full than if it is nearly empty.
   This is an example of the magnitude effect - the phenomenon that the
   subjective perception of a linear difference between a pair of stimuli
   progressively diminishes when the average magnitude of the stimuli
   increases. Although discrimination performances of both human and animal
   subjects in various sensory modalities exhibit the magnitude effect,
   results sometimes systematically deviate from the quantitative
   predictions based on Weber's law. An attempt to reformulate the law to
   better fit data from acoustic discrimination tasks has been dubbed the
   ``near-miss to Weber's law{''}. Here, we tested the gustatory
   discrimination performance of nectar-feeding bats (Glossophaga
   soricina), in order to investigate whether the original version of
   Weber's law accurately predicts choice behavior in a two-alternative
   forced choice task. As expected, bats either preferred the sweeter of
   the two options or showed no preference. In 4 out of 6 bats the
   near-miss to Weber's law provided a better fit and Weber's law
   underestimated the magnitude effect. In order to test the generality of
   this observation in nectar-feeders, we reviewed previously published
   data on bats, hummingbirds, honeybees, and bumblebees. In all groups of
   animals the near-miss to Weber's law provided better fits than Weber's
   law. Furthermore, whereas the magnitude effect was stronger than
   predicted by Weber's law in vertebrates, it was weaker than predicted in
   insects. Thus nectar-feeding vertebrates and insects seem to differ in
   how their choice behavior changes as sugar concentration is increased.
   We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of the observed
   patterns of sugar concentration discrimination.}},

Title = {{Context-dependency of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant-insect
   interactions in an agroecosystem}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{SEP 5}},
Abstract = {{Plants interact with a variety of other community members that have the
   potential to indirectly influence each other through a shared host
   plant. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are generally considered plant
   mutualists because of their generally positive effects on plant nutrient
   status and growth. AMF may also have important indirect effects on
   plants by altering interactions with other community members. By
   influencing plant traits, AMF can modify aboveground interactions with
   both mutualists, such as pollinators, and antagonists, such as
   herbivores. Because herbivory and pollination can dramatically influence
   plant fitness, comprehensive assessment of plant-AMF interactions should
   include these indirect effects. To determine how AMF affect plant insect
   interactions, we grew Cucumis sativus (Cucurbitaceae) under five AMF
   inoculum treatments and control. We measured plant growth, floral
   production, flower size, and foliar nutrient content of half the plants,
   and transferred the other half to a field setting to measure pollinator
   and herbivore preference of wild insects. Mycorrhizal treatment had no
   effect on plant biomass or floral traits but significantly affected leaf
   nutrients, pollinator behavior, and herbivore attack. Although total
   pollinator visitation did not vary with AMF treatment, pollinators
   exhibited taxon-specific responses, with honey bees, bumble bees, and
   Lepidoptera all responding differently to AMF treatments. Flower number
   and size were unaffected by treatments, suggesting that differences in
   pollinator preference were driven by other floral traits. Mycorrhizae
   influenced leaf K and Na, but these differences in leaf nutrients did
   not correspond to variation in herbivore attack. Overall, we found that
   AMF indirectly influence both antagonistic and mutualistic insects, but
   impacts depend on the identity of both the fungal partner and the
   interacting insect, underscoring the context-dependency of plant-AMF
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{(The pollination biology of Pseudostifftia kingii H.Rob. (Asteraceae), a
   rare endemic Brazilian species with uniflorous capitula). P. kingii is a
   monotypic genus within the Asteraceae family that grows under extreme
   environmental conditions and possesses an unusual single-flowered
   capitulum. It is endemic to Chapada Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil, a region
   dominated by a mosaic of rocky, sandy flats and bogs in the upper
   elevational zone (above 900-1,000 m). To gain a better understanding of
   the pollination biology of P. kingii, we examined its floral
   development, floral rewards, reproductive strategies, and floral
   visitors. The flowers exhibit asynchronous diurnal anthesis with three
   distinct floral stages, each differing with regard to male-female
   maturation and nectar availability; these floral stages appear to
   influence the activity of the flower visitors. Although several floral
   characteristics of P. kingii suggest that it is an entomophilous
   species, observations revealed it as a generalist species for which
   hummingbirds and bees are the main floral visitors, differing slightly
   in the diurnal period of their visits. P. kingii can reproduce through
   xenogamy, geitonogamy, and what appears to be allogamy, but with
   different sizes of fruits (achenes) produced depending on the
   reproductive strategy employed. This study revealed some important
   features of pollination and floral biology within Asteraceae and
   provides clues for pollen dispersion in a harsh environment.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we used niche overlap analysis and a network
   approach to investigate the use of floral resources by carpenter bees

   Among the 48 interactions that were theoretically possible in the
   interaction network, only 19 were recorded (Connectance = 39.58\%). The
   temporal overlap between pairs of species measured by the Shannon index
   (0 to 0.648) was lower than dietary overlap (0 to 0.967). The network

   the temporal dimension (E = 0.72, P < 0.001) than in the dietary
   dimension (E = 0.55, P < 0.001). The levels of dietary and temporal

   highest frequency of visit coincided with the time of availability of
   resources by the most important plants (Moringa oleifera, Passiflora

   differentiate the structures of the flower-visitor network with the
   `true' plant-pollinator network. The robustness of the flower-visitor
   network to animal loss was generally high, but it declined when only
   true pollinators were included in the network. The sequential loss of
   plants from the flower-visitor network resulted in low robustness: the
   loss of key plants could have significant cascading effects on the

Abstract = {{The two cerrado palms Butia paraguayensis and Syagrus petraea were
   studied with regard to parasitizing and pollinating insects that visit
   their reproductive organs. At the study site in Botucatu, Sao Paulo
   State, both species occurred together, while at the study site in
   Indianopolis, Minas Gerais state, only S. petraea was growing. Bees of
   the subfamily Meliponinae and Halictinae were the main pollinators of B.
   paraguayensis and several beetles and flies were additional pollinators.
   The visiting beetles divided up in more exclusive parasites, such as the
   weevils Tripusus leiospathae and Petalochilus lineolatus, and the
   Colydiidae Bitoma palmarum, which bored and oviposited the closed spathe
   and whose larvae fed on the flower buds, as well as species of the
   weevil Microstrates, which bred in staminate flowers. Differently, the
   curculionids Anchylorhynchus bicolor, Parisoschoenus sp., Dialomia sp.,
   and species of Mystrops (Nitidulididae) behaved as parasites and
   pollinators. On the other hand, S. petraea shows more evident
   adaptations for pollination by beetles. This species has Trigona
   spinipes as prominent bee pollinator, but otherwise beetles dominated as
   visitors, being them either parasites, pollinators or both. Although
   several identical beetle genera occur on both palms, at the species
   level they are different, as for example Anchylorhynchus camposi on S.
   petraea. At the two distant study sites of S. petraea in Botucatu and
   Indianopolis, several species, especially of the parasitic insects, are
   identical, indicating that parasitism is a stronger bond than
   pollination in this species which is characterized by a generalist
   pollination mode.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to assess the efficiency of Centris aenea Lepeletier as

   females, 2) the rate of M. emarginata fruit set after a single visit,
   and 3) the pollen deposition rate on the stigma after one single visit.
   We found that 59\% of the pollen grains deposited on the ventral region
   of C. aenea came from flowers of M. emarginata. The fruit set after a
   single visit by C. aenea (21\%) was higher than that reported previously
   for Centris tarsata Smith. We argue that pollination efficiency of C.
   aenea can be related to its body size, since that females of C. aenea
   can carry out larger amounts of pollen grains of M. emarginata than C.
   tarsata, as well females of C. aenea are able to touch a larger stigma

Abstract = {{The Malpighiaceae family is species-rich and is abundant in Brazil.
   Malpighiaceae flowers provide oil and pollen to pollinating bees and
   serve as food for herbivorous insects, which damage the floral

   studied. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of florivory in
   one of the most common genera of Malpighiaceae in the Cerrado
   (Banisteriopsis) and the impact of florivory on fruiting. The florivory
   rate was quantified in flowers of B. malifolia belonging to two
   morphotypes and in flowers of B. variabilis. Additionally, a
   petal-removal experiment was performed, which simulated the presence of
   damage in the flowers. The manipulation involved a control group with
   intact flowers, a group without the standard petal and a group of
   flowers without common petals. The florivory in the petals (floral area
   lost) differed between the species, and B. malifolia was the most
   damaged. The experimental manipulation revealed that intact flowers had
   a higher fruiting rate compared with the remaining flowers. These
   results reinforce the concept that florivory renders flowers less
   attractive to pollinating bees, which negatively affects the fruiting
   rate and the reproductive success of plants. We suggest that basic
   studies (such as the present investigation) be extended to further
   elucidate the effect of interactions between pollinators, plants, and

Abstract = {{Bees (Hymenoptera) and flies (Diptera) play an essential role in natural
   and agricultural ecosystems as pollinators of flowering plants while
   pollinators are declining around the world. Colored pan traps and
   Malaise traps have widely been used for monitoring pollinators. However,
   their efficiencies may vary with landscapes and type of fauna in a
   particular habitat. A yearlong study was carried out during 2009 to
   investigate the relative efficacy of colored pan traps and Malaise traps
   towards sampling flies and bees for the first time in a sub-tropical
   wildlife sanctuary `Pirowal' of Southern Punjab, Pakistan. Fifteen pan
   traps (5 each of 3 colors i.e. white, red and blue) were deployed
   against one Malaise trap for 7 hours (9:00-16:00 hrs) on fortnightly
   basis. For the comparison and confirmation of an insect as a floral
   visitor, collection with the hand net was also performed. It was
   concluded that hand net collection is essential to have a comprehensive
   list of floral visitors of an area as the maximum number (63) of species
   and their abundance (5428 individuals) were recorded with it. Malaise
   trap collected only 671 individuals of 48 species. Although blue, yellow
   and white pan traps caught 46, 51 and 35 species but the numbers of
   individuals (1383) were fairly higher than that of Malaise traps.
   Keeping in view the cost effectiveness and better performance of colored
   pan traps, we recommend species specific pan trap colors when targeting
   certain groups or species, nevertheless variety of pan colors should be
   used when sampling overall biodiversity. We generalize these findings
   for both bees and flies due to similar collection pattern i.e. the
   maximum abundance and diversity in hand net method followed by pan traps
   and Malaise traps.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific variation in plants is driven by both genetic and
   environmental factors and has been shown to play an important role in
   determining assemblages of herbivores, predators, and pathogens. Yet,
   the consequences of genetic (G) and environmental (E) factors, as well
   as potential (G X E) interactions, for floral visitor communities
   remains poorly explored. In a common garden experiment, we compared the
   relative effects of host-plant genotype and genotypic diversity as well
   as soil nutrient enrichment on floral resource abundance and insect
   floral visitors associated with tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We
   found that the floral visitor community varied considerably among
   genotypes, driven predominantly by variation in floral phenology among
   S. altissima clones. Floral visitors also varied among nutrient
   treatments, though this response was much weaker than to different plant
   genotypes, and was likely driven by effects of floral rewards rather
   than of floral phenology. Importantly, we also detected several G X E
   interactions for both flowering and floral visitors. Taken together, our
   results suggest that the effects of host-plant genetic variation, and to
   a lesser extent G X E interactions, are key agents in structuring the
   diversity and composition of floral visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on nesting ecology have proven to be extremely important for
   stingless bees conservation. This kind of study is scarce in urban
   landscapes. Our study aimed to analyze the abundance, density,
   diversity, spatial distribution and nesting habits of species belonging
   to the Meliponina subtribe in an urban area of the Uberlandia
   municipality, Minas Gerais state. We checked potential nesting sites by
   searching for nests from October 2009 until April 2010. We collected six
   worker bees from each detected nest to identify species, and estimated
   diversity and analyzed the spatial distribution pattern of the nests
   using the Shannon-Wiener and Nearest Neighbor index, respectively. We
   found fifty nests belonging to seven species, with Nannotrigona
   testaceicornis being the most abundant species (44\%). The density of
   nests was 2.17 nests/ha, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was H'=1.58
   and the clumped distribution was the detected dispersal pattern. The
   height of the nests in relation to the ground varied from 0 to 12 m:
   Trigona spinipes had the highest nests and the highest variation for
   this parameter. Hollow trees were the preferred substrate occupied by
   the observed bees species (70\%): Caesalpinia peltophoroides was the
   preferred plant species for nesting. Our results suggested that urban
   landscapes can sustain a high diversity of stingless bees, and
   maintaining trees species and urban forestry projects are important
   tools for the conservation of this group of animals. This type of study
   provides relevant information to the development of management and
   conservation plans for Meliponina species.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is important for many ecosystem processes. Global declines
   in pollinator diversity and abundance have been recognized, raising
   concerns about a pollination crisis of crops and wild plants. However,
   experimental evidence for effects of pollinator species diversity on
   plant reproduction is extremely scarce. We established communities with
   1-5 bee species to test how seed production of a plant community is
   determined by bee diversity. Higher bee diversity resulted in higher
   seed production, but the strongest difference was observed for one
   compared to more than one bee species. Functional complementarity among
   bee species had a far higher explanatory power than bee diversity,
   suggesting that additional bee species only benefit pollination when
   they increase coverage of functional niches. In our experiment,
   complementarity was driven by differences in flower and temperature
   preferences. Interspecific interactions among bee species contributed to
   realized functional complementarity, as bees reduced interspecific
   overlap by shifting to alternative flowers in the presence of other
   species. This increased the number of plant species visited by a bee
   community and demonstrates a new mechanism for a biodiversity-function
   relationship (interactive complementarity). In conclusion, our results
   highlight both the importance of bee functional diversity for the

Abstract = {{Bumblebees of Bombus terrestris are essential pollinators in natural and

   morphology, task allocation within the colony, and external factors,

   bumblebees can sometimes be impaired, especially in the artificial and
   weak light intensities of greenhouses at high altitudes. Here we
   investigated whether the eagerness (or willingness) to forage of
   bumblebee colonies in different light conditions is correlated with the
   light sensitivity of bumblebees colonies and/or different external
   morphological parameters. The initial foraging capacity of bumblebee
   colonies correlated with their light sensitivity. However, light
   sensitive bumblebee colonies did not necessarily had a higher foraging
   activity at lower light intensities. Differences in initial foraging
   capacity and light sensitivity among colonies could not be explained by
   the external morphological parameters. In conclusion, our data
   illustrated that the recruitment to forage in artificial low light is
   less impaired in light sensitive colonies, and that not only the
   external morphology parameters determine the light sensitivity of
   bumblebees and their eagerness to forage in weak light conditions. The

Abstract = {{Tribe Condamineeae appears to be well supported in recent phylogenetic

   leading to restoration of Schizocalyx. We studied the reproductive
   biology of one species from each clade, which occur sympatrically in the
   montane Brazilian Atlantic forest. Flowering overlap was short (from
   December to March in B. australis and from February to June in S.
   cuspidatus). The flowers of both species are protogynous and homostylous
   and last for about 3 days. The unit of pollination in B. australis is
   the inflorescence. Its flowers have a greenish hypocrateriform corolla
   (tube about 5mm long) and were mainly pollinated by bees and wasps in
   search of nectar. Schizocalyx cuspidatus has white flowers with an
   infundibuliform corolla (tube about 8mm long), and its main pollinators
   were stingless bees in search of pollen. The pollination systems of the
   two species did not correspond to their pollination syndromes.
   Morphological differences between Bathysa and Schizocalyx were reflected
   in their pollination systems, with greater phenotypic specialization in
   S. cuspidatus, the flowers of which offer pollen as the main resource,
   an unusual feature within Rubiaceae. Schizocalyx cuspidatus showed
   higher reproductive capacity by having more inflorescences per plant,
   more ovules per flower, and twice the proportion of flowering
   individuals. However, the reproductive efficiency (fruit set, seed/ovule
   ratio) did not differ between the species, despite the higher frequency
   of visits by pollinators to S. cuspidatus. Self-compatibility in B.
   australis and self-incompatibility in S. cuspidatus seem to explain

Abstract = {{Reproductive biology and plant fertility are directly related to many

   friburgensis is an epiphytic and terrestrial bromeliad endemic to the
   Brazilian Atlantic rainforest. Hand-pollination experiments were used to
   examine the reproductive system in a wild population of V.friburgensis.
   Plant fertility was assigned considering flower production, fruit and
   seed set, seed germination, and pollen viability. Self-sterility
   observed from spontaneous selfing and manual self-pollination treatments
   may be the consequence of late-acting self-incompatibility.
   Hand-pollination results indicated no pollen limitation in the
   population studied. Floral biology features such as a few daily open
   flowers, nectar production, and sugar concentration corroborate
   hummingbirds as effective pollinators, although bees were also
   documented as pollinators. Components of fitness such as high flower,
   fruit, and seed production together with high seed and pollen viability
   indicate that this wild population is viable. From a conservation point
   of view, we highlight that this self-sterile species depends on
   pollinator services to maintain its population fitness and viability
   through cross-pollination. Currently, pollinators are not limited in
   this population of V.friburgensis. Conversely, the maintenance and

   robbers. The number of stigmas within a patch that received pollen dye

   pollen analogs was higher when nectar robbing was not prevented.
   Overall, the proportion of robbed flowers on an inflorescence had a
   neutral effect to a weak positive effect on the reproduction of
   individual plants (i.e. positive association between nectar robbing and
   fruit set in 2002) even when it clearly changed the behavior of its most
   efficient pollinator potentially increasing the frequency of nectar
   robbing within a plant.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are declining in Europe due to intensification of
   agriculture, habitat loss and fragmentation. Restored landfill sites are
   a significant potential reserve of semi-natural habitat, so their
   conservation value for supporting populations of pollinating insects was
   here examined by assessing whether the plant and pollinator assemblages
   of restored landfill sites are comparable to reference sites of existing
   wildlife value. Floral characteristics of the vegetation and the species
   richness and abundance of flower-visiting insect assemblages were
   compared between nine pairs of restored landfill sites and reference
   sites in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, using standardized
   methods over two field seasons. No differences were found between the
   restored landfill and reference sites in terms of species richness or
   abundance of plants in flower and both types of site had similar
   assemblages of pollinators. However, plant and insect assemblages
   differed across the season, with species richness and abundance being
   lower for the restored landfill sites in the spring and higher in the
   autumn compared to the reference sites. The results indicate that in
   this region, landfill sites are being restored to a state comparable to
   that of the reference sites with regards to their provision of floral
   resources and the associated insect pollinator assemblages. Since there
   are currently 2,200 working landfill sites in England and Wales,
   covering 28,000ha, and closing at a rate of 100 per year, this is
   potentially a significant reserve of land that could be restored.}},

Abstract = {{Native bee diversity is poorly documented for many regions of the globe,
   particularly in the Neotropics. The available structured inventories in
   this biogeographical region provide reliable data, but they lack a
   comprehensive interpretation due to the absence of an effort to relate
   diversity and composition data with environmental variables. We aimed to
   answer the following questions: (1) Do abiotic factors explain
   variations in the richness, diversity, and composition of bee
   assemblages? (2) If so, which abiotic factors explain each of these
   community descriptors? We used a database comprising 33 systematic
   surveys of bee assemblages along eastern Neotropics. We found
   significant effect of abiotic variables on biotic diversity parameters
   and assemblage composition. Temperature annual range was the main
   abiotic predictor affecting bee richness and diversity, while
   composition was explained by annual mean temperature, temperature
   seasonality, temperature annual range, and by annual precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering plants in New Zealand have often been described as having
   predominantly small white or pale flowers, possibly due to an absence of
   social insects as a major pollinating force. However, insect vision is
   considerably different to human perception, and these hypotheses need to
   be assessed considering insect perceptual capabilities. We collected
   spectral reflectance data from flowers of 23 native species in an alpine
   region of New Zealand at an altitude above 1500 m where 77\% of flowers
   have been reported to possess small white or pale flowers. Our spectral
   analyses show that these flowers actually have very strong chromatic
   signals for hymenoptera colour vision. Indeed the spectral signals of
   these flowers most frequently have inflection points at about 400 and
   500 nm, which closely match the region of best spectral discrimination
   by hymenopteran pollinators with a trichromatic visual system. When the
   flower spectra are plotted in a colour space designed for hymenoptera,
   the data reveals that most of the flower colours would be well detected
   against background foliage, and often reliably discriminated from the
   other flowers appearing in the same alpine environment. We thus
   demonstrate that New Zealand alpine flowers are actually well suited for
   visual detection and discrimination by biologically important
   hymenopteran pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{To study how pollinator composition and abundance influence reproduction
   of Phormium tenax, we compared pollen deposition by bees and birds to
   unvisited flowers, and plant reproductive success and outcrossing rates
   in populations on island and mainland sites that vary in bird abundance.
   Bees deposited pollen on stigmas if stigmas were close to the anthers
   but deposited little pollen on stigmas of emasculated flowers,
   suggesting that they are largely depositing self pollen. Birds deposit
   pollen on both intact and emasculated flowers with well-exserted
   stigmas, suggesting they are depositing more outcross pollen. High
   frequencies of bird claw marks on inflorescences were associated with
   high fruit set, but not seed set. Seed set and seed outcrossing rates
   were positively correlated with the number of unique maternal allozyme
   genotypes in a population and seedlings also showed higher outcrossing
   rates than seeds, suggesting that genetic diversity, selfing and
   inbreeding depression limit reproductive success. These results
   highlight the interplay of pollination and breeding systems in
   determining plant reproductive success.}},
