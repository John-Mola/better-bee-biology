Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were to determine the percentage of
   out-crossing, isolation distance and pollinator insect species for
   cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seed production in the Aydin region in
   Turkey. The glandless and red-leaf traits in G hirsutum were used as
   genetic markers. Two experiments were conducted over two years that
   monitored out-crossing in adjacent rows and adjacent plants and
   established that the percentage of out-crossing varied. The percentage
   of out-crossing varied between 0\% and 13.3\% depending on the genetic
   marker. In the experiment to determine isolation distance, natural
   crossing percentage was not observed in 2002, while this percentage was
   0.8\% in the first rows in 2003, In this study, cotton fields were also
   visited once a week during flowering periods for seven weeks in order to
   determine the numbers of pollinator insect species, where the only
   detected species was the honey bee. The numbers of pollinator insects
   were 2.14\% (2002) and 1.30\% (2003) for adjacent rows; 1.71\% (2002)
   and 2.00\% (2003) for adjacent plants in glandless parcels. It is
   recommended that the isolation distance between genotypes Should be
   approximately I m.}},

   Reward for Pollinators?}},

Abstract = {{As well as nutritional rewards, some plants also reward ectothermic
   pollinators with warmth. Bumble bees have some control over their
   temperature, but have been shown to forage at warmer flowers when given
   a choice, suggesting that there is some advantage to them of foraging at
   warm flowers (such as reducing the energy required to raise their body
   to flight temperature before leaving the flower). We describe a model
   that considers how a heat reward affects the foraging behaviour in a
   thermogenic central-place forager (such as a bumble bee). We show that
   although the pollinator should spend a longer time on individual flowers
   if they are warm, the increase in total visit time is likely to be
   small. The pollinator's net rate of energy gain will be increased by
   landing on warmer flowers. Therefore, if a plant provides a heat reward,
   it could reduce the amount of nectar it produces, whilst still providing
   its pollinator with the same net rate of gain. We suggest how heat
   rewards may link with plant life history strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A decline in pollination function has been linked to agriculture
   expansion and intensification. In northwest Argentina, pollinator visits
   to grapefruit, a self-compatible but pollinator-dependent crop, decline
   by approximately 50\% at 1 km from forest edges. We evaluated whether
   this decrease in visitation also reduces the pollination service in this
   crop. We analysed the quantity and quality of pollen deposited on
   stigmas, and associated limitation of fruit production at increasing
   distances ( edge: 10, 100, 500 and 1000 m) from the remnants of Yungas
   forest. We also examined the quantitative and qualitative efficiency of
   honeybees as pollen vectors. Pollen receipt and pollen tubes in styles
   decreased with increasing distance from forest edge; however, this
   decline did not affect fruit production. Supplementation of natural
   pollen with self- and cross-pollen revealed that both pollen quantity
   and quality limited fruit production. Despite pollen limitation,
   honeybees cannot raise fruit production because they often do not
   deposit sufficient high-quality pollen per visit to elicit fruit
   development. However, declines in visitation frequency well below seven
   visits during a flower's lifespan could decrease production beyond
   current yields. In this context, the preservation of forest remnants,
   which act as pollinator sources, could contribute to resilience in crop
   production. Like wild plants, pollen limitation of the yield among
   animal-pollinated crops may be common and indicative not only of
   pollinator scarcity, but also of poor pollination quality, whereby
   pollinator efficiency, rather than just abundance, can play a broader
   role than previously appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{Mature larvae and pupae of Nomioides patruelis Cockerell and of its
   cleptoparasite, Chiasmognathus pashupati Engel, collected from the
   nesting site near Karachi, Pakistan, are described, providing the first
   account of the immature stages of the respective genera and the first
   such account for any Nomioidini. An egg of N. patruelis is also
   described.
   An analysis, based on both halictid specimens and descriptions from the
   literature, reveals that the three subfamilies (Rophitinae, Nomiinae,
   and Halictinae) of Halictidae can be distinguished on the basis of their
   mature larvae. A key is provided for their identification. Mature larvae
   of the tribes of the Halictinae are so similar they cannot be
   distinguished at present, although studies of additional representatives
   may yield diagnostic features particularly concerning mandibular anatomy
   and perhaps body size. Features of the mature larvae when mapped onto a
   phylogeny of the Halictidae (Pesenko, 2000) provide a hypothesis for the
   sequence of anatomical changes in the evolution of mature larvae.
   Observations during excavation of the nesting site provided detailed, if
   fragmentary, information concerning nest architecture, provisioning,
   voltinism, and nest parasites of Nomioides paturelis. These are
   discussed in relation to information concerning other species of
   Nomioidini from the literature.
   Chiasmognathus pashupati, like its host, is probably multivoltine. The
   anatomy of the mature larva is similar to that of other Nomadinae,
   especially that of Ammobatini; however, the pupa is distinct from those
   of other known Ammobatini. The mature oocyte of the related C.
   orientanus (Warncke) from Turkey, described previously (Rozen and Ozbek,
   2003), is likely to resemble that of C. pashupati.}},

Abstract = {{Multimodal signals are common in nature and have recently attracted
   considerable attention. Despite this interest, their function is not
   well understood. We test the hypothesis that multimodal signals improve
   decision making in receivers by influencing the speed and the accuracy
   of their decisions. We trained bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) to
   discriminate between artificial flowers that differed either in one
   modality, visual ( specifically, shape) or olfactory, or in two
   modalities, visual plus olfactory. Bees trained on multimodal flowers
   learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that
   differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited
   the previously rewarded flowers at a higher rate than bees trained on
   unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed-accuracy trade-off; bees
   that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on
   multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed-accuracy
   relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that
   multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy
   across range of decision speeds. Our results suggest that bees make more
   effective decisions when flowers signal in more than one modality, and
   confirm the importance of studying signal components together rather
   than separately.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the widespread assumption that the learning abilities of animals
   are adapted to the particular environments in which they operate, the
   quantitative effects of learning performance on fitness remain virtually
   unknown. Here, we evaluate the learning performance of bumble-bees
   (Bombus terrestris) from multiple colonies in an ecologically relevant
   associative learning task under laboratory conditions, before testing
   the foraging performance of the same colonies under the field
   conditions. We demonstrate that variation in learning speed among
   bumble-bee colonies is directly correlated with the foraging
   performance, a robust fitness measure, under natural conditions.
   Colonies vary in learning speed by a factor of nearly five, with the
   slowest learning colonies collecting 40\% less nectar than the fastest
   learning colonies. Such a steep fitness function is suggestive of strong
   selection for higher learning speed. Partial correlation analysis
   reveals that other factors such as forager body size or colour
   preference appear to be negligible in our study. Although our study does
   not directly prove causality of learning on foraging success, our
   approach of correlating natural within-species variation in these two
   factors represents a major advance over traditional between-species
   correlative analyses where comparability can be compromised by the fact

Abstract = {{This study examined how field boundary habitat quality and farming
   system (organic or conventional) affect species richness and abundance
   of diurnal lepidopterans and bumblebees in boreal agricultural
   landscapes. The results showed positive effects of field boundary area
   on lepidopteran diversity, as well as positive effects of nectar flower
   abundance on lepidopterans and bumblebee abundance. Organic farming did
   not show any significant effects on lepidopteran diversity. The results
   suggested that a successful conservation strategy for lepidopterans
   occurring in boreal agroecosystems depend on proper management of field
   boundaries, irrespective of farming regime. As bumblebee diversity
   tended to be higher at organic plots it is concluded that these
   important pollinators might be able to react on even small changes in
   habitat quality of cultivated lands. The results concord with a general
   hypothesis that effects of organic farming might be overpowered by
   effects of landscape structure in heterogeneous landscapes. (c) 2007

   Iowa, USA in the summer of 2004. Bee communities in ruderal areas were
   significantly less diverse than those in native tallgrass prairie
   remnants, with about half as many species and approximately a third as
   many bees. Diversity, abundance, and richness of floral resources were
   also significantly less in ruderal grasslands than in native prairies,
   indicating that poor floral resource levels may substantially
   depauperate their bee communities. Common bees dominated the composition
   of the ruderal grasslands; only one rare species in this study was found
   at a ruderal site, indicating that high-quality prairie remnants are
   important reservoirs of bee diversity. Abundance of flowering ramets of
   a plant species was a significant predictor of the abundance of bees
   found on that plant. There was also a preference for human-yellow
   flowers after adjusting for ramet abundance and there were significantly
   more bees caught in yellow pan traps than blue or white ones. The
   abundance, but not the richness, of small bee species (length <= 7.5 mm)
   was less than expected at ruderal sites when compared to prairies,
   implying the presence of local nesting opportunities in ruderal
   grasslands for small bees but insufficient resources to support large
   populations. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the sexually deceptive orchid genus Ophrys, reproductive isolation is
   based on the specific attraction of mates of a single pollinator
   species, mostly bees, by mimicking the female sex pheromone of this
   species. Changes in the floral odor can lead to hybridization,
   introgression, and possibly speciation. We investigated hybrid swarms of
   O. lupercalis and O. iricolor on Sardinia using behavioral,
   electrophysiological (GC-EAD), chemical, morphological, and genetic
   methods (AFLPs). In behavioral experiments. approximately 20\% of the
   flowers from both species and hybrids were attractive to the ``wrong{''}
   or both pollinator species. Analysis of the EAD-active hydrocarbons in
   the floral odor showed an overlap in the two species, whereby hybrid
   individuals could not be separated from O. iricolor. The genetic
   analysis confirmed the hybridization of the species. Plants of O.
   iricolor and hybrids are genetically indistinguishable and form an O.
   iricolor x lupercalis hybrid population. Remaining plants of O.
   lupercalis will possibly be displaced by the O. iricolor x lupercalis
   hybrid population in the future. Our study showed that in deceptive
   orchids, variation in the pollinator attracting cues, in this case,
   scent, can be the first step for speciation and at the same time cause
   the displacement of a species.}},

   shape, flower colour and pollinator preference in chilean Mimulus}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{641-650}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Adaptation to different pollinators is thought to
   drive divergence in flower colour and morphology, and may lead to
   interspecific reproductive isolation. Floral diversity was tested for
   association with divergent pollinator preferences in a group of four
   closely related wildflower species: the yellow-flowered Mimulus luteus
   var. luteus and the red-pigmented M. l. variegatus, M. naiandinus and M.
   cupreus.
   Methods Patterns of pollinator visitation were evaluated in natural
   plant populations in central Chile, including both single-species and
   mixed-species sites. Floral anthocyanin pigments were identified, and
   floral morphology and nectar variation were quantified in a common
   garden experiment using seeds collected from the study sites.
   Key Results Mimulus l. luteus, M. l. variegatus and M. naiandinus are
   morphologically similar and share a single generalist bumblebee
   pollinator, Bombus dahlbomii. Mimulus cupreus differs significantly from
   the first three taxa in corolla shape as well as nectar characteristics,
   and had far fewer pollinator visits.
   Conclusions This system shows limited potential for pollinator-mediated
   restriction of gene flow as a function of flower colour, and no evidence
   of transition to a novel pollinator. Mimulus cupreus may experience
   reduced interspecific gene flow due to a lack of bumblebee visitation,
   but not because of its red pigmentation: rare yellow morphs are equally
   undervisited by pollinators. Overall, the results suggest that factors
   other than pollinator shifts may contribute to the maintenance of floral
   diversity in these Chilean Mimulus species.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of Cypripedium henryi Rolfe, a slipper orchid
   endemic to west China, was investigated, and its floral shape, size,
   colour, and scent were analysed. Examination of the breeding system
   suggests that the flowers are self-compatible, but need pollen vectors
   for successful reproduction. The flower is rewardless; over 15 insects
   belonging to Araneida, Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera
   were recorded as flower visitors, but most only alighted or rested on
   the flower. In the total 32 h of observations over 2 years, female
   Lasioglossum bees were found to be the most frequent visitors and the
   only pollinators. They showed a high visitation frequency and,
   surprisingly, re-visited the same flowers frequently. Cypripedium henryi
   probably attracts pollinators visiting the flowers through general food
   deception (odour components, colour, false nectar guides), as well as
   special structures (slippery labellum, slippery staminode). Although
   three Lasioglossum species visited the flowers, only L. sauterum Fan et
   Ebmer was found with pollen. Lasioglossum flavohirtum Ebmer was large
   and climbed out from the entrance. Morphologically, L. sichuanense Fan
   et Ebmer could be considered as a potential pollinator, but the
   collected specimens were found to have no pollen of C. henryi on their
   bodies. It was speculated that the particular floral scent of C. henryi
   discouraged the entrance of L. sichuanense bees. Lasioglossum sauterum
   was matched morphologically to the flower, but not all of the
   visitations resulted in effective pollinations, as some flowers of C.
   henryi were frequently re-visited and the pollen mass had been taken
   away by bees on previous visitations. (c) 2008 The Linnean Society of

   In G. triflora var. japonica and H. middendorffii var. esculenta, change

   concentration occurred depending on flower age. In L. sessilifolia, both
   the mean nectar volume and nectar sugar concentration clearly decreased

Journal = {{CONSERVATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-36}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Developing landscape design principles for the provision of ecosystem
   services is crucial to efficient and widespread implementation of
   environmental service-based projects. We investigate optimal farm design
   for agricultural pollination services from bees nesting in native
   habitat, integrating ecological and economic approaches in a spatial
   modeling framework. We evaluate the simplest case, and then add
   consideration of bee metapopulation dynamics and heterogeneity in
   farmland productivity. We find that the need for spatially even
   pollination coverage across farms means that bee habitat is often denser
   at the edges, rather than the centers, of optimally designed farms, and
   also highly constrains the ability of farmers to site bee habitat in
   less-productive areas of farms with spatial gradients in agricultural
   fertility. Optimal farm configuration is not purely a matter of uniform
   size and spacing of bee habitat: in some circumstances, farms combine
   large parcels-to ensure bee population persistence-with smaller,
   dispersed patches to provide spatially continuous pollination services.
   The highest-yield farm designs are those with a relatively small (but
   non-zero) area of pollination reservoirs, suggesting a conservation
   strategy of small parcels of service-providing habitat interspersed
   throughout working landscapes. The design principles outlined here are
   likely general and applicable to other ecosystem services supplied at
   local scales, such as agricultural pest control.}},

Pages = {{232-238}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Reliable methods for quantifying population size are crucial for
   strategies to conserve endangered wild-bee species. Estimates of
   population size obtained through survey walks were compared with
   estimates obtained through mark-recapture studies in 10 populations of
   the red-listed solitary bee Andrena hattorfiana in southern Sweden.
   2. The mean number of bees observed during survey walks was strongly
   correlated with estimates of population size obtained with
   mark-recapture. It was found that 5.5-23.4\% (mean 13.4\%) of the total
   population was observed during an average survey walk.
   3. One component in mark-recapture analysis is the measure of survival
   of individuals. In the largest bee population, females of A. hattorfiana
   that emerged in early season were found to forage for pollen on average
   18.4 days.
   4. The findings suggest that during large-scale surveys, for example
   re-inventories for red-listed species, the population size of solitary
   bees can be quantified reliably and effectively by performing survey
   walks in a two-step process. The first step consists of survey walks to
   establish the relationship between number of bee observations per survey
   walk and mark-recapture population size for a small set of populations.
   In the second, simple observation survey walks can be performed for a
   large set of populations. In each population of A. hattorfiana, it is
   recommended that at least six survey walks are performed.}},

   and cacao, and their pollinators, which are of basic ecological interest
   as partners in an important mutualistic interaction. We review how
   insect-mediated pollination services depend on local agroforest and
   natural habitats in surrounding landscapes. Further, we evaluate the
   functional significance of pollinator diversity and the explanatory
   value of species traits, and we provide an intercontinental comparison
   of pollinator assemblages. We found that optimal pollination success
   might be best understood as a consequence of niche complementarities
   among pollinators in landscapes harboring various species. We further
   show that small cavity-nesting bees and small generalist beetles were
   especially affected by isolation from forest and that larger-bodied
   insects in the same landscapes were not similarly affected. We suggest
   that mixed tropical landscapes with agroforestry systems have great
   potential for future research on the interactions between plants and
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyzeatabases on birds and insects to assess
   patterns of functional diversity in human-dominated landscapes in the
   tropics. A perspective from developed landscapes is essential for
   understanding remnant natural ecosystems, because most species
   experience their surroundings at spatial scales beyond the plot level,
   and spillover between natural and managed ecosystems is common.
   Agricultural bird species have greater habitat and diet breadth than
   forest species. Based on a global data base, bird assemblages in
   tropical agroforest ecosystems were composed of disproportionately more
   frugivorous and nectarivorous, but fewer insectivorous bird species
   compared with forest. Similarly, insect predators of plant-feeding
   arthropods were more diverse in Ecuadorian agroforest and forest
   compared with rice and pasture, while, in Indonesia, bee diversity was
   also higher in forested habitats. Hence, diversity of insectivorous
   birds and insect predators as well as bee pollinators declined with
   agricultural transformation. In contrast, with increasing agricultural
   intensification, avian pollinators and seed dispersers initially
   increase then decrease in proportion. It is well established that the
   proximity of agricultural habitats to forests has a strong influence on
   the functional diversity of agroecosystems. Community similarity is
   higher among agricultural systems than in natural habitats and higher in
   simple than in complex landscapes for both birds and insects, so natural
   communities, low-intensity agriculture, and heterogeneous landscapes
   appear to be critical in the preservation of beta diversity. We require
   a better understanding of the relative role of landscape composition and
   the spatial configuration of landscape elements in affecting spillover
   of functionally important species across managed and natural habitats.
   This is important for data-based management of tropical human-dominated
   landscapes sustaining the capacity of communities to reorganize after
   disturbance and to ensure ecological functioning.}},

Abstract = {{The introduced Bombus terrestris has recently been naturalized in Japan
   and become dominant in some local communities. We investigated potential
   niche overlaps between introduced and native bumblebees in terms of
   morphological characteristics, seasonal flight activity, foraging and
   nesting habitat use, and plant species visited. There were considerable
   niche overlaps in flower resource use between B. terrestris and B.
   hypocrita sapporoensis/B. pseudobaicalensis. Bombus terrestris also
   potentially competes for nest sites with B. hypocrita sapporoensis.
   During 3-year monitoring, B. pseudobaicalensis showed no noticeable
   change, but B. hypocrita sapporoensis decreased while B. terrestris
   increased. Abundant flower resources provided by exotic plants may
   buffer native bumblebees from competition for food with introduced
   species. By contrast, the number of nest usurpers found in B. terrestris
   nests increased between 2003 and 2005, indicating that availability of
   nest sites was limiting and queens strongly competed for nest sites. Our
   findings suggest that competition for nest sites rather than flower
   resources is the major ecological mechanism for displacement of native
   bees. The large reduction of B. hypocrita sapporoensis queen indicates
   that B. terrestris may cause local extinction of native bumblebees.
   Control of established B. terrestris populations and prevention of
   further range expansion are urgently needed.}},

Abstract = {{Pink-flowered tubular Penstemon roseus (Plantaginaceae), which has
   shifted partially to hummingbird pollination, blooms on high-elevation
   slopes in the mountains in Tlaxcala, Mexico. We studied the interactions
   between pollinator visitation rates to flowers, pollen removal and
   deposition, flower size, and nectar removal frequency on seed production
   in P. roseus. We combine observational and experimental studies in two
   contrasting natural populations. Our manual pollinations revealed that
   P. roseus is fully self-compatible. Autonomous self- and manual
   self-pollinated flowers matured as many seeds as when outcrossed, but
   outcrossing seems to become better than selfing as the flowering season
   progressed. Early in the season flowers that were bagged and
   hand-selfed, hand-outcrossed, or autonomously selfed, or unbagged and
   naturally pollinated had equal seed set in all four treatments. But
   later in the season, outcross pollen gave approximately twice as much
   seed set as the two self-treatments. Low levels of pollen receipt and
   pollen removal were consistent with the long time elapsed for a given
   plant to be visited by hummingbirds, which suggests pollen shortage in
   both sites. Despite differences in pollinator visitation rates to
   flowers, probability of flower visitation, removal and deposition of
   pollen, and nectar production rates between populations, we found that
   total nectar production had no effect on seed production at either site.
   The daily nectar secretion rate of 0.3-0.65 mg sugar per flower per 1-3
   days was low relative to other hummingbird-adapted Penstemon species
   (typical range: 1.5-5 mg sugar per flower), and it might be intermediate
   between hummingbird- and bee-adapted Penstemon flowers. Our results
   support the hypothesis about a shift toward hummingbird pollination, and
   provide an example of a `despecialized' Penstemon species, which
   attracts high-energy pollinators (hummingbirds) and profits from
   outcrossing, but retains bee-syndrome floral traits and low sugar
   production rates.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes and analyses the behavior of L. lurida flower
   visitors in fragments of tabuleiro lowland forest. This monoecious
   species flowered from October to January. The flowers opened between
   5:30 and 10:00 a.m. and floral anthesis did not exceed one day.
   Standardizing samples on flowers resulted in 172 bees, belonging to ten
   genera and 18 species. Epicharis flava (42,3\%), Xylocopa frontalis
   (16,3\%) and Eufriesea surinamensis (11,6\%) performed the highest
   relative frequencies, mainly occuring between 7:00 and 11:00a.m.
   Centridini, Euglossina and Xylocopini bees took nectar on flowers and
   were considered effective pollinators. Megachile collected pollen and
   also was potential pollinator. Oxaea flavescens acted as nectar thief by
   piercing the flower hood. Experiments of spontaneous autopollination
   indicated no fruit set and low fruit set (0,48\%) was observed in
   flowers under natural conditions. As discussed for other zygomorphic
   flowers of Lecythidaceae, the complex floral morphology restrict
   visitors to large or robust bees that can get into the flower through
   the floral hood. Nevertheless Centridini was the main pollinator group
   of L. lurida, which differs from the pollinators indicated in other
   studies on Lecythidaceae in the Amazonian region.}},

Abstract = {{Does the food's sugar concentration affect recruitment behaviour in the
   stingless bee Nan-notrigona testaceicornis? We recorded intranidal
   forager behaviour while offering sugar water of constant, increasing, or
   decreasing concentrations. Running speed was not correlated with sugar
   concentration but the jostling contacts/sec were. Food profitability
   also affected the recruiter's thorax vibrations: Pulse duration and duty
   cycle followed both concentration increases and decreases. Sugar
   concentration also influenced the number of recruited bees. In
   comparison to the phylogenetically closely related Scaptotrigona,
   Nan-notrigona's intranidal recruitment behaviour showed a more elaborate
   association with food profitability. This is likely to reflect
   differences in ecology and foraging strategies as Nannotrigona - in
   contrast to Scaptotrigona - does not lay scent trails to guide recruits
   to a food source.}},

Abstract = {{Most plants are generalist in terms of pollination, with the potential
   for significant spatial and temporal variation in their pollinators. Few
   studies have investigated how variable pollinators are in a generalist
   pollination system or how this variation affects plant reproduction. We
   investigated the degree of variation in pollinators and resulting
   reproductive success among populations of a widespread
   generalist-pollinated herb, Trachymene incisa (Apiaceae). The European
   honeybee was unexpectedly absent from the pollinator assemblages,
   providing the unique opportunity to study the native Australian
   pollinators. Insect visitation rates and the taxonomic composition of
   the pollinator assemblage varied significantly across populations,
   indicating that populations of T. incisa are not equally serviced and
   are not equally generalist. This highlights that sampling one population
   would not characterize the extent of species generalization. There was
   no positive correlation between insect visitation rate and reproductive
   success, with the Agnes Banks population receiving the highest
   visitation rate but producing the lowest reproductive output, and the
   Myall Lakes population receiving the lowest visitation rate and
   producing the highest seedling emergence. This study shows that
   variation in pollinators can have measurable effects on populations of
   generalist-pollinated plants, therefore there is potential for
   large-scale change in all plant-pollinator interactions. (C) 2008 The

Abstract = {{Solitary cavity-nesting bees, especially trap-nesting Megachilidae, have
   great potential as commercial pollinators. A few species have been
   developed for crop pollination, but the diversity, abundance, and
   potential pollination contributions of native cavity-nesting bees within
   agricultural systems have seldom been assessed. Our objectives were to
   compare the diversity and fecundity of cavity-nesting bees in Nova
   Scotia in natural ecosystems with those in apple orchards under three
   levels of management, using trap nests, and to determine whether any
   native bees show promise for development as pollinators. Our results
   show that species richness and numbers of bees reared from trap nests in
   commercially managed orchards, abandoned orchards, and natural habitats
   were similar, and species' compositional patterns were not unique to
   specific habitats. Trap nests can be used to increase and maintain
   cavity-nesting bee populations within Nova Scotia apple orchards. Osmia
   tersula Cockerell (Megachilidae), which accounted for almost 45\% of all
   bees captured and was the most abundant species nesting in all habitats
   evaluated, should be assessed for potential as a commercial pollinator
   of spring-flowering crops. The influence of natural cavities on bee
   species richness in trap-nesting surveys is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Acrocerid flies are often considered to be rare and their role in
   pollination is poorly understood. In this study, adult Eulonchus
   sapphirinus Osten Sacken were common on flowers of Geranium robertianum
   L. (Geraniaceae) in Olympic National Park, Washington, and have
   morphological and behavioural characteristics that indicate a dependence
   on floral nectar. Both males and females of this species are good
   potential pollinators from a behavioural standpoint. They make few
   revisits to individual flowers, remain highly constant to one flowering
   species in each nectar-foraging bout, and carry pollen on their bodies.
   Individuals were abundant and formed the majority of insect visitors to
   G. robertianum flowers. Males and females differed in their
   flower-visiting behaviour, with females visiting more individual flowers
   and doing so more slowly than males. This difference between the sexes
   appears to relate to mating behaviour, which takes place within the
   flower patches. The ramifications of the observed flower-visiting and
   mating behaviour for flower pollination are discussed. This study shows
   that based on both their abundance and their behaviour, these flies are
   potentially important pollinators in certain habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Impatiens glandulifera Royle (Himalayan balsam) is an invasive alien
   annual up to 3 in in height with showy flowers that are generally pink
   or purplish. Native to the Himalayan region, I. glanditlifera was first
   recorded in Canada in 1901 in Ottawa, and is now found in eight Canadian
   provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, New
   Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. Impatiens glandulifera
   is typically found in riparian habitats and may spread rapidly because
   its seeds are readily transported via waterways. Up to 2500 seeds are
   produced per plant and dispersed explosively Lip to 5 in from the parent
   plant. This can result in dense monotypic stands which prevent
   establishment of native plants and make stream banks vulnerable to
   erosion when the shallow-rooted plants die back. Impatiens glandulifera
   is susceptible to glyphosate but because herbicide use in riparian areas
   is not advised, other control methods such as hand weeding, mowing or
   flaming have been used. Methods for eradication are most successful when
   upstream Populations are controlled first, Lis the plants spread
   downstream. Removal of I. glandulifera should be managed synchronously
   with non-native control measures and ideally be accompanied by planting
   native species to ensure the restoration of native species composition.
   The prognosis for curbing its spread in Canada seems poor as it has
   quite rapidly become established along waterways in many regions,
   following a pattern seen over the past two centuries in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments, one in a greenhouse in Winter and the other in the

   hand-pollinated, whereas in the Summer the plants lay on the beds and
   were naturally bee-pollinated. The number of fruit per plant did not
   significantly affect individual fruit weight or seed yield components in
   either experiment. In contrast, fruit-set order position affected the
   seed yield components in the field, but not in the greenhouse. In the
   field experiment, both seed number per fruit and mean seed weight
   decreased with increasing fruit-set order position. The number of seeds
   per fruit in `Poinsett 76' cucumber, a cultivar with a strong tendency
   to parthenocarpic fruit-set, varied, and was affected by cultural
   conditions. The number of fully-developed seeds per fruit was often low,
   far below its full potential. In the present study, this was expressed
   in high mean percentages of empty seeds: 58\% and 55\% in Winter and
   Summer, respectively. Neither the number of fruit per plant, nor the
   fruit-set order position affected the germination percentages at fruit
   harvest, or after up-to-7 years in storage. In all germination tests,
   Summer- and Winter-produced seeds achieved germination percentages of
   80-95\% and > 95\%, respectively. On the other hand, the speed of
   germination was decreased by storage, and was slower in seeds extracted
   from immature fruit than in those from fully mature fruit.}},

Abstract = {{The Xylocopinae contains four tribes with species which show a range of
   nesting habits, from solitary to social. The Manueliini is the sister
   group to all other Xylocopine tribes, with one genus, Manuelia, of three

   is scarcely known for two species, M. gayatina and M. gayi, and so far
   completely unknown for M. postica. This paper reports on nesting
   substrates, nest architecture, nesting behaviours, life cycle, and
   interactions between females at nesting sites, for M. postica. The
   results indicate that M. postica presents some features which are
   typical of solitary life, and also some features which are unusual in
   solitary bees but have been reported in phylogenetically more apical
   social species. Our findings open interesting questions on the

Abstract = {{Among the factors thought to have favoured the evolution of deception
   (rewardlessness) in orchids is the reduction of pollinator-mediated
   selfing when unrewarded pollinators visit fewer flowers per
   inflorescence. We obtained data on natural levels of geitonogamy in the
   deceptive orchids Dactylorhiza sambucina and Himantoglossum hircinum by
   monitoring the dispersal and receipt of colour-coded pollinia. As
   donors, we marked 185 flowers of D. sambucina and 956 flowers of H.
   hircinum. In D. sambucina, 30\% of the pollinator-visited flowers and
   62\% of the marked inflorescences experienced geitonogamous pollination
   events. In H. hircinum, the respective percentages were 36 and 71\%. The
   furthest pollen transport distance in the Andrena-pollinated H. hircinum
   was 6.9 m (median 1.27 m), while the furthest transport in the
   bumblebee-pollinated D. sambucina was 176 m (median 1.23 m), a record in
   Orchidaceae. An analysis of pollen-tracking studies in orchids revealed
   geitonogamy levels of around 40\% (based on individuals; 19-37\% based
   on flowers) in both rewardless species and rewarding ones. This is
   similar to geitonogamy levels in other animal-pollinated angiosperms,
   although the data basis for comparison may still be too small. So far,
   however, it is not evident that rewardless orchids experience
   particularly low levels of geitonogamy.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are traditionally thought to perceive non-flowering crop
   fields as hostile landscape matrix. In this study, we show that
   landscapes composed of higher proportions of organic crop fields support
   more bee species at greater abundances in fallow strips. An increase in
   organic cropping in the surrounding landscape from 5\% to 20\% enhanced
   bee species richness in fallow strips by 50\%, density of solitary bees
   by 60\% and bumble bee density by 150\%. Bee species richness and bumble
   bee density responded strongest to organic cropping in landscape sectors
   with 500 m radius, solitary bee density in landscape sectors with 250 m
   radius. The most likely source of these results is that crop and noncrop
   habitats are strongly connected via bee foraging at the landscape scale.
   It seems likely that bees depending on nesting sites in fallow strips
   benefited from the more abundant flower resources provided by
   broadleaved weeds in organic crop fields. We conclude that the
   incorporation of organic crop fields into conventionally managed
   agricultural landscapes can provide food resources needed to sustain
   greater pollinator species richness in noncrop habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissus triandrus is a tristylous daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula
   that has striking geographical variation in floral morphology and
   style-morph ratios. Here, we investigate the relation between this
   variation and ecological factors to understand mechanisms governing
   morph ratios. We estimated morph ratios in 124 populations throughout
   the range of N. triandrus and measured 13 morphological traits in 35-78
   populations. Sampling of morph ratios conducted over 2-10-yr intervals
   demonstrated strong temporal stability. Variation in floral and
   vegetative traits enabled statistical prediction of morph-frequency
   variation among populations. Latitudinal gradients in precipitation and
   temperature were correlated with plant and flower size, with larger
   flowers in northern populations associated with bumblebee visitation and
   stylar dimorphism. Flowers of the L- and M-morphs differed significantly
   from the S-morph in several size-related characters, unlike other
   tristylous species. This pattern and the similarity in anther positions
   of the L- and M-morphs suggest that the M-morph of N. triandrus
   originated through genetic modifiers that shortened styles of the
   L-morph. Our findings support the hypothesis that geographical variation
   in style-morph ratios is largely governed by climatic gradients in the

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Many orchid flowers have glands called elaiophores
   and these reward pollinating insects with oil. In contrast to other
   reward-producing structures such as nectaries, the anatomy of the
   elaiophore and the process of oil secretion have not been extensively
   studied. In this paper, elaiophore structure is described for two
   members of Oncidiinae, Oncidium trulliferum Lindl. and Ornithophora
   radicans (Rchb.f.) Garay \& Pabst.
   Methods Elaiophores of both species were examined using light
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy.
   Key Results and Conclusions In flowers of Oncidium trulliferum and
   Ornithophora radicans, oil is secreted by morphologically distinct
   elaiophores associated with the labellar callus. However, in O.
   trulliferum, elaiophores also occur on the lateral lobes of the
   labellum. In both these species, the epithelial elaiophores are composed
   of a single layer of palisade-like epidermal cells and a distinct
   subepithelial layer. Secretory elaiophore cells may contain numerous,
   starchless plastids, mitochondria and smooth endoplasmic reticulum
   profiles. In O. trulliferum, the cytoplasm contains myelin-like figures
   but these are absent from O. radicans. In the former species, cavities
   occur in the cell wall and these presumably facilitate the passage of
   oil onto the elaiophore surface. In O. radicans, the accumulation of oil
   between the outer tangential wall and the cuticle causes the latter to
   become distended. Since it is probable that the full discharge of oil
   from the elaiophores of O. radicans occurs only when the cuticle is
   ruptured by a visiting insect, this may contribute towards pollinator
   specificity. The structure of the elaiophore in these species resembles
   both that found in previously investigated species of Oncidiinae and
   that of certain members of the Malpighiaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial colonies of European bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, have been
   widely used for pollinating tomato plants in greenhouses in Japan;
   however, a wild colony of the species was found in Hokkaido in 1996,
   after which several studies were conducted to investigate the ecological
   impact of the naturalization of B. terrestris to Japanese ecosystems. To
   quantify the status of naturalization, it is necessary to establish a
   method for estimating the population size of the alien bees established
   in the field. Locating bumble bee colonies in the field is, however,
   very difficult because they usually nest underground. In this study, we
   estimated the number of colonies using genetic data from B. terrestris
   queens foraging near greenhouses in Biratori, Hokkaido, Japan, applying
   the Shared Loci Correspondence Analysis (SLCA). Sampled 39 queens were
   assigned to 30 different families, which indicates that most queens came

Abstract = {{Organic farming has been suggested to counteract declines in farmland
   biodiversity, but comparisons to conventional farming have produced
   variable outcomes. To examine whether this is due to the landscape
   context farms are situated in and traits of the studied organisms, we
   surveyed bumble bees in cereal field borders and margins at 12 pairs of
   matched organic and conventional farms, with half the pairs located in
   heterogeneous farmland and the remaining in homogeneous plains. Species
   richness and abundance of bumble bees were significantly positively
   related to both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity. However,
   there was an interaction effect between farming practice and landscape
   context so that species richness and abundance were only significantly
   higher on organic farms in homogeneous landscapes. The higher abundance
   of bumble bees on organic farms was partly related to higher flower
   abundance on these sites. The effect of landscape context on bumble bee
   abundance was stronger for species with medium sized colonies than for
   those with smaller and larger colony sizes. These patterns may reflect
   that species with medium sized foraging ranges are most affected by
   fragmentation of foraging habitat, because colony size reflects the
   spatial scale at which bumble bees utilize resources. We conclude that
   both organic farming and landscape heterogeneity can be used to increase
   bumblebee species richness and abundance, but that organic farming has a
   larger effect in homogeneous landscapes and landscape heterogeneity a
   larger effect on conventional farms. The effects differed between
   species, suggesting that a single prescription to increase pollinator
   abundance may not be valid. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Light availability in the understory of deciduous forests changes
   drastically within the growing season due to the foliage dynamics of
   canopy trees. Because flowering phenology, photosynthetic
   characteristics, and fruiting success respond to such strong seasonality
   in light availability, we hypothesized that understory plants in such
   ecosystems should describe distinct phenological groups or syndromes
   where ``syndrome'' is defined only as a set of characteristics that
   co-occur. To identify these phenological syndromes, we studied the
   flowering phenology, fruit or seed set, and photosynthetic
   characteristics for 18 perennial understory herbaceous species that
   differed in reproductive strategy over eight years in a deciduous forest
   in northern Japan. Three phenological groups emerged from this study:
   (1) spring bloomers, flowering and fruiting before the completion of
   canopy closure; (2) early-summer bloomers, flowering during the progress
   of canopy closure and fruiting after canopy closure; and (3) late-summer
   bloomers, flowering and fruiting after canopy closure. The spring
   bloomers had high photosynthetic rates and high fruiting abilities, but
   the flowering time varied considerably among years due to yearly
   fluctuations of snowmelt date. Bumble bee-pollinated species of spring
   bloomers showed variable seed-set success, while fly-pollinated species
   showed relatively stable seed sets over the years. The early-summer
   bloomers showed low fruiting abilities irrespective of pollination
   success, reflecting severe resource limitation with decelerating light
   availability during fruit development. Although the late-summer bloomers
   showed low photosynthetic rates under low-light conditions, high
   fruit-set success was attained if pollination was sufficient. These
   results support our hypothesis that phenological syndromes may be found
   in deciduous forest understory plants. Given that reproductive success
   of bee-pollinated spring bloomers is highly susceptible to seasonal
   fluctuation, climate change may have its strongest impacts on this
   group.}},

Abstract = {{Non-random mating in plant populations can be influenced by numerous
   reproductive and demographic factors, including floral morphology and
   inter-plant distance. Here, we investigate patterns of outcrossed mating
   through male function in Narcissus triandrus, a tristylous,
   bee-pollinated wild daffodil from the Iberian Peninsula, to test pollen
   transfer models which predict that floral morphology promotes
   asymmetrical mating and biased morph ratios. Unlike other tristylous
   species, N. triandrus has an incompatibility system that permits
   intra-morph mating and long-level rather than mid-level stamens in the
   L-morph. Incomplete sex-organ reciprocity should result in significant
   intra-morph mating in the L-morph. We measured mating patterns in two
   L-biased populations - dimorphic (two style morphs) and trimorphic
   (three style morphs) - using multilocus genotyping and
   maximum-likelihood-based paternity analysis. We also examined the
   spatial distribution of style morphs and neutral markers to investigate
   the potential consequence of spatially restricted mating on morph
   ratios. As predicted, we detected significant amounts of intra-morph
   mating in the L-morph in both populations. Pollen transfer coefficients
   generally supported predictions based on the Darwinian hypothesis that
   anthers and stigmas of equivalent level promote pollinator-mediated
   cross-pollination in heterostylous populations. There was evidence of
   significant spatial aggregation of both style morphs and neutral markers
   in populations of N. triandrus, probably as a result of restricted
   pollen and seed dispersal. Our results provide empirical support for
   theoretical models of pollen transfer, which indicate that the commonly
   observed L-blased morph ratios in Narcissus species result from
   significant intra-morph mating in the L-morph because of its atypical
   floral morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Perimeter trap cropping (PTC) uses an attractive crop to concentrate
   pests at borders and reduce pesticide use while maintaining yield. A
   possible disadvantage of PTC could be pollen flow between border and

   and amount on seed and fruit production were investigated between a main
   crop species, butternut squash (Cucurbita moschata Duch. ex Poir), and a
   PTC species, blue hubbard (C. maxima Duch.). Butternut squash plants
   were hand pollinated in the greenhouse with three pollen composition
   treatments crossed with four pollen amounts. Pure butternut squash
   pollen and mixed pollen produced more seeds per fruit and heavier seeds
   than pure blue hubbard pollen, revealing some incompatibility between
   butternut and blue hubbard. Saturating pollen amounts produced up to six
   times more seeds than lower pollen amounts. Pollen composition did not
   influence fruit set or fruit weight, which are of central importance for
   crop yield. This study suggests that pollen flow between blue hubbard
   borders and butternut squash should not interfere with crop production
   as long as sufficient conspecific pollen is deposited on stigmas.}},

Abstract = {{Importation of exotic bumblebees for greenhouse pollination may be
   restricted in Mexico, thus making it necessary to evaluate the potential
   of native species as pollinators in enclosures. We studied the foraging
   activity and fruit production of tomato using one colony of Nannotrigona
   perilampoides (NP) and one colony of Bombus impatiens (BI) in
   greenhouses with approximate to 1000 plants. Mechanical vibration (MV)
   was included as a test treatment. The foraging activity was measured as
   the number of flowers visited within 5 min, the time spent on a flower
   collecting pollen, the number of visits that a flower received and the
   duration of a foraging trip. BI collected pollen more rapidly, visited
   more flowers within 5 min and did more visits per flower when compared
   with NP that also lasted longer in their trips. Significant correlations
   were found between environmental variables and the number of bees
   entering the hive and the number of bees on the flowers. For NP, the
   highest correlation was found for light intensity whilst in BI a
   negative effect of environmental temperature was detected. Regarding the
   quantity of fruit, BI resulted in higher fruit set when compared with
   NP, but the latter performed similarly to MV. However, the weight of the
   fruit and seed number was significantly higher for BI when compared with
   NP, and this was higher than for MV. Our results demonstrate that at the
   densities of tomato plants tested, one colony of BI was more efficient
   pollinator when compared with NP. We suggest that pollination efficiency
   of NP could have been limited by a reduced number of foragers on the
   plants at a given time and their limited flight range when compared with
   BI. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate if increasing densities
   of colonies of NP could improve tomato yield in tropical greenhouses.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide an important class of ecological services for crop
   plants and native species in many ecosystems, including the tallgrass
   prairie, and their conservation is essential to sustaining prairie
   remnants. In Iowa these remnants are typically either block-shaped or
   long, linear strips along transportation routes. In this study we
   examined differences in the butterfly, bee, and forb community
   composition in linear and block prairie remnants, determined
   correlations between species diversity among butterflies, bees and forbs
   in the 20 prairie remnants sampled, and examined correlations of
   community similarity among butterflies, bees and forbs. Correspondence
   analysis showed that distinct communities exist for butterflies and
   forbs in block versus linear sites and discriminant analysis showed that
   the bee and forb communities in block and linear sites can be
   distinguished on the basis of a few species. Diversity of one group was
   a poor predictor of diversity in another, except for a significant
   inverse relationship between bees and butterflies. These two pollinator
   taxa may be responding very differently to microhabitat components
   within fragmented ecosystems. Our studies show that there need to be
   differences in conservation strategies for bees and butterflies to
   maintain both pollinator communities.}},

Volume = {{155}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-84}},

Abstract = {{Animals that consume plant parts or rewards but provide no services in
   return are likely to have significant impacts on the reproductive
   success of their host plants. The effects of multiple antagonists to
   plant reproduction may not be predictable from studying their individual
   effects in isolation. If consumer behaviors are contingent on each
   other, such interactions may limit the ability of the host to evolve in
   response to any one enemy. Here, we asked whether nectar robbing by a
   bumblebee (Bombus occidentalis) altered the likelihood of pre-dispersal
   seed predation by a fly (Hylemya sp.) on a shared host plant, Ipomopsis
   aggregata (Polemoniaceae). We estimated the fitness consequences of the
   combined interactions using experimental manipulations of nectar robbing
   within and among sites. Within sites, nectar robbing reduced the
   percentage of fruits destroyed by Hylemya. However, the negative effects
   of robbing on seed production outweighed any advantages associated with
   decreased seed predation in robbed plants. We found similar trends among
   sites when we manipulated robbing to all plants within a local
   population, although the results were not statistically significant.
   Taken together, our results suggest that seed predation is not
   independent of nectar robbing. Thus, accounting for the interactions
   among species is crucial to predicting their ecological effects and
   plant evolutionary response.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-animal mutualisms are characterized by weak or asymmetric mutual
   dependences between interacting species, a feature that could increase
   community stability. If invasive species integrate into mutualistic
   webs, they may alter web structure, with consequences for species
   persistence. However, the effect of alien mutualists on the architecture
   of plant - pollinator webs remains largely unexplored. We analyzed the
   extent of mutual dependency between interacting species, as a measure of
   mutualism strength, and the connectivity of 10 paired plant - pollinator
   webs, eight from forests of the southern Andes and two from oceanic
   islands, with different incidences of alien species. Highly invaded webs
   exhibited weaker mutualism than less-invaded webs. This potential
   increase in network stability was the result of a disproportionate
   increase in the importance and participation of alien species in the
   most asymmetric interactions. The integration of alien mutualists did
   not alter overall network connectivity, but links were transferred from
   generalist native species to super-generalist alien species during
   invasion. Therefore, connectivity among native species declined in
   highly invaded webs. These modifications in the structure of pollination
   webs, due to dominance of alien mutualists, can leave many native

   of preadaptations in the attraction of male bees as pollinators}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Within the astonishing diversity of orchid pollination
   systems, sexual deception is one of the most stunning. An example is the
   genus Ophrys, where plants attract male bees as pollinators by mimicking
   female mating signals. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes) are often the
   key signal for this chemical mimicry. Here we investigate the evolution
   of these key compounds within Orchidinae by mapping their production in
   flowers of selected species onto their estimated phylogeny.
   Results: We found that alkenes, at least in trace amounts, were present
   in 18 of 20 investigated species together representing 10 genera. Thus,
   the reconstruction of ancestral state for alkene-production showed that
   this is a primitive character state in Ophrys, and can be interpreted as
   a preadaptation for the evolution of sexual deception. Four of the
   investigated species, namely Ophrys sphegodes, Serapias lingua, S.
   cordigera, and Anacamptis papilionacea, that are pollinated primarily by
   male bees, produced significantly larger amounts and a greater number of
   different alkenes than the species pollinated either primarily by female
   bees or other insects.
   Conclusion: We suggest that high amounts of alkenes evolved for the
   attraction of primarily male bees as pollinators by sensory
   exploitation, and discuss possible driving forces for the evolution of
   pollination by male bees.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Spadiseius gen. nov. of the ascoid family Melicharidae is
   described, based on all instars of two newly described species in Costa
   Rica and adults of four undescribed species in Costa Rica and Brazil.
   These mites undergo their life histories quickly in spike or spadix
   inflorescences of their plant hosts in lowland tropical rainforests,
   where they apparently feed on nectar or pollen. One inflorescence may
   bear hundreds of the developing mites in all instars. Pollen is found on
   all instars of these mites, which may act as miniature pollinators of
   their plant hosts. Adult males are strongly sexually dimorphic, with
   bizarrely modified setae peripherally on the body dorsum and on dorsal
   surfaces of the legs. These structures are thought to be used
   competitively for mates, in much the same way as in males of the related
   hummingbird flower mite genera Rhinoseius and Tropicoseius. Spadiseius
   calyptrogynae sp. nov. lives in inflorescences of a palm, Calyptrogyne
   ghiesbreghtiana, and has a phoretic association both with perching bats
   of the genus Artibeus, which are major pollinators of this plant, and
   scarab beetles of the genus Lagochile, which feed destructively on
   flowers of this plant. Spadiseius spathiphyllae sp. nov. lives in
   inflorescences of an aroid, Spathiphyllum friedrichsthalli, and is
   phoretic on meliponine bees of the genus Trigona that pollinate this
   plant. Polymorphism among adult males occurs in both species. In male S.
   calyptrogynae a ``warty{''} ornamentation of the dorsal shield seems to
   be correlated with extreme elongation of certain body and leg setae,
   while in male S. spathiphyllae such disproportionate setal elongation
   seems correlated with more robust individuals of greater body and leg
   dimensions. Several newly recognized morphological attributes are noted
   among species of Spadiseius, including apically forked salivary styli.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the phenological pattern, floral biology, most frequent
   floral visitors and fruit set of Psychotria brachypoda are described.
   This study was carried out in Atlantic forest from October 2003 to
   September 2005. Flowering was annual and intermediate, occurring from
   August to January. Mature fruit production occurred from March to July
   2004 and from February to June 2005. Corolla length and diameter of
   thrum flowers were larger than those of pin flowers. Although stigma
   length corresponded approximately to stamen length in each morph, exact
   reciprocal hercogamy did not occur. The nectar was more concentrated at
   06:30h (33\%) and more diluted at 14:30h (26\%). Flowers in which nectar
   was collected throughout the day had about three times more nectar than
   flowers in which nectar was collected once at the end of the day. There
   were 24 plants with thrum flowers and 25 plants with pin flowers,
   indicating an isopletic population. The main floral visitors were
   females and males of the hummingbird Thalurania glaucopis, bees of the
   tribe Trigonini and of the genus Euglossa, three Lepidoptera species,
   one Diptera species and one Coleoptera. Fruit was produced in 13.7\% of
   the total number of marked flowers, with similar production in both
   morphs. Thalurania glaucopis is probably the most important pollinator
   of P. brachypoda, because it often visits many flowers from different
   individuals of P. brachypoda, probably transferring pollen among them.}},

Abstract = {{Byrsonima chrysophylla, known as ``murici pitanga{''}, is a shrubby
   species occurring in `restinga'. Among its visitors, bees of the
   Centridini tribe as well as Xylocopini bees are frequently found. To
   detect which plant species have been used by the most frequent visitors,
   pollen loads from the back legs (n = 5) and also from natural nests of
   Centris caxiensis (n = 7) were treated by acetolysis. During flowering
   of Byrsonima chrysophylla, this plant species was the main pollen source
   used by bees. Comolia lythrarioides and Myrcia sylvatica were secondary
   pollen sources, Mouriri guianensis was a secondary oil and pollen
   source, while Anacardium microcarpum, Cuphea tenella, Matayba discolor
   and Phthirusa pyrifolia were important nectar sources at this time. The
   pollen detected in the samples probably adhered to the bee's body during
   nectar collection. The results show that the bee visitors do not mix
   pollen sources during the pollen-collecting flight, thus representing
   fidelity to Byrsonima chrysophylla flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Ceriops decandra and C. tagal are evergreen trees in the inner mangrove
   forests in Andhra Pradesh, India. Ceriops decandra is primarily a
   landward species whereas C. tagal is a seaward and highly salt tolerant
   species. Ceriops decandra produces flowers and fruits continuously
   throughout the year while C. tagal produces flowers and fruits during
   winter only. Both species have a mixed mating system with
   cross-pollination as the principal system and self-pollination, which is
   primarily vector-dependent. Ceriops decandra flowers have a simple
   pollination mechanism that is adapted for pollination by daytime
   foragers, Nomia bees and Odynerus wasps. In contrast. C. tagal flowers
   have an elaborate and explosive pollination mechanism. Flies and honey
   bees trip the flowers and contribute to explosive pollination mechanism.
   Flies and honey bees trip the flowers and contribute to explosive pollen
   release and subsequent self- and cross-pollination. Wind is also
   effective in tripping the pollination mechanism but it largely
   contributes to self-pollination. Bud abortion occurs only in C.
   decandra. Flower and fruit abortion occurs in both the species of
   Ceriops. Abortion at different stages of the reproductive unit has been
   considered to be a strategy by the plants to adjust the available
   maternal resources to the growing fruits and propagules. The paper
   provides the basis for further study for the conservation and management
   of Ceriops species in the study areas.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents literature data on the flowering biology of eggplant
   and the influence of flower heterostyly on yielding. Flowers with
   long-styled pistol are the majority among all flowers on a plant (60\%).
   Number of flowers with medium and short style is lower (10-15\% and
   22-30\%, respectively). Eggplants set fruits from flowers with long
   style in 49-100\% and with medium style in 46-85\%. These flower's
   stigmata have well developed nodules and well - permissible tissues rich
   in polysaccharides, proteins styled flowers have small stigmata with
   underdeveloped nodules and, due to worse absorption, they are not
   pollinated and do not set fruits. Taking into account the complexity of
   many factors that make difficult or impossible to self-pollinate the
   eggplant's flowers, the efficiency of three procedures intensifying the
   fruit budding has been presented: bunch vibrating, flower harmonization,
   and natural pollinating by bumblebees. Many authors' studies confirm
   that flower bunch vibrating has not caused sufficient pollen setting on
   stomata and has not been sufficient for good eggplant flower
   pollination. Applying growth regulators appears to be more efficient and
   significantly affects the improvement of eggplant's yielding. The
   highest efficiency has been achieved when applying insects as natural
   pollinators at cultivating the eggplant under covers.}},

Pages = {{149-155}},
Abstract = {{Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) has become an important viral disease of
   greenhouse tomatoes worldwide. The ability of bumble-bees (Bombus
   impatiens), used for pollination, to acquire and transmit PepMV was
   investigated, and the prevalence of PepMV in plants and bumble-bees in
   commercial tomato greenhouses was determined. PepMV infection in plants
   was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while in
   bumble-bees direct real-time PCR was used. In the first experiment, the
   bumble-bees were exposed for 14 days to PepMV-infected plants. After 14
   days, almost all bumble-bees were PepMV positive both in the hive (78.5
   +/- 17.5\%) and in the flowers (96.3 +/- 3.6\%). In the second
   experiment, bumble-bees were released into a greenhouse with both
   PepMV-infected source plants and healthy non-infected target plants for
   14 days. At the end of the experiment, 61.0 +/- 19.5\% of the bees
   collected from the hive and 83.3 +/- 16.7\% of the bees sampled from the
   flowers were PepMV positive. Bumble-bees transmitted PepMV from the
   infected to the healthy non-infected tomato plants. Two weeks after
   bumble-bee release, the virus was detected in leaf, fruit and flower
   samples of formerly healthy plants. After 6 weeks, the percentage of
   PepMV positive samples from the target plants increased to 52.8 +/-
   2.8\% of the leaves and 80.6 +/- 8.4\% of the fruits. In the control
   greenhouse without bumble-bees, the target plants did not become
   infected. Based on the infection levels in flowers, fruits and leaves,
   the PepMV infection occurred possibly first in the pollinated flowers,
   and then spread from the fruit that developed from the flowers to other
   parts of the plant. In commercial greenhouses where PepMV was present,
   92-100\% of the plants and 88-100\% of the bumble-bees were PepMV
   positive. No infected plant samples were found in the control commercial
   greenhouse, but a small number of bumble-bees (10\%) tested PepMV
   positive.}},

   pith (1.9\% of species),wood (1.9\% of species), or soft/rotting wood
   (7.4\% of species) substrates. Soil-nesting individuals were relatively
   rare (25\% of individuals), perhaps due to a lack of proper soils for
   nesting sites. Parasitic species were scarce (5.6\% of species, 2.6\% of
   individuals), most likely because of an absence or rarity of host
   species. Overall, exotic species were abundant and constituted 27\% of
   the total individuals collected and 19\% of the identified species. We
   compare these results to several bee faunal surveys in New Jersey and
   New York State, including newly reported species lists for Central Park
   and Prospect Park in New York City. Relative to other studies, bee
   richness of the urban gardens is reduced and composition is biased
   toward exotic and cavity-nesting species. Nevertheless, despite their
   small size and location within highly urbanized areas, urban community
   gardens harbor a diverse assemblage of bees that may provide pollination
   services and opportunities for ecological exposure and education.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate of two aspects of pollen diet of Andrena bees: the
   evolution of diet breadth within nearctic representatives of the genus,

   within an oligolectic clade of Andrena. We also evaluate phenology.
   Traits were mapped onto a molecular phylogeny to identify the ancestral
   character states. Overall, oligolecty appears to be the basal state
   within Andrena, and broader diets have evolved a number of times,
   suggesting that specialization is not a ``dead end{''}. Within the
   oligolectic clade studied, host shifts occur predominantly between
   members of the same plant tribe, indicating a phylogenetic constraint to
   host-usage; however, shifts to other tribes are not uncommon, and may
   lead to adaptive radiation. Additionally, some lineages retain the
   ability to use pollen from an ancestral host-plant tribe. Finally, we
   find a correlation between using host plants in the family Asteraceae
   and fall emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Bees and the angiosperms they pollinate have developed intimate and
   often complex interactions over the past 100 million years. As in other
   insect-plant interactions, host-plant specificity is variable among
   taxa. While many solitary bee species display an obvious preference for
   a narrow spectrum of host-plants (oligolecty), others regularly visit a
   diversified array of pollen hosts (polylecty). Few studies have examined
   the patterns of host-plant associations in bees using well-resolved
   phylogenies at the species level combined with accurate and quantitative
   data on host-plant preferences. In this study, we examined the evolution
   of bee-plant relationships in several genera of specialist (oligolectic)
   bees. We used the Melittidae s.l. as a model taxon by mapping the
   preferred pollen hosts onto species-level phylogenies to investigate the
   frequency and pattern of host-plant switching. Our results suggest that
   host-plant associations are maintained over time in many lineages, but
   that host switches to unrelated plant families are also common. We find
   some evidence that host-switches occur more frequently to
   morphologically similar, rather than closely-related, host-plants
   suggesting that floral morphology plays a key role in host-plant
   evolution in bees.}},

   strikingly different conclusions. We study an expanded data set

   support increases as more genes are added. Across genes, support for the

   polyphyllum (Vell.) Pabst ex F. Barros that occurs in a rainforest in
   south-eastern Brazil. Its non-rewarding flowers, which attract
   Centridini bees by deceit, are rain-assisted self-pollinated, a
   phenomenon rarely found in orchids and other plant families. In
   addition, self-pollination has never been reported in Cyrtopodiinae and
   data on the pollination of South American orchids are scarce. Flowers
   were observed at different times of the day, on both sunny and rainy
   days, to record floral morphology, visitors and the effects of rainfall
   on flowers. On rainy days, water accumulates on the stigma and dissolves
   the adhesive substance of the stigmatic surface. A viscous drop thus
   forms, which contacts the pollinarium. When evaporation makes the
   viscous drop shrink, the drop moves the pollinarium with the anther onto
   the stigmatic surface and promotes self-pollination. Fruit set in
   natural habitat was low, with 2.4\% at one study site, where a similar
   value (2.2\%) was recorded in flowers self-pollinated by rain. In C.
   polyphyllum, facultative self-pollination assisted by rain is thus an
   important strategy that guarantees fruit set when pollinator's visits
   are scarce, which is common in species pollinated by deceit.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies phenology and pollination ecology of an assemblage of
   nine small-flowered species of Asclepiadoideae-Asclepiadeae in a
   southern Ecuadorian mountain forest. These observations were augmented
   by laboratory studies of floral traits including scanning electron
   microscopy. Supported by multidimensional scaling analysis, three
   distinct pollination systems were identified: (a) pollination by small
   flies (Orthosia, Scyphostelma), (b) pollination by small bees and flies
   (Ditassa), and (c) pollination unspecialized ({''}Cynanchum{''},
   Jobinia, Oxypetaltum). Although numerous floral visitors were observed
   in the field, pollinaria were carried by only seven insect species. The
   average pollinaria removal rate of all species was low with 0.32 +/-
   0.13\%, and still lower for the pollinia insertion rate with 0.13 +/-
   0.07\%. The ratio of inserted pollinia to removed pollinaria was
   comparatively high with an average of 42.7 +/- 22.3\%. If an insect
   achieved pollinia transfer, it did so very effectively. The complex
   floral morphology of the Asclepiadoideae has often been interpreted as a
   general trend toward specialization, but our observations indicate that
   the flowers are specialized functionally rather than ecologically. (C)

   composed of two or more morphs that differ in stigma and anther heights.
   The polymorphism promotes intermorph pollen transfer, thus outcrossing.
   Heterostyly has been reported in 28 angiosperm families and is
   frequently lost in heterostylous lineages. To assess ecological factors
   related to shifts from heterostyly to monomorphy, we examined the
   reproductive ecology of heterostylous tropical shrubs of Psychotria.
   Among 21 species at Barro Colorado Island and the nearby Parque Nacional
   Soberania, Panama, 14 species were heterostylous while seven were
   monomorphic. A molecular phylogeny and the existence elsewhere of
   heterostylous populations indicated that the breakdown of heterostyly
   had occurred independently. Heterostylous and monomorphic species were
   visited by the same bee species, although visit frequencies were lower
   in monomorphic species. Monomorphic species had significantly lower
   population density and greater fruit set than did heterostylous species.
   Autonomous autogamy made a large contribution to fruit set in
   monomorphic species and was only rarely observed in heterostylous
   species. The results indicate monomorphic and heterostylous species
   produce more seeds through selfing and outcrossing, respectively. The
   limitation of outcrossing as a result of low population density may be
   related to the breakdown of heterostyly and the evolution of selfing.

Abstract = {{Populations at geographic range limits may frequently encounter changing
   biotic interactions as well as abiotic constraints. A conundrum in plant
   population biology, the frequent apparent overproduction of flowers, is
   thought to be a response by plant populations to unpredictable
   pollinator environments, such as those that may be expected at the range
   limit. We studied pollinator visitation rates and pollen limitation of
   fruit set in populations of Witheringia solanacea, a widespread
   bee-pollinated species. We compared two populations in the south and two
   in the north of Costa Rica, with each region encompassing a lower
   montane site at the upper elevational limit of the species range with
   small plant populations, and a premontane site where population
   densities were high. Populations in the south, where the climate was
   favorable, had higher pollinator visitation and higher natural fruit
   set, and showed only minor pollen limitation as compared with northern
   populations at windy sites near the Continental Divide. Lower montane
   populations had lower pollinator visitation rates than premontane
   populations but did not show more pollen limitation of fruit set. In
   general, pollen limitation was not inversely proportional to pollinator
   abundance but was higher where the climate is unpredictable.}},

Abstract = {{The floral traits of the inflorescences of angiosperms have coevolved to
   ensure and maximize pollination success. Other factors believed to
   influence floral architecture are external (for example, ecological) to
   the inflorescence. In order to understand the relationships between such
   factors and floral characters, 12 floral traits were measured in 54
   species of Araceae. An analysis was performed to determine how these
   traits are linked to the following: (1) self-pollination capacity; (2)
   life form (evergreen versus seasonally dormant); (3) climatic
   conditions; and (4) type of pollinator (i.e. flies, bees, or beetles). A
   significant difference was found between the pollen to ovule ratio of
   the species able to self-pollinate and those unable to self-pollinate.
   Evergreen and tropical aroids produced a larger number of gametes than
   did seasonally dormant and temperate taxa. Finally, several floral
   traits, such as pollen volume and number, number of female flowers, and
   flower sexual type (unisexual or bisexual), showed clear differences
   between the three pollinator types. Variations in floral traits between
   the different life forms and climatic conditions are discussed with
   respect to pollination efficiency and properties of the growing season.
   The pollen to ovule ratio cannot be considered as an accurate indicator
   of breeding systems in aroids because of the particular pollination
   ecology of the family. (c) 2008 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Rewardless kettle-trap flowers Cypripedium yunnanense and C. flavum were
   watched for pollinators during 73 and 101 man-hours, respectively, in
   north-west Yunnan at 3490-3590 m a.s.l. They differ from typical
   Cypripedium, such as C. calceolus, in having a broad infolded flap of
   the lip extending all around the entrance of the pouch (instead of being
   restricted to the vicinity of the staminode) and in the flap not being
   slippery. Cypripedium yunnanense is pollinated by Lasioglossum zonulum
   euronotum (Halictidae), and C. flavum is pollinated by Andrena orchidea
   and Andrena sp. (Andrenidae, two of nine new hymenopterans discovered at
   the sites). The bees do not inadvertently fall into the trap by slipping
   (as often occurs in other slipper orchids), but enter it by crawling
   down the flap in full control of their movements. No natural hybrids
   between the two orchids are known, although they occur in close-by or
   mixed stands, are co-flowering and size compatible with regard to their
   pollinators, and produce fruits following manual cross-pollination in
   situ. Analyses of the (non-Cypripedium) pollen carried indicate that:
   (1) the two andrenids are probably oligolectic; (2) the andrenids and
   the halictid do not share the same flower species; and (3) the halictid
   is polylectic. Points (1) and (2) are probable reasons for the lack of
   hybrids. The other reason why Lasioglossum zonulum euronotum does not
   visit C. flavum despite being polylectic may be the flower's odour;
   cases of discrimination of closely related flowers by polylectic
   Lasioglossum have been reported elsewhere. Blow flies Calliphora
   vomitoria and Calliphora pattoni (Calliphoridae) also enter the orchids,
   some smearing themselves with pollen, yet they are not pollinators. They
   are too large to leave by the exit and die imprisoned. However, they may
   be accidental pollinators of the rather larger C. tibeticum present at
   the sites. Such accidental pollinators probably play an important role
   in the evolution of new pollination syndromes. (c) 2008 The Linnean

Abstract = {{The role of pollinators in the evolution of the African-Malagasy orchid
   genus Brownleea (Brownleeinae) was investigated. Taxa show
   specialization for pollination by bees (B. parviflora, B. recurvata),
   short-proboscid flies (B. galpinii), and long-proboscid flies (B.
   macroceras, B. coerulea). All species in the genus produce nectar, but

   Species investigated in terms of their breeding systems (B. coerulea, B.

   for seed production. Self-pollination results in strong inbreeding
   depression during embryo formation. A phylogeny of the genus,

Abstract = {{Flower visitors from several insect taxa (bees, butterflies and some
   flies) are known to forage assortatively at flowers where floral colour
   change has occurred; these alterations are often dramatic and the
   flowers are retained on the plant. Here, a further example of floral
   colour change is reported and, for the first time, demonstrated how the
   incidence of such alteration affects foraging in syrphid flies. Feeding
   behaviour in Rhingia campestris and at least two other hoverfly species
   is strongly influenced by a striking and extremely localised colour
   change in the flowers of the wood forget-me-not, Myosotis sylvatica.
   Nearly 99\% of flower visits to pre-change flowers elicited a feeding
   response whereas only 13 \% of visits to post-change flowers led to the
   same behaviour. Feeding times at post-change flowers were 2-3 times
   shorter compared to pre-colour-change residence time. Additionally, we
   confirm centrifugation as a suitable method for extracting low volumes
   of nectar from small tubular flowers; the change in syrphid feeding
   behaviour corresponds with both colour change and floral reward status.}},

Title = {{Flower morphology, phenology and visitor patterns in an alpine community

Pages = {{449-468}},
Abstract = {{Alpine vegetation, restricted to the top of high Mountains, is among the
   vegetation types most endangered by global warming, currently predicted
   to raise temperatures from 1.1 to 6.4 degrees C, by the end of the
   century. Nevertheless, background information allowing evaluation of
   impacts is rather scarce for some geographic zones. Our study of an
   alpine community on the Plateau of Muses (2600-2750 m a.s.l.) of Mt
   Olympos, the highest mountain of Greece, conducted in 1993-1994, can
   provide such background information for the Mediterranean region. We
   studied features relating to phenology of flowering, floral morphology,
   distribution and abundance, and flower visitors of plant species that
   exhibit a biotic pollination syndrome. We identified dominant patterns
   and we further (i) explored the relative contribution of the plant
   features and abiotic factors studied in explaining the activity patterns
   of flower visitors, (ii) examined if flower and visitor traits of the
   alpine community match each other according to the classical pollination
   syndromes, and (iii) investigated whether the responses of individual
   plant species to the yearly climatic variability result into
   phenological patterns that characterize the whole community. The common
   strategy of the alpine community was for early flowering and long flower
   life span; consistently early flowering species were twice as many as
   late flowering ones, whereas floral longevity (estimated for 36 species)
   averaged 5.2 days. Duration of flowering (estimated for 57 species)
   averaged 18.2 days. Climatic variability affected onset of flowering;
   all late flowering species delayed their flowering during the year
   characterized by a humid and cold summer. Duration of flowering and
   floral longevity did not change in a consistent way. Hymenoptera
   (Aculeates) were the dominant flower visitors. They accounted for 43.3\%
   of the visits recorded, with bumblebees making a little less than half.
   Diptera followed making 37.5\% of the visits (most made by syrphid
   flies). There was a mismatch between flower-morphology and flower
   visitor traits; the alpine community had predominantly non-specialized,
   pale-colour flowers, which are traits assumed to correspond to Diptera
   dominance and absence of social bees. Visitation was influenced by
   flower abundance and duration of flowering; proportionately more
   Diptera, and proportionately less Hymenoptera visited species with short
   flowering periods and few flowers present in the field. In a number of
   cases, the phenological and flower visitor patterns of the community of
   Mt Olympos deviated from those observed in other alpine environments
   suggesting a mediterranean influence even at high altitudes. (c) 2008

Abstract = {{Psilochilus modestus Barb. Rodr. is a basal epidendroid orchid occurring
   in both the semi-deciduous and Atlantic rain forests of the state of Sao
   Paulo, southeastern Brazil. This species presents a perfect flowering
   synchrony within populations, since all the mature buds of each plant
   open simultaneously in the morning hours of the same day. These flowers
   are available only for I day and are pollinated by several species of
   small solitary and social native bees. These bees exploit both pollen
   and nectar as a reward. The bees collecting pollen promote a higher
   fruit set and perform mainly self-pollination while those collecting
   nectar, which are less numerous. are responsible for an increase in
   cross-pollinations. P. modestus is self-compatible but pollinator
   dependent. Natural fruit set (open pollination) is low when compared
   with the numbers obtained under manual self- and cross-pollination. Low
   fruit set in natural conditions is related to deficient pollen transfer,
   and pollinator inefficiency seems to be the main factor. Some factors,
   such as the small amount of nectar produced, the low number of flowers
   per inflorescence and their availability for I day only added to the
   perfect flowering synchrony seem to be responsible for the increase of
   cross-pollinations. The offering of both pollen and nectar Lis a reward
   can represent a transitional condition in basal Epidendroideae. Based on
   floral morphology, reward production and pollinator behavior. the
   relationship of P. modestus with the basal and most derived groups
   Within Orchidaceac Is discussed. Crown Copyright (c) 2008 Published by

Abstract = {{Studies on sympatric species that belong to the same taxonomic group and
   have the same pattern of pollination and seed dispersion, but different
   patterns of geographical distribution and structural parameters may be
   worthwhile to understand the evolution of their compatibility system. We
   studied the floral biology, pollinators and reproductive systems of two
   tree species in Itatiaia, an area covered with montane rain forest.
   Pseudopiptadenia contorta is widespread in Brazil but is present at a
   low relative density at the study site, while Pseudopiptadenia
   leptostachya is restrictively distributed but presents one of its
   highest relative density values ill Itatiaia. Both species have small
   flowers arranged ill compact spicate raceme inflorescences that
   constitute the pollination unit. Pollinators are native stingless bees
   and European honeybees that collect pollen from their nectarless
   flowers. Although both species have similar floral characteristics and
   pollination system, their compatibility system differs. Fruit set after
   manual pollinations and observation of the pollen tube growth showed
   that P. leptostachya is self-compatible while P. contorta only set
   Fruits after cross-pollinations, and is thus a self-incompatible
   species. However, fruit set did not differ between the species,
   indicating that structural parameters are not affected by the
   compatibility system. Thus, the difference between these two species ill
   terms of reproductive system may be related to other factors such as
   patterns of geographical distribution. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{23-38}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In certain angiosperm genera, closely related species have diverged from
   one another to converge on different pollination syndromes, whereas
   species with intermediate phenotypes are rare or absent. Convergent
   conformity to syndromes implies the existence of ``evolutionary
   attractors'' toward which phenotypes are drawn; divergent breaks from
   conformity show that populations can escape one attractor and be drawn
   to another. We discuss how these two opposed processes can be reconciled
   for the special case of evolutionary transitions between bee pollination
   and hummingbird pollination. In this case, a third phenomenon, the
   directional bias in favor of transitions from melittophily to
   ornithophily, also needs explanation. Older treatments chiefly ascribed
   convergence to cognitive and morphological properties of pollinators and
   ascribed transitions to geographical differences in pollinator
   availability. Those treatments did not specifically address what factors
   would overcome and disrupt the stabilizing selection that would be
   expected to preserve the pollination syndrome of a plant species. Here,
   we focus on possible contributors to destabilization, especially
   considering the possible roles of ( 1) differences among pollinators in
   pollen-transfer efficiency, ( 2) mutations with large effects on floral
   phenotypes, and ( 3) losses of function in the biochemical pathways that
   produce floral pigments. We conclude that all of these can influence the
   evolution of pollinator transitions but that the process usually needs
   to be initiated by external ecological factors that change the
   visitation rates of pollinators. We discuss the roles of particular
   floral characters in several plant genera that have undergone
   transitions. We expect that transitions reach completion through a
   ``centripetal'' process of selection that incrementally recruits changes
   in multiple characters.}},

Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how ecological context influences the probability
   of transitions in the extent of pollinator specialization. One
   unexplored hypothesis suggests that transitions to environments with
   different light conditions should be accompanied by transitions in
   pollinator guild because of the combined effects of exposure to a new
   pollinator community and the different relative costs associated with
   pollinator attraction in the understory and the canopy. Using data from
   literature surveys, we compiled a data set of habitat light availability
   (e.g., canopy vs. understory), pollinator identity, and guild size for
   481 angiosperm species representing four broad regions (India,
   Neotropics, paleotropics, and Canada). Phylogenetic independent
   contrasts were used to assess the degree to which transitions in canopy
   position are associated with transitions in the usage of particular
   pollinators and pollinator guild size. We further examined the degree to
   which each of these traits tends to be evolutionarily labile versus
   evolutionarily conserved. Our analysis demonstrates that species that
   tend to occupy the same position in the canopy are more closely related
   than expected by chance, as are species that follow traditional
   pollinator syndromes ( e. g., bee or bird), but species that have
   exceptionally wide pollinator guilds (e.g., are visited by bees, flies,
   and moths) are widely scattered across the angiosperm phylogeny.
   Transitions to generalist pollination appeared to be strongly associated
   with beetle and fly pollination and with position in the canopy above
   the forest floor.}},

Title = {{The rare butterfly Tomares nesimachus (Lycaenidae) as a bioindicator for

Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{54}},

Pages = {{111-136}},
Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that insects whose existence depends on fruit
   production may serve as good bioindicators, especially for pollination
   services. In this study we examined this hypothesis, focusing on one of
   Israel's rarest butterflies, Tomares nesimachus (Rhopalocera;
   Lycaen-idae). The butterfly is affiliated with open grasslands in the
   north of Israel, where its sole host plant, Astragalus macrocarpus,
   occurs. In a two-year field study, we mapped the distribution of the
   butterfly in Israel and tried to evaluate the causes of its rarity and
   decline. We found that its abundance in habitat patches was correlated
   with several factors, including (a) fruit production of the host plants
   in each patch, (b) the number of other patches in the vicinity, (c) the
   characteristics of the ``matrix{''} outside the patches within a
   distance of up to 2 km, (d) the richness of large bee species (the plant
   pollinators), and (e) the grazing management of the butterfly's habitat.
   The characteristics of the matrix further affected the richness of bees
   in the butterfly's habitat. Since butterfly abundance is correlated with
   species richness of pollinators, it can serve as an indicator of
   diverse, species-rich butterfly habitats (grasslands). We deduce that
   spccies that depend on fruit production and by themselves do not
   contribute to their host-plant pollination, may almost necessarily be
   affected by multiple ecological factors and therefore can indeed serve
   as good indicators. Our results further indicate that the butterfly's
   population dynamics are affected by large-scale processes, and hence its
   conservation requires the preservation of large open landscapes.
   Consequently, T nesimachus may also serve as an umbrella species.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed several methods for deploying nets over windows and

   prevented from escaping from glass-based greenhouses by both netting
   windows and filling gaps around windows with sponge, tape and/or
   building tamping materials. For windows in greenhouses constructed from
   plastic-covered steel pipe frames, bumblebees did not escape when nets
   were set under the plastic film and over steel frames and fixed to the
   outside of the steel frames, but they did escape when nets were set
   under the steel frames and fixed to their inside. When an entrance was
   netted, double netting was imperfect even with a room in front of the
   entrance; however, a net with a zipper completely prevented bumblebee
   escape. Bumblebees escaped through ventilation fans irrespective of
   whether they were operating, and thus netting was required, but they did
   not escape through fresh-air inlets. Our results indicate that it is
   possible to completely prevent the escape of bumblebees by netting

Abstract = {{The studies of file period and abundance of flowering and the seasonal
   and diurnal dynamics of Lamium purpureum and L. alhum blooming, were
   carried out from 1995-1997 in Pulawy. Poland and from 2002-2005 in
   Lublin. Poland. Sonic morphological features of flowers were observed.
   The abundance of pollen produced in anthers and flowers was studied.
   Both species develop similar number of flowers per plant (38.3-46.8 - L
   purpureum, 30.4-59.9 - L. album). Most flowers bloom ill the morning
   hours. Thee diurnal dynamics of L. album blooming fluctuates slightly
   depending oil the, of the studied species is weather dependent. Drought
   seems to to daylength of the season. The flowering be a strong limiting
   factor of flower development. The mass or pollen produced in anthers is
   positively correlated with anther Size. Anthers of Lamium album produced
   from 3.5 mg, to 7.15 mg, of pollen per 100 anthers. Smaller sized L.
   purpureum only 0.45-1.18 mg per 100 anthers. Pollen grains of the Lamium
   studied, are trizonocolpate, medium and prolatum (P/E = 1.17). The
   little and abundance of blooming as well as the amount of delivered
   pollen indicate that file studied species are attractive as a

Abstract = {{The objective Of the Study was to assess the flying activity of the
   buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris L.) on greenhouse-grown
   tomatoes.
   The field study was performed in a greenhouse which was 1 ha in area.
   Inside the greenhouse the tomatoes were being grown. The bumblebees
   working in the greenhouse were purchased in Belgium, Holland, Italy and
   Great Britain. Bumblebee flight intensity was evaluated from March to
   August, 2006, from 7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. Bumblebees flying out of the
   hives were Counted for 15 min. The results were converted to counts per
   1 h. Pollination effectiveness was Measured bashed on 10 tomato shoots
   picked at random.
   The optimum ambient temperature for the foraging flights of 11-42
   bumblebees per 1 h, averaged from 19.6 to 24 degrees C. The lowest
   flying activities were recorded at greenhouse indoor temperatures below
   19.6 degrees C and above 24 degrees C. The work of the bumblebees in the
   greenhouse was affected by ambient temperatures ranging from 2 to 24
   degrees C. The optimum light intensity was 19,6 klx (kilo-lux). Too low
   or too high light intensity decreased the activity of the bumblebees.
   The highest visitation rates by the bumblebees were recorded from
   7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. This was a rate of from 10 to 22 bumblebees per I
   h. The data on the pollination efficacy of the tomato crop show that
   each flower on a shoot was pollinated and developed into a Fruit.
   The Belgium bumblebees were the most active visitors averaging 17.5
   bumblebee flights per 1 h. Those from Holland averaged 13 fights per 1
   h. Those from Great Britain, 12. The least active were the Italian
   bumblebees with 9.5 flights per 1 h.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are mostly active during the daytime, but nocturnality has been
   reported in some bee families. We studied temporal flight activity in
   three species of carpenter bees (genus Xylocopa) in relation to light
   intensities. X. leucothorax is diurnal, X. tenuiscapa is largely diurnal
   being only occasionally crepuscular, while X. tranquebarica is truly
   nocturnal. Occasional forays into dim light by X. tenuiscapa are likely
   to be due to the availability of richly rewarding Heterophragma
   quadriloculare (Bignoniaceae) flowers, which open at night. X.
   tranquebarica can fly even during the moonless parts of nights when
   light intensities were lower than 10(-5) cd m(-2) , which makes this
   species the only truly nocturnal bee known so far. Other known dim-light
   species fly during crepuscular or moonlit periods. We compare eye and
   body sizes with other known diurnal and dim-light bees. We conclude that
   while extremely large ocellar diameters, large eye size:body size ratio,
   large number of ommatidia and large ommatidial diameters are all
   adaptations to dim-light foraging, these alone do not sufficiently
   explain the flights of X. tranquebarica in extremely dim light. We
   hypothesise that additional adaptations must confer extreme nocturnality
   in X. tranquebarica.}},

   invasive plants, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and white and yellow sweet
   clover (Melilotus albus, M. officinalis), with those visiting seven
   concurrently blooming native plant species in mid-summer at three sites
   in Capitol Reef National Park, Utah. Overall, as many total species of
   bees visited the flowers of the three invasive plant species as visited
   the seven natives. On average, invasive species were visited by twice as
   many bee species as were natives. With a single exception, visitors of
   invasives were generalist bees, rather than specialists. Colletes
   petalostemonis, the only native legume specialist recorded, was an
   abundant forager on the flowers of both species of Melilotus,
   demonstrating that at least some specialist bees will move to invasive
   plants that are closely related to their usual hosts. Species abundant
   on the flowers of invasives tended to collect both pollen and nectar,
   suggesting that bees are using pollen of Tamarix and Melilotus to
   provision their offspring. We argue that invasives with entomophilous
   flowers are unlikely to either facilitate the reproduction of uncommon
   native plants or consistently compete with them for pollinators. Rather,
   they are likely, over time, to selectively increase the carrying
   capacity and population size of native bees, specifically generalists,
   and specialists of closely related plant species.}},

Pages = {{61-65}},

Abstract = {{Pollination systems in which the host plant provides breeding sites for
   pollinators, invariably within flowers, are usually highly specialized
   mutualisms. We found that the pollinating bee Braunsapis puangensis
   breeds within the caulinary domatia of the semi-myrmecophyte Humboldtia
   brunonis (Fabaceae), an unusual ant-plant that is polymorphic for the
   presence of domatia and harbours a diverse invertebrate fauna including
   protective and non-protective ants in its domatia. B. puangensis is the
   most common flower visitor that carries the highest proportion of H.
   brunonis pollen. This myrmecophyte is pollen limited and
   cross-pollinated by bees in the daytime. Hence, the symbiotic pollinator
   could provide a benefit to trees bearing domatia by alleviating this
   limitation. We therefore report for the first time an unspecialised
   mutualism in which a pollinator is housed in a plant structure other
   than flowers. Here, the cost to the plant is lower than for conventional
   brood-site pollination mutualisms where the pollinator develops at the
   expense of plant reproductive structures. Myrmecophytes housing resident
   pollinators are unusual, as ants are known to be enemies of pollinators,
   and housing them together may decrease the benefits that these residents
   could individually provide to the host plant.}},

Abstract = {{In animal-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers, sexual dimorphism in
   floral traits may be the consequence of pollinator-mediated selection.
   Experimental investigations of the effects of variation in flower size
   and floral display on pollinator visitation can provide insights into
   the evolution of floral dimorphism in dioecious plants.
   Here, we investigated pollinator responses to experimental arrays of
   dioecious Sagittaria latifolia in which we manipulated floral display
   and flower size. We also examined whether there were changes in
   pollinator visitation with increasing dimorphism in flower size.
   In S. latifolia, males have larger flowers and smaller floral displays
   than females. Visitation by pollinators, mainly flies and bees, was more
   frequent for male than for female inflorescences and increased with
   increasing flower size, regardless of sex. The number of insect visits
   per flower decreased with increasing floral display in males but
   remained constant in females. Greater sexual dimorphism in flower size
   increased visits to male inflorescences but had no influence on the
   number of visits to female inflorescences.
   These results suggest that larger flower sizes would be advantageous to
   both females and males, and no evidence was found that females suffer
   from increased flower-size dimorphism. Small daily floral displays may
   benefit males by allowing extended flowering periods and greater
   opportunities for effective pollen dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{The use of artificial feeders has grown as a result of people wanting to
   attract hummingbirds to their yards. This has caused an increase in the
   density, and diversity of these birds in urban and suburban habitats.
   Feeders represent a bonanza for hummingbirds but also can represent a
   decrease in the number of hummingbirds visiting native plants. In the
   present study, we document changes in diversity and abundance of
   hummingbirds inhabiting a suburban park at the south of Mexico City, and
   experimentally assessed the effect of artificial feeders on visits and
   seed production of two native plant species. Feeding activity of the
   hummingbirds increased in the transects where feeders were available for
   one year, but the number of bird species did not differ between
   transects. Visit rates to plants were reduced by the presence of
   feeders, and only for Salvia fulgens was seed production lower in the
   plants located near feeders. S. mexicana was visited by hummingbirds but
   also by native bees that were not attracted by feeders, thus possibly
   compensating for the reduction in the-hummingbird visits, and so in
   pollination efficiency. Feeders can have a positive effect, on
   hummingbirds but can have an indirect one reducing visits, and thus
   pollination of native plants. However, the increase in hummingbird
   abundances can produce a compensatory effect that neutralizes the
   negative effect over the plants.}},

   the alternative arrangement that was most commonly found in resampling.
   Relationships among subgenera for Chilicola are weakly supported. By
   contrast, when three previously synonymized subgenera (Stenoediscelis,
   Heteroediscelis and Oediscelisca) are resurrected, there is good support
   for all subgenera (GC >= 99), except two: a paraphyletic Oediscelis and
   a polyphyletic Anoediscelis. Both of these subgenera became monophyletic
   following successive approximations character weighting. Four
   distinctive new subgenera are described: Unicarinicola Packer subgen.n.,
   Obesicola Packer subgen.n., Capitatiscopa Packer subgen.n. and
   Toroediscelis Packer subgen.n., and a revised key to the subgenera of
   Chilicola is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services are natural processes that benefit humans. Birds
   contribute the four types of services recognized by the UN Millennium
   Ecosystem Assessment-provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting
   services. In this review, we concentrate primarily on supporting
   services, and to a lesser extent, provisioning and regulating services.
   As members of ecosystems, birds play many roles, including as predators,
   pollinators, scavengers, seed dispersers, seed predators, and ecosystem
   engineers. These ecosystem services fall into two subcategories: those
   that arise via behavior (like consumption of agricultural pests) and
   those that arise via bird products (like nests and guano).
   Characteristics of most birds make them quite special from the
   perspective of ecosystem services. Because most birds fly, they can
   respond to irruptive or pulsed resources in ways generally not possible
   for other vertebrates. Migratory species link ecosystem processes and
   fluxes that are separated by great distances and times. Although the
   economic value to humans contributed by most, if not all, of the
   supporting services has yet to be quantified, we believe they are
   important to humans. Our goals for this review are 1) to lay the
   groundwork on these services to facilitate future efforts to estimate
   their economic value, 2) to highlight gaps in our knowledge, and 3) to
   point to future directions for additional research.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanistic models of animal signals posit the occurrence of biases on
   the part of receivers that could be potentially exploited by signallers.
   Such biases are most obvious when animals are confronted with
   exaggerated versions of signals they normally encounter. Signalling
   systems operating in plant - pollinator interactions are among the most
   highly coevolved, with plants using a variety of floral signals to
   attract pollinators. A number of observations suggest that pollinators
   preferentially visit larger floral displays although the benefit of this
   to either the plant or the pollinator is not always clear. We use a
   standard dual-choice experimental protocol to show that honeybees
   display a receiver bias for exaggerated size and colour contrast two
   important components of floral signals even when such signals do not
   indicate quality. We discuss the implications of this receiver bias for
   the evolution of floral displays and its possible exploitation by
   invading alien plants.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble-bee declines across Europe have been linked to loss of habitat

   declines may have severe ecological and commercial consequences since
   bumble-bees pollinate a range of wildflowers and crops. In England,
   attempts are being made to reintroduce forage resources through
   agri-environment schemes, yet there are few data on how the area of
   forage, or the landscape context in which it is provided, affects their
   success. We investigated the effects of sown forage patches on
   bumble-bees across sites varying in landscape characteristics.
   Bumble-bee densities were higher on sown patches compared with control
   habitats but did not vary with patch size, i.e. total forager numbers
   were proportional to patch area. Importantly, the relative response to
   sown forage patches varied widely across a landscape gradient such that
   their impact in terms of attracting foraging bumble-bees was greatest
   where the proportion of arable land was highest.}},

Abstract = {{Andrena humilis is an endangered oligolectic solitary bee and has
   declined in recent decades throughout western Europe. The aim of this
   study was to explore the pollen harvesting pattern and to determine the
   reproductive rate in specialized andrenid bees. We measured the amount
   of pollen required to produce one brood-cell, the pollen harvesting rate
   and compared our results with data for other specialized andrenid bee
   species. Pollen-foraging trips were registered and the activity events
   (entering, leaving or digging) recorded at the nests. The mean number of
   pollen-foraging trips per day was 5.3 and an average bee nest was active
   (and open) 88 min day(-1). The bees were highly efficient in harvesting
   pollen and spent on average 10.7 min to complete one pollen-foraging
   trip. Most pollen-foraging trips (77\%) were completed in less than 15
   min. The duration of pollen-foraging trips increased over the day,
   presumably because pollen became more costly to harvest. Based on pollen
   counts (pollen loads on bees and pollen provisions) an average bee
   required 3.85 foraging trips to complete one brood cell and one bee
   managed to accomplish 1.37 brood cells in one day with suitable weather.
   In the literature we found data on an additional 19 specialized andrenid
   bee species. Andrena humilis seems to be extremely efficient compared
   with most other species, with an average trip for pollen lasting almost
   one hour (average for andrenid bees = 46 min). An extremely low
   reproductive rate seems to be a common trait among specialized bees in
   the family Andrenidae with an average 0.9 offspring produced per day and
   less than ten offspring produced during the whole lifetime. The high
   degree of specialisation and the low reproductive rate among andrenid
   bees can explain the severe decline in many species today.}},

Abstract = {{Two woody Hypericum species (H. roeparianum and H. revolutum) often
   coexist in forest edge and stream mantle communities in the
   Bamenda-Banoso Highlands, Cameroon. Morphologically nonspecialized
   flowers of both species are visited by specific eye-catching visitors.
   Nectarless flowers of H. roeparianum are visited by a large carpenter
   bee Xylocopa sp. (Hymenoptera) and nectar-producing flowers of H.
   revolutum are the main source of nectar for sunbirds (Cyanomitra oritis,
   Cinnyris reichenowi and C. bouvieri). Using a manipulative experiment,
   we showed that the carpenter bee plays an important role in the
   reproduction success of H. roeparianum, whereas sunbirds affect seed
   production of H. revolutum only little. We suggest that a clear
   differentiation of pollination niches enables the coexistence of both
   Hypericum species. The study showed that the pollination system of H.
   roeparianum with morphologically nonspecialized flowers can be
   ecologically specialized. Sunbirds are not decisive for the reproductive
   success of H. revolutum and thus have only little selection pressure on
   its floral traits. The results indicate the importance of reproduction
   success assessment in pollination studies.}},

   Implications of pollen limitation and plant mating system}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1935-1943}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of species interactions is often difficult to predict,
   depending on the organisms involved and the ecological context. Nectar
   robbers remove nectar from flowers, often without providing pollination
   service, and their effects on plant reproduction vary in strength and
   direction. In two case studies and a meta-analysis, we tested the
   importance of pollen limitation and plant mating system in predicting
   the impacts of nectar robbing on female plant reproduction. We predicted
   that nectar robbing would have the strongest effects on species
   requiring pollinators to set seed and pollen limited for seed
   production. Our predictions were partially supported. In the first
   study, natural nectar robbing was associated with lower seed production
   in Delphinium nuttullianum, a self-compatible but non-autogamously
   selfing, pollen-limited perennial, and experimental nectar robbing
   reduced seed set relative to unrobbed plants. The second study involved
   Linaria vulgaris, a self-incompatible perennial that is generally not
   pollen limited. Natural levels of nectar robbing generally had little
   effect on estimates of female reproduction in L. vulgaris, while

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that the presence of a reward on average
   doubles reproductive success in orchids by correspondingly increasing
   the frequency of pollinator visitations. We examined whether such
   reward-induced increases have a downstream effect on the behaviour of
   ambush predators concealed in orchid inflorescences, extending
   observations begun at Downe by Charles Darwin. Specifically, we studied
   three orchid-rich sites in southern England, in order to compare the
   occurrence of crab spiders on three coexisting species of terrestrial
   orchids: the nectariferous Gymnadenia conopsea versus the nectar-less
   Dactylorhiza fuchsii and Anacamptis pyramidalis. No significant
   difference was observed between rewarding and non-rewarding
   inflorescences at Risborough, whereas at Aston Clinton the nectar-less
   species supported significantly more crab spiders, albeit mainly in
   relatively short grass. Comparison of the two non-rewarding species
   present at Downe approximated a significant preference by the spiders
   for Anacamptis, which more closely resembles the rewarding Gymnadenia.
   The presence of a floral reward does not result in a higher frequency of
   crab spiders. We speculate that concealment quality of the
   inflorescence, the nature of the dominant pollinator(s), and/or ease of
   movement of spiders between inflorescences may be more important than
   frequency of visits by potential prey, particularly when no other form
   of concealment is readily available. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{We describe the geographical variation of corolla and nectar guide size
   in seven populations of Mimulus luteus (Phrymaceae) in central Chile,
   and examine whether flower phenotypes associate with taxonomic
   composition and flower visit patterns of pollinators across populations.
   Flowers showed higher variation in nectar guide size than corolla size.
   Mean corolla size increased with the proportion of bees and decreased
   with the proportion of lepidopterans in the pollinator assemblages.
   Nectar guide size increased with the proportion of hummingbirds in the
   pollinator assemblages. When the frequency of flower visits rather than
   taxonomic composition was considered, the results revealed similar
   patterns. Because these traits previously have been described as targets
   of bee- and hummingbird-mediated selection in M. luteus, our results
   have implications for understanding the processes that determine flower
   diversification in Chilean Mimulus. Although we cannot rule out
   ecological sorting as an explanation for the geographical association
   between pollinators and flower phenotypes, changes in the prevalence and
   importance of bees and hummingbirds across populations appear to
   account, at least in part, for the flower phenotypic variation across
   populations. The extent to which insect and hummingbird pollination in
   M. luteus produces pollinator-mediated divergence among populations
   needs to be examined in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Can the reproductive benefits gained by mitigating the costs
   of self-pollination drive the evolution of nectarless flowers?
   Features of model: Complementary analytical and simulation models
   determined the optimal proportion of nectarless flowers ('nectar
   phenotype') to maximize male reproductive success. Models considered a
   range of self-pollination costs and pollinator abundances. In the
   analytical model, equal numbers of each nectar phenotype were present.
   Pollinators used simple rules of behaviour, related to their current
   host plant's perceived nectar status, to decide whether to stay on that
   plant or to move to a new plant. In the simulation model, pollinators
   used more sophisticated departure rules, comparing the current host
   plant's perceived nectar status to the population mean. Plants with
   different proportions of nectarless flowers competed for successful
   pollination over multiple seasons.
   Ranges of key variables: Relative cost of self-pollination (0.5-1);
   number of pollinators acting on a plant population per season (1-101);
   and proportion of nectarless flowers per plant (0-1).
   Conclusions: Enhanced pollination success can drive the evolution of
   empty flowers in plants that are reliant on vector-mediated pollination.
   When the costs of selfing are low, an inflorescence with a low
   proportion of nectarless flowers is optimal, because pollination success
   is primarily determined by pollen removal. When the costs of selfing are
   high, an inflorescence with mostly nectarless flowers is optimal,
   because pollination success is primarily determined by outcrossing. Low
   pollinator abundances lead to a decreased optimal proportion of empty
   flowers to mitigate pollinator limitation.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this experiment was 1) to quantify drift between
   bumblebee, Bombus terrestris L., colonies when hives are vertically
   stacked; and 2) to measure the impact of drift on the colony growth. The
   experiment was conducted outside, in an open area, at three sites with
   one stack of three colonies per site. Observations were made from the
   28th to the 58th d of the colony development, before the competition
   point. Bumblebees were regularly marked with a colony-specific color to
   access the migrations and the cumulative births in colonies. The
   population size and the colony composition were analyzed by dissection
   at the end of the experiment. The results showed that approximate to
   50\% of the individuals observed at a hive entrance (entering and
   exiting individuals) were foreigners. The cumulative births became
   significantly lower on the lowest floor after one week of experiment. At
   the end of the experiment, colonies were composed of 20.58\% drifters
   (resident since at least 1 d), and a mean migration rate of 19.82\% was
   determined. Globally, the lowest floor seemed to be progressively
   abandoned by resident workers for the benefit of the other floors.
   Because drift induces modifications of the colony growth (potentially on
   the number of foragers produced and likely on pollination), we suggest
   to greenhouse growers not to stack colonies but to distribute them
   throughout the greenhouse.}},

Abstract = {{Forest loss has been invoked as a cause for changes in the reproductive
   success of animal-pollinated woodland plants, associated with changes in
   their pollinators. To analyze such effects, it is important to include
   all of the three key players: landscapes, pollinators and a plant. We
   investigated effects of forest loss on an insect-pollinated plant
   through landscapes in forested ecosystems to pollinator communities and
   plant populations. Then we questioned if abundance and species richness
   in pollinator communities decrease as forest loss increases, and this in
   turn leads to a decrease in reproductive output of an insect-pollinated
   plant. We made a study with 12 populations of the bee pollinated herb,
   Erythronium americanum, in a landscape characterized by scattered
   fragments of deciduous forest within intensively managed agricultural
   fields. We also sampled bees as the potential pollinators by pan traps.
   We quantified the study landscapes using the amount of forest cover and
   the length of forest edge within each of the six radii (250, 500, 750,
   1,000, 1,250 and 1,500 m). Regression analyses showed that the abundance
   and species richness of all collected bees were positively related to
   only the forest cover at the radius of 750 m. We also found the positive
   relationships for the seed set of E. americanum when the forest cover at
   the same radius and abundance of all collected bees were used as the
   predictor variables. These results indicate that forest loss causes
   negative impacts on potential pollinator communities and seed sets of
   some woodland herbs.}},

Abstract = {{For plants that rely on animals for pollination, the ability to attract
   the animals to their flowers can be a crucial component of fitness. A
   large number of studies have documented pollinators to be important
   selective agents driving the evolution of flower size and correlated
   traits on a large scale. In this paper, we studied variations of
   reproductive traits in self-incompatible Trollius ranunculoides
   (Ranunculaceae) among local habitats at Alpine Meadow. The results
   showed significant variations of floral size, seed mass per fruit and
   sex allocation (male/female mass ratio) between different habitats,
   where floral size and seed mass was not explained fully by variation of
   plant size among habitats. It suggested that other factors unrelated to
   plant size might also influence floral variation. However, in our
   manipulated experiment, it showed no effects of manipulated floral size
   not only on visit rate of effective pollinators (bees and flies) but
   also on female success (seed set, seed mass per fruit), irrespective of
   flower density. Consequently, we could not conclude that the variation
   of floral size in T. ranunculoides was due to phenotypic plasticity, or
   natural selection. But if selection occurred, it should not be mediated
   by pollinators. It was likely that variation of sex allocation between
   habitats lead to changes of flower or corolla size, because plant
   invested much less to male function (female-biased sex allocation and
   larger single seed mass) in shade habitat (bottom of bush) than other
   exposed habitats, to gain higher fitness. In addition, high-floral
   density in T. ranunculoides had a negative effect on service of main
   pollinator (bees) and female success. This situation would influence the
   strength of selection on floral size.}},

Title = {{Evolution of pollinator generalization in bumblebee-pollinated plants}},

Abstract = {{To understand the relationships between floral morphologies and the
   reproductive strategies of plants, the contributions of multiple
   pollinators to plant reproductive success need to be examined. To
   outline recent advances on this topic, we review studies of five
   bumblebee-pollinated plants in Japan. These plant species are pollinated
   by one to three bumblebee species differing in proboscis length: Bombus
   consobrinus, Bombus diversus and Bombus honshuensis. These pollination
   systems allow us to compare the reproductive strategies of plants
   pollinated by single and multiple bumblebee species. First, we address
   the effects of morphological correspondence between flowers and
   pollinators on the reproductive success of plants. In plants with narrow
   tubular flowers, Isodon umbrosus and Clematis stans, pollination
   effectiveness depended on the morphological correspondence between
   floral tube length and pollinator mouthparts. These flowers are subject
   to varied directions and intensities of selection by multiple bumblebee
   species, resulting in the maintenance of large variation in floral
   morphology within and between populations, and even within individuals.
   In contrast, pollination effectiveness in plants having flowers with a
   wide entrance, Melampyrum roseum and Hosta sieboldiana, did not differ
   among bumblebee species because of good correspondence between floral
   morphology and bumblebee body size, resulting in small morphological
   variations among flowers. Thus, generalized pollination systems with
   multiple pollinator species favor floral traits that enable the use of
   various pollinators. Second, we address the quantity and quality of the
   pollination service in bumblebee-pollinated plants. Isodon umbrosus,
   with its generalized pollination system, suffered from pollen limitation
   because of low pollination quality. In contrast, Isodon effusus, which
   has a specialized pollination system, suffered from pollen limitation
   because of low pollination quantity. Isodon umbrosus produced large
   numbers of short tubular flowers to improve pollination quantity,
   whereas I. effusus produced small numbers of long tubular flowers to
   improve pollination quality, resulting in a clear trade-off between the
   size and number of flowers within plants. In M. roseum, which has a
   generalized pollination system, three bumblebee species achieved
   sufficient pollination, but seed production was limited by an increased
   rate of self-pollination. This is because this species invests more
   resources in cross-pollinated seeds by selective abortion of selfed
   seeds. Our results demonstrate that the strategy of generalized plants
   is to improve pollination quantity, whereas the strategy of specialized
   plants is to improve pollination quality.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator visitation patterns are strongly affected by the spatial
   structure of a plant population. We assessed the effects of the size and
   spacing of patches on the foraging behavior of queens of Bombus diversus
   tersatus on a heterostylous perennial species, Primula sieboldii, using
   an experimental population. We compared Akaike's information criterion
   (AIC) among candidate statistical models, and models with patch size had
   the lowest AIC in various aspects of visitation behavior. Visitation
   frequency per patch increased with increasing patch size, but the
   proportion of visited flowers decreased. As a result of this combination
   of visitation patterns, visitation frequency per flower was only
   slightly affected by patch size. This result indicates that the
   bumblebees came close to an ideal free distribution for the use of
   resources in terms of the patch size within a population. From the
   plant's point of view, increasing the number, but decreasing the
   proportion, of flowers visited in larger patches would maximize
   reproductive success by minimizing inbreeding. Although patch size
   strongly affected visitation frequencies, patch spacing had a moderate
   effect only on the visitation frequency per patch. Visitation frequency
   per patch was higher with closer spacing between patches. No evidence
   for an interaction between patch size and spacing was detected.}},

Abstract = {{Sophronitis sincorana and S. pfisteri (Orchidaceae) are endemic to the
   campo rupestre vegetation, northeastern Brazil, occurring sympatrically
   and flowering synchronously. In this work we studied the reproductive
   biology of both species and investigated reproductive barriers between
   them. Both species are partially self-compatible, pollinator dependent,
   and are pollinated by males and worker bees of Bombus brevivillus.
   Pollinaria are deposited on the anterior portion of the mesonotum of
   these insects in S. pfisteri, and on the scutellum in S. sincorana. The
   flowers of both species are deceptive, as they have a dry cuniculus.
   Morphological differences in the labellum and the gynostemium impede
   inter-specific pollination of S. pfisteri with pollen from S. sincorana.
   Very low fruiting results from inter-specific crosses of S. sincorana
   with pollen from S. pfisteri. Although viable seeds can be produced from
   experimental inter-specific crosses, no natural hybrids were found.
   Species integrity appears to be maintained by additive unidirectional
   reproductive barriers between them.}},

Abstract = {{To a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanism between
   reproductive organs and pollinators in Viburnum, this paper reports
   reproductive characteristics of Viburnum macrocephalum f. keteleeri,
   including floral characteristics, anatomical features of reproductive
   organs, pollen viability, pollen/ovule ratio (P/O), pollinators, pollen
   tube growth path, breeding system, and fertilization. This species
   possesses a compound umbel including fertile and infertile flowers. The
   fertile flower has one pistil and five stamens; each pistil has a dry
   stigma and an ovary that contains one anatropous ovule. The stamens and
   pistils of the infertile flower are normal initially but degenerate
   later during flowering; degenerated stamens are mainly characterized by
   disappearance of stamens, short filaments, absence of filaments, or
   different size of anthers, whereas degenerated pistils have smaller or
   ruptured stigmas; occasionally, pistils and stamens become petal-like.
   Pollen viability of individual flowers declined significantly 4-5 d
   after pollen dissemination. Within population, pollen viability of all
   flowers rapidly decreased at the end of April. Pollen/ovule ratio (P/O)
   was 12800-18700. Pollinators for this species include bees, flies,
   butterflies and beetles, but bees and butterflies are the main ones.
   Artificial pollination treatments demonstrated that this species was
   self-incompatible and seed production depended on pollinator visits.
   Pollen dissemination of fertile flowers mainly occurred during 9:00
   am-4:00 pm, and the peak of pollinator visits was 11:00 am-3:00 pm.
   Pollen grains usually germinated within I h after pollination and pollen
   tubes penetrated the stigma through the papilla clearance and then
   continued to grow along the transmitting tissue in center of style. Some
   pollen tubes reached the ovary 18 h later and grew into the ovule
   through micropyle within 20 h after pollination. In addition, formation
   of sterile flowers, adaptive floral structures, low production of
   fruits, and growth characteristics of pollen tubes were discussed.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1155-1164}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background Delayed self-pollination is a mechanism that allows
   animal-pollinated plants to outcross while ensuring seed production in
   the absence of pollinators. This study aims to explore a new mechanism
   of delayed self-pollination facilitated by wind-driven corolla
   abscission in Incarvillea sinensis var. sinensis.
   Methods Floral morphology and development, and the process of delayed
   self-pollination were surveyed. Experiments dealing with pollinator and
   wind exclusion, pollination manipulations, and pollinator observations
   were conducted in the field.
   Key Results Delayed self-pollination occurs when the abscising corolla
   driven by wind drags the adherent epipetalous stamens, thus leading to
   contact of anthers with stigma in late anthesis. There is no dichogamy
   and self-incompatibility in this species. The significantly higher
   proportion of abscised corolla under natural conditions as compared with
   that in wind-excluding tents indicates the importance of wind in corolla
   abscission. When pollinators were excluded, corolla abscission
   significantly increased the number of pollen grains deposited on the
   stigma and, as a result, the fruit and seed set. Only half of the
   flowers in plots were visited by pollinators, and the fruit set of
   emasculated flowers was significantly lower than that of untreated
   flowers in open pollination. This species has a sensitive stigma, and
   its two open stigmatic lobes closed soon after being touched by a
   pollinator, but always reopened if no or only little pollen was
   deposited.
   Conclusions This delayed self-pollination, which involved the movement
   of floral parts, the active participation of the wind and sensitive
   stigma, is quite different from that reported previously. This mechanism
   provides reproductive assurance for this species. The sensitive stigma
   contributes to ensuring seed production and reducing the interference of
   selfing with outcrossing. The pollination pattern, which combines
   actions by bees with indirect participation by wind, is also a new
   addition to ambophily.}},

Abstract = {{Many greenhouse crops depend on bees for pollination. Global declines of

   We evaluated the carpenter bee X. pubescens, a local species to Israel,
   as a pollinator of greenhouse-grown honeydew melons, in comparison to
   honeybees. We recorded the bees' daily and seasonal activity patterns in
   relation to floral nectar levels, frequencies and durations of flower
   visits, and fruit quantity and quality. The bees' daily foraging
   schedule on melon did not correlate with nectar yield and nectar
   production patterns by the flowers. Visit durations per flower were
   shorter for X. pubescens than for honeybees. Pollination by both bees
   resulted in similar fruit mass and seed numbers, but X. pubescens
   pollination increased fruit set threefold as compared to honeybee
   pollination. We conclude that X. pubescens can effectively pollinate
   melons in enclosures.}},

Abstract = {{Complete dichogamy occurs when temporal separation prevents any overlap
   in male and female function within and among flowers of one or more
   inflorescences. Although dichogamy may increase outcrossing and prevent
   inbreeding, it also results in the presentation of inflorescences with
   different floral resources. Pollinators may prefer one gender over the
   other based on these differences, which can reduce the transfer of
   pollen to conspecific stigmas and reduce floral resources for effective
   pollinators. We investigated whether the insect visitors of Trachymene
   incisa (Apiaceae), an Australian herb demonstrating complete protandry
   at the umbel level, show a preference for male or female umbels. The
   male phase umbels present pollen and nectar, whereas the female phase
   umbels offer nectar only. Therefore, we expect pollen-collecting insects
   to favour male umbels, whereas insects that forage only for nectar will
   favour female umbels. In natural patches that exhibited a male umbel
   bias, insects showed a preference for male phase umbels at Agnes Banks
   in 2003 and at Myall Lakes in both 2003 and 2004. By contrast, insects
   showed no preference for umbel phases, visiting umbels at a similar
   frequency to which they occurred, at Agnes Banks in 2004 and at Tomago
   in both 2003 and 2004. This suggests spatial and temporal variation in
   insect preferences for umbel phases that differ in floral rewards. In
   experimental arrays where the umbel gender ratio was equal, there were
   no significant differences between male and female umbels in terms of
   insect visitation during a foraging trip and mean foraging time per
   visit. The differing patterns of preference may be due to a differential
   response by insects when the umbel ratios vary, where a male bias in
   umbel genders leads to a preference for male umbels, whereas an equal
   umbel gender ratio leads to equal visitation to male and female phase
   umbels.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of an exotic species will affect its ability to
   become naturalized and invasive in non-native habitats. Rhododendron
   ponticum is an ecologically damaging exotic weed in the British Isles,
   which spreads predominantly by seed. I investigated how inbreeding and
   outcrossing affect seed production and germination in a wild population
   of this species in Ireland. Experimental manipulations revealed low
   fruit and seed set when insects were excluded from flowers, suggesting
   that this species has limited capability for spontaneous autogamy.
   Hand-pollination treatments showed that, although flowers are
   self-compatible (with self and same plant pollen), higher levels of seed
   set occur following outcrossing (xenogamy). There was no significant
   difference in rate of germination of seeds from inbred or outcrossed
   treatments. The addition of xenogamous pollen to open flowers did not
   increase fruit or seed set, suggesting that flowers in this population
   are not pollen limited: native generalist pollinators, mainly bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.), are providing an adequate pollinator service. This work
   demonstrates that outcrossing increases seed set and pollinators are
   required to facilitate this. Hence, generalist native pollinators can
   promote invasion by exotic plants. Native pollinators can clearly play
   an important part in alien species invasion. (C) 2007 The Linnean

Abstract = {{Silks are strong protein fibers produced by a broad array of spiders and
   insects. The vast majority of known silks are large, repetitive proteins
   assembled into extended beta-sheet structures. Honeybees, however, have
   found a radically different evolutionary solution to the need for a
   building material. The 4 fibrous proteins of honeybee silk are small
   (similar to 30 kDa each) and nonrepetitive and adopt a coiled coil
   structure. We examined silks from the 3 superfamilies of the Aculeata
   (Hymenoptera: Apocrita) by infrared spectroscopy and found coiled coil
   structure in bees (Apoidea) and in ants (Vespoidea) but not in parasitic
   wasps of the Chrysidoidea. We subsequently identified and sequenced the
   silk genes of bumblebees, bulldog ants, and weaver ants and compared
   these with honeybee silk genes. Each species produced orthologues of the
   4 small fibroin proteins identified in honeybee silk. Each fibroin
   contained a continuous predicted coiled coil region of around 210
   residues, flanked by 23-160 residue length N- and C-termini. The cores
   of the coiled coils were unusually rich in alanine. There was extensive
   sequence divergence among the bee and ant silk genes (< 50\% similarity
   between the alignable regions of bee and ant sequences), consistent with
   constant and equivalent divergence since the bee/ant split (estimated to
   be 155 Myr). Despite a high background level of sequence diversity, we
   have identified conserved design elements that we propose are essential
   to the assembly and function of coiled coil silks.}},

Abstract = {{Floral color change has been recognized as a pollination strategy, but
   its relative effectiveness has been evaluated insufficiently with
   respect to other floral traits. In this study, effects of floral color
   change on the visitation pattern of bumblebees were empirically assessed
   using artificial flowers. Four inflorescence types were postulated as
   strategies of flowering behavior: type 1 has no retention of old
   flowers, resulting in a small display size; type 2 retains old flowers
   without nectar production; type 3 retains old flowers with nectar; and
   type 4 retains color-changed old flowers without nectar. Effects of
   these treatments varied depending on both the total display size (single
   versus multiple inflorescences) and the pattern of flower-opening. In
   the single inflorescence experiment, a large floral display due to the
   retention of old flowers (types 2-4) enhanced pollinator attraction, and
   the number of flower visits per stay decreased with color change (type
   4), suggesting a decrease in geitonogamous pollination. Type-4 plants
   also reduced the foraging time of bees in comparison with type-2 plants.
   In the multiple inflorescence experiment, the retention of old flowers
   did not contribute to pollinator attraction. When flowering occurred
   sequentially within inflorescences, type-4 plants successfully decreased
   the number of visits and the foraging time in comparison with type-2
   plants. In contrast, floral color change did not influence the number of
   visits, and it extended the foraging time when flowering occurred
   simultaneously within inflorescences but the opening of inflorescences
   progressed sequentially within a plant. Therefore, the effectiveness of
   floral color change is highly susceptible to the display size and
   flowering pattern within plants, and this may limit the versatility of
   the color change strategy in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies of plant-pollinator interactions in fragmented landscapes
   evaluate the consequences of floral visitor variation on multiple stages
   of plant reproduction. Given that fragmentation potentially has positive
   or negative effects on different organisms, and that self-incompatible
   plant species depend on pollinators for sexual reproduction, differences
   in floral visitor assemblages may affect certain plant reproductive
   stages. We evaluated how pollinator assemblage, availability of floral
   resources, pollination, reproductive output, and seed and seedling
   performance of Psychotria suterella Muell. Arg. varied among three
   fragmentation categories: non-fragmented habitats, fragments connected
   by corridors, and isolated fragments. Richness and frequency of floral
   visitors were greater in fragments than in non-fragmented sites,
   resulting mainly from the addition of species typically found in
   disturbed areas. Although 24 species visited Psychotria suterella
   flowers, bumblebees were considered the most important pollinators,
   because they showed the highest frequency of visits and were present in
   eight out of ten sites. Additionally, the number of pollen tubes per
   flower per visit was lower in areas without bumblebees. The increased
   visitation in fragments seemed to enhance pollination slightly. However,
   fruit and seed output, germination, and seed and seedling mass were
   similar in non-fragmented sites, connected sites, and isolated
   fragments. Our results suggested that, even for a self-incompatible
   species, responses to habitat fragmentation at different stages of plant
   reproduction might be decoupled from the responses observed in floral
   visitors, if fruit set is not pollen limited. If all reproductive stages
   were considered, variation on the small scale was more important than
   the variation explained by fragmentation category. In spite of its
   self-incompatible breeding system, this plant-pollinator system showed
   resilience to habitat fragmentation, mainly as a result of high
   availability of potential mates to P. suterella individuals, absence of
   pollen limitation, and the presence of bumblebees (Bombus spp.)
   throughout this highly connected landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The floral biology and pollination process of Glechoma longituba (Nakai)
   Kuprian, a clonal gynodioecious, perennial herb that is widely
   distributed in China was investigated in natural populations. During
   visits to the flowers of G. longituba, the carpenter bee-Xylocopa
   sinensis mainly displayed nectar-robbing behavior with minimal
   pollination. Nectar robbing behavior began at the onset of flowering and
   continued for about 3 weeks ending at about the middle of the flowering
   period. A total of 18.6\% floral visits in this period were by nectar
   robbers, with about 90\% of the flowers in the study populations being
   subjected to two or two nectar-robbing episodes. During controlled
   experiments, lower pollination efficiency was recorded for X. sinensis
   compared to legitimate pollinators. Pollination by the robber-like
   pollinator X. sinensis during the early-mid phase of the flowering
   season yielded seeds of 16.16\%. Although nectar robbing by the
   carpenter bee seemed to have a slight enhancing effect on seed set in G.
   longituba, this effect was effectively masked by the more pronounced
   detrimental effect of nectar robbing. Experiments indicated that nectar
   robbing by the carpenter bee reduced seed production by more than 26\%,
   largely owing to the consequent shortening of the life span of robbed
   flowers. Furthermore, 10.43\% of the ovules and 13.04\% of the nectaries
   in the robbed flowers were damaged, thus causing a decrease or entire
   loss of reproductive opportunity in the robbed flowers. In addition, a
   higher number of pollen grains remained on the androecia of robbed
   flowers indicating that nectar robbing may have a lowering effect on
   male fitness in G. longituba.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding system and flower visitors of the endangered
   plant, Penstemon haydenii, at several south-central Wyoming, USA
   occurrences. In agreement with earlier studies of the species 300 km to
   the east in Nebraska, we found Wyoming plants to be self-incompatible
   and pollinator-dependent for sexual reproduction. Flower visitors were
   several species of native bees in the families Apidae (particularly
   bumblebees), Halictidae (small sweat bees), and Megachilidae (especially
   in the genus Osmia); and the masarid wasp Pseudomasaris vespoides.
   Especially important was Osmia brevis, an abundant megachilid bee, and
   one of only two species (the sweat bee Lasioglossum (Dialictus)
   pruinosum was the other) present at all five sites. As in Nebraska,
   fruit set did not differ between our experimental cross-pollination
   treatment and an open-pollinated control. However, unlike Nebraska,
   open-pollinated treatments in Wyoming produced significantly fewer seeds
   per fruit than the experimental out-crossing treatment. We discuss
   several possible explanations for seed limitation: (1) a scarcity of
   pollinators early in the flowering season; (2) resource competition for
   developing ovules on open-pollinated inflorescences but not on
   experimental inflorescences; (3) the deposition of self pollen through
   intra-inflorescence and intra-genet pollinator movements; (4) few
   S-alleles and mating types in the Wyoming metapopulation compared to the
   Nebraska metapopulation, from which it likely derives.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging pollinators could visit hundreds of flowers in succession on
   mass-flowering plants, yet they often visit only a small
   number-potentially saving the plant from much self-pollination among its
   own flowers (geitonogamy). This study tests the hypothesis that
   bumble-bee (Bombus impatiens) residence on a particular plant depends on
   an assessment of that plant's reward value relative to the overall
   quality experienced in the habitat. In a controlled environment, naive
   bees were given experience in a particular habitat (all plants having
   equal nectar quality or number of rewarding flowers), and we tested
   whether they learn about and adaptively exploit a new habitat type.
   Bees' residence on a plant (number of flowers probed per visit) was
   eventually invariant to a doubling of absolute nectar quality and
   increased only slightly with a doubling of absolute flower number in the
   habitat. These results help to explain why pollinators are quick to
   leave highly rewarding plants and suggest that the fitness of rewarding
   plant traits will often be frequency dependent. One implication is that
   geitonogamy may be a less significant constraint on the evolution of
   rewarding traits than generally supposed.}},

   digitalis in patches of four to 41 flowering individuals. Seed set per

   increases, (2) visit greater proportions of plants as patch size
   increases. and (3) visit smaller proportions of flowers per visited
   plant as patch size increases. Our results suggest that economics of
   flight and maneuverability of large, long-tongued bumblebees lead them
   to transfer more pollen between than within Penstemon plants in large
   patches. Density of smaller, short-tongued bumblebees was not positively

Abstract = {{Biologists have long assumed that pollinator behavior is an important
   force in angiosperm speciation, yet there is surprisingly little direct
   evidence that floral preferences in pollinators can drive floral
   divergence and the evolution of reproductive (ethological) isolation
   between incipient plant species. In this study, we expose
   computer-generated plant populations with a wide variation in flower
   color to selection by live and virtual hummingbirds and bumblebees and
   track evolutionary changes in flower color over multiple generations.
   Flower color, which was derived from the known genetic architecture and
   phenotypic variance of naturally occurring plant species pollinated by
   both groups, evolved in simulations through a genetic algorithm in which
   pollinator preference determined changes in flower color between
   generations. The observed preferences of live hummingbirds and
   bumblebees were strong enough to cause adaptive divergence in flower
   color between plant populations but did not lead to ethological
   isolation. However, stronger preferences assigned to virtual pollinators
   in sympatric and allopatric scenarios rapidly produced ethological
   isolation. Pollinators can thus drive ecological speciation in flowering
   plants, but more rigorous and comprehensive behavioral studies are
   required to specify conditions that produce sufficient preference levels

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{100}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims A comparative investigation was made of floral scent
   variation in the closely related, food-rewarding Anacamptis coriophora
   and the food-deceptive Anacamptis morio in order to identify patterns of
   variability of odour compounds in the two species and their role in
   pollinator attraction/avoidance learning.
   Methods Scent was collected from plants in natural populations and
   samples were analysed via quantitative gas chromatography and mass
   spectrometry. Combined gas chromatography and electroantennographic
   detection was used to identify compounds that are detected by the
   pollinators. Experimental reduction of scent variability was performed
   in the field with plots of A. morio plants supplemented with a uniform
   amount of anisaldehyde.
   Key Results Both orchid species emitted complex odour bouquets. In A.
   coriophora the two main benzenoid compounds, hydroquinone dimethyl ether
   (1,4-dimethoxybenzene) and anisaldehyde (methoxybenzaldehyde), triggered
   electrophysiological responses in olfactory neurons of honey-bee and
   bumble-bee workers. The scent of A. morio, however, was too weak to
   elicit any electrophysiological responses. The overall variation in
   scent was significantly lower in the rewarding A. coriophora than in the
   deceptive A. morio, suggesting pollinator avoidance-learning selecting
   for high variation in the deceptive species. A. morio flowers
   supplemented with non-variable scent in plot experiments, however, did
   not show significantly reduced pollination success.
   Conclusions Whereas in the rewarding A. coriophora stabilizing selection
   imposed by floral constancy of the pollinators may reduce scent
   variability, in the deceptive A. morio the emitted scent seems to be too
   weak to be detected by pollinators and thus its high variability may
   result from relaxed selection on this floral trait.}},

Abstract = {{Capitol Reef National Park in central Utah, USA surrounds 22 managed
   fruit orchards started over a century ago by Mormon pioneers. Honey bees
   are imported for pollination, although the area in which the Park is
   embedded has over 700 species of native bees, many of which are
   potential orchard pollinators. We studied the visitation of native bees
   to apple, pear, apricot, and sweet cherry over 2 years. Thirty species
   of bees visited the flowers but, except for pear flowers, most were
   uncommon compared to honey bees. Evidence that honey bees prevented
   native bees from foraging on orchard crop flowers was equivocal:
   generally, honey bee and native bee visitation rates to the flowers were
   not negatively correlated, nor were native bee visitation rates
   positively correlated with distance of orchards from honey bee hives.
   Conversely, competition was tentatively suggested by much larger numbers
   of honey bees than natives on the flowers of apples, apricots and
   cherry; and by the large increase of native bees on pears, where honey
   bee numbers were low. At least one-third of the native bee species
   visiting the flowers are potential pollinators, including cavity-nesting
   species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, currently managed for small
   orchard pollination in the US, plus several fossorial species, including
   one rosaceous flower specialist (Andrena milwaukiensis). We suggest that
   gradual withdrawal of honey bees from the Park would help conserve
   native bee populations without decreasing orchard crop productivity, and
   would serve as a demonstration of the commercial value of native
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Plants that display many open flowers usually receive higher pollinator
   visitation rates, but it is unclear whether pollinators select plants to
   visit based on the size of floral display (apparent size) or the value
   of the floral rewards (reward size). To examine how pollinators respond
   to apparent size and reward size, we observed bumble bees foraging among
   arrays of artificial plants.
   We constructed two kinds of artificial flower: (i) rewarding flowers
   that produced nectar constantly; and (ii) unrewarding flowers that
   produced only water. Thus, we could construct plants that varied both in
   numbers of flowers (apparent size) and in numbers of rewarding flowers
   (reward size).
   At the beginning of the experiments, bees made more visits to the plants
   with the most flowers, irrespective of the rewards they contained.
   However, after several hours of foraging, bees returned selectively to
   plants with the greater number of rewarding flowers, irrespective of the
   number of flowers the plant presented. After we replaced rewarding
   plants with non-rewarding plants, bees continued visiting plants at
   formerly-profitable locations for a while.
   Our results demonstrate that bees initially showed preferences for
   plants with larger floral displays, but eventually bees were able to
   discriminate between rewarding and less-rewarding plants of equal
   display size by associating a plant's location with its reward size. Our
   results suggest that plants with many flowers can achieve higher
   visitation rates from pollinators in two ways: (i) by attracting
   inexperienced pollinators with large displays; and (ii) by encouraging
   experienced pollinators to return with the promise of greater rewards.}},

Abstract = {{While many plant species offer rewards (e.g. nectar) to pollinators,
   some species, particularly in orchids, do not provide rewards.
   Ecological factors, such as interactions with rewarding co-flowering
   species may affect pollinator visitation rates to such deceptive species
   by influencing pollinator ability to learn to avoid deceptive plants
   (avoidance learning).
   We tested the effect of flower colour similarity (similar vs dissimilar)
   and fine-scale spatial mingling (monospecific vs heterospecific patches)
   of rewarding and deceptive artificial plants on pollinator visitation in
   a fully crossed design. We also examined the effect of these factors on
   learning of initially naive bumblebees.
   Over time, bumblebees increasingly avoided the deceptive plants, but at
   a significantly faster rate when deceptive and rewarding plants had
   dissimilar flower colours than when they were similar.
   Deceptive plants received more visits when mingled in heterospecific
   patches with rewarding plants of similar flower colour than when mingled
   with dissimilar ones. This difference was not significant when rewarding
   and deceptive plants were spatially separated in monospecific patches.
   In conclusion, both spatial mingling and flower colour similarity
   affected pollinator visitation to and avoidance learning of deceptive
   plants. This proves the validity of artificial experimental systems to
   study the isolated and joint effect of plant traits, and ecological
   factors that are crucial for the maintenance of deceptive species in
   natural populations.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{982-987}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In generalist nectar-feeding insects such as butterflies, body size and
   proboscis length show an allometric relationship. Butterflies that
   deviate from this relationship and have disproportionately long
   proboscides can access nectar from deep flowers, which is inaccessible
   to species of similar or larger body size but with shorter proboscides.
   Despite this selective advantage, few species possess disproportionately
   long proboscides for their body size, which indicates that there may be
   developmental, functional or other ecological constraints on very long
   proboscides. I hypothesized that species with disproportionately long
   proboscides had a functional cost in terms of higher handling time
   (amount of time spent per flower); therefore, they were at a competitive
   disadvantage compared to butterflies that had shorter proboscides and
   lower handling times.
   I tested this hypothesis using Costa Rican butterflies. I measured body
   length, proboscis length and handling time on Lantana and Wedelia, two
   nectar plants with generalist pollination systems which attract large
   numbers of nectar-feeding butterfly species.
   There was a strong positive relationship between `relative proboscis
   length' (proboscis length in relation to body size) and handling time
   per flower on both nectar plants. Species with greater relative
   proboscis length had up to three times longer handling time per flower.
   Thus, butterflies with relatively long proboscides should harvest less
   nectar per unit time from the same flower than butterflies with normal
   proboscides.
   Reduced foraging efficiency in the face of competition from other
   nectarivores may thus be a functional constraint that limits the
   evolution of disproportionately long proboscides in generalist
   nectar-feeding butterflies.}},

Abstract = {{Strong evidence exists for global declines in pollinator populations.
   Data on the population genetics of solitary bees, especially diet

   of the oligolectic bee Lasioglossum oenotherae, a specialist on the
   pollen of evening primrose ( Onagraceae), by genotyping 455 females from
   15 populations across the bee's North American range at six
   hyper-variable microsatellite loci. We found significant levels of
   genetic differentiation between populations, even at small geographic
   scales, as well as significant patterns of isolation by distance.
   However, using multilocus genotype assignment tests, we detected 11
   first-generation migrants indicating that L. oenotherae's
   sub-populations are experiencing ongoing gene flow. Southern populations
   of L. oenotherae were significantly more likely to deviate from
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and from genotypic equilibrium, suggesting
   regional differences in gene flow and/or drift and inbreeding.
   Short-term N(e) estimated using temporal changes in allele frequencies

Abstract = {{Although there is a worldwide concern about anthropogenic, causes of
   pollinator declines, little is known about how specific land use
   practices, such as agriculture, urbanization, and logging, influence the
   diversity and abundance of native bees. We investigated the impact of
   logging on native bees (Apoidea) in the Adirondack Mountains of New York
   State (USA) in an area isolated from the effects of both agriculture and
   introduced honey bees. Specifically, we measured midsummer bee abundance
   and diversity on matched 5-acre plots two and three years after
   experimental logging cuts to remove 30, 60, and 100\% of the trees. We
   obtained additional data on floral abundance and weather in relation to
   bee abundance. We found that bee abundance and diversity was highest in
   areas where the most trees had been removed. Also, we found little
   difference in diversity between the two study years, despite major
   differences in weather. The observed diversity patterns were best
   explained by the observed increase in abundance of flowering plants such
   as Rubus and Solidago. Despite the overall relationship between logging
   and bee diversity, the abundance of four species of Lasioglossum were
   significantly greater in the 60\% tree removal plot than the 100\%
   removal clear cut. Overall, our results suggest that a small-scale tree
   removal within a northern hardwood forest increases diversity and
   abundance of many bee species in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Management of rare plants living in small populations requires life
   history and breeding system knowledge for informed conservation
   decisions, yet often management and recovery planning proceeds without
   breeding system information. We performed a series of hand pollination
   treatments to determine the breeding system of Lupinus sulphureus ssp.
   kincaidii (Kincaid's lupine), a Threatened plant of western Oregon, and
   followed its most active pollinator, Bombus californica, to estimate
   selfing rates. We found that Kincaid's lupine is self-compatible and can
   also produce seeds through facilitated selfing, a condition without
   pollen transfer between different flowers on the same plant. Bombus
   spent at least 75\% of their total foraging flight time performing
   geitonogamous flights, foraging between male and female phase flowers on
   the same plant, but selfing rates were likely underestimated because
   Kincaid's lupine is capable of vegetative spread. Moreover, the majority
   of Bombus foraged contrary to conventional flight patterns on
   protandrous vertical inflorescences, likely increasing selfing rates.
   Our results indicate that while it is easy to rely on population seed to
   assess whether or not a population is inbred, and therefore a candidate
   for augmentation, a molecular study and/or hand pollination experiments
   are required to assess population inbreeding depression severity,
   because other plausible explanations for low seed set have been
   demonstrated.}},

   primarily in characters of the male genitalia and hidden sterna. The
   South American Protandrena s. I. are morphologically highly diverse and
   a complete study of the group is needed before supraspecific names are
   proposed for Unusual species. Thus, to avoid further nomenclatural

   flowers that can be visited by bees, hummingbirds, and butterflies. This
   study aimed to analyze the interactions between the flowers of Vochysia
   lucida and their floral visitors in an area of restinga in Bahia State,
   Brazil. V. lucida is an arborescent species and presents inflorescences
   of the type raceme, with about 100 to 170 flowers. The flowers are
   zygomorphic, yellow-coloured, and considered mellitophilous. The floral
   nectar is produced and stored in the spur, which is localized at the
   calyx. The flowering peak of V lucida was in November and December. All
   through the study the flowers opened at 6 h., when the stigma was
   already receptive. At flower opening the anther was already not more
   present and the pollen grains were deposited in the wall of the style,
   occurring secondary presentation of pollen. Petals dropped in the end of
   the afternoon about 17:00 h. The hummingbirds, although frequent in the
   flowers of V lucida, were considered as opportunistic visitors. Among
   the recorded floral visitors, the large bees were regarded the most
   efficient pollinators, especially Xylocopa frontalis, because it has
   suitable morphology and behavior to contact the reproductive structures
   of the flower, during nectar collections, and for its high visiting

Abstract = {{The phylogenetic relationships of members of the long-tongued bee tribe
   Anthophorini were investigated. Twenty-six ingroup taxa, representing
   all known genera and the most common subgenera of the Anthophorini, were
   included in a cladistic analysis of the tribe based on 51 morphological
   characters. The analysis yielded the generic relationships:
   ((Habrophorula, Elaphropoda) (Habropoda (Deltoptila (Pachymelus
   (Amegilla, Anthophora))))). The monophyly of the Anthophorini and each
   of its genera was confirmed. A second tribe, Habropodini, as postulated
   by some authors, is paraphyletic. On the basis of the results of the
   cladistic analysis and the biogeographical data of Anthophorini, an
   evolutionary scenario is postulated in which all genera of Anthophorini
   probably evolved in the Late Cretaceous, except Amegilla and Anthophora,
   which originated in the Oligocene. The northern part of south-east Asia
   (India to south-east China) is regarded as the most probable place of
   origin and radiation of the Anthophorini. The New World was probably
   colonized three times independently by Habropoda (upper Cretaceous to

   Tertiary) and by Anthophora (Tertiary to Quaternary).}},

Abstract = {{Fifty-four genera of the bee family Apidae comprising almost all tribes
   were analysed based on 77 traditional and one new character of the
   mature larvae. Nine, especially cleptoparasitic species, were newly
   added. Analyses were performed by maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   inference. Trees inferred from the analysis of the complete dataset were
   rooted by taxa from the families Melittidae and Megachilidae. Unrooted
   trees inferred from the analysis of the partial dataset (excluding
   outgroup taxa) are also presented to preclude possible negative effects
   of the outgroup on the topology of the ingroup. Only the subfamily
   Nomadinae was statistically well supported. The monophyly of the
   subfamilies Xylocopinae and Apinae was not topologically recovered. The
   monophyly of the tribe Tetrapediini was supported, and this tribe was
   found to be related to xylocopine taxa. At the very least, larval
   morphology suggests that Tetrapedia is not a member of the subfamily
   Apinae. Our analyses support the monophyly of the Eucerine line
   (Emphorini, Eucerini, Exomalopsini, Tapinotaspidini) and of the Apine
   line (Anthophorini, Apini, Bombini, Centridini, Euglossini, Meliponini).
   All analyses support the monophyly of totally cleptoparasitic tribes of
   the subfamily Apinae. We named this group the Melectine line
   (Ericrocidini, Isepeolini, Melectini, Osirini, Protepeolini,
   Rhathymini). In previous studies all these cleptoparasitic tribes were
   considered independent evolutionary lineages. Our results suggest that
   their similarities with hosts in morphology and pattern are probably the
   result of convergence and host-parasite co-evolution than phylogenetic
   affinity. According to the present analysis, the cleptoparasitism has
   evolved independently only six times within the family Apidae.}},

Abstract = {{Abundant, many-flowered plants represent reliable and rich food sources
   for animal pollinators, and may even sustain guilds of specialized
   pollinators. Contrastingly, rare plants need alternative strategies to
   ensure pollinators' visitation and faithfulness. Flower mimicry, i.e.
   the sharing of a similar flower colour and display pattern by different
   plant species, is a means by which a rare species can exploit a
   successful model and increase its pollination services. The relationship
   between two or more rewarding flower mimic species, or Murllerian
   mimicry, has been proposed as mutualistic, in contrast to the
   unilaterally beneficial Batesian floral mimicry. In this work, we show
   that two different geographical colour phenotypes of Turnera sidoides
   ssp. pinnatifida resemble co-flowering Malvaceae in colour as seen by
   bees' eyes, and that these pollinators do not distinguish between them
   when approaching flowers in choice tests. Main pollinators of T.
   sidoides are bees specialized for collecting pollen in Malvaceae. We
   demonstrate that the similarity between at least one of the geographical
   colour phenotypes of T. sidoides and co-flowering Malvaceae is adaptive,
   since the former obtains more pollination services when growing together
   with its model than when growing alone. Instead of the convergent
   evolution pattern attributed to Murllerian mimicry, our data rather
   suggest an advergent evolution pattern, because only T. sidoides seems
   to have evolved to be more similar to its malvaceous models.}},

Abstract = {{We present a spatially implicit analytical model of forager movement,
   designed to address a simple scenario common in nature. We assume
   minimal depression of patch resources, and discrete foraging bouts,
   during which foragers fill to capacity. The model is particularly
   suitable for foragers that search systematically, foragers that deplete
   resources in a patch only incrementally, and for sit-and-wait foragers,
   where harvesting does not affect the rate of arrival of forage. Drawing
   on the theory of job search from microeconomics, we estimate the
   expected number of patches visited as a function of just two variables:
   the coefficient of variation of the rate of energy gain among patches,
   and the ratio of the expected time exploiting a randomly chosen patch
   and the expected time travelling between patches. We then consider the
   forager as a pollinator and apply our model to estimate gene flow. Under
   model assumptions, an upper bound for animal-mediated gene flow between
   natural plant populations is approximately proportional to the
   probability that the animal rejects a plant population. In addition, an
   upper bound for animal-mediated gene flow in any animal-pollinated
   agricultural crop from a genetically modified (GM) to a non-GM field is
   approximately proportional to the proportion of fields that are GM and
   the probability that the animal rejects a field. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{It is normally thought that deep corolla tubes evolve when the plant's
   successful reproduction is contingent on having a corolla tube longer
   than the tongue of the flower's pollinators. Combining optimal foraging
   theory and quantitative genetics in a spatially explicit,
   individual-based model, we show that flowers with long corolla tubes can
   alternatively evolve because they promote resource partitioning among
   nectar feeders and increase the probability of conspecific pollen
   transfer. When there is competition for resources, long-tongued flower
   visitors feed preferentially at deep flowers and short-tongued visitors
   at shallow flowers. Both plant species thus benefit when the depths of
   their corollas are so different that each flower visitor specializes on
   one species. Resource competition can promote the evolution of deep
   corollas despite the presence of significant amounts of noise, such as
   deviations from optimal foraging behavior due to perceptual errors or
   temporal fluctuations in the relative abundance of competing pollinator
   species. Our results can explain the evolution of long corollas in a
   number of systems that do not conform to the traditional view.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination of the non-rewarding Orchis pauciflora was studied. The
   most abundant visitors of O. pauciflora were B. terrestris queens. The
   fragrance of O. pauciflora inflorescence was dominated by a
   sesquiterpene (E)-beta-farnesene. (E,E)-alpha-Farnesene,
   (E)-2,3-dihydrofarnesol, geranylcitronellol, and the monoterpenes
   limonene and 1,8-cineol were found among less abundant constituents. The
   sesqui- and diterpenes detected in O. pauciflora fragrance are frequent
   constituents of male marking pheromones of many bumble bee species.
   Enantioselective analysis of O. pauciflora scent and B. terrestris male
   marking pheromone revealed the presence of the (S)-isomer of
   (E)-2,3-dihydrofarnesol in both samples, and electrophysiological
   experiments showed that mainly the (S)-isomer activated the antennal
   receptors. In field experiments, O. pauciflora inflorescences were
   enriched with the main compound (E)-beta-farnesene resulting in
   significantly increased pollinia export. We here discuss the chemical
   similarities between orchid and bumble bees and whether the presence of
   bumble bee male pheromone components in O. pauciflora fragrance
   increases its fitness.}},

   + 2) and two accessory bodies. The head shows a characteristic
   morphology. The acrosome is very long and is basically made up of a
   paracrystalline structure. In the central head region, the acrosome is
   inserted into the nucleus, which is observed coiling laterally around
   the paracrystalline structure. In the subsequent part of the
   spermatozoon the nucleus appears round in transverse sections, and over
   some length it is still penetrated by the acrosome until shortly distal
   to the flagellar insertion. At this point the nucleus forms an inverted
   cone-shaped projection. These morphological characteristics of acrosome

Abstract = {{The patch living rules of a pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus terrestris
   L., are studied here in the framework of motivational models widely used
   for parasitoids: The rewarding events found during the foraging process
   are supposed to increase or decrease suddenly the tendency of the insect
   to stay in the current patch and therefore to adjust the patch residence
   time to the patch profitability. The foraging behaviour of these
   pollinators was observed in two environment types to determine their
   patch-leaving decisions. The rich environment was composed of
   male-fertile flowers, offering pollen and nectar, and the poor one of
   male-sterile flowers, offering little nectar and no pollen. The
   experimental design consisted of a patch system in which inflorescences
   were evenly arranged in two rows (1 m distance). Residence times of
   foragers inside inflorescences and rows were analysed by a Cox
   proportional hazards model, taking into account recent and past
   experience acquired during the foraging bout. Most of the results showed
   a decremental motivational mechanism, that is, a reduction in the
   residence time on the inflorescence or in the row related to
   exploitation of flowers within inflorescences and inflorescences within
   rows These results indicate that bumblebees tend to leave the patch
   using departure rules similar to those found in parasitoids. The results
   also provide information on the memory, learning and evaluating
   capabilities of bumblebees especially when rich and poor environments
   were compared. The patch-leaving mechanism suggested by this study is
   consistent with the central place foraging theory.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{The recent trend to place monetary values on ecosystem services has led
   to studies on the economic importance of pollinators for agricultural
   crops. Several recent studies indicate regional, long-term pollinator
   declines, and economic consequences have been derived from declining
   pollination efficiencies. However, use of pollinator services as
   economic incentives for conservation must consider environmental factors
   such as drought, pests, and diseases, which can also limit yields.
   Moreover, ``flower excess{''} is a well-known reproductive strategy of
   plants as insurance against unpredictable, external factors that limit
   reproduction. With three case studies on the importance of pollination
   levels for amounts of harvested fruits of three tropical crops (passion
   fruit in Brazil, coffee in Ecuador, and cacao in Indonesia) we
   illustrate how reproductive strategies and environmental stress can
   obscure initial benefits from improved pollination. By interpreting
   these results with findings from evolutionary sciences, agronomy, and
   studies on wild-plant populations, we argue that studies on economic
   benefits from pollinators should include the total of ecosystem
   processes that (1) lead to successful pollination and (2) mobilize
   nutrients and improve plant quality to the extent that crop yields
   indeed benefit from enhanced pollinator services. Conservation
   incentives that use quantifications of nature's services to human
   welfare will benefit from approaches at the ecosystem level that take
   into account the broad spectrum of biological processes that limit or
   deliver the Service.}},

Title = {{Pollinator and herbivore attraction to Cucurbita floral volatiles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1682-1691}},

Abstract = {{Mutualists and antagonists may place conflicting selection pressures on
   plant traits. For example, the evolution of floral traits is typically
   studied in the context of attracting pollinators, but traits may incur
   fitness costs if they are also attractive to antagonists. Striped
   cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum) feed on cucurbits and are attracted
   to several volatiles emitted by Cucurbita blossoms. However, the effect
   of these volatiles on pollinator attraction is unknown. Our goal was to
   determine whether pollinators were attracted to the same or different
   floral volatiles as herbivorous cucumber beetles. We tested three
   volatiles previously found to attract cucumber beetles in a factorial
   design to determine attraction of squash bees (Peponapis pruinosa), the
   specialist pollinators of cucurbita species, as well as the specialist
   herbivore A. vittatum. We found that 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene was
   attractive to both the pollinator and the herbivore, indole was
   attractive only to the herbivore, and (E)-cinnamaldehyde was attractive
   only to the pollinator. There were no interactions among volatiles on
   attraction of squash bees or cucumber beetles. Our results suggest that
   reduced indole emission could benefit plants by reducing herbivore
   attraction without loss of pollination, and that 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene
   might be under conflicting selection pressure from mutualists and
   antagonists. By examining the attraction of both mutualists and
   antagonists to Cucurbita floral volatiles, we have demonstrated the
   potential for some compounds to influence only one type of interaction,
   while others may affect both interactions and possibly result in
   tradeoffs. These results shed light on the potential evolution of
   fragrance in native Cucurbita, and may have consequences for yield in
   agricultural settings.}},

Abstract = {{The present study intended to verify which factors (phylogenetic
   relationship or local ecological conditions) would determine how
   Frieseomelitta bees use floral resources. The data obtained in the
   literature on biocenotic studies of Apoidea visiting flowers in Brazil
   were analyzed, with identification and quantification of floral
   resources used by Frieseomelitta species in different areas. The
   phenogram of similarity on use of resources among Frieseomelitta species
   was compared to the phylogenetic hypothesis proposed for the group.
   Among the eight Frieseomelitta species registered in 19 studies, F.
   doederleini (Friese), F. francoi (Moure), F. languida Moure, F. varia
   (Lepeletier) e Frieseomelitta sp. nov., were collected using resources
   from 36 plant families. F. doederleini, F.languida e F varia centralized
   their activity in Caesalpiniaccae, Malpighiaceae e Anacardiaceae. The
   similarities and disparities found among areas and Frieseomelitta
   species reflected the similarities and differences of the vegetation
   composition in each area. Frieseomelitta bees presented a forage pattern
   similar to that one presented by other highly social bees, visiting
   flowers of many plant species, but concentrating their activities in few
   plant species. Despite the low phylogenetic relationship between F
   languida and F doederleini, they showed a high similarity on the use of
   floral resource, while F varia e F languida, species with high
   phylogenetic relationship, showed low similarity in the use of resource.
   Although the data obtained are not conclusive, it indicates that
   phylogenetic restrictions do not influence the pattern of use of floral
   resource by Frieseomelitta bees.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are the most important pollinator taxon; therefore, understanding
   the scale at which they forage has important ecological implications and
   conservation applications. The foraging ranges for most bee species are
   unknown. Foraging distance information is critical for understanding the
   scale at which bee populations respond to the landscape, assessing the
   role of bee pollinators in affecting plant population structure,
   planning conservation strategies for plants, and designing bee habitat
   refugia that maintain pollination function for wild and crop plants. We
   used data from 96 records of 62 bee species to determine whether body
   size predicts foraging distance. We regressed maximum and typical
   foraging distances on body size and found highly significant and
   explanatory nonlinear relationships. We used a second data set to: (1)
   compare observed reports of foraging distance to the distances predicted
   by our regression equations and (2) assess the biases inherent to the
   different techniques that have been used to assess foraging distance.
   The equations we present can be used to predict foraging distances for
   many bee species, based on a simple measurement of body size.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{192}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the pollination ecology and related floral
   traits of the species Daucus carota subsp. coninnitatus in the isolated
   archipelago of Columbretes, E. Spain, where bees are absent. Two
   populations were studied: a small population found on a relatively large
   island (Grossa) inhabited nowadays by three people; and a larger
   population on a smaller uninhabited island (Foradada). The plant, found
   also in other rockv coastal enclaves of the west Mediterranean, is
   totally self-compatible, andromonoecious, exhibiting strong protandrous
   dichogamy and sequential flowering of umbel orders, with limited
   probability of self pollination at the plant level. Pollination on both
   study islands is carried out solely by flies, mainly by Eristalis tenax
   (Syrphidae), a long distance visitor and efficient pollinator, but
   irregular migrant to the archipelago; and Lucilia sericata
   (Calliphoridae), an abundant flower visitor but less efficient
   pollinator dependent on human and avian wastes for its larval growth.
   The small population on Grossa appears not to suffer pollen limitation.
   Seed set is reduced, however, in the large population on Foradada, which
   we attribute to the low pollinator capital of this island, which is too
   small to attract and sustain migrant hoverflies and where no human and
   avian wastes are available to sustain blowfly growth. We conclude that
   in isolated environments with reduced or unpredictable pollinator
   capital, long distance migrant pollinators, such as E. tenax, play an
   invaluable conservation and perhaps evolutionary role for the native
   plants. Because these islands have been always practically uninhabited
   we argue that the absence of adequate local pollinator capital is
   perhaps compensated by the selection of particular floral traits, which
   differentiate the study subspecies from other conspecifics. Such traits
   are: the exposure of nectar during male versus female stage to enhance
   quick pollen flow; the extended stigma receptivity period (up to 10
   days) resulting in a total flower life span of up to 22 days, enabling
   an adequate pollen deposition on stigmas even under low pollen transfer
   rates. In this respect, the low flower sex ratio (hermaphrodite:
   staminate) compared to other conspecifics studied elsewhere may be also
   relevant.}},

Volume = {{267}},
Number = {{1-4}},

Abstract = {{Floral isolation has been considered to be an important reproductive
   mechanism governing the species diversification in many genera. In a
   classic example Aquilegia, sympatric species from North America with
   diverse floral traits are generally associated with specialized
   pollinators that prohibit interspecific hybridization. It remains
   unclear whether species diversification in the genus from Eurasia is
   also maintained by floral isolation. We investigated floral phenology,
   floral characteristics and pollinators in three sympatric Aquilegia
   species (A. ecalcarata, A. incurvata and A. yabeana) in the Qinling
   Mountains, Shanxi Province, China from 2001 to 2005. The spurless A.
   ecalcarata flowers earlier than the other two species with nectar spurs
   but their floral phenology overlaps. Major pollinators of A. ecalcarata
   are syrphid flies while bumblebees are major for A. incurvata and A.
   yabeana. Therefore our observations confirm that mechanical isolation
   through differential pollinators could contribute reproductive isolation
   between spurless and spurred species, as demonstrated by studies from
   North America. Whether floral isolation plays a major role in the
   reproductive isolation between two spurred species (A. incurvata and A.
   yabeana), however, remains to be seen. Further studies are required to
   quantify the potential role of geographical isolation because they
   occupy different habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Prolonged floral longevity and bumblebees as dominate pollinators in
   alpine ecosystem have been suggested to overcome pollination limitation
   of alpine plants arising from the decrease of pollinator activity with
   increasing altitude. However, this conclusion has never been examined in
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), the highest and largest plateau in
   the world. In this study, we intended to test year-to-year correlations
   between floral longevity, visiting frequency and pollen limitation of
   this species between two populations (at 3200 m and 4000 m) of Gentiana
   straminea in this plateau. Pollinator exclusion elongated both male and
   female phases greatly at both sites, and durations of both male and
   female phases in natural condition varied greatly over three years. The
   visiting frequency of bumblebees varied greatly at the higher altitude,
   but seemed to be stable at the lower altitude. Seed production was
   pollination limited in both populations in most studied years. The
   floral durations, pollinator frequency and pollination limitation showed
   no significant and consistent variations with the increase of altitude.
   The previous hypothesis that the prolonged floral longevity of alpine
   plants can compensate for low levels of pollinator visitation therefore
   could not be confirmed, and our results further suggested that in the
   QTP platform, the altitude shows no consistent effect on the
   reproductive performance of this species, despite that the fluctuation
   of visit frequency intensified at the higher altitude.}},

Abstract = {{The competitive relations between members of phylogenetically distant
   plant families Asteraceae (Centaurea and Cirsium) and Dipsacaceae
   (Knautia and Succisa) with purple anthodia, sharing a common wide range
   of pollen vectors and competing for them, were studied. The composition
   of pollen vectors is somewhat different in different plant species. Only
   bumble-bees, the most effective pollinators, were observed visiting
   every studied plants species. Syrphidae flies, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera,
   and some other insects were also observed in different proportions.
   The principal importance for pollination of the corolla tube size,
   correlating with the size of insect mouthparts, and the additional
   importance of particular traits of the inflorescence are confirmed.
   Convergent similarity of the aspect of anthodia in two species of
   different families is shown to be based on different structural and
   functional features. Insect pollinators are the factor of anthodia
   convergence. The plant species studied are divided into the following
   three groups, according to the proportion of bumble-bees among pollen
   vectors and to the range of species-specific pollinators; species
   coadapted to one pollinator taxon; species coadapted to two or three
   pollinator taxa; and species coadapted to many pollinator taxa.
   Asteraceae species in general (with the exception for Cirsium arvense)
   are characterized by constant contacts with a narrower range of
   pollinators than Dipsacaceae species (and Cirsium arvense),
   characterized by wider range of pollinators. Among flowering plants with
   similar anthodia, the tighter structural coadaptations of Asteraceae
   with their effective pollinators provide their greater competitive
   ability as compared to Dipsacaceae.}},

   discovery constitutes both the first unambiguous fossil of
   Orchidaceae(4) and an unprecedented direct fossil observation of a
   plant-pollinator interaction(5,6). By applying cladistic methods to a
   morphological character matrix, we resolve the phylogenetic position of
   M. caribea within the extant subtribe Goodyerinae (subfamily
   Orchidoideae). We use the ages of other fossil monocots and M. caribea
   to calibrate a molecular phylogenetic tree of the Orchidaceae. Our
   results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of extant orchids
   lived in the Late Cretaceous (76-84 Myr ago), and also suggest that the
   dramatic radiation of orchids began shortly after the mass extinctions
   at the K/T boundary. These results further support the hypothesis of an
   ancient origin for Orchidaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Interval timing-sensitivity to elapsing durations-has recently been
   found to occur in an invertebrate pollinator, the bumble-bee ( Bombus
   impatiens). Here, bumble-bees were required to time the interval between
   the start of foraging in a patch of low-quality artificial flowers
   providing 25\% sucrose and the availability of a high-quality flower
   (HQF) that provided 50\% sucrose after a fixed delay. The delay changed
   after every 20 foraging bouts in the order 30-150-30 s. Bees visited the
   HQF sooner when the delay was 30 s than when it was 150 s, and visits to
   the HQF peaked near the end of both delays. When the delay changed to
   150 s, bees appeared to time both the previous 30 s delay and the new
   delay. To examine whether bees also learned what kind of reward was
   provided at the HQF, its usual reward was replaced with 25\% sucrose in
   a final foraging bout. Bumble-bees rejected the HQF on the
   reward-replacement test. These results show that bumble-bees remembered
   both when reward was produced by the HQF and what type of reward was
   produced. These findings indicate that bumble-bees can learn both the
   timing and content of reward production.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Bilabiate flowers have evolved in many lineages of
   the angiosperms, thus representing a convincing example of parallel
   evolution. Similar to keel blossoms, they have obviously evolved in
   order to protect pollen against pollen-collecting bees. Although many
   examples are known, a comprehensive survey on floral diversity and
   functional constraints of bilabiate flowers is lacking. Here, the
   concept is widened and described as a general pattern.
   Methods The present paper is a conceptional review including personal
   observations of the authors. To form a survey on the diversity of
   bilabiate blossoms, a search was made for examples across the
   angiosperms and these were combined with personal observations collected
   during the last 25 years, coupled with knowledge from the literature.
   New functional terms are introduced that are independent of
   morphological and taxonomic associations.
   Key Results Bilabiate constructions occur in at least 38 angiosperm
   families. They are characterized by dorsiventral organization and dorsal
   pollen transfer. They are most often re:alised on the level of a single
   flower, but may also be present in an inflorescence or as part of a
   so-called `walk-around flower'. Interestingly, in functional terms all
   nototribic blossoms represent bilabiate constructions. The great
   majority of specialized bee-flowers can thus be included under bilabiate
   and keel blossoms. The syndrome introduced here, however, also paves the
   way for the inclusion of larger animals such as birds and bats. The most
   important evolutionary trends appear to be in the saving of pollen and
   the precision of its transfer. With special reference to the Larniales,
   selected examples of bilabiate flowers are presented and their
   functional significance is discussed.
   Conclusions Bilabiate blossoms protect their pollen against
   pollen-collecting bees and at the same time render their pollination
   more precisely. The huge diversity of realised forms indicate the high
   selection pressure towards the bilabiate syndrome. As bees are very
   inventive, however, bilabiate constructions will not represent the
   ultimate response to bees.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Bird-pollinated (orniithophilous) Salvia species
   (sages) transfer pollen either by means of a staminal lever mechanism or
   by immovable stamens. As the distribution of the two modes within the
   genus is not known, we present a survey of all ornithophilous sages. The
   main focus is given to floral diversity especially with respect to
   functional lever morphology. Thereby the hypothesis is tested that, due
   to a pollinator shift from bees to birds, the lever mechanism became
   unnecessary.
   Methods To get a general idea about the diversity of pollen transfer
   mechanisms, 186 ornithophilous Salvia species were classified according
   to the functional morphology of the stamen and the need for a lever
   movement. To test the functionality of the staminal levers and the
   fitting between flowers and birds the process of pollen transfer was
   examined by pollinator observations and tested by inserting museum skins
   and metal rods into fresh flowers.
   Key Results The diversity of pollen transfer mechanisms is represented
   by eight case studies illustrating three main groups. In group I
   (approx. 50 \%) the staminal lever mechanism is necessary to open access
   to nectar and to enable the transfer of pollen that is hidden in the
   upper lip. In group II (approx. 34 \%) pollen is freely accessible and
   the lever mechanism is reduced in different ways and to different
   degrees. In group III (approx. 4 \%) the lever works as in group 1, but
   pollen is freely accessible as in II. The remaining approx. 13 \% are
   not clearly classified.
   Conclusions It is considered that the driving force behind the diverse
   modes of reduction is the necessity to increase the distance between
   nectar and pollen, thereby ensuring pollen deposition on the bird's
   feathered head. This is achieved several times in parallel by corolla
   elongation and/or exposure of the pollen-sacs. As soon as pollen is
   freely accessible, the lever movement loses its significance for
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of small, short, and two-flowered Pedicularis
   muscoides subsp. himalayca was studied during its full blooming period
   in alpine areas of western Sichuan Province, China, part of the putative
   origin and diversification center of the genus. Pedicularis muscoides
   subsp. himalayca was nototribically pollinated exclusively by queens of
   four bumblebee species (Bombus Latr.) that foraged for nectar on flowers
   in an upright position. Of the four Bombus species, B. friseanus Smith
   occurred in the highest frequency and was the major pollinator of P.
   muscoides subsp. himalayca. It comprised 81\% of the bumblebees
   collected on P. muscoides subsp. himalayca. Queen bumblebees stood on
   the ground while foraging on flowers, which has not previously been
   reported in other Pedicularis species. During the study period almost
   all the foragers were confined to the studied subspecies and very
   occasionally visited other associated blooming species at the study
   site. The low plant height; outcurved terminal flowers, short-tubed,
   erostrate, and copiously nectariferous flowers; corolla morphology; and
   highly synchronized short-blooming period of P. muscoides subsp.

Abstract = {{Capitol Reef National Park, in southcentral Utah, contains 22 small
   orchards planted with antique fruit varieties by Mormon pioneers
   beginning over a century ago. The orchards continue to be managed in a
   pick-and-pay program, which includes spraying with phosmet to suppress
   codling moth (Cydia pomonella L.). The park is also home to a rich
   diversity of flowering plants, many of which are rare, bee-pollinated,
   and have populations within 1 kin of the orchards. Over 3 yr, we studied
   the short-term effects of phosmet spraying on bee populations: (1)
   foraging on plants within the orchard understory and adjacent to it; and
   (2) nesting in, and at several distances from, the orchards. We recorded
   a rich bee fauna (47 taxa) in the orchards and on plants nearby. In 2 yr
   (2002 and 2004), we found no difference in the number of native bee
   visits to several species of plants flowering in and near to orchards
   immediately before and 1 d after spraying. Conversely, our nesting
   studies using the semidomesticated alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata (F.), showed strong significant declines in the number of
   adult males, nesting females, and progeny production subsequent to
   spraying at distances up to 160 in from sprayed orchards where the bees
   were presumably foraging. We showed that Al. rotundata is negatively
   affected by phosmet spraying and suggest that caution should be
   exercised in its use in areas where bees are apt to forage.}},

Abstract = {{1. Agri-environment schemes attempt to counteract the loss of
   biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as pollination and
   natural pest control in agro-ecosystems. However, only a few studies
   have evaluated whether these attempts are successful.
   2. We studied the effects of managing meadows according to the
   prescriptions of ecological compensation areas (ECA), the most widely
   adopted agri-environment scheme in Switzerland, on both pollinator
   species richness and abundance, and the reproductive success of plants
   in nearby intensively managed meadows (IM).
   3. We established arrays of four pots, each containing individuals of
   three insect-pollinated, non-autogamous `phytometer' species (Raphanus
   sativus, Hypochaeris radicata and Campanula glomerata), in ECA and
   adjacent IM at increasing distances from the ECA at 13 sites.
   4. Species richness and abundance of hoverflies, solitary bees and
   large-sized pollinators (mainly social bees and butterflies) were
   significantly higher in ECA than in adjacent IM. Species richness and
   abundance of small-sized pollinators in IM declined significantly with
   increasing distance from ECA, whereas large-sized pollinators were not
   significantly affected by distance. Plant species richness and flower
   abundance were the major drivers of pollinator species richness and
   abundance; the area of an ECA had no significant influence.
   5. Individual plants of R. sativus and C. glomerata produced more and
   heavier seeds in ECA than in IM. Furthermore, the number of seeds of
   these two phytometer species was positively correlated with species
   richness and abundance of bees. No such effects were observed for
   individual plants of H. radicata. The number of fruits and seeds per
   plant of R. sativus in IM decreased with increasing distance from ECA.
   6. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that establishing ECA is an
   effective method of enhancing both pollinator species richness and
   abundance and pollination services to nearby intensely managed farmland.
   Our study emphasizes the importance of connectivity between ECA in
   maintaining diverse pollinator communities and thereby providing
   pollination services in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are important pollinators for many flowering plants. Female bees
   are thought to be more effective pollinators than male bees because they
   carry much more pollen than males. Males of some solitary bee species
   are known to patrol near flowers that females visit. Because patrolling
   males visit flowers to mate or defend their territories, they may
   function as pollinators. However, the significance of patrolling males
   to pollination has not been studied. We studied males of a solitary bee,
   Heriades fulvohispidus (Megachilidae), patrolling near flowers and
   visiting flowers that attracted nectar-feeding insects, including
   conspecifics, on the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands. To test the hypothesis
   that patrolling male bees may function as pollen vectors, we compared
   the frequency of visits by H. fulvohispidus to flowers of an endemic
   plant, Schima mertensiana (Theaceae); comparisons were made among
   flowers with a dead H. fulvohispidus, a dead beetle, a piece of plastic,
   and nothing (control flowers). Patrolling H. fulvohispidus more
   frequently visited flowers with a dead conspecific, a dead beetle, or a
   piece of plastic than the control flowers. Our experiment demonstrates
   that nectar-feeding insects (including conspecifics and other insects)
   enhance the flower-visiting frequency of patrolling H. fulvohispidus
   males on S. mertensiana flowers. Furthermore, we observed S. mertensiana
   pollen on patrolling males as well as females, suggesting that male bees
   may also function as pollen vectors.}},

Title = {{Reproductive assurance through self-fertilization does not vary with
   population size in the alien invasive plant Datura stramonium}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous self-fertilization is suggested to be associated with
   invasiveness in plants because it offers reproductive assurance when
   there is a shortage of suitable mates or pollinators. Given that
   shortages of mates and pollinators are a common cause of Allee effects
   in small plant populations, we predict that the benefits of
   self-fertilization in terms of reproductive assurance should be greatest
   in small populations. We tested this idea for the invasive herb Datura
   stramonium, a self-fertilizing species which is also cross-pollinated to
   some extent by insects (mainly hawkmoths and honeybees). During two
   consecutive years, we studied 20 and 55 populations, respectively, of
   different sizes. Untreated flowers of D. stramonium showed high levels
   of fruit and seed set in all populations studied. Although, fruit and
   seed set were generally reduced by about 90\% in flowers in which
   self-fertilization was prevented through emasculation, this effect did
   not vary according to population size. By using a natural color
   (anthocyanin) dimorphism in 12 populations, we showed that the average
   outcrossing rate was low (1.3\%) and that there was no relationship
   between outcrossing rate and population size. Pollen removal from
   flowers also did not vary according to population size, suggesting that
   the pollinator visitation rate is not lower in small populations.
   However, decreasing deviations of observed from expected fruit set with
   population size imply that small populations may have an increased
   chance of extinction due to demographic stochasticity. Overall, our
   results suggest that reproductive assurance through self-fertilization
   in invasive plants may be important for all stages of population
   establishment, and not just in the founder population.}},

Abstract = {{The floral morphology of Weigela hortensis was examined at two main
   sites, Izumi (IZM) and Sasaya (SSY), and three additional sites, Aobadai
   (AOB), Yagiyama (YGY) and Taihaku-san (THK), in Japan. Morphological
   relationships between flowers and pollinators were compared between IZM
   and SSY. Floral characteristics varied highly among sites. Flowers at
   THK were significantly longer than those at AOB and YGY, but there were
   no significant differences between IZM and SSY in the length of the
   corolla tube, stamen or pistil. In contrast, flowers at IZM, AOB and THK
   had wider corollas than those at SSY and YGY. The bumblebee Bombus
   hypocrita, which has a short proboscis and wide thorax, was observed to
   rob nectar more frequently at SSY than at IZM. The proportion of flowers
   of the appropriate size for B. hypocrita queens to access nectaries was
   higher at IZM than at SSY. A higher proportion of flowers with long and

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships among and within major groups of bees are
   still poorly resolved. The main gap is the identification of the basal
   branch of bee phylogeny. In this context, more information is needed
   about the early fossil record of bees. Here, we describe Palaeomacropis
   eocenicus gen. nov. sp. nov., discovered in early Eocene amber of Oise
   (France). It is the oldest record of Melittidae and the fourth oldest
   fossil bee. The remarkable state of preservation of the specimen allows
   a detailed description of the cuticle and the setae. A cladistic
   analysis supports the classification of this species among the
   Macropidinae (Melittidae). Together with the existing records on a
   Maas-trichtian Apidae and a Palaeocene Megachilidae, the discovery of an
   early Eocene Melittidae supports the hypothesis that Melittidae could
   constitute the basal branch of bee phylogeny. Moreover, the morphology
   and disposition of the setae of R eocenicus are similar to those of the
   contemporary oil-collecting bee Macropis. The presence of a bee with
   such specialized structures would support the hypothesis that a close
   relationship existed between bees and oil flowers since the early
   Eocene. (c) 2007 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated several aspects of the nesting biology of Epicharis
   metatarsalis Friese (Hymenoptera: Apidae) in a lowland wet-forest of
   northeastern Costa Rica. Five large aggregations were found 30-100 m
   from larger rivers at the La Selva Biological Station. The relatively
   short nesting season, from May to August, indicates that E. metatarsalis
   is probably univoltine. Four nests were excavated to study nest
   architecture, and five brood cells from three different nests were
   analyzed for pollen composition. Additionally, we analyzed pollen loads
   from 33 females returning from pollen-collecting trips, and we observed
   male patrolling behavior. The canopy tree Apeiba membranacea Spruce ex
   Benth (Tiliaceae) was found to be the principal pollen source,
   representing an average proportion of 98.5\% of each pollen load and
   93.4\% of the larval provisions. The brood cell with the lowest
   proportion of A. membranacea pollen contained 89.3\% A. membranacea
   pollen, which was 98.5\% by relative volume. Pollen of Byrsonima crispa
   A. Juss. (Malpighiaceae) was the second most frequently encountered
   pollen with average proportions of 1.3 and 4.9\% in pollen loads and
   larval provisions, respectively. E. metatarsalis can thus be considered
   oligolectic. The E. metatarsalis nesting season coincides with the
   relatively short flowering season of B. crispa, perhaps because of the
   importance of B. crispa as a source of oils rather than nectar.}},

Abstract = {{Two perennial Trifolium, T. polymorphum Poir. and T. argentinense Speg.,
   are American clovers unique within the genus for being amphicarpic.
   There is no consensus in the literature regarding the breeding system of
   the aerial flowers of T polymorphum, therefore, the breeding system was
   studied. In 1997 T polymorphum was collected in Uruguay and evaluated at
   INIA Tacuarembo. In 2001, 10 field patches were marked and in 2004, 20
   plants per patch were characterized with simple sequence repeat markers.
   Patch J10 showed a particular molecular profile, therefore, 198
   open-pollinated progenies freely visited by honeybees were studied. In
   2005, at the University of Florida, Gainesville, different
   handpollination treatments were conducted within an accession from
   Paraguay. Trifolium polymorphum was able to cross-pollinate with all the
   known pollen donors molecularly marked that surrounded plants from patch
   J10 (30\%), also with some nonmarked native ones from the vicinity
   (10\%) as well as with itself (60\%), when allowed to be visitedby
   honeybees. However, when there are pollinators, the selfing rate is
   minimal. The proposed classification for the breeding system is an
   allogamous, self-compatible species that benefits from pollinators to

Abstract = {{A suspected global decline in pollinators has heightened interest in
   their ecological significance. In a worst-case scenario, the decline of
   generalist pollinators is predicted to trigger cascades of linked
   declines among the multiple specialist plant species to which they are
   linked, but this has not been documented. I Studied a portion of a
   pollination web involving a generalist pollinator, the oil-collecting
   bee Rediviva peringueyi, and a community of oil-secreting plants. Across
   27 established conservation areas located in the Cape Floral Region, I
   found substantial variation in the bees' occurrence in relation to soil
   type and the successional stage of the vegetation. Anthropogenic
   declines were detectable against this background of naturally occurring
   variation: R. peringueyi was absent from small conservation areas (<385
   ha) in an urban matrix. In the absence of the bee, seed set failed in
   six specialist plant species that are pollinated only by R. peringueyi
   but remained high in a pollination generalist, which had replacement
   pollinators. The findings are consistent with theoretical predictions of
   the importance of generalist pollinators in maintaining the structure of

Abstract = {{Tetrapedia diversipes and other Apidae (Anthophoridae) may be deceived
   by floral similarities between Malpighiaceae and Orchidaceae of the
   Oncidiinae subtribe. The latter do not usually exudate floral oils.
   Thus, visitors may pollinate the flowers in a deceit/food/pollination
   syndrome. We studied the chemical compositions of Byrsonima intermedia
   (Malpighiaceae) floral oil and T. diversipes (Anthophoridae) cell
   provisions. From B. intermedia floral oil, we isolated a novel fatty
   acid (3R, 7R)-3,7-diacetoxy-docosanoic acid, here named byrsonic acid,
   and from T. diversipes cell provisions we isolated two novel fatty acid
   derivatives 3,7-dihydroxy-eicosanoic acid and 3,7-dihydroxy-docosanoic
   acid, here named tetrapedic acids A and B, respectively. The three fatty
   acid derivatives have common features: possess long chains (20 or 22
   carbon atoms) with no double bond and either hydroxy or acetoxy groups
   at carbons 3 and 7. This characteristic was also encountered in the
   fatty acid moiety of oncidinol (2S, 3'R, 7'R)-1-acetyl-2-{[}3',
   7'-diacetoxyeicosanyl)-glycerol, a major floral oil constituent of
   several Oncidiinae species (Orchidaceae). Thus, both tetrapedic A (C20)
   and B (C22) could be the biotransformation products of oncidinol and
   byrsonic acid by T. diversipes hydrolases. These are the chemical clues
   for bee visitation and oil collecting from both plant species. The
   results indicate that the deceit/pollination syndrome should not be
   applied to all Oncidiinae flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Cowpea is a self-pollinated crop and this is encouraged by the
   arrangement of floral parts. However, outcrossing has been reported and
   frequency of occurrence could vary depending on the genotypes involved
   and the environment where grown. Insects have been implicated in the
   movement of pollen in cowpea from one plant to another. Many insects
   visit cowpea flowers, which have extra-floral nectaries and in the
   process facilitate both self and cross pollination. Three cowpea lines
   with anthocyanin pigment, a dominant trait, and a fourth line lacking
   the pigment were used to measure the frequency of outcrossing in cowpea.
   Each of the lines with anthocyanin pigment was separately planted in
   alternate rows with the line lacking the trait at a spacing of 90 cm
   between and 25 cm within rows. In another study carried out at two
   different locations in Nigeria and one in the Republic of Benin two
   cowpea lines were used to measure extent of pollen movement. The two
   lines were planted in concentric circles with the line having
   anthocyanin pigment occupying the first four innermost circles
   surrounded by circles of plants of the line with no pigment. Each circle
   was spaced 1.0 metre to the next. Results obtained from both studies
   showed that outcrossing occurs in cowpea albeit at a low frequency of
   less than 1.0 percent. In addition, outcrossing occurred up to 31 metre
   distance. The insects most likely to be involved in pollen movement in
   cowpea are humble bees and honey bees. The results of these studies
   would be useful in risk assessment for bioengineered cowpea, which need
   to be carried out prior to its release to the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a palynological analysis of the organic content of
   earthenware pots from the Kodiani burial mound (27th-25th centuries B.
   C.) are reported. The character of the palynological spectrum differs
   significantly from that of a buried soil within the same burial mound.
   In the samples taken from the pots, pollen concentration is very high,
   pollen grains are perfectly preserved and an abundance of pollen from
   insect- pollinated plants is recorded. It is well known that these
   features are peculiar to honey palynospectra. In all three pots the
   pollen of Rosaceae, a family of plants that produce good honey, is
   dominant. However, the second, third and fourth most dominant pollen
   types in all three samples are different. For example, Tilia pollen is
   the second dominant in only one pot. In the second pot, Apiaceae and
   Poaceae are predominant, and in the third pot, Poaceae, both wild and
   cultural, is the second dominant. It is clear that the different pots
   contained different types of honey. The variety of honey types indicates
   highly developed bee- keeping in the Early Bronze Age. In the same
   regions of Georgia, agriculture was also highly developed. Wheat
   cultivation was very important. According to the palynospectra, the
   landscape and climate of this period were probably quite different to
   those of today.}},

Abstract = {{The result of habitat fragmentation has been assessed through measuring
   of richness and diversity of some functional groups, especially
   flower-visiting insects. These organisms allow functional connectivity

   insects on transects established between a gallery forest and the
   eucalyptus reforestation and exclusively among a section of eucalyptus
   trees in south Brazil. Insects collected belonged to the orders
   Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Insect
   abundance was low compared to other studies. Twenty-eight species were
   found in both environments, whereas 138 were restricted to one
   environment (61 in gallery forest/eucalyptus, and 77 in
   eucalyptus/eucalyptus). Insects visited flowers of 31 plants species
   distributed in 20 families. In both environments, there were a few
   dominant species and a large number represented by a single individual.
   A similarly high diversity was found in both environments (H' = 4.084
   and H' = 4.018). Among insects, bees showed the highest diversity in
   environments gallery forest/eucalyptus (H' = 3.211) and
   eucalyptus/eucalyptus (H' = 2.8). Despite the similarity in community

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flower shapes are important visual cues for
   pollinators. However, the ability of pollinators to discriminate between
   flower shapes under natural conditions is poorly understood. This study
   focused on the diversity of flower shape in Primula sieboldii and
   investigated the ability of bumblebees to discriminate between flowers
   by combining computer graphics with a traditional behavioural
   experiment.
   Methods Elliptic Fourier descriptors described shapes by transforming
   coordinate information for the contours into coefficients, and principal
   components analysis summarized these coefficients. Using these methods,
   artificial flowers were created based on the natural diversity of petal
   shape in P. sieboldii. Dual-choice tests were then performed to
   investigate the ability of the bumblebees to detect differences in the
   aspect ratio of petals and the depth of their head notch.
   Key Results The insects showed no significant ability to detect
   differences in the aspect ratio of the petals under natural conditions
   unless the morphological distance increased to an unrealistic level.
   These results suggest the existence of a perception threshold for
   distances in this parameter. The bumblebees showed a significant
   preference for narrow petals even after training using flowers with wide
   petals. The bumblebees showed a significant ability to discriminate
   based on the depth of the petal head notch after training using
   artificial flowers with a deep head notch. However, they showed no
   discrimination in tests with training using extreme distances between
   flowers in this parameter.
   Conclusions A new type of behavioural experiment was demonstrated using
   real variation in flower corolla shape in P. sieboldii. If the range in
   aspect ratios of petals expands much further, bumblebees may learn to
   exhibit selective behaviour. However, because discrimination by
   bumblebees under natural conditions was low, there may be no strong
   selective behaviour based on innate or learned preferences under natural
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive failure results in many plant species becoming endangered.
   However, little is known of how and to what extent pollinator shifts
   affect reproductive performance of endangered species as a result of the
   artificial introduction of alien insects. In this study we examined
   breeding systems, visitor species, visiting frequency and seed set
   coefficients of Swertia przewalskii in two years that had different
   dominant pollinator species (native vs. alien). Flowers of this species
   were protandrous and herkogamous and insects were needed for the
   production of seeds. The stigmatic receptivity of this species was
   shorter than for other gentians. No significant difference in seed set
   coefficient was found for hand-pollinated plants between the two years,
   indicating that pollinator shift only had a minor effect on this plant's
   breeding system. The commonest pollinators in 2002 were native
   bumblebees, alien honeybees and occasional solitary bees, however, only
   alien honeybees were observed in 2004. The flower visitation rate in
   both years was relatively high, although the total visit frequency
   decreased significantly in 2004. The control flowers without any
   treatment produced significantly fewer seed sets in 2004 than in 2002.
   In the past decade the seed production of this species may have partly
   decreased due to pollination by alien honeybees, however, we suggest
   that they might have acted as alternative pollinators ensuring seed
   production of S. przewalskii when native pollinators were unavailable.
   The main reason that this plant is endangered is probably the result of
   habitat destruction, but changes in land use, namely intensified
   agricultural practice and unfavorable animal husbandry have also
   contributed to its decline. We recommend that in-situ conservation,
   including the establishment of a protected area, is the best way to
   preserve this species effectively.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that intensive grazing management, aimed at
   maintaining plant diversity, might not be the optimal choice to preserve
   diversity of insects in semi-natural pastures. In the present study the
   behaviour of flower visiting insects was studied in two semi-natural
   pastures in central Sweden. Two grazing treatments were established with
   one grazed from mid-May, ``continuous{''}, and one grazed from mid-July,
   ``late{''}. Flower visitors were followed for 9 weeks in summer 2003 in
   7 pairs of 5 x 5 m plots on two sides of a fence dividing the two
   grazing treatments. Visitor behaviour was studied on three decision
   levels between: (1) habitats, (2) flowers and (3) activities on flowers.
   The pattern varied between decision levels: More species and individual
   visitors chose to forage in the late grazing treatment. Visitation rate
   and flower constancy did not differ between treatments and was related,
   to a large extent, to plant species richness. In relation to flowers,
   insects utilized a broader diversity of activities in the late grazing
   treatment. All patterns were consistent across sites and during the
   whole study period. The differences in pollinator abundance and
   activities on flowers were best explained by the higher abundance of
   flowers. It is suggested that studies of insect behaviour may be a
   useful tool when deciding on management recommendations. Late grazing is
   recommended as a useful management regime and might potentially function
   as a substitute for mowing in the future.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, field manipulation and pollinator choice experiments
   utilizing arrays of natural and artificial flowers have yielded mixed
   results with respect to whether symmetric flowers receive higher
   visitation rates or produce more seeds compared to asymmetric flowers.
   In this article, we test the hypothesis that deviations from perfect
   floral symmetry result in decreased seed production and reduced rates of
   insect visitation. We performed a floral manipulation experiment in two
   concurrent years with Hesperis matronalis (Brassicaceae) to investigate
   how seed production per fruit was linked to floral symmetry. In
   addition, we performed two replicated array experiments using model
   plants and flowers based on H. matronalis to investigate whether insects
   make decisions to visit plants on the basis of floral symmetry and
   whether insects use floral symmetry as a cue to discriminate among
   flowers within plants. We find no clear evidence that deviations from
   perfect floral symmetry affect insect visitation rates to plants or
   flowers within a plant and no clear association between floral symmetry
   and seed production. However, our array experiments suggest that insects
   use flower size as a primary cue to discriminate among plants but not
   among flowers within a plant.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{168}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In Anagyris foetida, a shrubby legume with autumn-winter flowering, the
   flowers produce great amounts of very dilute nectar during the first
   half of their life, consonant with their pollination by passeriforms.
   With advancing age, the volume of nectar diminishes and the
   concentration increases to values characteristic of bee-pollinated
   flowers. The daily nectar secretion is greatest in volume early in the
   morning, damping during the day, whereas the concentration usually
   undergoes a gradual rise from morning to evening. The flowers visited
   for the first time in any day in the first half of anthesis have greater
   accumulated final nectar volumes than those first visited in the second
   half of anthesis. The accumulated nectar per flower is less in flowers
   that receive one visit per day than in those that receive three visits
   per day and is less in shrubby plants than in arboreal plants. In
   unvisited flowers, the rate of production of nectar depends on the
   environmental conditions, and at the end of their life there is a major
   loss of volume due to evaporation and of solutes possibly due to
   reabsorption. These flowers usually present a large hanging droplet of
   nectar that has a greater concentration and sugar content than does the
   nectar inside the calyx. The sugar, hexose dominant, is homogeneous in
   both locations.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the impact of Bombus terrestris invasion on the foraging

   Japanese bumblebee species (mixed), and one with only Japanese species

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{716-736}},

Abstract = {{The subfamily Lecythidoideae of Lecythidaceae (Brazil nut family) is a
   dominant group in neotropical forests, especially those of Amazonia. New
   World members of the family have large showy flowers that are either
   polysymmetric or monosymmetric. In this study, floral organogenesis of
   all 10 neotropical genera was examined using SEM. Our observations of
   floral development are put into the context of a molecular phylogeny
   based on sequences of the ndhF and trnL-F genes (Am. J. Bot. 94:
   289-301). Floral evolution of the subfamily is explained as having
   undergone four different levels of complexity in regard to floral
   symmetry. The basal most genera, Grias and Gustavia, have polysymmetric
   flowers. At level two, represented only by Couroupita, monosymmetry is
   established through the expression of abaxial dominance and the
   development of an androecial hood; at this level, abaxial dominance
   impacts the perianth and androecium, but not the gynoecium. At the third
   level, monosymmetry is developed in groups of Couratari and Cariniana
   domestica; but, in the Allantoma/Cariniana decandra lineage, a reversal
   back to polysymmetric flowers, resulting from a gradual weakening of
   abaxial dominance, and the loss of the hood has occurred. Finally, in
   level four, including Bertholletia, Corythophora, Eschweilera, and
   Lecythis, monosymmetry is so strongly expressed that the gynoecium is
   also influenced by abaxial dominance. In this group, the hood is
   complicated in both structure and function, and the floral axis is
   changed from straight to slightly inclined. This study demonstrates that
   the development of floral abaxial dominance is the proximate cause of
   monosymmetry in the Lecythidoideae. We suggest that monosymmetric
   flowers are more efficiently pollinated, and therefore the bees and bats
   that pollinate the monosymmetric flowers in this group are ultimately
   responsible for the monosymmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Nesting substrates and construction materials are compared for 65 of
   North America's 139 described native species of Osmia bees. Most
   accounts report Osmia bees nesting in preexisting cavities in dead wood
   or pithy stems such as elderberry (Sambucus spp.), with cell partitions
   and plugs made from a pulp of finely masticated leaf tissue. Mud is
   widely used by species constructing free-form clumps of nest cells
   against stone surfaces. Some Osmia bees adopt abandoned nests of other
   Hymenoptera, particularly those of mud dauber wasps (Sceliphron spp.)
   and larger ground-nesting bees (e.g., Anthophora spp.). Reports of
   subterranean nesting by Osmia species are uncommon but possibly
   under-represent the habit, because subterranean nests are obscure and
   likely to be scattered. Ground- or surface-nesting habits are suspected
   for species that are absent from intensive trap-nesting programs in
   their native ranges but that otherwise have been commonly taken at
   flowers. The range of nesting habits and materials of European species
   are largely comparable, although records indicate that far more European
   species may nest in empty snail shells.}},

Abstract = {{Primary reproductives of the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes
   formosanus Shiraki (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), complete their first
   reproductive cycle in approximate to 60 d after nest formation. During
   this period, the pairs mate several times. The spherical, aflagellate
   sperm, after transfer by the male, are stored in the female's
   spermatheca. Sperm numbers in the spermatheca increase significantly
   between day 20 and 40, and thereafter they show a steep decline,
   indicating that the pairs may not be mating after day 40. The
   spermatheca is bean shaped with an extremely narrow duct. The thick wall
   of the spermatheca consists mainly of type 3 cells made up of secretory
   and duct cells. Cuticle-lined ducts are interspersed throughout these
   cells. Finger-like extensions of the cuticle-lined interior wall project
   into the spermathecal lumen. The secretory cells presumably provide
   nutrition for the sperm during their long storage. Eleven anaerobic and
   six aerobic species of bacteria were cultured and identified from the
   spermatheca. The role of these bacteria is unknown.}},

Abstract = {{The consequence of a proposed pollinator decline for agriculture is a
   subject of much ongoing debate. However pollination requirements of many
   cultivated plants remain unknown. Citrus is complex in terms of
   pollination needs because of great variation in breeding systems among
   and within species, and even among and within cultivars. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate pollinator dependence of three cultivers
   of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) planted in northwestern Argentina.
   Bagged flowering branches were assigned to different pollination
   treatments: emasculation, spontaneous self-pollination, hand
   self-pollination, and hand cross-pollination, and the results compared
   with those from open-pollinated flowers. We counted the number of pollen
   grains and pollen tubes in the style, fruit set, and seed pro- duction.
   We also assessed differences in germi- nation rates of self- vs.
   cross-pollen grains. We found that hand and open-pollinated flowers set
   about six times more fruit than emasculated and bagged (insect excluded)
   flowers. In addition, cross-pollen performed better in terms of grain
   germination and tube growth than selfpollen. Although being fully
   self-compatible, apomixis and wind pollination are not important factors
   for grapefruit reproductive success. Thus, insect pollinators represent
   a critical and potential limiting resource for seedless grapefruits from
   northwestern Argentina.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1202-1209}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Mutualisms are commonly exploited by cheater species that usurp rewards
   without providing reciprocal benefits. Yet most studies of selection
   between mutualist partners ignore interactions with third species and
   consequently overlook the impact of cheaters on evolution in the
   mutualism. Here, we explicitly investigate how the abundance of
   nectar-thieving ants (cheaters) influences selection in a pollination
   mutualism between humble bees and the alpine skypilot, Polemonium
   viscosum. As suggested in past work with this species, humble bees
   accounted for most of the seed production (78\% +/- 6\% {[}mean +/- SE])
   in our high tundra study population and, in the absence of ants, exerted
   strong selection for large flowers. We tested for indirect effects of
   ant abundance on seed set through bumble bee pollination services
   (pollen delivery and pollen export) and a direct effect through flower
   damage. Ants reduced seed set per flower by 20\% via flower damage. As
   ant density increased within experimental patches, the rate of flower
   damage rose, but pollen delivery and export did not vary significantly,
   showing that indirect effects of increased cheater abundance on
   pollinator service are negligible in this system. To address how ants
   affect selection for plant participation in the pollination mutualism we
   tested the impact of ant abundance on selection for humble bee-mediated
   pollination. Results show that the impact of ants on fitness (seed set)
   accruing under bumble bee pollination is density dependent in P.
   viscostan. Selection for bumble bee pollination declined with increasing
   ant abundance in experimental patches, as predicted if cheaters
   constrain fitness returns of mutualist partner services. We also
   examined how ant abundance influences selection on flower size, a key
   component of plant investment in humble bee pollination. We predicted
   that direct effects of ants would constrain humble bee selection for
   large flowers. However, selection on flower size was significantly
   positive over a wide range of ant abundance (20-80\% of plants visited
   by ants daily). Although high cheater abundance reduces the fitness
   returns of bumble bee pollination, it does not completely eliminate
   selection for-bumble bee attraction in P. viscosuln.}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{375-382}},

Abstract = {{Secondary compounds may benefit plants by deterring herbivores, but the
   presence of these defensive chemicals in floral nectar may also deter
   beneficial pollinators. This trade-off between sexual reproduction and
   defense has received minimal study. We determined whether the
   pollinator-deterring effects of a nectar alkaloid found in the perennial
   vine Gelsemium sempervirens depend on ecological context (i.e. the
   availability of alternative nectar sources) by monitoring the
   behavioural response of captive bumblebees (Bombus impatiens, an
   important pollinator of G. sempervirens in nature) to nectar alkaloids
   in several ecologically relevant scenarios. Although alkaloids in floral
   nectar tended to deter visitation by bumblebees, the magnitude of that
   effect depended greatly on the availability and nectar properties of
   alternative flowers. Ecological context should thus be considered when
   assessing ecological costs of plant defense in terms of pollination
   services. We consider adaptive strategies that would enable plants to
   minimize pollinator deterrence because of defensive compounds in
   flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Most species of flower-visiting Hymenoptera are trichromatic, with
   photoreceptor spectral sensitivity peaks in the UV, blue and green
   regions of the spectrum. Red flowers, therefore, should be relatively
   difficult to detect for such insects. Nevertheless, in population
   biological studies in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, the Sardinian
   island population (B. t. sassaricus) displayed significantly higher
   responses to red artificial flowers (in tests of innate colour choice
   and detectability) than several mainland populations of the same species
   (Chittka et al. in Cognitive ecology of pollination, pp 106-126, 2001;
   Popul Ecol 46:243-251, 2004): Since there is relatively little
   physiological data on population differences in sensory systems, we used
   intracellular recording to compare photoreceptor spectral sensitivity in
   B. t. sassaricus and the southern European and Mediterranean population,
   B. t. dalmatinus. The results show both populations to be UV-blue-green
   trichromats, but with a small but significant increase in long-wave
   sensitivity in island bees. Spectral peaks were estimated at 348, 435
   and 533 nm (B. t. dalmatinus) and 347, 436 and 538 nm (B. t. sassaricus)
   for UV, blue and green receptors, respectively. There were no
   significant differences in UV and blue receptor sensitivities. We found
   no photoreceptors maximally sensitive to red spectral light in the
   Sardinian population and model calculations indicate that the
   behavioural population differences in colour responses cannot be
   directly explained by receptor population differences.}},

Abstract = {{Tecoma stans (L.) Kunth is an exotic plant in Brazil, commonly
   distributed in urban areas, which is considered an invasive species in
   crop and pasture areas. In this study, the floral biology and the
   behavior of bees in flowers of T stans from three urban areas in
   southeastern Brazil were investigated. In all study sites, T stans was
   an important food resource to the Apoidea to 48 species of bees. Centris
   tarsata Smith and Exomalopsis fulvofasciata Smith (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   were the effective pollinators more abundant, while Scaptotrigona
   depilis Moure (Hymenoptera: Apidae) was the more frequent robber
   species. The most part of T stans visitors (87.5\%) exploited
   exclusively nectar, which varied in sugar concentration depending on the
   day period and flower phase. In all flower stages, higher averages of
   nectar concentration (26.4\% to 32.7\%) occurred from 10 am to 2 pm. The
   presence of osmophore in the petals and protandry were detected. In two
   urban areas the number of visitors varied significantly during the day.
   The greatest abundance of pollinators occurred when pollen availability
   was higher and flowers showed receptive stigma, which could be
   contributing to the reproductive success of T stans. The results
   indicate that the production of fruits increased in plants that received
   a higher number of effective pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar production may disproportionately benefit male relative to female
   pollination success. In such cases, sexual selection is often suggested
   as the cause of asymmetric benefits, yet sexual selection in
   plants-particularly plants with hermaphroditic flowers-is infrequently
   tested empirically. Here, I used a protandrous herb with male-biased
   nectar production (Chrysothenlis friediichsthaliana. Gesneriaceae) to
   test predictions from sexual selection theory. During three flowering
   seasons, I measured nectar production, pollinator visits. and male and
   female fecundity following different numbers of cross-pollination
   events. In accordance with sexual selection predictions, (I) nectar
   production was greater during the male phase by at least 65\%; (2)
   visits by the main pollinator (hummingbird Phaethornis striigularis)
   were limiting for part of the season, indicating that plants had to
   compete for pollinator visits-, (3) pollinators spent 53\% more time per
   visit and made 86\% more visits to male- vs. female-phase flowers,
   suggesting that nectar increased male more than female pollination
   success: and (4) female fecundity was maximized by one visit. whereas
   male fecundity continued to increase with additional visits. Autonomous
   self-pollination further reduced visit requirements for maximum female
   seed set. These findings match specific sexual selection predictions:
   they link an observable I male bias in a secondary sexual trait (nectar)
   to positive responses of mating participants (pollinators), resulting in
   more mating opportunities for mate-limited males, relative to apparently
   resource-limited females. This field-testing of theoretical predictions
   provides unique evidence that sexual selection helps maintain nectar
   production patterns in this and, quite likely. other hermaphroditic
   plant species.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Differences in the mating systems and the mechanisms
   of reproductive isolation between Chamaecrista desvauxii var. graminea
   and C. desvauxii var. latistipula were examined in the Chapada
   Diamantina, Brazil. These taxa occur sympatrically, and their
   populations demonstrate marked morphological differences. The objective
   of the present work was to determine if reproductive isolation
   mechanisms exist between these two populations of C. desvauxii, and to
   determine the influence of these putative mechanisms on their genetic
   differentiation.
   Methods Field observations were made of floral biology, phenology and
   floral visitation, and experiments on intra- and interpopulation
   pollination and germination rates of the resultant seeds were performed.
   A genetic examination of the populations was undertaken using four
   allozyme loci.
   Key Results The varieties examined demonstrated overlapping of flowering
   periods during the months of June to September. The main pollinator for
   both varieties was the bee Bombus brevivillus. Both varieties are
   self-compatible, and a large number of fruits are formed in
   cross-pollinations with high seed germination rates. Inter-taxa
   pollinations result in high levels of fruit production, but no seeds are
   formed. Two of the four loci examined were diagnostic for the varieties,
   and exclusive high-frequency alleles were encountered at the other loci,
   leading to a high genetic distance between the two populations (0-495).
   Conclusions Pre-zygotic barriers were not found between the two
   varieties, and these remain isolated due to post-zygotic events. The two
   varieties demonstrate marked differences in their morphology, floral
   biology, phenology and genetic make-up, all of which indicate that they
   should be treated as two distinct species. A complete revision involving
   the other varieties of the C. desvauxii complex will be necessary in
   order to define these two taxa formally.}},

Title = {{Intra-plant variation in nectar sugar composition in two Aquilegia
   species (Ranunculaceae): Contrasting patterns under field and glasshouse
   conditions}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Intra-specific variation in nectar chemistry under
   natural conditions has been only rarely explored, yet it is an essential
   aspect of our understanding of how pollinator-mediated selection might
   act on nectar traits. This paper examines intra-specific variation in
   nectar sugar composition in field and glasshouse plants of the
   bumblebee-pollinated perennial herbs Aquilegia vulgaris subsp. vulgaris
   and Aquilegia pyrenaica subsp. cazorlensis (Ranunculaceae). The aims of
   the study are to assess the generality of extreme intra-plant variation
   in nectar sugar composition recently reported for other species in the
   field, and gaining insight on the possible mechanisms involved.
   Methods The proportions of glucose, fructose and sucrose in
   single-nectary nectar samples collected from field and glasshouse plants
   were determined using high performance liquid chromatography. A
   hierarchical variance partition was used to dissect total variance into
   components due to variation among plants, flowers within plants, and
   nectaries within flowers.
   Key Results Nectar of the two species was mostly sucrose-dominated, but
   composition varied widely in the field, ranging from sucrose-only to
   fructose-dominated. Most intra-specific variance was due to differences
   among nectaries of the same flower, and flowers of the same plant. The
   high intra-plant variation in sugar composition exhibited by field
   plants vanished in the glasshouse, where nectar composition emerged as a
   remarkably constant feature across plants, flowers and nectaries.
   Conclusions In addition to corroborating the results of previous studies
   documenting extreme intra-plant variation in nectar sugar composition in
   the field, this study suggests that such variation may ultimately be
   caused by biotic factors operating on the nectar in the field but not in
   the glasshouse. Pollinator visitation and pollinator-borne yeasts are
   suggested as likely causal agents.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nectar feeders has grown a lot as a result of people wanting
   to attract hummingbirds to their gardens. This has caused an increment
   in the density and diversity of these birds in urban and suburban

   hummingbirds but they can also result in reduced visitation to native
   plants. We experimentally assessed the effect of placing nectar feeders
   in the vicinity of two native plant species in a suburban area of Mexico
   City. The plants with feeders showed a reduced visitation rate and in
   one case (Salvia fulgens) produced fewer seeds than the controls. Salvia
   mexicana was not only visited by hummingbirds but it was also by bees
   that were not attracted to the feeders, probably resulting in the lack
   of effect on this plant. Native plants in urban and suburban habitats
   can be threatened by reduced visitation rates and reduced seed sets
   resulting from the use of feeders. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Bees are believed to be in decline across many of the world's
   ecosystems. Recent studies on British bumblebees proposed alternative
   theories to explain declines. One study suggested that greater dietary
   specialization among the rarer bumblebee species makes them more
   susceptible to decline. A second study disputed this theory and found
   that declines in British bumblebees were correlated with the size of
   species' European ranges, leading to the suggestion that climate and
   habitat specialization may be better indicators of the risk of decline.
   Here we use a new and independent dataset based on Irish bumblebees to
   test the generality of these theories. We found that most of the same
   bumblebee species are declining across the British Isles, but that,
   within Ireland, a simple food-plant specialization model is inadequate
   to explain these declines. Furthermore, we found no evidence of a
   relationship between declines in Irish bumblebees and the size of
   species' European ranges. However, we demonstrate that the late emerging
   species have declined in Ireland (and in Britain), and that these
   species show a statistically significant westward shift to the extremity
   of their range, probably as a result of changing land use. Irish data
   support the finding that rare and declining bumblebees are later nesting
   species, associated with open grassy habitats. We suggest that the
   widespread replacement of hay with silage in the agricultural landscape,
   which results in earlier and more frequent mowing and a reduction in
   late summer wildflowers, has played a major role in bumblebee declines.

Abstract = {{Floral longevity is an important feature of a plant's reproductive
   strategy. The goal of this study was to examine flower life span in the
   shrub flame azalea (Rhododendron calendulaceum (Michx.) Torr.) to
   determine if it is fixed or plastic and to evaluate its association with
   pollen removal and receipt. Unmanipulated flowers remained open for
   similar to 10 days, while hand-pollinated flowers closed earlier
   (similar to 7 days), indicating that these flowers are subject to
   pollination-induced senescence. In 2002, pollen removal was rapid
   (similar to 70\% of pollen was removed in the first 2 h of anthesis),
   while female function was a slower process (pollen accumulated on
   stigmas for up to 4 days). Fruit set was pollen limited, as 80\% of
   handout-crossed flowers set fruit versus 35\% of naturally pollinated
   flowers. This is likely the result of the pollen-collecting behavior of
   a common solitary bee, which did not contact stigmas. In sharp contrast,
   2003 was a cooler and wetter spring, few flower visitors were observed,
   and virtually no pollen was removed from or deposited on stigmas after
   48 h. These results suggest that the flower life span of flame azalea is
   a result of selection for increasing the probability of pollen receipt
   rather than pollen dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Within mosaic landscapes, many organisms depend on attributes of the
   environment that operate over scales ranging from a single habitat patch
   to the entire landscape. One such attribute is resource distribution.
   Organisms' reliance on resources from within a local patch vs. those
   found among habitats throughout the landscape will depend on local
   habitat quality, patch quality, and landscape composition. The ability
   of individuals to move among complementary habitat types to obtain
   various resources may be a critical mechanism underlying the dynamics of
   animal populations and ultimately the level of biodiversity at different
   spatial scales. We examined the effects that local habitat type and
   landscape composition had on offspring production and survival of the
   solitary bee Osmia lignaria in an agri-natural landscape in California
   (USA). Female bees were placed on farms that did not use pesticides
   (organic farms), on farms that did use pesticides (conventional farms),
   or in seminatural riparian habitats. We identified pollens collected by
   bees nesting in different habitat types and matched these to pollens of
   flowering plants from throughout the landscape. These data enabled us to
   determine the importance of different plant species and habitat types in
   providing food for offspring, and how this importance changed with
   landscape and local nesting-site characteristics. We found that
   increasing isolation from natural habitat significantly decreased
   offspring production and survival for bees nesting at conventional
   farms, had weaker effects on bees in patches of seminatural habitat, and
   had little impact on those at organic farm sites. Pollen sampled from
   nests showed that females nesting in both farm and seminatural habitats
   relied on pollen from principally native plant species growing in
   seminatural habitat. Thus connectivity among habitats was critical for
   offspring production. Females nesting on organic farms were buffered to
   isolation effects by switching to. oral resources growing at the farm
   site when seminatural areas were too distant. Overall local habitat
   conditions (farm management practices) can help bolster pollinators, but
   maintaining functional connectivity among habitats will likely be
   critical for persistence of pollinator populations as natural habitats
   are increasingly fragmented by human activities.}},

Abstract = {{The megachilid bees Osmia lignaria Say, Megachile rotundata (F.), and M.
   pugnata Say were tested for attraction to various components associated
   with their old nest cavities, or chemical extracts of these components,
   using a Y-tube olfactory response bioassay. Female bees of these species
   are known to nest in or near old nest cavities, implying that remnant
   nest components are important cues for bees looking for nest cavities.
   Significant results show that female bees were attracted to components
   that may provide species-specific cues or indicate conspecific nesting
   activity. Specifically, O. lignaria females showed attraction only to
   the female cocoon. M. rotundata females were attracted to intact nest
   cells, the fecal material on the outside of a cocoon, leaf pieces used
   as nest cell lining, and the extract of leaf pieces. M. pugnata females
   were attracted to the whole nest cell, the paper straw nesting material
   with attached cocoon, and feces.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification poses a serious threat to biodiversity as a
   consequence of increased land-use intensity, decreased landscape
   heterogeneity and reduced habitat diversity. Although there is interest
   in the preservation of total species richness of an agricultural
   landscape (gamma diversity), the effects of intensification have been
   assessed primarily by species richness at a local scale (alpha
   diversity). This ignores species richness between local communities
   (beta diversity), which is an important component of total species
   richness.
   In this study, measures of land-use intensity, landscape structure and
   habitat diversity were related to gamma, alpha and beta diversity of
   wild bees (Apoidea), carabid beetles (Carabidae), hoverflies
   (Syrphidae), true bugs (Heteroptera) and spiders (Araneae) within 16
   local communities in 24 temperate European agricultural landscapes.
   The total landscape species richness of all groups was most strongly
   affected by increased proximity of semi-natural habitat patches. Bees
   also decreased in landscapes with a high intensity of farmland
   management, demonstrating additive effects of both factors.
   Separating total species diversity into components, the decrease in
   total species richness could be attributed primarily to a decrease in
   species diversity between local communities. Species richness of the
   local communities of all investigated groups decreased with increasing
   land-use intensity and, in the case of spiders, decreasing proximity of
   the semi-natural habitat patches.
   The effect of increased habitat diversity appeared to be of secondary
   importance to total species richness but caused a shift in the relative
   contribution of alpha and beta diversity towards the latter.
   Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the effects of
   agricultural change operate at a landscape level and that examining
   species diversity at a local level fails to explain the total species
   richness of an agricultural landscape. The coincidence of patterns of
   beta diversity with those of gamma diversity emphasizes that such
   information is of crucial importance for the implementation and
   evaluation of restoration programmes aiming to restore sustainable
   countryside diversity. As local extinction processes in highly
   fragmented landscapes shape biodiversity, priority should be given to
   the conservation of diverse agricultural landscape remnants in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{To test the relative importance of long-term and working spatial
   memories in short-range foraging in bumblebees, we compared the
   performance of two groups of bees. One group foraged in a stable array
   of six flowers for 40 foraging bouts, thereby enabling it to establish a
   long-term memory of the array, and adjust its spatial movements
   accordingly. The other group was faced with an array that changed
   between (but not within) foraging bouts, and thus had only access to a
   working memory of the flowers that had been visited. Bees in the stable
   array started out sampling a variety of routes, but their tendency to
   visit flowers in a repeatable, stable order ({''}traplining{''})
   increased drastically with experience. These bees used shorter routes
   and converged on four popular paths. However, these routes were mainly
   formed through linking pairs of flowers by near-neighbour movements,
   rather than attempting to minimize overall travel distance. Individuals
   had variations to a primary sequence, where some bees used a major
   sequence most often, followed by a minor less used route, and others
   used two different routes with equal frequency. Even though bees
   foraging in the spatially randomized array had access to both spatial
   working memory and scent marks, this manipulation greatly disrupted
   foraging efficiency, mainly via an increase in revisitation to
   previously emptied flowers and substantially longer search times. Hence,
   a stable reference frame greatly improves foraging even for bees in
   relatively small arrays of flowers.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding system and flower visitors of White River
   penstemon, a rare endemic from the Uintah Basin of eastern Utah and

   showed that Penstemon scariosus var. albifluvis has a mixed mating
   system: while some seeds and fruits are produced through
   self-pollination (both autogamy and geitonogamy), significantly more are
   produced when flowers are cross-pollinated. The primary flower visitors,
   and likely pollinators, were several species of native twig- and
   ground-nesting bees in the families Apidae, Halictidae, and
   Megachilidae. We found no differences in fruit or seed production
   between open-pollinated controls and hand-outcrossed flowers, suggesting
   that pollinator visits were sufficient to maximize female reproductive
   success. Management plans to conserve White River penstemon must
   recognize that full reproductive success of this rare plant taxon relies
   on a suite of pollinating bees, and that the species richness and
   abundances of bee visitors should be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering, nectar production and visiting bees of Eriope blanchetii
   (Lamiaceae), in sand dunes, northeastern Brazil. Observations on nectar
   production, flowering and visiting bees were conducted from October 1999
   to October 2000 in a wild population of Eriope blanchetii (Benth) Harley
   (Lamiaceac) located at Abaete sand dunes (12 degrees 56'S, 38 degrees
   21'W), in Salvador, Bahia. Fifteen bee species were collected with those
   varying from medium to large-sized being predominant. The effective
   pollinators were Xylocopa cearensis Ducke, 1910 and Colletes
   petropolitanus Dalla Torre, 1896, considering their body size, behaviour
   and frequency on flowers. Flowering is continuous in E. blanchetii and
   the degree of synchrony, duration and intensity of flowering in
   individual plants enforces the interplant movement and gene flow
   provided by pollinators with different energetic demands and generalist
   behavior. The pollen deposition is ventral at the same site where
   anthers and stigma touch bee body, but only C petropolitanus carried
   pure E. blanchetii pollen loads. Pollen grain removal generally occurs
   during male phase and pollen deposition on receptive stigmas during
   female phase. Nectar was sampled from May to October 2000. Its
   concentration was 22\% (n=10 flowers) and total amount produced ranged
   from 0.01 to 0.98 mu l. The highest amount of nectar was found during
   male phase (U=2972.5; P < 0.05), but there was no significant difference
   in nectar volume between bagged and unbagged flowers (U=3632; P > 0.05)
   nor in relation to flower position on the inflorescence (ANOVA=4.478; P
   > 0.05). Daily pattern of flowering, nectar production and accessibility
   are important attractants for potential pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Natural hybridization plays a critical role in speciation, the
   maintenance of reproductive isolation, and genetic introgression. While
   many plant species have hybrid swarms in areas of sympatry, the lack of
   hybrids among closely related sympatrically distributed species suggests
   that strong pre- and/or postzygotic barriers exist to hybridization.
   Gelsemium sempervirens and G. rankinii (Gelsemiaceae) are sympatrically
   distributed southeastern sister taxa that have strong postzygotic
   barriers to hybrid formation and high levels of genetic differentiation.
   In this study, two sympatric populations in Lowndes County, Georgia were
   surveyed from 1999-2005 to assess the role of temporal and pollinator
   isolation as potential prezygotic barriers. The populations had mostly
   non-overlapping flowering periods in 2003-2005, with significant
   differences in time of peak flowering and length of flowering. Both
   species shared a similar community of flower visitors, with the apid bee
   Habropoda laboriosa the dominant visitor to both species. A choice
   experiment found that H. laboriosa visited both species but preferred G.
   sempervirens. The primary prezygotic barrier is temporal isolation
   preventing hybridization in spite of the shared pollinators. This study
   suggests that reliance on a shared pollinator during speciation may
   limit opportunity for divergent selection on flowering time.}},

Abstract = {{Several insect species visited exotic Rhododendron ponticum flowers, but
   bumblebees were most common. Only bumblebees (and one Vespula) contacted
   the flower stigma whilst foraging and are probably the main pollinators.
   One-third of insect visits resulted in stigma contact and visitation
   rates were high. This explains the high seed set reported elsewhere.
   There were significant differences according to the body size of
   visitors, with large queen bees contacting stigmas more often than
   smaller workers. There were no significant differences in behaviour of
   three species (Bombus jonellus, B. lucorum and B. monticola) and all
   bees tended to move short distances between flowers on a single plant.
   Longer flights and movements among plants were rare. Pollen carryover
   was estimated to be high: there was no decline in the amount of pollen
   deposited on stigmas from the first to fifth flower visited. The impact
   of bee behaviour on reproduction and invasion by exotic R. ponticum is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We wished to understand the effects on pollinator behaviour of single
   mutations in plant genes controlling flower appearance. To this end, we
   analysed snapdragon flowers (Antirrhinum majus), including the mixta and
   nivea mutants, in controlled laboratory conditions using psychophysical
   tests with bumblebees. The MIXTA locus controls petal epidermal cell
   shape, and thus the path that incident light takes within the
   pigment-containing cells. The effect is that mixta mutant flowers are
   pink in comparison to the wild type purple flowers, and mutants lack the
   sparkling sheen of wild type flowers that is clearly visible to human
   observers. Despite their fundamentally different appearance to humans,
   and even though bees could discriminate the flowers, inexperienced bees
   exhibited no preference for either type, and the flowers did not differ
   in their detectability in a Y-maze-either when the flowers appeared in
   front of a homogeneous or a dappled background. Equally counterintuitive
   effects were found for the non-pigmented, UV reflecting nivea mutant:
   even though the overall reflectance intensity and UV signal of nivea
   flowers is several times that of wild type flowers, their detectability
   was significantly reduced relative to wild type flowers. In addition,
   naive foragers preferred wild type flowers over nivea mutants, even
   though these generated a stronger signal in all receptor types. Our
   results show that single mutations affecting flower signal can have
   profound effects on pollinator behaviour-but not in ways predictable by
   crude assessments via human perception, nor simple quantification of UV
   signals. However, current models of bee visual perception predict the
   observed effects very well.}},

Abstract = {{Population differentiation in female mating signals and associated male
   preferences can drive reproductive isolation among segregated
   populations. We tested this assumption by investigating intraspecific
   variation in female sex pheromone and associated male odour preferences
   among distant populations in the solitary bee Colletes cunicularius (L.)
   by using quantitative gas chromatography and by performing field
   bioassays with synthetic blends of key sex pheromone compounds. We found
   significant differences in sex pheromone blends among the bee
   populations, and the divergence in odour blends correlated positively
   with geographic distance, suggesting that genetic divergence among
   distant populations can affect sex pheromone chemistry. Our behavioural
   experiments, however, demonstrate that synthetic copies of allopatric
   female sex pheromones were cross-attractive to patrolling males from
   distant populations, making reproductive isolation by non-recognition of
   mating signals among populations unlikely. Our data also show that
   patrolling male bees from different populations preferred odour types
   from allopatric populations at the two sites of bioassays. These male
   preferences are not expected to select for changes in the female sex
   pheromone, but may influence the evolution of floral odour in sexually
   deceptive orchids of the genus Ophrys that are pollinated by C.
   cunicularius males.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the role of generalist Diptera in the pollination of two
   dioecious plant species, Clematis ligusticifolia Nutt. (Ranunculaceae)
   and Shepherdia canadensis (L.) Nutt. (Elaeagnaceae). In particular, we
   assess (i) whether or not generalist pollinators are unable to
   distinguish between the sexes of dioecious species and so visit the
   sexes at equivalent rates, and (ii) the number of flowers that
   generalist flies visit and revisit during a foraging bout, which would
   affect self-pollination if plants were hermaphroditic. We determined the
   visitation rate to each plant species during 10 min periods and recorded
   the number of flowers that individual pollinators visited and revisited
   per foraging bout. Diptera were the main pollinators, visiting both
   sexes at similar rates for both plant species. The main visitors to C.
   ligusticifolia were muscoid flies (small and large), Culicidae, and
   halictid bees. The number of flowers visited in this species varied with
   pollinator group, but groups did not differ in the frequency of
   revisits. Visitors to S. canadensis were primarily Syrphidae and
   Empididae. Neither the number of flowers visited nor the number of
   revisits differed between these two pollinator groups. The results for
   each plant species are discussed and contrasted, particularly with other
   studies of the behaviour of generalist and specialist pollinators. We
   compare the observed pollinator behaviours, and their implications for
   plant mating, with the various theories of the role of pollinators in
   the evolution of the dioecious breeding system in plants.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological and economic consequences of rain forest conversion and
   fragmentation for biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and ecosystem
   services like protection of soils, water retention, pollination, or
   biocontrol are poorly understood. In human-dominated tropical
   landscapes, forest remnants may provide ecosystem services and act as a
   source for beneficial organisms immigrating into adjacent annual and
   perennial agro-ecosystems. In this study, we use empirical data on the
   negative effects of increasing forest distance on both pollinator
   diversity and fruit set of coffee to estimate future changes in
   pollination services for different land use scenarios in Sulawesi,
   Indonesia. Spatially explicit land use simulations demonstrate that
   depending on the magnitude and location of ongoing forest conversion,
   pollination services are expected to decline continuously and thus
   directly reduce coffee yields by up to 18\%, and net revenues per
   hectare up to 14\% within the next two decades ( compared to average
   yields of the year 2001). Currently, forests in the study area annually
   provide pollination services worth 46 Euros per hectare. However, our
   simulations also revealed a potential win-win constellation, in which
   ecological and economic values can be preserved, if patches of forests (
   or other natural vegetation) are maintained in the agricultural
   landscape, which could be a viable near future option for local farmers
   and regional land use planners.}},

   nearly 100\% relative humidity at night. Polytunnel air temperatures on
   sunny days were increased - during ventilation - by up to 6 degrees C
   relative to the outside, e.g. 33 degrees C versus 27 degrees C outside.
   Forced cherries saved one spray application against aphids compared to
   those outside. Fully-grown cherry leaves contained 40-60 mg
   chlorophyll/g FM sufficient for photosynthesis with commensurate
   chlorophyll contents when grown in the polytunnel compared with those
   outside, and were deficient in calcium (0.5\% DM) and magnesium (0.2\%
   DM), but with a surplus in both nitrogen (3.5\% DM) and phosphorus
   (0.42\% DM). The surplus leaf nitrogen was due to excessive nitrogen
   mineralization in the rich soil under the higher temperatures in the
   polytunnel which caused the vigorous vegetative growth despite the
   dwarfing rootstock. Great fluctuations in fertilisation - despite strong
   flowering and sufficient pollination with honey bees - of between 4-71\%
   may be due to the combination of S-alleles of the cherry varieties,
   infrequent water supply, nutrient imbalance and microclimate. Trees of
   cv. `Burlat', `Earlise' and clone M in their fourth leaf yielded an
   average of 2.5-7.5 kg fruit with 15 kg/tree in one case. Fruit of forced
   cvs. `Burlat', `Souvenir' and `Samba' were larger compared with those of
   cv. `Earlise' and clone M, which were smaller as a result of increased
   fruit load on the tree than those from uncovered control trees. For all
   five cvs tested, except forced cv. `Earlise', a fruit mass of between 10
   g (28 mm) and 12 g (30 mm) and a sugar content of 12-17\% with sugar:
   acid ratios of 20-37:1 made their fruit suitable for marketing as
   superior or premium fruit at higher farm-gate prices of 4.5-8 (sic)/kg.
   Fruits were sufficiently dark red or black and firm for short distance
   transport and rapid sale. An economic evaluation showed financial gains,
   when yields exceed 8 kg fruit per tree per year at a farm-gate price of
   4.50 (sic)/kg.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Pedicularis manifests great variation in corolla morphology,
   including corolla tube length. Previous observations conducted during
   daytime have documented bumblebees to be important pollinators for
   short-and long-tubed Pedicularis species. However, the potential role of
   night-flying long-proboscid insects (moths) as selective agents for the
   evolution of corolla length has not been determined. Three Pedicularis
   species, Pedicularis densispica, Pedicularis gruinea, and Pedicularis
   siphonantha, in montane meadows of Yunnan Province, southwestern China,
   have extremely divergent corolla tube lengths of 7.1, 22.0, and 50.6 mm,
   respectively. We find that all three species are pollinated by similar
   bumblebee species. Pollination treatments indicate that seed sets of
   inflorescences enclosed in fine-meshed nylon nets in the night are not
   different from open-pollinated inflorescences, but those bagged in the
   day have significantly decreased seed set, indicating that moth
   pollinators are not important for the study species. We present
   anatomical evidence that the loss of nectaries in long-tubed species,
   and hence the loss of nectar production, is a derived trait. The loss of
   nectaries may be a key innovation, releasing the corolla from the
   mechanical constraint imposed by pollinators reaching for nectar.}},

Abstract = {{Although habitat fragmentation and agricultural intensification are
   known as threads to pollinator diversity, little is known about
   consequences for population size and genetic diversity. Here, we
   combined detailed field observations, molecular approaches and GIS-based
   quantification of landscape structure (measured by proportions of
   seminatural habitats and proportions of mass flowering crops) to get new
   insights into driving forces of population dynamics of the bumblebee
   species Bombus pascuorum. Comparing 13 agriculturally dominated
   landscape sectors, we found the proportion of mass flowering crops to
   positively influence bumblebee abundance whereas the proportion of
   seminatural habitats was of minor importance. We used microsatellites to
   quantify landscape-related colony densities, inbreeding and population
   substructure. Detected colony densities did not correlate with landscape
   parameters or with local worker abundance, measured by field
   observations. These results indicate that increased worker abundances
   within landscapes are rather due to greater colony sizes than due to an
   increased number of nests. We found significant population substructure,
   measured by F-ST and seven landscape sectors to bear significantly
   increased inbreeding values (F-IS). F-IS was strongly varying between
   sectors but did not correlate with landscape structure. Moreover, F-IS
   had a significantly negative effect on colony size, demonstrating the
   importance of genetic diversity on population fitness at a landscape
   scale. We suggest that inbreeding levels might be related to the
   temporal variation of food resources and population sizes in
   agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Niche theory predicts that species which share resources should evolve
   strategies to minimise competition for those resources, or the less
   competitive species would be extirpated. Some plant species are
   constrained to co-occur, for example parasitic plants and their hosts,
   and may overlap in their pollination niche if they flower at the same
   time and attract the same pollinators. Using field observations and
   experiments between 1996 and 2006, we tested a series of hypotheses
   regarding pollination niche overlap between a specialist parasitic plant
   Orobanche elatior (Orobanchaceae) and its host Centaurea scabiosa
   (Asteraceae). These species flower more or less at the same time, with
   some year-to-year variation. The host is pollinated by a diverse range
   of insects, which vary in their effectiveness, whilst the parasite is
   pollinated by a single species of bumblebee, Bombus pascuorum, which is
   also an effective pollinator of the host plant. The two species
   therefore have partially overlapping pollination niches. These niches
   are not finely subdivided by differential pollen placement, or by
   diurnal segregation of the niches. We therefore found no evidence of
   character displacement within the pollination niches of these species,
   possibly because pollinators are not a limiting resource for these
   plants. Direct observation of pollinator movements, coupled with
   experimental manipulations of host plant inflorescence density, showed
   that Bombus pascuorum only rarely moves between inflorescences of the
   host and the parasite and therefore the presence of one plant is
   unlikely to be facilitating pollination in the other. This is the first
   detailed examination of pollination niche overlap in a plant parasite
   system and we suggest avenues for future research in relation to
   pollination and other shared interactions between parasitic plants and
   their hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Orchids of the genus Ophrys are pollinated by males of solitary bees and
   wasps through sexual deception. Flowers mimic the odor of a receptive
   female and thus attract males that seek to copulate. Visual stimuli have
   been assumed so far to play only a minor role in male attraction. We
   investigated the role of the perigon as a potential visual signal in
   attracting pollinators in the orchid Ophrys heldreichii and its
   pollinator, the males of the long-horned bee Tetralonia berlandi
   (Apidae). In contrast to many other Ophrys species, O. heldreichii
   exhibits a large and bright pinkish perigon that appears visually
   conspicuous to a human observer. In a dual choice test we presented two
   flowers from a single plant and counted visitation rates. We then
   removed the perigon of one flower and retested the relative
   attractiveness of both flowers. For 292 male visits in ten trials we
   found a significant decrease of visitation rate for flowers with the
   perigon removed. In a second experiment we repeated the dual choice test
   using photos of the flowers. Males also significantly chose the picture
   of an intact flower over the picture of a modified flower where the
   perigon was digitally removed. From our data, we conclude that T.
   berlandi males respond to and are attracted by the bright pink perigon
   of the orchid in addition to other stimuli. A bright colorful perigon
   occurs almost only in the Ophrys holoserica-oestrifera group, a large
   sub-group of the genus. We hypothesize that this kind of visual signal
   is adaptive particularly in those Ophrys species where the targeted
   males patrol resourced-based encounter sites and strongly rely on their
   visual system while searching for their females.}},

Abstract = {{Anthesis in individual flowers of Nuphar pumila (Timm) DC. occurs for
   four consecutive days. First-day flowers are protogynous and
   functionally female. Flowers can open completely on the first day of
   anthesis. This contrasts with all previous reports, which state that
   first-day flowers of Nuphar are characterized by partial expansion of
   the calyx, leaving a distal small triangular opening just above the
   stigmatic disc. Flowers close completely on the first night of anthesis
   and remain partially open on the subsequent three nights. During the
   entire anthesis period the stigmas emit a sweet, fruity odor and the
   petal nectaries produce visible nectar drops. The stigma of N. pumila is
   secretory and unicellular-papillate. Pollen grains are monosulcate with
   long spines. Our observations on the mating system of N. pumila indicate
   that neither asexual seed production nor spontaneous self-pollination
   occurs. Cross-pollination of second-, third- and fourth-day flowers
   produced few seeds. Flowers of N. pumila were mainly pollinated by sweat
   bees, with flies playing a minor pollination role. No beetle visits were
   observed. Our insect-pollination observations substantiate the view that
   the relative contribution of flies, bees, and beetles to pollination in
   a single Nuphar population depends on two factors: the relative
   abundance of the insects, and presence of alternative food sources.}},

Abstract = {{Visual floral guides such as colored anthers, lines, dots, and
   UV-absorption patterns on petals are commonly observed in
   insect-pollinated angiosperms. Floral guides that are known to enhance
   foraging efficiency of visitors on flowers thus promote return visits
   (foraging facilitation hypothesis, which predicts that visitors will
   discriminate against flowers with inferior floral guides). In this
   study, we experimentally examined the hypothesis that floral guides also
   prevent pollen-theft behavior by floral visitors (theft prevention
   hypothesis), which has rarely been tested. Nectarless flowers of
   Commelina communis have three types of brightly colored floral organs:
   large blue petals, rewarding yellow anthers, and nonrewarding yellow
   anthers. Colored floral organs were removed artificially from plants in
   two natural populations of C. communis. Removal of the nonrewarding
   yellow anthers diminished hoverings in front of flowers and tended to
   reduce the number of total floral visitor landings, supporting the
   foraging facilitation hypothesis. Additionally, removal of the rewarding
   yellow anther decreased the frequency of legitimate landings on flowers
   and the legitimate landing-to-total landing ratio, which is consistent
   with the theft prevention hypothesis. The nonrewarding anthers and the
   rewarding yellow anthers were shown to play an important role in
   increasing visitor landings and orienting floral visitors toward a
   landing point appropriate for pollination, respectively. We also showed
   that the absence of yellow anthers decreased both pollen dispatch from
   brown anthers and receipt by stigmas in C. communis. These findings
   support both the foraging facilitation hypothesis and the theft

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{99}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Herbivory on floral structures has been postulated
   to influence the evolution of floral traits in some plant species, and
   may also be an important factor influencing the occurrence and outcome
   of subsequent biotic interactions related to floral display. In
   particular, corolla herbivory may affect structures differentially
   involved in flower selection by pollinators and fruit predators
   (specifically, those ovopositing in ovaries prior to fruit development);
   hence floral herbivores may influence the relationships between these
   mutualistic and antagonistic agents.
   Methods The effects of corolla herbivory in Linaria lilacina
   (Scrophulariaceae), a plant species with complex flowers, were
   considered in relation to plant interactions with pollinators and fruit
   predators. Tests were made as to whether experimentally created
   differences in flower structure (resembling those occurring naturally)
   may translate into differences in reproductive output in terms of fruit
   or seed production.
   Key Results Flowers with modified corollas, particularly those with
   lower lips removed, were less likely to be selected by pollinators than
   control flowers, and were less likely to be successfully visited and
   pollinated. As a consequence, fruit production was also less likely in
   these modified flowers. However, none of the experimental treatments
   affected the likelihood of visitation by fruit predators.
   Conclusions Since floral herbivory may affect pollinator visitation
   rates and reduce seed production, differences among plants in the
   proportion of flowers affected by herbivory and in the intensity of the
   damage inflicted on affected flowers may result in different
   opportunities for reproduction for plants in different seasons.}},

Abstract = {{It is important for conservation biologists to understand how well
   species persist in human-dominated ecosystems because protected areas
   constitute a small fraction of the Earth's surface and because
   anthropogenic habitats may offer more opportunities for conservation
   than has been previously thought We investigated how an important
   functional group, pollinators (bees; Hymenoptera: Apiformes), are
   affected by human land use at the landscape and local scales in southern
   New Jersey (USA.). We established 40 sites that differed in surrounding
   landscape cover or local habitat type and collected 2551 bees of 130
   species. The natural habitat in this ecosystem is a forested, ericaceous
   heath. Bee abundance and species richness within forest habitat
   decreased, not increased, with increasing forest cover in the
   surrounding landscape. Similarly, bee abundance was greater in
   agricultural fields and suburban and urban developments than in
   extensive forests, and the same trend was found for species richness.
   Particular species groups that might be expected to show greater
   sensitivity to habitat loss, such as floral specialists and bees of
   small or large body size, did not show strong positive associations with
   forest habitat Nevertheless, 18 of the 130 bee species studied were
   positively associated with extensive forest, One of these species is a
   narrow endemic that was last seen in 1939. Our results suggest that at
   least in this system, moderate anthropogenic land use may be compatible
   with the conservation of many but not all, bee species.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Most pollination biologists have used the collective pollinator
   visits to a plant as the measure of its pollinator attraction. However,
   we know very little about how many returns by the same individuals
   compose these visits, and how far each visitor travels after leaving the
   plant. Such behavioural aspects of individual pollinators are essential
   to understand the patterns of pollen flow among plants.
   2. We observed plant visits by tagged bumble bees Bombus diversus in a
   field population of Cirsium purpuratum. By dissecting the collective
   visitation data into visits made by individual foragers, we addressed
   how `visitor density' (number of individuals that visited a plant per 2
   h) and `individual visitation rate' (number of visits made by each
   individual per 2 h) are related to floral display size (number of
   flowering heads on a plant) and local flower density (number of
   flowering heads on neighbouring plants). We also tracked individual bees
   to determine how display size and local flower density of a plant
   influences its relative position in a bee's foraging area.
   3. Plants attracted both regular visitors (bees that visited a plant
   more than three times per 2 h) and occasional visitors (bees that
   visited a plant fewer than four times per 2 h). Densities of both types
   of visitors increased with floral display size, whereas only occasional
   visitor's density increased with local flower density.
   4. Individual bees preferred to visit central plants within their own
   foraging areas, plants with larger displays, and plants with lower local
   flower density. However, these preferences were independent from one
   another. Plants with large displays were not necessarily chosen by a bee
   as the centre of its own foraging area. On the other hand, plants with
   high local flower density were often located near the centre of a bee's
   foraging area.
   5. The observed pollinator movements have implications for pollen flow
   in the plant population. Plants with larger displays probably experience
   greater mate diversity by attracting more occasional visitors, but they
   also assure matings with particular plants by increasing returns from
   regular visitors.}},

Title = {{Comparing the efficacy of agri-environment schemes to enhance bumble bee
   abundance and diversity on arable field margins}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},

Pages = {{29-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Declines in abundance and diversity of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) in
   Europe have been linked to agricultural intensification and the
   resulting loss of suitable foraging and nesting habitats. Environmental
   Stewardship (ES) is a new scheme in England offering the opportunity to
   restore habitats of value for these important pollinators to
   agricultural land. Scientific evaluation of the options prescribed
   within the scheme is essential to ensure that their objectives are met
   and that the benefits can be realized by the full bumble bee species
   assemblage.
   2. We compared the efficacy of different ES options for field margins on
   arable land in enhancing the abundance and diversity of flowering
   resources and foraging bumble bees. Our study was conducted over 3 years
   using a multisite experiment.
   3. Overall, uncropped margins sown with mixtures containing nectar and
   pollen-producing plants were more effective in providing bumble bee
   forage than margins sown with a grass mix, allowed to regenerate
   naturally or managed as conservation headlands.
   4. A mixture of agricultural legumes established quickly and attracted
   on average the highest total abundance and diversity of bumble bees,
   including the rare long-tongued species Bombus ruderatus and Bombus
   muscorum. However, marked differences were observed between species and
   sexes in their responses to field margin management over time.
   5. A diverse mixture of native wildflowers attracted more of the
   shorter-tongued Bombus spp. and provided greater continuity of forage
   resources, especially early in the season. Allowing Cirsium spp. to
   flower on such margins also increased their attractiveness to male
   bumble bees.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the legume-based
   `pollen and nectar flower mix', as prescribed under Entry Level
   Stewardship in England, can quickly provide a highly attractive forage
   resource for bumble bees, but that issues of seasonal flowering
   phenology and longevity of the mixture need to be addressed.
   Establishment of `floristically enhanced margins' under Higher Level
   Stewardship will be important to provide diverse perennial communities
   of forage plants and to support a greater range of Bombus spp. and other
   pollinators. The population-level responses of bumble bees to introduced
   seed mixtures and other agri-environment options require further study
   in order to maximize the benefits of such schemes in intensively farmed
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{1. Agri-environment schemes promote organic farming in an attempt to
   reduce the negative effects of agricultural intensification on farmland
   biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination. Farming system,
   landscape context and regional differences may all influence
   biodiversity, but their relative impact and possible interactions have
   been little explored.
   2. The study was performed in three regions (150 km apart, 400-500 km(2)
   per region) differing in land use intensity. Within each region, seven
   pairs of conventionally and organically cultivated wheat fields (mean
   size 4 ha, 42 study fields) were selected to encompass a gradient from
   heterogeneous to homogeneous landscapes within a 1-km radius around each
   field.
   3. Farming system had the greatest influence on biodiversity. Higher bee
   diversity, flower cover and diversity of flowering plants were recorded
   in organic compared with conventional fields. Bee diversity was related
   both to flower cover and diversity of flowering plants, suggesting
   plant-mediated effects of the farming system.
   4. Differences in bee diversity between organic and conventional fields
   increased with the proportion of arable crops in the surrounding
   landscape, indicating that processes at the landscape level modified the
   effectiveness of organic farming in promoting biodiversity. Similar
   patterns for flower cover and diversity of flowering plants suggested
   that landscape effects on bee diversity were mainly resource-mediated.
   After statistically removing the variance explained by flower
   parameters, residual bee diversity increased with increasing landscape
   heterogeneity.
   5. Bee diversity differed between the three regions, but the effects of
   farming systems and landscape context were independent of regional
   differences.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Bee diversity in wheat fields was mainly
   influenced by farming system, but an understanding of local bee
   diversity needs to incorporate both landscape and regional perspectives.
   The consistency of the results in three regions provides a reliable
   basis for management decisions. Agri-environment schemes that promote
   organic farming in homogeneous landscapes where there are few remaining
   flower-rich habitats could have the highest relative impact. However,
   while organic farming could help to sustain pollination services by
   generalist bees in agricultural landscapes, other measures are required
   to conserve more specialized bee species in semi-natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{1. In intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, many species are
   confined to very small uncultivated areas such as field margins.
   However, it has been suggested that these small habitat elements cannot
   support viable populations of all the species observed there. Instead,
   species richness and abundance in these small habitat fragments may, at
   least partly, be dependent on dispersal from larger semi-natural
   grassland fragments.
   2. We tested this hypothesis for butterflies and bumble bees in 12
   independent landscapes in a region of intense agriculture in southern
   Sweden. In each landscape we surveyed abundance and species richness in
   one semi-natural grassland, one linear habitat (uncultivated field
   margin) adjacent to this (called proximate) and one similar linear
   habitat (called distant) situated at least 1000 m from the semi-natural
   grassland patch.
   3. Both species richness and density (individuals per unit area) of
   butterflies and bumble bees were significantly higher in proximate
   linear habitats than in distant ones. Moreover, butterfly species
   richness was higher for a given area in grasslands than in any of the
   linear habitat types. Butterfly density in grasslands did not differ
   from that in proximate linear habitats but was lower in distant linear
   habitats. The effect of isolation on density was stronger for less
   mobile butterfly species. For bumble bees there was no difference in
   species richness between grasslands and proximate linear habitats.
   4. For at least some of the butterfly species even these relatively
   small fragments of semi-natural grasslands act as population sources
   from which individuals disperse to the surrounding habitats and thereby
   contribute to higher densities and species richness in adjacent areas.
   For bumble bees, it is more likely that the grasslands contain a higher
   density of nests than the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape,
   and that the density of foraging bumble bees decreases with increasing
   distance from the nest.
   5. Synthesis and application. Habitat fragmentation and intensified
   agricultural practices are considered to be a threat against services
   provided by pollinators. In order to sustain the abundance and diversity
   of insect pollinators in intensively farmed agricultural landscapes, we
   suggest that preservation of the remaining semi-natural grasslands or
   re-creation of flower-rich grasslands is essential.}},

   floral oil were tested on Macropis fulvipes in a biotest. Flower and oil

   ability of bats to discriminate between two nectar volumes in a
   two-alternative forced-choice paradigm. We used a Bayesian inference
   approach to determine psychometric functions. From the derived
   psychometric function we assessed the discrimination threshold at a
   value of 0.69. G. soricina could clearly distinguish between two
   volumes, when the difference between the two nectar volumes divided by
   their average exceeded this value. This indicates that bats possess a

Abstract = {{The Pedicularis species provides ideal materials to study floral
   evolution because of their substantial flower variation based on a
   narrow genetic basis, even though they are almost exclusively pollinated
   by bumblebee. These traits allow us to detect the evolutionary trends of
   floral parameters without considering genetic background and the
   difference of pollination vectors. The pollen-ovule ratio is widely used
   to estimate the pattern of resource investment in two sexual functions
   in flowering plants. Forty species representing all of the corolla types
   in Pedicularis were used to study pollen-ovule ratio, gamete investment,
   and their correlations. Results show that pollen-ovule ratio does not
   differ among both different corolla types and taxonomic groups. It is
   therefore suggested that pollen-ovule ratio should be a parallel
   evolution. The correlations between pollen-ovule ratio and pollen size
   (-), and ovule size (+) can be successfully explained in terms of sex
   allocation theory. The biological significance of such relationships was
   also discussed. Additionally, we analyzed the pattern of resource
   investment into female gamete, which has been somewhat neglected, and
   found that plants have different patterns of gamete investment between
   the two sexual functions.}},

Abstract = {{Hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium L.), a common European umbellifer, is
   very variable in terms of flower and inflorescence morphology. Its
   flowers are visited by numerous insects, yet little is known about the
   importance of the particular insect taxa. I observed umbels of two
   colour morphs (subspecies) of Heracleum sphondylium growing in NE
   Poland, which were visited by more than 108 insect species during two
   study seasons. Analysis of the insects' importance suggests that the
   most efficient pollinators are the medium-sized flies Eriozona
   syrphoides, and Lucilia spp. (Diptera). Bumblebees Bombus terrestris
   (Hymenoptera), beetles of genus Stenurella spp. and Dasytes spp.
   (Coleoptera) and flies Eristalis spp., Meliscaeva cinctella, Phaonia
   angelicae and Thricops nigrifrons also contribute to pollination of the
   studied plants, but their efficiency shows considerable seasonal
   variation. Although the dense umbels of the white flowered H.
   sphondylium subsp. sphondylium are generally more attractive for insect
   visitors than the loose yellowish inflorescences of H. sphondylium
   subsp. sibiricum, these taxa do not seem to attract different sets of
   the pollinators. For both subspecies, flowers in the staminate phase
   were visited significantly more often than those in the pistillate
   phase. Some flower visitors visited the staminate phase only, which
   suggests they may be parasites rather than pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Global conversion of natural habitats to agriculture has led to marked
   changes in species diversity and composition(1). However, it is less
   clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species(2).
   Networks of feeding interactions ( food webs) describe the underlying
   structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to
   their stability and function(3-7). Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food
   webs(8,9) for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across
   five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web
   structure(10,11) across the modification gradient, despite little
   variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies
   declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one
   or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In
   modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species
   and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important
   ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are
   performed by host bees and wasps(12). The most abundant parasitoid
   species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack
   rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to
   discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of
   the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked
   in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions.
   Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and
   functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming is predicted to enhance diversity in agroecosystems.
   This study addresses the question of whether the often observed positive
   effect of organic farming on arable weed and pollinator diversity
   results in a significant shift in arable weed community structure
   towards a higher proportion of insect pollinated species in organic crop
   fields. To examine whether plant community patterns were consistent with
   this hypothesis, arable weed communities were compared with respect to
   the type of pollination (i.e. insect pollination versus non-insect
   pollination) in the edges and centres of 20 organic and 20 conventional
   wheat fields. Plant species numbers of both pollination types were much
   higher in organic than in conventional fields and higher in the field
   edge than in the field centre. A comparison of the proportions of both
   pollination types to all plant species revealed that the relative number
   of insect pollinated species was higher in organic than in conventional
   fields and higher at the field edge than in the field centre, whereas
   the relative number of non-insect pollinated species was higher in
   conventional fields and in the field centre. Our results show that
   insect pollinated plants benefit disproportionately from organic
   farming, which appeared to be related to higher pollinator densities in
   organic fields, whereas in the centres of conventional fields non-insect
   pollinated plants dominate presumably due to a limitation of
   pollinators. Hence, disruption of plant-pollinator interactions due to
   agricultural intensification may cause important shifts in plant
   community structure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{628-634}},
Abstract = {{Most Diuris species possess flowers of pea-like form and colour, and
   occur in association with flowering peas of the tribe Mirbeliae.
   Previous studies of the pollination of Diuris maculata sensu lato have
   found evidence for guild mimicry of pea flowers. The flowers of Diuris
   alba are also pea-like in form but not in colour, and this species is
   frequently found in habitats where peas are uncommon or absent. We
   investigated the pollination of Diuris alba, which we expected may have
   a distinct pollination system at Lake Munmorah, New SouthWales. Many
   Diuris species lack. oral rewards, but D. alba produced a small amount
   of nectar. Flower visitors, and hence putative pollinators, were mainly
   female Exoneura bees, but also the wasps Eurys pulcher and a Paralastor
   species. Reproductive success of D. alba, both in woodland containing
   abundant Dillwynia retorta and in heathland where this pea was absent,
   was higher than in the previously studied D. maculata s.l. We suggest
   that the pollination of D. alba is more generalised than that found in
   the legume guild mimic D. maculata s.l. Although its flowers may display
   structural similarity to pea flowers, other characteristics suggest that
   its pollination system has diverged from a presumed pea-mimicry
   ancestral condition.}},

   causes of global ecosystem disruption. Natural and semi-natural reserve
   areas in agroecosystems are thought to be important for preservation of
   essential ecosystem services such as pollination, but data about land

   populations in canola fields in an agriculturally intense area where
   virtually all land was either tilled agricultural fields or semi-natural
   grazed pasturelands, with the expectation that mosaics of land use types
   may better support ecosystem services than homogenous crop areas. Fields
   were chosen in two categories, five with little or no pastureland (<
   6\%) and five with at least 15\% pastureland within an 800 m distance of
   field edges. Fields in the high pasture category had more bumble bees

   bumble bee abundance in fields was explained by variation in the amount
   of pastureland nearby. Lower bee abundance in fields with little
   pastureland around them could result in reduced pollination and seed set
   unless supplemented with managed pollinators such as honeybees. In areas
   with intense agriculture we show that mosaics of (and use types can be

Abstract = {{Foraging on resources that are fixed in space but that replenish over
   time, such as floral nectar and pollen, presents animals with the
   problem of selecting a foraging route. What can flower visitors such as
   bees do to optimize their foraging routes, that is, reduce return time
   or route distance? Some repeatedly visit a set of plants in a
   significantly predictable sequence (so-called ``trapline foraging{''}),
   which may also enhance their foraging efficiency. A moderate level of
   optimization and repetition of foraging routes can be reached by
   following simple movement rules for choosing the distances and turning
   angles of successive flights, without the use of spatial memory. If
   pollinators can learn the locations of patches and choose among possible
   foraging routes or paths, however, even better performance may be
   achieved. We tested whether and how bumble bees can optimize and repeat
   their foraging routes in laboratory experiments with artificial flowers
   that secreted nectar at a constant rate. With increasing experience,
   foraging routes of bees became more repeatable and efficient than
   expected from a combination of simple movement rules between successive
   flowers. We suggest that trapline foraging is a more sophisticated
   pattern of spatial use than searching and is based on memory. On the
   other hand, certain spatial configurations of flowers hampered
   optimization by the bees; bees preferred to choose short distances over
   straight moves and showed little plasticity in this regard. Developing
   an efficient trapline, therefore, may require prior selection of a set
   of plants with an appropriate spatial configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination by insects in forests is an extremely important process that
   should be conserved. Not only do pollinating insects help to maintain a
   diversity of plants within forests, but they also aid in pollinating
   crops found near forested land. Currently, the effects of various forest
   management practices on floral visiting insect abundance or diversity is
   unknown, so we investigated how prescribed burning, mechanical shrub
   control, and combination of the two affected abundance of floral
   visiting insects. We caught 7921 floral visitors from four orders and 21
   families. Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with
   Halictidae being the most abundant family A total of 45 species of
   Hymenoptera representing six families were captured. We caught seven
   families and 35 species of Lepidoptera, six families and 33 species of
   Coleoptera, and two families and 13 species of Diptera. Most floral
   visitors were captured in the mechanical shrub control plus prescribed
   burn treatments, while lower numbers were caught on the mechanical shrub
   control only, prescribed burn only and control treatments. Overall
   species richness was also higher on mechanical plus burn treatments.
   Total pollinator abundance and the abundance of most orders and families
   was correlated with decreased tree basal area and increased percent
   herbaceous plant cover. Our study shows that floral visitors increased
   in abundance and species richness most from forest disturbance that
   reduced the density of overstory trees and increased the amount of

Abstract = {{The native bee fauna provides an important ecosystem function, but a
   large proportion of this fauna in Europe is threatened as a result of
   habitat loss and fragmentation. The solitary bee Andrena hattorfiana is
   specialised on collecting pollen from the plant-family Dipsacaceae. In
   northern Europe the major pollen resource is the insect-pollinated herb
   Knautia arvensis. We quantified the available K. arvensis resource,
   measured habitat characteristics and performed a flower-visitor survey
   in 57 well-defined K. arvensis populations in southern Sweden. There was
   a strong relationship between bee and plant population sizes. In
   populations with A. hattorfiana present (N=26), the female bees utilised
   on average 39\% (12-80\%) of the total available pollen resource. The
   nest architecture and nesting biology of A. hattorfiana is described for
   the first time. By excavating nests, we found that the provisioning for
   one average bee nest (containing 6 cells) required ca. 72 inflorescences
   or 11 plant individuals. The results suggest a certain minimum pollen
   amount needed to host an A. hattorfiana population. For example, for a
   population of ten reproducing A. hattorfiona female with the average
   degree of utilisation, the critical resource was predicted as 156 +/- 16
   individuals (+/- SE) of the plant K. arvensis, which corresponds to 780
   inflorescences or 36,731,978 pollen grains. These findings suggest that
   calculations via a `pollen budget' can predict critical resources for a
   given size of specialised bee population, and thereby provide a tool in
   conservation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To study the isolation mechanism of two commonly intermingled
   louseworts, Pedicularis rhinanthoides and Pedicularis longiflora,
   pollination biology in three mixed populations with the two species was
   investigated during a 3-year project. The results indicated that higher
   flowering density could help to enhance pollinator activity, and thus
   increase reproductive output. Bumblebees are the exclusive pollinator
   for the two louseworts and are essential for their reproductive success.
   Reproductive isolation between the two species is achieved by a
   combination of pre- and postzygotic isolation mechanisms. Although both
   species are pollinated by bumblebees, the present study indicates they
   successfully avoid interspecific pollen transfer due to floral
   isolation. Mechanical isolation is achieved by the stigma in the two
   species picking up pollen from different parts of the pollinator's body,
   whereas ethological isolation occurs due to flower constancy.
   Additionally, strong postzygotic isolation was demonstrated by non seed
   set after artificial cross-pollination even with successful pollen tube
   growth. We describe the hitherto unreported role of variation in the
   tightness and direction of the twist of the corolla beak in maintaining
   mechanical isolation between Pedicularis species. Although floral
   isolation in Pedicularis is incomplete, it is considered to be an
   important mechanism in maintaining species boundaries in the genus. (c)

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-170}},
Abstract = {{Measurements of trait community composition are known to be sensitive to
   the way species abundance is assessed, but not to what extent. This was
   investigated by considering two of the most commonly used indices of
   community trait composition, trait averages and functional diversity, in
   bee communities along a post-fire environmental gradient. The indices
   were computed using three different species abundance measurements (log
   and unlog number of individuals and species occurrence only) and 5
   traits. For certain traits, the responses of the indices to fire varied
   according to how species abundance was measured. The measurements that
   took species abundance into account in the most distinct way (e.g.,
   occurrence vs. unlog data) produced the least similar results for all
   traits. Species were then grouped into different classes on the basis of
   their relative abundance (i.e., dominants, subdominants, and rare
   species). As a result, the measure that attaches the highest importance
   to the abundance of species (unlog data) related mostly to the dominant
   species traits, while the measure attaching the lowest (i.e., species
   occurrence) related more to rare species traits. Species diversity was
   mostly independent of trait averages and functional diversity,
   regardless of the measure of species abundance used. We also quantified
   functional redundancy (i.e., the potential minus the observed functional
   diversity in each community). When more weight was attached to species
   abundance, redundancy decreased and tended to be less correlated with
   species diversity. Overall, the way species abundance is taken into
   consideration in indices of functional composition offers promising
   insights into the way community assembly mechanisms respond to
   environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land use intensification has caused a considerable decline
   of once common semi-natural habitats leaving only small and isolated
   habitat remnants within a homogeneous landscape matrix. Populations of
   flowering plant species in these remaining habitat fragments are also
   declining and can not offer sufficient resources for potential
   pollinators. The loss of pollinators and consequential pollination
   limitation is especially severe for obligately out-crossing plant
   species. In this study, pollination and reproductive success of
   Hippocrepis comosa was examined. Hippocrepis comosa L is a
   self-incompatible, declining plant species occurring on fragmented
   remnants in semi-natural calcareous grassland habitats in an
   agricultural landscape in Southern Lower Saxony, Germany.
   Plant-pollinator interactions were analysed in small, medium, and large
   plant patches in 15 differently sized calcareous grassland fragments
   surrounded by landscape matrices of differing complexity. Flower
   visitors were observed during three 15-minute observations, pollen
   supplementation experiments were performed to test for pollination
   limitation, and fruits from the plant patches were collected to
   calculate seed set. Hippocrepis comosa showed evidence of pollination
   limitation because hand-pollinated flowers set more seeds per
   inflorescence than open-pollinated flowers and seed set was strongly
   reduced by decreased visitation rates. Pollinators were most abundant in
   large patches and in diverse landscapes. Visitation rate was not
   affected by patch size. Hence, in order to maintain plant-pollinator
   interactions in an agricultural landscape, conservation efforts should
   include the preservation of calcareous grasslands that can support
   sufficiently large patches of a plant species and offer ample rewards
   for pollinators and the establishment of a diverse agricultural
   landscape around the semi-natural habitats that will further enhance
   pollinator abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Flower visitors of several taxa (including bees, butterflies and
   hoverflies) are known to move preferentially between flowers of the same
   species, while neglecting other equally rewarding flower species. Darwin
   proposed memory limitations as a potential mechanistic explanation for
   this flower constancy behaviour. This reanalysis of a previously
   published dataset, relating a real-time sequential analysis of bumblebee
   flower choices to the distance distribution between flowers in a natural
   meadow, shows that Darwin was right in an unexpected way. Bees (Bombus
   spp) can learn how to extract rewards from several flower species, and
   switching between flower species does not compromise their handling
   efficiency (ie flower handling times do not increase following a species
   switch). However, bees do lose time flying between flowers. If a flower
   is encountered within a short time (0-2 sees) after the last flower
   visit, it is likely to be visited only if it is the same species. After
   longer intervals (3-6 sees), bees are more likely to switch to visiting
   different flower species. Thus, flower constancy is in part an effect
   based on comparing incoming stimuli (the flowers a bee detects in
   flight) with a transient form of short-term (working) memory, which
   holds the signal of the last visited flower. The relative weighting of
   working and reference memory changes as time passes following a flower
   visit. This results in a low probability of retrieving the memory for a
   different flower species (from that just visited) within a short time
   interval after the most recent flower visit (0-2 sees). This probability
   rises as the signal of the last visited flower fades from working memory
   (> 2 sees).}},

Abstract = {{Many agricultural greenhouse crops suffer reduced yields due to
   insufficient pollination. This problem can be alleviated by introducing
   efficient pollinating insects into the greenhouse. The bee Xylocopa
   pubescens Spinola 1838, a candidate for domestication as an agricultural
   pollinator, is unique in its facultative social organization. Females
   either nest solitarily, or together with a second female (a
   non-reproducing guard). Social nesting occurs when food and nest sites
   are limited, and carries fitness benefits and costs to the bees as
   compared to solitary nesting. The implications of X pubescens' social
   organization for crop pollination were investigated.
   Honeydew melons were grown as a model crop in a small greenhouse. The
   non-crop plants Portulaca oleracea L, Solanum rantonneiii C, Lavandula
   angustifolia Mill and Ocimum basilicum L supplemented the bees' diet.
   Social and solitary X pubescens nesters were introduced into the
   greenhouse in alternation. The bees' daily activity pattern, the
   frequency and duration of visits to each flower species, and the
   run-lengths of consecutive visits to each flower species were recorded.
   The melons' fruit set, and the fruits' mass and seed number, were
   determined. Social nesters visited P oleracea more frequently than
   solitary bees when this species was in bloom. After P oleracea finished
   blooming, socially nesting bees Visited melon more often than solitary
   nesters.
   Social bees spent a longer time Lit the melon patch and tended to be
   more flower constant than solitary nesters, but spent less time per
   flower than solitary individuals. Solitary and social bees did not
   differ in their daily activity patterns and flower visitation rates.
   Pollination by both types of nesters resulted in similar fruit sets,
   fruit mass and fruit seed numbers.
   The dissimilarities in foraging behaviour may reflect differences in the
   dietary demands of solitary vs social nesters. The similarity in fruit
   sets and flower constancy suggests that both nest types provide
   pollination services of similar quality.}},

Title = {{Adaptive floral colour change in Erysimum scoparium (Brassicaceae) and
   pollinator behaviour of Anthophora alluadii on Tenerife (Hymenoptera :
   Apidae)}},
Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{253-268}},
Abstract = {{Flowering plants manipulate the behaviour of their pollinators in a wide
   range of ways, including exploiting associative learning by changing the
   colour of flowers as they age and at the same time withdrawing the
   nectar reward. This study investigated the adaptive function of the
   floral colour change from white to purple in Erysimum scopanrium
   (Brouss. ex Willd) Wettst in relation to its main pollinator, Anthophora
   alluadii (Perez 1895). Both Species are endemic to the Canary Islands.
   Field observations of nectar production and bee behaviour, plus
   inflorescence and whole plant manipulation experiments at sites in
   Tenerife in 2003,2004 and 2006, provided support for three hypotheses.
   Hypothesis 1: The flower colour change in Escoparium serves as a visual
   signal, indicating to pollinators that the nectar reward of the flower
   has changed. Late phase purple flowers provide much less (and more
   frequently zero) nectar compared to early phase white flowers, and
   pollinators make fewer visits of shorter duration to purple flowers.
   Hypothesis 2: Removal of purple flowers from inflorescences reduced the
   rate of pollinator visitation to white flowers on those inflorescences.
   Retention of late phase, purple flowers therefore increased the visual
   attraction of individual inflorescences, and this short-distance (up to
   tens of centimetres) visual signal directs pollinators to newly opened,
   rewarding flowers on that inflorescence potentially reducing
   geitonogamy. Hypothesis 3: Finally, evidence was found that retention of
   late phase, purple flowers on the plant acted as a long-distance visual
   signal to pollinators, highlighting the presence of plants over scales
   of metres to tens of metres. Removal of all purple flowers from
   individual plants did not result in reduced overall visitation rates to
   those plants, but it did change the relationship between plant size and
   bee visitation rate, from a positive correlation to no significant
   relationship. In relation to experimentally testing the function of the
   floral colour change, previous studies have obtained contrasting
   results. This may be because whole flower colour changes have evolved as
   medium and long range signals, whereas colour change of isolated parts
   of flowers may more often be a short range signal.}},

Title = {{Flower color, nectar standing crop, and flower visitation of butterflies
   in an alpine habitat in central Europe}},
Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGIA GENERALIS}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2-4}},
Pages = {{269-284}},
Abstract = {{In alpine habitats, butterflies constitute one of the major pollinator
   groups, yet little is known about their foraging, behavior and flower
   preferences. At three experimental sites located between 1750 m and 2350
   m asl in the Hohe Tauern National Park, Austria, flower visitation
   behavior of butterflies was observed between spring and late summer. The
   question addressed was: do butterflies search randomly among available
   flowers, or do they prefer certain color types or highly rewarding
   flowers. In particular, the hypothesis to be tested was that red
   non-UV-reflecting flowers, which are assumed to be particularly adapted
   to butterfly vision, are visited disproportionately compared to other
   flower colors.
   Differences in the proportion of inflorescences of a particular color
   visited by butterflies could not be simply attributed to differences in
   frequency or to differences in nectar standing crop. For instance, red
   non-UV-reflecting inflorescences which were prevalent (between 20-50\%
   of all inflorescences) exhibited the highest nectar standing crop per
   inflorescence. However, butterflies did not frequent red inflorescences
   over other differently colored and less rewarding inflorescences. In
   fact, in spring and late summer butterflies visited red inflorescences
   less frequently than expected from random visitation. When viewed from
   the species level, only two of the 6 species, which were selected for
   individual analysis, showed a preference for red flowers (Erebia nivalis
   and Pieris rapae). One species, Colias palaeno, restricted 94\% of all
   observed visits to yellow UV-reflecting inflorescences which were rare
   and exhibited a low nectar standing crop per inflorescence; in contrast,
   Boloria pales visited inflorescences in accordance to their frequency.
   The two remaining species revealed no distinct pattern of flower
   visitation. A detailed discussion of possible reasons for the apparent
   discrepancy between observed foraging behavior and predictions based on
   hypotheses of maximization of individual nectar foraging rate is
   provided.}},

Abstract = {{Pedicularis is one of few genera for which pollination ecology has been
   studied extensively. Although over half of the species of Pedicularis
   are found in the mountains of southwestern China, pollination ecology
   has been studied there on a few species only. The present paper reports
   pollination ecology of Pedicularis rex subsp. lipskyana and P. rex
   subsp. rex from Sichuan, southwestern China. The two subspecies are
   nectariferous, with sugar content 28\% in P. rex lipskyana and 22\% in
   P. rex, respectively. The flowers of the two subspecies are adapted to
   pollination by bumblebee workers. Bumblebees are the primary and
   effective pollinators although honeybees were also observed pollinating
   P. rex subsp. lipskyana at one studied population. Usually bumblebees
   entered the corolla tube from the right side in an upright or a nearly
   half-inverted position to imbibe nectar located at the base of the
   corolla tube. The stigma usually contacts the side region of the thorax
   and abdomen or occasionally directly contacted pollen loads, leading to
   pollination of flowers. Much less commonly, bumblebees foraged on
   flowers of P. rex subsp. rex in an inverted position for pollen, which
   pollinated flowers sternotribically. We suggest that pollination
   mechanism is closely associated with floral morphology. Some important
   differences were found from a previous study on P. rex in floral
   morphology and the primary pollination mechanism. (C) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Strawberry, which used to be typically grown in field conditions, had
   the growth system changed to be produced under protected environment.
   However, the harvested fruits in this system may show a certain
   deformation due to the insects pollination's deficit. In this work the
   strawberry yield was evaluated under protected cultivation, using
   stinglees bees (Meliponinae) Jatai as a pollination agent. Four
   strawberry cultivars (Oso Grande, Tudla, Chandler, and Dover) were
   evaluated in the presence of Tetragonisca angustula L. (Jatai bee),
   using two, four, and no beehives. A completely randomized design in a 4
   x 3 factorial scheme with seven replications and six plants per plot was
   used. The yield of Oso Grande, Tudla, and Chandler cultivars increased
   in the presence of Jatai beehives, in pollination in protected culture.
   The Dover cultivar is not dependent of pollination agent. Under
   protected cultivation the presence of Jatai beehives is indispensable
   for the marketable production of strawberry fruits. A density of four
   beehives with 170 m(2) of protected area is recommended.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Previous observations have suggested that the blueberry bee (Habropoda
   laboriosa,Apidae) is oligolectic on blueberries (Vaccinium sp.) but
   visits a number of secondary plant species for nectar. To examine how
   oligolecty persists in human modified habitats: (1) observations were
   made of plants it visited in both urban and rural habitats, (2) the type
   of pollen on its body was measured when foraging on either Vaccinium or
   Gelsernium, and (3) foraging behavior on Vaccinium, Gelsemium, and
   Azalea was studied across an rural/suburban/urban land use gradient in a
   foraging preference experiment.
   Male and female blueberry bees were recorded foraging on a wide range of
   plants in urban, suburban, and rural areas for both pollen and nectar.
   Female bees collected pollen from five genera in four families. Pollen
   on male and female bees collected on either Vaccinium or Gelsemium was
   predominantly from the species from which it was collected, but many
   specimens had both pollen types present. There were significant
   differences in foraging preferences among the three plant species and
   between gender. Overall, females preferred Gelsemium to Vaccinium, but
   males showed the opposite pattern. For both females and males, Azalea
   was the least preferred. Variation in the local abundance of flowers
   among the sites was not related to foraging preference. The foraging
   patterns of H. laboriosa in the landscape of human modified ecosystems
   suggests that H. laboriosa may be a mesolectic bee, using pollen from a
   few unrelated species, as opposed to a narrow oligolege (using pollen
   from only a few related species of Vaccinium). The preference for
   Gelsemium among female bees suggests that plantings of Gelsemium might
   be useful in enhancing populations of H. laboriosa in blueberry
   cultivation.}},

   one species present characters associated with hummingbird pollination,
   although some of these ornithophiles are also visited by insects.
   center dot The ornithophiles are scattered throughout the traditional
   taxonomy and across phylogenies estimated from nuclear ( internal
   transcribed spacer ( ITS)) and chloroplast DNA ( trnCD/ TL) sequence
   data. Here, the number of separate origins of ornithophily is estimated,
   using bootstrap phylogenies and constrained parsimony searches.
   center dot Analyses suggest 21 separate origins, with overwhelming
   support for 10 of these. Because species sampling was incomplete, this
   is probably an underestimate.
   center dot Penstemons therefore show great evolutionary lability with
   respect to acquiring hummingbird pollination; this syndrome acts as an
   attractor to which species with large sympetalous nectar- rich flowers
   have frequently been drawn. By contrast, penstemons have not undergone
   evolutionary shifts backwards or to other pollination syndromes. Thus,
   they are an example of both striking evolutionary lability and
   constrained evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Although theoretical models predict low allocation to attractive
   structures with increased selling in animal-pollinated plants, empirical
   measurement of the reproductive costs and benefits is complicated.
   Here, floral sex allocation was compared in two nectarless heterandrous
   species with different mating systems: Monochoria korsakowii
   (Pontederiaceae), which has moderate outcrossing rates, and Monochoria
   vaginalis, a predominant selfer. In both species, mirror-image flowers
   have one large dark-purple anther and five small yellow anthers.
   Experimental evidence is provided for functional differences between the
   two sets of anthers using data on pollinator visitation, pollen removal
   and deposition, and seed set after hand pollinations.
   Flower manipulations in bee-pollinated M. korsakowii demonstrated
   different functions of the two sets of anthers: the yellow (feeding)
   anthers function to attract pollinators, but have similar pollen
   performance to the purple (pollinating) anthers. Furthermore, a
   disproportional reduction in pollen production of the feeding anthers in
   the selling species was found. This differential allocation between
   feeding and pollinating anthers in heterandrous species has not been
   recognized before.
   The finding of reduced allocation to attractive structures with an
   increase in the rate of self-fertilization supports the theory of sex
   allocation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines a cryptic species complex comprising three nominal

   alpha (EF-1 alpha), and 28S. In addition, the distribution patterns and
   phenology of all species were examined. Fixed substitutions
   distinguishing the three species are present in EF-1 alpha and ITS-2.
   Their distribution patterns differ clearly: Colletes halophilus is
   endemic to coastal habitats of the southern North Sea and the English
   Channel; Colletes hederae occurs from Slovenia in the southeast to
   southern England in the northwest; the range of Colletes succinctus
   covers most of Europe and reaches western Kazakhstan. Where the three
   species occur jointly in western Europe, their flight activities differ
   significantly. The genetic distinctions and the differences in
   distribution, phenology and Rower specialisation clearly support their

Abstract = {{The bumble and cuckooo bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombini; Bombus spp.
   and Psithyrus spp., respectively) are important plant pollinators and
   any decline in numbers or species constitutes a significant threat both
   to biological diversity and to whole economies. The distribution, status
   and factors threatening all 60 known taxa (species and subspecies) of
   Bombini of 11 countries of Western and Central Europe (Belgium, the
   Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czech
   Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland) were assessed from the beginning of
   the 20th century. The analysis was based on a literature review,
   unpublished data, personal communications, our own observations, and an
   expert review. The IUCN Red List categories were used for assessing the
   threat of extinction. Eighty per cent of taxa were threatened in at
   least one country of the region, and 30\% of taxa were threatened
   throughout their range in the countries considered. More species went
   extinct per country in the second than in the first half of the 20th
   century, and four taxa went extinct in all 11 countries during
   1951-2000. Amongst the factors adversely affecting the Bombini
   anthropogenic factors (particularly those associated with large-scale
   farming schemes) appear to be of greater importance than natural
   factors. To halt population declines and species extinctions it will be
   necessary to preserve aspects of traditional farming practices and for
   all Bombini to be afforded legal protection in all countries of the
   region. The implementation of the European Union's Common Agricultural
   Policy is likely to have the greatest single impact upon pollinators in
   the near future.}},

Abstract = {{From March 2001 to December 2002, we studied the reproductive phenology,
   pollination ecology, and growth rates of Espeletia grandiflora Humb. and
   Bonpl. (Asteraceae), a giant caulescent rosette from the PSramos of the
   Eastern Andes of Colombia. Espeletia grandiflora was found to be
   predominantly allogamous and strongly self-incompatible. Bumblebees
   (Bombus rubicundus and e. funebris) were the major pollinators of E.
   grandiflora, although moths, hummingbirds, flies, and beetles also
   visited flowers. Inflorescence development began in March and continued
   through August to September. Plants flowered for 30-96 days with a peak
   from the beginning of October through November. The percentage of
   flowering plants strongly differed among size classes and between both
   years. Seed dispersal occurred as early as September through May of the
   following year. The average absolute growth rate for juveniles and
   adults rate was 7.6 cm/year. Given the scarcity of floral visitors at
   high altitudes due to climatic conditions, we suggest that even small
   contributions from a wide range of pollinators might be advantageous for
   pollination of E. grandiflora. Long-term studies on different
   populations of E. grandiflora are required to determine if the high
   growth rates are representative, to quantify the variation in the
   flowering behavior within and among populations, and to establish if
   nocturnal pollination is a trait that is exclusive to our population of
   E. grandiflora.}},

Abstract = {{Tomato apical stunt viroid (TASVd) has been reported as a devastating
   pathogen of greenhouse tomato in Israel. This isolate shares 92 and 99\%
   identity with the Ivory Coast type strain and an Indonesian strain,
   respectively. No information is available regarding the epidemiology of
   this viroid complex. The present study indicates that TASVd is not
   transmitted by the aphid Myzus persicae or the whitefly Bemisia tabaci,
   nor through root infection in infested soil. However, the results
   indicate that the viroid may be able to invade the embryonic tissues of
   the seed and transmission rates through seed may reach 80\%. Moreover,
   it was confirmed that bumble bees (Bombus terrastris) can transmit the
   viroid from infected tomato source plants to healthy plants. Based on
   these findings, it is suggested that the primary spread of the viroid in
   greenhouse tomato plants is by seed transmission, and secondary
   distribution occurs by the pollination activity of bumble bees.}},

Abstract = {{The Neotropical group of Ericaceae offers a variety of floral displays.
   Here we present data on floral characteristics and breeding system of
   Disterigma stereophyllum, a Neotropical epiphyte Ericaceae abundant in
   semi-disturbed areas with pollinator unpredictability. Floral
   characteristics are intermediate between those typical of bee- and
   hummingbird-pollinated plants: the corolla is short, white, and
   urceolate, but the composition and amount of nectar are similar to those
   typically observed in hummingbird-pollinated species. Plants are capable
   of autonomously self-pollination, but manual outcrossing yielded more
   than twice as many fruits as self hand-pollination did. Moreover,
   outcross pollen grows more rapidly than self pollen down the style. Our
   results provide another example of a species with a ``mixed pollination
   syndrome{''} which is cryptically self-incompatible and preferably
   attracts high-energy pollinators (hummingbirds), but which can also
   profit from small bee visitors and retains the ability to self-pollinate
   just in case. We hypothesize that interaction among several factors,
   including self pollinating possibility, and the capacity to attract a
   wide pollinator spectrum, may result in a lack of strong selection for a
   bee vs. a hummingbird floral morphology, thus allowing the persistence
   of mixed floral traits in these ericads. The maintenance of these traits
   may enhance the ability of this species to colonize semi-disturbed
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees, the most important pollinators of several native plant
   species are widespread in Brazil. Many studies have described the
   morphological aspects of the insects' midgut, the main site of chemical
   digestion and nutrient absorption. In this work, we used scanning
   electron microscopy to describe and compare the ultrastructure of the
   midgut in individuals from different castes of Melipona quadrifasciata
   anthidioides. The midgut of these bees has two layers of muscular
   fibers: a circular one, involved in the formation offolds, and an
   external, longitudinal layer. The peritrophic membrane was thicker and
   homogeneous in the presence of food. Microvilli were evident on the
   surface of the main cells. We have not found morphological differences
   in the midgut among individuals from the castes analysed. Our analyses
   corroborate previous descriptions made with light microscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM).}},

Abstract = {{Endemic to the southern Roggeveld Plateau in Northern Cape, South
   Africa, Romulea syringodeoflora (Iridaceae: Crocoideae) is an
   acaulescent geophyte with pink, salver-shaped, odorless flowers with a
   narrow, elongate perianth tube 18-25 mm long. The stamens are exserted
   from the tube and have brown anthers prominently displayed on filaments
   +/- 4.5 mm long. The perianth tube contains 0.7-1.2 mu l of nectar in
   the lower half with a mean concentration of 23.5\% sucrose equivalents.
   The flowers are visited systematically by an unnamed species of
   Prosoeca, a long-proboscid fly in the family Nemestrinidae, and
   occasionally by the butterfly Cynthia cardui (Nymphalidae) and the
   anthophorine bee Amegilla spilostoma (Apidae). The flies have a
   proboscis 10.5-11.5 mm long, which when inserted into the floral tube
   reaches the nectar held within the lower half of the tube. The frons and
   the proximal part of the head of the Prosoeca sp. contact the anthers
   during feeding, and the flies accumulate visible quantities of brown
   pollen during foraging bouts. Observations showed that these insects
   also contacted the stigmatic surfaces of style branches during this
   activity. Amegilla bees, which occasionally visit Romulea flowers, have
   a tongue 7 mm long and fail to reach the nectar when they insert their
   proboscis into the tube. Because of their small size they do not brush
   against the anthers or style branches when they attempt to forage. These
   observations confirm our prediction of long-proboscid fly pollination in
   this species of Romulea, based on the floral morphology of the species,
   and expands the range of plant species known to have flowers adapted for
   pollination by this group of insects. (c) 2006 SAAB. Published by

Title = {{Labellar micromorphology of Bifrenariinae Dressler (Orchidaceae)}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},

Volume = {{98}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The two closely related subtribes Bifrenariinae
   Dressler and Maxillariinae Benth. are easily distinguished on
   morphological grounds. Recently, however, molecular techniques have
   supported the inclusion of Bifrenariinae within a more broadly defined
   Maxillariinae. The present paper describes the diverse labellar
   micromorphology found amongst representatives of Bifrenariinae
   (Bifrenaria Lindl., Rudolfiella Hoehne, Teuscheria Garay and Xylobium
   Lindl.) and compares it with that found in Maxillaria Pabst \& Dungs and
   Mormolyca Fenzl (Maxillariinae).
   Methods The labella of 35 specimens representing 22 species of
   Bifrenariinae were examined by means of light microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy and their micromorphology compared with that of
   Maxillaria sensu stricto and Mormolyca spp. The labellar epidermis of
   representatives of Bifrenaria, Xylobium and Mormolyca was tested for
   protein, starch and lipids in order to ascertain whether this tissue is
   involved in the rewarding of pollinators.
   Key Results and Conclusions The labella of Bifrenaria spp. and Mormolyca
   spp. are densely pubescent but those of Xylobium, Teuscheria and
   Rudolfiella are generally papillose. However, whereas the trichomes of
   Bifrenaria and Mormolyca are unicellular, those found in the other three
   genera are multicellular. Hitherto, no unicellular trichomes have been
   described for Maxillaria, although the labella of a number of species
   secrete a viscid substance or bear moniliform, pseudopollen-producing
   hairs. Moniliform hairs and secretory material also occur in certain
   species of Xylobium and Teuscheria and these genera, together with
   Maxillaria, are thought to be pollinated by stingless bees (Meliponini).
   Differences in the labellar micromorphology of Bifrenaria and Mormolyca
   are perhaps related to Euglossine- and/ or bumble bee-mediated
   pollination and pseudocopulation, respectively. Although Xylobium and
   Teuscheria share a number of labellar features with Maxillaria sensu
   stricto, this does not necessarily reflect taxonomic relationships but
   may be indicative of convergence in response to similar pollinator
   pressures.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollinator-mediated selection on traits associated with mechanical
   fit and attraction of pollinators were investigated through both sexual
   functions in Cyclopogon elatus (Sw.) Schlechter (Orchidaceae).
   2. Only halictid bees, principally Augochlora nausicaa, were observed as
   pollinators. The pollinarium becomes attached to the ventral surface of
   the bee's mouthparts (labrum) when the proboscis, which closely matches
   the length of floral tube, is projected into the flower to reach nectar.
   3. We detected directional selection on nectary depth, with deeper
   nectaries favoured only through male fitness, because this trait affects
   pollinaria removal but not deposition. Correlational selection was
   detected through male function between nectary depth and the number of
   flowers in an individual's floral display These traits affect
   pollination in a multiplicative way: flower number is positively related
   to the number of bee visits, and nectary depth positively affects the
   effectiveness of pollinaria removal at each visit.
   4. We also detected stabilizing selection on display size. For smaller
   displays there was a strongly positive association between number of
   flowers and overall reproductive success, which can be attributed to a
   simple numerical effect. However, the expected performance of individual
   flowers is impaired in large displays by pollinator limitation, because
   bees visiting the display pollinate few flowers per visit and each bee
   carries, at most, one pollinarium.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The transfer of pollen among flowers is an important determinant of
   mating patterns in plants, and considerable attention has been devoted
   to understanding animal-mediated pollen transfer and its causal
   mechanisms. Conventionally, pollen carryover has been envisioned as a
   one-step process, but a pollen grain's journey may not be so simple.
   Potentially, pollen deposited on a flower's stigma could be remobilized
   and transferred to the stigma of a second flower. Alternatively, pollen
   may be deposited on unreceptive floral surfaces, such as petals, by
   either a pollinator or the wind and then remobilized and transferred to
   the stigma during a pollinator visit.
   2. We quantified the potential for secondary dispersal of pollen by
   bumble bees (Bombus terrestris L.) visiting flowers of Brassica napus
   L., chosen because it typifies a generalized animal-pollinated flower
   and because of concern about pollen escaping from genetically modified
   varieties in agriculture.
   3. We tested whether genetically marked pollen that was initially
   deposited by a bumble bee on a flower's stigma could later be
   transferred by another bee and thereby fertilize ovules on a different
   flower. In a second experiment, we tested whether marked pollen
   deposited on a flower's petals (as if by a pollinator or the wind) could
   later be transferred to the stigma by a bee and thereby fertilize the
   flowers ovules. In both experiments, the numbers of genetically marked
   progeny were recorded and a model was developed to quantify the relative
   effectiveness of direct vs secondary pollen dispersal.
   4. Our analysis revealed that only small numbers of pollen grains
   achieved secondary dispersal by a pollinator, and that the probability
   of fertilization being achieved through secondary dispersal was minute.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1115-1123}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Animal-pollinated plants influence their mating success through
   characteristics of their individual flowers and the arrangement of
   flowers into inflorescences. Previous studies of inflorescence function
   have focused on flower number, so the influences of traits of individual
   flowers on pollinator attraction and self-pollination between flowers
   remain unknown.
   2. To investigate the effects of flower size and number on pollinator
   attraction and behaviour on inflorescences, we reduced the perianth size
   of flowers of Delphinium bicolor Nuttall and Delphinium glaucum S.
   Watson.
   3. Reduction in flower size decreased the number of visits per
   inflorescence by bumble bees (Bombus spp.), but increased the number of
   probes per visit. In contrast, both attraction and probes per visit
   increased in a decelerating manner with number of open flowers. The
   average number of probes per flower, which combines the effects of
   pollinator attraction and behaviour on inflorescences, did not differ
   significantly between small- and large-flowered plants, or with flower
   number.
   4. The absence of significant variation among plants with different
   floral and inflorescence characteristics in visits per flower and nectar
   standing crop per flower indicate that bees achieved an ideal free
   distribution.
   5. Our results suggest that large flowers reduce the incidence of
   geitonogamous pollination without reducing the frequency of probes per
   flower.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of monkey beetles (Hopliini, Scarabeidae) as
   pollinators of Asteraceae and Aizoaceae in the Succulent Karoo as well
   as the influence of livestock grazing on their abundance and diversity
   was investigated. Hopliine beetles proved to be the, or among the, most
   abundant flower visitors of 12 investigated plant species. However,
   during single flower observations at three Aizoaceae species, bees
   (Apoidea), bee flies (Bombyliidae) and pollen wasps (Masaridae) were the
   most frequent flower visitors. However, monkey beetles carried the
   highest Asteraceae and Aizoaceae pollen loads, and are therefore
   considered to play a vital role in the pollination of these two
   families. Abundance, species richness and diversity of Hopliini did not
   appear to be heavily affected by livestock grazing. Annual variation in
   the composition of monkey beetle populations was more dramatic. Still,
   some species showed higher abundances on heavily grazed rangeland while
   others only occurred under low grazing pressure. It is presumed that
   changes in the composition of the vegetation, especially the observed
   decrease of perennial plants in favour of annuals and geophytes (Todd
   and Hoffman 1999) could in turn affect the composition of monkey beetle
   assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation may severely affect survival of social insect
   populations as the number of nests per population, not the number of
   individuals, represents population size, hence they may be particularly
   prone to loss of genetic diversity. Erosion of genetic diversity may be
   particularly significant among social Hymenoptera such as bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.), as this group may be susceptible to diploid male
   production, a suggested direct cost of inbreeding. Here, for the first
   time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a
   threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly
   fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population
   sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range
   21-72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss
   of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic
   structuring between populations (theta = 0.084) was found, but evidence
   of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across
   highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where
   this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in
   allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in
   the continental population. While not directly related to population
   size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between
   UK populations relative to continental populations. We suggest that
   populations now existing on isolated habitat islands were probably
   linked by stepping-stone populations prior to recent habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Establishment of polyploid individuals within diploid populations is
   theoretically unlikely unless polyploids are reproductively isolated,
   pre-zygotically, through assortative pollination. Here, we quantify the
   contribution of pollinator diversity and foraging behaviour to
   assortative pollen deposition in three mixed-ploidy populations of
   Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae). Diploids and tetraploids were not
   differentiated with respect to composition of insect visitors. However,
   foraging patterns of the three most common insect visitors (all bees)
   reinforced assortative pollination. Bees visited tetraploids
   disproportionately often and exhibited higher constancy on tetraploids
   in all three populations. In total, 73\% of all bee flights were between
   flowers of the same ploidy (2x-2x, 4x-4x); 58\% of all flights to
   diploids and 83\% to tetraploids originated from diploid and tetraploid
   plants, respectively. Patterns of pollen deposition on stigmas mirrored
   pollinator foraging behaviour; 73\% of all pollen on stigmas (70 and
   75\% of pollen on diploid and tetraploid stigmas, respectively) came
   from within-ploidy pollinations. These results indicate that pollinators
   contribute to high rates of pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. If
   patterns of fertilization track pollen deposition, pollinator-plant
   interactions may help explain the persistence and spread of tetraploids
   in mixed-ploidy populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plant reproductive success within a patch may depend on plant

   factorial design with two levels of intraspecific aggregation for both a
   rewardless orchid and a rewarding co-flowering species. Our results show
   that increasing aggregation of both species negatively influenced the
   reproductive success of the rewardless plants. To our knowledge, this is
   the first experimental study demonstrating negative effects of
   aggregation on reproductive success of a rewardless species due both to
   its own spatial aggregation and that of a co-flowering rewarding

Abstract = {{Ceriops decandra is a shrubby mangrove species, which shows budding,
   flowering and fruiting continuously throughout the year. It is an
   obligate outcrosser and fruit set occurs only in the presence of

   adapted for pollination during daytime by Nomia bees and Odynerus wasps.
   The plant shows a high per cent of bud and flower abortion. Fruit
   abortion is absent, but only one ovule produces seeds in all flowers.
   Abortion at different stages of the reproductive unit is considered to
   be a strategy to adjust the available maternal resources to the growing
   fruits and seedlings. The seedling characteristics suggest true
   vivipary, but the seedlings stay on the maternal parent for a short
   period, which is a characteristic of cryptoviviparous mangrove species.
   Viviparous growth is considered to be an adaptive strategy for seedlings

Abstract = {{Plant biologists have an enduring interest in assessing components of

   examined the roles of resource and pollen availability on seed set by
   the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. We were able to
   distinguish the relative contributions of carbon (photosynthate) and
   mineral nutrients (nitrogen) to reproductive success. We also determined
   potential pollinators of this species. The bees Bombus affinis and
   Augochlorella aurata and the fly Fletcherimyia fletcheri were the only
   floral visitors to S. purpurea that collected pollen. Supplemental
   pollination increased seed set by < 10\%, a much lower percentage than
   would be expected, given data from noncarnivorous, animal-pollinated
   taxa. Seed set was reduced by 14\% in plants that could not capture prey
   and by another 23\% in plants whose pitcher-shaped leaves were also

Abstract = {{We model the optimal foraging strategies for 2 nectarivore species,
   differing in the length of their proboscis, that exploit the nectar
   provided by 2 types of flowers, differing in the depths of their
   corollas. When like flowers appear in clumps, nectarivores must decide
   whether to forage at a patch of deep or shallow flowers. If nectarivores
   forage optimally, at least one flower type will be used by a single
   nectarivore species. Long-tongued foragers will normally visit deep
   flowers and short-tongued foragers shallow flowers, although extreme
   asymmetries in metabolic costs may lead to the opposite arrangement.
   When deep and shallow flowers are randomly interspersed, nectarivores
   must decide, on encounter with a flower, whether to collect its nectar
   or continue searching. At low nectarivore densities, the optimal
   strategy involves exploiting every encountered flower; however, as
   nectarivore densities increase and resources become scarce, long-tongued
   individuals should start concentrating on deep flowers and short-tongued
   individuals on shallow flowers. Therefore, regardless of the spatial
   distribution of flowers, corolla depth can determine which nectarivore
   species exploit the nectar from each flower type in a given community.
   It follows that corolla elongation can evolve as a means to keep nectar
   thieves at bay if short-tongued visitors are less efficient pollinators
   than long-tongued visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination provided by bees enhances the production of many crops.
   However, the contribution of wild bees remains unmeasured for many
   crops, and the effects of anthropogenic change on many bee species are
   unstudied. We experimentally investigated how pollination by wild bees
   affects tomato production in northern California. We found that wild
   bees substantially increase the production of field-grown tomato, a crop
   generally considered self-pollinating. Surveys of the bee community on
   14 organic fields that varied in proximity to natural habitat showed
   that the primary bee visitors, Anthophora urbana Cresson and Bombus
   vosnesenskii Radoszkowski, were affected differently by land management
   practices. B. vosnesenskii was found primarily on farms proximate to
   natural habitats, but neither proximity to natural habitat nor tomato
   floral abundance, temperature, or year explained variation in the
   visitation rates of A. urbana. Natural habitat appears to increase B.
   vosnesenskii populations and should be preserved near farms. Additional
   research is needed to determine how to maintain A. urbana.
   Species-specific differences in dependency on natural habitats
   underscore the importance of considering the natural histories of
   individual bee species when projecting population trends of pollinators
   and designing management plans for pollination services. Thus, to
   maintain an entire bee community, multiple approaches, including
   maintaining natural habitat, should be implemented. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Plants that lack floral rewards may nevertheless attract pollinators if
   their flowers sufficiently resemble those of rewarding plants. Flowers
   of the South African terrestrial orchid Disa nervosa are similar in
   floral dimensions and spectral reflectance to those of a sympatric
   nectar-producing irid (Watsonia densiflora s.l.). Observations showed
   that the orchid and Watsonia share the same pollinator, a long-proboscid
   tabanid fly Philoliche aethiopica. These flies visited inflorescences of
   both species during their foraging bouts and most (64\%) observed or
   captured on Watsonia inflorescences carried pollinaria of the orchid on
   their proboscides. They probe an average of 6.3 flowers on Watsonia
   inflorescences, but just 1.9 flowers on the Disa inflorescences, a
   behaviour which would strongly promote cross-pollination in the
   self-compatible orchid. The orchid generally achieves high levels of
   pollination success, with approximately 50\% of flowers receiving or
   exporting pollen at some sites. Pollination success was also high at one
   site that lacked Watsonia plants, suggesting that the orchid does not
   have an obligate dependence on Watsonia. Its pollination system may
   therefore be characterized as intermediate between generalized food
   deception and specific floral mimicry.}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar is offered by plants to animals as a reward for
   pollination. While nectar is typically a clear liquid containing sugar
   and trace amounts of amino acids, colored nectar has evolved in several
   plant families. Here we explore the functional significance of the
   phenolic compounds that impart a dark brown color to the nectar of the
   South African succulent shrub Aloe vryheidensis. Flowers of this aloe
   are visited for their nectar by a suite of short-billed birds that are
   occasional nectarivores, including bulbuls, white-eyes, rock thrushes,
   and chats. Dark-capped Bulbuls were more likely to probe model flowers
   containing dark nectar than those containing clear nectar, suggesting a
   potential signaling function for dark nectar. However, the main effect
   of the phenolics appears to be to repel ``unwanted'' nectarivores that
   find their bitter taste unpalatable. Nectar-feeding honey bees and
   sunbirds are morphologically mismatched for pollinating A. vryheidensis
   flowers and strongly reject its nectar. However, the frugivorous and
   insectivorous birds that effectively pollinate this aloe are seemingly
   unaffected by the nectar's bitter taste. Thus the dark phenolic
   component of the nectar appears to function as a floral filter by
   attracting some animals visually and deterring others by its taste.}},

Abstract = {{We adopted a comparative approach to evaluate whether pollination
   (floral) syndromes serve to partition the pollinator fauna among four
   coflowering species of morning glories (Ipomoea, Convolvulaceae). Two of
   the species (I. hederacea and I. trichocarpa) fit the ``bee{''}
   syndrome: they produce blue and purple flowers that have large corolla
   openings, and they secrete smaller volumes of concentrated nectar. The
   other two (I. quamoclit and I. hederifolia) exhibit the ``bird{''}
   syndrome: they have reddish flowers and narrow, tubular corollas, and
   they secrete larger volumes of dilute nectar. The pollinator fauna of 11
   species of lepidoptera, bees, and hummingbird did not visit Ipomoea
   species in proportion to their relative abundance. The bumblebees
   foraged exclusively on the blue-flowered I. hederacea and I.
   trichocarpa, and the hummingbirds visited only the red-flowered I.
   hederifolia and I. quamoclit, while the lepidopterans exhibited less
   preference for a specific syndrome type. As a group, the Ipomoea species
   tended to be quite specialized in their use of pollinators. Ca. 75\% of
   the visits to the blue-flowered I. hederacea and I. trichocarpa were by
   bumblebees, while ca. 80\% of visits to I. quamoclit and I. hederifolia
   were by sulfur butterflies. Our results support the notion that
   pollination syndromes do aid in partitioning the pollinator fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Rhynchanthus beesianus W. W. Smith (Zingiberaceae) is an epiphytic
   tropical ginger with a very conspicuous floral display, but almost no
   fruit set under field conditions. The reproductive ecology encompassing
   phenology, floral biology, and pollination and breeding systems was
   investigated in an evergreen broad-leaved forest in Yunnan Province,
   Southwest China. The flowers possess a typical bird pollination
   syndrome, but no effective pollinators were observed during 138 h of
   observation. Female Black-breasted Sunbird (Aethopyga saturata) and
   bumblebees visited R. beesianus regularly, but they all played roles as
   nectar robbers. No fruit was found in the bagging treatment, and fruit
   set following manual self-pollination ((57.55 +/- 4.08)\%) was
   comparable with cross-pollination ((64.32 +/- 4.42)\%), suggesting that
   R. beesianus is self-compatible but spontaneous self-pollination in this
   species does not occur. Seed set of open-pollination ((26.42 +/-

Abstract = {{Mast seeding is common in plant populations, but its causes have rarely
   been tested experimentally. We tested mechanisms of alternate-year
   flowering and fruit set in an iteroparous, bee-pollinated, herbaceous
   plant, Astragalus scaphoides, in semi-arid sagebrush steppe. Patterns of
   reproduction from 1986 to 1999 indicated that spring precipitation was a
   cue for synchronous flowering, and that increased pollination in
   high-flowering years was a fitness advantage of synchrony. We tested
   these patterns by adding supplemental water and pollen to plants in
   high- and low-flowering sites and years. Supplemental water had no
   effect on flowering or seed set, so water is not a proximate cue for
   reproduction, though it could be important over longer (> 3 year) time
   scales. Supplemental pollination increased fruit set in low- but not
   high-flowering years, indicating that synchronous flowering increases
   pollination success. Many shorter-term studies also report increased
   fruit set after pollen supplementation, but not after resource addition.
   This pattern may reflect the fact that plants can store and reallocate
   resources, but not pollen, across multiple years. For animal-pollinated
   herbs such as these, uniting theories about pollination ecology and mast
   seeding may promote an understanding of the mechanisms that determine
   patterns of reproduction over time.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of three mass flowering Utricularia species of
   the Indian Western Ghats, U. albocaerulea, U. purpurascens, and U.
   reticulata, was studied for the first time by extensive observation of
   flower visitors, pollination experiments, and nectar analyses. The
   ephemerality of the Utricularia habitats on lateritic plateaus, weather
   conditions adverse to insects, lack of observations of flower visitors
   to other Utricularia spp., and the predominance of at least. facultative
   autogamy in the few Utricularia species studied so far suggested that an
   autogamous breeding system is the common case in the genus. In contrast,
   we showed that the studied populations are incapable of autonomous
   selfing, or that it is an event of negligible rarity, although P/O was
   similarily low as in autogamous species investigated by other authors.
   In all three species the spatial arrangement of the reproductive organs
   makes an insect vector necessary for pollen transfer between and within
   flowers. However, U. purpurascens and U. reticulata are highly
   self-compatible, which allows for visitor-mediated auto-selfing and
   geitonogamy on inflorescence and clone level. Floral nectar is present
   in extremely small volumes in all three species, but sugar
   concentrations are high. More than 50 species of bees, butterflies,
   moths, hawk moths, and clipterans were observed to visit the flowers,
   and flower morphology facilitated pollination by all observed visitors.
   The results are discussed in the context of the phenological
   characteristics of the studied species, especially the phenomenon of
   mass flowering, and the environmental conditions of their habitats.}},

Abstract = {{To test whether the nectarless flowers of Cypripedium tibeticum attract
   pollinators through mimicry like the allied species C. macranthos var.
   rebunense, pollination biology of C. tibeticum was investigated in
   western China. Although C. tibeticum was also pollinated by bumble bee
   queens, i.e. Bombus lepidus, B. lucorum and B. hypnorum, no special,
   rewarding model plants were found in the habitat. Field experimentation
   confirmed that the flowers were self-compatible but insects were
   required to transfer orchid pollen to the stigma. Both Bombus queens and
   workers were visitors, but queens were much more frequent than workers
   and only queens were effective pollinators. Floral functional morphology
   analysis showed that it was large queens rather than small workers that
   fitted well with the flowers of C. tibeticum. With the faint
   sweet-fruity scent, the minor floral fragrance compound, ethyl acetate,
   probably plays a role in attracting bumble bees by food deception. The
   dark flowers with the inflated, trap-like labellum are hypothesized to
   mimic the nest site of queens. Therefore, bumble bee queens tend to be
   attracted by C. tibeticum through nest site mimic combined with food
   deception. Considering that the co-blooming flowers of C. flavum are
   pollinated by the Bombus workers, and C. smithii pollinated by a queen,
   we suggest that using the same bumblebees with different body sizes as
   the pollinators is the main reproductive isolation between interfertile
   C. tibeticum and C. flavum, while C. tibeticum and C. smithii tend to
   hybridize naturally.}},

Abstract = {{Bees, the largest (> 16,000 species) and most important radiation of
   pollinating insects, originated in early to mid-Cretaceous, roughly in
   synchrony with the angiosperms (flowering plants). Understanding the
   diversification of the bees and the coevolutionary history of bees and
   angiosperms requires a well supported phylogeny of bees (as well as
   angiosperms). We reconstructed a robust phylogeny of bees at the family
   and subfamily levels using a data set of five genes (4,299 nucleotide
   sites) plus morphology (109 characters). The molecular data set included
   protein coding (elongation factor-1 alpha, RNA polymerase II, and LW
   rhodopsin), as well as ribosomal (28S and 18S) nuclear gene data.
   Analyses of both the DNA data set and the DNA+morphology data set by
   parsimony and Bayesian methods yielded a single well supported
   family-level tree topology that places Melittidae as a paraphyletic
   group at the base of the phylogeny of bees. This topology
   ({''}Melittidae-LT basal{''}) is significantly better than a previously
   proposed alternative topology ({''}Colletidae basal{''}) based both on
   likelihood and Bayesian methods. Our results have important implications
   for understanding the early diversification, historical biogeography,
   host-plant evolution, and fossil record of bees. The earliest branches
   of bee phylogeny include lineages that are predominantly host-plant
   specialists, suggesting that host-plant specificity is an ancestral
   trait in bees. Our results suggest an African origin for bees, because
   the earliest branches of the tree include predominantly African
   lineages. These results also help explain the predominance of
   Melittidae, Apidae, and Megachilidae among the earliest fossil bees.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{168}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Paleontological and phylogenetic studies have shown that floral
   zygomorphy (bilateral symmetry) has evolved independently in several
   plant groups from actinomorphic (radially symmetric) ancestors as a
   consequence of strong selection exerted by specialized pollinators. Most
   studies focused on unraveling the developmental genetics of flower
   symmetry, but little is known about the adaptive significance of
   intraspecific flower shape variation under natural conditions. We
   provide the first evidence for natural selection favoring zygomorphy in
   a wild population of Erysimum mediohispanicum ( Brassicaceae), a plant
   showing extensive continuous variation in flower shape, ranging from
   actinomorphic to zygomorphic flowers. By using geometric morphometric
   tools to describe flower shape, we demonstrate that plants bearing
   zygomorphic flowers received more pollinator visits and had the highest
   fitness, measured not only by the number of seeds produced per plant but
   also by the number of seeds surviving to the juvenile stage. This study
   provides strong evidence for the existence of significant fitness
   differences associated with floral shape variation in E.
   mediohispanicum, thus illuminating a pathway for the evolution of
   zygomorphy in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Male orchid bees (Euglossini) collect fragrances from flowers and other
   natural sources, a behaviour that has shaped the euglossine pollination
   syndrome. Males store such chemicals in hind leg pouches and later

   complex bouquets of two sympatric species of Eulaema, E. meriana and E.
   bombiformis, are chemically distinct. When exposed during bioassays at
   display perches individual hind leg extracts rapidly and consistently
   attracted other males of the correct species, even if derived from males
   of disparate localities (French Guiana and Panama). Conspecific males as
   well as females of E. bombiformis arrived at natural perch sites only
   from downwind, and two copulations were observed. Our findings
   demonstrate that acquired odours mediate exclusive attraction within
   species and support the idea that such fragrances are pheromone
   analogues. Their role in acquiring matings and during male-male

Abstract = {{We assessed national scale changes in the forage plants of bumblebees in
   Britain, as a means of providing quantitative evidence for the likely
   principal cause of declines in bumblebee species. We quantified the
   relative value of native and long-established plant species as forage
   (nectar and pollen) resources for bumblebees by collating visitation
   data from 14 field sites across Britain. Twentieth Century changes in
   range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from
   the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930-1969 to 1987-1999)
   and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978-1998). Forage plants
   declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the
   two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes
   in other native plant species, reflecting serious reductions in quality
   of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in
   insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined
   in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium
   pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We
   consider how our findings relate to other recorded changes in the
   British flora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and
   how they could contribute to a conservation strategy. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   Several studies at the landscape level have found a positive
   relationship between the diversity of floral resources and the diversity
   and abundance of pollinators. However, little is known about the
   relationship between these trophic levels on a smaller spatial scale,
   and the importance of blossom density relative to plant species richness
   in predicting abundance and richness of different flower visitor groups.
   2. This study used a small-scale approach to investigate how, and if,
   the diversity and abundance of floral resources in study plots affected
   the visitation activity of different flower visitor groups. During 201
   observation periods between late May and mid-August 2003, 3682 visits
   were observed. Bumblebees (60\%), muscoids (17\%), syrphids (9\%), and
   beetles (5\%) were the most abundant flower visitors.
   3. Regression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between
   blossom density and plant species richness with visitation activity,
   including the probability of presence in plots, the visits within plots,
   and the visitor richness of the most abundant pollinator groups.
   4. The activity of beetles, bumblebees, and muscoids was positively
   predicted by the variation in blossom density, while syrphid activity
   was better predicted by plant species richness. Overall, the models for
   beetles and bumblebees explained much more of the variation in activity
   compared with the models for the dipterans, and blossom density was a
   better predictor of both flower visitor richness and activity than was
   plant species richness.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of foraging bumblebees, Bombus terrestris L.
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae), was studied in a greenhouse planted with two
   cultivars of tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum Mill. (Solanaceae), in two
   patches. In both patches, bumblebee densities per square meter were
   measured on plots, and the results showed that their densities were
   nearly similar. The densities of available flowers, their pollen
   production, and availability also were measured. Our results showed
   that, although the cultivars greatly differed in flower density, flower
   morphology, and pollen production, their pollen availability (i.e.,
   pollen actually collected by bumblebees per square meter) was
   approximately the same. Therefore, the mean quantities of pollen
   collected per bumblebee were similar in each patch. Knowing that
   bumblebees do not visit different varieties randomly, our results
   suggest that the major factor affecting the bumblebee distribution among
   patches was the density of available resource. Results are discussed
   both from an applied point of view and in relation to the assumptions of
   the ideal free distribution theory.}},

   144 bee species (26 genera), 22 vespid species (9 genera) and 23
   crabronid species (12 genera). Noteworthy records are detailed. A
   preliminary checklist of the bee fauna of the BRF is presented and

   the state, and of the northeastern USA as a whole. The cleptoparasitic
   species Sphecodes fattigi Mitchell, Sphecodes johnsonii Lovell, and
   Lasioglossum (Dialictus) michiganense (Mitchell), and the oligolectic
   species Osmia (Melanosmia) inermis (Zetterstedt) are newly recorded from

Abstract = {{Agricultural conversion is one of the most prevalent anthropogenic uses

   thought to be related to species-specific characteristics such as life
   history traits and dispersal distance. In an agricultural landscape in
   California, we examined local (farm-level) and landscape variables
   associated with nesting preferences of native ground-nesting bees.
   Compared to the known ground-nesting visitors to crops, bee community
   nesting on farms was depauperate. Further, more abundant and diverse
   communities of bees were found nesting at farms with patches of natural
   habitat near by than farms that were far away from natural habitat.
   Species responded differently to soil conditions created by farming
   practices, but the variability in nesting bee abundance was lower in
   farms near natural habitat than farms far from natural habitat. These
   findings suggest that most bee species are affected adversely but to
   varying degrees by agricultural intensification, and that natural
   habitats may buffer against the bee population variability in
   agricultural landscape. We present source/sink dynamics and resource
   limitations as possible explanations for the observed patterns.}},

   available on the nectar rewards of flowers they visit or their
   consumption of them, because small quantities of nectar are difficult to
   extract and measure. We studied five such plants in deciduous forests
   and agricultural fields in west-central Indiana, USA: three native
   forest herbs {[}Claytonia virginica L., Dentaria laciniata Muhlenb. ex
   Willd., Erigenia bulbosa (Michaux) Nutt.] and two exotic agricultural
   weeds {[}Barbarea vulgaris R. Br., Stellaria media L. (Vill.)], which
   often grow in close proximity. Using spectrophotometry, we measured
   daily sugar accumulation (in caged flowers) and standing crops (in
   uncaged flowers) at two sites on four dates per species. Dentaria
   laciniata was the most rewarding species (mean daily accumulations:
   185-404 mu g sugar/ flower), followed by moderately rewarding B.
   vulgaris and C virginica (24-113 mu g sugar/flower) and low-rewarding E.
   bulbosa and S. media (7-38 mu g sugar/flower). The presence of species
   with similar rewards in both habitats suggests that generalist bee and
   fly species can be expected to forage in both. Each flower species
   showed much variation in mean sugar accumulation per flower among
   population samples and among individual plants. Solitary bees were the
   most common visitors to all species (47 to 81\% of visitation), followed
   by flies and honey bees. Insects consumed much, but not all (45 to 90\%)
   of daily nectar accumulation by the five species. The more sugar a
   flower population secreted, on average, the higher its standing crop;
   visitation did not reduce rewards to a common level.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the breeding system and pollinators of Nebraska populations

   species appears to be one of the few known self-incompatible species of
   Penstemon: few self-pollinated flowers set fruit and few of these
   produced seeds. We found no indication that sexual reproduction was
   limited by inadequate pollination or resources. Pollinators were several
   species of native bees which varied from population to population and
   from year to year; there did not appear to be a consistent P. haydenii
   pollinator fauna. Flowers were pollinated mainly by large apid bees in
   the genera Habropoda and Bombus, by (mostly) smaller halictid bees, and
   by intermediate sized megachilid bees, particularly in the genus Osmia.
   One frequent flower-visitor, the presumed Penstemon specialist, Hoplitis
   pilosifrons (Megachilidae), may be more of a pollen-parasite than a
   pollinator because it commonly collected pollen into the scopa but
   carried very little pollen on other body parts. Management plans for

Abstract = {{Flower herbivory and pollination have been described as interactive
   processes that influence each other in their effects on plant
   reproductive success. Few studies, however, have so far examined their
   joint effects in natural populations. In this paper we evaluate the
   influence of flower damage and pollination by the hummingbird
   Oreotrochilus leucopleurus on the fecundity of the Andean monkey flower
   Mimulus luteus. We performed a 2x2 factorial experiment, with artificial
   clipping of lower petals and selective exclusion of the hummingbird as
   main factors. In spite of the relatively low proportion (27.5\%) of the
   variance in seed production accounted for by the full factorial model,
   artificial damage and hummingbird exclusion, as well as their
   interaction, were highly significant, indicating nonadditive effects of
   factors on plant fecundity. In the presence of hummingbirds, undamaged
   flowers had a seed production that was 1.7-fold higher than for damaged
   flowers, suggesting that the effect of flower damage on female
   reproductive success occurs probably as a consequence of hummingbird
   discrimination against damaged corollas. This result indicates that the
   impact of flower herbivory on plant fecundity was contingent on the
   presence or absence of hummingbirds, suggesting that pollinators may
   indirectly select for undamaged and probably resistant flower
   phenotypes. A second interaction effect revealed that undamaged flowers
   produced 78.5\% more seeds in the absence of rather than in the presence
   of O. leucopleurus, raising the question of the ecological mechanism
   involved. We suggest that the strong territorial behavior exhibited by
   the bee Centris nigerrima may confine the foraging activities of the
   remaining bee species to safe sites within exclosures. Overall, our
   results provide evidence that hummingbird pollination and flower
   herbivory have interdependent effects on M. luteus fecundity, which
   indicates that it will be difficult to predict their ecological and
   evolutionary consequences unless interactions are analyzed in an
   integrated form.}},

Abstract = {{Plant reproduction is often reduced at low densities, due to reduced
   pollinator visitation rates. Recent theory suggests that a
   disproportionate increase in pollinator visits to patches of plants as
   heterospecific plant density increases (i.e. if visitation is a sigmoid
   function of patch density) can rescue sparse populations of a focal
   plant species from reduced reproductive success or population decline. A
   field experiment was performed to determine the shape of the pollinator
   visitation response to patches of differing density of the common weed
   Brassica rapa. Both the aggregative and functional response for the
   entire pollinator community were saturating rather than sigmoid,
   indicating that pollinator response does not accelerate when density
   increases. The results for the entire pollinator community were
   consistent among temporal and spatial replicates. Aggregative response
   curves for specific pollinator taxa were either linear (bombyliid flies)
   or saturating (syrphid flies, solitary bees, and Lepidoptera).
   Functional responses for these taxa were saturating (syrphid flies and
   solitary bees) or flat (bombyliid flies and Lepidoptera). Individual
   pollinators visited more plants during foraging bouts in high-density
   patches, but visits per plant decreased. Seeds per fruit and seeds per
   flower increased with increasing density. There is no evidence that
   pollinators disproportionately visit denser patches, or that the
   conditions for this mechanism of pollination facilitation are likely to
   be met in this generalist pollinator system.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the amino acid (AA) composition of the floral nectars of 73
   plant species occurring in a phryganic (East Mediterranean garrigue)
   community and investigated whether AA and sugar composition is shaped by

   effect of summer drought) and coevolutionary (pollinator partnership)
   constraints. Our study utilised an extensive plant-pollinator matrix
   compiled in the same area where the plants had been sampled.
   Using HPLC we detected 22 AA compounds/groups of compounds, out of which
   15 were commonly present in almost all nectars. Among all AAs,
   phenylalanine was the most abundant, especially in keystone
   ({''}cornucopian{''}) plant species visited by many insect species, such
   as the majority of the Lamiaceae. Amino acid quantities were transformed
   into percentages (\% of each AA over the total AA content of a flower).
   Sugar composition was similarly expressed as \% of each of the three
   sugars (glucose, fructose, sucrose) over the total content of these
   sugars; a number of other sugars, occurring in only a few plant species
   and in very low quantities were disregarded. The number of insect
   species of a particular family or guild was taken as a measure of the
   attraction of a nectar compound for such a family (guild).
   We found that taxonomical plant group had a weakly significant effect on
   nectar composition while neither life form nor flowering season had a
   discernable effect. Pollinators' preference had the most important
   effect, with phenylalanine being the most consequent discriminatory
   compound for the response of the nectar consumers in phrygana,
   predominantly for long tongued bees, especially for Megachilidae.
   Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) had a similar, even stronger influence on
   bees (long tongued bees, Anthophoridae, Andrenidae) and flies (Syrphidae
   and other Diptera), whereas asparagine behaved as a general repellent
   together with tryptophane (rather as repellent). Considering total sugar
   and AA contents, as well as the volume of nectar, we found that total AA
   content was positively related to the number of species of long tongued
   bees and included families visiting the phryganic species; nectar volume
   was negatively related to flies (both hover flies and remaining
   Diptera), whereas total sugar content was not significant for any guild.
   We argue that due to the highly concentrated nectars in the dry
   Mediterranean communities that are characterised by outstanding
   melittophily, sugars play a less important role as phagostimulants
   compared to AAs in floral nectars. This is why phenylalanine, a
   phagostimulant tested earlier on honeybees, appears to be of high
   importance in phrygana, especially with long tongued bees and
   Megachilids as the main selective agents for phenylalanine-rich nectars.
   The role of GABA, a strongly NaCl-dependent AA, may be similar, probably
   because of the associated presence of NaCl.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated epiphytic growth of the fire blight bacterium, Erwinia
   amylovora, on flowers of plant species common to landscapes where pears
   and apples are grown. The plants were from genera regarded as important
   nectar and pollen sources for pollinating insects: Acer, Amelanchier,
   Brassica, Cytisus, Populus, Prunus, Rubus, Salix, Taraxacum, Trifolium,
   and Symphoricarpos. Floral bouquets were inoculated with E. amylovora
   and incubated in growth chambers at 15 degrees C for 96 h. Regardless of
   their susceptibility to fire blight, all species from the rose family
   except Prunus domestica (European plum) supported epiphytic populations
   of E. amylovora that exceeded 1 X 10(6) CFU/flower with relative growth
   rates for the populations that averaged 7\% per hour. Nonrosaceous
   plants were generally poor supporters of epiphytic growth of the fire
   blight pathogen with relative growth rates averaging < 4\% per hour. In
   two seasons of field inoculations, the rosaceous non-disease-host
   plants, Prunus avium (sweet cherry) and Rubus armeniacus (Himalayan
   blackberry), yielded mean population sizes of E. amylovora that exceeded
   1 x 10(6) CFU/flower; in contrast, at 8 days after inoculation, mean
   population sizes of the pathogen were in the range of 5 x 10(3) to 5 x
   10(4) CFU/flower on Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom) and < 1 X 10(2) CFU
   on Acer macrophylum (big leaf maple). Because vectors of E. amylovora,
   principally bees, visit many kinds of flowers in landscape areas between
   pear and apple orchards, flowers of rosaceous, non-disease-host species
   could serve as potential sites of inoculum increase during their periods
   of bloom.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative behaviors are common among social insects such as bees,
   wasps, ants, and termites, but they have not been reported from insect
   species that use aggressive mimicry to manipulate and exploit prey or
   hosts. Here we show that larval aggregations of the blister beetle Meloe
   franciscanus, which parasitize nests of the solitary bee Habropoda
   pailida, cooperate to exploit the sexual communication system of their
   hosts by producing a chemical cue that mimics the sex pheromone of the
   female bee. Male bees are lured to larval aggregations, and upon contact
   (pseudocopulation) the beetle larvae attach to the male bees. The larvae
   transfer to female bees during mating and subsequently are transported
   to the nests of their hosts. To mimic the chemical and visual signals of
   female bees effectively, the parasite larvae must cooperate, emphasizing
   the adaptive value of cooperation between larvae. The aggressive
   chemical mimicry by the beetle larvae and their subsequent transport to
   their hosts' nests by the hosts themselves provide an efficient solution
   to the problem of locating a critical but scarce resource in a harsh
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Unfavorable temperatures and weather conditions for biotic pollination
   in above-tree-line alpine habitats predict self-compatibility, high
   levels of autogamy and small flower size ({''}autogamy reproductive
   assurance hypothesis{''}), or alternatively, compensatory measures such
   as greater flower longevity and larger display size so as to capture
   scarce visits and maintain outcrossing ({''}increased pollination
   probability hypothesis{''}). We assess these possibilities in a
   fine-tuned study of Chaetanthera euphrasioides (Asteraceae) populations
   located above-tree-line in the Andes of central Chile, where prior,
   independently obtained information on community flower visitation rates
   is available. Visitation by flies and Andrenid bees was highly erratic
   in all populations and among years, and the rates well below the
   community averages. We found evidence for high levels of
   self-compatibility, equally high autogamous potential, low genetic
   diversity and high and similar F-IS in all populations studied,
   associated with no clear trends in floral morphology. Strong decoupling
   of C. euphrasioides reproductive biology with community-level pollinator
   availability in the alpine fails to support either of the
   above-mentioned hypotheses and suggests early acquisition of autogamy
   with present-day pollinator conditions being adequate to maintain low
   visitation rates at all elevations. Our study provides the only instance
   where alternative hypotheses on alpine breeding systems have been tested
   with prior access to independently quantified community-level flower
   visitation rates. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The timing and effectiveness of pollinator visitation to flowers is an
   important factor influencing mating patterns and reproductive success.
   Multiple pollinator probes to a flower may increase both the quantity
   and genetic diversity of progeny, especially if single probes deposit
   insufficient pollen for maximal seed set or if the interval between
   probes is brief. When pollen carryover is limited, sequential pollen
   loads may also differ markedly in sire representation. We hypothesized
   that these conditions help explain high levels of multiple paternity in
   Mimulus ringens fruits. We documented all bee visits to individual
   flowers, quantified resulting seed set, and determined paternity for 20
   seeds per fruit. Most (76\%) flowers received multiple probes, and the
   interval between probes was usually < 30 min. Flowers probed multiple
   times produced 44\% more seeds than flowers probed once. All fruits were
   multiply sired. Flowers receiving a single probe averaged 3.12 outcross
   sires per fruit, indicating that single probes deposit pollen from
   several donors. Multiple paternity was even greater after three or more
   probes (4.92 outcross sires), demonstrating that sequential visits bring
   pollen from donors not represented in the initial probe.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{center dot Background and Aims Loasaceae subfam. Loasoideae are mostly
   distributed in South America (sea level to over 4500 m) with a wide
   range of animals documented as pollinators. The aim was to investigate
   correlations between nectar parameters, flower morphology, pollination
   syndrome and phylogeny.
   center dot Methods Nectar was collected from 29 species from seven
   genera in the subfamily. Concentration and volumes were measured and the
   amount of sugar calculated. Correlations of nectar data were plotted on
   a ternary graph and nectar characteristics compared with flower
   visitors, floral morphology and phylogenetic data.
   center dot Key Results Sugar concentrations are generally higher than
   reported for most plant families in the literature. The species
   investigated can be roughly grouped as follows. Group I: plants with
   approx. 1.5(-3.5) mu L nectar with (40-)60-80 \% sugar and 0.19-2 mg
   sugar flower(-1); with small, white, star-shaped corollas, pollinated by
   short-tongued bees. Groups II, III and IV: plants with mostly orange,
   balloon-, saucer-, bowl- or bell-shaped corollas. Group II: plants with
   approx. 9-14 mu L nectar with 40-60 \% sugar and 4-10 mg sugar
   flower(-1); mostly visited by long-tongued bees and/or hummingbirds.
   Group III: plants with 40-100 mu L nectar with 30-40 \% sugar and 14-36
   mg sugar flower(-1), mostly visited by hummingbirds. Group IV:
   geoflorous plants with 80-90 mu L with 10-15 \% sugar and 8.5-12 mg
   sugar flower(-1), presumably visited by small mammals. Groups II and III
   include species visited by bees and/or hummingbirds.
   center dot Conclusions Pollinator switches from short-tongued bees via
   long-tongued bees to hummingbirds appear to have taken place repeatedly
   in the genera Nasa, Loasa and Caiophora. Changes in nectar amount and
   concentration appear to evolve rapidly with little phylogenetic
   constraint.}},

   mellea. Here, we report the symbiotic and parasitic associations of some
   insects with this orchid. The flowers are nectarless and were visited by
   females of a halictid bee, Lasioglossum sp. The bees entered the tubular
   flower and collected the tissue from the orchid's labellum. Pollinia
   were attached to the hind thorax of the bee and transported to the
   stigma of receptive flowers. The stems and corms of the orchid were
   infested by two rare dipterans, Azpeytia shirakii Hurkmans (Syrphidae)
   and a new genus and species of scatophagid, Orchidophaga gastrodiacola
   n. sp. M. Kato. Adult flies of the latter species laid eggs in the
   flower. The hatched larvae infested the immature ovary, bored downward
   into the flowering stem, and occasionally entered the underground corms.
   The high rate of infestation by these dipterans suggests that the robust
   flower stem of the orchid has evolved as counteradaptation against these
   particular stem-boring dipterans. A molecular phylogenetic analysis
   suggests that O. gastrodiacola belongs to Delininae, which is one of the
   basal groups of Scatophagidae.}},

Abstract = {{Qualitative reproductive traits of 84 plant species belonging to 41
   families were studied in tropical dry evergreen forest on the Coromandel
   coast of India. Majority of species had rotate type, white-coloured,
   scented flowers, rewarding nectar and pollen and pollinated chiefly by
   bees. An association between floral traits and pollination spectrum is
   evident. Bee pollination was prevalent in pollination systems. Among the
   fruit types, drupe and berry were common in black and red colour
   respectively, and dispersed by zoochorous mode. Seeds of brown- and
   green-coloured dry fruits, without any reward were disseminated by wind
   and explosion. The reproductive phenophase of trees and lianas occurred
   mostly during the dry period from January to June, which receives
   rainfall of less than 50 mm a month. However, shrubs showed a peak in
   flowering and fruiting in wet period. Detailed phenological observations
   of 22 woody species revealed a seasonal and unimodal pattern in
   flowering. Although some species were in flower round the year,
   flowering activity was skewed towards the dry season. The fruiting
   activity showed a bimodal pattern, one peak in dry season and another in
   wet season. Many species displayed a temporal aggregation in flowering
   and fruiting. The significant relation was obtained between reproductive
   traits and phenology of plants in the tropical dry evergreen forest.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized pollination systems may be advantageous on island systems or
   regions of substantial disturbance. We examined whether or not
   specialization breakdown has occurred in a presumably bat-pollinated
   columnar cactus, Pilosocereus royenii, on Puerto Rico, an island
   subjected to periodic hurricanes. The flowers show characteristics
   related to bat pollination including nocturnal anthesis, morphology, and
   amount and quality of nectar reward. The cactus produces flowers whose
   styles are temporally and mechanically separated from its anthers and do
   not self-pollinate. Hand manipulations indicated that it is partially
   self-incompatible or suffers some inbreeding depression. In 217 h of
   observations conducted biweekly over the course of 1 yr, P. royenii
   received visits from bats, moths, bees, and birds, but the only
   effective pollinator was the carpenter bee, Xylocopa mordax. Only four
   bat visits were recorded, all prior to stigma receptiveness. Floral
   morphology of P. royenii was significantly more variable than that of
   other bat-pollinated species of the genus. We propose that infrequent
   bat visits are a consequence of a population crash and that floral
   variability is due to either relaxed selection for bat pollination or a
   transitional stage from bat pollination to bee pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Managing rare endemic plants often requires an understanding of their

   seed dispersal, and seedling recruitment of Rudbeckia auriculata
   (Asteraceae), a species endemic to the Southeastern United States. Based
   on observations of pollinator abundance and pollen load on floral
   visitors, the most likely pollinators are primarily native bees,
   particularly Andrena aliciae Robertson in medium and large populations
   of R. auriculata, and Halictids in small populations. Seed set varied
   from 0.24\% to 16.9\% in small populations (< 40 flowering stems) and
   from 26.5\% to 31.4\% in medium (40-999 flowering stems) and large
   (1000+ flowering stems) populations, with significantly lower seed set
   in the small populations. Exclusion of visitors from inflorescences
   showed that, like many members of the Asteraceae, R. auriculata is
   probably self-incompatible. Seed dispersal appears to be highly
   localized and dependent upon gravity. Seedling recruitment is poor,

Abstract = {{There has been a great deal of disagreement surrounding the capacity of

   reviews the conflicting findings of previous surveys of the invasion of

   austral summer. From this, it is clear that B. terrestris has
   extensively invaded Tasmanian native vegetation. The new data provide
   strong evidence that B. terrestris is breeding in native vegetation in
   every region of Tasmania. More than 10 bumblebees were seen in one day
   at 153 locations in native vegetation, including 42 locations within 10
   National Parks and 38 locations within the Tasmanian Wilderness World
   Heritage Area. Nests of B. terrestris were also found within two
   National Parks. These findings suggest that B. terrestris would also
   invade native vegetation in non-arid temperate regions of the Australian
   mainland, if it is introduced there.}},

   tunnel, with only one cell in the vertical position at the end, which
   was 25 cm to 50 cm away from the entrance. Nocturnal activity was

Abstract = {{The main aims of this study were to assess grazing impacts on bee
   communities in fragmented mediterranean shrubland (phrygana) and
   woodland habitats that also experience frequent wildfires, and to
   explain the mechanisms by which these impacts occur. Fieldwork was
   carried out in 1999 and 2000 on Mount Carmel, in northern Israel, a
   known hot-spot for bee diversity. Habitats with a range of post-burn
   ages and varying intensities of cattle grazing were surveyed by transect
   recording, grazing levels, and the diversity and abundance of both
   flowers and bees were measured. The species richness of both bees and
   flowers were highest at moderate to high grazing intensities, and
   path-analysis indicated that the effects of both grazing and fire on bee
   diversity were mediated mainly through changes in flower diversity, herb
   flowers being more important than shrubs. The abundance of bees
   increased with intensified grazing pressure even at the highest levels
   surveyed. Surprisingly though, changes in bee abundance at high grazing
   levels were not caused directly by changes in flower cover. The
   variation in bee abundance may have been due to higher numbers of
   solitary bees from the family Halictidae in grazed sites, where
   compacted ground (nesting resource) and composites (forage resource)
   were abundant. The effects of grazing on plants were clearest in the
   intermediate-aged sites, where cattle inhibited the growth of some of
   the dominant shrubs, creating or maintaining more open patches where
   light-demanding herbs could grow, thus allowing a diverse flora to
   develop. Overall, bee communities benefit from a relatively high level
   of grazing in phrygana. Although bee and flower diversity may decrease
   under very heavy grazing, the present levels of grazing on Mount Carmel
   appear to have only beneficial effects on the bee community.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity to temporal information and the ability to adjust behavior
   to the temporal structure of the environment should be phylogenetically
   widespread. Some timing abilities, such as sensitivity to circadian
   cycles, appear in a wide range of invertebrate and vertebrate taxa {[}1,
   2]. Interval timing-sensitivity to the duration of time intervals-has,
   however, only been shown to occur in vertebrates {[}3, 4]. Insect
   pollinators make a variety of decisions that would appear to require the
   ability to estimate elapsed durations. We exposed bumble bees to
   conditions in which proboscis extension was reinforced after a fixed
   duration had elapsed or after either of two fixed durations had elapsed.
   Two groups of bees were trained with a short duration (either 6 s or 12
   s) and a long duration (36 s) in separate experimental phases
   (independent timing groups), whereas two other groups were trained with
   a short duration (either 6 s or 12 s) and long duration (36 s) always
   intermixed unpredictably (multiple timing groups). On long intervals,
   independent timing groups waited longer than mixed timing groups to
   generate the first response and responded maximally near the end of the
   interval. Multiple timing groups waited the same amount of time on
   average before generating the first response on both long and short
   intervals. On individual trials, multiple timing groups appeared to time
   either the long duration only or both the short and long durations: most
   trials were characterized by a single burst of responding that began
   between the short and long duration values or by two bursts of
   responding with the first burst bracketing the short value and the
   second burst beginning in anticipation of the long value. These results
   show that bumble bees learn to time interval durations and can flexibly
   time multiple durations simultaneously. The results indicate no
   phylogenetic divide between vertebrates and invertebrates in interval
   timing ability.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Various alien species have been introduced to the
   Ogasawara Islands (Japan). A survey was made investigating whether the
   native pollination systems fit an `island syndrome' (biasing the flora
   to dioecy, with subdued, inconspicuous flowers) and whether alien
   species have disrupted the native pollination network.
   Methods Flower visitors and floral traits were determined in the field
   (12 islands) and from the literature. Associations among floral traits
   such as sexual expression, flower colour and flower shape were tested.
   Key Results Among the 269 native flowering plants, 74.7\% are
   hermaphroditic, 13.0\% are dioecious and 7.1\% are monoecious.
   Classification by flower colour revealed that 36.0\% were white, 21.6\%
   green and 13.8\% yellow. Woody species (trees and shrubs) comprised
   36.5\% of the flora and were associated with dioecy and white flowers.
   Solitary, endemic small bees were the dominant flower visitors and
   visited 66.7\% of the observed species on satellite islands where the
   native pollination networks are preserved. In contrast to the situation
   on the satellite islands, introduced honeybees were the most dominant
   pollinator (visiting 60.1\% of observed species) on the two main
   islands, Chichi-jima and Haha-jima, and had spread to satellite islands
   near Chichi-jima Island.
   Conclusions The island syndrome for pollination systems in the Ogasawara
   Islands was evident in a high percentage of dioecious species, the
   subdued colour of the native flora and solitary flower visitors on
   satellite islands. The shape and colour adaptations of several flowers
   suggested native pollination niches for long-proboscis moths and
   carpenter bees. However, the domination and expansion of introduced
   honeybees have the potential for disruption of the native pollination
   network in the two main, and several satellite, islands of the Ogasawara
   Islands.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Oxalis debilis is a South American tristylous
   species that is currently naturalizing in China. Based on field
   observations and herbarium data a report is made on its pollination,
   morph frequencies, pollen viability, seed set and chromosome number. In
   addition, a new chromosome count for the species in Africa is provided.
   Methods Field observations were conducted in six provinces in south-east
   China. Flower visitors were recorded and nectar sugar was measured with
   a refractometer. The species' compatibility system was determined by
   carrying out experimental self- and cross-pollinations on bagged
   inflorescences. Stigma receptivity and pollen viability was determined
   using the MTT test.
   Key Results and Conclusions Populations of O. debilis in China contain
   either the mid-style-length morph or the short morph, but not both.
   Pollination is by nectar- and pollen-foraging bees; pollen viability is
   low; and seed set in natural and experimentally self- or
   cross-pollinated flowers is extremely low. Chromosome counts indicate
   that O. debilis contains diploid and tetraploid forms in its native as
   well as introduced range, which does not support a previous hypothesis
   that the predominant vegetative reproduction in this species is an
   escape from pentaploidy.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination ecology and habitat preference of Pedicularis species were
   studied in a transitional zone between subalpine coniferous forests and
   alpine meadows in northwestern Sichuan of China. Pedicularis species
   exhibited apparent preferences for different microhabitats. Species with
   long rostrate and contorted galea were nectarless and their mean corolla
   tube length ranged from 7 to 50 mm while species without long rostrate
   and contorted galea produced nectar and their corolla tube length
   averaged from 8 to 18 mm. Bumblebees were the sole pollinators of the
   studied species and five bee species pollinated seven Pedicularis
   species with one species pollinating all the Pedicularis species.
   Pollinators that visited nectariferous species had longer tongues than
   those that visited nectarless species and they spent longer time on
   nectariferous than on nectarless species. All Pedicularis species except
   for P. rex subsp. lipskyana were pollinated by worker bees. Pedicularis
   rex subsp. lipskyana was pollinated nototribically by worker, male and
   queen bumblebees through stigmatic contact with residual pollen on the
   left side of the bee's head. Morphology of pollinators, rather than
   pollinator species, may play the key role in diversification of
   Pedicularis. Microhabitats rather than pollination may be the separation
   barrier in propagation. Factors contributing to high diversity of
   Pedicularis need further study.}},

   characterized in Iris cedretii Dinsmore ex Chaudhary and Iris sofarana

   irises exhibiting potential adaptation to shelter pollination. Despite a
   diversity of floral visitors (47 species), only two groups of
   Anthophoridae male bees (Xylocopa spp. and Eucera spp.) could be
   considered as efficient pollinators on the basis of frequency of visits,
   visiting behaviour, and pollen load. Lebanese Oncocyclus irises showed a
   bimodal pollination system with (1) diurnal visits at low rates but with
   potentially large pollen transfers by Xylocopa bees, exhibiting a
   foraging-like behaviour, principally during warm periods of the day and
   (2) sheltering, especially Eucera male bees, during night and day when
   the weather is changeable. Refuge occurrence in flowers was more
   important during the night (27\%) than during the day (12\%) and, for
   daytime, during cloudy or windy than sunny conditions. It also varied
   depending on the exposure of floral tunnels. Visitation rates of both
   day-visiting Xylocopa and night-sheltering Eucera were negatively
   associated with an increase of the number of flowers per clump. No
   experimental evidence was found showing that the principal advantage for

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are important for the evolution and
   survival of the species involved. Plant-pollinator networks on oceanic
   islands are often small in size and as a consequence the connectance is
   high suggesting a substantial generalisation level. Further, linkage
   level for insular plants is shown to be lower than on mainland. The
   present study investigates a plant-pollinator network on the Galdpagos
   Islands that is unique because of its very small size. We recorded
   pollinator visits to plant species as well as pollen grains on insect
   bodies. The combination of these data increased the observed number of
   interactions. The values for connectance and linkage level for plants
   were found to be consistent with similar values found in other network
   studies. There were no relation between the abundance of plant species
   and the number of pollinating species. The dominating pollinator species
   was the Galdpagos carpenter bee Xylocopa darwini. Specimens of the
   shorthorned grasshopper Halmenus cuspidatus turned out to carry pollen
   from five plant species out of twelve and are probably functioning as
   pollinator. Bagging experiments revealed dependency on insect visits for
   a high seed set for most of the plant species, but only one species
   Plumbago scandens seemed to possess a pollen limited seed set. The
   network showed an asymmetric pattern of number of interactions per
   species with a few species having several interactions and many species
   a few. This pattern is supposed to result in a rather robust community,
   but is also fairly sensitive if the dominant species are threatened. The
   high connectance value found could, however, counteract this
   vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{1. The study tested the hypotheses that bumblebees have shorter foraging
   trips in environments that provide abundant resources than in
   environments that provide sparse resources, and that shorter foraging
   trips translate into greater colony growth.
   2. Six even-aged Bombus terrestris colonies were established in
   contrasting resource environments. Three colonies had access to abundant
   resources (Phacelia tanacetifolia fields with high flower densities),
   and three colonies were placed in an environment with sparse resources
   (scattered semi-natural habitats with food plants at lower densities).
   3. A total of 870 foraging trips of 220 marked B. terrestris foragers
   were observed using automated camcorder recordings.
   4. The duration of foraging trips was shorter in environments with
   abundant resources (66 +/- 4.6 min) than in environments with sparse
   resources (82 +/- 3.7 min). Within 34 days colonies that had access to
   abundant resources gained significantly more weight (129 +/- 40 g) than
   colonies foraging on sparse resources (19 +/- 7 g).
   5. Thus, the spatial distribution and quality of resources at landscape
   level affected the duration of foraging trips and the colony growth. It
   was concluded that future conservation schemes need to improve the
   spatial and temporal availability of resources in agricultural
   landscapes to counteract the ongoing decline of bumblebees.}},

Abstract = {{Almost 200 species of orchid bees are the exclusive pollinators of
   nearly 700 specialized orchids in the neotropics. This well-known
   mutualism involves orchids, called perfume orchids, which produce
   species-specific blends of. oral fragrances, and male orchid bees, which
   collect and use these fragrance compounds during their courtship. We
   report here the naturalization of an orchid bee, Euglossa viridissima,
   in southern Florida, USA, where perfume orchids are absent. Chemical
   analysis of the contents of the fragrance storage organs in the hind
   tibias of 59 male bees collected in Florida identified 55 fragrance
   compounds, including 27 known from the perfumes of nine species of E.
   viridissima's orchid mutualists in Mesoamerica. Aromatic leaves, such as
   basil, were found to be important surrogate sources of needed fragrance
   compounds in Florida. The bee's ability to live and become abundant in
   the absence of its orchid mutualists suggests that the orchid
   bee-perfume orchid mutualism may be facultative for the bees, even
   though it is obligatory for the orchids. This invasive bee visits and
   potentially pollinates the flowers of many plants in Florida, behavior
   that could promote the abundance of selected exotic and native species.}},

Abstract = {{Cases in which introduced species facilitate one another's
   establishment, spread, and impacts are increasingly noted, and several
   experimental studies have provided strong evidence of a population-level
   impact. However, a full `invasional meltdown', in which interspecific
   facilitation leads to an accelerating increase in the number of
   introduced species and their impact, has yet to be conclusively
   demonstrated. The great majority of suggested instances of `invasional
   meltdown' remain simply plausible scenarios of long-term consequences
   based on short-term observations of facilitatory interactions between
   individuals of two species. There is a particular dearth of proven
   instances in which two invasive species each enhance the impact and/or
   probability of establishment and spread of the other. By contrast, in
   many authenticated cases, at least one partner is aided. The metaphor of
   meltdown focused attention on facilitation in invasion and has probably
   helped inspire recent studies. As have other metaphors from invasion
   biology and other sciences, `meltdown' has struck a responsive chord
   with writers for the lay public; some have stretched it well beyond its
   meaning as understood by invasion biologists. There is no evidence that
   this hyperbole has impeded scientific understanding or caused loss of
   scientific credibility.}},

Abstract = {{The present research represents the first description of a Vespidae
   species spermatozoon. In Agelaia vicina, the sperm head is composed of
   an acrosome and a nucleus. The acrosome consists of an acrosomal
   vesicle, oval shaped in cross sections, and a perforatorium, that
   projects into the anterior nuclear region. The nucleus is elongated and
   oval shaped in cross sections. The nucleus-flagellum transition region
   includes the centriolar adjunct, the nucleus base and the anterior
   portions of the axoneme and of the large mitochondrial derivative. The
   centriolar adjunct begins as a thin layer between the nucleus and the
   large mitochondrial derivative, while just below it acquires a lateral
   extension partially surrounding the large mitochondrial derivative. In
   its medial portion, it is triangular shaped, situated laterally to the
   axoneme and the large mitochondrial derivative, and it finishes in
   contact with the tip of the small mitochondrial derivative. The
   flagellum is composed of a 9 + 9 + 2 axoneme, two mitochondrial
   derivatives and two accessory bodies. The large mitochondrial derivative
   begins laterally to the nuclear base, and the small one below the
   centriolar adjunct. Only the large mitochondrial derivative presents a
   paracrystalline core, situated distally in relation to the axoneme. In
   the posterior flagellar region, the small mitochondrial derivative
   finishes first, followed by the large one and both accessory bodies.
   Although Vespidae belong to the superfamily Vespoidea, as Formicidae,
   the sperm ultrastructure of A. vicina is phylogenetically more closely
   related to Apoidea, and curiously very different from that observed for
   ants. This study supports the use of insect sperm morphology as a tool
   for phylogenetic analysis, especially in the Hymenoptera order.}},

Abstract = {{The basic tenet of sex allocation theory is that an organism's
   reproductive success, through either male or female function, can be
   represented as a sex-specific, monotonic, increasing function of the
   organism's investment of resources in that function. The shapes of these
   curves determine what patterns of resource allocation can be
   evolutionarily stable. Although SA theory has stimulated creative
   thinking about plant sexual tactics, quantifying the shapes of male and
   female gain curves has proven so difficult that other approaches must be
   considered. I contrast sex allocation theory to a different, emerging
   viewpoint, pollen presentation theory (PPT), which attempts to address
   variation in reproductive success by measuring and modeling the
   quantitative fates of pollen grains. Models suggest that RS through male
   function depends heavily on the packaging and gradual dispensing of
   pollen to pollinators, even with the amount of investment held constant.
   Many plants do deploy pollen gradually, through morphological and
   ``behavioral{''} mechanisms that range from obvious to subtle. They may
   thereby influence many aspects of the evolution of sexual modes in
   plants, including transitions between dioecy and cosexuality. After
   reviewing the main implications of the models, I discuss recent work
   aimed at testing some key assumptions and predictions by functional and
   comparative studies in the genus Penstemon. Species of Penstemon conform
   to PPT predictions that bee-adapted flowers will restrict per-visit
   pollen availability more than hummingbird-adapted flowers.}},

Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{Coexistence in bumblebee communities has largely been investigated at
   local spatial scales. However, local resource partitioning does not
   fully explain the species diversity of bumblebee communities.
   Theoretical studies provide new evidence that partitioning of space can
   promote species coexistence, when species interact with their
   environment at different spatial scales. If bumblebee species possess
   specific foraging ranges, different spatial resource utilisation
   patterns might operate as an additional mechanism of coexistence in
   bumblebee communities. We investigated the effects of the landscape-wide
   availability of different resources (mass flowering crops and
   semi-natural habitats) on the local densities of four bumblebee species
   at 12 spatial scales (landscape sectors with 250-3,000 m radius) to
   indirectly identify the spatial scales at which the bumblebees perceive
   their environment. The densities of all bumblebee species were enhanced
   in landscapes with high proportions of mass flowering crops (mainly
   oilseed rape). We found the strongest effects for Bombus terrestris agg.
   and Bombus lapidarius at large spatial scales, implying foraging
   distances of 3,000 and 2,750 m, respectively. The densities of Bombus
   pascuorum were most strongly influenced at a medium spatial scale (1,000
   m), and of Bombus pratorum (with marginal significance) at a small
   spatial scale (250 m). The estimated foraging ranges tended to be
   related to body and colony sizes, indicating that larger species travel
   over larger distances than smaller species, presumably enabling them to
   build up larger colonies through a better exploitation of food
   resources. We conclude that coexistence in bumblebee communities could
   potentially be mediated by species-specific differences in the spatial
   resource utilisation patterns, which should be considered in
   conservation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the breeding system, reproductive output and pollination
   ecology of Abronia ammophila Greene, a rare and highly restricted
   endemic of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Floral morphology
   permits the automatic deposition of self-pollen on the stigma of
   individual flowers, and male and female reproductive functions
   temporally overlap. In controlled hand-pollination treatments, we found
   no significant difference among pollination treatments (unmanipulated,
   self-pollinated or cross-pollination). The species maintains a long
   reproductive season with high reproductive output (natural seed set
   ranged from 59 to 84\%). Our results, along with pollinator
   observations, suggest that A. ammophila exhibits a mixed-mating system:
   the species can produce seed without pollinators (via either autogamy or
   agamospermy), but is also visited by an array of pollinating insects
   that included moths, butterflies and bumblebees. However, noctuid moths
   were the most abundant pollinators. In contrast, other Abronia species
   are obligate outcrossers. The mixed-mating system of A. ammophila may
   have evolved as a consequence of ecological pressures such as scarcity
   of mates or pollinators.}},

   local bee diversity in both countries; however, divergent trends were
   observed in hoverflies. Depending on the assemblage and location,
   pollinator declines were most frequent in habitat and flower
   specialists, in univoltine species, and/or in nonmigrants. In
   conjunction with this evidence, outcrossing plant species that are
   reliant on the declining pollinators have themselves declined relative

   a causal connection between local extinctions of functionally linked

Abstract = {{The phenylpyrazole insecticide, fipronil, is used in seed coating
   against Agriotes larvae, which infest mainly corn and sunflower. Coating
   the seeds of the cultivated plants with fipronil has proven its
   effectiveness against Agriotes populations. In the case of sunflower or
   even corn, the possible root uptake of this insecticide may lead to a
   toxic effect against pollinators such as honeybees. In the present
   report, the uptake and transport of fipronil inside the sunflower
   seedling was studied in the laboratory. In a first study, sunflower was
   cultivated on an aqueous medium containing fipronil. An intense root
   uptake of fipronil occurred, leading to a transport into leaves
   depending upon transpiration. In a second study, plants were cultivated
   on a soil in which fipronil was uniformly distributed. Under our soil
   conditions (20\% organic carbon), the partition coefficient between soil
   and water (K-d) was found to be equal to 386 +/- 30. The average rate of
   fipronil transfer from soil water to seedlings was from 2 to 2.6 times
   lower than water transfer. During the 3 week experiment, 55\% of
   recovered labeled compounds was in the parent form and 35\% had been
   converted to lipophilic metabolites, with either a 4-CF3-SO2 or 4-CF3-S
   substituant, which are also very potent lipophilic insecticides. This
   paper suggests that the possible uptake of fipronil by sunflower
   seedlings under agronomic conditions is mainly controlled by the
   physicochemical characteristics of the seed-coating mixture.}},

   augmentation shelters used for nest building. However, populations of O.
   rufa under the same treatment only doubled annually. Data are also
   presented on sex ratios in these managed populations, the sex ratio
   being an important factor in increasing population numbers and raising
   pollination efficacy. Sex ratio values (male : female) varied from 1.46

   2.68 : 1 in those of O. rufa.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we compared pollination characteristics of Aconitum
   gymnandrum at two sites respectively with elevations of 2460 and 3200 in
   in the northeast Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. This species is an alpine
   biennial with unique systematic position and floral morphology in the
   tribe Delphinieae, Ranunculaceae. We found that the floral longevity and
   male and female phase durations in the high altitude population were
   significantly longer than those in the low altitude population. Seeds
   cannot be set through apomixis in this species. Aconitum gymnandrum is
   highly self-compatible, but autonomous self-pollination within the
   individual flower is ruled out through a combination of protandry and
   herkogamy during floral development, suggesting that pollen vectors were
   indispensable for successful seed sets of A. gymnandrum. Bumblebees are
   main pollinators of A. gymnandrum in both populations. Within each
   raceme, pollinators visited flowers at the bottom first, and then
   spirally moved upwards; however, 3.9\% and 2.7\% of the visits were
   downward respectively in the low altitude population and the high
   altitude population. In addition, 37.7\% and 29.3\% of the movements
   occurred between different racemes within the same plant; therefore
   geitonogamous self-pollination could not be completely avoided. The
   higher seed sets of artificially pollinated flowers than the intact
   flowers suggested the existence of pollination limitation in both
   populations. Visiting frequency of bumblebees at the low altitude was
   higher than that at the high altitude, but seed sets of the intact
   flowers in both populations did not differ remarkably, probably due to
   that the longer duration of the stigmatic receptivity in the high
   altitude population compensates the decrease of seed sets because of the
   low visiting frequency of pollinators at this site.}},

Abstract = {{Concerted changes in flower morphology and pollinators provide strong
   evidence on adaptive evolution. Schizanthus (Solanaccae) has zygomorphic
   flowers and consists of 12 species of annual or biennial herbs that are
   distributed mainly in Chile and characterized by bee-, hummingbird-, and
   moth-pollination syndromes. To infer whether flowers diversified in
   relation to pollinator shifts, we traced the evolutionary trajectory of
   flower traits and visitors onto a phylogeny based on sequence data from
   ITS, waxy, and trnF/ndhJ DNA. Maximum-likelihood ancestral
   reconstruction of floral traits suggests that ancestral Schizanthus had
   a bee-pollination syndrome. The hummingbird syndrome evolved in S.
   grahamii, a high elevation species in the Andes. The moth syndrome
   evolved in the ancestor of three species that inhabit the Atacama
   Desert. Results of mapping flower visitors onto the phylogeny show that
   the shift from bee to hummingbird pollination concurred with a shift in
   pollinators as predicted by the syndromes. However, the same pattern was
   not found for the moth syndrome. Visits by moths were observed only in
   one of the three moth-syndrome species, and at a very low rate. This
   mismatch suggests either anachronic floral characters or maintenance of
   rare, imperceptible moth pollination backed up by capacity for
   autonomous selfing. Overall, results suggest that diversification of
   flower traits in Schizanthus has occurred in relation to pollinator
   shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims For rare endemics or endangered plant species that
   reproduce both sexually and vegetatively it is critical to understand
   the extent of clonality because assessment of clonal extent and
   distribution has important ecological and evolutionary consequences with
   conservation implications. A survey was undertaken to understand clonal
   effects on fine-scale genetic structure (FSGS) in two populations (one
   from a disturbed and the other from an undisturbed locality) of
   Echinosophora koreensis, an endangered small shrub belonging to a
   monotypic genus in central Korea that reproduces both sexually and
   vegetatively via rhizomes.
   Methods Using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs) as genetic markers,
   the spatial distribution of individuals was evaluated using Ripley's
   L(d)-statistics and quantified the spatial scale of clonal spread and
   spatial distribution of ISSR genotypes using spatial autocorrelation
   analysis techniques (join-count statistics and kinship coefficient,
   F-ij) for total samples and samples excluding clones.
   Key Results A high degree of differentiation between populations was
   observed (Phi(ST(g)) = 0.184, P < 0.001). Ripley's L(d)-statistics
   revealed a near random distribution of individuals in a disturbed
   population, whereas significant aggregation of individuals was found in
   an undisturbed site. The join-count statistics revealed that most clones
   significantly aggregate at <= 6-m interplant distance. The Sp statistic
   reflecting patterns of correlograms revealed a strong pattern of FSGS
   for all four data sets (Sp = 0.072-0.154), but these patterns were not
   significantly different from each other. At small interplant distances
   (<= 2 m), however, jackknifed 95 \% CIs revealed that the total samples
   exhibited significantly higher F-ij values than the same samples
   excluding clones.
   Conclusion The strong FSGS from genets is consistent with two biological
   and ecological traits of E. koreensis: bee-pollination and limited seed
   dispersal. Furthermore, potential clone mates over repeated generations
   would contribute to the observed high F-ij values among genets at short
   distance. To ensure long-term ex situ genetic variability of the
   endangered E. koreensis, individuals located at distances of 10-12 m
   should be collected across entire populations of E. koreensis.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive and incessant arms races between a parasite and its host are
   generally expected to lead to parasite specialization. Nevertheless,
   some parasitic species still successfully attack wide spectra of hosts.
   One of the solutions to the evolutionary enigma of the long-term
   existence of generalist parasites is their specialization at an
   individual level, a phenomenon well known, e.g., in European common
   cuckoo. Over its range, it parasitizes a number of bird species;
   however, individual females are mostly specialists possessing
   adaptations to a particular host species. In this study, we test the
   possibility of individual specialization in generalist cuckoo bees, the
   insect counterparts of avian cuckoos. Females of cuckoo bees lay each
   egg into a single brood cell in the nests of other bee species. The
   host's offspring is destroyed by the parasitic female or later by her
   larvae, which feed on pollen supplies accumulated by the host. Both
   studied cleptoparasitic bees (Sphecodes ephippius and Sphecodes
   monilicornis) are widely distributed in Europe, where they have been
   reported to use broad host spectra. We recorded several host species
   (including some previously unknown) for both cuckoo bee species, and
   confirmed that these parasites are indeed generalist even at a small
   local scale. However, we demonstrate that exactly as in the avian
   cuckoos, each female in both species of generalist bee parasites tends
   to attack just one host species.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about the quantitative pollen requirements of solitary bees is
   crucial for the preservation of endangered bee species and the
   understanding of the evolution of bee-flower relationships. We estimate
   the number of flowers required to rear a single larva for 41 European
   bee species (i) by comparing the pollen content of brood cells with the
   pollen quantity contained in the flowers of the bees' host plants and
   (ii) by deducing the pollen requirements from a regression model
   describing the relationship between the average bee dry body mass and
   the average brood cell pollen content. The flower requirements of the
   bee species examined vary by three orders of magnitude. Depending on
   both bee species and host plant, from seven to 1100 flowers or from 0.9
   to 4.5 flower heads are needed to rear a single larva. As only about
   40\% of the pollen contained in a flower was found to be available to a
   single female bee, these minimal figures have to be multiplied by a
   factor of approximately 2.5 to obtain a realistic estimate of bee flower
   requirements The amount of pollen lost from flowers for bee nutrition is
   surprisingly high. We hypothesize that the recent decline of many bee
   species may have its main cause in a food shortage provoked by a
   decrease in flower diversity and quantity following habitat destruction
   and modern agricultural practices. The substantial pollen losses to bees
   as documented in this study support earlier findings on floral
   adaptations against excessive pollen harvesting by bees. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{The relatively low reproductive success of buckwheat ( Fagopyrum
   esculentum Moench, Polygonaceae) is poorly understood. The question
   arises as to whether this distylous species is pollen or resource
   limited. We investigated the reproductive biology of buckwheat under
   controlled conditions in growth rooms and in the field in central
   Belgium in order to determine whether floral morph and pollination
   events may affect its reproductive success. In controlled conditions,
   flowering phenology and flower morphology of the two floral morphs did
   not differ. However, thrum flowers produced larger and fewer pollen
   grains and secreted more nectar, with a higher proportion of sucrose,
   than pin flowers. In the field, thrum flowers were preferentially
   visited by honeybees, but fewer pollen grains were deposited on their
   stigmas. However, numbers of pollen tubes growing in styles, seed set,
   and seed weight did not differ between morphs. Seed set was low under
   field conditions and did not increase after hand cross- pollinations,
   suggesting that there was no pollen limitation. These results indicate
   that factors other than floral morph or pollination events were
   governing female fertility in buckwheat.}},

   distance and the frequency of self- and intramorph fertilization.
   3 Seed set was significantly correlated with the number of
   opposite-morph flowers within 2 m in short-styled genets, and within 3 m
   in long-styled genets.
   4 Mean pollen dispersal distance within the experimental population was
   5.4 m, which was slightly shorter than that in a low-density population
   measured in a previous study (7.2 m).
   5 The proportions of seedlings sired by the same morph or selfed were
   10.2\% and 3.0\%, respectively, in long-styled mothers, compared with
   1.9\% and 0.0\% among short-styled mothers. However, these differences
   were not statistically significant and no marked differences in pollen
   dispersal distances were observed between the two morphs.
   6 Our results suggest that the presence of opposite-morph genets within
   several metres is essential for success of seed reproduction in P.
   sieboldii, irrespective of population density, and that stochastic
   deviation of the morph ratio in small populations is therefore likely to
   cause considerable reduction in seed set.}},

Abstract = {{A 3 yr survey of the bee associates of flowering accessions of
   Astragalus and Onobrychis species was conducted in open-pollinated field
   nurseries at Central Ferry, Washington to gain insight into the
   potential for bee-mediated inter-accession out-crossing in these
   nurseries. Such nurseries are used by genebank managers at the USDA-ARS
   Western Regional Plant Introduction Station (WRPIS), Pullman,
   Washington, to multiply seed of accessions low in viability and/or
   supply. Fifty-two species of bees (Hymenoptera) in the Andrenidae (4
   species), Apidae (18), Colletidae (1), Halictidae (5), and Megachilidae
   (24) were recorded. Species-rich genera were Bombus (8 species) and
   Osmia (16). One undescribed species of Osmia was collected. The bee
   fauna was more diverse on Astragalus (45 bee species) compared to
   Onobrychis (29 species). Among the 24 Astragalus and 13 Onobrychis
   species censused, bee diversity was highest on A. bungeanus Boiss. (24
   bee species), A. chaborasicus Boiss. \& Hausskn. (24 species), A. miser
   var. serotinus (A. Gray ex J.G. Cooper) Barney (14 species), A. cicer L.
   (13 species), A. schistosus Boiss. \& Hohen. (12 species), A. onobrychis
   L. (11 species), A. podolobus Boiss. \& Hohen. (11 species), and
   Onobrychis viciifolia Scop. (10 species). The presence of a rich bee
   fauna in WRPIS nurseries at Central Ferry, including documented
   pollinators of the allogamous species A. cicer and O. viciifolia, could
   complicate efforts to prevent hybridization and maintain genetic
   integrity of genebank accessions of allogamous plant species. Our
   results support a 1993 decision by WRPIS curators to discontinue the
   practice of clustering accessions of single species of Astragalus and
   Onobrychis in open-pollinated nurseries to regenerate seed.}},

Abstract = {{Lyshnachia asperulifolia Poir., rough-leaf loosestrife, is a federally
   endangered species that is restricted to longleaf pine savanna - pocosin
   ecotones in North and South Carolina. Potential causes of the limited
   fruit and seed production typical of this species and possible effects
   of prescribed fire on these causes were examined. It was determined that
   insects rarely visit flowers and that the visitors, Augochlorella spp.
   and Lasioglossum spp., are not effective pollinators. However, results
   of artificial pollinations do not support the hypothesis that pollinator
   limitation alone restricts seed production. Levels of fertility and S
   allele diversity may vary across natural populations and, combined with
   ineffective pollination, enforce restricted fruit and seed production.
   Pollen fertility, amount of flowering, and number of fruits produced in
   natural populations did not increase following prescribed fire.
   Restricted seed germination further limits recruitment of genetic
   variation into populations. Pollinations and propagule dispersal among
   populations are precluded by habitat fragmentation. Alternative courses
   of action designed to increase fruit and seed production and seedling
   recruitment are recommended to those developing loosestrife conservation
   plans.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of protandrous flowers and acropetal inflorescence
   development in bee-pollinated species is thought to maximize
   cross-pollination because bees visit vertical inflorescences from the
   bottom up. However, incomplete protandry may allow bees to carry out
   geitonogamous pollinations. We examined the overlap in male and female
   phases in the rare orchid Spiranthes diluvialis, a plant with the above
   combination of characteristics. We found that unvisited male phase
   flowers proceed to a hermaphroditic phase, not a female phase, because
   each flower's single pollinarium remains viable and may be removed by
   pollinators throughout anthesis. Pollinator visitation rates, as
   estimated by pollinaria removal rates, varied among five populations in
   Utah and Colorado, USA. More hermaphroditic phase flowers accrued on
   inflorescences in populations with low visitation rates than in those
   with higher visitation rates. We conclude that the cross-pollination
   mechanism of S. diluvialis requires some minimum threshold of bee visits
   in order to work optimally. When bees are plentiful, male and female
   functions remain temporally separated and cross-pollination is
   maximized. III contrast, the potential for geitonogamy in this
   self-compatible species is much higher in Populations with low
   visitation rates. We Suggest that pollinator abundance may affect the
   mating system of other protandrous, acropetal, bee-pollinated plants if
   protandry depends upon the timely removal of long-lived pollen.}},

Abstract = {{The flowers of K. bahiana mainly produce oil as floral resource for
   their visitors. Oil collecting bees usually show morphological and
   behavioral adaptation for their collection. This study focused on the
   analysis of interactions between the flowers of K bahiana and their
   visiting bees, aiming for the efficiency of the pollination, in an area
   of the Coastal Sand Plains of Bahia State, Brazil. From February/2001 to
   February/2002 and from May to October/2002 observations were
   accomplished about the phenology and morphology of the plants and the
   floral visitors' behavior. The flowers of the inflorescences are
   zigomorphic, small sized, pink and present a pair of petals modified in
   epithelial elaiophores, which are responsible for the production of oil.
   These flowers were visited especially by bees of the genus Centris: C
   leprieuri Spinola, C. tarsata Smith, C trigonoides Lepeletier and C
   pulchra Moure, Oliveira \& Viana. The bees collected only oil in the
   flowers, by scratching the elaiophores and then transferring it to scopa
   located on the tibia and basitarsus of the hind legs. During those
   actions, the bees often contact the reproductive structures of the
   flowers, resulting in pollination. C leprieuri was the most frequent bee
   during this study, thus considered the effective pollinator. Megachile
   dentipes Vachal also visited the flowers of K bahiana, collecting only
   pollen. However, these bees were considered sporadic pollinators because
   they were not frequent in the flowers of K bahiana in the months of
   observation.}},

   In the present study these molecular markers were used to analyze the

   Moure exhibiting variations in two morphological characters (colour of
   the antennal scape and metaepisternal hairs) which are frequently used
   to identify this species of euglossine bee. The twelve primers used in
   the RAPD analysis amplified 127 loci, of which 40 (31.5\%) were
   polymorphic, showing some variation among the individuals. The
   coefficients of genetic similarity among the individuals ranged from
   0.79 to 0.95, indicating a rather high genetic similarity among the 18
   male bees studied. No RAPD band was specific to any morphological
   character analyzed. The results indicate that all bees analyzed belong
   to the same species. The high genetic similarity among the eighteen
   euglossine males studied indicates that the variations observed in the

Abstract = {{Although many researchers have studied colonization, the process has

   colonization process of a remote oceanic island, I investigated the
   flora, vegetation, and pollinators of Nishino-shima Island 31 yr after a
   major eruption in 1973. Nishino-shima Island, which is 22 ha in size, is
   located 1,000 kin south of mainland Japan. Vegetation cover had
   increased, especially on new lowland area, since a preliminary survey
   done 10 yr after the eruption, but plant species richness remained poor
   (only six species). Thus, the plant colonization rate (0.10 species/yr)
   was far slower than that of other volcanic islands such as Krakatau.
   Most plants (four species) had ocean-dispersed seeds, but two species
   were likely dispersed via attachment to seabirds. Despite colonization
   by only a few plant species, there were abundant flower visitors
   including ants, bugs, a butterfly, and a fly (but no bee species), and
   the average visitation rate per flower was 5.5 visits/12 hr in total
   observations. Most of the insects used multiple food sources,

Abstract = {{Floral biology, reproduction, pollinator specificity, and fruit set of
   Cirrhaea dependens were recorded in forest areas of Southeastern Brazil.
   Cirrhaea dependens is a lithophytic or epiphytic herb occurring very
   sparsely below dense canopies. Nearly all the flowers of a single plant
   open simultaneously before dawn. They are short-lasting and offer floral
   fragrances as rewards, which are collected by male euglossine bees.
   Observations carried out in mesophytic forests at Serra do japi revealed
   that Euglossa viridis is their principal pollinator, with Euffiesea
   violacea a sporadic co-pollinator. Visitation started soon after flower
   opening, and attractiveness remained high for about 2 h, decreasing
   abruptly at sunrise. Flower anthesis with subsequent fragrance release
   seems to be correlated with bee attraction. Observations using chemical
   baits were carried out at Serra do japi, and in the Atlantic Rain Forest
   of Picinguaba. Three euglossine species were captured with pollinaria of
   C dependens in Picinguaba, whereas only E. violacea was attracted in
   Serra do japi. In Picinguaba, C dependens occurs sympatrically with C
   saccata and C loddigesii. Each species attracted different pollinators.
   The specificity and resulting reproductive isolation are due to the
   production of different odours by each orchid species. Cirrhaea
   dependens is self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. The reproductive
   success was low and appears to result from a combination of factors
   discussed here, such as the production of short-lived flowers, presence
   of floral mechanisms avoiding self-pollination, non-synchronization of
   flower phases among plants, and populations with few and sparsely
   distributed individuals.}},

   (Bignoniaceae) is an endemic hummingbird-pollinated climber with
   pinkish-red tubular flowers, which suffers high levels of floral larceny
   by a native bumblebee. We studied two populations of C. valdivianum in
   an Andean forest in South America and found that they differ
   significantly in their mean corolla length but not in their mean corolla
   width. The proportion of robbed flowers, as well as the mean number of
   holes per robbed flower was higher in the population with higher mean
   corolla length. Although robbing levels also differed between
   individuals within populations, corolla length was only significantly
   related to robbing frequency in the population with longest corollas.
   The positive relationship between corolla length and nectar robbing
   observed here might affect the fitness in this species and thus the
   direction and magnitude of selection of the floral trait.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the reproductive biology of endangered plants is essential
   for their effective conservation. It also provides important information
   for understanding the evolutionary processes that affect speciation,
   thus helping the definition of proper units for conservation in
   endangered plants with problematic taxonomy. We studied the reproductive
   potential and possibility for hybridization in the endangered genus
   Saintpaulia (Gesneriaceae) by examining flowering phenology, flower and
   seed production and pollination of three sympatric cross-compatible
   Saintpaulia species in the East Usambara Mts., Tanzania. The synchrony
   observed in flowering in S. confusa and S. difficilis may enable
   hybridization between these two species, whereas partial phenological
   separation may contribute to the integrity of S. grotei. Although the
   level of flower abortion is high in S. confusa, each pollinated flower
   yields about 1000 seeds. Saintpaulia confusa produces fruits following
   both self- and cross-pollination but spontaneous self-pollination seems
   not to occur. Thus, seed production depends on sufficient pollinator
   service. Floral heteromorphy (i.e. enantiostyly) and bee pollination are
   likely to further enhance cross-pollination, suggesting that the genus
   predominantly outcrosses. Thus, Saintpaulia populations are likely to
   suffer from negative effects of inbreeding if they become small and
   isolated.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of exotic species into natural habitats is considered to be
   a major threat to biodiversity, and many studies have examined how
   exotic plants directly affect native plant species through competitive
   interactions for abiotic resources. However, although exotics can have
   potentially great ecological and evolutionary consequences, very few
   researchers have studied the effect of exotics on the interactions
   between plants and their mutualistic partners, such as pollinators, and
   none have reported on such impacts in logged and undisturbed boreal
   forest ecosystems. Here we show how experimental introductions of an
   exotic plant species (Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham) affect pollinator
   visitation and female reproductive success of a native plant (Melampyrum
   pratense L.) in recently disturbed (i.e., logged) and in undisturbed
   boreal forest habitats. The presence of Phacelia significantly increased
   the number of bumble bees entering plots in both habitat types. However,
   the exotic species had a strong negative impact on the visitation rate
   to the native species in both habitat types. Despite this negative
   impact on pollinator visitation, the exotic had no effect on female
   reproductive success of the native species in any habitat. Our results
   show that seed production may be more robust than pollinator visitation
   to exotic invasion, irrespective of habitat disturbance history.}},

Abstract = {{The long-standing notion of pollination syndromes, which postulates that
   plants form recognizable groups according to pollinator type, has been
   challenged recently on the basis of apparent widespread generalization
   in pollination systems. As a test of the pollination syndrome concept, I
   examined the pollination biology of a group of 15 orchids that share a
   recognizable syndrome of floral features that includes yellow-green
   coloration, oil secretion, pungent scent, shallow flowers, and a
   September peak in flowering. The orchids occur in sympatry in the Cape
   Floral Region of South Africa. According to the pollination syndrome
   concept, the similar floral features of this group indicate a shared
   pollinator. To test this prediction. I observed pollinators on
   Pterygodium alatum, P. caffrum, P. catholicum, P. volucris. Corycium
   orobanchoides. and Disperis bolusiana subsp. bolusiana. They shared a
   single species of pollinator, the oil-collecting bee, Rediviva
   peringueyi. Female bees collected oil from the lip appendage using
   modified front tarsi. The orchids reduce interspecific reproductive
   interference through differences in pollinarium length or the use of
   mutually exclusive pollinarium attachment sites on the body of the bee.
   The results are contrary to the expectation of generalization in
   pollination systems and suggest that pollinators play an important role

Abstract = {{center dot Background and Aims The labellar `hairs' of some Cymbidium
   spp. are said to be thin-walled and to contain `plasma', oil and sugars
   and it has long been speculated that they may function as food-hairs.
   However, the present authors' preliminary studies showed that certain
   atypical papillae may have a different role and, by. reflecting light,
   function as a speculum. The purpose of the paper is to test this
   hypothesis.
   center dot Methods Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, histochemistry and ultraviolet
   photography were used to investigate the structure, food content and
   light-reflecting properties of these papillae.
   center dot Key Results and Conclusions The labellum of Cymbidium
   lowianum (Rchb.f.) Rchb.f. is densely clothed with obconical to conical
   papillae with wide bases and pointed tips. However, on either side of
   the median axis of the lip occur silvery patches comprising papillae
   with truncated tips and it is thought that these reflect light and
   thereby attract insect pollinators. Similar patches are also found in
   Cymbidium devonianum Paxton, and in both species, they are set against a
   reddish background, which, since bees cannot perceive this colour,
   probably appears dark to the insect thus enhancing the visual impact of
   the light-reflecting patches. In Cymbidium tigrinum Parish ex Hook. and
   Cymbidium mastersii Griff. ex Lindl., however, the labellum is mainly
   white and no light-reflecting patches were observed. Instead, unlike C.
   lowianum and C devonianum, these species are highly fragrant and the
   attraction of insects probably depends to a greater extent on olfactory
   cues. In C. lowianum both types of papillae contain protein, starch and
   lipid bodies but only protein is seemingly present at elevated
   concentrations. However, lipoidal material also occurs upon the surface
   of the labellum and it is possible that this may be gathered by insects
   as reported for C. iridifolium A. Cunn (syn. C. madidum Lindl.). The
   labellar papillae of C. lowianum, thus, have the potential to function
   as food-hairs, although direct evidence for this is lacking.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of eight populations of the tree Embothrium
   coccineum was studied along a steep rainfall gradient in NW Patagonia,
   Argentina. The showy red flowers suggest an ornithophilous pollination
   syndrome and they have been reported to attract hummingbirds in
   Argentina and hummingbirds and passerines in Chile. At each population,
   flower visitors were recorded and floral rewards were analysed. We found
   a highly significant increase in nectar concentration towards the drier
   end of the gradient, but this change was not related to the turnover of
   species in the flower-visitor assemblage of E. coccineum. In addition to
   the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes (Green-Backed Firecrown,
   Trochilidae) which is widespread throughout the temperate forest at this
   latitude, other species seem to be locally important as pollinators of
   E. coccineum in some sites in Argentina (e.g. two long-tongued
   tanglewing flies (Nemestrinidae) of the genus Trichophthalma). The
   long-dated occurrence of tanglewing flies in South America, relative to

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Invasive plants with large flowering displays have been shown to compete
   with native plants for pollinator services, often to the detriment of
   native plant fitness. in this study, we compare the pollinator
   communities and pollen deposited on stigmas of native plant species
   within and away from stands of the invasive alien plant, leafy spurge
   (Euphorbia esula) at a large natural area in North Dakota, USA.
   Specifically, we ask if infestation influences (1) visitation rates and
   taxonomic composition of visitors to native flowers, and (2) the amount
   of conspecific pollen, number of pollen species, and proportion of
   heterospecific pollen on stigmas of native plants. We observed visits to
   selected native species during May and June 2000 and 2001. Stigmas were
   collected from a subsample of the flowers within these plots, squashed,
   and the pollen identified and counted under a light microscope.
   Visitation varied between years and among species of native plants:
   infestation had mixed effects in 2000 but visitation, especially by
   halictids was always lower within infestations in 2001. Despite
   differences in visitation between years, we found significantly less
   conspecific pollen on stigmas from infested plots in six of eight cases;
   we never found significantly more conspecific pollen on stigmas from
   within infestations. Our results emphasize the temporal variability in
   plant-pollinator relations and the added complexity imposed by an
   invasive species that will always make prediction of effects difficult.
   Nonetheless, the consistently lower conspecific pollen counts on native
   stigmas within infestations, regardless of visitation, suggest the
   likelihood of negative effects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Although the predatory and competitive impacts of biological invasions
   are well documented, facilitation of native species by non-indigenous
   species is frequently overlooked. A search through recent ecological
   literature found that facilitative interactions between invasive and
   native species occur in a wide range of habitats, can have cascading
   effects across trophic levels, can re-structure communities, and can
   lead to evolutionary changes. These are critical findings that, until
   now, have been mostly absent from analyses of ecological impacts of
   biological invasions. Here I present evidence for several mechanisms
   that exemplify how exotic species can facilitate native species. These
   mechanisms include habitat modification, trophic subsidy, pollination,
   competitive release, and predatory release. Habitat modification is the
   most frequently documented mechanism, reflecting the drastic changes
   generated by the invasion of functionally novel habitat engineers.
   Further, I predict that facilitative impacts on native species will be
   most likely when invasive species provide a limiting resource, increase
   habitat complexity, functionally replace a native species, or ameliorate
   predation or competition. Finally, three types of facilitation (novel,
   substitutive, and indirect) define why exotic species can lead to
   facilitation of native species. It is evident that understanding
   biological invasions at the community and ecosystem levels will be more
   accurate if we integrate facilitative interactions into future
   ecological research. Since facilitative impacts of biological invasions
   can occur with native endangered species, and can have wide-ranging
   impacts, these results also have important implications for management,
   eradication, and restoration.}},

   sweet-smelling inflorescences, rewards its pollinators and that this
   increases its success in attracting pollinators over its close relative,
   Arum idaeum Coust. \& Gadoger. The relationship between rewards

   marginatum individuals carried more pollen on their bodies and travelled
   greater distances between inflorescences, thus increasing the potential
   for outcrossing. The finding that floral rewards may result in increased
   fitness, compared to nonrewarding systems that rely on attracting
   saprophilic pollinators, suggests that it is possible for rewarding
   species to evolve from saprophilous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive assurance is often invoked as an explanation for the
   evolution of self-fertilization in plants. However, key aspects of this
   hypothesis have received little empirical support. In this study, I use
   geographic surveys of pollinator communities along with functional
   studies of. oral trait variation to examine the role of pollination
   ecology in mating system differentiation among populations and
   subspecies of the annual plant Clarkia xantiana. A greenhouse experiment
   involving 30 populations from throughout the species' range indicated
   that variation in two. oral traits, herkogamy and protandry, was closely
   related to levels of autofertility and that trait variation was
   partitioned mainly among populations. Emasculation experiments in the
   field showed that autonomous selfing confers reproductive assurance by
   elevating fruit and seed production. Surveys of pollinator communities
   across the geographic range of the species revealed that bee pollinator
   abundance and community composition differed dramatically between
   populations of the outcrossing subspecies xantiana and the selfing
   subspecies parviflora despite their close proximity. Specialist bee
   pollinators of Clarkia were absent from selfing populations, but they
   were the most frequent visitors to outcrossing populations. Moreover,
   within the outcrossing subspecies xantiana, there was a close
   correspondence between specialist abundance and population
   differentiation in herkogamy, a key mating system trait. This spatial
   covariation arose, in part, because geographically peripheral
   populations had reduced herkogamy, higher autofertility, and lower
   pollinator abundance compared to central populations of xantiana.
   Finally, I detected strong spatial structure to bee communities both
   across the range of the species and within the outcrossing subspecies.
   In both cases, spatial structure was stronger for specialist bees
   compared to generalist bees, and pollinator communities varied in
   parallel with population variation in herkogamy. These results provide
   evidence that mating system differentiation parallels spatial variation
   in pollinator abundance and community composition at both broad and more
   restricted spatial scales, consistent with the hypothesis that
   pollinator abundance and reproductive assurance are important drivers of
   plant mating system evolution.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation through land-use systems on private land is
   becoming a pressing environmental policy issue. Agroforestry, such as
   shade-coffee production, contributes to biodiversity conservation.
   However, falling coffee prices force many coffee growers to convert
   their sites into economically more attractive land uses. We performed an
   economic evaluation of coffee pollination by bees in two distinct
   tropical regions: an area of low human impact with forests neighboring
   agroforestry in Indonesia and an area of high human impact with little
   remaining forest in Ecuador. We evaluated bee pollination for different
   forest-destruction scenarios, where coffee yields depend on forests to
   provide nesting sites for bees. We used two novel approaches. First, we
   examined how coffee net revenues depend on the pollination services of
   adjacent forests by considering berry weight in addition to fruit set,
   thereby providing a comprehensive evaluation. Second, we determined the
   net welfare effects of land-use changes, including the fact that former
   forestland is normally used for alternative crops. In both regions, crop
   revenues exceeded coffee pollination values, generating incentives to
   convert forests, even if owners would be compensated for pollination
   services. The promotion of certified ``biodiversity-friendly{''} coffee
   is a feasible option to maintain shade-coffee systems. This is of
   special importance in high-impact areas where only small forest
   fragments remain. We conclude that a comprehensive economic analysis is
   necessary to adequately evaluate rainforest preservation for the
   enhancement of ecosystem services, such as pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there is no economical way to produce large quantities of F,
   hybrid soybean seed in the USA. One of the fundamental requirements for
   hybrid seed production is the availability of a stable male-sterile,
   female-fertile system. However, the more challenging barrier is the
   efficient transfer of pollen from the male parent to the female parent.
   This could potentially be achieved through pollinator insects. Our
   observations suggested that seed set on male-sterile, female-fertile
   plants is a good indicator of insect attraction. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate seed set among male-sterile, female-fertile lines
   segregating for male-sterile, female-fertile ms6 allele by using
   Megachile rotundata as pollinator vector. Thirty-four pairs of
   near-isogenic lilies, the ms6 wI wI donor parent, and its two isogenic
   lilies WIwl and wIwI segregating for male-sterile (ms6) allele were
   used. The WI locus controls flower color and hypocotyle pigmentation.
   Seed set was evaluated on field-grown plants in 2001-2003 near Ames, IA.
   Although the observed seed set was not commercially acceptable, our
   results indicated significant differences in seed set among lines. This
   suggests that preferential attraction of pollinators occurred, and
   selection among male-sterile, female-fertile lines could be used to
   obtain female parents suitable to produce larger amounts of hybrid
   soybean seed. In addition, the effect of flower color on seed set was
   statistically significant. White-flowered lines produced more seed set
   compared to purple-flowered lines (WIWI). Lastly, the important effect
   of year suggested that the effect of environmental conditions on seed
   set among lilies segregating for male sterility was of paramount
   importance to plant-pollinator interactions. This needs to be assessed
   in order to establish an efficient hybrid soybean program. Published by

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The seed producing system in viola (Viola x cornuta) was investigated to
   improve seed yield and to save labor. In a flower five anthers
   sequentially dehisced; pollen grains were continuously supplied to the
   anterior petal, which played a significant role in pollination,
   throughout the flowering period. Evidence from pollen and ovule number
   suggests that the species is facultative autogamy. Each flower opened
   more than 10 days was independent of the success in fertilization and
   kept seed producing ability during the flower longevity period. Pollen
   grains also maintained viability during the flower longevity period.
   Pollinators were indispensable for pollination of viola, but pollination
   in viola was done by a different mechanism from the typical
   insect-mediated pollination that sticky pollen grains adhere to the
   exposed stigmas. Pollen grains, accumulated around the entrance of the
   stigmatic cavity, entered into the cavity by the movement of
   pollinators. Although the visitation of pollinators was occasional,
   solitary bees primarily contributed to the pollination of viola. On the
   other hand, germination of pollen grains on the stigmatic surface was
   under 50\%. Seed set was much lower than the germination percentage of
   pollen grains. A viola flower had the ability for additional
   pollinations and fertilization for some days after the fertilization
   success in some ovules in the flower. This characteristic suggested that
   repeated pollination is effective to increase the number of mature seeds
   in a capsule.}},

   to an increase in the time spent by females locating their own nests,
   thereby decreasing alfalfa pollination efficiency and possibly healthy
   brood production. The objectives of this study were to determine the
   effect of different nesting board configurations in commercial alfalfa

   Separating the nesting boards inside shelters improved the ability of
   females to locate their nests. An increase in nest location performance
   also occurred in boards with the three-dimensional pattern and the
   combined three-dimensional and color contrast pattern, compared with the
   uniform board (a standard configuration currently used commercially).

Abstract = {{Much of the ecology of rare bumblebee species remains poorly understood
   and in need of further study. It has recently been suggested that
   differences in the range and rate of decline among bumblebee species may
   relate to differences in their degree of habitat specialization. We
   examine biotope use by 17 bumblebee species in the Hebrides, southern UK
   and South Island, New Zealand. We identify a cluster of widespread and
   abundant species that occur in almost all biotopes and exploit man-made
   environments such as gardens and arable margins, this group
   corresponding to the ``mainland ubiquitous{''} species of previous
   studies. A second grouping of species includes those associated to
   varying degrees with heathland. It is notable that some species occupy
   markedly different biotopes in different parts of their range; for
   example B. soroeensis is found largely on upland heaths in the Hebrides,
   but on calcareous grassland in the south. Some species, such as B.
   subterraneus and B. distinguendus, now survive only in specific rare
   biotopes and could be mistaken for habitat specialists, but it is clear
   from their historic distributions that they formerly occupied a broader
   range of biotopes. Surviving populations of several of the species that
   have declined most (B. distinguendus, B. sylvarum, B. muscorum sladeni,
   B. humilis) exhibit a markedly coastal distribution, when once they were
   widespread inland. We suggest that this is probably simply because some
   coastal biotopes are less amenable to agricultural improvement, and so
   more have escaped the detrimental effects of intensive farming. Our
   results concur with previous suggestions that bumblebees are generally
   not habitat specialists, so that the conservation of most bumblebee
   species could be achieved by restoration of flower-rich unimproved
   meadows.}},

   We isolated and characterized eight microsatellite loci in these
   species. Additionally, one of 13 primers developed for Rhododendron
   metternichii was available in these species. The expected heterozygosity
   of these nine markers ranged from 0.06 to 0.93 in P. aleutica and from
   0.09 to 0.96 in P. caerulea. These markers may be useful to reveal the
   mating system evolution, patterns of pollen flow and the process of

Abstract = {{Pollination syndromes lead to questions concerning the role of different
   suites of pollinators on the pollination success of plants. Escallonia
   myrtoidea exhibits floral traits associated with pollination by diurnal

   pollinator visits and pollination success in flowers exposed to diurnal
   and nocturnal pollinators in a factorial design. We also assessed
   pollinator dependency and limitations for seed set through hand self-
   and hand cross-pollination tests. Flowers were visited mainly by bees
   rather than by butterflies or moths. Neither diurnal nor nocturnal
   pollinators had any effect on seed set over the seed set of always
   bagged inflorescences, while hand cross-pollinated flowers produced
   significantly more seeds than hand self-pollinated flowers or flowers
   exposed to diurnal and/or nocturnal pollinators. Thus, E. myrtoidea, a
   tree strongly pollinator-limited for seed setting, exhibited a lack of
   coupling among floral traits, pollinators, and reproductive success.}},

Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{506-514}},

Abstract = {{Plant defenses against herbivores may be costly if they exclude
   mutualists. Here, I test the hypothesis that aggressive ant bodyguards
   of plants deter pollinators, and explore mechanisms by which Ferocactus
   wislizeni, an extrafloral nectary bearing cactus, limits conflicts
   between its pollinators and bodyguards. Flower visitation by ants and
   pollinating bees differed among plants tended by four different ant
   species. The ant species most rarely found in flowers showed the
   strongest aversion to F. wislizeni flower petals in laboratory assays,
   suggesting that those structures may include an ant-deterrent.
   Species-specific estimates of mean ant abundance within flowers and
   aggressiveness towards other arthropods were used to distinguish the
   relative threat of ant attack in flowers on plants tended by each ant
   species. Pollinator surveys in 2003 and 2004 demonstrated that bee
   visitation rates and the duration of flower occupation differed among
   plants with different ant associates, decreasing as the threat of ant
   attack increased. Flowers on plants tended by Solenopsis xyloni, the
   best ant bodyguard, were more dangerous than those on plants tended by
   three milder species, due to that ants' greater aggressiveness and
   abundance within flowers. These flowers were visited by pollinators
   least frequently and for less time per visit, and produced fruits with
   significantly lower total seed mass, fewer seeds, and lighter individual
   seeds, relative to fruits from similarly-sized plants tended by three
   other ant species. As a result, the best bodyguard may indirectly
   constrain plant reproduction in some settings. Conflicts between
   mutualistic guilds may be particularly common in generalized systems,
   where there is variation in partner quality and in the relative
   importance of the protection and pollination mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in bee populations have been documented in several parts of the
   world. Bees are dependent upon flowering plants for resources, and
   flowering plants often depend upon bees for pollination services. Bees
   can therefore serve as indicator species of habitat degradation due to
   these relationships with flowering plants. This study investigates how
   the bumble bee community in San Francisco has responded to urbanization
   and which urban park characteristics are important for the current
   community's structure. To answer these questions we. sampled bumble
   bees, in 18 urban parks and two nearby wild parks. We estimated park
   characteristics and used multiple regression analysis to determine which
   characteristics predicted bumble bee abundance and species richness.
   Bumble bee abundance was positively associated with resource
   availability or proxies of resource availability; ``natural area{''}
   (areas that contain remnant fragments that have been largely unchanged
   by human activity) in 2003 and nest site abundance and openness of the
   surrounding matrix in both 2003 and 2004. Bumble bee species richness
   was negatively associated with abundance of a dominant species, Bombus
   vosnesenskii, in 2004. The importance of the surrounding matrix suggests
   that these parks do not act as islands. Accordingly, area of park did
   not explain species richness, while abundance of the dominant competitor
   did. The species that was most influenced by competition, Bombus
   sitkensis, uses rodent holes as nest sites and is possibly excluded from
   nest sites by the early emerging B. vosnesenskii, another subterranean
   nester. The species least influenced by competition, Bombus melanopygus,
   is able to use both rodent holes and abandoned bird nests as nest sites.

Abstract = {{Mediterranean landscapes comprise a complex mosaic of different habitats
   that vary in the diversity of their floral communities, pollinator
   communities and pollination services. Using the Greek Island of Lesvos
   as a model system, we assess the biodiversity value of six common
   habitats and measure ecosystemic `health' using pollen grain deposition
   in three core flowering plants as a measure of pollination services.
   Three fire-driven habitats were assessed: freshly burnt areas, fully
   regenerated pine forests and intermediate age scrub; in addition we
   examined oak woodlands, actively managed olive groves and groves that
   had been abandoned from agriculture. Oak woodlands, pine forests and
   managed olive groves had the highest diversity of bees. The habitat
   characteristics responsible for structuring bee communities were: floral
   diversity, floral abundance, nectar energy availability and the variety
   of nectar resources present. Pollination services in two of our plant
   species, which were pollinated by a limited sub-set of the pollinator
   community, indicated that pollination levels were highest in the burnt
   and mature pine habitats. The third species, which was open to all
   flower visitors, indicated that oak woodlands had the highest levels of
   pollination from generalist species. Pollination was always more
   effective in managed olive groves than in abandoned groves. However, the
   two most common species of bee, the honeybee and a bumblebee, were not
   the primary pollinators within these habitats. We conclude that the
   three habitats of greatest overall value for plant-pollinator
   communities and provision of the healthiest pollination services are
   pine forests, oak woodland and managed olive groves. We indicate how the
   highest value habitats may be maintained in a complex landscape to
   safeguard and enhance pollination function within these habitats and
   potentially in adjoining agricultural areas. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The nectary of Hedera helix is situated above the inferior ovary and
   completely exposed to the external environment. It consists of
   parenchyma containing chlorophyll overlying vascular bundles with xylem
   and phloem. The nectar exudes from stomata. Nectary color varied from
   green to brown during the flowering period (mid-September to early
   November). This change in color resulted from accumulation of
   anthocyanins in subepidermal layers of the parenchyma. Quantitative
   differences were observed in the photosynthetic pigments of nectaries
   and leaves. Their quantitative variations, associated with variation in
   environmental parameters ( temperature and rainfall) during flowering,
   were different in the two organs: the quantity of photosynthetic
   pigments increased in leaves at the end of flowering, whereas an
   increase principally in beta-carotene was observed in nectaries,
   suggesting that the nectary protected the inferior ovary from sunlight.
   Nectar was produced in greater abundance but with lower sugar
   concentration at the start of flowering, but the total quantity of
   sugars it contained did not vary significantly during flowering. The
   relative concentration of sugars showed slight variations that were not
   associated with significant changes in pollinators, which were mainly
   bees and flies.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects are known to leave lipid footprints while walking on smooth
   surfaces. Presumably, the deposited substances improve tarsal adhesion.
   In bumblebees, footprint hydrocarbons also function as scent marks that
   allow detection and avoidance of recently depleted flowers. I used GC-MS
   to detect hydrocarbons deposited by bumblebee (Bombus pascuorum) on
   flowers of Lamium maculatum. In addition to the plants' own cuticular
   lipids, extracts of corollas that had been visited by bumblebees
   contained odd-numbered alkenes. The amount of pentacosenes (C25H50) on
   corollas was linearly related to the number of bumblebee visits, with
   workers depositing approximately 16 ng per visit (extrapolated to a
   total of 65 ng of bumblebee cuticular hydrocarbons). Pentacosenes were
   retained on visited flowers without loss for 2 hr, and probably longer.
   This and results from flight cage experiments suggest that flower
   epicuticles retain a chemical record of pollinator visitation, including
   information on visiting bee species. Continuous footprint accumulation
   necessitates new explanations concerning the reversibility of
   ``repellent scent marks{''} of bumblebees.}},

Abstract = {{Human-altered landscapes dominate the planet, yet little is known about
   their capacity to sustain plant functional diversity. Most
   conservation-orientated studies of such landscapes focus on species
   diversity, whereas less attention is given to functional traits and
   their conservation.
   We examine the functional diversity of herbaceous and shrubby plant
   communities in three forest habitats (understorey, tree-fall gaps and
   riverbanks) and three deforested habitats (pasture, roadside vegetation
   and pasture riverbanks), each replicated in three human-dominated
   landscapes in southern Costa Rica. We focus on six categorical traits
   related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination
   mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and
   seed size.
   We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in
   forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat,
   bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and
   monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these
   landscapes.
   Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from
   deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait
   state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state
   composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were
   compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for
   multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between
   forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with
   a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when
   the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and
   bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits
   were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with
   fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats.
   Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and
   locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested
   and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far
   more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent
   patterns found previously for species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The Everglades (Florida, USA) is a mosaic of different habitats.
   Tropical and temperate trees grow on patches of high ground (tree
   islands) surrounded by lower elevation wetland communities (marl
   prairie).
   Tree islands of various sizes provide nesting substrate, larval host
   plants and floral resources for insect pollinators. Herbaceous plants in
   the open surrounding wetlands may also depend on these pollinators.
   We investigated pollinator diversity and abundances in both tree island
   and marl prairie habitats using transect sampling methods and estimated
   pollination success of the milkweed Asclepias lanceolata, an
   insect-pollinated marl prairie species, in relation to distance from and
   size of the closest tree island.
   On a total of 11 bayhead tree islands, we found that insect diversity
   and abundance were greater on the edge of larger tree islands (20-30
   m(2)) than on smaller tree islands (5-10 m(2)). Pollinator diversity and
   abundance in the marl prairie decreased with increasing distance from
   tree islands.
   Pairs of potted A. lanceolata plants were placed in the marl prairie at
   distances up to 1000 m from small and large tree islands. Fruit and seed
   production were highest for plants placed less than 25 m from tree
   islands and decreased with increasing distance.
   Our results suggest that tree islands are an important source of
   pollinators for the plants in the tree island and surrounding wetland
   habitats.
   This landscape-based study illustrates how overall landscape structure
   affects important biotic interactions, particularly plant-pollinator
   relationships. Our findings have far-reaching ecological implications
   for the reproductive success of plants in small, isolated populations
   that may depend on insect vectors for pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar-foraging animals are known to utilize nectar guides - patterns of
   visual contrast in flowers - to find hidden nectar. However, few studies
   have explored the potential for mechanosensory cues to function as
   nectar guides, particularly for nocturnal pollinators such as the
   tobacco hornworm moth, Manduca sexta. We used arrays of artificial
   flowers to investigate the flower handling behavior (the ability to
   locate and drink from floral nectaries) of naive moths, looking
   specifically at: (1) how the shape and size of flat (two-dimensional)
   artificial corollas affect nectar discovery and (2) whether
   three-dimensional features of the corolla can be used to facilitate
   nectar discovery. In these experiments, we decoupled visual from tactile
   flower features to explore the role of mechanosensory input, putatively
   attained via the extended proboscides of hovering moths. In addition, we
   examined changes in nectar discovery times within single foraging bouts
   to test whether moths can learn to handle different kinds of artificial
   flowers. We found that corolla surface area negatively affects flower
   handling efficiency, and that reliable mechanosensory input is crucial
   for the moths' performance. We also found that three-dimensional
   features of the corolla, such as grooves, can significantly affect the
   foraging behavior, both positively (when grooves converge to the
   nectary) and negatively (when grooves are unnaturally oriented). Lastly,
   we observed that moths can decrease nectar discovery time during a
   single foraging bout. This apparent learning ability seems to be
   possible only when reliable mechanosensory input is available.}},

   of males and females of three bee species on five plant species in

   males spent less time in each flower increasing their foraging
   efficiency at this scale. The overall average visit frequencies of
   females and males was 27.2 and 21.6 visits per flower per minute
   respectively. Females flew shorter distances increasing their visit
   frequency, relative foraging efficiency and their probability to
   pollinate. The proportion of conspecific pollen was higher on females,
   indicating higher floral constancy and pollination probability. The
   longer flights of males increase their probability to cross-pollinate.
   Our results indicate that female solitary bees are more efficient
   foragers; females seem also to be more efficient pollinators but males
   contribute more to long-distance pollen flow.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the physical and temporal isolation of two arthropod guilds
   interacting with Drosera anglica Huds., a terrestrial carnivorous plant.
   Flowers are separated from basal trap leaves by a leafless stalk. Since
   arthropods are potentially employed both as prey and pollinators, we
   asked whether separation of traps from flowers reduces the frequency
   with which flower visitors are captured by the leaves. Plants captured
   prey throughout the season, with peak trapping activity occurring before
   flowering began. The diverse prey spectrum included at least 109 species
   in 94 genera in 26 of 37 identified families representing 11 arthropod
   orders. The most common prey were adult flies of Nematocera,
   particularly Ceratopogonidae (50\%) and Chironomidae (42\%). The
   following taxa were periodically abundant: Acarina,
   Diptera-Cecidomyiidae, Chloropidae, Sciaridae, Hemiptera nymphs and
   Thysanoptera-Thripidae. Flies (Diptera) were chief flower visitors
   (95\%), dominated by Syrphidae (66\%), Bombyliidae and Muscidae (10\%
   each), Calliphoridae (7\%), Tachinidae and Dolichopodidae (3\% each).
   Additionally, visitors were a bee (Hymenoptera-Halictidae) and thrips
   (Thysanoptera-Thripidae). Four families were common to both guilds:
   Diptera-Dolichopodidae, Muscidae, Tachinidae; and
   Thysanoptera-Thripidae. However, direct comparisons of identified taxa
   within these families showed that overlap between flower visitors and
   prey occurred for Thrips sp. larvae alone, which comprised only 3\% of
   all flower visitors and 0.5\% of prey. Drosera anglica exploits distinct
   guilds of insects for pollinators and prey.}},

Abstract = {{Main trends in the formation of biotopic complexes of bumblebees in the
   northern taiga zone are analyzed. It is proposed that Eurasian forest
   species of bumblebees (Bombus (Th.) schrencki, B. (Mg.) consobrinus,
   etc.) are coadaptively connected with entomophilous plant species
   belonging to the synusia of Eurosiberian riverine-mountain meadow tall
   herbage, with the numbers of species in both biotic groups (pollinating
   insects and plants) and their abundance being greater in the landscape
   characterized by a high degree of karstification. In the biotopic
   bumblebee complex of a large river valley, the relative abundance of
   forest bumblebee species is 2.5-5.3 times lower than in other complexes,
   whereas that of meadow species is two orders of magnitude higher due to
   favorable thermal conditions and a large number of habitats with
   mesophilic herbage and legumes. Each of the distinct ecogeographic
   groups of bumblebees and the corresponding synusiae (each comprising
   entomophilous plants of different taxonomic groups) appear to be
   coadapted. This is probably a result of the diffuse coevolution of
   pollinators and plants belonging to the genetically unified biota.}},

Abstract = {{Angiosperms display flowers in many three-dimensional arrangements, but
   the functional significance of this diversity is largely unknown. We
   examined influences of inflorescence architecture on pollination and
   mating by quantifying the responses of bumblebees to three architectures
   and then using these observations as the basis of a model that simulated
   pollen dispersal. On artificial panicles, racemes, and umbels, each with
   12 identical flowers, bees visited one more flower, on average, on
   umbels than on panicles (with racemes being intermediate). In contrast
   to this weak response, the consistency of foraging paths among flowers
   differed strongly among architectures (racerne > panicle > umbel). The
   simulation raceme 1 panicle 1 umbel model revealed limited differences
   in self-pollination and pollen export among the three inflorescence
   designs when all flowers presented and received pollen, because mating
   differences depended on only the number of flowers visited. In contrast,
   in simulations of inflorescences on which pollen receipt and
   presentation were segregated so as to minimize interference among
   flowers, the consistency of movement paths governed mating. In this
   case, racemes self-pollinated much less than umbels (with panicles being
   intermediate), and racemes exported much more pollen than umbels and
   panicles. These effects have diverse consequences for the evolution of
   inflorescence architecture, flower design, and sexual segregation.}},

Title = {{The genetic diversity of two Brazilian Vellozia (Velloziaceae) with
   different patterns of spatial distribution and pollination biology}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{585-592}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{center dot Background and Aims The genetic structure and variability of
   two species of Vellozia (Velloziaceae) with restricted distribution in
   high-altitude quartzitic fields in south-eastern Brazil were studied.
   Vellozia epidendroides is short, grows on pebbly or sandy soil, and is
   pollinated by bees. Vellozia leptopetala is arborescent, grows on rock
   outcrops, and is pollinated by bees and hummingbirds. Both are
   self-incompatible and have a short, massive flowering strategy. The
   study aimed to associate differences in their genetic diversity and
   structure with their microhabitat distribution and pollination ecology.
   center dot Methods Leaves from 106 and 139 plants of V. epidendroides
   and V. leptopetala, respectively, were collected from five patches of
   each species and prepared for electrophoretic analyses.
   center dot Key Results Five enzyme systems could be reliably scored for
   both species. Vellozia epidendroides showed 100 \% of the loci
   polymorphic for almost all patches. The average number of alleles per
   locus ranged between 2.2 and 2.4 among patches. The Wright's fixation
   index (F) for this species was 0.226. A significant theta(p) value
   indicates that there is a reasonable genetic divergence among patches.
   Vellozia leptopetala presented 47.5 \% of polymorphic loci. All levels
   of P, A, A(p) and of heterozygosities were lower than those of V.
   epidendroides. Vellozia leptopetala showed high inbreeding within
   patches.
   center dot Conclusions The relatively high values of genetic diversity
   indices found for V. epidendroides may be associated with its large and
   widespread populations. On the other hand, the low values of genetic
   diversity found for V. leptopetala may be related to physical isolation
   on outcrops and intensive foraging by territorial hummingbirds, which
   may hinder gene flow among patches, aggravated by the very restricted
   seed dispersal characteristic of the genus, that facilitates sibling
   mating. It is important to stress the need to preserve the specific
   habitats of these species of Vellozia, in particular those of V.
   leptopetala that has lower genetic diversity and is restricted to rock
   outcrop environments.}},

Abstract = {{Many services generated by forest ecosystems provide essential support
   for human well-being. However, the vulnerability of these services to
   environmental change such as forest fragmentation are still poorly
   understood. We present spatial modeling of the generation of ecosystem
   services in a human-dominated landscape where forest habitat patches,
   protected by local taboos, are located in a matrix of cultivated land in
   southern Madagascar. Two ecosystem services dependent on the forest
   habitats were addressed: (1) crop pollination services by wild and
   semidomesticated bees (Apoidea), essential for local crop production of,
   for example, beans, and (2) seed dispersal services based on the
   presence of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We studied the
   vulnerability of these ecosystem services to a plausible scenario of
   successive destruction of the smallest habitat patches. Our results
   indicate that, in spite of the fragmented nature of the landscape, the
   fraction of the landscape presently covered by both crop pollination and
   seed dispersal services is surprisingly high. It seems that the taboo
   system, though indirectly and unintentionally, contributes to upholding
   the generation of these services by protecting the forest patches. Both
   services are, however, predicted to be very vulnerable to the successive
   removal of small patches. For crop pollination, the rate of decrease in
   cover was significant even when only the smallest habitat patches were
   removed. The capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape displayed
   several thresholds with habitat patch removal. Our results suggest that,
   in order to maintain capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape
   and crop pollination cover in southern Androy, the geographical location
   of the remaining forest patches is more crucial than their size. We
   argue that in heavily fragmented production landscapes, small forest
   patches should increasingly be viewed as essential for maintaining
   ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, and also should be
   considered in the ongoing process of tripling the area of protected
   habitats in Madagascar.}},

Abstract = {{I investigated reproduction in a three-year study of Echinacea
   augustifolia, purple coneflower, growing in a fragmented prairie
   landscape. I quantified the local abundance of flowering conspecifics at
   individual-based spatial scales and at a population-based spatial scale.
   Regression analyses revealed that pollen limitation increased while seed
   set and fecundity decreased with isolation of individual plants.
   Isolation, defined as the distance to the kth nearest flowering
   conspecific, was a good predictor of pollen limitation, for all nearest
   neighbors considered (k = 1-33), but the strength of the relationship,
   as quantified by R-2, peaked at intermediate scales (k = 2-18). The
   relationship of isolation to seed set and fecundity was similarly
   strongest at intermediate scales (k = 3-4). The scale dependence of
   individual density effects on reproduction (density of flowering plants
   within x meters) resembled that of isolation. Analyses at a
   population-based scale showed that pollen limitation declined
   significantly with population size. Seed set and fecundity also declined
   with population size, but significantly so only in 1998. Whether
   quantifying local abundance with population- or individual-based
   measures, reproductive failure due to pollen limitation is a consistent
   consequence of Echinacea scarcity. However, individual-based measures of
   local abundance predicted pollen limitation from a wider sample of
   plants with a simpler model than did Population size. Specifically, the
   largest site, a nature preserve, is composed of plants with intermediate
   individual isolation and, as predicted, intermediate pollen limitation,
   but its large population size poorly predicted population mean pollen
   limitation.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. The effect of floral display size (number of open flowers per plant)
   on subsequent plant choice by bumble bees, Bombus hypocrita sapporensis
   (Cockerell), was investigated using artificial inflorescences with blue
   or yellow flowers representing different `species'.
   2. Bees flew to an inflorescence of the same colour (constant flight)
   more often after visiting a large inflorescence. This response occurred
   when the nectar volume per flower was constant (larger inflorescence
   offered more nectar), and when nectar volume per inflorescence was
   constant (nectar volume per flower varied with display size). These
   results indicate that bees did not exhibit higher constancy after
   visiting larger inflorescences because they extracted more nectar than
   from smaller ones.
   3. Bees spent more time during visits to large vs small inflorescences.
   Possibly information about the last-visited inflorescence fades from
   short-term memory during longer visits, which strengthens colour
   constancy.
   4. Selection on floral display size is thought to balance the attraction
   benefits of large displays with the cost of geitonogamy. However, in
   habitats with several competing plant species, selection for colour
   constancy may provide a further reason for selection to favour large
   floral displays.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination is a principal means of gene dispersal in
   animal-pollinated plants. Theoretically, gene dispersal can be predicted
   from pollinator movements and their associated patterns of
   flower-to-flower gene dispersal, or paternity shadow, but quantifying
   the paternity shadow under field conditions is problematic.
   2. We developed a mathematical method to quantify the paternity shadow
   from a simple field experiment by initially stating the problem in
   matrix algebra, then using a least-squares regression to find the
   paternity shadow that best explained the observed spatial distribution
   of gene dispersal, given the observed pollinator movements.
   3. We applied the method to data on the dispersion of a marker gene
   along rows of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) pollinated by bumble bees
   (Bombus spp.) and thereby produced the first field-based paternity
   shadow. When coupled with observed movements of bumble bees, this
   paternity shadow explained virtually all (r(2) = 90\%) of the dispersion
   of the marker gene.
   4. Close similarity between our result and a paternity shadow obtained
   for B. napus in a separate laboratory experiment suggests that the
   paternity shadow is a fundamental attribute of the Bombus-B. napus
   interaction.}},

   arable weeds as a case study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{246-257}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Little is known about the pollinators of rare plants, which is cause
   for concern given that pollination is essential for the long-term
   survival of most plant species. The aim of this study was to determine
   the probable pollinators of three species of rare arable weed: red
   hemp-nettle Galeopsis angustifolia, small-flowered catchfly Silene
   gallica and spreading hedge-parsley Torilis arvensis. Species of arable
   weed are among those suffering the greatest declines in the UK.
   2. Five field sites were chosen, two of which were sampled in 2 years.
   Visitation and pollen transport webs were constructed for the entire
   plant-pollinator community at each site. Visitation webs described the
   frequency with which each insect species visited each plant species.
   Pollen transport webs quantified which insect species transported the
   pollen of which plant species.
   3. A wide range of insect species visited the three plant species. A
   pollinator importance index was calculated that combined information on
   both the relative abundance of each insect carrying the pollen of the
   rare plant and its pollen fidelity. Using this method Galeopsis
   angustifolia was most likely to be pollinated by Bombus pascuorum at one
   site and Sphaerophoria scripta at another. Silene gallica was also
   likely be pollinated by Sphaerophoria scripta.
   4. The pollinator fauna of the three plant species varied considerably
   across their geographical range, but less from one year to the next.
   5. Synthesis and applications. All three species of rare plant were
   linked to other plant species in the community by shared pollinators. In
   many cases these other plant species constituted the primary food
   sources for the shared pollinators. Therefore, the long-term survival of
   rare plant populations is likely to depend on the more common plant
   species in the community. We recommend that management of the rare
   plants studied here should also include the protection and management of
   populations of some of the more common plant species in their respective
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we evaluate the potential of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens
   Cresson, obtained from commercial colonies, as a pollen vector for
   lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium augustifolium Aiton. We wanted to gain
   insight into the relationships between pollination by introduced bumble
   bees, the categories of seeds produced, and the weight and the maturity
   of the blueberries. The effect of B. impatiens foraging in blueberry
   stands was measured quantitatively through fruit set and seed set
   analysis. We created a density gradient of B. impatiens by clustering 72
   small hives at the southern extremity of blueberry fields located in
   Girardville (49 degrees 00'N, 72 degrees 33'W), Quebec, Canada.
   Observers recorded plant and insect data in 52 plots of 1 by 10 m,
   distributed at distances ranging from 25 to 1,500 m from the hives. From
   these data, we evaluated the fruit set rate, the weight and maturity of
   the berries, and the number of seed structures per berry, including true
   seeds of large, medium, and small size, pseudo-seeds, and ovules.
   Positive correlations were found between the density of B. impatiens and
   fruit set as well as the number of large seeds per berry. Large seeds
   influenced the weight and maturity of berries. B. impatiens acted as a
   ``near-nest central forager{''} and increased fruit set and seed

Abstract = {{Two longleaf pine savanna communities, upland woodlands and wet pine
   flatwoods, occur in Louisiana. Because these communities differ in soil
   profiles, hydrology, topography, and floral composition and diversity,
   the objective of this study was to determine how bee diversity and
   composition differed between them. We surveyed three upland woodlands
   and one flatwood site over a four year period. Our results indicated
   higher richness and abundance of bees in uplands compared to the wet
   flatwood. Upland sites consistently contained about 10 more species and
   2.5 times as many individuals. Rarefaction curves indicated similar to
   higher rates of species accumulation of upland sites compared to the wet
   site. Similarity in species composition was higher between upland sites
   than between uplands and the wet site. Differences in diversity are
   discussed in relation to differences between savanna types, age and size
   of preserves, and fire management. Size of the preserve appeared to be
   less important than floral diversity and soil type. From a management
   perspective, this study suggested newly restored savannas obtain high
   bee diversity relatively quickly, and small preserves are capable of
   serving as significant reservoirs of bees.}},

   Florida. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 133(2): 303-311. 2006-Little is known about
   the role of mutualistic relationships with local species in promoting or
   limiting introduced invasive plant species. In this study we carried out
   controlled pollination treatments and floral visitor watches at three
   sites varying in degree of human disturbance in central Florida to
   determine the breeding system and potential pollinators of Paederia
   foetida L (skunk vine). A native of eastern Asia, P. foetida is invasive
   in natural and human created habitats in the southern United States and
   Hawaii. Our data suggested that populations of P. foetida in Florida
   were self-incompatible and relied on both small-bodied halictid bees
   native to Florida and the introduced European honey bee for pollination.
   Visitation by native bees was more frequent in less disturbed sites,
   while the opposite was true for the honey bees. Pollinator limitation
   was evident at the relatively undisturbed and the highly disturbed
   sites, but not at the intermediate disturbed site. Mutualistic
   relationships with native pollinators as well as the introduced honey
   bee probably contributed to the establishment and spread of skunk vine
   in Florida.}},

Abstract = {{In alpine ecosystems, microscale variation in snowmelt timing often
   causes different flowering phenology of the same plant species and
   seasonal changes in pollinator activity. We compared the variations in
   insect visitation, pollen dispersal, mating patterns, and sexual
   reproduction of Rhododendron aureum early and late in the flowering
   season using five microsatellites. Insects visiting the flowers were
   rare early in the flowering season (mid-June), when major pollinators
   were bumblebee queens and flies. In contrast, frequent visitations by
   bumblebee workers were observed late in the season (late July).
   Two-generation analysis of pollen pool structure demonstrated that
   quality of pollen-mediated gene flow was more diverse late in the season
   in parallel with the high pollinator activity. The effective number of
   pollen donors per fruit (N-ep) increased late in the season (N-ep =
   2.2-2.7 early, 3.4-4.4 late). However, both the outcrossing rate (t(m))
   and seed-set ratio per fruit were smaller late in the season (t(m) =
   0.89 and 0.71, seed-set ratio = 0.52 and 0.18, early and late in the
   season, respectively). In addition, biparental inbreeding occurred only
   late in the season. We conclude that R. aureum shows contrasting
   patterns of pollen movement and seed production between early and late
   season: in early season, seed production can be high but genetically
   less diverse and, during late season, be reduced, possibly due to higher
   inbreeding and inbreeding depression, but have greater genetic
   diversity. Thus, more pollinator activity does not always mean more
   pollen movement.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history characteristics and demography of Trillium tschonoskii
   (Trilliaceae) were studied and are described here. Trillium tschonoskii
   is the most wide-ranging species among Asiatic Trillium, ranging from
   southern Sakhalin, the Japanese Islands (excepting Kyushu) to the Korean
   Peninsula, Taiwan and further to inland China and the Himalayas. The
   ecological range of T. tschonoskii is broad, extending from lowland
   forests to montane and further to subalpine mixed forests consisting of
   conifers and subalpine birch, Betula ermani. This species is a typical
   polycarpic perennial, similar to all other Japanese Trillium species,
   and flowers in early to late April in lowland populations and in
   mid-June to early July in subalpine habitats. Trillium tschonoskii
   typically has three white petals and three sepals, and its pollinators
   are diverse, for example, flies, beetles and bees such as Scatophagiae
   (Diptera), Oedemera lucidicollis (Coleoptera) and Andrena sp.
   (Hymenoptera). Pollen/ovule ratios of T. tschonoskii are approximately
   700, thus T. tschonoskii is potentially an inbreeder. Seed outputs per
   plant are variable, 29-190 (mean 85.0) in 1980, and 28-168 (mean 79.8)
   in 1984. Seeds with a large soft juicy elaiosome attract ants, which are
   effective dispersal agents, but nocturnal elaiosome predators, mainly
   ground beetles, are also very active. Our long-term observations
   indicate that it takes approximately 10 years to reach a sexually mature
   stage and the life expectancy of mature plants is assumed to be
   exceedingly long, extending over 40 years.}},

Abstract = {{The wasp family Heterogynaidae is described and previous phylogenetic
   hypotheses on its position within the Apoidea are discussed. The higher
   level phylogeny of the Apoidea based on sequence data of a nuclear gene,
   long-wavelength (LW) opsin, is analysed for the first time. Although
   preliminary because of limited taxon sampling and use of a single gene,
   the analysis reveals some significant results. Monophyly of the Apoidea,
   including the Heterogynaidae, is supported strongly, as is monophyly of
   Heterogynaidae. The monophyly of the bees is also confirmed, but support
   is rather weak. Monophyly of the Ampulicidae + Sphecidae, which is the
   sister group to the remaining Apoidea (Crabronidae + Anthophila +
   Heterogynaidae), is confirmed. Our results imply that Sphecidae may be
   paraphyletic with respect to Ampulicidae, and Crabronidae with respect
   to bees and Heterogynaidae. Remarkably, Heterogynaidae is well nested
   within the Crabronidae + Anthophila clade, which is in conflict with the
   morphological data. This result implies that Heterogynaidae may not have
   originated from a basal node within Apoidea, as previously considered,
   and that the character states presumed to be plesiomorphies may instead
   be homoplasies. Our analysis confirms the value of LW opsin in resolving
   deeper nodes within Apoidea. A new species, Heterogyna nocticola Ohl,
   from the Sultanate of Oman is described based on both sexes, with a
   diagnosis, information on distribution and collecting period. A key to
   the Palaearctic species of Heterogynaidae is presented.}},

   species were hermaphrodites, dioecious or monecious. We assessed the
   breeding systems of each species with hand self-pollinations. About 55\%
   of the species produced small white and inconspicuous flowers. The
   majority of the flowers opened at dawn and was visited by diurnal
   pollinators. The proportion of dioecious; and monoecious species was
   lower than for other tropical forests. Among the hermaphrodites, the
   majority had mixed mating systems. Therefore the overall levels of
   obligate outcrossers (37\%) were low compared with other tropical
   forests. We recognized 7 pollination modes: social bees, solitary bees,
   diverse insects, flies, sunbird, sphingid moth and Xylocopa sp. Among
   these the social bees, flies and diverse insects visited more species

Abstract = {{center dot Background and Aims Gesneriaceae is a pantropical plant
   family with over 3000 species. A great variety of pollination mechanisms
   have been reported for the neotropical members of the family, but the
   details of buzz-pollination and enantiostyly for the family have not
   been described. We investigated the floral biology and pollination
   ecology of Paraboea rufescens in Xishuangbanna, south-west China,
   considering three aspects: (1) the type of enantiostyly exhibited; (2)
   whether the species is self-compatible; and (3) whether pollinator
   behaviour could enhance the precision of pollen transfer between flowers
   of contrasting stylar orientation.
   center dot Methods Flowering phenology was monitored once a month during
   vegetative growth, and once a week during flowering both in the field
   and under cultivation. Pollination manipulations and pollinator
   observation in the field were conducted.
   center dot Key Results Anthesis occurred early during the morning, and
   flowers remained open for 1-5 d, depending on weather conditions.
   Controlled pollinations revealed that P. rufescens is self-compatible,
   and exhibited inbreeding depression in seed set. Plants were pollinator
   limited in natural populations. The similar stylar deflection among
   flowers within a plant limits autonomous self-pollination as well as
   pollination between flowers. Two species of bumble bees (Bombus spp.),
   Amegila malaccensis and Nomia sp. effectively pollinated P. rufescens.
   These pollinators visited flowers in search of pollen with almost the
   same frequency. None of the pollinators appeared to discriminate between
   left- or right-handed flowers.
   center dot Conclusions Paraboea rufescens exhibits monomorphic
   enantiostylous flowers and a buzz-pollination syndrome. Floral
   morphology in P. rufescens and pollinator foraging behaviour seems
   likely to reduce self-pollination and pollinations between flowers of
   the same stylar deflection.}},

   bee Anthophora pauperata. Flowers changed colour over time from bright
   yellow (with moderate nectar reward) to pale yellow/white (with
   significantly lower nectar reward). Bee visitation was non-random with
   respect to colour phase availability within the flower population and
   was biased towards the more rewarding flowers. At plants where the
   availability of colour phases had been manipulated experimentally to
   produce `bright' or `pale' plants, bees visited significantly more
   flowers (and for longer periods) on the bright plants. The change of
   flower colour was not simply age-related; we observed variation in the
   temporal course of colour change and our data suggest that visitation,
   leading to deposition of cross-pollen, can accelerate the process. In
   subpopulations with limited pollinators, Alkanna can influence bees by
   using their colour-related foraging preferences to alter visitation
   patterns. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated changes in a wild bee community by repeating a detailed
   historical study of bee biodiversity in Ontario. In 1968 and 1969
   (period 1), an inventory of bee species was taken from an old field
   habitat in southern Ontario. We resampled the bee fauna in 2002 and 2003
   (period 2), following the same methods. Bee species richness, diversity,
   and evenness were significantly greater in period 2, and this was
   observed in all functional guilds except wood-nesting, pollen
   specialist, and normative bees. In period 2, a total of 150 bee species
   were found (2002, 98 species; 2003, 143 species), whereas in period 1, a
   total of 105 species were found (1968, 98 species-, 1969, 76 species).
   Although 90 bee species collected in period I were re-collected in
   period 2, bee community composition was remarkably different between
   periods, with an estimated community similarity of only 7.5\%. Changes
   in the bee fauna, specifically the increase in the proportions of pollen
   specialist and wood-nesting bees, might be best explained by changes in
   the habitat as a result of succession over the intervening 34 years. We
   compare and contrast our findings of bee community change with the
   published literature and discuss the possible factors driving the
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination of a total of 155 plant species was evaluated monthly in
   relation to flowering phenology, habitats, and life forms in the
   Venezuelan Central Plain. The relationships between flowering phenology
   and pollinating agent classes and their abundance were evaluated. The
   total number of pollinating agent classes was significantly correlated
   with the number of plant species for habitats and life forms, and at the
   community level. The number of pollinating agent classes did not change
   statistically with respect to flowering phenology for life form,
   habitats, and overall community, but the number of pollinting agent
   classes increased from the dry season to the rainy season for overall
   community and habitats, except for forest. The abundance of pollinating
   agents was significantly affected by flowering time. A cluster analysis
   revealed that the abundance of pollinating agent classes differed
   throughout the year, separating the dry and rainy seasons. Two trends
   were found in the temporal pattern of the nine pollinating agents: (1)
   nonseasonal, in which flowering of bat- and bird-pollinated species did
   not change drastically throughout the year; and (2) seasonal, in which
   the number of bee-, butterfly-, fly-, wasp-, moth-, beetle-, and
   wind-pollinated species changed throughout the year, increasing from the
   dry to the rainy season at the community level. The number of
   pollinating bees, butterflies, flies, and wasps peaked during the dry
   season for trees and shrubs, and therefore for forest. The number of
   moth-pollinated species increased from the mid-dry season to the rainy
   season, with a peak during the dry-rainy transition period. Beetle- and
   wind-pollinated species are phenologically concentrated in the rainy
   season: beetle-pollinated species were mainly in the forest and
   forest-savanna transition, and wind-pollinated species were associated
   with herbaceous species in savanna and disturbed areas. The distribution
   of pollinating agents was affected by seasonality in habitats and life
   forms. Therefore, life form may be considered a proximate element,
   reducing interference in the pollination process at the community level.}},

   a nonadaptive consequence of adaptations for cross-pollination in a
   self-compatible plant with more than one flower open simultaneously. The
   comparison of selfing rate between groups of emasculated and control
   flowers on experimental plants helped quantify the contributions of
   geitonogamous and autogamous selfing to the overall selfing rate. While
   an increased seed set in control flowers indicated reproductive
   assurance, the genotypic data indicated that geitonogamous selfing made
   up the majority of the selfing and that autogamous selfing was
   negligible in the population. We examined whether bumblebees, the major
   pollinator in the population that year, visited control and emasculated
   flowers with equal frequency. We quantified the impact of emasculated
   flowers on the level of geitonogamous selfing in control flowers. After

Abstract = {{Human alteration of natural ecosystems to agroecosystems continues to
   accelerate in tropical countries. The resulting world-wide decline of
   rain forest causes a mosaic landscape, comprising simple and complex
   agroecosystems and patchily distributed rain forest fragments of
   different quality. Landscape context and agricultural management can be
   expected to affect both species diversity and ecosystem services by
   trophic interactions.
   In Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, 24 agroforestry systems, differing in
   the distance to the nearest natural forest (0-1415 m), light intensity
   (37.5-899.6 W/m(-2)) and number of vascular plant species (7-40 species)
   were studied. Ten standardized trap nests for bees and wasps, made from
   reed and knotweed internodes, were exposed in each study site. Occupied
   nests were collected every month, over a period totalling 15 months.
   A total of 13 617 brood cells were reared to produce adults of 14
   trap-nesting species and 25 natural enemy species, which were mostly
   parasitoids. The total number of species was affected negatively by
   increasing distance from forest and increased with light intensity of
   agroforestry systems. The parasitoids in particular appeared to benefit
   from nearby forests. Over a 500-m distance, the number of parasitoid
   species decreased from eight to five, and parasitism rates from 12\% to
   4\%.
   The results show that diversity and parasitism, as a higher trophic
   interaction and ecosystem service, are enhanced by (i) improved
   connectivity of agroecosystems with natural habitats such as
   agroforestry adjacent to rain forest and (ii) management practices to
   increase light availability in agroforestry, which also enhances
   richness of flowering plants in the understorey.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-species floral displays have been hypothesized to facilitate
   pollination by attracting a greater number and/or diversity of
   pollinators. Here I present experimental confirmation of pollination
   facilitation among coflowering plants that have morphologically distinct
   flowers.
   Pollinator visits to Raphanus raphanistrum, a self-incompatible
   herbaceous plant, increased when it occurred with one or a combination
   of Cirsium arvense, Hypericum perforatum and Solidago canadensis than
   when it occurred alone.
   Enhanced visitation to R. raphanistrum in mixed species plots was
   reflected by increased seed production.
   Facilitative effects in pollination were conditional on the density and
   evenness of the floral mixture and graded into competition as the
   relative abundance of R. raphanistrum declined in a two-species mixture.
   Previously proposed mechanisms for facilitative interactions cannot
   explain facilitation among florally distinct plant displays. An
   alternative mechanism of differential but complementary floral rewards
   is proposed to explain facilitative attraction of pollinators.
   Facilitation of, and competition for, pollination has implications for
   regeneration by seed of rare or isolated plants, and of mitigating Allee
   effects that afflict such populations.}},

Abstract = {{While investigating biodiversity patterns on different spatial scales,
   ecological processes determining these patterns have been rarely
   analysed. Flower visitation by bees is an important ecological process
   that is related to floral resource availability. However, little is
   known about whether responses of bee communities to floral resource
   availability change at different spatial scales. We studied density and
   species richness of flower-visiting bees in relation to floral resource
   availability, provided by coffee, in traditional agroforestry systems on
   a field, shrub, and branch scale. On a field scale, mean bee density per
   shrub increased with decreasing proportion of flowering coffee shrubs
   per site, showing a dilution effect. Conversely, on shrub and branch
   scales bee density per shrub, or shrub part, increased with increasing
   number of inflorescences, showing a concentration effect. Additionally,
   bee density per shrub was higher on those that were only partly, rather
   than totally surrounded by other flowering coffee shrubs. Species
   richness of flower-visiting bees was positively affected by high
   resource availability on a shrub and a branch scale, expressed by a high
   number of inflorescences, but at the field scale the proportion of
   flowering shrubs per site did not have any effect on species richness.
   Our results show contrasting responses of the community of
   flower-visiting bees to floral resource availability, depending on the
   spatial scale considered. We conclude that patterns of flower-visiting
   bee communities of only one spatial scale can not be generalized, since
   the number of pollinators may be limited on a field scale, but not on
   smaller scales.}},

Abstract = {{While in most Salvia species pollen is transferred by the `staminal

   also found in the bird pollinated S. haenkei from Bolivia. To understand
   pollen transfer in a species lacking the lever mechanism we carried out
   field investigations and confirmed our observations by means of
   morphometric measurements of both the flowers and museum skins of the
   observed hummingbird species. The tubular corolla forces the birds
   (Sappho sparganura, Colibri coruscans, Patagona gigas, Oreotrochilus
   adela) into a specific position thereby causing pollen transfer from the
   exserted pollen-sacs to the bird's feathers and bills. The staminal
   levers are well developed but cannot be moved because the sterile arms
   are closely attached to the upper face of the corolla leaving no space
   for any movement. We assume that the reduction of the lever mechanism
   reflects an adaptation to bird pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Tangle-veined flies (Nemestrinidae) constitute a primitive and rather
   widespread family among Diptera. The genus Trichophthalma Occurs in
   Australia and South America and is the only one in the family with a
   typically Gondwanian, disjoint distribution. The ecology and
   distribution of most southern South Arnerican species of this genus
   remains Virtually unknown. We Studied the diversity, distribution and
   flower specificity of flower-visiting species of the genus
   Trichophthalma in the temperate forests of southern South America in
   tell sites along an cast-west rainfall gradient (37-40 degrees S) oil
   the eastern slope of the Andes. We recorded nine species of
   Trichophthalma, which showed all overlapped distribution along the
   gradient and different degrees of floral specificity. Three species are
   reported for Argentina for the first lime and three are first recorded
   as flower visitors to the local flora. Our results show that while ill
   Southern Africa tangle-veined flies are engaged in highly specialized
   pollination interactions with long-tubed species, the Trichophthalma
   spp. of Patagonia share their flowers with a diverse and rather
   unspecialized visitor fauna among which several species of flies. bees

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators that frequently visited teak (Tectona grandis L. f.)
   flowers in a wild (W) and a clonal seed orchard (CSO) near the Maegar
   Seed Orchard, Phayao in Thailand were stingless bees and small carpenter
   bees. There were differences between the two habitats in numbers of
   pollen grains deposited on the stigma by these pollinators and in the
   pollinators foraging movements. The mean numbers of pollen grains
   observed on the stigma in the W was lower than in the CSO. Pollinators
   in the CSO moved longer distances, flying among inflorescences rather
   than staying within the same inflorescence. However, there were no
   differences in the number of flowers visited per minute between the two
   habitats. The time pollinators spent on each flower visit did not alter
   the percentage of pollinated flowers. Large pollinators typically landed
   on the tops of the flowers, whereas stingless bees and small carpenter
   bees approached flowers from both the top and side. Trigona collina was
   the most important pollinator in the CSO. It made the most frequent
   visits and contributed to 67\% of teak flowers being pollinated. Its
   foraging time was high in the morning (10:00-12:00 h), which coincided
   with the receptive period of teak flowers. The behavior of other
   pollinators that may promote out-crossing is discussed. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effects of flowering phenology on pollen flow distance

   herb, Primula sieboldii, we investigated the flowering phenology of 1712
   flowers of 97 genets in a population in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, and
   constructed a mating model based on the observed mating pattern, which
   was revealed by paternity analysis using I I microsatellite markers. The
   effects of flowering phenology were inferred by comparing estimated
   pollen flow distance and the level of heterozygosity in the next
   generation between two scenarios. In the first scenario, both the
   intergenet distance and flowering phenology influenced mating
   opportunity, while in the second scenario only intergenet distance
   influenced mating opportunity. Although the frequency distribution of
   pollen flow distance at the population level did not differ
   significantly between the two scenarios, the mean pollen flow distance
   of several flowers increased by more than 10 m as a result of variation
   in flowering phenology. Furthermore, accounting for flowering phenology
   predicted change in heterozygosity in the next generation from -0.04 to
   0.07. The results showed that flowering phenology can affect pollen flow

Year = {{2006}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{288-296}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Male-male competition in plants is thought to exert selection on flower
   morphology and on the temporal presentation of pollen. Theory suggests
   that a plant's pollen dosing strategy should evolve to match the
   abundance and pollen transfer efficiency of its pollinators.
   Simultaneous pollen presentation should be favored when pollinators are
   infrequent or efficient at delivering the pollen they remove, whereas
   gradual dosing should optimize delivery by frequent and wasteful
   pollinators. Among Penstemon and Keckiella species, anthers vary in ways
   that affect pollen release, and the morphology of dried anthers reliably
   indicates how they dispense pollen. In these genera, hummingbird
   pollination has evolved repeatedly from hymenopteran pollination. Pollen
   production does not change with evolutionary shifts between pollinators.
   We show that after we control for phylogeny, hymenopteran-adapted
   species present their pollen more gradually than hummingbird-adapted
   relatives. In a species pair that seemed to defy the pattern, the rhythm
   of anther maturation produced an equivalent dosing effect. These results
   accord with previous findings that hummingbirds can be more efficient
   than bees at delivering pollen.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Backgrounds and Aims The reproductive biology of a community can provide
   answers to questions related to the maintenance of the intraspecific
   pollen flow and reproductive success of populations, sharing and
   competition for pollinators and also questions on conservation of
   natural habitats affected by fragmentation processes. This work
   presents, for the first time, data on the occurrence and frequency of
   plant sexual systems for Caatinga communities, and a review of the
   breeding system studies of Caatinga species.
   Methods The sexual systems of 147 species from 34 families and 91 genera
   occurring in three Caatinga areas in north-eastern Brazil were analysed
   and compared with worldwide studies focusing on reproductive biology of
   different tropical communities.
   Key Results The frequency of hermaphrodite species was 83(.)0\% (122
   species), seven of these (or 4(.)8\% of the total) being heterostylous.
   Monoecy occurred in 9(.)5\% (14) of the species, and andromonoecy in
   4(.)8\% (seven). Only 2(.)7\% (four) of the species were dioecious. A
   high percentage of hermaphrodite species was expected and has been
   reported for other tropical ecosystems. With respect to the breeding
   system studies with species of the Caatinga, the authors' data for 21
   species and an additional 18 species studied by others (n = 39) revealed
   a high percentage (61(.)5\%) of obligatory self-incompatibility.
   Agamospermy was not recorded among the Caatinga studied species.
   Conclusions The plant sexual systems in the Caatinga, despite the
   semi-arid climate, are similar to other tropical dry and wet forest
   communities, including those with high rainfall levels, except for the
   much lower percentage of dioecious species. The high frequency of
   self-incompatible species is similar to that reported for Savanna areas
   in Brazil, and also for dry (deciduous and semideciduous) and humid
   tropical forest communities.}},

Abstract = {{Alien plants may be reproductively limited in exotic habitats because of
   a lack of mutualistic pollinators. However, if plants are adequately
   served by generalist pollinators, successful reproduction,
   naturalisation and expansion into exotic habitats may occur.
   Rhododendron ponticum is very successful, ecologically damaging invasive
   plant in Britain and Ireland, but is in decline in its native Iberian
   habitat. It spreads locally by sending out lateral branches, but for
   longer distance dispersal it relies on sexually produced seeds. Little
   is known about R. ponticum's pollination ecology and breeding biology in
   invaded habitats. We examined the flower-visiting communities and
   maternal reproductive success of R. ponticum in native populations in
   southern Spain and in exotic ones in Ireland. R. ponticum in flowers are
   visited by various generalist (polylectic) pollinator species in both
   native and exotic habitats. Although different species visited flowers
   in Ireland and Spain, the flower visitation rate was not significantly
   different. Insects foraging on R. ponticum in Spain carried less R.
   ponticum pollen than their Irish counterparts, and carried fewer pollen
   types. Fruit production per inflorescence varied greatly within all
   populations but was significantly correlated with visitation at the
   population level. Nectar was significantly depleted by insects in some
   exotic populations, suggesting that this invasive species is providing a
   floral resource for native insects in some parts of Ireland. The
   generality of the pollination system may be factor contributing to
   R.ponticum's success in exotic habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of Changnienia amoena, an endangered terrestrial
   orchid, was investigated at two sites in the Shennongjia Mountains,
   Hubei, central China. The results show that the orchid is exclusively
   pollinated by bumblebees. In Longmenhe, Bombus (Diversobombus)
   trifasciatus is the primary effective pollinator, whereas B.
   (Tricornibombus) imitator is the only pollinator in Guanmenshan. These
   two bumblebees can be treated as a functional group because they carry
   pollinaria on the same position on their bodies and have similar
   pollinating behaviours. The morphological traits of the flower adapt
   precisely to the pollinators. Visitation by bumblebees is mainly in the
   first half of the flowering period of C. amoena. Pollinarium removal and
   pollinia deposition take place when bumblebees withdraw from the flower.
   Crossing experiments show that C. amoena is a self-compatible and
   outcrossing species. Fruit set in this species is low and may result
   from limited pollinators because 87.5\% of individuals set fruits under
   hand-pollination, but only 6-12\% of individuals set fruits under
   natural conditions. These results imply that it is important to conserve
   the pollinator community together with the plants when conservation
   management for this endangered species is undertaken. Artificial
   pollination would also be a useful measure to facilitate restoration of
   the small populations. (c) 2006 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the strong influence of pollination ecology on the evolution of
   selfing, we have little information on how distinct groups of insect
   pollinators influence outcrossing rate. However, differences in behavior
   between pollinator groups could easily influence how each group affects
   outcrossing rate. We examined the influence of distinct insect
   pollinator groups on outcrossing rate in the rocky mountain columbine,
   Aquilegia coerulea. The impact of population size, plant density, size
   of floral display, and herkogamy (spatial separation between anthers and
   stigmas) on outcrossing rate was also considered as these variables were
   previously found to affect outcrossing rate in some plant species. We
   quantified correlations between all independent variables and used
   simple and two-factor regressions to determine direct and indirect
   impact of each independent variable on outcrossing rate. Outcrossing
   rate increased significantly with hawkmoth abundance but not with the
   abundance of any of the other groups of floral visitors, which included
   bumblebees, solitary bees, syrphid flies, and muscidae. Outcrossing rate
   was also significantly affected by floral display size and together,
   hawkmoth abundance and floral display size explained 87\% of the
   variation in outcrossing rate. None of the other independent variables
   directly affected the outcrossing rate. This is the first report of a
   significant impact of pollinator type on outcrossing rate. Hawkmoths did
   not visit fewer flowers per plant relative to other pollinator groups
   but preferred visiting female-phase flowers first on a plant. Both the
   behavior of pollinators and floral display size affected outcrossing
   rate via their impact on the level of geitonogamous (among flower)
   selfing. Given that geitonogamous selling is never advantageous, the
   variation in outcrossing rate and maintenance of mixed mating systems in
   populations of A. coerulea may not require an adaptive explanation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the origin and chemical composition of the queen sex
   pheromone of the primitively eusocial bumblebee, Bombus terrestris
   (Apidae). Physiologically and behaviorally active compounds were
   identified by coupled gas chromatography electroantennography (GC-EAD),
   gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and laboratory behavioral
   tests. In the behavioral assays, virgin queens frozen previously at -20
   degrees C were highly attractive to males. Dummies impregnated with
   surface and cephalic extracts obtained from virgin queens that had been
   frozen at -50 degrees C were more attractive to males than odorless
   dummies. Male mating behavior was stimulated by components of cephalic
   secretions that are smeared onto the cuticle surface by the queen.
   Overall, 21 compounds present in surface and cephalic extracts evoked
   electroantennographic responses in male antennae. These included
   saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, ethyl- and methyl esters of the
   fatty acids, heptacosene, 2-nonanone, and geranyl geraniol. A blend of
   synthetic versions of these compounds elicited typical male mating
   behavior. Since solvent-impregnated dummies were approached by the
   males, but did not release copulatory behavior, visual cues may be
   important in the initial step of stimulating male mating behavior.
   Close-range olfactory signals are more important for releasing male
   mating behavior as well as for species recognition. In further
   behavioral assays, the attractiveness of a frozen virgin queen decreased
   as the storage time at -20 degrees C increased from 2 hr to 1 d.
   Therefore, the chemical composition of the sex pheromone may change
   during freezing as behaviorally active compounds may decompose.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between flowering plants and their pollinators are usually
   affected by the amount of reward, mainly pollen or nectar, offered to
   pollinators by flowers, with these amounts usually positively correlated
   with floral display. The large Oncocyclus iris flowers, despite being
   the largest flowers in the East Mediterranean flora, are nectarless and
   have hidden pollen. No pollinators visit the flowers during daytime, and
   these flowers are pollinated only by night-sheltering solitary male
   bees. These iris flowers are partially or fully dark-colored, suggesting
   that they gather heat by absorbing solar radiation. Here we test the
   hypothesis that the dark-colored flowers of the Oncocyclus irises offer
   heat reward to their male solitary bee pollinators. Floral temperature
   was higher by 2.5 degrees C than ambient air after sunrise. Solitary
   male bees emerged earlier after sheltering in Oncocyclus flowers than
   from other experimental shelter types. Pollination tunnels facing east
   towards the rising sun hosted more male bees than other aspects. We
   suggest that floral heat reward can explain the evolution of dark floral
   colors in Oncocyclus irises, mediated by the pollinators' behavior.}},

   orchid}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{147}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{60-68}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{One explanation for the widespread absence of floral nectar in many
   orchids is that it causes pollinators to visit fewer flowers on a plant,
   and thus reduces self-pollination. This, in turn, could increase fitness
   by reducing inbreeding depression in progeny and promoting pollen
   export. The few previous investigations of this hypothesis have all
   involved bee-pollinated orchids and some have given contradictory
   results. We studied the effects of adding artificial nectar (sucrose
   solution) to the spurs of a non-rewarding long-proboscid fly-pollinated
   orchid, Disa pulchra. Addition of nectar significantly increased the
   number of flowers probed by flies (2.6-fold), the time spent on a flower
   (5.4-fold), the number of pollinia removed per inflorescence (4.8-fold)
   and the proportion of removed pollen involved in self-pollination
   (3.5-fold). The level of self-pollination increased dramatically with
   the number of flowers probed by flies. Experimental self-pollination
   resulted in fruits with only half as many viable seeds as those arising
   from cross-pollination. Pollinators were more likely to fly long
   distances (> 40 cm) when departing from non-rewarding inflorescences
   than when departing from rewarding ones. These findings provide support
   for the idea that floral deception serves to reduce pollinator-mediated
   self-pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Under many circumstances pollinators are expected to practice positive
   frequency-dependent foraging in colour-polymorphic plant populations.
   Theory suggests, however, that competition for floral resources might
   favor negative frequency-dependent foraging by some pollinator species,
   possibly contributing to the maintenance of flower colour variation by
   negative frequency-dependent selection. We addressed this idea with
   pollination studies of the California annual plant Clarkia xantiana ssp.
   xantiana (Onagraceae), which is polymorphic for the presence of
   conspicuous petal spots and is pollinated by several specialist bee
   species. At the level of entire pollinator assemblages, we did not
   detect significant fixed flower colour preferences or
   frequency-dependent foraging. Three species of specialist bee
   pollinators, however, showed contrasting forms of frequency-dependent
   foraging. The most widespread species, Hesperapis regularis (Melittidae)
   exhibited positive frequency dependence. Two other common species,
   Lasiglossum pullilabre (Halictidae) and Ceratina sequoiae (Apidae),
   preferred to visit whichever morph (unspotted or spotted) was locally in
   the minority. All three species were found to be effective at
   transferring C. xantiana pollen; H. regularis appeared most effective.
   Our findings suggest that a mixture of positive and negative
   frequency-dependent selection on flower colour occurs in C. xantiana,
   with the form and intensity of selection varying in space and time with
   pollinator assemblages. Negative frequency-dependent selection via
   pollination dynamics may play a larger role in maintaining genetic
   variation in flower colour than was previously thought. Our results also
   suggest an unappreciated form of niche partitioning among specialist
   pollinators. Genetic polymorphism in flower colour may sometimes
   facilitate pollinator coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{We present a population genetic model that incorporates aspects of
   pollinator efficiency and abundance to examine the effect of the local
   plant community on the evolution of floral trait specialization. Our
   model predicts that plant species evolve to be pollinator specialists on
   the most effective and common pollinators when their abundance is low
   relative to other plant species in the community (i.e., conspecific
   pollen is relatively rare) and evolve to be pollinator generalists when
   they are numerically dominant (i.e., conspecific pollen is abundant).
   Strong flower constancy also favors generalist floral traits.
   Furthermore, generalist species are predicted to differentiate when
   there is a concave trade-off in attracting pollinator species with
   different floral trait preferences. This result implies that populations
   that evolve toward a generalist strategy may be more prone to
   speciation. Ours is the first theoretical model to include local species
   abundance explicitly, despite the fact that it has been previously
   identified as an important factor in the evolution of plant
   specialization. Our results add a layer of ecological complexity to
   previous models of floral evolution and therefore have the potential to
   improve our power to predict circumstances under which specialized and
   generalized plant-pollinator interactions should evolve.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{97}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-63}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{center dot Background and Aims Fertilization is essential in almond
   production, and pollination can be limiting in production areas. This
   study investigated stigma receptivity under defined developmental stages
   to clarify the relationship between stigma morphology, pollen
   germination, tube growth and fruit set.
   center dot Methods Light and scanning electron microscopy were employed
   to examine stigma development at seven stages of flower development
   ranging from buds that were swollen to flowers in which petals were
   abscising. Flowers at different stages were hand pollinated and pollen
   germination and tube growth assessed. Artificial pollinations in the
   field were conducted to determine the effect of flower age on fruit set.
   center dot Key Results Later stages of flower development exhibited
   greater stigma receptivity, i.e. higher percentages of pollen
   germination and more extensive tube growth occurred in older (those
   opened to the flat petal stage or exhibiting petal fall) than younger
   flowers. Enhanced stigma receptivity was associated with elongation of
   stigmatic papillae and increased amounts of stigmatic exudate that
   inundated papillae at later developmental stages. Field pollinations
   indicated that the stigma was still receptive and nut set was maintained
   in older flowers.
   center dot Conclusions Stigma receptivity in almond does not become
   optimal until flowers are past the fully open stage. The stigma is still
   receptive and fruit set is maintained in flowers even at the stage when
   petals are abscising. Strategies to enhance pollination and crop yield,
   including the timing and placement of honey bees, should consider the
   effectiveness of developmentally advanced flowers.}},

Title = {{Pollination biology in a tropical high-altitude grassland in Brazil:
   Interactions at the community level}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Surveys of local assemblages of plants and their pollinators are among
   the most useful ways to evaluate specialization in pollination and to
   discuss the patterns of plant-pollinator interactions among ecosystems.
   The high-altitude grasslands from southeastern Brazil constitute
   diminutive island-like formations surrounded by montane rainforests. We
   registered the floral traits of 124 species from the Serra da Bricaina
   grasslands (about 60\% of the animal-pollinated species of this flora),
   and determined the pollinators of 106 of them. Asteraceae (40 species)
   and Melastomataceae (10 species) were prominent, while most families
   were represented by few species. The predominant floral traits were:
   dish or short-tubular shape; nectar as a reward; and greenish or
   violaceous colors. Pollinators were divided into eight functional groups
   (small bees, syrphids, other dipterans, etc.) and small bees, wasps, and
   large bees were the most important pollinators. Butterflies, beetles,
   and hummingbirds were poorly represented, and no bats, hawkmoths, or
   odor-collecting bees were detected. Plants were grouped in nine
   pollination systems, among which nectar-flowers pollinated by bees
   (28\%), by wasps or wasps and flies (21\%), or by several insect groups
   (19\%) were the most representative. With regard to the degree of
   specialization, plant species were classified according to their number
   of pollinator groups. About 33\% of the species were monophilous and
   30\% were oligophilous (i.e., pollinated by one or two functional
   groups, respectively). The remaining species were either polyphilous
   (17\%) or holophilous (19\%), a highly generalist system in which at
   least three groups act as indistinct pollinators. The general trends of
   the floral traits and plant-pollinator interactions at the Bricaina
   grasslands resemble those of biogeographic-connected ecosystems, such as
   the Venezuelan arbustal, and the Brazilian campo rupestre and cerrado.
   However, in the Bocaina grasslands, the mean number of pollinator types
   per plant was 2.09, one of the highest values obtained for worldwide
   floras. The origin of the higfi-altitude grasslands is linked to
   episodes of expansion and retraction due to glacial events. Such a
   situation may have favored species able to quickly occupy new habitats,
   including those that do not depend on a few highly specialized
   pollinators. The prevalence of Asteraceae may also be linked to more
   generalized pollination systems. Alternatively, some floral traits, such
   as spontaneous self-pollination and long-lived flowers, may be
   advantageous for species with more specialized systems in these
   grasslands with harsh climatic conditions and low rates of pollinator
   visitation.}},

Abstract = {{Breeding-system studies have been conducted with 38 of the approximately
   800 species of Bignoniaceae, and self-incompatibility was found in 31 of
   these. In species for which the site of self-incompatibility barrier was
   studied, self-pollinated flowers consistently failed to develop into
   fruits, even though pollen tubes grew down to the ovary and penetrated
   most of the ovules. In this study, we have investigated the. oral
   biology and the breeding system in Jacaranda racemosa Chamisso, with
   hand-pollination experiments and the histology of post-pollination
   events. Flower anthesis lasted 1-3 days, and although the frequency of
   flower visitation was extremely low, natural pollination seemed to be
   effected mainly by medium-sized bees. Because the conspicuous
   staminodium favours eventual pollination by small bees, a possible role
   of the staminodium in the increase of potential pollinators is
   suggested. Hand-pollinations indicated that J. racemosa is a
   self-sterile species. Histological analysis of post-pollination events
   indicated the occurrence of a kind of late-acting self-incompatibility
   in which the processes of ovule penetration, fertilisation and endosperm
   initiation were slower in selfed than in crossed pistils. Until the time
   of self-pollinated pistil abscission, no signs of endosperm malfunction
   or proembryo development were observed in selfed pistils. Therefore,
   inbreeding depression is an unlikely explanation for self-sterility in
   J. racemosa.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, the Australian terrestrial orchid Diuris maculata
   sensu lato, from a site near Melbourne in Victoria, was suggested to be
   a. oral mimic of several sympatric legume species. The widespread
   distribution of this orchid species ( or species complex) suggests that
   there may be a number of different model and pollinator species
   throughout this range, and that additional studies are necessary to
   characterise its pollination adequately. In this study, the pollination
   of D. maculata in the Sydney region, mainly at Scheyville National Park,
   was compared with the results previously obtained in Victoria. At
   Scheyville National Park, Trichocolletes venustus was the only native
   bee species found in significant numbers, and the flowers it visited
   were almost exclusively the legumes Hardenbergia violacea and Daviesia
   ulicifolia ssp. ulicifolia. Fifty per cent ( 14 of 28) of captured male
   bees carried D. maculata orchid pollinaria, or remnants, which were
   identified by AFLP fingerprinting. Female bees, which appeared about
   10-14 days after males, were not observed visiting the orchid or
   carrying orchid pollinaria. We confirmed that D. maculata flowers lack
   nectar, and noted that the pea-like flowers possess an UV false nectar
   guide comparable to the true UV nectar guide of the legume flowers.
   Colorimetric analysis showed the colour separation between D. ulicifolia
   ssp. ulicifolia and the orchid is small enough to be likely to produce
   foraging errors, consistent with mimicry. We conclude that guild mimicry
   of a diversity of `egg and bacon' legumes best explains the pollination
   of D. maculata s.l., rather than precise mimicry of any one pea species.
   Preliminary observations suggest that pea-flower mimicry may range from
   being highly precise in some species, through to being much more
   generalised, but still retaining elements of mimicry. The novel finding
   of comparable UV patterns in Diuris species and putative pea models
   applies to most species in the genus and we found that the rare D.
   aequalis shows remarkable similarity in colour, shape and UV patterns to
   the sympatric legume Gompholobium huegelii, and is likely to be a mimic
   of this species.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamics of pollen release in relation to anther-wall structure among
   species of Solanum (sects Brevantherum, Cyphomandropsis and Pachyphylla)
   were studied. Differences in anther-wall qualities (multi-layered and
   rigid v. single-layered and flexible) were correlated with shifts
   between vibratory and pneumatic mechanisms. The species presented
   different exploitation mechanisms for bees to obtain their pollen. The
   number of replications (strokes on the bellows and buzzing actions)
   needed to empty the anthers and the total amount of pollen per flower
   were significantly different among the species. However, the differences
   were not correlated with differences in structural anther features. The
   pollination syndrome was related only to the total amount of pollen per
   flower, which was larger in the pollen flowers. We propose that the
   pneumatic mechanisms may have played a role simultaneously with the
   vibratory mechanism as an unclogging device or as a means of increasing
   male fitness by the pattern of pollen distribution. The pre-existence of
   the pneumatic principle in pollen flowers must have opened the
   possibility of pollen deposition on visitors without vibratory
   capabilities such as a male bee. Parallel to this change a shift in the

   revealed that this colony had produced at least 304 new queens and 939

   that B. terrestris is able to reproduce successfully in parts of

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that tripping of peanut flowers by large bees
   enhances pollination and improves peanut yields of some early commercial
   peanut varieties but this phenomenon has not been evaluated for recently
   developed peanut varieties. Our study aimed to establish whether bees
   provide this service for peanut varieties currently grown on the
   Atherton Tableland, north Queensland. To measure the impact of native
   and introduced bees occurring without assistance in crops, we set up 3
   cage treatments (meshed to exclude large bees; partly meshed to allow
   bee access but take cage effects into account; and unmeshed) in each of
   7 peanut crops. We also trapped bees in each crop for the entire
   flowering period. In a separate experiment, designed to ensure that
   suitable large bees were abundant nearby, we set up 6 replicates of the
   same 3 cage treatments in another peanut crop where 4 honeybee colonies
   were located. On a sunny day, during peak flowering, we monitored the
   number of honeybee visits to the peanut flowers in this crop between
   0820 and 1730 hours. At harvest, we found that there was no effect of
   treatment on peanut yield (number of peanuts/g plant biomass). Thus,
   bees were not contributing to peanut pollination. This was reflected in
   the fact that no honeybees (or native bees) were observed visiting
   peanut flowers in the crop augmented with honeybees, and even though we
   caught 6 species of suitably sized bees in the other peanut crops, no
   bee species was common. It seems likely that selection for other
   desirable peanut traits has resulted in development of varieties that
   are no longer attractive to flower-tripping bees and that there is no
   advantage to be gained by north Queensland growers promoting bees in
   crops of these varieties.}},

Abstract = {{A crepuscular or nocturnal lifestyle has evolved in bees several times
   independently, probably to explore rewarding pollen sources without
   competition and to minimize predation and nest parasites. Despite these
   obvious advantages, only few bee species are nocturnal. Here we show
   that the sensitivity of the bee apposition eye is a major factor
   limiting the ability to forage in dim light. We present data on eye
   size, foraging times, and light levels for Megalopta genalis
   (Augochlorini, Halictidae) in Panama, and Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra)
   sp. (Halictini, Halictidae) in Utah, USA. M. genalis females forage
   exclusively during twilight, but as a result of dim light levels in the
   rain forest, they are adapted to extremely low intensities. The likely
   factor limiting their foraging activity is finding their nest entrance
   on return from a foraging trip. The lowest light intensity at which they
   can do this, both in the morning and the evening, is 0.0001 cd m(-2).
   Therefore, they leave the nest at dimmer light levels in the morning
   than in the evening. Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) foraging is limited
   by light intensity in the evening, but probably by temperature in the
   morning in the temperate climate of Utah. We propose that the evolution
   of nocturnality in bees was favored by the large variance in the size of
   females.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial and agonistic behaviour in male sand wasps (Stizus
   continuus) was investigated in order to determine the influence of body
   size on territory maintenance and the strategies used to reduce the
   costs associated with territoriality. Size is the decisive factor in the
   capacity of males to defend a territory against other competitors: (I)
   in the disputes observed, the largest male was usually the winner; (2)
   territorial males were larger than those never seen occupying
   territories; (3) the size of males occupying territories that were left
   vacant when their inhabitants were removed experimentally was smaller.
   To optimize their territorial behaviour, males only defend sites in the
   nesting area and only when virgin females are emerging (from 0700 to
   1300), and reduce the time spent perching (as opposed to patrolling) as
   temperature increases during the morning. To reduce costs associated
   with contests, males fight only with rivals of similar size and show a
   greater tendency to fight with larger males when virgin females are most
   likely to emerge (from 0800 to 1000). This suggests that males may be
   able to estimate the size of rivals immediately before an attack
   (face-to-face hovering), and leave when the opponent is significantly
   larger.}},

Abstract = {{The regional distribution pattern of Bombus muscorum was studied in an
   agricultural landscape of central Germany, one of two remaining areas
   with the occurrence of this nationally endangered species in the Land
   Hesse. To determine the landscape characteristics that facilitate the
   occurrence of B. muscorum, grid-based observation records were analysed
   in a GIS environment at a regional scale. A significantly negative
   effect of the number of trees on the occurrence of B. muscorum and a
   significantly positive one of the proportion of arable land, strongly
   support the species' preference for open landscapes. Yet, apart from
   open landscapes additional landscape features were shown to be
   important. A significantly positive effect of ditches in the final model
   revealed the importance of this landscape element for the occurrence of
   B. muscorum. This finding was additionally supported by recordings of
   nest-searching queens, nests, and flower visits along dithes. The
   positive effects of clover and fallow land indicate the species' need
   for suitable food resources throughout the season. Because B. muscorum
   exhibits small foraging ranges, it is essential that landscape elements
   that provide nesting sites, foraging habitats and undisturbed
   hibernation structures are next to each other. The low numbers of
   individuals of B. muscorum recorded indicate that the supply of these
   habitat elements may have reached a critical threshold in the study
   region.}},

   (flower/bud), fruit to flower (fruit/flower), and fruit to flower bud
   (fruit/bud) were examined for the two bumble-bee-pollinated ericaceous
   species that have different flowering seasons: Pieris japonica (Thunb.)
   D. Don produces flower buds in autumn and blooms in early spring,
   whereas Lyonia ovalifolia (Wall.) Drude produces flower buds and blooms
   in late spring. Floral longevity was longer in P. japonica than in L.
   ovalifolia, and bagged flowers had an even longer floral longevity. The
   fruit/flower ratio was similar between the cross-pollinated and control
   flowers in P. japonica, but was smaller in control flowers than in
   cross-pollinated flowers in L. ovalifolia. Despite unpredictable
   pollinator activity in early spring, long flowering duration and no
   competition for pollinators facilitated reproductive success of P.
   japonica. In contrast, short flowering duration and severe competition
   for pollinators limited the reproductive success of L. ovalifolia.
   Flower bud herbivory was more severe in P. japonica than in L.
   ovalifolia. In both species, predispersal seed herbivores were
   negligible. Consequently, the fruit/bud ratio was mainly affected by the
   flower/bud ratio in P. japonica and by the fruit/flower ratio in L.
   ovalifolia. Our results suggest that despite intense herbivory of flower
   buds, early spring flowering of P. japonica facilitates pollination
   because of less competition for pollinators in comparison to L.
   ovalifolia. Thus, the relative importance of pollinators and herbivores
   on fruit set differs between the two studied species that differ in
   flowering periods.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among sites and years in the local ecological outcome of
   interspecific interactions can generate a geographic mosaic of
   coevolution, as indicated by recent mathematical models. We evaluated
   whether local temporal dynamics of ecological outcome in the interaction
   between the moth Greya politella (Prodoxidae) and its host plant
   Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae) are likely to mitigate or
   magnify geographic differences in ecological outcome found in earlier
   studies. The moths are highly host-specific pollinating floral
   parasites, and the mutualism can be swamped in some populations by the
   presence of effective co-pollinators. Hence, differing community
   contexts can shift the outcome of the interaction from mutualism to
   commensalism or antagonism. During each of four years, we evaluated the
   effect of Greya oviposition on seed development through a paired design
   that controlled for plant genotype and microenvironment. At Turnbull
   National Wildlife Refuge in Washington State, the interaction was
   significantly mutualistic in all four years. Mutualism in this
   population was indicated by a higher probability of development of
   capsules visited by ovipositing Greya than capsules not visited by Greya
   on the same plant. At Rapid River, Idaho, the interaction was
   commensalistic in three years and antagonistic in one year. Antagonism
   in this population was indicated by selective withering of capsules
   containing Greya eggs. Overall, the results suggest stable geographic
   differences in the range of ecological outcomes in this plant-insect
   interaction under different community contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Because pollinator behaviour within plants affects the mating outcomes
   of animal-pollinated plants, plants may regulate the pollinator
   behaviour by controlling floral design and display to maximize
   pollination efficiency. We assessed how extent of the display size,
   inflorescence architecture, and nectar distribution within
   inflorescences alter bumblebee behaviour (number of flowers visited,
   time of stay, and nectar intake efficiency) under controlled conditions
   using artificial inflorescences. The effect of display size on bumblebee
   attraction was also measured. Eighteen types of artificial
   inflorescences, two display sizes (large and small) x three
   architectures (particle, umbel, and raceme) x three nectar distributions
   (constant nectar content in every flower, gradual changes in nectar
   content, and random distribution of empty and rewarded flowers) were
   visited by bumblebees. The mean nectar amount per flower was set as 3 mu
   L in 2003 and 1 mu L in 2004. Although the inflorescence architecture
   had little effect on bumblebee behaviour, the random nectar distribution
   decreased the number of successive flower visits (both 3 mu L and 1 mu
   L) and staying time (only 3 mu L) during a single visit and increased
   the foraging efficiency (both 3 mu L and 1 mu L). These features may
   contribute to decreases in the geitonogamous pollination and pollen loss
   during pollinator movements. Display size did not influence the
   attraction of bumblebees in this study. Our results suggest that nectar
   distribution within inflorescences can be a strategy for efficient
   pollination by manipulating pollinator behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Free-flying bumblebees (Boinbus terrestris Linnaeus 1758) were trained
   to visit homogeneously coloured plastic stimuli in a controlled

   this absolute conditioning function and a previously determined function

   absolute conditioning function best explains the discrimination and
   flower constancy behaviour of bees that has previously been observed in
   natural settings. Modeling of the empirically determined absolute
   discrimination function allows for predictions of how bees would
   discriminate between flowers in complex foraging conditions that might
   include changes in the background and/or illumination colour. The
   absolute conditioning function should thus serve as an important guide
   for the evaluation of pollinator discriminations between flowers in
   natural settings, and for the understanding of why there may have been
   considerable evolutionary pressure on plants to evolve distinctive
   flower colours so as to promote flower constancy in important
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The outcrossing of transgenic oilseed rape in the neighbourhood is of
   major concern with regard to the actual EU labelling threshold of 0.9\%
   for transgenic contamination in food and feed and the regulations for
   the co-existence of cultivation of genetically modified crops,
   conventional and organic farming. In a two-year field trial, the
   outcrossing frequencies and distribution from plots with different
   ratios of transgenic plants (100\%, 1.0\% and 0.1\%) containing the
   pat-gene for resistance towards the broad-range herbicide
   glufosinate-ammonium were determined in surrounding acceptor plots
   within a distance of 3-11 m. Randomly distributed outcrossing with
   isolated pollination events became apparent, and an average gene flow of
   0.28\%, 0.01\% and 0.0065\% was detected for 100\%, 1.0\% and 0.1\%
   transgenic donor plots, respectively. Significant effects on the
   distribution of outcrossing were found for distance, but not for the
   prevailing wind direction. The random distribution in combination with
   the behaviour of honey-bees and bumble-bees gives strong evidence that
   insects play an important role for short distance gene dispersal. A
   curve fit assuming an exponential decline was performed with the
   experimental out crossing data as a function of distance and was applied
   to the actual EU labelling threshold. The contamination limit of 0.9\%
   in food and feed could be kept without cultivation distances to the
   transgenic source. The impact of effective detection limits of
   analytical methods on the establishment of specific rules for the
   co-existence is discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar production and flower visitors of the night-flowering Saponaria
   officinalis L. (Caryophyllaceae) were studied in relation to the
   reproductive success. Nectar production was worthwhile for nocturnal
   flower visitors. Nectar standing crop was about 267 mu g sugar per
   flower, and comparison of nectar offering of covered and freely exposed
   flowers revealed that main nectar secretion time is mainly during the
   night up to the morning hours. In both covered and freely exposed
   flowers nectar volumes decreased over the day. In covered flowers,
   nectar volume, sugar concentration, and sugar amount per flower
   increased up to the third day; in older flowers sugar secretion ceased.
   In 1996 Autographa gamma (Noctuidae) was the exclusive nocturnal flower
   visitor, but pollen transfer experiments proved that A. gamma
   (Noctuidae) is a very ineffective pollinator of S. officinalis. In 1999
   up to 50\% of the observed visitors were Sphingidae, which resulted in a
   significantly higher seed set. Fruit set was constantly high independent
   of pollinator availability. In the nectar manipulation experiments seed
   set was highest in non-emasculated flowers filled with unnaturally high
   concentrated sucrose solutions. Differences to seed set on stalks
   treated with a sucrose solution mimicking naturally concentrated nectar
   were significant. Lowest fruit and seed set were found on inflorescences

Abstract = {{Pollination of Cyclamen persicum (Primulaceae) was studied in two wild
   populations in Israel. Buzz-pollination proved to be extremely rare, and
   performed by a large Anthophora bee only. The most frequent pollinators
   were various unspecialized species of thrips (Thysanoptera) and
   hoverflies (Syrphidae). In the Winter-flowering populations the
   commonest visitor was a small primitive moth, Micropteris elegans
   (Micropterigidae, Lepidoptera). These moths feed on pollen, copulate and
   oviposit within the flowers. From the rarity of buzz-pollination it is
   concluded that the genus Cyclamen co-evolved with large bees capable of
   buzz-pollination, but lost its original pollinators for unknown
   historical reasons. The vacant niche was then open to various
   unspecialized pollen consumers such as thrips, hoverflies and small
   solitary bees. While these insects are not specific to C. persicum and
   seem to play a minor role only, the moth strictly relies upon Cyclamen
   and seems to be the most efficient pollinator. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{The main goal of the present study was to test if two sympatric species
   of Heliconia, Heliconia spathocircinata and Heliconia laneana var.
   flava, differ in their reproductive seasons and guilds of flower
   visitors. Twenty-four sampling sessions were conducted monthly between
   February 2001 and January 2003. Individuals of H. spathocircinata and of
   H. laneana var. flava were tagged within a transect of 4000 x 4 in.
   Reproductive phenophases (flowering, unripe, and ripe fruits) were
   recorded, and circular statistics were used to test for the regularity
   and frequency of phenophases. Flower visitors were observed during two
   flowering periods for each species. Both species had well-defined and
   synchronous reproductive periods, with a small overlap, suggesting a
   sequential flowering model. Biotic and abiotic factors seem to affect
   phenophases of both species. However, herbarium data suggest that the
   flowering period in H. spathocircinata varies less than in H. laneana,
   despite its wider geographic distribution. The hummingbird Phaethornis
   idaliae was the main floral visitor of both Heliconia species studied.
   H. laneana was also legitimately visited by another hummingbird species,
   Glaucis hirsuta, and by Lepidoptera. Some Lepidoptera, particularly the
   bee Trigona spinipes, were illegitimate visitors ('nectar robbers'). We
   suggest that the flower of H. spathocircinata allowed a wider array of
   visitors, because it is bigger. (c) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

   commonly produces yellow-flowered and purple-flowered individuals in
   frequencies that range from balanced (per population) to very
   unbalanced, with parts of the species' range entirely monochromatic. We
   studied male and female reproductive success of the two morphs in 22
   populations in the Czech Republic, relating it to morph frequency,
   population size and density, and presence and abundance of yellow and
   purple co-flowering nectar-providing species visited by the same bee
   species. Cumulative abundances of yellow nectar-producing co-flowering
   species (of which, on average, Primula veris made tip 56\%) had a
   negative effect on male reproductive success of the yellow morph, and
   spectral analyses showed that to bumblebees the colours of P. veris and
   yellow D. sambucina are different, permitting ready visual
   discrimination. The cumulative abundance of purple co-flowering species
   had no significant effect on morph reproductive success. Morph
   frequencies were unrelated to reproductive success and population size,
   and there was no evidence of frequency-dependent selection except in one
   highly unbalanced population. Density of flowering conspecifics was
   negatively correlated with male reproductive success of the purple
   morph. Seed mass, viability, and germination success depended on whether
   seeds resulted from outcrossed or selfed matings and on morph colour.
   Selfed seeds and seeds produced by the yellow morph from yellow X yellow
   and yellow X purple crosses had zero germination (after three months),
   providing the first hint that differential vegetative fitness, rather
   than differential reproductive fitness via pollinator selection, may
   explain morph frequencies in D. samucina.}},

Abstract = {{Comprising nearly 20\% of all bumble bees, the subgenus Pyrobombus is
   distributed across diverse habitats in the Northern Hemisphere and
   exhibits considerable morphological and behavioural variation relative
   to other subgenera. Its size and variation have led to questions
   concerning its monophyly and intrasubgeneric relationships, but too few
   known morphological synapomorphies and insufficient taxon sampling have
   precluded robust answers to these questions. To obtain a robust
   phylogeny of the group, we obtained DNA sequences for 36 of the 43
   species from four genes (mitochondrial 16S rRNA and three nuclear genes:
   elongation factor -1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), long wavelength rhodopsin (LW
   Rh or opsin) and arginine kinase (ArgK)). Both Bayesian and parsimony
   phylogenies are well resolved and indicate a monophyletic Pyrobombus
   when assessed against representatives of 20 additional subgenera. The
   more conserved nuclear genes, especially EF-1 alpha and ArgK, provided
   good support across all of the taxonomic levels examined, whereas
   support of the more rapidly evolving mt16S was restricted mostly to
   close relationships at the tips of the tree. The exon regions of ArgK
   were the most conserved and may be promising for higher-level
   phylogenetics. We discuss species relationships within Pyrobombus and
   its sister-group, Bombus s. s. + Alpinobombus, in relation to previous

Pages = {{119-128}},
Abstract = {{Bracts are nonfloral showy structures associated with inflorescences.
   They are generally thought to enhance plant reproductive success by
   attracting pollinating insects. We investigated whether flag-like bracts
   at the top of inflorescences are reliable signals of floral food reward
   for pollinators in Salvia viridis L. Field and greenhouse data indicate
   incomplete synchrony between the development of flowers and bracts.
   Various measures of bract size, however, positively correlate with the
   number of open flowers on the inflorescence, and with their nectar
   rewards. Experimental removal of bracts from inflorescences
   significantly reduced honeybee visitation in the field. We compare these
   findings with field data on Lavandula stoechas L., another labiate
   species with flag-like displays. The number of open flowers in L.
   stoechas cannot be reliably predicted from the presence or size of the
   bracts. Bract clipping does not significantly reduce honeybee visits in
   this species. We suggest that bees learn to orient to bracts if they
   reliably signal food rewards and to disregard bracts if they provide
   unreliable signals. Asynchronous development of bracts and floral
   rewards can reduce the reliability of the signals and may explain the
   rarity of flag-like displays in pollination systems. We discuss
   additional selective forces that may favor bract displays.}},

Abstract = {{Ornamental plants cultivated in urban regions may help to sustain local
   pollinator populations as well as broaden food source for honey bees.
   This 3-year study examined the abundance of flowering, nectar and pollen
   production as well as insect visitation to six ornamental Deutzia
   species and cultivars. In Poland, the blooming of the observed taxa
   lasted from early June to the end of July. The number of developed
   florets strongly depended on the weather conditions before and during
   the flowering period. All deutzias showed abundant secretion of highly
   concentrated nectar. The mean amount of sugars secreted in nectar per 10
   flowers ranged from 11.8 mg (D. scabra) to 18.7 mg (D. gracilis).
   Average pollen mass produced by the same number of florets was similar
   in all species and reached 17.8 mg. The highest estimated nectar (71.1
   g) and pollen (74.1 g) crop per plant was obtained from D. scabra cv.
   Watereri. Deutzia flowers attracted numerous insects, mainly honey bees,
   bumble bees and solitary bees. The species and cultivars investigated
   are highly valuable honey plants. Increased use of these shrubs in
   gardens and parks should be encouraged in order to enrich nectar and
   pollen pasture for honey bees and wild Apoidea. However, their use is
   limited to areas of mild climate and adequate water supply.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{22-27}},
Abstract = {{To examine factors influencing pollen collection by bumblebees (Bombus
   impatiens), we compared pollen collection in free-foraging
   resource-manipulated colonies (i.e., pollen-and nectar-deprived vs.
   pollen-deprived only). Additional manipulations included prior foraging
   experience in Experiment I and colony size in Experiment 2. In
   Experiment I, colonies were either deprived of both resources or
   deprived of only pollen and were subsequently tested while deprived of
   both resources. Colonies that had experience in managing both foraging
   tasks subsequently collected more pollen and allocated greater foraging
   effort than did colonies that had experience only in collecting pollen.
   In Experiment 2, larger colonies collected more pollen although smaller
   colonies collected more pollen relative to their colony size. Results
   show that colonies collect more pollen when deprived of both resources,
   exhibit foraging efficiency depending on previous tasks, and allocate
   foraging effort according to nutritional and energetic demands. Because
   pollen collection is partly regulated by nectar availability, one
   practical implication for growers of bumblebee-pollinated crops is that
   pollination may be improved by causing colonies to forage for nectar as
   well as pollen.}},

Abstract = {{A flower isolation experiment was conducted to determine the effect of
   self and cross pollination in habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense) in
   Yucatin, Mexico. The number of fruits increased, differing significantly
   (p < 0.01) between bagged flowers (BF=25\%), flowers that received one
   visit (V=79\%) and those with unrestricted visits (UV=86\%). Likewise
   the numbers of seeds and the fertilization index differed significantly
   between treatments (p < 0.01). In a second experiment, the efficiency of
   the stingless bee Nannotrigona perilampoides (SB) for pollinating this
   crop was evaluated. The quality of the fruit and the production in
   kg/m(2) were not different between SB and mechanical vibration (MV) but
   the latter showed significantly lower values in the polar diameter,
   weight and number of seed per fruit (p < 0.01). Both SB and MV showed
   significantly higher values compared with a test treatment where no
   pollinator was used in all the evaluated variables (p < 0.01). We
   conclude that C. chinense can be self pollinated but cross pollination
   is needed to increase the number and quality of fruits and especially
   for high seed production probably due to the increased transference of
   pollen grains. The use of N. perilampoides seems a good alternative to
   the use of mechanical vibration and non native bees for pollination of
   peppers in enclosures under tropical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1 Alien species may form plant-animal mutualistic complexes that
   contribute to their invasive potential. Using multivariate techniques,
   we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both
   alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of
   north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess
   whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the
   composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the
   influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as
   flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering
   time, site and habitat disturbance.
   2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar
   number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but
   the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed
   between alien and native plants.
   3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower
   visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant
   factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat
   disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact
   that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien
   plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on
   average, equally associated with native and alien plant species.
   4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness
   (3.6\% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20\% of
   all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could
   have a significant impact in terms of pollination.
   5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is
   well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web.
   However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants
   and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with
   their alien partners. The existence of these invader complexes could
   contribute to the spread of aliens into novel environments.}},

Abstract = {{The Southern Espinhaco Range consists of large areas covered by

   bee flora and fauna at the quartzitic Ouro Branco Mountains and a
   two-year survey of the metaliferous Ouro Preto fields. The samples were
   collected twice a month, from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm. The bees (677)
   belonged to 91 species, five families. The family Apidae was the richest
   and most abundant, followed by the Halictidae and Megachilidae. The bees
   visited 46 flowering plant species; the most visited plants were the
   Asteraceae (n = 220), the Malpighiaceae (n = 95), the Melastomataceae (n
   = 94), the Fabaceae (n = 78), and the Solanaceae (n = 63). Diversity was
   higher in Ouro Branco (H = 1.47) than in Ouro Preto (H = 1.17). The low
   richness and abundance of bees in our research site when compared to
   other Brazilian ``Cerrado{''} areas can be due to the high altitude, low
   temperature, and low availability of flowers we found. ``Canga{''} and
   rupestrian areas house fauna and flora species that are rare and
   threatened by extinction. The southern Espinhaco areas can, therefore,
   be given the status of permanent biodiversity preservation area.}},

Title = {{New evidence for the Darwinian hypothesis of heterostyly: breeding
   systems and pollinators in Narcissus sect. Apodanthi}},
Journal = {{NEW PHYTOLOGIST}},

Abstract = {{Here we analysed the role played by breeding systems and pollinators in
   the evolution of heterostyly by testing whether evolution towards
   heterostyly is associated with style polymorphism and changes in
   pollinator proficiency or breeding system variation (Darwinian
   hypothesis).
   We studied pollinators, pollen-transfer efficiency, and incompatibility
   systems in all seven species of Narcissus sect. Apodanthi for which we
   also obtained chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequences from three spacers to
   infer phylogenetic relationships.
   Five species are self-incompatible and within-morph cross-compatible.
   Heterostylous (Narcissus albimarginatus) and style-dimorphic (Narcissus
   cuatrecasasii) species that have a high degree of reciprocity in stigma
   and anther height are primarily pollinated by solitary bees. The
   style-monomorphic species (Narcissus watieri) and the style-dimorphic
   species with the least stigma-anther reciprocity (Narcissus rupicola)
   are both self-compatible and pollinated by butterflies, moths and hover
   flies.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction of character transitions indicates that the
   shift from style dimorphism to distyly is associated with a shift to bee
   pollination. Pollination by lepidopterans and flies is associated with
   stable style dimorphism and monomorphism. Evolution and maintenance of
   style polymorphisms in this group of species are independent of
   incompatibility systems. Taken together, our results strongly support
   the pollinator-based model for evolution of heterostyly and style length
   polymorphisms in general.}},

Title = {{Size constraints and flower abundance determine the number of
   interactions in a plant-flower visitor web}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-121}},

Abstract = {{The number of interactions with flower visitor species differs
   considerably among insect pollinated plants. Knowing the causes for this
   variation is central to the conservation of single species as well as
   whole plant-flower visitor communities. Species specific constraints on
   flower visitor numbers are seldom investigated at the community level.
   In this study we tested whether flower size parameters set constraints
   on the morphology of the potential nectar feeding visitors and thus
   determine the number of visitor species. We studied three possible
   constraints: the depth and width of tubular structures hiding the nectar
   (nectar holder depth and width) and the size of flower parts that
   visitors can land on (size of the alighting place). In addition we
   assess the role of flower abundance on this relationship. We
   hypothesized that the stronger size constraints and the smaller flower
   abundance, the smaller the number of visitor species will be. Our study
   of a Mediterranean plant-flower visitor community revealed that nectar
   holder depth, nectar holder width and number of flowers explained 71\%
   of the variation in the number of visitor species. The size of the
   alighting place did not restrict the body length of the visitors and was
   not related to visitor species number. In a second step of the analyses
   we calculated for each plant species the potential number of visitors by
   determining for each insect species of the local visitor pool whether it
   passed the morphological limits set by the plant. These potential
   numbers were highly correlated with the observed numbers (r(2)=0.5, p <
   0.001). For each plant species we tested whether the observed visitors
   were a random selection out of these potential visitors by comparing the
   mean of the observed and expected proboscis length distributions. For
   most plant species the observed mean was not significantly different
   from the random means. Our findings shed light on the way plant-flower
   visitor networks are structured. Knowing the constraints on interaction
   patterns will be an important prerequisite to formulate realistic null
   models and understand patterns of resource partitioning as well as
   coevolutionary processes.}},

Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{120-142}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Floral morphology, distribution, and flower visitors for 60 taxa of Nasa
   are investigated and compared to molecular trees inferred both from a
   combined marker analysis (ITS1 and trnL(UAA)) and from a single marker
   (ITS1). Flowers conform to two different floral types: Firstly,
   ``tilt-revolver flowers{''}, with spreading to reflexed, white to yellow
   petals and small, brightly coloured floral scales contrasting with the
   petals and firmly enclosing the nectar (Saccatae and Carunculatae);
   secondly, ``funnel-revolver flowers{''}, with half-erect to erect,
   orange to red petals and floral scales not contrasting with the petals,
   or enclosed in the corolla, and nectar freely accessible by
   funnel-shaped floral scales (Alatae, Grandiflorae, and N. venezuelensis
   species group). Phylogenetic analysis shows that ``tilt-revolver
   flowers{''} represent the plesiomorphic condition by outgroup
   comparison. The two groups with tilt-revolver flowers in Nasa are not
   monophyletic (Saccatae are paraphyletic, Carunculatae are polyphyletic).
   Most Saccatae fall into two monophyletic assemblages, the N. poissoniana
   species group and the N. triphylla species group. The remainder of
   Saccatae group either with Grandiflorae (N. insignis species group) or
   with Alatae (N. taxa species group). The clades retrieved in the
   molecular analysis contradict the traditional classification, but are
   congruent with vegetative morphology, details of the flower morphology,
   and biogeography. ``Funnel-revolver flowers{''} represent the derived
   condition, but molecular data suggest a convergent development (at least
   twice independently), since the corresponding species do not constitute
   a monophyletic group. ``Tilt-revolver flowers{''} are visited and
   pollinated by bees (especially Colletidae), whereas ``funnel-revolver
   flowers{''} are mostly visited by hummingbirds. The transition from
   melittophily to ornithophily may have been the license for the
   colonization of, and the diversification in, both cloud forest and high
   Andean habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is exclusively or mainly animal mediated for 70\% to 90\% of
   angiosperm species. Thus, pollinators provide an essential ecosystem
   service to humankind. However, the impact of human-induced biodiversity
   loss on the functioning of plant - pollinator interactions has not been
   tested experimentally. To understand how plant communities respond to
   diversity changes in their pollinating fauna, we manipulated the
   functional diversity of both plants and pollinators under natural
   conditions. Increasing the functional diversity of both plants and
   pollinators led to the recruitment of more diverse plant communities.
   After two years the plant communities pollinated by the most
   functionally diverse pollinator assemblage contained about 50\% more
   plant species than did plant communities pollinated by less-diverse
   pollinator assemblages. Moreover, the positive effect of functional
   diversity was explained by a complementarity between functional groups
   of pollinators and plants. Thus, the functional diversity of pollination
   networks may be critical to ecosystem sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{The high altitude flat area of Bogota is located at 2600 m elevation and

   degrees C). Based on archives, field notes, bibliographic review and a
   database from the Bee Research Laboratory of the National University in
   Bogota (LABUN), information was obtained on the wild bees present in
   tile city of Bogota and nearby localities. In addition, surveys were
   made in different sites in the city and its surroundings, observations
   were taken directly in the field, and information was compiled on plants
   visited by bees in the study area. Forty bee species were found
   belonging to 18 genera and distributed among the five families recorded
   for the country. Halictidae and Apidae were the most speciose families.
   Among all bee species found, 82,5\% are Neotropical in distribution and
   25\% typically Andean in distribution. Data is presented on the foraging
   behavior, nest architecture and external activity for some species of
   wild urban bees. Thygater aethiops and Caenohalictus sp. nest mainly in
   parks and near patches of ornamental plants, whereas Anthophora walteri
   nests in dry areas with little vegetation. Bees of the genus Bombus were
   found nesting outside of strictly urban boundaries. The most visited
   plants were mainly ornamental species belonging to the families
   Acanthaceae, Asteraceae, Caprifoliaceae, Solanaceae,and
