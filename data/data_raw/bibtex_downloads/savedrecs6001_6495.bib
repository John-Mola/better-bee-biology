Abstract = {{What rules determine whether bumble bees continue exploiting plants of
   the species just visited or switch to another species? To tackle this
   question, we recorded handling times and flight times from bees foraging
   in a natural meadow containing five plant species. Inter- and
   intra-specific plant distances were quantified. The bee-subjective
   colors of the five species were determined; two of these species had
   similar colors and structures, while three species were distinct from
   all others. The following rules were identified: (1) The decision to
   switch species was correlated with previous flower handling time, which
   we assume is a function of the reward amount received at the flower.
   After short handling times, the probability of switching to another
   species increased, whereas it decreased after long handling times. This
   difference became even greater if the bee bad had a run of several short
   or several long handling times. (2) Constant flights (those between
   flowers of the same species) and transition flights (those between
   flowers of different species) followed stereotyped temporal patterns
   independent of the distances between flowers. Constant flights within
   five plant species consistently had median durations of about 2 seconds,
   whereas median transition times between species took 3-6 seconds. (3)
   This temporal rule broke down, however, if the flowers of two case
   transition flights had equal dynamics as constant flights. (4) Bees
   switched more frequently from rare than from common species but even
   more frequently between similar species. We conclude that the bees'
   choices were determined by a set of rules that guided them to stay with
   the current plant species as long as flowers were rewarding and
   available within close distance but to switch to another species if
   flowers offered low rewards encountered at close range.}},

Abstract = {{Sources of variation in floral nectar production were investigated in a
   natural population of Epilobium canum (Onagraceae), a
   hummingbird-pollinated herbaceous shrub. Field measurements showed
   significant phenotypic variation among plants in floral nectar
   production rates. Average variance among flowers within plants was
   approximately one-third to one-half as great as variance among plants,
   with coefficients of variation among flowers ranging from 6.5\% to
   116.7\%. A greenhouse experiment using clonally propagated ramets from
   field plants showed significant genetic variation for nectar production
   rates; broad sense heritability was estimated to have a maximum value of
   0.64. In the greenhouse, plants grown under low water or low light
   conditions produced approximately 25\% less nectar on average than those
   grown under control conditions. However, significant
   genotype-environment interactions indicated that genets differed in

   genet mean nectar production rates across environmental conditions were
   low, and in two out of three comparisons were not different from zero.

Abstract = {{The relative importance of floral versus ecological isolation in

   floral isolation between Silene dioica and S. latifolia

   species boundary using allozymes, and by assessing interspecific
   transfer of flourescent dye powders to simulate pollination. Allozyme
   studies of wild populations demonstrated that gene flow between S.
   dioica and S. latifolia is considerable since the two species could not
   be distinguished at the loci studied, in sharp contrast to their
   distinct morphologies. Pollination studies using fluorescent dye powders
   and direct observation of insect behaviour concurred in that although
   there was a degree of assortative mating it was insufficient in itself
   to prevent introgression. Fluorescent dye studies also suggest that
   pollination rates of hybrids are similar to parental types and that they
   provide a bridge for gene flow since they are visited freely by the main
   pollinators of both S. dioica (bumblebees) and S. latifolia (moths). We
   conclude that although floral isolation and spatial segregation may be

   raised spots that occur on some of the ray florets. Removal of the spots
   resulted in a significant decrease in the rate of fly visits to

   Bicolletes pampeana are effective pollinators of Cajophora

   the scales of the nectaries outwards with their head while taking up
   nectar. If this stimulus is responded to, up to 3 stamens move and reach

   architecture precludes self-pollen to reach the receptive stigmatic
   surface. The visitor arrives to the flower and introduces its proboscis

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The foraging movements of bees are said to be influenced by the spatial
   distribution of the plants whose flowers they visit, However, Manasse
   found that bee-mediated gene flow was unrelated to the degree of
   aggregation among the plants in the linear arrays that he studied. To
   investigate this apparent contradiction further. I manipulated the
   levels of aggregation in linear plant arrays and examined both the
   effect on the movements of the bumblebee pollinators and the likely
   consequences for pollen dispersal and gene flow. I studied pollinator
   movements among plants of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) that
   were arranged in rows that each contained 50 plants. In each experiment
   one row of plants was spaced at uniform intervals and the remaining rows
   contained aggregated plant distributions. Experiments were conducted at
   two scales, short rows (10 m) and long rows (20 m). The plants were
   visited almost exclusively by worker caste individuals of Bombus
   lapidarius. Bumblebees were followed over successive visits within a row
   and the location of each visited plant and the number of flowers probed
   there was recorded. Within each row, I examined the following components
   of bumblebee behaviour: the mean number of flowers probed per plant
   visit; the mean interplant flight distance; and the mean directionality
   (proportion of moves in an individual's favoured direction). The
   collective movements of bumblebees within each row were characterised by
   the rate of change of the bees' mean squared distance from an original
   location. The spatial dispersion of pollen from a paternal plant was
   estimated in each row by combining a quantitative description of
   bumblebee movements in terms of displacement from a paternal plant with
   a model of pollen deposition. Bumblebees were observed to visit many
   plants successively within a row and movements between rows were
   infrequent. In both long and short rows, three components of bumblebee
   movement behaviour were significantly modified by the level of plant
   aggregation. With increasing plant aggregation, bumblebees exhibited a
   decrease in directionality and in the number of flowers probed per plant
   visit and they exhibited an increase in the number of plants by-passed
   during interplant flights. Despite the effects of plant aggregation on
   the components of bumblebee behaviour, the bumblebees' collective rate
   of movement away from an origin within a row was unrelated to the level
   of plant aggregation. This was consistent with the finding that plant
   aggregation did not significantly affect either the estimates of mean
   pollen dispersal distances measured in metres or a plant's expected
   number of female mates. The modifications to bumblebee behaviour that
   were caused by differential aggregation among rows apparently combined,
   fortuitously, to buffer the spatial extent of pollen dispersal.
   Consequently, my results are consistent with Manasse's finding that
   pollinator-mediated gene flow was unrelated to plant spatial
   heterogeneity at these scales. However, I also conclude that the effects
   of plant aggregation on gene flow will depend on the spatial scale of
   the inter-patch distances.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the responses of the insect pollinators of the
   summer-flowering, understorey shrub, Lavandula latifolia (Labiatae) to
   the irradiance mosaic of the forest floor in a southeastern Spanish
   locality, and assesses the relationship between these responses and
   interspecific variation in thermal biology. Pollinators differed
   significantly in the mean irradiance at capture points (MICP), and a
   large percentage of species (59\%) preferentially selected plants in
   either shaded or sunlit conditions. Taxonomic affiliation (at the order
   level) and body size explained 78\% of interspecific variance in MICP.
   Dipterans tended to be restricted to situations of relatively row
   irradiance, whereas hymenopterans foraged over the entire irradiance
   gradient. MICP was inversely related to body size. Pollinators differed
   Significantly in mean thoracic temperature (T-th), thoracic temperature
   excess (T-exc = T-th - T-a {[}air temperature]), and slope of the
   T-th/T-a regression (which may be taken as a rough index of
   thermoregulatory ability). Hymenopterans had higher T-th and T-exc, and
   smaller T-th/T-a slopes, than dipterans. After accounting for this
   taxonomic effect, T-th and T-exc, but not T-th/T-a slope, increased with
   body size. MICP depended significantly on T-exc and, to a lesser degree,
   on T-th, and species characterised by high T-exc tended to select
   low-irradiance conditions. The relationship between MICP and body size
   was thus mediated by the correlations between the latter variable and

Abstract = {{Mapping resin secretion and pollination ecology onto the estimated
   phylogeny of species of the euphorb vine Dalechampia generated two
   historical hypotheses: resin rewards offered to pollinators by
   Dalechampia flowers evolved by minor modification of a preexisting,
   resin-based, floral defense system, and resin defense of leaves in
   advanced species evolved by modification of the preexisting resin-reward
   system. From these hypotheses, we derived two predictions: floral reward
   resins are chemically similar to putative floral defense resins and
   exhibit antiherbivore activities, and foliar resins are chemically
   similar to reward resins and also exhibit antiherbivore activities. We
   tested these predictions by chemical analyses and by using a broad
   sample of Neotropical herbivorous insects in a series of bioassays. All
   floral and foliar resins were chemically similar. Tests with two
   generalist (Orophus tesselatus, Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae; Atta
   colombica, Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and four Dalechampia-specialist
   herbivores (Syphraea sp., Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae; Ectima
   rectifasciata, Hamadryas ipthime, and Hamadryas amphinome, Lepidoptera:
   Nymphalidae) showed floral and foliar resin to deter significantly
   feeding or leaf cutting. These results support our two hypotheses and
   indicate that, in this system, biochemical exaptations have played a
   major role in the evolution of plant-insect relationships, adaptations
   reducing herbivory have affected the evolution of plant-pollinator
   relationships, and adaptations for pollination have affected the
   evolution of plant-herbivore relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Teak flowers are weakly protandrous and pollen is shed within a few

   The papillate stigma is of the wet type and is receptive from

   are the major floral rewards for pollinators. The major pollinators are
   Ceratina sp. which carry teak pollen on most parts of their bodies,
   especially the specialized hair structures (scopal brushes) on the
   tibia. The most effective pollination period in terms of flowers
   pollinated and pollen per flower is between 0900 and 1300h. At 1300h the
   number of pollen per flower is the highest, ranging from 1-36 (average
   7). Pollen tubes grow very fast. Within 2 h after pollination 8\% of the
   pollen tubes have reached the micropylar end of the ovule and pollen
   tubes first enter the embryo sac at 8 h. Only one to two pollen tubes
   enter the micropyles of a flower. Although 78\% of flowers were
   pollinated in open-pollination, the low fruit set (3.5\%) suggests that
   there are factors other than pollination limiting fruit set. The main
   factor appears to be a high amount of selfing, and self-incompatibility
   occurs when pollen tubes are arrested at the lower portion of the ovary.

   means of sequence alignment and Mantel tests. We also compared observed

Abstract = {{The behaviour of bumblebee workers Foraging on arrays of artificial
   flowers of two colour morphs was observed. Experiments were conducted on
   arrays of varying morph frequencies and at three different total flower
   densities. Bumblebees consistently shelved a preference for the
   commonest colour morph, and this behaviour was not significantly
   affected by changing density. In contrast, frequency-independent
   preferences changed significantly with density. At low densities, there
   was a strong bias towards the more conspicuous colour, whereas at higher
   densities there was no overall colour bias. Flight distances between
   flowers decreased significantly at high density. Bumblebees also visited
   flowers of similar colours sequentially, but this behaviour was not
   density-dependent. It is suggested that as densities increase, there is
   an increased probability that bumblebees detect yellow flowers, which
   were probably less conspicuous compared xith blue flowers, and that this
   might be caused by changes in flight speed with flight distance. Where
   there is a positive relationship between pollinator visitation and the
   relative fitness of a floral morph, the observed behaviour would induce
   positive frequency-dependent selection on a plant population with two
   corolla colour morphs on which the bumblebees were foraging, which would
   result in stabilizing selection for a single corolla colour,
   irrespective of density. There was no indication that rare colour morphs
   would be preferred at high density. The probability of different corolla
   colour morphs going to fixation would, however, be affected by density.

   some free fatty acids, a small amount of cri-glycerides and a trace of
   carbohydrate. The composition of the glycerides is predominantly
   (53-63\%) esters of unsaturated 18C-22C fatty acids with the rest made
   up of 14C-18C saturated fatty acids. The second type of floral oil is
   similar to type one except that the samples contain large amounts of an
   unknown lipid more polar than the standards.
   Oil collected from the scopae of two representative Centris species, C.

   Mediterranean shrub with compact, head-like inflorescences that are
   terminated by a tuft of conspicuous pink bracts. Pollinator visitation
   rates to plants with bracts correlated positively with that of paired,
   treated shrubs with all their bracts removed and, overall, bractless and
   control plants had equivalent visitation rates. In experimentally split
   shrubs, however, a strong effect on pollinator choice was evident, and
   distant visitor approaches were most often to that side keeping the
   attractive organs. Fecundity was not depressed in plants with reduced
   visual displays, and neither was the amount of pollen dispersed per
   flower or the size of stigmatic loads. There were, however, more pollen
   tubes, on average, at the lowermost part of the style in controls (10.8
   tubes/style) than in bractless shrubs (8.3 tubes/style). Small,

   notion that bracts are not essential to seed production in mature,
   relatively dense Lavandula populations where bee pollinators are often

   long spurs in sandplain plants, as artificial shortening of spurs
   resulted in a significant decline in pollen receipt and fruit set,

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We used arrays of artificial flowers with and without fragrance to
   determine the importance of olfactory and visual cues in attracting
   insects to a floral mimic. The mimic is a fungus, Puccinia monoica
   Arth., which causes its crucifer hosts (here, Arabis drummondii Gray) to
   form pseudoflowers that mimic co-occurring flowers such as the
   buttercup, Ranunculus inamoenus Greene. Although pseudoflowers are
   visually similar to buttercups, their sweet fragrance is distinct. To
   determine whether visitors to pseudoflowers were responding to fragrance
   we performed an experiment in which we removed the visual cues, but
   allowed fragrance to still be perceived. In this experiment we found
   that pseudoflower fragrance can attract visitors by itself. In other
   experi ments we found that the relative importance of olfactory and
   visual cues depended on the species of visitor. Halictid bees (Dialictus
   sp.) had a somewhat greater visual than olfactory response, whereas
   flies (muscids and anthomyiids) were more dependent on olfactory cues.
   We also used bioassays to determine which of the many compounds present
   in the natural fragrance were responsible for attraction. We found that
   halictid bees were equally attracted to pseudoflowers and to a blend
   containing phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, benzaldehyde and
   methylbenzoate in the same relative concentrations as in pseudoflowers.
   Flies, on the other hand, only responded to pseudoflower scent,
   indicating that we have not yet identified the compound(s) present in
   pseudoflowers that are attracting them. The ability of insects to
   differentiate pseudoflowers from true flowers by their fragrance may be
   important in the evolution of the mimicry system. Different fragrances
   may facilitate proper transfer of both fungal spermatia and pollen, and
   thus make it possible for the visual mimicry to evolve.}},

   most abundant plants in the community. Flowering was year-round, but
   most species flowered in spring. The three species that flowered after
   spring had small flowers, but the distribution of floral features
   (including rewards offered) did not show a strong seasonality. Ants
   contributed 58.5\% to the flower visits recorded. Other frequent
   visitors were beetles (12\%), flies (9.5\%), honey bees (6.4\%), wild

   wild bees from April to July, beetles from May to July, and ants from
   May to September. The lack of tight plant-insect associations was the
   rule, with most plant species visited by a rather diverse array of
   insects representing two or more orders. The plant species having
   narrower spectra of visitors either had flower rewards exposed or

   treatments but plants grown at elevated CO2 produced approximately 25\%
   more flowers per plant and these lived 17\% longer than those grown at
   ambient CO2. A plant grown at elevated CO2 may thus produce more nectar

Abstract = {{Isozyme analysis of sweet cherry embryos from 3 different South
   Australian orchards has proven to be an invaluable diagnostic tool. It
   has shown that in comparison with almond orchards, pollen gene flow
   occurs over much greater distances. Furthermore, pollen genes are being
   donated by more than one polleniser cultivar. For example, Sam planted
   at Lenswood Horticultural Centre was pollinated by both Vista and Merton
   Glory.
   Protective netting was used to exclude birds from the cherry orchard at
   Lenswood and only 0.003\% of the apparent net pollen gene flow came from
   cultivars planted outside of the net to those within. The presence of
   bird netting discouraged the movement of honeybees.
   Cross-compatible pollen rather than self pollen contributed most to
   embryo formation in the self-fertile cultivar Stella. Seventy-one
   percent of embryos produced by Stella at Lenswood were as a result of
   outcrossing.
   This work has culminated in some important recommendations for the
   cherry industry. Namely that where bird exclosures are used bee hives
   and polleniser cultivars should be placed inside the netted area, and
   when planting self-fertile cultivars, such as Stella, polleniser
   cultivars should be included in the orchard plan.}},

Abstract = {{In dehisced anthers of all Gymnocalycium species (Cactaceae, subfam.
   Cactoideae, tribe Trichocereae) investigated so far, a small percentage
   of pollen grains are aggregated by only a few threads. These threads are
   located at the margin of the dehiscing zone of stomium and septum. They
   are not part of the pollen grain wall, and they are not resistant to
   acetolysis, thus indicating the absence of sporopollenin. The threads
   originate in part from modified stomium/septum cells (split cell walls,
   cytoplasmic remnants and lipid droplets) and in part from pollenkitt
   produced by the - now desintegrated - tapetal cells. This highly
   viscous, gum-like substance along the modified stomium and septum cell
   walls may assume an irregular thread-like habit before or during
   dehiscence. Pollen aggregates may be formed frequently by different
   sticky or non-sticky agents. A detailed conspectus on origin, nature,
   significance and function of various types of pollen-connecting agents
   forming threads is presented. Pollen-connecting threads are normally
   efficient pollination vehicles and are restricted to flowers pollinated
   by large insects or vertebrates. The genus Gymnocalycium is probably
   exclusively bee-pollinated, with most pollen connected by pollenkitt.
   The functional role of the threads in Gymnocalycium is uncertain: since
   only a few threads connect a small number of pollen grains per
   pollen-sac they hardly play a significant role in pollination ecology.
   The threads most probably represent a character restricted to the genus
   Gymnocalycium, as they have not been observed in closely related genera.}},

   Augochlorella michaelis, Augochloropsis cupreola, Pseudocentron
   paulistana, Ceratinula sp., Melissodes sexcincta, and one social bee,
   Plebeia droryana, were observed. Three departure rules were examined:
   (1) ``residence time{''} (time spent per patch); (2) ``giving-up
   time{''} (time spent in the patch between the last successful resource
   encounter and departure); (3) ``probabilistic rule{''}. Three log-linear
   models were delineated to analyze the ``probabilistic rule{''} of
   departure: (1) DP{*}TLF{*}TPF{*}TTP; (2) DP{*}TLF{*}TPF{*}ALF; (3)
   DP{*}TLF{*}TPF{*}NFV, where DP is departure from the patch; TLF is time
   spent in the last visited flower; TPF is time spent in penultimate
   visited flower;TTP is total time spent in the current patch; ALF is
   activity in the last visited flower; NVF is total number of visited
   flowers on the current patch. Flowering plants were considered as flower
   patches. The results showed that the departure from patches of flowers
   was influenced by intrinsic factors, such as body size, energetic
   requirements and pollen load size, and by extrinsic factors, such as
   resource availability and distribution, and density of resource patches.

Abstract = {{Model calculations are used to determine an optimal color coding system
   for identifying flower colors, and to see whether flower colors are well
   suited for being encoded. It is shown that the trichromatic color vision
   of bees comprises UV, blue, and green receptors whose wavelength
   positions are optimal for identifying flower colors. But did flower
   colors actually drive the evolution of bee color vision? A phylogenetic
   analysis reveals that UV, blue, and green receptors were probably
   present in the ancestors of crustaceans and insects 570 million years
   ago, and thus predate the evolution of flower color by at least 400
   million years. Ln what ways did flower colors adapt to insect color
   vision? The variability of flower color is subject to constraint.
   Flowers are clustered in the bee color space (probably because of
   biochemical constraints), and different plant families differ strongly
   in their variation of color (which points to phylogenetic constraint).
   However, flower colors occupy areas of color space that are
   significantly different from those occupied by common background
   materials, such as green foliage. Finally, models are developed to test

Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{141-156}},
Abstract = {{Two phases of foraging flights of hymenopteran pollinators are
   discussed: localization of food sources over far distances (hundreds of
   meters to several kilometers); and spotting of flowers within their
   visual catchment area. In the first part, evidence from navigational
   tasks with honeybees is presented which favors the interpretation that
   bees possess a rich and unique spatial memory of qualified and localized
   objects. Depending on the motivation, the bee is rather free to navigate
   with reference to this memory. In particular, bees are guided towards
   feeding places with specific expectations of their signal and reward
   properties. In the second part, the processes guiding the bee during its
   final approach to the flower are analyzed. When arriving in the close
   vicinity of a rewarding flower, bees first detect and recognize the
   achromatic green signal and then the chromatic color signal. The
   dependence on the optical signals of the flowers and the habitat
   features is studied in a comparison between plants growing in the
   Israeli Mediterranean and desert habitats. We find that the green
   contrasts of flowers in desert plants are less prominent than in
   Mediterranean plants because the green signal of the desert background
   is more similar to that of flowers, not because the green signals of
   desert and Mediterranean plants are different. These results are
   interpreted on the assumption that the green signal of flowers used in
   further distance detection is an adaptive property of plant species only
   in the context of all features supporting navigation bf insects. The low
   density growth of desert plants may allow for the possibility that the
   plants are located by insect pollinators as specified places relative to
   landmarks. Therefore, further distance visual signals emanating from the
   flower may be less important in a desert habitat, and reduced green
   contrast does not become an unfavorable property in desert plants. We
   conclude that both habitat features and flower signals contribute to the
   navigational system of insect pollinators, and that the evolutionary
   development of flower signals needs to be evaluated in the context of
   the plant species' habitat.}},

Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2-3}},
Pages = {{169-183}},
Abstract = {{A pervasive idea among pollination biologists is that bees cannot see
   red flowers. This idea has led many workers to assume that red
   coloration is an adaptation by which flowers exclude bees as visitors.
   However, recent empirical and theoretical evidence strongly supports the
   alternative view, that red flowers are visible to bees. Our purpose is
   to marshal this evidence from physiology, behavior, and ecology. First,
   we define the spectral boundary between orange and red, and show that
   the visual spectrum of all bee species studied to date extends enough
   into long wavelengths to provide sensitivity to red light. Such
   sensitivity differs from the ability to discriminate different
   monochromatic lights, and we argue that bees will be unable to
   discriminate such lights above about 550 nm. Second, we point out that
   flowers do not reflect monochromatic lights. Instead many of them,
   particularly those that appear red, orange, yellow, and white to humans,
   have reflectance patterns that are essentially step functions. We
   predict that bees should be able to discriminate such reflectance
   patterns over a range of 550-550 nm, since reflectance functions with
   steps at such wavelengths will occupy different loci in bee color space
   and thus be distinguishable. In this sense, bees should distinguish
   between green-, yellow-, orange-, and red-reflecting objects, even if
   these do not reflect in shorter wavelengths (including UV). A behavioral
   experiment shows that bumblebees can indeed perform this task. Third, we
   present information on the spectral reflectance of some typical `'red''
   flowers, combined with field observations of bee visitation to such
   flowers. We end with a preliminary reassessment of the adaptive
   significance of red flower coloration, using North American
   `'hummingbird'' flowers as an example; we also stress some of the
   pitfalls facing evolutionary biologists who continue to assume that bees
   are blind to red objects.}},

Abstract = {{In 42 plant species, the flowers' en face planar projected areas,

   area and contour density, which indicates that small flowers have broken

Abstract = {{Assessing the relative contributions to seed set for each of a plant
   species' floral visitors provides an indication of the relative
   influence of these visitors on the plant's reproductive success. This
   study examined pollinator activity and seed set in a population of
   Heterotheca subaxillaris, a species that exhibits a floret dimorphism
   (heads bearing disk and ray florets), and that is visited by both
   generalist foragers and specialist bees. Visits by nine bee genera and
   one genus of skipper were recorded in the study population. During the
   period of study, these insects varied in their relative abundance, in
   their foraging activity on a head, and in their pollination
   effectiveness. The pattern of pollination effectiveness shown by the
   different pollinators was similar for both floret types, although seed
   set was higher overall for ray florets. Pollinator importance,
   calculated as the product of pollination effectiveness and relative
   abundance, was dictated by a pollinator's relative abundance. The single
   specialist bee species observed in the study population proved to have
   neither higher pollination effectiveness nor higher pollinator abundance
   than other pollinators. This would suggest that N. subaxillaris is not
   under strong selective pressure to co-specialize with its specialist
   visitor.}},

   high (42000). Both male and female flowers emit an almond oil-like scent
   and produce nectar in septal nectaries. The concentration and total
   amount of sugar of the nectar of female flowers (37\% and 0.021 mg) were

Journal = {{PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{206}},
Number = {{1-4}},
Pages = {{99-118}},
Abstract = {{The flowers of Dillenia are highly elaborate pollen-flowers adapted to
   buzz-pollination by Xylocopa bees. Two major forms of floral
   architecture (revolver flowers and roundabout flowers) are associated
   with two different pollination modes. In the first (e.g., D.
   suffruticosa), the pollination organs are connivent to a cone; the
   pollinator grasps the entire cone with its legs and buzzes it; it
   revolves around its axis and repeats the buzzing in different positions.
   In the second (e.g., D. alata, D. philippinensis), the stylar branches
   are spreading and the stamens are arranged in two sets of two different
   forms and colourations. The inner set has fewer and longer stamens that
   are cryptic pollination stamens; those of the outer set are shorter but
   optically conspicuous feeding stamens. The pollinator squeezes itself
   under the stylar branches and handles only the outer set by grasping
   part of the set at a time; it moves tangentially around the flower with
   several buzzing-stops; when buzzing pollen is sprayed onto its side and
   back from the inner stamen set. Centrifugal polyandrous androecia are a
   constitutive feature of flowers in Dilleniaceae. In Dillenia the
   centrifugal initiation of stamens proceeds for an unusually long time
   and is still not finished when the gynoecium is completely closed (in
   contrast to Tetracera). The differentiation of heteranthery seems to be
   functionally correlated with the extended centrifugal inception. The
   latest formed stamens are small and sterile in many species. Generic
   features of Dillenia flowers can be understood from the roundabout
   architecture: big size, increased number of carpels, syncarpy forming a
   firm pedestal and spreading firm stylar branches with small, concave
   stigmas at the end, stamens with short, stout filaments and much
   elongated poricidal anthers, heteranthery, recurved stamens of the inner
   set.}},

   Opuntia-flowers, bees touch the filaments and stimulate the movement of
   the stamens to the centre of the flower. At the end of this movement,
   the anthers are densely packed around the style. As a consequence the
   pollen is presented in an easily accessible upper layer of anthers and
   various, nearly inaccessible lower layers. The lower layers contain
   about 80\% of the pollen reward. Only females of the three oligolectic
   pollinators exploit the pollen from the lower layers and reach the

Abstract = {{I develop two optimal-allocation models to investigate bet-hedging on
   ovule production as an evolutionary strategy in environments where
   either pollinator availability or resource availability is
   unpredictable. In both models, a plant allocates the resources available
   in the flower stage to its attractive structures, ovule production,
   and/or reserves in the fruit stage. The pollinator availability for the
   year (in the first model) or the resource availability of the fruit
   stage (in the second model) is unpredictable. I show that large
   variability in pollinator or resource availability does not always
   select for an increase in the number of ovules produced by the plant.
   Rather, the plant decreases its ovule number in habitats where
   pollinator or resource availability is more variable. In the first
   model, this occurs if the expected pollinator availability is large, the
   resource availability is small, the recovery rate of reserved resources
   is small, or the prior selfing rate is large with a large degree of
   inbreeding depression. In the second model, it occurs if the pollinator
   availability is small or the expected resource availability is large.
   Thus, the bet-hedging hypothesis within the context of variation in
   ovule/flower number does not always work for ovule production in
   environments where pollinator or resource availability is unpredictable.

Abstract = {{Some plant pathogens attract pollinating insects and thus have the
   potential to influence the pollination of flowers, just as different
   flower species can influence one another's pollination. Showy,
   flower-like pseudoflowers caused by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on
   Arabis holboellii (Brassicaceae) commonly co-occur with flowers of
   Anemone patens (Ranunculaceae). I evaluated the effects of pseudoflowers
   and anemone on each other's visitation, and the effect of pseudoflowers
   on the seed set of anemone. I expected that at low overall `'flower''
   densities visitation would be facilitated in patches containing a
   mixture of these species. At low densities, pseudoflowers or flowers
   alone may be too rare to attract sufficient visitors, but the addition
   of the other species could make mixtures more attractive and thus
   increase visitation rates. At high densities I expected that `'flowers''
   in mixtures would compete for pollinators because it is more energy
   efficient for pollinators to concentrate visits on the most rewarding
   species. I used artificial arrays to separate the effects of `'flower''
   density and relative frequency on visitation. Local density was not a
   good predictor of the influence of one species on the other. Instead,
   visitation patterns depended most strongly on the kind of visitor (flies
   vs. bees). Visitation to A. patens by flies was facilitated by the
   presence of pseudoflowers at both high and low densities, whereas
   visitation to pseudoflowers was not significantly influenced by A.
   patens at either density. Local density affected visitation by bees, but
   relative frequency did not. In addition to observing visitation, I also
   quantified the effects of interspecific movement of both pollen and
   spores on the reproductive success of A. patens. Although the presence
   of pseudoflowers sometimes facilitates visitation to A. patens, this
   effect could be counterbalanced by competition through interspecific
   insect movement: sticky pseudoflowers remove pollen from visiting
   insects, and fungal spermatia deposited on flower stigmas reduce seed
   set.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of floral colour patterns in angiosperms is known to be an
   adaptation aimed at the pollinators' capacity for learning and
   discriminating colours. The species-specific labelling of colour signals
   improves pollen transfer between the flowers of a species caused by the
   flower constant foraging behaviour of pollinators. The initial flower
   detection of inexperienced flower visitors, however, requires
   non-species-specific, standardized cues among potential food plants
   fitting to the innate preferences of flower visitors. It was shown that
   the colour patterns of many melittophilous angiosperm blossoms closely
   match the colour signals releasing innate responses of bumble bees and
   hoverflies which exhibit very different kinds of innate colour
   preferences. In this comparative study, physiological, morphological,
   phylogenetical and functional aspects of the construction of visual
   signalling units in melittophilous plants are investigated. The various
   levels of the representation of colour patterns are described, such as
   the spectral reflection of flower colours, the relative quantum
   absorption of the photoreceptors of a flower visitor, and the
   representation of floral colour patterns in the colour triangle as well
   as in a perceptual colour space. With respect to the flower parts which
   display the optical releasers of innate colour preferences there is a
   great morphological diversity. The signalling function of the androeceum
   as the primary food signal highlights the evolution of innate colour
   preferences in flower visitors. The androeceum, floral guides or central
   colours of blossoms offer standardized optical releasers corresponding
   to innate colour preferences of pollen-feeding insects. Plant species
   with polymorphic flowers are used as a study case in order to
   demonstrate the standardization of colour signals at the species level.
   In summary, floral colour patterns serve multiple functions: They offer
   species-specific as well as standardized signals and they may address
   themselves at the same time to flower visitors with fundamentally
   different visual systems and innate colour preferences.}},

   devoted to attracting insect visitors in response to fewer pollinating
   visits in the plain. Consistent with this explanation, by experimentally

Abstract = {{Honeybee-assisted gene flow by pollen is of enormous benefit to world
   food production. Molecular genetic markers were used to detect the
   pollen-contributing parent in embryos of seeds after fruit set and,
   subsequently, to deduce the direction and distance of gene flow by
   pollen as assisted by bees in an almond orchard. It was shown that gene
   flow by pollen resulting in nut set takes place most strongly between
   neighbouring sides of adjacent cross-compatible pairs of trees.
   Examination of pellets extracted from pollen traps fitted to hives for
   the isozyme markers showed that most of the pellets were composed of
   pollen from only one cultivar or another, in accord with the hypothesis
   that the honeybee predominantly visits only one cultivar, either single
   trees or along rows of one cultivar, and that cross-pollination results
   from accidental or rare visits involving two cultivars. The results
   suggest that orchards should be designed to bring cross-compatible pairs

Abstract = {{Many studies have shown sympatric plants with similar floral structures
   to have flowering periods separated in time, and this is usually
   interpreted as a selective response to competition for pollination. In
   highly seasonal habitats, however, the time available for flowering may
   be highly constrained, and many species often flower together. Under
   such conditions, one alternative to temporal partitioning on a seasonal
   scale is for species to flower simultaneously, but with pollen release
   (dehiscence) structured on a diurnal timescale. Here we provide evidence
   for such diurnal partitioning of both floral resources and pollinator
   visitation in an African Acacia community. Temporal separation is
   enhanced by differences in the rewards offered by Acacia species to
   their pollinators:species producing nectar as well as pollen receive
   flower visits from insect groups absent from acacias offering only
   pollen. In contrast to competition for pollination, this situation may
   promote mutualistic maintenance of shared pollinators by the Acacia
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the possibility of sexual selection in plants has focused

   from other donors (interference competition). We considered whether this
   second form of competition might occur among pollen grains of wild
   radish in two experiments. In the first, interference likely occurred
   because the amount of pollen germination was less in mixed-donor than in
   single-donor pollinations. This result was duplicated in a second
   experiment, which also showed that interference occurred only when
   pollen grains from different donors were in direct contact with each
   other. In addition, in the second experiment, the opportunity for
   interference affected the frequency of seeds sired by different pollen
   donors. Because pollen loads are often mixed in nature, interference

Abstract = {{Pollination systems involving solitary bees and flowers are of
   particular interest because it is possible to correlate bee foraging
   behavior directly with reproductive output of both the plant (through
   seed set) and the bee (through the pollen and nectar in a provision
   mass). A simple pollination model is presented here as a useful tool for
   understanding the reproductive output of alfalfa and its solitary bee
   pollinator, Megachile rotundata (Fabr.) (Megachilidae). In particular,
   the question is raised whether there is a tradeoff between seed yields
   and bee yields as the number of introduced female bees increases. This
   question has implications for the management of the alfalfa seed crop.
   Such a tradeoff requires a maximum bee yield at some optimum number of
   introduced females, and an increase in seed yields when introduced
   females increase above the bee yield optimum. Both of these requirements
   were met if male nectar visits account for a substantial amount of
   pollination, and if search time is sufficiently slow when open flowers
   are scarce. Male nectar visits can interfere with reproductive potential
   of the bee species, creating a bee yield optimum. Slow search times
   cause seed yields to increase when the number of introduced females is

   had newly emerged from hibernation. Flowering of the C. cava population
   lasted 39 days, with a peak on the 14th day. During the first 14 days of
   the flowering period, bumblebees collected pollen (i.e., pollinated),
   perforated the flower spur and robbed the nectar (i.e., primary
   nectar-robbery). Over the first nine of these days, they perforated the

   Workers of specialist and generalist bumblebees removed similar amounts
   of pollen per visit. Queens of the specialist species removed less than
   worker bees. Flower visit duration was the same for queens as for
   workers of the specialist. However, both workers and queens of the
   specialist made shorter visits and thus removed more pollen per unit
   time than did the two most frequent generalists. Thus the specialist
   showed a higher efficiency (net energy gain per unit time) as a
   harvester than the generalists. The proportion of the total pollen
   production removed by the specialist was similar to that found in other
   mutualism studies. The proportion of the variation in amount of pollen
   left in a flower after a visit that could be explained by the combined
   effects of total pollen production per fewer and Bower visit duration
   was less for B. consobrinus than for the two most frequent generalists

   Workers of B. consobrinus were the only abundant depositors of pollen in

Abstract = {{Phenology and insect visitation of early flowers of Bartsia alpina, a
   perennial herb, in a subalpine population in northern Sweden, were
   investigated to find causes for low seed set in early flowers.
   Bumblebees are the only visitors of B. alpina; they collect pollen and
   nectar. Flower phenologies of several bumblebee visited species and
   their nectar standing crops were measured. Flowering of Bartsia started
   simultaneously with Astragalus frigidus while Pedicularis lapponica was
   nearly out of flower. Early blooming flowers of Bartsia received fewer
   visits than later blooming ones. The large volumes of nectar with a high
   sugar concentration in early flowers indicate that bumblebees neglect or
   fail to discover early blooming flowers of Bartsia. Early in the season
   seven bumblebees species visited Bartsia but later on Bombus pascuorum
   was dominant. This species was also an important visitor of Astragalus.
   A rather low percentage of the pollen loads contained only Bartsia
   pollen, 27-28\%, during early and peak flowering of Bartsia. Corbicular
   loads of B. pascuorum, the most frequent visitor of Bartsia, often
   contained Bartsia but also contained Astragahus pollen and to a lesser
   extent Ericaceae pollen (probably of Andromeda polifolia). The large
   variation in composition of corbicular loads indicated that bumblebees
   were not faithful to Bartsia only and that several plant species were
   visited by the same individuals. Bumblebee visitation of Bartsia and
   Pedicularis during a single trip may result in heterospecific pollen
   deposition which may lower seed set in Bartsia. Bumblebee visitation of
   Bartsia and Astragalus during a single trip may not result in
   heterospecific pollen deposition on Bartsia flowers due to the
   deposition of Bartsia pollen on the dorsal and Astragalus pollen on the
   ventral side of the body of bumblebees. Low seed set of early blooming
   flowers of B. alpina was probably due to low visitation rates by
   bumblebees. In addition, seed set of early flowers may be low due to
   heterospecific pollen depositions but this also may occur later in the
   season if the composition of corbicular loads is considered. After
   artificial heterospecific pollinations seed set decreased as compared
   with pure pollinations.}},

   biases towards blue flowers, probably because blue flowers appeared more
   conspicuous to bumblebees than yellow flowers, and the degree of
   preference for blue was greater when flowers had low nectar rewards.
   Flower-to-flower movements by individual bumblebees between flowers were
   non-random, were biased to movements within the same flower colour, and

   was conducted in Senegal to evaluate spunbonded row cover as an
   integrated production tool with special reference to pest management and
   pollination. We used an andromonoecious cultivar and compared an open
   treatment with four cover treatments. In the first two treatments, the
   covers were removed at the onset of fruiting to allow open pollination.
   The fabric was laid directly on the plants in one treatment and arranged
   in small tunnels in the other. In the other two treatments, small
   tunnels of fabric were maintained over the plants for 20 d after the
   onset of fruiting. In one, an end of the tunnel was cut open to allow
   open pollination while in the last treatment, the tunnel was kept closed
   and pollination was provided by a colony of African honey bees in a
   multiple-entrance hive. All plants were sprayed with fungicides as
   needed, but only the plants in the open or those with the cover removed
   were treated with insecticides. Honey bees foraged in all plots and
   pollination was not a limiting factor in any of the treatments. Chemical
   applications alone provided poor protection and yielded an average of
   0.18 kg of export-grade fruit per plant. Removal of the covers at the
   onset of fruiting resulted in severe insect damage and plant losses
   regardless of the layout of the cover and the final yield of
   export-grade fruit was 0.40 kg per plant. Tunnels with the opening at
   one end allowed adequate open pollination while maintaining a

   visited by a variety of bees, wasps, and butterflies, and by two species
   of hummingbirds. In the field, I measured the following components of
   effectiveness: frequency of visits, evenness of visits across plants,
   and diurnal pattern of visits. I also used flight-cage experiments to
   compare pollen-transfer abilities of euglossine bees and heliconiid
   butterflies. Euglossine bees visited more frequently, visited earlier in
   the day, and visited a higher proportion of plants in the population
   than did other taxa. In flight cage experiments, bees and butterflies
   transferred similar amounts of pollen overall, but bees transferred
   significantly more inter-morph (compatible) pollen. For each component
   measured, euglossine bees appeared to be the most effective pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proposed that in non-rewarding animal-pollinated plants the
   pollination intensity should decrease with increasing population size
   and should increase with increasing local abundance of reward-producing
   plants. To test these hypotheses, we examined how population size, local
   abundance of Salix caprea, and tree cover were related to pollen removal
   and fruit production in 16 populations of the deceptive, early-flowering
   and bumblebee-pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa in northern Sweden in 3
   consecutive years. To determine whether fruit production was limited by
   pollinator visitation, supplemental hand-pollinations were performed in
   three populations in 3 years. Finally, to examine whether increased
   fruit production was associated with a reduction in future flower
   production, vegetative growth or survival, supplemental hand-pollination
   was repeated for 5 years in one population. The levels of pollen export,
   pollen deposition, and fruit set of C. bulbosa varied considerably among
   years and among populations. The proportion of plants exporting pollen
   was negatively related to population size, and positively related to
   density of S. caprea and to tree cover in 1 of the 3 years. In the other
   2 years, no significant relationship was detected between proportion of
   plants exporting pollen and the latter three variables. In no year was
   there a significant relationship between fruit set and population size,
   density of S. caprea and tree cover. There was substantial among-year
   variation in the extent to which fruit production was limited by
   insufficient pollen deposition and in the amount of weather-induced
   damage to flowers and developing fruits. Fruit set was consistently
   higher in hand-pollinated than in open-pollinated plants, but this
   difference was statistically significant in only one of 3 years.
   Supplemental hand-pollination in 5 consecutive years increased
   cumulative fruit production 1.8 times, but did not affect flower
   production, plant size, or survival. Tree cover was negatively
   correlated with the incidence of frost damage in 1 year. The results
   indicate that life-time seed production may be pollen limited in C.
   bulbosa, and that variation in population size and local abundance of
   the early-flowering, nectar-producing S. caprea can only partly explain
   the extensive variation in pollinator visitation among populations of
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{Among plants visited by many pollinator species, the relative
   contribution of each pollinator to plant reproduction is determined by
   variation in both pollinator and plant traits. Here we evaluate how
   pollinator movement among plants, apparent pollen carryover, ovule
   number, resource limitation of seed set, and pollen output affect
   variation in contribution of individual pollinator species to seed set
   in Lithophragma parviflorum (Saxifragaceae), a species visited by a
   broad spectrum of visitors, including beeflies, bees, and a moth
   species. A previous study demonstrated differences among visitor species
   in their single-visit pollination efficacy but did not evaluate how
   differences in visitation patterns and pollen carryover affect
   pollinator efficacy. Incorporation of differential visitation patterns
   and pollen carryover effects - commonly cited as potentially important
   in evaluating pollinator guilds - had minor effects (0-0.6\% change) on
   the estimates of relative contribution based on visit frequency and
   single-visit efficacy alone. Beeflies visited significantly more flowers
   per inflorescence than the bees and the moth. Seed set remained
   virtually constant during the first three visited flowers for beeflies
   and larger bees, indicating that apparent pollen carryover did not
   reduce per-visit efficacy of these taxa. In contrast, Greya moth visits
   showed a decrease in seed set by 55.4\% and the smaller bees by 45.4\%
   from first to second flower. The larger carryover effects in smaller
   bees and Greya were diminished in importance by their small overall
   contribution to seed set. Three variable plant traits may affect seed
   set: ovule number, resource limitation on seed maturation, and pollen
   output. Ovule number per flower declined strongly with later position
   within inflorescences. Numbers were much higher in first-year
   greenhouse-grown plants than in field populations, and differences
   increased during 3 years of study. Mean pollen count by position varied
   7-fold among flowers; it paralleled ovule number variation, resulting in
   a relatively stable pollen:ovule ratio. Resource limitation of seed set
   increased strongly with later flowering, with seed set in
   hand-pollinated flowers ranging from 66\% in early flowers to 0\% in the
   last two flowers of all plants. Variation in ovule number and resource
   limitation of seed maturation jointly had a strong effect on the number
   of seeds per flower. Visitation to early flowers had the potential to
   cause more seed set than visitation to later flowers. Overall, the most
   important sources of variation to seed production contribution were
   differences among pollinators in abundance and absolute efficacy (ovules
   fertilized on a single visit) and potentially differential phenology
   among visitor species. These effects are likely to vary among
   populations and years.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the pollination biology of three species of night-blooming
   columnar cacti (cardon, Pachycereus pringlei; saguaro, Carnegia
   gigantea; and organ pipe, Stenocereus thurberi) near Bahia Kino, Sonora,
   Mexico, by addressing two questions: (1) What is the relative importance
   of nocturnal (bats, moths) and diurnal (bees, birds) pollinators for
   fruit and seed set, and (2) To what extent do these cacti compete for
   pollinators? Honeybees had the highest visitation rates to flowers of
   the three species but are relatively ineffective pollinators. Bats had
   higher visitation rates to flowers of cardon than birds, which had
   higher visitation rates to flowers of saguaro and organ pipe than bats.
   Results of pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that visits by
   bats accounted for most of the fruit set in cardon, visits by birds and
   bees accounted for most of the fruit set in saguaro, and birds accounted
   for most of the fruit set in organ pipe. Hand-pollination experiments
   suggest that fruit set in females but not hermaphrodites of cardon, a
   trioecious species, and organ pipe is pollen-limited, probably owing to
   the scarcity of bats. Crude estimates of the per-visit effectiveness of
   different groups of pollinators for fruit set indicate that bats are
   somewhat more effective than birds and much more effective than bees.
   Competition for pollinators between the three species of cacti is
   reduced by seasonal or daily phenological differences. The flowering
   seasons of cardon and saguaro broadly overlap, but these species differ
   in the times their flowers open and close (earlier at night and the next
   morning, respectively, in cardon) and in their nectar secretion
   schedules. Saguaro flowers are more available to diurnal pollinators
   than those of cardon. The flowering peak of organ pipe occurs much later
   in the spring than the other two species; its opening and closing and
   nectar secretion schedules are similar to those of cardon. At our study
   site, the importance of bats as pollinators of columnar cacti is
   currently much lower than in other arid zone columnar cacti.}},

   fraction of effective pollen moved at least a few hundred meters and
   well beyond the nearest reproductive neighbors. Conversely, where

Abstract = {{This study shows the efficiency of depositing an odoriferous marking to

   L., Bombus lucorum L., Megabombus (Th.) pascuorum Scop., Pyrobombus (P.)
   pratorum L. and Bombus terrestris L. The stimulation was varied
   qualitatively, which made it possible to study the ability of workers to
   distinguish the odour of the substance deposited by individuals of their
   own colony from that deposited by individuals of another colony,
   isospecific or heterospecific. For each species studied, the returning

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Sonication is a seemingly effective method for foraging insects to
   extract pollen rapidly from poricidal anthers. However, without a
   dispensing mechanism to limit the pollen extraction a single forager
   might be able to glean all of the pollen from a flower in a single
   visit.
   2. The vibratory release mechanism of a buzz-pollinated flower species,
   Solanum laciniatum, and its relationship with time was investigated.
   3. The sonication vibration magnitude required to eject pollen from the
   anthers increased with frequency; vibrations at frequencies below 180 Hz
   were particularly effective owing to the low (124 Hz) natural frequency
   of the stamens and the good transmission of low-frequency vibration by
   the anthers. The natural frequency of stamens was low compared with the
   sonication frequencies of bumble-bees and did not change significantly
   when sonicated,
   4. Large amounts of pollen (72 000 grains) were released in initial
   sonications, but this was a small percentage (18\%) of the total
   available pollen; pollen release continued in metered quantities over
   time,
   5. The stamen vibration mode created centrifugal forces, which forced
   pollen out of the apical pores, and the gradual dehydration of the
   tapetal fluid remaining in lower regions of dehiscent poricidal anthers
   produced a timed release mechanism,
   6. The frequency increase from the flight wing-beat frequency to the
   sonication buzz enables bumble-bees to generate high accelerations,
   which are able to release pollen from the anthers, using thoracic
   vibrations, which are limited by the maximum possible displacement of
   the indirect flight muscles.}},

Abstract = {{Model calculations are used to find an optimal color vision system for
   the coding of natural objects. The criteria to assess the quality of
   color vision are (a) discriminability between all colors of a given set;
   (b) discriminability between nearest neighbors (only the most similar
   colors of a set); and (c) detectability (color difference between target
   and background). The colored objects investigated are several sets of
   flower colors, one set of green foliage colors, and one set of fruit
   colors. A large variety of hypothetical color vision systems was
   generated by varying both the wavelength positions of photoreceptors and
   the weights of color opponent processes used to evaluate the receptor
   inputs. It is shown that the set of spectral receptor types in flower
   visiting bees (lambda max = 340, 430 and 540 nm) is close to optimal for
   the discrimination of several sets of sympatric and simultaneously
   blooming flower colors, as well as for discrimination of green foliage,
   but not for fruit coloration. For two sets of objects, the illuminant
   was varied, which changed the results only marginally. Detectability of
   flowers against background is likewise optimal. The optimal wavelength
   positions of photoreceptors are largely independent of the particular
   color opponent mechanisms used to evaluate the photoreceptor signals.
   Optimal color opponent systems are all those which comprise two opponent
   processes with weighting factors differing strongly from one another.
   The evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed against
   the background of a recent phylogenetic study which showed that
   wavelength tuning of insect photoreceptors likely predated the evolution

Abstract = {{Odors of pollen and whole flowers were compared in taxonomically
   unrelated species that offer pollen as the only food reward to
   pollinators. Volatiles were collected using headspace adsorption and
   analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The odor of pollen
   was found to be chemically distinct from the total flower odor, and this
   pollen-odor distinctness varied among the three species. In Papaver
   rhoeas (Papaveraceae), the contrast between pollen and whole-flower
   odors was most subtle, with differences observed only in the proportions
   of individual volatiles (almost exclusively aliphatic hydrocarbons). In
   Filipendula vulgaris (Rosaceae), pollen volatiles were fewer than in the
   flowers (comprising mainly benzenoids and fatty-acid derivatives) and
   their relative proportions produced an odor dominated by 2-heptadecanone
   that contrasted strikingly with the flower odor dominated by 2-phenyl
   ethanol. In Lupinus polyphyllus (Fabaceae), the pollen odor contained
   fewer volatiles and in differing proportions than the flower fragrance
   (comprising almost exclusively isoprenoids). The findings add to earlier
   chemical evidence of odor contrasts between pollen and other flower
   parts in two other species. Drawing on information from pollination
   studies of these various species, it is suggested that pollen odor is
   used by pollen-foraging insects both to discriminate between plant

   that it might in addition serve a protective function against
   destructive flower-feeding insects and pathogens.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1451-1462}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although mutualisms are often viewed as fragile constructs, subject to
   invasion by `'cheaters'' that gain from the mutualism without providing
   compensating benefits, few studies have explored whether or not apparent
   cheating behavior by one player actually denies benefits to the other
   species. Panicled bluebells (Mertensia paniculata) experience high rates
   of nectar robbery by bumble bees (Bombus mixtus and B. frigidus) in the
   Wrangell Mountains of southcentral Alaska. Nevertheless, experimental
   prevention of nectar larceny in two seasons did not enhance components
   of female reproductive success (nutlet initiation, seed-set, and seed
   mass) or male success (pollen removal). Observational data show that the
   absence of a negative impact of nectar robbery is a consequence of
   bumble bee behaviors; the two bee species that rob mature flowers
   buzz-pollinate the same flowers at an earlier stage in floral
   development. The shift in bee behavior is driven by the presentation of
   different rewards at different times in the flowering period; young
   flowers contain pollen and older flowers produce nectar. Although
   flowers typically receive and donate pollen before most nectar is
   produced, the mature flowers producing a robbed nectar reward may
   nonetheless contribute to the reproductive success of bluebell plants.
   Flowers sequestered from pollinators in the early stage were still
   capable of initiating nutlets, demonstrating that older flowers can
   enhance female reproduction if pollinators are rare (when many
   early-stage flowers may go unvisited). Moreover, the removal of mature
   flowers reduced the visitation rate to early-stage flowers on the same
   plant. Because individual bumble bees switch frequently between nectar
   robbing and pollen collection, the nectar reward in mature flowers may
   act as a key enticement to pollinators, which then enhance plant
   reproduction by legitimately visiting early-stage flowers. Rather than
   representing a case of cheating behavior, nectar robbery may be an
   integral part of this plant-pollinator mutualism.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of hummingbird-mediated selection for flower width in
   Ipomopsis aggregata}},

Abstract = {{The form of angiosperm flowers is thought to have evolved in part via
   selection that excludes ineffective pollinators and increases the
   efficiency of pollen transfer by effective ones. In previous studies
   with the montane plant Ipomopsis aggregata, we documented
   pollinator-mediated selection on several aspects of floral form,
   including flower width. This character varies continuously within
   natural populations of I. aggregata, and individuals with wider flowers
   export more pollen per flower to surrounding plants. We previously
   showed that this component of phenotypic selection is due primarily to
   the per-visit effectiveness of hummingbirds, the most important
   pollinator in our study populations. Here we investigate mechanisms of
   differential visit effectiveness in greater detail. First, counts of
   pollen in unvisited flowers showed that pollen production itself
   increases with width. In aviary experiments, hummingbirds also removed a
   greater proportion of available pollen as width increased. We next
   videotaped visits to flowers that varied in width either naturally, or
   by experimental treatment, and found that hummingbirds inserted their
   bills more deeply into wider flowers. Finally, we directly manipulated
   how deeply birds could insert their bills, and found that more pollen
   was removed after deep insertion. Thus, several mechanisms appear to
   underlie selection on corolla width via visit effectiveness in pollen
   export. One involves a phenotypic correlation with pollen production;
   this underscores the value of experiments for untangling indirect from
   direct selection. Another mechanism involves direct selection due to the
   depth of insertion of a hummingbird's bill; this is rare evidence for
   one form of selection involving the `'fit'' between pollinator and
   flower.}},

Abstract = {{To account for differences in occurrence of social behavior in different
   lineages of bees, Michener (1985) hypothesized that ground nests are
   move easily located by parasites than are twig nests, In the former case
   parasites search in two dimensions, while in the fatter they search in
   three-dimensional space, One prediction derived from this hypothesis is
   that ground nests will have higher rates of parasitism than twig nests.
   A survey of published reports on rates of cell parasitism for 92 species
   of nesting bees and wasps (Apoidea) shows no significant differences in
   mean parasitism razes between these two classes of nests. The analyses
   were repeated at the generic level (N = 44), yielding the same pattern.
   These data may be biased due to phylogenetic effects. Paired comparisons
   (n = 11 pairs) of related taxa that differ in nest site show that
   ground-nesting taxa more often have higher rates of parasitism than
   twig-nesters. The use of artificial `'trap-nests'' to study twig-nesters
   significantly enhances the success rare of parasites. This bias, as well
   as several other limitations, suggests that experimental studies of the
   host-searching capabilities of parasites and predators may be more
   efficacious than such comparative tests.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of temperature on nectar secretion in Thymus
   capitatus, a typical labiate of phrygana (i.e. the garrigue of the East
   Mediterranean Basin). Experiments were carried out at controlled
   temperatures in a climatic chamber. We measured the nectar standing crop
   of the flowers at the end of the first day of their anthesis. All nectar
   values (i.e. volume per flower, sugar content and concentration)
   increased with temperature up to 38 degrees C, as long as the plants
   were not water stressed. However, in the open and under normal temperate
   conditions (i.e. at relatively low temperatures) nectar secretion
   depended more on changes in solar irradiance than on temperature.
   Under the same conditions, nectar secretion in Ballota acetabulosa, a
   species that is sympatric and coflowering with T. capitatus, was
   affected neither by light nor temperature. Since in the wild these two
   species are found in different microhabitats (full sun and shade, for T.
   capitatus and B. acetabulosa, respectively), we attribute the
   differences we observed to the differential natural adaptation of the
   plants to these factors. We conclude that T. capitatus is very well
   adapted to the Mediterranean conditions. By performing optimally as a
   nectar source at high temperatures, it can support a very large insect
   fauna that visits its flowers for nectar. It is in fact a
   temperature-induced cornucopian species.}},

Abstract = {{Distinctions in floral ontogeny among three segregate genera (Cassia
   sensu stricto, Chamaecrista, and Senna) of Cassia L. support their
   separation. In all species studied, the order of floral organ initiation
   is: sepals, petals, antesepalous stamens plus carpel, and lastly
   antepetalous stamens. Sepal initiation is helical in all three genera,
   which however differ in whether the first sepal is initiated in median
   abaxial position (Senna), or abaxial and off-median (Cassia javanica), a
   rare character state among legumes. Order of petal initiation varies:
   helical in Senna vs. unidirectional in Cassia and Chamaecrista. Both
   stamen whorls are uniformly unidirectional. Intergeneric ontogenetic
   differences occur in phyllotaxy, inflorescence architecture, bracteole
   formation, overlap of initiation among organ whorls (calyx/corolla in
   Cassia; two stamen whorls in Chamaecrista), eccentric initiation on one
   side of a flower, anther attachment, anther pore structure, and
   precocious carpel initiation in Senna. The asymmetric corolla and
   androecium in Chamaecrista arise by precocious organ initiation on one
   side (left or right). The poricidal anther character can result from
   differing developmental pathways: lateral slits vs. sealing of lateral
   sutures; clasping hairs vs. sutural ridges; terminal pores (one or two)
   vs. none; and clamp layer formation internally that prevents lateral
   dehiscence. Genera differ in corolla aestivation patterns and in stigma
   type. Convergence is shown among the three genera, based on intergeneric
   dissimilarities in early floral ontogeny (floral position in the
   inflorescence, bracteole presence, position of the first sepal
   initiated, order of petal initiation, asymmetric initiation, overlap
   between whorls, anther morphology, and rime of carpel initiation)
   resulting in similarities at anthesis (showy, mostly yellow salverform
   flowers, heteromorphic stamens, poricidal anther dehiscence, bee
   pollination, and chambered stigma).}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive phenology of the entire climber community (96 species
   of lianas and 40 species of vines) in a semideciduous forest in
   Southeastern Brazil (22 degrees 49'45''S; 47 degrees 06'33''W and 670 m
   altitude) was observed from March 1988 to February 1991. Phenological
   observations were made weekly by walking along a 10.5 km trail in the
   interior and at the forest edges of the Santa Genebra Reserve (SGR). The
   most species-rich families of climbers were Bignoniaceae (22),
   Malpighiaceae (17), Sapindaceae (12) and Asteraceae (12). Flowering
   patterns for woody lianas and herbaceous vines differed. Lianas had two
   flowering peaks: a minor peak in March in the transition from wet to dry
   season, and a major peak in October during the transition from dry to
   wet season. The flowering peak for herbaceous vines was in April.
   Fruiting of lianas was highly seasonal, with one peak in the late dry
   season (July-August). Fruiting for vines was less seasonal with a slight
   peak in March. These differences were consistent with the predominance
   of wind-dispersed fruits among lianas (72\% of species) versus vines
   (52\%). Low rainfall, high leaf fall, and strong winds during the dry
   season favor wind dispersal. More species of vines (40\%) have
   animal-dispersed seeds than lianas (19\%), and most vines fruited during
   the wet season. Phenological patterns of climbers and trees and treelets
   at SGR differed. The life form of lianas and their system of reserve
   economy may allow them to reproduce during periods unfavorable to trees.
   Displacement of peak flowering periods of trees and climbers pollinated
   by bees and small generalist insects may decrease competition for pollen
   vectors among species of these two groups of plants. Whereas the
   fruiting patterns of wind-dispersed trees and climbers at SGR were
   similar (most species fruiting during the dry season), animal-dispersed
   trees and treelets fruited throughout the year while animal-dispersed
   climbers exhibited a pronounced peak in late wet season. The distinct
   phenological patterns of climbers, generally complementary to those
   presented by trees, resulted in constant availability of Bowers and
   fruits throughout the year and enhances the importance of this plant
   group in Neotropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar guides are common among insect-pollinated plants, yet are thought
   to be rare or absent among hummingbird-pollinated plants. We hypothesize
   that the lower lips and trumpet-shaped orifices of many hummingbird
   flowers act as nectar guides to direct hummingbirds to the flowers'
   nectar and orient the birds for pollination. To test this hypothesis we
   conducted laboratory experiments using flowers of Monarda didyma (bee
   balm) and M. fistulosa (wild bergamot), which have orifice widths of
   about 4 mm and 2 mm, respectively, and latex flowers with orifice widths
   of 4 mm and 2 mm and three orifice shapes (trumpet, lipped, and
   lipless). Ruby-throated hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris) made fewer
   errors during bill insertion and spent a smaller proportion of their
   feeding visit in error at M. didyma flowers than at M. fistulosa
   flowers, and at unaltered flowers of both species than at flowers with
   lower lips removed. Handling times were longer at both lipped and
   lipless flowers of M. didyma than at those of M. fistulosa, and at
   lipped than at lipless flowers of M. didyma. The average duration of
   contact between a hummingbird and a flower's anthers and stigma was
   longer at M. didyma than at M. fistulosa for both lipped and lipless
   flowers, and at lipped than at lipless M. didyma flowers. Hummingbirds
   missed the openings of latex flowers with their bills more frequently
   and spent a greater percentage of their total feeding visit in error at
   (i) 2-mm than at 4-mm flowers of all three shapes, (ii) lipless flowers
   than at trumpet or lipped flowers, and (iii) lipped flowers than at
   trumpet flowers of both widths. The duration of hummingbird/anther

   lipped than at trumpet or lipless flowers, and (iii) lipless than at
   trumpet flowers for both widths. No significant differences in handling
   times of hummingbirds were observed among any of the latex flower shapes
   or widths. Our results demonstrate that orifice shapes can act as guides
   by reducing the frequency of feeding errors by visiting hummingbirds,

Abstract = {{The effects of weather on the flight and flower-visiting activity of
   bumblebees and butterflies were studied at a subarctic-alpine site in
   northern Swedish Lapland. The study focused on the insects' role as
   potential pollinators and the effect of bumblebee flight and foraging
   activity on plant reproductive success. The activity rates of both
   bumblebees and butterflies were significantly correlated with ambient
   air temperature and solar radiation, and as a consequence, both
   bumblebees and butterflies exhibited a regular diurnal activity pattern.
   The butterflies' activity was more constrained by low temperature and
   solar radiation then the bumblebees' activity, and small worker bees
   were more affected by the weather than the larger queens.
   Only 1\% of the butterflies observed were visiting flowers, as compared
   to 69\% of the bumblebees. Thus, butterflies seem to be less important
   pollinators for the alpine plant community than bumblebees. Short-term
   micrometeorological impact on the reproduction of two
   bumblebee-pollinated plant species, Bartsia alpina and Diapensia
   lapponica, was also studied. In both species, reproductive success,
   measured as seed production, was significantly reduced during a spell of
   cold weather in comparison to a warmer period.}},

Abstract = {{The Epacridaceae of Western Australia comprise 181 named species
   distributed in 17 genera. One hundred and seventy seven species (98 \%
   of the total) and ten genera are endemic to the region. Within Western
   Australia, all members are confined to the south, with a bimodal pattern
   of species diversity centred on the sandplains and uplands around the
   Stirling Ranges and Mount Lesueur. Leucopogon, the largest genus,
   reflects this pattern, however, species diversity is greatest on the
   south coastal sandplains.
   All species are woody shrubs, mostly found on neutral or acidic sandy
   soils. Plants of al least 120 species are killed by fire; Astroloma
   contains the only significant number of resprouting species. Although
   some species are in flower every month every year, autumn/winter
   flowering is a common feature of many members of the family. All species
   are biotically pollinated. Bird pollination is found in 18 species in
   six genera. The remaining species are insect pollinated. Bees are the
   major pollinators in Leucopagon, Conostephium and Coleanthera. Moths and
   butterflies are important pollinators in Andersonia, Leucopogon,
   Lysinema and Styphelia. Flies are minor pollinators of some species of
   Andersonia, Leucopogon and Monotoca. All species studied are protandrous
   and outbreeding, with only Cosmelia being capable of self pollination.
   Fruits are fleshy in Astroloma, Brachyloma, Croninia, in certain species
   of Leucopogon and Styphelia and are animal dispersed. Other genera have
   dry, dehiscent fruit with gravity or wind dispersed seeds.
   Many species have relatively narrow distribution ranges, 90 species
   having ranges of over 300 km, 54 species have ranges of 100-300 km and
   37 have ranges of less than 100 km (and there are many undescribed
   species in this group). The conservation status of many species is still
   poorly known. Dieback disease is a major threat to the family, and could
   cause the extinction of several species in the wild. (C) 1996 Annals of

Abstract = {{The profitability of any foraging strategy may be in part dependent on
   the number of foragers adopting it, and so it can be viewed
   mathematically as a `'game.'' We explore here the implications of a
   game-theoretic model of pollinators foraging on a mixed array of two
   newer species, with individual pollinators either specializing on one or
   the other, or else acting as generalists. We further allow for the
   possibility of specialist advantages in foraging efficiency. The
   predicted mixture of pollinator behavioral strategies depends on the
   overall floral density and the relative densities of the two newer
   species. Where floral resources are scarce, pollinators should behave as
   generalists whereas when resources are superabundant, specialization on
   the single most profitable newer type (all else being equal, the
   commonest one) is favored. At intermediate floral densities, a mix of
   floral specializations (floral constancy) is favored, so long as the
   rarer flower's density does not fall below some critical minimum level.
   Where the rarer flower is too rare, a mixture of generalists and
   common-species specialists is favored. Rare flowers are at a
   reproductive dis advantage in all cases, bur their relative success is
   highest where their pollinators are flower constant. (C) 1986 Academic

Abstract = {{In the Central European apoid and masarid fauna, 13 bee species

   were found to be equipped with a specialized pollen-collecting apparatus
   on the face which is used to harvest pollen from nototribic flowers,
   viz. representatives of the Lamiaceae and the Scrophulariaceae. Pollen
   from these two plant families plays an important part in the larval
   nourishment of these hymenopteran species. The pollen-collecting
   apparatus consists of a peculiar facial pilosity composed of transformed
   hairs which are thickened at their base and either knobbed apically
   (Celonites abbreviatus) or extended into a thin tail which is either
   straight and bent at right angles (Rophites spp., Anthophora borealis,
   A. furcata) or wavy (Anthidium spp., Anthocopa andrenoides, Osmia
   aurulenta, O. caerulescens). Nototribic flowers are worked by
   pollen-collecting females by rubbing the facial area covered with the
   transformed hairs over the anthers (Celonites, Anthidium, Anthocopa,
   Osmia), by buzzing the pollen amongst the transformed hairs (Anthophora

   Lecythidaceae in the genera Corythophora, Couratari, Couroupita,

   dominated by a single floral scent compound. Most of the compounds
   identified in this study have been previously reported in floral scents
   collected with head-space techniques from other plant families. However,
   several of the fatty acid derived ewers of hexanol and cis-3-hexenol
   present in Lecythis persistens have been reported only in one or a few
   other plant families. No apparent correlations were found between amount
   and number of floral scene compounds produced on the one hand and
   pollinator reward, morphology, color, or size of flowers on the other
   hand. The fatty acid derivatives found in Grias suggest chat beetles may
   be the pollinators whereas the floral scent compounds of all other
   species studied are consistent with bee pollination. The floral scents
   of the nectar-producing species Eschweilera coriacea and Couratari
   stellata contain, in contrast to the pollen-producing species, compounds
   that are highly attractive to male euglossine bees. This suggests that
   floral scent may play a role in directing male euglossine bees to those

Abstract = {{Plant traits that increase pollinator visitation should be under strong
   selection. However, few studies have demonstrated a causal link between
   natural variation in attractive traits and natural variation in
   visitation to whole plants. Here we examine the effects of flower number
   and size on visitation to wild radish by two taxa of pollinators over 3
   years, using a combination of multiple regression and experimental
   reductions in both traits. We found strong, consistent evidence that
   increases in both flower number and size cause increased visitation by
   syrphid flies. The results for small bees were harder to interpret,
   because the multiple regression and experimental manipulation results
   did not agree. It is likely that increased flower size causes a weak
   increase in small-bee visitation, but strong relationships between
   flower number and small-bee visitation seen in 2 years of observational
   studies were not corroborated by experimental manipulation of this
   trait. Small bees may actually have responded to an unmeasured trait
   correlated with flower number, or lower small-bee abundances when the
   flower number manipulation was conducted may have reduced our ability to
   detect a causal relationship. We conclude that studies using only 1
   year, one method, or measuring only one trait may not provide an
   adequate understanding of the effects of plant traits on pollinator
   attraction.}},

Abstract = {{Nephila clavipes, a large, orb-spinning spider, is distributed
   throughout the Tropics and Subtropics and forages in a variety of
   forest, nonforest, and edge habitats. In this article we show that N.
   clavipes spin silks of varying spectral properties in response to both
   the intensity and spectral composition of its light environment. In
   bright light characterized by broad irradiance spectra, N. clavipes
   produce a complex of yellow pigments that absorb light of wavelengths
   less than 500 nm, making their webs appear golden. In dim light and
   where wavelengths less than 500 nm have been eliminated, N. clavipes
   produce pigments that reflect light between 400 and 500 nm, making their
   webs appear white. Because yellow serves as a superstimulus attracting
   both herbivorous and pollinating insects, yellow silks may attract prey
   to spider webs. By training Trigona fluviventris, a stingless bee
   commonly fed on by N. clavipes, to forage at an artificial feeding site,
   we found that silk color affects insect response in two ways. First,
   yellow webs attract and intercept T. fluviventris more frequently than
   webs of any other color. Second, even after being intercepted once, T.
   fluviventris have difficulty learning to avoid yellow webs. We propose
   that N. clavipes has evolved a foraging behavior that makes use of the
   color cues insects seek while foraging and that the broad distribution
   of N, clavipes results from the spiders' ability to adjust the
   reflectance properties of its silks relative to its local light
   environment, allowing spiders to make use of whatever local populations
   of prey are most abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollinators are thought to shape floral evolution, yet the tempo
   of this process has seldom been measured. I used the prediction equation
   of quantitative genetics, R = h(2)S, to predict the rate at which a
   change in pollinator abundance may have caused divergence in floral
   morphology of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. A selection
   experiment determined the rate at which such divergence can actually
   proceed. Corolla Bare in this species increases by 12\% from populations
   pollinated by a wide assemblage of insect visitors to those pollinated
   only by bumblebees. To simulate the evolutionary process giving rise to
   this change, I used a pollinator selection experiment. Plants with broad
   flowers set significantly more seeds than plants with narrow flowers
   under bumblebee pollination but had equivalent fecundity when visited by
   other insects or hand-pollinated. Bumblebee-mediated selection for broad
   corolla flare intensified from 0.07 at seed set to 0.17 at progeny
   establishment. Maternal parent-offspring regression yielded a confidence
   interval of 0.22-1.00 for trait heritability. Given these parameter
   estimates, the prediction equation shows that broadly flared flowers of
   bumblebee-pollinated P. viscosum could have evolved from narrower ones
   in a single generation. This prediction is matched by an observed 9\%
   increase in offspring corolla flare after a single bout of
   bumblebee-mediated selection, relative to offspring of unselected
   controls. Findings show that plant populations can adapt rapidly to
   abrupt changes in pollinator assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Ten microsatellite loci and a partial sequence of the COII mitochondrial

   a bumble bee of interest for its high-value crop pollination. The
   analysis included eight populations from the European continent, five
   from Mediterranean islands (six subspecies altogether) and one from
   Tenerife (initially described as a colour form of B. terrestris but
   recently considered as a separate species, B. canariensis). Eight of the
   10 microsatellite loci displayed high levels of polymorphism in most
   populations. In B. terrestris populations, the total number of alleles
   detected per polymorphic locus ranged from 3 to 16, with observed
   allelic diversify from 3.8 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 1.4 and average calculated
   heterozygosities from 0.41 +/- 0.09 to 0.65 +/- 0.07. B. canariensis
   showed a significantly lower average calculated heterozygosity (0.12 +/-
   0.08) and observed allelic diversity (1.5 +/- 0.04) as compared to both
   continental and island populations of B. terrestris. No significant
   differentiation was found among populations of B. terrestris from the
   European continent. In contrast, island populations were all
   significantly and most of them strongly differentiated from continental
   populations. B. terrestris mitochondrial DNA is characterized by a low
   nucleotide diversity: 0.18\% +/- 0.07\%, 0.20\% +/- 0.04\% and 0.27\%
   +/- 0.04\% for the continental populations, the island populations and
   all populations together, respectively. The only haplotype found in the
   Tenerife population differs by a single nucleotide substitution from the
   most common continental haplotype of B. terrestris. This situation,
   identical to that of Tyrrhenian islands populations and quite different
   from that of B. lucorum (15 substitutions between terrestris and lucorum
   mtDNA) casts doubts on the species status of B. canariensis. The large
   genetic distance between the Tenerife and B. terrestris populations
   estimated from microsatellite data result, most probably, from a severe
   bottleneck in the Canary island population. Microsatellite and

   of B. terrestris against importation of bumble bees of foreign origin

   Weber in the Southern Chihuahuan Desert, in two vegetation types. The

   produced all day, but the production rate is higher at noon. The flowers
   are visited by insects, mainly solitary bees (Diadasia sp. and Lithurge
   sp.). Floral characteristics and the pollen/ovule ratio suggest that
   Opuntia rastrera is a facultative xenogamous species. Controlled
   pollinations indicate that it is not apomictic and pollinators are
   required to set fruit; it is also self-compatible, but there is strong
   inbreeding depression for fruit set. However, we were unable to
   demonstrate differences in reproductive characters between the

Abstract = {{A guild of 28 winter- and spring-flowering species of two plant
   families, Iridaceae and Geraniaceae, with intense purple to crimson
   flowers and extremely long and slender perianth tubes, is pollinated
   exclusively by two long-tongued flies of the family Nemestrinidae. The
   two species of flies, Prosoeca peringueyi and P. sp. no., are active in
   the late winter and spring, have large bodies, mouthparts 20-50 mm long,
   and forage for nectar while hovering. Plants pollinated by these two
   flies share a suite of convergent floral characteristics, including a
   straight or slightly curved floral tube at least 20 mm and up to 70 mm
   long, relatively short petals or tepals colored predominantly dark blue-
   or red-purple with pale nectar guides, and anthers and stigmas exserted
   from the tube and usually unilateral in orientation. with one exception,
   the flowers of all species secrete large amounts of nectar of relatively
   constant total sugar concentration, mostly 24-29\%, and high
   sucrose:hexose ratio. Most members of the guild have odorless flowers.
   The long floral tube makes nectar unavailable to most insects. including
   a variety of bees, wasps, and other flies that pollinate plants which
   co-occur with members of the long-tubed flower guild. The two Prosoeca
   species have mouthparts long enough to forage effectively on these
   long-tubed flowers, and they are also effective pollinators because
   pollen adheres to their bodies and is transported from flower to flower.
   The flies visit a wide range of plants but are effective pollinators
   only of those with tube lengths greater that their proboscis lengths. We
   have identified four mutually exclusive sites of pollen deposition on
   the insects' bodies: when two or more members of the guild co-occur,
   each species typically utilizes a different pollen deposition site. This
   suggests that pollen contamination is detrimental to reproductive
   success. Differential pollen deposition sites may have evolved in
   response to selection for reduced pollen contamination. Since 27 of the
   28 plant species appear to depend exclusively on these two species of
   Prosoeca for pollination, these flies must be considered keystone
   species in the ecosystems where they occur.}},

Abstract = {{A cladistic analysis of southern African subgenus Lapeirousia, one of
   two subgenera of the exclusively African genus Lapeirousia, yielded four
   equally parsimonious trees, one of which is identical with the strict
   consensus tree. Characters used in the analysis included growth form,
   corm morphology, a range of floral characters, and capsule and seed
   features, not before known to vary significantly in this genus. The
   analysis suggested some surprising evolutionary changes. Notable among
   these is an apparent reversal of perianth tube length from extremely
   long to short, a shift corresponding to a change from pollination by
   long-tongued flies and sphinx moths to pollination by bees and noctuid
   moths. Another unusual change is a shift in floral organization from
   zygomorphy to actinomorphy correlated with an acaulescent growth form.
   The reconstructed phylogeny is used here to assess character evolution
   and patterns of speciation by comparison of species in terminal clades
   in the cladograms. The resulting comparisons suggest that speciation in
   the subgenus is either-allopatric or the result of microgeographic
   differentiation and ecological diversification stimulated by edaphic
   diversity. Despite the variety of floral forms and pollination syndromes
   in the subgenus there is no evidence of sympatric or pollinator-driven
   speciation. Prepollination reproductive isolation appears to be achieved
   by shifts in pollination syndromes between sphinx moths, two guilds of
   long-tongued flies, and bees. The remarkable floral divergence that has
   resulted appears to be a consequence of selection for repeated entry
   into preexisting pollination guilds. The most important of these
   pollination guilds are two long-tongued Ay guilds in which either
   Prosoeca (Nemestrinidae) or Moegistorhynchus (Nemestrinidae) and
   Philoliche (Tabanidae) are pollinators. These two guilds are also likely
   to have been important in promoting speciation in other genera and
   families in the southern African flora.}},

Abstract = {{Many angiosperms have arranged their flowers in inflorescences forming a
   distinct signalling unit to flower visitors. In some species, the
   flowers of inflorescences undergo a temporal colour change corresponding
   exactly to a change in the reward status. Based on information obtained
   from the spectral reflection curves of pre-change and post-chage colours
   of flower corollas and/or floral guides, it was possible to demonstrate
   that the colour phase associated with reward closely corresponds to the
   visual stimuli which trigger behavioural responses of inexperienced
   flower visitors, and that the colour phase associated with less reward
   corresponds to visual stimuli less attractive to naive flower visitors.
   Reciprocal colour changes were not observed. It is to be assumed that
   the unidirectionality of floral colour changes is an adaptation of
   angiosperms aimed at the guidance of first-time flower visitors.
   Signalling reward to inexperienced flower visitors is an additional
   function of floral colour changes. The main function of floral colour
   changes, however, is to provide cues with which the flower visitors can
   learn to associate one colour phase with reward.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome numbers are presented for five genera in the Hemimerideae.
   Mitotic counts were made for 69 species of Diascia, seven species of
   Nemesia, six species of Alonsoa, four species of Hemineris, and two
   species of Diclis. At the species level, 80 of these counts are new
   reports. Counts for two genera (Diclis and Hemimeris) are also new.
   Diascia has a base number of x = 9 and most species are diploid. Four
   tetraploid and one hexaploid species were discovered among the
   perennials of section Racemosae, bringing the total number of polyploids
   for the section to seven of 26 species (ca. 27\%). Two species in
   section Racemosae have more than one cytotype; D. patens has 2n and 4n
   populations, whereas D. capsularis has 2n, 4n and 6n populations. In
   section Diascia, consisting entirely of annuals, only five of 46 species
   (ca. 11\%) are tetraploid, while the rest are diploid. Polyploidy has
   apparently had multiple origins in both sections of Diascia. The seven
   species of Nemesia counted were uniformly 2n = 18, but hypotheses of a
   close relationship between Nemesia and Diascia conflict with differences
   in corolla aestivation and preliminary molecular evidence. Hemimeris and
   Diclis are diploid with 2n = 14 and appear to be closely related.
   Alonsoa is also related to Hemimeris with South African species having
   2n = 28 and South American species mostly 2n = 56. Chromosomal,
   pollination and morphological differences between South African and
   South American species suggest that Alonsoa originated in South Africa
   and dispersed to South America before or shortly after the breakup of
   Gondwanaland. if true, the Scrophulariaceae has had a more ancient
   presence in the Southern Hemisphere than previously suspected.}},

Abstract = {{Although Rhododendron spp. anthers have apical pores and should be
   expected to be buzz pollinated, bees do not normally sonicate them to
   release pollen. Stamens were examined to determine their pollen release
   mechanism; the filaments were shown to have natural vibration modes that
   cause pollen to be forcibly ejected by vibration, providing the pollen
   is mature. The first natural vibration mode of the stamens was found to
   generate centrifugal force sufficient to throw the pollen toward the
   apical pore and out of the anther, so that it adheres to the anther tip
   and hangs in the bee's path to the nectaries. These vibrations may be
   triggered by bees brushing past the long stamens when foraging for
   nectar, so that the flowers retain their pollen until insect vectors
   begin foraging on them. The low frequency vibration modes of the viscin
   threads, which hold the pollen together, may contribute towards the
   pollen ejection by low frequency stamen vibration. Vibration
   transmission of dehiscent anthers containing pollen was good from 50 Hz
   to 850 Hz, suggesting that sonication should be an efficient method of
   pollen collection, although this rarely occurs. Vibratory ejection
   occurs at a constant energy level, rather than the constant force levels

Abstract = {{Pollinators often forage sequentially among the flowers of the same

   proposed that it is more efficient for pollinators to remain constant to

   This interference hypothesis was tested using Bombus impatiens workers.
   Bees that had learned to handle one type of flower (species A) were
   retested on species A after they had learned to handle a second type of
   flower (species B). Interference effects were detected by comparing
   flower access times (time to insert the tongue into the flower) during
   the retesting period with initial access times on species A. Bees
   retested on both simple (red clover, Trifolium pratense) and complex
   (toadflax, Linaria vulgaris) flowers showed no evidence of interference
   after learning simple-flowered plant species (blueweed, Echium vulgare;
   purple loosestrife, Lythrum salicaria). However, bees relearning the
   complex flowers of toadflax showed a 2.2-s (81\%) increase over their
   initial access time after switching to a second complex-flowered species
   (orange touch-me-not, Impatiens capensis). These results suggest that
   the interference effects incurred by bees switching between toadflax and

   relatively small, and are unlikely to account for flower constancy in

Abstract = {{Pollination by hawkmoths (Sphingidae) is described for Cereus peruvianus
   (Cactaceae) in southeastern Brazil. The flower presents a dish to
   bowl-shaped perianth with whitish tepals and a long floral tube. The
   stamens, arranged like a brush, produce abundant pollen and the long,
   tube-like style ends in a multi-lobed stigma. Start of anthesis is
   crepuscular. Anthesis lasts one night. Only little nectar is produced,
   with ca. 27\% sugar concentration. Odour is weak, sweetish and persists
   throughout the night. Handpollination tests indicate that seed
   production is dependent on cross-pollination. Honeybees, scarabid
   beetles, and hawkmoths were observed visiting the flowers, but only the
   latter seem to be effective pollinators. The sphingids, Agrius
   cingulatus and Manduca rustica, showed similar visiting behavior, which
   consisted of hovering, alighting on the perianth, and partially
   introducing the body into the nectar chamber. Both floral attributes and
   the morphological/behavioral characteristics of sphingids point to an
   adaptive trend toward sphingophily in C. peruvianus. This trend is also
   reflected in the flowering season, which matches the main peak of
   activity for sphingids at the study areas, and in the `'steady state''
   flowering pattern, which promotes cross-pollination visits by these

Abstract = {{1. Three major determinants of bees' nectar-foraging patterns are the
   maximum depth at which nectar is accessible (dependent on bee tongue
   length); the minimum profitable energy content per flower (dependent on
   foraging costs and hence on bee body mass); and the minimum threshold
   temperature for flight. These form the axes of a three-dimensional
   template, the competition box.
   2. Thresholds of depth, cost and temperature can be identified for each
   species of bee, delimiting domains within the box compatible with
   foraging by each bee species.
   3. Changes through a day in temperature and in the depth and sugar
   content of nectar define the nectar trajectory through the box for a
   flower species in relation to microclimate and bee activity.
   4. This approach allows systematic appraisal of the roles of
   accessibility, energy content and temperature in interspecific
   competition among bees for nectar, and draws attention to situations in
   which additional factors may be important.
   5. By superimposing a bee-species-specific template on a representative
   nectar trajectory for a given flower species in a given situation, it is
   possible to make reasoned guesses about the expected interactions of
   foraging bee species with a novel flower species and with each other in
   a novel situation. Such guesses are required for evaluating the expected
   impact of honey-bees and other introduced pollinators on the pollination

   treatments. Ants possessed thoracic metapleural glands, suggesting that

   Although significantly fewer pollen grains germinated after thoracic
   contact compared to control pollen, the difference was only 6\% (72.7\%
   vs 78.7\%). Seed-set of flowers that were cross-pollinated with pollen
   that either had been in contact with ants or had not did not differ

   before ants could recruit to them. In B. grandiflora, avian pollinators

   self-pollination may have been an important factor in the evolution of

Abstract = {{In plant species that are pollinated by a variety of animal species,
   spatial and temporal variability in the taxonomic composition of those
   pollinators may cause spatial and temporal variability in selection on

   been widely reported, spatial variability, particularly on a local
   scale, has been studied less frequently; nevertheless, available
   evidence suggests that local spatial variability may be a widespread
   feature of plant-pollinator interactions. In addition, the causes of
   this spatial variability are poorly known. This study was undertaken to
   quantify variability in the taxonomic composition of pollinators
   visiting local populations of black mustard, Brassica nigra, and to
   determine some of the causes of this variability. Simultaneous

   The members of each pair were in close spatial proximity but differed in
   number of plants. Larger plant populations were visited by significantly
   greater numbers of honey bees and significantly fewer small bees than
   small populations on a per-plant basis. There was also a trend toward
   greater syrphid fly visitation in small populations. The increased
   numbers of honey bees at large plant populations is probably due to
   their ability to recruit long distances to the most rewarding plant
   populations. The lower number of small bees at large plant populations
   may be due to competition from honey bees and/or spreading a constant
   number of small bees over the larger number of plants in large

   small native bees, butterflies, and syrphid flies. The effects of anther
   position and other factors on pollen removal during single visits by all
   four pollinator taxa were measured. Flowers with high anther exsertion
   (i.e., anthers placed higher above the opening of the corolla tube)
   tended to have the highest numbers of pollen grains removed, but this
   effect was strongest for honey bees and butterflies. For all pollinator
   taxa, pollen removal increased with the number of pollen grains
   available on a flower and showed a positive, decelerating relationship
   with the duration of the visit. The effects of stigma position and other
   factors on pollen deposition during single visits by honey bees and
   butterflies were also studied. The nectar-feeding butterflies had a
   higher pollination efficiency (percentage of pollen grains removed from
   anthers that were subsequently deposited on a stigma) than the nectar-
   and pollen-feeding honey bees. Flowers with intermediate stigma
   exsertion had the highest numbers of pollen grains deposited on their
   stigmas by butterflies, but stigma exsertion had no effect on deposition
   by honey bees. For both butterflies and honey bees, pollen deposition on
   the recipient flower increased with the amount of pollen removed from
   the donor flower, and there was a positive, decelerating relationship
   between deposition and time spent at the flower; these results are
   analogous to those for pollen removal. The effects of anther and stigma
   exsertion on pollen removal and deposition did not fit predictions based
   on patterns of floral correlations, but results for morphology, pollen
   availability, time spent per visit, and pollinator efficiency are in
   broad agreement with previous studies, suggesting the possible emergence

Abstract = {{Various sources of germination heterogeneity of carrot (Daucus carota
   L.) seeds were investigated: germination conditions (temperature, oxygen
   tension), size of seeds, position of the umbels on the mother plants,
   and pollination conditions of male-sterile plants in hybrid seed
   production. All seeds tested germinated over a large range of
   temperatures (5-35 degrees C). However, low temperatures (5-10 degrees
   C) and temperatures above 30 degrees C reduced germination. Seeds were
   also sensitive to oxygen deprivation, but their sensitivity to hypoxia
   depended on the cultivar. The germination responses of seeds to
   temperature and oxygen depended on their size, particularly at sub- and
   supra-optimal temperatures. The largest seeds (1.8-2.1 mm) of commercial
   lots usually germinated better at 5 degrees C and were more sensitive to
   oxygen deprivation than the smallest ones (1.2-1.8 mm). Experiments
   performed with open pollinated plants showed that seeds produced by
   umbels of first and second orders germinated faster and at higher
   percentages than those collected on third-order umbels. Evidence for the
   involvement of pollination conditions in the germination quality of
   carrot seeds was given by pollination by honey bees of male-sterile
   plants cultivated at various distances from the pollen donors. The
   longer the distance of the mother plants from the pollinating plants,
   the lower the seed yield, the heavier the mean seed weight, the more
   difficult the germination of seeds, and the higher their sensitivity to
   oxygen deprivation.}},

   eight floral traits in two sympatric monkeyflower species that are

Abstract = {{Attempts by males of the solitary bee Anthophora plumipes Pallas
   (Apoidea: Anthophoridae) to mate with foraging females at flowers of
   comfrey, Symphytum orientale, were studied. The mating system conformed
   to scramble competition polygyny. After an initial period of nectar
   foraging in the morning, males patrolled the comfrey and attempted to
   copulate with any females they encountered. The majority of females were
   unreceptive, and were able to reject the male after his initial pounce,
   which knocked the female to the ground. Females could experience rates
   of attempted copulation exceeding once every 3 s, which significantly
   reduced their rate of visiting flowers and hence prolonged the period
   required to provision nest cells. Females responded to male harassment
   by evasive flight and physical repulsion and also by a more general
   change in foraging behaviour. Females abandoned flowers on the outer
   parts of plants frequented by males, and foraged from flowers inside the
   plant's growth where males did not often venture. Consideration of sugar
   rewards per flower and handling times suggested that male harassment
   halved the rate of reward for females from exposed outer flowers. When
   males were removed from the site, females abandoned the inner flowers
   and foraged from more profitable outer flowers. When males were
   released, the original pattern of behaviour was quickly re-established.
   During poor weather the ability of females to provision cells became
   marginal, and male harassment could thus have significant consequences

Abstract = {{Selection on flowers has often been viewed as being particularly strict,

   close relationship between floral morphology and pollination success. My
   studies on the amount of pollen removed from androecia and deposited on
   stigmas in single visits by bumblebees did not confirm this supposition.
   Trimming off parts of the floral vestibule with scissors and gluing in
   pleats had very little effect on the amount of pollen that bees moved.
   In reciprocal transfer experiments, flowers from different populations
   sometimes differed in the amount of pollen moved, but when the two
   species were compared in sympatry, pollen removal and deposition
   differed hardly at all. A comparison of the relationship between pollen
   movement and floral morphology among 15 populations showed that,
   although there was great heterogeneity in the amount of pollen moved,
   the observed differences were independent of floral morphology. None of
   this supports a belief in strong selection that fine-tunes the
   mechanical fit between bee and newer; selection for visitation success
   based on pollinator behaviour may have a much stronger influence on

   (50-57\%) did not differ within or between years, and was about 19\%

   visits by honeybees did not differ through the flowering season and the
   number of pollen grains deposited on stigmas within 12 h of flowers
   opening exceeded the number of ovules per flower, indicating that the
   quality rather than the quantity of pollination limited seed set. Pollen
   limitation was caused by concurrent self- and cross-pollination and the
   subsequent abortion of some selfed ovules due to inbreeding depression.
   Natural seed set (55\%) was intermediate between selfed (43\%) and
   crossed (75\%) flowers and was not increased when flowers that had been
   available to pollinators for 24 h were hand cross-pollinated, suggesting
   that ovules were already fertilized. Similarly, experimental pollination
   with both cross and self pollen within 24 h of flowers opening did not
   increase seed set relative to natural seed set, indicating that both
   cross- and self-fertilizations had occurred. In contrast, when selfing
   followed crossing by 48 h, or vice versa, seed set did not differ from
   crossed-only or selfed-only flowers, respectively, indicating that
   ovules were pre-empted by the first pollination. Collectively, these
   results indicate that under natural conditions self pollen pre-empts
   ovules, rendering them unavailable for cross-fertilization. This selfing
   reduces fecundity by 50\%, as estimated from the natural production of
   cross seeds when selfing was prevented. Consequently, selection should
   favour floral traits, such as increased stigma-anther separation or
   protandry, that reduce interference between male and female functions

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of petal-size variation in tall bellflower,
   Campanula americana, on pollen removal rates, seed set, and pollinator
   behavior. Pollen removal, seed set, and the behavior of two bee visitors
   (Bombus and Halictus) were assessed in flowers that had 0\%, 50\%, or
   100\% of their petal lobes removed. Pollen removal rates did not differ
   significantly among the three treatment groups, probably due to the
   presence of an ineffective (''ugly'') pollinator (Halictus), which
   quickly removed pollen from completely reduced flowers. Seed set was
   significantly positively correlated with petal size. Bumblebees
   discriminated against reduced flowers, thereby lowering pollen movement
   to reduced flowers. Halictid bees rarely contacted stigmatic surfaces
   and thus pollen delivery to reduced flowers was limited. The presence of
   an ugly pollinator probably obscured the effect of petal reduction on
   pollen receipt, thus masking the impact of attractive structures on male
   fitness. Given the positive relationship between seed set and petal
   size, we caution against ascribing expenditure on attractive structures
   exclusively to male function. In plants with many ovules, expenditure on
   attractive structures may affect seed set.}},

   cruciata, a rare species in The Netherlands, was studied in two dune
   populations (20 and c. 300 flowering individuals, respectively) during
   the summer of 1989. Gentiana cruciata was fully self-compatible, but
   spontaneous self-pollination resulted in severe pollen limitation:
   natural pollination showed lower reproductive success as compared to
   hand-pollinations. In addition, reproductive success in the small
   population was significantly lower through all pollination treatments.
   Natural pollination was carried out mainly by the bumblebee Bon?bus
   pascuorum visiting the flowers for nectar, which was available at all
   floral stages but in greatest quantities during the morning hours, The
   number of visitors and visits to the flowers was generally high.
   However, the constancy of bumblebee visitors (measured as the proportion
   of heterospecific pollen found on bumblebees) decreased strongly in the
   afternoon, when nectar standing crop was relatively low. The number of
   visits and visitors to the G. cruciata flowers remained still very high,
   but the average time spent per flower decreased significantly. We argue
   that, in general, the low reproductive success through natural

   competition through heterospecific pollen (mainly of the abundantly

Abstract = {{Optimal foraging theory predicts that foragers should distribute

   bumblebees on plants varying in size (Viscaria vulgaris) was
   proportional to the number of open flowers per plant, and on plants
   varying in rate of nectar production per flower (Anchusa officinalis)
   proportional to the nectar production per plant. These distributions
   results in a nectar gain per flower which is independent of plant size
   and rate of nectar production per flower.
   A computer simulation showed that the distribution of the bees and the
   equalization of the gain per flower can partly be explained by the bees'
   systematic searching for nectar, and partly by a non-random plant
   choice. The bees search systematically by using an optimal rejection
   threshold gain to avoid recently depleted flowers. The non-random plant
   choices consist in preferences for large plants and high nectar
   producers.
   At stands varying in plant density (Viscaria vulgaris), bee and flower
   densities were proportional, which also results in a constant gain per

   flowers on plants with more nectar. The increase in flower visits
   significantly increased pollen deposition on stigmas and pollen removal

   the proportion of self pollen deposited on stigmas increased
   significantly and rapidly. Based on simulated hawkmoth visits, seed set

   simple model combining these results predicts that the form of selection

   Hieracium is unlikely to affect reproductive success in these six

Abstract = {{Floral biology and pollination mechanisms of 33 herbaceous monocot
   species were studied in the tropical cloud forest of Henri Pittier

   melittophily (16.2\%), myiophily (10.8\%), anemophily (8.1\%), and
   chiropterophily (5.4\%). Of 71 visiting species recorded on 33 plant
   species, 67.6\% were pollinators and 32.4\% were only visitors;
   coleopterans and dipterans were the most diverse groups. Studies of
   floral biology showed that 46.9\% of the species were monoe
   cious-dichogamous and 53.1\% were hermaphroditic -adichogamous. Among
   adichogamous species, 15.6\% were herkogamous. The pollination units
   were the flowers or inflorescences in hermaphroditic and monoecious
   species. Bat-, bird-, and bee-pollinated species produced nectar,
   although pollen was also found as a reward in bee- and bat-pollinated
   species; beetle pollination was associated with floral parts as the
   reward. Floral longevity of vertebrate pollinated species ranged from 10
   to 24 hours; floral longevity for bee-pollinated species was similar or
   longer than for vertebrate-pollinated species. For cantharophilous and
   wind-pollinated species, pollination unit longevity was increased by the
   longevity of the female flowers. These different patterns in time of
   anthesis, floral longevity, and pollinator species, together with
   vertical and horizontal species distribution, are mechanisms that

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of A. gracilis was examined in glasshouse plants
   and natural populations. The species is both protogynous and
   pre-zygotically self-sterile (self-incompatible). Protogyny prevents
   autopollination (autogamous self-pollination), and self-incompatibility
   avoids geitonogamous self-fertilisation. This sequence is essential
   because prior selfing blocks the style with pollen tubes and prevents
   subsequent outcrossing. Flowers have no discernible daytime odour, the
   pollen is clumped and not easily shaken from opened anthers, and daytime
   insect visitors are rarely observed in the field. However in
   long-established populations, mast plants carry one or a few capsules
   during winter-spring and seeds per capsule are generally high.
   Reproduction of natural populations involves reliable pollinators of
   unknown identity, possibly small flies, bees or moths lured by a tiny
   amount of sucrose-rich nectar secreted by the hypogynous disc. It is not
   anomalous that A. gracilis has two devices for preventing
   self-fertilisation, protogyny and strong self-incompatibility, as both
   are functional aspects of the same outcrossing system. This is the first
   report of self-incompatibility in the Anthocercideae which is an old and

Abstract = {{Abiotic factors may constrain the functioning of species interactions
   such as plant-pollinator mutualisms. I investigated how thermal
   environment affects the interaction between the early-blooming daffodil,
   Narcissus longispathus (Amaryllidaceae) and its major bee pollinator
   (Andrena bicolor; Andrenidae), focusing simultaneously on plant and
   pollinator sides of the interaction. I studied fruit and seed set,
   flower duration, and the intrafloral thermal environment of N.
   longispathus, and the thermal biology, foraging behavior, and
   thermoregulatory ability of A. bicolor over a 6-yr period in
   southeastern Spain.
   N. longispathus flowers from February to April, when unsuitable weather
   often limits pollinator activity, yet most flowers are successfully
   pollinated in all years and sites. Fruit set was weakly pollen limited,
   but among flowers setting fruit the proportion of ovules developing into
   seeds was not. Individual flowers lasted for 17 d on average, remaining
   functional during this period. On sunny days, the air inside N.
   longispathus flowers was significantly warmer than outside. Mean
   temperature excess inside flowers was as high as 8 degrees C, and was
   positively related to solar irradiance. Within flowers, air temperature
   was highest around the anthers; this intrafloral gradient was consistent
   with variation among perianth parts in radiation transmittance.
   Andrena bicolor foraged in N. longispathus flowering patches only on
   sunny days with air temperature >12 degrees-13 degrees C, and foraging
   behavior and flower visitation rate were temperature dependent. Bees
   were able to fly at relatively low thoracic temperatures (T-th; range 22
   degrees-31 degrees C) and this was essential for successfully foraging
   at N. longispathus. Under the range of irradiance and air temperature
   found at foraging sites, A. bicolor individuals inside flowers were able
   to reach T-th suitable for flight by passive means alone. Under
   laboratory conditions, A. bicolor was unable to raise or otherwise
   regulate T-th by physiological means, but free-flying individuals
   thermoregulated behaviorally. Basking was used to raise T-th and
   intrafloral microclimate, by influencing the proportion of foraging time
   devoted to basking, played an important role in thermoregulation. Flower
   visitation rate was positively related to the average temperature inside
   visited flowers, and the probability of basking immediately after one
   floral visit declined with increasing flower temperature. I conclude
   that the favorable microclimate within N. longispathus flowers, their
   long duration, and the thermal biology of A. bicolor, were critical
   elements in this early-season pollination system.}},

   dioecious (separate male and female individuals). We conducted detailed
   measurements on 150 marked plants over two years to (1) quantitatively
   describe the variation in sex expression and elucidate the factors
   responsible for gender variation in males, (2) determine the role of
   plant size in regulating the flowering behavior through the year, and
   (3) document pollinator visitation to males and females. The variability
   in sex expression differed between males and females. Females only
   reproduced by seed. In contrast, gender in males was extremely variable:
   35\% of males reproduced only by pollen donation (pure males) and 65\%
   produced pollen and varying amounts of fruit and seeds (inconstant
   males). The ability to produce fruit was highly correlated with
   individual plant size. Inconstant males were significantly larger than
   pure males. Individual plant size also determined the flowering pattern
   through the year. Unlike most other desert plant species that typically
   flower after the winter rains, large O. baccatus plants flowered all
   year. Small plants, regardless of sex, flowered only during the winter
   months. The flowers of O. baccatus were visited by a diverse suite of
   insects including wasps, bees, ants, beetles, flies, and butterflies.
   Perhaps owing to the greater attractiveness of the floral display of
   males (due to the presence of yellow pollen), males were visited by many
   more insects than females. Over four observation days, 526 insects were
   counted on male plants compared to only 39 on females.}},

Abstract = {{Narcissus tazetta shows a genetically-based discrete polymorphism for
   style length similar to that well known in heterostylous plants. Plants
   are either short- (S) or long-styled (L). In Israel, marsh populations

   differ in size, flowering time and duration, flower orientation,
   inflorescence display, vegetative reproduction, and pollinators. The
   main visitors to flowers in marshes are hawkmoths, whereas in the hills
   they are visited by short-tongued insects: solitary bees and hoverflies.
   The pollination efficiency of these insects was investigated by studying
   foraging behaviour, visit rate, and pollen deposition on stigmas. Our
   findings are consistent with the hypothesis of lower efficiency of
   pollination of S flowers by short-tongued insects, resulting in the
   exclusion of this morph from the hills. Additionally, we considered the
   possibility that there might be pollination ecotypes corresponding to
   the two habitats (marsh and hill) and examined variation in a set of
   continuous flower traits related to pollination biology. Flower tube
   length was the only trait showing a distinct difference between the two
   habitat types. Although the concentration of nectar was not different
   between habitats, L flowers presented more concentrated nectar than S
   flowers. Such a difference in nectar concentration may be of adaptive
   value for the pollination of the L flowers by short-tongued pollinators

   the grass Molinia caerulea and co-flowered with Erica tetralix and
   Calluna vulgaris. The flowering period lasted from July to October,
   peaking in late August to late September. Flowers are protandrous. The
   species appeared to be self-compatible, but spontaneous self-pollination
   was strongly limited. Hand-crossing and hand-selfing resulted in the
   same amount of seed set as in natural pollination. Reproductive success
   was dramatically reduced late in the season. Pollination was achieved
   sternotribically by the species Bombus pascuorum, which visited the
   flowers for nectar. In the study area, three patch types were
   distinguished: co-dominated by Erica, by Calluna and Erica, and by
   Molinia, respectively. Frequency of visits to Gentiana was highest in
   the Erica-patch. However, this did not result in a higher seed set. In
   the Molinia-patch seed set was reduced. However, in the Molinia-patch
   the mean number of ovules was greater than in the others (as high as in
   plants raised indoors and in cross-pollinated plants). Fruits from the

   conclude that, in this remnant population, Gentiana is not

   geitonogamy is frequent, which may lead to inbreeding depression. The
   greater number of ovules observed in Molinia-patches may reflect an

Abstract = {{Darwin pointed out that plants with vertical inflorescences are likely
   to be outcrossed if the inflorescence is acropetalous (flowers from the
   bottom up), the flowers are protandrous (pollen is dispersed before
   stigmas are receptive), and pollinators move upward on the
   inflorescence. This syndrome is common in species pollinated by bees and
   flies, and very few exceptions are known. We investigated flowering
   phenology and pollinator behavior in Besseya bullii (Scrophulariaceae)
   and found that it did not fit Darwin's syndrome. The vertical
   inflorescence was acropetalous but the flowers were distinctly
   protogynous, so flowers with neu ly receptive stigmas appeared on the
   inflorescence above those with dehiscing anthers. A number of small
   insects visited B. bullii; bees in the family Halictidae (Augochlorella
   striata and Dialictus spp.) were most common. When insects moved between
   gender phases within inflorescences, they moved up more often than down
   (61\% versus 39\% of observations, respectively) but this difference was
   only marginally significant, Most visits were to male-phase flowers only
   and this preference was more pronounced for pollen-foraging insects than
   for nectar-foraging insects, B. bullii was self-compatible, so its
   flowering characteristics potentially could result in considerable
   self-pollination. However, an average of 38\% of the lowermost flowers
   opened before any pollen was available on the same inflorescence; these
   `'solo females'' had a high probability of outcrossing (though fruit set
   was relatively low in the bottom portion of the inflorescence). Upper
   flowers may also be outcrossed because downward insect movement was not
   uncommon, Therefore protogyny in B. bullii may not necessarily lead to
   more selfing than would protandry.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are based on mutual benefits; the plant
   gains fertilization and the pollinator gains food resources. But aside
   from providing rewards, flowers can be risky places to visit, for
   example if a predator ambushes during the feeding/pollination process.
   Here, we show that pollination may also involve the transmission of
   pathogens for the pollinators. Experimental evidence is given that a
   trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted
   within populations of its hosts, the bumblebees Bombus spp., through the
   shared use of flowers. Important floral characteristics such as nectar
   availability or inflorescence architecture may also affect transmission
   rate. Therefore, in addition to energetic considerations, pollinator
   strategies could also be governed by the risk of contracting pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of the climbing cacti Hylocereus polyrhizus

   costaricensis (Weber) Britt. \& Rose, and Selenicereus megalanthus
   (Schum. ex Vaupel) Moran (syn. Mediocactus megalanthus) was studied with
   the aim of cultivating the cacti in Israel as fruit crops.  Flowering in
   Hylocereus spp. occurred in two to three waves during the summer,
   whereas in S. megalanthus, flowering was concentrated at the end of
   autumn.  Flowers of all species opened 1 to 1.5 hours before sunset and
   closed al-most-equal-to 6 hours after sunrise.  In the Hylocereus spp.,
   H. polyrhizus and H. costaricensis were self-unfruitful, and
   cross-pollination with other species led to high fruit set (100\%). 
   Hylocereus undatus was self-fruitful, setting fruit with self-pollen.
   Cross-pollination between the clones of S. megalanthus led to a high
   fruit set and clone was self-fruitful.  In contrast to H. undatus, S.
   megalanthus clones could set fruit without pollen vector involvement,
   although the set was slightly lower than with hand pollination.  Pollen
   source influenced fruit weight.  In the self-fruitful species of
   Hylocereus spp. were obtained by specific cross-combinations within the
   group.  Fruit of S. megalanthus had a lower weight than fruit of the
   Hylocereus spp. Flowers of all species were visited by day-active
   honeybees only.  Fruit set and fruit weight with open pollination was
   lower than with hand pollination in Hylocereus spp.  Since stigma
   receptivity and pollen germinability stayed high during anthesis, the
   low pollination effectivity has to be related to other factors, such as
   the short bee visits and the absence of specific adaptation by the bees
   to the flower.  In S. megalanthus, fruit set and fruit weight with open
   pollination were similar to values obtained with hand pollination.  This
   similarity is probably related to the fact that pollen transfer in open
   pollination is achieved by bee visits and direct transfer of pollen to
   the stigma, which occurs via physical contact between anthers and stigma
   during flower closing.}},

Abstract = {{In most higher plants sexual interactions are mediated by animal
   pollinators that affect the number and differential reproductive success
   of mates. The number and sex of breeding individuals in populations are
   central factors in evolutionary theory, but the quantitative effect of
   plant population size on pollinator-mediated mating is understudied. We
   investigated variation in pollen removal (male function) and fruit set
   (female function) among flowering populations of different size of two
   bumblebee- and one butterfly-pollinated, rewardless, pollen-limited,
   hermaphroditic orchid species in Sweden. As the amount of pollen removed
   from plants by insects (either absolute or proportional) increased, so
   did the number of pollinations, whereas the proportions of plants with
   different pollinator-designated functional sex (male, female,
   hermaphrodite) depended primarily on the ratio between the amount of
   fruit set and pollen removed within populations. A larger population
   size was found to have several effects: (1) the total numbers of
   pollinia removed and fruits set increased; (2) the proportion of pollen
   removed from plants decreased; (3) the proportion of flowers pollinated
   decreased in the butterfly- but was not affected in the
   bumblebee-pollinated species; (4) the ratio between fruits set and
   pollinia removed increased linearly in the bumblebee-pollinated species
   but reached a maximum at c. 80 individuals in the butterfly-pollinated
   species; (5) the numbers of pollinator-designated pure male and
   hermaphrodite individuals increased; and (6) the variance in pollinium
   removal, but not fruit set, increased among individuals. These findings
   empirically verify the basic importance of population size for the
   mating structure of outcrossing plants, and indicate that selection for
   female sexual traits is reinforced when population size is smaller while
   selection for male sexual traits is reinforced when population size is
   larger.}},

Abstract = {{Thr Fraction of pollen that is carried over from one flower to the next
   as a pollinator visits a sequence of flowers has a strong effect on
   patterns of mating in plant populations. Although most studies have used
   simple exponential or geometric functions to represent carryover, pollen
   deposition patterns often show longer-than-geometric tails, suggesting a
   systematic increase in the carryover fraction. We introduce a changing
   carryover model that allows the carryover fraction to increase or
   decrease during a sequence of visits. Maximum Likelihood methods were
   used to fit constant and changing carryover models to twelve previously
   published data sets. A model with an increasing carryover fraction
   provided a better fit than a constant carryover model in 75\% of the
   cases examined. We found only partial evidence for one proposed cause of
   increasing carryover, the burial of donor pollen beneath pollen
   collected from recipient flowers. Finally, we use the re suits for
   Ipomopsis aggregata, a hummingbird-pollinated plant that presents many
   flowers simultaneously, to show that the changing carryover model
   predicts less pollen will be transferred among flowers on the same plant
   (geitonogamy) than does a constant carryover model fit to the same

Abstract = {{In species of Cassia, Senna, and Chamaecrista an orifice leading into a
   stigmatic cavity is present at the tip of the style. The size of the
   orifice, the occurrence and morphology of surrounding trichomes or
   papillae, and the occurrence of a drop of secretion at its outlet were
   recorded in 17 species belonging to the three genera of the subtribe
   Cassiinae. Much of the observed variation in these characters apparently
   reflects different modes of pollen capturing and varying degrees of
   secretion exposure. In some of the species studied no secretion was
   noticeable at the entrance to the stigmatic cavity. The unusual type of
   stigma in the Cassiinae does not fit into any of the recognized main
   groups of angiosperm stigmas. It is conjectured that in the
   buzz-pollinated Cassiinae species with small stigmatic orifices, the
   secretory material is retained within the stigmatic cavity, to be
   extruded by vibratory movements of the style induced by a buzzing bee.
   It is also hypothesized that in the wet tropics, concealment of
   secretory materials within a cavity prevents their washing away or
   dilution by rain. Furthermore, in the Cassiinae, the considerable
   variation in features of the style and of the stigma may function as
   mechanisms isolating between sympatric, visitor-sharing, concurrently

Abstract = {{The press morphology of the reservoir of the mesosomal gland of male
   large carpenter bees (tribe Xylocopini) was examined in 46 taxa (species

   species of Xylocopa examined possess a cuticle-lined invagination that
   originates along the suture between the metanotum and propodeum. Size of
   the reservoir and arrangement of the tubules are consistent within
   subgenera (with a single exception) but variable among most subgenera.
   The morphological extremes range from a simple, short invagination that
   opens medially to a complex set of convoluted tubules that open from
   paired, laterally-positioned openings and extend forward to the
   metanotum or scutellum and posteriorly to the propodeal pit. Comparisons
   of mesosomal shapes between the sexes or between males in taxa with and
   without this reservoir reveal that structural changes of the posterior
   elements of the mesosoma are associated with the presence of the large
   reservoirs. In turn, reservoir size is predictive of male reproductive

Abstract = {{Silene dioica (L.) Clairv.  (Caryophyllaceae) is an insect pollinated
   and obligately cross-fertilising herb commonly found on serpentine, i.e.
   soils rich in heavy metals, and on cultivated meadows.  Groups of Silene
   populations were studied in two areas in the Scandianvian mountains.  In
   a northern area Silene populations grow in an open pine and birch forest
   while in the south, populations are surrounded by a continuous and dense
   spruce forest.  Gene flow, estimated on the basis of allele frequencies,
   is highly restricted in the south in comparison to the north.  This has
   led to an extensive genetic differentiation among populations.  The
   pollinator guilds (Thricops flies, syrphid flies and bumblebees) are
   similar in the northern and southern populations and can therefore not
   account for the difference in gene flow.  The flowering in nearby
   populations overlaps broadly and is also not the reason for the genetic
   differentiation in the south.  The differentiation is more likely due to
   vegetation that limits pollinator movement.  The level of gene flow
   differs in the two habitats both in the north and in the south.  The
   gene flow is restricted among serpentine populations but common among
   meadow populations.  Pollen dispersal, and in particular, anthropogenic
   seed dispersal mediate gene flow among meadows.  Serpentine populations
   are unaffeced by human activity.  Pollinators are therefore the main
   agent of gene flow on serpentine.  This study shows the importance of
   the surrounding vegetation in influencing gene flow patterns among
   populations as well as that habitat fragmentation affects the genetic
   properties of plant populations.  In addition, we have also observed a
   restricted gene flow within populations.  Enzyme allele frequencies show
   an excess of homozygotes within most of the populations.  This can be
   explained through limited pollen dispersal and differences in male and
   female flowering density.}},

Abstract = {{A recent model by Lloyd and Webb derives conditions necessary for the
   evolution of distyly based on pollen-transfer probabilities between
   ancestral morphs and invading mutants. We used bumblebees visiting
   artificial flowers to measure the parameters of the model. Our findings
   supported the first evolutionary step proposed by the model,
   establishment of a stigma-height polymorphism. Conditions for the
   subsequent establishment of an anther-height polymorphism were not
   satisfied by pollen-transfer patterns alone. Because conditions for the
   first step are considered more onerous, however, and because the second
   stage depends on inbreeding depression as well as pollen-transfer
   patterns, we interpret our results as supporting the plausibility of the
   Lloyd-Webb model. Video images of bees visiting glass-sided artificial
   flowers demonstrate a mechanism for disassortative pollination between
   the ancestral and mutant morph. In general, pollen-transfer
   probabilities were negatively correlated with the height difference
   between anthers of the donor and stigma of the recipient. Style length
   affects bee feeding posture in such a way that disassortative
   pollination could feasibly occur in the absence of an anther-height

Abstract = {{Native wild bees from the Portuguese northwestern region collect pollen
   from different plant species during the foraging season (May to August).
   After analyzing the nest pollen contents, stored by some Megachilidae
   species used as efficient crops pollinators, we may conclude about the
   presence of pollen grains belonging to a strict range of families.  In
   some species, the almost exclusive presence of pollen grains belonging
   to the Leguminosae family in the pollen contents of nest cells, opens a
   new pathway for the understanding of the relationship between insect and
   type of culture (insect diet).  The presence of a particular pollen,
   while carrier of valuable information about the local floral looked for
   by wild bees, is an indicator of the food source.  We may, this way,
   maximize insect utilization and minimize the costs brought about by
   industrial mass-rearing.}},

Abstract = {{Steam-distilled floral fragrance oils from nine distinctive cultivars of
   Theobroma cacao L. (Sterculiaceae) in Costa Rica were examined with
   GC-MS to determine whether or not major differences existed among these
   cultivars for volatile constituents comprising 50\% or more of the
   samples. The cultivars selected for floral oil analyses were chosen to
   represent diverse cultivars having supposedly different genetic
   backgrounds and histories of artificial selection for agronomic
   purposes. Cluster analysis revealed two major groupings of cultivars:
   those with higher molecular weight dominant compounds, and those having
   lower molecular weight compounds. Additionally, one cultivar, Rim-100,
   selected from criollo or ancestral-type cacao in Mexico and resembling
   criollo in the appearance of flowers and fruits, formed an extreme group
   having the highest molecular weight profile for major volatile
   compounds. Based upon these analyses, bioassays using McPhail traps were
   performed in an abandoned cacao plantation in northeastern Costa Rica
   during rainy and dry seasons to determine the relative attraction of
   these oils to flying insects. Bioassays revealed that the Rim-100
   cultivar attracted by far the greatest numbers of cacao-associated
   midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae and Cecidomyiidae), as well as
   stingless bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Meliponinae), suggesting that a
   floral fragrance having high-molecular-weight volatiles is more potent
   as an attractant to flying insects than floral oils having
   lower-molecular-weight compounds. It is suggested that Rim-100 more
   closely resembles an ancestral or wild-type cacao than the other
   cultivars examined, and therefore it is more effective in attracting
   opportunistic dipteran floral visitors and pollinators than other
   cultivars in plantation settings. Several of the major volatile
   compounds found in the floral oils of T. cacao and other species of
   Theobroma occur in mandibular and other exocrine glands in various bees,
   including stingless bees and halictids, known visitors of Theobroma
   flowers. These compounds are particularly present in noncultivated
   species of Theobroma and have much more noticeable fragrances than the
   seemingly scentless flowers of cultivated T. cacao selected for
   agriculture. It is hypothesized that the floral attraction system of
   ancestral or wild (noncultivated) T. cacao and other species of
   Theobroma may have evolved to attract certain bees as their principal
   pollinators in natural habitats in the Neotropics, with a floral reward
   hypothesized as being sociochemicals needed by bees for mating,
   foraging, territorial defense, etc. Because of the many generations of
   extensive selection by cloning for desired cultivars, T. cacao might
   have lost much of its original floral attraction system for bees,
   instead being pollinated opportunistically by dipterans in plantation
   habitats. This may help to explain why natural pollination in cultivated
   T. cacao is generally very poor relative to observed levels of fruit-set
   in wild or noncultivated species of Theobroma.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in pollen aperture number has been widely described among and
   within angiosperm species, and fossil data indicate that aperture number
   has increased over geological time.  Within species, variation in
   aperture number is very often found within individual plants
   (heteromorphism), with the genetic variation being expressed in morph
   proportions produced by individuals.  We present models of the evolution
   of pollen aperture number motivated by previous results on Viola
   diversifolia in which higher aperture number results in more rapid
   germination and lower longevity.  The models demonstrate that under
   certain conditions selection results in a mixed evolutionarily stable
   strategy (ESS), in which all plants produce all types of pollen.  In
   contrast, selection cannot easily maintain a standard genetic
   polymorphism with each pollen morph produced on a different plant. 
   These predictions match the available evidence on patterns of natural
   variation in pollen aperture number.  The models and data lead to an
   unusual evolutionary prediction:  a population-level increase in the
   mean number of pollen apertures should occur by a progressive increase
   in the proportion of higher aperture-number morphs produced on
   individual plants, rather than by an increase in the proportion of
   individuals that consistently produce pollen with different aperture

Abstract = {{Selection favouring an outcrossing plant's ability to sire seeds
   generally promotes floral characters that increase (1) the frequency of
   pollinator visits, (2) the number of pollen grains dispersed to other
   plants by each pollinator and (3) the probability of a pollen grain
   successfully fertilizing an ovule after reaching a stigma.  Flowers
   influence pollen dispersal and fertilization probabilities by
   determining the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits
   (dispensing schedule).  We model male reproductive success to identify
   optimal dispensing schedules, which characteristically involve monotonic
   increases in the proportion of remaining pollen removed during
   successive visits.  These schedules balance the benefits of restricted
   removal, which counteracts the diminishing returns associated with
   animal pollination (e.g. pollinator grooming, local mate competition),
   with the advantages of increased removal to avoid time-dependent losses
   in fertilization ability (e.g. pollen precedence, declining viability). 
   Because pollinator availability mediates this balance, the most
   effective dispensing schedule allows dynamic adjustment of removal to
   the prevailing frequency of visits experienced by individual plants.  As
   an example of such dynamic removal we demonstrate that the dispensing
   mechanism of Lupinus sericeus flowers allows facultative adjustment of
   removal to the interval between visits.  Because optimal control of
   pollen removal can increase a plant's mating opportunities by an order
   of magnitude, dispensing mechanisms should be a common component of
   floral design.}},

Abstract = {{1. Given the diminishing returns associated with animal pollination,
   floral mechanisms that restrict pollen removal by individual pollinators
   and encourage transport on many pollinators generally promote a plant's
   cumulative success in pollen dispersal. Effective mechanisms for
   dispensing pollen should allow facultative adjustment of removal in
   response to the prevailing frequency of visits to a plant.
   2. We investigated whether the poricidal anthers of Dodecatheon
   conjugens, a buzz-pollinated species, function as dispensing mechanisms
   by (a) comparing pollen removal in response to buzz frequencies that
   pollen-collecting bumble-bees (Bombus spp.) produce
   (less-than-or-equal-to 400 Hz) with removal stimulated by higher
   frequencies and (b) comparing removal from flowers that waited different
   periods of time for their first visit.
   3. Mechanical vibration of D. conjugens flowers for 1s at frequencies
   less-than-or-equal-to 400 Hz removed an average of 9.7\% of available
   pollen, compared to 23-4\% for 450-1000 Hz vibrations (all frequencies
   involved similar input energy). Buzzing by bees and mechanical vibration
   removed more pollen from older virgin flowers.
   4. These results imply that the poricidal anthers of Dodecatheon flowers
   are `tuned' higher than the buzz frequencies used by their
   pollen-collecting pollinators, so that they effectively restrict pollen
   removal, while also allowing increased removal when visits occur rarely.
   Previously published results from other buzz-pollinated species indicate
   that poricidal anthers generally function as dispensing mechanisms.
   5. Poricidal anthers probably enabled convergent evolution of the
   solanoid flower, which localizes pollinator-flower contact so as to
   reduce pollen loss during transport.}},

   self-fertilization using genetic markers and experimental manipulation
   of garden populations of Eichhornia paniculata, a self-compatible
   bee-pollinated plant.
   2. Based on the observed tendency for bees to forage upwards on
   inflorescences and a model of the relation between pollen carry-over and
   the number of flowers visited per inflorescence, we predicted that the
   frequency of self-fertilization should increase from bottom to top
   flowers and with increasing inflorescence sizes.
   3. Electrophoretic analysis of open-pollinated progeny arrays supported
   both of these predictions. The fraction of self-fertilized seeds
   increased progressively from bottom to top flowers within an
   inflorescence and there was a significant increase in the frequency of
   self-fertilization with daily inflorescence size. Inflorescences of all
   sizes exhibited equivalent increases in the frequency of

   4. The general agreement between our experimental results and model

Abstract = {{The phenological relationships between nesting behavior of a specialist,
   solitary bee, Dieunomia triangulifera, and the flowering of its primary
   pollen source, Helianthus annuus, were studied for 3 yr at a site in
   northeastern Kansas, which contained between 50 000 and > 150 000 nests.
   Activity patterns of D. triangulifera are closely synchronized with
   pollen availability on nearby sunflower plants in three ways: (1) each
   year, D. triangulifera became active within days of the beginning of the
   local sunflower bloom, and the emergence schedule of the entire
   population at the nest site was timed such that all females had
   constructed nests and were collecting pollen at peak bloom; (2) over a
   season the greatest numbers of provisioning females were active at peak
   bloom, when pollen was most abundant; and (3) over the day, females made
   mote trips, each of which took less time when pollen was most abundant
   on nearby flowers than when it was scarce. Between seasons, female
   reproductive success varied positively with the availability of H.
   annuus pollen. When pollen was abundant, and the population at the nest
   site was low, approximate to 3 times more cells were provisioned than
   the following year when the bee population was high and pollen abundance
   declined. Furthermore, 20 pollen-collecting bee species (10 specialists
   and 10 generalists), besides D. triangulifera, used an estimated 68\% of
   the available sunflower pollen at this site. These data suggest that
   resource limitation is important in shaping patterns of provisioning
   behavior in D. triangulifera. Other behaviors presumably related to
   reproductive success were variable and suggest resources were not
   limiting: (1) all females did not forage on each day, even at peak
   bloom; (2) variance in both trip durations and the numbers of trips made
   per day was large; and (3) females produced far fewer eggs in their
   lifetime than apparently possible. We suggest that the apparently
   conflicting evidence for resource limitation may be explained by a
   physiological Limit on the rate of egg production; in such a case, the
   effects of resource limitation, while clearly important, might not be
   the primary factor limiting reproductive output.
   Female D. triangulifera benefit by being synchronized with their
   resource. Daily and seasonal synchrony enable females to collect a
   greater amount of pollen during shorter foraging trips. This translates
   into higher mean reproductive success and, at the population level,
   allows more females to be supported by the pollen produced from nearby
   plants. In short, those females that are synchronized with the sunflower
   bloom effectively increase their own resource availability. This
   phenomenon may be general, especially in short-lived organisms, i.e.,
   the evolution of specialization may be associated with fitness benefits
   based on synchrony with a preferred food source.}},

   cucurbitacin bitterness whereas some sympatric free-living plants
   produced non-bitter fruits. This reversal of typical cucurbitacin
   expression suggested gene flow between crop and weed at the site.
   Isozyme analysis provided little insight as to taxa involved in gene
   exchange, although progeny from a single free-living plant carried IDH
   allozymes that are associated with Mexican landraces of C. pepo.
   Synthetic hybridization revealed that fertile F, hybrids are produced

   argyrosperma as the staminate parent. Interspecific crop/weed hybrids
   can produce viable progeny upon self-pollination or backcrossing to

Abstract = {{1. Energetic considerations of preflight warm-up in bees predict that
   bees should warm-up as fast as they can and that larger species should
   be able to warm-up more rapidly. Larger species should also be able to
   maintain higher thoracic temperatures during flight. These predictions
   are examined for 19 species in the solitary bee genus Anthopora
   (Hymenoptera; Apoidea; Anthophoridae).
   2. The genus Anthophora has uniformly high warm-up rates and body
   temperatures in flight, and the highest warm-up rates measured in any
   heterotherm.
   3. Under standard conditions, both warm-up rates and thoracic
   temperatures during flight increase with body mass in Anthophora, in
   keeping with the prediction that heterotherms should minimize the
   energetic cost of warm-up.
   4. Having controlled for body mass effects, Anthophora species able to
   maintain flight activity at lower ambient temperatures have higher
   warm-up rates and body temperatures in flight, showing that even in the
   smallest endotherms there may still be room for selective modification
   within the limits imposed by body size.
   5. Differences in warm-up rates between subgenera within Anthophora
   suggest that endothermic abilities have diverged in response to
   differences in the thermal environments which are the centres of
   diversity for the subgenera.
   6. Similar importance of both body mass and the thermal environment in
   which the species is active is demonstrated over 40 bee species in six
   families. Because species over a wide taxonomic range do not constitute
   independent data points, phylogenetic effects in these analyses are
   controlled for using Grafen's phylogenetic regression.
   7. The evolution of high levels of endothermy in Anthophora is discussed
   with reference to patterns of nectar secretion found in the arid
   environments which are current centres of diversity for the genus.}},

Abstract = {{Trap-nesting bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata) colonizing crop and
   fallow fields in an agricultural landscape were studied using 20 sown
   fields (pea, barley, rye, clover-grass mixtures, Phacelia tanacetifolia)
   and 20 fields with naturally developed vegetation (1- and 2-year old
   fields, both mown and unmown, and old meadows). Fourteen species of
   Apoidea, 4 of Sphecidae, 1 of Eumenidae and 4 of parasitoids were reared
   from reed nests exposed in these 40 fields of 10 field-types. Fields
   with naturally developed vegetation had twice as many species as sown
   fields, due to the distribution pattern of the 14 bee species, whereas
   the 9 predatory species (wasps and parasitoids) showed a rather uniform
   distribution. None of the trap-nesting bees were found in Phacelia
   fields, despite contrasting expectations of bee-keepers. Old meadows
   showed a particularly high abundance and species richness, since only
   10\% of all traps were exposed, but 32\% of all bee nests were sampled
   in old meadows, including 4 bee species that were not found elsewhere.
   Accordingly, species richness of fields with naturally developed
   vegetation showed a significant increase with age. Variability in
   Hymenoptera species numbers could be explained by corresponding
   differences in plant species numbers. The alternative hypothesis that
   field size or field connectivity influenced species richness was not
   supported. Habitats with great floral diversity appeared to offer better
   and richer food resources for the flower-visiting bees, whereas food
   availability apparently did not influence predatory wasps. The bees
   Osmia caerulescens and Megachile versicolor that had colonized
   early-successional fields took twice as long to provision cells as those
   that colonized late-successional meadows characterized by a greater
   plant species richness. In contrast, the eumenid wasp Ancistrocerus
   gazella took a similar period of time to provision cells in both field
   types. In addition, bee and wasp species of plant-species-poor fields
   were on average significantly larger than those of plant-species-rich
   fields. Thus, body size appeared to be a good predictor of colonization
   ability. Management by cutting greatly increased plant species richness
   in early-successional set-aside fields and thus doubled species richness
   of bees. Cutting of early-successional habitats can be expected to
   benefit insects and plants in general, whereas older grassland should
   show the greatest insect diversity when both mown and unmown parts are
   present.}},

   increased with increasing size of inflorescences. Visitation time
   (duration of foraging) rather than the frequency of visitations (number
   of visits) was critical for higher fecundity. Seed production was
   strongly enhanced by a few long visits (of more than 60 s), and seemed
   to be independent of large numbers of short visits (of less than 60 s).

Abstract = {{One hypothesis for the evolution of maleness in plants postulates the
   following: male plants appear that have re-allocated resources from
   female parts into a larger number of male hewers, creating a larger
   floral display. Pollinators respond `'dramatically'' to the increased
   display, driving the spread of males in the population (Bawa, K.S.,
   1980, annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 11: 15-40). To test this,
   we measured the total number of hewers and the size of male displays in
   dioecious Sagittaria latifolia and monoecious S. australis. We also
   measured how fast visitors arrived at `'target'' flowers in the
   displays. Then we used the Cox Model, a failure time analysis procedure,
   to analyze the relationship between visitor arrival and display size. We
   found that male display sizes were somewhat larger in the dioecious than
   the monoecious plants, but this was due to more compressed blooming
   rather than to a larger total number of flowers. The visitors to bath
   plants were similar arrays of generalist bees. Visitors did not show the
   predicted `'dramatic'' response, however, but rather a plateauing
   response to larger display sizes, so our results do not support the
   hypothesis. Reviewing the literature, we found no reports of the
   `'dramatic'' response the hypothesis asserts. Instead, relative
   insensitivity to display size is the rule.}},

   mass and microclimate.
   2. Activity at the nest site demonstrated relationships with aspects of
   the thermal environment experienced by A.plumipes. Measures of
   temperature showing significant relationships differed for females in
   different stages in the nesting cycle exhibiting characteristically
   different behaviour patterns.
   3. Larger females emerged from nest tunnels earlier in the morning and
   provisioned cells at lower ambient temperatures than smaller
   individuals. Body size therefore predicts reproductive success at low
   ambient temperatures.
   4. Pollen and nectar loads carried by females increased with ambient
   temperature. Because only one cell is completed per day and the size of

Abstract = {{ESS models of reproductive allocation have been used extensively to
   explain patterns of floral diversity in angiosperms. These theoretical
   explorations assume that proportional allocation to pollen, ovules, and
   seeds, as well as to secondary features such as showy petals and nectar
   rewards, can evolve independently within the limits set by total
   resource availability. In populations of California wild radish, we have
   shown previously that petal size, a strong determinant of visitation by
   honey bee pollinators, is positively correlated with both pollen and
   nectar production, but not with ovule or seed number per flower. These
   phenotypic associations may reflect selection, environmental
   correlation, and/or genetic constraint. By exerting selection on the
   petal size:pollen number ratio over two generations, we eliminated the
   positive correlation between petal size and pollen production, with both
   characters showing significant change after a single selection episode.
   Once these two floral traits became uncoupled, nectar sugar production
   was significantly correlated only with petal size. Our results suggest
   that natural selection could readily alter reproductive allocation in
   these flowers, and that the phenotypic correlations observed in nature
   may be maintained by selection for effective reproductive phenotypes.}},

   threads. When stamens were stimulated experimentally, 53\% of the total
   pollen was deposited on the first trip, and 20\% on the second,
   resulting in a pattern of diminishing proportional removal. Pollen
   removal by bees resulted in a similar pattern. However, small bees
   (e.g., Andrenids) tripped fewer stamens per visit than large bees (i.e.,
   Bombus spp.). Our results do not support either the `'numerical'' or
   `'proportional'' removal patterns of Harder and Thomson (1989) but do
   conform to the diminishing proportional removal model proposed by Harder
   (1990) for plant/pollinator associations where there is a high variance
   in the number of pollinator visits.}},

Abstract = {{A new term, agastoparasitism, is proposed for parasitism among closely
   related species. Cynipid inquilines are typical agastoparasites. They
   cannot induce galls; instead their larvae live inside the galls formed
   by other cynipids. As in many other groups of agastoparasites, there are
   two competing hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of cynipid
   inquilines: either they arose from one of their cynipid hosts, and later
   radiated to exploit other gall-inducing cynipids (monophyletic origin),
   or they arose repeatedly, each inquiline from its host (polyphyletic
   origin). These hypotheses for the origin of cynipid inquilines were
   tested by a phylogenetic analysis of representative species of cynipid
   gall inducers and inquilines based on adult morphological characters.
   The analysis supported the monophyly of the inquilines and indicated an
   origin from gall inducers related to the genus Diastrophus, one of the
   current host groups. To examine whether the result of the analysis was
   influenced by convergent similarities among inquilines because of their
   similar mode of life, all putative apomorphies shared by some or all of
   the inquilines but not occurring in any of the gall inducers were
   removed. Despite this, the phylogenetic conclusions essentially remained
   the same, that is, the support for inquiline monophyly was not caused by
   convergent evolution. Based on these results, adaptive aspects of the
   evolutionary origin and maintenance of cynipid inquilinism are
   discussed, as well as general patterns in the evolution of
   agastoparasitism.}},

   overwintered in refrigerators at 3-7-degrees-C for 112 and 167 days

   with nesting materials with holes of different diameters. Bees that had

   expressed lower over-wintering mortality than bees exposed to shorter
   over-wintering periods. Females preferred to nest in holes of 7 mm i.d.
   The nesting season lasted from 2 to 2,5 montes. 0. tricornis is a highly
   polylectic species and collected pollen mainly from flowers producing
   little or no nectar (Quercus, Cistus, Papaver, Ranunculus, etc.).

Abstract = {{When a nectar reward is relatively low in quality and quantity, is it an
   effective pollinator attractant? In Puerto Rico, Comparettia falcata, a
   hummingbird-pollinated epiphytic orchid, produces an average one-time
   secretion of 3.3-4.0 mul of nectar (composed of 12.9-15.1\% sugar) per
   flower. In contrast, nectar sugar concentrations of other hummingbird
   flowers on Caribbean islands are 17-37 percent, and those of Puerto Rico
   visited by the C. falcata pollinator have standing crops averaging
   2.0-6.2 mul and daily secretion rates of 3.1-10.6 mul. In 1989 and 1990,
   we monitored pollinator abundance, effective flower visitation,
   pollinarium removals (male success), pollinations, and fruit production
   (female success) at two sites in the Toro Negro Forest Reserve.
   Reproductive success at the two sites did not differ in either year when
   adjusted for differences in pollinator activity. In 1991, we clipped the
   spur tips of all flowers at one site rendering them nectarless.
   Visitation frequencies and measures of male and female fitness were
   adjusted for site differences in pollinator activity, and all were
   significantly lower at the site where flowers were nectarless. In 1992,
   we abandoned one site and manipulated the other by clipping the floral
   spurs of a randomly chosen subset of plants so that 25 percent of the
   flowers in the population were nectarless. Pollinarium removals from
   intact flowers were significantly different from those with cut spurs
   and total visits were nearly significant as well. However, the
   difference in female success was clearly not significant between the two
   treatments. The number of visits per flower dropped dramatically from
   previous years despite the highest level of bird activity yet censused.
   The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the pollinator,
   Chlorostilbon maugaeus, perceives the nectar reward despite its small
   quantity and low sugar content, this to the advantage of Comparettia
   flacata.}},

Abstract = {{Male euglossine bees, including Euglossa and Eulaema, collect fragrances
   from flowers and other sources and probably biochemically modify the
   fragrances and release them to attract females for mating. The
   fragrance-collecting activity follows a diel cycle that may be
   influenced by variation in the thermal environment. To ascertain the
   degree of the influence of the thermal environment on the activity of
   these tropical bees, we used Euglossa carcasses as temperature sensors
   to measure operative environmental temperatures (T(E)) of bees in forest
   openings (full sunlight) and in the forest understory (shade). We
   related activity levels of bees on fragrance baits in both locations to
   measured T(E), other environmental variables, and time of day. Shade
   T(E) had the strongest (although not significant) direct effect on
   Euglossa and Eulaema activity levels in the early morning. Operative
   temperature in the sun apparently had no direct effects on activity of
   both genera at any time of day. From mid-morning to late afternoon, only
   time of day (or an unmeasured variable correlated with it) had a
   significant effect on Euglossa activity levels; the relationship was
   positive near midday and negative in the early afternoon. Eulaema
   activity during midday could not be predicted from any measured
   variable. Eulaema activity in the late afternoon was negatively affected
   by time of day and shade T(E). From these and previous results we
   tentatively conclude that in tropical wet forests fragrance-collecting
   male euglossines may be limited by low air temperatures in the early
   morning; that neither Euglossa nor Eulaema usually thermoregulate by
   basking; that Eulaema activity may be depressed by overheating in the
   late afternoon; and that Euglossa activity drops in the late afternoon
   probably for reasons other than overheating.}},

   species of Stylidium (Stylidiaceae) at 25 sites in Western Australia.
   The number of species per study site varied between two and six.
   Stylidium species are pollinated by a variety of nectar-seeking solitary
   bees and bombyliid flies. Within and among species there is significant
   variation in nectar-tube length (and therefore in the insects that visit
   the flowers) and in pollen placement on pollinators. Pollen is placed
   `'explosively'' on the insect by a motile column of fused staminate and
   pistillate tissues; the position and reach of the column varies within
   and among species, thereby causing variation in site of pollen
   deposition. When discrete pollination niches were defined for all
   species, only one niche overlap was observed across the 86 interacting
   pairs of Stylidium species at the 25 sites. To determine whether this
   was a nonrandom assemblage structure we compared our observation with
   the outcome of null models. We developed three null models to cover the
   most likely structuring processes: that communities are organized by (1)
   ecological sorting, (2) evolution of plant phenotypes, or (3) both
   processes. We concluded that it was unlikely (P = .055-.002) that so few
   overlaps in pollination niches would occur by chance. We developed
   another null model to test whether chance could have created the
   apparent pattern of character displacement in pollination niches
   exhibited by the nine species showing intraspecific variation. The

Abstract = {{In a fragmented, dry subtropical forest in northwestern Argentina, we
   compared pollination levels, fruit set, and seed set among small (<1 ha)
   forest fragments, large (>2 ha) fragments, and continuous forest in 16
   plant species representing a wide range of pollination systems, breeding
   systems, and growth forms. For three species, Prosopis nigra
   (Mimosoideae), Cercidium australe (Caesalpinoideae), and Atamisquea
   emarginata (Capparaceae), the three treatments were replicated across
   four sites; we achieved less replication for other species. Because
   comparisons between forest and fragment populations for different
   species took place in different sites, however, by treating all 16
   species as a unit we lessened the potential bias of confounding site
   effects and could evaluate the overall impact of fragmentation.
   Significant or marginal (P < .10) fragmentation-related declines in
   number of pollen tubes per style, fruit set, and seed set occurred in 9
   of 16, 5 of 15, and 3 of 14 species, respectively. Overall, significant
   or nonsignificant declines occurred in 81\%(pollen tubes), 73\% (fruit
   set), and 79\% (seed set) of the species. In all cases these proportions
   were greater (P less than or equal to.06) than the null binomial
   expectation of a 1:1 ratio of increases to decreases. Breeding system
   did not explain sensitivity to fragmentation: the magnitudes of declines
   in pollen tubes, fruit set, and seed set were virtually
   indistinguishable between self-compatible and self-incompatible species.
   At least 4 of the 10 self-incompatible species, however, were heavily
   visited in small fragments by Africanized honey bees, which may have
   compensated for a decline in visits by native pollinators.
   The exact nature of responses varied among plant species. In some, the
   absolute quantity of pollen grains transferred to stigmas decreased with
   fragmentation, and sometimes this was reflected in reduced fruit or seed
   set. In Cercidium, Prosopis, and Atamisquea, the quality of the grains
   transferred apparently changed: number of pollen tubes produced per
   pollen grain on the stigma declined with increasing fragmentation, and
   at least in the latter two species seed production declined as well.
   Overall, levels of pollination and seed production undoubtedly
   integrated many idiosyncratic effects of fragmentation on particular
   plant and animal populations, and indicated that `'community health'' of
   fragments suffered in comparison with that of continuous forest. Median
   decreases in pollination levels and seed output from forest to fragments
   approached 20\%. The impact of these declines on plant recruitment is
   less clear, however, because cattle grazing and trampling of seedlings
   and saplings in fragments may constitute a much more serious short-term
   conservation problem.}},

Abstract = {{We studied bumblebees (Bombus wurflenii and B. sichelii) that were
   collecting pollen from the flowers of Campanula rotundifolia in an

   individual plants. while pollen and nectar availability varied among the
   flowers in association with their sexual phase. Compared to random
   samples, bumblebees significantly favoured female phase flowers on one
   day. but favoured male phase flowers on the following day and this
   change coincided with a decline in overall pollen availability. The
   bumblebees' behaviour is consistent with a simple economic
   interpretation: initially. bumblebees favoured female phase flowers,
   many of which offered both pollen and nectar, but as pollen became less
   abundant, bumblebees increasingly favoured the relatively pollen-rich.

Abstract = {{The bumble bee, Bombus impatiens Cr., was evaluated for its
   effectiveness as a pollinator of greenhouse sweet pepper, Capsicum
   annuum L. (cultivars `Cubico' and `Plutona'). Four pollination trials
   lasting 2-5 weeks were conducted in three greenhouses from mid-March to
   the end of August 1991. Bees were introduced once a week for 24 h into
   each greenhouse. At the same time, a pollination cage was placed over a
   block of plants in each greenhouse to establish a control (no bees). For
   `Plutona', the effect of bumble bees as pollinators was significant
   (P<0.05) for fruit weight, fruit width, fruit volume, pericarp volume,
   seed weight and days from fruit set to harvest. Bee pollination also
   improved fruit grade, resulting in a greater percentage of extra-large
   and large fruit, and fruit with four locules. For `Cubico', pollination
   by bumble bees significantly (P<0.05) reduced the number of days from
   fruit set to harvest and increased the percentage of extra-large and

   increase the profitability for both cultivars.}},

   their natal straws; bees of orchard B were released by inserting
   individual cocoons in new straws; bees of orchard C were mass-released

Abstract = {{Dalechampia contains over 120 species arid occurs throughout the lowland

   and the New World secrete terpenoid resin from large glandlike
   aggregations of bractlets in the pseudanthial inflorescences (blossorns)
   and are pollinated by bees that collect resin for use in nest
   construction. Using comparative chemical, morphological, and ecological
   data and phylogenetic analyses, I attempt to ascertain the early
   evolutionary and biogeographic events that led to the present
   distribution of species, character states, and pollinatioii systems
   throughout the tropics. Available evidence suggests the genus originated
   in western Gondwana or South America in the iiiid Cretaceous or early
   Tertiary, respectively, and spread throughout the tropics by the rafting
   of land masses, or by migration across higher latitudes when they bad
   subtropical climates, or both. There is some evidence for two
   migrational events between the Old and New Worlds. The original
   pollination system may have involved pollination by pollen-collecting
   insects or bv fragrance-collecting male euglossine bees, The origin of
   pollination by resin-collecting bees appears to have been a consequence
   of a preadaptation (exaptation): the earliest Dalechampia apparently
   used triterpene resins to defend flower parts against attack by
   herbivores and/or microbes, and resiri secondarily assumed the role of
   pollinator reward. The mutualistic relationship with resin-collecting
   bees may have originated independently in the Old and New Worlds.}},

   explanation (proposed by Darwin) is that flower handling methods learned
   on one plant species interfere with previously learned handling methods
   of other plant species. Darwin's hypothesis was tested by measuring the
   constancy of bumble bees (Bombus fervidus) foraging in the field and
   looking for evidence of interference (increased handling times and
   flower handling errors) when bees switched among four species with
   relatively simple flowers (Prunella vulgaris, Trifolium pratense, T.
   hybridum, and Vicia cracca) and two species with more complex flowers
   (Aconitum napellus and Impatiens capensis). Bees foraging on simple
   flowers showed no tendency towards flower constancy, and switching
   between species did not increase handling times or handling errors.
   Foragers displayed strong constancy when visiting the species with more
   complex flowers and there was also some evidence of increased handling
   times and error frequencies following switches. However, the time costs
   of switching were small (about 1 s over the first flower visit after a

   of 12 (52.2\%) fully self-compatible and 5 (21.7\%) partially
   self-compatible species. An analysis of sexual systems and temporal
   variation of sex expression showed that of 29 monocot species, 14 (48.3
   \%) were hermaphrodite and adichogamous, 14 (48.3\%) monoecious and
   dichogamous, and one (3.4\%) dioecious. The combination of monoecy and
   dichogamy prevented autogamy in 11 (91.7\%) of the 12 self-compatible
   and monoecious species; one (8.3\%) was autogamous. Of all species, 24
   (82.8\%) were obligate outbreeders, 2 (6.9\%) spontaneously autogamous,

   significantly different between the different groups. Pollen-ovule ratio
   was significantly different between monoecious and hermaphrodite
   species. The number of pollen grains and ovules per flower and the
   pollen-ovule ratio were variable among various pollination types. The
   average pollen-ovule ratio was higher in beetle-, dipteran-, and
   wind-pollinated species than in bee-, bird-, and bat-pollinated species.
   The first three pollination types were restricted to monoecious species,

   sp., Amegilla anomola, and Xylocopa near gressitti consistently
   contacted the stigma during foraging. When sunny weather prevails
   natural fruit set in M. affine reaches 90 percent, reflecting high
   visitation and subsequent pollination by such pollinators. The dimorphic
   stamens of M. affine both contain viable pollen which has to be
   extracted from an apical pore. Two modes of pollen extraction were
   common: buzz pollen collection, where pollen is vibrated from anthers;
   and, anther destruction, where pollen is removed from holes made by
   bees. Pollen collectors that buzz anthers spend less time at flowers
   than bees that extract pollen by other means. Furthermore, bees that
   gather pollen via destructive means rarely touch melastome stigmas.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous 15 month study of the floral ecology of four syntopic
   understorey palm species of Genoma was conducted in Amazonian Peru
   lowland rainforest.
   The spicate inflorescences of G. macrostachys, G. acaulis and G.
   gracilis are strictly protand-rous and the plants are functionally
   dioecious. Data suggest that in G. macrostachys and G. acaulis
   pollination is based on a mimicry system, the pistillate flowers
   mimicking the staminate ones in colour, shape and scent.
   Pollen-collecting meliponine bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponinae) and
   pollen-feeding syrphid flies (Diptera, Syrphidae) which visit
   inflorescences during both sexual stages are the pollinators of G.
   macrostachys. Geonoma acaulis is pollinated by small pollen-feeding
   weevils (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Derelomini) that visit male and
   female spikes.
   Additionally, in G. macrostachys another pollinator type, viz.
   euglossine bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossinae), which are attracted
   and rewarded by both types of flowers may account for long-distance
   pollination.
   The palm G. gracilis shows a very distinct pollination system. Although
   opportunistic insect visitors are attracted to the inflorescences of
   this species it seems to be mainly anemophilous because pollen becomes
   powdery during anthesis.
   The branched inflorescences of G. interrupta of Geonoma observed,
   staminate and pistillate anthesis of individual flowers are, for the
   most, overlapping. A broad spectrum of visitors is attracted (bees,
   wasps, flies, and beetles), which all may act as pollinators.
   Outcrossing is especially encouraged during the purely female phase at
   the end of the flowering cycle when there are no more staminate flowers
   in the inflorescence.
   Effects on the reproductive biology and population structure of
   different pollination systems and breeding system are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The bee guild represents direct primary costs of angiosperm
   reproduction. Tropical flower visitors take an amount comparable to
   herbivores, exceeding 3\% of net primary production energy. Therefore
   herbivory and aboveground net primary production have been
   underestimated. Comparing pollinators to other herbivores, harvest in
   mature forest by tropical bees is greater than leafcutter ants, game
   animals, frugivores, vertebrate folivores, insect defoliators excluding
   ants, flower-feeding birds and bats, but not soil organisms. The ratio
   of total aboveground net primary production to investment in pollen,
   nectar and resin used by pollinators suggests wind pollination is
   several times more efficient in temperate forests than is animal
   pollination in neotropical moist forest. Animal pollination may, be
   favour;ed by habitat mosaics and an unpredictable or sparse dispersion
   of conspecifics-consequences of fluctuating abiotic and biotic
   environments. Natural selection evidently favours diminished direct
   reproductive costs in forests, for example by wind pollination,
   regardless of latitude and disturbance regime. An example is `'wind
   pollination by proxy'' of dominant trees in seasonal southeast Asian
   forests. They flower only occasionally and their pollen is dispersed by
   tiny winged insects that are primarily carried by the wind-rather than
   the nectar-hungry bees, bats, birds and moths used by most tropical
   nora. Increasing evapotranspiration is associated with greater net
   primary production; I show its correlation with species richness of
   social tropical bees across the isthmus of Panama, which may indicate
   increasing forest reproductive effort devoted to flowering, and its
   monopolization by unspecialized newer visitors in wetter and less

   natural seed set increased with patch size. Thus, a pollinator may, on
   average, deposit more Viscaria pollen per flower visit in large patches
   than in small patches.
   Fruit set, i.e. the proportion of flowers setting fruits, was higher
   during wet years than during dry years and differed with plant size in
   four out of five years, suggesting resource limitation. Fruit set
   therefore is not a reliable measurement of pollination effectiveness in
   this species.
   Seed-feeding insect larvae were more abundant in large patches and
   consumed more than 60\% of seed capsules in the largest patches.
   We conclude that Viscaria plants in large patches produce more seeds but
   also suffer increased risk of being attacked by seed-eating insects or
   infected by disease.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate pollen dispersal in Brassica
   napus (oilseed rape). The selectable marker, used to follow pollen
   movement, was a dominant transgene (bar) conferring resistance to the
   herbicide glufosinate-ammonium. Transgenic and non-transgenic plants of
   the cultivar Westar were planted in a 1.1 ha field trial, with the
   transgenic plants in a 9 m diameter circle at the centre, surrounded by
   non-transgenic plants to a distance of at least 47 m in all directions.
   A 1 m circle of non-transgenic plants was sown in the centre of the
   transgenic area to allow estimation of the level of pollen dispersal
   when plants were in close contact. Honeybee hives were placed at the
   trial site to optimize the opportunity for cross-pollination. During the
   flowering period, regular observations were made of the number of plants
   flowering and the number and type of insects present in 60 1 m(2) areas.
   These areas were located uniformly around the plot at distances of 1, 3,
   6, 12, 24, 36 and 47 m from the edge of the 9 m circle of transgenic
   plants. Seed samples were harvested from each of the 7 distances so that
   approximately 20\% of the circumference of the plot was sampled at each
   distance. The centre non-transgenic circle was also sampled. Plants were
   grown from the seed samples and sprayed with glufosinate to estimate the
   frequency of pollen dispersal at each distance. In order to screen
   enough samples to detect low frequency cross-pollination events, seed
   samples were tested in the greenhouse and on a larger scale in the
   field. Results were confirmed by testing progeny for glufosinate
   resistance and by Southern blot analysis. The estimated percentage of
   pollen dispersal in the non-transgenic centre circle was 4.8\%. The
   frequency was estimated to be 1.5\% at a distance of 1 m and 0.4\% at 3
   m. The frequency decreased sharply to 0.02\% at 12 m and was only
   0.00033\% at 47 m. No obvious directional effects were detected that
   could be ascribed to wind or insect activity.}},

Abstract = {{The results of pollination and mating-system studies were integrated
   with a phylogenetic study of 40 Neotropical species of Dalechampia L.
   (Euphorbiaceae) to reconstruct the history of evolutionary change in
   pollination systems. The results of this analysis were treated as a
   hypothesis and tested for circularity problems and robustness in the
   face of changes in the data set. The historical hypothesis was used to
   make specific predictions about details of pollination ecology and
   reward biochemistry; the predictions were supported by independent
   observations. I conclude that pollination systems in Dalechampia have
   been evolutionarily labile, relative to most morphological features,
   with repeated parallelisms and reversals. Transitions among the three
   pollination systems evolved by Dalechampia (pollination by
   resin-collecting bees, fragrance-collecting male euglossine bees, and
   pollen-collecting bees) have been facilitated by biochemical exaptation
   (preadaptation). Pollination by male euglossine bees is relatively rare
   in the genus but has originated independently three to four times. In
   contrast, pollination by resin-collecting female bees is very common,
   but has originated only once. Eighty-six to 97\% of transitions between
   pollination systems involved an intermediate phase during which both old
   and new pollinators were effective, but 3 to 14\% of transitions may
   have been `'instantaneous,'' lacking the intermediate phase. Clades of
   species secreting resin rewards are about 10 times as species rich as
   clades of species secreting fragrance rewards; circumstantial evidence
   suggests that different extinction rates may be responsible for this
   difference. Relatively allogamous (cross-pollinating) species have
   evolved from more autogamous (self-pollinating) species up to 13 times,
   and autogamous species have evolved from more allogamous ones up to 11
   times. Species occurring in disturbed habitats are facultatively
   autogamous, whereas species of undisturbed habitats are often highly
   allogamous.}},

Abstract = {{Dioecy is frequent in tropical forests, It has been suggested that
   small, unspecialized pollinators are among the factors responsible for
   gender separation in this habitat. The underlying assumption is that
   poor fliers and/or communal foragers frequently effect selfing which in
   turn, given sufficiently severe inbreeding depression, should favor the
   establishment of dioecy. At least 10\% of the genera of the angiosperms
   includes dioecious species; in tropical flowering plants, however,
   pollinators are reliably known only in a few species. Whereas temperate
   dioecious species commonly are wind- or water-pollinated, anemophily is
   less important in tropical forests, but occurs in at least 30 dioecious
   genera. Our survey of tropical dioecious zoophilous species in 29 genera
   (in 21 families) for which detailed pollination information is available
   shows that these species have specialized flowers adapted to specific
   pollinators rather than generalized flowers suitable for diverse
   insects. Known pollinators include solitary and eusocial bees, beetles,
   moths, flies, wasps (including fig wasps), and rarely bats and birds,
   and cover a wide range in animal size and locomotive capabilities.
   Floral rewards comprise pollen, nectar, stylar mucilage, nutritious
   tissues, brood-places, and resins. About a third of the species offer no
   reward in the female morph, pollination by deceit apparently being
   common. Our data thus do not support the hypothesis that there is a
   broad correlation between a dioecious breeding system and unspecialized
   pollination, although such a correlation may be found in certain taxa.
   Specialized plant-pollinator relationships seem as critical in dioecious
   plants in tropical forests, where individuals often grow far apart, as
   they are in tropical plants with other breeding systems.}},

Abstract = {{Solitary bees are known to be important pollinators of seasonal dry
   forest plants in Costa Rica. Recent assessments of the genus Centris
   (family Anthophoridae) and other solitary bee taxa indicate that
   populations of these bees have declined by 85-90 percent in this forest
   over the past 20 yr. Deforestation, wildfires, and conversion of forest
   land to agriculture are the main reasons for the decline.
   From 1987 to 1991 we studied the preferred nesting habitats of seven
   Centris species that specialize in making their nests in preexisting
   holes in dead trees. Special wooden sampling units, with preexisting
   standardized holes, were systematically placed in several habitat types
   in the Lomas Barbudal Biological Reserve, Guanacaste Province. Female
   bees encountered the holes as they searched for natural holes for
   nesting. Systematic monitoring of the units over five years, 1987 to
   1991, provided a quantitative measure of habitat preference and changes
   in bee frequency through time. There were sufficient data for
   statistical analysis of three of the seven species (Centris nitida, C.
   bicornuta and C. analis).
   The dosed oak forest was the predominantly preferred habitat for the
   three common Centris species, and this pattern remained constant through
   time. At least one species (C nitida) apparently had less strict habitat
   requirements as it was commonly found nesting in a wide variety of
   habitat types. Significant increases and decreases in frequencies for
   individual species through time were recorded; however, there was no
   significant change in overall bee numbers through time.
   Results of the analysis, together with a qualitative assessment of the
   rare Centris species, suggest that the dry forest is actually a mosaic
   of preferred nesting sites, with each species having specific
   preferences. This pattern is consistent with other Centris species that
   have been studied in Costa Rica. The preference for oak forests is
   significant and suggests that more of this type of habitat should be
   conserved for Centris refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination biology of the saprophytic species Petrosavia sakuraii was

   of the inner stamens after two days. The stigmata on the semicarpous
   (nearly apocarpous) pistil, which are already receptive when the flower
   opens, are situated in the center of the flower and move gradually
   outwards to touch the anthers of outer stamens about five days after
   anthesis. The breeding experiments show that the stigmata are receptive
   at least for five days, and many seeds are produced through autonomous
   self-pollination. That means the nearly apocarpous pistil, which is in a
   primitive condition, is adapted to the autonomous self-pollination. The

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in a phryganic (East Mediterranean) ecosystem
   at Daphni, near Athens, Greece. The Labiatae, represented by ten species
   belonging to nine genera, dominate in this ecosystem type. They flower
   from February to July. Both flowering time and nectar quantity are
   related to the species ability to tolerate intense water stress.
   Labiatae are visited by 201 insect species. Of these, 43 are exclusively
   supported by the family and 37 are monotropous. Solitary bees (mainly
   Anthophoridae, Megachilidae, Halictidae) constitute 47.3\% of
   pollinators. The family is important in hosting specialized bees (15
   species) in phrygana, particularly late in the flowering season.
   Labiatae species form two equally represented groups in this system;
   namely, the late winter-early spring (early) flowering, visited by
   relatively few pollinator species, and the late spring-summer (late)
   flowering species, visited by numerous pollinators. This temporal
   distinction is accompanied by different pollination profiles that
   include duration of anthesis, reward to pollinators, floral
   attractiveness, and flower character differentiation. All of these
   attributes are maximized in the early flowering period. This strategy
   suggests a mechanism for resource partitioning at a time when the
   pollinator resource is limited and competition for the services of

   possible evolution of buzz-pollination within the group. The large

   tetrads in Moneses and Pyrola, or polyads in Chimaphila. Pollen is the
   sole reward to visiting insects except in the nectar-producing O.
   secunda and C. umbellata. Correlations are present between several
   sexual traits. Pollen: ovule ratios are very low, indicating efficient
   pollen transfer. Use of polyads may reduce the number of siring males.
   This trend may be counteracted by larger stigmas as in C umbellata.
   Increasing pollen unit size may enhance relatedness of seeds, reduce
   abortion, and improve seed set. This may explain the evolution, within
   the Pyrolaceae and other families, of higher ovule numbers with larger
   pollen units. The plants are mainly pollinated by bumblebees. Chimaphila
   umbellata is visited by nectar-collectors; Moneses uniflora, Pyrola
   minor, P. rotundifolia, and P. chlorantha are visited exclusively by
   pollen-buzzers; and Orthilia secunda is visited by both

   be an ancient attractant in the group with C. umbellata having the least

Abstract = {{1. Carpenter bees (Xylocopa californica arizonensis) in west Texas,
   U.S.A., gather pollen and `rob' nectar from flowers of ocotillo
   (Fouquieria splendens). When common, carpenter bees are an effective
   pollen vector for ocotillo. We examined ocotillo's importance as a food
   source for carpenter bees.
   2. The visitation rate of carpenter bees to ocotillo flowers in 1988
   averaged 0.51 visits/flower/h and was 4 times greater than that of queen
   bumble bees (Bombus pennsylvanicus sonorus), the next most common
   visitor. Nectar was harvested thoroughly and pollen was removed from the
   majority of flowers. Hummingbird visits were rare.
   3. Pollen grains from larval food provisions were identified from
   sixteen carpenter bee nests. On average, 53\% of pollen grains sampled
   were ocotillo, 39\% were mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and 8\% were
   Zygophyllaceae (Larrea tridentata or Guaiacum angustifolium). Carpenter
   bee brood size averaged 5.8 per nest.
   4. We measured the number of flowers, and production of pollen and
   nectar per flower by mature ocotillo plants, as well as the quantity of
   pollen and sugar in larval provisions. An average plant produced enough
   pollen and nectar sugar to support the growth of eight to thirteen bee
   larvae. Ocotillo thus has the potential to contribute significantly to
   population growth of one of its key pollinators.
   5. Although this carpenter bee species, like others, is a nectar
   parasite of many plant species, it appears to be engaged in a strong
   mutualism with a plant that serves as both a pollen and as a nectar
   source during carpenter bee breeding periods.}},

   altitude in Papua New Guinea. All four species are capable of
   endothermic preflight warm-up; three species give slopes of thoracic
   temperature on ambient temperature of significantly less than 1,
   indicating regulation of thoracic temperature. In the kleptoparasitic
   Coelioxys spp. (Megachilidae) and Thyreus quadrimaculatus

   low by comparison with the two provisioning species Creightonella

   sapiens, body mass increases with altitude; this can be interpreted as a
   response to lower ambient temperatures at higher altitude, an example of
   Bergmann's rule. In both A. sapiens and C. frontalis populations at
   higher altitude have higher thoracic temperatures independent of
   differences of body mass, suggestive of additional morphological or
   physiological adaptation to lower ambient temperatures. In A. sapiens
   there is no qualitative difference in body temperatures between males
   and females after controlling for body mass, while male C. frontalis
   have significantly lower thoracic temperatures than females of the

   social nests of B. mixta in northwestern India. Direct intranest
   observations revealed that female B. kaliago may functionally replace
   host queens, much as do Psithyrus in Bombus nests. Parasites usually
   avoided encounters with hosts by freezing behavior and by quietly
   resting near the brood. Dominance was sometimes asserted by means of
   oophagy, and by several specialized agonistic behaviors which were
   enhanced by structural modifcations. Established females became unable
   to fly effectively, and if pushed out of nests by hosts, they could not
   return. One parasite evidently was killed by hosts. Parasites relied on
   host food stores deposited on nest walls or on larvae, and they also
   aggressively solicited food by trophallaxis from hosts. Both hosts and
   parasites groomed their brood. They removed and ate chorions during
   hatching, a behavior unknown in other oviparous animals. Larvae were fed
   by the ventral deposition of provisions by both hosts and parasites.
   Adult-larval trophallaxis by both species was also seen. This is unknown
   among other bees. Braunsapis kaliago retains most brood-rearing
   behaviors but has lost the abilities to construct nests and to forage.
   51 behaviors of male and female B. kaliaga are described and compared
   with those of B. mixta. These nonforaging parasites may reduce

   floral fragments, and fruits are not identical to any modem genus of
   Ericales. The inverted U-shaped anthers with pseudoterminal awns, and
   the fluted syncarpous ovary of the fossils suggest affinities with basal
   Ericaceae, probably near extant Enkianthus, a taxon that also shares
   monadinous pollen with the fossil. Pollen grains were observed clumped
   on a stigma in one of the fossil flowers. Fossilized acid-resistant
   strands having characteristics, including similar diameter and sculpture
   pattern, in common with the muri connect pollen grains and, with
   scanning electron microscopy, appear continuous with the tectum,
   supporting the interpretation that they are viscin threads. These are
   the oldest reported fossilized viscin threads, and the only fossilized
   viscin threads found in situ in flowers. In modem Ericales and
   Onagraceae, the presence of viscin threads is associated with highly
   specific plant-pollinator relationships, raising the possibility that
   such specific pollinator-plant relationships had developed by the
   mid-Cretaceous. This is consistent with floral characters in these

   protogynous; female phase and male phase took 6.8 +/- SD 5.8 days and
   16.7 +/- 5.7 days, respectively, with a short transitional phase of
   bisexuality (2.1 +/- 0.9 days). The spadices produced heat 24 hours/day
   throughout female and bisexual phases, but temperature dropped quickly
   after the beginning of male phase. Although self-compatibility was
   expected from the flower structure, the basipetal flowering, and the
   absence of effective pollinators, bagging tests demonstrated that they
   rarely produce seeds without crossing. The spadices were visited by
   small numbers of invertebrates throughout the flowering season. Of these
   invertebrates, house flies, rove beetles, and mosquitos were the
   likeliest pollinators, since they are probably attracted both to the
   pollen produced in male phase and to the stench or carbon dioxide in
   female phase. On two female spadices with immature male flowers, we
   fortuitously collected a rove beetle and a mosquito that carried some
   pollen grains; these had to have been transported from other S.
   renifolius spadices. This infrequent and ineffective pollination appears

Abstract = {{Stamens produce male gametophytes and expose them to the pollination
   process, so that stamen characteristics should reflect selection on male
   function. For animal-pollinated plants, restricting removal in favor of
   using all available pollinators should generally promote pollen
   dispersal, so that staminal characteristics should limit pollen removal
   by individual pollinators. Here we describe the influences of anther
   position on pollen removal from Pontederia cordata, a tristylous plant
   with anthers at three distinct positions: exserted from the flower
   (long-level anthers), at the mouth of the flaring tubular perianth
   (mid-level anthers), and near the perianth base (short-level anthers).
   To measure pollen removal, we presented unvisited flowers to freely
   foraging bees and counted the number of pollen grains left in flowers
   after 1-4 visits. The pollinators included two generalist bumble bees
   (Bombus impatiens and B. vagans: Apidae) and Melissodes apicata
   (Anthophoridae), a specialist with morphological and behavioral
   adaptations for collecting pollen from P. cordata. Analysis of pollen
   removal incorporated the effects of bee species, anther position, pollen
   size, flower length, and the number and cumulative duration of bee
   visits.
   Anther position and bee species significantly influenced pollen removal,
   although the differences between bee species were not related to
   pollinator specialization. Long-level anthers dehisced early, lost an
   average of 39\% of their pollen during their first visit, and did not
   consistently contact small pollinators, such as M. apicata. Short-level
   anthers restricted pollen removal more (28\% lost) than long-level
   anthers, but dehisced more slowly and were subject to unpredictable
   pollen removal. Mid-level anthers combine the advantages of more
   exserted and inserted positions without suffering the corresponding
   disadvantages as they restricted removal (24\% lost), dehisced
   relatively early, and seemed to consistently contact all pollinators.
   The overall benefits of positioning anthers within the perianth mouth,
   the position occupied by mid-level anthers in P. cordata, may explain
   the prevalence of this morphology among bee-pollinated plants with
   flaring, tubular, monomorphic flowers.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of the circumpolar seashore plant Lathyrus
   japonicus WILLD. was studied in two populations in Denmark, 1991-1992,
   and in one population in northern Norway, 1991. The studied plant
   characters were flower fragrance, flower colour, nectar production,
   pollen, flower phenology, and pollen/ovule-ratio. The flowers smell
   faintly and aromatically and absorb UV light with the entire surface;
   within the blue waveband there are nectar guides. The flowers are purple
   and change colour to violet before wilting but nectar volumes remain
   largely unchanged. Each flower was open for 2-3 days in 1992 and for at
   least 6 days in 1991, the difference being due to draught in 1992. The
   ten stamens released all together 40,000-50,000 pollen grains which were
   deposited in the stylar brush and accumulated in the keel before the
   sigma became receptive. In spite of this protandry, the flowers are
   functionally homogamous because viable pollen is present at the time the
   stigma is receptive, which is only after rupture of the cuticle of the
   stigmatic papillae by, e.g., a bee. The average pollen/ovule-ratio was
   6,384, assigning the flower to xenogamy according to the classification
   proposed by CRUDEN (1977).
   Lathyrus japonicus is pollinated by several species of bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.) and one species of mason bee (Osmia sp.), a pollinator
   guild similar to that of many other species in the genus. The pollinator
   guilds of the two subspecies of L. japonicus (subsp. japonicus and
   subsp. maritimus (L.) P. W. B ALL) were largely similar. Bombus
   pascuorum, the most important pollinator, flew longer distances between
   inflorescences than predicted from the nearest-neighbour-distances
   between inflorescences. Bombus pascuorum also visited just one flower
   per inflorescence more often than inferred from the number of flowers
   open in an inflorescence. On sunny days with no rain, each flower was
   visited by bumblebees on average 7 times per day, indicating abundant

Abstract = {{The movement patterns of flower-visiting Cetonia (Coleoptera,
   Scarabaeidae) were studied in central Sweden over 4 years, providing the
   first quantitative study of beetle pollination behaviour conducted in a
   temperate zone. The beetles were marked individually and tracked
   throughout their visits to Viburnum opulus L. (Caprifoliaceae), a partly
   beetle-pollinated shrub displaying large umbel-like, creamy-white
   blossoms. Beetle abundance differed greatly between study years. Of
   marked beetles observed on V. opulus flowers, an average of 26\%
   returned each year. The beetles performed frequent inter-plant flights,
   and showed fidelity to particular V. opulus individuals at the study
   site. Furthermore, they preferred V. opulus to other plants flowering
   concomitantly and showed considerable constancy in this habit. Movements
   were mostly between individuals from unshaded locations with high
   inflorescence and flower number. Normally, the beetles flew on average
   about 4 times the horizontal nearest-neighbour distance between
   flowering V. opulus (c. 18 m). From these observations it is concluded
   that Cetonia beetles are powerful long-distance dispersal agents for V.
   opulus pollen, perhaps leading to an enhanced gene flow not possible
   with the plant's other pollinators.}},

   A bagging experiment demonstrated that pollinators were required for
   effective pollination. In 1984-1985 and 1990-1991, more than 90\% of the
   flowers set fruit, indicating that pollinator visitation (primarily by
   bumblebees) did not limit fruit set. Fruit set was unusually low in 1988
   (37\%), perhaps due to effects of drought stress on the plants and/or
   their pollinators. Levels of fruit damage from insect larvae ranged from
   >90\% in 1984-1985 to a low of 37\% in 1990. Seed predators consumed the
   small, winged seeds and also prevented normal fruit development. Uneaten
   seeds within damaged fruits often appeared moldy, and dispersal by wind
   was unlikely. These results suggest that seed predators had a greater

Abstract = {{In interior and arctic Alaska, Hedysarum boreale and H. alpinum
   (Fabaceae) occur sympatrically, bloom nearly synchronously, have similar
   floral morphology and color, and require pollination by insects to set
   seed. I studied the pollination ecology of these species at a site where
   they occur sympatrically near Fairbanks, Alaska, to determine if
   pollination interactions play a role in maintaining overlapping blooming
   times. Seed set in each species was apparently neither enhanced nor
   reduced by the presence of the other species. Seed set of H. boreale was
   positively related to visitation rates by female Megachile giliae, the
   most abundant visitor to H. boreale. This bee showed no preference
   between the two Hedysarum species. However, worker Bombus flavifrons,
   the most abundant visitor to H. alpinum, preferred to forage on H.
   alpinum. The exhibition of strong floral constancy by visitors to the
   two Hedysarum species suggests that interspecific pollination may not be
   strong enough to cause divergence in blooming times. I found no evidence
   that the presence of one Hedysarum species enhances visitation to the
   other species. Instead, because visitation by worker B. flavifrons to H.
   alpinum was reduced on sympatric plots, H. alpinum may have to tolerate
   overlap with H. boreale to take advantage of worker B. flavifrons
   activity. The results of this study suggest that the two Hedysarum

   cages with bumble bees contained 2 queens each, and the experimental
   design was a randomized complete block with 3 replications, 6
   pollination treatments and 2 lines per treatment. Data were recorded on
   reproductive organs (flowers and pods) by node, on abortion rates, pod

   The self-fertile line was not affected by the various conditions of

   susceptible to treatments and to the different species of bumble bees.
   Under self pollination, the low self-fertile line produced significantly
   less pods than with insects.  On the contrary self-fertility enabled
   line D-27 to produce as many seeds under self-pollination as with bumble
   bees. Despite its higher abortion rate, the self-fertile line D-27 had a
   greater productivity than that of D-23 for practically all the

   need of pollinating insects to significantly increase its pod setting
   and seed yield. The fact that the yield from the self-fertile line was
   completely independent of insect activity indicates that self fertility
   was an effective means of making faba bean yield more consistent and

   Its breeding system is highly self-incompatible, with an index of
   Self-Incompatibility of 0 - 0.1. The site of arrest of self-incompatible
   tubes is near the micropyle. In wild populations the natural seed set
   varies between 9 and 13\%. Pollination is not a factor limiting seed set
   in these flowers since every stigma examined from wild populations
   carried some germinated pollen grains. The low level of seed production
   is because most pollinations are probably ineffective selfs which occur
   when pollen exudes from pores in the anthers directly over the stigma;
   air currents and rain splashing probably accentuate the effect.
   Self-pollination is facilitated by the long period of stigma receptivity
   which occurs for 12 days commencing 2 days after anthesis. Each flower
   contains approximately 60 000 pollen grains that are viable for up to 15
   days. The pollen-ovule ratio is high, up to 32 000. Most pollen is shed
   3 days after anthesis, but this depends on temperature, relative
   humidity and probably the water potential of flowers. The flowers are
   visited by few flying insects during most of the flowering season. In
   warm weather near the end of flowering a wide range of insects visit the
   flowers. Although the visitors are mostly small flies these are
   ineffective pollinators. The main potential pollinators are medium sized

Abstract = {{A study of insect pollination of macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia
   Maiden \& Betche (Proteaceae) was undertaken in southern Queensland.
   Both initial nut set and final nut set increased with increasing insect
   visitation. Pollination was not limiting yield at this site, however, as
   racemes exposed to 6 h of bee visitation per day had similar final nut
   set to racemes constantly exposed (10 h of bee visitation). Honey bees
   and Trigona spp. bees visited the racemes in approximately equal numbers
   at the site. Approximately 50 bee visits were made per day to the
   racemes exposed for 6 h. Individual flowers remained attractive to
   insects for approximately 3 days. Hence approximately 150 visits per
   raceme are required to ensure adequate pollination. The flowers on a
   raceme opened over a period of approximately 7 days with peak opening at
   around day 2. Flowers opened during the day, peaking in the early
   afternoon.}},

Abstract = {{Exocrine secretions of insects generally fall into two categories;
   defensive secretions and semiochemicals-both can be utilized as
   character states for chemosystematic analysis. The use of each, however,
   is limited by different constraints.
   Defensive secretions should be relatively noxious, but need not be
   species specific. Their chemical nature is therefore not subjected to
   selective pressure to diversify. Any changes in their chemistry may thus
   be the consequence of speciation, provided they remain pungent. As such
   they are useful character states for chemosystematic analysis, with one
   precaution: being the end products of long biosynthetic pathways,
   co-occurrence of certain defensive compounds in two species does not
   necessarily reflect homologous biosynthetic pathways.
   Semiochemicals, on the other hand, are subjected to continuous selective
   pressures to diversify. As they have to be species specific, and often
   must also exhibit individual compositions, strong selective pressures
   for creating new chemical combinations thus exist. Furthermore, any
   changes in the chemical composition of the pheromone may result in the
   formation of a behavioral barrier, leading to a quick fixation within
   the population. The selection for chemical diversity is accentuated in
   closely related sympatric species. This may result in two sympatric
   species that might be phylogenetically related, but exhibit disparate
   secretionary compositions, while their more distant relative, being
   allopatric, retains the ancestral composition.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out, during three years (1986-8), on a
   population of Asphodelus aestivus Brot. (Liliaceae) in a semi-arid
   environment, to test whether seed production of plants was limited by
   quantity and/or quality of pollen supply. The natural pollinators are
   mainly solitary bees.
   The fraction of flowers setting fruits varied from 8 to 40\% between
   years. Fruit set of plants caged to exclude insects was less than 3\%.
   Fruit set was increased by artificial pollination of flowers with their
   own pollen to 43-64\%. This indicates that the plant is self-compatible,
   but due to the position of the anthers and stigma, insect visits are
   required for effective pollination. Cross-pollinated caged flowers set
   yet more fruits (59-82\%) and much more (2-4 times) full seeds per fruit
   than self-pollinated flowers.
   The artificial addition of cross-pollen to flowers, in the natural
   environment, increased the mean number of full seeds per flower on the
   whole plant. Thus, natural reproduction was limited by insect
   pollination.
   A quantitative effect was indicated by a strong positive association
   between the number of pollen grains on a stigma and the probabilities of
   the flower maturing a fruit and of its ovules setting seeds.
   Furthermore, in 20-60\% of flowers in the population, stigma loads were
   less than 13 pollen grains, which indicated very low probability of
   fruit maturation.
   A qualitative response was shown by the positive effect of artificially
   added cross-pollen on the number of full vs. empty seeds, an effect
   similar to that of cross- vs. self-pollination in caged plants.
   The proportion of full seeds developing in a clone of Asphodelus in the
   natural population was inversely related to the proportion of
   inflorescences in its neighbourhood that belonged to the same clone,
   which suggests that fertility is limited by an excess of pollen from the
   same clone being supplied by insects.
   It is concluded that female reproductive success of Asphodelus aestivus
   in its natural environment depended on both the amount and origin of the
   pollen supplied by its pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The bee faunas visiting spring-blooming shrubs in the chaparral of
   northern California were compared between two localities having similar
   plant species but different climatic regimes. Bees were collected from
   mid-March to mid-July during two consecutive years that were
   characterized by different rainfall. In the Inner Coast Ranges of Napa
   County, with a mediterranean climate, 73 bee species from six families
   were recorded on 11 shrub species; Megachilidae was the most
   species-rich family, followed by Andrenidae and Halictidae. Immediately
   inland from the coast in Marin County, where the frequently cool, foggy
   conditions are unfavorable for many solitary bees, the bee fauna had
   only half the number of species and a third the number of individuals;
   there were very few Megachilidae and a relatively high abundance of
   bumble bees. Of the 81 total species at both sites, close to one-third
   were shared between sites; the introduced honey bee was ubiquitous. A
   greater number of species were collected during the year of normal
   rainfall, most species were recorded in low abundance, and females
   comprised two-thirds of the collected specimens. Shrubs of the genus
   Ceanothus attracted the greatest diversity of bees. Comparison with
   other regional bee surveys shows the inland site here to be most typical
   of other areas with chaparral.}},

Abstract = {{The perfume syndrome and pollination by fragrance-collecting euglossine
   bees in the neotropic solanaceous genus Cyphomandra was confirmed by
   field observations. In SE Brazil, C. sciadostylis was visited by
   Eufriesea violacea, and C. diploconos by Euglossa mandibularis; C.
   hartwegii was pollinated by Eulaema meriana in Costa Rica. The primary
   attractant, fragrant droplets that ooze from the dorsally bulged
   connectives, is mopped up by the males with the forebasitarsi. Thereby,
   the poricidal thecae are inadvertently pushed causing the dry pollen to
   dust the bee's sternum. The number and direction of the pollen jets are
   related to pollinator size and stigma structure. The flowers are
   homogamous, self-sterile, and last three days. The androecium is
   optically non-contrasting or has cryptic colour. Flowers of C.
   sciadostylis and C. diploconos undergo a colour change and an almost
   three-fold increase in corolla size when scent production and visits
   cease. The dorsal papillar epidermis of the connective is underlain by a
   glandular parenchyma typical of osmophores. GC techniques revealed
   germacrene D as the main component in the mentholic scent of C.
   sciadostylis, ipsdienol, heneicosane, and tricosane as dominant in the
   nutmeg-like scent of C. diploconos, and benzyl acetate and benzyl
   alcohol in the sweet fragrance of C. hartwegii. In all cases, these were
   accompanied by numerous minor components of heterogeneous chemical
   nature. - Pollen release by means of a peculiar pneumatic bellows
   mechanism appears as a necessary and probably ubiquitous feature of
   Cyphomandra. Even a slight pressure exerted upon the thin, elastic
   thecal walls blows pollen jets through the pores. Unusual anatomic
   changes accompany anther maturation. Initially voluminous parenchymatic
   locular intumescences (placentoids) contract completely during meiosis,
   then expand once more when the pollen is ripe, pushing the grains
   against the locular wall, and contract a second time, allowing air to
   enter the thecae. - Cyphomandra pinetorum was found to be exceptional in
   exhibiting a pollen flower syndrome, and not cryptical but optically
   contrasting yellow anthers, as known for Solanum.}},

   were highly dependent on nearest neighbour distance, with isolated

   The investigations indicate that spontaneous pollen emission by buzzing

   pollenkitt, remain on the grains, but does not occur when the tryphine
   layer becomes dehydrated. The tryphine droplets act as a weak adhesive,

   arthropod biomass on the treated and untreated areas with pitfall traps

   Biomass of Coleoptera declined on the treated relative to the untreated

   recovered during later sampling periods. Grasshopper numbers declined on

Abstract = {{The individual's behavioral response to the environment is a consequence
   of three processes. Information from the environment must be encoded
   into a form that can be manipulated and stored in the nervous system.
   Encoded information is then subject to computational operations that
   lead to a representation of the environment that forms the basis for
   decisions and actions. The design of information-processing schemes acts
   as both a constraint on behavioral response and an aspect of the
   organism's phenotype that may be subject to natural selection. My
   experiments with bumblebees suggest that individual workers process
   information about floral rewards according to expected utility theory.
   Utility is here defined by a biomechanical function relating floral
   reward sizes to rates of net energetic gain. This model also suggests
   that bees process information from successive visits so as to maximize
   expected short-term (rather than tong-term) energetic gain. Short-term
   computational algorithms may prove advantageous when environments are
   spatially or temporally autocorrelated or when individuals are subject
   to short-term memory constraints. Short-term computational algorithms
   may lead to perceptual biases, for example, underestimation of
   low-probability events. Observations on the computational rules employed
   by individuals may reveal aspects of nervous system organization and
   operation. At the same time, the floral preferences that result from
   individual decision making may have profound consequences for the
   evolution of pollinator-plant interactions and ecological community

Abstract = {{Pollinators usually maintain directionality while moving through a
   flower patch, presumably to increase foraging success by minimizing
   revisitation of previously-emptied flowers. Two alternative
   directionality-generating mechanisms have been proposed: foragers may
   keep track of their arrival direction at a flower or cluster of flowers
   and prefer to depart in the same direction (the arrival hypothesis), or
   they may show little change in orientation while foraging at a flower or
   flower cluster and prefer to depart in the direction they are last
   facing (the last-faced hypothesis). Rotation of a flower or
   inflorescence while the forager is feeding on it will unequivocally
   distinguish the two hypotheses. We observed worker bumblebees (Bombus
   melanopygus and B. flavifrons) from captive colonies foraging on a
   square grid of 25 artificial flowers. Bumblebees were able to keep track
   of their orientations on a flower relative to their arrival direction,
   and they choose to leave a flower in about the same direction as their
   arrival. Whether or not individual flowers or the whole flower patch was
   rotated 90-degrees clockwise, departure directions were usually the same
   as arrival directions. In unrotated bees that changed direction between
   arrival and departure, relatively late changes in orientation during a
   flower visit tended to compensate for earlier ones. Last-facing
   directions were better predictors of subsequent movements than were
   arrival direction, indicating that most compensation for experimentally-
   or self-imposed rotation while on a flower occurred before a bee left
   the flower. We conclude that directionality in foraging bumblebees is

Abstract = {{The protogynous flowers of Sanguinaria canadensis L. (Papaveraceae) were
   facultatively xenogamous. They were cross-pollinated by bees, primarily
   female Adrena carlini, when flying conditions permitted and
   self-pollinated in their absence, which was a consequence of cool and/or
   rainy weather. Moderate to high pollinator activity did not occur until
   air temperatures reached 17-20-degrees-C. On cool but sunny days higher
   temperatures occurred just above the surface litter and the bees were
   active. Self-pollination usually occurred on day 3 if flowers had not
   already been cross-pollinated. Fruit set and seed set in self-pollinated
   flowers, emasculated open-pollinated flowers and open-pollinated
   controls were equivalent. Both light and temperature appeared to affect
   daily flower opening and closing. Flowers did not open if air
   temperature was less than 8-degrees-C, and at increasingly higher
   temperature opened earlier and closed later but at the same temperature
   opened later and closed earlier if it was cloudy. Facultative xenogamy
   in this spring flowering species is adaptive because the flowers were
   cross-pollinated when conditions favored pollinator activity but
   self-pollinated when pollinator activity was suppressed by cool and/or
   rainy weather. The research was done in east-central Iowa.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Greya is closely related to the yucca moths, and Greya species
   interact with their host plants in many of the same ways as yucca moths.
   Females both pollinate and oviposit in the flowers of their host. Unlike
   yucca moths, however, pollinating Greya species share flowers with
   co-pollinators that do not oviposit on the host. We studied the
   interaction between Greya politella (Walsingham) (Lepidoptera:
   Prodoxidae) and Lithophragma parviflorum (Hook.) Torr. \& Gray
   (Saxifragaceae) to evaluate the effect on seed output of a pollinating
   seed parasite against a background of co-pollinators.
   Flowers were visited and pollinated mostly by bombyliid flies, solitary
   bees, and G. politella. Bombyliid flies alone composed 68-88\% of the
   5522 visits recorded over 2 yr. Although both male and female G.
   politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, pollination by this
   species occurred only as females oviposited through the corolla tube,
   thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the
   abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9
   visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited
   multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive, and
   77\% of the flowers tagged during the 4 yr had some developing seeds.
   Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers
   receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some
   seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited
   only by other insects.
   Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and the
   larvae ate 15-27\% of the developing seeds. The final number of mature
   seeds remaining in attacked flowers did not differ from unattacked
   flowers except at one site in 1 yr, in which the values for attacked
   plants were marginally lower. Other sources of variation affecting seed
   output masked the effects of seed consumption by Greya.
   Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with
   L. parviflorum: they are effective pollinators, generally visit most
   plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly
   small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective
   co-pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's
   mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, the
   relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly
   commensalistic. The evolution of specialization to G. politella as an
   exclusive pollinator would seem to be possible only in L. parviflorum
   populations in which effective co-pollinators were either rare or
   unpredictable. That is, the potential for the evolution of specificity
   in this mutualism appears to depend upon the community context in which
   the interaction takes place rather than upon the simple outcome of the
   pairwise interaction between Greya and Lithophragma.}},

Abstract = {{Sweat bees {[}Lasioglossum (Dialictus) figueresi] returning to their
   nests were not disturbed if small-scale landmarks were added near nests
   before bees made orientation flights. Landmarks added after orientation
   flights delayed bees in locating nests when they returned. Spatially
   displacing landmarks had no effects on bees returning to their nests.
   Nest entrances usually had conspicuous turrets, but these were not
   required for nest recognition. Turrets provided some cues concerning
   nest identity since searching bees preferentially contacted their own
   turrets over alien ones. Swabbing the inner lining of a nest tunnel with
   hexane significantly delayed the bee's entry into the nest, but
   distilled water or an equal amount of hexane applied to the outside of
   the nest had no effect. The delay induced by a hexane wash was reduced
   significantly by placing the bee's unwashed turret on the nest entrance.
   Adding whole-body hexane extracts from probably unrelated females to
   nest entrances significantly delayed bees' entering nests.
   A review of mechanisms for nest recognition within Apoidea shows that to
   date olfactory mechanisms are more prevalent among bees (Apiformes) than
   wasps (Spheciformes). This pattern may be an artifact of the little
   information available on wasps. If substantiated, then known cases of
   olfactory nest recognition generally co-occur with a tendency toward
   social evolution within Apoidea, supporting a hypothesis proposed by
   HOLLDOBLER \& MICHENER (1980).}},

   inflorescences, and detached stamens with important phylogenetic and
   paleoecological implications have been discovered from the Turonian (ca.
   88.5-90.4 million years B.P.) Raritan Formation of New Jersey. The
   fossils have a combination of floral and pollen characters found in
   various genera of modern entomophilous and anemophilous Hamamelidaceae
   and anemophilous Platanus (Platanaceae). The floral characters of the
   fossils, including a sepal cup, staminal tube, and apparently
   nectariferous staminodes, indicate that this taxon was probably insect
   pollinated. The juxtaposition of character complexes in an extinct taxon
   from disparate modern taxa provides an interesting phylogenetic
   perspective on the origins of Hamamelidaceae and is a striking example
   of a fossil that is a mosaic of familial level characters relative to
   modern taxa. Of even broader interest, however, is the occurrence of
   staminodal nectaries that have structural characters intermediate
   between the fossil's functional stamens and modern hamamelidaceous
   petals. This transitional staminode morphology in the context of the
   other fossil characters suggests a staminodal origin of petals in the
   hamamelid-rosid lineage. This hypothesis is supported by the apparent
   staminode position within the fossil flowers where petals are found in
   modern genera. The character complex of morphologically transitional
   staminodes, a staminal tube, and sepal cup can be viewed as
   prehypanthial, lacking only fusion of the staminal tube to the sepal
   cup. The appearance of the character complex embodied in these flowers
   during the late mid-Cretaceous may signal the early stages of the
   relationship between specialized pollinators, such as bees, and the
   hamamelid-rosid-asterid lineage of angiosperms, arguably one of the most
   important events in angiosperm radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Echinomastus erectrocentrus var. acunensis initiates flowering in early
   March and is the first cactus species to bloom in Organ Pipe Cactus
   National Monument, Arizona. Flowering is correlated with plant size; the
   smallest plant to flower in the study area was 24 mm tall, and
   thereafter the percentage of plants that produced flowers increased to
   near 100\%, at greater-than-or-equal-to 90 mm in height. For
   flower-bearing plants, the number of flowers produced increased with
   plant height but was better correlated with plant volume. Number of
   flowers produced varied among years when controlling for plant volume
   and was positively associated with annual rainfall. Echinomastus is
   self-incompatible and thus requires insect vectors for pollination.
   Flower visitors are mostly solitary, polylectic bee species, largely
   Andrenidae, Anthophoridae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae, but the primary
   pollinators in each of 2 yr were Megachile palmensis (Megachilidae) and
   Diadasia rinconis (Anthophoridae). These same two species also accounted
   for ca. 90\% of the pollinators captured on Echinocereus engelmannii
   var. acicularis, a potential competitor that began to flower near the
   peak of the Echinomastus flowering period. Insect visitation rates to
   Echinocereus were higher than those to Echinomastus throughout the
   period of concurrent flowering; however, visitation rate to both species
   decreased near the end of the Echinomastus flowering period. Both
   fruit-set and seed-set by Echinomastus approached 100\% and thus were
   not affected by temporal variation in pollinator effectiveness,
   abundance, or both. Number of seeds per fruit did vary temporally,
   however, and was lower for flowers that bloomed late in the flowering
   season because there were fewer ovules in these buds. Seed-set per fruit
   and ovule number per bud also varied among plants. Fruits and seeds were
   eaten by larvae of the pyralid moth Yosemitia graciella.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in pollinator assemblages at several levels can affect the
   likelihood of evolutionary specialization of plants for particular
   pollinators and patterns of natural selection on floral characters. This
   paper describes variation in a pollinator assemblage (mainly solitary
   bees) at three levels - geographic occurrence, abundance, and foraging
   behavior as a function of floral characters - for the gynodioecious
   annual Phacelia linearis (Hydrophyllaceae). The set of Hymenoptera that
   visit P. linearis flowers varies geographically. Phacelia linearis
   populations in five of eight areas separated by 2-80 km had species of
   flower visitors that were not collected at the seven other sites. In
   experimental plant populations in one of these areas, the relative
   abundances of 12 common groups of pollinators varied significantly over
   the season within sites, at the same site between consecutive years, and
   between sites 2 km apart in the same year. Some groups that were very
   common in one experimental population were rare or absent in the others.
   The ten most common groups of visitors varied in their behavioral
   responses to flower gender (hermaphrodite or female), flower size, and
   flower number. Four groups arrived at hermaphrodite plants at a
   significantly higher rate than at female plants. Hermaphrodites have
   larger flowers than do females, and in two insect groups that preferred
   to visit hermaphrodites, their preference was all or in part a
   correlated effect of their preference for large-flowered plants. One
   group, Pseudomasaris spp. (Hymenoptera; Masaridae) preferred to visit
   female plants. The arrival rate of nine insect groups increased with
   flower number. The arrival rate of beetles and of four relatively
   large-bodied bees increased with hermaphrodite flower size, while the
   arrival rate of a small bee, the Phacelia specialist Chelostoma minutum
   (Megachilidae) increased with female flower size. Five groups visited
   significantly more (but proportionately fewer) flowers after arriving at
   many-flowered plants than at few-flowered plants, and two groups visited
   significantly more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female. Variation
   in the occurrence and abundance of its pollinators makes evolutionary
   specialization of P. linearis for particular pollinators unlikely.
   Variation in pollinator abundance and behavior may cause small-scale
   spatio-temporal variation in selection for floral characters in this
   species. A specific hypothesis is that selection favors large-flowered
   hermaphrodites in populations and years in which the pollinator
   assemblage is dominated by large-bodied bees.}},

   in the head. Male pouncing on females is temporally non-random,
   indicative of group stimulation. Bioassays show that newly emerged

   females. Female odors are individually distinctive, based on male
   responses, and there is much variation among females in their attractive
   properties. Male responses to female odors suggest that learning is
   important for mating in natural populations. In contrast, the following
   hypotheses are unlikely to account for the observed behavior: (1)
   dissipation of female odors; (2) site learning and avoidance behavior by
   males; (3) decay of male motivation; or (4) male-produced repellents
   effective against other males. Laboratory and field studies show that
   female Lasioglossum figueresi produce individually-distinctive odors,
   which are attractive to males. There is considerable inter-individual
   variation among females in their attractiveness to males among sexually

   individuals homozygous for marker alleles at an isozyme ((GOT-2)

   recipient, the proportion of offspring sired in the full array, and the
   proportion of mates in the array bearing seeds of the donor. Pollen
   removal was strongly influenced by the number of bee visits to donor
   flowers. The amount of pollen removed in turn significantly affected the
   number of pollen grains reaching flowers of the first recipient.
   However, because seed production decelerates with stigma pollen load,
   the relationship between pollen export and paternal success at this

Abstract = {{Mesophyll protoplasts of Lycopersicon esculentum were treated with
   iodoacetamide to inactivate mitochondria, and protoplasts of Solanum
   acaule and Solanum tuberosum were irradiated with gamma- or x-rays to
   inactivate nuclei. Mixtures of protoplasts thus modified were treated
   with Ca2+ and polyethylene glycol to obtain heterologous fusion
   products. Among the fusion products were some tomato plants that were
   indistinguishable from the original cultivars with respect to
   morphology, physiology, and chromosome number (2N = 24) but exhibited
   various degrees of male sterility (MS): complete lack or malformation of
   anthers, shrunken pollen, and normal-looking stainable pollen that could
   not germinate. The MS thus induced in five cultivars of different growth
   types, including one of subspecies L. esculentum cerasiforme, was
   inherited maternally over several generations and is, therefore,
   cytoplasmically determined MS (CMS). Analysis of mitochondrial DNA
   revealed that the mitochondrial genome of the CMS hybrids does not
   contain all elements of the mitochondrial DNA of either parent but
   includes sequences of a recombinational nature not present in either
   parent. The CMS hybrids, therefore, possess a true hybrid mitochondrial
   genome. The same procedure applied to fusion of tomato with Solanum
   lycopersicoides and Nicotiana tabacum cells did not produce CMS
   phenotypes. The advantages of this method over others for generating MS
   are as follows: (i) only one step is required; (ii) the nuclear genotype
   of the cultivar is unaffected; (iii) the prospect that cytoplasmic
   determination allows generation of 100\% CMS progenies. The
   normal-appearing but nonfunctional pollen of certain CMS types might
   render them attractive to pollinating bumblebees that thus would
   facilitate production of hybrid seed.}},

   more fruit (92\%) than did florets receiving natural pollination (51\%).
   Twenty-seven percent of the capitula were lost to herbivory. Some

   were equally viable as seed produced from xenogamous pollination. Seeds

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression, or the decreased fitness of progeny derived from
   self-fertilization as compared to outcrossing, is thought to be the most
   general factor affecting the evolution of self-fertilization in plants.
   Nevertheless, data on inbreeding depression in fitness characters are
   almost nonexistent for perennials observed in their natural
   environments. In this study I measured inbreeding depression in both
   survival and fertility in two sympatric, short-lived, perennial herbs:
   hummingbird-pollinated Lobelia cardinalis (two populations) and
   bumblebee-pollinated L. siphilitica (one population). Crosses were
   performed by hand in the field, and seedlings germinated in the
   greenhouse. Levels of inbreeding depression were determined for one year
   in the greenhouse and for two to three years for seedlings transplanted
   back to the natural environment. Fertility was measured as flower
   number, which is highly correlated with seed production under natural
   conditions in these populations. Inbreeding depression was assessed in
   three ways: 1) survival and fertility within the different age
   intervals; 2) cumulative survival from the seed stage through each age
   interval; and 3) net fertility, or the expected fertility of a seed at
   different ages. Net fertility is a comprehensive measure of fitness
   combining survival and flower number. In all three populations, selfing
   had nonsignificant effects on the number and size of seeds. Lobelia
   siphilitica and one population of L. cardinalis exhibited significant
   levels of inbreeding depression between seed maturation and germination,
   excluding the consideration of possible differences in dormancy or
   longterm viability in the soil. There was no inbreeding depression in
   subsequent survival in the greenhouse in any population. In the field,
   significant survival differences between selfed and outcrossed progeny
   occurred only in two years and in only one population of L. cardinalis.
   For both survival and fertility there was little evidence for the
   expected differences among families in inbreeding depression. Compared
   to survival, inbreeding depression in fertility (flower number) tended
   to be much higher. By first-year flower production, the combined effects
   on survival and flower number caused inbreeding depression in net
   fertility to reach 54\%, 34\% and 71\% for L. siphilitica and the two
   populations of L. cardinalis. By the end of the second year of flowering
   in the field, inbreeding depression in net fertility was 53\% for L.
   siphilitica and 54\% for one population of L. cardinalis. For the other
   population of L. cardinalis, these values were 76\% through the second
   year of flowering and 83\% through the third year. Such high levels of
   inbreeding depression should strongly influence selection on those
   characters affecting self-fertilization rates in these two species.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations carried out by the author for 15 years on the
   Wielkopolsko-Kujawska Lowland (Western Poland) showed that wild bees
   (Apoidea) are today under strong human pressure. About 260 bee species
   were found in the area of 20 000 km2. A similar number of species was
   recorded in this area by investigators half a century ago, which
   indicates that the survival of the fauna seems to be the result of some
   compensating factors reducing the effects of intensive agricultural
   management. The main factor among these is the mosaic structure of the
   landscape, consisting of meadows and residues of natural and
   semi-natural plant communities as a fauna refuge system and crop fields
   as an additional nutritive system. It was found that in a normally
   functioning agricultural landscape, the share of farmland should not
   exceed three-quarters of the total surface. The remaining part of the
   landscape should be made up of refuge habitats for Apoidea. Within such
   a system, qualitative and quantitative changes of the bee fauna can
   occur on a microregional scale and are usually of temporary character.
   On a regional scale they are not perceivable and probably not so
   important. Hence, instead of changes in fauna, one should rather speak
   about quantitative oscillations inside a given region. The second factor
   decreasing the negative effects of management is the introduction of
   extensive areas of some nutritive plants, e.g. rape.}},

   pollen and nectar. An egg is deposited upon each food mass within one
   cell.
   2. Female offspring generally receive a higher provisioning mass (0.180
   +/- 0.048 g) than males, a significant difference (P < 0.001). There
   are, however. male larvae that receive as much food or more as their
   sisters or female larvae reared in another nest.
   3. There is a close positive association between the size of a mother
   and the weight of provisions for individual daughters, but not for sons.
   4. Female offspring are positioned in the innermost brood cells
   (positions 1, and 3).  The sex ratio of the outer cells is either
   significantly male biased (positions 4-6) or skewed towards males
   (positions 8 and 9).  Positions 7 and 10 are in equilibrium.

   sex ratio (pooled sex ratio of all broods produced) is significantly

   6. Females kept in the laboratory produced female biased sex ratios

   contrasting communities: a deciduous woodland-meadow site in eastern
   Massachusetts, alpine tundra in New Hampshire, and Mediterranean scrub
   (fynbos) in South Africa. Visits to flowers were most common in
   woodland-meadow, followed by alpine tundra, and least frequent in
   fynbos. Bees were the most common visitor in the woodland-meadow and the
   fynbos, but flies were the most common visitor in the tundra. Flower
   color often influenced visitation rates and had a weak but significant
   effect on the type of insect that visited flowers. Preferences for color
   by different types of insects often changed in different communities,
   which suggests that floral syndromes may be community-specific. In all
   communities, tubular flowers were visited less often than open flowers.
   Less specialized insects were more common on open than tubular flowers,

   Combining measurements of temperature, light, humidity, wind speed, time

   1 to 5-mu-L significantly increased probe duration, but this had no
   detectable effect on pollination success through the female sexual
   function (pollen deposited on stigmas) or male sexual function (pollen
   removed from anthers and number of fluorescent dye particles exported to
   other flowers).  In contrast, both male and female pollination success
   increased with the number of times a hummingbird probed a flower.  For
   male function, there was at best a weak tendency for pollen export to
   diminish with successive probes, in contrast to strongly diminishing
   returns reported for bee-pollinated flowers.  This difference may
   reflect foraging mode; hummingbirds hover and remove a small fraction of
   available pollen with each floral probe whereas bees land and remove
   most pollen with the first probe.  For plants such as I. aggregata whose
   pollination success is most sensitive to the number of probes per
   flower, selection on nectar production may be strongest when there are
   cues pollinators can use to identify rewarding plants, such as
   phenotypic correlations between nectar production and floral morphology.}},

Abstract = {{From 1985-1987, patterns of fruit and seed set were studied in a
   population of mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum), a clonal,
   self-incompatible herb found in deciduous woods in eastern North
   America.  Mayapple flowers do not produce nectar, but depend on
   infrequent visits by nectar-seeking queen bumble bees for pollination. 
   In all years female reproductive success in mayapple colonies was
   influenced by colony size (number of flowers), by the distance to
   neighbouring colonies and by proximity to lousewort plants (Pedicularis
   canadensis), a prolific nectar producer heavily visited by bumble bees. 
   In all years fruit and seed set were greater in mayapple colonies < 25 m
   from lousewort flowers than in matched colonies which were > 50 m from
   lousewort.  In 1985 and 1987 the frequency of queen bumble bee visits to
   flowers in colonies close to lousewort was about four times greater than
   to distant colonies.  In 1986 I removed about 80\% of lousewort flowers
   to test whether the enhanced fruit and seed set in mayapples close to
   lousewort was pollinator mediated.  Mayapple colonies close to
   flowerless lousewort patches did not differ in fruit or seed set from
   matched colonies > 50 m from lousewort.  In contrast, mayapples close to
   flowering lousewort patches had greater fruit and seed set compared with
   distant colonies.  Over all years, a larger proportion of mayapples
   close to flowering lousewort patches had enhanced fruit and seed set
   compared with colonies close to louseworts without flowers.  Though
   rarely documented, this type of facilitative interaction between plants

   co-flowering species that are rarely visited by pollinators, may be
   widespread in plant communities.}},

   sp. (Megachilini), which collected both pollen and resin. This bee was
   the primary pollinator of D. galpinii and D. volubilis, and a secondary
   pollinator of D. aff parvifolia and D. capensis. The primary pollinators
   of these latter two Dalechampia were Pachyanthidium near cucullatum and
   P. cordatum (Anthididiini), respectively. These are larger bees that
   collected mainly resin. Other visitors varied among Dalechampia species
   and among sites. Pairs of Dalechampia species were often found in
   sympatry (within 30 m of each other) and shared pollinators to varying

   densifolia, discriminant function analysis of petal dimensions and a
   spectral analysis of corolla colour was undertaken. Petal size varied
   moderately among species resulting in 2-14\% of specimens being
   misclassified, usually as D. uncinata. Subtle variation in corolla
   colour in the ultraviolet wavelengths contributed to the distinctiveness
   of each species. All three species exhibit an UV-absorbing region at the
   base of the standard petal which contrasts sharply with the rest of the
   UV-reflecting petal. Between 450 nm and 470 nm, per cent reflectance
   drops for D. hispida and P. densifolia, but remains steady for D.

   P. densifolia produced an excess of pollen which may serve as a reward.
   Despite the subtle differences in floral morphology and rewards among

Abstract = {{Departure rules used by solitary long-tongued bees (Anthophora spp. and

   (Boraginaceae) were studied.  The amount of nectar a bee receives from
   an individual flower was estimated by measuring the time elapsed since
   the previous bee visit to that flower.  Measurements of nectar
   accumulation in experimentally emptied flowers indicated that this time
   interval is an accurate predictor of nectar volumes in flowers.  We
   found that nectar rewards influence the probability of departure from
   individual plants, as well as distances of movements within plants.  The
   probability of departure from individual plants was negatively related
   to the amount of reward received at the two last-visited flowers.  This
   result indicates that the bees used a probabilistic departure rule,
   rather than a simple threshold departure rule, and that rewards from
   both the current and the previously visited flower were important in
   determining departure points.  Distances of inter-flower movements
   within plants were negatively related to the amount of reward received
   at the current flower.  The overall results suggest that the pollinators

   the whole plant and departures from the neighbourhood of individual
   flowers - and that they use different departure rules for each scale.

   species is important as a sand colonizer and plays a significant role in
   geomorphology. The plants often cover large areas and form a rather
   continuous mat that helps to keep the sand from moving and holds the
   substrate together. The flowers are visited by bees and other insects;
   Xylocopa species (Hymenoptera) are important pollinators. Ants visit
   extrafloral nectaries and help the plant increase reproductive success
   in some areas. The leaves and seeds contain the indole alkaloid

Abstract = {{The frequencies of floral morphs populations of tristylous Eichhornia
   paniculata often deviate from the theoretical expectation of equality.
   This variation is associated with the breakdown of tristyly and the
   evolution of self-fertilization. Differences in morph frequencies could
   result from selection pressures due to variable levels of insect
   visitation to populations and contrasting foraging behavior among the
   floral morphs. We estimated pollinator densities in 16 populations and
   quantified visitation sequences to morphs in five populations of E.
   paniculata in northeastern Brazil. Foraging behavior among floral morphs
   was measured as the frequency of visits to morphs relative to their
   frequency in the population (preference) and number of flights between
   inflorescences of the same versus different morphs (constancy).
   Pollinator density (number/m2/minute) was not correlated with population
   size, plant density or morph diversity. Pollinator densities varied most
   among populations of less than 200 plants. Whether pollinators
   discriminated among the morphs, depended on whether they primarily
   collected nectar or pollen. In four populations, nectar-feeding bees
   (Ancyloscelis and Florilegus spp.) and butterflies showed no consistent
   preference or constancy among the morphs. In contrast, pollen-collecting
   bees (Trigona sp.) visited a lower proportion of long-styled
   inflorescences than expected and tended to visit more mid- and
   short-styled inflorescences in succession, once they were encountered.
   Pollinator constancy for morphs did not result from differences in
   inflorescence production or spatial patchiness among the morphs.
   although non-random pollinator visitation to morphs in heterostylous
   populations could potentially affect mating and hence morph frequencies,
   the observed visitation patterns in this study do not provide evidence
   that pollinators play a major role in influencing floral morph
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Gene flow was investigated in a natural population of Lotus corniculatus
   L. (Fabaceae) using a combination of pollen and seed dispersal studies
   and a recombinant DNA technique. The population is spatially
   heterogeneous and grows with Empetrum nigrum. L. corniculatus is
   pollinated by the pollen-collecting bumblebee Bombus lapidarius L. Most
   pollinator flights occurred within patches, as bees usually visit
   nearest-neighbour plants, show no marked directionality, and forage
   mostly within patches. Gene flow by seeds is also limited, reinforcing
   the pattern of gene flow within patches. However, 2.6\% of pollinator
   flights are between patches and considerable pollen carryover also
   occurs. Thus, gene flow between patches is potentially sufficient to
   retard or prevent genetic differentiation in spite of the patchy
   substructuring of the population. A sub-set of the population was
   analysed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to
   document the actual gene flow pattern of the population. The DNA
   analysis revealed significant levels of genetic differentiation between
   the patches. The level of gene flow that can be inferred from the
   distribution of genetic variation is surprisingly restricted, as

Abstract = {{Flower-visiting Diptera are abundant in montane and Arctic areas. This
   research, conducted on the western slope of the Colorado Rocky
   Mountains: (1) characterizes the predominant anthophilous fly taxa in
   comparison with other high-elevation and high-latitude sites; (2)
   examines changes in fly abundance with elevation, and (3) examines the
   potential of flies as pollinators by examining quality and quantity of
   pollen loads. Flies collected from 66 flowering species were identified
   to species to produce a data base containing taxonomic information,
   elevation and floral records. Malaise trap censuses were conducted in
   three elevational zones. Pollen carried by flies and pollen in their
   guts were quantified and examined to determine the number of plant
   species represented.
   Proportional representation of dipteran families changed in a similar
   manner in different mountain systems and the Arctic. The predominance of
   flies on flowers at high elevations appears to be due to a decrease in
   representation of other orders of insects. Most fly taxa fed at multiple
   plant species, but gut contents indicated that individual flies fed
   largely on a single pollen type. Total pollen loads of flies and
   solitary bees were similar although flies collected on Linum lewisii
   carried less pollen than bees.}},

Abstract = {{Each day during flowering a Pontederia cordata (Pontederiaceae)
   inflorescence produces 10-40 uniovulate flowers which open for only 8 h.
   In favourable weather, specialist (Melissodes apicata) and generalist
   bees (Bombus spp.) visited this plant so intensively that they removed
   95\% of the pollen produced by midday. From flower opening until the end
   of pollen availability, P. cordata flowers produced nectar with an
   energy content of 0.82 +/- 0.084 J (mean +/- SE). During the subsequent
   4 h that the flowers remained open they produced an additional 0.63 +/-
   0.184 J of nectar energy. Therefore these flowers expended 45.1\%
   (median) more energy on nectar production than was necessary to ensure
   pollen dispersal. This apparently extra cost of animal pollination could
   be selectively advantageous if it maintains the attention of generalist
   pollinators that do not depend on Pontederia cordata or if it provides a
   bet-hedging mechanism to promote pollination in weather that is
   unfavourable to pollinator activity. Regardless of whether this
   post-pollination nectar is advantageous, its production probably
   involves little physiological expense as nectar comprises only 3\% of
   the energy content of each Pontederia cordata flower. This small
   investment contrasts with findings for Asclepias syriaca, which expends
   up to 33\% of its daily photosynthetic production during flowering on
   nectar. Regression analysis of the relation between `per flower' nectar
   production and inflorescence size for 27 species indicates that A.
   syriaca produces an unusually large amount of nectar, whereas Pontederia
   cordata produces the amount expected given its flower production. Hence
   nectar production by most bee-pollinated plants probably involves little
   energetic cost.}},

Abstract = {{The potential threat of parasites to Osmia cornuta populations managed

   the drosophilid fly Cacoxenus sp., and the cleptoparasitic mite
   Chaetodactylus osmiae, were found in wild populations, but their rates
   of parasitism rarely exceeded 10\%. Cacoxenus was never found in managed
   populations, but the torymid wasp Monodontomerus obsoletus caused
   serious damage in some populations when bee cocoons were made accessible
   by extricating them from nesting materials in the laboratory.
   Chaetodactylus osmiae was also present in managed populations but in low
   numbers. In 1991, a population of O. cornuta was released in an almond
   orchard. As opposed to other releases in which `clean' populations were
   used, in this release some cells infested with C. osmiae, Cacoxenus sp.,
   and M. obsoletus were intentionally introduced with the bee population.
   No cell was reparasitized by Cacoxenus sp., because by the time these
   drosophilids became adults the flying season of the O. cornuta
   population was almost over. On the other hand, the number of cells
   infested with C. osmiae mites increased to six times the number of
   infested cells originally introduced. Most M. obsoletus developed
   normally, and parasitism by this wasp increased slightly (from 20 to 30
   cells). As O. cornuta flies very early in the season when few species of

   blossoms was identified in 1988 and 1989.  The percentage of blossoms
   setting nuts also was measured with respect to a tree limb's adjacent

   2.  Every honey-bee that we collected foraging on almond blossoms had
   self-pollen on its body and 90\% or more had cross-pollen.  In 1988,
   60-92\% of the foragers had non-almond pollen on their bodies, while in
   1989 the percentages were 92-100\%.
   3.  In 1988 there was significantly more self- and cross-pollen on
   foragers' bodies than non-almond pollen with the exception of `Peerless'
   nectar collectors.  However, in 1989 the percentages of cross- and
   non-almond pollen were equivalent except for `Price', and were
   significantly less than the percentages of self-pollen.
   4.  In 1988, 42.1-81.2\% of the stigmas we examined had self-pollen,
   36.8-68.7\% had cross-pollen, and 43.7-94.0\% had non-almond pollen.  In
   1989, 60.0-100.0\% of the stigmas had self-pollen, 10-100\% had
   cross-pollen, and 80.0-100.0\% had non-almond pollen.
   5.  The percentages of pollen types on stigmas did not differ
   significantly between limbs adjacent to trees of the same or different
   cultivars.  In 1988 the percentages of self- and cross-pollen on stigmas
   were equivalent in all cultivars except `NePlus' which had significantly
   more self- than cross-pollen.  In 1989 there was significantly more
   self- than cross-pollen on stigmas of all cultivars except `Price' which
   had equivalent amounts of both pollen types.  In both years non-almond
   pollen occurred with equivalent or significantly higher frequencies than
   self-pollen.
   6.  Nut set on limbs adjacent to compatible pollen sources did not
   differ significantly from those within the same row adjacent to trees of
   the same cultivar (i.e. incompatible pollen sources).
   7.  The population of honey-bees capable of cross-pollination in almond
   orchards is apparently a majority of the overall honey-bee foraging
   population and is homogeneously distributed throughout the orchard.}},

   patterns of flower usage, and several rarer forms.
   3. A simple selectivity score ranks plant taxa in terms of the visits
   they receive from bumble-bees of each colour group. High scores may be
   due to high local flower abundance or to preference by the bees, and
   indicate plant taxa that may be worth encouraging to enhance bumble-bee
   populations locally.
   4. A group-specific selectivity score highlights differences between

   management to favour particular bumble-bee species selectively.

Abstract = {{By experiment, we show that the pollination success obtained from a
   bumblebee visit by an individual of Polemonium viscosum depends strongly
   on the size of nectar rewards offered and weakly on flower size. 
   However, probably because the size of nectar rewards correlates with
   flower size, bumblebees discriminate among individual plants on the
   basis of flower size.  If the bumblebees' preferences are learned, then
   it is likely that the nature of the preferences will depend on the bees'
   experience with reward/advertisement combinations and that this will be
   affected by the frequencies of the combinations in the population. 
   Thus, pollinator preferences can be a source of frequency-dependent
   selection on floral traits in insect-pollinated plants.  In general,
   when the pollimation performance of plants is determined in part by
   pollinator visitation rate, then the adaptive surfaces that Armbruster
   proposed for the study of relationships between form and function in
   flowers may alter under frequency-dependent selection.  The shape of the
   adaptive surface may depend on population composition under the

   correlation between nectar production rate and standing crop of nectar,
   and a correlation of standing crop of nectar with a component of a

   and fewer inflorescences per minute than workers. Both males and workers
   carried similar numbers of milkweed pollinaria for similar periods and
   flew similar distances between patches of flowers. However,
   proportionately more males foraged in the afternoon than in the morning.
   Thus, males forage less than workers but appear to differ little in how
   they forage.}},

Abstract = {{Individual plants in gynodioecious populations of Phacelia linearis
   (Hydrophyllaceae) vary in flower gender, flower size, and flower number.
   This paper reports the effects of variation in floral display on the
   visitation behaviour of this species' pollinators (mainly
   pollen-collecting solitary bees) in several natural and three
   experimental plant populations, and discusses the results in terms of
   the consequences for plant fitness. The working hypotheses were: (1)
   that because female plants do not produce pollen, pollen-collecting
   insects would visit hermaphrodite plants at a higher rate than female
   plants and would visit more flowers per hermaphrodite than per female;
   and (2) that pollinator arrival rate would increase with flower size and
   flower number, the two main components of visual display. These
   hypotheses were generally supported, but the effects of floral display
   on pollinator visitation varied substantially among plant populations.
   Hermaphrodites received significantly higher rates of pollinator
   arrivals and significantly higher rates of visits to flowers than did
   females in all experimental populations. Flower size affected arrival
   rate and flower visit rate positively in natural populations and in two
   of the three experimental populations. The flower size effect was
   significant only among female plants in one experimental population, and
   only among hermaphrodites in another. The effect of flower number on
   arrival rate was positive and highly significant in natural populations
   and in all experimental populations. In two out of three experimental
   populations, insects visited significantly more flowers per
   hermaphrodite than per female and visited more flowers on many-flowered
   plants than on few-flowered plants, but neither effect was detected in
   the third experimental population. Because seed production is not
   pollen-limited in this species, variation in pollinator visitation
   behaviour should mainly affect the male reproductive success of
   hermaphrodite plants. These findings suggest that pollinator-mediated
   natural selection for floral display in P. linearis varies in space and
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Perdita (Macrotera) texana is a ground nesting, univoltine,
   facultatively communal bee species found in western Texas and southern
   Oklahoma. As many as 28 females may share a single nest, but most nests
   have no more than five females and approximately 25\% of the nests are
   occupied by a single female. Most nests are constructed de novo each
   year but some females reuse their natal nests. These is no apparent
   reproductive division of labor among nestmates, as all residents of
   communal nests forage and have developed ovaries. Nests consist of a
   single main tunnel and several laterals leading to brood cells. Females
   provision a single cell per day with pollen and nectar collected
   exclusively from Opuntia (Platyopuntia) spp. All evidence indicates that
   P. texana is a successful pollinator of Opuntia. Cell provisioning
   requires an average of 8 pollen trips and occasionally an additional
   nectar-only trip. Pollen trips average 6 min, while nectar trips average
   17 min. The entire cell-provisioning process requires 72 min on average.
   P. texana is unusual among bees in that males are regular occupants
   within nests. Males enter nests throughout the afternoon and reside
   there until the following morning, leaving just prior to the beginning
   of cell provisioning by females. The biology of P. texana is compared to
   that of other Perdita species, and the evolutionary implications of
   communal nesting are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We examined foreleg length and body size variation in two species of
   oil-collecting bees (Rediviva; Melittidae) in southern Africa. 
   Oil-collecting bees harvest oil from host flowers by rubbing their
   forelegs against oil-secreting trichomes.  Significant differences in
   foreleg length occur among populations of both species.  Rediviva
   ``pallidula{''} populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length
   (11.34 +/- 0.42 mm to 12.67 +/- 0.36 mm), but not in body length (10.59
   +/- 0.74 to 10.80 +/- 0.64), and foreleg length and body size are not
   significantly correlated.  Instead, foreleg variation appears to be a
   function of host plant spur length.  Ninety-two percent of the variance
   in foreleg length of R. ``pallidula{''} is explained by mean Diascia
   spur length.  Rediviva rufocincta populations vary significantly in mean
   foreleg length (10.12 +/- 0.70 mm to 12.34 +/- 0.68 mm) and in body
   length (9.03 +/- 0.26 mm to 10.56 +/- 0.24 mm).  Foreleg length scales
   allometrically with body size in this species as 90.5\% of the variance
   in foreleg length can be explained as a function of body length.  Body
   size appears to be constrained by the morphology of the oil-secreting
   host plant.
   Both bees collect floral oil with specially modified setae on the tarsi
   of their forelegs.  The length of the disti- + mediotarsus (refered to
   here as ``tarsus{''}) in relation to the entire foreleg is shorter in R.
   rufocincta and does not increase as rapidly with increasing foreleg
   length as for R. ``pallidula.{''}  These differences in variation can be
   attributed to differences in position of oil within the flowers of the
   respective host plants.  Rediviva ``pallidula{''} collects oil from
   Diascia species that have the oil deeply situated in narrow floral spurs
   of varying length, while R. rufocincta collects oil from the broadly
   saccate flowers of Bowkeria verticillata and B. citrina.}},

   were required to achieve the average natural full seed-set in the plant
   population.  Although 57\% of the flower-visiting moths deposited
   pollen, only about 10\% of the moth visits delivered
   greater-than-or-equal-to 150 pollen grains in one visit to virgin female
   flowers, indicating that seed-set usually originated from multiple
   pollinator visits.
   (3) Pollen receipt indicated pollination by a guild of noctuid and
   sphingid moths.  The abundance of the dominating pollinator species
   varied strongly between years.
   (4) Most species deposited about the same mean number of pollen grains,
   although they were taxonomically diverse and had different

   the fact that these moths influence their larval food resource through
   pollination.
   (5) The annual and seasonal variation in abundance among pollinator
   species and lack of variation in pollination efficiency among them are
   factors which counteract specializational trends and control
   evolutionary retention of plastic and unspecialized floral traits in S.

   change results in decreased mean annual snowfall for the Rocky

   adversely affected.  Decreased snowfall may also indirectly lower the

Abstract = {{Innate behavioural reactions in bumblebees were observed in flower dummy
   experiments.  In a previous paper, it was shown that the approach of
   flower-naive, untrained bumblebees toward flower dummies is released by
   colour signals, i.e. a gradient of spectral purity.  The bumblebees are
   directed toward that part of a flower dummy which exhibits the highest
   spectral purity (LUNAU 1990).  In the present work it is shown that the
   bumblebees, while still in flight, make contact with this part using
   their antennal tips.  The antennae reaction is followed by a landing
   reaction which is released by olfactory and optical signals.  The
   specific optical signals of the guide are which release the landing
   reaction were investigated.  Since in the flower dummies which were
   used, the guide had the highest spectral purity, most of the antennae
   reactions were executed at the guide.  The antennae reaction allows for
   a precise orientation and may involve the stimulation of a specialized
   area of ommatidia.  Minute changes in optical guide parameters could
   thus be detected.  The following features of stamens which most
   effectively released the landing reaction were:  a minimum of 2 theca
   dummies; an oval shape of theca dummies which face each other along the
   longitudinal axis (both these characteristics are found in genuine
   stamens); 4 mm distance between theca dummies (this coincides with the
   distance between the antennal tips of bumblebees); two equally sized
   theca dummies each with an area of 7 mm2 (this size of theca dummies was
   preferred over larger or smaller ones; the latter parameter was not
   changed when the corolla size was varied).  Colour parameters are not
   involved in releasing the landing reaction.  Clearly, bumblebees possess
   an innate releasing mechanism (IRM) that responds to optical signals of
   anthers which release the landing reaction.  The experimental results
   are in accordance with conclusions drawn from the comparative studies of
   OSCHE (1979, 1983 a, 1983 b) that many flower guides can be interpreted
   as stamen mimics.  Therefore stamens as well as stamen mimics represent
   a highly standardized signal for the insect pollinators and they are
   well suited for innate orientation at flowers.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of Cycas media in northern Queensland, Australia, showed no
   differences between males and females in leaf number and stem height. 
   Leaf numbers and stem heights were normally distributed in all
   populations sampled.  The mass of fresh nearly mature seeds from
   individual females was about three times greater than the mass of the
   single fresh cone produced by individual males, suggesting that resource
   allocation to reproduction is greater for females than for males.  The
   proportions of putatively mature individuals participating in the two
   reproductive episodes evident during the study were between 14\% and
   38\%.  On an overall population basis, including immature plants or
   those otherwise too small to produce cones, the proportion of
   individuals without reproductive structures ranged from 56\% to 93\%. 
   Leaf life is of short duration and many naturally defoliated plants were
   present.  Leaf production appears to be stimulated by fire, estimated to
   occur every 2 or 3 yr.  Species belonging to two genera of Coleoptera
   were collected from male cones shedding pollen, and individuals of the
   bee Trigona carbonaria were observed collecting pollen from these cones.
   The genus Trigona is the oldest known fossil bee; it seems possible that
   it may have collected gymnosperm pollen prior to the origin of
   angiosperms and that this association has persisted to the present.}},

Abstract = {{In Cleistes divaricata, a hinged anther dispenses a sequence of loosely

   pollen from a single flower.  To determine the effectiveness of this
   strategy, plants in bud were caged and hand pollinated using pollen from
   sequential releases.  Capsules produced from a flower's first three
   pollen dumps were significantly larger and heavier and contained more
   seeds than those produced by later pollen deposits with fewer tetrads. 
   Decreasing pollen dosage did not affect fruit set, capsule development,
   individual seed weight, or percentage of healthy looking embryos per
   fruit.  Fruit set for artificial pollinations was 93\% for pollen dumps
   1-3 and 97\% for dumps 4-18.  As set of naturally pollinated marked
   plants was only 38\%, low frequency of pollinator visits apparently
   limited seed production.  Efficacy of infrequent visits is maximized,
   however, because a flower's first pollen releases contain the most
   pollen, but later low-dosage dumps can produce some seeds.  An
   unexpected cost was a higher investment of pericarp per seed in
   low-dosage capsules (130 ng pericarp seed-1 fresh weight) than in
   high-dosage pollinations (only 27 ng pericarp seed-1).  Flower fading in

   reproductive success. A wide range of pollinator taxa visited the

   reproduction also varied among taxa; visits of small native bees
   significantly increased paternal success, while those of honey bees
   reduced male fitness. Only visits by large native bees had discernible
   effects on recipient fecundity, and, overall, fecundity was not limited

   fewer flowers during the experiment, reducing their total seed
   production. In these small populations, postpollination processes (at

   Abundance, relative size of pollen loads, length of visit, and

   recorded.  Forty-nine species of insects were collected, ranging across
   five orders.  Hoverflies (Syrphidae) and native solitary bees

   samples taken from most of these insects contained a majority of pollen
   grains from V. opulus var. opulus (80\%).  Tarnished Plant Bugs moved
   infrequently between plants, and therefore did not pollinate many
   plants.  Non-syrphid flies and beetles carried minimal amounts of
   pollen.  Large syrphid flies each carried approximately 300 grains of
   pollen, but were not very abundant whereas solitary bees were abundant,
   had large pollen loads (far exceeding 300 grains), and moved frequently
   between plants (mean visit length = 54.4 s).  They were therefore the
   most effective of the insect visitors in pollinating V. opulus var.

Volume = {{5}},

Pages = {{75-82}},
Abstract = {{In milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae) pollen is produced in paired packages
   (pollinia) and pollination occurs when a pollinium is inserted by a
   pollinator into a stigmatic chamber.  Previous studies have suggested
   that this mode of pollen delivery results in predominantly long-distance
   pollen dispersal.  This assertion was tested for Asclepias syriaca L.  A
   plant whose pollinia had been labelled with C-14 was placed within a
   large population of milkweeds and a single subject umbel was exposed to
   honey-bee pollinators for 5 days.  Hand pollinations involving another
   umbel on this plant verified that labelled pollinia dispersed to flowers
   within the umbel (geitonogamy), or to flowers on other plants, could be
   detected by scintillation counts.  The labelled plant was at the centre
   of a 6 x 6 m study plot.  Of the 38 insertions on the labelled umbel, 14
   (37\%) were from the labelled umbel itself (geitonogamy).  Thirty
   labelled pollinia were detected in umbels on neighbouring plants within
   the study plot.  It is estimated that few labelled pollinia were
   inserted into flowers outside of the study plot, although the
   possibility of some long-distance dispersal cannot be excluded.  The
   results indicate that much of the pollen dispersal was short distance. 
   This makes pollen dispersal characteristics in this species similar to
   those of non-milkweed species.  Short-distance pollen dispersal can have
   important implications for A. syriaca which reproduces vegetatively and
   for which geitonogamous pollination does not result in fruit set.}},

   three-dimensional space, and the corolla is violet in young flowers and
   blue in mature ones. Blue flowers produced nectar at higher rates and
   received more visits per unit time than violet flowers, which indicates
   that the bees were able to associate reward with flower color. Before
   the beginning of bee activity, blue flowers contained more nectar than
   violet flowers, but during foraging activity they contained lower
   amounts of nectar. This reversal is inconsistent with predictions of
   optimal foraging theory. Bees tended to commence foraging at bottom
   flowers and worked predominantly upwards. Nectar standing crop was
   uncorrelated with flower height before foraging activity and either
   uncorrelated or positively correlated with flower height during foraging
   activity. We relate the positive correlations to the observed ``movement

Abstract = {{We studied bumblebee foraging on two sympatrically and simultaneously
   flowering species, Melampyrum pratense (Scrophulariaceae) and Viscaria
   vulgaris (Caryophyllaceae) during the flowering season of Viscaria in
   south-west Sweden.  We distinguished between healthy and
   Ustilago-infected Viscaria plants.  Both species shared the main insect
   visitor, queens of Bombus hortorum, which collected nectar from both
   species but pollen from Melampyrum only.  The pattern of visitation
   changed over the season : bumblebees preferred Viscaria early on, but
   changed to Melampyrum later in the season, probably because of the
   higher sugar content of Melampyrum nectar and the possibility of
   collecting both nectar and pollen from the same flower.  Pollen
   collecting is probably of increasing importance since the need of pollen
   for the developing larvae will increase with time.  Flowers of Viscaria
   received fewer visits in plots with other species than in pure Viscaria
   plots during one year and received more visits early than late in the
   season during both years.  Melampyrum flowers received similar amounts
   of visits in mixed and pure environments.  They also received more
   visits early than late, although this was probably a result of
   pollinator satiation since Melampyrum became very abundant with time. 
   Ustilago-infected plants received far fewer visits but because of its
   long flowering time the proportion of open flowers receiving visits was
   still high.  Viscaria flowers received significantly more visits than
   flowers of other species when bumblebees made heterospecific flower
   visits from Ustilago-infected plants; thus Ustilago spores were probably
   effectively dispersed from infected to healthy plants by the
   pollinators.  The mechanism behind competition for pollination in this
   system was competition through pollinator preference, since the
   visitation rate to Viscaria actually decreased, but also competition
   through improper pollen transfer (grains of both species were found on
   the bodies of bumblebees) since the incidence of switching between the
   two species increased, probably resulting in an increased misplacement
   of conspecific pollen grains with time.}},

   by selfing were much lower than by natural pollination; in Viscaria

   similar, but seed set per flower was lower by selfing than by natural
   pollination.  Sequential hand pollinations increased seed set in

   important for high seed set in Melampyrum, and number of pollen grains
   seed set in Melampyrum, and number of pollen grains deposited one
   pollination is important for high seed set in Viscaria.  Late flowering
   resulted in the production of fewer seeds in both species, although the
   visitation rate in pure Viscaria stands was sufficient, because of
   limited resources.  Pollen was the limiting resource in Viscaria,
   because hand pollination increased natural seed set.  In Melampyrum
   pollen was limiting in 1988 but so were consumable resources, because
   the seedset decreased with time despite hand pollination.  Pure stands
   of Viscaria had seed set similar to plants in mixed stands (with
   Melampyrum and Rhinanthus), although plants in mixed stands received
   fewer visits.  Many seeds produced late in the season are the result of

   These differ in sizes and structural details of the corolla, level of

   Centris spp. (Anthophoridae): Angelonia hirta was mainly pollinated by
   C. fuscata and A. pubescens by C. hyptidis; A. bisaccata and A.
   hookeriana shared an unidentified species. Several exomalopsine,

   bees introduce their front legs simultaneously into each of the pouches
   and start alternate collecting movements to gather the oil from the
   trichome elaiophores. While doing so, they are forced by projections of
   the corolla floor to press their head under the anthers and stigma,
   whereby pollen is transferred with their frons or clypeus. On account of
   their collector type and behaviour, C.fuscata and C. spec. are not
   specialized to Angelonia but may equally exploit other nonrelated taxa
   for oil, whereas C. hyptidis exhibits oligolecty on A. pubescens. It
   possesses relatively elongate forelegs with padlike collectors suitable
   for sweeping the lipids from the scattered glandular hairs inside the
   divergent spurs of its host. It is the only species that also collects
   pollen (by buzzing) from the oil host. A. hirta and relatives, provided
   with dense elaiophore carpets, are, for their part, adapted to
   ``scraping{''} Centris species with typical oil collectors. Flower and
   bee phenologies, although largely dependent on the irregular rainfalls,
   are not always coincident.}},

Pages = {{169-173}},
Abstract = {{Gene flow by pollen between trees is essential for nut set in commercial
   almond orchards, due to the self-incompatibility of almond cultivars
   used.  A study of gene flow has been carried out in an orchard composed
   of single rows of a ``pollinating{''} cultivar between every double row
   of the most commercially desirable cultivar, Nonpareil.  This
   ``two-to-one{''} planting pattern was repeated throughout the orchard,
   and several ``pollinating{''} cultivars were used in various parts of
   the orchard in an attempt to provide flowers for cross-pollination with
   Nonpareil at all stages of flowering of the latter.  Using isozyme
   markers GPI-2, LAP-1, AAT-1, PGM-1, and PGM-2 and three newly-defined
   isozyme markers for almond - IDH, G6PD, and SDH - it has been shown that
   the gene flow resulting in nut set is quite restricted, taking place
   most strongly between neighboring halves of cross-compatibile pairs of
   trees.  Even that half of a tree facing away from the ``pollinating{''}
   tree has significantly less gene flow to it, while the next tree further
   on has few nuts set by fertilization from the ``pollinating{''} tree
   under consideration.  This result is surprising considering the
   comparatively large distances that the honeybee brought into the orchard
   in large numbers must travel within the orchard.  To explain this
   apparent paradox and the observation that in most cases only a small
   proportion (< 20\%) of flowers set nuts, it is suggested that the
   honeybee predominantly visits only one cultivar, flying along the row of
   the cultivar to do so, and that cross-pollination results from
   accidental or rare visits involving two or more compatible cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale field trials conducted in three governorates in Egypt during
   the 1987 cotton season showed that two or three applications of pink
   bollworm pheromone (formulated as either microcapsules or hollow fibres)
   integrated with one or two applications of conventional insecticides
   gave as good a control of bollworms as did four or five applications of
   the insecticides alone. Estimated yields per feddan in two governorates,
   Fayoum and Dakahlia, averaged from 998 to 2164 kg in the
   pheromone-treated blocks compared to 1076 and 1628 kg in the
   insecticide-treated control blocks. While no significant differences in
   yields were detectable in the Fayoum, an increase of up to 17\% in seed
   cotton weight was estimated in the pheromone-treated fields in Dakahlia.
   This increase in yield was attributed to enhanced hybrid vigour as a
   result of introducing beehives into the pheromone-treated fields during
   the early stages of flowering and fruit setting. The bees, in addition
   to cross-pollinating the cotton flowers, produced over 10 metric tonnes
   of honey. These excellent results were obtained in spite of a general
   increase in pink bollworm infestation throughout the governorate as
   deduced by a comparison of green boll infestation between 1986 and 1987.
   The results by a comparison of green boll infestation between 1986 and
   1987. The results also underlined the importance of early season
   pheromone treatments, since the treatments at Dakahlia went on at an
   earlier stage of crop development than in either Kafr El Sheikh or
   Fayoum.}},

   activity due to the presence of acetylandromedol.  The biological
   significance of acetylandromedol, the main toxic principle from

   revealed strong foldings of the cell membrane on the basal pole of the
   gland cells. Next to the basal lamina, nerve fibres were found with
   great frequency. The central, perinuclear zone of the gland cells was
   rich in cell organelles. The lamellae of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic

   vesicles and tubules of the smooth-surface endoplasmic reticulum (ser)
   were found to be congregated in contiguous compact regions. A
   well-developed and complicated canalicular system was enclosed between
   the rer and ser compartments, presumably serving as a passage for the
   secretory products. Membrane-bound electron-dense granules (secretory
   granules) were also a characteristic finding in the ser. In a small

Abstract = {{It is hypothesized that the original pollination mode in palms was one
   of general entomophily and that cantharophily is a derived mode.  Many
   extant palm species are pollinated by more than one insect group, often
   with predominance of either bees, flies, or beetles.  Certain
   morphological and physiological differentiation patterns of
   inflorescences and flowers are correlated with the predominance of a
   certain insect group, but these modifications are not so specific that
   they exclude other insect groups from visiting and pollinating the
   flowers.  Furthermore, wind is a potential pollen vector.  On the other
   hand, several species are specialized in their pollination for beetles. 
   These cantharophilous species show different syndromes with diurnal or
   nocturnal attraction.  Species exhibiting cantharophily belong to
   primitive groups as well as to more derived ones.  Curculionidae and
   Nitidulidae are the main pollinators of cantharophilous palms, but also
   Scarabaeidae (Dynastinae) or Staphylinidae are involved.  Pollination of
   palm flowers by beetles is closely related with predation.  Palms offer
   food and mating or breeding sites for the beetles.  The
   interrelationship palms/beetles has apparently evolved towards a balance
   between parasitism and successful pollination.  The fact that many palms
   breed their own pollinators and that they additionally can be pollinated
   by the wind, makes them more independent from the surrounding insect
   fauna.  Wind pollination, although derived in palms, probably was a very
   early event in the evolutionary history of the family and occurs today
   in primitive and derived species.  Some small acaulescent savanna palms
   are derived in their habit but not necessarily in their pollination
   modes.  In palms, the inflorescence bracts can function as protective or
   visually attractive organs, and further as breeding sites, pollination
   chambers, or in the aerodynamics of pollen capture.  Nectar secretion
   from external nectaries in the gynoecium in species with free carpels,
   is supposed to be original in palms.  Internal septal nectaries
   apparently are derived.  Most cantharophilous palms do not have any
   nectar secretion.}},
