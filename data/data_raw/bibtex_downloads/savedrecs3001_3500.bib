Abstract = {{Ecologically isolated habitats (e.g., oceanic islands) favor the
   appearance of small assemblages of pollinators, generally characterized
   by highly contrasted life modes (e.g., birds, lizards), and
   opportunistic nectar-feeding behavior. Different life modes should
   promote a low functional equivalence among pollinators, while
   opportunistic nectar feeding would lead to reduced and unpredictable
   pollination effectiveness (PE) compared to more specialized
   nectarivores. Dissecting the quantity (QNC) and quality (QLC) components
   of PE, we studied the opportunistic bird-lizard pollinator assemblage of
   Isoplexis canariensis from the Canary Islands to experimentally evaluate
   these potential characteristics. Birds and lizards showed different
   positions in the PE landscape, highlighting their low functional
   equivalence. Birds were more efficient than lizards due to higher
   visitation frequency (QNC). Adult lizards differed from juveniles in
   effecting a higher production of viable seeds (QLC). The disparate life
   modes of birds and lizards resulted in ample intra- and inter-specific
   PE variance. The main sources of PE variance were visitation frequency
   (both lizards and birds), number of flowers probed (lizards) and
   proportion of viable seeds resulting from a single visit (birds). The
   non-coincident locations of birds and lizards on the PE landscape
   indicate potential constraints for effectiveness. Variations in
   pollinator abundance can result in major effectiveness shifts only if
   QLC is relatively high, while changes in QLC would increase PE
   substantially only at high QNC. The low functional equivalence of
   impoverished, highly contrasted pollinator assemblages may be an early
   diagnostic signal for pollinator extinction potentially driving the
   collapse of mutualistic services.}},

Abstract = {{The observation that the flowers of Anemone nemorosa offer nectar to
   pollinating bee-flies (Bombylius major) prompted this investigation into
   the site of nectar secretion and nectary tissue. To allow comparison on
   a broader basis, other nectar-secreting pollen flowers of the
   Ranunculaceae and Magnolia (Magnoliaceae) were included in the analysis.
   The contradictory information available on the function of the
   mouthparts of bee-flies during nectar and pollen feeding motivated us to
   investigate the proboscis structure in detail by SEM. Our investigations
   in Anemone nemorosa proved, for the first time, nectar secretion in the
   genus Anemone s.s. (i.e. other than the Pulsatilla group) and in
   addition, within the family, a new type of a carpellary nectary. The
   latter is an epithelial nectary involving the whole epidermis of the
   ovarian part of the carpel. The nectary of Anemone nemorosa resembles
   that of Magnolia (e.g. M. stellata), which we re-investigated. In both
   Anemone nemorosa and Magnolia stellata, nectar production is limited
   mainly to the female phase of the proterogynous flower. In this way, the
   attractiveness of the flower is also assured in the non-pollen
   presenting phase. Especially in Magnolia, with its numerous carpels
   arranged on a cone-like receptacle, the economic disadvantage of a
   choricarpous- compared to a coenocarpous-gynoecium is compensated for by
   nectar secretion by each carpel. When licking up the nectar droplets
   from the carpel surfaces, contact of the insect's body with each stigma
   may be achieved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The alarming reports from around the world on pollinator population
   declines made the understanding of the effects of shared pollination
   service on biodiversity into one of the most urgent goals in nature
   conservation, both for the scientists and managers. The classic
   field-based methodology which is commonly used in such studies, has
   three major problems which limit the researchers' ability to further
   understand the nature of plant-pollinator dynamics: (1) Natural systems
   do not allow for a full factorial controlled studies of specific
   characteristics and traits of both plants and pollinators, because of
   many confounding effects which are usually unknown. Furthermore, (2)
   Many of the interactions between plants and pollinators are indirect,
   via their reciprocal effect on shared pollination services and therefore
   difficult to detect in the field. Finally, and (3) though plant
   composition and abundance may be manipulated in the field, it is almost
   impossible to manipulate pollinator populations, strongly restricting
   researchers' ability to thoroughly understand the specific pollinator
   characteristics which created the observed effects. Therefore,
   simulation tools are needed that can address this complexity on one
   hand, and allow to identify potential research directions for targeted
   experiments on the other hand. Here, we present EcoSimInGrid, a
   spatially explicit agent-based simulator for investigating effects of
   shared pollination services on plant communities. EcoSimInGrid can be
   used to represent complex spatio-temporal interactions among ecological
   entities of different trophic levels, to investigate effects of plant
   traits, spatial distribution and pollinator behavior on shared
   pollination services and to analyze the relative effects of shared
   pollination and habitat productivity in shaping community diversity.
   Features like capability to model large ecosystems with tens of
   thousands of plants and pollinators, graphical user interface, flexible
   parameter configuration, comprehensive data output and fast speed
   parallel computing make EcoSimInGrid a welcome addition to the
   ecological modeling world. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation
   for pollinating insect communities, particularly for the neotropical key
   pollinator group of stingless bees. Most studies on bees have defined
   habitat fragments as remnant patches of floral hosts or forests,
   overlooking the nesting needs of bees. Their conclusion is that habitat
   fragmentation is broadly deleterious; however, there are contrasting
   results in the literature. Insightful studies on habitat fragmentation
   and bees should consider fragmentation, alteration and loss of nesting
   habitats-not just patches of forage plants -, as well as the
   permeability of the surrounding matrix to interpatch movement. Here we
   investigated the effects of fragmentation caused by urbanization on
   stingless bee species' composition and richness, as well as the
   permeability of the surrounding matrix. We collected bees from flowering
   plants and recorded phytosociological variables of five forest remnants
   (ranging from 64 ha to 900 ha) in southeastern Brazil. Large fragments
   did not contain more species per unit area than smaller ones; in fact,
   we found more species in small fragments, most of which were generalist
   bees. The presence of more habitat generalist stingless bee species was
   also correlated to the structure of vegetation in these fragments. In
   conclusion, the quality of the habitat within a fragment (structure of
   vegetation) as well as the quality of the matrix has a direct relation
   to the bee species composition. This can be seen in the direct
   relationship between structural diversity of the environment and age of
   the fragments. The matrix that holds the most recent fragments, probably
   due to the sprawl of the city, is more heterogeneous than the one with
   the oldest fragments. The most heterogeneous matrices have a certain
   balance between the trees, buildings and bare soil or herbaceous
   vegetation coverage, making the array less impermeable to bees.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Stingless bees are a diverse group of highly eusocial tropical bees and
   potential pollinators of natural and crop environments. Nevertheless,
   large-scale breeding for agricultural purposes still needs development.
   A bottleneck is the small number of queens generally found in the
   colonies of most species. A proposed solution is to develop in vitro
   rearing of stingless bee queens, which includes a technical support due
   to the massive liquid feeding of larvae. In this study, we tested the
   efficacy of in vitro queen-rearing techniques in terms of queen size,
   survival, and fecundity. We found that humidity must be kept high during
   the first 6 days of larval development and reduced thereafter to 75 \%.
   In the most effective treatments, we obtained up to 97.9 \% queen
   survival. We also found that queens not different in size from natural
   queens could be produced if sufficient larval food is provided. In vitro
   queens were able to mate and lay viable eggs. This methodology is also
   useful for several research appliances, like pesticide effect on bees,
   pollen quality effect in caste determination, and the use of genetic
   sources for selection programs, among others.}},

Abstract = {{Many factors affect bee diversity and abundance, and knowledge of these
   is crucial for maintaining healthy bee communities. However, there are
   few means to fully evaluate the status of bee communities; most are
   based on monitoring species richness and abundance and do not consider
   the diverse life histories of bees. We propose that functional diversity
   of bee communities offers a more consistent means of evaluation and
   suggest that cleptoparasitic bees in particular show much promise as
   indicator taxa. Cleptoparasitic bees play a stabilising role within bee
   communities. They represent the apex of bee communities and are the
   first guild to respond to disturbances, are easily distinguished as such
   and are diverse enough to be representative of entire bee communities.
   The diversity and abundance of cleptoparasites in relation to all bees
   is indicative of the status of the total bee community, and monitoring
   them should form an integral part of assessing bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed studies of the behavior of pollinators allow insights into
   pollination mechanisms and may indicate which pollinators are more
   efficient for a particular plant species. Our aim was to evaluate if
   Melipona fasciculata is an efficient pollinator of eggplant (Solanum
   melongena L., Solanaceae) in greenhouses. We analyzed (1) the colony
   foraging pattern of M. fasciculata in greenhouses, (2) the behavior of
   bees during the visits to flowers, and (3) fruit set and fruit quality
   after different pollination treatments (hand pollination: autogamy,
   geitonogamy, xenogamy; bee pollination). Our results show that M.
   fasciculata is an efficient pollinator of eggplants and, consequently,
   may be a viable alternative to bumblebees in Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are in decline potentially leading to reduced pollination and hence
   production of insect-pollinated crops in many countries. It is however
   still unclear whether the consequences of pollinator shortages differ
   among countries with different environmental and societal conditions.
   Here, we calculated economic gains attributed to insect (particularly
   bee) pollination( EVIP) as well as their contribution to the total value
   of crop production (vulnerability), and analyzed their temporal trends
   and inter-annual variability from 1991 to 2009 for each country of the
   European Union (EU). To understand which factors drive country-specific
   differences in pollinator dependency and stability of insect-dependent
   crop yields, we further asked whether EVIP, vulnerability and stability
   of yields were influenced by a country's climate, the number of wild bee
   species and/or managed honeybee hives per country, and (agricultural)
   gross domestic product (GDP).
   Across Europe, crop pollination by insects accounted for 14.6 {[}+/-
   3.3] billion EUR annually (EVIP), which equaled 12 (+/- 0.8)\% of the
   total economic value of annual crop production. Gains strongly varied
   among countries. Both EVIP and vulnerability increased (and the
   inter-annual variation of vulnerability decreased) significantly from
   the colder northern to the warmer Mediterranean EU countries, in
   parallel with increases in the number of wild bee species. Across years,
   economic importance of pollination increased in all but three EU
   countries. Apples were the most important insect-pollinated crop in the
   EU, accounting for 16\% of the EU's total EVIP. Our results show that
   whereas dependency on insect pollination increased from the colder north
   to the warmer south, variation in economic gain from insect pollination
   decreased, indicating that Mediterranean countries had more stable
   yields of pollinator-dependent crops across years and thus more reliable
   gains from pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of flowering plants, including many rare and threatened
   species, are pollinated by animals, but little is known of pollination
   and breeding systems of many endangered species. Polemonium caeruleum
   (Polemoniaceae) is a red-listed species and is regarded as dichogamous,
   self-compatible and bee pollinated. However, some studies show that it
   is visited by a vast assemblage of anthophilous insects from many
   taxonomic orders and that breeding systems vary greatly between closely
   related taxa of this genus. Over a period of 3years we investigated
   breeding system, dichogamy, nectar secretion and composition, insect
   visitations and pollen loads in flowers of P.caeruleum in north-eastern
   Poland to determine whether the reproductive biology of the plant
   explains its rarity. Contrary to published data, our study plants were
   self-incompatible and showed a high degree of outcrossing. Our
   experimental work confirmed the occurrence of protandry in this species,
   revealed that nectar is sucrose-dominant and proline-rich and, for the
   first time for Polemoniaceae, that nectar secretion and nectar sugar
   concentration in flowers of P.caeruleum is female-biased. Although
   flowers were visited by at least 39 species of insects from five
   taxonomic orders, overall the plant exhibited many characters associated
   with bee pollination, and analysis of insect performance showed that
   bumblebees and honeybees are the key pollinators; occasionally
   hoverflies and butterflies may also be involved. We conclude that, in
   terms of pollination system, P.caeruleum demonstrates high apparent
   generalization, but low realized generalization, and is a functional
   specialist, as most pollinators belong to a single functional group
   (guild). Its conservation status, at least in our study population,
   cannot be explained in terms of the biological properties of its
   breeding or pollination systems; rather, the present decline of the
   species is caused by habitat loss. However, if this process and
   bumblebee decline in Europe continue, P.caeruleum populations may
   diminish in numbers and density and, owing to the self-incompatibility
   of the species, quickly become severely pollen-limited, thereby
   accelerating further local extinctions.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{1. The way in which species interactions are altered at habitat edges is
   an emerging concern in conservation biology, with some theories
   predicting edge-affected habitats to be less stable and exhibit
   intensified species interactions relative to interior habitats. One
   little-studied interaction is phoresy, where an individual of one
   species attaches itself to an individual of another species for the
   purpose of dispersal. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important crop
   pollinators around the world and at least 10 species of phoretic mites
   have been associated with various bumble bee species.
   2. Here, we investigated changes in the abundance of the introduced
   European B. terrestris across forest-grassland edges in the Southern
   Alps of New Zealand, and concomitant changes in the phoretic mite loads
   on these mobile pollinators.
   3. Bumble bees penetrated up to 250 m inside forest fragments, with
   abundance declining with distance from the anthropogenic matrix habitat.
   By contrast, phoretic mite loads increased towards the forest interior.
   Overall, phoretic mite loads on B. terrestris were greatest in the
   forest canopy, suggesting that this species interaction is intensified
   in natural habitat compared to that in the anthropogenic land use
   surrounding forest fragments.
   4. Our data indicate that phoretic loads on bumble bees are elevated in
   forest canopies. The functional significance of altered bumble bee -
   mite interactions for pollination services at forest edges remains to be
   tested.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies have shown that habitat complexity is an important
   factor for the dynamic and stability of interacting species. However, it
   is not known how the habitat complexity may affect the tolerance of
   wasp-flower interactions to local extinction. Based on this perspective,
   in this study, we aimed to compare the tolerance of wasp flower visiting
   guild to local extinction in two different types of vegetation (Riparian
   Forest and Rocky Grassland). Through observations made during one year,
   we verified that the structure of the plant-wasp interaction network
   differed between the two areas, as well as that the robustness to
   cumulative extinctions had different patterns. The simulations of
   cumulative removal of species showed that the network in the Riparian
   Forest is more robust against the removal of both plants and wasps than
   that network in Rocky Grassland, since their extinction curves declined
   more slowly. Therefore, in our study area, we demonstrate that social
   wasp-plant interactions in areas with lower structural complexity are
   less tolerant to extinction (i.e. more fragile). We therefore suggest
   that studies that aim at biodiversity conservation should focus not only
   in areas where diversity is high, but also in area with lower species
   richness for the conservation of ecological roles within communities.}},

Abstract = {{Although bees form a key pollinator suite for flowering plants, very few
   studies have examined the evolutionary radiation of non-domesticated
   bees over human time-scales. This is surprising given the importance of
   bees for crop pollination and the effect of humans in transforming
   ecosystems via agriculture. In the Pacific, where the bee fauna appears
   depauperate, their importance as pollinators is not clear, particularly
   in Fiji where species diversity is even lower than neighbouring
   archipelagos. Here we explore the radiation of halictine bees in Fiji
   using phylogenetic analyses of mtDNA COI sequence data. Our analyses
   indicate the existence of several `deep' clades whose divergences are
   close to the crown node, along with a highly derived `broom' clade
   showing very high haplotype diversity, and mostly limited to low-lying
   agricultural regions. This derived clade is very abundant, whereas the
   more basal clades were relatively rare. Although nearly all haplotype
   diversity in Fijian Hornalictus comprises synonymous substitutions, a
   small number of amino acid changes are associated with the major clades,
   including the hyper-diverse clade. Analyses of haplotype lineage
   accumulation show a steep increase in selectively neutral COI haplotypes
   corresponding to the emergence of this `broom' clade. We explore three
   possible scenarios for this dramatic increase: (i) a key change in
   adaptedness to the environment, (ii) a large-scale extinction event, or
   (iii) a dramatic increase in suitable habitats leading to rapid
   population expansion. Using estimated mutation rates of mitochondrial
   DNA in other invertebrates, we argue that Homalictus first colonised the
   Fijian archipelago in the middle-late Pleistocene, and the rapid
   accumulation of haplotypes in the hyper-diverse clade occurred in the
   Holocene, but prior to recorded human presence in the Fijian region. Our
   results indicate that bees have not been important pollinators of Fijian
   ecosystems until very recent times. Post-Pleistocene climate change and
   anthropogenic effects on Fijian ecosystems are likely to have greatly
   transformed pollinator suites from the conditions when those ecosystems
   were first being assembled. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Convergent evolution of floral signals underlies the success of

Abstract = {{The great majority of plant species in the tropics require animals to
   achieve pollination, but the exact role of floral signals in attraction
   of animal pollinators is often debated. Many plants provide a floral
   reward to attract a guild of pollinators, and it has been proposed that
   floral signals of non-rewarding species may converge on those of
   rewarding species to exploit the relationship of the latter with their
   pollinators. In the orchid family (Orchidaceae), pollination is almost
   universally animal-mediated, but a third of species provide no floral
   reward, which suggests that deceptive pollination mechanisms are
   prevalent. Here, we examine floral colour and shape convergence in
   Neotropical plant communities, focusing on certain food-deceptive
   Oncidiinae orchids (e. g. Trichocentrum ascendens and Oncidium
   nebulosum) and rewarding species of Malpighiaceae. We show that the
   species from these two distantly related families are often more similar
   in floral colour and shape than expected by chance and propose that a
   system of multifarious floral mimicry-a form of Batesian mimicry that
   involves multiple models and is more complex than a simple one model-one
   mimic system-operates in these orchids. The same mimetic pollination
   system has evolved at least 14 times within the species-rich Oncidiinae
   throughout the Neotropics. These results help explain the extraordinary
   diversification of Neotropical orchids and highlight the complexity of
   plant-animal interactions.}},

Title = {{Divergent genetic mechanisms underlie reversals to radial floral
   symmetry from diverse zygomorphic flowered ancestors}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Malpighiaceae possess flowers with a unique bilateral symmetry
   (zygomorphy), which is a hypothesized adaptation associated with
   specialization on neotropical oil bee pollinators. Gene expression of
   two representatives of the CYC2 lineage of floral symmetry TCP genes,
   CYC2A and CYC2B, demarcate the adaxial (dorsal) region of the flower in
   the characteristic zygomorphic flowers of most Malpighiaceae. Several
   clades within the family, however, have independently lost their
   specialized oil bee pollinators and reverted to radial flowers
   (actinomorphy) like their ancestors. Here, we investigate CYC2
   expression associated with four independent reversals to actinomorphy.
   We demonstrate that these reversals are always associated with
   alteration of the highly conserved CYC2 expression pattern observed in
   most New World (NW) Malpighiaceae. In NW Lasiocarpus and Old World (OW)
   Microsteria, the expression of CYC2-like genes has expanded to include
   the ventral region of the corolla. Thus, the pattern of gene expression
   in these species has become radialized, which is comparable to what has
   been reported in the radial flowered legume clade Cadia. In striking
   contrast, in NW Psychopterys and OW Sphedamnocarpus, CYC2-like
   expression is entirely absent or at barely detectable levels. This is
   more similar to the pattern of CYC2 expression observed in radial
   flowered Arabidopsis. These results collectively indicate that,
   regardless of geographic distribution, reversals to similar floral
   phenotypes in this large tropical angiosperm clade have evolved via
   different genetic changes from an otherwise highly conserved
   developmental program.}},

Title = {{Prolonged postdiapause: Influence on some indicators of carbohydrate and
   lipid metabolism of the red mason bee, Osmia rufa}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Bees of the genus Osmia are being used in crop pollination at an
   increasing rate. However, a short life expectancy of adult individuals
   limits the feasibility of their use. Cocoons of the red mason bee, Osmia
   rufa L. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), can be stored at 4 degrees C in a
   postdiapause state, and adult bees can be used for pollination outside
   their natural flight period. The period of storage in this form has an
   unfavorable influence on the survival rate, life expectancy, and
   fertility of the bee. It was suggested that the negative results are
   connected with exhaustion of energy reserves. To test this hypothesis,
   the present study examined the contents of protein, carbohydrates,
   lipids, and the activities of some enzymes, and their degradation in red
   mason bees that emerged in spring according to their biological clock
   and in summer after elongated diapause. It was found that postdiapause
   artificially elongated by 3 months caused significant decreases in body
   weight, total sugar, glycogen, lipids, and protein content in O. rufa.
   Glucose level was highest in bees that emerged in the summer, which was
   coincident with increased activities of maltase and trehalase. The
   activities of sucrase and cellobiase were not changed, while amylase
   activity was considerably decreased. The activities of triacylglycerols
   lipase and C2, C4, C10 carboxylesterases were highest in bees that
   emerged in July. Low temperatures restrict O. rufa emergence, and during
   prolonged postdiapause, metabolic processes lead to significant
   reductions of structural and energetic compounds.}},

Title = {{Proximity to agriculture alters abundance and community composition of

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic modifications of the landscape, such as agriculture, are
   widespread globally and can reduce native biodiversity and homogenize
   communities by decreasing variation in species composition across sites.
   Partitioning anthropogenic impacts among species that have positive
   versus negative effects on plants may improve our ability to forecast
   the ecological and evolutionary consequences of these alterations in
   communities. Here, we manipulated the distance of populations of a wild
   sunflower species (Helianthus annuus texanus) to fields of its
   domesticated relative (crop sunflowers, H. annuus) and contrasted
   subsequent shifts in the abundance and community composition of
   mutualists (pollinators) and antagonists (seed predators, folivores) of
   H. a. texanus. With some exceptions, populations of H. a. texanus near
   crop sunflowers supported higher numbers of pollinators than those far
   from crop sunflowers. In contrast, in the majority of cases, populations
   of H. a. texanus supported more seed predators when located far from
   crop sunflowers. Folivore damage to plants was greater far from crop
   sunflowers, and was never greater near crop sunflowers. Contrary to the
   prediction that proximity to agriculture homogenizes community
   composition, we found beta-diversity of pollinators (species turnover
   between populations) was greater near crop sunflowers. Our results
   demonstrate that mutualists and antagonists of a wild plant species
   respond differently to the proximity of a related crop species,
   indicating the potential for both altered population dynamics and
   complex selection pressures on wild species in agricultural landscapes.}},

   total of 614 orchid-bee males were collected using aromatic traps,
   belonging to four genera and 15 species. Twenty-five female specimens
   belonging to two genera and at least three species were collected on
   flowers. Eulaema (Apeulaema) nigrita Lepeletier, 1841 was the most
   abundant species (50\% of collected specimens), followed by Euglossa
   (Euglossa) truncata Rebelo \& Moure, 1996 (28\%). Cineole was the most

Abstract = {{Understanding the natural mating behavior (self- or cross-pollination)

   strategy. The objective of this study was to measure the rate of self-
   and cross-pollination in watermelon {[}Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.)
   Matsum. \& Nakai] using the dominant gene Sp (Spotted leaves and fruit)
   as a marker. The experiment consisted of two studies and was a split
   plot in a randomized complete block design with 3 years (2009 to 2011)
   and four locations (Clinton, Kinston, Oxford, Lewiston, NC). For the
   intercrossing study, whole plots were the two spacings (1.2 x 0.3 m and
   1.2 x 0.6 m) with four replications in 2010. For the inbreeding study,
   whole plots were two equidistant spacings (3 x 3 m and 6 x 6 m) with
   four replications in 2009 to 2011. Cultivars Allsweet and Mickylee were
   subplots within each whole plot. In the inbreeding study, spacing and
   year had a significant effect on the rate of self-pollination, which was
   moderate (47\% and 54\%, respectively) when watermelon plants were
   trained in a spiral and spaced 3 x 3 m or 6 x 6 m apart. Spacing and
   cultivar did not have a significant effect on cross-pollination in the
   intercrossing study. Closely spaced watermelon plants (1.2 x 0.3 m and
   1.2 x 0.6 m) had low natural outcrossing rate (31\% and 35\%,
   respectively) and was not adequate to intercross families. However,
   breeders should consider the amount of self-pollination in watermelon to
   calculate the estimates of component of genetic variances.}},

   rates upon oxidation of malate, glutamate, glutamate + malate, or
   succinate were very low. At variance with flight muscle mitochondria of
   a number of other insects reported earlier, B. terrestris mitochondria
   did not show high rates of respiration supported by oxidation of
   proline. The maximal respiration rates were observed upon oxidation of
   alpha-glycerophosphate. Bumblebee mitochondria are capable of
   maintaining high membrane potential in the absence of added respiratory
   substrates, which was completely dissipated by the addition of rotenone,
   suggesting high amount of intramitochondrial NAD-linked oxidative
   substrates. Pyruvate and alpha-glycerophosphate appear to be the optimal
   oxidative substrates for maintaining the high rates of oxidative
   metabolism of the bumblebee mitochondria.}},

Abstract = {{Even though Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica Linnaeus, Rubiaceae) can
   self-pollinate, bees are important pollinators, without which there is
   lower fruit quality and yield. We studied bee diversity in coffee
   agroecosystems in Costa Rica during two coffee flowering seasons (2005
   and 2006). Malaise traps were used as a passive sampling method to
   collect bees during coffee blooms. We collected 1012 bee individuals
   from three different site types: nonagricultural fields and shaded and
   unshaded coffee farms. Unshaded coffee farms had significantly higher
   species richness (S) and number of bee individuals (n) than did the
   shaded coffee farms and nonagricultural sites. Overall bee diversity did
   not differ among site types but evenness (J') was significantly lower in
   unshaded coffee farms. Using a more detailed community analysis, there
   was a significant association between functional groups and habitat type
   with more species and individuals of small-bodied ground-nesting bees
   (Lasioglossum (Dialictus) Robertson) associated with unshaded coffee
   farms. A large proportion (49\%) of bees collected were of this
   subgenus, which was never before reported as common in coffee
   agroecosystems. Further studies should establish whether Dialictus is
   important in coffee pollination. We propose strategies involving
   conservation of native bees through simple habitat management for
   small-scale coffee farms that may improve crop quality and quantity.}},

Abstract = {{Adult drone flies (Syrphidae: Eristalis spp.) resemble male honeybees in
   appearance. Their immature stages are commonly known as rat-tailed
   maggots due to the presence of a very long anal segment and a telescopic
   breathing tube. The larvae are associated with decaying organic material
   in liquid or semi-liquid media, as in the case of other saprophagous
   eristalines. Biological and morphological data were obtained from both
   laboratory cultures and sampling in the field. Drone flies are important
   pollinators for wild flowers and crops. In fact, mass rearing protocols
   of Eristalis species are being developed to be used as efficient
   alternative pollinators. However, deeper knowledge of larval morphology
   and biology is required to improve artificial rearing. The production
   quality control of artificial rearing must manage the consistency and
   reliability of the production output avoiding, for example contamination
   with similar species. This article presents the first description of the
   larva and puparium of E. similis, including a comparative morphological
   study of preimaginal stages of the anthropophilic and ubiquitous
   European hoverfly species E. tenax. Scanning electron microscopy has
   been used for the first time to describe larvae and puparia of both
   species. Moreover, the preimaginal morphology of E. similis has been
   compared with all known descriptions of the genus Eristalis. The main
   diagnostic characters of the preimaginal stages of E. similis are the
   morphology of the anterior spiracles (shape of clear area and
   arrangement of facets) and pupal spiracles (length, shape, and
   arrangement of tubercles). (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the light of rapid losses of biodiversity worldwide, it has become
   more important than ever to study the factors that ensure the continued
   existence of diverse ecological communities. Whereas the
   diversity-enhancing effects of antagonistic interactions are relatively
   well understood, much less is known about the contribution of
   mutualistic interactions to biodiversity maintenance. This study
   assesses the influence of mutualistic interactions with pollinators on
   the diversity of plant communities with alternative means of
   reproduction besides animal pollination. In contrast to a recent more
   general model of plant-animal mutualisms, the results of our simulations
   suggest that interactions with pollinators do not generally promote
   plant diversity, irrespective of the structure of the interaction
   network. Despite a potential for increased plant species richness
   through the positive effect of pollinators on plant birth rates, species
   richness was mostly negatively affected by the presence of pollinators
   because existing abundance asymmetries were amplified by animal
   pollination. Our results imply that for plant communities with
   alternative means of reproduction, the loss of pollinators will usually
   not lead to decreased diversity. However, whereas the immediate effects
   of pollinator loss on plant community composition may be negligible, the
   long-term population genetic consequences are likely to be severe.}},

Abstract = {{Parasites and mutualists can wield great influence on the fitness of
   social organisms, yet the effect that the host's social structure has on
   the evolution of parasites, commensals, and mutualists (collectively
   referred to here as symbionts) is poorly known. Evolutionary theory
   suggests that host social structure may select for more cooperative
   symbiont strains in comparison to symbionts of solitary hosts. We
   compared the productivity of one social and one solitary bee species
   (Halictus ligatus and Augochlora pura) in the family Halictidae with and
   without the presence of their nematode symbionts (Acrostichus halicti
   and Acrostichus puri, respectively). We measured the number of offspring
   produced, the number of cells provisioned, and nesting activity (for Au.
   pura) to test the hypothesis that symbionts specific to a social host
   exhibit greater cooperation than symbionts specific to a solitary host.
   Infected and uninfected nests of both species did not differ in any
   fitness estimates indicating that: (1) Acrostichus species are
   commensals, or at least lack large fitness effects on their hosts, and
   (2) the transition from association with a solitary host to association
   with a social host that lives in small colonies does not have detectable
   effects on the evolution of conflict and cooperation in this system.
   This is the first comparative study to test the idea that host social
   structure may influence the evolution of symbionts; future work should
   compare closely related mutualists and parasites of more advanced
   eusocial insects to mutualists and parasites of solitary insects.}},

Abstract = {{The arrival of exotic pollinators to new habitats may introduce new
   patterns of floral preference and foraging behavior that modify the
   structure of the resident plant-pollinator community. The aim of this
   paper is to examine the potential impact of the exotic bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris on the pollination service provided by the native pollinator
   assemblage of the herb Mimulus luteus. The study was performed in a
   high-elevation locality in the Chilean Andes during the summer seasons
   of 2010, 2011, and 2012. We recorded visitation rate, and the number of
   pollen grains transported on the body of B. terrestris and native
   pollinators and the pollen deposition on the stigmas of M. luteus.
   Pollinator effectiveness (pollen deposited x visitation rate) was
   compared among species. Results revealed that B. terrestris was an
   inefficient pollinator, due to the low amount of pollen delivered on
   stigmas and the low and intermittent visitation rate across years. The
   parallel inter-annual variation in the visitation rate of B. terrestris
   and the native bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii suggests that the integration
   of B. terrestris had no important consequences for the congeneric
   species. In general, B. terrestris accounted for a low proportion of the
   pollen transfer in M. luteus, reaching 4.6 \% in 2010, absence of effect
   in 2011, and 0.01 \% in 2012. These results suggest that in spite of
   being a quickly spreading species in Chile, B. terrestris is still in
   the initial phase of invasion in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Because patchiness of food sources or nesting opportunities frequently
   limits gene flow, specialists often exhibit distinct population
   structures in fragmented habitats. We studied the influence of habitat
   fragmentation on population structure in the solitary bee Andrena vaga,
   an early spring species that nests exclusively in sandy soil and feeds
   strictly on willows (Salix spp.). Because the homogenous habitat of the
   German floodplains, where the species was studied previously, resulted
   in the species' weak population structure, we expected more structured
   populations in central Europe, where the sandy soils essential for
   nesting are highly fragmented. We analysed 387 females from 21
   localities in the Czech Republic and Slovakia using nine microsatellite
   loci, and we inferred population structure using landscape genetics and
   Bayesian clustering methods. Contrary to our expectations, habitat
   fragmentation did not result in increased genetic isolation at the
   localities; however, two differentiated groups of localities, separated
   by a wide clinal zone of admixture, were detected within the study area.
   The observed pattern suggests that dispersive ability of A. vaga
   compensates the species dependence on unstable fragmented habitats. We
   propose that the population structure may mirror a secondary contact
   formed by the expansion of two populations that had been separated in
   the past. We emphasise the necessity of knowing the studied species'
   population history before making conclusions concerning correlations
   between habitat and population structure, especially in areas of known
   suture zones created by the secondary contact of populations expanding
   from separate refugia.}},

Abstract = {{To minimize interspecific pollination, it has been suggested that pollen
   is placed on different parts of a pollinator's body corresponding to the
   conspecific location of pollen pickup by the stigma.
   Although Pedicularis is regarded as a classic example of
   pollinator-mediated floral isolation, such reciprocal pollen placement
   has not been demonstrated experimentally. This leads us to question
   previous observations of pollen release in Pedicularis species.
   Here, we show that pollen grains are released from the tip, rather than
   the basal opening, of the galea (the hoodlike upper lip of the corolla)
   in eight nectarless Pedicularis species, mimicking pollen release from
   poricidal anthers. We used safranin-stained pollen within anthers to
   track pollen placement in three Pedicularis species, and showed that
   pollen was deposited on numerous parts of the bumblebee's body. However,
   fluorescent powder placed on the stigmas to detect the contact location
   on the bumblebee's body was deposited mainly on the major position of
   pollen placement in each of the three species.
   Such segregation of pollen placement and pickup between species sharing
   the same pollinator probably helps to reduce reproductive interference,
   but the positions of pollen placement and stigma contact on the
   bumblebee's body were not as precise as previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{1. Chemical protection of plants against herbivory is a well-studied
   phenomenon. However, chemical protection of floral rewards remains
   relatively unexplored. As with herbivore-plant interactions, toxic
   rewards may impact generalist and specialist foragers in different ways.
   2. This study focuses on the toxic plant Aconitum septentrionale
   (Ranunculaceae). This plant is visited by specialist and generalist
   bumblebees. Alkaloid concentrations and profiles for the different parts
   of A. septentrionale were analysed to detect a potential chemical
   toxicity of floral rewards. In the same way, sequestration of alkaloids
   was tested on a pollen specialist species Bombus consobrinus and a
   generalist species Bombus wurflenii.
   3. A liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   method was developed to discriminate 16 major compounds in the plant.
   These alkaloids were present in all parts of the plant, but in different
   ratios. The concentration was high in the roots but also in pollen,
   providing evidence of chemical protection of this reward. By contrast,
   nectar had the lowest concentration of alkaloids. Only six alkaloids
   were detected in B. consobrinus tissues, at trace levels. For the
   generalist bumblebee B. wurflenii, no traces of alkaloids were detected.
   4. Lappaconitine was the major alkaloid compound in pollen, nectar and
   B. consobrinus tissues. Low accumulation of alkaloids in B. consobrinus
   tissues could be an ecological advantage for this specialist species in
   terms of pathogen and predatory avoidance.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities are rapidly changing ecosystems, landscapes and
   ecosystem service provision, yet there remain significant gaps in our
   understanding of the spatial ecology of ecosystem services. These gaps
   hinder our ability to manage landscapes effectively for multiple
   ecosystem services. In particular, we do not fully understand how
   changes in landscape connectivity affect ecosystem service provision,
   despite theory suggesting that connectivity is important. Here, we
   perform a semi-quantitative review of the literature that investigates
   how landscape connectivity affects the provision of specific ecosystem
   services. The vast majority of studies, including reviews, models, and
   field studies, suggest that decreased connectivity will have negative
   effects on ecosystem service provision. However, only 15 studies
   provided empirical evidence of these effects. Average effect sizes from
   these 15 studies suggest negative effects of connectivity loss on
   pollination and pest regulation. We identify a number of significant
   gaps in the connectivity-ecosystem services literature, including: a
   lack of multiple service studies, which precludes identification of
   trade-offs between services as connectivity changes; few studies that
   directly measure organism movement and its effects on ecosystem
   services; and few empirical studies that investigate the importance of
   abiotic flows on service provision. We propose that future research
   should aim to understand how different aspects of connectivity affect
   ecosystem service provision; which services are most influenced by
   connectivity; and how connectivity influences how humans access and
   benefit from ecosystem services. Studies that answer these questions
   will advance our understanding of connectivity-ecosystem service
   provision relationships and allow for better ecosystem and landscape
   management and restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Protecting semi-natural grasslands may through spill-over benefit
   species richness and abundance of flower-visiting insects in linear
   habitats, such as uncultivated field boundaries, in agricultural
   landscapes. However, whether local diversity increases both with
   decreasing distance from potential source habitats and increasing
   landscape heterogeneity is poorly known due to a general lack of studies
   replicated at the landscape scale. We analysed if local assemblages of
   bumblebees, butterflies and hoverflies in linear uncultivated habitats
   increased with increasing distance to the nearest semi-natural grassland
   in 12 replicated landscapes along a gradient of landscape heterogeneity
   in Scania, Southern Sweden. Species richness and abundance of bumblebees
   and butterflies, but not hoverflies, decreased with increasing distance
   to semi-natural grasslands, but none of these groups were related to
   increasing landscape heterogeneity. Further analyses on trait-specific
   groups revealed significant decreases in the abundance of sedentary and
   grassland specialist butterflies with increasing distance to assumed
   source populations, whereas this was not the case concerning mobile
   species and grassland generalists. The abundance of all bumblebee trait
   groups decreased with increasing distance to semi-natural grasslands,
   but only some species (those nesting above ground, with long colony
   cycles and with small colony sizes) also increased with increasing
   landscape heterogeneity. We conclude that local species assemblages of
   flower-visiting insects in linear habitat elements were mainly affected
   by the occurrence of nearby semi-natural grasslands. In order to
   conserve diverse assemblages of flower-visiting insects, including the
   ecological services they provide, it is important to conserve
   semi-natural grasslands dispersed throughout agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar spurs have an important role in floral evolution and
   plant-pollinator coadaptation. The flowers of some species possess spurs
   curving into a circle. However, it is unclear whether spur circle
   diameter is under direct selection pressure from different sources, such
   as pollinators and nectar robbers. In this study, we quantified
   selection on some floral traits, such as spur circle diameter in
   Impatiens oxyanthera (Balsaminaceae) using phenotypic selection analysis
   and compared the relative importance of pollinators and nectar robbers
   as selective agents using mediation analysis. The study showed that
   pollinators caused significant selection on corolla length, spur
   curvature and spur circle diameter while nectar robbers only imposed
   strong selection on spur circle diameter. Pollinators favored flowers
   with large corolla, curly spurs and large spur circle while nectar
   robbers preferred flowers with small spur circle. More pollinator visits
   resulted in higher female reproductive success, while robbery reduced
   female fitness. Conflicting selection on spur traits from pollinators
   and nectar robbers was not found. Mediation analysis showed that
   selection on floral traits through nectar robbing was stronger than
   selection through pollination. The results suggested that pollinators
   and nectar robbers jointly mediated the directional selection for large
   spur circle, and nectar robbers caused stronger selection than
   pollinators on floral traits.}},

Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{35-40}},

Abstract = {{Biotic interactions play an important role on the organization and
   persistence of biodiversity. Unnatural modifications of landscape
   structure such as habitat loss and fragmentation can isolate populations
   and disrupt biological communities, affecting species survival and
   altering the complex set of relationships between plants and
   pollinators. Plant-pollinator interaction networks have characteristics
   such asymmetry and nestedness that may influence the stability and
   robustness of networks to landscape changes. Species in mutualistic
   networks might respond to landscape modifications with a sudden collapse
   at critical habitat destruction thresholds. In this work we review
   general trends in the scientific literature related to the effects of
   landscape changes on plant-pollinator networks. For this, a survey in
   Scopus and Web of Knowledge databases was conducted in May 2011 using
   all seven possible combinations of the terms ``pollinat{*}{''} with the
   terms ``landscape{''}, ``habitat loss{''} and ``network{''}. We found
   155 papers and 92\% of those showed significant effects of landscape
   changes on pollinator diversity and plant reproductive success.
   Approximately 50\% of all analyzed papers showed effects of agriculture
   intensification as a result of increases in the conversion of natural
   areas into agricultural crops on plant-pollinator interactions.
   Landscape modifications affected cross-pollination and the sexual
   reproduction of plants largely because of reduced diversity and
   availability of pollinators due to increased habitat isolation and
   reduction of floral resources and nesting areas in the remaining
   available habitat. An integrated approach concerning the effects of
   modified landscapes on natural ecosystems regarding how these variations
   can affect the stability and robustness of pollination networks can be
   extremely useful for conservation of plant-pollinators interactions,
   with positive overall consequences for conservation of plant,
   pollinators and pollination services in natural and agricultural
   ecosystems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Inorganic Nitrogen Derived from Foraging Honey Bees Could Have Adaptive
   Benefits for the Plants They Visit}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{In most terrestrial ecosystems, nitrogen (N) is the most limiting
   nutrient for plant growth. Honey bees may help alleviate this limitation
   because their feces (frass) have high concentration of organic nitrogen
   that may decompose in soil and provide inorganic N to plants. However,
   information on soil N processes associated with bee frass is not
   available. The objectives of this work were to 1) estimate the amount of
   bee frass produced by a honey bee colony and 2) evaluate nitrogen
   mineralization and ammonia volatilization from bee frass when surface
   applied or incorporated into soil. Two cage studies were conducted to
   estimate the amount of frass produced by a 5000-bee colony, and three
   laboratory studies were carried out in which bee frass, surface-applied
   or incorporated into soil, was incubated at 25 degrees C for 15 to 45
   days. The average rate of bee frass production by a 5,000-bee colony was
   estimated at 2.27 to 2.69 g N month(-1). Nitrogen mineralization from
   bee frass during 30 days released 20\% of the organic N when bee frass
   was surface applied and 34\% when frass was incorporated into the soil.
   Volatilized NH3 corresponded to 1\% or less of total N. The potential
   amount of inorganic N released to the soil by a typical colony of 20,000
   bees foraging in an area similar to that of the experimental cages (3.24
   m(2)) was estimated at 0.62 to 0.74 g N m(-2) month(-1) which may be
   significant at a community scale in terms of soil microbial activity and
   plant growth. Thus, the deposition of available N by foraging bees could
   have adaptive benefits for the plants they visit, a collateral benefit
   deriving from the primary activity of pollination.}},

Title = {{The bee tree of life: a supermatrix approach to apoid phylogeny and
   biogeography}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bees are the primary pollinators of angiosperms throughout
   the world. There are more than 16,000 described species, with broad
   variation in life history traits such as nesting habitat, diet, and
   social behavior. Despite their importance as pollinators, the evolution
   of bee biodiversity is understudied: relationships among the seven
   families of bees remain controversial, and no empirical global-level
   reconstruction of historical biogeography has been attempted.
   Morphological studies have generally suggested that the phylogeny of
   bees is rooted near the family Colletidae, whereas many molecular
   studies have suggested a root node near (or within) Melittidae. Previous
   molecular studies have focused on a relatively small sample of taxa
   (similar to 150 species) and genes (seven at most). Public databases
   contain an enormous amount of DNA sequence data that has not been
   comprehensively analysed in the context of bee evolution.
   Results: We downloaded, aligned, concatenated, and analysed all
   available protein-coding nuclear gene DNA sequence data in GenBank as of
   October, 2011. Our matrix consists of 20 genes, with over 17,000 aligned
   nucleotide sites, for over 1,300 bee and apoid wasp species,
   representing over two-thirds of bee genera. Whereas the matrix is large
   in terms of number of genes and taxa, there is a significant amount of
   missing data: only similar to 15\% of the matrix is populated with data.
   The placement of the root as well as relationships between Andrenidae
   and other bee families remain ambiguous, as several alternative
   maximum-likelihood estimates fall within the statistically credible set.
   However, we recover strong bootstrap support for relationships among
   many families and for their monophyly. Ancestral geographic range
   reconstruction suggests a likely origin of bees in the southern
   hemisphere, with Melittidae ancestrally located within Africa, and
   Halictidae, Colletidae, and Apidae within the New World.
   Conclusions: Our study affirms the monophyly of each bee family,
   sister-taxa relationships between Apidae and Megachilidae (the
   `long-tongued bees'), between Colletidae and Stenotritidae, and between
   Colletidae + Stenotritidae and Halictidae. Our analyses reject a
   Colletidae-basal hypothesis for family-level relationships and instead
   support Melittidae as sister to the remaining bees. Southern hemisphere
   vicariance likely played an important role in early diversification
   within many bee families.}},

Title = {{Do Honeybees Shape the Bacterial Community Composition in Floral Nectar?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Floral nectar is considered the most important reward animal-pollinated
   plants offer to attract pollinators. Here we explore whether honeybees,
   which act as pollinators, affect the composition of bacterial
   communities in the nectar. Nectar and honeybees were sampled from two
   plant species: Amygdalus communis and Citrus paradisi. To prevent the
   contact of nectar with pollinators, C. paradisi flowers were covered
   with net bags before blooming (covered flowers). Comparative analysis of
   bacterial communities in the nectar and on the honeybees was performed
   by the 454-pyrosequencing technique. No significant differences were
   found among bacterial communities in honeybees captured on the two
   different plant species. This resemblance may be due to the presence of
   dominant bacterial OTUs, closely related to the Arsenophonus genus. The
   bacterial communities of the nectar from the covered and uncovered C.
   paradisi flowers differed significantly; the bacterial communities on
   the honeybees differed significantly from those in the covered flowers'
   nectar, but not from those in the uncovered flowers' nectar. We conclude
   that the honeybees may introduce bacteria into the nectar and/or may be
   contaminated by bacteria introduced into the nectar by other sources
   such as other pollinators and nectar thieves.}},

Abstract = {{Outcrossing and sexual reproduction of most flowering plants depends on
   pollinators. Plant traits likely to be involved in pollinator attraction
   include flower color, shape, and size. Furthermore, plant or flower
   density and the temporal flowering pattern may have an effect on
   reproduction. In this study, we examine the pollination ecology,
   breeding system, female reproductive output, and germination of two
   tropical understory species, Stenostephanus lobeliiformis (Acanthaceae)
   and Besleria melancholica (Gesneriaceae), which differ in these traits.
   Pollinator observations revealed that the dense flowering S.
   lobeliiformis with pinkish flowers received a higher diversity of
   pollinators, but visitor frequency measured as visits per flower per
   hour was much less (0.1 h(-1)) than that to B. melancholica, which has a
   smaller floral display of dull-colored flowers (1.5 h(-1)). Pollination
   experiments revealed that S. lobeliiformis but not B. melancholica is
   pollen-limited. In addition, both species are partially
   self-incompatible and depend on pollinators for outcrossing. Natural
   fruit set of open-pollinated unmanipulated flowers (control treatment)
   in both species is 22-26 \%. Germination studies indicated inbreeding
   depression in S. lobeliiformis. We conclude that the pollination ecology
   of these species is influenced by a broad set of traits and that very
   different combinations of these traits can be successful in terms of
   reproduction.}},

Title = {{Community-dependent foraging habits of flower visitors: cascading

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Despite the ubiquity and the importance of interspecific interactions
   among flower visitors, few studies have examined their effects on the
   realized feeding niches of visitor species in a community context. To
   evaluate the community-wide effects of interactions among flower
   visitors, I have examined changes in the flower utilization patterns of
   each visitor species at several sites where the component of the
   visitor's community differed. Specifically, I compared the flower
   preferences and foraging habits (legitimate foraging vs. primary nectar
   robbing vs. secondary nectar robbing) of five bumble bee species in
   flower patches consisting of Trifolium pratense L. (red clover) and T.
   repens L. (white clover) on Hokkaido Island, Japan. I also examined the
   nectar production and standing crops of each flower species to evaluate
   the exploitation competition based on nectar. The bumble bee species
   exhibited different flower utilization patterns among sites. At sites
   where the long-tongued Bombus diversus tersatus was common and the
   exotic short-tongued B. terrestris was rare, B. diversus tersatus
   visited red clover (long-tubed flowers) exclusively, whereas
   medium-tongued B. pseudobaicalensis and short-tongued B. hypocrita
   sapporoensis and B. hypnorum koropokkrus preferentially visited white
   clover (short-tubed flowers). Conversely, at sites where the
   long-tongued bee was rare, four other species frequently visited red
   clover in different modes: B. pseudobaicalensis visited legitimately, B.
   hypocrita sapporoensis and B. terrestris visited as primary nectar
   robbers, and B. hypnorum koropokkrus visited as a secondary nectar
   robber. The presence or absence of resource exploitation by the
   long-tongued species and the interaction between primary and secondary
   nectar robbers via robbing holes was the major ecological sources of
   these differences. Diverse effects of interactions among flower visitors
   played important roles in shaping pattern of plant and flower visitor
   interactions.}},

Title = {{Are there pollination syndromes in the Australian epacrids (Ericaceae:
   Styphelioideae)? A novel statistical method to identify key floral
   traits per syndrome}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{141-149}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Convergent floral traits hypothesized as attracting
   particular pollinators are known as pollination syndromes. Floral
   diversity suggests that the Australian epacrid flora may be adapted to
   pollinator type. Currently there are empirical data on the pollination
   systems for 87 species (approx. 15 \% of Australian epacrids). This
   provides an opportunity to test for pollination syndromes and their
   important morphological traits in an iconic element of the Australian
   flora.
   Methods Data on epacrid-pollinator relationships were obtained from
   published literature and field observation. A multivariate approach was
   used to test whether epacrid floral attributes related to pollinator
   profiles. Statistical classification was then used to rank floral
   attributes according to their predictive value. Data sets excluding
   mixed pollination systems were used to test the predictive power of
   statistical classification to identify pollination models.
   Key Results Floral attributes are correlated with bird, fly and bee
   pollination. Using floral attributes identified as correlating with
   pollinator type, bird pollination is classified with 86 \% accuracy, red
   flowers being the most important predictor. Fly and bee pollination are
   classified with 78 and 69 \% accuracy, but have a lack of individually
   important floral predictors. Excluding mixed pollination systems
   improved the accuracy of the prediction of both bee and fly pollination
   systems.
   Conclusions Although most epacrids have generalized pollination systems,
   a correlation between bird pollination and red, long-tubed epacrids is
   found. Statistical classification highlights the relative importance of
   each floral attribute in relation to pollinator type and proves useful
   in classifying epacrids to bird, fly and bee pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of farming system on plant density and flowering of
   dicotyledonous herb's of high value for bees were investigated in 14
   organic and 14 conventional winter wheat fields and adjacent road
   verges. The organic and conventional winter wheat fields/road verges
   were paired based on the percentage of semi-natural habitats in the
   surrounding landscape at 1-km scale. Mean density of high value bee
   plants per Raunkiaer circle was significantly higher in organic winter
   wheat fields and their adjacent road verges than in their conventionally
   farmed counterparts. The effect of organic farming was even more
   pronounced on the flowering stage of high value bee plants, with 10-fold
   higher mean density of flowering plants in organic fields than in
   conventional fields and 1.9-fold higher in road verges bordering organic
   fields than in those bordering conventional fields. In summary, organic
   farming had a strong positive effect in both road verges and wheat
   fields on the density of high value bee plants. This was due to the
   absence of herbicides and to practices inherent to organic farming
   systems, such as the use of clover (a high value bee plant) as a green
   manure and fodder crop. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Natural ecosystems benefit human communities by providing ecosystem
   services such as water purification and crop pollination. Mapping
   ecosystem service values has become popular, but most are static
   snapshots of average value. Estimating instead the economic impacts of
   specific ecosystem changes can better inform typical resource decisions.
   Here we develop an approach to mapping marginal values, those resulting
   from the next unit of ecosystem change, across landscapes. We
   demonstrate the approach with a recent model of crop pollination
   services in Costa Rica, simulating deforestation events to predict
   resulting marginal changes in pollination services to coffee farms. We
   find that marginal losses from deforestation vary from zero to
   US\$700/ha across the landscape. Financial risks for farmers from these
   losses and marginal benefits of forest restoration show similar spatial
   variation. Marginal values are concentrated in relatively few forest
   parcels not identified using average value. These parcels lack
   substitutes: nearby forest parcels that can supply services in the event
   of loss. Indeed, the marginal value of forest parcels declines
   exponentially with the density of surrounding forest cover. The approach
   we develop is applicable to any ecosystem service. Combined with
   information on costs, it can help target conservation or restoration
   efforts to optimize benefits to people and biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Dillenia suffruticosa (Dilleniaceae), a common pioneer shrub in
   Southeast Asia, is broadly distributed along roadsides. This species
   flowers throughout the year and is thought to be a keystone species for
   maintaining populations of flower visitors. To examine the flower
   visitors of this species, we conducted field surveys and described the
   behaviors of each flower visitor species within four different research
   sites: Primary Forests 1 and 2, Secondary Forest, and Mixed Vegetation.
   We caught 1087 individuals belonging to 51 species from 11 insect
   families and one species of arachnid. Most flower visitors belonged to
   Hymenoptera (98.6\% of individuals); Trigona spp. and Xylocopa spp.
   (Apidae) accounted for 64.0\% and 20.0\%, respectively, of all caught
   individuals. According to observations of behavior by each species,
   effective pollinators may include Xylocopa spp. and Amegilla spp.
   (Apidae). We compared the research results among four research sites and
   found that the effective pollinators were not different among sites.
   However, the number of species and the abundances of flower visitors
   decreased in disturbed areas, especially in Secondary Forest. This
   research suggests the effects of human disturbances on the diversity and
   abundance of flower visitors.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Pedicularis shows high diversity in its corolla form, however, its
   floral ontogeny has been rarely investigated. In particular, the
   development of the highly variable upper lip (galea), three broad
   morphological types of which (beakless and toothless, beakless and
   toothed, beaked) can be discriminated, remains unknown. We used scanning
   electron microscopy to investigate the early stages of floral ontogeny
   in two beaked species, Pedicularis gruina and P. siphonantha. To compare
   the developmental processes of the three galea types, three species for
   each type were investigated. Initiations of floral organs in Pedicularis
   are consistent. Sepal initiations are successive from the
   lateral-adaxial primordia, followed by the lateral-abaxial ones (these
   sometimes missing), then the mid-adaxial one (again sometimes missing).
   The stamens are initiated prior to the petals, or development of petal
   primordia may be retarded at the early stages in comparison with that of
   stamen primordia. Four stamen primordia are initiated simultaneously.
   The five petal primordia are initiated almost simultaneously.
   Development processes of the upper lip among the three galea types
   differ in the expansion rates and directions of the cells of the two
   lobes and these differences govern whether or not a beak and/or teeth
   are formed on the upper lip. The floral ontogeny of Pedicularis is close
   to that of Agalinis, which supports the molecular assignment. Floral
   monosymmetry of Pedicularis is established at the beginning of sepal
   initiation and is maintained until flowering. The development of the
   upper lip provides some clues to the evolution of beaked and/or toothed
   galeas in Pedicularis.}},

   flowering heads of red clovers arranged in 37 bottles (plants), each of
   which was monitored by an observer to record every visit and probe for
   2.5 h on each of 3 days. The data of collective visits by marked
   individuals revealed that the bees had their own foraging areas, in
   which they visited a set of plants frequently and others less often,
   i.e., the same individual bee repeatedly returned to certain plants as a
   regular visitor while sampling others as an occasional visitor. I
   further found that as a regular visitor, an individual bee tended to
   probe more flowering heads on familiar plants while probing fewer on
   unfamiliar plants as an occasional visitor. The mean number of
   consecutive probes by a bee was also positively correlated with its
   activity (the total number of plant visits made during the observation
   period). The fact that each bee behaves differently on different plants
   indicates that the same individual pollinator can exert different
   influence on the reproductive success of each plant: apparently, a
   pollinator likely reduces the potential for geitonogamous
   self-pollination when foraging as an occasional visitor. Attracting
   occasional visitors therefore may be beneficial for plants to avoid
   geitonogamy. This study thus emphasizes the importance of paying
   attention to pollinator individuality in pollination ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The new species Geissorhiza melanthera is a member of sect. Engysiphon

   the bases of the tepals and throat of the perianth tube bright red. The
   unscented flowers are zygomorphic with unilateral and declinate stamens
   and style extended horizontally. Its most striking feature is the black
   anthers with latrorse dehiscence and a portion of the connective visible
   on the adaxial surface. Field observations on two separate days showed
   the only visitor to be the bee-fly Megapalpus capensis (Diptera:
   Bombyliidae), which landed on the anthers and then moved toward the
   perianth tube, inserting its proboscis and thorax into the upper
   perianth tube, evidently foraging for nectar. Pollen loads on the
   ventral body of flies were passively transferred to receptive style
   branches of flowers visited later. This is the first record in Iridaceae
   of potentially pollinating visits by Megapalpus or any bee-fly. (C) 2013

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{32-39}},

Abstract = {{Many recent studies have shown that plant functional traits can be used
   to predict the response of plant assemblages to management or other
   environmental change. A further challenge is to use them to predict
   changes in the assemblages of other groups. Using data from a study of
   the impact of land use on biodiversity, the linkages between management
   drivers, a range of plant functional traits and the overall foraging
   numbers and assemblage of bees was assessed. Bee foraging numbers were
   only weakly predicted by plant traits, though bee foraging assemblage
   was closely related to a number of different groups of plant traits
   (flower colour and Forage Index, as well as taxonomic group). In turn,
   the selected traits were significantly correlated to some of the
   response traits that linked the plant assemblage to management,
   indicating that there was a predictive pathway from management to bee
   abundance and assemblage structure. However, models developed with just
   the environmental drivers proved superior at predicting both bee numbers
   and assemblage. Plant traits proved to be a moderately effective
   predictor of bee assemblage structure. However, the use of plant traits
   as a link between the bees and management did not offer any improvement
   on models directly developed from management variables. This suggests
   that the bee assemblage is responding to traits that have not been
   quantified and that developing these trophic linkage models may have to
   take a different approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{The geographical distribution, population structure and pollination
   ecology are key aspects in the conservation and management of rare
   orchids. Here, we address these aspects and the main threats affecting
   the endangered Cuban orchid Broughtonia cubensis. This rewardless orchid
   is self-compatible, but pollinator dependent. However, seed production
   can be negatively affected by insect-mediated selfing. Three species of
   small bee (genera Ceratina and Lasioglossum) act as pollinators. As in
   the case of other nectarless orchids, we detected two species of plant
   producing large amounts of nectar in the area, the floral morphology of
   which closely resembles that of B.cubensis. The simultaneous flowering
   of these species could positively affect the reproductive success of
   B.cubensis. Nonetheless, the fitness of this orchid in natural
   conditions is low, possibly related to strong pollen limitation. To the
   problems arising from reduced fitness is added the fact that its
   historical distribution range has been greatly reduced in recent years.
   Throughout this study, we have detected dramatic reductions in the
   population sizes, in some cases as a result of human plundering, but
   also as a consequence of hurricanes. Based on the results of this study,
   we propose some guidelines to manage and conserve this orchid.(c) 2013

Abstract = {{The predominantly Holarctic bee genus Osmia Panzer is species-rich and
   behaviourally diverse. A robust phylogeny of this genus is important for
   understanding the evolution of the immense variety of morphological and
   behavioural traits exhibited by this group. We infer a phylogeny of
   Osmia using DNA sequence data obtained from three nuclear genes
   (elongation factor 1-, LW-rhodopsin and CAD) and the mitochondrial gene
   COI. Our taxon sampling places special attention on North American
   members of the subgenus Melanosmia Schmiedeknecht; we discuss the novel
   placement of a number of species traditionally assigned to O.
   (Melanosmia) and examine the relative support for alternative
   classifications of this species-rich subgenus. We use this new phylogeny
   to guide a reassessment of morphological and behavioural characters
   within Osmia. Our results provide support for the recognition of Osmia
   (Hapsidosmia), subgen.n., a monotypic subgenus containing Osmia iridis
   Cockerell \& Titus. We synonymize Osmia (Mystacosmia) Snelling under O.
   (Melanosmia), syn.n. We synonymize Osmia (Acanthosmioides) Ashmead under
   O. (Melanosmia), syn.n., propose odontogaster species group' as a
   replacement for the subgeneric name Acanthosmioides, and refine the
   morphological characters that serve to diagnose the species group. We
   additionally propose nigrifrons species group' for a clade within O.
   (Melanosmia) containing most species formerly placed in Osmia
   (Centrosmia) Robertson. We demonstrate more cohesive patterns of nest
   substrate use in the nigrifrons and odontogaster species groups than was
   previously believed to occur, reconsider character polarity of aspects
   of the female mandible, and show that a large number of morphological
   characters have evolved convergently within the genus. In order to
   facilitate discussion of relevant taxa, we propose the following 15 new
   synonymies: O. bakeri Sandhouse under O. melanopleura Cockerell; O.
   crenulaticornis Michener under O. pinorum Cockerell; O. claremontensis

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of orchid bees was analyzed in a mosaic of
   tropical rainforest and rubber tree groves in the Atlantic coast of
   Brazil (ARRF), comparing abundances and species compositions between
   replicas of the following landscape elements: small and large forest
   fragments, and rubber tree groves. Species compositions responded to all
   of the factors examined (time, mosaic elements, and distances; P <
   0.009). In contrast, total orchid bee abundance varied significantly
   only over time (P = 0.0001), but not among the different mosaic elements
   (P = 0.05). Fragment size and distances between the fragments have
   affected species composition and abundance of some few common species.
   Most local species were present in the rubber plantation, and several
   species were using this matrix as a source of odor. The seasonal quality
   shifting of this matrix (leaf fall) has had less influence on the
   spatial distribution of orchid bees than the distances between forest
   fragments and fragment sizes. Previous studies of forest fragmentation
   have shown very weak effects of matrix isolation in mosaics with 5 to 90
   \% of forest cover, which supports the generalized expectation that
   organisms with well-developed dispersal capacities can respond to much
   higher thresholds of forest fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated pollen diets of Euglossa viridissima Friese and its

   degraded dry forest locality near Merida, Yucatan, Mexico. Pollen
   samples were obtained from nests collected in the rainy season of three
   consecutive years (2006-2008). Solanum sp. (Solanaceae), Physalis sp.
   (Solanaceae), Ocimum sp., Ocimum micranthum (both Lamiaceae), and Senna
   sp. (Fabaceae) were the dominant taxa, accounting for 88 \% of pollen
   volume across species. Other important pollen taxa were Croton spp.
   (Euphorbiaceae), Ipomoea sp. (Convolvulaceae), Solanum torvum, Vigna sp.
   (Fabaceae), Sida sp. (Malvaceae), and Randia aculeata (Rubiaceae). The
   predominantly buzz-pollinated family Solanaceae alone represented more

Abstract = {{Concern about biodiversity loss has led to increased public investment
   in conservation. Whereas there is a widespread perception that such
   initiatives have been unsuccessful, there are few quantitative tests of
   this perception. Here, we evaluate whether rates of biodiversity change
   have altered in recent decades in three European countries (Great
   Britain, Netherlands and Belgium) for plants and flower visiting
   insects. We compared four 20-year periods, comparing periods of rapid
   land-use intensification and natural habitat loss (1930-1990) with a
   period of increased conservation investment (post-1990). We found that
   extensive species richness loss and biotic homogenisation occurred
   before 1990, whereas these negative trends became substantially less
   accentuated during recent decades, being partially reversed for certain
   taxa (e.g. bees in Great Britain and Netherlands). These results
   highlight the potential to maintain or even restore current species
   assemblages (which despite past extinctions are still of great
   conservation value), at least in regions where large-scale land-use
   intensification and natural habitat loss has ceased.}},

Abstract = {{More diverse biological communities may provide ecosystem services that
   are less variable over space or time. However, the mechanisms underlying
   this relationship are rarely investigated empirically in real-world
   ecosystems. Here, we investigate how a potentially important stabilising
   mechanism, response diversity, the differential response to
   environmental change among species, stabilises pollination services
   against land-use change. We measured crop pollination services provided
   by native bees across land-use gradients in three crop systems. We found
   that bee species responded differentially to increasing agricultural
   land cover in all three systems, demonstrating that response diversity
   occurs. Similarly, we found response diversity in pollination services
   in two of the systems. However, there was no evidence that response
   diversity, in general, stabilised ecosystem services. Our results
   suggest that either response diversity is not the primary stabilising
   mechanism in our system, or that new measures of response diversity are
   needed that better capture the stabilising effects it provides.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, agri-environmental schemes (AES) have been introduced in
   response to concerns about farmland biodiversity declines. Yet, as AES
   have delivered variable results, a better understanding of what
   determines their success or failure is urgently needed. Focusing on
   pollinating insects, we quantitatively reviewed how environmental
   factors affect the effectiveness of AES. Our results suggest that the
   ecological contrast in floral resources created by schemes drives the
   response of pollinators to AES but that this response is moderated by
   landscape context and farmland type, with more positive responses in
   croplands (vs. grasslands) located in simple (vs. cleared or complex)
   landscapes. These findings inform us how to promote pollinators and
   associated pollination services in species-poor landscapes. They do not,
   however, present viable strategies to mitigate loss of threatened or
   endangered species. This indicates that the objectives and design of AES
   should distinguish more clearly between biodiversity conservation and
   delivery of ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of the factors driving extinctions is fundamental to
   conservation biology. Here, we assessed the likely consequences of
   extinction of pollinators and dispersers for phylogenetic and functional
   diversity of savanna woody plant species. Loss of phylogenetic diversity
   was greater than expected by chance in simulated extinctions of moth-
   and beetle-pollinated species, and bird- and mammal-dispersed species.
   In extinction simulations of bee and bat-pollinated species, the loss of
   functional diversity was greater than expected by chance. Two main
   features could drive greater loss of biodiversity than expected by
   chance: loss of clumped species and loss of very unique species.
   Pollination and dispersal modes must be taken into account in
   conservation plans or ecological restoration strategies, since
   communities may be differentially vulnerable to the loss of one of these
   processes. Both functional and phylogenetic components of biodiversity
   should be considered, as consequences of extinctions for one are not
   necessarily the same as for the other.}},

Abstract = {{Buzz-pollination is a plant strategy that promotes gamete transfer by
   requiring a pollinator, typically bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea), to
   vibrate a flower's anthers in order to extract pollen. Although
   buzz-pollination is widespread in angiosperms with over 20,000 species
   using it, little is known about the functional connection between
   natural variation in buzzing vibrations and the amount of pollen that
   can be extracted from anthers. We characterized variability in the
   vibrations produced by Bombus terrestris bumblebees while collecting
   pollen from Solanum rostratum (Solanaceae), a buzz-pollinated plant. We
   found substantial variation in several buzzing properties both within
   and among workers from a single colony. As expected, some of this
   variation was predicted by the physical attributes of individual
   bumblebees: heavier workers produced buzzes of greater amplitude. We
   then constructed artificial ``pollination buzzes{''} that varied in
   three parameters (peak frequency, peak amplitude, and duration), and
   stimulated S. rostratum flowers with these synthetic buzzes to quantify
   the relationship between buzz properties and pollen removal. We found
   that greater amplitude and longer duration buzzes ejected substantially
   more pollen, while frequency had no directional effect and only a weak
   quadratic effect on the amount of pollen removed. These findings suggest
   that foraging bumblebees may improve pollen collection by increasing the
   duration or amplitude of their buzzes. Moreover, given that amplitude is
   positively correlated with mass, preferential foraging by heavier
   workers is likely to result in the largest pollen yields per bee, and
   this could have significant consequences for the success of a colony
   foraging on buzz-pollinated flowers.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Pollinators such as the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, fulfil
   a crucial role in agriculture. In this context, tests were conducted
   with the insecticide chlorantraniliprole (Coragen (R)) as a model
   compound active on the ryanodine receptor of insects. RESULTS Chronic
   oral exposure via pollen induced lethargic behaviour in B. terrestris
   workers and their offspring (drones). Indeed, in nests exposed to
   0.4mgL-1, representing 1/100 of the concentration recommended for use in
   the field, workers and drones did not take their defensive position upon
   stimulation and they were less active than non-exposed insects. The
   different risk assessment tests used here demonstrated that contact and
   pollen exposure had no effect on bumblebee worker survival, whereas oral
   exposure via sugar water caused both acute (72h LC50=13mgL-1) and
   chronic (7week LC50=7mgL-1) toxicity. Severe sublethal effects on
   reproduction were recorded in nests orally exposed to pollen treated
   with chlorantraniliprole. CONCLUSION The present study identified an
   important physiological endpoint of sublethal effects on reproduction,
   as this is associated with lethargic behaviour after oral intake. As
   such, this is a factor that should now be incorporated into future risk
   assessments. Secondly, it confirmed that the assessment of sublethal
   effects on behaviour is needed for adequate risk assessment of
   potentially deleterious' compounds with a neurogenic target, as is also
   pointed out in the recent European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)
   guidelines. (c) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Title = {{Ecological Variation in Response to Mass-Flowering Oilseed Rape and
   Surrounding Landscape Composition by Members of a Cryptic Bumblebee
   Complex}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{The Bombus sensu stricto species complex is a widespread group of
   cryptic bumblebee species which are important pollinators of many crops
   and wild plants. These cryptic species have, until now, largely been
   grouped together in ecological studies, and so little is known about
   their individual colony densities, foraging ranges or habitat
   requirements, which can be influenced by land use at a landscape scale.
   We used mass-flowering oilseed rape fields as locations to sample bees
   of this complex, as well as the second most common visitor to oilseed
   rape B. lapidarius, and molecular RFLP methods to distinguish between
   the cryptic species. We then used microsatellite genotyping to identify
   sisters and estimate colony densities, and related both proportions of
   cryptic species and their colony densities to the composition of the
   landscape surrounding the fields. We found B. lucorum was the most
   common member of the complex present in oilseed rape followed by B.
   terrestris. B. cryptarum was also present in all but one site, with
   higher proportions found in the east of the study area. High numbers of
   bumblebee colonies were estimated to be using oilseed rape fields as a
   forage resource, with B. terrestris colony numbers higher than previous
   estimates from non-mass-flowering fields. We also found that the cryptic
   species responded differently to surrounding landscape composition: both
   relative proportions of B. cryptarum in samples and colony densities of
   B. lucorum were negatively associated with the amount of arable land in
   the landscape, while proportions and colony densities of other species
   did not respond to landscape variables at the scale measured. This
   suggests that the cryptic species have different ecological requirements
   (which may be scale-dependent) and that oilseed rape can be an important
   forage resource for many colonies of bumblebees. Given this, we
   recommend sustainable management of this crop to benefit bumblebees.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Common Methods for Sampling Invertebrate Pollinator
   Assemblages: Net Sampling Out-Perform Pan Traps}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Methods for sampling ecological assemblages strive to be efficient,
   repeatable, and representative. Unknowingly, common methods may be
   limited in terms of revealing species function and so of less value for
   comparative studies. The global decline in pollination services has
   stimulated surveys of flower-visiting invertebrates, using pan traps and
   net sampling. We explore the relative merits of these two methods in
   terms of species discovery, quantifying abundance, function, and
   composition, and responses of species to changing floral resources.
   Using a spatially-nested design we sampled across a 5000 km 2 area of
   arid grasslands, including 432 hours of net sampling and 1296 pan
   trap-days, between June 2010 and July 2011. Net sampling yielded 22\%
   more species and 30\% higher abundance than pan traps, and better
   reflected the spatio-temporal variation of floral resources. Species
   composition differed significantly between methods; from 436 total
   species, 25\% were sampled by both methods, 50\% only by nets, and the
   remaining 25\% only by pans. Apart from being less comprehensive, if pan
   traps do not sample flower-visitors, the link to pollination is
   questionable. By contrast, net sampling functionally linked species to
   pollination through behavioural observations of flower-visitation
   interaction frequency. Netted specimens are also necessary for evidence
   of pollen transport. Benefits of net-based sampling outweighed minor
   differences in overall sampling effort. As pan traps and net sampling
   methods are not equivalent for sampling invertebrate-flower
   interactions, we recommend net sampling of invertebrate pollinator
   assemblages, especially if datasets are intended to document declines in
   pollination and guide measures to retain this important ecosystem
   service.}},

Abstract = {{The black species of weak-veined Lasioglossum (or Hemihalictus series)
   in eastern North America are revised to clarify their taxonomy and
   nomenclature and to facilitate identification. A subgeneric
   classification based upon available phylogenetic data is applied.
   Lasioglossum (Sphecodogastra) is applied more broadly than any previous
   usage to include many species typically classified as L. (Evylaeus). The
   subgenus L. (Evylaeus) is retained but applied narrowly in agreement
   with phylogenetic results. Lasioglossum (Hemihalictus) has historically
   been considered monotypic but is here applied to many species of L.
   (Dialictus) sensu lato (equivalent to the carinaless L. (Evylaeus) of
   some authors). Usage of L. (Dialictus) is restricted primarily to
   species with metallic integument. Additional subgeneric synonymies for
   extralimital taxa are formalized and discussed. Descriptions are
   provided for each species with a synonymic list, diagnosis, and notes on
   taxonomy and biology. The recently revised Onagraceae-specialist species
   of L. (Sphecodogastra) are given abbreviated treatments. Notes on
   available DNA barcode data are given, with diagnostic characters
   supplied for closely related species. One new species is described: L.
   (Sphecodogastra) seillean Gibbs and Packer and the males of L. fedorense
   (Crawford) and L. pectinatum (Robertson) are described for the first
   time. The following three new synonymies are proposed: Lasioglossum
   (Hemihalictus) sopinci (Crawford), senior subjective synonym of Evylaeus
   bradleyi Mitchell; Lasioglossum (Hemihalictus) macoupinense (Robertson),
   senior subjective synonym of Halictus divergens Lovell; and Lasioglossum
   (Hemihalictus) inconditum (Cockerell), senior subjective synonym of
   Halictus tracyi Cockerell. Lasioglossum inconditum is here considered to
   be distinct from the Palaearctic species L. rufitarse (Zetterstedt). A
   lectotype is designated for Halictus quebecensis Crawford. We present
   the first record of L. lustrans (Cockerell) and L. swenki (Crawford) in
   Canada and the first record of L. lusorium (Cresson) east of the
   Mississippi River. Updated keys to species are provided for the fauna of
   eastern North America.}},

Title = {{Assessing Insecticide Hazard to Bumble Bees Foraging on Flowering Weeds
   in Treated Lawns}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Maintaining bee-friendly habitats in cities and suburbs can help
   conserve the vital pollination services of declining bee populations.
   Despite label precautions not to apply them to blooming plants,
   neonicotinoids and other residual systemic insecticides may be applied
   for preventive control of lawn insect pests when spring-flowering weeds
   are present. Dietary exposure to neonicotinoids adversely affects bees,
   but the extent of hazard from field usage is controversial. We exposed
   colonies of the bumble bee Bombus impatiens to turf with blooming white
   clover that had been treated with clothianidin, a neonicotinoid, or with
   chlorantraniliprole, the first anthranilic diamide labeled for use on
   lawns. The sprays were applied at label rate and lightly irrigated.
   After residues had dried, colonies were confined to forage for six days,
   and then moved to a non-treated rural site to openly forage and develop.
   Colonies exposed to clothianidin-treated weedy turf had delayed weight
   gain and produced no new queens whereas those exposed to
   chlorantraniliprole-treated plots developed normally compared with
   controls. Neither bumble bees nor honey bees avoided foraging on treated
   white clover in open plots. Nectar from clover blooms directly
   contaminated by spray residues contained 171 +/- 44 ppb clothianidin.
   Notably, neither insecticide adversely impacted bee colonies confined on
   the treated turf after it had been mown to remove clover blooms present
   at the time of treatment, and new blooms had formed. Our results
   validate EPA label precautionary statements not to apply neonicotinoids
   to blooming nectar-producing plants if bees may visit the treatment
   area. Whatever systemic hazard through lawn weeds they may pose appears
   transitory, however, and direct hazard can be mitigated by adhering to
   label precautions, or if blooms inadvertently are contaminated, by
   mowing to remove them. Chlorantraniliprole usage on lawns appears
   non-hazardous to bumble bees.}},

Volume = {{258}},

Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Abiotic features and biogeography have been suggested as influencing
   factors for large-scale species distribution, but little is known about
   the role of interactions. Aiming to understand how the environmental
   variables and floral morphology shape the large-scale spatial pattern of
   species distribution and how this is reflected in the interactions, we
   analyzed the oil-collecting Centris bee species and the floral oil
   producing plants in South America. We surveyed the academic literature
   to build a matrix of interactions and Internet data providers for a
   dataset of occurrence points of Centris bee species and oil plants with
   which the bees have been observed. We grouped the interacting bee-plant
   species according to the two types of floral oil producing gland
   (epithelial and trichomatic elaiophores) and performed a Cluster
   Analysis using the averages of climatic and topographic variables to
   determine the climate similarity among the occurrence areas of each
   group of bee-plant interacting species. We estimate the significant
   differences among the climatic conditions in the occurrence areas of the
   clusters. We identified a distributional pattern of plant-bee
   interactions that is associated with abiotic factors, especially
   precipitation, in the occurrence areas. Areas with higher precipitation
   presented the highest number of species; also, the bee species were
   associated to plants with epithelial elaiophore and the interactions
   were more generalized (many partners). In the areas with lower
   precipitation, we found few species; the interactive plant species
   include the botanical families that have flowers with trichomatic
   elaiophores and the interactions were more specialized (few partners).
   In addition, in these latter areas Centris and their interacting plant
   are phylogenetically related. The distributional pattern of interactions
   between Centris bees and floral oil producing plants in South America is
   related to current ecological processes, mainly precipitation, but also
   to past evolutionary history. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Byrsonima lucida (Mill.) DC is the only member of the tropical plant
   family Malpighiaceae native to North America, and is considered a
   threatened species by the state of Florida. In order to better conserve
   the remaining natural populations of B. lucida, we studied the breeding
   system of this species in natural and garden settings. We carried out
   floral biology and breeding system experiments over three flowering
   seasons from 2009-2012. We found that stigmas were receptive mostly
   during the first 2 d of flowering, but not in the final day.
   Self-pollination yielded few fruits and pollinator exclusion yielded no
   fruit set, indicating self-incompatibility and pollinator dependence in
   this species. Obligate outcrossing and complete dependence on a
   specialist bee pollinator make B. lucida's small, fragmented populations
   vulnerable to extinction. Conservation measures should include
   protecting its specialized bee pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee Megachile rotundata (F.) is the primary
   pollinator for alfalfa seed production. Under standard management
   conditions, the alfalfa leafcutting bee develops to the diapausing
   prepupal stage undereld conditions, after which they are cold-stored at
   a static temperature until the following spring, when temperatures are
   raised and development resumes. Wehave assessed the effects of a
   auctuating thermal regime (FTR) during overwintering cold storage, where
   bees were exposed to a daily 1 h pulse of 20 degrees C, and compared
   viability and insect quality to bees stored under a static thermal
   regime. Our results demonstrate that implementing an FTR protocol
   dramatically increases the survival of cold-stored alfalfa leafcutting
   bees, effectively extending their shelf-life into the subsequent growing
   season. These ndings could substantially ameliorate signicant obstacles
   that restrict the more widespread use of this important pollinator, such
   as the biological constraints that restrict its use in early blooming
   crops, and yearly auctuations in bee prices that add signicant nancial
   uncertainty to end users. This study also strengthens a growing body of
   evidence that indicates FTR protocols are superior to static thermal
   regime protocols for insect cold storage.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.), is a solitary,
   cavity-nesting bee and is the primary pollinator for alfalfa seed
   production. Bee management practices include cold storage during the
   prepupal stage. Fluctuating thermal regimes during cold storage
   increases survival of cold storage and allows a doubling of the cold
   storage period with no decrease in survival. However, survival,
   characterized as successful adult emergence, is not qualitative. In this
   study, we determined whether extended storage affects adult bee
   respiration or aight physiology. Weoverwintered bees for a single winter
   (current management protocol) or for 12 mo longer (extended storage). We
   used resting and tethered aight metabolic rates and resting critical PO2
   (the oxygen partial pressure below which metabolism can no longer be
   sustained) as indices of adult bee quality. We found no significant
   differences in body mass, resting or aight metabolic rates, or critical
   PO2 between the two groups. Together these data indicate that extended
   storage of M. rotundata produces bees of similar respiratory capacity
   and aight ability. These ndings could increase the use of M. rotundata
   as an alternative pollinator, allowing for extended storage to time
   adult emergence with early blooming crops.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bees are the main pollinators of onion crops for seed production,
   but owing to low attractiveness of flowers, pollination is often
   inadequate. Pollination problems result in low seed yields. This problem
   is accentuated when male sterile lines (MSL) are used to produce hybrid
   onion seeds. In this study, the effect of floral attributes and nectar
   composition on the preference of honey bees of four MSLs and one onion
   open pollinated cultivar were assessed. The chemical composition of
   nectar was described through the analysis of sugars, trace elements,
   volatile organic compounds, and phenol compounds. The samples studied
   showed qualitative and quantitative differences in the analyzed traits
   of flowers and nectar among the different lines. Furthermore, field
   observations showed a great difference on the number of bee visits and
   seed yield among the onion lines analyzed. For the first time, this
   study demonstrates that there are marked differences in the chemical
   composition of nectar and floral morphology between open pollinated and
   MSLs and also within MSLs. In addition, these differences were
   correlated with the number of visits and seed yield. Therefore, it would
   be possible to select indirectly the most promising productive MSL using
   simple determinations of chemical compounds or floral morphological
   characters.}},

Abstract = {{A population of Buglossoides purpurocaerulea (L.) I.M. Johnst.
   (Boraginaceae-Lithospermeae) located in Lecceto (Siena Province,
   Tuscany, central Italy) has been studied to compare floral nectar
   attributes and forager species between sun-exposed and shaded plants.
   Flower anthesis and maturity of sexual organs were also investigated.
   Average flower anthesis lasted 3-4 days. Stigma receptivity and anther
   dehiscence occurred on the first day. Nectar production also began on
   the first day and maximum production occurred on second-third day.
   Significantly greater volumes and total sugars were recorded in
   individuals exposed to the sun. Nectar HPLC analysis showed a similar
   hexose-dominant sugar profile for all the individuals with percentages
   of sucrose, glucose and fructose around 5, 48 and 47 \%, respectively.
   Protein amino acids represent the 90 \% of the overall free amino acids
   profile. Significant differences between relative percentages of serine
   and proline were found between sun-exposed and shaded individuals. Empis
   pennipes and Bombilyus major were the most frequent insect visitors to
   shaded and sun-exposed individuals, respectively. The hexose dominance
   of the nectar of B. purpurocaerulea, an exception among the
   Mediterranean Lithospermeae, may be related to the habitat where this
   plant generally grows, i.e. the forest-edge, and to pollination mainly
   performed by dipterans.}},

Abstract = {{To shed light on the role played by pollinators in the diversification
   of angiosperms, focus is needed on how floral isolation varies locally
   in the early stages of plant divergence. The few studies performed so
   far have often used species pairs with distinct pollination syndromes
   and contrasting floral displays. Here, we focus on a hybridizing pair
   (Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus angustifolius) with strong similarities
   in flower morphology and pollinators (bumblebees). We examined how
   ethological isolation changes locally in relation to relative Rhinanthus
   frequencies, spatial configurations, and pollinator assemblages.
   Interestingly, floral divergence based on adaptation to different
   pollinators is unlikely in Rhinanthus: no relationship was found between
   floral isolation and the local pollinator assemblage. In contrast,
   species frequency and spatial arrangement strongly influenced bumblebee
   behavior, ethological isolation, and thus potentially hybrid formation.
   When both Rhinanthus were present in equal proportions, bees generally
   preferred the more rewarding and conspicuous species. However, when the
   Rhinanthus frequencies were unbalanced, the more abundant species was
   preferred, although this was less pronounced when the less rewarding R.
   minor predominated. Ethological isolation is highly sensitive to site
   characteristics, and can be as high as in species with contrasting
   floral displays and pollinator suites, even though flowers are similar.}},

Abstract = {{This work analyses the biology and nesting behaviour of Xylocopa
   ordinaria and Xylocopa frontalis, providing information for their
   conservation and management. The study was performed from August 2006 to
   December 2007 and considered 25 nests of X. ordinaria and 23 of X.
   frontalis. The X. frontalis nested between December and April, while X.
   ordinaria nested throughout the year. Nests of X. ordinaria dug in wider
   substrates had more tunnels, and the width of nest tunnels and the
   dimensions of brood cells were smaller than were observed for X.
   frontalis. Females spent most of their time in activities inside their
   nests, followed by nectar and pollen flights and nectar dehydration.
   Pollen resources used by these bees presented more than 40\% similarity,
   and they were constant to flower resources while provisioning cells.
   Cissites maculata and a Diptera species were the natural enemies found.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In addition to being a food source, flowers provide
   non-obvious rewards to their pollinators, such as heat or shelter.
   However, these rewards have seldom been studied.
   Aims: Plant-pollinator interactions between an alpine plant Codonopsis
   convolvulacea and its main pollinator, a bee (Andrena sp.) were
   characterised.
   Methods: We recorded the floral biology and floral visitors in three
   populations of Codonopsis. Pollination treatments were conducted to
   evaluate the importance of insect visitors.
   Results: The bee was the only visitor to two populations, and the main
   visitor to a third population. Females visited flowers to collect
   pollen, while males had a multi-faceted relationship with flowers.
   Nectar was the food resource of males. When the air temperature was <18
   degrees C, they slept on flowers. During the day flowers were
   bowl-shaped solar collectors (1-3 degrees C warmer than the ambient
   air), and flowers were closed at night. Copulation was occasionally
   observed on flowers. Although flowers lasted 2 days and males were
   active for 3 h per day, the high visiting frequency (19.8 per flower per
   hour) guaranteed pollination of each flower.
   Conclusions: We suggest that the combination of multiple rewards protect
   males from cold and unstable weather conditions and encourage them to
   visit more flowers, and that the specialised pollination system is
   promoted by the harsh alpine environment.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The plant pollination service provided by pollinators is
   crucial for ecosystem maintenance, especially in highly fragmented
   landscapes, such as urban areas.
   Aims: We assessed at multiple spatial scales the influence of the degree
   of urbanisation on pollinator communities and pollination success.
   Methods: Artificial populations of Lotus corniculatus (Fabaceae) were
   established along an urbanisation gradient in gardens where pollinator
   communities were surveyed. We described the plant and pollinator
   composition of gardens (local scale) and measured landscape structure in
   nested buffers (small and large landscape scales).
   Results: At the local scale, species richness and abundance of
   pollinators increased with the number of spontaneous plants and the size
   of semi-natural areas, while at the large landscape scale pollinators
   were more diverse and abundant in diversified landscapes with extensive
   green space and low cover of impervious surfaces. At the small landscape
   scale, the pollination success was favoured by agricultural areas, and
   disfavoured by housing density and fragmentation. It was also favoured
   by green space cover at the large landscape scale.
   Conclusions: The variables that affect pollination differ across spatial
   scales. Local and landscape variables have different effects according
   to spatial scale, suggesting different underlying causes, such as the
   presence of flower resources or of suitable habitats in the
   surroundings. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for all
   spatial scales when managing pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Human-red flowers are traditionally considered to be rather unpopular
   with bees, yet some allogamous species in the section Oncocyclus (genus
   Iris, Iridaceae) have evolved specialized interactions with their
   pollinators, a narrow taxonomic range of male solitary bees. The
   dark-red, tubular flowers of these irises are nectarless but provide
   protective shelters (i.e. a non-nutritive form of reward) primarily to
   male solitary bees (Apidae, Eucerini) that pollinate the flowers while
   looking for a shelter. An earlier study on orchids suggested that
   species pollinated predominantly by male solitary bees produce
   significantly larger amounts and larger numbers of different n-alkenes
   (unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons). Whether or not this also applies
   to the Oncocyclus irises and whether pollinators are attracted by
   specific colours or scents of these flowers is unknown.
   Using Iris atropurpurea, recording of pollinator preferences for
   shelters with different spatial parameters was combined with analyses of
   floral colours (by spectrophotometry) and scents (by gas
   chromatographymass spectrometry) to test the hypotheses that (a)
   pollinators significantly prefer floral tunnels facing the rising sun
   (floral heat-reward hypothesis), and that (b) flowers pollinated
   predominantly by male solitary bees produce significantly larger amounts
   and larger numbers of unsaturated cuticular hydrocarbons (n-alkenes) in
   their floral scent (preadaptation to sexual-deception hypothesis).
   Male bees do not significantly prefer shelters facing the rising sun or
   with the presence of high absolute/relative amounts and numbers of
   n-alkenes in the floral scent.
   The results suggest that the flowers of I. atropurpurea probably evolved
   by pollinator-mediated selection acting primarily on floral colours to
   mimic large achromatic (bee-black) protective shelters used
   preferentially by male solitary bees, and that pollinator visits are
   presumably not the result of an odour-based sexual stimulation or
   motivated by an increased morning floral heat reward in tunnels facing
   the rising sun.}},

Abstract = {{Most flowers are visited by a wide range of potential pollinators.
   However, their efficiency in pollen removal and deposition, and other
   behavioural factors affecting pollination effectiveness may greatly
   differ among taxa, and even individuals. Fritillary (Fritillaria
   meleagris L., Liliaceae) is a spring-flowering, critically endangered
   plant in the Polish flora, red-listed in most of the European countries
   of its range. Based on indirect evidence, that is, body pollen loads,
   visitation frequency and seasonal abundance, it is estimated that its
   key pollinators are queen bumblebees, but, as shown in the literature,
   the largest Fritillaria pollen loads are carried by solitary bees. To
   study pollinator effectiveness for floral visitors to F. meleagris, we
   performed a garden experiment, where we analysed pollen deposition and
   assessed pollen removal per single flower-visit in the plant. Similarly
   to field conditions reported in the literature, our experimental plants
   were serviced by nectar-seeking bumblebee queens and two taxa of
   solitary bees, small pollen-collecting Andrena and large, nectar-seeking
   Anthophora males. When ``quality{''} component was addressed, despite
   the character of visits, insects from all groups deposited more pollen
   than was found on unvisited flowers, but they did not differ
   significantly from each other in pollen deposition on virgin stigmas. We
   also found some differences in pollen removal both within- and
   among-visitor species and control flowers, unfortunately due to
   extremely high variation of the results they were all statistically
   insignificant. However, when ``quantity{''} component of insect
   performance was concerned, we observed that over 81 \% of visits were by
   bumblebees. Bombus queens stayed on flowers significantly less time than
   small Andrena individuals (13 \% of recorded visits) and equally long as
   Anthophora males (only 6 \% of visits). We conclude that although all
   the visitor groups can pollinate the flowers of F. meleagris, bumblebee
   queens indeed proved to be the most effective pollinators of the plant,
   when both quality and quantity components of pollination are concerned.}},

Abstract = {{Plant individuals rely on pollinator services for their reproduction and
   often have to share these services with co-occurring neighbours,
   creating complex indirect plantplant interactions. Many current
   theoretical models focus on the effect of floral resources' density on
   the net outcome of these indirect plantplant interactions, often
   neglecting the identity of plant species in the communities and
   especially the species' spatial pattern. To fill this gap, we created a
   spatially explicit model whose goal was to study the interplay between
   relative densities and spatial distribution patterns of two plant
   species differing in their attractiveness for pollinators. Since theory
   predicts that pollinator behaviour strongly governs the outcome of
   pollination, we allowed the pollinators to systematically change their
   plant preferences based on their foraging experience. Thus the interplay
   between density and spatial patterns of plants was tested over a
   continuum of behaviours from specialists to generalists. Our most
   striking finding was that reproductive success of the less attractive
   species was affected in an opposite way by spatial patterns depending on
   whether the species had relatively low or high densities. Namely, when
   the less attractive species was highly abundant, its survival was higher
   when aggregated in large monospecific patches than when uniformly
   distributed. On the other hand, when the attractive species was more
   abundant, the less attractive species survived better when uniformly
   distributed. These results were consistent as long as the scale of the
   plant spatial aggregation was similar to or larger than the pollinators'
   detection range. Our results suggest that aggregated plant spatial
   patterns manipulate pollinator behaviour by trapping them within
   monospecific patches. This effect was sufficiently strong to enhance the
   survival of a competitively inferior species and hence to act in a way
   similar to the more familiar niche or temporal separation among plant
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. The Blakeeae (Melastomataceae) comprise nearly 200
   species in Blakea and Topobea and another 10 species in Chalybea and
   Huilaea. The former two genera have been separated primarily on the
   basis of characters pertaining to anther morphology. Combined molecular
   and morphological phylogenetic analyses were conducted to evaluate
   generic limits, reconstruct patterns of morphological character
   evolution, and identify clades within the tribe.
   Methodology. To test the monophyly of Blakea and Topobea, we analyzed
   111 morphological characters, nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed
   spacer region, the accD-psaI and atpB-rbcL spacer regions, and trnL-trnF
   nucleotide sequence data, using maximum likelihood and parsimony in
   individual and variously combined data sets comprising up to 3955
   characters and 135 terminals.
   Pivotal results. Chalybea and Huilaea were recovered as a clade sister
   to the clade of Blakea and Topobea. Neither of the latter two genera was
   resolved as being monophyletic in any analysis, nor does anther
   morphology support their separation. Five infrageneric groupings were
   discovered, and their synapomorphic morphological characters and natural
   history are discussed.
   Conclusions. We present the first phylogenetic analysis of the Blakeeae,
   using combined molecular and morphological characters. Topobea must be
   transferred to Blakea. Within Blakea, a single shift from bee to
   vertebrate pollination has occurred, and this clade is well defined by
   morphological synapomorphies, including pseudocampanulate corollas and
   stomatal nectaries on the anther connectives. Floral mimicry is
   hypothesized to occur in the Solanum flowered clade.}},

Abstract = {{Although primary forests are important for biological conservation, the
   value of secondary forests for forest-dependent organisms needs to be
   evaluated when habitat restoration is required. We examined whether
   flower-visiting insects can use secondary forests as alternative
   habitats to primary forests. In particular, we compared assemblages of
   bees (Anthophila) and flower longhorn beetles (Lepturinae: Cerambycidae)
   in young secondary, mature secondary, and primary forests. Our results
   showed that more bee species were captured in primary and mature
   secondary forests than in young secondary forests, and flower longhorn
   beetle species were captured more frequently in primary forests than in
   mature and young secondary forests. Ordination showed that the
   communities in the three forest types were not statistically identical,
   which indicated that secondary forests cannot provide an absolute
   alternative habitat to primary forests for bees and flower longhorn
   beetles. However, the results also suggest that as secondary forests
   mature, more primary forest species would be able to use secondary
   forests as habitats. This implies that restoration from other land uses,
   such as monoculture plantations, to secondary forests could help to
   promote the faunal biodiversity of primary forests.}},

Abstract = {{Chaetodactylus krombeini (Baker) (Acari: Chaetodactylidae) is a
   cleptoparasitic mite that negatively affects propagation of Osmia spp.
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) for orchard pollination in the USA. This
   study was conducted to determine the effect of C. krombeini on mortality
   of male and female Osmia cornifrons, the Japanese hornfaced bee. A total
   of 107 O. cornifrons nests were examined to determine within-nest
   distribution of C. krombeini with regression analyses. A total of 30
   mite-free O. cornifrons nests were observed and within-nest distribution
   of male and female O. cornifrons was determined with non-linear
   regression analyses. In addition, cocoons from 20 mite-infested O.
   cornifrons cells were examined to determine whether C. krombeini could
   be found inside cocoons of O. cornifrons. The results of this study
   showed that female O. cornifrons and C. krombeini were found more
   frequently in the inner part of the nest, and male O. cornifrons were
   found mostly in the center of the nest. No C. krombeini were found
   inside O. cornifrons cocoons. These results indicate that C. krombeini
   have a greater negative impact on mortality in the egg and larval stages
   of female O. cornifrons than in male O. cornifrons. Implications for
   management of C. krombeini and O. cornifrons populations for orchard
   pollination are discussed in this article.}},

Abstract = {{Plant secondary compounds mediate interactions with insects and other
   animals. The norditerpene alkaloids are significant secondary compounds
   in Delphinium (larkspur) species which are divided into two classes: the
   7, 8-methylenedioxylycoctonine (MDL-type) and N-(methylsuccinimido)
   anthranoyllycoctonine (MSAL-type), and are known to be toxic to
   herbivorous insects and livestock. Alkaloid concentrations were measured
   in a whole plant context in vegetative and floral tissues as well as
   rewards (pollen and nectar) in Delphinium barbeyi and Delphinium
   nuttallianum. Alkaloid concentrations differed between vegetative
   tissues, floral tissues and floral rewards. Alkaloid concentrations in
   floral parts were consistent with optimal defense theory, with tissues
   more closely tied to plant fitness, such as fruits, being more heavily
   defended than foliage. However, alkaloid concentrations were
   significantly lower in nectar compared to other tissues. The
   norditerpene alkaloids influenced the activity of bumble bees, the
   dominant pollinator of larkspur, but the effects were concentration
   dependent. Alkaloids in nectar are found at concentrations that have no
   effect on bee activity; however, if alkaloid concentrations in nectar
   were similar to those in foliage bee activity would be reduced
   significantly. These results suggest that nectar with low alkaloid
   concentrations may be beneficial to plant fitness by limiting adverse
   effects on pollinator activity. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{649-656}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Biotic interactions have been considered as an important factor to be
   included in species distribution modelling, but little is known about
   how different types of interaction or different strategies for modelling
   affect model performance. This study compares different methods for
   including interspecific interactions in distribution models for bees,
   their brood parasites, and the plants they pollinate. Hostparasite
   interactions among bumble bees (genus Bombus: generalist pollinators and
   brood parasites) and specialist plantpollinator interactions between
   Centris bees and Krameria flowers were used as case studies. We used 7
   different modelling algorithms available in the BIOMOD R package. For
   Bombus, the inclusion of interacting species distributions generally
   increased model predictive accuracy. The improvement was better when the
   interacting species was included with its raw distribution rather than
   with its modeled suitability. However, incorporating the distributions
   of non-interacting species sometimes resulted in similarly increased
   model accuracy despite their being no significance of any interaction
   for the distribution. For the Centris-Krameria system the best strategy
   for modelling biotic interactions was to include the interacting species
   model-predicted values. However, the results were less consistent than
   those for Bombus species, and most models including biotic interactions
   showed no significant improvement over abiotic models. Our results are
   consistent with previous studies showing that biotic interactions can be
   important in structuring species distributions at regional scales.
   However, correlations between species distributions are not necessarily
   indicative of interactions. Therefore, choosing the correct biotic
   information, based on biological and ecological knowledge, is critical
   to improve the accuracy of species distribution models and forecast
   distribution change.}},

Abstract = {{In intensive agricultural landscapes, restoration within farms could
   enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services such as pollination by
   native pollinators. Although governments and conservation groups are
   promoting small-scale restoration on working farms, there are few
   studies that assess whether these practices enhance pollinator
   communities in restored areas. Further, there is no information on
   whether floral enhancements will deplete pollinators in adjacent fields
   by concentrating ambient populations or whether they result in a net
   increase in abundance in adjacent farm fields. We investigated whether
   field edges restored with native perennial plants in California's
   Central Valley agricultural region increased floral abundance and
   potential bee nesting sites, and native bee and syrphid fly abundance
   and diversity, in comparison to relatively unmanaged edges. Native bees
   and syrphid flies collected from flowers were more abundant,
   species-rich, and diverse at hedgerow sites than in weedy, unmanaged
   edges. Abundance of bees collected passively in pan traps was negatively
   correlated with floral abundance, was significantly different from
   communities captured by net sampling from flowers, and did not
   distinguish between site types; we therefore focused on the results of
   net samples and visual observations. Uncommon species of native bees
   were sevenfold more abundant on hedgerow flowers than on flowers at
   weedy, unmanaged edges. Of the species on flowers at hedgerows, 40\%
   were exclusive to hedgerow sites, but there were no species exclusively
   found on flowers at control sites. Hedgerows were especially important
   for supporting less-common species of native bees in our intensive
   agricultural landscape. Hedgerows did not concentrate ambient native
   bee, honey bee, or syphid fly populations, and they acted as net
   exporters of native bees into adjacent fields. Within-farm habitat
   restoration such as hedgerow creation may be essential for enhancing
   native pollinator abundance and diversity, and for pollination services
   to adjacent crops.}},

Abstract = {{Although solitary bees are considered to play key roles in ecosystem
   functions, surprisingly few studies have explored their population
   dynamics. We investigated the population dynamics of a rare, declining,
   solitary bee (Andrena humilis) in a landscape of 80 km 2 in southern
   Sweden from 2003 to 2011. Only one population was persistent throughout
   all years studied; most likely this population supplied the surrounding
   landscape with 11 smaller, temporary local populations. Despite stable
   pollen availability, the size of the persistent population fluctuated
   dramatically in a two-year cycle over the nine years, with 490-1230
   nests in odd-numbered years and 21-48 nests in even-numbered years.
   These fluctuations were not significantly related to climatic variables
   or pollen availability. Nineteen colonization and 14 extinction events
   were recorded. Occupancy decreased with distance from the persistent
   population and increased with increasing resource (pollen) availability.
   There were significant positive correlations between the size of the
   persistent population and patch occupancy and colonization.
   Colonizations were generally more common in patches closer to the
   persistent population, whereas extinctions were independent of distance
   from the persistent population. Our results highlight the complex
   population dynamics that exist for this solitary bee species, which
   could be due to source-sink dynamics, a prolonged diapause, or can
   represent a bet-hedging strategy to avoid natural enemies and survive in
   small habitat patches. If large fluctuations in solitary bee populations
   prove to be widespread, it will have important implications for
   interpreting ecological relationships, bee conservation, and
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and quantifying constraints to multiple ecosystem service
   delivery and biodiversity is vital for developing management strategies
   for current and future human well-being. A particular challenge is to
   reconcile demand for increased food production with provision of other
   ecosystem services and biodiversity. Using a spatially extensive data
   base (covering Great Britain) of co-located biophysical measurements
   (collected in the Countryside Survey), we explore the relationships
   between ecosystem service indicators and biodiversity across a temperate
   ecosystem productivity gradient. Each service indicator has an
   individual response curve demonstrating that simultaneous analysis of
   multiple ecosystem services is essential for optimal service management.
   The shape of the response curve can be used to indicate whether land
   sharing' (provision of multiple services from the same land parcel) or
   land sparing' (single service prioritization) is the most appropriate
   option. Soil carbon storage and above-ground net primary production
   indicators were found to define opposing ends of a primary gradient in
   service provision. Biodiversity and water quality indicators were
   highest at intermediate levels of both factors, consistent with a
   unimodal relationship along a productivity gradient. Positive
   relationships occurred between multiple components of biodiversity,
   measured as taxon richness of all plants, bee and butterfly nectar
   plants, soil invertebrates and freshwater macroinvertebrates, indicating
   potential for management measures directed at one aspect of biodiversity
   to deliver wider ecosystem biodiversity. We demonstrate that in
   temperate, human-dominated landscapes, ecosystem services are highly
   constrained by a fundamental productivity gradient. There are immediate
   trade-offs between productivity and soil carbon storage but potential
   synergies with services with different shaped relationships to
   production. Synthesis and applications. Using techniques such as
   response curves to analyse multiple service interactions can inform the
   development of Spatial Decision Support tools and landscape-scale
   ecosystem service management options. At intermediate productivity,
   land-sharing' would optimize multiple services, however, to deliver
   significant soil carbon storage land-sparing' is required, that is,
   resources focused in low productivity areas with high carbon to maximize
   investment return. This study emphasizes that targets for services per
   unit area need to be set within the context of the national gradients
   reported here to ensure best use of limited resources.}},

Abstract = {{Large bees such as species from Xylocopa Latreille are usually
   associated with pollination in tropical sand dune areas, which
   frequently present shrubby herbaceous vegetation adapted to conditions
   of high salinity, high solar radiation and strong winds. We report on
   the diversity of Xylocopa and the plants they visited to collect nectar
   and pollen, focusing on the floral syndromes they present in these
   plants and on the breadth of the trophic niche in a tropical sand dune
   fragment over the year. The field work was carried out monthly in Baixio
   (Bahia, Brazil; Northern Coast Environmental Protection Area) from April
   2008 to March 2009, over two consecutive days, from 06:30 AM to 05:00
   PM. The medium-large body sized Xylocopa (Neoxylocopa) cearensis Ducke
   and Xylocopa (Schonnherria) subcyanea P,rez were noticeable for their
   frequency, constancy on the flowers and sharing of plant species.
   Xylocopa spp. visited plants with flowers of different shapes, colors,
   inflorescence arrangement and syndromes. However, their resource
   collections were mainly concentrated on Cuphea brachiata, Waltheria
   cinerascens, Croton sellowii and Chamaecrista ramosa, which may be
   considered key species for Xylocopa spp. maintenance in coastal sand
   dune and restinga environments in Northeast Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Although agricultural habitats can provide enormous amounts of food
   resources for pollinator species, links between agricultural and
   (semi-)natural habitats through dispersal and foraging movements have
   hardly been studied. In 67 study sites, we assessed the interactions
   between mass-flowering oilseed rape fields and semi-natural grasslands
   at different spatial scales, and their effects on the number of brood
   cells of a solitary cavity-nesting bee. The probability that the bee
   Osmia bicornis colonized trap nests in oilseed rape fields increased
   from 12 to 59 \% when grassland was nearby, compared to fields isolated
   from grassland. In grasslands, the number of brood cells of O. bicornis
   in trap nests was 55 \% higher when adjacent to oilseed rape compared to
   isolated grasslands. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval
   food was higher in oilseed rape fields and grasslands adjacent to
   oilseed rape than in isolated grasslands. In both oilseed rape fields
   and grasslands, the number of brood cells was positively correlated with
   the percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food. We show that
   mass-flowering agricultural habitats-even when they are intensively
   managed-can strongly enhance the abundance of a solitary bee species
   nesting in nearby semi-natural habitats. Our results suggest that
   positive effects of agricultural habitats have been underestimated and
   might be very common (at least) for generalist species in landscapes
   consisting of a mixture of agricultural and semi-natural habitats. These
   effects might also have-so far overlooked-implications for interspecific
   competition and mutualistic interactions in semi-natural habitats.}},

Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{78-81}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Metals in soil are known to negatively affect the health of many groups
   of organisms, but it is unclear whether they can affect plant-pollinator
   interactions, and whether pollinators that visit plants growing on
   contaminated soils are at risk of ingesting potentially toxic resources.
   We address whether the presence of metals in nectar alters foraging
   behavior by bumblebees by manipulating nectar with one of two common
   soil contaminants (Al or Ni) in flowers of Impatiens capensis
   (Balsaminaceae). While the presence of Al in nectar did not influence
   foraging patterns by bumblebees, flowers containing Ni nectar solutions
   were visited for shorter time periods relative to controls, and
   discouraged bees from visiting nearby Ni-contaminated flowers. However,
   because bumblebees still visited these flowers, they likely ingested a
   potentially toxic resource. Our findings suggest that soil metals could
   cascade to negatively affect pollinators in metal contaminated
   environments. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Plant Pollinator Networks along a Gradient of Urbanisation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Habitat loss is one of the principal causes of the current
   pollinator decline. With agricultural intensification, increasing
   urbanisation is among the main drivers of habitat loss. Consequently
   studies focusing on pollinator community structure along urbanisation
   gradients have increased in recent years. However, few studies have
   investigated how urbanisation affects plant-pollinator interaction
   networks. Here we assessed modifications of plant-pollinator
   interactions along an urbanisation gradient based on the study of their
   morphological relationships.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Along an urbanisation gradient
   comprising four types of landscape contexts (semi-natural, agricultural,
   suburban, urban), we set up experimental plant communities containing
   two plant functional groups differing in their morphological traits
   ({''}open flowers'' and ``tubular flowers''). Insect visitations on
   these communities were recorded to build plant-pollinator networks. A
   total of 17 857 interactions were recorded between experimental plant
   communities and flower-visitors. The number of interactions performed by
   flower-visitors was significantly lower in urban landscape context than
   in semi-natural and agricultural ones. In particular, insects such as
   Syrphidae and solitary bees that mostly visited the open flower
   functional group were significantly impacted by urbanisation, which was
   not the case for bumblebees. Urbanisation also impacted the generalism
   of flower-visitors and we detected higher interaction evenness in urban
   landscape context than in agricultural and suburban ones. Finally, in
   urban context, these modifications lowered the potential reproductive
   success of the open flowers functional group.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings show that open flower plant
   species and their specific flower-visitors are especially sensitive to
   increasing urbanisation. These results provide new clues to improve
   conservation measures within urbanised areas in favour of specialist
   flower-visitors. To complete this functional approach, studies using
   networks resolved to the species level along urbanised gradients would
   be required.}},

Abstract = {{Many short-lived desert organisms remain in diapause during drought.
   Theoretically, the cues desert species use to continue diapause through
   drought should differ depending on the availability of critical
   resources, but the unpredictability and infrequent occurrence of climate
   extremes and reduced insect activity during such events make empirical
   tests of this prediction difficult. An intensive study of a diverse
   bee-plant community through a drought event found that bee specialists
   of a drought-sensitive host plant were absent in the drought year in
   contrast to generalist bees and to specialist bees of a
   drought-insensitive host plant. Different responses of bee species to
   drought indicate that the diapause cues used by bee species allow them
   to reliably predict host availability. Species composition of the bee
   community in drought shifted towards mostly generalist species. However,
   we predict that more frequent and extended drought, predicted by climate
   change models for southwest North America, will result in bee
   communities that are species-poor and dominated by specialist species,
   as found today in the most arid desert region of North America.}},

Abstract = {{Systropha is a small genus of bees belonging to Rophitinae (sister-group
   to all remaining Halictidae). Three subgenera are recognized in
   Systropha: Austrosystropha and Systrophidia that are sub-Saharan
   endemics, and Systropha s.str., which occurs in Africa and Eurasia. As a
   result of the rarity of Systropha specimens in collections and the
   difficulty in associating males and females due to sexual dimorphism,
   there remain numerous undescribed or unassociated sexes in S.
   (Austrosystropha). The present paper gives the descriptions of a new
   species Systropha oti sp. n. (from Kenya) and the previously undescribed
   female of S. aethiopica, both in the subgenus Austrosystropha. We
   further discuss the diagnostic features of the subgenus with regard to
   these new taxa and update the previous key to species.}},

Abstract = {{Coloured pan trapping is a simple and efficient method for collecting
   flying insects, yet there is still discussion over the most effective
   bowl colour to use for particular target groups (e.g. pollinator
   insects). The success of particular colours can vary across bioregions
   and habitats. Most published pan trap studies have been conducted in the
   northern hemisphere, and very few investigated the effects of habitat on
   pan trap catches. Our study is one of the first to (1) sample for
   potential pollinators in Australian mallee vegetation and almond
   orchards and (2) investigate whether habitat interacts with trap colour
   to influence pan trap catches. We sampled Hymenoptera and Diptera using
   yellow, white and blue pan traps in native mallee vegetation and two
   types of managed almond orchards (monoculture and plant-diverse) in the
   Murray Mallee bioregion of north-western Victoria, Australia. Yellow
   traps caught the most insects across all habitats, although catches in
   each colour trap varied with habitat. For all insect groups combined,
   blue traps caught more individuals in mallee habitats than in almond
   orchards. For native hymenopterans, yellow traps caught more individuals
   in plant-diverse orchards than in native sites, while blue traps caught
   more individuals in native sites. Our results highlight the importance
   of considering the habitat of individual pan trapping surveys, as no one
   trap colour is likely to be suitable for trapping target insects across
   all habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The use of bee attractants, Bee-Q and Fruit Boost (TM) in the

   evaluated to understand honeybee visitation patterns on the target crop
   and pollination efficiency. Results indicate that applications of Bee-Q
   at 12.5 g/l and Fruit boost at 0.75 ml/l on niger plots significantly
   increased the number of bee foragers over control plots. In addition,
   plots sprayed with these bee attractants significantly enhanced the seed
   set, seed weight, and germination of niger. This study suggests that
   pheromone-based bee attractants applied to niger can increase the

Abstract = {{Incipient forms of the ichnogenera Celliforma, ?Rebuffoichnus,
   Tombownichnus, Taenidium, Chubutolites and Machichnus and, in addition,
   complex forms of probable termite galleries, beetle galleries and mammal
   burrows were found in masonry, plasters and surrounding (both natural
   and man-made) deposits in the ancient Abusir necropolis. Among the ways
   of the classification of the material, the use of standard
   ichnotaxonomic names appeared to be more objective and more correct than
   mere estimations of possible tracemakers as made colloquially in the
   past. The realistic classification enables a useful interpretation in
   such a context through dating (radiometric dating is possible if the
   tunnels are lined with organic matter), specification of depth of
   burrowing/bioerosion (some insect structures show a highly specific
   depth below the substrate surface) and identification of the tracemaker
   (insect family, genus, species). Having such information, it is
   possible, e.g., to recognize that the wall of a building was
   exposed/unburied during certain time interval and that the environment
   was favourable for the development of the tracemaker (e.g.,
   clover-pollinating solitary bees). Three basic colonization times were
   recognized: first, 2760 +/- 35 B.P. = ca 750 B.C.; second, 645 +/- 30

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{Landscape, in terms of crop diversity, together with spatial
   heterogeneity, connectivity and the proportion of natural elements all
   play a key role in the quality of the agricultural matrix. The abundant
   resources derived from the high productivity associated with cultivated
   lands within agricultural landscapes - formed by mosaics comprising
   small elements and systems of low agricultural intensity - may favour
   the populations and communities of certain insect species.
   Here, trap-nesting solitary bees have been studied to evaluate the
   effect of two Mediterranean crop systems: monocrops (vineyard and
   cereal) and polycrops (mixed vegetable crop) for two levels of farming
   intensity (high-intensity vs. low-intensity) on brood cells and emergent
   progeny of the bee population and community species richness.
   Polycrops proved favourable compared to monocrops, with the former
   proving particularly favourable for offspring production (brood cells
   and emergent progeny) of bees belonging to the genus Osmia. Bee
   populations, especially polylectic species, may benefit from the traits
   characterizing this polycrop, which provide plentiful and diverse
   resources both in space and time. Farming intensity, regardless the crop
   type, is also an important factor affecting bee community structure. Low
   farming intensity maintains essential semi-natural habitats providing
   shelter for species-rich communities. Crop richness, together with low
   farming intensity would provide heterogeneous landscapes with a variety
   of natural and cultivated resources, benefitting trap-nesting bee
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the diversity of euglossine bees in ten areas of
   Atlantic Forest Domain in So Paulo State, Brazil. Bees were collected
   with odor baits for 2 years, from March 2007 to March 2009. From a
   standardized effort during the first year of sampling, we compare the
   four areas using indexes of diversity, evenness, and similarity of
   euglossine communities. In the second year, we added six new places for
   presenting a general overview on the Atlantic forest in So Paulo. A
   total of 2,395 individuals of 23 species were recorded in the study
   areas. Ilhabela had the highest number of species (19) and individuals
   (1,260). The most attractive odor bait was eucalyptol, which attracted
   16 species and 58 \% of all individuals. Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus
   1958) was the most abundant species, representing 50 \% of the
   individuals sampled; apparently, populations of this species are more
   abundant at low altitudes, as for example on islands and on the coast.
   The results also suggest a difference in richness among altitudes, since
   coastal areas (where the climatic variation are milder) had more
   species. The present study advances knowledge on the occurrence of
   euglossine bees in the Atlantic Forest and fills the lack of a
   systematic study of these bees of coastal areas in So Paulo State.}},

Abstract = {{Potential declines in native pollinator communities and increased
   reliance on pollinator-dependent crops have raised concerns about native
   pollinator conservation and dispersal across human-altered landscapes.
   Bumble bees are one of the most effective native pollinators and are
   often the first to be extirpated in human-altered habitats, yet little
   is known about how bumble bees move across fine spatial scales and what
   landscapes promote or limit their gene flow. In this study, we examine
   regional genetic differentiation and fine-scale relatedness patterns of
   the yellow-faced bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, to investigate how
   current and historic habitat composition impact gene flow. We conducted
   our study across a landscape mosaic of natural, agricultural and
   urban/suburban habitats, and we show that B. vosnesenskii exhibits low
   but significant levels of differentiation across the study system
   (FST=0.019, Dest=0.049). Most importantly, we reveal significant
   relationships between pairwise FST and resistance models created from
   contemporary land use maps. Specifically, B.vosnesenskii gene flow is
   most limited by commercial, industrial and transportation-related
   impervious cover. Finally, our fine-scale analysis reveals significant
   but declining relatedness between individuals at the 19km spatial scale,
   most likely due to local queen dispersal. Overall, our results indicate
   that B.vosnesenskii exhibits considerable local dispersal and that
   regional gene flow is significantly limited by impervious cover
   associated with urbanization.}},

Title = {{Outcrossing rates in two self-compatible, hybridising Rhinanthus
   species: implications for hybrid formation}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{541-547}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The congeners Rhinanthus angustifolius and Rhinanthus minor, two annual
   hemiparasites pollinated by bumblebees, are known to hybridise in the
   wild. Both species are self-compatible, but the capacity for autonomous
   selfing is higher in R.minor. This suggests a difference in realized
   outcrossing rates, which have not been determined before in these
   species. Using microsatellites, both species turned out to have mixed
   mating systems, but with a much lower multilocus outcrossing rate (0.13)
   for R.minor compared to R.angustifolius (0.76). We hypothesised that a
   higher outcrossing rate should lead to a higher chance of heterospecific
   pollination, and we therefore determined the rate of hybrid formation on
   each species in an artificial mixed population. Hybrid seeds were
   produced at low frequency (4.5\%), and no significant difference was
   found between the species. It is therefore likely that post-pollination
   processes influence hybrid seed formation to counteract the expected
   difference in heterospecific pollen deposition. We checked fruit set,
   seed set and the rate of autonomous selfing in controlled crosses in the
   greenhouse in 2years, and found that fruit set (2003) or seed set (2010)
   were lower in R.angustifoliusxR.minor crosses relative to the reciprocal
   cross. Hybrid seeds produced on R.angustifolius also had a much lower
   germination rate, so most of the established F1 hybrid plants have the
   R.minor cytoplasm. The formation of advanced hybrids depends on
   pollinator preference, which is biased towards R.angustifolius if
   present in sufficient numbers, because it offers more rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Stenocereus quevedonis (pitire') is a columnar cactus endemic to central
   Mexico, grown for its edible fruit. Phenology, pollination biology and
   behaviour of flower visitors of this species were compared in six
   conserved and disturbed sites, hypothesising that: (i) pitire
   pollination is self-incompatible, requiring animal vectors; (ii) higher
   incidence of radiation on plants in cleared forest may lead to a higher
   number of flowers per pitire plant and longer blooming season, and
   disturbing and differential spatial availability of flower resources may
   determine differential attraction of pollinators to conserved and
   disturbed areas; (iii) if pitire pollination system is specialised,
   reproductive success would decrease with pollinator scarcity, or other
   species may substitute for main pollinators. In all sites, pitire
   reproduction started in January, flowering peak occurring in April,
   anthesis duration was 15h and predominantly nocturnal (9h), pollen was
   released at 23:00h, nectar was produced throughout anthesis, and
   breeding system was self-incompatible. Flower production per plant was
   similar in disturbed and conserved sites, but flower availability was
   higher (because of higher tree density) and longer in disturbed sites.
   Pollination is nocturnal, the most frequent legitimate pollinator being
   the bat Leptonycteris yerbabuenae; diurnal pollination is rare but
   possible, carried out by bee species. Fruit and seed set in control and
   nocturnal pollination treatments at disturbed sites were higher than in
   conserved sites. Frequency of L.yerbabuenae visits was similar among
   site types, but more visits of complementary nocturnal and diurnal
   pollinators were recorded in disturbed sites, which could explain
   differences in reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. The insect-like flowers of the Ophrys orchids are
   adapted to sexually deceptive pollination through pseudocopulation,
   providing chemical, visual, and tactile stimuli for male insects.
   Although the chemical composition of the odor bouquet of several species
   has long been identified, the precise site of fragrance production in
   the labellum remains unknown for most species, and little attention has
   been given to the visual and tactile signals provided by the labellum
   for pollinators. Here, the occurrence of an osmophore is investigated
   and the labellum micromorphology is characterized in detail for Ophrys
   bombyliflora and Ophrys tenthredinifera, two closely related species
   pollinated by Eucera bees.
   Methodology. Labella of flowers before and at anthesis were studied with
   scanning electron microscopy, light microscopy, and histochemistry.
   Pivotal results. The labellum of O. bombyliflora presents a distinctive
   hidden apical appendix that forms a concavity with a multicellular
   protuberance and a tuft of trichomes at the tip. An osmophore occurs in
   the apical region of the labellum in both species; in O. bombyliflora it
   is confined mostly to the adaxial surface of the appendix, and in O.
   tenthredinifera it comprises the labellum margin and the abaxial surface
   of both the appendix and the adjacent region of the labellum. A
   terpene-rich lipophilic secretion likely containing a phenolic fraction
   was found. The two species have a great diversity of epidermal cell
   types in the adaxial surface of the labellum and differ mainly in the
   micromorphology of the basal field, speculum, labellum margins, and
   appendix.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrates for the first time that a
   specialized secretory structure (osmophore) occurs in the labellum of
   both species and synthesizes a secretion that probably includes highly
   volatile long-range attractants for pollinators. This finding seems to
   suggest that two sources of potential semiochemicals have evolved in the
   Ophrys labellum for pollinator attraction.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, oilseed rape is the principal crop used in the production of
   edible and renewable fuel oil products. Insect pollinators, in
   particular bees, have been shown to have a positive effect on the seed
   set of this crop. We undertook experiments looking at behavioural
   differences between honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bees visiting
   oilseed rape flowers, and related this to landscape scale responses in
   visitation rates. We found that behavioural differences between
   honeybees, bumblebees and solitary bees alter the likelihood of pollen
   transfer from their bodies to the plant stigma. Solitary bees and
   bumblebees tend to have greater rates of stigmal contact than honeybees.
   The interactions between the likelihood of free pollen on bodies and the
   probability of stigmal contact suggest that only 34.0\% of visitations
   by honeybees were likely to result in pollen transfer to the stigma,
   relative to 35.1\% for the bumblebees and 71.3\% for solitary bees.
   Visitation rates were higher for honeybees in high quality landscapes
   with relatively large areas of alternative foraging habitat. Visitation
   rates of honeybees were also more frequent in the vicinity of managed
   hives. For solitary bees and bumblebees visitation rates did not respond
   to landscape structure, although more species of solitary bees were
   found in landscapes with a high cover of semi-natural grassland. While
   honeybees may be less efficient in pollen transfer per unit visit, where
   they numerically outweigh other types of bees in a crop (e.g. around
   managed hives) this may not be important. For this reason the relative
   ease with which hives can be moved across landscape means that honeybees
   are perhaps the most suitable taxa for use as a pro-active mitigation
   measure against pollinator deficits. However, the greater efficiency of
   solitary bees compensates for the effort required to implement longer
   term management (i.e. the establishment of flower rich field margins and
   open soil nesting sites) to support their populations. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify future distribution areas and
   propose actions to preserve passion fruit pollination service under a
   scenario of future climate change. We used four species of Xylocopa bees
   that are important for passion fruit pollination in Brazilian Tropical
   Savannas. We also used the known forage plant species (33 species) that
   are associated with this same area, since passion fruit flowers provide
   only nectar for bees and only during their blossoming period. We used
   species distribution modeling to predict the potential areas of
   occurrence for each bee and plant based on the current day distribution
   and a future climate scenario (moderate projections of climate change to
   2050). We used a geographic information system to classify the models
   and to analyze the future areas for both groups of species. The current
   day distribution map showed that Xylocopa and plant species occurred
   primarily in the southern and central-eastern areas of the Brazilian
   Tropical Savannas. In the north, Xylocopa species only occurred in a
   small area between the states of Maranhao and Piaui while forage plant
   species were only observed in the northern part of the Tocantins State.
   However, both future scenarios (bees and plants) showed a shift in
   distribution, with occurrence predominantly detected in the northern
   areas of Brazilian Tropical Savannas. Possible conservation areas and
   the use of appropriate agricultural practices were suggested to ensure
   the maintenance of the bee/plant focal species. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Soils in beds of commercially managed Nomia melanderi were manipulated
   with surface treatments to reduce or increase temperatures at nest
   depths of 20 cm. Modifying soil temperatures affected pupation rate and
   emergence date of N. melanderi. In 2010, white chalk dust delayed peak
   bee emergence by one week, and clear plastic mulch initiated peak
   emergence one week earlier, significantly increasing overall bee
   emergence compared to uncovered areas. In 2011, treatments included
   white chalk dust and plastic agricultural sheets including clear, red,
   black, white-on-black, blue, and brown. In 2011, clear plastic sheeting
   initiated early emergence while white chalk dust and white-on-black
   plastic plots delayed emergence. Expediting or postponing N. melanderi
   emergence could potentially allow alfalfa seed producers to extend the
   bees' foraging season over a greater time period, subsequently
   increasing pollination, seed set, and economic returns.}},

Abstract = {{Bees provide essential pollination services that are potentially
   affected both by local farm management and the surrounding landscape. To
   better understand these different factors, we modelled the relative
   effects of landscape composition (nesting and floral resources within
   foraging distances), landscape configuration (patch shape, interpatch
   connectivity and habitat aggregation) and farm management (organic vs.
   conventional and local-scale field diversity), and their interactions,
   on wild bee abundance and richness for 39 crop systems globally. Bee
   abundance and richness were higher in diversified and organic fields and
   in landscapes comprising more high-quality habitats; bee richness on
   conventional fields with low diversity benefited most from high-quality
   surrounding land cover. Landscape configuration effects were weak. Bee
   responses varied slightly by biome. Our synthesis reveals that
   pollinator persistence will depend on both the maintenance of
   high-quality habitats around farms and on local management practices
   that may offset impacts of intensive monoculture agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Prezygotic barriers play a major role in the evolution of reproductive
   isolation, which is a prerequisite for speciation. However, despite
   considerable progress in identifying genes and mutations responsible for
   postzygotic isolation, little is known about the genetic and molecular
   basis underlying prezygotic barriers. The bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus
   lewisii and the hummingbird-pollinated M. cardinalis represent a classic
   example of pollinator-mediated prezygotic isolation between two sister
   species in sympatry. Flower color differences resulting from both
   carotenoid and anthocyanin pigments contribute to pollinator
   discrimination between the two species in nature. Through fine-scale
   genetic mapping, site-directed mutagenesis, and transgenic experiments,
   we demonstrate that a single-repeat R3 MYB repressor, ROSE INTENSITY1
   (ROI1), is the causal gene underlying a major quantitative trait locus
   (QTL) with the largest effect on anthocyanin concentration and that
   cis-regulatory change rather than coding DNA mutations cause the allelic
   difference between M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Together with the
   genomic resources and stable transgenic tools developed here, these
   results suggest that Mimulus is an excellent platform for studying the
   genetics of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation and the molecular
   basis of morphological evolution at the most fundamental level-gene by
   gene, mutation by mutation.}},

Abstract = {{In response to evidence of insect pollinator declines, organisations in
   many sectors, including the food and farming industry, are investing in
   pollinator conservation. They are keen to ensure that their efforts use
   the best available science. We convened a group of 32 conservation
   practitioners' with an active interest in pollinators and 16 insect
   pollinator scientists. The conservation practitioners include
   representatives from UK industry (including retail), environmental
   non-government organisations and nature conservation agencies. We
   collaboratively developed a long list of 246 knowledge needs relating to
   conservation of wild insect pollinators in the UK. We refined and
   selected the most important knowledge needs, through a three-stage
   process of voting and scoring, including discussions of each need at a
   workshop. We present the top 35 knowledge needs as scored by
   conservation practitioners or scientists. We find general agreement in
   priorities identified by these two groups. The priority knowledge needs
   will structure ongoing work to make science accessible to practitioners,
   and help to guide future science policy and funding. Understanding the
   economic benefits of crop pollination, basic pollinator ecology and
   impacts of pesticides on wild pollinators emerge strongly as priorities,
   as well as a need to monitor floral resources in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. In flowers that are specialized, floral traits
   often differentiate in association with pollinator shifts. However, in
   species of generalized pollination, the role of pollinators in local
   population differentiation of floral traits is difficult to test. A
   crucial line of evidence is to contrast the direction and strength of
   pollinator selection among populations.
   Methodology. Variation in floral traits and pollinator assemblages was
   investigated in two populations of a generalist-pollinated herb,
   Trollius ranunculoides (Ranunculaceae), to detect the potential role of
   pollinators in floral differentiation.
   Pivotal results. The alpine population was visited more by flies, and
   the subalpine population was visited more by bees. Flower manipulations
   suggested that large flowers were more attractive to both bees and
   flies, while more petals were favored only by nectar-feeding flies.
   Compared to the subalpine population, plants in the alpine population
   had more petals per flower but smaller flowers where flies were
   predominant pollinators. Flower differences appeared to be genetically
   maintained in a common garden. Phenotypic selection analysis indicated
   stronger selection on petal number in the alpine population and
   oppositely more intense selection on flower diameter in the subalpine
   population, in accordance with the preferences of local pollinator
   assemblages.
   Conclusions. Heritability in floral traits, differences in local
   pollinator assemblages, and corresponding differences in phenotypic
   selection are together consistent with the view of pollinator-mediated
   selection on floral differentiation in T. ranunculoides.}},

Abstract = {{The alteration and transformation of the areas surrounding native
   forests due to anthropogenic disturbance can result in differences near
   this newly created boundary, termed edge effects'. Our study describes
   the consequences of edge creation over two successive stages in the life
   cycle of a hemi-parasitic mistletoe (Tristerix corymbosus), which
   determine its reproductive success, in temperate austral forests. We
   assessed how flower production and pollinator visits change with
   distance to the nearest forest edge and how these changes affect fruit
   set, fruit and seed size, and fruit removal by seed dispersers. Edge
   effects were dominated by fruit removal, which increased with the
   distance to the edge, height in the canopy and fruit availability. As a
   result, plant reproduction (in terms of seeds produced and fruits
   removed, which putatively leads to higher seed dispersal) decreased
   strongly near to forest edges. In contrast, visitation rates of the main
   pollinator (the hummingbird) were unaffected by edges, and their strong
   effects on fruit set (including the alleviation of quality pollen
   limitation arising in the forest interior) might be mitigating the
   decrease in bumblebee visitation near to forest edges. Synthesis. Our
   study shows clearly how secondary and tertiary responses to forest edges
   acted in opposite directions (increasing or decreasing plant
   reproductive performance), highlighting the need to study several
   successive processes that impact upon plant fitness under disturbance.
   Preserving relatively large patches of old-growth forest with low
   perimeter/area ratios would be key to the habitat requirements of the
   main disperser and pollinator and thus for mistletoe reproductive
   performance.}},

Title = {{Bumble bee fauna of Palouse Prairie: Survey of native bee pollinators in
   a fragmented ecosystem}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 8}},
Abstract = {{Bumble bees, Bombus Latreille (Hymenoptera: Apidae:), are dominant
   pollinators in the northern hemisphere, providing important pollination
   services for commercial crops and innumerable wild plants. Nationwide
   declines in several bumble bee species and habitat losses in multiple
   ecosystems have raised concerns about conservation of this important
   group. In many regions, such as the Palouse Prairie, relatively little
   is known about bumble bee communities, despite their critical ecosystem
   functions. Pitfall trap surveys for ground beetles in Palouse prairie
   remnants conducted in 2002-2003 contained considerable by-catch of
   bumble bees. The effects of landscape context, remnant features, year,
   and season on bumble bee community composition were examined.
   Additionally, bees captured in 2002-2003 were compared with historic
   records for the region to assess changes in the presence of individual
   species. Ten species of bumble bee were captured, representing the
   majority of the species historically known from the region. Few
   detectable differences in bumble bee abundances were found among
   remnants. Community composition differed appreciably, however, based on
   season, landscape context, and elevation, resulting in different bee
   assemblages between western, low-lying remnants and eastern,
   higher-elevation remnants. The results suggest that conservation of the
   still species-rich bumble bee fauna should take into account variability
   among prairie remnants, and further work is required to adequately
   explain bumble bee habitat associations on the Palouse.}},

Abstract = {{Insects use several senses to forage, detecting floral cues such as
   color, shape, pattern, and volatiles. We report a formerly unappreciated
   sensory modality in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), detection of floral
   electric fields. These fields act as floral cues, which are affected by
   the visit of naturally charged bees. Like visual cues, floral electric
   fields exhibit variations in pattern and structure, which can be
   discriminated by bumblebees. We also show that such electric field
   information contributes to the complex array of floral cues that
   together improve a pollinator's memory of floral rewards. Because floral
   electric fields can change within seconds, this sensory modality may
   facilitate rapid and dynamic communication between flowers and their
   pollinators.}},

   Sao Paulo State, Brazil}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{The Atlantic Forest stretches along Brazil's Atlantic coast, from Rio
   Grande do Norte State in the north to Rio Grande do Sul State in the
   south, and inland as far as Paraguay and the Misiones Province of
   Argentina. This biome is one of the eight biodiversity hotspots in the
   world and is characterized by high species diversity. Euglossini bees
   are known as important pollinators in this biome, where their diversity
   is high. Due to the high impact of human activities in the Atlantic
   Forest, in the present study the community structure of Euglossini was
   assessed in a coastal lowland area, Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar -
   Nucleo Picinguaba (PESM), and in an island, Parque Estadual da Ilha
   Anchieta (PEIA), Ubatuba, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Sampling was carried
   out monthly, from August 2007 to July 2009, using artificial baits with
   14 aromatic compounds to attract males. Twenty-three species were
   recorded. On PEIA, Euglossa cordata (L.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   represented almost two thirds of the total species collected (63.2\%).
   Euglossa iopoecila (23.0\%) was the most abundant species in PESM but
   was not recorded on the island, and Euglossa sapphirina (21.0\%) was the
   second most frequent species in PESM but was represented by only nine
   individuals on PEIA. The results suggest that these two species may act
   as bioindicators of preserved environments, as suggested for other
   Euglossini species. Some authors showed that Eg. cordata is favored by
   disturbed environments, which could explain its high abundance on
   Anchieta Island. Similarly, as emphasized by other authors, the
   dominance of Eg. cordata on the island would be another factor
   indicative of environmental disturbance.}},

   potential pollinators on Mauna Loa Volcano on Hawai'i Island across two
   environmental gradients: elevation (middle and high) and succession
   (early and late). The effects of elevation and successional stage on
   visitation rates and degree of plant specialization were compared.
   Elevation had a significant effect on visitation rates with plants at
   mid elevation receiving the most visits, whereas succession had little
   effect on visitation rates. Both succession and elevation impacted plant
   specialization, with plants at late-succession and high-elevation sites
   being more specialized in terms of their diversity of flower visitors.
   Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) received the most forager visits,
   even when it was not the most abundant plant flowering. Endemic Hylaeus
   bees (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) were the dominant visitors across all
   sites (64\%-91\% of visits), and endemic birds were observed only at mid
   elevation, primarily in the late-succession site. Considering the
   paucity of natural history studies on Hawaiian Hylaeus, further
   investigation of their potential role as pollinators of native Hawaiian
   plants is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring shifting patterns of occurrence and abundance among members of
   pollinator guilds is critical for studies of their ecology, conservation
   and contribution to host pollination. The constitution of floral bee
   guilds is not readily interpreted from passive sampling of bee
   communities (e.g., pan or Malaise traps). Net collecting at flowers
   positively associates bee and flowering species, but do sampling biases
   of individual net collectors obscure real spatiotemporal dynamics in
   floral guilds of bees, or generate spurious differences where no changes
   have occurred? The diverse guild of bees foraging at 1-ha plots of
   creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) was systematically net sampled by
   practiced collectors along randomized belt transects across the
   Chihuahuan, Sonoran and Mojave deserts. These guild samples were
   compared by Horn's Index of Similarity, evaluating the magnitude of
   collector biases contrasted with geographical and temporal variability
   in guild composition. Simultaneous samples taken by several collectors
   were always more similar than those by the same collector in sequential
   years at a site (0.86 vs. 0.54) or concurrently at neighboring sites
   (0.84 vs. 0.61). Pooling collectors' site samples did not alter
   spatiotemporal estimates of guild similarity. Repeated seasonal samples
   by three collectors at one site were very similar for any given day
   (0.90) with the more experienced pair being particularly consistent and
   similar (0.96 +/- 0.01). Seasonal changes of the guild were readily
   detected and quantified. Thus, aerial net sampling provided reliable
   estimates of temporal and spatial dynamics of the Larrea bee guilds once
   the sampling protocol had been practiced. We recommend systematic aerial
   net collecting of pollinators at counted floral host plants to quickly
   and reliably characterize pollinator guilds quantitatively. Systematic
   net sampling of bees taken at a sequence of randomly chosen individuals
   of a given flowering species offers a reliable and replicable means of
   efficiently quantifying variability and change in such floral guilds of
   bees. The method should find application for conservation, agriculture
   and habitat management involving bees and other insect pollinators.}},

   pollinator visitation and native plant pollination in forest remnants}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{160}},
Pages = {{10-18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Habitat loss from urban development threatens native plant populations
   in many regions of the world. In addition to direct plant mortality,
   urban intensification potentially impacts pollinator communities and in
   turn disrupts the pollination mutualisms that are critical to the
   viability of native plant populations. We placed standardized flowering
   plant arrays into woodlands along a gradient of increasing urban land
   use to simultaneously quantify landscape-scale and local-scale effects
   on pollinators and on reproduction of two spring ephemeral wildflowers
   (Claytonia virginica and Polemonium reptans) in woodland fragments in
   the Mid-Atlantic Region of North America. Greater pollinator abundance
   and associated diversity significantly reduced the degree of pollen
   limitation, demonstrating that pollinator populations are critical to
   successful pollination of these plant populations. However,
   landscape-scale habitat loss did not reduce pollinator abundance or
   diversity. Habitat loss at the landscape scale therefore does not appear
   to drive changes in pollination in this woodland system. Rather,
   local-scale habitat characteristics were more important, with
   pollinators being more abundant in brighter woodland patches for one
   plant species, and in larger patches for the other species. Because we
   found abundant pollinators and adequate pollination even in isolated,
   urban woodland fragments, our results are encouraging for the
   conservation of both plants and pollinators in urban landscapes. (C)

   York State, we conducted trap-nest surveys at sites administered by the
   Finger Lakes Land Trust (FLLT): the Roy H. Park Preserve (RPP) and the
   Dorothy McIlroy Bird Sanctuary (DMS). Over 200 nests were provisioned by
   21 species, including 12 species of wasps and 5 species of bees at RPP
   and 14 wasps and 2 bees at DMS. Twelve species nested at both sites, but
   the most common at RPP (Trypoxylon frigidum Smith, Osmia pumila Cresson,
   and Megachile relativa Cresson) were not among those most common at DMS
   (Trypoxylon lactitarse (Saussure), Ancistrocerus antilope (Panzer),
   Passaloecus cuspidatus Smith, and D. sayi sayi Banks). The greater
   species richness of bees at RPP was also reflected in a greater ratio of
   bee- to wasp-provisioned nests. One or more natural enemies also emerged
   from similar to 20\% of nests, five species of brood parasites, three
   parasitoids, and two that we assumed are incidental cleptoparasites. The
   most common species of natural enemies was Caenochrysis doriae
   (Gribodo), which emerged from over half of T frigidum nests and nearly
   one-quarter of its nest cells. Bees tended to produce more offspring per
   nest, partly because of higher levels of parasitism on wasps. We compare
   the results to that of an earlier survey we conducted at the Montezuma
   Wetlands Complex located northwest of the FLLT sites.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F., is used extensively
   to pollinate alfalfa for seed production in western North America.
   However, it usually is not possible to sustain bee populations in the
   United States. In the managed pollination system, variable
   microenvironments are experienced by developing M. rotundata during the
   nesting season that may influence bee reproductive success. In this
   study, bee cells were produced in a small alfalfa field and collected
   from domiciles according to nesting boards and different portions of
   boards. Examination of cells showed that the production of live
   overwintering prepupae, diseased larvae, other dead eggs and larvae, and
   cells attacked by natural enemies varied according to board orientations
   and positions, and portions of the boards. Northeast-facing board
   samples were significantly heavier and had more pollen balls and
   chalkbrood compared with southwest-facing boards. Lower boards in stacks
   had significantly more chalkbrood than upper boards. Outer portions of
   boards had significantly more live prepupae and less chalkbrood than
   middle and inner portions, and outer and middle portions had less
   summer-emerging bees. These results suggest that reproductive success
   could be altered by changing the orientation of boards within domiciles
   or changing the designs of domiciles. To accurately assess the quality
   of bee populations managed in the commercial loose cell system, a sample
   of bees should be taken from a pooled sample from all boards in each
   domicile. Each domicile sample should then be evaluated according to its
   proportional contribution to the whole field's progeny production (e.g.,
   by weight or volume).}},

Abstract = {{As bumble bees may routinely forage on pesticide-treated plants, it is
   imperative to apply pesticides that pose minimal risk. Identifying such
   reduced-risk pesticides requires toxicity tests using biologically
   relevant and standardized exposure methods. Our goal was to develop a
   functional and reliable queen-less micro-colony method for determining
   the sublethal effects of pesticides on Bombus impatiens Cresson, a
   species for which further toxicity assessments are needed. Originally
   developed using Bombus terrestris (L.), this method involves isolating
   three workers and allowing them to establish and maintain a colony. The
   workers and brood can then be exposed to pesticides and various effects
   measured simultaneously. Our preliminary work indicated that B.
   impatiens workers were unable to reproduce under the micro-colony
   conditions developed for B. terrestris. In the current study, we focused
   on the potential role of group size in B. impatiens worker reproduction
   by placing groups of three or five sister workers together and assessing
   their ability to establish a colony and rear males to adulthood. While
   both groups oviposited and produced males, significantly more males
   emerged from micro-colonies of five workers. We conclude that group size
   affects B. impatiens worker reproduction, and this effect in bumble bees
   varies interspecifically. In the context of toxicity testing, we
   recommend the use of at least five B. impatiens workers in
   micro-colonies to ensure a level of reproduction that allows the
   detection of potential sublethal changes to reproduction or development.}},

Abstract = {{Low, medium, and high stocking densities (15,000; 30,000; and
   45,000-50,000 bees per acre, respectively) of Megachile rotundata (F.)
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), the alfalfa leafcutting bee, were released
   over 4 yr in three research plots of Utah alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.
   (Fabaceae), planted at seed-production rates. A low percentage of bees
   (46-79\% of released) survived the incubation and field-emergence
   processes; of those bees, the number of females that established at the
   nesting sites was 25-100\%. Of the three field sites, one site
   consistently retained more females and produced more completed nests
   than the other sites, all of which usually had poor female establishment
   and progeny production. In addition, floral resources were depleted over
   time, but many flowers remained unvisited over the season. Nest
   production decreased over time, as numbers of flowers and female bees
   declined. Significant positive relationships were found between the
   intended stocking densities and 1) the number of females that actually
   survived incubation and field emergence and 2) the number of females
   that established nests. The number of females that established nests was
   positively affected by the number of females that survived to emerge in
   the field. The percentage of females that established was not
   significantly affected by the intended number of released bees,
   countering a prediction that the release of fewer bees would allow more
   females to establish nests and achieve high reproductive success. For
   growers, it may be more frugal to use modest numbers of M. rotundata for
   pollination, because many of the bees at medium and high stocking
   densities do not nest in grower-provided bee boards.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional evolutionary interpretation of Von Baer's laws of
   embryology is that retention of early developmental forms into adulthood
   (paedomorphosis) leads to the evolution of simpler or more generalized
   morphology and ecology. Here we show that paedomorphosis can also be
   involved in an increase in ecological specialization, in this case of
   plantpollinator relationships. A paedomorphic transition from
   generalized pollination (by several functional types of pollinators) to
   specialized pollination (by one or a few species in one functional type)
   occurred in a clade of endemic Madagascar vines (Dalechampia spp.,
   Euphorbiaceae). This evolutionary transition involved staminate flowers
   that fail to develop normally, instead holding mature pollen inside
   virtually unopened, bud-like flowers. This paedomorphic morphology
   restricts reward access to buzz-pollinating bees, including Xylocopa
   species (carpenter bees), which can remove pollen by sonication. This is
   one of very few reports of paedomorphic specialization, and, as far as
   we are aware, the first documented case of a rapid reversal to
   specialized pollination in a lineage of plants that had previously
   switched from specialized to generalized pollination in conjunction with
   dispersing to a new region.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic interactions do not occur in isolation but are imbedded in a
   network of species interactions. Network analysis facilitates the
   compilation and understanding of the complexity found in natural
   ecosystems and is a powerful tool to reveal information on the degree of
   specialization of the interacting partners and their niches. The indices
   measuring these properties are based on qualitative or quantitative
   observations of interactions between partners from different trophic
   levels, which informs about the structure of network patterns, but not
   about the underlying mechanisms. Functional traits may control the
   interaction strength between partners and also the (micro-) structure of
   networks. Here, we ask whether flower visitors specialize on certain
   plant traits and how this trait specialization contributes to niche
   partitioning and interaction partner diversity. We introduce two novel
   statistical approaches suited to evaluate the dimension of the realized
   niche and to analyse which traits determine niches. As basis for our
   analysis, we measured 10 quantitative flower traits and evaluated
   whether 31 arthropod taxa i visited flowers displaying only subsets of
   the available trait characteristics, indicating a specialization on
   these traits by narrow trait-widths Si. The product of 10 trait- and
   species-specific trait-widths Si was defined as trait-volume Vi
   (expansion of a n-dimensional hypervolume) occupied by each taxon i.
   These indices are applicable beyond flowervisitor interactions to
   quantify realized niches based on various biotic and abiotic factors.
   Each flower visitor species showed some degree of specialization to a
   unique set of flower traits (realized niche). Overall, our data
   suggested a hierarchical sequence of flower traits influencing the
   flower visitors' behaviour and thus network structure: flowering
   phenology was found to have the strongest effect, followed by flower
   height, nectar-tube depth and floral reflectance. Less important were
   pollen-mass/flower, sugar/flower, anther position, phylogeny, display
   size and abundance. The species-specific specialization on traits
   suggests that plant communities with more diverse floral niches may
   sustain a larger number of flower visitors with non-redundant
   fundamental niches. Our study and statistical approach provide a basis
   for a better understanding of how plant traits shape interactions
   between flowers and their visitors and thus network structure.}},

Title = {{Evidence of deterministic assembly according to flowering time in an
   old-field plant community}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{555-564}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Theory has produced contrasting predictions related to flowering time
   overlap among coexisting plant species largely because of the diversity
   of potential influences on flowering time. In this study, we use a
   trait-based null modelling approach to test for evidence of
   deterministic assembly of species according to flowering time in an
   old-field plant community. Plant species coexisting in one-metre-square
   plots overlapped in flowering time significantly more than expected.
   This flowering synchrony was more pronounced when analyses focused on
   bee-pollinated species. Flowering synchrony was also observed for
   wind-pollinated species, although for only one of our two null model
   tests, highlighting the sensitivity of some results to different
   randomization methods. In general, these patterns suggest that
   relationships between pollinators and plants can influence community
   assembly processes. Because our study community is composed of
   approximately 43\% native plant species and 57\% exotic species, and
   because the arrival of new species may complicate plantpollinator
   interactions, we tested whether flowering time overlap was altered by
   introduced species. Flowering synchrony was greater in plots with a
   higher proportion of introduced species. This pattern held for both null
   model tests, but was slightly stronger when analyses focused on
   bee-pollinated species. These results indicate that introduced species
   alter community flowering distributions and in so doing will inevitably
   affect pollinatorplant interactions. Finally, we tested whether our
   results were influenced by variation among study plots in above-ground
   biomass production, which some theory predicts will be related to the
   importance of competition. Our results were not influenced by this
   variation, suggesting that resource variation among our plots did not
   contribute to observed patterns. Synthesis: Our results provide support
   for predictions that coexisting species should display flowering
   synchrony, and provide no support for species coexistence via temporal
   niche partitioning at this scale in this study community. Our results
   also indicate that introduced species significantly alter the community
   assembly process such that flowering synchrony is more pronounced in
   plots with a greater proportion of introduced plant species.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators vary in their relative contribution to the conspecific
   pollen deposited onto receptive stigmas, because of variation in both
   visitation rate and effectiveness of pollen transfer. Syrphid flies and
   short-tongued solitary bees are common flower visitors in alpine New
   Zealand, yet their relative importance as pollinators is unknown. We
   measured pollinator performance of the New Zealand alpine endemics
   Hylaeus matamoko (Hymenoptera: Colletidae) and Allograpta spp. (Diptera:
   Syrphidae) on two New Zealand alpine herbs, Ourisia glandulosa
   (Plantaginaceae) and Wahlenbergia albomarginata (Campanulaceae). Ourisia
   glandulosa received visits by solitary bees and syrphid flies at equal
   frequencies, whereas W.albomarginata was mostly visited by H.matamoko.
   Based on single-visit pollen deposition to virgin stigmas, H.matamoko
   was a much more effective pollinator than Allograpta spp., delivering 10
   times as much pollen per visit to O.glandulosa stigmas and 3 times as
   much to W.albomarginata stigmas. By multiplying visitation frequency by
   single-visit pollen deposition, we estimated that H.matamoko performed
   90\% and 95\% of the pollination of O.glandulosa and W.albomarginata,
   respectively. Although H.matamoko bees are short-tongued and small in
   size, they are critically important to plant reproductive success in the
   New Zealand alpine. These bees contributed most of the pollination, even
   to a species that received just as many visits by flies, underscoring
   the need to consider per-visit effectiveness as well as visitation rate
   in assessing the importance of different pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Global declines in pollinating insects have been linked with
   agricultural intensification and land-use change. Increased production
   of novel crops for bioenergy is causing changes in agricultural
   practice, but the effects on different pollinating taxa have not yet
   been quantified. However, the major pollinating groups (social bees,
   solitary bees, hoverflies and butterflies) are likely to respond
   differently to changes in land use and shifts in crop cultivation
   patterns. We assessed the impacts of two bioenergy crops, oilseed rape
   Brassica napus L. and Miscanthus Miscanthus X giganteus on (i) the
   diversity and abundance of four taxonomic groups of pollinating insects,
   (ii) insect community composition, (iii) floral resources and (iv)
   nesting sites for bumblebees, by comparing bioenergy crops with
   conventional arable and grass crops in a large network of commercial
   fields. We found that although there were more bumblebees in oilseed
   rape fields, conventional crops and bioenergy crops did not differ
   greatly in species richness of most pollinator groups, although more
   floral resources were found in the bioenergy crops. However, solitary
   bees were more abundant and species rich in energy crops than
   conventional wheat, and more trap-nesting bees and wasps were found in
   Miscanthus than oilseed rape. In addition, novel assemblages of solitary
   bees were found in the bioenergy crops. All pollinator groups, and
   flowering plants, were more abundant in field margins than in the centre
   of crop fields. Although there were no differences among crop types,
   nest-searching bumblebees were confined to field margins. This
   highlights the importance of field margins as forage and nesting habitat
   for pollinators in farmland. Synthesis and applications. Differential
   responses to field-scale growth of bioenergy crops were displayed by the
   taxonomic groups studied, suggesting that effects on biodiversity cannot
   be generalized from studies based on a small suite of taxonomic groups
   and must include a range of taxa for overarching results. To optimize
   habitat for pollinators in agricultural areas, our data suggest that a
   diversity of crop types at small scales may have positive impacts and
   supports appropriate management and conservation of field margins and
   hedgerows during conversion to bioenergy production.}},

Abstract = {{Non-rewarding plants use a variety of ruses to attract their
   pollinators. One of the least understood of these is generalized food
   deception, in which flowers exploit non-specific food-seeking responses
   in their pollinators. Available evidence suggests that colour signals,
   scent and phenology may all play key roles in this form of deception.
   Here we investigate the pollination systems of five Eulophia spp.
   (Orchidaceae) lacking floral rewards. These species are pollinated by
   bees, notably Xylocopa (Anthophorinae, Apidae) or Megachile
   (Megachilidae) for the large-flowered species and anthophorid
   (Anthophorinae, Apidae) or halictid (Halictidae) bees for the
   small-flowered species. Spectra of the lateral petals and
   ultraviolet-absorbing patches on the labella are strongly contrasting in
   a bee visual system, which may falsely signal the presence of pollen to
   bees. All five species possess pollinarium-bending mechanisms that are
   likely to limit pollinator-mediated self-pollination. Flowering times
   extend over 34 months and the onset of flowering was not associated with
   the emergence of pollinators, some of which fly year round. Despite
   sharing pollinators with other plants and lacking rewards that would
   encourage fidelity, the Eulophia spp. exhibited relatively high levels
   of pollen transfer efficiency compared with other rewarding and
   deceptive orchids. We conclude that the study species employ generalized
   food deception and exploit food-seeking bees.(c) 2013 The Linnean

Volume = {{171}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Calanthe striata has nectarless flowers that are self-compatible, but
   pollinator dependent. Field observations showed that the flowers were
   pollinated exclusively by the carpenter bee Xylocopa appendiculata
   circumvolans, although the bees occasionally wasted pollen by delivering
   to the stigmatic surface pollinaria that retained their anther caps.
   Fruit set ratios at the population level varied spatiotemporally, but
   were generally low (8.317.3\%). Calanthe striata blooms in spring when
   post-overwintering carpenter bees have not yet started foraging for
   brood production. It can therefore exploit an abundance of
   opportunistic/naive foragers. This timing may also increase the
   possibility of pollinator visits, because no rewarding co-flowering
   plants are available in the orchid habitats. A literature review of
   Orchidaceae pollinated by carpenter bees revealed that at least 14
   species of Orchidoideae and Epidendroideae have evolved flowers
   specialized for carpenter bee pollination. They typically have shallow
   pink/magenta flowers with a foothold for pollinators; pollinaria are
   attached to the head, ventral thorax or base of the middle legs of
   carpenter bees when they insert their heads and/or proboscises into
   flowers; pollination success is generally low, a probable consequence of
   the deceptive pollination systems.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of

Abstract = {{Permanent grasslands are an important habitat for insect communities,
   including pollinator populations which are in pan-European decline.
   Here, we investigated the benefits of temporarily excluding sheep from
   pastures on butterfly (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae) and
   bumblebee (Hymenoptera: Bombidae) communities in two semi-natural
   grasslands differing in soil fertility and surrounding landscapes. We
   compared the impact of continuous grazing against rotational grazing
   (RG) at the same stocking rate but in which a subplot was excluded from
   the rotation during the main flowering period. We predicted that the
   diversity of flower-visiting insect community would be improved by RG
   due to the preservation of flower-rich patches and the maintenance of
   sward heterogeneity. Benefits of RG management were mainly evidenced on
   bumblebee density and species richness, with some additional effects on
   local density of butterflies during the subplot-exclusion period.
   Temporarily excluding sheep from pastures during peak flowering could
   thus offer an opportunity to preserve the diversity of flower-visiting
   insects, in spite of weaker benefits than could have been expected from
   previous surveys with cattle.}},

Volume = {{299}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Sexual and asexual reproduction may occur simultaneously in some plant
   species. Under certain environmental conditions asexual reproduction is
   predominant, which generates ecological consequences on sexual
   fecundity. In this context, we studied the reproductive ecology of the
   creeping clonal cactus Echinopsis thelegona in La Bodega (Salta,
   Argentina), where low fruit and seed production was preliminarily
   observed. Specifically, we studied the flower availability, fruit and
   seed production, reproductive system, floral visitors and effects of
   neighbor ramets on reproductive success. The number of available flowers
   per day was low, and fruit production was low or null as well.
   Echinopsis thelegona is self-incompatible. Although its flowers have
   sphingophilous traits, we did not find evidence of moths visiting them.
   Only native and exotic bees visited the flowers of this species, though
   with a low number of visits. Therefore, nocturnal visitors were not
   registered as pollinators of E. thelegona, perhaps because of their low
   local abundances. On the other hand, bees behaved as inefficient
   pollinators of E. thelegona due to their foraging behavior, which moves
   pollen within individuals. A pollen-addition experiment revealed that
   there is no fruit production at short distances among ramets. Therefore,
   the combination of self-incompatibility, low flower production and low
   local abundance of pollinators could account for the low fruit
   production observed in this species. This finding suggests that
   populations of E. thelegona persist by clonality and that they tend
   toward the loss of sexuality.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation of plant flower and life-history characters has often
   been studied in the context of specialized pollinators that vary in
   frequency or behavior among sites. Recently, the potential importance of
   herbivores and the interactions of pollinators and herbivores have also
   been recognized. We studied pollinators, herbivores, and plant
   phenotypes in four populations of the western wallflower (Erysimum
   capitatum, Brassicaceae) along an elevational gradient in the Front
   Range of the Eastern Slope of the Colorado Rocky Mountains in 2005 and
   2006. Several phenotypic characters varied among populations over a
   small spatial scale (<50km), and plants were visited by a wide variety
   of pollinators and herbivores. E. capitatum plants in these populations
   were primarily pollinated by bees, pollen beetles, and flies. The most
   common types of pollinating visitors differed among populations. Ants
   were the most common visitors in all populations. They removed nectar
   from the base of flowers, occasionally attacked bees, and rarely came
   into contact with stigmas. Many other herbivores fed on flowers and buds
   of E. capitatum. Some of these damaged petals, potentially making plants
   less attractive to pollinators. Gall midge larvae (Cecidomyiidae) formed
   galls from flower buds and typically prevented flowers from opening.
   Both herbivores and pollinators were different from year to year and
   from population to population. We argue that the potential for local
   adaptation to pollinators and herbivores exists in Erysimum capitatum.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the floral biology, floral visitors, levels of florivory, and
   mating system of Opuntia macrocentra in a population of ca. 300
   individuals in order to describe what factors affect flower/fruit
   ratios. Blooming for the species occurred once a year during spring.
   Flowers were hermaphroditic, produced nectar, and remained open 6 to 9 h
   during a single day. Anther dehiscence starts at flower aperture and
   stigma receptivity starts approximately 1 h later. The most important
   floral visitors were solitary bees from the Anthophoridae family (genus
   Diadasia). Open-pollinated control and cross pollination treatments had
   the highest fruit set (96.8 +/- 3.2\% and 83.9 +/- 6.7\%, respectively),
   but fruit set for forced self-pollination treatment (77.4 +/- 7.6\%) did
   not differ from the cross-pollination treatment. Seed production was
   also highest in the open-pollinated treatment; the average number of
   seeds per fruit in the open-pollinated treatment was 40\% higher than
   the cross-pollinated treatment and 64\% higher than the self-pollinated
   treatment. The flowers were self-compatible and did not require a
   visitor to set fruit. Flower/fruit ratio was slightly above one over all
   pollination treatments (fruit ratios between 1.0-1.3), suggesting that
   almost all flowers turned into fruits. Outcrossing rates suggest a mixed
   mating system, but inbreeding depression was found for both fruit and
   seed set. Developing fruits were consumed by the caterpillar
   (Lepidoptera: Olycella subumbrella) and decreased fruit set from 20\% to
   100\%. Florivory and inbreeding depression were the major factors that
   decrease fruit set for this species.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbances have caused pollinator decline by affecting
   the abundance and diversity of foraging plants. Anthropogenic
   disturbances are also thought to drive pollinator decline by reducing
   nest site availability, but the exact mechanisms by which human
   activities influence nest site availability are not currently well
   understood. In this study, we investigated nesting site preference of
   underground bee Andrena camellia Wu in two orchards. Principal component
   analysis of environmental factors (bulk density, penetration resistance,
   water content and temperature) indicated that A.camellia preferred
   loose, moist and low-temperature habitats. The favored habitats were
   located at the bases of the foothills a long distance from human
   settlements. At the bases, favored nesting substrates decreased along
   the distance gradient, and nest densities of digger bees increased along
   the distance gradient. On the summit, however, nesting substrates were
   compacted, dried with high temperature regardless of distance from human
   settlements, and the nest densities were all low along the distance
   gradient. In summary, anthropogenic soil disturbances in the vicinity of
   human settlements threaten digger bees by altering soil characteristics.
   The conservation of the soil substrates is addressed in terms of its
   role in governing the population of digger bee A.camellia.}},

Abstract = {{Colour signals are a major cue in putative pollination syndromes. There
   is evidence that the reflectance spectra of many flowers target the
   distinctive visual discrimination abilities of hymenopteran insects, but
   far less is known about bird-pollinated flowers. Birds are hypothesized
   to exert different selective pressures on floral colour compared with
   hymenopterans because of differences in their visual systems. We
   measured the floral reflectance spectra of 206 Australian angiosperm
   species whose floral visitors are known from direct observation rather
   than inferred from floral characteristics. We quantified the match
   between these spectra and the hue discrimination abilities of
   hymenopteran and avian vision, and analysed these metrics in a
   phylogenetically informed comparison of flowers in different pollination
   groups. We show that bird-visited flowers and insect-visited flowers
   differ significantly from each other in the chromatic cues they provide,
   and that the differences are concentrated near wavelengths of optimal
   colour discrimination by whichever class of pollinator visits the
   flowers. Our results indicate that angiosperms have evolved the spectral
   signals most likely to reinforce their pollinators' floral constancy
   (the tendency of individual pollinators to visit flowers of the same
   species) in communities of similarly coloured floral competitors.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar robbing may have an indirect negative effect on plant
   reproduction by discouraging legitimate pollinator species from visiting
   robbed flowers. In this study, we set up a 2 x 2 factorial design with
   nectar-robbing ants and hummingbird pollination to test for non-additive
   effects on fruit set, seed mass, and seed germination of the leafless
   mistletoe Tristerix aphyllus (Loranthaceae). Even though ants caused
   conspicuous damage at the base of the floral tubes, nectar availability
   was reduced by only 8 \% in the presence of ants. The green-backed
   firecrown Sephanoides sephaniodes was insensitive to the presence of
   ants. Rather, the bird responded to flower number and the presence or
   the absence of damage, but not to the extent of damage within
   inflorescences. As hummingbirds were largely insensitive to variation in
   nectar robbing, the interaction ant x hummingbird had no effect on
   plant-reproductive success. Thus, the factorial experiment did not
   provide evidence for indirect negative effects of nectar robbing on
   plant reproduction. These results suggest that indirect effects of
   nectar robbers on pollinator behaviour may occur under a more restricted
   set of conditions than those previously considered. We suggest that the
   low amount of nectar removed by nectar-robbing ants was insufficient for
   hummingbirds to avoid robbed flowers, which restricted the potential for
   non-additive effects.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity and abundance of wild insect pollinators have declined in
   many agricultural landscapes. Whether such declines reduce crop yields,
   or are mitigated by managed pollinators such as honey bees, is unclear.
   We found universally positive associations of fruit set with flower
   visitation by wild insects in 41 crop systems worldwide. In contrast,
   fruit set increased significantly with flower visitation by honey bees
   in only 14\% of the systems surveyed. Overall, wild insects pollinated
   crops more effectively; an increase in wild insect visitation enhanced
   fruit set by twice as much as an equivalent increase in honey bee
   visitation. Visitation by wild insects and honey bees promoted fruit set
   independently, so pollination by managed honey bees supplemented, rather
   than substituted for, pollination by wild insects. Our results suggest
   that new practices for integrated management of both honey bees and
   diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields.}},

Abstract = {{Using historic data sets, we quantified the degree to which global
   change over 120 years disrupted plant-pollinator interactions in a
   temperate forest understory community in Illinois, USA. We found
   degradation of interaction network structure and function and
   extirpation of 50\% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to
   shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches,
   nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences
   between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of
   pollination services have declined through time. The historic network
   showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest
   that networks will be less resilient to future changes.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators such as bees are essential to the functioning of terrestrial
   ecosystems. However, despite concerns about a global pollinator crisis,
   long-term data on the status of bee species are limited. We present a
   long-term study of relative rates of change for an entire regional bee
   fauna in the northeastern United States, based on >30,000 museum records
   representing 438 species. Over a 140-y period, aggregate native species
   richness weakly decreased, but richness declines were significant only
   for the genus Bombus. Of 187 native species analyzed individually, only
   three declined steeply, all of these in the genus Bombus. However, there
   were large shifts in community composition, as indicated by 56\% of
   species showing significant changes in relative abundance over time.
   Traits associated with a declining relative abundance include small
   dietary and phenological breadth and large body size. In addition,
   species with lower latitudinal range boundaries are increasing in
   relative abundance, a finding that may represent a response to climate
   change. We show that despite marked increases in human population
   density and large changes in anthropogenic land use, aggregate native
   species richness declines were modest outside of the genus Bombus. At
   the same time, we find that certain ecological traits are associated
   with declines in relative abundance. These results should help target
   conservation efforts focused on maintaining native bee abundance and
   diversity and therefore the important ecosystems services that they
   provide.}},

Title = {{Among-Population Variation in Microbial Community Structure in the
   Floral Nectar of the Bee-Pollinated Forest Herb Pulmonaria officinalis L}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{MAR 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbial communities in floral nectar have been shown to be
   characterized by low levels of species diversity, yet little is known
   about among-plant population variation in microbial community
   composition.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the microbial community
   structure (yeasts and bacteria) in floral nectar of ten fragmented
   populations of the bee-pollinated forest herb Pulmonaria officinalis. We
   also explored possible relationships between plant population size and
   microbial diversity in nectar, and related microbial community
   composition to the distance separating plant populations. Culturable
   bacteria and yeasts occurring in the floral nectar of a total of 100
   plant individuals were isolated and identified by partially sequencing
   the 16S rRNA gene and D1/D2 domains of the 26S rRNA gene, respectively.
   A total of 9 and 11 yeast and 28 and 39 bacterial OTUs was found, taking
   into account a 3\% (OTU0.03) and 1\% sequence dissimilarity cut-off
   (OTU0.01). OTU richness at the plant population level (i.e. the number
   of OTUs per population) was low for yeasts (mean: 1.7, range: 0-4
   OTUs(0.01/0.03) per population), whereas on average 6.9 (range: 2-13)
   OTUs(0.03) and 7.9 (range 2-16) OTUs(0.01) per population were found for
   bacteria. Both for yeasts and bacteria, OTU richness was not
   significantly related to plant population size. Similarity in community
   composition among populations was low (average Jaccard index: 0.14), and
   did not decline with increasing distance between populations.
   Conclusions/Significance: We found low similarity in microbial community
   structure among populations, suggesting that the assembly of nectar
   microbiota is to a large extent context-dependent. Although the precise
   factors that affect variation in microbial community structure in floral
   nectar require further study, our results indicate that both local and
   regional processes may contribute to among-population variation in
   microbial community structure in nectar.}},

Abstract = {{Plant defense compounds occur in floral nectar, but their ecological
   role is not well understood. We provide evidence that plant compounds
   pharmacologically alter pollinator behavior by enhancing their memory of
   reward. Honeybees rewarded with caffeine, which occurs naturally in
   nectar of Coffea and Citrus species, were three times as likely to
   remember a learned floral scent as were honeybees rewarded with sucrose
   alone. Caffeine potentiated responses of mushroom body neurons involved
   in olfactory learning and memory by acting as an adenosine receptor
   antagonist. Caffeine concentrations in nectar did not exceed the bees'
   bitter taste threshold, implying that pollinators impose selection for
   nectar that is pharmacologically active but not repellent. By using a
   drug to enhance memories of reward, plants secure pollinator fidelity
   and improve reproductive success.}},

Journal = {{PLANT REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-16}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Examining reproductive isolating barriers is essential for understanding
   processes of speciation. Sexual isolation has been shown to contribute
   to speciation in many sympatric taxa; however, its role in parapatric
   taxa with reduced interspecific gene flow is poorly understood. I
   investigated the extent of sexual isolation in two closely related
   Neotropical understory species, Costus allenii and C. villosissimus,
   that occur in adjacent habitats within flight distance of their shared
   pollinators, euglossine bees. Pollination arrays were used to test
   whether individual pollinators travel between species, to estimate the
   proportion of hetero- and conspecific pollen deposited on the stigmas,
   and to examine the proportion of hybrid progeny. In comparison to C.
   allenii, C. villosissimus produces flowers with larger labella, longer
   stamen-labellum distances, and longer styles. Pollinators visited both
   species but preferred C. villosissimus. This preference caused
   pollinator isolation in C. villosissimus. In C. allenii, the frequency
   of heterospecific pollinator transitions was not less common than that
   of conspecific transitions, but floral mechanical isolation greatly
   reduced the likelihood of heterospecific pollen deposition. The
   contribution of gametic isolation was not strong in either species.
   Based on data for pollinator isolation, floral mechanical isolation, and
   gametic isolation, it appears that sexual isolation is weak in C.
   allenii, restricting heterospecific gene flow by 25 \%, but moderate in
   C. villosissimus, where gene flow from C. allenii is reduced by 70 \%.
   Further research will estimate the magnitude of other isolation barriers
   to determine the relative contribution of sexual isolation to total
   isolation in this parapatric species pair.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the social interactions between host bumblebees and their
   inquiline species requires rearing them. Here we provide a simple method
   for rearing of cuckoo bumblebees (Bombus subgenus Psithyrus) in the
   laboratory. Two bumblebee cuckoo-host systems are used: Bombus
   (Psithyrus) vestalis hosted by B. (Bombus) terrestris and B. (Psithyrus)
   sylvestris hosted by B. (Pyrobombus) pratorum. First, the invasion of
   the Psithyrus female is performed in species-specific host colonies
   containing approximately 10 young workers. On average, a parasitized
   colony of B. terrestris produced 90 +/- 9 young males and 21 +/- 3 young
   females of B. vestalis, whereas a parasitized colony of B. pratorum
   produced 16 +/- 2 young males and 5 +/- 1 young females of B.
   sylvestris. One week after emergence, Psithyrus virgin females are
   placed in a flight cage exposed to natural light, with Psithyrus males
   of other colonies. After successful mating, the females are isolated and
   overwintered in a cold room at 4 degrees C for 2-4 months. This method
   enables a year-round and mass breeding of Psithyrus species to
   facilitate studies of these rare species.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{269-276}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, wild bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are experiencing marked
   declines, with potentially up to 11\% of species currently under threat.
   Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from
   commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked
   range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of
   pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is
   lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within
   the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping
   systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four
   pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific
   populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland.
   Commercial bumble bees collected from 31\% to 97\% of non-crop pollen,
   depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher
   frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi,
   compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The
   highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses
   and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and
   pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km. We suggest implementing measures
   that prevent the interaction of commercially reared and wild bumble bees
   by integrating the enforcement of national best management practices for
   users of commercial pollinators with international legislation that
   regulates the sanitation of commercial hives in production facilities.

Abstract = {{Floral biology and breeding system of Bauhinia forficata (Leguminosae:
   Caesalpinioideae), a moth-pollinated tree in southeastern Brazil.
   Bauhinia trees have a wide variety of pollination and breeding systems
   that are affected by geographic distribution. Bauhinia species with
   nocturnal anthesis are usually chiropterophilous and/or sphingophilous.
   B. forficata Link has floral features that are typical of the
   sphingophilous condition and this report describes the floral biology,
   pollination, and breeding system of a population of this species in a
   small fragment of semideciduous forest in southeastern Brazil. Flowers
   lasted 18 h, anthesis started at dusk, and pollen release and nectar
   production occurred at 8:00 and 10:00 pm, respectively. Flowers were
   protandrous and the stigma became receptive around 11:00 pm with the
   bisexual phase ending at 12:00 am. Nectar was produced continuously; the
   mean total nectar volume/flower was 15.11 mu L and the mean total nectar
   concentration was 25.9 \%. B. forficata is a strictly sphingophilous
   species that is pollinated exclusively by Manduca sexta L., the body
   morphology and behavior of which favor pollen transfer. Visitation by
   the bees Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier and Xylocopa brasilianorum L.
   (Apidae) occurred in the morning, but these species were considered
   occasional and not legitimate pollinators. Despite the geographic
   distance separating the Brazilian B. forficata from the Venezuelan B.
   aculeata, both species show very convergent pollination systems but
   differs in their faunal composition. B. forficata is homomorphic and
   predominantly self-incompatible; cross-pollination produces twice as
   much fruit as natural open pollinations, indicating a pollen limitation
   and relative inefficiency of the pollinator, the latter effect may
   reflect habitat disturbance that favors geitonogamous pollination and
   decreases the efficiency of pollination. More studies are necessary to
   investigate the relationship between habitat disturbance and geographic
   distribution on the pollination and breeding systems of Bauhinia
   species.}},

Title = {{Biological Flora of the British Isles: Silene suecica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{532-544}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Silene suecica (Lodd.) Greuter \& Burdet (Lychnis alpina L.) that are
   relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour.
   The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the
   Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat,
   communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment,
   structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters,
   herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Silene suecica is native to the British flora, being found in just
   two confirmed localities (one in north-west England and the other in
   Scotland) on open fell-field and rocky outcrop habitats. It occurs on
   acid to neutral soil in Britain and elsewhere its circum-arctic range.
   It often indicates elevated concentrations of copper or other heavy
   metals, whose presence in the soil restricts the growth of other
   species; therefore, S. suecica is perceived as a stress-tolerant,
   competition-avoiding species. Nonetheless, it also grows in more or less
   closed alpine grassland in Europe; in North America and Greenland, it is
   known from tundra, rocky barrens, gulleys and river outwashes, grassy
   slopes and sea cliffs.
   3. Silene suecica is a (semi-)rosette plant with a strong taproot, with
   no capacity for vegetative spread. The main perennating organ is the
   slightly lignified rootstock/taproot. The rosette has winter-green
   leaves; after flowering the rosette leaves die, but new lateral rosettes
   may be produced in the following year. The longevity of the species is
   between 3 and 10 years, with the time of first flowering depending on
   rosette size. Plants that have flowered may die (semelparous
   individuals), but some are iteroparous and flower again on lateral
   shoots.
   4. Silene suecica produces protandrous hermaphrodite flowers, but
   self-pollination may occur. In Scotland about 10\% of all plants flower
   in any year. Pollination is by a range of insects, including flies and
   bees. Capsules produce up to 80 seeds (mean = 30).
   5. Silene suecica has probably not declined in the British Isles and, in
   fact, a slight population expansion in permanent plots was observed in
   Scotland in the early 1990s. Nonetheless, it remains classed as
   vulnerable to extinction because of its restricted distribution. Both of
   its British locations are protected as SSSI and SAC (Natura 2000) within
   national parks. It is common in many countries within its distribution
   range.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Diversification of floral traits in angiosperms is
   often attributed to have been driven by adaptations to pollinators.
   Nevertheless, phylogenetic studies on the relationships among
   evolutionary changes in floral traits and pollination systems are still
   limited. We examined the relationships between floral trait changes and
   pollinator shifts in Bornean gingers (Zingiberaceae). These plants have
   strongly zygomorphic flowers pollinated by spiderhunter birds, bees of
   the genus Amegilla, and halictid bees.
   Methods: We identified pollination systems through field observations
   and recorded petal color, quantity of floral rewards, and seven measures
   of flower morphology in 28 ginger species. Phylogenetic trees were
   constructed from nucleotide sequences of the matK and ITS regions. We
   examined the correlations between the evolution of pollination systems
   and floral traits using phylogenetically independent contrasts.
   Key Results: Significant association was found between pink color and
   spiderhunter pollination, orange and Amegilla pollination, and yellow
   and white and halictid pollination. Sugar production was higher in
   spiderhunter-pollinated species and lower in halictid-pollinated.
   Meanwhile, there was a significant association only for a subset of the
   floral morphological characters measured. Floral tube length, which is
   often thought to evolve to match the lengths of pollinator probing
   apparatuses, did not show any correlation.
   Conclusions: There is considerable variation in the strength of
   association among pollination systems and floral traits. Lack of
   significant correlation in some traits could partly be explained by
   floral functions other than pollination, such as adaptations to prevent
   herbivore damage to the ovules. Further studies on these factors may
   improve understanding of plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Nectar is the most common reward provided by
   animal-pollinated flowers. Diversity in position and structure of floral
   nectaries suggests that floral nectar production evolved repeatedly, but
   the evolutionary origins are not well known. Flowers of the genus
   Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) are apetalous and lack floral nectar.
   Nevertheless, many Macaranga species possess disk-shaped nectaries on
   their leaves, sought by ants that defend plants from herbivory. In some
   Macaranga species, similar glands also occur on the bracteoles-modified
   leaves subtending the flowers. We investigated whether these glands on
   the bracteoles of M. sinensis are involved in pollination.
   Methods: Flower visitors were captured, and body pollen was examined.
   The behavior of flower visitors on inflorescences was also observed.
   Sugar composition of the nectar from bracteoles and leaves was collected
   and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Key results: Various bees and flies with body pollen visited both male
   and female inflorescences, feeding on nectar from the bracteoles and
   touching anthers and stigmas in the process. Sugar composition of nectar
   from the bracteoles and the leaves did not differ.
   Conclusions: Macaranga sinensis was pollinated by insects foraging on
   the disk-shaped nectaries on bracteoles. The similar appearance,
   position, and sugar composition of nectar suggest that disk-shaped
   nectaries on bracteoles and leaves are homologous and that nectaries on
   leaves were recruited to inflorescences to serve floral function in M.
   sinensis. Having protective mutualism with ants has likely opened an
   unusual route for the evolution of floral nectar in otherwise
   non-nectar-producing flowers of M. sinensis.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to test the feasibility and effectiveness of

   varieties and monitored over the blooming season. Results were compared
   to other 22 orchards without bee introduction and showed an increment of

   yield was significantly higher in the orchards where bees were
   introduced, independently of variety. The increase in productivity was
   1,798 kg/ha. It was concluded that the introduction of inhabited nests

Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pattern of
   pollinator visits to vertical inflorescences. These range from a
   response to a pattern of resources to merely instinctive behaviour. In
   dichogamous plants, such behaviour has been associated with promoting
   outcrossing and avoiding geitonogamy. We here analyse behaviour of the
   principal pollinator groups in five protogynous species of Scrophularia
   with different flower sizes (S.sambucifolia, S.grandiflora, S.lyrata,
   S.scorodonia and S.canina), and the distribution of sexual phases along
   the inflorescences. The results in all cases show that pollinators
   follow a pattern of ascending visits accompanied by movements between
   flowers of the same whorl (horizontal movements). The relative frequency
   of these horizontal movements depends on the flower size, with a higher
   frequency in species with large flowers. In vertical movements of the
   three more common pollinator groups to several plant species
   (bumblebees, wasps and small bees), the behaviour was essentially
   independent of flower size, with bumblebees having the highest ratio of
   ascents to descents. Behaviour of the pollinators, together with the
   absence of a definite pattern of distribution of the sexual phases along

Abstract = {{Floral density often influences the species composition of flower
   visitors. This variation in visitor species composition could have
   significant effects on pollination success and plant fitness but is
   poorly understood, especially in the many pollination guilds dominated
   by nonterritorial species. This article presents a foraging model that
   explores how flower visitors with diverse traits should distribute
   themselves across resource patches differing in floral density. The
   model predicts that species with low flower search speeds and low flower
   handling costs compared to those of competitors will usually dominate
   dense flower patches. In addition, among flower visitors that have lower
   energy expenditure rates while handling flowers than while traveling,
   species maximizing energetic efficiency are typically associated with
   dense flower patches, whereas those maximizing net rate of energy intake
   are associated with sparse patches. The model is able to predict some
   key aspects of a previously observed effect of floral density on species
   composition of flower visitors to the yellowflower tarweed (Holocarpha
   virgata). By providing insights into how flower visitors' traits shape
   the effects of floral density on the species composition of flower
   visitors, this study makes an important step towards understanding how
   pollinator diversity influences relationships between plant density and
   plant fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The worldwide decline of pollinators is an emerging threat and is a
   matter both for ecological and economic concerns. Population genetics
   can be used to correlate bumblebee decline with genetic parameters. In
   order to do so, historical data are needed. We used eight microsatellite
   loci to genotype pinned museum specimens of the declining bumblebee
   Bombus veteranus. Bumblebee samples were collected spanning a period of
   three decades (1895-1923). We detected low genetic diversity and
   inbreeding in the samples collected during the respective time periods.
   Inbreeding was also confirmed by the occurrence of sterile diploid
   males. Based on the data obtained, we speculate that low genetic
   diversity and inbreeding did not directly result in the collapse of B.
   veteranus in Belgium. However, inbreeding might still play an indirect
   role in the decline of bumblebee populations because of the appearance
   of diploid males and because a low H (E) might reduce the capacity to
   react to the drivers of bumblebee decline.}},

Abstract = {{Euglossini bees are among the main pollinators of plant species in
   tropical and subtropical forests in Central and South America. These
   bees are known as long-distance pollinators due to their exceptional
   flight performance. Here we assessed through microsatellite loci the
   gene variation and genetic differentiation between populations of four
   abundant Euglossini species populations sampled in two areas, Picinguaba
   (mainland) and Anchieta Island, Ubatuba, So Paulo State, southeastern
   Brazil. There was no significant genetic differentiation between the
   island and mainland samples of Euglossa cordata (Fst = 0.008, P = 0.60),
   Eulaema cingulata (Fst = 0.029, P = 0.29) and Eulaema nigrita (Fst =
   0.062, P = 0.38), but a significant gene differentiation between
   mainland and island samples of Euglossa stellfeldi (Fst = 0.028, P =
   0.016) was detected. As expected, our results showed that the water body
   that separates the island from the mainland does not constitute a
   geographic barrier for these Euglossini bees. The absence of
   populational structuring of three out the four species studied
   corroborates previous reports on those bees, characterized by large
   populations, with high gene diversity and gene flow and very low levels
   of diploid males. But the Eg. stellfeldi results clearly point that
   dispersal ability is not similar to all euglossine bees, what requires
   the development of different conservationist strategies to the
   Euglossini species.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the efficacy of sampling methods for monitoring

   landscapes in Uganda. Bees were sampled using line transect count,
   coloured pan trap and hand net methods. In total, 80,883 bee individuals
   were collected. Totals of 59, 314 and 559 bee species were recorded in
   transect counts, pan traps and hand nets, respectively. Thus hand nets
   captured the most species overall. There were few species that
   overlapped across the three sampling methods. Wild bees were
   significantly more abundant in yellow pan traps than in blue or white
   ones. In contrast, bee species richness was significantly higher in blue
   pan traps than in white or yellow pan traps. Overall, pan-trapping was
   found to be a complementary method to hand-netting for monitoring bee

Abstract = {{Genetic studies provide valuable data to inform conservation strategies
   for species with small or declining populations. In these circumstances,
   obtaining DNA samples without harming the study organisms is highly
   desirable. Excrements are increasingly being used as a source of DNA in
   such studies, but such approaches have rarely been applied to
   arthropods. Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important as
   pollinators; however, some species have recently suffered severe
   declines and range contractions across much of Western Europe and North
   America. We investigated whether bumblebee faeces could be used for the
   extraction of DNA suitable for genotyping using microsatellite markers.
   We found that DNA could be extracted using a Chelex method from faecal
   samples collected either in microcapillary tubes or on filter paper,
   directly from captured individuals. Our results show that genotypes
   scored from faecal samples are identical to those from tissue samples.
   This study describes a reliable, consistent and efficient noninvasive
   method of obtaining DNA from bumblebees for use in population genetic
   studies. This approach should prove particularly useful in breeding and
   conservation programs for bumblebees and may be broadly applicable
   across insect taxa.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{100}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of pigmentation overlying the petal vasculature are common in
   flowering plants and have been postulated to play a role in pollinator
   attraction. Previous studies report that such venation patterning is
   significantly more attractive to bee foragers in the field than ivory or
   white flowers without veins. To dissect the ways in which venation
   patterning of pigment can influence bumblebee behaviour, we investigated
   the response of flower-na < ve individuals of Bombus terrestris to
   veined, ivory and red near-isogenic lines of Antirrhinum majus. We find
   that red venation shifts flower colour slightly, although the ivory
   background is the dominant colour. Bees were readily able to
   discriminate between ivory and veined flowers under differential
   conditioning but showed no innate preference when presented with a free
   choice of rewarding ivory and veined flowers. In contrast, both ivory
   and veined flowers were selected significantly more often than were red
   flowers. We conclude that advantages conferred by venation patterning
   might stem from bees learning of their use as nectar guides, rather than
   from any innate preference for striped flowers.}},

   fluorescent dye transfers) and may differently attract pollinators, by
   comparing their floral colour as perceived by insects. Fluorescent dyes
   were mainly dispersed over short distances (80\% within 40.4m (max.
   94.5m) for V.oxycoccos and 3.0m (max. 141.3m) for V.uliginosum). Dye
   dispersal in V.oxycoccos was not significantly affected by plant area,
   floral display or the proximity to V.uliginosum plants. Interspecific
   dye transfers were observed, indicating pollinator sharing. The
   significantly lower dye deposition on V.oxycoccos stigmas suggests lower
   visitation rates by pollinators, despite higher flower density and local
   abundance. The spectral reflectance analysis indicates that bees are
   unlikely to be able to discriminate between the two species based on
   floral colour alone. Fruit production increased with increasing floral
   display, but was not affected by proximity to V.uliginosum plants. Our
   study highlights that fragmented populations of V.oxycoccos, when
   sympatric with co-flowering V.uliginosum, might incur increased
   competition for the shared pollinators in the case of pollination
   disruption, which might then reduce outcrossed seed set.}},

   by Bumblebees Across Spatial Scales and Flower Arrangements}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating bees develop foraging circuits (traplines) to visit multiple
   flowers in a manner that minimizes overall travel distance, a task
   analogous to the travelling salesman problem. We report on an in-depth
   exploration of an iterative improvement heuristic model of bumblebee
   traplining previously found to accurately replicate the establishment of
   stable routes by bees between flowers distributed over several hectares.
   The critical test for a model is its predictive power for empirical data
   for which the model has not been specifically developed, and here the
   model is shown to be consistent with observations from different
   research groups made at several spatial scales and using multiple
   configurations of flowers. We refine the model to account for the
   spatial search strategy of bees exploring their environment, and test
   several previously unexplored predictions. We find that the model
   predicts accurately 1) the increasing propensity of bees to optimize
   their foraging routes with increasing spatial scale; 2) that bees cannot
   establish stable optimal traplines for all spatial configurations of
   rewarding flowers; 3) the observed trade-off between travel distance and
   prioritization of high-reward sites (with a slight modification of the
   model); 4) the temporal pattern with which bees acquire approximate
   solutions to travelling salesman-like problems over several dozen
   foraging bouts; 5) the instability of visitation schedules in some
   spatial configurations of flowers; 6) the observation that in some
   flower arrays, bees' visitation schedules are highly individually
   different; 7) the searching behaviour that leads to efficient location
   of flowers and routes between them. Our model constitutes a robust
   theoretical platform to generate novel hypotheses and refine our
   understanding about how small-brained insects develop a representation
   of space and use it to navigate in complex and dynamic environments.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the influence of the landscape structure on solitary bee
   abundance and species richness in an agricultural area of western
   France. We focused on the role of semi-natural habitats, oilseed rape
   (OSR) and other crops. Our originality was to consider not only the
   spatial heterogeneity of the crop field mosaic but also its temporal
   heterogeneity through the crop rotations.
   Solitary bees were caught with colored pan traps in 15 margins of OSR
   fields and 35 margins of non-OSR fields. We found that solitary bee
   abundance and species richness were higher in margins of OSR fields than
   in margins of non-OSR fields, showing that early spring-flying species
   widely use this mass flowering crop. However the high number of rare
   species in margins of non-OSR fields (21 species recorded exclusively in
   these margins) highlighted the importance of these margins for the
   conservation of solitary bee diversity.
   The influence of the landscape context on solitary bees showed
   contrasted results according to the type of margin and the spatial
   scale. At the finest spatial scale, abundance in margins of OSR fields
   increased with increasing proportion of non-flowering crops (cereals and
   temporary grasslands) in the current year. At large spatial scales,
   solitary bee abundance in margins of non-OSR fields was positively
   affected by the proportion of long-term grasslands. Moreover, the
   proportion of fields only sown with cereals during the last 5 years
   negatively affected abundance and species richness at the large scales
   whereas the proportion of mixed fields (at least 1 year of grassland in
   the rotation) had a positive effect on species richness.
   We showed that accounting for the cumulative effects of field cover and
   management through the crop rotations is relevant for studying solitary
   bee communities. The introduction of less intensive covers, such as
   temporary grasslands, in cereal rotations positively influences these
   communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Succession Influences Wild Bees in a Temperate Forest Landscape: The
   Value of Early Successional Stages in Naturally Regenerated and Planted
   Forests}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In many temperate terrestrial forest ecosystems, both natural human
   disturbances drive the reestablishment of forests. Succession in plant
   communities, in addition to reforestation following the creation of open
   sites through harvesting or natural disturbances, can affect forest
   faunal assemblages. Wild bees perform an important ecosystem function in
   human-altered and natural or seminatural ecosystems, as they are
   essential pollinators for both crops and wild flowering plants. To
   maintain high abundance and species richness for pollination services,
   it is important to conserve and create seminatural and natural land
   cover with optimal successional stages for wild bees. We examined the
   effects of forest succession on wild bees. In particular, we evaluated
   the importance of early successional stages for bees, which has been
   suspected but not previously demonstrated. A range of successional
   stages, between 1 and 178 years old, were examined in naturally
   regenerated and planted forests. In total 4465 wild bee individuals,
   representing 113 species, were captured. Results for total bees,
   solitary bees, and cleptoparasitic bees in both naturally regenerated
   and planted conifer forests indicated a higher abundance and species
   richness in the early successional stages. However, higher abundance and
   species richness of social bees in naturally regenerated forest were
   observed as the successional stages progressed, whereas the abundance of
   social bees in conifer planted forest showed a concave-shaped
   relationship when plotted. The results suggest that early successional
   stages of both naturally regenerated and conifer planted forest maintain
   a high abundance and species richness of solitary bees and their
   cleptoparasitic bees, although social bees respond differently in the
   early successional stages. This may imply that, in some cases, active
   forest stand management policies, such as the clear-cutting of planted
   forests for timber production, would create early successional habitats,
   leading to significant positive effects for bees in general.}},

Title = {{Floral Nectar Guide Patterns Discourage Nectar Robbing by Bumble Bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Floral displays are under selection to both attract pollinators and
   deter antagonists. Here we show that a common floral trait, a nectar
   guide pattern, alters the behavior of bees that can act
   opportunistically as both pollinators and as antagonists. Generally,
   bees access nectar via the floral limb, transporting pollen through
   contact with the plant's reproductive structures; however bees sometimes
   extract nectar from a hole in the side of the flower that they or other
   floral visitors create. This behavior is called ``nectar robbing{''}
   because bees may acquire the nectar without transporting pollen. We
   asked whether the presence of a symmetric floral nectar guide pattern on
   artificial flowers affected bumble bees' (Bombus impatiens) propensity
   to rob or access nectar ``legitimately.{''} We discovered that nectar
   guides made legitimate visits more efficient for bees than robbing, and
   increased the relative frequency of legitimate visits, compared to
   flowers lacking nectar guides. This study is the first to show that
   beyond speeding nectar discovery, a nectar guide pattern can influence
   bees' flower handling in a way that could benefit the plant.}},

Abstract = {{Through their effects on physicochemical features of floral nectar,
   nectar-dwelling yeasts can alter pollinator behavior, but the effect of
   such changes on pollination success and plant reproduction is unknown.
   We present results of experiments testing the effects of nectar yeasts
   on foraging patterns of captive and free-ranging bumble bees, and also
   on pollination success and fecundity of the early-blooming, bumble
   bee-pollinated Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae). Under controlled
   experimental conditions, inexperienced Bombus terrestris workers
   responded positively to the presence of yeasts in artificial sugar
   solutions mimicking floral nectar by visiting proportionally more
   yeast-containing artificial flowers. Free-ranging bumble bees also
   preferred yeast-containing nectar in the field. Experiments conducted in
   two different years consistently showed that natural and artificial
   nectars containing yeasts were more thoroughly removed than nectars
   without yeasts. Experimental yeast inoculation of the nectar of H.
   foetidus flowers was significantly associated with reductions in number
   of pollen tubes in the style, fruit set, seed set, and mass of
   individual seeds produced. These results provide the first direct
   evidence to date that nectar yeasts can modify pollinator foraging
   patterns, pollination success, and the quantity and quality of seeds

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Researchers increasingly recognize the important role of mutualisms in
   structuring communities and view positive interactions in a community
   context rather than as simple pairwise interactions. Indirect effects,
   such as those that predators have on lower trophic levels, are a key
   process in community ecology. However, such top-down indirect effects
   have rarely been extended to mutualisms. Antagonists of one mutualist
   have the potential to negatively affect the second mutualist through
   negative effects on their partner, and the magnitude of such effects
   should vary with mutualism strength. Bumble bees are ecologically and
   economically important pollinators that are an ideal system to determine
   if such indirect effects play an important role in mutualisms. Bumble
   bees are attacked by an array of parasites and predators, and they
   interact with a range of plants that vary in their dependence on bumble
   bees for reproduction. We tested whether variation in parasitism rates
   by Nosema bombi, Crithidia bombi, and conopid flies correlated with
   reproduction of greenhouse-raised plants placed in the field. At
   multiple sites over two years, we studied four plant species that varied
   in reliance on bumble bees as pollinators. We found a consistent
   negative relationship between Nosema parasitism and measures of
   pollination for Trifolium pratense and Solanum carolinense, plant
   species with high bumble bee visitation, whereas Rudbeckia hirta and
   Daucus carota, plant species with generalized pollination, experienced
   no impacts of Nosema. However, both Crithidia and conopids showed
   inconsistent relationships with pollination service. Although these
   patterns are correlational, they provide evidence that parasites of
   bumble bees may have negative indirect effects on plants, and that
   mutualism strength can moderate the magnitude of such effects.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated relationships between floral traits of 23 genotypes of
   southern blueberries and indices of pollination efficiency (fruit set,
   fruit abortion, seed number, and berry size) for Osmia ribifloris
   Cockerell, a manageable solitary bee. Flower size in Vaccinium and
   presumably ovary size were proportional to berry size, except for the
   tiny blooms of one V. tenellum clone (NC7808), which produce large
   commercial-sized berries of approximate to 2 g. Longer-styled blueberry
   flowers visited by O. ribifloris produced the heaviest berries with the
   most seeds. Osmia ribifloris reliably pollinated `Climax' and `Tifblue'
   rabbiteye blueberries. However, the peculiarly misshapen blooms of
   `Premier' rabbiteye blueberry receive less pollination from O.
   ribifloris and yield berries containing 25\% fewer seeds. Fruit set for
   these misshapen `Premier' flowers was equivalent to that of intact
   flowers indicating that this floral polymorphism would not greatly alter
   cultivar performance. For seven Vaccinium species, wild and cultivated
   alike, 80\% to 100\% of a plant's fruit production depends on efficient
   cross-pollination by bees such as O. ribifloris.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees that provide pollination services to vegetable crops depend on
   forage resources, nesting sites, and overwintering sites in the
   agricultural landscape. The scale at which crop-visiting bees use
   resources in the landscape can vary regionally, and has not been
   characterized in the Midwestern United States. We investigated the
   effects of seminatural land cover on wild bee visitation frequency to
   cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and on wild bee species richness on 10
   organic farms in Indiana. We estimated the spatial scale at which the
   effects of land cover were strongest, and also examined the effects of
   nonlandscape factors on wild bees. The visitation frequency of wild bees
   to cucumber was positively related to the proportion of seminatural land
   in the surrounding landscape, and this relationship was strongest within
   250 m of the cucumber patch. The species richness of wild cucumber
   visitors was not affected by land cover at any spatial scale, nor by any
   of the nonlandscape factors we considered. Our results indicate that
   wild, crop visiting bees benefit from seminatural areas in the
   agricultural landscape, and benefit most strongly from seminatural areas
   within 250 m of the crop field. This suggests that setting aside natural
   areas in the near vicinity of vegetable fields may be an effective way
   to support wild, crop-visiting bees and secure their pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen host choice in bees is in many cases highly conserved, which
   might partly be due to physiological limitations of bee larvae to digest
   non-host pollen. These limitations need to be overcome in order to
   incorporate new pollen hosts; however, the mechanisms underlying such
   host expansion are poorly understood. In this study, we examined intra-
   and interpopulational variation in the ability of larvae of the solitary
   bee species Osmia cornuta (Megachilidae) to develop on a non-host pollen
   diet of Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae) by comparing larval performance
   within and between five geographically distant European populations. The
   majority of bee larvae from all tested populations died when reared on
   the Ranunculus pollen diet. Between 10\% and 43.5\% of all larvae per
   population reached the cocoon stage, and 48\% of these emerged as viable
   adults from the cocoons, indicating that the physiological ability to
   cope with the unfavourable properties of Ranunculus pollen exists in
   each population. The bee larvae of one population exhibited
   significantly reduced survival on the Ranunculus pollen diet compared
   with three of the four other populations. Although bees that
   successfully developed on the Ranunculus pollen diet showed a distinctly
   prolonged development time, exhibited higher mortality during diapause
   and reached a considerably lower adult weight compared with individuals
   fed the control pollen diet, several of the Ranunculus fed individuals
   were able to reproduce and to sire viable offspring. This study provides
   the first evidence for both intra- and interpopulational variation in
   the physiological ability of solitary bees to digest non-host pollen.
   This variation might enable host expansion and subsequent host shifts in
   response to natural selection.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of nests to rear offspring is restricted to vertebrates
   and few insect taxa, such as termites, wasps, and bees. Among bees,
   species of the family Megachilidae are characterized by a particularly
   high diversity in nest construction behaviour. Many megachilid bees nest
   in excavated burrows in the ground, others place their brood cells in a
   variety of above-ground cavities or attach them to the surface of a
   substrate, and yet others have adopted a kleptoparasitic habit.
   Evolutionary transitions between the different nesting sites and between
   conventional nesting and kleptoparasitism in bees are poorly understood.
   In the present study, we traced the evolution of nesting site selection
   and kleptoparasitism in the AnnosmiaHoplitis group (Osmiini), which
   displays an exceptionally high diversity in nesting behaviour. We found
   that the evolution of nesting behaviour proceeded unidirectionally from
   nesting in excavated burrows in the ground to nesting in rock
   depressions and cavities, followed by the colonization of snail shells
   and insect borings in dead wood or hollow stems. Kleptoparasitism
   evolved once and the kleptoparasitic species have derived from the same
   lineage as their hosts. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London,

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of local and landscape factors on bumblebees
   is relevant for the conservation of this group of pollinators.
   Bumblebees have been well-studied in agricultural landscapes of Western
   Europe, Asia and North America, but few studies have been developed on
   bumblebees in forest-dominated landscapes of Eastern Europe. We
   developed this study in 22 semi-natural meadows located in a patchy
   forested landscape of Estonia. We investigated the influence of habitat
   characteristics and landscape factors (calculated at four spatial
   scales: 250, 500, 1,000 and 2,000 m radius) on the total species
   richness and abundance of bumblebees. Correlation analysis, partial
   least squares (PLS) and stepwise forward-selection multiple regression
   analysis were applied in this study. The presence of a high diversity of
   flowering plants in semi-natural meadows may benefit the abundance of
   bumblebees. At the local level, patch area and shape seem to have
   positive and negative influences, respectively, on bumblebee species
   richness. At the landscape level, human settlements with the presence of
   gardens may favour bumblebee richness and abundance. Also, bumblebee
   species may increase with a high presence of meadows in the landscape,
   and may decrease with high percentages of forest and young forest.
   Overall, forested landscapes with a strong presence of edges and a
   diverse matrix may support a higher species richness and abundance of
   bumblebees. Both local and landscape factors should be considered when
   designing conservation strategies and agri-environmental measures.}},

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Mutualistic networks display distinct structural and organizational
   features such as nestedness, power-law degree distribution and
   asymmetric dependencies. Attention is now focused on how these
   structural properties influence network function. Most plant-pollinator
   networks are constructed using records of animals contacting flowers,
   which is based on the assumption that all visitors to flowers are
   pollinators; however, animals may visit flowers as nectar robbers,
   florivores, or to prey upon other visitors. To differentiate potential
   pollinator interactions from other interaction types, we examined
   individual bees that had visited flowers to detect if they carried
   pollen. Using these data, we constructed visitation and pollen-transport
   networks for a spinifex-dominated arid zone grassland. To determine how
   the structure of the visitation network reflects pollen transport, we
   compared the two networks using a null model approach to account for
   differences in network size. Differences in number of species,
   nestedness and connectance observed between the visitation and
   pollen-transport networks were within expected ranges generated under
   the null model. The pollen-transport network was more specialized, had
   lower interaction evenness, and fewer links compared to the visitation
   network. Almost half the number of species of the visitation network
   participated in the pollen-transport network, and one-third of unique
   visitation interactions resulted in pollen transport, highlighting that
   visitation does not always result in pollination. Floral visitor data
   indicate potential pollen transporters, but inferring pollination
   function from visitation networks needs to be performed cautiously as
   pollen transport resulted from both common and rare interactions, and
   depended on visitor identity. Although visitation and pollen-transport
   networks are structurally similar, the function of all species cannot be
   predicted from the visitation network alone. Considering pollen
   transport in visitation networks is a simple first step towards
   determining pollinators from non-pollinators. This is fundamental for
   understanding how network structure relates to network function.}},

   (silver-leafed nightshade), native to South and Central America and
   South-western parts of North America, on the seed set of the native
   Glaucium flavum Crantz (yellow-horned poppy) on Lesvos Island, Greece.
   To do this we measured seed set and visitation rates to G. flavum before
   and after the placement of potted individuals of the invasive near the
   native plants. In addition, we hand-crossed G. flavum flowers with
   super-optimal amounts of conspecific pollen, bagged flowers to measure
   the rate of spontaneous selfing, and applied self-pollen to measure
   self-compatibility of G. flavum. The hand-selfing treatment resulted in
   very low seed set, which indicates that G. flavum is to a large degree
   self-incompatible and highlights the plant's need for insect-mediated
   outcrossing. We show that the presence of the invasive significantly
   enhanced pollen limitation, although the overall visitation rates were
   not reduced and that this increase is due to a reduction in honeybee
   visitation in the presence of the invasive resulting in reduced
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are important within terrestrial ecosystems, providing pollination,
   which facilitates plant reproduction. Agricultural regions are large
   landscapes containing varying proportions of cropland, natural, and
   semi-natural habitats. Most bees are not restricted to any of these and
   move freely throughout, exploiting food and nesting resources in
   favourable locations. Many factors affect bee diversity, and knowledge
   of these is crucial for promoting healthy bee communities. The main
   objectives of this study were to compare diversity and guild structure
   of bee communities across a range of land disturbance levels within the
   Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia, Canada, in habitats ranging from managed
   apple orchards to old fields. The two habitat extremes differed
   significantly; intensely managed orchards had significantly lower
   species richness (similar to 50\%) than observed/estimated in old
   fields, but orchards with intermediate levels of adjacent
   natural/semi-natural habitat showed affinities to either extreme
   depending on the metrics used for estimating species richness. Species
   assemblages in orchards had lower proportions of several guilds,
   particularly cavity-nesters, bumble bees, and cleptoparasites, than
   other habitats. These guilds accounted for over 30\% of bees collected
   in old fields but only 3-10\% in orchards, increasing with habitat
   complexity. The use of guilds for assessing the health of bee
   communities is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recently there has been considerable concern about declines in bee
   communities in agricultural and natural habitats. The value of
   pollination to agriculture, provided primarily by bees, is >\$200
   billion/year worldwide, and in natural ecosystems it is thought to be
   even greater. However, no monitoring program exists to accurately detect
   declines in abundance of insect pollinators; thus, it is difficult to
   quantify the status of bee communities or estimate the extent of
   declines. We used data from 11 multiyear studies of bee communities to
   devise a program to monitor pollinators at regional, national, or
   international scales. In these studies, 7 different methods for sampling
   bees were used and bees were sampled on 3 different continents. We
   estimated that a monitoring program with 200250 sampling locations each
   sampled twice over 5 years would provide sufficient power to detect
   small (25\%) annual declines in the number of species and in total
   abundance and would cost U.S.\$2,000,000. To detect declines as small as
   1\% annually over the same period would require >300 sampling locations.
   Given the role of pollinators in food security and ecosystem function,
   we recommend establishment of integrated regional and international
   monitoring programs to detect changes in pollinator communities.}},

Abstract = {{Based on recent research on erosion of ecosystem services, planetary
   boundaries and predicted pace of urbanization, it is now apparent that
   humans need to reconnect to the biosphere and that cities in this
   context, properly managed, could provide great opportunities and arenas
   for social ecological change and transformation towards sustainability
   To take advantage of these opportunities one needs to keep in mind that
   most of the ecosystem services consumed in cities are generated by
   ecosystems located outside of the cities themselves, not seldom half a
   world away. In order to operationalize our knowledge, hypothesis and
   theories on the connections between the work of nature and the welfare
   and survival of humans overtime, we suggest the use of the ecosystem
   service framework in combination with the merging of the concept
   ``ecology in cities{''}, mainly focusing on designing energy efficient
   building, sustainable logistics and providing inhabitants with healthy
   and functioning green urban environments, and the ``ecology of
   dries{''}. The ``ecology of cities{''} framework acknowledges the total
   dependence of cities on the surrounding landscape and the ever-ongoing
   dance between urban and rural, viewing the city as an ecosystem. (C)

Abstract = {{Plants respond to insect herbivores with changes in physical and
   chemical traits, both locally and systemically, in leaves and flowers.
   Such phenotypic changes may influence the behaviour of every community
   member that interacts with the plant. Here, we address effects of plant
   responses to eggs and subsequent herbivory by caterpillars on
   plant-mediated interactions with pollinators and consequences for plant
   fitness. Using a common garden set-up, we have investigated responses of
   Brassica nigra plants to herbivore exposure from egg deposition onwards
   throughout larval development. We quantified effects of infestation by
   the specialist Pieris brassicae on: 1. behaviour of pollinators; 2.
   volatile emission and 3. timing and number of seeds produced. Egg
   deposition and folivory did not influence visitation by pollinators to
   plots of infested or control plants. Effects of herbivore infestation on
   both pollinator visitation and volatile emission were observed only at a
   later stage, when caterpillars were feeding on the flowers. Remarkably,
   before eggs had hatched, infested plants accelerated seed production.
   The caterpillars that developed from the eggs fed on flowers but not on
   seeds and thus seed production prior to herbivory on flowers safeguarded
   reproductive output. The results of this study show that early plant
   investments in reproduction can successfully prevent consumption of
   expensive reproductive tissues. By accelerating seed production, plants
   prevented consumption of flowers and effectively defended themselves
   against the herbivores.}},

Title = {{Identification of Olfactory Volatiles using Gas
   Chromatography-Multi-unit Recordings (GCMR) in the Insect Antennal Lobe}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{72}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{All organisms inhabit a world full of sensory stimuli that determine
   their behavioral and physiological response to their environment.
   Olfaction is especially important in insects, which use their olfactory
   systems to respond to, and discriminate amongst, complex odor stimuli.
   These odors elicit behaviors that mediate processes such as reproduction
   and habitat selection(1-3). Additionally, chemical sensing by insects
   mediates behaviors that are highly significant for agriculture and human
   health, including pollination(4-6), herbivory of food crops(7), and
   transmission of disease(8,9). Identification of olfactory signals and
   their role in insect behavior is thus important for understanding both
   ecological processes and human food resources and well-being.
   To date, the identification of volatiles that drive insect behavior has
   been difficult and often tedious. Current techniques include gas
   chromatography-coupled electroantennogram recording (GC-EAG), and gas
   chromatography-coupled single sensillum recordings (GC-SSR)(10-12).
   These techniques proved to be vital in the identification of bioactive
   compounds. We have developed a method that uses gas chromatography
   coupled to multi-channel electrophysiological recordings (termed `GCMR')
   from neurons in the antennal lobe (AL; the insect's primary olfactory
   center)(13,14). This state-of-the-art technique allows us to probe how
   odor information is represented in the insect brain. Moreover, because
   neural responses to odors at this level of olfactory processing are
   highly sensitive owing to the degree of convergence of the antenna's
   receptor neurons into AL neurons, AL recordings will allow the detection
   of active constituents of natural odors efficiently and with high
   sensitivity. Here we describe GCMR and give an example of its use.
   Several general steps are involved in the detection of bioactive
   volatiles and insect response. Volatiles first need to be collected from
   sources of interest (in this example we use flowers from the genus
   Mimulus (Phyrmaceae)) and characterized as needed using standard GC-MS
   techniques(14-16). Insects are prepared for study using minimal
   dissection, after which a recording electrode is inserted into the
   antennal lobe and multi-channel neural recording begins. Post-processing
   of the neural data then reveals which particular odorants cause
   significant neural responses by the insect nervous system.
   Although the example we present here is specific to pollination studies,
   GCMR can be expanded to a wide range of study organisms and volatile
   sources. For instance, this method can be used in the identification of
   odorants attracting or repelling vector insects and crop pests.
   Moreover, GCMR can also be used to identify attractants for beneficial
   insects, such as pollinators. The technique may be expanded to
   non-insect subjects as well.}},

   pair of organic and conventional meadows. Within fields, forbs were
   surveyed at the edge and in the interior. Both diversity and cover of
   forbs were positively affected by organic management in meadows and
   wheat fields. This effect, however, differed significantly between
   pollination types for species richness in both agroecosystem types (i.e.
   wheat fields and meadows) and for cover in meadows. Thus, we show for
   the first time in a comprehensive analysis that insect-pollinated plants
   benefit more from organic management than non-insect pollinated plants
   regardless of agroecosystem type and landscape complexity. These
   benefits were more pronounced in meadows than wheat fields. Finally, the
   community composition of insect-pollinated and non-insect-pollinated
   forbs differed considerably between management types. In summary, our
   findings in both agroecosystem types indicate that organic management
   generally supports a higher species richness and cover of
   insect-pollinated plants, which is likely to be favourable for the
   density and diversity of bees and other pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids are widely used systemic insecticides which, when applied
   to flowering crops, are translocated to the nectar and pollen where they
   may impact upon pollinators. Given global concerns over pollinator
   declines, this potential impact has recently received much attention.
   Field exposure of pollinators to neonicotinoids depends on the
   concentrations present in flowering crops and the degree to which
   pollinators choose to feed upon them. Here we describe a simple
   experiment using paired yellow pan traps with or without insecticide to
   assess whether the commonly used neonicotinoid imidacloprid repels or
   attracts flying insects. Both Diptera and Coleoptera exhibited marked
   avoidance of traps containing imidacloprid at a field-realistic dose of
   1 mu g L-1, with Diptera avoiding concentrations as low as 0.01 mu g
   L-1. This is to our knowledge the first evidence for any biological
   activity at such low concentrations, which are below the limits of
   laboratory detection using most commonly available techniques. Catch of
   spiders in pan traps was also slightly reduced by the highest
   concentrations of imidacloprid used (1 mu g L-1), but catch was
   increased by lower concentrations. It remains to be seen if the
   repellent effect on insects occurs when neonicotinoids are present in
   real flowers, but if so then this could have implications for exposure
   of pollinators to neonicotinoids and for crop pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebee communities and their foraging resources were surveyed in
   south Swedish agricultural landscapes of contrasting complexity, defined
   by the size of arable fields and the amount of permanent grazed
   pastures. After the flowering of oilseed rape (OSR), simplified
   landscapes contained substantially less herbaceous flower resources and
   a lower proportion of perennials, compared to complex ones. The seasonal
   pattern of bumblebee abundance differed between landscape types. Initial
   bumblebee abundances were equal in both landscape types. However, by
   late July there was a sharp decline of bumblebees in simple landscapes,
   while the abundance continued to increase in complex landscapes. This
   suggests that a larger proportion of bumblebee colonies may fail to
   reproduce in simple landscapes despite a beneficial early season.
   Overall, bumblebee abundance in late July was positively related to
   three inter-related variables: area of permanent pasture, area of ley
   fields and total amount of herbaceous flowers, while early abundances
   (June to early July) did not relate to these variables. We suggest that
   in simplified landscapes of this region, bumblebee abundance is limited
   by floral resources mainly from midsummer and onward. Spring and early
   summer resources may indeed be sufficient for colony establishment and
   initial growth even in simplified landscapes, possibly as a result of
   large scale farming of OSR. The initially equal abundances of workers in
   simple and complex landscapes, as well as the fact that also many of the
   regionally rare species seem to persist in simple landscapes, suggest
   that rare species can survive in pockets of beneficial habitat and/or
   there may be an inflow of queens from nearby complex landscapes. If the
   latter is true, further simplification or abandonment of complex
   landscapes may threaten bumblebee populations also in neighbouring
   simple landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators exhibit a range of innate and learned behaviors that mediate
   interactions with flowers, but the olfactory bases of these responses in
   a naturalistic context remain poorly understood. The hawkmoth Manduca
   sexta is an important pollinator for many night-blooming flowers but can
   learn-through olfactory conditioning-to visit other nectar resources.
   Analysis of the flowers that are innately attractive to moths shows that
   the scents all have converged on a similar chemical profile that, in
   turn, is uniquely represented in the moth's antennal (olfactory) lobe.
   Flexibility in visitation to nonattractive flowers, however, is mediated
   by octopamine-associated modulation of antennal-lobe neurons during
   learning. Furthermore, this flexibility does not extinguish the innate
   preferences. Such processing of stimuli through two olfactory channels,
   one involving an innate bias and the other a learned association, allows
   the moths to exist within a dynamic floral environment while maintaining
   specialized associations.}},

Abstract = {{Given widespread declines in pollinator communities and increasing
   global reliance on pollinator-dependent crops, there is an acute need to
   develop a mechanistic understanding of native pollinator population and
   foraging biology. Using a population genetics approach, we determine the
   impact of habitat and floral resource distributions on nesting and
   foraging patterns of a critical native pollinator, Bombus vosnesenskii.
   Our findings demonstrate that native bee foraging is far more plastic
   and extensive than previously believed and does not follow a simple
   optimal foraging strategy. Rather, bumble bees forage further in pursuit
   of species-rich floral patches and in landscapes where patch-to-patch
   variation in floral resources is less, regardless of habitat
   composition. Thus, our results reveal extreme foraging plasticity and
   demonstrate that floral diversity, not density, drives bee foraging
   distance. Furthermore, we find a negative impact of paved habitat and a
   positive impact of natural woodland on bumble bee nesting densities.
   Overall, this study reveals that natural and human-altered landscapes
   can be managed for increased native bee nesting and extended foraging,
   dually enhancing biodiversity and the spatial extent of pollination
   services.}},

Title = {{Adding Perches for Cross-Pollination Ensures the Reproduction of a
   Self-Incompatible Orchid}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Outcrossing is known to carry genetic advantages in
   comparison with inbreeding. In many cases, flowering plants develop a
   self-incompatibility mechanism, along with a floral component adaptation
   mechanism, to avoid self-pollination and to promote outbreeding. Orchids
   commonly have a lip in their flower that functions as the a visiting
   plate for insect pollinators. Aside from the lip, however, many species
   (including Coelogyne rigida) have sheaths around the axis of
   inflorescence. The function of these sheaths remains unknown, and has
   long been a puzzle to researchers.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We investigated the function of these
   sheaths in relation to the lip and the pollinators, as well as their
   role in the modes of pollination and reproduction of Coelogyne rigida in
   30 flowering populations of orchids in the limestone area of Southeast
   Yunnan, China. We found that self-incompatible C. rigida developed
   specialized bird perches around the basal axis of inflorescence to
   attract sunbirds and to complement their behavioral tendency to change
   foraging locations frequently. This self-incompatibility mechanism
   operates separately from the floral component adaptation mechanism. This
   mechanism thus prevents bees from repeatedly visiting the floral lip of
   the same plant which, in turn, results in autogamy. In this way, instead
   of preventing autogamy, C. rigida responds to these negative effects
   through a highly efficient cross-pollination method that successfully
   transfers pollen to different plants.
   Conclusions: The proposed method ensures reproductive success, while
   offsetting the infertile self-pollination by insects, thereby reducing
   mating costs and addressing the lack of cross-pollination. The
   adaptation provides a novel and striking example of structural
   adaptation that promotes cross-pollination in angiosperms.}},

Abstract = {{Successful cross-fertilization in plant species that rely on animal
   pollinators depends not just on the number of pollinator visits, but
   also on these visits' duration. Furthermore, in non-deceptive
   pollination, a visit's duration depends on the magnitude of the reward
   provided to the pollinator. Accordingly, plants that rely on biotic
   pollination have to partition their investment in cross-fertilization
   assurance between attracting pollinator visits - advertisement, and
   rewarding visitors to assure that the visit is of productive duration.
   Here we analyze these processes by a combination of optimality methods
   and game theoretical modeling.
   Our results indicate that the optimality in such allocation of resources
   depends on the types of reward offered to the pollinators. More
   precisely, we show that plants that offer both food reward and mating
   rendezvous to pollinators will evolve to allocate a higher proportion of
   their cross-fertilization assurance budget to advertisement than plants
   that offer only food reward. That is, our results indicate that
   pollinators' mating habits may play a role in floral evolution. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Although bees are important pollinators in several ecosystems around the
   world, studies on bee diversity in hygrophilous forests are scarce. This
   type of vegetation is restricted to permanently wet soils and,
   therefore, has particular floristic, structure and physiognomy. The goal
   of the present study was to inventory and analyze the temporal variation
   of the euglossine bees that occur in a neotropical hygrophilous forest.
   In order to sample male bees we used four chemical baits, eucalyptol,
   eugenol, vanillin, and methyl salicylate. The captures were made once a
   month, from March 2010 to February 2011, from 9: 00 am to 12: 00 pm. We
   captured 113 individuals of three genera and five species (in decreasing
   order of abundance): Eulaema nigrita Lepeletier, 1841 (n=52), Euglossa
   pleosticta Dressler, 1982 (34), Exaerete smaragdina (Guerin-Meneville,
   1844) (12), Euglossa carolina Nemesio, 2009 (11), and Euglossa fimbriata
   Rebelo \& Moure, 1968 (4). The most attractive bait was eucalyptol
   (n=98), followed by vanillin (11), and eugenol (4). Both temperature and
   rainfall affected significantly the distribution of the number of males
   throughout the year. The highest number of Euglossini species and
   individuals was sampled in the warm and rainy season, with activity
   peaks varying among species.}},

Title = {{Pollinator scarcity drives the shift to delayed selfing in Himalayan
   mayapple Podophyllum hexandrum (Berberidaceae)}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Abstract = {{Recent molecular phylogenetics have indicated that American mayapple
   (mainly self-incompatible, SI) and Himalayan mayapple, which was
   considered to be self-compatible (SC), are sister species with disjunct
   distribution between eastern Asia and eastern North America. We test a
   hypothesis that the persistence of this early spring flowering herb in
   the Himalayan region is attributable to the transition from SI to SC,
   the capacity for selfing in an unpredictable pollination environment.
   Pollinator observations were conducted in an alpine meadow with hundreds
   of Himalayan mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum Royle) individuals over 2
   years. To examine autogamy, seed set under different pollination
   treatments was compared. To clarify whether automatic self-pollination
   is achieved by movement of the pistil as a previous study suggested, we
   measured incline angles of the pistil and observed flower movement
   during anthesis using video. Floral visitors to the nectarless flowers
   were very rare, but solitary bees and honeybees could be potential
   pollinators. Seed set of bagged flowers was not significantly different
   from that of open-pollinated, self-or cross-pollinated flowers. However,
   removal of petals or stamens lowered seed yield. The angles of
   inclination of pistils did not change during the process of pollination.
   Automatic self-pollination was facilitated by petals closing and stamens
   moving simultaneously to contact the stigma. Stigmatic pollen load
   increased little during the daytime, in contrast to a sharp increase
   when the flowers closed during the night-time. These observations
   indicated that Himalayan mayapple was SC and delayed self-pollination
   was facilitated by the movement of petals rather than the pistil.
   Compared with SI American mayapple, no obvious inbreeding depression in
   SC Himalayan mayapple may contribute its existence in the uplifting
   zone. A scarcity of pollinators may have driven the shift to delayed
   selfing in P. hexandrum.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Background. Schima wallichii is a highly valuable tree of tropical
   forest in north-east Himalaya region that grows naturally in a wide
   range of altitudes between 750 and 2400 m asl with varying environments.
   Flowering phenology of tropical tree species at population level is
   generally ignored and therefore a detailed knowledge of flowering and
   fruiting patterns of important multipurpose tree species is critical to
   the successful management of forest genetic resources. Materials and
   Methods. The study was conducted at two different altitudes (i.e., 750 m
   and 900 m asl) in the tropical semideciduous forest of north-east
   Himalaya. The floral phenology including flowering synchrony in the
   populations, anthesis, anther dehiscence, stigma receptivity,
   pollinators visitation frequency, and mating system including index of
   self-incompatibility were worked out in Schima wallichii according to
   the ear-marked standard methods given by various scientists for each
   parameter. Results. The flowering period in Schima wallichii varied from
   33 to 42 days with mean synchrony of 0.54 to 0.68 between the
   populations. The stigma was receptive up to 2.5 days only and showed
   slightly protandrous type of dichogamy. Average pollen production ranged
   between 6.90 x 10(7) pollen per tree in 2007 and 15.49 x 10(8) pollen
   per tree in 2011. A three-year masting cycle was noticed in this
   species. The frequency of visitation of honey bees was fairly high (5.2
   +/- 1.12 visits/flower/hour) as compared to other pollinators. The hand
   pollination revealed maximum fruit (74.2 +/- 5.72\%) and seed (70.8 +/-
   7.46\%) settings. Conclusions. The variation in flowering phenology and
   pollen yield individually and annually along with temporal separation in
   anther dehiscence and pollinator's visitation cause pollen limited
   reproduction, which ultimately influences the reproductive success in
   Schima wallichii.}},

Abstract = {{The red mason bee Osmia bicomis L. (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a
   solitary gregarious species that is known to be a good pollinator of
   pear, apple, and several other Rosaceae fruit plants. Mainly females are
   active in plant pollination, and therefore they are of strong interest
   to farmers. As natural populations are usually male biased, here we
   studied the possibility of rearing a female-biased population of Osmia
   bicornis by examining the effects of sex ratio changes on female
   survival, insemination rate, and sperm count in the spermatheca. Using
   bees that had completed their winter diapause and were maintained in
   flying cages, we created three groups with different male:female sex
   ratios: 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. The 1:3 sex-ratio group exhibited the best
   survival of females, but the lowest spermathecae sperm count. The
   insemination rate did not differ between groups. Our results indicate
   that at least among bees housed in isolator cages for plant
   breeding-skewing the sex ratio towards more females does not affect bee
   survival, and efficient insemination can be expected with twice as many
   females as males.}},

   Andrenidae (five species), Anthophoridae (seven species), Apidae (only
   one species), Halictidae (fourty-six species) and Megachilidae (four
   species) families were identified. It was observed that thirty-seven

Abstract = {{Eight species of Lasioglossum are recorded from New Caledonia. A new
   cleptoparasitic and endemic subgenus with one new species, Lasioglossum
   (Parachilalictus n. subg.) neocaledonicum n. sp., is described. The
   following new endemic species of the subgenus Chilalictus are described
   : Lasioglossum (Chilalictus) alticola n. sp., L. (C.) tchambae n. sp.
   and L. (C.) webbi n. sp. A new subspecies, Lasioglossum (Chilalictus)
   polygoni austrocaledonicum n. ssp. is described from New Caledonia and
   Australia. The Australian species L. (Chilalictus) lanarium (Smith 1853)
   and L. (C.) instabilis (Cockerell 1914) are recorded for the first time
   from New Caledonia. Lasioglossum (Parasphecodes) sulthicum (Smith 1853)
   is the first species of this Australian subgenus to be recorded from New
   Caledonia. The emergence of cleptoparasitism and speciation in this
   insular situation are discussed. The cleptoparasitism of this new
   subgenus Parachilalictus n. subg. can be demonstrated by examining a set
   of convergent morphological characters among groups of parasitic
   Halictids, such as a reduced pollen collecting brush on the hind legs
   and flattening of the keel of labrum. The strong resemblance of
   Parachilalictus n. subg. to endemic species of Chilalictus and its
   absence in Australia suggests recent and local speciation. The two new
   endemic species described in the subgenus Chilalictus, from which
   Parachilalictus n. subg. might have emerged, both have a mountain
   distribution. Within the L. polygoni species-complex, speciation is
   expressed through variation in the density and strength of punctuation.
   At low altitude and along the drier west coast, we find the typical
   subspecies polygoni. At altitude ranging from 5 to 1150m, there are
   clearly two other subspecies. The new subspecies austrocaledonica is
   found only in the southern part of the island, in an open ``maquis{''}
   environment, while the subspecies delobeli Munzinger \& Pauly 2003 has a
   wider distribution on the mountains of the east, and was mainly seen in
   forest tracks in the rainforest. The latter subspecies occurs also in
   Australia.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of pollination syndromes in predicting pollinators has been
   controversial. Flowers of Guihaiothamnus acaulis are tubular and vivid
   in color, indicating that butterflies might be the dominant pollinators
   of this species, based on the theory of pollination syndromes. To test
   this prediction, observations on the floral biology, pollinator
   behaviors, and breeding system were carried out in two wild populations.
   The results showed that diurnal and protandrous flowers of G. acaulis
   could last 7-10 days, and this species was self-incompatible. Thus, the
   fruit set was pollinator-dependent. In addition, pollen-consuming
   hoverflies and halictid bees were identified as the major pollinators of
   G. acaulis; butterflies were recorded as visiting the flower only once.
   The expanded corolla throat, massive pollen per flower, and high floral
   longevity suggest that G. acaulis had experienced the process of
   pollinator shift. Our results indicated that the actual pollinating
   fauna of plants were determined by complex factors including floral
   syndromes, the availability of pollinators, and historical adaptation to
   habitat. Pollination syndromes should be used carefully to predict
   pollinators of a particular flowering plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Oils are atypical floral rewards in Orchidaceae and are produced by
   epidermal glands called elaiophores. Flowers of many members of the
   subtribe Oncidiinae either produce oil or mimic oil-producing flowers of
   Malpighiaceae. We focus our research on 3 species of Gomesa, namely, G.
   flexuosa, G. riograndensis, and G. varicosa in order to investigate the
   presence of elaiophores, their micromorphology and internal structure,
   and the process of oil secretion. Elaiophores were located using Sudan
   III and their internal and external features examined using light and
   scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The presence of elaiophores
   was confirmed for regions of calli that are prominent and exposed. In
   all 3 species the secretory tissue comprised a single layer of epidermal
   cells, together with some parenchymatous, subsecretory cells. Epidermal
   cells were isodiametric or palisade-like, with dense cytoplasm, small
   vacuoles, and prominent nuclei. Gomesa flexuosa differs from the other
   species investigated in that it bears intermediate elaiophores (i.e.
   epithelial and possessing unicellular, secretory trichomes). Based on
   the absence of a distended cuticle, we propose that oil may pass through
   the wall and cuticle as small lipid moieties. In addition, some
   evolutionary trends in the elaiophores in the genus Gomesa are
   suggested.}},

Title = {{Nesting behavior and ecological preferences of five Diphaglossinae
   species (Hymenoptera, Apoidea, Colletidae) from Argentina and Chile}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The nests of Cadeguala albopilosa (Spinola, 1851), Diphaglossa gayi
   Spinola, 1851, Ptiloglossa tarsata (Friese, 1900), Ptiloglossa matutina
   (Schrottky, 1904) and Zikanapis tucumana (Moure, 1945) (Colletidae,
   Diphaglossinae) from Argentina and Chile are described herein. They show
   similar features to those of other Diphaglossinae: they consist of a
   main tunnel, cells disposed radially, isolated or in pairs, and
   connected to the main tunnel by laterals ones. Main tunnels are mostly
   vertical in species nesting in soil surface but horizontal to inclined
   in D. gayi, which nests in banks. Cells are vertical with curved necks.
   The cells of C. albopilosa show less curved necks (less than 90
   degrees), whereas in the remaining four species the cell neck is highly
   curved (90 degrees or more). Cells of P. tarsata have a spiral earthen
   closure and a wad cotton-like material, whereas in P. matutina only had
   the last one. In the remaining studied species any type of closure were
   found. Cocoons of C. albopilosa and P. tarsata are coriaceous showing a
   closure composed of three disks. Zikanapis tucumana and possibly P.
   matutina showed dim-light foraging. The remaining species are diurnal.
   The climate in their nesting sites is highly diverse, ranging from 8
   degrees C to 20 degrees C in mean annual temperature, and from 250 mm to
   3000 mm in mean annual precipitation. Only C. albopilosa and, to a
   lesser extent, Z. tucumana nested gregariously. Zikanapis tucumana and
   P. tarsata were observed visiting flowers of Solanum.}},

Title = {{Bird-pollinated Macaronesian Lotus (Leguminosae) evolved within a group

Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{193-204}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed the evolution of red/orange flowers in four putatively
   bird-pollinated species of Macaronesian Lotus, with the aim of
   investigating whether this floral trait evolved from a similar trait
   found in some entomophilous Lotus species, namely the ability to modify
   flower color to red after anthesis. First, we mapped the ability to
   modify flower color in this group on a well-resolved and densely sampled
   phylogenetic tree of the Macaronesian Lotus. Secondly, we determined
   differences in light reflectance and pigment composition between petals
   of (1) prechange and postchange flowers in bee-pollinated species and
   (2) between bee and putatively bird-pollinated species. Post-anthesis
   flower color change evolved three times within Macaronesian Lotus, and
   putatively bird-pollinated species evolved within a clade with this
   ability to change flower color to red after anthesis. The evolutionary
   transition to red/orange flowers in the putatively bird-pollinated
   species involved biochemical changes similar to those of the
   developmental transition to red postchange flowers. In both cases there
   are changes in the composition of flavonols and anthocyanidins within
   the same metabolic pathways, especially in the cyanidin branch of
   pigment production, but not the activation or inactivation of additional
   branches of this pathway. Post-anthesis color change in Lotus, from
   yellow to red, is thought to be an adaptation to reduce bee visits to
   already pollinated flowers. Our results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that constitutive red coloration for bird-pollination evolved
   from facultative red flower color change in Lotus. As red post-anthesis
   coloration is widespread in plants, this may possibly represent a
   widespread exaptive mechanism for the evolution of bird pollination. (C)

Abstract = {{Tilia cordata is a good source of food attractants for bees. These
   insects are the primary pollinators of flowers of this species. Nectar
   is produced in the floral trichomatous nectaries located on a projection
   of the adaxial, basal part of the sepals. There were two types of
   non-glandular hairs on the sepals; the first one to prevent the nectar
   from flowing out beyond the sepal and the other type to protect the
   nectary itself. The clavate secretory trichomes, forming dense clusters,
   are composed of a base, stalk, and multicellular head. The secretory
   cells of the trichome head contain a thick cytoplasm and a large
   nucleus; they are also characterized by a low degree of vacuolation.
   Nectar accumulates at the tip of the trichome in the space formed
   between the cell wall of the head cells and the cuticle. The
   several-layered subepidermal glandular parenchyma with densely packed
   cells is provided with vascular bundles containing xylem and phloem.
   Plastids containing small starch grains were noticed in many cells of
   the nectariferous tissue, whereas phenolic compounds were found in the
   adaxial epidermal cells of the sepals. No presence of starch, lipids, or
   phenolic compounds was found in the cells of the glandular hairs.
   However, numerous chloroplasts, calcium oxalate crystals and large
   mucilage cavities occurred in the subglandular tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The use of commercial bumble bees for crop pollination has been
   implicated in the decline of wild bumble bees through the spread of
   pathogens. This study investigates whether diseases from commercial
   bumble bees threaten native species in the UK. We sampled bumble bees
   from ten soft fruit farms: five that deploy commercial Bombus terrestris
   and five that do not. Each farm was visited monthly throughout the
   summer and workers of B. terrestris; B. pratorum, B. pascuorum and B.
   lapidarius were captured. The faeces of these bees were inspected for
   the gut microparasites Crithidia spp., Nosema bombi and Apicystis bombi.
   Prevalence was defined as the proportion of individuals infected and
   abundance was defined as the number of pathogen cells per volume of
   bumble bee faeces. The prevalence of A. bombi and N. bombi was too low
   to analyse. The prevalence and abundance of Crithidia spp. was
   significantly different among bumble bee species. Overall, the
   prevalence of Crithidia spp. was initially lower on farms deploying
   commercial bumble bees, possibly due to a dilution effect caused by the
   high density of imported bees. Crithidia spp. prevalence in Bombus
   terrestris, however, rose sharply on commercial farms at the end of the
   season. One potential explanation is that commercial bumble bees
   contract the local pathogen, which is then rapidly transmitted among
   them due to the high bee density. Whilst our data provide no evidence of
   pathogen spillover to wild species, it would be premature to conclude
   with certainty that commercial colonies do not represent a disease risk
   to native bees in the UK and we urge further studies into this
   phenomenon.}},

   Asteraceae of the Atlantic Forest understory with fleshy fruits}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{370-380}},
Abstract = {{Many Asteraceae species inhabit open vegetation areas and, as a rule,
   members of this family have dry, wind-dispersed fruits. Tilesia baccata,
   on the other hand, occurs in forested areas and, differently from all
   neotropical Asteraceae, has fleshy fruits with ornithochorous
   characteristics. However, no studies have confirmed the dispersion by
   birds or any other aspect of the reproductive biology of this unique
   Asteraceae. The present study aims to investigate the reproductive
   phenology, floral biology and breeding system and to identify the
   pollinators and seed dispersers of T. baccata. The study was carried out
   in a natural population located in a semideciduous forest (Vicosa, Minas
   Gerais State), southeastern Brazil. The reproductive cycle of T. baccata
   is annual and seasonal, related to precipitation, temperature and day
   length. The longevity of flowers and capitula depends on the performance
   of pollinators and dispersers. Hand pollination tests showed that the
   species is self-incompatible and therefore dependent on synchronous
   flowering and pollinator availability. Pollination occurred in the
   morning, in the period of pollen availability, and social bees were the
   major pollinator group. Seeds are dispersed by frugivorous birds, that
   swallow the ripe fruit's and defecate viable seeds later. Our study
   confirmed the bird dispersal of Tilesia baccata seeds and also
   demonstrates that pollinator activity and fruit removal by birds
   influence the magnitude of activity and the intensity of flowering and
   fruiting. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A global decline in pollinator abundance and diversity has demanded
   increased research attention to the ecology and genetics of bumblebees.
   However, as progressively more restrictions are placed on sampling for
   insects, researchers are increasingly obliged to use archival specimens
   collected for purposes other than genetic analyses. In this study we
   assessed the suitability, for population genetic studies, of popular,
   low-cost methods for preservation and storage of bumblebee specimens.
   Specimens of Bombus terrestris L. were held under six storage regimes
   for up to two years. DNA was extracted from the samples using three
   extraction protocols and the quality of the DNA was examined using PCR
   amplification of a mitochondrial and a nuclear gene. All extraction and
   storage methods provided sufficient DNA for successful PCR
   amplification. However, samples preserved in acetone or at freezing
   temperatures yielded the highest DNA concentrations. DNA yields from
   pinned specimens at room temperature declined over time, particularly
   when using standard extraction techniques. DNA concentrations were
   significantly lower from specimens preserved in 70\% ethanol compared to
   all other extraction techniques and declined linearly over the two years
   of storage. These results indicate that two of the most popular insect
   storage methods (pinning and storage in ethanol) should be avoided for
   the long-term preservation of genetic material for future studies. We
   suggest that optimal insect preservation methods should be incorporated
   into research protocols in order to best capitalise on limited
   collection opportunities.}},

   between plants and their pollinators. We recorded the insects visiting
   the flowers of Sedirea japonica that might be pollinators of this
   species by using digital cameras to take photographs automatically of
   the flowers. Based on our evidence of pollinia being attached or removed
   from flowers, we conclude that Sedirea japonica can be pollinated by
   Bombus diversus diversus.}},

Abstract = {{Decline in crop pollinators has raised concern that crop productions of
   agri-ecosystems could be influenced. To date, most studies were carried
   out at field scales or landscape scales, but little is known regarding
   how pollinator abundance and the corresponding pollination services vary
   at growing region scales. Therefore, investigations were conducted to
   explore the pollinator abundance and reproductive success of Camellia
   oleifera Able., between the tree's primary growing region and the
   plateau growing region. The abundance of solitary bee Andrena camellia
   Wu., declined from the primary region to the plateau region, whereas the
   abundance of social wasps increased. Honeybees and flies occasionally
   visited the flowers in both regions, but their visit densities were
   notably low. Among those species, only solitary bee was effective in
   transferring pollens. Pollinators deposited approximately 9 pollen
   grains on the stigmas in the primary region, but deposited approximately
   0 pollen grains in the plateau region. C. oleifera trees in the plateau
   region underwent a higher level of pollen limitation than those in the
   primary region due to a shortage of the legitimate pollinator, A.
   camellia. (C) 2013 Friends Science Publishers}},

Journal = {{NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{31}},

Pages = {{361-371}},
Abstract = {{We investigated patterns of flower-size variation along altitudinal
   gradients in the bee-pollinated perennial Campanula rotundifolia
   (Campanulaceae) by examining 22 Norwegian populations at altitudes
   between 240 and 1100 m a.s.l. We explored potential mechanisms for the
   underlying pattern by quantifying pollinator-faunal composition,
   pollinator-visitation rates and pollen limitation of seed set in subsets
   of the study populations. Despite a decrease in plant size, several
   measures of flower size increased with elevation. Bumble bees were the
   main pollinators at both alpine and lowland sites in the study area.
   However, species composition of the pollinator fauna differed, and
   pollinators were larger in higher-elevation than in lower-elevation
   sites. Pollinator visitation rates were lower at higher-elevations than
   at lower elevations. Pollen limitation of seed set did not vary
   significantly with altitude. Our results are consistent with differences
   in bumble-bee size and visitation rates as causal mechanisms for the
   relatively larger flowers at higher elevations, in three non-mutually
   exclusive ways: 1) Larger flowers reflect selection for increased
   attractiveness where pollinators are rare. 2) Larger and fewer flowers
   represent a risk avoidance strategy where the probability of pollination
   is low on any given day. 3) Flower size variation reflects selection to
   improve the fit of pollinators with fertile structures by matching
   flower size to pollinator size across sites.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents information on Stelis minima Schenck, 1859, a species
   of cleptoparasitic bee new to Polish fauna representing the family
   Megachilidae. Stelis minima, probably inhabits most of Europe except for
   the southern and northern parts of the continent. The species was also
   found in the southern part of Finland, where it reaches its northern
   range limit (ca. 62 degrees N). During the years 2002-2006 four
   specimens of S. minima were collected in the Krakow-Czestochowa Upland
   (1 male) and Roztocze region (2 females and 1 male). All specimens were
   observed close to nests of probable host species of solitary bees -
   Chelostoma campanularum (Kirby, 1802) and Heriades truncorum (Linnaeus,
   1758). The female of Stelis minima can be distinguished from other
   Central European species by the following characteristics: rounded head,
   clypeus about 1.5 times wider than its length, legs black, hind
   basitarsus almost parallel sided (not broadened on the distal part),
   distances between punctures on mesopleurae ca. as big as their diameter,
   posterior margins of metasomal tergites (T) black and without lateral
   bands of hair, T-1 or T1-2 with small, lateral, yellowish white maculae;
   the maculae are sometimes absent. The male Stelis minima can be
   separated from other Central European species by the following
   characteristics: clypeus short (not covering mandibles), legs black,
   distances between punctures on mesopleurae and tergites T4-5 ca. as big
   as their diameter, posterior margins of metasomal tergites black and
   without lateral bands of hair, T1-2 or T1-3 with small, lateral
   yellowish white maculae, posterior margin of seventh tergite with short
   mid-process, posterior margin of third sternite with triangular
   emargination in the middle, posterior margin of fourth sternite with a
   tooth-like, mid-process.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of solitary bees varies depending on the vegetation,
   nesting habitats, and nesting fragmentation. The agriculture development
   in the Suez Canal region is receiving a great deal of attention in
   Egypt, thus, the diversity of solitary bees are essential for high
   quality production of seeds, vegetables, and fruit. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the biodiversity of solitary bee populations
   around the Canal region. About 900 - 1000 specimens of bees were
   collected from different locations of the Ismailia, Suez, and Sinai
   Governorates. Fifty-five species of bees were identified. With the
   exception of Melittidae family, all the bee families were present in the
   Canal region. The total number of species for each family were 7, 9, 11,
   13, and 15 species for Andrenidae, Colletidac, Apidac, Halictidae, and
   Megachilidae, respectively. Lasioglossum mandibularie (Morawitz, 1866)
   is a newly recorded species collected from Egypt. In the Suez Canal
   region, the most abundant species found with large populations were

Abstract = {{Urban areas have a specific ecological environment and may help to
   sustain local pollinator populations by the cultivation. of different
   ornamental plants with entomophilous flowers. This year-long study
   examined the flowering pattern, abundance of flowering, pollen
   production as well as insect visitation of two cultivars of the
   ornamental shrub Potentilla fruticosa L. ('Maanleys' and `Blink'), grown
   in Lublin; a city in south-eastern Poland. P. fruticosa `Maanleys'
   bloomed from the middle of May to the first decade of September and P.
   fruticosa `Blink' from June until October. The pattern of diurnal
   flowering was similar for both cultivars and showed plasticity in the
   season. Flowers opened most intensively in the morning hours, and 80 -
   90\% of the daily installment of newly opened flowers expanded by 8.00 h
   GMT +2h. A delay in the peak of diurnal flowering was noted between the
   spring/summer and summer/autumn periods. The most intense blooming fell
   in the 2nd month of flowering. The mass of pollen produced per flower
   depended on both the number of anthers and the efficiency of
   archesporial tissues. The pollen output varied from 1.4 to 7.2 mg per 10
   flowers ('Maanleys') and from 2.6 to 4.5 mg per 10 flowers ('Blink').
   The mass of pollen produced per individual shrub was substantially
   related to the abundance of blooming. The average estimated pollen
   productivity in the full flowering phase was low; 1 g ('Maanleys') and
   1.5 g ('Blink') per 10 m(2) of shrub crown. The flowers of Potentilla
   fruticosa attracted numerous insects, mainly solitary bees (33 - 43\%),
   dipterans (31 - 42\%), lepidopterans (4 - 14\%), bumblebees (3 - 15\%),
   and honey bees (3 - 4\%). The Potentilla fruticosa `Maanleys' and
   `Blink' are propagated for specific ornamental arrangements and due to a
   long flowering period may be used in small urban courtyards for both
   decorative value and as a pollen delivering plants.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Plant-emitted hydrocarbons mediate several key interactions between
   plants and insects. They enhance the ability of pollinators and
   herbivores to locate suitable host plants, and parasitoids to locate
   herbivores. While plant volatiles provide strong chemical signals, these
   signals are potentially degraded by exposure to pollutants such as
   ozone, which has increased in the troposphere and is projected to
   continue to increase over the coming decades. Despite the potential
   broad ecological significance of reduced plant signaling effectiveness,
   few studies have examined behavioral responses of insects to their hosts
   in polluted environments. Here, we use a laboratory study to test the
   effect of ozone concentration gradients on the ability of the striped
   cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) to locate flowers of its host plant,
   Cucurbita foetidissima. Y-tube experiments showed that ozone mixing
   ratios below 80 parts per billion (ppb) resulted in beetles moving
   toward their host plant, but levels above 80 ppb resulted in beetles
   moving randomly with respect to host location. There was no evidence
   that beetles avoided polluted air directly. The results show that ozone
   pollution has great potential to perniciously alter key interactions
   between plants and animals.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{In 2010, an online survey was conducted to assess the current status of
   the Australian stingless bee industry and its recent development. This
   was a follow-up survey conducted approximately one decade after the
   first study, by Heard and Dollin in 1998/99. It showed that the
   Australian industry had grown over the past ten or so years but is still
   underdeveloped. There was a 2.5-fold increase in the number of bee
   keepers and a 3.5 fold increase in the number of domesticated colonies.
   Seventy-eight percent of bee keepers were hobbyists, 54\% of whom owned
   only one colony. Most colonies were kept in suburban areas. Two species,
   Tetragonula carbonaria and Austroplebeia australis, dominated the
   relatively short list of species kept. There was a high demand for
   Australian stingless bee colonies and their honey, but with less than
   250 bee keepers currently propagating colonies, and many of them on a
   small scale, it is difficult to meet this demand. Pollination services
   were provided by less than 4\% of the major stakeholders within the
   industry. Further research and development in the area of colony
   propagation may see this industry grow more quickly.}},

   hornet}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{4-10}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The Yellow-legged hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax has established
   viable populations in France since an unintentional introduction before
   2004, and the potential invasion risk of this bee-hawking hornet was
   estimated by modelling the species climatic suitability worldwide. By
   further projecting such models under 2100 future climate scenarios, we
   here estimated the predicted trends in invasion risk related to climate
   change. We performed eight different modelling techniques within an
   ensemble forecast framework using presence data from the native and the
   invaded ranges. We predicted an increase in the climatic suitability for
   the species in the Northern hemisphere, especially close to the already
   invaded range in Europe, in Spain and in Central and Eastern Europe -
   from Switzerland to Hungary up to Southern Sweden. Climate change should
   also increase the invasion risk in the United States except along the
   Eastern coast. Scenarios for future climates include predictions from
   five global circulation models and three special reports on emission
   scenarios. Standard deviations of the results obtained from the 13
   different climate scenarios confirmed the low uncertainty of models to
   predict an increase in invasion risk across Central and Eastern Europe,
   close to the already invaded European range. These regions hold among
   the highest densities of bee-hives in Europe, and could suffer from the
   potential predation of the putative invading hornet on pollinators. (C)

Abstract = {{The incorporation of natural, non-crop vegetation in and around
   farmlands is a common practice in many agroecosystems, and may provide
   benefits both for production and conservation of biological diversity.
   In coffee agroecosystems, non-crop vegetation is routinely incorporated
   in the form of shade trees or forest habitat in and around coffee
   plants. In order to assess the importance of adjacent forest habitat to
   Hymenoptera associated with coffee farms, we sampled Hymenoptera on
   twelve coffee farms in the Tarrazu region in the central highlands of
   Costa Rica. Six of the farms were adjacent to forest habitat, and six
   were spatially isolated from forest; farms were sampled in both the dry
   (flowering) and the rainy (non-flowering) seasons. On adjacent farms,
   Hymenoptera samples taken in coffee and forest habitat were also
   compared. Finally, we also conducted pollinator observations in each
   type of farm, comparing Hymenoptera visitors to coffee plants in
   adjacent vs. isolated farms. Our results revealed an interaction in
   hymenopteran diversity between farm isolation and season, suggesting
   that both forest and coffee habitats play important roles at different
   times for Hymenoptera, especially bees.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{107-120}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{To gain insight into the drivers of pollinator loss, a holistic approach
   to land-use change including habitat size, isolation, habitat quality
   and the surrounding landscape matrix is necessary. Moreover, species'
   responses to land-use change may differ depending on their life history
   traits such as dispersal ability, trophic level, or sociality. We
   assessed species richness and life history traits of wild bees in 32
   calcareous grasslands in central Germany that differ in size,
   connectivity, resource availability and landscape context. Declining
   habitat area and, to a lesser degree, reduced diversity of the
   surrounding landscape were the key factors negatively influencing
   species richness. In the community-wide analysis, small body size and
   solitary reproduction were traits that made species particularly
   vulnerable to habitat loss. Contrary to our expectations,
   cleptoparasitic species were not more affected by reduced habitat area
   and landscape diversity than nest-building species. We performed further
   detailed trait analyses within the family Halictidae to prevent possible
   confounding effects due to trait correlations across families. Here,
   social as opposed to solitary species were more affected by habitat
   loss. We conclude that the opposite pattern observed for all social bees
   was mainly caused by large-sized social bumblebee species with high
   mobility and large foraging distances. Our results demonstrate the risks
   of concealed trait interference when analyzing community-wide patterns
   of life history traits. As a consequence, conservation requirements of
   small social bee species might be overlooked by generalizations from
   community responses.}},

   syndromes?}},

Abstract = {{Three different pollination syndromes (bee, humming-bird and
   moth-pollination syndromes) have been described for the different
   species of the genus Schizanthus Ruiz \& Pav. (Solanaceae). Two closely
   related species from a phylogenetic point of view, Schizanthus grahamii
   and Schizanthus hookeri, show hummingbird and bee-pollination syndromes,
   respectively. One of the traits used to assign these pollination
   syndromes is the colour of the petals, which is red in S. grahamii and
   bluish-pink in S. hookeri. The objective of this work was to establish
   the differences in the anthocyanin composition of these two Schizanthus
   species that contribute to the different pollination syndrome.
   Identification of the pigments was carried out from the chromatographic
   and spectral data supplied by the HPLC-DAD-MSn analyses of the samples.
   Alkaline and acid hydrolyses were also performed in the extracts and in
   some isolated compounds in order to confirm the identities. First
   difference between these two species was found in the total anthocyanin
   content, which was about 13-fold higher in S. grahamii than in S.
   hookeri. Furthermore, the major peak was also different in both cases,
   thus explaining quantitative and qualitative colour differences between
   species. Delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside represented ca. 72\% of the total
   area in S. grahamii and petanin (Petunidin
   3-O-p-coumaroylrutinoside-5-O-glucoside) accounted for almost 62\% of
   the total area in S. hookeri. The presence of the p-coumaroylrutinosyl
   moiety in the petanin makes the intramolecular copigmentation possible,
   thus conferring the bluish-pink hue to the petals of S. hookeri.
   Delphinidin 3-O-rutinoside is in turn responsible for the red colour
   exhibited by the petals of S. grahamii and along with other floral
   traits, responsible for the attraction of hummingbirds to the plant.
   Pigments structurally related to petanin, which have been often detected
   in other genus of Solanaceae, were detected in both species and in
   similar contents, supporting results from previous studies that pointed
   to a bee-pollinated common ancestor for both species that further
   specialised acquiring traits attractive to hummingbirds and among them,
   red colour of the petals which is mainly supplied by delphinidin
   3-O-rutinoside. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Hoplitis (Megachilidae: Osmiini) comprises about 360 described
   species and occurs on all continents except Australia, South America,
   and Antarctica. Using five genes, we inferred the phylogeny of Hoplitis
   including 23 out of the 27 currently recognized subgenera, applying both
   Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Compared to the current
   morphology-based classification, our phylogeny resulted in three
   classificatory changes: first, the subgenera Alcidamea, Cyrtosmia,
   Dasyosmia, Megalosmia, Monumetha, and Prionohoplitis are merged into one
   large subgenus Alcidamea Cresson, 1864, comb. nov.; second, the
   subgenera Annosmia, Bytinskia, Coloplitis, and Hoplitis are merged into
   one large subgenus Hoplitis Klug, 1807, comb. nov.; third, the subgenera
   Acrosmia, Hoplitina, Penteriades, and Proteriades are merged into one
   large subgenus Proteriades Titus, 1904, comb. nov. We provide evidence
   that the genus Hoplitis has a Palaearctic origin and that colonization
   events to southern Africa and to the Nearctic, as well as recolonization
   events from the Nearctic to the Palaearctic occurred. The species of the
   genus Hoplitis exhibit an extraordinary diversity in nesting behaviour,
   comprising both below and above ground nesting. Parsimony mapping
   revealed that ground nesting in excavated burrows is the ancestral state
   amongst Hoplitis bees. We hypothesize that nesting biology strongly
   affected both range expansion and long-distance dispersal in Hoplitis.

Abstract = {{Fragmentation and loss of natural habitats are major threats to many bee
   species. Large, long-distance flying bees are predicted to be more
   efficient in utilizing resources and at the same time may function as
   important pollinators in a fragmented landscape. Using mark-recapture
   experiments, this study evaluates the movement of bees belonging to the
   ``large, long-tongue{''} guild in a threatened, fragmented habitat. Bee
   movement between the sampling plots was limited, despite high recapture
   proportions within the plots. A maximum likelihood model has estimated a
   high degree (60 \% of all marked bees) of site fidelity to the source
   plots and a mean traveling distance of 357 m for the bees that left the
   plots. Additional observations on the bees' foraging behavior suggest
   that some anthophorine bee species can be important pollinators in the
   studied habitat. We suggest that the bees' site fidelity and flower
   constancy are the main causes for their observed conservative movement
   pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Trapline foraging (repeated sequential visits to a series of feeding
   locations) has often been observed in animals collecting floral
   resources. Past experiments have shown that bumble bees cannot always
   develop accurate (i.e., repeatable) traplines to a sufficient level,
   despite their economic advantages in many situations. The bees'
   preference for short flights works against developing accurate traplines
   when plants or patches are distributed in zigzag fashion. How should
   bees cope with such situations in nature? We conducted laboratory
   experiments with artificial flowers to test 2 nonexclusive hypotheses:
   bees may travel faster to compensate for low traplining accuracy, and
   when local landmarks are available, bees may be able to develop
   traplines by remembering external spatial information in addition to the
   locations of flowers. As predicted, foragers on a zigzag-shaped floral
   array traveled faster, with lower route repeatability, than those on a
   triangular lattice where distance and angle could be chosen
   independently, suggesting that bees trade-off accuracy for speed when it
   is more feasible. In contrast, bees traveled more slowly with unchanged
   traplining accuracy when landmarks were added into both arrays, possibly
   because the landmarks caused information load or visual distraction.
   Finally, bees on the zigzag array with additional landmarks made a
   quicker decision to switch from accurate traplining to fast traveling.
   If landmarks helped the bees to grasp the overall array geometry in our
   experiments, they may also permit bees in nature to select a
   distribution of plants or patches that aids accurate traplining.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of flower-visiting animals to floral density can alter
   interactions between plants, influencing a variety of biological
   processes, including plant population dynamics and the evolution of
   flowering phenology. Many studies have found effects of floral or plant
   density on pollinator visitation rates at patch scales, but little is
   known about responses of flower visitors to floral densities at larger
   scales. Here, I present data from an observational field study in which
   I measured the effects of floral density on visitation to the annual
   composite Holocarpha virgata at both patch (4 m(2)) and site (12.6 ha)
   spatial scales. The species composition of flower visitors changed with
   floral density, and did so in different ways at the two scales. At the
   site scale, average floral density within patches of H. virgata or
   within patches of all summer-flowering species combined had a
   significant positive effect on per-flowerhead visitation by the
   long-horned bee Melissodes lupina and no significant effects on
   visitation by any other taxa. At the patch scale, per-flowerhead
   visitation by honeybees significantly increased whereas visitation by M.
   lupina often decreased with increasing floral density. For both species,
   responses to patch-scale floral density were strongest when site-scale
   floral density was high. The scale-dependence of flower visitor
   responses to floral density and the interactions between site- and
   patch-scale effects of floral density observed in this study underscore
   the importance of improving our understanding of pollinators' responses
   to floral density at population scales.}},

Abstract = {{Pedicularis rex, a self-compatible alpine herb, depends exclusively on
   pollinators for reproduction. Previous study has revealed that 74.7 \%
   of genetic variability occurs among populations in Yunnan, indicating a
   mixed mating system for the species. The large floral display also
   indicates high potential geitonogamy. Therefore, plant density and
   display size may be important factors influencing the realized mating
   system of P. rex. In the study reported here we explored the effects of
   plant density and floral display size on pollinator movements and thus
   outcrossing rate in two patches of in P. rex at low and high plant
   densities. We examined foraging behavior of bumblebees, measured
   reproductive outputs under hand and natural pollination, and estimated
   the outcrossing rates using RAPD markers. Floral display size was
   significantly larger and bumblebees visited significantly more flowers
   in sequence on individual plants in the sparse patch than in the dense
   patch. We found a significant positive correlation between floral
   display size and successive visits in the sparse patch, but not in the
   dense patch. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse
   correlation between fruit production and flower production per plant
   with a theoretical maximum of 63 fruits per plant, but no relationship
   between seed production and flower production per plant. Contrary to
   previous studies on genetic structure, however, we found an unexpectedly
   high outcrossing rate in both the sparse and the dense patch (t (m) =
   1.151 and 0.924, respectively). Resource limitation may intensify seed
   competition and result in selected seed abortion, which may largely
   explain the unexpectedly high outcrossing rate.}},

Title = {{Sterile flowers increase pollinator attraction and promote female
   success in the Mediterranean herb Leopoldia comosa}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{103-111}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Large floral displays have opposing consequences for animal-pollinated
   angiosperms: they attract more pollinators but also enable elevated
   among-flower self-pollination (geitonogamy). The presence of sterile
   flowers as pollinator signals may enhance attraction while allowing
   displays of fewer open fertile flowers, limiting geitonogamy. The
   simultaneous contributions of fertile and non-fertile display components
   to pollinator attraction and reproductive output remain undetermined.
   The simultaneous effects of the presence of sterile flowers and
   fertile-flower display size in two populations of Leopoldia comosa were
   experimentally assessed. Pollinator behaviour, pollen removal and
   deposition, and fruit and seed production were compared between intact
   plants and plants with sterile flowers removed.
   The presence of sterile flowers almost tripled pollinator attraction,
   supplementing the positive effect of the number of fertile flowers on
   the number of bees approaching inflorescences. Although attracted bees
   visited more flowers on larger inflorescences, the number visited did
   not additionally depend on the presence of sterile flowers. The presence
   of sterile flowers improved all aspects of plant performance, the
   magnitude of plant benefit being context dependent. During weather
   favourable to pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers increased
   pollen deposition on stigmas of young flowers, but this difference was
   not evident in older flowers, probably because of autonomous
   self-pollination in poorly visited flowers. Total pollen receipt per
   stigma decreased with increasing fertile display size. In the population
   with more pollinators, the presence of sterile flowers increased fruit
   number but not seed set or mass, whereas in the other population sterile
   flowers enhanced seeds per fruit, but not fruit production. These
   contrasts are consistent with dissimilar cross-pollination and
   autonomous self-pollination, coupled with the strong predispersal
   inbreeding depression exhibited by L. comosa populations.
   Sterile flowers enrich pollination quality by promoting pollen export
   and import, while limiting the mating costs of geitonogamy associated
   with large fertile displays.}},

Abstract = {{Native vegetation is frequently replaced by alien plants on isolated
   oceanic islands. The effects of such replacements by invasive plants on
   the diversity and temporal dynamics of island-endemic insects remain
   unclear. We examined flying insect communities using Malaise traps on
   the small island of Nishi-jima in the oceanic Ogasawara Archipelago in
   the northwestern Pacific. On the island, an alien tree, Casuarina
   equisetifolia, has become dominant, occupying 57.3 \% of the vegetation
   area. The species richness, composition, and abundance of pollinators
   (bees), predators (wasps), and wood-boring beetles (cerambycids,
   mordellids, and elaterids) were compared in each summer season of 4
   years among three vegetation types: C. equisetifolia forest, natural
   forest, and grassland. In the traps, 82.3 \% of species captured were
   endemic to the archipelago. The grassland harbored the highest species
   richness of native bees and wasps, whereas the natural forest had the
   highest species richness of native wood-boring beetles. The C.
   equisetifolia forest had the poorest species richness for most insect
   groups. Principal response curves indicated that differences in species
   composition among the three vegetation types were consistent through
   time for all insect groups. Most insect species were more abundant in
   natural forest or grassland than in C. equisetifolia forest. Standard
   deviations in both the numbers of individuals and species estimated
   under a Bayesian framework suggested that annual fluctuations of
   abundance and species density were similar among vegetation types
   (except for elaterid abundance). Therefore, replacement by C.
   equisetifolia has likely altered insect species composition but has not
   necessarily dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of insect
   assemblages on the island.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees, particularly Trigona spinipes, are important pollinators
   in tropical ecosystems and are potentially affected by environmental
   contaminants. In this study, we tested the possible negative effects on
   T. spinipes larvae of the ingestion of a diet contaminated with Cry1Ac
   Bt-toxin. This toxin is expressed in genetically modified cotton plants.
   A method of rearing stingless bee larvae is described in this paper. The
   larvae were provided with either pure larval diet, diluted larval diet,
   or larval diet diluted in a Cry1Ac solution compatible with the lethal
   pest-exposure level (50 mu g/mL). Cry1Ac ingestion did not impair the
   development of worker larvae, but the diluted diet slightly increased
   larval mortality. These results indicate that harmful effects on
   stingless bee larvae due to the ingestion of pollen-expressed Cry1Ac
   toxin are unlikely under field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In tropical dry and hot forests, flower-visiting bees are able to forage
   only during the few hours a day with mild temperatures, but they may
   chose more freely among the plant species to be visited. Therefore, we
   tested the hypothesis that the overlap in temporal niches should be
   higher than the overlap in trophic niches among these bees. Between
   pairs of species (Schoener index), the overlap in trophic niches varied
   from 0.007 to 0.745, whereas the temporal overlap varied from 0.062 to
   0.865. In general, the trophic overlap was low, with 79 \% of the
   species pairs scoring below 30 \%, and the temporal overlap varied from
   moderate to high. At the community level, the observed overlap in
   trophic niches was higher than expected by chance, both for diet and
   foraging time. The network analysis confirmed at the community level
   that bees separate more strongly their trophic (E = 0.82) than their
   temporal niches (E = 0.50).}},

Abstract = {{Bees are extraordinarily diverse with respect to host plant choice and
   adaptation. Recent findings suggest that bee host range might be largely
   governed by evolutionary constraints related to pollen digestion or
   flower recognition and handling. In the present study, we applied
   phylogenetic inference to investigate whether such constraints underlie
   host plant choice in bees of the Annosmia-Hoplitis group (Megachilidae)
   and to what extent these bees have evolved specialized adaptations for
   pollen collection. We demonstrate that most pollen specialist species
   exclusively exploit either Boraginaceae or Fabaceae, whereas all pollen
   generalists harvest pollen from both Boraginaceae and Fabaceae. The
   counterintuitive affinity towards these two plant families, which are
   neither closely related nor share similar flower morphologies,
   demonstrates that pollen host choice is considerably constrained in this
   group of bees. We hypothesize that this Boraginaceae-Fabaceae paradox
   might be the result of (1) similar secondary metabolites in the pollen
   of both families; (2) metabolites that can be detoxified by the same
   physiological tools; or (3) similar pollen nutrient composition.
   Contrary to the widely held belief that specialized adaptations for
   pollen collection are rare among bees, such adaptations are common in
   the Annosmia-Hoplitis bees, where they have evolved several times
   independently to exploit flowers of widely different morphologies. (c)

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between oil-collecting bees and oil-producing flowers are a
   very specialized mutualism, whose natural history is well known at the
   organism and population levels. In this study, we assessed these
   interactions at the biome level with a network approach, and
   hypothesized that widespread bee and plant species would occupy
   different ecological functional roles (Eltonian niches) in different
   biomes. Furthermore, we expected the most important functional roles in
   each network to be occupied more frequently by Byrsonima oil flowers and
   Centris oil bees, which share the longest coevolutionary history in the
   Neotropics. By compiling data from 40 articles on oil flower
   interactions within the Malpighiaceae family, we built six networks for
   different Brazilian biomes. We assessed the ecological functional role
   of each species in pollination networks of oil flowers through the
   metric known as `network functional role'. Although 90 percent of the
   species occupied peripheral roles in each network, some were found to
   occupy highly central roles. Oil flowers of the genera Byrsonima and
   Banisteriopsis and oil bees of the genera Centris and Epicharis were the
   most important species in all networks, as they made a disproportionally
   high number of interactions (hubs), or helped bind together different
   modules (connectors). Our findings suggest that functional roles vary
   geographically and seem to be affected by local conditions in different
   biomes. Furthermore, coevolutionary history seems to play an important
   role in determining functional roles in oil flower networks, although

Abstract = {{Growing concern about the influence of climate change on flowering
   plants, pollinators, and the mutualistic interactions between them has
   led to a recent surge in research. Much of this research has addressed
   the consequences of warming for phenological and distributional shifts.
   In contrast, relatively little is known about the physiological
   responses of plants and insect pollinators to climate warming and, in
   particular, how these responses might affect plant-pollinator
   interactions. Here, we summarize the direct physiological effects of
   temperature on flowering plants and pollinating insects to highlight
   ways in which plant and pollinator responses could affect floral
   resources for pollinators, and pollination success for plants,
   respectively. We also consider the overall effects of these responses on
   plant-pollinator interaction networks. Plant responses to warming, which
   include altered flower, nectar, and pollen production, could modify
   floral resource availability and reproductive output of pollinating
   insects. Similarly, pollinator responses, such as altered foraging
   activity, body size, and life span, could affect patterns of pollen flow
   and pollination success of flowering plants. As a result, network
   structure could be altered as interactions are gained and lost, weakened
   and strengthened, even without the gain or loss of species or temporal
   overlap. Future research that addresses not only how plant and
   pollinator physiology are affected by warming but also how responses
   scale up to affect interactions and networks should allow us to better
   understand and predict the effects of climate change on this important
   ecosystem service.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{360-369}},
Abstract = {{Sympatric and taxonomically related species may present pre- and/or
   postzygotic mechanisms for reproductive isolation. We compared the
   phenology and reproductive biology of Byrsonima intermedia and B.
   pachyphylla, two sympatric Malpighiaceae species, growing in a remnant
   of Cerrado in Central Brazil. Both species are evergreens and do not
   have an overlapping flowering period. In both species, dispersal occurs
   during the rainy season with low and intermediate overlap in the
   production of immature and mature fruits, respectively. Both species
   exhibit self-incompatibility (SI), or, in the case of B. intermedia,
   facultative SI, and, hence, depend on pollinators to compensate for the
   lack of spontaneous self-pollination. The flowers of the Byrsonima
   species were visited by fifteen species of bees that collected pollen
   and/or oil. Based on their more appropriate intrafloral posture,
   Epicharis flava and Centris varia were the main pollinators of both
   species, presenting more frequent visits and/or exhibiting trapline
   foraging behavior, tending to promote outcrossing. Temporal variation in
   flowering period and total or partial self-incompatibility seem to
   function as prezygotic isolation mechanisms that form barriers to gene
   flow between the studied species and probably avoid competition among
   pollinators. Both species make oil and pollen available to flower
   visitors and pollinators almost the entire year, but since Byrsonima
   intermedia has a long flowering time and is very abundant in the study
   area, it seems to be more important in maintaining flower-visiting bees.

Title = {{Interaction between oil-collecting bees and seven species of
   Plantaginaceae}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{401-411}},
Abstract = {{Oil-bee/oil-flower mutualism evolved through multiple gains and losses
   of the ability to produce floral oil in plants and to collect it in
   bees. Around 2000 plant species are known to produce floral oils that
   are collected by roughly `450 bee species, which use them for the
   construction of nests and for the larval food. The Plantaginaceae
   contain several Neotropical species that produce floral oils, the main
   reward offered by these plants. In the genera Angelonia, Basistemon,
   Monopera and Monttea, mainly associated with Centris bees, the floral
   oil is produced in trichomes that are located in the inner corolla. The
   pollinators of a few species in this neotropical clade of Plantaginaceae
   are known, and the role of flower morphology as well as the requirements
   from pollinators and the role of other groups of bees in the pollination
   of these flowers remains unclear. In this paper we provide a list of the
   flower visitors of seven Plantaginaceae species (six Angelonia species
   and Basistemon silvaticus) analyzing their behavior to highlight the
   legitimate pollinators and illustrating little known aspects of flower
   morphology and oil-collecting apparatuses of the bees. Two general
   morphological patterns were observed in the Angelonia flowers: deep
   corolla tube with short lobes, and short corolla tube with long lobes.
   Corolla tubes of different length result in pollen adherence to
   different parts of the insect body. The six Angelonia species and B.
   silvaticus flowers were visited by 25 oil-collecting bee species (10
   Centris, 11 Tapinotaspidini and 4 Tetrapedia species), the majority
   acting as legitimate visitors. The flowers were also visited by
   illegitimate bee pollinators, which collected pollen but do not transfer
   it to the female organ. Specialized collectors of Plantaginaceae floral
   oils present modifications on the first pair of legs, mainly in the
   basitarsi but also extended to the tarsomeres. The new records of
   Tapinotaspidini and Centridini species acting as specialized pollinators
   of Plantaginaceae suggest that there is a geographic variation in the
   pollinators of the same plant species, and that the evolutionary
   scenario of the historical relationships between oil-collecting bees and
   floral oil producing plants is more complex than previously considered.

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{10-12}},

Abstract = {{The effects of floral herbivores on floral traits may result in
   alterations in pollinator foraging behaviour and subsequently influence
   plant reproductive success. Fed-upon plants may have evolved mechanisms
   to compensate for herbivore-related decreased fecundity. We conducted a
   series of field experiments to determine the relative contribution of
   floral herbivores and pollinators to female reproductive success in an
   alpine herb, Pedicularis gruina, in two natural populations over two
   consecutive years. Experimental manipulations included bagging, hand
   supplemental, geitonogamous pollination, and simulated floral herbivory.
   Bumblebees not only avoided damaged flowers and plants but also
   decreased successive visits of flowers in damaged plants, and the latter
   may reduce the level of geitonogamy. Although seed set per fruit within
   damaged plants was higher than that in intact plants, total seed number
   in damaged plants was less than that in intact plants, since floral
   herbivory-mediated pollinator limitation led to a sharp reduction of
   fruit set. Overall, the results suggest that resource reallocation
   within inflorescences of damaged plants may partially compensate for a
   reduction in seed production. Additionally, a novel finding was the
   decrease in successive within-plant bumblebee visits following floral
   herbivory. This may increase seed quantity and quality of P. gruina
   since self-compatible species exhibit inbreeding depression. The
   patterns of compensation of herbivory and its consequences reported in
   this study give an insight into the combined effects of interactions
   between floral herbivory and pollination on plant reproductive fitness.

Journal = {{GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{3444-3454}},
Abstract = {{Bees play a key role in pollination and thereby help maintain plant
   diversity. The stingless bee Melipona scutellaris is an important
   pollinator in northeastern Brazil because it is endemic to this region.
   Both deforestation and timber harvesting have reduced the nesting sites
   for this species, thus reducing its population and range. Genetic
   studies may help reverse this process by providing important tools for
   their proper management with a view to conservation of this species.
   Microsatellite markers have proven to be ideal for mapping genes and
   population genetic studies. Our aim was to study, using microsatellite
   markers, the interpopulation genetic variability of M. scutellaris in
   different parts of the Reconcavo region in Bahia State, Brazil. In all,
   95 adult workers from 11 localities in Reconcavo Baiano (Amargosa,
   Cabaceiras do Paraguacu, Conceicao da Feira, Conceicao do Almeida,
   Domingos Macedo Costa, Governador Mangabeira, Jaguaripe, Jiquirica,
   Maragojipe, Sao Felipe, and Vera Cruz) were analyzed using 10 pairs of
   microsatellite primers developed for different Meliponini species. The
   total number of alleles, allele richness, and genetic diversity ranged
   from 2 to 7 per locus (average = 4.4), 1.00 to 4.88, and 0.0 to 0.850,
   respectively. The expected and observed heterozygosities varied from 0.0
   to 0.76 and 0.0 to 0.84, respectively. No locus showed deviation from
   the expected frequencies in the chi-square test or linkage
   disequilibrium. The fixation index, analysis of molecular variance, and
   unweighted pair-group method using the arithmetic average revealed the
   effects of human activities on the populations of M. scutellaris, as
   little genetic structure was detected.}},

   sampled pollinators in 19 fragments ranging from 0.3 to 31 ha and
   surrounded by a variety of land-use types, including forest, low-density
   suburban, and urban neighbourhoods. Pan-trapping and netting surveys
   captured 4464 bees, flies, and wasps in 138 species and 48 genera. 3.
   Contrary to expectations, overall species richness did not increase with
   fragment size. However, ground-nester abundance (not diversity) and
   cavity-nester diversity (not abundance) were higher in larger fragments,
   as expected. Floral richness and abundance did not foster pollinator
   diversity for either guild. Brood parasite responses were complex: host
   availability (ground-nesting bees) was generally important, richness and
   abundance increased in fragments with high surrounding road density, and
   abundance also increased in fragments with other habitat fragments
   nearby. 4. Responses of different nesting guilds to fragmentation may be
   related to their use of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments.
   Some common cavity nesters can nest in fences and gardens, but urban
   land use may be less hospitable for ground nesters. Brood parasites
   apparently respond both to host availability and landscape
   characteristics associated with movement among fragments. 5.
   Consideration of nesting requirements of pollinators provided some
   insight into their response to habitat loss in our analysis and should
   be considered in future studies of fragmentation impacts on pollinator
   biodiversity.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Many flowers produce ant-repellent substances that prevent ants from
   discouraging pollinator visits. When a flower's most effective
   pollinator is unaffected by predatory ants, however, flowers should
   benefit from the presence of ants that deter less effective pollinators
   from consuming resources.
   2. Behavioural assays revealed that Melastoma malabathricum flowers,
   pollinated by large carpenter bees, Xylocopa spp., produce ant
   attractants that recruit weaver ants, Oecophylla smaragdina.
   3. The presence of ants was associated with an increase in the
   reproductive success of M. malabathricum flowers. This outcome likely
   resulted from the filtering effect of ants on the community of flower
   visitors: ants deter less effective pollinators and attract Xylocopa
   bees through an indirect effect on resource depletion.
   4. Synthesis. Although plant-pollinator interactions are classified as
   mutualisms, not all flower visitors are effective pollinators, and some
   can be parasites or conditional parasites. As a result, predators that
   deter flower visitors can have positive or negative effects on plant
   fitness, depending on whether they deter all visitors or a subset of
   them, and on the relative effectiveness of deterred and undeterred
   visitors.}},

   current knowledge of the Xylocopa Latreille 1802 fauna of Turkey. Ten
   species have been recognized as occurring in Turkey. Of these, three
   species, X. valga Gerstaecker, 1872, X. violacea (Linnaeus, 1758), and
   X. iris (Christ, 1791) were common and abundant. Xylocopa olivieri
   Lepeletier, 1841 and X (Koptortosoma) pubescens Spinola, 1838 were
   moderately common, those of X. (Copoxyla) armeniaca Warncke, 1982, X.
   (Ancylocopa) parviceps Morawitz 1895, X. (Xylocopa) varentzowi Morawitz,
   1895, X. (Ctenoxylocopa) fenestrata (Fabricius, 1798), and X
   (Proxylocopa) rufa Friese, 1901 occur in restricted areas within
   Anatolia and could be accepted as rare species. Update floral
   associations and geographical distribution were included for each
   species. Field studies revealed that Xylocopa species, particularly X.
   valga, X. violacea, X. iris and X. olivieri are valuable pollinators of
   some cultivated plants, such as apple (Malus domestica Borkh), pear

   Hedgerows}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{26-32}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Habitat restoration to promote wild pollinator populations is becoming
   increasingly common in agricultural lands. Yet, little is known about
   how wild bees, globally the most important wild pollinators, use
   resources in restored habitats. We compared bee use of native and exotic
   plants in two types of restored native plant hedgerows: mature hedgerows
   (>10 years from establishment) designed for natural enemy enhancement
   and new hedgerows (=2 years from establishment) designed to enhance bee
   populations. Bees were collected from flowers using timed aerial netting
   and flowering plant cover was estimated by species using cover classes.
   At mature hedgerow sites, wild bee abundance, richness, and diversity
   were greater on native plants than exotic plants. At new sites, where
   native plants were small and had limited floral display, abundance of
   bees was greater on native plants than exotic plants; but, controlling
   for floral cover, there was no difference in bee diversity and richness
   between the two plant types. At both mature and new hedgerows, wild bees
   preferred to forage from native plants than exotic plants. Honey bees,
   which were from managed colonies, also preferred native plants at mature
   hedgerow sites but exhibited no preference at new sites. Our study shows
   that wild bees, and managed bees in some cases, prefer to forage on
   native plants in hedgerows over co-occurring weedy, exotic plants.
   Semi-quantitative ranking identified which native plants were most
   preferred. Hedgerow restoration with native plants may help enhance wild
   bee abundance and diversity, and maintain honey bee health, in
   agricultural areas.}},

Journal = {{TELOPEA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Pages = {{165-183}},
Abstract = {{Historically, only a few large flowered species in the genus Thelymitra
   were identified as obligate out-breeders. We compared floral
   presentation, pollen-pistil interactions, pollination ecology, and
   interspecific hybridization in two populations of T. macrophylla where
   its flowering periods overlapped with T. antennifera (Tenterden) and T.
   crinita (Lesmurdie) respectively. Pollen-pistil interactions were
   studied using glasshouse collections of T. crinita and T. macrophylla at
   KPBG. The number of flowers per inflorescence in T. macrophylla varied
   significantly between sites. Climatic conditions influenced flower
   opening and closing regimes differently in T. crinita vs. T.
   macrophylla. While all three Thelymitra species opened on warm, sunny
   mornings and closed by late afternoon, T. crinita at Lesmurdie was
   significantly more likely to open its perianth segments on cool days
   compared to the co-blooming, sympatric flowers of T. macrophylla. The
   floral lifespans of individual flowers of T. macrophylla and T. crinita
   were reduced significantly following application of Thelymitra pollen
   onto the stigmatic surface but were not reduced by pollinarium removal.
   Flowers of both species were self-compatible but neither species
   self-pollinated mechanically (autogamy). Fluorescence microscopy also
   showed that both species were inter-compatible. Natural rates of
   pollinarium removal by insects were low in all three species at both
   sites. Natural rates of pollen deposition on receptive stigmas were
   significantly higher in T. crinita vs. T. macrophylla but pollen
   deposition was less than 12\% in both species. Observations and
   collections of pollinators were infrequent and pollinaria vectors were
   restricted to a few polylectic, female bees in the families Apidae,
   Colletidae, and Halictidae. We found a large number of hybrids between
   T. antennifera and T. macrophylla at Tenterden but few obvious hybrids
   between T. crinita and T. macrophylla at Lesmurdie. As expected, all
   hybrids showed characteristics intermediate between their two putative
   parent species, including pollen configuration in the T. crinita x T.
   macrophylla specimens. Due to malformations of the column, the majority
   of T. antennifera x T. macrophylla flowers appeared unable to attach
   their pollinia to their respective rostella.}},

   Compared to Protected Forest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{It is a globally important challenge to meet increasing demands for
   resources and, at the same time, protect biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. Farming is usually regarded as a major threat to biodiversity
   due to its expansion into natural areas. We compared biodiversity of
   bees and wasps between heterogeneous small-scale farming areas and
   protected forest in northern coastal Belize, Central America. Malaise
   traps operated for three months during the transition from wet to dry
   season. Farming areas consisted of a mosaic of mixed crop types, open
   habitat, secondary forest, and agroforestry. Mean species richness per
   site (alpha diversity), as well as spatial and temporal community
   variation (beta diversity) of bees and wasps were equal or higher in
   farming areas compared to protected forest. The higher species richness
   and community variation in farmland was due to additional species that
   did not occur in the forest, whereas most species trapped in forest were
   also found in farming areas. The overall regional species richness
   (gamma diversity) increased by 70\% with the inclusion of farming areas.
   Our results suggest that small-scale farming systems adjacent to
   protected forest may not only conserve, but even favour, biodiversity of
   some taxonomic groups. We can, however, not exclude possible declines of
   bee and wasp diversity in more intensified farmland or in landscapes
   completely covered by heterogeneous farming systems.}},

Abstract = {{Herein we report on the nesting biology of ground-nesting Trachusa
   (Heteranthidium) larreae (Cockerell) from New Mexico and Arizona, an
   oligolege of creosote bush, Larrea tridentata (DC.) Coville
   (Zygophyllaceae). Nests are single, slanting, open burrows at the lower
   end of which are horizontal cells lined with resin collected from
   creosote bush, also the source of the orange, mealy-moist provisions.
   Eggs are placed on the surface of the provisions, and the first three
   instars remain in the same position as the eggs from which they hatched.
   The fourth instar separates its body from the provisions, and only the
   fifth (final larval) instar moves around the brood chamber while
   consuming remaining provisions and defecating prior to cocoon spinning.
   It is suggested that middorsal body tubercles and an integumental body
   vestiture of short setae and setiform spicules restricted to this instar
   are adaptations enabling the movement of the fifth instar not only of
   this species but possibly those of other Megachilinae, all of which have
   a body vestiture and presumably middorsal body tubercles.
   The cocoon is spun after most of the feces are voided. Like cocoons of
   many other Megachilidae, it bears a pronounced nipple at its anterior
   end. From its construction as well as by comparison with cocoons of
   other bee taxa, the nipple seems to serve a number of functions: it
   enables exchange between the interior air of the cocoon and the external
   ambient air; it screens out parasites and predators from attacking the
   cocoon inhabitant; and it probably regulates cell humidity.
   Eggs are briefly characterized, and three females each were found to
   have three ovarioles per ovary and to carry a single mature oocyte,
   which is classified as medium in Iwata and Sakagami's classification of
   egg/mature oocyte size relative to body size of female. The fifth
   instars (both pre- and postdefecating forms) are described and found
   similar to those of other Anthidiini.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination by sexual deception is arguably one of the most unusual
   liaisons linking plants and insects, and perhaps the most illustrative
   example of extreme floral specialization in angiosperms. While
   considerable progress has been made in understanding the floral traits
   involved in sexual deception, less is known about how this remarkable
   mimicry system might have arisen, the role of pre-adaptations in
   promoting its evolution and its extent as a pollination mechanism
   outside the few groups of plants (primarily orchids) where it has been
   described to date. In the Euro-Mediterranean region, pollination by
   sexual deception is traditionally considered to be the hallmark of the
   orchid genus Ophrys. Here, we introduce two new cases outside of Ophrys,
   in plant groups dominated by generalized, shelter-mimicking species. On
   the basis of phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral pollination
   strategies, we provide evidence for independent and bidirectional
   evolutionary transitions between generalized (shelter mimicry) and
   specialized (sexual deception) pollination strategies in three groups of
   flowering plants, and suggest that pseudocopulation has evolved from
   pre-adaptations (floral colours, shapes and odour bouquets) that
   selectively attract male pollinators through shelter mimicry. These
   findings, along with comparative analyses of floral traits (colours and
   scents), shed light on particular phenotypic changes that might have
   fuelled the parallel evolution of these extraordinary pollination
   strategies. Collectively, our results provide the first substantive
   insights into how pollination sexual deception might have evolved in the
   Euro-Mediterranean region, and demonstrate that even the most extreme
   cases of pollinator specialization can reverse to more generalized
   interactions, breaking `Cope's rule of specialization'.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss is a
   major goal of ecology. Animal-mediated pollination is an essential
   ecosystem function and service provided to mankind. However, little is
   known how pollinator diversity could affect pollination services. Using
   a substitutive design, we experimentally manipulated functional group
   (FG) and species richness of pollinator communities to investigate their
   consequences on the reproductive success of an obligate out-crossing
   model plant species, Raphanus sativus. Both fruit and seed set increased
   with pollinator FG richness. Furthermore, seed set increased with
   species richness in pollinator communities composed of a single FG.
   However, in multiple-FG communities, highest species richness resulted
   in slightly reduced pollination services compared with intermediate
   species richness. Our analysis indicates that the presence of social
   bees, which showed roughly four times higher visitation rates than
   solitary bees or hoverflies, was an important factor contributing to the
   positive pollinator diversity-pollination service relationship, in
   particular, for fruit set. Visitation rate at different daytimes, and
   less so among flower heights, varied among social bees, solitary bees
   and hoverflies, indicating a niche complementarity among these
   pollinator groups. Our study demonstrates enhanced pollination services
   of diverse pollinator communities at the plant population level and
   suggests that both the niche complementarity and the presence of
   specific taxa in a pollinator community drive this positive
   relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Floral scent attracts pollinators. We investigated the floral scent
   compounds recognized by pollinators in six Brassica crop species,
   including allogamous species with different genomes and autogamous
   species with two parental genomes and radish (Raphanus sativus).
   Biologically active compounds recognized by honeybees were screened from
   all floral compounds by combined gas chromatography-electroantennogram
   analysis and their profiles were determined by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Fourteen of the 52 compounds were active. All accessions
   had more than two active compounds, but the compounds greatly differed
   between the two genera. On the basis of similarities in whether active
   compounds were presence or absence, their amount and their composition
   ratio, we divided the Brassica accessions into three to five groups by
   cluster analyses. Most groups were composed of a mixture of allogamous
   and autogamous species sharing same genome, indicating that the
   variation depended on genome, not species. These results suggest that
   all species require pollinator visits for reproduction, despite their
   different reproductive systems. However, the inter-genus and
   intra-specific variations shown by the multiple groups within a species
   might cause different visitation frequencies by pollinators between
   genera and among accessions within a species, resulting in insufficient
   seed production in some accessions or species.}},

Abstract = {{The euglossine bee Eulaema nigrita plays an important role for the
   pollination of native and economically important plants, such as the
   sweet passion-fruit Passiflora alata. E. nigrita uniquely collects the
   nectar from the flowers of P alata, nevertheless, it needs to visit
   other plants to collect pollen, nectar and other resources for its
   survival. There are two methods to identify the species of plants used
   by bees in their diet: by direct observation of the bees in the flowers,
   and through identification of pollen grains present in brood cells,
   feces, or in the bees' body. In order to identify the other plants that
   E. nigrita visits, we analyzed samples of pollen grains removed from the
   bee's body in the course of the flowering period of P alata. Among our
   results, the flora visited by E. nigrita comprised 40 species from 32
   genera and 19 families, some of them used as a pollen source or just
   nectar. In spite of being a polyletic species, E. nigrita exhibited
   preference for some plant species with poricidal anthers. P alata which
   has high sugar concentration nectar was the main source of nectar for
   this bee in the studied area. Nonetheless, the pollinic analysis
   indicated that others nectariferous plant species are necessary to keep
   the populations of E. nigrita. Studies such as this one are important
   since they indicate supplementary pollen-nectar sources which must be
   used for the conservation of the populations of E. nigrita in crops
   neighbouring areas. In the absence of pollinators, growers are forced to
   pay for hand pollination, which increases production costs; keeping
   pollinators in cultivated areas is still more feasible to ensure sweet
   passion fruit production. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60 (4): 1553-1565. Epub 2012

Abstract = {{Geographic variation of floral reward in Calceolaria polyrhiza:
   influence of biotic and abiotic factors. The study of intraspecific
   differentiation of floral characters involved in plant-pollinator
   interaction, and of its relationship with biotic and abiotic factors is
   essential to elucidate the factors affecting biological adaptation and
   specialization. Systems involving oil-secreting plants and
   oil-collecting bees are considered one of the most specialized
   plant-pollinator mutualisms. In this study, using thin layer
   chromatography (TLC), we analyze composition of floral oils in 12
   natural populations of Calceolaria polyrhiza, a species endemic to
   Patagonia. For each sampling site we obtained data on pollinators and on
   edaphic and climatic variables. Through a Partial Least Square analysis
   (PLS) we investigated which factors best explained variation among
   populations in floral reward. Results indicate that mainly pollinators,
   but also rainfall and availability of nutrients in the soil, explain the
   variation of floral reward composition at geographic scale.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in a commercial tomato, Solanum lycopersicum
   L. (Solanaceae) greenhouse to compare the relative foraging effort and
   efficiency of two bumble bee species: Bombus impatiens Cresson, a
   species from northeastern North America, commercially reared and used
   for pollination in Mexico; and B. ephippiatus Say, a native species of
   Mexico and central America. B. ephippiatus was as efficient in
   pollination of tomatoes as B. impatiens, as indicated by all variables
   of fruit quality: fruit weight, number of seed per fruit, and maximum
   fruit diameter. The two species had similar levels of hourly and daily
   foraging activity. They had the same response to temperature
   fluctuation. Pollination rates by both species were similar and close to
   100\% throughout the sample period. However, B. impatiens showed greater
   foraging activity during the first half of the 27-d sample period,
   whereas B. ephipiatus had greater relative activity during the last
   half. This study establish that B. ephippiatus is as efficient as B.
   impatiens as a pollinator of tomatoes in greenhouses and thus a
   candidate as a managed pollinator. However, standard reliable methods
   for mass rearing of B. ephippiatus are not yet available. Such methods
   are necessary to ensure healthy colonies and optimum pollination for
   producers and will reduce the pressure for the unregulated collection of
   queens in the field and the subsequent reduction of populations of this
   species.}},

Title = {{The Immense Diversity of Floral Monosymmetry and Asymmetry Across
   Angiosperms}},
Journal = {{BOTANICAL REVIEW}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Floral monosymmetry and asymmetry are traced through the angiosperm
   orders and families. Both are diverse and widespread in angiosperms. The
   systematic distribution of the different forms of monosymmetry and
   asymmetry indicates that both evolved numerous times. Elaborate forms
   occur in highly synorganized flowers. Less elaborate forms occur by
   curvature of organs and by simplicity with minimal organ numbers.
   Elaborate forms of asymmetry evolved from elaborate monosymmetry. Less
   elaborate form come about by curvature or torsion of organs, by
   imbricate aestivation of perianth organs, or also by simplicity. Floral
   monosymmetry appears to be a key innovation in some groups (e.g.,
   Orchidaceae, Fabaceae, Lamiales), but not in others. Floral asymmetry
   appears as a key innovation in Phaseoleae (Fabaceae). Simple patterns of
   monosymmetry appear easily ``reverted{''} to polysymmetry, whereas
   elaborate monosymmetry is difficult to lose without disruption of floral
   function (e.g., Orchidaceae). Monosymmetry and asymmetry can be
   expressed at different stages of floral (and fruit) development and may
   be transient in some taxa. The two symmetries are most common in
   bee-pollinated flowers, and appear to be especially prone to develop in
   some specialized biological situations: monosymmetry, e.g., with
   buzz-pollinated flowers or with oil flowers, and asymmetry also with
   buzz-pollinated flowers, both based on the particular collection
   mechanisms by the pollinating bees. Floral monosymmetry has developed
   into a model trait in evo-devo studies, whereas floral asymmetry to date
   has not been tackled in molecular genetic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of assemblages of insects that have largely agonistic
   relationships with plants are rare compared to those that study
   mutualistic relationships between plants and animals. Flowers have
   evolved multiple defense mechanisms to protect against nectar-thieving
   ants, which may decrease plant reproductive success. We evaluated
   season-specific patterns of biodiversity as well as trophic and temporal
   niche overlap for flower-visiting ants in the Brazilian Caatingas (dry
   scrub, tropical vegetation). Ant richness and evenness did not vary with
   season: however, Shannon diversity and Berger Parker dominance were
   greater and lower, respectively, during the green season compared to the
   dry season. Trophic overlap was greater during the dry season than the
   green season. In contrast, temporal overlap was greater during the green
   season than the dry season. The most common flower-visiting ant
   (Camponotus blandus) exhibited season specific trophic and temporal
   niches. Flower-visiting ants exhibited seasonal complementarity, but
   within seasons species exhibited both trophic and temporal overlap,
   suggesting that competition for floral resources is not a strong
   structuring force in this guild. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of very few Chloraeinae orchids has been studied
   to date, and most of these studies have focused on breeding systems and
   fruiting success. Chloraea membranacea Lindl. is one of the few
   non-Andean species in this group, and the aim of the present
   contribution is to elucidate the pollination biology, functional floral
   morphology and breeding system in native populations of this species
   from Argentina (Buenos Aires) and Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul State).
   Floral features were examined using light microscopy, and scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy. The breeding system was studied by
   means of controlled pollinations applied to plants, either bagged in the
   field or cultivated in a glasshouse. Pollination observations were made
   on natural populations, and pollinator behaviour was recorded by means
   of photography and video.
   Both Argentinean and Brazilian plants were very consistent regarding all
   studied features. Flowers are nectarless but scented and anatomical
   analysis indicates that the dark, clavate projections on the adaxial
   labellar surface are osmophores (scent-producing glands). The plants are
   self-compatible but pollinator-dependent. The fruit-set obtained through
   cross-pollination and manual self-pollination was almost identical. The
   main pollinators are male and female Halictidae bees that withdraw the
   pollinarium when leaving the flower. Remarkably, the bees tend to visit
   more than one flower per inflorescence, thus promoting self-pollination
   (geitonogamy). Fruiting success in Brazilian plants reached 6078 in 2010
   and 46 in 2011. Some pollinarium-laden female bees were observed
   transferring pollen from the carried pollinarium to their hind legs. The
   use of pollen by pollinators is a rare record for Orchidaceae in
   general.
   Chloraea membrancea is pollinated by deceit. Together,
   self-compatibility, pollinarium texture, pollinator abundance and
   behaviour may account for the observed high fruiting success. It is
   suggested that a reappraisal and re-analysis of important flower
   features in Chloraeinae orchids is necessary.}},

Journal = {{ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{561-569}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The antibiotic hypothesis proposes that ant pollination is rare at least
   in part because the cuticular antimicrobial secretions of ants are toxic
   to pollen grains. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the effects of
   ants and bees on pollen in two regions: a tropical rainforest in
   Amazonian Peru and temperate forests and old fields in Canada. We found
   support for three predictions that follow from the antibiotic
   hypothesis. (1) For all 10 ant and 11 plant species in our study,
   contact with ants significantly reduced pollen germination, confirming
   the generality of this effect. (2) Contact with two bee species did not
   have similar effects; pollen exposed to bees germinated as well as
   control pollen. (3) Consistent with the presumed greater abundance of
   entomopathogens in the tropics, which may have selected for stronger
   antibiotic secretions in tropical ants, tropical ants had more negative
   effects on pollen than temperate ants. We speculate that the antibiotic
   hypothesis contributes not only to the rarity but also to the
   biogeography of ant pollination, and we discuss whether the negative
   effects of ants on pollen have resulted in selection for floral defenses
   against ants.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are an important group of wild pollinators in North America
   and considerable concern has been expressed over declines in their
   populations. However, before causes for declines can be assessed, it is
   essential that the geographical and chronological patterns of decline be
   discovered. Hitherto a lack of assessment of historical data has
   hindered our efforts to determine which species are most at risk. Here,
   the status of 21 North American bumble bee species (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   occurring in the eastern nearctic biogeographic region is assessed using
   a specimen-level database from compiled museum and survey records dating
   back to the late nineteenth century from various institutional
   collections. Using a combination of measures, bumble bee declines were
   assessed over their entire native ranges. We report here that half of
   the selected fauna is in varying levels of decline (especially Bombus
   ashtoni, B. fervidus, and B. variabilis), with the remaining species
   exhibiting stable or increasing trends (e.g., B. bimaculatus, B.
   impatiens, and B. rufocinctus). Suggestions for prioritizing
   conservation efforts for this important group of pollinators are given.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},

Pages = {{1373-1383}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As cropland increases, fields become progressively isolated from
   pollinators, leading to declines in pollinator-dependent crop
   productivity. With the rise in demand for pollinator-dependent foods,
   such productivity losses may accelerate conversion of natural areas to
   cropland. Pollinationcompensation measures involving managed pollinators
   or hand pollination are not always optimal or are too costly.
   Introducing areas of native vegetation within cropland has been proposed
   as a way to supplement crop pollinators, but this measure is perceived
   by farmers to carry costs outweighing benefits to agricultural
   production. Studies quantifying benefits of small patches of native
   flowers to crop pollination are therefore necessary to encourage such
   practices. To ascertain whether provision of floral resources within
   farmlands can facilitate pollination, and hence, crop yields, small
   experimental patches of perennial native plants (native flower
   compensation areas, NFCAs) were created in nonproductive areas of large
   commercial fields of several cultivars of mango Mangifera indica.
   Pesticide use and isolation from natural habitat were associated with
   declines in flying visitors and in mango production (kg of marketable
   fresh fruit), but presence of NFCAs ameliorated these declines, and
   NFCAs did not harbour any mango pests. In areas far from natural
   vegetation, orchards near NFCAs had significantly higher diversity and
   abundance of mango flying visitors, as well as mango production, than
   orchards far from NFCAs, although these measures were still lower than
   in orchards close to natural areas. Neither the most abundant flower
   visitors to mango (ants) nor initial fruit set was significantly
   affected by distance, pesticides or NFCAs, suggesting that although
   fertilization is associated with factors unaffected by isolation from
   natural habitat and pesticide use (i.e. self- and ant-pollination),
   viable fruit set (and ultimately, production) requires
   cross-pollination, for which flying visitors are essential. Synthesis
   and applications. Our results show that the presence of small patches of
   native flowers within large farms can increase pollinator-dependent crop
   production if combined with preservation of remaining fragments of
   natural habitat and judicious use of pesticides. Native flower
   compensation areas represent a profitable management measure for
   farmers, increasing cost-effectiveness of cropland while indirectly
   contributing to preservation of natural habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The response of insects to monoculture plantations has mainly proceeded
   at the expense of natural forest areas, and is an outstanding and
   important issue in ecology and conservation biology, with pollination
   services declined around the world. In this study, species richness and
   distribution of hoverfly and wild bee communities were investigated in a
   changing tropical landscape in southern Yunnan, south-west China by
   Malaise traps periodically from 2008 to 2009. Species were recorded from
   the traditional land use types (natural forest, grassland, shrubland and
   rice field fallows), and from recently established rubber plantations of
   different ages. Hoverflies (total 53 species) were most common in young
   successional stages of vegetation, including rice field fallow and
   shrubland. Species richness was highest in rice field fallows and lowest
   in forests and showed a highly significant relationship with the number
   of forb species and ground vegetation cover. In contrast, the highest
   richness of wild bees (total 44 species) was recorded from the natural
   forest sites, which showed a discrete bee community composition compared
   to the remaining habitat types. There was no significant relationship
   between the bee species richness and the environmental variables,
   including the numbers of different plant life forms, coverage of canopy
   and ground vegetation, successional age of vegetation and land use type.
   At the landscape scale, open land use systems, including young rubber
   plantations, are assumed to increase the species richness of hoverflies;
   however, this might decrease wild bee diversity. The present land use
   change by rubber cultivation can be expected to have negative impacts on
   the native wild bee communities.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Biogeography has been difficult to apply as a methodological approach
   because organismic biology is incomplete at levels where the process of
   formulating comparisons and analogies is complex. The study of insect
   biogeography became necessary because insects possess numerous
   evolutionary traits and play an important role as pollinators. Among
   insects, the euglossine bees, or orchid bees, attract interest because
   the study of their biology allows us to explain important steps in the
   evolution of social behavior and many other adaptive tradeoffs. We
   analyzed the distribution of morphological characteristics in Colombian
   orchid bees from an ecological perspective. The aim of this study was to
   observe the distribution of these attributes on a regional basis. Data
   corresponding to Colombian euglossine species were ordered with a
   correspondence analysis and with subsequent hierarchical clustering.
   Later, and based on community proprieties, we compared the resulting
   hierarchical model with the collection localities to seek to identify a
   biogeographic classification pattern. From this analysis, we derived a
   model that classifies the territory of Colombia into 11 biogeographic
   units or natural clusters. Ecological assumptions in concordance with
   the derived classification levels suggest that species characteristics
   associated with flight performance, nectar uptake, and social behavior
   are the factors that served to produce the current geographical
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are assumed to play a key role in ecosystem functioning through
   their effects on seed set, seed consumption, seed dispersal, and
   maintenance of plant communities. However, there are no studies
   investigating the consequences of animal scarcity on seed set, seed
   consumption and seed dispersal at large geographical scales. We
   exploited the unprecedented scarcity of pollinating bumblebees and
   butterflies in the vicinity of Chernobyl, Ukraine, linked to the effects
   of radiation on pollinator abundance, to test for effects of pollinator
   abundance on the ecosystem. There were considerably fewer pollinating
   insects in areas with high levels of radiation. Fruit trees and bushes
   (apple Malus domestica, pear Pyrus communis, rowan Sorbus aucuparia,
   wild rose Rosa rugosa, twistingwood Viburnum lantana, and European
   cranberry bush Viburnum opulus) that are all pollinated by insects
   produced fewer fruit in highly radioactively contaminated areas, partly
   linked to the local reduction in abundance of pollinators. This was the
   case even when controlling for the fact that fruit trees were generally
   smaller in more contaminated areas. Fruit-eating birds like thrushes and
   warblers that are known seed dispersers were less numerous in areas with
   lower fruit abundance, even after controlling for the effects of
   radiation, providing a direct link between radiation, pollinator
   abundance, fruit abundance and abundance of frugivores. Given that the
   Chernobyl disaster happened 25 years ago, one would predict reduced
   local recruitment of fruit trees if fruit set has been persistently
   depressed during that period; indeed, local recruitment was negatively
   related to the level of radiation and positively to the local level of
   fruit set. The patterns at the level of trees were replicated at the
   level of villages across the study site. This study provides the first
   large-scale study of the effects of a suppressed pollinator community on
   ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid species of Mediterranean genus Serapias often live in sympatry,
   exhibit similar floral morphology, bloom in the same period and share
   the same pollinators. Previous studies on Serapias species have
   ascertained that reproductive isolation is based on pre-pollination
   barriers, that secretory cells and trichomes are typically distributed
   on the floral labellum and that flowers produce aliphatic compounds. In
   this study we compare the floral scent composition of four widespread,
   co-occurring Serapias species, namely Serapias lingua, Serapias
   parviflora, Serapias vomeracea and Serapias cordigera. Our goals are to
   assess if differences in floral scent may act as interspecific
   pre-pollination barriers and if these olfactory signals may be involved
   in the pollination strategy of Serapias. We find that all the selected
   species produce C20-C29 alkanes and alkenes and, in addition, have
   detected the presence in S. cordigera of large amounts of oleate and
   stearate ethyl ester. Our findings help to clarify that the sympatric
   Serapias species have slightly different floral scent signatures that
   may account for their relevant role as pre-pollination barriers.
   Therefore, the pollination strategy of Serapias relies not only on the
   tubular shape of their floral corolla but also on the production of
   olfactory signals that may lure potential pollinators and even assure a
   sufficient degree of pollinator fidelity.}},

Abstract = {{Sexually deceptive orchids mimic signals emitted by female insects in
   order to attract mate-searching males. Specific attraction of the
   targeted pollinator is achieved by sex pheromone mimicry, which
   constitutes the major attraction channel. In close vicinity of the
   flower, visual signals may enhance attraction, as was shown recently in
   the sexually deceptive orchid Ophrys heldreichii. Here, we conducted an
   in situ manipulation experiment in two populations of O. heldreichii on
   Crete to investigate whether the presence/absence of the conspicuous
   pink perianth affects reproductive success in two natural orchid
   populations. We estimated reproductive success of three treatment groups
   (with intact, removed and artificial perianth) throughout the flowering
   period as pollinaria removal (male reproductive success) and massulae
   deposition (female reproductive success). Reproductive success was
   significantly increased by the presence of a strong visual signal-the
   conspicuous perianth-in one study population, however, not in the
   second, most likely due to the low pollinator abundance in the latter
   population. This study provides further evidence that the coloured
   perianth in O. heldreichii is adaptive and thus adds to the olfactory
   signal to maximise pollinator attraction and reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{The halictid bees are excellent models for the study of social evolution
   because greater social diversity and plasticity are observed in the
   tribe Halictini than in any other comparable taxonomic group. We examine
   the evolutionary relationships within the subfamily Halictinae
   ({''}sweat bees{''}) to investigate the origins of social behaviour
   within the tribe Halictini. We present a new phylogeny of the subfamily
   Halictinae based on three nuclear genes (elongation factor-1 alpha,
   wingless, and long-wavelength rhodopsin) and one mitochondrial gene
   (cytochrome c oxidase 1) sequenced for 206 halictine bees. We use
   model-based character reconstruction to infer the probability of a
   shared eusocial ancestor for the genera Halictus and Lasioglossum, the
   two genera of Halictini which display eusociality. Our results suggest a
   high probability for a single origin of eusociality for these two
   genera, contradicting earlier views of separate origins within each
   taxon. Fossil-calibrated divergence estimates place this ancestor at
   approximately 35 million years ago, about 14 million years earlier than
   previous estimates of eusocial origins in the halictid bees. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The stingless bees are important flowers visitors of several plant
   species, due to their feeding habits and foraging behavior, constituting
   an important group to maintain biodiversity and the dynamics of tropical
   communities. Among stingless bees, Tetragonisca angustula is widely
   distributed in tropical habitats, and has been considered an important
   pollinator of different plant families. To support a rational economic
   use of this group, there is a need to characterize the plant species
   that represent important sources as part of their diet, as preferred,
   alternative or casual food sources. The aim of this survey was to
   distinguish the plant species that T angustula visited most often. The
   study was undertaken in four regions of the Atlantic Rainforest in Rio
   de Janeiro state (Brazil) over a year from March 2008 to February 2009.
   For this, we collected bees, flowering plants and bee pollen loads from
   the four sites, and evaluated pollen morphology in the laboratory. Field
   observations showed the presence of plants belonging to ten different
   families and pollen loads showed the presence of pollen types belonging
   to 26 plant families. There were strong differences between pollen
   types, especially regarding pollen grain shape. The present survey
   suggests a high value of these plant species as trophic resources for
   the T angustula in the understory of Atlantic Rainforest. Changes in
   these fragments of this forest may compromise the availability of
   resources for Tetragonisca angustula species and other stingless bees.

Abstract = {{Douglas' dustymaiden, Chaenactis douglasii (Hook.) Hook. \& Arn., is a
   widespread, inconspicuous, short-lived perennial wildflower that blooms
   in early summer and is found in basin sagesteppe to upper montane areas
   throughout the U. S. Intermountain West. The species is proving
   practical to grow for seed and is expected to be used for western
   rangeland rehabilitation. Through manual pollination experiments, C.
   douglasii was found to be only weakly self-fertile; 15\% of flowers from
   geitonogamy and autogamy treatments yielded filled achenes. In contrast,
   57\% of out-crossed flowers produced achenes filled with endosperm, with
   every capitulum yielding some fertile seeds. Freely visited flowers from
   a wild population produced 91\% fertile achenes, indicating that seed
   production was not pollinator limited. Floral visitors to C. douglasii
   were sparse, consisting entirely of bees, most of them floral
   generalists. Museum specimens of bees taken at C. douglasii and 3
   closely related congenerics comprise 175 species in 39 genera and all 6
   North American bee families. A population of the manageable mesolectic
   cavity-nesting bee, Osmia californica, when released at one sagesteppe
   site, provisioned its cells primarily with pale, spiny pollen resembling
   that of the C. douglasii growing at the site. This bee and the honey bee
   appear most promising for pollinating dustymaiden that is being farmed
   for seed.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation can have severe effects on plant pollinator
   interactions, for example changing the foraging behaviour of
   pollinators. To date, the impact of plant population size on pollen
   collection by pollinators has not yet been investigated. From 2008 to
   2010, we monitored nine bumble bee species (Bombus campestris, Bombus
   hortorum s.l., Bombus hypnorum, Bombus lapidarius, Bombus pascuorum,
   Bombus pratorum, Bombus soroensis, Bombus terrestris s.l., Bombus
   vestalis s.l.) on Vaccinium uliginosum (Ericaceae) in up to nine
   populations in Belgium ranging in size from 80 m 2 to over 3.1 ha.
   Bumble bee abundance declined with decreasing plant population size, and
   especially the proportion of individuals of large bumble bee species
   diminished in smaller populations. The most remarkable and novel
   observation was that bumble bees seemed to switch foraging behaviour
   according to population size: while they collected both pollen and
   nectar in large populations, they largely neglected pollen collection in
   small populations. This pattern was due to large bumble bee species,
   which seem thus to be more likely to suffer from pollen shortages in
   smaller habitat fragments. Comparing pollen loads of bumble bees we
   found that fidelity to V. uliginosum pollen did not depend on plant
   population size but rather on the extent shrub cover and/or openness of
   the site. Bumble bees collected pollen only from three plant species (V.
   uliginosum, Sorbus aucuparia and Cytisus scoparius). We also did not
   discover any pollination limitation of V. uliginosum in small
   populations. We conclude that habitat fragmentation might not
   immediately threaten the pollination of V. uliginosum, nevertheless, it
   provides important nectar and pollen resources for bumble bees and
   declining populations of this plant could have negative effects for its
   pollinators. The finding that large bumble bee species abandon pollen
   collection when plant populations become small is of interest when
   considering plant and bumble bee conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Several barriers against hybrid formation exist,
   and their combined action can affect the evolutionary outcomes of
   hybridization. To explain the asymmetrical introgression observed
   between two bumblebee-pollinated plant species (Rhinanthus angustifolius
   and R. minor), we focused on post-pollination barriers and ethological
   isolation of hybrids.
   Methods: We studied pollen competition in conspecific and heterospecific
   crosses on both species and analyzed germination rates of hybrid and
   pure seeds. We also measured bumblebee visitation rates to hybrids
   relative to their parents using potted Rhinanthus placed in populations
   of each parental species.
   Key results: In mixed pollinations, there was a conspecific siring
   advantage in both species, but no difference in pollen tube growth rates
   in either cross type. F-1 seeds with a R. angustifolius maternal plant
   germinated poorly, while those with R. minor as the maternal parent
   germinated better than pure seeds. Interestingly, bumblebees treated
   hybrids almost as equal to the background species and more often
   rejected the nonresident Rhinanthus. In a R. angustifolius background,
   bumblebees preferred R. angustifolius, but visited hybrids more often
   than R. minor. In contrast, visitation rates were similar on a R. minor
   background.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that hybridization rates in Rhinanthus
   remain low because of several leaky barriers that make R. minor the
   maternal parent of most F-1 offspring. Preference for R. angustifolius
   and the equal treatment of F 1 and background species by bumblebees
   induce a visitation pattern that directs gene flow toward R.
   angustifolius when this species predominates.}},

Title = {{Incidence of Misshapen Fruits in Strawberry Plants Grown under Tunnels

Abstract = {{Misshapen fruit represent a significant problem for strawberry (Fragaria
   x ananassa Duch.) producers around the world. We investigated the effect
   of cultivar and different cropping practices on the productivity of
   strawberry plants growing in tunnels at Huelva (Spain) over three years.
   In the first experiment, `Camarosa', `Ventana', and `Medina' were
   planted on 10 or 22 Oct. at standard (30 X 25 cm), wide (35 x 25 cm), or
   narrow (25 x 25 cm) spacings. In the second experiment, `Camarosa' was
   grown in macro- or microtunnels with and without bees. There was no
   effect of plant density. Planting time resulted in higher early yields
   in `Ventana' and higher misshapen fruit in `Camarosa' with an early
   compared with a late planting. `Camarosa' had the lowest yields and the
   highest incidence of misshapen fruit. More of the early crop was
   misshaped and this was related to low temperatures in the 7 weeks before
   harvest. Pollination reduced the incidence of misshapen fruit and
   increased yield. Plants grown in macrotunnels were only more productive
   than those grown in microtunnels when they were pollinated by bees.
   These results demonstrate that the productivity of strawberry plants
   growing in tunnels can be enhanced by the selection of the appropriate
   cultivar, planting date, tunnel system, and pollination protocol. The
   use of macrotunnels with supplementary pollination results in better
   economic returns by increasing yield and decreasing the incidence of
   misshapen fruit. In addition, in some cultivars this profit can be
   enhanced by early planting, which enables early arrival of fruits into
   the markets at better prices for growers.}},

Abstract = {{Animal-pollinated plant species modulate the presentation of pollinator
   rewards to maximize reproductive success. In plants providing pollen as
   the only reward for pollinators, it is usually difficult to unravel the
   dual roles of reward presentation and the realization of male and female
   functions (pollen removal and deposition). Exploiting the two types of
   anther in the androecia of Melastoma malabathricum L., we examined
   whether the removal of pollen for reward is regulated primarily to favor
   male function or female function. Pollen removal by carpenter bees from
   the feeding and pollination anthers, as well as pollen deposition on the
   stigmas, were quantified during anthesis of M. malabathricum. There was
   no significant difference in pollen removal rates from the feeding and
   pollination anthers of M. malabathricum between the onset of anthesis
   and flower wilting. The stigmatic pollen loads exceeded the ovule number
   after three sonication bouts, and female function was satisfied earlier
   than male function. The results support the hypothesis that the
   presentation of pollination reward in this species is regulated
   primarily to favor the expression of male function, rather than female
   function, in agreement with the pollen-donation hypothesis. A
   cooperative relationship between the feeding and pollination anthers was
   demonstrated in heterantherous flowers, which optimizes the balance in
   investments between pollinator rewards and ``functional pollen{''} for
   gene transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Floral color changes are common in Weigela and the retention of
   post-change flowers has been interpreted as a mechanism to increase
   attractiveness from a long distance and shorten pollinators' lingering
   time on the inflorescence(s) of individual plants. In the present study,
   we investigated the temporal pattern of floral color change and time
   required for pollen tube growth in the shrub Weigela japonica var.
   sinica. Over the 4-day anthesis, the color of the corolla in this
   species changes from white to red and the color cue changes from yellow
   to purple. The duration of both the white phase and the intermediate
   phase is approximately 1 day and the duration of the red phase is
   approximately 2 days. Our studies showed that color change in Weigela
   japonica var. sinica is age-dependent but independent of pollinator
   visits and flower pollination. Post-change flowers lost most of both the
   male and female residual reproductive ability and retained no rewards
   for pollinators. It took at least 3 days for a pollen tube to grow to
   the ovules and achieve fertilization. Thus, retention of post-change
   flowers is necessary for the completion of pollen tube growth. Our
   results indicate that the temporal pattern of color change and time
   requirement for pollen tube growth are most likely related events.}},

Abstract = {{The nesting biology of the leafcutting bee Megachile (Pseudocentron)
   gomphrenoides Vachal (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) was studied in an
   agro-ecosystem in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Data were
   obtained from trap-nests placed in the field margin during two
   agricultural years (2008/2009 and 2009/2010). Females made an average of
   7.55 cells per nest, and used leaves of at least three plant species to
   build their nests. Provisions of cells were principally of Asteraceae
   pollen. Adult emergence showed a bimodal pattern suggesting a
   facultative bivoltinism life cycle. Approximately, 30 \% of all
   offspring failed to complete development to the adult stage and an
   additional 10 \% were killed by natural enemies. These included
   parasitic wasps (Eulophidae: Melittobia and Horismenus), a
   cleptoparasite bee (Megachilidae: Coelioxys), and a bristle beetle
   (Meloidae: Tetraonyx). The host/cleptoparasite association between M.
   gomphrenoides and Coelioxys remissa constitutes the first such record
   for both species, and the Megachile-Tetraonyx interaction was previously
   unknown. M. gomphrenoides possesses some characteristics that make it an
   interesting potential opportunity to use this species for pollination of
   commercial sunflowers in the Pampean region.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate whether flower selection in polylectic solitary bees is
   modulated by chemical imprinting to nest provisions, larvae of Osmia
   bicornis (L.) were reared on either Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae) or

   were evaluated in multiple-choice behavioral tests based on visit number
   and duration, and flowers selected in the first three visits; data were
   compared to control bees from the wild. Females reared on B. napus
   showed only subtle increases in selection for this species, which was
   highly attractive to both control and experimental bees, masking any
   effects of imprinting; however, in the first three visits, experimental
   bees tended to select B. napus more frequently and consistently than
   controls. Bees reared on O. viciifolia were few and mostly males, which
   tended to visit this species more than controls. Rearing larvae on
   either plant affected bee attraction to other plant species. Overall,
   the data do not provide clear evidence of imprinting, but suggest that
   rearing bees on a single plant can both directly and indirectly affect
   flower selection by adults.}},

Abstract = {{Beauveria bassiana ({[}Balsamo] Vuillemin {[}Ascomycota: Hypocreales]
   Botanigard 22WP (R) formulation]) shows potential as a bee-vectored
   microbial control agent for control of insect pests on greenhouse tomato
   and sweet pepper. To integrate this control strategy with existing
   beneficials used in greenhouse vegetable production, it is important to
   determine the impact of bee vectored Beauveria on commonly used
   biocontrol agents in greenhouse crops. Therefore, greenhouse trials were
   conducted to investigate the impact of bee-vectored B. bassiana on the
   survivorship and parasitism/predation level of Encarsia formosa Gahan
   (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), Eretmocerus eremicus Rose \& Zolnerowich
   (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae), Onus insidiosus (Say) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) and
   Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) (Acari: Phytoseiidae). Two
   treatments were evaluated: (bee-vectored inoculum {[}1.37 x 10(10)
   conidia/g of inoculum] and a control {[}bees but no inoculum D. The
   experimental design was a completely randomized block design with three
   to four replications per treatment over time. The commercial bumblebee
   pollinator, Bombus impatiens (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae), was used
   to vector the microbial control agent to the crop. Over 95\% of the
   flower and leaf samples from the tomato and sweet pepper crops contained
   detectable levels of Beauveria spores. No significant differences in
   mortalities were found between the two treatments for the parasitoid
   species and A. swirskii. Mortality for O. insidiosus was significantly
   greater in the Beauveria treatment compared to the control treatment.
   Parasitism and predation levels were not significantly different between
   to the two treatments. Also. Beauveria did not significantly impact bee
   mortality compared to the control treatment. Thus, based on the results
   presented in the current study, bee vectoring of the entomopathogen, B.
   bassiana, should be compatible with many of the beneficial arthropod
   control agents that are used in greenhouse integrated pest management.

Abstract = {{Delphinieae (Ranunculaceae) comprise; 650 species of temperate herbs in
   Eurasia, North America, and Africa. Their zygomorphic flowers have been
   the object of numerous studies in morphology, ecology, and developmental
   genetics, and new phylogenetic insights make it timely to synthesize
   knowledge about their evolution. Key features of Delphinieae flowers are
   unusual nectaries consisting of paired organs of the inner perianth
   whorl that are completely enclosed by a single dorsal organ of the outer
   whorl. We investigated the floral development of five annual,
   unicarpellate species of Delphinium, focusing on perianth organization.
   The results show that the nectar-storing organ in these species results
   from the postgenital fusion of two primordia of the internal perianth
   whorl. Eleven floral traits traced on a phylogeny of Delphinieae reveal
   only two homoplasies in the perianth, namely, the nightcap shape of the
   dorsal organ of the external perianth whorl and the reduction of the
   internal perianth whorl to two organs, traits that each evolved once in
   Aconitum and once in Delphinium. The length of the inner spur(s), the
   type of pollinator (bees, hummingbirds, hawkmoths), and species
   altitudinal ranges are unrelated, but most species are exclusively
   bumblebee adapted, and bee tongue lengths may match the internal nectar
   spur lengths. The paired inner spurs present in most Delphinieae require
   a back-and-forth movement of the tongue while the pollinator is inside
   the flower or hovering close to it. A new evolutionary scenario
   reconciles the diversity of perianth organization in Delphinieae with
   the tribe's conserved pollination mechanism.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{990-998}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As the globally dominant group of pollinators, bees provide a key
   ecosystem service for natural and agricultural landscapes. Their
   corresponding global decline thus poses an important threat to plant
   populations and the ecosystems they support. Bee conservation requires
   rapid and effective tools to identify and delineate species. Here, we
   apply DNA barcoding to Irish solitary bees as the first step towards a
   DNA barcode library for European solitary bees. Using the standard
   barcoding sequence, we were able to identify 51 of 55 species. Potential
   problems included a suite of species in the genus Andrena, which were
   recalcitrant to sequencing, mitochondrial heteroplasmy and parasitic
   flies, which led to the production of erroneous sequences from DNA
   extracts. DNA barcoding enabled the assignment of morphologically
   unidentifiable females of the parasitic genus Sphecodes to their nominal
   taxa. It also enabled correction of the Irish bee list for
   morphologically inaccurately identified specimens. However, the standard
   COI barcode was unable to differentiate the recently diverged taxa
   Sphecodes ferruginatus and S. hyalinatus. Overall, our results show that
   DNA barcoding provides an excellent identification tool for Irish
   solitary bees and should be rolled out to provide a database for
   solitary bees globally.}},

Abstract = {{Cyperaceae are characteristically anemophilous, but there are some
   reports of species re-adapted to entomophily, such as Rhynchospora
   ciliata. Our objective was to investigate: (1) the distribution pattern
   of flowers in inflorescences of Rhynchospora ciliata; (2) the dynamics
   of its anthesis; and (3) whether R. ciliata is pollinated by bees, by
   wind or by both. Additionally, we tested the hypotheses: (i) the
   hypsophylls and/or anthers attract pollinators, and (ii) biotic vectors
   enhance the reproductive success of R. ciliata. We analysed floral
   biology, dynamics of anthesis, frequency and behaviour of insects
   visiting flowers; we also carried out experiments on flower
   attractiveness, pollination by wind and reproductive success.
   Rhynchospora ciliata has flowers with anemophilous attributes, including
   anthers exposed during anthesis; however, the anthers (here considered a
   mixed trait) together with the white hypsophylls can be considered as
   attributes that favour entomophily. Both wind and four species of bee
   were considered as pollen vectors of R. ciliata. Through flower
   attractiveness tests, we observed that the hypsophylls do not affect the
   frequency of pollinating bees and that the absence of exposed anthers
   affects the average number of visits, probably because pollen is the
   only floral resource. Reproductive tests indicate that R. ciliata is
   self-incompatible and that ambophily enhances its reproductive success.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Over the years, selection can vary in intensity and direction. Selection
   on traits related to the mechanical fit with pollinators is expected to
   vary according to changes in pollinator assemblage. Provided that
   pollinators do not change over time selection on traits related to
   attraction, such as floral fragrance, is expected to be mainly affected
   by environmental conditions because its production is resource limited.
   We examined selection patterns on osmophore area (as a surrogate of
   odour production), nectary depth and flower number in the orchid
   Cyclopogon elatus during four consecutive years, and simultaneously
   recorded variations in weather conditions and differences in pollinator
   assemblages. We also studied whether the osmophore area was positively
   related to pollinator attraction and examined its possible trade-off
   with phenology. We found that patterns of selection on nectary depth did
   not vary significantly among years. This lack of temporal variation is
   consistent with the stability of a single bee species as the predominant
   pollinator. On the contrary, selection on osmophore area varied markedly
   and was negative during the driest year. Negative selection indicates
   that although pollinators visited plants with larger osmophore areas
   more frequently, it did not translate into higher fitness. Plants with
   larger osmophore areas begin to flower earlier and might be more
   affected by weather conditions, not directly due to resource
   availability but indirectly because of the lack of pollinators at the
   beginning of the flowering season.}},

Title = {{Can extinction risk help explain plant-pollinator specificity among

Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Long-term or lifetime specificity in plantpollinator relationships is
   likely a consequence of natural selection to not only enhance the
   probability of cross-pollination but also to improve pollinator
   efficiency. Dependency on one or few pollinators involves risk whereas
   multiple species may reduce the probability of extinction via unreliable
   pollinator service. We analyzed specificity in terms of factors that may
   ameliorate risk such as long-term pollinator population stability,
   abundance and the duration of flowering. Bee population stability
   indices from seven continuous years of census data, combined with
   pollinator and flowering phenology data for 37 plant species in Panama,
   revealed pollinator specificity was not related to pollinator population
   stability. No relationship existed between the length of a flowering
   season and population stability of associated pollinators. Further data
   from 30 years of euglossine monitoring also revealed no relationship
   between bee abundance and specificity. However, a strong relationship
   was revealed between length of flowering period and specificity. A
   longer flowering season was associated with lower specificity and
   shorter flowering was associated with higher specificity, which is as
   expected if specificity is the outcome of a sampling problem but not as
   expected if specificity is accompanied by risk reduction.
   Plantpollinator specificity involving euglossine bees is evidently not
   related to bee population stability, abundance, or length of flowering
   period, in a manner that we predicted would be associated with reducing
   the risk of extinction. Variation in population stabilities of
   euglossines may be insufficient to be a factor in the evolution of
   plantpollinator specificity. In the tropics, specificity may be more
   associated with plant longevity, selection for efficiency or
   effectiveness, or flowering duration as a sampling phenomenon, than with
   reducing dependence on unreliable pollinators.}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1878-1888}},

Abstract = {{Nectar-dwelling yeasts are emerging as widely distributed organisms
   playing a potentially significant and barely unexplored ecological role
   in plant pollinator mutualisms. Previous efforts at understanding
   nectarpollinatoryeast interactions have focused on bee-pollinated
   plants, while the importance of nectarivorous ants as vectors for yeast
   dispersal remains unexplored so far. Here we assess the abundance and
   composition of the nectar fungal microbiota of the ant-pollinated plant
   Cytinus hypocistis, study whether yeast transmission is coupled with ant
   visitation, and discern whether ant- transported yeasts promote changes
   in nectar characteristics. Our results show that a high percentage of
   flowers (77\%) and plants (94\%) contained yeasts, with yeast cell
   density in nectar reaching up to 6.2 x 104 cells mm-3, being the highest
   densities associated with the presence of the nectar-specialist yeast
   Metschnikowia reukaufii. The establishment of fungal microbiota in
   nectar required flower visitation by ants, with 70\% of yeast species
   transported by them being also detected in nectar. Ant-vectored yeasts
   diminished the nutritional quality of nectar, with flowers exposed to
   pollinators and yeasts containing significantly lower nectar sugar
   concentration than virgin flowers (13.4\% and 22.8\%, respectively).
   Nectar of flowers that harbored M. reukaufii showed the lowest quality,
   with nectar concentration declining significantly with increasing yeast
   density. Additionally, yeasts modified patterns of interpopulation
   variation in nectar traits, homo genizing differences between
   populations in some nectar attributes. We show for the first time that
   the outcome of the tripartite pollinatorfloweryeast interaction is
   highly dependent on the identity and inherent properties of the
   participants, even to the extent of influencing the species composition
   of this ternary system, and can be mediated by ecological
   characteristics of plant populations. Through their influence on plant
   functional traits, yeasts have the potential to alter nectar
   consumption, pollinator foraging behavior and ultimately plant
   reproduction.}},

   better visibility. When presented with Rhinanthus flowers, bumblebees
   that previously foraged on R. angustifolius were less prone to visit R.
   minor inflorescences, while R. minor foragers accepted both species in
   similar proportions. Although Rhinanthus has been cited as a case of
   mechanical isolation resulting from interactions between bee behaviour
   and differences in stigma and anther placement, we found no support for
   efficient mechanical reproductive isolation. Bumblebees that foraged on
   R. minor flowers carried more pollen, but pollen placement on their
   bodies was similar to that of bees that visited R. angustifolius, and
   cross-specific stigmatic pollen deposition was similar in both
   directions. However, the asymmetry in pollinator handling time between
   the two species, due to dissimilar pollen rewards, may have lowered
   relative heterospecific pollen receipt on R. angustifolius, suggesting
   that net gene flow resulting from pollen transfer dynamics is more
   likely towards R. minor, although this effect remains weak and will be
   most likely counterbalanced by context-based labile pollinator
   preference.}},

Abstract = {{The considerable floral diversity present in the cactus family has often
   been associated with the specificity of its pollinators. However, many
   cactus pollination systems are generalized as their flowers are
   pollinated by a wide spectrum of animals. For example, cactus species
   with white flowers, nocturnal anthesis and extended floral cycles would
   present generalized pollination systems in which both nocturnal and
   diurnal visitors could be effective pollinators. In this article, we
   tested this hypothesis by studying the pollination biology of Echinopsis
   schickendantzii, an Andean cactus with sphingophilous flowers. In
   addition, we evaluated whether the cactus's pollination system is
   complementary or redundant regarding the relative contributions of
   nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Specifically, we studied the floral
   cycle, the reproductive system and the pollination effectiveness of
   floral visitors. The flowers of E. schickendantzii are
   self-incompatible; they opened at crepuscule and have an extended floral
   cycle. Moths were frequent visitors at night, whereas bees were frequent
   visitors during the day; both were effective pollinators of the cactus.
   Our results indicated that the flowers of this species present
   phenotypic, functional and ecological generalization, and their fruit
   set is determined by the contributions of both pollinator functional
   groups, i.e., they have complementary pollination systems. These results
   support the hypothesis that cacti in the extra-tropical deserts of South
   America have generalized pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{Carpenter bees are the main pollinators of passion fruit, a crop
   classified as vulnerable to pollinator decline because it is strictly

   to increase the presence of female carpenter bees in passion fruit
   orchards by using trap-nests in bee shelters. Transfers of nests
   containing females of X. frontalis and X. grisescens between different
   sites were significantly more successful when the nests contained brood
   cells. Supplying a bee shelter with a combination of suitably sized
   empty bamboo stalks and active nests of carpenter bees can increase the
   population of actively nesting bees by >200\% during the course of 23
   mo, as a consequence of the emergence of brood from the introduced nests
   and the attraction of bees from the surroundings. In conclusion, our
   methods lead to improved success of introducing, increasing and
   maintaining carpenter bees populations for the pollination of passion
   fruit crops.}},

Abstract = {{In forest ecosystems, canopy trees provide a large amount of floral
   resources for pollinators but flower production fluctuates highly from
   year to year. Temporal variation in floral resources may influence the
   population dynamics of pollinators. We investigated the relationship
   between the population dynamics of bumble bees (Bombus spp.) and canopy
   floral resources over 5 years in a cool temperate forest. We predicted
   that the yearly fluctuation of canopy resources affects colony
   development and queen production, resulting in the variation of the
   pollination success of understorey plants the following spring. Flower
   production of canopy trees showed clear biyearly fluctuations,
   synchronously among most species. Worker production of Bombus ardens and
   Bombus hypocrita were positively related to floral resources during
   colony establishment by overwintered queens, while that of Bombus
   diversus was positively related to floral resources during the
   worker-active period. An abundance of overwintered queens was positively
   related to both worker abundance and floral resources in the previous
   summer in B. ardens and to only previous-year worker abundance in B.
   hypocrita but was dependent on neither factor in B. diversus. These
   differences in causal effects on queen production among species might be
   a reflection of interspecific differences in the degree of dependence on
   canopy resources for queen production due to species-specific
   phenologies and/or foraging preferences of other species of flowers. The
   extent of pollen limitation in the spring-ephemeral Corydalis ambigua,
   which is exclusively pollinated by overwintered queens, was negatively
   correlated with the abundance of B. hypocrita queens. Thus, population
   dynamics of bumble bees has a crucial effect on seed production of
   understorey plants. Synthesis. The dynamics of flower production in
   overstory trees can indirectly affect the pollination efficiency of
   understorey plants in the next season via the population dynamics of
   pollinators. Our results suggest that a cascade effect occurs through
   pollination networks in a cool temperate forest ecosystem.}},

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{How climate-change induced environmental stress may alter the effects of
   inbreeding in patchy populations of rare species is poorly understood.
   We investigated the fitness of progeny from experimental self-and
   cross-pollinations in eight populations of different size of Echium
   wildpretii, a rare endemic plant of the arid subalpine zone of the
   Canarian island of Tenerife. As control treatments we used open
   pollination and autonomous selfing. The seed set of open-pollinated
   flowers was 55\% higher than that of autonomously selfed flowers,
   showing the importance of animal pollination for reproductive success.
   The seed set, seed mass and germination rate of seedlings of hand-selfed
   flowers was similar to that of hand-crossed flowers, indicating weak
   inbreeding depression (seed set -4.4\%, seed mass -4.1\%, germination
   -7.3\%). Similarly, under normal watering there were no significant
   effects of inbreeding on seedling survival (-3.0\%). However, under low
   watering of seedlings inbreeding depression was high (survival -50.2\%).
   Seed set of open- and hand-outcrossed-pollinated flowers was higher in
   large than in small populations, possibly due to more frequent
   biparental inbreeding in the latter. However, later measures of progeny
   fitness were not significantly influenced by population size. We predict
   that increasing drought duration and frequency due to climate change and
   reductions of population sizes may increase inbreeding depression in
   this charismatic plant species and thus threaten its future survival in
   the longer term.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{High dependence on pollination is considered the main cause of low
   productivity in American yellow passion fruit crops (Passiflora edulis
   f. flavicarpa). As intensive farming practices require similarly
   intensive manual pollination, this study sought answer the following
   questions: (a) is there a difference in the efficiency of fruit
   production when one or more stigmas are pollinated manually, by natural
   pollinators (or both)? and (b) does manual or natural pollination (or
   both) affect the physical and chemical characteristics of the fruits?
   Flowers were pollinated manually, naturally by native bees or by using
   both methods. Fruit production was evaluated seven days after anthesis,
   as well as some selected physico-chemical characteristics of harvested
   fruits. It was demonstrated that the pollination of yellow passion fruit
   is satisfactory only with visitation by native bees, especially
   carpenter bees. There is no difference in fruit production efficiency
   when one or more stigmas are pollinated manually and then left free for
   visits by natural pollinators. Manual pollination in one stigma produced
   less seeds and lower biomass of fruit juice of yellow passion fruits.
   When there is the presence of natural pollinators (notably carpenter
   bees), manual services can be reduced but not completely dismissed.
   Therefore, yellow passion fruit farmers can potentially reduce
   production costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micropholis guyanensis (A.DC.) Pierre is a tree from the rainforests of
   tropical South America and includes two recognised and one informal
   subspecies. The species has a wide geographic distribution from Central
   America, northern and western South America to Amazonia and Bolivia, and
   is morphologically variable. All subspecies occur in the Reserva
   Florestal Adolpho Ducke just outside Manaus, Amazonas State in Brazil,
   and it can be questioned how they can grow in sympatry and retain their
   identity. We have studied vegetative variation, flower morphology and,
   to some degree, reproductive barriers. The species is dioecious, has
   five-merous, cream to greenish flowers that produce pollen, nectar and
   scent to attract pollinators. The flowering period is between June and
   October, and the plants set fruits, one seed in each, between November
   and April. There was no overlap in flowering period in the study area
   between two of the presumed subspecies, but both have similar floral
   morphology and are pollinated by the same species of butterflies and
   bees. Weare not able to find any clear distributional or morphological
   discontinuities between the subspecies and we, therefore, suggest that
   M. guyanensis should be considered a variable species without formally
   recognised subspecies. Flowers of M. guyanensis are highly ephemeral and
   persist only for 1 day (similar to 27 h) before falling to the ground.
   We predict that this is typical for many species of Sapotaceae, which
   can explain why the corolla is missing from the majority of herbarium
   specimens that at first sight have flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Native bees are important providers of pollination services, but there
   are cumulative evidences of their decline. Global changes such as
   habitat losses, invasions of exotic species and climate change have been
   suggested as the main causes of the decline of pollinators. In this
   study, the influence of climate change on the distribution of 10 species
   of Brazilian bees was estimated with species distribution modelling. We
   used Maxent algorithm (maximum entropy) and two different scenarios, an
   optimistic and a pessimistic, to the years 2050 and 2080. We also
   evaluated the percentage reduction of species habitat based on the
   future scenarios of climate change through Geographic Information System
   (GIS). Results showed that the total area of suitable habitats decreased
   for all species but one under the different future scenarios. The
   greatest reductions in habitat area were found for Melipona bicolor
   bicolor and Melipona scutellaris, which occur predominantly in areas
   related originally to Atlantic Moist Forest. The species analysed have
   been reported to be pollinators of some regional crops and the
   consequence of their decrease for these crops needs further
   clarification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The floral biology, pollination and breeding system of Pagamea duckei
   Standl. (Rubiaceae) were studied at the Reserva Biologica da Campina,
   Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Floral morphology suggested that P. duckei is
   a distylous species. However, crossing experiments revealed that it is
   functionally dioecious. The flowers are actinomorphic, yellowish,
   produce nectar and a sweet odor, which is more intense in the morning.
   Anthesis started in the morning between 5.00 and 6.00 AM and extended
   until dusk, when the corolla tube abscissed. The flowers were visited
   mostly by bees of the genus Melipona. Pagamea duckei is not agamospermic
   and thus needs pollen vectors for effective pollination. The results of
   this study strengthen the idea that, in Pagamea, species with distylous
   flower morphology are actually functionally dioecious.}},

Abstract = {{1. Bee behaviour when visiting flowers is mediated by diverse chemical
   cues and signals, from the flower itself and from previous visitors to
   the flower. Flowers recently visited by bees and hoverflies may be
   rejected for a period of time by subsequent bee visitors. 2.
   Nectar-thieving ants also commonly visit flowers and could potentially
   influence the foraging decisions of bees, through the detection of ant
   trail pheromones or footprint hydrocarbons. 3. Here we demonstrate that,
   while naIve bumblebees in laboratory trials are not inherently repelled
   by ant scent marks, they can learn to use them as informative signals
   while foraging on artificial flowers. 4. To test for similar activity in
   the wild, visitor behaviours at the flowers of Digitalis purpurea
   Linnaeus, Bupleurum fruticosum Linnaeus, and Brassica juncea (Linnaeus)
   Czernajew were compared between flowers that had been in contact with
   ants and those that had not. No differences were found between the two
   treatments. 5. The use of chemical foraging cues by bees would appear to
   be strongly dependent on previous experience and in the context of these
   plant species bees did not associate ant scent mark cues with foraging
   costs.}},

Abstract = {{In the current context of global habitat loss, a fundamental challenge
   is to understand how ecological processes interact to determine
   community composition. Despite the accumulating evidence base for global
   declines in bee populations, few studies have addressed the relative
   importance of local environmental and large-scale spatial factors in
   maintaining diverse bee communities outside of agricultural habitats,
   and particularly in areas protected for nature conservation. We analysed
   bee community data that we collected from 40 Special Areas of
   Conservation representing five distinct European Natura 2000 priority
   habitats in Ireland, quantifying local habitat features within each site
   and surrounding land-use. Species data were collected in a nested
   sampling design composed of three hierarchical levels such as site,
   habitat and region and analysed using diversity partitioning. The
   speciesenvironment relationship was also decomposed into regional-,
   landscape- and local-scales by variance partitioning using partial
   canonical correspondence analysis. Wild bee species richness and
   abundance were highly dependent on habitat type, but the majority of
   regional diversity was contained within sites, as opposed to species
   turnover across sites and regions. Bee communities were primarily
   structured by local-scale factors associated with nesting resources and
   grazing regime, with non-Bombus taxa being more sensitive to
   landscape-scale differences in adjacent habitats than Bombus taxa.
   Regional-scale processes, such as species sorting along longitudinal
   gradients, were of minor importance in structuring bee communities in
   this system. Synthesis and applications. Within habitats, local species
   richness, rather than species turnover at higher spatial scales,
   accounted for the majority of regional bee diversity. Local
   environmental factors were powerful determinants of community
   composition. Therefore, management effort prioritising the maintenance
   of a diversity of high-quality habitats within a broad network of
   protected areas best facilitates bee conservation in this system. At a
   regional level, schemes for conserving and restoring important bee
   habitats must be habitat- and taxon-specific, as the impact of
   individual local-scale factors and surrounding land-use on community
   composition is highly habitat- and taxon-dependent.}},

   emergence in an endangered narrow endemic crucifer, Erysimum popovii. We
   conducted a pollen addition experiment across the entire geographic
   distribution of the species, and explored the effect of pollinator
   assemblage, plant population size and density, and other habitat
   variables on pollen limitation intensity in 13 populations. We
   supplemented flowers in 20 plants per population with allogamous pollen.
   To account for potential resource reallocation, we used two types of
   control untreated flowers: internal control flowers from the same
   individual as the supplemented flowers, and external control flowers
   from other individuals. Our results indicate that E. popovii is
   pollen-limited in most of the populations studied, but only through seed
   production, since pollen supplementation did not enhance seedling
   emergence. Beefly abundance was associated with among-population
   differences in pollen limitation intensity. Populations in which
   beeflies were more abundant were less pollen-limited. In contrast, the
   abundance of other flower visitors, such as large bees or butterflies,
   was not associated with pollen limitation. Annual rainfall and bare soil
   cover were associated with the intensity of pollen limitation across
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{(Vertical distribution of biotic pollination systems in cerrado sensu
   stricto in the Triangulo Mineiro, MG, Brazil). Several factors can
   influence the distribution of floral resources and pollination systems
   in ecosystems, such as climate, altitude, geographic region,
   fragmentation of natural areas and differences in floristic composition
   along the vertical stratification. This study aimed to evaluate the
   distribution of the vertical stratification of biotic pollination
   systems in cerrado (sensu stricto) fragments in the Triangulo Mineiro.
   There was no significant difference (chi(2)(0.05,9)=14.17; P = 0.12) in
   total plant species richness among fragments, nor in the species
   richness of each layer (trees, shrubs, herbs and lianas) and the shrub
   layer was the best represented. Likewise, there was no significant
   difference between fragments for the systems of pollination (chi(2)(0
   05,21) =13.80; P = 0.8778). Pollination by bees was the most common,
   corresponding to 85\% of species in each fragment. In relative terms,
   plants pollinated by bees were dominant in all strata, reaching 100\%
   for the lianas in fragments 1, 3 and 4 and for the herbs in fragments 1
   and 4. In this study, based on floristic composition and distribution of
   biotic pollination systems in the vertical stratification, we could
   define a vertical mosaic in the cerrado studied, which has implications
   for the sustainability of communities in the cerrado, as well as the
   horizontal mosaic of vegetation types.}},

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators provide important services to both wild and
   human-dominated ecosystems, yet this group may be threatened by
   widespread anthropogenic landscape change. Suburban sprawl is one of the
   fastest growing types of land use change in North America, and it has
   certain characteristics, such as abundant floral resources, that may be
   beneficial for many pollinators. We examined the effects of sprawl on
   the wild bee assemblage of the shortgrass steppe on the Front Range of
   Colorado, USA. Diversity, abundance, and community composition of bees
   in remnant grassland fragments surrounded by suburban residential land
   use were compared with those in extensive, continuous grassland. No
   overall effect of suburbanization on bee abundance was observed, and
   abundance was extremely variable even within study sites. Bee species
   richness was positively but nonlinearly related to grassland habitat
   area. Bee species density was higher and more variable in suburban
   sites. Suburban sites and smaller habitat area were both related to
   relative increases in the proportions of small bee species, social bees,
   and solitary cavity-nesting bees in the assemblage; small suburban
   habitat areas also favored species of the family Halictidae over Apidae,
   and individuals of the genus Halictus over those of the genus
   Lasioglossum. In this landscape, large native habitat areas surrounded
   by suburban sprawl may actually increase species richness and species
   density over that of continuous grassland, probably by means of habitat
   complementation or supplementation between grassland remnants and the
   surrounding suburban matrix. However, at habitat areas < 20 ha, species
   richness became quite variable; sites < 8 ha contained less than half
   the species of controls.}},

Abstract = {{Rangelands are significant providers of ecosystem services in
   agroecosystems world-wide. Yet few studies have investigated how
   different intensities of livestock grazing impact one important provider
   of these ecosystem services-native bees. We conducted the first
   large-scale manipulative study on the effect of a gradient of livestock
   grazing intensities on native bees in 16 40-ha pastures in the Pacific
   Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie. Each pasture was exposed to one of four
   cattle stocking rates for two years and grazing intensity was quantified
   by measuring utilization. We measured soil and vegetation
   characteristics related to floral and nesting resources as well as
   several metrics of the bee community. Increased grazing intensity
   significantly reduced vegetation structure, soil stability, and
   herbaceous litter and significantly increased soil compaction and bare
   ground. Native bees responded with changes in abundance, richness,
   diversity, and community composition. Responses varied with taxa and
   time of season. Bumble bees were sensitive to grazing intensity early in
   the season, showing reduced abundance, diversity, and/or richness with
   increased intensity, potentially because of altered foraging behavior.
   In contrast, sweat bees appeared unaffected by grazing. These results
   show that native bee taxa vary in their sensitivity to livestock grazing
   practices and suggest that grazing may potentially be a useful tool for
   managing pollination services in mosaic agroecosystems that include
   rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are important pollinators whose populations have declined
   over recent years, raising widespread concern. One conspicuous threat to
   bumble bees is their unintended exposure to trace residues of systemic
   neonicotinoid pesticides, such as imidacloprid, which are ingested when
   bees forage on the nectar and pollen of treated crops. However, the
   demographic consequences for bumble bees of exposure to dietary
   neonicotinoids have yet to be fully established. To determine whether
   environmentally realistic levels of imidacloprid are capable of making a
   demographic impact on bumble bees, we exposed queenless microcolonies of
   worker bumble bees, Bombus terrestris, to a range of dosages of dietary
   imidacloprid between zero and 125 mu g L-1 and examined the effects on
   ovary development and fecundity. Microcolonies showed a dose-dependent
   decline in fecundity, with environmentally realistic dosages in the
   range of 1 mu g L-1 capable of reducing brood production by one third.
   In contrast, ovary development was unimpaired by dietary imidacloprid
   except at the highest dosage. Imidacloprid reduced feeding on both syrup
   and pollen but, after controlling statistically for dosage,
   microcolonies that consumed more syrup and pollen produced more brood.
   We therefore speculate that the detrimental effects of imidacloprid on
   fecundity emerge principally from nutrient limitation imposed by the
   failure of individuals to feed. Our findings raise concern about the
   impact of neonicotinoids on wild bumble bee populations. However, we
   recognize that to fully evaluate impacts on wild colonies it will be
   necessary to establish the effect of dietary neonicotinoids on the
   fecundity of bumble bee queens.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{The primary function of secondary plant metabolites is thought to be
   defence against herbivores. The frequent occurrence of these same
   noxious compounds in floral nectar, which functions primarily to attract
   pollinators, has been seen as paradoxical. Although these compounds may
   have an adaptive purpose in nectar, they may also occur as a nonadaptive
   consequence of chemical defence in other plant parts. If nectar
   chemistry reflects physiological constraints or passive leakage from
   other tissues, we expect that the identity and relative concentration of
   nectar cardenolides to be correlated with those of other plant parts; in
   contrast, discordant distributions of compounds in nectar and other
   tissues may suggest adaptive roles in nectar. We compared the
   concentrations and identities of cardenolides in the nectar, leaves and
   flowers of 12 species from a monophyletic clade of Asclepias. To measure
   putative toxicity of nectar cardenolides, we then examined the effects
   of a standard cardenolide (digoxin) on the behaviour of bumblebees, a
   common generalist pollinator of Asclepias. We found that the average
   cardenolide concentrations in nectar, leaves and flowers of the 12
   Asclepias species were positively correlated as predicted by nonadaptive
   hypotheses. However, significant differences in the identities and
   concentrations of individual cardenolides between nectar and leaves
   suggest that the production or allocation of cardenolides may be
   independently regulated at each plant part. In addition, cardenolide
   concentrations in leaves and nectar exhibited no phylogenetic signal.
   Surprisingly, bumblebees did not demonstrate an aversion to digoxin-rich
   nectar, which may indicate that nectar cardenolides have little effect
   on pollination. Although the idea that discordant patterns of secondary
   metabolites across tissue types may signal adaptive functions is
   attractive, there is evidence to suggest constraint contributes to
   nectar secondary chemistry. Further work testing the ecological impacts
   of such patterns will be critical in determining the functional
   significance of nectar cardenolides.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts between alternative pollinator types are regarded as the main
   source of divergent selection underlying angiosperm floral
   diversification. However, pollinating species can exhibit substantial
   intraspecific variation, particularly between genders, in key
   morphological and behavioural traits determining their interactions with
   flowers. This potential mechanism of floral diversification remains
   largely unexplored. The bee fly, Megapalpus capensis, is the predominant
   pollinator of the remarkable array of floral forms of the sexually
   deceptive daisy Gorteria diffusa. Flies exhibit strong gender-specific
   interactions with the variable insect-like spots which characterize
   G.diffusa inflorescences. In order to explore variation in the
   preferences of male and female pollinators for the visual, tactile and
   olfactory components of these spots, and its implications for floral
   diversification, we used a sequence of binary choice tests where we
   manipulated individual spot components. Male and female flies exhibited
   contrasting preferences for spot components with females preferring
   simplistic spots and avoiding UV highlights, whilst males prefer any
   additional visual and tactile phenotypic complexity. Floral odour alone
   elicited significant preference in females only, indicating that, in
   contrast to orchids, sexual deception in G.diffusa is achieved largely
   through visual mimicry of female pollinators. Our results clearly show
   that elaboration of the insect-like spots has evolved in response to
   male preferences and suggest that a trade-off exists between the
   attraction of male and female flies, which may have contributed to the
   divergence in floral phenotype between morphotypes of G.diffusa
   Pollinators exhibit gender differences in floral preferences and
   behaviour which is another potential source of divergent selection
   contributing to angiosperm floral diversification.}},

Abstract = {{While we understand a great deal on the impacts of introduced generalist
   pollinators on the native ecosystems, very little is known about the
   impacts of naturalized specialist pollinators. The oil-collecting bee
   Centris nitida, which has recently naturalized in southern Florida, has
   been identified as a novel participant in an endemic specialized
   mutualism between Byrsonima lucida, a threatened native oil plant, and
   Centris errans, its sole native pollinator. In this study, we determined
   the impacts of this novel pollinator on B. lucida by assessing the
   degree of its pollen limitations in sites with and without the
   introduced oil bee, as well as in natural and garden settings. We also
   compared the key processes of pollination for both of the Centris bee
   species. The degrees of pollen limitation sustained by B. lucida were
   similar among sites with or without the introduced oil bee, and among
   natural or garden sites. The native oil bee's visitation rates (no. of
   visits/minute/flower) to B. lucida plants were not significantly reduced
   at sites where the introduced oil bees were present. The native oil bee
   had a lower foraging rate (no. of flowers visited/minute) and was a less
   efficient pollinator than the introduced oil bee. There has been no
   observed negative impact to either the native oil plant or bee, the
   introduced bee is absent in most natural areas, and it is also possible
   that the bee may arrive naturally given the trend in global warming. In
   light of these facts, we do not recommend any management action towards
   this introduced oil bee.}},

Abstract = {{Flight activity of foragers of four colonies of Plebeia remota
   (Holmberg, 1903) was registered from December 1998 to December 1999,
   using an automated system (photocells and PLC system). The colonies
   originated from two different regions: Cunha, state of Sao Paulo, and
   Prudentopolis, state of Parana, Brazil. Flight activity was influenced
   by different climatic factors in each season. In the summer, the
   intensity of the correlations between flight activity and climatic
   factors was smaller than in the other seasons. During the autumn and
   winter, solar radiation was the factor that most influenced flight
   activity, while in the spring, this activity was influenced mainly by
   temperature. Except in the summer, the various climatic factors
   similarly influenced flight activity of all of the colonies. Flight
   activity was not affected by geographic origin of the colonies.
   Information concerning seasonal differences in flight activity of P.
   remota will be useful for prediction of geographic distribution
   scenarios under climatic changes.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-408}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{With increasing urbanization and creation of novel habitat types, green
   roofs can provide habitable space for many species. To date, most
   research on green roofs has focused on minimizing environmental impacts
   of buildings and little is known about the ecological services they may
   provide. Previous research has found a deficiency of pollinating bees on
   green roofs, which could result in pollen limitation, poor seed
   production and reproductive failure of many plant species requiring bee
   pollination. This study aims to determine whether pollination services
   on modern green roofs are sufficient for these novel habitats to
   function sustainably. Nine native Illinois prairie plant species and
   their pollinator communities were studied on green roofs and
   ground-level locations in the Chicago area. Pan traps were used to
   assess pollinator communities and supplemental pollination treatments
   were used to evaluate pollen limitation. All species showed
   significantly reduced seed set when pollinators were excluded but few
   significant differences were observed between supplemental and open
   pollination treatments. Seed set differed by habitat type in that green
   roofs had a higher overall mean percent maximum seed set compared to
   ground-level sites. Our results support previous studies, showing lower
   numbers and diversity of bees on green roofs compared to the ground
   level. Together, these data suggest that although green roofs contain a
   smaller and less diverse community of pollinators, the insects that are
   present provide sufficient pollinator services for many native plants.
   This study therefore supports the use of biotically pollinated native
   forbs in future green roof design. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Investigating temporal patterns of a native bee community in a remnant
   North American bunchgrass prairie using blue vane traps}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Native bees are important ecologically and economically because their
   role as pollinators fulfills a vital ecosystem service. Pollinators are
   declining due to various factors, including habitat degradation and
   destruction. Grasslands, an important habitat for native bees, are
   particularly vulnerable. One highly imperiled and understudied grassland
   type in the United States is the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie.
   No studies have examined native bee communities in this prairie type. To
   fill this gap, the bee fauna of the Zumwalt Prairie, a large, relatively
   intact remnant of the Pacific Northwest Bunchgrass Prairie, was
   examined. Native bees were sampled during the summers of 2007 and 2008
   in sixteen 40-ha study pastures on a plateau in northeastern Oregon,
   using a sampling method not previously used in grassland studies-blue
   vane traps. This grassland habitat contained an abundant and diverse
   community of native bees that experienced marked seasonal and
   inter-annual variation, which appears to be related to weather and plant
   phenology. Temporal variability evident over the entire study area was
   also reflected at the individual trap level, indicating a consistent
   response across the spatial scale of the study. These results
   demonstrate that temporal variability in bee communities can have
   important implications for long-term monitoring protocols. In addition,
   the blue vane trap method appears to be well-suited for studies of
   native bees in large expanses of grasslands or other open habitats, and
   may be a useful tool for monitoring native bee communities in these
   systems.}},

   Beetle Pollinators: a Unique Olfactory Floral Signal Shared by

Abstract = {{Cyclocephaline scarabs are specialised scent-driven pollinators,
   implicated with the reproductive success of several Neotropical plant
   taxa. Night-blooming flowers pollinated by these beetles are thermogenic
   and release intense fragrances synchronized to pollinator activity.
   However, data on floral scent composition within such mutualistic
   interactions are scarce, and the identity of behaviorally active
   compounds involved is largely unknown. We performed GC-MS analyses of
   floral scents of four species of Annona (magnoliids, Annonaceae) and
   Caladium bicolor (monocots, Araceae), and demonstrated the chemical
   basis for the attraction of their effective pollinators.
   4-Methyl-5-vinylthiazole, a nitrogen and sulphur-containing heterocyclic
   compound previously unreported in flowers, was found as a prominent
   constituent in all studied species. Field biotests confirmed that it is
   highly attractive to both male and female beetles of three species of
   the genus Cyclocephala, pollinators of the studied plant taxa. The
   origin of 4-methyl-5-vinylthiazole in plants might be associated with
   the metabolism of thiamine (vitamin B1), and we hypothesize that the
   presence of this compound in unrelated lineages of angiosperms is either
   linked to selective expression of a plesiomorphic biosynthetic pathway
   or to parallel evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Learning plays an important role in food acquisition for a wide range of
   insects. To increase their foraging efficiency, flower-visiting insects
   may learn to associate floral cues with the presence (so-called reward
   learning) or the absence (so-called non-reward learning) of a reward.
   Reward learning whilst foraging for flowers has been demonstrated in
   many insect taxa, whilst non-reward learning in flower-visiting insects
   has been demonstrated only in honeybees, bumblebees and hawkmoths. This
   study examined both reward and non-reward learning abilities in the
   butterfly Byasa alcinous whilst foraging among artificial flowers of
   different colours. This butterfly showed both types of learning,
   although butterflies of both sexes learned faster via reward learning.
   In addition, females learned via reward learning faster than males. To
   the best of our knowledge, these are the first empirical data on the
   learning speed of both reward and non-reward learning in insects. We
   discuss the adaptive significance of a lower learning speed for
   non-reward learning when foraging on flowers.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{593-602}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly used to reverse degradation of
   rare ecosystems and maintain biological diversity. Pollinator
   communities are critical to maintenance of plant diversity and, in light
   of recent pollinator loss, we tested whether removal of invasive glossy
   buckthorn (Frangula alnus L.) from portions of a prairie fen wetland
   altered plant and pollinator communities. We compared herbaceous plant,
   bee, and butterfly abundance, diversity, and species composition in
   buckthorn invaded, buckthorn removal, and uninvaded reference plots.
   Following restoration, we found striking differences in plant and
   pollinator abundance and species composition between restored,
   unrestored, and reference plots. Within 2 years of F. alnus removal,
   plant species diversity and composition in restored plots were
   significantly different than invaded plots, but also remained
   significantly lower than reference plots. In contrast, in the first
   growing season following restoration, bee and butterfly abundance,
   diversity, and composition were similar in restored and reference plots
   and distinct from invaded plots. Our findings indicate that a diverse
   community of mobile generalist pollinators rapidly re-colonizes restored
   areas of prairie fen, while the plant community may take longer to fully
   recover. This work implies that, in areas with intact pollinator
   metapopulations, restoration efforts will likely prevent further loss of
   mobile generalist pollinators and maintain pollination services. On the
   other hand, targeted restoration efforts will likely be required to
   restore populations of rare plants and specialist pollinators for which
   local and regional species pools may be lacking.}},

Abstract = {{General visual bee mimicry and specific chemical mimicry by flowers to
   solitary female bees or wasps are well known in several orchid genera,
   for example, the Mediterranean genus Ophrys, the Australian genera
   Cryptostylis and Chiloglottis, and the South-African Disa. This mimicry
   has been shown to attract solitary male bees or wasps, which are their
   species-specific pollinators. The visual and chemical signals are
   considered to be a type of deceptive pollination mechanism based on
   mimicry for the exploitation of perceptual biases of animals. We propose
   that in addition to this unique pollination mechanism, these plants
   exhibit another, rarely mentioned and practically forgotten,
   non-exclusive function of bee or wasp mimicry (Batesian mimicry). This
   mimicry may deter large mammalian herbivores, and possibly also insects
   from the plants and especially from their flowers by a type of visual
   and olfactory deceptive aposematism. While visiting the flowers, bees
   and wasps may add a Mullerian effect to this defense. We extend this
   hypothesis to many other rewarding flowers that are bee or wasp
   pollinated and propose that abundance of pollinating bees or wasps may
   deter herbivorous mammals and insects from the plants during their peak
   flowering season.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effects of flowering season on the community structure
   and dynamics of flower visitors, I examined annual and hourly variation
   in flower-visiting insects on two Rhododendron species in a deciduous
   secondary forest in central Japan. Rhododendron reticulatum flowers from
   late March to mid-April, whereas R. macrosepalum flowers from late April
   to late May. Bagged and hand-pollination experiments indicated that
   outcrossing by flower visitors was important for the pollination of both
   R. reticulatum and R. macrosepalum. Pollinator and pollen limitation
   were detected in both Rhododendron species, although the extent of both
   differed between the two species. The flowers of both Rhododendron
   species were visited by insects of diverse taxa, including Hymenoptera,
   Diptera and Lepidoptera. The composition of flower visitors differed
   between R. reticulatum and R. macrosepalum, although a few species
   visited both of them. The beefly Bombylius major (Diptera: Bombyliidae)
   most frequently visited R. reticulatum, whereas the bumblebee Bombus
   ardens ardens (Hymenoptera: Apidae) most frequently visited R.
   macrosepalum. Hourly changes in the number of flower visitors also
   differed between R. reticulatum and R. macrosepalum; insects visited R.
   reticulatum flowers less frequently in the morning than in the
   afternoon, whereas insect visitations to R. macrosepalum flowers did not
   differ between morning and afternoon. Differences in both insect
   community structure and hourly changes of visitations between the two
   Rhododendron species occurred annually and may be related to the life
   history of the abundant visitor species as well as flowering phenology.}},

Abstract = {{Most Cypripedium spp. are known to be pollinated by bees. However,
   myiophilous traits are found in some species, especially in sections
   Trigonopedia and Sinopedilum. Here we chose C. micranthum and C.
   sichuanense, two sympatric species endemic to Sichuan, China, to test
   whether these orchids are fly pollinated. Artificial pollination showed
   that both flowers are self-compatible but need pollen vectors for
   successful reproduction. Field observation showed that C. micranthum was
   pollinated by fruit flies and C. sichuanense by dung flies, both novel
   pollinators of Cypripedium orchids. These sympatric Cypripedium spp. are
   also cross-compatible, but hybrids were not found in nature. The
   pollination syndromes of C. sichuanense and C. micranthum fit into the
   complex sapromyiophily pattern. It appears that pollinator specificity
   is responsible for their reproductive isolation. The discovery of fly
   pollination in C. sichuanense and C. micranthum, which belong to the
   related sections Trigonopedia and Sinopedilum, suggests a shift from bee
   to fly pollination in the genus Cypripedium. Unlike most Cypripedium
   spp., the anthers of C. micranthum release discrete pollinia with narrow
   stalks instead of the usual amorphous pollen smears. This
   proto-pollinarium is described, probably for the first time. These
   pollinia are most likely an adaptation for pollination by microdiptera,
   so the fly can carry the contents of both chambers in the same anther.

Title = {{When resources don't rescue: flowering phenology and species
   interactions affect compensation to herbivory in Ipomopsis aggregata}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The ability of plants to tolerate, or compensate for, herbivore damage
   is highly variable and has been the subject of much research. Although
   many plants can compensate for herbivore damage, and some even
   overcompensate, we cannot yet generalize about the conditions that
   promote a positive response to damage. Here, we asked how abiotic
   resources (i.e. plant nutrient status) coupled with biotic interactions
   i.e. subsequent interactions with pollinators, seed predators and nectar
   robbing bumble bees affect the compensatory ability of Ipomopsis
   aggregata, a monocarpic herb that has been the subject of much previous
   debate. We hypothesized that compensation to herbivore damage in I.
   aggregata (Polemoniaceae) would depend first on plants having an ample
   supply of resources and, second, on the outcome of subsequent
   interactions with mutualist pollinators and enemy pre-dispersal seed
   predators and nectar robbing bumble bees. We used a fully-factorial
   experiment in which plants were watered, fertilized or left as
   unmanipulated controls, crossed with clipping to simulate herbivore
   damage to the apical meristem. Resource addition enhanced both male and
   female components of fitness, but resource enhancement did not provide
   the means for plants to fully compensate for simulated herbivory.
   Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences, but at the
   expense of a delay in flowering and fewer total flowers. Clipping
   significantly reduced losses to dipteran pre-dispersal seed predators by
   delaying flowering time, but early flowering plants produced higher
   numbers of seeds despite incurring higher rates of predation. Clipped
   plants incurred a higher risk to nectar robbers in one of two years.
   Overall, clipped plants suffered severe reductions (a nearly 50\%
   reduction in total seed set) in female success, but clipping combined
   with nutrient addition enhanced male function through increases in
   per-flower pollen production. However, because clipped plants produced
   significantly fewer flowers than unclipped plants, whole-plant pollen
   production was significantly reduced by clipping. Pollinator visitation
   and nectar robbing were variable between clipping treatments and between
   years and (nectar robbing) among sites. Our results demonstrate that the
   variability in plant response to herbivory can, at least in part, be
   driven by plant interactions with mutualists and enemies. Thus,
   accounting for such interactions and their variability is important to
   fully understanding plant compensation for herbivore damage and will
   likely go far to explain variation in plant response that appears to be
   independent of resources.}},

Title = {{Effects of body size and sociality on the anti-predator behaviour of
   foraging bees}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1473-1482}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators, like most other animals, often face a tradeoff between
   increasing food uptake and minimising predation. An earlier model
   suggests that social bees should be more likely than solitary bees to
   adopt riskier foraging strategies in order to increase food uptake. In
   this paper, we extend this model by studying the effect of body size, in
   addition to sociality, on the predationintake rate tradeoff. When,
   following standard practice, we express the foraging strategies in terms
   of mortality probability and net food uptake, we find that body size
   should have no effect on the foraging strategies of solitary bees.
   Social bees, on the other hand, should change their foraging preferences
   according to their size. Small social bees should tend to maximise food
   uptake, and large social bees to minimise mortality rate. Mortality,
   however, is the product of two terms: the probability of suffering an
   attack and the probability of succumbing to it. Noting that larger bees
   are less susceptible to succumb to a predation attempt than smaller
   bees, model predictions change when foraging strategies are expressed in
   terms of exposure to predators. Following this second approach, exposure
   to predators should increase monotonically with body size in solitary
   bees. In social bees it should reach a minimum for medium-sized bees. We
   conclude that both bee body size and sociality should be considered when
   studying the effect of predators on resource use.}},

Abstract = {{Debevec, AH., Cardinal, S \& Danforth, BN. Identifying the sister group
   to the bees: a molecular phylogeny of Aculeata with an emphasis on the
   superfamily Apoidea. Zoologica Scripta, 41, 527535. The hymenopteran
   superfamily Apoidea includes the bees (Anthophila) as well as four
   predatory wasp families (Heterogynaidae, Ampulicidae, Sphecidae and
   Crabronidae) collectively referred to as the sphecoid or apoid wasps.
   The most widely cited studies suggest that bees are sister to the wasp
   family Crabronidae, but alternative hypotheses have been proposed based
   on both morphological and molecular data. We combined DNA sequence data
   from previously published studies and newly generated data for four
   nuclear genes (28S, long-wavelength rhodopsin, elongation factor-1a and
   wingless) to identify the likely sister group to the bees. Analysis of
   our four-gene data set by maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods
   indicates that bees most likely arise from within a paraphyletic
   Crabronidae. Possible sister groups to the bees include Philanthinae,
   Pemphredoninae or Philanthinae + Pemphredoninae. We used Bayesian
   methods to explore the robustness of our results. Bayes Factor tests
   strongly rejected the hypotheses of crabronid monophyly as well as
   placement of Heterogynaidae within Crabronidae. Our results were also
   stable to alternative rootings of the bees. These findings provide
   additional support for the hypothesis that bees arise from within
   Crabronidae, rather than being sister to Crabronidae, thus altering our
   understanding of bee ancestry and evolutionary history.}},

Abstract = {{Protected areas help to develop regional and global strategies for the
   conservation of biodiversity. However, human-related activities, such as
   grazing, tourism, hardwood extraction, etc., may cause the decline of
   some species. In this study, we investigate whether inhabiting protected
   areas affect the conservation of Erysimum popovii, a narrow endemic and
   endangered plant, in Mediterranean environments with traditional human
   activities. We surveyed its entire distribution area in SE Spain, and
   located 31 populations, 16 within Nature Parks (Category V of the IUCN)
   and 15 in non protected areas. In each population we measured several
   variables related to habitat composition, pollinator community,
   herbivory damage and population viability. Our results show that
   populations in protected areas inhabit localities at higher altitudes
   and with more shrub cover. Most important, the abundance of a very
   effective pollinator type, beeflies, was significantly higher in
   protected populations. Curiously, damage by ungulates was also more
   intense in protected areas. The negative effect of herbivory offsets any
   positive effect played by pollinators in protected areas, and
   consequently there were not differences in population size or
   reproductive output inside and outside protected areas. It seems that
   allowing traditional uses in protected areas may entail negative effects
   for some vulnerable plant species.}},

Abstract = {{The degree to which pollinator-mediated interactions assist or impede
   plant invasions is currently poorly understood. Here we describe the
   findings of an experiment designed to investigate how
   pollinator-mediated interactions between invasive Lythrum salicaria
   (Purple loosestrife) and a closely related native North American
   species, Decodon verticillatus (Swamp loosestrife) are influenced by the
   stage of invasion (i.e., early or late). By comparing pollinator
   preference and constancy to plants in experimentally introduced arrays
   of L. salicaria and D. verticillatus in invaded and uninvaded
   communities, we were able to simulate the ecological implications of two
   different stages of L. salicaria invasion. Invasion status had no
   significant effect on pollinator visitation to L. salicaria and D.
   verticillatus when all pollinator taxa were considered together.
   However, when bumblebees, the dominant pollinator at all sites, were
   considered alone, we found a significant interaction between pollinator
   preference and the invasion status of the site, with D. verticillatus
   preferred at uninvaded sites only, and no preference exhibited at
   invaded sites. In addition, for all pollinator taxa, we found that
   interspecific pollinator movements were overrepresented at uninvaded
   sites and underrepresented at invaded sites, suggesting that
   heterospecific pollen deposition could be a significant impediment to
   pollinator-mediated reproduction for both species in the early stages of
   an invasion. We discuss the potential consequences of our findings to
   the establishment of animal-pollinated invasive plants and the
   persistence of native species in the face of invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Bees are the most important pollinators of flowering plants and
   essential ecological keystone species contributing to the integrity of
   most terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we examine the potential impact of
   climate change on bees geographic range in a global biodiversity
   hotspot. Location South Africa with a focus on the Cape Floristic Region
   (CFR) diversity hotspot. Methods similar to Geographic ranges of 12
   South African bee species representing dominant distribution types were
   studied, and the climate change impacts upon bees were examined with A2
   and B2 climate scenarios of HadCM3 model, using MaxEnt for species
   distribution modelling. Results The predicted levels of climate
   change-induced impacts on species ranges varied from little shifts and
   range expansion of 550\% for two species to substantial range
   contractions between 32\% and 99\% in another six species. Four species
   show considerable range shifts. Bees of the winter rainfall area in the
   west of South Africa generally have smaller range sizes than in the
   summer rainfall area and generally show eastward range contractions
   toward the dry interior. Bee species prevalent in summer rainfall
   regions show a tendency for a south-easterly shift in geographic range.
   Main conclusions The bee fauna of the CFR is identified as the most
   vulnerable to climate change due to the high level of endemism, the
   small range sizes and the island-like isolation of the
   Mediterranean-type climate region at the SW tip of Africa. For
   monitoring climate change impact on bees, we suggest to establish
   observatories in the coastal plains of the west coast that are predicted
   to be worst affected and areas where persistence of populations is most
   likely. Likely impacts of climate change on life history traits of bees
   (phenology, sociality, bee-host plant synchronization) are discussed but
   require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well known that many bumblebee species are threatened in
   Europe and in N. America. Various hypotheses have been proposed to
   explain this regression. Some of the hypothetical factors act at a
   continental level, as the general restructuration of the agriculture
   toward the use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisation, in place of
   leguminous crops. The landscape fragmentation is typically a local
   factor the fusion of which also leads to large-scale effects. Since
   2002, we observed a great number of situations where local droughts and
   heat waves occurred in France, UK, Scandinavia, Turkey, leading to very
   strong local reductions of the bumblebee's fauna. We observed so many
   local cases in 2007-2009 that we could hypothesise that a merger of
   these local effects could lead to a new general threat. As they are the
   most exposed to heat waves, the species with a late (summer) phenology
   should be the most sensitive to this risk.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an important ecosystem service, especially to
   self-sterile crops as passion fruit, which depends on the large solitary
   bee for fruit set. We estimated the species richness of pollinators of
   yellow passion fruit in Central Brazil and examined whether there was
   any association with crop yield. We recorded 27 bee species on passion
   fruit flowers in commercial orchards in the region, from 2004 to 2007.
   Some 17 species were classified as pollinators (12 as effective and 5 as
   occasional pollinators). Species richness and frequency of pollinators
   were positively correlated with reproductive efficacy. Hand pollination
   substantially increased average fruit set (from 23.3\% to 69.8\%). Our
   results indicated that, although native pollinators still maintain
   economically viable natural fruit set in the region, pollination can be
   sustained and even enhanced by promoting conservation and management of
   bee diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, many crops rely on insect pollination. Insufficient
   pollination can reduce fruit and seed set by directly reducing pollen
   deposition, and can also affect offspring quality, such as growth rate
   and resistance to herbivores, by limiting outcrossing opportunities.
   Both effects are important in fruit agroecosystems where fruit size and
   the quality of seeds for re-planting are dependent on sufficient
   pollination. We experimentally manipulated pollination of the cape
   gooseberry, Physalis peruviana L. (Solanaceae), to test the effects of
   honey and bumble bee pollination compared to manual outcrossing and
   autonomous self-pollination on fruit and offspring characteristics.
   Compared to manual and self-pollination, bee pollination increased fruit
   size, seed set and germination rates, supporting the hypothesis that
   sufficient pollination increases plant fitness. Interestingly, plant
   growth rate and herbivore resistance were significantly and marginally
   greater in manually outcrossed plants compared to self-pollinated
   offspring, suggesting that inbreeding reduces offspring quality.
   Herbivore resistance and plant growth did not differ between one
   honeybee visit and self-pollination suggesting that multiple pollinator
   visits are needed to prevent inbreeding events. Our data suggest that
   the quantity and quality of pollen deposited by bee visitation can
   significantly alter ecologically and economically relevant traits in
   this agroecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The role of the Orii's flying-fox, Pteropus dasymallus inopinatus, in
   the reproduction of Mucuna macrocarpa was investigated through captive
   and wild observations on Okinawajima Island in the Ryukyu Archipelago,
   Japan. When Orii's flying-fox fed on flowers of M macrocarpa, it pushed
   its nose to the basal portion of the flowers to feed on nectar. This
   caused the hard petals of flowers to explode and consequently opened the
   carina. When a flying-fox's face pointed in the same direction as a
   flower, there was a significantly higher explosive opening rate compared
   with approaches from the side or the opposite direction (chi(2) test; P
   < 0.001). In total, in the captive setting, 32.2\% of the flowers
   exhibited explosive opening. During such events, stamens with pollen and
   pistils emerged and attached to the throat and forehead of the
   flying-fox. Other main flower visitors were the brown-eared bulbul, the
   Japanese white-eye, the Japanese bush warbler, and the honeybee, but
   they did not stimulate explosive opening. These observations demonstrate
   that the Orii's flying-fox is the only explosive opener and the primary
   pollinator of this flower. On the other hand, flying-foxes sometimes
   damaged flowers. However, this does not appear to be a serious problem
   for M macrocarpa, which has a large number of flowers.}},

   Scales}},

Abstract = {{Central place foragers, such as pollinating bees, typically develop
   circuits (traplines) to visit multiple foraging sites in a manner that
   minimizes overall travel distance. Despite being taxonomically
   widespread, these routing behaviours remain poorly understood due to the
   difficulty of tracking the foraging history of animals in the wild. Here
   we examine how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) develop and optimise
   traplines over large spatial scales by setting up an array of five
   artificial flowers arranged in a regular pentagon (50 m side length) and
   fitted with motion-sensitive video cameras to determine the sequence of
   visitation. Stable traplines that linked together all the flowers in an
   optimal sequence were typically established after a bee made 26 foraging
   bouts, during which time only about 20 of the 120 possible routes were
   tried. Radar tracking of selected flights revealed a dramatic decrease
   by 80\% (ca. 1500 m) of the total travel distance between the first and
   the last foraging bout. When a flower was removed and replaced by a more
   distant one, bees engaged in localised search flights, a strategy that
   can facilitate the discovery of a new flower and its integration into a
   novel optimal trapline. Based on these observations, we developed and
   tested an iterative improvement heuristic to capture how bees could
   learn and refine their routes each time a shorter route is found. Our
   findings suggest that complex dynamic routing problems can be solved by
   small-brained animals using simple learning heuristics, without the need
   for a cognitive map.}},

Abstract = {{Greenhouse tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill) production relies on
   pollination by commercially-produced bumble bee (Bombus impatiens
   Cresson) colonies. Inadequate pollination by bumble bees has been a
   problem for growers at certain times of year; however, its cause has yet
   to be determined. Bumble bees have been shown to exit tomato greenhouses
   to forage on flowers of other plants. This study investigates tomato's
   floral characteristics and their affect on bumble bee pollination by 1)
   observing foraging preferences for bumble bees on greenhouse tomato, 2)
   determining if the plant's floral advertisements could be used by the
   bees to estimate pollen availability, and 3) identifying temporal
   changes in floral display which correspond to peak bumble bee activity.
   Flower size (petal length, anther cone width, and anther cone length)
   and floral scent (release of beta-phellandrene, 2-carene, alpha-pinene,
   and p-cymene) were evaluated to identify the pollinator-important
   characteristics of tomato flowers. Our results indicate that 1) bumble
   bees preferred to pollinate flowers which produce less beta-phellandrene
   and 2-carene in comparison to flowers producing more of these volatiles,
   2) flower size and floral scent are not likely used by the bees to
   estimate pollen availability, and 3) cultivars are inconsistent in their
   production of floral volatiles during peak bumble bee activity.
   beta-phellandrene and 2-carene may be antiherbivory volatiles and
   reduced production during peak bee activity may help to facilitate
   pollination of tomato. Pollinator-repellent volatiles may help to
   protect flowers from damage caused by over-pollination.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behaviors of bumble bee workers have been examined in natural
   habitats, whereas agricultural landscapes, which can provide insights on
   flight distances to fragmented patches of bloom, have received limited
   attention. In particular, information on worker flight distances to
   crops blooming several months after nests have been established is
   invaluable. Here, we examined foraging patterns of Bombus vosnesenskii
   Radoszkowski in late-season blooming clover in the
   agricultural-dominated Willamette Valley in Oregon. Workers from 10
   fields collected over 2 yr were assigned to full sibling families
   (colonies) by using eight microsatellite loci. With estimation of
   numbers of unseen species, we inferred the presence of 189 colonies from
   433 bees genotyped in year 1, and 144 from 296 genotyped the next year.
   Worker foraging distance was estimated to be at least 11.6 km, half the
   distance between the most remote fields visited by the same colonies.
   Numbers of nests contributing workers to each field ranged from 15 to
   163. Overall, 165 (50\%) colonies foraged in two or more fields, and
   thus used common resources within the landscape. Estimates of average
   nest densities in the landscape each year ranged from 0.76/km(2) to
   22.16/km(2), and highlighted the influences of various study parameters
   incorporated into the calculation including sample size, distances
   between sites, and analytical tools used to estimate unsampled
   individuals. Based on the results, bumble bees can fly long distances,
   and this could facilitate their survival in fragmented agricultural
   landscapes. This has important implications for the scale of habitat
   management in bumble bee conservation programs.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence suggests that the freely accessible pollen of some
   plants is chemically protected against pollen-feeding flower visitors.
   For example, a diet of pollen from buttercup plants (Ranunculus)
   recently was shown to have a deleterious effect on developing larvae of
   several bee species not specialized on Ranunculus. Numerous Ranunculus
   species contain ranunculin, the glucosyl hydrate form of the highly
   reactive and toxic lactone protoanemonin, that causes the toxicity of
   these plants. We tested whether the presence of ranunculin is
   responsible for the lethal effects of R. acris pollen on the larvae of
   two bee species that are not Ranunculus specialists. To investigate the
   effect on bee larval development, we added ranunculin to the pollen
   provisions of the Campanula specialist bee Chelostoma rapunculi and the
   Asteraceae specialist bee Heriades truncorum, and allowed the larvae to
   feed on these provisions. We quantified ranunculin in pollen of R. acris
   and in brood cell provisions collected by the Ranunculus specialist bee
   Chelostoma florisomne. We demonstrated that although ranunculin was
   lethal to both tested bee species in high concentrations, the
   concentration in the pollen of R. acris was at least fourfold lower than
   that tolerated by the larvae of C. rapunculi and H. truncorum in the
   feeding experiments. Ranunculin concentration in the brood cells of C.
   florisomne was on average even twentyfold lower than that in Ranunculus
   pollen, suggesting that a mechanism different from ranunculin
   intoxication accounts for the larval mortality reported for bees not
   specialized on Ranunculus pollen.}},

Journal = {{PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature environments interfere with plant reproduction by
   reducing the frequency of pollinators, and this may favour reproductive
   strategies such as self-pollination and apomixis. Tibouchina pulchra is
   a common tree species that occurs at high and low sites of the Brazilian
   Atlantic rainforest. This study focussed on the pollination biology and
   breeding system of this species, describing the pollinators and the
   reproductive success at the two sites of an elevational gradient.
   Observations were made to determine extent of flowering and fruiting, to
   identify the richness and abundance of pollinators, and to record data
   on the floral and reproductive biology at these two sites. Despite more
   dense flowering at the high site, five visits of bees (two species) were
   recorded during the observation time (60 h), whereas at the low site
   there were 948 visits (seven species) during the same period. In
   contrast with the low site, the flowers of the high site released and
   received few pollen grains on the stigma. At the high site less fruit
   was set with fewer seeds as a result of open pollination than at the low
   site; at that site, however, more seeds were obtained from
   cross-pollination than at the low site. Tibouchina pulchra is
   self-compatible; however it is not apomictic and needs pollinators for
   seed set at both sites. Life-history traits other than the breeding
   system, for example more dense flowering, advantage of greater fertility
   in cross-pollination, and multiple reproductive events during the
   lifetime of the tree may reduce inbreeding depression, increase the
   hybrid vigour, and balance the lack of pollinators at the high site.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and facilitation in species interactions attract much
   attention in ecology, but their relative importance has seldom been
   evaluated in a community context. We assessed competitive and
   facilitative interactions for pollinator visitation among co-flowering
   species in a plant community, investigated the subsequent consequences
   for plant reproduction, and investigated whether effects could be
   trait-based. We removed the flowers of two species attractive to
   pollinators, in two separate experiments and assessed the effects on
   pollinator visitation rates and components of reproductive success in 11
   co-flowering focal herb species. Overall, most focal species appear not
   to interact with the removal species with respect to pollinator
   visitation and subsequent reproduction (neutral interactions). Three
   focal species in the community had significantly higher reproductive
   responses (fruit production and seed weight) in the presence of the
   attractive removal species (facilitative interactions), but species
   interaction effects were less pronounced in species' flower visitation
   rates. A community-wide meta-analysis demonstrated that the two
   experiments did not have a significant effect on either facilitation or
   competition, and that there was no overall correlation between effect
   sizes for visitation and reproduction. Based on species-specific
   responses, it seems likely that floral traits such as similar flower
   colors contribute to interspecific facilitation of pollinator visitation
   and, in particular, that high pollinator dependence for plant
   reproduction, and associated pollen limitation, may contribute to
   subsequent interaction effects on reproduction in the focal species. (C)

Abstract = {{Interactions between plants and their pollinators are influenced by
   environmental heterogeneity, resulting in small-scale variations in
   interactions. This may influence pollinator co-existence and plant
   reproductive success. This study, conducted at the Estacao Biologica de
   Santa Lucia (EBSL), a remnant of the Atlantic Forest in southeastern
   Brazil, investigated the effect of small-scale spatial variations on the
   interactions between bromeliads and their pollinators. Overall,
   hummingbirds pollinated 19 of 23 bromeliad species, of which 11 were
   also pollinated by bees and/or butterflies. However, spatial
   heterogeneity unrelated to the spatial location of plots or bromeliad
   species abundance influenced the presence of pollinators. Hummingbirds
   were the most ubiquitous pollinators at the high-elevation transect,
   with insect participation clearly declining as transect elevation
   increased. In the redundancy analysis, the presence of the hummingbird
   species Phaethornis eurynome, Phaethornis squalidus, Ramphodon naevius,
   and Thalurania glaucopis, and the butterfly species Heliconius erato and
   Heliconius nattereri in each plot was correlated with environmental
   factors such as bromeliad and tree abundance, and was also correlated
   with horizontal diversity. Since plant-pollinator interactions varied
   within the environmental mosaics at the study site, this small-scale
   environmental heterogeneity may relax competition among pollinators, and
   may explain the high diversity of bromeliads and pollinators generally
   found in the Atlantic Forest. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{A pervasive hypothesis at the interface of ecology and evolution is that
   biotic interactions contribute to regional biodiversity by accelerating
   adaptation and speciation. We investigated this question in the context
   of closely related, bumble bee-pollinated plants (Pedicularis spp.) in
   the Hengduan Mountains of south-central China, where they exhibit
   spectacular levels of richness, endemism, and floral diversity. Because
   these species co-occur frequently, flower synchronously, and share
   pollinators during the brief reproductive season, we predict that
   pollinator-mediated interactions may influence their community assembly
   and evolutionary diversification. If disparity in floral traits reduces
   competitive interactions between species, as would happen if floral
   isolation mitigates reproductive interference caused by heterospecific
   pollen flow, then species with dissimilar flowers should co-occur more
   often, yielding greater floral diversity at local scales than expected
   by chance. Moreover, if such interactions have repeatedly driven
   character displacement, then floral traits should exhibit homoplasy, the
   phylogenetic signature of labile evolution. We present evidence
   supporting these predictions, and find that local species richness is
   best explained by a model including both floral diversity and
   phylogenetic distance. Our results suggest that a dynamic mosaic of
   pollinator-mediated interactions among Pedicularis in the Hengduan
   region promotes ecological sorting through recurrent selection against
   reproductive interference, causing rapid species turnover at local
   scales, and accelerating the rate of floral divergence among species.
   Together these processes may have contributed to the remarkable
   accumulation of florally diverse species of Pedicularis endemic to the
   Hengduan Mountains biodiversity hotspot.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees pollinate and forage on flowers of crop and wild plants in
   agricultural landscapes. These interactions may depend on landscape
   patterns and bumble bee traits. We studied the abundance, colony
   density, and foraging range in long-tongued Bombus diversus Smith and
   short-tongued B. hypocrita P,rez, and evaluated their visits to flowers
   of wild plants and cultivated kabocha squash (Cucurbita maxima
   Duchesne). In forests in a farmland, B. hypocrita workers were trapped
   more frequently in the canopy. Full-sibs determined by nuclear
   microsatellite genotypes among workers collected in the farmland showed
   higher colony density and a larger foraging radius in B. hypocrita (30.8
   km(-2) and 848 m) than in B. diversus (8.3 km(-2) and 723 m),
   respectively. Regarding wild plants, workers more frequently visited
   shallow flowers in B. hypocrita and deep flowers in B. diversus. These
   results suggest that bumble bees with different traits forage on
   different wild flowers in different habitats. Squash flowers were
   visited by both bumble bee species at similar frequency in the latter
   period of colony growth when males and new queens appeared. Composition
   of full-sib workers visiting squash and wild flowers did not depend on
   the number of collected workers of individual colonies, indicating that
   foraging on squash flowers was not associated with colony growth. Thus,
   growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies may be supported by
   various wild plants and cultivated squash, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The stigma, a structure which serves as a site for pollen receipt and
   germination, has been assumed to have evolved once, as a modification of
   carpels, in early angiosperms. Here it is shown that a functional stigma
   has evolved secondarily from modified tepals in some Albuca species
   (Hyacinthaceae).
   Deposition of pollen on Albuca floral organs by bees was recorded.
   Pollen germination and fruit set was measured in flowers that had pollen
   deposited solely on their tepals or had their tepal tips experimentally
   isolated or removed after pollination.
   Leafcutter bees deposit pollen onto the papillate apices of the inner
   tepals of Albuca flowers. Pollen germinates in tepal-derived fluid
   secreted 2 or 3 d after anthesis and pollen tubes subsequently penetrate
   the style during flower wilting. Application of cross-pollen to the
   inner tepal apices of A. setosa flowers led to high fruit set. No fruits
   were produced in pollinated flowers in which the inner tepals were
   mechanically isolated or removed.
   Pollen capture by tepals in the Albuca clade probably evolved in
   response to selection for floral morphology that maximizes the accuracy
   of pollen transfer. These findings show how pollination function can be
   transferred among floral organs, and shed light on how the original
   angiosperm stigma developed from sporophylls.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation produces sharp changes in the spatial configuration
   of remnant forest patches, which include the increasing influence of
   patch edges on the interior of forest patches (edge effects). Human
   activities responsible for forest fragmentation tend also to change the
   internal characteristics of remnant patches, for example, through the
   creation of gaps by selective logging. While edges and gaps can be
   expected to cause comparable changes in the micro-environmental
   conditions of the forest, their effects on forest-dwelling species and
   their interactions are not necessarily comparable. This study compares
   the effect of forest edges and anthropogenic gaps on the reproductive
   success of a self-incompatible epiphytic plant (Mitraria coccinea),
   mediated by changes in its relationship with mutualists (pollinators)
   and antagonists (flower larcenists). Mitraria coccinea's flowers are
   pollinated by hummingbirds and robbed by the bumblebee Bombus dahlbomii.
   Edges and gaps had comparable positive effects on flower production and
   fruit set; however, nectar robbing was up to sevenfold higher in patches
   with numerous gaps and resulted in lower reproductive success (fruit set
   and total fruit crop). Forest fragmentation studies should therefore
   avoid treating forest remnants as homogeneous units (i.e. focusing
   exclusively on their characteristics and connectivity), without taking
   into account the internal heterogeneity caused by anthropogenic
   pressures (e.g. gaps and edge effects).}},

Abstract = {{1.Conical cells in the petal epidermis are common across many diverse
   flowering plant species, and it was recently shown that in
   difficult-to-handle flowers, pollinators prefer conical cells because
   they increase grip. However, this does not explain the prevalence of
   conical cells amongst other, simpler, flowers. 2.The movement of objects
   is an integral part of the world and is of particular importance to bees
   because the relative motion of objects is essential to a bee's 3D
   vision. The motion of flowers can increase pollinator attraction;
   however, it also makes flowers more difficult for a bee to handle. This
   makes foraging more metabolically expensive. To explore whether conical
   petal cells make handling moving flowers easier, we tested bumblebee
   (Bombus terrestris) preference for conical- or flat-celled Petunia
   (Petunia hybrida) flowers under different conditions of motion. We also
   used differently coloured Petunia flowers to test how colour and
   visibility interact with tactile cues to form a pollinator's
   preferences. 3.Bees preferred to visit conical-celled Petunia flowers
   except when the conical-celled flowers were harder to detect visually.
   The bees then favoured flowers that were easier to detect. But when
   flowers were moving and more difficult to handle, bees always learned to
   favour conical-celled flowers, irrespective of visual difficulty. 4.By
   providing easier handling through better grip from conical cells, the
   plant can benefit from the natural visual attractant of flowers moving
   in the wind without losing pollinator preference for easier-to-handle
   flowers. Bee preference for conical-celled flowers when flowers are
   moving shows how plants can use conical petal cells to take advantage of
   an attractant that would otherwise decrease pollinator preference by
   making handling difficult (movement). The selective pressure from
   pollinators choosing conical-celled flowers when flowers are moving in
   the wind provides an explanation for the persistence of conical cells in
   so many diverse angiosperm species across evolutionary time.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed lethal and sublethal side-effects of Ludox TMA silica
   nanoparticles on a terrestrial pollinator, Bombus terrestris (Linnaeus),
   via a dietary exposure. Dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed that
   silica Ludox TMA nanoparticles remained in suspension in the drinking
   sugar water. Exposure of bumblebee microcolonies during 7 weeks to the
   different nanoparticle concentrations (high: 34, 170 and 340 mg/l and
   low: 34 and 340 mu g/l) did not cause worker mortality compared to the
   controls. Also no effect on the worker foraging behavior was observed
   after exposure to nanoparticles concentrations up to 340 mu g/l. In
   contrast, the high concentrations (>= 34 mg/l) resulted in a total loss
   of reproduction. Using histological analysis we confirmed severe midgut
   epithelial injury in intoxicated workers (>= 34 mg/l). Despite the fact
   that these concentrations are much higher than the predicted
   environmental concentrations, precaution is still needed as information
   regarding their fate in the terrestrial environment and their potency to
   bioaccumulate and biomagnificate is lacking.}},

   Visitation}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{180}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-166}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator responses to floral density have important implications for
   plant biology. In particular, a decline in pollinator visitation at low
   density can cause an Allee effect (a positive relation of fitness to
   density) in the plant population, which heightens that population's
   vulnerability to extinction. Empiricists have reported a variety of
   relations between flower or plant density and pollinator visitation
   rates. Here I develop and test a model that provides explanations for
   this diversity. The model assumes that pollinators distribute themselves
   between a focal patch of flowers and the surrounding environment so as
   to maximize foraging success. The resulting relation of per-flower
   visitation rate to focal-patch floral density is nonlinear, with
   positive effects at low floral densities and weaker or negative effects
   at higher densities. The relation is influenced by floral density in the
   surrounding environment and traits of both the plants and their
   pollinators. In a field experiment, floral density of Holocarpha virgata
   ssp. virgata had a nonlinear effect on per-flower visitation that was
   largely consistent with the model's predictions. By producing testable
   hypotheses based on biologically reasonable assumptions, this model
   serves as a starting point for explaining an important facet of
   plant-pollinator mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Oil-producing flowers related to oil-bee pollination
   are a major innovation in Neotropical and Mexican Iridaceae. In this
   study, phylogenetic relationships were investigated among a wide array
   of New World genera of the tribes Sisyrinchieae, Trimezieae and
   Tigridieae (Iridaceae: Iridoideae) and the evolution of floral glandular
   structures, which are predominantly trichomal elaiophores, was examined
   in relation to the diversification of New World Iridaceae.
   Methods Phylogenetic analyses based on seven molecular markers obtained
   from 97 species were conducted to produce the first extensive phylogeny
   of the New World tribes of subfamily Iridoideae. The resulting
   phylogenetic hypothesis was used to trace the evolutionary history of
   glandular structures present in the flowers of numerous species in each
   tribe. Hypotheses of differential diversification rates among lineages
   were also investigated using both topological and Binary-State
   Speciation and Extinction methods.
   Key Results and Conclusions Floral glandular structures and especially
   trichomal elaiophores evolved multiple times independently in the
   American tribes of Iridoideae. The distribution pattern of species
   displaying glandular trichomes across the phylogeny reveals lability in
   the pollination system and suggests that these structures may have
   played a significant role in the diversification of the Iridoideae on
   the American continent.}},

Abstract = {{A great variety of colours, shapes, scents, energy-rich rewards and
   other floral traits form an integrated system that increases pollination
   efficiency or reduces pollen loss. Flowers lacking energetic rewards
   possess a more elaborate morphology to ensure co-specific pollination.
   Despite the prevalence of deceptive species among Euro-Mediterranean
   orchids, the study of their floral micromorphology is still in its
   infancy. In this work, we examine the floral micromorphology of four
   sympatric species of the widespread Mediterranean genus Serapias.
   Electron microscopy (scanning, transmission) was performed on flowers of
   four sympatric species of the deceptive genus Serapias, the widespread
   S. cordigera, S. lingua, S. parviflora and S. vomeracea. Each species
   has a characteristic combination of specialized, secretory epidermal
   cells and trichomes on the labellum and, to a lesser extent, the petals.
   Serapias lingua is highly specialized in that it produces olfactory
   signals and has two types of trichome with secretory apical cells, one
   of which is also present in S. parviflora. In addition to striated,
   conical secretory cells, S. cordigera and S. vomeracea also have
   characteristic, atypical secretory trichomes with bilobulate or
   dome-like protuberances. The labellar micromorphology of S. lingua and
   S. parviflora is adapted for scent production, whereas S. vomeracea and
   S. cordigera possess trichomes that may also provide visual and/or
   tactile cues. Owing to the combined effect of the specific floral
   fragrance and labellar micromorphology in pollinator selection, the
   pollination ecology of Serapias spp. is even more specialized than
   previously thought. (c) 2012 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical

Abstract = {{1. Spatial and temporal availability of pollen helps shape bee foraging
   behaviour and productivity, which has been studied in great detail at
   the landscape level, but never in a diverse tropical forest. 2. To study
   the effect of spatio-temporal variation in resource distribution on
   pollen use and productivity, we identified pollen from spatially
   explicit nest collections of two generalist sweat bees, Megalopta
   genalis Meade-Waldo and M. centralis Friese, from Barro Colorado Island,
   Panama, a 50-ha forest dynamics plot during the 2007 dry and early wet
   seasons. Pollen from nests collected in 19981999 without spatial
   information was also identified. 3. Bees used pollen of at least 64
   species; many of these occurred in only one collection. The 2007
   collections contained pollen of 35 different species, but were dominated
   by five species, especially Hura crepitans L. and Pseudobombax
   septenatum (Jacq.) Dugand. 4. Temporal availability, but not distance
   from nest, influenced flower use at a 50-ha scale. 5. Body size was not
   associated with minimum flight distance as inferred from pollen
   collections. 6. Nest productivity and pollen diversity decreased from
   the dry to wet seasons, mirroring community-level availability of floral
   resources. 7. Results suggest that on a scale of 50 ha, bees are
   choosing certain host plant species regardless of distance from the
   nest, but adjusting foraging behaviour opportunistically based on the
   temporal availability of host flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Microhabitat selection based on abiotic factors was examined in five
   species of digger wasps (Sphex funerarius, Ammophila heydeni, Ammophila
   pubescens, Ammophila sabulosa, Bembix tarsata), four of which are of
   high conservation interest. All the study sites were located in areas
   affected by anthropogenic disturbance (reclaimed brown-coal mining
   areas, and railway dykes) in Central Europe. The individual species
   responded differentially to the variability in each of the physical
   characteristics measured, which resulted in site-specific exclusion of
   individual sphecid species. The sphecids were found to discriminate
   between available microhabitats based on ground inclination (slope) and
   vegetation cover. All but A. heydeni segregated the microhabitats
   according to the content of gravel and sand particles. S. funerarius and
   B. tarsata were limited by their preferences of low soil compactness,
   whereas A. pubescens utilized highly compacted soils, which were
   predominant in the study area. Soil shear strength (cohesiveness) was
   driving the level of gregariousness of the sphecids. In B. tarsata,
   number of cells per burrow was found to be higher in soils with
   increased penetration resistance. Experimental increase in soil
   compactness led to the abandonment of nesting microhabitats in the
   subsequent nesting seasons. Besides the well-known biotic factors, such
   as specialization at different size or type of prey, variability in
   abiotic factors between individual microhabitats (e.g. patches of sand)
   was found to be both necessary and sufficient to allow the parallel
   presence of viable populations of several sphecid species.}},

Abstract = {{Fragrance is a putatively important character in the evolution of
   flowering plants, but natural selection on scent is rarely studied and
   thus poorly understood. We characterized floral scent composition and
   emission in a common garden of Penstemon digitalis from three nearby
   source populations. We measured phenotypic selection on scent as well as
   floral traits more frequently examined, such as floral phenology,
   display size, corolla pigment, and inflorescence height. Scent differed
   among populations in a common garden, underscoring the potential for
   scent to be shaped by differential selection pressures. Phenotypic
   selection on flower number and display size was strong. However,
   selection favoured scent rather than flower size or colour, suggesting
   that smelling stronger benefits reproductive success in P.similar to
   digitalis. Linalool was a direct target of selection and its high
   frequency in floral-scent bouquets suggests that further studies of both
   pollinator- and antagonist-mediated selection on this compound would
   further our understanding of scent evolution. Our results indicate that
   chemical dimensions of floral display are just as likely as other
   components to experience selective pressure in a nonspecialized
   flowering herb. Therefore, studies that integrate visual and chemical
   floral traits should better reflect the true nature of floral
   evolutionary ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between landscape intensification, the abundance and
   diversity of pollinating insects, and their contributions to crop yield,
   quality, and market value are poorly studied, despite observed declines
   in wild and domesticated pollinators. Abundance and species richness of
   pollinating insects were estimated in ten fields of spring oilseed rape,
   Brassica napus var. SW Stratos (TM), located along a gradient of
   landscape compositions ranging from simple landscapes dominated by
   arable land to heterogeneous landscapes with extensive cover of
   semi-natural habitats. In each field, we assessed the contribution of
   wind and insect pollination to seed yield, seed quality (individual seed
   weight and oil and chlorophyll contents), and market value in a block
   experiment with four replicates and two treatments: (1) all flowers were
   accessible to insects, self and wind pollination, and (2) flowers
   enclosed in tulle net bags (mesh: 1 x 1 mm) were accessible only to wind
   and self pollination. Complex landscapes enhanced the overall abundance
   of wild insects as well as the abundance and species richness of
   hoverflies. This did not translate to a higher yield, probably due to
   consistent pollination by honey bees across all fields. However, the
   pollination experiment showed that insects increased seed weight per
   plant by 18\% and market value by 20\%. Seed quality was enhanced by
   insect pollination, rendering heavier seeds as well as higher oil and
   lower chlorophyll contents, clearly showing that insect pollination is
   required to reach high seed yield and quality in oilseed rape. Our study
   demonstrates considerable and previously underestimated contributions
   from pollinating insects to both the yield and the market value of
   oilseed rape.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees have been the focus of a broad range of scientific research
   due to their behavior, social life, and a number of other intriguing
   traits. Current methods for examining their nest structure, such as
   natal cells and contents of storage cells, are destructive in nature
   because the cells need to be opened for physical inspections. This
   research describes how the internal structures of the artificial nests
   of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris L. (Hymentoptera: Apidae) were
   non-invasively viewed and assessed by using diagnostic radioentomology.
   For the first time, B. terrestris nest structures, and their contents
   such as larvae, pupae and eggs, were non-invaseively viewed and
   assessed. This technique will enable future experiments to take
   morphological measurements of egg, larval, and pupal development over
   time. Moreover, combining these measurements with measures of
   food-storage will provide a good assessment of colony health. The method
   will also allow tracking of individually marked adults, to monitor their
   behaviour and help gain a better understanding of the processes involved
   in the global declines of B. terrestris, which will in turn promote
   better management of these valuable pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Influence of pollinators on seed production and quality of carrot and
   sweet pepper in a greenhouse
   Pollination is a fundamental process for the perpetuation of various
   plant species, and the development of fruits and seeds is directly
   related to the pollination of flowers. Thus, the aim of this study was
   to assess the influence of pollinators on seed production and quality of
   carrot and sweet pepper under greenhouse conditions. In the carrot
   study, plants were grown in cages, and the following treatments were
   used: pollination with Arapua (Trigona spinipes) bees, Jatai
   (Tetragonisca angustula) bees, Tibuna (Nannotrigona (Scaptotrigona)
   bipunctata) bees, flies (Musca domestica), hand pollination, and free
   pollination (outside the greenhouse). In the sweet pepper study, the
   following treatments were used: pollination with Arapua (Trigona
   spinipes) bees, Jatai (Tetragonisca angustula) bees, Marmelada
   (Frieseomellita varia) bees, hand pollination and free (self
   fertilization). The use of Jatai and Tibuna bees showed a great
   potential for carrot seed production in greenhouse conditions. For the
   production of sweet pepper seeds the use of pollinators is not
   necessary, but the presence of these agents increases the fruit weight.
   The physiological seed quality of both species was not influenced by
   different types of pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Partner abundance affects costs and benefits in obligate mutualisms, but
   its role in facultative partnerships is less clear. We address this gap
   in a pollination web consisting of two clovers (Trifolium) that differ
   in specialization on a bumble bee pollinator Bombus balteatus. We
   examine how pollination niche breadth affects plant responses to
   pollinator abundance, comparing early-flowering (specialized) and
   late-flowering (generalized) cohorts of T. parryi and early T. parryi to
   T. dasyphyllum, a pollination generalist. Co-pollinators disrupt the
   link between B. balteatus visitation and pollination rate for both
   clovers. Only for early-flowering T. parryi do visitation, pollination,
   and seed set increase with density of B. balteatus. Bumble bee density
   also alters timing of seed germination in T. parryi, with seeds from
   plants receiving augmented B. balteatus germinating sooner than seeds of
   open-pollinated counterparts. Benefits saturate at intermediate bumble
   bee densities. Despite strong effects of B. balteatus density on
   individual plant fitness components, population models suggest little
   impact of B. balteatus density on lambda in T. parryi or T. dasyphyllum.
   Findings show that functional redundancy in a pollinator guild mediates
   host-plant responses to partner density. Unexpected effects of
   pollinator density on life history schedule have implications for
   recruitment under pollinator decline.}},

Title = {{Complementary habitat use by wild bees in agro-natural landscapes}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1535-1546}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Human activity causes abrupt changes in resource availability across the
   landscape. In order to persist in human-altered landscapes organisms
   need to shift their habitat use accordingly. Little is known about the
   mechanisms by which whole communities persist in human-altered
   landscapes, including the role of complementary habitat use. We define
   complementary habitat use as the use of different habitats at different
   times by the same group of species during the course of their activity
   period. We hypothesize that complementary habitat use is a mechanism
   through which native bee species persist in human-altered landscapes. To
   test this idea, we studied wild bee communities in agro-natural
   landscapes and explored their community-level patterns of habitat and
   resource use over space and time. The study was conducted in six
   agro-natural landscapes in the eastern United States, each containing
   three main bee habitat types (natural habitat, agricultural fields, and
   old fields). Each of the three habitats exhibited a unique seasonal
   pattern in amount, diversity, and composition of floral resources, and
   together they created phenological complementarity in foraging resources
   for bees. Individual bee species as well as the bee community responded
   to these spatiotemporal patterns in floral availability and exhibited a
   parallel pattern of complementary habitat use. The majority of wild bee
   species, including all the main crop visitors, used fallow areas within
   crops early in the season, shifted to crops in mid-season, and used
   old-field habitats later in the season. The natural-forest habitat
   supported very limited number of bees, mostly visitors of non-crop
   plants. Old fields are thus an important feature in these arable
   landscapes for maintaining crop pollination services. Our study provides
   a detailed examination of how shifts in habitat and resource use may
   enable bees to persist in highly dynamic agro-natural landscapes, and
   points to the need for a broad cross-habitat perspective in managing
   these landscapes.}},

Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Alterations in land use and biological invasions are two major
   components of global change that threaten biodiversity. There is high
   concern about their impact on pollinators and the pollination services
   they provide. However, the growing literature shows different, even
   contradictory results. 2. We present a global meta-analysis of 58
   publications reporting 143 studies (37 on landscape alteration and 21 on
   biological invasions) to assess the extent to which these components
   affect pollinators, and whether taxonomic and ecosystem-type differences
   in pollinator responses occur. We also quantified which component of
   landscape alteration had the largest effect on pollinators and assessed
   whether animal invasions differ from plant invasions in their effect on
   native pollinators. 3. Habitat alteration and invasions affected
   pollinators to the same magnitude by decreasing visitation rates.
   Vertebrates in altered landscapes and insects (excluding bees) in
   invaded areas were the most affected pollinator taxa. 4. Pollinator
   abundance was more reduced in altered forest ecosystems than in altered
   grasslands; while the reverse pattern was found for pollinator richness.
   However, the response of pollinators to invasions was independent of
   ecosystem type. 5. Disturbance of the surrounding matrix was more
   important in decreasing pollinator visitation rates than fragment size.
   6. Invasive animals seemed to have a more consistent negative effect on
   visitation rates than invasive plants. 7. Synthesis. Our study
   highlights that different components of global change have similar
   negative outcomes on pollination patterns, but that responses of
   pollinators vary among taxa and ecosystem types, as well as the
   attributes of landscape alteration considered and whether the invader is
   an animal or a plant.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, both the genetic diversity and population genetic
   structure of Eufriesea violacea from six Atlantic Forest fragments,

   pairwise comparisons was found to be significantly different from zero,
   indicating from low to moderate genetic differentiation among
   populations. Considerably higher genetic differentiation values were
   revealed by the D (est) estimator, indicating very high levels of
   differentiation for some pairs of populations. The present results on
   the population structure of E. violacea suggest a restriction in gene
   flow among populations from different Atlantic Forest remnants. Thus,

Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{. 1. Many insect species vary in their degree of foraging
   specialisation, with many bee species considered polyphagic
   (polylectic). Wild, non-managed bee species vary in their conservation
   status, and species-specific biological traits such as foraging
   specialisation may play an important role in determining variance in
   population declines. Current agri-environment schemes (AESs) prescribe
   the introduction of flower seed mixes for agricultural systems to aid
   the conservation of wild bees. However, the extent to which flower
   combinations adequately meet bee foraging requirements is poorly known.
   2. We quantitatively assessed pollen use and selectivity using two
   statistical approaches: Baileys Intervals and Compositional Analysis, in
   an examplar species, a purportedly polylectic and rare bee, Colletes
   floralis, across 7 sites through detailed analysis of bee scopal pollen
   loads and flower abundance. 3. Both approaches provided good congruence,
   but Compositional Analysis was more robust to small sample sizes. We
   advocate its use for the quantitative determination of foraging
   behaviour and dietary preference. 4. Although C. floralis is polylectic,
   it showed a clear dietary preference for plants within the family
   Apiaceae. Where Apiaceae was uncommon, the species exploited alternative
   resources. Other plant families, such as the Apiaceae, could be
   included, or have their proportion increased in AES seed mixes, to aid
   the management of C. floralis and potentially other wild solitary bees
   of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination biology and factors affecting reproductive success of the
   federally endangered Echinacea laevigata (coneflower) were studied in
   one large and five small populations. Insect visitor exclusion from
   flowering heads and pollination treatments showed that seed production
   was 10x higher in open-pollinated treatments compared to bagged flowers
   that were not pollinated and 20x higher than flower heads receiving self
   pollen suggesting that cross-pollination was responsible for most seed
   production. Peak flowering occurred the 2nd-4th wk of Jun. 2004 and the
   large population contributed 50-68\% of the flowering individuals in its
   plant community. During this period, Bombus (Apidae, bumblebees),
   Hesperiidae (skippers), and Megachile (Megachilidae, leaf-cutter bees)
   accounted for 73\%, 12\%, and 11\% of the observed visits to coneflower,
   respectively. Species richness of coneflower flower visitors and number
   of flower visits was lower in each small population than in the large
   population. However, comparison of seed production between heads
   receiving supplemental pollen and open-pollination heads indicated that
   seed production was not pollen limited. In addition, over 93\% of pollen
   grains stained normally in cotton blue-lactophenol in all six
   populations suggesting that pollen viability was high in small and large
   populations. However, seed production in the large population exceeded
   that in each of three small populations during 2005, and seedling size
   was larger in the large population compared to seedlings from one of the
   small populations. Comparison of soil cation concentrations among
   populations suggested that cations did not limit seed production. We
   suggest that genetic factors, such as inbreeding or low S allele
   variation, may limit seed production in the small populations.}},

   The aim of this observational study was to determine the impact of
   surrounding pollen diversity on the health of honey bee colonies
   introduced in lowbush blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) in June
   and cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) in July. The results
   suggest that monocultures of lowbush blueberries are not suitable for
   optimal brood rearing. In the blueberry environments we studied, the
   dominant pollen collected by honey bees were Alnus Mill. spp. and
   Taraxacum officinale F. H. Wigg., which are deficient in some essential
   amino acids. Significant reduction of brood rearing during honey bees'
   stay in blueberry monocultures in June may, therefore, be explained by
   nutritional deficiencies. In July, the polliniferous flora in the
   vicinity of cranberry monocultures was poorer but of better nutritional
   quality. Pollen analysis allowed the identification of Brassicaceae,
   Trifolium L. spp., and V. macrocarpon as the three dominant taxa
   collected by honey bees during this period. The complete lists of plant
   taxa foraged by honey bees for pollen during the pollination of lowbush
   blueberries and cranberries are provided.}},

Abstract = {{The stingless bee Trigona spinipes (Fabricius, 1793) (Hymenoptera:
   Apidae) is an important pollinator for various crops, but constitutes an
   occasional pest of other plant species since it causes injury to leaves,
   stems, flowers and fruits while collecting nest materials. The aim of
   the present study was to determine the damage caused by T. spinipes to a
   broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. italica, Brassicaceae) growing on an
   organic farm. A significant number of plants (72.5 \%) presented damaged
   inflorescences, while 39\% of all of the inflorescences suffered some
   degree of injury. The activities of T. spinipes caused scarifications on
   the stems of the inflorescences, and these typically evolved to
   epidermal cicatrices up to 10 mm wide. In some cases, the lesions were
   sufficiently deep to cause partial destruction of the vascular tissues,
   and this lead to thinner (< 5 mm diameter) floral stems that may
   collapse. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report
   concerning the attack of broccoli plants by T. spinipes. The results
   obtained should serve to highlight the possibility that stingless bees
   could be responsible for direct and/or indirect damage to vegetable
   crops, and to stimulate the development of control strategies for these
   incidental pests.}},

Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{Unrelated plants pollinated by the same group or guild of animals
   typically evolve similar floral cues due to pollinator-mediated
   selection. Related plant species, however, may possess similar cues
   either as a result of pollinator-mediated selection or as a result of
   sharing a common ancestor that possessed the same cues or traits. In
   this study, visual and olfactory floral cues in Lysimachia species
   exhibiting different pollination strategies were analysed and compared,
   and the importance of pollinators and phylogeny on the evolution of
   these floral cues was determined. For comparison, cues of vegetative
   material were examined where pollinator selection would not be expected.
   Floral and vegetative scents and colours in floral oil- and non-floral
   oil-secreting Lysimachia species were studied by chemical and
   spectrophotometric analyses, respectively, compared between oil- and
   non-oil-secreting species, and analysed by phylogenetically controlled
   methods.
   Vegetative and floral scent was species specific, and variability in
   floral but not vegetative scent was lower in oil compared with non-oil
   species. Overall, oil species did not differ in their floral or
   vegetative scent from non-oil species. However, a correlation was found
   between oil secretion and six floral scent constituents specific to oil
   species, whereas the presence of four other floral compounds can be
   explained by phylogeny. Four of the five analysed oil species had
   bee-green flowers and the pattern of occurrence of this colour
   correlated with oil secretion. Non-oil species had different floral
   colours. The colour of leaves was similar among all species studied.
   Evidence was found for correlated evolution between secretion of floral
   oils and floral but not vegetative visual and olfactory cues. The cues
   correlating with oil secretion were probably selected by Macropis bees,
   the specialized pollinators of oil-secreting Lysimachia species, and may
   have evolved in order to attract these bees.}},

Abstract = {{Although divergent floral preferences of pollinating species is a likely
   mechanism maintaining integrity of co-occurring floral ecotypes or
   incipient species, reproductive isolation of floral morphs could also
   result from temporary floral constancy of shared pollinators.
   Context-dependent floral preferences have been demonstrated for many
   pollinating insects, suggesting that this behavior might be widespread.
   However, it is not yet known whether 2 plant species or morphotypes that
   share a single pollinator could be reproductively isolated through
   assortative visitation. We investigated the foraging behavior of the bee
   fly, Megapalpus capensis, in experimental arrays of distinct floral
   morphotypes of Gorteria diffusa, a South African daisy which is
   pollinated almost exclusively by M. capensis. Flies exhibited no
   intrinsic or context-dependent (according to prevailing morph)
   preference for floral variants nor do they display floral constancy
   behavior during visitation bouts. Thus, pollinator isolation through
   assortative visitation is an unlikely explanation for the maintenance of
   floral integrity across the narrow contact zones encountered in
   Gorteria. Despite random visitation patterns on arrays, flies exhibited
   different behaviors on different floral morphotypes, suggesting
   intrinsic responses to morphotype-specific floral cues. Our findings
   suggest that results of previous studies demonstrating labile
   preferences and constancy in insects such as bees and butterflies cannot
   necessarily be extrapolated to other important groups of pollinators. In
   pollinators, such as Megapalpus, which use flowers as arenas for
   multiple behaviors, including mating, and feed during long stationary
   bouts, learning constraints on flower handling time, the most widely
   accepted explanation for floral constancy, is unlikely to drive constant
   foraging behavior.}},

   unexpected: Nocturnal pollination of lowbush blueberry. Can. J. Plant
   Sci. 92: 707-711. Lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium, is an
   economically important crop of eastern North America that is critically
   dependent on insect-mediated cross-pollination for successful fruit set
   and high yields. It is generally assumed that bees are responsible for
   the vast majority of lowbush blueberry pollination, and producers
   usually augment the natural pollination force with managed bees. Little
   is known, however, of the potential role of nocturnal pollinators in
   lowbush blueberry production. We conducted a field experiment where
   patches of blooming blueberry were exposed to flying insects 24 h a day,
   only during the day (sunrise to sunset), only at night (sunset to
   sunrise), or 0 h a day. We found that significant fruit set occurred on
   blueberry stems that were exposed only at night, although it was higher
   on stems exposed during the day or 24 h a day. However, ripe fruit
   produced on stems exposed only at night weighed just as much as those
   exposed 24 h. Captures with Malaise traps activated only at night
   consisted mainly of several families of Lepidoptera and Diptera,
   although we do not know if these taxa pollinated blueberries. We
   conclude that nocturnal pollination may contribute significantly to
   lowbush blueberry fruit set.}},

Abstract = {{Floral scent composition and emission are often related to olfactory
   abilities, preferences and activity times of pollinating agents.
   However, most studies have focused on species with one pollinator type,
   and little is known about species with mixed pollination systems. We
   investigated the temporal variation in flower visitor activity and
   flower scent emission of Silene otites (Caryophyllaceae), a species
   regarded as being nocturnal and pollinated by moths and mosquitoes. We
   found, however, that S. otites is not only visited at night by moths and
   mosquitoes, but also by a wide range of day-active insects. Furthermore,
   both the intensity and composition of floral scent change during the
   course of the day. Total scent emission reached its maximum in the early
   hours of the night when compounds known to be attractants for moths
   and/or mosquitoes, such as lilac aldehyde, benzaldehyde,
   phenylacetaldehyde and 2-phenylethanol, dominated the scent. However,
   although less intensive, emission continued during the day. In the early
   morning, a-pinene, hotrienol, 2-phenylethanol and d-3-carene were the
   dominant scent compounds. (E)-beta-Ocimene, hotrienol and benzyl alcohol
   contributed proportions of at least 10\% before midday when flies, such
   as syrphids, were abundant flower visitors, whereas linalool and
   hotrienol contributed to the scent with at least 10\% each in the
   afternoon when bees also contributed to flower visits. We conclude that,
   in S. otites, the changing emission patterns are in tune with the
   olfactory abilities, preferences and activity times of its day- and
   night-active potentially pollinating flower visitors. (c) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Tribe Orchideae (Orchidaceae: Orchidoideae) comprises around 62 mostly
   terrestrial genera, which are well represented in the Northern Temperate
   Zone and less frequently in tropical areas of both the Old and New
   Worlds. Phylogenetic relationships within this tribe have been studied
   previously using only nuclear ribosomal DNA (nuclear ribosomal internal
   transcribed spacer, nrITS). However, different parts of the phylogenetic
   tree in these analyses were weakly supported, and integrating
   information from different plant genomes is clearly necessary in
   orchids, where reticulate evolution events are putatively common. The
   aims of this study were to: (1) obtain a well-supported and dated
   phylogenetic hypothesis for tribe Orchideae, (ii) assess appropriateness
   of recent nomenclatural changes in this tribe in the last decade, (3)
   detect possible examples of reticulate evolution and (4) analyse in a
   temporal context evolutionary trends for subtribe Orchidinae with
   special emphasis on pollination systems.
   The analyses included 118 samples, belonging to 103 species and 25
   genera, for three DNA regions (nrITS, mitochondrial cox1 intron and
   plastid rpl16 intron). Bayesian and maximum-parsimony methods were used
   to construct a well-supported and dated tree. Evolutionary trends in the
   subtribe were analysed using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods of
   character evolution.
   The dated phylogenetic tree strongly supported the recently
   recircumscribed generic concepts of Bateman and collaborators. Moreover,
   it was found that Orchidinae have diversified in the Mediterranean basin
   during the last 15 million years, and one potential example of
   reticulate evolution in the subtribe was identified. In Orchidinae,
   pollination systems have shifted on numerous occasions during the last
   23 million years.
   The results indicate that ancestral Orchidinae were
   hymenopteran-pollinated, food-deceptive plants and that these traits
   have been dominant throughout the evolutionary history of the subtribe
   in the Mediterranean. Evidence was also obtained that the onset of
   sexual deception might be linked to an increase in labellum size, and
   the possibility is discussed that diversification in Orchidinae
   developed in parallel with diversification of bees and wasps from the
   Miocene onwards.}},

Abstract = {{Plantpollinator interactions offer an excellent system to study the
   stability of mutualistic interactions. While nectar production requires
   resources and a reduction could in principle benefit plant fitness, only
   few angiosperms lack nectar, and thus cheat from a pollinator's
   perspective. Cheating behavior may be scarce because of pollinator
   foraging behaviors that select for nectariferous plants. Shorter
   inspection duration, interaction with fewer flowers, or even complete
   avoidance of plants with low/no nectar may reduce the fitness of
   cheating plants. The effectiveness of pollinator strategies may depend
   on how they are implemented. Innate strategies would invariably decrease
   the fitness of a cheating plant, while learned responses allow cheaters
   to exploit naive pollinators. Here, we studied the foraging strategies
   of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta during interactions with nectariferous and
   reward-minimized Petunia axillaris. We found that neither naive nor
   experienced hawkmoths discriminated a priori between rewarding and
   nectar-less plants. However, naive hawkmoths displayed reduced probing
   time per flower and number of flowers visited on reward-minimized plants
   during the first trial, without showing further improved discrimination
   with experience. In conclusion, the foraging decision rules of hawkmoths
   that may reduce the fitness of reward-minimized plants appear to be
   innate, with little scope for additional learning.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus Latreille) are an important group of social insects,
   well recognized throughout northern temperate regions as important
   pollinators of wild and agricultural plants. Little is known about the
   biology of this group in southern portions of the Americas, especially
   in Mesoamerica, a region of geological and ecological complexity from
   Mexico through Central America. One ubiquitous Mesoamerican species,
   Bombus ephippiatus, is enigmatic. Like many other Bombus, this species
   is homogeneous in body structure yet exhibits striking intraspecific
   color pattern polymorphism across its range, leading to uncertainty
   about its genealogical boundaries. It has been grouped taxonomically
   with B. wilmattae, a species narrowly restricted to southern Mexico and
   northern Guatamala. Furthermore, the relationships between these two
   taxa and a third species, B. impatiens, found only in America north of
   Mexico, have been controversial. Our phylogenetic analysis of DNA
   sequences from mitochondrial COI and nuclear PEPCK and CAD resolves the
   phylogeny of these three taxa as (B. impatiens, (B. ephippiatus, B.
   wilmattae)). Additional data from eight nuclear microsatellite markers
   reveal complex patterns of genetic divergence and isolation among
   populations of B. ephippiatus across its extensive geographic range,
   providing evidence for multiple independent evolutionary lineages. These
   lineages correspond not only to geographic and habitat variation across
   their range, but also to distinct color pattern groups present in the
   species. Knowledge of the phylogeny and genetic divergence of the B.
   ephippiatus group will provide a framework for understanding
   evolutionary and ecological origins of color pattern polymorphism in
   bumble bees, as well as providing insight into geographical factors
   enhancing speciation in Mesoamerica. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Hallucinogenic or toxic species of Brunfelsia (Solanaceae: Petunieae)
   are important in native cultures throughout South America, and the genus
   also contains several horticulturally important species. An earlier
   morphological revision of the c. 50 species recognized three main
   groups, one consisting of the 23 Antillean species, another of southern
   South American and Andean species, and a third of species from the
   Amazon Basin and Guiana Shield. Based on plastid and nuclear DNA
   sequences from up to 65 accessions representing 80\% of the species, we
   generated a phylogeny and a calibrated chronogram for Brunfelsia to
   infer clade expansion and shifts in pollinators and fruit types.
   Brunfelsia flowers offer nectar, and attract lepidoptera, hummingbirds,
   or bees; the fruits are dry or fleshy, Our results imply that Brunfelsia
   is 16-21 Myr old and entered the Antilles from South America early
   during its history, with subsequent expansion along the island arc. The
   ancestor of the Antillean clade was hawk-moth-pollinated and had fleshy
   capsules, perhaps facilitating dispersal by birds. The only shift to
   hummingbird pollination occurred on Cuba, which also harbors the largest
   single radiation, with 11 species (10 included in our study) that
   apparently arose over the past 4 Myr. Jamaica, Hispaniola, and Puerto
   Rico each sustained smaller radiations. The data also reveal at least
   one new species. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two taxonomically undescribed Colocasiomyia species were discovered from
   inflorescences of Alocasia macrorrhizos in Kota Kinabalu City, Sabah,
   Borneo, Malaysia. The aims of this study were to investigate the
   reproductive ecology of the flies and the plant, ascertain the
   importance of the flies as pollinators and examine the intimate
   association between flowering events and life history of the flies. We
   conducted sampling, observations and field pollination experiments. The
   flies were attracted by the odour of female-phase inflorescences in the
   early morning on the first day of anthesis. They fed, mated and
   oviposited in the inflorescences for 1 day. On the second day, the
   flies, covered with pollen grains, left the male-phase inflorescences
   for the next female-phase inflorescences. The immature forms of both fly
   species hatched, developed and pupated within the infructescences
   without damaging the fruits, and developed adults emerged when the
   mature infructescences dehisced. The flowering events and fly behaviours
   were well synchronized. In field pollination experiments, inflorescences
   bagged with a fine mesh (insect exclusion) produced almost no fruits,
   whereas those bagged with a coarse mesh (bee exclusion) produced as many
   fruits as the open-pollinated controls. These results indicate that
   these flies are the most efficient and specialised pollinators for their
   host, A. macrorrhizos. These flies, in return, depend on A. macrorrhizos
   for food and habitat through most of their life cycle. This study
   provides a deeper insight into the less recognised, highly intimate
   pollination mutualism between Araceae plants and Colocasiomyia flies.}},

Abstract = {{In social insects, the reproductive strategies adopted by colonies
   emerge as a complex property of individual behaviours, but as yet we are
   often unable to fully explain them in evolutionary terms. In bumblebees,
   colonies adopt either a short-lived strategy specializing in male
   production, or a longer-lived strategy in which mainly new queens are
   produced, but this results in males emerging long before mates are
   available; this strategy can only easily be explained if older males are
   at a significant reproductive advantage. Here we examine how age and
   morphological characters influence mating success of male bumblebees. In
   two separate experiments in which single virgin males and females were
   confined together, we found that young males and heavy males mated more
   swiftly and copulated for less time compared to old males or lighter
   males, respectively. However, in competitive situations age proved to be
   unimportant and the only factors to influence mating success were the
   lengths of the fore and hind tibiae, with strong directional selection
   for long leg length. Fore and hind legs are both used in courtship, so
   both traits are associated with plausible mechanisms under selection. It
   has previously been argued that, in times of food stress, bumblebee
   colonies should produce males as male size is less likely to be strongly
   correlated with fitness than female size. Our results suggest that this
   may not be so, since aspects of male size directly impact on their
   mating success. Our results leave unexplained the emergence of males
   many days before new queens.}},

Abstract = {{Although the tremendous variability in floral colour among angiosperms
   is often attributed to divergent selection by pollinators, it is usually
   difficult to preclude the possibility that floral colour shifts were
   driven by non-pollinator processes. Here, we examine the adaptive
   significance of flower colour in Disa ferruginea, a non-rewarding orchid
   that is thought to attract its butterfly pollinator by mimicking the
   flowers of sympatric nectar-producing species. Disa ferruginea has red
   flowers in the western part of its range and orange flowers in the
   eastern part-a colour shift that we hypothesized to be the outcome of
   selection for resemblance to different local nectar-producing plants.
   Using reciprocal translocations of red and orange phenotypes as well as
   arrays of artificial flowers, we found that the butterfly Aeropetes
   tulbaghia, the only pollinator of the orchid, preferred both the red
   phenotype and red artificial flowers in the west where its main nectar
   plant also has red flowers, and both the orange phenotype and orange
   artificial flowers in the east, where its main nectar plant has orange
   flowers. This phenotype by environment interaction demonstrates that the
   flower colour shift in D. ferruginea is adaptive and driven by local
   colour preference in its pollinator.}},

Title = {{Floral humidity as a reliable sensory cue for profitability assessment
   by nectar-foraging hawkmoths}},

   AMERICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},

Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Most research on plant-pollinator communication has focused on sensory
   and behavioral responses to relatively static cues. Floral rewards such
   as nectar, however, are dynamic, and foraging animals will increase
   their energetic profit if they can make use of floral cues that more
   accurately indicate nectar availability. Here we document such a
   cue-transient humidity gradients-using the night blooming flowers of
   Oenothera cespitosa (Onagraceae). The headspace of newly opened flowers
   reaches levels of about 4\% above ambient relative humidity due to
   additive evapotranspirational water loss through petals and
   water-saturated air from the nectar tube. Floral humidity plumes differ
   from ambient levels only during the first 30 min after anthesis (before
   nectar is depleted in wild populations), whereas other floral traits
   (scent, shape, and color) persist for 12-24 h. Manipulative experiments
   indicated that floral humidity gradients are mechanistically linked to
   nectar volume and therefore contain information about energy rewards to
   floral visitors. Behavioral assays with Hyles lineata (Sphingidae) and
   artificial flowers with appropriate humidity gradients suggest that
   these hawkmoth pollinators distinguish between subtle differences in
   relative humidity when other floral cues are held constant. Moths
   consistently approached and probed flowers with elevated humidity over
   those with ambient humidity levels. Because floral humidity gradients
   are largely produced by the evaporation of nectar itself, they represent
   condition-informative cues that facilitate remote sensing of floral
   profitability by discriminating foragers. In a xeric environment, this
   level of honest communication should be adaptive when plant reproductive
   success is pollinator limited, due to intense competition for the
   attention of a specialized pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Four North American bumble bee species in the subgenus Bombus sensu
   stricto, including Bombus occidentalis (Hymenoptera: Apidae), are
   experiencing dramatic declines in population abundance, geographic range
   and genetic diversity. The prevailing hypothesis concerning their
   decline is the transmission of the intracellular fungal pathogen, Nosema
   bombi (Microsporida), and other pathogen species from commercially
   reared bumble bees to wild populations. While N. bombi incidence has
   been investigated in the contiguous U.S.A. and Canada, virtually nothing
   is known about the status of Alaskan bumble bees. This study presents
   the distribution and relative abundance of B. occidentalis and B.
   moderatus, two co-occurring species in the subgenus Bombus sensu
   stricto, in Alaska and the prevalence of N. bombi detected in these
   species. Bombus occidentalis and B. moderatus accounted for 28\% and 4\%
   of the 942 bumble bees surveyed, respectively. Bombus occidentalis was
   the most abundant species collected in the survey and prevalence of N.
   bombi infections (44\% infected) was also highest in this species. The
   proportion of infected B. moderatus did not differ significantly from
   other co-occurring bumble bees. Despite the presence of N. bombi
   infections, both Bombus s. str. species were commonly detected in Alaska
   with our survey method. Alaskan bumble bee populations may thus provide
   important insights on the role of pathogens, particularly N. bombi, in
   bumble bee decline in the contiguous U.S.A.}},

Abstract = {{Managed and wild colonies of common eastern bumble bee (Bombus impatiens
   Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Apidae) are effective pollinators of wild
   blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton) (Ericaceae) in Atlantic
   Canada. Because insecticides are used during bloom to manage insect
   pests, bumble bees may be at risk of exposure. We therefore assessed the
   susceptibility of B. impatiens to some insecticides used or projected
   for use in blueberry pest management. Workers were killed by topical
   applications of spinosad, spinetoram, deltamethrin, and phosmet, but not
   flubendiamide. Similarly, when ingested in honey solution, spinetoram
   and deltamethrin were toxic, whereas flubendiamide did not cause
   mortality up to double its recommended label rate. In another
   experiment, workers were fed one sublethal dose of contaminated honey
   solution and placed in microcolonies to assess impacts on feeding, life
   span, and reproduction. The highest concentration of deltamethrin (17 mg
   a.i./L) reduced feeding. Workers treated with deltamethrin had shortened
   life spans and produced fewer males. Flubendiamide (2000 mg a.i./L) and
   spinetoram (0.8 mg a.i./L) caused no sublethal effects. These results
   indicate that flubendiamide should be safe to apply to blueberries where
   B. impatiens is foraging, while some other insecticides we tested may be
   hazardous under different exposure scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Several North American bumblebee species have recently undergone
   dramatic declines. The use of managed, pathogen-carrying bumblebees for
   pollination of greenhouse crops began shortly before these declines, and
   wild bumblebees near greenhouses now have high pathogen loads. This has
   led to speculation that pathogen spillover from commercial bumblebees
   caused declines of these species. We test this hypothesis using a large
   dataset of bumblebee occurrence records and agricultural census data. We
   find support for the pathogen spillover hypothesis for two species but
   no evidence that pathogen spillover caused the near disappearance of the
   previously widespread Bombus affinis. Furthermore, we show that
   pesticide use and habitat loss are unlikely to be major causes of
   decline for any of the Bombus species examined. Collectively, our
   analyses underscore that there remains an urgent need to identify causes
   of pollinator population losses.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) is among the plants highly dependent on
   insect-mediated pollination, but little is known about its unmanaged
   pollinators. Both domestic and wild bee populations in central Wisconsin
   pickling cucumber fields were assessed using a combination of pan
   trapping and floral observations before and during bloom. Together with
   land cover analyses extending 2,000 m from field centers, the
   relationship of land cover components and bee abundance and diversity
   were examined. Over a 2-yr sample interval distributed among 18
   experimental sites, 3,185 wild bees were collected representing >60
   species. A positive association was found between both noncrop and
   herbaceous areas with bee abundance and diversity only during bloom.
   Response of bee abundance and diversity to land cover was strongest at
   larger buffers presumably because of the heterogeneous nature of the
   landscape and connectivity between crop and noncrop areas. These results
   are consistent with previous research that has found a weak response of
   wild bees to surrounding vegetation in moderately fragmented areas. A
   diverse community of wild bees is present within the fields of a
   commercial cucumber system, and there is evidence of floral visitation
   by unmanaged bees. This evidence emphasizes the importance of wild
   pollinators in fragmented landscapes and the need for additional
   research to investigate the effectiveness of individual species in
   pollen deposition.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1331-1339}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most species of Dalechampia vines (Euphorbiaceae) attract bee
   pollinators with terpenoid resins secreted by a gland-like structure in
   the inflorescence. In some species, pollinating bees appear to
   preferentially visit inflorescences (blossoms) with large
   resin-producing glands, whereas in other species bees preferentially
   visit blossoms with large involucral bracts. In this study, the
   reliability of bract and gland size as signals of the quantity of resin
   produced in one species, D. scandens, was assessed. Whether resin
   secretion has a cost with respect to the number or mass of the seeds
   produced by a blossom was also examined.
   Measurements were made of bract size, gland size and the amount of resin
   secreted by blossoms of D. scandens maintained in a common environment,
   and the relationships between these traits were analysed. Resin
   production was also manipulated, and the effects of the manipulation
   were tested on seed set and seed mass.
   The amount of resin produced was better predicted by the size of the
   gland than by the size of the bract. Furthermore, when the effect of
   gland size was accounted for, bract size only weakly predicted the
   amount of resin produced. Neither an increase in resin secretion (by
   daily removal of the resin) nor a decrease (by removal of the resin
   gland) affected seed set or seed mass detectably, but resin production
   correlated positively with mean seed mass at the individual level once
   the size of the resin gland was accounted for.
   Gland size is a better indicator of the amount of reward than bract
   size, although the latter remained an honest signal of the quantity of
   resin produced. Resin secretion has no detectable cost in terms of seed
   production, but may be condition dependent, as suggested by a positive
   correlation with seed mass at the individual level.}},

Abstract = {{Communities of flower flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), bees (Hymenoptera:
   Apoidea), and flowering plants were compared between harvested and
   unharvested hardwood stands in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario,
   Canada. Group-selection silviculture (where groups of trees are removed
   from a forested matrix, rather than single trees), increased the
   abundance of pollinators and flowering stems, but only after leaf-out.
   Wild red raspberry () and bees benefitted most from the creation of
   canopy gaps. The combination of increased light, warm, bare soils, and
   abundant nectar-rich raspberry flowers probably created ideal habitat
   for soil-nesting bees, factors which are relatively absent from
   unharvested stands. By contrast, before leaf-out, spring ephemerals and
   high light-levels were universal and pollinators were even across
   treatments. More pollinators were caught in canopy gaps than in forested
   areas, and the proportion of fertilized ovules of spring beauty () was
   higher in gaps than in the forest, suggesting that pollinators prefer
   foraging in gaps, even in spring. Group-selection silviculture in
   hardwood forests proved beneficial to native pollinating insects, at

Abstract = {{A very well-documented case of flower-beetle interaction is the
   association in the Mediterranean region between red bowl-shaped flowers
   and beetles of the family Glaphyridae. The present study examines the
   visual mechanisms by which Pygopleurus israelitus (Glaphyridae:
   Scarabaeoidea: Coleoptera) would perceive the colors of flowers they
   visit by characterizing the spectral sensitivity of its photoreceptors.
   Our measurements revealed the presence of three types of photoreceptors,
   maximally sensitive in the UV, green and red areas of the spectrum.
   Using color vision space diagrams, we calculated the distribution of
   beetle-visited flower colors in the glaphyrid and honeybee color space
   and evaluated whether chromatic discrimination differs between the two
   types of pollinators. Respective color loci in the beetle color space
   are located on one side of the locus for green foliage background,
   whereas in the honeybee the flower color loci surround the locus
   occupied by green foliage. Our results represent the first evidence of a
   red sensitive photoreceptor in a flower-visiting coleopteran species,
   highlighting Glaphyridae as an interesting model group to study the role
   of pollinators in flower color evolution.}},

   individuals per m(2)) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots
   (1.3 individuals per m(2)). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest
   in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7\%) with four mowing events
   per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on
   subplots with a low management intensity (2.4\%) comprising two mowing
   events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators
   benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two
   mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of
   flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with
   enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation.
   Our results indicate that even in grasslands with high plant species
   richness, mowing and fertilization are more important drivers of
   herbivory and flower visitation by pollinators. Management with no more
   than two cuts per year and without fertilizer application in our
   grasslands balanced the ecosystem functions of increased pollination and
   decreased herbivory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The variability of bee communities along an urban gradient has a
   potentially strong impact on pollinator-plant interactions. We
   investigated changes in bee species richness and community composition
   in the city centre and suburbs of PoznaA{''}, Poland. During 2006-2008
   we recorded 2,495 individuals from 104 species. The most abundant
   species was . Other abundant species were , , , . Several species
   appeared to be more abundant in the city centre whereas others showed an
   opposite tendency. We have found that the urbanized landscape can act as
   a filter for the bee community since some specific ecological traits
   facilitate colonization of the city centre. Small-bodied species that
   start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred
   the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained
   stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a
   city dwelling bee. We suggest that a city can be a very important
   habitat for a diverse bee fauna and that conservation of a wide range of
   habitats of different urbanization levels seems to be the most suitable
   strategy for conservation of bee diversity in cities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{345-354}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Colour is an important attractant for many flower-visiting insects
   (anthophiles). Consequently, coloured pan trapping is an efficient
   technique that can be easily and cost-effectively used to quantitatively
   sample assemblages of anthophiles. However, colour preferences of
   anthophiles is an important source of bias that needs to be considered
   in pan trap surveys. By drawing sub samples comprised of different
   colour combinations from a database of pan trap surveys in the lowlands
   of the Cape Floristic Region, we examine the effects of colour on pan
   trap catches and determine which combinations of colours might provide
   better estimates of diversity when sampling with multi-colour sets of
   pan traps. Pan trap catches included the major groups of anthophiles in
   the region (Coleoptera, Diptera and Hymenoptera), but butterflies
   (Lepidoptera) were strongly under-represented. Colour played an
   important role in determining the species richness and composition of
   pan trap catches, with colour sets that included high reflectance yellow
   and white generally having catches with the highest species richness.
   While all colour combinations provided reasonable estimates of
   proportional species richness, proportional abundance of taxa varied
   among different colour sets, and did not accurately reflect actual
   proportions of different taxa in the entire dataset. For comparative
   biodiversity surveys and assessments we recommend the use of high
   reflectance colours such as white and yellow traps, while for full
   inventory surveys, it may be necessary to include other colours to catch
   rarer species that are excluded by the high reflectance colours alone.}},

Abstract = {{The orchid bees are a very important group of pollinators distributed in
   the Neotropics. Although a lot of studies concerning male euglossine
   bees have been done in this region, few works have so far been carried
   out in the Cerrado biome. This manuscript has the main objective to
   present the orchid bee community from a Gallery Forest in the
   Northeastern Brazilian Cerrado landscape, taking account the species
   composition, abundance, seasonality and hourly distribution. Male
   euglossine bees were collected monthly from October 2007 to May 2009, in
   the Reserva Florestal da Itamacaoca belonging to the Companhia de Agua e
   Esgoto do Maranhao, in Chapadinha municipality, Maranhao State. The
   scents eucalyptol, eugenol and vanillin were utilized, between 07:00 and
   17:00hr, to attract the euglossine males. Cotton balls were dampened
   with the scents and suspended by a string on tree branches 1.5m above
   soil level, set 8m from one another. The specimens were captured with
   entomological nets, killed with ethyl acetate and transported to the
   laboratory to be identified. A total of 158 individuals and 14 species
   of bees were recorded. The genus Eulaema was the most representative
   group of euglossine bees in relation to the total number of the sampled
   individuals, accounting for 50.6\% of bees followed by Euglossa
   (26.6\%), Eufriesea (15.2\%) and Exaerete (7.6\%). The most frequent
   species were Eulaema nigrita (27.8\%), Eulaema cingulata (19\%) and
   Euglossa cordata (18.3\%). Many species typical of forested environments
   were found in samples, like Euglossa avicula, Euglossa violaceifrons and
   Eulaema meriana, emphasizing the role played by the Gallery Forests as
   bridge sites to connect the two great biomes of Amazonia and Atlantic
   Forest. The occurrence of Exaerete guaykuru represents the second record
   of this species for the Neotropical region, and both records coming from
   the Gallery Forest zones. The male euglossine bees were sampled mainly
   in the dry season, where 62.5\% of the individuals were collected in
   that period. Eufriesea species appeared at the baits only in the wet
   season. The hourly frequency of bees at scent baits showed a clear
   preference for the morning period, where 87.9\% visited the baits from
   07:00 to 12:00hr. The euglossine bee fauna found in the Northeastern
   Maranhao Cerrado is represented chiefly by species of large geographic
   distribution and by some forest bee species, where their occurrence is
   maybe related to to the environmental conditions supported by the
   Gallery Forest ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Centris (Wagenknechtia) muralis Burmeister is one of the most common bee
   species distributed in the xeric region of Argentina. This work
   describes macro-and micromorphological aspects of the nesting
   architecture and the stages involved in the process of nesting of C.
   muralis bee, in the adobe walls of Capayan ruins and recent earthen
   constructions in Udpinango and Villa Castelli, La Rioja, Argentina. In
   addition, we discuss the possible factors that may explain the high
   density of nests observed in the adobe walls of Capayan ruins. These
   constructions are settled in the northern area of the Monte desert. Our
   analysis showed that the nest cell walls are strengthened and
   waterproofed probably by the admixture of organic material to the adobe
   matrix. Light microscopy of thin sections of the vacated cells showed
   the inner layers of organic material corresponding to the cocoon, and
   the outer layer of 0.7 mm thick corresponding to the cell walls
   consisting mainly of silt and clay, fine sand grains in low rate and
   absence of grains of sand medium and large. The cell wall was not
   different in its granulometry from that in the adobe brick, thus
   suggesting that the cell wall was constructed probably by cementing the
   particles with bee secretion. The scanning micrographs showed that the
   cell walls and non-nesting zones exhibited abundant clay crystals in the
   grain distribution. Pollen from Larrea sp. was observed in high
   proportions in the nest contents of C. muralis in the Capayan adobe
   walls.}},

   2012: Biodiversity of wild alfalfa pollinators and their temporal
   foraging characters in Hexi Corridor, Northwest China. - Entomol.
   Fennica 23: 4-12.
   Seed production of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is important in
   determining the effective distribution of new cultivars to farmers.
   However, little is known about the biodiversity and their community
   function of native wild pollinators of alfalfa in agronomic systems. We
   investigated the biodiversity of insects which visited alfalfa flowers
   and their temporal foraging characters in Hexi Corridor, China. A high
   biodiversity of insect visitors was discovered, 20 insect taxa in all,
   including 13 species of Hymenoptera, 3 species of Coleoptera, 3 species
   of Lepidoptera and 1 species of Diptera. Three native bee species,
   Andrena squamata, Anthophora melanognatha and Megachile abluta, were
   validated as the principal pollinators. They showed significant
   variations in tripping mode and their diurnal distribution patterns. Our
   results indicated that the native wild bees are diverse and they
   complement each other. This means they have developed a more complex
   system for the pollination of alfalfa than has been previously found
   out.

Title = {{Organic Farming and Landscape Structure: Effects on Insect-Pollinated
   Plant Diversity in Intensively Managed Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Parallel declines in insect-pollinated plants and their pollinators have
   been reported as a result of agricultural intensification. Intensive
   arable plant communities have previously been shown to contain higher
   proportions of self-pollinated plants compared to natural or
   semi-natural plant communities. Though intensive grasslands are
   widespread, it is not known whether they show similar patterns to arable
   systems nor whether local and/or landscape factors are influential. We
   investigated plant community composition in 10 pairs of organic and
   conventional dairy farms across Ireland in relation to the local and
   landscape context. Relationships between plant groups and local factors
   (farming system, position in field and soil parameters) and landscape
   factors (e. g. landscape complexity) were investigated. The percentage
   cover of unimproved grassland was used as an inverse predictor of
   landscape complexity, as it was negatively correlated with habitat-type
   diversity. Intensive grasslands (organic and conventional) contained
   more insect-pollinated forbs than non-insect pollinated forbs. Organic
   field centres contained more insect-pollinated forbs than conventional
   field centres. Insect-pollinated forb richness in field edges (but not
   field centres) increased with increasing landscape complexity (\%
   unimproved grassland) within 1, 3, 4 and 5 km radii around sites,
   whereas non-insect pollinated forb richness was unrelated to landscape
   complexity. Pollination systems within intensive grassland communities
   may be different from those in arable systems. Our results indicate that
   organic management increases plant richness in field centres, but that
   landscape complexity exerts strong influences in both organic and
   conventional field edges. Insect-pollinated forb richness, unlike that
   for non-insect pollinated forbs, showed positive relationships to
   landscape complexity reflecting what has been documented for bees and
   other pollinators. The insect-pollinated forbs, their pollinators and
   landscape context are clearly linked. This needs to be taken into
   account when managing and conserving insect-pollinated plant and
   pollinator communities.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization of natural habitats is considered to have large impacts on
   local plant populations and their associated pollinator faunas, which
   are expected to cause changes in both plant-pollinator interactions and
   increased pollen limitation. This study investigated the effects of
   increasing intensity of urban land use on pollinator diversity, flower
   visitation rates and reproductive success in Digitalis purpurea. To this
   end, we set up experimental populations of D. purpurea in three
   urban-rural gradients and contrasted these against two large, natural
   populations. In the experimental populations we quantified the number of
   flower visits per 20 min and applied supplemental hand-pollinations to
   determine the impact of pollen limitation on fruit-level seed set. We
   found no impact of urbanization intensity on pollinator diversity at all
   locations studied, and also the number of flower visits did not differ
   significantly between urban and rural populations. Reproductive success
   appeared, however, pollen limited in all sites, even in the large and
   optimal reference populations. This led us to conclude that the pollen
   limitation was caused by a bet-hedging strategy of the species rather
   than by insufficient pollination. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Accurately estimating the contribution of pollinators to production in
   crop species is important but could be challenging for species that are
   widely cultivated. One factor that may influence the
   pollinator-production relationship across regions is phenology, or the
   timing of recurring biological events, because crop phenology can be
   proximately controlled by climatic variables and phenology can affect
   plant reproductive success. For the economically important crop, coffee
   (), at least three aspects of flowering phenology (onset, density and
   frequency) are influenced by precipitation, which varies across coffee's
   cultivated range. Of these aspects of flowering phenology, flower
   density may particularly impact production in coffee because
   high-density flowering can severely limit outcrossing which is a major
   contributor to high yields and larger, high quality beans. We studied
   the coffee plant-pollinator interaction over 3 years and across two
   distinct types of coffee blooms: (1) low-density, synchronous flowering
   and (2) high-density, synchronous (mass) flowering. Bee species richness
   was similar for four out of five flowering periods (9.8 +/- A 2.7 95\%
   CI), but nearly tripled during one high-density flowering period (26 +/-
   A 8.6 95\% CI). During low-density flowering coffee fruit set rates were
   varied, but when coffee flowered at high-density, initial fruit set
   rates remained close to 60\% (the rate obtained from manual
   self-pollination of coffee flowers in pollination experiments). We
   discuss how changing precipitation patterns may alter coffee flowering
   phenology and the coffee plant-pollinator relationship, providing
   insight into how climate change may influence this interaction as well
   as the resultant coffee production.}},

Abstract = {{Mutualisms are well known to influence individual fitness and the
   population dynamics of partner species, but little is known about
   whether they influence species distributions and the location of
   geographic range limits. Here, we examine the contribution of
   plant-pollinator interactions to the geographic range limit of the
   California endemic plant Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana. We show that
   pollinator availability declined from the center to the margin of the
   geographic range consistently across four years of study. This decline
   in pollinator availability was caused to a greater extent by variation
   in the abundance of generalist rather than specialist bee pollinators.
   Climate data suggest that patterns of precipitation in the current and
   previous year drove variation in bee abundance because of its effects on
   cues for bee emergence in the current year and the abundance of floral
   resources in the previous year. Experimental floral manipulations showed
   that marginal populations had greater outcross pollen limitation of
   reproduction, in parallel with the decline in pollinator abundance.
   Although plants are self-compatible, we found no evidence that
   autonomous selfing contributes to reproduction, and thus no evidence
   that it alleviates outcross pollen limitation in marginal populations.
   Furthermore, we found no association between the distance to the range
   edge and selfing rate, as estimated from sequence and microsatellite
   variation, indicating that the mating system has not evolved in response
   to the pollination environment at the range periphery. Overall, our
   results suggest that dependence on pollinators for reproduction may be
   an important constraint limiting range expansion in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the availability of food resources over space and time is a
   likely driver of how landscape structure and composition affect animal
   populations. Few studies, however, have directly assessed the
   spatiotemporal variation in resource availability that arises from
   landscape pattern, or its effect on populations and population dynamic
   parameters. We tested the effect of floral resource availability at the
   landscape scale on the numbers of worker, male, and queen offspring
   produced by bumble bee, Bombus vosnesenskii, colonies experimentally
   placed within complex agricultural-natural landscapes. We quantified
   flower densities in all land use types at different times of the season
   and then used these data to calculate spatially explicit estimates of
   floral resources surrounding each colony. Floral availability strongly
   correlated with landscape structure, and different regions of the
   landscape showed distinct seasonal patterns of floral availability. The
   floral resources available in the landscape surrounding a colony
   positively affected the number of workers and males it produced.
   Production was more sensitive to early- than to later-season resources.
   Floral resources did not significantly affect queen production despite a
   strong correlation between worker number and queen number among
   colonies. No landscape produced high floral resources during both the
   early and late season, and seasonal consistency is likely required for
   greater queen production. Floral resources are important determinants of
   colony growth and likely affect the pollination services provided by
   bumble bees at a landscape scale. Spatiotemporal variation in floral
   resources across the landscape precludes a simple relationship between
   resources and reproductive success as measured by queens, but
   nonetheless likely influences the total abundance of bumble bees in our
   study region.}},

Abstract = {{Pedicularis (Orobranchaceae) is a common high altitude genus of the
   Himalayas that may be affected by pollination limitation. Using
   Pedicularis lachnoglossa from Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain in
   Lijiang (Yunnan Province, southwest China), we investigated the effects
   of high altitude habitats on the process of pollination and seed
   production. Floral biology, pollinator foraging behavior, breeding
   system, and pollination efficiency were examined using observation and
   exclusionary techniques. Pedicularis lachnoglossa was found to be
   entomophilous and exclusively pollinated by Bombus friseanus and B.
   yunnanicola. Our results indicated that pollination limitation in P.
   lachnoglossa was not significant. Under open pollination, approximately
   80\% of flowers were successfully pollinated and developed to fruits,
   and about 38\% of ovules developed to mature seeds. Bumblebee
   pollination is highly precise and efficient in P. lachnoglossa, because
   its flowering phenology and floral characters enhance the foraging of
   bumblebees on flowers. This study supports that animal pollination plays
   a crucial role in the outbreeding of the early flowering Pedicularis.
   The evolution of floral specification in Pedicularis has the advantages
   of adaptation to bumblebee pollination in adverse high altitude
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The floral volatile composition of four species of Vaccinium was
   profiled to asses the diversity of the floral chemistry within this
   genus. Flowers of Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton, Vaccinium
   varingiaefolium Miq., Vaccinium arboreum Marsh., and Vaccinium poasanum
   Donn. Sm. were sampled from three or more plants, and volatiles were
   collected and analyzed by gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy. A
   total of 45 volatile compounds were detected in the air (headspace)
   surrounding flowers including 40 from V. angustifolium, 34 for V.
   varingiaefolium, 37 for V. arboreum, and 17 for V. poasanum. Of the
   volatile compounds identified, 34 were terpenoids, 6 were benzoids and
   phenylpropanoids, 4 were aliphatics, and 1 was a miscellaneous cyclic
   compound. Terpenoids accounted for 98\%, 80\%, 76\%, and 67\% of the
   total volatiles for V. angustifolium, V. varingiaefolium, V. arboreum,
   and V. poasanum, respectively. The most abundant volatile compound
   emitted from the flowers of each species was alpha-pinene for V.
   angustifolium (23\%) and V. arboreum (63\%), methyl benzoate for V.
   varingiaefolium (18\%), and ethyl benzene for V. poasanum (21\%).
   Substantial variation was observed in the floral volatile composition of
   these four Vaccinium species, which may reflect their diverse ecological
   origins.}},

   autogamy, despite stigmas first becoming receptive in the bud in close
   proximity to the dehiscing anthers. Nonetheless, the species proved to
   be self-fertile, initiating as many fruits through selfing as
   outcrossing. Incremental benefits of outcrossing only later manifested

Abstract = {{Not all visitors to flowers are pollinators and pollinating taxa can
   vary greatly in their effectiveness. Using a combination of observations
   and experiments we compared the effectiveness of introduced honeybees
   with that of hummingbirds, native bees and moths on both the male and
   female components of fitness of the Andean shrub Duranta mandonii
   (Verbenaceae). Our results demonstrated significant variation among
   flower visitors in rates of visitation, pollen removal ability and
   contribution to fruit set. This variation was not always correlated;
   that is, taxa that regularly visited flowers did not remove the most
   pollen or contribute to fruit set. Despite the taxonomic diversity of
   visitors, the main natural pollinators of this shrub are large native
   bees, such as Bombus spp. Introduced honeybees were found to be as
   effective as native bees at pollinating this species. Duranta mandonii
   has high apparent generalization, but low realized generalization and
   can be considered to be a moderate ecological generalist (a number of
   species of large bees provide pollination services), but a functional
   specialist (most pollinators belong to a single functional group). The
   present study has highlighted the importance of measuring efficiency
   components when documenting plantpollinator interactions, and has also

Abstract = {{1 Individual markreleaserecapture is an important method for gathering
   data on insect movement, although it is limited by the constraints of
   tagging small insects with individual information. 2 Microdots,
   originally developed for covert security applications, are small polymer
   discs (diameter 0.5 mm) bearing up to 26 characters of information and
   have the potential as an alternative to the larger bee tags. In the
   present study, we test microdots for the individual marking of a 9-mm
   parasitoid wasp. 3 We individually marked 505 wasps. The recapture rate
   was 24\% of individuals over 189 recapture events, for which 84\%
   retained legible microdot labels. Movement was in the range 0161 m with
   a mean displacement 21.2 +/- 2.7 m. A captive survival experiment showed
   no difference in lifespan between marked and unmarked wasps. 4 The
   present study shows that microdots can provide an effective, durable,
   low-cost method for individually tagging small insects. The technique
   offers new opportunities by greatly expanding the capability for
   individually marking small insects, shifting the minimum size below that
   of bee tags, which is the only other manufactured option for
   individualized miniature marking.}},

Abstract = {{Most estimations of the pollination efficiency of insects have been
   based on observation by the naked human eye. However, insect behaviors
   are often too rapid to analyze sufficiently this way. Here we
   demonstrate the use of high-speed cameras to analyze the fine-scale
   behaviors of Macroglossum pyrrhosticta, Xylocopa appendiculata, and
   Papilio dehaanii when visiting Clerodendrum trichotomum. The fine-scale
   nectar drinking time, number of contacts with anthers and/or stigmas,
   and frequencies of body part contact with anthers and/or stigmas
   differed significantly among pollinator species. Pollination efficiency
   was not equal among pollinators. In addition, M. pyrrhosticta made the
   least number of contacts with anthers and/or stigmas even though it
   showed the highest visitation frequency. These results demonstrate that
   when examined from the viewpoint of rapid visitation behaviors,
   pollination dynamics differ among pollinator species, and flower visits
   and pollination rates are not equal.}},

Abstract = {{Studies during the last decades on representatives of Annonaceae have
   revealed their diversification with regard to pollination. Examples are
   given of species pollinated by beetles (cantharophily), which is the
   predominant mode of the majority of species worldwide, by small or large
   beetles (both groups having either diurnal or nocturnal flowers with or
   without thermogenesis), species pollinated by thrips (Thysanoptera),
   flies (myiophily and sapromyiophily), cockroaches and even bees
   (melittophily). Adaptational features of floral structures are compared
   with the behaviour of flower visitors, emphasizing floral rhythm, flower
   size, petal thickness, stamen structure and odour production.
   Anaxagorea, the earliest divergent surviving genus in Annonaceae,
   exhibits floral characters thought to be basal for the family:
   tissue-rich thick petals that form a pollination chamber; several
   Anaxagorea spp. exhibit thermogenesis, emit a fruit-like odour and
   attract small beetles as pollinators. As cantharophily is plesiomorphic
   in Anaxagorea and in Annonaceae, characters associated with beetle
   pollination appear imprinted in members of the whole family. Even
   non-cantharophilous species retain one or more characteristic features
   of beetle-pollinated species, such as thick petals, flattened and
   sclerified connective shields or protogynous dichogamy. (c) 2012 The

Abstract = {{Many species of Annonaceae are known for their distinctive, penetrating
   floral aromas. Numerous pollination studies have documented floral
   scents which probably play a key role in specialized pollination
   strategies. In particular, floral scents appear to play crucial roles in
   deceptive pollination strategies, contributing to floral mimicry of ripe
   or decaying fruits, fungi and, potentially, carrion or faeces.
   Occasionally, floral scent may advertise genuine floral rewards, as is
   the case for two species of Unonopsis pollinated by male euglossine
   bees. To date, ten studies have chemically characterized floral scent
   for 24 species representing 11 genera of Annonaceae. In this review, I
   discuss the chemical composition and diversity of the analysed floral
   scents in Annonaceae. I also summarize and discuss a wide range of
   (human) perceptual descriptions of floral scent found throughout the
   literature on Annonaceae. I have framed discussions of floral scent in
   Annonaceae in ecological and evolutionary contexts whenever possible.

Title = {{Beyond pollinator attraction: extra-floral displays deter herbivores in

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{499-512}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of several floral traits is thought to be driven by
   multiple selective agents, including pollinators and herbivores. Similar
   combinations of selection pressures may have shaped extra-floral traits.
   The conspicuous purple tufts of leaves ({''}flags{''}), which often
   terminate vertical inflorescences in the Mediterranean annual Salvia
   viridis, were shown to attract insect pollinators to the flowering
   patch. Here we test whether they also function as anti-herbivore
   signals. We determined the aposematic potential of S. viridis flags on
   three levels: concentrations of anthocyanins, suggested to function as
   aposematic visual signals, in leaves and flags; spectrometry to estimate
   whether the color-vision system of two common Mediterranean generalist
   herbivores (locusts and goats) can discriminate flags from leaves; and
   choice experiments to determine food preferences of the same herbivores.
   Anthocyanin concentrations in flags were > 10-fold higher than in
   leaves. Flags exhibited peak reflectance at 450 and 700 nm wavelengths,
   while leaves reflected maximally at 550 nm. According to the
   Vorobyev-Osorio color vision model, these differences in color
   reflection are likely to allow visual discrimination by herbivores.
   Goats preferred feeding on clipped inflorescences over control
   inflorescences. Locusts preferred leaves over flags. To test whether
   this was due to deterrence from the flags' coloration, we also offered
   them choice between leaves and a rare, white morph, of the flags. The
   locusts chose both equally immediately after presentation, but leaves
   attracted more individuals after 5 min of feeding. The locusts also
   preferred green cabbage over anthocyanin-rich red cabbage. These results
   support the function of colorful extra-floral displays as warning
   signals.}},

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that dense yeast populations often occurring
   in floral nectar are numerically dominated by a few species from the
   flowerinsect interface specialized genus Metschnikowia, while generalist
   yeast species commonly occurring on leaf surfaces, soil, freshwater, and
   air were rarely isolated from nectar samples. This study was designed to
   understand the main factors responsible for the assembly of nectar yeast
   communities, by combining field experiments with laboratory tests
   characterizing the physiological abilities of all yeast species forming
   the pool of potential colonizers for two Spanish flowering plants
   (Digitalis obscura and Atropa baetica). Yeast frequency and species
   richness were assessed in external sources (bee glossae, air, plant
   phylloplane) as well as in pollinator rewards (pollen, nectar). Yeasts
   were most frequent in external sources (air, flower-visiting insects),
   less so in the proximate floral environment (phylloplane), and least in
   pollen and nectar. Nectar communities appeared to be considerably
   impoverished versions of those in insect glossae and phylloplane.
   Nectar, pollen, and insect yeast assemblages differed in physiological
   characteristics from those in other substrates. Nectarivorous
   Metschnikowia were not more resistant than other yeast species to plant
   secondary compounds and high sugar concentrations typical of nectar, but
   their higher growth rates may be decisive for their dominance in
   ephemeral nectar communities.}},

Abstract = {{Although the behaviour of animals facing the conflicting demands of
   increasing foraging success and decreasing predation risk has been
   studied in many taxa, the response of pollinators to variations in both
   factors has only been studied in isolation. We compared visit rates of
   two pollinator species, hoverflies and honeybees, to 40 Chrysanthemum
   segetum patches in which we manipulated predation risk (patches with and
   without crab spiders) and nectar availability (rich and poor patches)
   using a full factorial design. Pollinators responded differently to the
   tradeoff between maximising intake rate and minimising predation risk:
   honeybees preferred rich safe patches and avoided poor risky patches
   while the number of hoverflies was highest at poor risky patches.
   Because honeybees were more susceptible to predation than hoverflies,
   our results suggest that, in the presence of competition for resources,
   less susceptible pollinators concentrate their foraging effort on
   riskier resources, where competition is less severe. Crab spiders had a
   negative effect on the rate at which inflorescences were visited by
   honeybees. This effect was mediated through changes in the foraging
   strategy of honeybees, and could, in principle, be reversed by
   increasing nectar productivity of inflorescences. Our study shows that
   both pollinator species responded simultaneously and differently to
   variations in food reward and predation risk, and highlights the
   importance of studying the foraging strategies of pollinators in order
   to fully understand how plantpollinator interactions are established.}},

Abstract = {{The fruit production of flowering plants critically depends on the
   pollination services provided by animals that compete for flower
   resources. The output of competitive interactions between ants and bees
   for inflorescences of jambolan (Myrtaceae) in an agroforestry system in
   Brazilian Meridional Amazonian are an interesting system of
   investigation due the possibility to control variables experimentally.
   In 20 individuals we performed 300 treatments in different
   inflorescences of two strata (upper and lower) as follows: (1) ants
   exclusion, (2) bees exclusion, and (3) control group where ants and bees
   could access the inflorescences. There was no difference in the number
   of inflorescences, volume of nectar and sugar concentration between the
   strata. Also the visitors considered are distributed equally in the
   tree's stratum. When bees were prevented from access the inflorescences,
   ants dominated more inflorescences only in the lower stratum. On the
   contrary, when ants were excluded, bees visited more inflorescences only
   in the upper stratum. We conclude that ants prevent the access to bees
   and vice versa as the result of different ability of resource
   utilization and foraging strategies. Thus, preventing the access of ants
   to the floral nectar could increase the level of nectar available to
   pollinators of , thereby increasing productivity and reducing economic
   losses.}},

Abstract = {{Oligolectic bees collect pollen from only a few related plant taxa, and
   our understanding of both the bees' innate and learned behavior in
   host-plant recognition is incomplete. For the oligolectic bee Chelostoma
   rapunculi, whose host plants are within Campanula, we conducted choice
   tests on foraging-naive individuals to investigate the bee's innate
   preference for visual and olfactory floral cues of its host plants over
   those of nonhost plants. In addition, we tested both foraging-naive and
   foraging-experienced individuals to determine the relative importance of
   these 2 sensory modalities in the bee's innate and learned host-flower
   location. Visual and olfactory cues of Campanula trachelium flowers,
   both separately and combined, attracted significantly more
   foraging-naive bees than equivalent cues of nonhost plants. Furthermore,
   for both foraging-naive and -experienced bees, the visual cues of host
   plants were more attractive than the olfactory ones, and the 2 cues
   combined attracted more bees than either alone. In foraging-naive bees,
   visual and olfactory cues alone elicited almost exclusively approaches,
   whereas after the bees gained foraging experience, landings became more
   frequent in response to visual cues but not to olfactory cues; in both
   bee groups, the combination of visual and olfactory cues was most
   effective in promoting landings. We conclude that Ch. rapunculi has an
   innate preference for the floral cues of its host plants over those of
   nonhost species and that both foraging-naive and foraging-experienced
   bees integrate visual and olfactory cues to find their host flowers,
   with a slightly greater reliance on visual cues in bees with foraging
   experience.}},

Abstract = {{Social insects are prone to attack by parasites as they provide numerous
   resources of food and brood, homeostatic nest conditions and a high
   density of individuals, enhancing the transmission of parasites. The
   defence of social insects might occur at different levels, the
   individual and the group. Individual defence occurs in part via the
   innate immune system resulting in the expression of antimicrobial
   substances. Group level defences, summarised as `social immunity',
   represent a suite of behavioural and organisational features. Here, all
   effects contributing to social immunity except for the social context
   were removed from bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) workers, kept either in
   groups or solitarily. The gene expression of six effector molecules of
   the immune system was monitored in both groups and in controls from the
   same source colonies. The social treatment has a highly significant
   effect on immune gene expression, with groups exhibiting higher levels
   of two antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and two lysozymes. Phenoloxidase is
   affected at the regulatory level, with a strong upregulation of its
   suppressor Spn27A in groups suggesting a trade-off with antimicrobial
   activity. AMPs are strongly upregulated in groups, whereas lysozymes are
   strongly downregulated in solitary treatments suggesting another
   trade-off. Clearly, social immunity impacts elements of individual
   immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Bird pollination has evolved in four species of Macaronesian Lotus from
   a bee-pollinated ancestor. The transition is associated with the
   modification of several floral traits, including flower color and size,
   relative size and orientation of the petals, and nectar composition and
   quantity. Here, we examine petal surface micromorphology in relation to
   pollination type, using SEM and LM. In the bee-pollinated Lotus (the
   majority of the genus), papillose conical cells (PCS) are the most
   abundant epidermal type on dorsal and lateral petals. However,
   bird-pollinated species completely lack PCS on their dorsal petals and
   have only a small patch of PCS in a highly localized region of the
   lateral petal. In the bee-pollinated species (including those most
   closely related to the bird-pollinated species), PCS develop early in
   floral development. In contrast, the small amount of residual PCS in
   bird-pollinated species forms later in development, after the other two
   major epidermal types have been formed. The almost complete elimination
   of PCS during the shift of pollination syndrome from bee to birds may be
   adaptively driven as a both probird and antibee trait.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging distance is a key determinant of colony survival and
   pollination potential in bumblebees Bombus spp. However this aspect of
   bumblebee ecology is poorly understood because of the difficulty in
   locating colonies of these central place foragers. Here, we used a
   combination of molecular microsatellite analyses, remote sensing and
   spatial analyses using kernel density estimates to estimate nest
   location and foraging distances for a large number of wild colonies of
   two species, and related these to the distribution of foraging habitats
   across an experimentally manipulated landscape. Mean foraging distances
   were 755 m for Bombus lapidarius and 775 m for B. pascuorum (using our
   most conservative estimation method). Colony-specific foraging distances
   of both species varied with landscape structure, decreasing as the
   proportion of foraging habitats increased. This is the first time that
   foraging distance in wild bumblebees has been shown to vary with
   resource availability. Our method offers a means of estimating foraging
   distances in social insects, and informs the scale of management
   required to conserve bumblebee populations and enhance their pollination
   services across different landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between pollinators, nectar robbers, defensive plants and
   non-defensive plants are characterized by evolutionary games, where
   payoffs for the four species are represented by population densities at
   steady states in the corresponding dynamical systems. The plant-robber
   system is described by a predator-prey model with the Holling II
   functional response, while the plant-pollinator system is described by a
   cooperative model with the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response. By
   combining dynamics of the models with properties of the evolutionary
   games, we show mechanisms by which pollination mutualisms could persist
   in the presence of nectar robbers. The analysis leads to an explanation
   for persistence of plant-pollinator-robber systems in real situations.

   population numbers. A simple mathematical model can be used to calculate
   the maximum predator abundance compatible with positive growth of
   solitary bee populations. Using published data to estimate model
   parameters, the model shows that medium-sized (20-80 mg dry weight)
   solitary bees are very sensitive to predation and their populations can
   hardly grow when 1-2\% of flowers are occupied by ambush predators-a
   predator abundance well within the range reported in most studies.
   Smaller and larger bees, on the other hand, can easily cope with normal
   predator abundances: small bees do not need to visit many flowers to
   provision an offspring, making it unlikely that they encounter a
   predator, and large bees are less vulnerable to predator attacks.
   According to a sensibility analysis, the parameters with the greatest
   impact on bee population viability are the number of flowers that bees
   must exploit to provision an offspring and the probability that a bee,
   upon landing on a predator-harboring flower, is actually captured. It
   follows that ambush predators cannot be excluded a priori from the list
   of factors affecting bee diversity and abundance: small changes in the
   abundance of ambush predators, possibly related to changes in the
   availability of alternative prey, could have dramatic effects on the
   viability of medium-sized solitary bees.}},

Title = {{Similar Genetic Mechanisms Underlie the Parallel Evolution of Floral
   Phenotypes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 27}},
Abstract = {{The repeated origin of similar phenotypes is invaluable for studying the
   underlying genetics of adaptive traits; molecular evidence, however, is
   lacking for most examples of such similarity. The floral morphology of
   neotropical Malpighiaceae is distinctive and highly conserved,
   especially with regard to symmetry, and is thought to result from
   specialization on oil-bee pollinators. We recently demonstrated that
   CYCLOIDEA2-like genes (CYC2A and CYC2B) are associated with the
   development of the stereotypical floral zygomorphy that is critical to
   this plant-pollinator mutualism. Here, we build on this developmental
   framework to characterize floral symmetry in three clades of
   Malpighiaceae that have independently lost their oil bee association and
   experienced parallel shifts in their floral morphology, especially in
   regard to symmetry. We show that in each case these species exhibit a
   loss of CYC2B function, and a strikingly similar shift in the expression
   of CYC2A that is coincident with their shift in floral symmetry. These
   results indicate that similar floral phenotypes in this large angiosperm
   clade have evolved via parallel genetic changes from an otherwise highly
   conserved developmental program.}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 26}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is a well-studied and at the same time a threatened
   ecosystem service. A significant part of global crop production depends
   on or profits from pollination by animals. Using detailed information on
   global crop yields of 60 pollination dependent or profiting crops, we
   provide a map of global pollination benefits on a 5' by 5'
   latitude-longitude grid. The current spatial pattern of pollination
   benefits is only partly correlated with climate variables and the
   distribution of cropland. The resulting map of pollination benefits
   identifies hot spots of pollination benefits at sufficient detail to
   guide political decisions on where to protect pollination services by
   investing in structural diversity of land use. Additionally, we
   investigated the vulnerability of the national economies with respect to
   potential decline of pollination services as the portion of the
   (agricultural) economy depending on pollination benefits. While the
   general dependency of the agricultural economy on pollination seems to
   be stable from 1993 until 2009, we see increases in producer prices for
   pollination dependent crops, which we interpret as an early warning
   signal for a conflict between pollination service and other land uses at
   the global scale. Our spatially explicit analysis of global pollination
   benefit points to hot spots for the generation of pollination benefits
   and can serve as a base for further planning of land use, protection
   sites and agricultural policies for maintaining pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Most rewardless orchids engage in generalized food-deception, exhibiting
   floral traits typical of rewarding species and exploiting the
   instinctive foraging of pollinators. Generalized food-deceptive (GFD)
   orchids compete poorly with rewarding species for pollinator services,
   which may be overcome by flowering early in the growing season when
   relatively more pollinators are naive and fewer competing plant species
   are flowering, and/or flowering for extended periods to enhance the
   chance of pollinator visits. We tested these hypotheses by manipulating
   flowering time and duration in a natural population of Calypso bulbosa
   and quantifying pollinator visitation based on pollen removal. Both
   early and long flowering increased bumble-bee visitation compared with
   late and brief flowering, respectively. To identify the cause of reduced
   visitation during late flowering, we tested whether negative experience
   with C. bulbosa (avoidance learning) and positive experience with a
   rewarding species, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, (associative learning) by
   captive bumble-bees could reduce C. bulbosa's competitiveness. Avoidance
   learning explained the higher visitation of early-compared with
   late-flowering C. bulbosa. The resulting pollinator-mediated selection
   for early flowering may commonly affect GFD orchids, explaining their
   tendency to flower earlier than rewarding orchids. For dissimilar
   deceptive and rewarding sympatric species, associative learning may
   additionally favour early flowering by GFD species.}},

Abstract = {{The role of petal spurs and specialized pollinator interactions has been
   studied since Darwin. Aquilegia petal spurs exhibit striking size and
   shape diversity, correlated with specialized pollinators ranging from
   bees to hawkmoths in a textbook example of adaptive radiation. Despite
   the evolutionary significance of spur length, remarkably little is known
   about Aquilegia spur morphogenesis and its evolution. Using experimental
   measurements, both at tissue and cellular levels, combined with
   numerical modelling, we have investigated the relative roles of cell
   divisions and cell shape in determining the morphology of the Aquilegia
   petal spur. Contrary to decades-old hypotheses implicating a discrete
   meristematic zone as the driver of spur growth, we find that Aquilegia
   petal spurs develop via anisotropic cell expansion. Furthermore, changes
   in cell anisotropy account for 99 per cent of the spur-length variation
   in the genus, suggesting that the true evolutionary innovation
   underlying the rapid radiation of Aquilegia was the mechanism of tuning
   cell shape.}},

Abstract = {{Novel microsatellite markers for the solitary bee, Anthophora plumipes,
   were identified and characterised using 454 GS-FLX Titanium
   pyrosequencing technology. Thirty seven loci were tested using
   fluorescently labelled primers on a sample of 20 females from Prague.
   The number of alleles ranged from 1 to 10 (with a mean of 4 alleles per
   locus), resulting in an observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.05 to 0.9
   and an expected heterozygosity from 0.097 to 0.887. None of the loci
   showed a significant deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and
   only two loci showed the significant presence of null alleles. No
   linkage between loci was detected. We further provide information on a
   single multiplex PCR consisting of 11 of the most polymorphic loci. This
   multiplex approach provides an effective analytical tool for analysing
   genetic structure and carrying out parental analyses on Anthophora
   populations. Most of the 37 loci tested also showed robust amplification
   in five other Anthophora species (A. aestivalis, A. crinipes, A.
   plagiata, A. pubescens and A. quadrimaculata). The result of this study

   Female flowers of gynodioecious species (plants with either female or
   hermaphroditic flowers) are typically smaller with no reward for
   pollinators. We proposed and tested that pollinators (bees and
   butterflies) would visit female plants less frequently and visit fewer
   flowers for a shorter duration in a native prairie species. Lobelia
   spicata. We observed and quantified floral visitors exhibiting
   pollinator behavior in a population of L. spicata in a remnant tallgrass
   prairie located in central Illinois. We also quantified the number of
   seeds per fruit and fruits per plant. We found female plants have fewer
   visitors than hermaphroditic plants. Bees and butterflies, once on
   female plants, visited fewer flowers and spent less time than on
   hermaphroditic plants. Despite the lower number and shorter duration of
   visits, the females set more seeds per fruit. However, females did not
   consistently produce more seeds per plant, which is required to maintain
   females in the population.}},

   to Abbeville Red Iris flowers were Archilochus colubris (Ruby-throated
   Hummingbird), which were also largely successful in transferring a
   pollen dye-analogue between Abbeville Red Iris flowers. Other floral
   visitors included butterflies, wasps, and bee species. The pollinators
   of the Abbeville Red Iris have not been previously documented. These
   results suggest that pollinator isolation may be important in preventing
   hybridization between the Abbeville Red Iris and its geographically
   closest progenitor species, I. hexagona (Dixie Iris).}},

Abstract = {{We recorded stingless bee colony abundance and nesting habits in three
   sites with different anthropogenic activities in the Soconusco region of
   Chiapas, Mexico: (1) agroforestry (7 hacacao crop), (2) grassland (12
   ha), and (3) urban area (3 ha). A total of 67 nests were found,
   representing five stingless bee species, (Lepeletier), (Gu,rin),
   (Gu,rin), (Dalla Torre), and (Cockerell). The most abundant stingless
   bee in each site was (> 50\%). The primary tree species used by the bees
   were spp. (Moraceae, 37.8\%) and (Boraginaceae, 13.5\%). The nest
   entrance height of (96 +/- 19 cm) was different than the other species,
   and this bee was the only one that used all different nesting sites.
   Volatiles analyzed by gas chromatography from pollen collected by the
   stingless bees differed between bee species, but were highly similar in
   respect to the fragrances of the pollen collected by the same species at
   any site. Our data indicate that experienced low heterospecific and high
   intraspecific foraging overlap especially in the urban site. We observed
   cluster spatial distribution in grassland and in agroforestry sites. In
   the urban site, presented random distribution tended to disperse. was

   agricultural areas in the Atlantic Forest region of the state of
   Paraiba. Both sites showed similar species richness and composition.
   However, a higher number of nests was found at the Alhandra site, mainly
   of the species Shuckard and (F.). Regarding the orientation, the number
   of nest entrances oriented to prevailing wind direction was
   significantly smaller. Most species nested more frequently in shaded

Abstract = {{Monoecious cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plants generally produce enough
   pollen for fruit set. The amount of pollen required for fruit set
   depends on the number of pistillate flowers produced by the cultivar.
   `NC-Sunshine' is a new monoecious slicing hybrid cucumber with a high
   percentage of pistillate nodes. Because of the high percentage of
   pistillate nodes, a pollenizer might be required to maximize pollination
   to get high total and early yield. Hence, an experiment was conducted at
   three locations to evaluate the effect of the pollenizer `Poinsett 76'
   on yield of `NC-Sunshine' compared with no pollenizer `Gray Zucchini'
   squash (Cucurbita pepo). Differences (P >= 0.05) due to pollenizer,
   location, and the interaction of pollenizer and location on
   `NC-Sunshine' yield traits were detected. Pollenizer influenced cucumber
   yield at two of three locations. Results indicated that the pollenizer
   `Poinsett 76' significantly increased total, marketable, and early yield
   of `NC-Sunshine'. The percentage of early and marketable yield was also
   higher with the pollenizer `Poinsett 76'. In addition, the use of a
   pollenizer decreased cull yield. Therefore, a pollenizer is needed for
   monoecious hybrids having a high percentage of pistillate nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Two prairie-clovers, Dalea ornata (Douglas ex Hook.) Eaton \& J. Wright
   and Dalea searlsiae (A. Gray) Barneby, are perennial forbs found
   sporadically in the U.S. Intermountain West. Their seed is desirable for
   use in range-land restoration. We experimentally characterized the
   breeding biologies of D. ornate and D. searlsiae in a common garden,
   surveyed their pollinator guilds, and sampled their seed predators. The
   2 Dalea species, being primarily xenogamous, have comparable pollination
   requirements. For flowers manually pollinated with outcross pollen, an
   average of 42\% of D. ornata flowers and 39\% of D. searlsiae flowers
   yielded plump large seeds filled with endosperm. Both species proved to
   be self-compatible, but far fewer seeds resulted from either manual
   pollination with self-pollen (11\% seed set for D. ornata and 7\% for D.
   searlsiae) or unassisted autogamy (5\% and 6\% seed set, respectively).
   Limited surveys of the prairie-clovers pollinator guilds in ruderal or
   cheatgrass-infested habitats revealed sparse visitation solely by wild
   bees, primarily of the genera Anthidium, Colletes, Bombus, Eucera, and
   Melissodes. Beetles (Acanthoscelides oregonensis Johnson and Apion
   amaurum Kissinger) infested seed sampled from 18 of 25 D. ornata
   populations across a 3-state region. Productive farming of the seed of
   these prairie-clovers for rangeland restoration in the western United
   States will require supplementation of bees for pollination and
   exclusion of seed beetles.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Physaria obcordata is a rare endemic of western Colorado. Plants are
   self-incompatible; they cannot reproduce sexually unless pollinators
   move pollen between flowers of different genets. We found no evidence
   that: seed production was limited by inadequate pollination or that
   pollinations between near neighbor plants (inbreeding depression) or
   between distant plants (outbreeding depression) resulted in reduced
   fruit or seed set. Examples are given of the potentially devastating
   effect of grazing on fruit and seed production. Preliminary evidence
   suggests that P obcordata can hybridize with its common congener, P.
   acutifolia. Only crosses with P. obcordata as pollen recipient and ?
   acutifolia as pollen donor seemed fertile. Primary flower-visitors of?
   obcordata are ground-nesting native bees in the families Andrenidae and
   Halictidae. Most species visiting the flowers of P. obcordata are
   generalists. Only two bee species were likely mustard specialists. The
   only non-bee visitor of any import was a dipteran, Gonia (Tachinidae).
   Predictions of the distances flown by common bee visitors were made
   using the equations of Greenleaf et al. (2007). No bee is likely to
   travel more than I km from its nesting site to visit P. obcordata
   flowers and most are likely to fly distances that are significantly
   less. The implications of flight range estimates for gene flow between
   Physaria populations and for pollinator protection are discussed.
   Several recommendations are made for conservation of P obcordata and its
   attendant bees.}},

Title = {{Floral signal complexity as a possible adaptation to environmental
   variability: a test using nectar-foraging bumblebees, Bombus impatiens}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Floral signals are typically emitted across multiple sensory modalities,
   although why they are multimodal is unclear. One possible explanation is
   that multimodal signalling ensures that at least one signal component
   will be transmitted effectively under varying environmental conditions
   (the `efficacy backup' hypothesis). For example, by transmitting both
   component A and B, a signaller can communicate under environmental
   conditions where transmission of component A is reduced; component B
   `backs up' A. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether a floral
   scent could back up a floral colour signal when light levels were low.
   We trained nectar-foraging bumblebees to discriminate rewarding and
   unrewarding targets that differed in colour, scent, or both colour and
   scent, and then presented the targets at different levels of
   illumination. We measured bees' accuracy at distinguishing the two
   targets and their rate of visits to the trained target. Performance on
   both measures declined under low light when targets were unscented. The
   presence of scent reduced the loss of accuracy under low light,
   supporting the efficacy backup hypothesis, but this effect depended upon
   the colour of the previously rewarded target. In contrast, the presence
   of scent did not affect the overall rate of correct visits under low
   light (correct visits/foraging time). A backup mechanism that maintains
   accuracy, but not rate of nectar collection, does not necessarily
   benefit the pollinator. However, it most likely benefits the plant
   through reduced pollen wastage. In short, multimodal floral signals may
   benefit the plant by improving pollen transfer, while not benefiting the
   pollinator. (C) 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

   2009), and an increase in the area of birch forest in the National Park,
   we nevertheless found relatively moderate changes in the insect
   communities. Indeed, the observed number of species increased from 52 in
   1944 to 64 in 2008. Remarkably, the mean number of butterflies and moths
   per site, but not wild bee species, increased significantly. Among the
   species that were recorded in both periods, the average altitude of 17
   species had shifted downhill, 12 shifted uphill, and the altitude of the
   remaining 17 had not changed. While alterations in community composition
   were greater at the highest altitudes, changes in the insect community
   were smaller than expected, indeed much smaller than those reported from
   agricultural landscapes in North-West Europe. Interestingly, our results
   suggest that lower alpine altitudes (600-800 m a.s.l.) have become
   colonized by southern species, but also that high alpine areas (above
   1,000 m a.s.l.) have recently become colonized by high alpine species
   previously absent from these sites, likely as a result of increasing
   habitat availability. We conclude that wild bee, butterfly, and moth
   communities in Arctic areas in northern Sweden are in flux, as a result
   of climate change and suggest that increased attention must be given to
   conservation planning in cold areas. In addition, we propose that
   monitoring programs should be established, because more pronounced
   climate-driven changes can be expected in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The European wild strawberry species Fragaria vesca L., Fragaria viridis
   Weston, and Fragaria moschata Weston are sympatric and bloom
   concurrently, introducing the possibilities of cooperation and
   competition for pollinators. We studied the pollination biology of
   strawberries that were grown in rectangular plots at a field site near
   Vilnius city in Lithuania. The number of open flowers, the number of
   insects visiting flowers, and the plot area covered by strawberry plants
   were recorded. Wild strawberries were visited by solitary bees (38.5\%),
   flies (31.4\%), and other hymenopterans (21\%; ants accounted for
   approximately 98\% of this group). Coleopterans, lepidopterans and honey
   bees together represented less than 10\% of the insects recorded on
   strawberries. Fragaria viridis and F. moschata flowers were more
   attractive to pollinators than those of F. vesca. The main visitors of
   F. viridis were small solitary bees; those of F. moschata were ants,
   while F. vesca flowers were visited by solitary bees, ants and flies in
   comparable numbers. We discuss competition for pollinators and the
   possible impact of climate fluctuation on strawberry-pollinator

Abstract = {{Pollinators play a key role within most terrestrial communities in
   maintaining plant populations, as well as pollinating many agricultural
   crops for seed and fruit production. The mobility of pollinating animals
   is significant to their importance but we know little about how
   landscape structure influences pollinator movements. Linear landscape
   features such as hedgerows and embankments are conspicuous features of
   agricultural landscape structure and are important artificial habitats
   in their own right. However, there has been some debate as to the
   function of these landscape elements as corridors between larger
   expanses of semi-natural habitat separated by urban and agricultural
   habitats. Few studies have specifically studied insect flight responses
   to linear landscape elements. By observing bumblebee flight behaviour
   along hedgerows and, by creating a medium-scale experimental array of
   flower patches using an artificial linear feature, we examined whether
   such structures can elicit an oriented flight response along them and
   therefore facilitate insect movement through the landscape. We found
   that both hedgerows and artificial linear landscape features can
   influence the flight directions of bumblebees (Bombus spp. Hymenoptera,
   Apidae), one of Europe's most important groups of pollinators. A
   bioassay experiment in which Salvia pratensis (Lamiaceae) was planted
   into landscape patches with differing numbers of connecting hedgerows
   showed that this directional response can have a profound effect on
   plant reproductive success plants had increased pollinator activity,
   pollen receipt and subsequent seed set in patches with more connections.
   The overall hedgerow connectedness of a landscape is therefore important
   both to bumblebee movement and to those plants which depend on
   bumblebees for pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The prospects for persistence of bees living in fragmented landscapes is
   a topic of considerable interest due to bees' importance as pollinators
   of agricultural crops and wild plants, coupled with the ubiquity of
   native habitat loss and evidence that bees may be declining worldwide.
   Population persistence in fragmented areas depends on dispersal
   potential and maintenance of gene flow among fragments of habitat. Here
   we used population genetic techniques to characterize, for two equally
   abundant orchid bee species that differ in their physiology and ecology,
   levels of genetic differentiation among fragments of tropical forest in
   southeastern Costa Rica in a similar to 200 km(2) landscape. We measured
   population differentiation with phi(PT) (an analogue to the traditional
   summary statistic Fst), as well as two measures that may more accurately
   reflect the level of differentiation when highly variable loci are used:
   G'st and D-est. We also calculated pairwise genetic distances among
   individuals and conducted Mantel tests to test the correlation of
   genetic and geographic distance, for each species. We found strong
   differences in genetic structure between the species. Contrary to our
   expectations, each measure of genetic structure revealed that the
   larger-bodied species, Eulaema bombiformis, had higher levels of
   differentiation than the smaller species, Euglossa championi.
   Furthermore, for Eulaema bombiformis there was a significant positive
   correlation of genetic and geographic distance while for Euglossa
   championi there was no significant positive correlation. Our results
   demonstrate that bee species can have strikingly different levels of
   gene flow in fragmented habitats, and that body size may not always act
   as a useful proxy for dispersal, even in closely related taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Euglossine bee communities in small forest fragments of the Atlantic
   Forest, Rio de Janeiro state, southeastern Brazil (Hymenoptera, Apidae).
   Euglossine bees are important pollinators in forests and agricultural
   areas. Although the structure of their communities is critically
   affected by anthropogenic disturbances, little is known about these bees
   in small forest fragments. The objectives of this study were to analyze
   the composition, abundance, and diversity of euglossine bee species in
   nine small fragments of different phytophysiognomies of the Atlantic
   Forest in southeastern Brazil, and to identify the environmental
   variables that may be related to the species composition of these
   communities. Males were sampled quarterly from May 2007 to May 2009 with
   aromatic traps containing methyl cinnamate, vanillin, eucalyptol, benzyl
   acetate, and methyl salicylate. A total of 1558 males, belonging to 10
   species and three genera of Euglossina were collected. The richness
   ranged from five to seven species per fragment. Euglossa cordata, E.
   securigera, Eulaema nigrita e E. cingulata were common to all fragments
   studied. The diversity differed significantly among areas, ranging from
   H' = 1.04 to H' = 1.65. The precipitation, phytophysiognomy, and
   altitude had the highest relative importance over the species
   composition variation. The results presented in this study demonstrate
   that small forest fragments are able to support populations of
   euglossine bee species, most of which are widely distributed and
   reportedly tolerant to open and/or disturbed areas and suggest that the
   conservation of such areas is important, particularly in areas that are
   regenerating and in regions with agricultural matrices where these bees
   can act as important pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships within the bee family Megachilidae are poorly
   understood. The monophyly of the subfamily Fideliinae is questionable,
   the relationships among the tribes and subtribes in the subfamily
   Megachilinae are unknown, and some extant genera cannot be placed with
   certainty at the tribal level. Using a cladistic analysis of adult
   external morphological characters, we explore the relationships of the
   eight tribes and two subtribes currently recognised in Megachilidae. Our
   dataset included 80\% of the extant generic-level diversity,
   representatives of all fossil taxa, and was analysed using parsimony. We
   employed 200 characters and selected 7 outgroups and 72 ingroup species
   of 60 genera, plus 7 species of 4 extinct genera from Baltic amber. Our
   analysis shows that Fideliinae and the tribes Anthidiini and Osmiini of
   Megachilinae are paraphyletic; it supports the monophyly of
   Megachilinae, including the extinct taxa, and the sister group
   relationship of Lithurgini to the remaining megachilines. The
   Sub-Saharan genus Aspidosmia, a rare group with a mixture of osmiine and
   anthidiine features, is herein removed from Anthidiini and placed in its
   own tribe, Aspidosmiini, new tribe. Protolithurgini is the sister of
   Lithurgini, both placed herein in the subfamily Lithurginae; the other
   extinct taxa, Glyptapina and Ctenoplectrellina, are more basally related
   among Megachilinae than Osmiini, near Aspidosmia, and are herein treated
   at the tribal level. Noteriades, a genus presently in the Osmiini, is
   herein transferred to the Megachilini. Thus, we recognise four
   subfamilies (Fideliinae, Pararhophitinae, Lithurginae and Megachilinae)
   and nine tribes in Megachilidae. We briefly discuss the evolutionary
   history and biogeography of the family, present alternative
   classifications, and provide a revised key to the extant tribes of
   Megachilinae.}},

Abstract = {{Terminalia pallida is a semi-evergreen tree species. Leaf fall and
   flushing events occur during pre-monsoon season; leaf flushing extends
   into the monsoon season. Flowering occurs during late dry season and
   early monsoon season. The flowers are bisexual and obligately outcrossed
   and this is enforced by self-incompatibility. Protogyny is a device to
   promote outcrossing, but it is weak. However, it is partly substantiated
   by gradual anther dehiscence over a period of six hours. Individual
   trees flower for a brief period of three weeks with massive floral
   display. The flowers offer both nectar and pollen for the foragers; the
   nectar provides five essential amino acids - threonine, arginine,
   histidine, lysine and methionine, and also some non-essential amino
   acids. The plant is entomophilous, and cross-pollination is effected
   mainly by large bees, wasps and butterflies. The natural fruit set is
   around 6\% as against the 62\% realized in manual xenogamous
   pollinations. Fruits fall to the ground when mature and dry, but wind is
   also instrumental in shedding fruits. The fallen fruits are dispersed by
   rain water and the seeds germinate and establish seedlings depending on
   the soil status. The study suggests that T. pallida does not suffer from
   pollinator limitation to maximize fruit set but from the limitation of
   compatible pollen, flower and fruit predation by a beetle, fruit
   predation by a rodent and fruit fungal infestation. Nutrient-poor rocky
   habitat appears to be an important limiting factor for the recruitment
   and population expansion.}},

Abstract = {{A diverse assemblage of pollinators, such as bees, beetles, flies, and
   butterflies, will often visit a single plant species. However,
   evaluating the effect of several insects on fruit and seed production is
   difficult in plants visited by a variety of insects. Here, we analyzed
   the effect of three types of pollinators, Papilio spp., Macroglossum
   pyrrhosticta, and Xylocopa appendiculata on fruit and seed production in
   Clerodendrum trichotomum by using a flower visitor barrier experiment
   with nets of specific mesh sizes. As a result, fruit/flower and
   seed/ovule ratios were significantly lower under Papilio exclusion than
   under natural conditions. On the other hand, ratios were not
   significantly different between Papilio excluded and both Papilio and M.
   pyrrhosticta excluded treatments. Therefore, Papilio and X.
   appendiculata are effective pollinators, whereas M. pyrrhosticta, which
   was the most frequent visitor, of C. trichotomum, is not. From our
   observations of visiting behaviors, we believe that because M.
   pyrrhosticta probably promotes self-pollination, this species is a
   non-effective pollinator. This is the first study to separate and
   compare the contribution of various visitors to the reproductive success
   of a plant.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{MAR 9}},
Abstract = {{Commercial greenhouse growers in both Japan and China are increasingly
   using reared orange-tailed bumblebees known previously as Bombus
   hypocrita Perez as pollinators. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA (COI)
   barcodes with Bayesian methods shows that this ``species{''} is a
   long-standing confusion of two cryptic species. We find that the
   orange-tailed bumblebees in North China are actually part of the
   widespread Russian (otherwise white-tailed) B. patagiatus Nylander (as
   B. patagiatus ganjsuensis Skorikov, n. comb.), whereas the orange-tailed
   bees in Japan are true B. hypocrita. This situation has been further
   complicated because two other cryptic species from North China that were
   previously confused with the Russian B. patagiatus are now recognised as
   separate: B. lantschouensis Vogt n. stat. and B. minshanensis Bischoff
   n. stat.. As demand for pollination services by greenhouse growers
   inevitably increases, these bees are more likely to be transported
   between countries. In order to conserve genetic resources of pollinator
   species for their option value for future food security, we advocate
   preventing trade and movement of B. patagiatus from China into Japan and
   of B. hypocrita from Japan into China.}},

Abstract = {{During a period of 21 months (February/2008 to October/2009) we

   Biological Reserve of the Unilavras Boqueirao, Inga, MG (21 degrees 14'
   59{''} S / 44 degrees 59' 27{''} W). The species were sampled using trap
   nests. The traps were made of bamboo sections, fixed in PVC rods and
   placed in transects, five meters equidistant. On each rod, three nests
   were fixed on the heights of 0.56 m, 1.13 m and 1.70 m from the ground,
   in the following vegetation types: Riparian Forest, Cerrado stricto
   senso and Riparian Forest edge. Nests were inspected every two weeks.
   221 nests were founded, belonging to six species of wasps and three
   species of bees. From all nests, 123 nests were founded in the Cerrado
   stricto sensu, 51 in the edge of the Riparian Forest and 47 within the
   Riparian Forest. Three species were abundant in all areas: Isodontia sp.
   (35\% of total nests), followed by Trypoxylon (Trypargilum) lactitarse
   Saussure (15\%) and Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata Smith (11\%). Intense
   nesting activity was observed mainly in the hot, rainy season (November
   to February). A total of 29\% of nests were parasitized by species of
   Chrysididae, Ichneumonidae and Bombyliidae. In general, the structural
   aspects of the nests collected in this study are similar to those
   obtained in studies with these species in other environments.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees are an important group of specialized insect pollinators in
   the Neotropics. Male orchid bees are attracted by a wide range of
   aromatic substances often produced by flowers. Previous studies found
   that in some species the males change their aromatic preferences between
   seasons. In our study we documented seasonal changes of aromatic
   preferences in five euglossine bee assemblages along a 380-km-long
   seasonality and precipitation gradient and related them to climatic
   factors. We found that the proportion of species per site showing
   changes in their aromatic preference between seasons increased with
   climatic seasonality towards the south. Those species mainly belong to
   the genus Euglossa, subgenus Euglossa. We conclude that climatic
   seasonality mainly affects the orchid bees via the turnover of the
   aromatic substances provided by the plants. Further, we suggest that the
   ability to change the aromatic preference between seasons could be
   interpreted as a phylogenetic pre-adaptation that enabled some species
   to colonize climatically strongly seasonal habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Melittobia acasta (Walker) are microhymenopteran ectoparasitoids of the
   pupae and prepupae of the commercially-used pollinator bumblebee species
   Bombus terrestris L. The female parasitoids puncture the host cuticle
   with their sting and feed oozing hemolymph. This study shows that M.
   acasta parasitize 100\% pupae and 84\% prepupae of B. terrestris but are
   ineffective on the larvae of the bees. The female parasitoids lay a
   significantly higher number of eggs on pupae (67.7 +/- 16.2 female(-1))
   compared to prepupae (20.5 +/- 14.5 female(-1)). The parasitoids differ
   in their choice for oviposition sites and fecundity on different
   locations of B. terrestris pupae, and they show most preference for
   oviposition (32\%) as well as fecundity (34.9 +/- 15.1 female(-1)) on
   the petiole of the host. Larvae of the parasitoids overwinter at low
   temperatures but larval overwintering duration and post-diapause rearing
   on original or new hosts do not affect their pupation and adult
   emergence. Larvae have a higher percentage of pupation (88.0-94.4\%) and
   adult emergence (84.4-92.9\%) both on the original and the new host,
   thus indicate that the parasitoids are highly capable of reproduction in

Abstract = {{A synopsis of the annual genus Poteranthera is presented here. Three
   species are recognized including the newly described Poteranthera
   windischii. Poteranthera is characterized by its annual life cycle,
   generally linear leaves that have conspicuous gland-tipped hairs on the
   lamina margin, 5-merous flowers with a constriction at the level of the
   torus, one cycle of stamens reduced to staminodia or absent altogether,
   three locular ovary, and reniform seeds with a foveolate testa. The
   flowers of the new species P. windischii are strongly heterandrous,
   where the usual set of stamens that bees harvest pollen from is reduced
   to staminodia and the stamen set that deposits pollen on the bee has
   large yellow ventral appendages that possibly function as pollen mimics
   and result in deceit pollination. This hypothesis is supported by
   experiments that have demonstrated innate preferences of female bees for
   yellow, UV absorbing colors in flowers. Species of Poteranthera are
   extremely rare, known from very few specimens and possibly highly
   endangered.}},

Abstract = {{Floral traits used to attract and reward pollinators should become
   vestigial during the evolution of self-fertilization from outcrossing
   due to the reduced fitness benefits of investing in pollinator
   attraction. However, few traits have been studied, and covariation with
   outcrossing is rarely evaluated using genetic estimates of the mating
   system. We examined covariation between petal size and color and genetic
   estimates of outcrossing among populations of the yellow-flowered,
   bee-pollinated Camissoniopsis cheiranthifolia that exhibit striking
   variation in the mating system. We measured brightness, chroma, and hue,
   using a spectrophotometer, and petal size, using image analysis for
   flowers sampled in the field from 25 populations across the species'
   geographic range. Petals were brighter with higher chroma and lower hue
   (less red) in large-flowered populations than in small-flowered
   populations. Petal size, brightness, and chroma also correlated
   positively with the proportion of seeds outcrossed estimated from
   marker-gene analysis for a subsample of 11 populations. Parallel changes
   in petal size and color in selfing populations from two climatically
   different regions plus the maintenance of differences in flower size and
   color between large-and small-flowered populations when grown in a
   common glasshouse environment suggests genetic differentiation in these
   traits associated with mating system evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis of this study was that in the Galapagos Islands, fruit
   and seed set via nocturnal pollination would exceed that of diurnal
   pollination due to greater insect activity at night typical of hot, arid
   regions. Cordia lutea, a heterostylous member of the Galapagos flora,
   was submitted to pollination experiments, visitor observations, nectar
   sampling, pollen transfer studies, pollen-ovule ratio studies, and
   pollen measurements. Flowers set fruit and seed via open pollination,
   autonomous autogamy, facilitated autogamy, facilitated
   cross-pollination, diurnal pollination, and nocturnal pollination. There
   was a significant difference in fruit set between flowers experiencing
   legitimate cross-pollinations (pin 9 thrum) and those experiencing all
   other pollination treatments except facilitated autogamy. There was no
   significant difference in seed set among any of the treatments, but
   there was a trend toward greater seed set for flowers experiencing
   open-pollination, legitimate cross-pollination, and nocturnal
   pollination. There was no significant difference in fruit set or seed
   set between flowers experiencing diurnal pollination and nocturnal
   pollination, although there was a trend toward greater seed set
   resulting from nocturnal pollination. Carpenter bees were the most
   effective diurnal pollinators, whereas moths were the most effective
   nocturnal pollinators. Of the two, moths are more efficient at
   transporting pollen from plant to plant. Results indicate that an
   overall low productivity of this species is due to pollen limitation
   exacerbated by nectar robbing. Cordia lutea exhibits a mixed mating
   system, producing a relatively low level of fruits through a combination
   of self- and cross-pollination, facilitated by the relatively few
   insects that are available.}},

Abstract = {{Many bee species are adapted to just a few specific plants in order to
   collect pollen (oligolecty). To reproduce successfully, it is important
   for oligolectic bees to find and recognise the specific host flowers. In
   this study, we investigated the role of floral volatiles used by an
   oligolectic bee to recognise its host plants. We compared the
   attractiveness of natural and synthetic scent samples of host flowers to
   foraging-naive and -experienced Hoplitis adunca (Megachilidae) bees that
   are specialised on Echium and Pontechium (Boraginaceae) plants. The
   investigations showed that naive H. adunca females are attracted to
   1,4-benzoquinone. During their lifetime, bees learn additional floral
   cues while foraging on host flowers. In contrast to naive ones,
   experienced H. adunca females use, in addition to 1,4-benzoquinone,
   other compounds to recognise their host plants. 1,4-Benzoquinone is an
   uncommon floral compound only known from the host plants of H. adunca,
   and is therefore ideally suited to be used as a plant-specific
   recognition cue. Several arthropods use this compound to deter insect
   predators. Therefore, 1,4-benzoquinone as an attractant in Echium
   flowers may have evolved from a primary function as a defensive compound
   against insect herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of pollination biology of Mesogyne insignis is poorly known
   in fragmented forests of Amani Nature Reserve. This study was conducted
   to determine the effect of forest fragmentation on potential pollinators
   of this endangered species. Three intact forests and three forest
   fragments were selected for this study, the intact forests serving as
   control. Visual observation of insects visiting inflorescences, insect
   trapping and pollinator exclusion experiments were the methods employed
   in assessing pollination. Most members of the solitary bee genus
   Megachile were found to be potential pollinators of M. insignis.
   Diversity of pollinators was significantly higher in intact forests than
   in forest fragments. Overall, the total number of fruits set was
   significantly higher in intact forests than in forest fragments, perhaps
   a reflection of the higher diversity and abundance of potential
   pollinators in an intact forest. The pollination system of M. insignis
   is generalist in terms of systematic group of pollinators, and forest
   fragmentation may have significant impact on this pollination pattern. A
   similar study should be conducted in other Eastern Arc Mountains where
   M. insignis grows to find out whether the potential pollinators are
   similar or not.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced bees may compete with native fauna, spread parasites or
   pathogens to commercial bee hives, or increase the fecundity of
   introduced weeds. Therefore, the recent detection of Halictus
   smaragdulus, native to the western Palaearctic, in the Hunter Valley
   region of New South Wales (NSW, Australia) is cause for concern.
   However, it is currently difficult to justify control measures, as there
   is little known on its ecology, impacts and distribution. Determining
   the current distribution is fundamental to managing introduced species,
   yet this is difficult with inconspicuous species such as H. smaragdulus,
   especially as recent introductions are often found in low densities. We
   demonstrated how a combination of approaches could be used to improve
   the identification of occupied locations in NSW, including bioclimatic
   envelope models, proximity to known populations, and observed habitat
   preferences. Members of the public were also trained to collect
   specimens and improve overall survey efficiency. Bees were collected
   using pan traps and sweep netting. H. smaragdulus was detected at 44 new
   locations, extending the known distribution from similar to 1,250 to
   46,800 km(2). While bioclimatic envelope models helped guide survey
   locations, species detectability was higher when observed habitat
   preferences and proximity to known populations were also considered. We
   also demonstrated that with training via the internet and appropriate
   procedures for returning specimens in the mail, members of the public
   could successfully collect this small and inconspicuous invertebrate,
   with potential applications for other similar species.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (Fabricius), is a
   valuable wild and managed pollinator of lowbush blueberry (syn. `wild
   blueberry', Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.), in Atlantic Canada. As some
   insecticides may present a hazard to pollinators, we assessed the
   susceptibility of M. rotundata to insecticides used or projected for
   future use in lowbush blueberry pest management. In topical direct
   contact bioassays, adults were susceptible to phosmet, spinosad,
   spinetoram, and deltamethrin. Based on findings from these laboratory
   studies, it appears that when used at recommended or projected
   application rates, each of these compounds poses a hazard to M.
   rotundata by direct contact. In a second experiment, eggs and larvae
   were collected in the field and their pollen provisions were treated
   with deltamethrin, flubendiamide, and spinetoram at field relevant
   concentrations. Larvae treated with deltamethrin and spinetoram in the
   laboratory either died before spinning a cocoon or, in the case of
   spinetoram, occasionally pupated without spinning a cocoon.
   Flubendiamide was not toxic to adult M. rotundata by direct contact and
   had no effect on larval survivorship, or time to complete cocoon
   spinning. Emergence after overwintering was relatively poor overall, but
   there was no effect of treatment. Based on these results, flubendiamide
   appears safe to use in the presence of M. rotundata, whereas the other
   insecticides we tested may pose a hazard.}},

Abstract = {{The limit of a species distribution can be determined biotically if an
   environmental gradient causes the loss of critical mutualists such as
   pollinators. We assessed this hypothesis for Embothrium coccineum, a
   self-incompatible red-flowered treelet growing along a strong west-east
   precipitation gradient from rainforest to forest-steppe ecotone in the
   rain shadow of the southern Andes in northwestern Patagonia. For 16
   populations along this gradient, we quantified composition of the
   pollinator assemblage, pollination efficiency and limitation, and
   reproductive output. The treelet has a generalized pollination system,
   but the hummingbird Sephanoides sephaniodes was the most effective
   pollinator. The relative importance of this hummingbird as a flower
   visitor within populations influenced pollen transfer and fruit set more
   strongly than local precipitation. As hummingbirds and other
   pollinators, including passerine birds and nemestrinid flies, were
   replaced by bees towards the dry eastern range limit, pollen limitation
   increased and reproduction eventually failed. These results support the
   hypothesis that pollinators can act as important biotic filters
   influencing plant distribution, and warn against predictions of
   geographical range shifts based solely on climatic variables.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Urban environments contain habitats for flowering plants and their
   pollinating animal species. It is, however, unclear how the urban matrix
   influences plant-pollinator processes. We recorded plant diversity,
   floral abundance, flower visitor diversity and plot visits at 89 plant
   patches within the city of Zurich. The urban matrix surrounding each
   site was analyzed for the landscape metrics edge density and the extent
   of green area up to 200 m radius. The correlation between edge density
   and bee diversity and visitation frequency varied over the entire
   spatial range, while the correlation for syrphid diversity and
   visitation frequency levelled off at 80 m radius. In contrast, the
   correlations with green area were more consistent, with bee diversity
   levelling off after 100 m, while syrphid diversity and visits continued
   to increase. The variation in the correlation of bee visits was partly
   accounted for by the large contribution of honeybees. Plant diversity
   significantly affected bee diversity and visits, and syrphid visits.
   Floral abundance had a positive effect on bee visits and bee diversity.
   Syrphid diversity had a negative interaction with floral abundance and
   green area. The extent of green area increased bee diversity and visits,
   and syrphid visits, while edge density reduced visitation by bees. This
   study showed that plant diversity and floral abundance in urban
   environments promote pollinating flower visitors. The extent of green
   area and edge density are important urban mosaic attributes that affect
   pollinator abundance and visitation frequency at multiple scales.}},

Abstract = {{Although the spatial separation of sexual organs within a flower
   (herkogamy) has been interpreted as a mechanism that promotes efficient
   pollen transfer, there have been few attempts to relate variation in
   herkogamy to probabilities of pollen flow. Here, we used a heterostylous
   species with variation in reciprocal herkogamy to test this hypothesis.
   We measured legitimate and illegitimate pollen flow with fluorescent
   dyes in four selected populations of Oxalis alpina corresponding to the
   extremes of a previously reported evolutionary gradient from tristyly to
   distyly. After the breakdown of tristyly, the observed increment in
   reciprocal herkogamy between the long and short morphs was associated
   with a 30\% increase in the proportion of dye received from compatible
   illegitimate pollinations. In all populations, the most likely effective
   pollen vectors were two Heterosarus bee species. Our results support the
   adaptive value of reciprocal herkogamy in promoting efficient pollen
   transfer in heterostylous species.}},

Abstract = {{For 4 years we studied pollination biology and breeding system of the
   critically endangered, Red List plant Fritillaria meleagris L.
   (Liliaceae), in the larger of the two remaining populations of the plant
   in SE Poland. Our observations indicated that, contrary to literature
   data, the species is not dichogamous nor is it obligatorily
   out-crossing. Selfing, although rare in natural populations, results in
   fully developed seeds. Flowers are visited by several insect species,
   mostly social and solitary bees. In spite of extremely low visitation
   rates to this early spring-flowering plant, the species is not pollen
   limited. Although the largest pollen loads are transferred by solitary
   bees, the key pollinators are bumblebees (mostly the most common
   species, Bombus terrestris and B.lapidarius) due to their seasonal and
   floral constancy, and tolerance of bad weather conditions. The current
   decline of the studied population seems not to be related to the species
   pollination or breeding systems but to plant habitat loss. It is
   suggested, however, that in smaller populations, the species dependence
   on generally rare pollinators and largely out-crossed breeding system
   may accelerate local extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen-collecting bees are among the most important pollinators
   globally, but are also the most common pollen thieves and can
   significantly reduce plant reproduction. The pollination efficiency of
   pollen collectors depends on the frequency of their visits to
   female(-phase) flowers, contact with stigmas and deposition of pollen of
   sufficient quantity and quality to fertilize ovules. Here we investigate
   the relative importance of these components, and the hypothesis that
   floral and inflorescence characteristics mediate the pollination role of
   pollen collection by bees.
   For ten Aloe species that differ extensively in floral and inflorescence
   traits, we experimentally excluded potential bird pollinators to
   quantify the contributions of insect visitors to pollen removal, pollen
   deposition and seed production. We measured corolla width and depth to
   determine nectar accessibility, and the phenology of anther dehiscence
   and stigma receptivity to quantify herkogamy and dichogamy. Further, we
   compiled all published bird-exclusion studies of aloes, and compared
   insect pollination success with floral morphology.
   Species varied from exclusively insect pollinated, to exclusively bird
   pollinated but subject to extensive pollen theft by insects. Nectar
   inaccessibility and strong dichogamy inhibited pollination by
   pollen-collecting bees by discouraging visits to female-phase (i.e.
   pollenless) flowers. For species with large inflorescences of
   pollen-rich flowers, pollen collectors successfully deposited pollen,
   but of such low quality (probably self-pollen) that they made almost no
   contribution to seed set. Indeed, considering all published
   bird-exclusion studies (17 species in total), insect pollination
   efficiency varied significantly with floral shape.
   Species-specific floral and inflorescence characteristics, especially
   nectar accessibility and dichogamy, control the efficiency of
   pollen-collecting bees as pollinators of aloes.}},

Abstract = {{Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) were collected at 24 sites chosen to
   represent the diversity of urban and natural habitats in the Chicago
   metropolitan area. Species richness was assessed for each site. Patterns
   of habitat use were inferred from collection records. In urban areas, we
   collected 33 species, belonging to 15 genera and 5 families. Areas of
   preserved natural habitat yielded 44 species, in 20 genera, and 6
   families. Twenty species were common to both urban areas and areas of
   preserved natural habitat. Species at each site were ranked by the
   number of times they were collected. The bees most often collected in
   urban areas were widely-distributed species documented in other urban
   areas. Areas of preserved natural habitat harbored a higher richness of
   species, and the species most-often collected in these areas were native
   to North America. Urban sites with native plant species harbored
   significantly more bees than urban sites lacking native vegetation
   (t-test, two-tailed assuming unequal variances, P < 0.001). In urban
   areas, native bees were more likely to be captured on native flowers
   (c(2), Yates statistic, P < 0.01). Chicago's bee fauna is comparable in
   richness to the bee fauna of other cities which have been surveyed,
   notably Phoenix, AZ (Mc Intyre and Hostelter 2001), Berkeley, CA
   (Frankie et al. 2005), and New York City, NY, (Matteson et al. 2008). A
   comparison of our species list to another, recently-published survey of
   Chicago bees by Toinetto et al. (2011), revealed only 24 species
   overlap, from a combined total list of 93 species. The combined species
   list from these two surveys shares only 44 species in common with the
   169 species documented by Pearson (1933) in his extensive survey of
   Chicago bees.}},

   (2012) Collection of pollen grains by Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata Smith
   (Apidae: Centridini): Is C. tarsata an oligolectic or polylectic
   species? Zoological Studies 51(2): 195-203. Among pollinator species,
   bees play a prominent role in maintaining biodiversity because they are
   responsible, on average, for 80\% of angiosperm pollination in tropical
   regions. The species richness of the bee genus Centris is high in South
   America. In Brazil, these bees occur in many types of ecosystems.
   Centris tarsata is an endemic species occurring only in Brazil. No
   previous studies considered interactions between plants and this bee
   species in southern Brazil, where it is the most abundant trap-nesting
   bee. Accordingly, the goals of this study were to investigate plants
   used by this species for its larval food supply and determine if this
   bee is polylectic or oligolectic in this region. This work was conducted
   in the Parque Municipal das Araucarias, Guarapuava (PR), southern
   Brazil, from Mar. 2002 to Dec. 2003. Samples of pollen were collected
   from nests of these bees and from flowering plants in grassland and
   swamp areas where the nests were built. All of the samples were treated
   with acetolysis to obtain permanent slides. The family Solanaceae was
   visited most often (71\%). Solanum americanum Mill. (28.6\%) and Sol.
   variabile Mart. (42.4\%) were the primary pollen sources for C. tarsata
   in the study area. We found that although C. tarsata visited 20 species
   of plants, it preferred Solanum species with poricidal anthers and
   pollen grains with high protein levels. This selective behavior by
   females of C. tarsata indicates that these bees are oligolectic in their
   larval provisioning in this region of southern Brazil.

Abstract = {{The diversity of stingless bees throughout Peninsular Malaysia is poorly

   despite their known ecological value and sensitivity to disturbance,
   stingless bees cannot currently be used as indicators to compare the
   health of undisturbed foreses to that of human-altered landscapes in
   Peninsular Malaysia. We undertook an extensive survey of stingless bee
   diversity in and around six lowland, hill, and upper hill dipterocarp
   forest reserves located in four different states in Peninsular Malaysia.
   Sugar-water baiting at 486 sampling stations resulted in the collection
   of stingless bees from 17 different species. We used an NMDS ordination
   to compare the communities found at the different sites. We also
   compared the species we collected to those recorded by previous studies
   carried out in nearby Borneo. Our findings provide baseline data on
   stingless bee diversity in forests throughout Peninsular Malaysia.}},

Abstract = {{Animals collecting patchily distributed resources are faced with complex
   multi-location routing problems. Rather than comparing all possible
   routes, they often find reasonably short solutions by simply moving to
   the nearest unvisited resources when foraging. Here, we report the
   travel optimization performance of bumble-bees (Bombus terrestris)
   foraging in a flight cage containing six artificial flowers arranged
   such that movements between nearest-neighbour locations would lead to a
   long suboptimal route. After extensive training (80 foraging bouts and
   at least 640 flower visits), bees reduced their flight distances and
   prioritized shortest possible routes, while almost never following
   nearest-neighbour solutions. We discuss possible strategies used during
   the establishment of stable multi-location routes (or traplines), and
   how these could allow bees and other animals to solve complex routing
   problems through experience, without necessarily requiring a
   sophisticated cognitive representation of space.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar guides, contrasting patterns on flowers that supposedly direct
   pollinators towards a concealed nectar reward, are taxonomically
   widespread. However, there have been few studies of their functional
   significance and effects on plant fitness. Most previous studies focused
   on pollinator behaviour and used artificial flowers in laboratory
   settings. We experimentally investigated the role of putative nectar
   guides in a natural system: the South African iris Lapeirousia oreogena,
   whose flowers have a clearly visible pattern of six white arrow-markings
   pointing towards the narrow entrance of the long corolla tube, and its
   sole pollinator, a long-proboscid nemestrinid fly. We painted over none,
   some or all of the white arrow-markings with ink that matched the colour
   of the corolla background. Although arrow-marking removal had little
   effect on the approaches by flies to flowers from a distance, it
   dramatically reduced the likelihood of proboscis insertion. Export of
   pollen dye analogue (an estimate of male fitness) was reduced to almost
   zero in flowers from which all nectar guides had been removed, and fruit
   set (a measure of female fitness) was also significantly reduced. Our
   results confirm that the markings on L. oreogena flowers serve as nectar
   guides and suggest that they are under strong selective maintenance
   through both male and female fitness components in this pollination
   system.}},

   adaptations to a new photic environment. We used DNA sequences to
   evaluate the phylogenetic history of the most diverse clade of Apoidea
   that is adapted to dim-light environments (Augochlorini: Megalopta,
   Megaloptidia and Megommation). The most speciose lineage, Megalopta, is
   distal to the remaining dim-light genera, and its closest diurnal
   relative (Xenochlora) is recovered as a lineage that has secondarily
   reverted to diurnal foraging. Tests for adaptive protein evolution
   indicate that long-wavelength opsin shows strong evidence of stabilizing
   selection, with no more than five codons (2\%) under positive selection,
   depending on analytical procedure. In the branch leading to Megalopta,
   the amino acid of the single positively selected codon is conserved
   among ancestral Halictidae examined, and is homologous to codons known
   to influence molecular structure at the chromophore-binding pocket.
   Theoretically, such mutations can shift photopigment lambda(max)
   sensitivity and enable visual transduction in alternate photic
   environments. Results are discussed in light of the available evidence
   on photopigment structure, morphological specialization and
   biogeographic distributions over geological time.}},

Title = {{Organic Farming Improves Pollination Success in Strawberries}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Pollination of insect pollinated crops has been found to be correlated
   to pollinator abundance and diversity. Since organic farming has the
   potential to mitigate negative effects of agricultural intensification
   on biodiversity, it may also benefit crop pollination, but direct
   evidence of this is scant. We evaluated the effect of organic farming on
   pollination of strawberry plants focusing on (1) if pollination success
   was higher on organic farms compared to conventional farms, and (2) if
   there was a time lag from conversion to organic farming until an effect
   was manifested. We found that pollination success and the proportion of
   fully pollinated berries were higher on organic compared to conventional
   farms and this difference was already evident 2-4 years after conversion
   to organic farming. Our results suggest that conversion to organic
   farming may rapidly increase pollination success and hence benefit the
   ecosystem service of crop pollination regarding both yield quantity and
   quality.}},

Title = {{Pollination success of Lotus corniculatus (L.) in an urban context}},
Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Pages = {{94-100}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Most anthropogenic activities are known to have deleterious effects on
   pollinator communities. However, little is known about the influence of
   urbanization on pollination ecosystem services.
   Here, we assessed the pollination service on Lotus corniculatus (L), a
   self-sterile, strictly entogamous Fabaceae commonly observed in urban
   and suburban areas. We assessed the pollination success of artificial
   Lotus corniculatus populations at three levels: at large scale, along an
   urbanization gradient; at intermediate scale, based on landscape
   fragmentation within a 250 m radius and at local scale based on floral
   resource abundance and local habitat type.
   The main findings were that the pollination success, when assessed with
   the number of fruit produced per inflorescence, was lower in urban areas
   than in suburban ones, and was negatively affected by the number of
   impervious spaces in the neighborhood. The relationship between the
   number of fruits and the distance to the nearest impervious space was
   either positive or negative, depending on the gray/green ratio (low vs.
   high). Finally, on a local scale, floral resource abundance had a
   negative effect on pollination success when L corniculatus populations
   were located in paved courtyards, and a positive one when they were
   located in parks.
   Pollination success seems to be explained by two intertwined gradients:
   landscape fragmentation estimated by the number of impervious spaces in
   a 250 m radius around L corniculatus populations, and the behavior of
   bumblebees toward birdsfoot trefoil and floral displays, which appears
   to differ depending on whether a neighborhood is densely or sparsely
   urbanized. An abundance of attracting floral resources seems to enhance
   pollination success for L corniculatus if it is not too isolated from
   other green spaces.
   These results have important implications for the sustainability of
   pollination success in towns by identifying local and landscape factors
   that influence reproductive success of a common plant. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification is a major cause for the decline in species
   diversity in human-modified landscapes. The loss of functionally
   important species can reduce a variety of ecosystem functions, such as
   pollination and seed dispersal, but the intricate relationships between
   land-use intensity, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are still
   contentious. Along a gradient from forest to intensively used farmland,
   we quantified bee species richness, visitation rates of bees and
   pollination success of wild cherry trees (Prunus avium). We analysed the
   effects of structural habitat diversity at a local scale and of the
   proportion of suitable habitat around each tree at a landscape scale. We
   compared these findings with those from previous studies of
   seed-dispersing birds and mammals in the same model system and along the
   same land-use gradient. Bee species richness and visitation rates were
   found to be highest in structurally simple habitats, whereas bird
   species richness-but not their visitation rates-were highest in
   structurally complex habitats. Mammal visitation rates were only
   influenced at the landscape scale. These results show that different
   functional groups of animals respond idiosyncratically to gradients in
   habitat and landscape structure. Despite strong effects on bees and
   birds, pollination success and bird seed removal did not differ along
   the land-use gradient at both spatial scales. These results suggest that
   mobile organisms, such as bees and birds, move over long distances in
   intensively used landscapes and thereby buffer pollination and
   seed-dispersal interactions. We conclude that measures of species
   richness and interaction frequencies are not sufficient on their own to
   understand the ultimate consequences of land-use intensification on
   ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronizing Megachile rotundata (F.) nesting activity with alfalfa
   bloom is essential for ensuring optimal pollination for alfalfa seed
   production. This is achieved by timing the initiation of spring bee
   incubation so that adults will emerge similar to 2 wk before peak bloom.
   If weather conditions change so as to delay the bloom, bee managers will
   commonly expose the developing bees to a period of low-temperature
   incubation to slow their development. We have previously demonstrated
   survival during low-temperature incubation can be significantly
   increased by using a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR) where the bees
   receive a daily pulse at 20 degrees C. A FTR incubation protocol is
   composed of a number of different components, such as the base and pulse
   temperatures, and the duration and frequency of the pulse. In this
   investigation, the effect of the duration of the pulse (5-120 min) and
   the frequency of a pulse (twice daily to weekly) on the survival of
   developing M. rotundata was examined. A pulse as short as 5 min at 20
   degrees C increased survival of the developing bees as compared with the
   constant 6 degrees C controls. Increasing the pulse duration induced a
   further increase in tolerance to 6 degrees C. As with the pulse
   duration, increasing the pulse frequency from once weekly to twice daily
   had a significant effect on improving the bees tolerance to
   low-temperature incubation. This investigation further strengthens the
   argument that a FTR protocol is superior to using a constant
   low-temperature exposure for interrupting the spring incubation of M.

Abstract = {{The foraging behavior of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens Cresson) was
   examined as a function of feeder location containing sugar solution in a
   commercial tomato greenhouse in Manotick, Ontario, Canada. The feeders
   were located within the nest-box (fed-close) or placed 1.5 m away
   (fed-far) and the placement of the two types of colonies was
   counterbalanced over time. No effect of feeder location was found in
   colony activity levels or in pollen load size. A foraging trade-off
   between sugar solution and pollen collection, however, was found: the
   proportion of foraging trips in which pollen was brought back was
   significantly reduced for fed-far colonies, which contrasts with our
   laboratory study in which the opposite effect was found. We interpret
   our findings as possibly reflecting a limitation in pollen supply in the
   greenhouse: an already possibly strained ability to find and bring back
   pollen to the colony was accentuated by increasing the task demands of
   collecting sugar solution.}},

Abstract = {{The manner by which pollinators move across a landscape and their
   resulting preferences and/or avoidances of travel through particular
   habitat types can have a significant impact on plant population genetic
   structure and population-level connectivity. We examined the spatial
   genetic structure of the understory tree Cornus florida (Cornaceae)
   adults (N-Adults = 452) and offspring (N-Offspring = 736) across two
   mating events to determine the extent to which pollen pool genetic
   covariance is influenced by intervening forest architecture. Resident
   adults showed no spatial partitioning but genotypes were positively
   autocorrelated up to a distance of 35 m suggesting a pattern of
   restricted seed dispersal. In the offspring, selfing rates were small
   (s(m) = 0.035) whereas both biparental inbreeding (s(b;open) (canopy) =
   0.16, s(b;closed canopy) = 0.11) and correlated paternity (r(p;open
   canopy) = 0.21, r(p;closed canopy) = 0.07) were significantly influenced
   by primary canopy opening above individual mothers. The spatial
   distribution of genetic covariance in pollen pool composition was
   quantified for each reproductive event using Pollination Graphs, a
   network method based upon multivariate conditional genetic covariance.
   The georeferenced graph topology revealed a significant positive
   relationship between genetic covariance and pollinator movement through
   C. florida canopies, a negative relationship with open primary canopy
   (e. g., roads under open canopies and fields with no primary canopy),
   and no relationship with either conifer or mixed hardwood canopy species
   cover. These results suggest that both resident genetic structure within
   stands and genetic connectivity between sites in C. florida populations
   are influenced by spatial heterogeneity of mating individuals and
   quality of intervening canopy cover.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first pollination data on Neotropical species of
   Violaceae with actinomorphic flowers. Floral biology of Paypayrola
   blanchetiana and Amphirrhox longifolia were studied in Brazilian
   Atlantic rainforest. Petals of both species form a corolla tube,
   restricting access to floral rewards to visitors with long mouth parts.
   Flowers lack a spur, common in zygomorphic Violaceae, to store nectar.
   Both species' flowers open in the evening and continue flowering during
   daytime. They emit a sweet scent dominated by benzenoid and
   monoterpenoid compounds. While A. longifolia flowers are nectarless,
   flowers of P. blanchetiana produce nectar throughout anthesis. A wide
   range of night- and day-active visitors, including moths, bees, and
   butterflies, were observed at P. blanchetiana; 68\% of all nocturnal
   visits took place at dawn. Fruit set of P. blanchetiana was
   extraordinarily low. Nectar production and pollen presentation occur in
   close proximity, and pollen dissolves in accumulating nectar. After
   contact with nectar, experimental pollen germination rates were near 0.
   Amphirrhox longifolia flowers received few visits by diurnal and
   nocturnal bees and pollen-collecting Heliconius butterflies. Fruit set
   was still low (11\%) but was ten times higher than that in P.
   blanchetiana (1\%). Low fruit set seems to result from diminished pollen
   viability through nectar contact in P. blanchetiana and pollinator
   limitation in A. longifolia.}},

Title = {{Abundance and diversity of wild bees along gradients of heavy metal
   pollution}},

Abstract = {{1. Wild bees are one of the most important groups of pollinators in the
   temperate zone. Therefore, population declines have potentially negative
   impacts for both crop and wildflower pollination. Although heavy metal
   pollution is recognized to be a problem affecting large parts of the
   European Union, we currently lack insights into the effects of heavy
   metals on wild bees.
   2. We investigated whether heavy metal pollution is a potential threat
   to wild bee communities by comparing (i) species number, (ii) diversity
   and (iii) abundance as well as (iv) natural mortality of emerging bees
   along two independent gradients of heavy metal pollution, one at Olkusz
   (OLK), Poland and the other at Avonmouth (AVO), UK. We used standardized
   nesting traps to measure species richness and abundance of wild bees,
   and we recorded the heavy metal concentration in pollen collected by the
   red mason bee Osmia rufa as a measure of pollution.
   3. The concentration of cadmium, lead and zinc in pollen collected by
   bees ranged from a background level in unpolluted sites {[}OLK: 1 3, 43
   4, 99 8 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 0 8, 42 0, 56 0 (mg kg(-1)), respectively] to
   a high level on sites in the vicinity of the OLK and AVO smelters
   {[}OLK: 6.7, 277.0, 440.1 (mg kg(-1)); AVO: 9.3, 356.2, 592.4 (mg
   kg(-1)), respectively].
   4. We found that with increasing heavy metal concentration, there was a
   steady decrease in the number, diversity and abundance of solitary, wild
   bees. In the most polluted sites, traps were empty or contained single
   occupants, whereas in unpolluted sites, the nesting traps collected from
   4 to 5 species represented by up to ten individuals. Moreover, the
   proportion of dead individuals of the solitary bee Megachile ligniseca
   increased along the heavy metal pollution gradient at OLK from 0.2 in
   uncontaminated sites to 0.5 in sites with a high concentration of
   pollution.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight the negative
   relationship between heavy metal pollution and populations of wild bees
   and suggest that increasing wild bee richness in highly contaminated
   areas will require special conservation strategies. These may include
   creating suitable nesting sites and sowing a mixture of flowering plants
   as well as installing artificial nests with wild bee cocoons in polluted
   areas. Applying protection plans to wild pollinating bee communities in
   heavy metal-contaminated areas will contribute to integrated land
   rehabilitation to minimize the impact of pollution on the environment.}},

Title = {{Spatial and temporal variation in pollinator effectiveness: do unmanaged
   insects provide consistent pollination services to mass flowering crops?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent declines in honeybee populations have focused attention on the
   potential for unmanaged insects to replace them as pollinators of food
   crops. The capacity of unmanaged pollinators to replace services
   currently provided by honeybees depends on the spatial and temporal
   variability of these services, but few quantitative assessments
   currently exist.
   2. We investigated spatial variation in pollinator importance by
   comparing pollinator efficiency and effectiveness in stigmatic pollen
   loads, stigmatic contact and visitation rate between honeybees and the
   seven most abundant unmanaged taxa in 2007. We assessed temporal
   variability in pollinator visitation using floral visits recorded three
   times a day over four consecutive years (2005-2008) in 43 `Pak Choi'
   Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis mass flowering fields in the Canterbury
   region of New Zealand. Further, we compared the aggregate effect of the
   unmanaged pollinator assemblage to the managed honeybee.
   3. Pak Choi was visited by many insect species that vary in abundance
   and effectiveness as pollen transfer agents. There was spatial variation
   in the four measures of pollinator importance. Pollen deposited on
   stigmas and flower visits per minute were not significantly different
   comparing the unmanaged assemblage to honeybees, although stigmatic
   contact and visitor abundance per number of open flowers were greater in
   honeybees.
   4. Unmanaged taxa were frequent visitors to the crop in all 4 years. The
   pooled services provided by the unmanaged assemblage did not differ
   within a day and were equal to or greater than those provided by
   honeybees in 2 of the 4 years. Pollinator importance changed little
   irrespective of the spatial and temporal variations among taxa.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The results of this study suggest that
   some unmanaged insect taxa are capable of providing consistent
   pollination services over a 4-year period in a commercial mass flowering
   crop. As these taxa already contribute substantially to the pollination
   of food crops, they offer a safety net in the case of sudden collapse of
   managed honeybee hives. To optimize pollination services, we recommend
   pollinator-specific farm management practices that consider the needs of
   both managed and unmanaged pollinator taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships within the orchid subtribe Oncidiinae sensu
   Chase were inferred using maximum likelihood analyses of single and
   multilocus DNA sequence data sets. Analyses included both nuclear
   ribosomal internal transcribed spacer DNA and plastid regions (matK
   exon, trnH-psbA intergenic spacer and two portions of ycf1 exon) for 736
   individuals representing approximately 590 species plus seven outgroup
   taxa. Based on the well resolved and highly supported results, we
   recognize 61 genera in Oncidiinae. Mimicry of oil-secreting
   Malpighiaceae and other floral syndromes evolved in parallel across the
   subtribe, and many clades exhibit extensive variation in
   pollination-related traits. Because previous classifications heavily
   emphasized these floral features, many genera recognized were not
   monophyletic. Our classification based on monophyly will facilitate
   focused monographs and clarifies the evolution of morphological and
   biochemical traits of interest within this highly diverse subtribe. (C)

Abstract = {{Nectarivorous flower mites (Mesostigmata: Melicharidae) live mostly on
   hummingbird-pollinated plants in the New World. We observed
   Proctolaelaps sp. living on Neoregelia johannis (Bromeliaceae) in a

   this bromeliad lasted a single day. We recorded mites moving into,
   feeding from, presumably mating and reproducing, and exiting bromeliad
   flowers within just a single day. We observed three ant species
   predating flower mites on bromeliads. The main visitor was the bumblebee
   Bombus morio, which always landed on the inflorescence to access nectar
   inside the bromeliad flowers. We found Proctolaelaps sp. mites on 47\%
   of 38 bumblebees inspected, with each Bombus hosting 2 mites on average;
   only adults and mostly female mites (93\%) usually found on the
   bumblebees' gula region of the head. This is the first study to document
   nectarivorous flower mites living on a melittophilous host plant using
   bumblebees for phoretic dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of genetic integrity of parental populations is often
   explained by selection against hybrids. However, the selection agents
   are usually unknown. The role of environmental biotic interactions is
   often suspected but has rarely been demonstrated. In plants for
   instance, mutualism with pollinators may be involved. After verification
   that pollen deposition is a limiting factor for fruit set, we used an
   individual-based study and a representation of pollinator colour
   perception to test the effects of local plant density and floral colour
   neighbourhood on female reproductive success in an Antirrhinum hybrid
   zone. In addition to flower colour and density effects, the composition
   of the floral neighbourhood was found to influence fruit set, suggesting
   that most plants were usually better fertilized when similar to their
   neighbours. However, the plants of one particular type were sometimes
   favoured when very different from their neighbours. The implications for
   hybrid zone dynamics are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Winter-flowering plants outside the tropics may
   experience a shortage of pollinator service, given that insect activity
   is largely limited by low temperature. Birds can be alternative
   pollinators for these plants, but experimental evidence for the
   pollination role of birds in winter-flowering plants is scarce.
   Methods Pollinator visitation to the loquat, Eriobotrya japonica
   (Rosaceae), was observed across the flowering season from November to
   January for two years in central China. Self-and cross-hand pollination
   was conducted in the field to investigate self-compatibility and pollen
   limitation. In addition, inflorescences were covered by bird cages and
   nylon mesh nets to exclude birds and all animal pollinators,
   respectively, to investigate the pollination role of birds in seed
   production.
   Results Self-fertilization in the loquat yielded few seeds. In early
   winter insect visit frequency was relatively higher, while in late
   winter insect pollinators were absent and two passerine birds
   (Pycnonotus sinensis and Zosterops japonicus) became the major floral
   visitors. However, seed-set of open-pollinated flowers did not differ
   between early and late winter. Exclusion of bird visitation greatly
   reduced seed-set, indicating that passerine birds were important
   pollinators for the loquat in late winter. The whitish perigynous
   flowers reward passerines with relatively large volumes of dilute
   nectar. Our observation on the loquat and other Rosaceae species
   suggested that perigyny might be related to bird pollination but the
   association needs further study.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that floral traits and phenology
   would be favoured to attract bird pollinators in cold weather, in which
   insect activity is limited.}},

Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{563-570}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The number of flowers blooming simultaneously on a plant may have
   profound consequences for reproductive success. Large floral displays
   often attract more pollinator visits, increasing outcross pollen
   receipt. However, pollinators frequently probe more flowers in sequence
   on large displays, potentially increasing self-pollination and reducing
   pollen export per flower. To better understand how floral display size
   influences male and female fitness, we manipulated display phenotypes
   and then used paternity analysis to quantify siring success and selfing
   rates.
   To facilitate unambiguous assignment of paternity, we established four
   replicate (cloned) arrays of Mimulus ringens, each consisting of genets
   with unique combinations of homozygous marker genotypes. In each array,
   we trimmed displays to two, four, eight or 16 flowers. When fruits
   ripened, we counted the number of seeds per fruit and assigned paternity
   to 1935 progeny.
   Siring success per flower declined sharply with increasing display size,
   while female success per flower did not vary with display. The rate of
   self-fertilization increased for large floral displays, but siring
   losses due to geitonogamous pollen discounting were much greater than
   siring gains through increased self-fertilization. As display size
   increased, each additional seed sired through geitonogamous
   self-pollination was associated with a loss of 97 seeds sired through
   outcrossing.
   Although total fitness increased with floral display size, the marginal
   return on each additional flower declined steadily as display size
   increased. Therefore, a plant could maximize fitness by producing small
   displays over a long flowering period, rather than large displays over a
   brief flowering period.}},

Abstract = {{Garcinia brasiliensis Mart., a species from the Amazon and Atlantic
   rainforests, is cryptic dioecious because the morphologically perfect
   flowers are in fact pistillate given the absence of pollen. The flowers
   present diurnal anthesis, have a sweet and mild scent, and are
   pollinated by bees in search of the nectar secreted by evident
   nectaries. The flowers of Clusiaceae bear nectaries of staminodial
   origin. In Garcinia, the nectaries have been interpreted as being of
   receptacular origin or as sterile reproductive organs. Our aim in this
   study was to analyze the nature of the indefinite perianth, the
   differential development of the androecium in relation to the sexual
   system, and the origin of the nectaries from the perspective of floral
   biology and evolution. Floral anatomy and ontogeny were analyzed using
   both LM and SEM. The species has bracteoles that surround the flower
   buds. The perianth consists of tepals that are very similar to the
   bracteoles and that show a centripetal and gradual decrease of mesophyll
   and cuticle thickness. Developmental irregularities in the anthers lead
   to a reduction of pollen production in staminate flowers and complete
   male sterility in pistillate flowers because of peri- and postmeiotic
   cell degeneration. Both floral forms have nectaries, the origin of which
   we discuss, leading to hypotheses about their nature.}},

Abstract = {{Although pollinators are thought to select on flower colour, few studies

   analysis and phenotypic manipulations to measure the effect of petal
   colour on visitation and pollen export at two spatial scales in
   Wahlenbergia albomarginata. This species is representative of many New
   Zealand alpine herbs that have secondarily evolved white or pale
   flowers. The major pollinators, solitary bees, exerted phenotypic
   selection on flower size but not colour, quantified by bee vision. When
   presented with manipulated flowers, bees visited flowers painted blue to
   resemble a congener over white flowers in large, but not small,
   experimental arrays. Pollen export was higher for blue flowers in large
   arrays. Pollinator preference does not explain the pale colouration of
   W. albomarginata, as commonly hypothesized. Absence of bright blue could
   be driven instead by indirect selection of correlated characters.}},

Abstract = {{Several bumble bee (Bombus) species in North America have undergone
   range reductions and rapid declines in relative abundance. Pathogens
   have been suggested as causal factors, however, baseline data on
   pathogen distributions in a large number of bumble bee species have not
   been available to test this hypothesis. In a nationwide survey of the
   US, nearly 10,000 specimens of 36 bumble bee species collected at 284
   sites were evaluated for the presence and prevalence of two known Bombus
   pathogens, the microsporidium Nosema bombi and trypanosomes in the genus
   Crithidia. Prevalence of Crithidia was <= 10\% for all host species
   examined but was recorded from 21\% of surveyed sites. Crithidia was
   isolated from 15 of the 36 Bombus species screened, and were most
   commonly recovered from Bombus bifarius, Bombus bimaculatus, Bombus
   impatiens and Bombus mixtus. Nosema bombi was isolated from 22 of the 36
   US Bombus species collected. Only one species with more than 50 sampled
   bees, Bombus appositus, was free of the pathogen; whereas, prevalence
   was highest in Bombus occidentalis and Bombus pensylvanicus, two species
   that are reportedly undergoing population declines in North America. A
   variant of a tetranucleotide repeat in the internal transcribed spacer
   (ITS) of the N. bombi rRNA gene, thus far not reported from European
   isolates, was isolated from ten US Bombus hosts, appearing in varying
   ratios in different host species. Given the genetic similarity of the
   rRNA gene of N. bombi sampled in Europe and North America to date, the
   presence of a unique isolate in US bumble could reveal one or more
   native North American strains and indicate that N. bombi is enzootic
   across the Holarctic Region, exhibiting some genetic isolation. (C) 2011

Title = {{Spatial autocorrelation in honeybee foraging activity reveals optimal

Abstract = {{A substantial honeybee decline is being observed worldwide. Agricultural
   intensification and loss of wild floral resources rank among the main
   factors contributing to this decline. Landscape enhancement of floral
   resources has been proposed as an agro-environmental scheme intended to
   provide honeybees with compensatory food sources in intensive
   agrosystems. Floral scheme efficiency has rarely been evaluated with
   respect to landscape context. In this study, we developed and validated
   a modeling tool to delineate the landscape areas likely to be associated
   with higher efficiency of floral enhancement schemes. In particular, the
   proximity of some landscape elements used by honeybees, either as
   foraging habitat or as visual landmark for orientation, may partly
   determine floral scheme efficiency. We investigated this issue using
   resource selection functions (RSFs), i.e. models that aim to predict the
   occurrence of foraging honeybees at floral patches as a function of the
   presence of keystone landscape elements in their proximity. However,
   deciding which landscape elements are effectively in the proximity or
   not is mostly a matter of subjectivity. The novelty of our approach
   resides in its use of a distance-weighting function to explicitly
   account for the spatial location of surrounding landscape elements. In
   that respect, a distance function should be scaled on movement patterns
   of foraging organisms. Herein, we inferred movement patterns from the
   autocorrelative properties of honeybee foraging activity. This modeling
   approach was developed on Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia) field margin
   strips, a typical ``honeybee-friendly{''} floral scheme. A foraging
   survey conducted on 170 Phacelia plots (2 m x 2 m) from 17 Phacelia
   strips, all positioned within the foraging range of an experimental
   apiary, revealed that (i) the floral scheme efficiency is positively
   influenced by the presence of linear landscape elements such as
   hedgerows and forest edges, but negatively affected by the presence of
   alternative floral resources, and that (ii) weighting the relative
   importance of those landscape elements by incorporating a distance
   function into models considerably improved their predictive power. This
   modeling tool has the potential to help land managers optimizing their
   financial investment by avoiding low-efficiency landscape areas, or
   favoring high-efficiency ones, at the time of planning floral
   enhancement schemes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The species richness of flower-visiting insects has declined in past
   decades, raising concerns that the ecosystem service they provide by
   pollinating crops and wild plants is threatened. The relative commonness
   of different species with shared ecological traits can play a pervasive
   role in determining ecosystem functioning, but information on changes in
   abundances of pollinators over time is lacking. We gathered data on
   relative abundances of bumble-bee species in Swedish red clover fields
   during three periods in the last 70 years (1940s, 1960s and present),
   and on clover seed yields since 1921. We found drastic decreases in
   bumble-bee community evenness, with potential consequences for level and
   stability of red clover seed yield. The relative abundances of two
   short-tongued bumble-bees have increased from 40 per cent in the 1940s
   to entirely dominate present communities with 89 per cent. Average seed
   yield declined in recent years and variation in yield doubled,
   suggesting that the current dependence on few species for pollination
   has been especially detrimental to stability in seed yield. Our results
   suggest a need to develop management schemes that promote not only
   species-rich but also more evenly composed communities of
   service-providing organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices are essential for sustaining the human
   population, but at the same time they can directly disrupt ecosystem
   functioning. Ecological risk assessment (ERA) aims to estimate possible
   adverse effects of human activities on ecosystems and their parts.
   Current ERA practices, however, incorporate very little ecology and base
   the risk estimates on the results of standard tests with several
   standard species. The main obstacles for a more ecologically relevant
   ERA are the lack of clear protection goals and the inherent complexity
   of ecosystems that is hard to approach empirically. In this paper, we
   argue that the ecosystem services framework offers an opportunity to
   define clear and ecologically relevant protection goals. At the same
   time, ecological models provide the tools to address ecological
   complexity to the degree needed to link measurement endpoints and
   ecosystem services, and to quantify service provision and possible
   adverse effects from human activities. We focus on the ecosystem
   services relevant for agroecosystem functioning, including pollination,
   biocontrol and eutrophication effects and present modeling studies
   relevant for quantification of each of the services. The challenges of
   the ecosystem services approach are discussed as well as the limitations
   of ecological models in the context of ERA. A broad, multi-stakeholder
   dialog is necessary to aid the definition of protection goals in terms
   of services delivered by ecosystems and their parts. The need to capture
   spatio-temporal dynamics and possible interactions among service
   providers pose challenges for ecological models as a basis for decision
   making. However, we argue that both fields are advancing quickly and can
   prove very valuable in achieving more ecologically relevant ERA. (C)11

   the ability to correctly recognise and diagnose species. The B. lucorum
   complex (Bombus lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus) comprises one of
   the most abundant and important group of wild plant and crop pollinators
   in northern Europe. Although the workers of these species are
   notoriously difficult to diagnose morphologically, it has been claimed
   that queens are readily diagnosable from morphological characters. Here
   we assess the value of colour-pattern characters in species
   identification of DNA-barcoded queens from the B. lucorum complex. Three
   distinct molecular operational taxonomic units were identified each
   representing one species. However, no uniquely diagnostic colour-pattern
   character state was found for any of these three molecular units and
   most colour-pattern characters showed continuous variation among the
   units. All characters previously deemed to be unique and diagnostic for
   one species were displayed by specimens molecularly identified as a
   different species. These results presented here raise questions on the
   reliability of species determinations in previous studies and highlights
   the benefits of implementing DNA barcoding prior to ecological,
   taxonomic and conservation studies of these important key pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean type ecosystems are among the world's most fire-prone
   regions. Focusing on the Mediterranean basin, we review the literature
   and propose conceptual models to explain the direct and indirect effects
   of fire on plant-pollinator interactions, seed dispersers, and
   predators, as well as the temporal changes in these systems along
   post-fire succession and ecosystem recovery processes. Post-fire plant
   communities change in their composition, structure, floral resources, as
   well as seed and fruit resources. Fire directly affects communities of
   pollinators, seed dispersers, and seed predators mainly by mortality,
   and indirectly through changes in the quality and quantity of food and
   nesting resources. Pollinators, seed-dispersers, and seed predators
   depend on plant community composition and on the flower, seed, and fruit
   resources they produce. As a consequence, their community composition,
   structure, and function are expected to vary in response to post-fire
   temporal and spatial changes in plant communities, which in turn depend
   on fire severity, frequency, scale, and the distance from fire-edge, as
   well as their foraging range. In return, the changes resulting from fire
   in pollinator, seed-disperser and seed predator communities may affect
   plant fecundity and plant community composition.}},
