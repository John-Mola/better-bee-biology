Abstract = {{Similar to many vertebrate and invertebrate species, many fig wasp
   species are fighting other members of their species for mates. Fighting
   between the males of many non-pollinating fig wasp species involves
   injuries and fatalities. Studies have shown that large males fight for

   behaviors. To analyze male morphs in two non-pollinating fig wasps
   (Philotrypesis taida Wong \& Shiao, 2018 and Sycorycteridea taipeiensis
   Wong \& Shiao, 2018) associated with the fig tree Ficus benguetensis,
   the head and mandible allometry and injuries were examined as well as
   the morphologies of their heads and mandibles. Male fig wasps of these
   two nonpollinating species can be divided into two morphological groups
   according to their head and mandible shapes. Approximately 88\% of the
   Philotrypesis and 62\% of the Sycorycteridea males were injured and no
   males belonging to largest morphs were decapitated. Moreover, nearly
   31\% of the Philotrypesis and 45\% of the Sycorycteridea males left
   their natal figs. No difference in injury level or male exit rate
   between the male morphs was observed. This study reveals slight
   morphological and behavioral differences that may hint towards different

Title = {{Effects of Wetland Presence and Upland Land Use on Wild Hymenopteran and
   Dipteran Pollinators in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA}},
Journal = {{WETLANDS}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecosystem service that is in jeopardy globally.
   Decreasing trends in wild pollinator populations are primarily
   attributed to habitat loss and degradation. These concerns are
   especially apparent in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA where more
   than 90\% of the land has been cultivated and 90\% of the wetlands have
   been lost. We compared hymenopteran and dipteran pollinator abundance,
   richness, and diversity in 28 wetlands and their adjacent uplands within
   3 dominant land-condition types: cropped, restored, and reference state.
   We used vane traps to capture local pollinator insects and sweep nets to
   collect insect pollinators on flowers. Vane-trap captures revealed a
   greater abundance, richness, and diversity of hymenopteran pollinators
   in uplands as compared to wetlands over the entire growing season in all
   land-condition types. However, net collections showed that hymenopterans
   foraged more in wetlands than in uplands, especially in restored
   wetlands. The exception was September when hymenopterans were captured
   in uplands more than wetlands while feeding on late season forbs.
   Dipteran vane-trap and sweep-net captures primarily consisted of
   hoverflies (Syrphidae). Hoverflies were more abundant in wetlands than
   uplands. All pollinators used both wetlands and uplands for resources.
   Thus, insect-pollinator conservation can be enhanced by promoting native
   forb communities and pollinator habitat through wetland restoration and
   the planting of buffer strips.}},

   Colonies grew heavier near thiacloprid-treated clover compared to

Abstract = {{Aims The oases of Baja California Peninsula (BCP) have been proposed as
   important hotspots of biodiversity that hold an exceptional richness in
   the middle of desert conditions. We tested the effect of habitat and
   anthropogenic disturbance on communities of cavity-nesting taxa, with
   specific emphasis on bees, wasps, and their natural enemies. Methods In
   oases of BCP and desert neighbor environments, trap-nesting taxa were
   evaluated in response to factors affecting the nest abundance, richness,
   and community structure. We used statistical models to find correlates
   of nest abundance and patterns of diversity, as well as ecological
   analyses to determine the effect of habitat and human disturbance on
   species diversity and community structure. Results Solar irradiation,
   distance to a perennial waterbody and relative humidity influenced the
   presence of nests, number of brood cells, and parasitism. In general,
   abundance, species richness, and parasitism were higher in oases,
   especially in those with less human disturbance. Bees did not
   discriminate between oases and deserts to nest, whereas mud-daubing
   wasps were more dependent of oases. The degree of anthropogenic
   disturbance did not affect the occurrence of parasitism, but it had an
   adverse effect on the parasitism intensity (number of attacked cells).
   The community structure was more complex and even in oases and
   low-disturbed sites. The similarity between sites did not exceed 30\%,
   and the proportion of shared species between oases and deserts varied
   from 2.7\% to 26.6\%. Main conclusions The oases of Baja California are
   functioning as mesic islands in the desert, each oasis hosting a unique
   community of cavity-nesting taxa. About 65\% of the nests and 50\% of
   species occurred exclusively in the oasis. Thus, cavity-nesting species
   that depend on mesic conditions could be threatened if the oases of BCP
   disappear in the future. Local conditions in the oases and deserts of
   the BCP are shaping the community structure. However, large-scale
   factors such as climate can influence the seasonality and occurrence of
   species within the community of cavity-nesting dwellers. Since habitat
   loss and fragmentation can degrade the oases' functionality, strategies
   to maintain the ecosystem services of pollination and biological control
   should be included in the conservation programs of these fragile
   habitats.}},

Title = {{Are moths the missing pollinators in Subantarctic New Zealand?}},
Journal = {{POLAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{38}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{On offshore islands, flowers are typically small, simple in colour and
   shape and more reliant on wind- or self-pollination than insect-mediated
   pollination. Islands also tend to have a species-poor pollinating fauna.
   The New Zealand Subantarctic islands (latitude between about 46 degrees
   and 60 degrees) have a depauperate pollinator fauna. However, many
   flowers in this region are large, brightly coloured and apparently
   completely reliant on insect visitors for pollination. In the absence of
   bees and butterflies, moths and flies may be particularly important
   pollinators in the region. Using six Heath moth traps simultaneously
   over four nights in three different habitat types, 241 moths were
   caught, representing six species. We found that moths carried pollen
   identified to four plant species (Bulbinella rossii, Dracophyllum
   longifolium, Gentianella concinna and Acaena minor), with B. rossii and
   D. longifolium pollen being most abundant on moth bodies. Weather
   conditions explained moth abundance and distribution, but neither
   weather nor the number of moths caught were reliable predictors of their
   potential as pollinators; moths carried on average more pollen grains
   from more plant species in the shrubland despite harsh weather
   conditions and few individuals caught. Local flowering abundances may
   help explain this trend, with the predominance of D. longifolium
   flowering in the shrubland and B. rossii in the exposed megaherb field.
   This study is the first to provide evidence that moths may be capable of
   acting as pollinators in Subantarctic New Zealand, and that their
   contribution should not continue to be overlooked.}},

Title = {{Surprising absence of association between flower surface microstructure
   and pollination system}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{The epidermal cells of flowers come in different shapes and have
   different functions, but how they evolved remains largely unknown.
   Floral micro-texture can provide tactile cues to insects, and increases
   in surface roughness by means of conical (papillose) epidermal cells may
   facilitate flower handling by landing insect pollinators. Whether flower
   microstructure correlates with pollination system remains unknown. Here,
   we investigate the floral epidermal microstructure in 29 (congeneric)
   species pairs with contrasting pollination system. We test whether
   flowers pollinated by bees and/or flies feature more structured, rougher
   surfaces than flowers pollinated by non-landing moths or birds and
   flowers that self-pollinate. In contrast with earlier studies, we find
   no correlation between epidermal microstructure and pollination system.
   The shape, cell height and roughness of floral epidermal cells varies
   among species, but is not correlated with pollinators at large.
   Intriguingly, however, we find that the upper (adaxial) flower surface
   that surrounds the reproductive organs and often constitutes the floral
   display is markedly more structured than the lower (abaxial) surface. We
   thus conclude that conical epidermal cells probably play a role in plant
   reproduction other than providing grip or tactile cues, such as
   increasing hydrophobicity or enhancing the visual signal.}},

Title = {{Mating precedes selective immune priming which is maintained throughout
   bumblebee queen diapause}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the mechanisms by which organisms adapt to
   unfavourable conditions is a fundamental question in ecology and
   evolutionary biology. One such mechanism is diapause, a period of
   dormancy typically found in nematodes, fish, crustaceans and insects.
   This state is a key life-history event characterised by arrested
   development, suppressed metabolism and increased stress tolerance and
   allows an organism to avoid prolonged periods of harsh and inhospitable
   environmental conditions. For some species, diapause is preceded by
   mating which can have a profound effect on female behaviour, physiology
   and key biological processes, including immunity. However, our
   understanding of how mating impacts long-term immunity and whether these
   effects persist throughout diapause is currently limited. To address
   this, we explored molecular changes in the haemolymph of the
   ecologically important pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris. B. terrestris queens mate prior to entering diapause, a
   non-feeding period of arrested development that can last 6-9 months.
   Using mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, we quantified changes in the
   pre-diapause queen haemolymph after mating, as well as the subsequent
   protein expression of mated queens during and post-diapause.
   Results: Our analysis identified distinct proteome profiles associated
   with diapause preparation, maintenance and termination. More
   specifically, mating pre-diapause was followed by an increase in the
   abundance of antimicrobial peptides, key effectors of the immune system.
   Furthermore, we identified the elevated abundance of these proteins to
   be maintained throughout diapause. This finding was in contrast to the
   general reduction observed in immune proteins during diapause suggestive
   of selective immune priming and expression during diapause. Diapause
   also affected the expression of proteins involved in cuticular
   maintenance, olfaction, as well as proteins of unknown function, which
   may have roles in diapause regulation.
   Conclusions: Our results provide clear molecular evidence for the
   consequences and benefits of mating at the immune level as it precedes
   the selective increased abundance of antimicrobial peptides that are
   sustained throughout diapause. In addition, our results provide novel
   insights into the molecular mechanisms by which bumblebees prepare for,
   survive, and recover from diapause, insights that may have implications
   for our general understanding of these processes in other insect groups.}},

   strategy of bee pollinators. We determined the nectar production pattern
   and documented variations in the longevity of floral phases and
   stigmatic pollen loads of pollinator-visited and unvisited flowers.
   Bicolletes indigoticus (Colletidae) was the sole pollinator with females
   revisiting flowers in staminate and pistillate phases at short
   intervals, guaranteeing cross-pollen flow. Nectar stored in the nectar
   scale-staminode complex had a high sugar concentration and was produced
   continuously in minute amounts (0.09 mu l center dot h(-1)). Pushing the
   scales outward, bees took up nectar, triggering stamen movements and
   accelerating pollen presentation. Experimental simulation of this nectar
   uptake increased the number of moved stamens per hour by a factor of
   four. Flowers visited by pollinators received six-fold more pollen on
   the stigma than unvisited flowers, had shortened staminate and
   pistillate phases and increased fruit and seed set. Flower handling and
   foraging by Bicolletes indigoticus were consonant with the complex
   flower morphology and functioning of Blumenbachia insignis. Continuous
   nectar production in minute quantities but at high sugar concentration
   influences the pollen foraging of the bees. Partitioning of resources
   lead to absolute flower fidelity and stereotyped foraging behaviour by
   the sole effective oligolectic bee pollinator.}},

Title = {{Arid grassland bee communities: associated environmental variables and

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In recent years restoration project efforts in arid grasslands of the
   Pacific Northwest have increased; however, little is known about the bee
   communities in these areas or how restoration affects them. Native bees
   provide an essential ecosystem service through pollination of crops and
   native plants and understanding their response to restoration is a high
   priority. To address this issue, we conducted a three-year study in an
   arid bunchgrass prairie with three objectives: (1) describe the bee
   community of this unique grassland type and its temporal variability;
   (2) investigate environmental variables influencing the community; and
   (3) examine effects of restoration on the community. We identified 62
   bee species and found strong seasonal and inter-annual variation in bee
   abundance, richness, diversity, and species composition. Unexpectedly,
   these temporal trends did not correspond with patterns in floral
   resources; however, several variables were associated with variation in
   bee abundance, richness, and diversity among sites. Sites with high
   levels of litter cover had more bees, while sites with taller vegetation
   or more blooming flowers had greater species richness but lower
   diversity. We found no detectable effect of restoration on bee
   abundance, richness, diversity, or composition. Species composition at
   native sites differed from those in actively and passively restored
   sites, which did not differ from each other. Restored sites also had
   fewer flowers and differing floral composition relative to native sites.
   These results suggest that if grassland restoration is to benefit bees,
   efforts should focus on both expanding floral resources and enhancing
   variables that influence nesting habitat.}},

Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Flower-dwelling predators make flowers dangerous foraging sites for
   pollinators, potentially affecting their anti-predator behaviour.
   Moreover, predation vulnerability often varies among pollinators' body
   sizes with interspecific comparisons showing that smaller species are
   more vulnerable than larger ones. However, how intraspecific body size
   variation influences pollinator behaviour under predation risk is still
   unknown, especially under natural conditions. We hypothesized that
   bumblebee workers of different sizes will exhibit different foraging
   strategies under predation risk. We predict that (a) small workers
   should more often exhibit anti-predator behaviours than larger workers.
   We also hypothesized that the anti-predator behaviour should be
   influenced by predator size and reward availability; therefore, we
   expect (b) higher avoidance behaviour towards larger predator sizes and
   (c) more and longer visits to inflorescences with high nectar
   availability. Finally, we expect that (d) nectar availability should
   overcome the anti-predator behaviour in less vulnerable, large, workers.
   We recorded flower visitation, time spent and rejection behaviours of
   different sizes of Bombus terrestris (Apidae) workers (large, medium and
   small) to inflorescences of Alstroemeria aurea (Alstroemeriaceae) with
   different treatments of artificial spiders (small and large) and nectar
   availability (with, without). Anti-predator and foraging behaviour of
   bumblebees was affected by the size of the worker, the presence of
   artificial spiders and nectar availability. Large and medium size
   bumblebees strongly reduced flower visitation and time spent in the
   presence of artificial spiders, consistently avoiding flowers with
   spiders, regardless of spider size or nectar availability. Instead,
   small bumblebees seldom modified their behaviour when facing artificial
   spiders, only increasing their avoidance or decreasing their foraging
   time in nectarless flowers hosting large artificial spiders. This
   pattern of larger workers being more sensitive to predation risk than
   smaller ones at the intraspecific level in B. terrestris is contrary to
   the expected and acknowledged trend based on previous interspecific
   comparisons, but partially consistent with predictions of models of
   optimal foraging theory. Intraspecific behavioural variability was
   uncovered only when nectar was available, whereas artificial predator
   size rarely modified bumblebee anti-predator and foraging behaviour.
   Therefore, our findings suggest that the trade-off between maximizing
   resource intake and minimizing predation risk strongly varies across
   bumblebee worker body sizes.}},

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Urban areas consist of wide expanses of impervious surfaces which are
   known to negatively affect insect biodiversity in general, but green
   spaces within cities have the potential to provide necessary habitat and
   foraging resources. Although, communal gardens were primarily intended
   to provide fresh, regional food to denizens, these green islands also
   host a surprisingly high number of wild bee species. The gardens were
   characterized based on structural elements such as flower frequency, the
   relative percentage of lawn, trees, shrubs, planted crops and
   infrastructure (e.g. seating possibilities or garden houses). Further,
   the effects of different landscape structures surrounding the gardens
   and distance to the city center were analyzed on the total wild bee
   species richness and functional traits. Focusing on these putative
   influencing factors, statistical analyses calculating random decision
   forests along with generalized linear mixed models were applied. With
   113 observed wild bee species, communal gardens provide habitat for a
   quarter of all known species in Vienna. In conclusion, results revealed
   that only elements within the gardens had an effect on species richness,
   with flower frequency as the major positive driver. The examined
   communal gardens promote and conserve wild bees independent from the

Abstract = {{The variety, relative importance and eco-evolutionary stability of
   reproductive barriers are critical to understanding the processes of
   speciation and species persistence. Here we evaluated the strength of
   the biotic prezygotic and postzygotic isolation barriers between closely
   related morning glory species from Amazon canga savannahs. The flower
   geometry and flower visitor assemblage analyses supported pollination by
   the bees in lavender-flowered Ipomoea marabaensis and recruitment of
   hummingbirds as pollinators in red-flowered Ipomoea cavalcantei.
   Nevertheless, native bee species and alien honeybees foraged on flowers
   of both species. Real-time interspecific hybridization underscored
   functionality of the overlap in flower visitor assemblages, questioning
   the strength of prezygotic isolation underpinned by diversification in
   flower colour and geometry. Interspecific hybrids were fertile and
   produced offspring in nature. No significant asymmetry in interspecific
   hybridization and hybrid incompatibilities among offspring were found,
   indicating weak postmating and postzygotic isolation. The results
   suggested that despite floral diversification, the insular-type

Abstract = {{Improving pollinator habitat on farmlands is needed to further wild bee
   conservation and to sustain crop pollination in light of relationships
   between global declines in pollinators and reductions in floral
   resources. One management strategy gaining much attention is the use of
   wildflower strips planted alongside crops to provide supplemental floral
   resources for pollinators. However, farmer adoption of
   pollinator-friendly strategies has been minimal, likely due to
   uncertainty about costs and benefits of providing non-crop flowering
   plants for bees. Over 3 yr, on four diversified farms in Montana, United
   States, we estimated the potential economic profit of harvesting and
   selling wildflower seeds collected from flower strips implemented for
   wild bee conservation, as an incentive for farmers to adopt this
   management practice. We compared the potential profitability of selling
   small retail seed packets versus bulk wholesale seed. Our economic
   analyses indicated that potential revenue from retail seed sales
   exceeded the costs associated with establishing and maintaining
   wildflower strips after the second growing season. A wholesale approach,
   in contrast, resulted in considerable net economic losses. We provide
   proof-of-concept that, under retail scenarios, the sale of native
   wildflower seeds may provide an alternative economic benefit that, to
   our knowledge, remains unexplored. The retail seed-sales approach could
   encourage greater farmer adoption of wildflower strips as a

   Insect predators and parasitoids were abundant and may not only reduce

Abstract = {{Many species must learn to identify their predators, but little is known

   to avoid dangerous patches. To answer these questions, we allowed
   bumblebees to forage in an enclosed meadow of 15 artificial flowers
   containing a yellow female crab spider, Thomisus onustus. Flowers were
   yellow in half of the trials and white in the other half. Spiders could
   remain at the same flower throughout the experiment or swap flowers
   between bee foraging bouts. Of the 60 bees used in the experiment, eight
   were killed by the spiders and nine stopped foraging without finishing
   the trial. Death or refusal to forage typically occurred early in the
   trial. Regardless of the treatment, the probability of landing at the

Abstract = {{In flowers of Nymphaea and Victoria, carpellary appendages are regarded
   as structures related to pollination by deceit of night-blooming
   species. In this study, the anatomy, histochemistry and ultrastructure
   of carpellary appendages were analysed to investigate their possible
   role in the production of volatile compounds in nocturnal species
   Nymphaea amazonum, N. gardneriana, N. prolifera (Nymphaea subgenus
   Hydrocallis) and Victoria cruziana, and in diurnal species N. caerulea
   (Nymphaea subgenus Brachyceras). Carpellary appendages were studied
   using light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy
   from pre-anthesis to the second day of anthesis. Anatomical and
   ultrastructural features are characteristic of osmophores. In all
   species, the most frequent components in secretory cells are
   amyloplasts, lipid bodies, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum and
   elaioplasts. The epidermis and multilayered parenchyma accumulate
   abundant starch grains and lipophilic substances, both of which vanish
   during anthesis. Amorphous substances are deposited between the
   plasmalemma and the outer cell wall of epidermal cells, and are then
   released by cuticular diffusion. Odour production in carpellary
   appendages might be an ancient role of primary importance both in
   diurnal and nocturnal species that are pollinated by deceit. Olfactory
   and visual cues of small carpellary appendages in Nymphaea subgenus
   Brachyceras correspond to bee pollination, and large carpellary
   appendages in subgenus Hydrocallis and Victoria represent parallel

Abstract = {{Context Habitat loss and fragmentation contribute significantly to
   pollinator decline and biodiversity loss globally. Conserving high
   quality habitats whilst restoring and connecting remnant habitat is
   critical to halt such declines.
   Objectives We quantified the connectivity of pollinator habitats for a
   generic focal species (GFS) which represented three groups of
   pollinators in an existing coastal nectar habitat network. Subsequently,
   in partnership with a conservation agency, we modelled an improved
   landscape that identified priority habitat patches to increase
   connectivity for pollinators.
   Methods We selected 4260 pollinator habitats along an 80 km section of
   coastland in Scotland using Phase 1 habitat data. A GFS represented
   three vulnerable European pollinator groups while graph theory and
   spatial metrics were used to identify optimal sites that could enhance
   habitat connectivity.
   Results Higher dispersing species experienced greater habitat
   connectivity in the improved landscape and habitat availability
   increased substantially in response to small increases in habitat. The
   improved landscape revealed important habitat patches in the existing
   landscape that should be protected and developed.
   Conclusions Our findings highlight that optimal landscapes can be
   designed through the integration of habitat data with spatial metrics
   for a GFS. By adopting this novel approach, conservation strategies can
   be targeted in an efficient manner to conserve at-risk species and their
   associated habitats. Integrating these design principles with policy and
   practice could enhance biodiversity across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{As insect pollinator populations continue to decline, it is essential to
   understand the impacts of anthropogenic activities, including forest
   management, on pollinator communities. Although multiple studies have
   shown that clearcutting is beneficial for bees, other less intense,
   selective silvicultural methods that result in disproportionate
   increases in edge habitat within stands are less well understood. We
   investigated bee community characteristics across microsites (center of
   cut, edge of cut, and closed-canopy forest) in three mixed-mesophytic
   forest stands subjected to group selection cuttings. Results revealed
   bee communities in the center of cuts and their edges to differ from
   those in forest microsites, and their diversity measures were higher
   than in forest microsites. Within-stand edge microsites did not differ
   from their cut centers in terms of their communities or their diversity.
   Finally, center of cut and edge microsites combined, and forest
   microsites, were characterized by different indicator species, thereby
   exemplifying differences between these two microsite groupings. These
   results suggest that group selection harvests support differing
   communities of bees across microsites and sustain a wide range of bee
   species, and that edges within these forest stands behaved more like
   extensions of canopy gap openings despite differences in forest

Abstract = {{Changes in land use and management intensification, especially in
   agriculture, have led to alarming declines in bee populations and the
   important ecological services they provide. Little is known how wild bee
   communities respond to these landscape changes at the phylogenetic
   level. Phylogenetic diversity was found to be correlated to functional
   trait diversity, since the former reflects a species evolutionary
   history while the later reflects the traits a species has accumulated.
   Here we use a mix of traditional measures of biodiversity and
   phylogenetic methods to examine differences in wild bee assemblages at
   six landscapes associated with grazing pressure and different management
   schemes. We found that grazing pressure strongly influences bee
   abundance, species richness and functional trait diversity while
   management intensity has little effect. Interestingly, wild bee
   phylogenetic diversity was not highly affected by land use, management,
   or grazing pressure as landscapes retained high levels of phylogenetic
   evenness. We additionally found evidence of phylogenetic signaling of
   examined traits. Our findings reveal that wild bee communities can
   maintain functional trait diversity even with low abundance and species
   richness. Furthermore, our study supports the notion that trait
   conservation through evolutionary lineages may only occur for some
   traits.}},

Abstract = {{In the Southern High Plains of the United States, beef cattle feed yards
   and row crop agriculture are predominant sources of agrochemical usage.
   Beef cattle feed yards use large quantities of veterinary
   pharmaceuticals to promote cattle growth and health, along with
   insecticides to control insect pests, whereas row crop-based agriculture
   relies on herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides to increase yields.
   Previous studies have documented the occurrence of agrochemicals beyond
   feed yard and row crop agriculture boundaries in uncultivated, marginal
   areas, raising concern that migratory pollinators and pollinators
   indigenous to the Southern High Plains frequenting these remaining
   habitat corridors may become exposed to toxic agrochemicals. Larvae of
   the painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) were used to investigate the
   potential toxicity of agrochemicals used on feed yards and in row crop
   agriculture among pollinators. Moxidectin, an antiparasiticide used on
   beef cattle feed yards, was determined to be extremely toxic to V.
   cardui larvae, with a lethal dose at which 50\% of larvae died of 2.1
   +/- 0.1 ng/g. Pyraclostrobin, clothianidin, and permethrin all delayed
   V. cardui development. However, moxidectin was the only chemical that
   produced significant toxic effects at environmentally relevant

Abstract = {{For bumble bees and other social organisms, colonies are the functional

   to 30\% of nests in a 2-h survey of each 3000 m(2) plot. We determined
   that 4-5 visits were sufficient to estimate the total number of nests at
   our site with reasonable precision, equating to one-third the effort
   previously assumed necessary to reliably estimate nest density.
   Mark-recapture approaches can be used to generate unbiased estimates of

Abstract = {{Urban green areas can provide ecosystem services such as biodiversity
   conservation, recreational and educational services, and local climate
   regulation including stormwater management. Implementation of
   sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) allows for development of
   designs targeting desired habitats or species groups. This study
   investigated short-term changes in a plant community following
   implementation of a SUDS designed to enhance nature quality of a 4.8 ha
   urban grassland in Lynge, Denmark. Dry basins allowed for water
   detention with construction entailing terrain modifications, seeding of
   target species and changes to water dynamics, resulting in four
   treatments differing in soil conditions and water regimes. Plant species
   richness and composition were documented before (2012) and two years
   after (2015 and 2016) implementation of the SUDS. A floral resources
   index was composed to assess the quality of the flora as foraging
   resource for four groups of bees. Plant species richness, alpha- and
   beta-diversity as well as frequency of target plant species
   significantly increased after SUDS construction, as did floral resources
   for bees. Increased alpha diversity was primarily seen in areas around
   dry basins, while the increase in overall beta-diversity related to a
   shift in plant community composition within dry basins. The SUDS
   construction also changed dominance relationships among plant groups as
   forb cover increased at the expense of grasses, and cover of seeded and
   post-construction naturally colonising species increased. Two years
   after construction this study confirms potentials of SUDS to enhance
   ecological value of urban grasslands, when targets for ecological
   enhancement are integrated in the SUDS design.}},

Abstract = {{Natural disturbances are critical for supporting biodiversity in many
   ecosystems, but subsequent management actions can influence the quality
   of habitat that follow these events. Post-disturbance salvage logging
   has negative consequences on certain components of forest biodiversity,
   but populations of some early seral-adapted organisms may be maintained
   in salvage-logged areas. We investigated the influence of an essential
   group of pollinators - wild bees - to recent post-wildfire salvage
   logging within managed mixed-conifer forest in the Pacific Northwest. We
   compared bee diversity (i.e., bee abundance, species richness, alpha
   diversity, and beta diversity) and habitat features (i.e., floral
   resources and available nesting substrates) in salvage-logged areas to
   unlogged sites, both of which experienced high-severity wildfire.
   Although we found no evidence for differences in bee abundance between
   salvage-logged and unlogged sites, interpolated estimates of species
   richness and both interpolated and extrapolated estimates of alpha
   diversity were greater in unlogged sites. Additionally, beta diversity
   was greater in unlogged sites when equal weight was given to rare
   species. Salvage logging did not select for specific functional groups
   of bees, as both logged and unlogged sites were dominated by generalist,
   social species that nest in the ground. However, habitat conditions for
   bees were influenced by salvage logging: flowering plant density was
   greater in salvage-logged sites during the latter half of the season,
   with fewer conifer snags and more woody debris than were available in
   unlogged sites. Our study indicates that salvage logging can support
   wild bee abundance, but that unlogged patches of severely burned forest
   supports slightly greater bee diversity within fire-prone mixed-conifer

Abstract = {{As garden plants in urbanized environments provide considerable diverse
   floral resources to pollinators, the availability of floral resources
   has changed as a consequence of increasing urbanization. Although
   pollinators often forage at different sites in response to
   spatiotemporal variations in floral resources, little is known about the
   differences in pollinator foraging between urban and nearby natural
   environments. We monitored the foraging patterns of bumblebees in open
   and forest habitats in two areas with and without urban gardens with
   respect to flowering phenology and the availability of floral resources
   in each habitat. Floral richness in the forest habitat decreased as the
   season progressed, with a peak in late spring to early summer, whereas
   floral resources in the open habitat increased late in the season. Thus,
   floral resources in the open habitat could compensate for seasonal
   declines in forest floral resources. In the urban area, which contained
   green gardens, floral richness in the open habitat was much greater than
   that in the forest habitat. This resulted in a relatively high density
   of bumblebees in the open habitat in the urban area compared with those
   in the natural area, which lacked green gardens. Visitation frequency of
   bumblebees to forest flowers decreased as the floral richness of the
   open habitat increased. These results suggest that although urban

   Artificial nesting sites (nesting aids) are being installed to

   Various nesting aids are commercially available, but their effectiveness
   has so far not been investigated empirically. We compared a low-budget
   commercial nesting aid with a customized version based on scientific
   evidence. Commercial models comprised bamboo and coniferous wood
   cavities with fixed short lengths and little variation in diameter,
   whereas customized models comprised hardwood, reed and bamboo cavities
   with varying lengths and diameters. Both models were exposed pairwise in
   private gardens over one season and nesting Hymenoptera species
   identified. The commercial nesting aids were less well occupied, hosted
   fewer brood cells and had lower species diversity. Hardwood showed the
   highest rate of occupancy but reed cavities hosted the highest species
   diversity due to diverse cavity diameter and length combinations.
   Cavities with diameters between four and eight mm were occupied most
   often. Regardless of material, cavities with smooth entrances were
   strongly preferred. Nesting aids designed in accordance with our

   taxa examined. For example, different species of short-tongued
   bumblebees showed little overlap in their most-preferred plant
   cultivars. Interestingly, very similar plant cultivars often attracted
   different insect communities; for example, 72\% of visitors to Aster
   novi belgii were honeybees or bumblebees, while the related Anthemis
   tinctoria, which also has daisy-like flowers, did not attract a single
   honeybee or bumblebee but was popular with solitary bees, hoverflies,
   and `other' pollinators. Some plant cultivars such as Eryngium planum
   and Myosotis arvensis were attractive to a broad range of insects, while
   others attracted only a few species but sometimes in large numbers, such
   as Veronicastrum virginicum and Helenium autumnale which were both
   visited predominantly by honey bees. It is clear that we do not yet
   fully understand what factors drive insect flower preferences.
   Recommendations are made as to which flower cultivars could be combined
   to provide forage for a diversity of pollinator groups over the season
   from early spring to autumn, though it must be born in mind that some
   plants are likely to perform differently when grown in different
   environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Governmental agri-environment schemes (AES) aim to improve pollinator
   abundance and diversity on farmland by sowing wildflower seed mixes.
   These often contain high proportions of Fabaceae, particularly Trifolium
   (clovers), which are attractive to some bumblebee species, but not to
   most of the \~{} 240 solitary bee species in the UK. Here we identify
   wildflowers that are attractive to a greater range of wild bee species.
   Forty-five wildflower species being farmed for commercial seed
   production on a single farm were surveyed for native bees. Bee walks
   were conducted through discrete wildflower areas from April until August
   in 2018. The results indicate that including a range of Apiaceae,
   Asteraceae, and Geraniaceae in seed mixes would cater for a wide
   diversity of bee species. A total of 14 wildflower species across nine
   families attracted 37 out of the 40 bee species recorded on the farm,
   and accounted for 99.7\% of all visitations. Only two of these 14
   species are included in current AES pollinator mixes. Unexpectedly, few
   visits were made by bumblebees to Trifolium spp. (0.5\%), despite their
   being considered an important food source for bumblebees, while
   Anthyllis vulneraria and Geranium pratense were highly attractive. For
   solitary bees, Crepis capillaris, Sinapsis arvensis, Convolvulus
   arvensis and Chaerophyllum temulum were amongst the best performing
   species, none of which are usually included in sown flower mixes. We
   suggest that the standard `pollinator' mixes used in AES might be
   updated to include some of these wildflower species, and trialled as
   seed mixes on farmland.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive biology of Cornus capitata was studied in detail from
   June 2014 to October 2015 in Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, western
   Himalaya, India and elucidated floral morphology, confirming autogamy,
   geitonogamy, and xenogamy. A new inflorescence ball formed each year
   with developing fruits that were initiated the previous year; thus
   reproduction is a continuous cycle. The total pollen production within a
   tree ranged between 4.0x10(7) and 9.3x10(7). Anthesis peaked between
   08:00 and 10:00. There was significant effect of micro-environmental
   condition on anthesis (F=243.8, p=3.01). A significant positive
   relationship between the number of lateral shoots and total
   inflorescence showed that the inflorescence production in C. capitate
   depends largely on the number of lateral shoots. Time and concentration
   of various solutions significantly affected pollen germination (time:
   F=5.39, p=0.002; concentration: F=1.40, p=0.234). Anthophora bees and
   thrips were observed as the main pollinators. There was a significant
   difference in seed set between natural and obligate self-pollination
   (t=11.84, p=1.99). Significant effect was also observed on fruit size
   (t=8.88, p=2.09) between open and shaded conditions. SEM micrographs of
   pollen grains showed that the shape of dehydrated pollen grains differed
   greatly due to variations in the rate of dehydration among pollen grains
   within the anther. Seed germination was observed only in quality seed
   derived from open pollination, supporting xenogamy in C. capitata.
   Findings of the present study will be of immense value in formulating
   effective conservation measures for the species in wild habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The bee genus Epeolus Latreille (Hymenoptera: Apidae) consists of 109
   species, which are known to be exclusively cleptoparasites of polyester
   (or cellophane) bees of the genus Colletes Latreille (Hymenoptera:

   represented on all continents except Antarctica and Australia. We
   present the most comprehensive phylogeny for Epeolus to date, based on
   combined molecular and morphological data. In total, 59 ingroup taxa
   (species of Epeolus) and 7 outgroup taxa (other Epeolini) were scored
   for 99 morphological characters, and sequence data were obtained for
   seven genes (one mitochondrial and six nuclear, 5399 bp in total).
   Epeolus was found to be monophyletic, with a crown age estimated to be
   25.0-13.4 Ma (95\% HPD) and its origins traced to the Nearctic region.
   Epeolus was found to contain six major clades, five of which were well
   supported. The evolutionary history of Epeolus is explored in the
   context of earth history events and the evolutionary history of its host
   genus Colletes, for which a molecular phylogeny was constructed based on
   the same seven genes. A comparison of Epeolus and Colletes phylogenies
   limited to taxa for which there is evidence of an association suggests
   there was some cospeciation. However, more cladogenetic events in
   Epeolus were linked to instances of dispersal/vicariance. It is not yet
   clear the extent to which allopatric speciation contributed to
   diversification in Colletes, but the genus' success in having colonized
   and diversified across much of the globe made it possible for Epeolus to
   do the same.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species that form mutualistic interactions can perturb resident
   communities by creating new interactions, or weakening the strength of
   existing interactions via competition. We hypothesized that introducing
   a super-generalist plant species to bee-plant networks would lead to (1)
   increases in the weighted and unweighted average degree, nestedness, and
   connectance and (2) decreases in the modularity. We constructed
   visitation networks of bees to five native plant species in experimental
   research plots, in the presence and absence of an invasive thistle and
   while varying thistle abundance and time/duration of introduction.
   Species introduction did not change the visitation rate of bees to
   co-occurring native plants, or the interaction structure between the
   native plant species and bee visitors; seed set of a focal native plant
   species was also unaffected. We found the number of bee species with
   which the introduced species interacted (generality) correlated with
   significant increases in unweighted and weighted average degree,
   nestedness, and connectance, but not modularity. When comparing the
   impact of the introduced species either early or late in the season, we
   found similar relationships between introduced species generality and
   weighted and unweighted average degree and connectance; there was a
   significant negative relationship between introduced species generality
   and modularity early in the season, and a significant positive
   relationship with nestedness late in the season, suggesting introduction
   timing within a season may affect some measures differently. Overall,
   the native community was robust to the introduction of the
   super-generalist; our experimental test of network theory predictions
   demonstrates an improving mechanistic understanding of how mutualistic
   networks respond to ecological perturbations.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Spraying of insecticides and fungicides during the flowering stage of
   oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) could be necessary to control insect
   pests (such as Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) and Dasineura
   brassicae (Winnertz)) and pathogens (Sclerotinia sclerotiorwn (Lib.) de
   Bary). In contrast to the conventional application technique, dropleg
   nozzles are kept below the flowering canopy to restrict the exposure of
   pollinators to active ingredients of insecticides. The Julius
   Kiihn-Institut (MU) tested the efficacy of different insecticides using
   the dropleg technique compared to the conventional technique, on insect
   pests in field trials conducted from 2015 to 2017 in the area of
   Braunschweig. The crop was treated at full flowering (BBCH 65) for three
   consecutive years. The tested insecticides were Biscaya (72 g a. i.
   ha(-1) thiacloprid), Mavrik (48 g a. i. ha(-1) tau-fluvalinate), and
   Mospilan SG (40 g a. i. ha(-1) acetamiprid). The adults and larvae of
   oilseed rape pests that drop to the ground were collected using water
   trays. The emergence of new generation beetles (Brassicogedies aeneus
   (Fabricius), C. obstrictus) was recorded from BBCH 78 onwards, using
   photoeclectors. At least twice during each season, oilseed rape plants
   were assessed for D. brassicae injury. The new dropleg application
   technique showed similar efficacy on pest insects compared to the
   conventional spraying technique. Nevertheless, the abundance of pests
   was not always sufficient to get clear results. Results especially on D.
   brassicae indicate that the dropleg technique had a comparable efficacy
   under moderate pest pressure conditions observed in our study. Further
   research under conditions with a higher abundance of C. obstrictus, as
   well as research on the effects of dropleg technique on parasitoids of
   oilseed rape pests, is needed. The population of B. aeneus population
   was reduced slightly less using dropleg instead of conventional
   application technique. In all the years, the yields did not differ
   significantly with regard to the conventional and dropleg application
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are generalist pollinators distributed through the

   interest. This method requires the identification of reliable reference
   genes to correctly estimate fluctuations in transcript levels. To

   study the life cycle of Eristalis tenax (Linnaeus, 1758) and Eristalinus
   aeneus (Scopoli, 1763) in order to improve the current rearing system
   employed at the University of Alicante. The results were analysed using
   the age-stage, two-sex life table method. As one of the main results,
   the mean duration of the life history of E. tenax and E. aeneus was
   46.06 and 65.12 days (d), respectively. The most critical step for both
   species was found at the beginning of the larval stage (first instar),
   when the highest mortality was recorded. Population parameters were also
   analysed and compared. The intrinsic rate of increase (r), the finite
   rate of increase (lambda), the net reproductive rate (R-0) and the mean
   generation time (T) were 0.09 (d(-1)), 1.09 (d(-1)), 42.11 offspring and

   offspring and 59.23 d, in the case of E. tenax. These results indicate
   that the current rearing system is more efficient for E. aeneus, which

Journal = {{ORIENTAL INSECTS}},
Abstract = {{Although the anthidiine bee Eoanthidium nasicum is little differentiated
   structurally, it was found that it is clustered in three units:
   Anatolia, the Levant and Iran. A Discriminant Function Analysis carried
   out on 11 morphometric parameters enabled the members of these
   geographically defined populations to be distinguished: 85.4\% of all
   males and 100.0\% of all females could be classified correctly, and
   together with some features of the colour pattern, it was possible to
   attribute 100\% of all specimens correctly. The abrupt change in the
   characters between the Anatolian and the Levantine populations without
   signs of interbreeding and in the absence of strong environmental
   barriers favouring disruptive selection suggests a secondary contact
   zone, where mixing is prevented by intrinsic isolating mechanisms. These
   two populations are given species status: E. nasiculum Pasteels, 1969
   stat. n. in Anatolia and E. nasicum in the Levant. On the other side,
   the divergence between the Anatolian and the Iranian populations seems
   to be driven by landscape features which have resulted in a less abrupt
   drifting apart. These two populations are thought still to belong to the
   same species and are given subspecies status (E. nasiculum nasiculum

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{The alarming rate of global pollinator decline has made habitat
   restoration for pollinators a conservation priority. At the same time,
   empirical and theoretical studies on plant-pollinator networks have
   demonstrated that plant species are not equally important for pollinator
   community persistence and restoration. However, the scarcity of
   comprehensive datasets on plant-pollinator networks in tropical
   ecosystems constrains their practical value for pollinator restoration.
   As closely-related species often share traits that determine ecological
   interactions, phylogenetic relationships could inform restoration
   programs in data-scarce regions. Here, we use quantitative bee-plant
   networks from Brazilian ecosystems to test if priority plant species for
   different restoration criteria (bee species richness and visitation
   rates) can be identified using interaction networks; if phylogenetic
   relationships alone can guide plant species selection; and how
   restoration criteria influence restored network properties and function.
   We found plant species that maximised the benefits of habitat
   restoration for bees (i.e., generalists and those with distinct
   flower-visitor species) were clustered in a small number of
   phylogenetically-diverse plant families, and that prioritising the
   recovery of bee visitation rates improved both stability and function of
   restored plant-pollinator networks. Our approach can help guide
   restoration of pollinator communities, even where information on local

Title = {{Diversified Floral Resource Plantings Support Bee Communities after
   Apple Bloom in Commercial Orchards}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Natural habitats, comprised of various flowering plant species, provide
   food and nesting resources for pollinator species and other beneficial
   arthropods. Loss of such habitats in agricultural regions and in other
   human-modified landscapes could be a factor in recent bee declines.
   Artificially established floral plantings may offset these losses. A
   multi-year, season-long field study was conducted to examine how
   wildflower plantings near commercial apple orchards influenced bee
   communities. We examined bee abundance, species richness, diversity, and
   species assemblages in both the floral plantings and adjoining apple
   orchards. We also examined bee community subsets, such as known tree
   fruit pollinators, rare pollinator species, and bees collected during
   apple bloom. During this study, a total of 138 species of bees were
   collected, which included 100 species in the floral plantings and 116
   species in the apple orchards. Abundance of rare bee species was not
   significantly different between apple orchards and the floral plantings.
   During apple bloom, the known tree fruit pollinators were more
   frequently captured in the orchards than the floral plantings. However,
   after apple bloom, the abundance of known tree fruit pollinating bees
   increased significantly in the floral plantings, indicating potential
   for floral plantings to provide additional food and nesting resources
   when apple flowers are not available.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{286}},
Number = {{1915}},

Abstract = {{Understanding diversity in flower-visitor assemblages helps us improve
   pollination of crops and support better biodiversity conservation
   outcomes. Much recent research has focused on drivers of crop-visitor
   diversity operating over spatial scales from fields to landscapes, such
   as pesticide and habitat management, while drivers operating over larger
   scales of continents and biogeographic realms are virtually unknown.
   Flower and visitor traits influence attraction of pollinators to
   flowers, and evolve in the context of associations that can be ancient
   or recent. Plants that have been adopted into agriculture have been
   moved widely around the world and thereby exposed to new flower
   visitors. Remarkably little is known of the consequence of these
   historical patterns for present-day crop-visiting bee diversity. We
   analyse data from 317 studies of 27 crops worldwide and find that crops
   are visited by fewer bee genera outside their region of origin and
   outside their family's region of origin. Thus, recent human history and
   the deeper evolutionary history of crops and bees appear to be important
   determinants of flower-visitor diversity at large scales that constrain
   the levels of visitor diversity that can be influenced by field- and
   landscape-scale interventions.}},

Title = {{The impact of yeast presence in nectar on bumble bee behavior and
   fitness}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The presence of yeasts in pollen and floral nectar is rather the norm
   than the exception. Due to the metabolic activities of yeasts, sugar and
   amino acid composition of nectar often drastically change and may
   negatively impact the nutritional value of nectar for pollinators and
   hence insect fitness. On the other hand, the presence of yeasts in
   floral nectar may also increase its nutritional value due to yeast's
   probiotic effect and the release of yeast's metabolites. In this study,
   we investigated whether the presence of defined flower- and
   insect-associated yeasts affected individual and colony fitness of the
   bumble bee pollinator Bombus terrestris. Specifically, we tested whether
   the presence of yeasts in nectar affected bumble bee foraging behavior
   and nectar consumption, individual growth and colony development, larval
   and queen mortality, and mating success. Quantitative analyses of sugar
   and amino acid profiles showed that nectar yeasts significantly affected
   the chemical composition of nectar. However, dual-choice experiments
   indicated that yeast inoculation did not significantly affect foraging
   behavior or consumption rates. Nest development, on the other hand, was
   significantly affected by the presence of yeasts, but effects largely
   depended on species identity, with Candida bombiphila, Metschnikowia
   gruessii, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa having the largest positive
   impact on colony growth. Interestingly, the effects at the colony level
   were more pronounced than at the individual level. In vitro growth tests
   further showed that yeasts have the potential to suppress the growth of
   the bumble bee gut pathogen Crithidia bombi. Overall, these results
   demonstrate that nectar-inhabiting yeasts can have diverse effects on
   bumble bee fitness and therefore may mediate plant-pollinator
   mutualisms.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{281-293}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact
   if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination
   interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit
   a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of
   trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary
   significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we
   show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have
   arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models.
   Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized
   linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models
   (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks,
   Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, naive Bayes, and
   k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species
   interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally
   responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models
   can successfully predict species interactions in plant-pollinator
   networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also
   demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible
   trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML
   models successfully predicted species interactions in a global
   plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible
   trait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network from Costa Rica,
   without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that
   flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression
   models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these
   results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally,
   our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial
   intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as
   image or pattern recognition.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollination is of major importance to wild plants and a wide
   variety of crops, yet agricultural intensification has led to pollinator
   declines and yield gaps in agroecosystems. Agri-environment schemes
   (AES) aim to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services by providing
   suitable habitats and key resources. Sown flower fields are often
   implemented as AES and are assumed to partly compensate for the lack of
   semi-natural habitats (SNH). But the combined effects of local
   management, size and landscape context on the effectiveness of flower
   fields remain unclear. We studied five pollinator groups (honey bees,
   bumble bees, other wild bees, hover flies and other flies) in three
   types of AES flower fields differing in age, size, and local management
   along a SNH gradient. We used calcareous grasslands as control sites.
   Further, we examined distance decay functions of flower visitation rates
   in adjacent oilseed rape (OSR) fields. Young flower fields in the first
   year after establishment characterised with high flower cover were very
   attractive for pollinators, however pollinators tended to remain in
   these fields when they were large (> 1.5 ha). High amounts of SNH in the
   surrounding landscape enhanced the value of small flower fields as
   starting points for pollinators and their subsequent movement into
   crops. Distance decay of pollinators was reduced in the presence of high
   amounts of SNH in the surrounding landscape. Based on our results, we
   recommend establishing smaller sown flower fields in landscapes with
   high amounts of SNH and larger flower fields in landscapes with low
   amounts of SNH. Importantly, sown flower fields were no substitute for
   perennial semi-natural habitats, underpinning the importance of SNH
   conservation in agricultural landscapes to maintain pollinators visiting
   flowers in crops.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{284}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators such as bumble bees are in decline as a result of many
   factors, including loss of habitat. Initiatives to improve and restore
   pollinator habitat are increasingly popular. However, to most
   effectively conserve pollinators, we need a better understanding of
   which habitats limit their survival and fitness at the landscape scale.
   Our study examined performance and fitness of the common eastern bumble
   bee, Bombus impatiens (Cresson), in four common landscapes for bees
   (natural, suburban, conventional agriculture, and organic agriculture).
   In the summers of 2016 and 2017, 64 bumble bee colonies per year were
   deployed across 16 sites (4 sites in each landscape type in each year)
   and their growth (weight and bee abundance), fitness (caste production),
   and survival were monitored weekly. Colonies in suburban sites in 2016,
   but not 2017, were lighter, produced fewer worker and drone cells, and
   experienced queen death more quickly than colonies in natural and
   agricultural landscapes. The performance and fitness of colonies in
   natural, organic agricultural, and conventional agricultural landscapes
   in both years were similar. Additionally, across all landscape types,
   the proportion of developed land and impervious surface were
   significantly negatively associated with colony performance in 2016.
   Thus, our results suggested that suburban landscapes are suboptimal for
   B. impatiens compared to natural and agricultural landscapes, and that
   this effect differs across years, potentially due to climactic
   differences. Future research is needed to identify the mechanisms
   responsible for reduced performance of bumble bee colonies in suburban
   landscapes, especially regarding floral resources and pesticide and
   pathogen stress. Such information could direct specific actions to
   improve suburban habitat for pollinators.}},

Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background The interaction among plants and their pollinators has been a
   major factor which enriched floral traits known as pollination syndromes
   and promoted the diversification of flowering plants. One of the
   bee-pollination syndromes in Faboideae with keel blossoms is the
   formation of a landing platform by wing and keel petals. However, the
   molecular mechanisms of elaborating a keel blossom remain unclear.
   Results By performing large scale mutagenesis, we isolated and
   characterized a mutant in Vigna radiata, love on wings (low), which
   shows developmental defects in petal asymmetry and vasculature, leading
   to a failure in landing platform formation. We cloned the locus through
   map-based cloning together with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. We
   found that LOW encoded a nucleus-localized Dof-like protein and was
   expressed in the flower provascular and vascular tissues. A single copy
   of LOW was detected in legumes, in contrast with other taxa where there
   seems to be at least 2 copies. Thirty one Dof proteins have been
   identified from the V. radiata's genome, which can be further divided
   into four Major Cluster of Orthologous Groups (MCOGs). We also showed
   that ectopic expression of LOW in Arabidopsis driven by its native
   promoter caused changes in petal vasculature pattern. Conclusions To
   summarize, our study isolated a legume Dof-like factor LOW from V.
   radiata, which affects vasculature development in this species and this
   change can, in turn, impact petal development and overall morphology of
   keel blossom.}},

Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Male solitary bees typically use emergence-nesting areas and/or flower
   patches of food plants, where receptive females are relatively numerous,
   as rendezvous sites. However, mate-seeking males have been also observed
   at food-deceptive orchid patches, where numerous encounters with
   foraging females can hardly be expected, owing to the lack of floral
   rewards. Here, we describe the male mate-seeking and mating behaviors of
   the Japanese long-horned bee Eucera nipponensis at habitats of the
   food-deceptive orchid Cymbidium goeringii. On the basis of the results,
   we report empty flower patches are not necessarily fruitless sites for
   mate-seeking males because naive female bees, which are highly likely to
   be recently emerged and unmated, can be attracted to non-rewarding
   orchids. We also suggest a possibility that a small number of the males
   could receive a ``sexual reward{''} (i.e. mating opportunities), owing
   to the food-deceptive orchid, in return for their pollination work. This
   occasional interaction could represent the initial stage in the
   evolution of sexually deceptive orchids from food-deceptive orchids.}},

Abstract = {{Premise Variation in pollinator effectiveness may contribute to pollen
   limitation in fragmented plant populations. In plants with multiovulate
   ovaries, the number of conspecific pollen grains per stigma often
   predicts seed set and is used to quantify pollinator effectiveness. In
   the Asteraceae, however, florets are uniovulate, which suggests that the
   total amount of pollen deposited per floret may not measure pollinator
   effectiveness. We examined two aspects of pollinator
   effectiveness-effective pollen deposition and effective pollen
   movement-for insects visiting Echinacea angustifolia, a composite that
   is pollen limited in small, isolated populations. Methods We filmed
   insect visits to Echinacea in two prairie restorations and used these
   videos to quantify behavior that might predict effectiveness. To
   quantify effective pollen deposition, we used the number of styles
   shriveled per visit. To quantify effective pollen movement, we conducted
   paternity analysis on a subset of offspring and measured the pollen
   movement distance between mates. Results Effective pollen deposition
   varied among taxa. Andrena helianthiformis, a Heliantheae oligolege, was
   the most effective taxon, shriveling more than twice the proportion of
   styles as all other visitors. Differences in visitor behavior on a
   flowering head did not explain variation in effective pollen deposition,
   nor did flowering phenology. On average, visitors moved pollen 16 m
   between plants, and this distance did not vary among taxa. Conclusions
   Andrena helianthiformis is an important pollinator of Echinacea.
   Variation in reproductive fitness of Echinacea in fragmented habitat may
   result, in part, from the abundance of this species.}},

Title = {{Male flowers of Aconitum compensate for toxic pollen with increased
   floral signals and rewards for pollinators}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Many plants require animal pollinators for successful reproduction;
   these plants provide pollinator resources in pollen and nectar (rewards)
   and attract pollinators by specific cues (signals). In a seeming
   contradiction, some plants produce toxins such as alkaloids in their
   pollen and nectar, protecting their resources from ineffective
   pollinators. We investigated signals and rewards in the toxic,
   protandrous bee-pollinated plant Aconitum napellus, hypothesizing that
   male-phase flower reproductive success is pollinator-limited, which
   should favour higher levels of signals (odours) and rewards (nectar and
   pollen) compared with female-phase flowers. Furthermore, we expected
   insect visitors to forage only for nectar, due to the toxicity of
   pollen. We demonstrated that male-phase flowers emitted more volatile
   molecules and produced higher volumes of nectar than female-phase
   flowers. Alkaloids in pollen functioned as chemical defences, and were
   more diverse and more concentrated compared to the alkaloids in nectar.
   Visitors actively collected little pollen for larval food but consumed
   more of the less-toxic nectar. Toxic pollen remaining on the bee bodies
   promoted pollen transfer efficiency, facilitating pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Little information is available about life history of paramo
   plants such as phenology and plant-animal interactions. Aims: We
   analysed phenological patterns of flowering and characterised the
   structure of a plant-pollinator network in a Venezuelan paramo in order
   to identify key species in this ecosystem. Methods: We counted the
   number of individuals with flowers of 76 native plant species and
   recorded their pollinators in 16 permanent plots between 3000 and 4200 m
   monthly for three years. We used this dataset to develop a
   plant-pollinator network, on which nine different metrics related to
   structural properties were calculated. Results: The flowering of most
   species concentrated during the rainy season (between May and November),
   however some species have continuous flowering. The guild of floral
   visitors included hummingbirds, flower piercers, bumblebees, Diptera and
   Lepidoptera. The plant - flower visitor interaction network did not
   exhibit nestedness, but showed a significant specialization index (H2)
   and high values of functional complementarity. Conclusions: Paramo
   plants have the capacity of maintaining a resident nectarivorus fauna
   (bumblebees and hummingbirds) because of continuous flower offer during
   the year. However, the plant - pollinator network identified could be
   very sensitive to the loss component species, owing to high levels of
   specialisation and functional complementarity.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen deposition and other sources of environmental
   eutrophication have increased substantially over the past century
   worldwide, notwithstanding the recent declining trends in Europe.
   Despite the recognized susceptibility of plants to eutrophication, few
   studies evaluated how impacts propagate to consumers, such as
   pollinators. Here we aim to test if soil eutrophication contributes to
   the temporal dynamics of pollinators and their larval resources. We used
   a temporally and spatially explicit historical dataset with information
   on species occurrences to test if soil eutrophication, and more
   specifically nitrogen deposition, contributes to the patterns of change
   of plant and pollinator richness in the Netherlands over an 80 yr
   period. We focus on bees and butterflies, two groups for which we have
   good knowledge of larval resources that allowed us to define groups of
   species with different nitrogen related diet preferences. For each group
   we estimated richness changes between different 20-yr periods at local,
   regional and national scale, using analytical methods developed for
   analyzing richness changes based on collection data. Our findings
   suggest that the impacts of soil eutrophication on plant communities
   propagate to higher trophic levels, but with a time-lag. Pollinators
   with nitrogen-related diet preferences were particularly affected, in
   turn potentially impairing the performance of pollinator-dependent
   plants. Pollinator declines continued even after their focal plants
   started to recover. In addition, our results suggest that current levels
   of nitrogen deposition still have a negative impact on most groups here
   analyzed, constraining richness recoveries and accentuating declines.
   Our results indicate that the global increase in nitrogen availability
   plays an important role in the ongoing pollinator decline. Consequently,
   species tolerances to soil nitrogen levels should be considered across
   all trophic levels in management plans that aim to halt biodiversity
   loss and enhance ecosystems services worldwide.}},

Title = {{Assessing species richness trends: Declines of bees and bumblebees in
   the Netherlands since 1945}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Abstract = {{Estimating and predicting temporal trends in species richness is of
   general importance, but notably difficult because detection
   probabilities of species are imperfect and many datasets were collected
   in an opportunistic manner. We need to improve our capabilities to
   assess richness trends using datasets collected in unstandardized
   procedures with potential collection bias. Two methods are proposed and
   applied to estimate richness change, which both incorporate models for
   sampling effects and detection probability: (a) nonlinear species
   accumulation curves with an error variance model and (b) Pradel
   capture-recapture models. The methods are used to assess nationwide
   temporal trends (1945-2018) in the species richness of wild bees in the
   Netherlands. Previously, a decelerating decline in wild bee species
   richness was inferred for part of this dataset. Among the species
   accumulation curves, those with nonconstant changes in species richness
   are preferred. However, when analyzing data subsets, constant changes
   became selected for non-Bombus bees (for samples in collections) and
   bumblebees (for spatial grid cells sampled in three periods). Smaller
   richness declines are predicted for non-Bombus bees than bumblebees.
   However, when relative losses are calculated from confidence intervals
   limits, they overlap and touch zero loss. Capture-recapture analysis
   applied to species encounter histories infers a constant colonization
   rate per year and constant local species survival for bumblebees and
   other bees. This approach predicts a 6\% reduction in non-Bombus species
   richness from 1945 to 2018 and a significant 19\% reduction for
   bumblebees. Statistical modeling to detect species richness time trends
   should be systematically complemented with model checking and
   simulations to interpret the results. Data inspection, assessing model
   selection bias, and comparisons of trends in data subsets were essential
   model checking strategies in this analysis. Opportunistic data will not
   satisfy the assumptions of most models and this should be kept in mind
   throughout.}},

Abstract = {{Rewardless orchid species are pollinated by deception and have reduced
   reproductive success. Those species that present self-compatibility
   followed by alternative mechanisms of autogamy may compensate for such
   episodic allogamy events. This is the case for rain-assisted
   self-pollination, a rare mechanism in Orchidaceae. In this study, we
   investigated the reproductive biology of two terrestrial species:
   Cyrtopodium hatschbachii and C. paludicolum. We studied their
   reproductive systems, examined pollinators and male and female
   successes, and ascertained if rain promotes self-pollination. Both
   species are allogamous but self-compatible. However, natural fruit set
   is low, not exceeding 1.40\% during 4 years of observation. This may
   result from the reduced frequency of pollinator visitation followed by a
   high pollinator specificity, because each species was pollinated by a
   single specialist bee. Although spontaneous selfing did not occur, we
   verified fruits formed by rain action. The evaporation of the water
   droplet that accumulates on stigma helps the pollinarium to slip back,
   promoting selfing. This occurred in approximately 10\% of C.
   hatschbachii fruits, but in C. paludicolum it was recorded only once
   during three observation years. This indicates that the phenomenon
   happens at random and may vary temporally. Nevertheless, rain may confer
   additional fruit set, especially under circumstances of pollinator
   limitation. Overall, we confirmed deception as a strategy for this
   understudied genus. In addition, we report a further two cases of
   rain-assisted self-pollination for Cyrtopodium, for species from the
   center of diversity of the genus, indicating that it may be more
   widespread than previously thought.}},

Title = {{Transient dehydration of pollen carried by hot bees impedes
   fertilization}},
Journal = {{ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS}},
Abstract = {{In the intense solar radiation of an alpine climate, small black bees
   often experience extremely high thoracic temperatures when they are
   foraging on flowers, but flies forage at lower temperatures. To explore
   the hypothesis that seed set could be depressed by transient dehydration
   of pollen at the high temperatures reached by hot bees foraging in
   sunshine, we compared the effectiveness of single visits by different
   pollinators to a bowl-shaped flower Potentilla lancinata in alpine
   meadows, SW China. The ratio of seed set to pollen transferred in
   individual flowers was monitored over 2 years, indicating that pollen
   deposited on stigmas by halictid bees produced lower seed set than
   pollen carried by flies. Scopal pollen applied to stigmas by hand gave
   good seed set, but in germination tests it burst more frequently than
   pollen from anthers, implying dehydration. Pollen grains freshly taken
   from the scopae of solitary bees foraging in sunshine were smaller than
   those taken from anthers or foraging bees in early-morning overcast
   conditions, implying dehydration. The effect was reversible: hand
   pollination showed that scopal pollen was no less effective than fly
   pollen after removal from the bee. Pollen carried by such bees foraging
   in intense sunlight in flowers became dehydrated, causing an osmotic
   mismatch between the pollen and the stigmas. Transient heat-induced
   dehydration of pollen represents a novel pathway by which climate
   warming may disrupt plant reproduction, and helps us understand why
   flies could be more effective pollinators than bees in cool,
   high-radiation arctic or high-altitude sites.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination syndromes have been widely used to predict effective
   pollinators of plant species and provide the mechanistic explanation of
   floral diversity. However, in recent years, the predictive applicability
   of pollination syndromes has been frequently questioned. The accuracy of
   the syndromes among the closely related plant species may vary
   temporally and spatially. This suggests the need for the standardized,
   comprehensive evaluation of factors influencing the matching of a
   pollination syndrome of a plant species to the predominant pollinator
   community. We studied the pollination biology of three
   geographically/phenologically isolated alpine gingers (Roscoea
   auriculata, Roscoea capitata, and Roscoea tumjensis) exhibiting the
   correlated suites of floral traits that suggest long-tongued insects as
   major pollinators, to test for the predictive power of the respective
   pollination syndrome. We also tested if geographical and temporal
   isolation affects interspecies breeding system and extent of pollinator
   generalization. We demonstrate that the three Roscoea species are
   self-compatible but lack autonomous selfing, and thus completely rely on
   pollinators for pollination success. Five years of observations
   demonstrate that only diurnal insect visitors foraged on the flowers of
   the three Roscoea species. Estimates of the pollinator importance
   (pollen deposition) of the observed floral visitors indicate that
   morphologically mismatched bumblebees contribute more than 90\% of
   pollination service in all the three Roscoea species, while long-tongued
   butterflies and moths function as nectar robbers. We found that
   geographical isolation and temporal variation in flowering period does
   not affect the breeding system and pollinator generalization in the
   three Roscoea species. The three geographically and phenologically
   isolated Himalayan Roscoea spp., with long-tongued insect pollination
   syndrome, exhibit generalized pollination system and primarily rely on
   the morphologically mismatched Bombus species for pollination success.
   While, for three Roscoea spp., our result suggests that pollination
   syndromes are a weak predictor of efficient contemporary pollinator
   community, it also substantiates the role of non-pollinator agents for
   the evolution of floral traits. The evolution of Bombus pollination in
   these alpine gingers suggests how the mismatch between plant and
   pollinator phenology can lead to the emergence of novel reproductive
   strategies among the congeners, which ultimately seems to play a key
   role for the speciation and diversification of the genus Roscoea in the
   Himalayas.}},

   estimate the contribution of each flower visitor to pollination, we used
   an index of potential pollen transport, namely the rate of visitation
   per female flower multiplied by the estimated number of pollen grains on
   the body surface. Among nine functional groups, the value of this index
   was greatest for bumblebees followed by small bees, whereas that for
   honeybees was low because of the relatively few Diospyros pollen grains

Abstract = {{Olfactory learning and floral scents are co-adaptive traits in the

   largely unknown. Here we evaluated the ability of Melipona eburnea to be
   conditioned to scent using the proboscis extension reflex (PER)
   protocol. Stingless bees did not show PER while harnessed but were able
   to be PER conditioned to scent when free-to-move in a mini-cage (fmPER).
   We evaluated the effect of: 1) unconditioned stimulus (US) reward, and
   2) previous scent-reward associations on olfactory learning performance.
   When using unscented-US, PER-responses were low on day 1, but using
   scented-US reward the olfactory PER-response increased on day 1. On day
   2 PER performance greatly increased in bees that previously had
   experienced the same odor and reward combination, while bees that
   experienced a different odor on day 2 showed poor olfactory learning.
   Bees showed higher olfactory PER conditioning to guava than to mango
   odor. The effect of the unconditioned stimulus reward was not a
   significant factor in the model on day 2. This indicates that olfactory
   learning performance can increase via either taste receptors or
   accumulated experience with the same odor. Our results have application

Abstract = {{Utricularia (Lentibulariaceae) is a genus comprising around 240 species
   of herbaceous, carnivorous plants. Utricularia is usually viewed as an
   insect-pollinated genus, with the exception of a few bird-pollinated
   species. The bladderworts Utricularia multifida and U. tenella are
   interesting species because they represent an early evolutionary
   Utricularia branch and have some unusual morphological characters in
   their traps and calyx. Thus, our aims were to (i) determine whether the
   nectar sugar concentrations and composition in U. multifida and U.
   tenella are similar to those of other Utricularia species from the
   subgenera Polypompholyx and Utricularia, (ii) compare the nectary
   structure of U. multifida and U. tenella with those of other Utricularia
   species, and (iii) determine whether U. multifida and U. tenella use
   some of their floral trichomes as an alternative food reward for
   pollinators. We used light microscopy, histochemistry, and scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy to address those aims. The
   concentration and composition of nectar sugars were analysed using
   high-performance liquid chromatography. In all of the examined species,
   the floral nectary consisted of a spur bearing glandular trichomes. The
   spur produced and stored the nectar. We detected hexose-dominated
   (fructose + glucose) nectar in U. multifida and U. tenella as well as in
   U. violacea. In both U. multifida and U. tenella, there were trichomes
   that blocked the entrance into the throat and spur. Because these
   trichomes were rich in chromoplasts and contained lipid droplets, they
   may form an additional visual attractant. Bearing in mind the
   phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus, we suggest that an early ancestor
   of Utricularia had a nectariferous spur flower with a lower lip that
   formed a wide landing platform for bee pollinators.}},

   context, particularly postdisturbance. We tested how wood-cavity-nesting
   bee species richness, nesting success, and nesting and floral resources
   varied across gradients of wildfire severity and time-since-burn. We
   sampled nesting bees via nesting boxes within four wildfires in
   southwest Montana, USA, using a space-for-time substitution
   chronosequence approach spanning 3-25 years postburn and including an
   unburned control. We found that bee nesting success and species richness
   declined with increasing time postburn, with a complete lack of
   successful bee nesting in unburned areas. Nesting and floral resources
   were highly variable across both burn severity and time-since-burn, yet
   generally did not have strong effects on nesting success. Our results
   together suggest that burned areas may provide important habitat for
   wood-cavity-nesting bees in this system. Given ongoing fire regime
   shifts as well as other threats facing wild bee communities, this work
   helps provide essential information necessary for the management and
   conservation of wood-cavity-nesting bees.}},

Abstract = {{While the ecological effects of pesticides have been well studied in
   honeybees, it is unclear to what extent other anthropogenic contaminants
   such as air pollution may also negatively affect bee cognition and
   behaviour. To answer this question, we assessed the impacts of acute
   exposure to four ecologically relevant concentrations of a common urban
   air pollutant-diesel generated air pollution on honeybee odour learning
   and memory using a conditioned proboscis extension response assay. The
   proportion of bees that successfully learnt odours following direct air
   pollution exposure was significantly lower in bees exposed to low,
   medium and high air pollutant concentrations, than in bees exposed to
   current ambient levels. Furthermore, short- and long-term odour memory
   was significantly impaired in bees exposed to low medium and high air
   pollutant concentrations than in bees exposed to current ambient levels.
   These results demonstrate a clear and direct cognitive cost of air
   pollution. Given learning and memory play significant roles in foraging,
   we suggest air pollution will have increasing negative impacts on the
   ecosystem services bees provide and may add to the current threats such
   as pesticides, mites and disease affecting colony fitness.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated pollinator assemblage diversity and richness in
   four forested ecosystems of southern Punjab, Pakistan, with different
   landscape types. Pirowal is situated in the plains of irrigated Punjab,
   Lal Suhanra is part of a sandy desert ecosystem, Ghazi Ghat is part of
   the Indus River delta, and Fort Munro is located in dry hilly mountains.
   A yearlong survey of pollinator populations was carried out in these
   four forested ecosystems from January to December of 2010. Fortnightly
   hand netting was performed for collecting flower-visiting insects
   whereas, pan traps of three colors (white, blue, and yellow) were
   deployed for collecting the data. A total of 8,812 individuals from two
   orders (Lepidoptera and Diptera) were observed, including 22 families
   and 154 species. Bees were the most abundant, with 4,502 individuals,
   and the most species-rich taxa, with 70 species in five families,
   followed by flies having 2,509 individuals and 51species in 10 families.
   Wasps were the least abundant with 1,801 individuals and 33 species in
   seven families. The assemblage structure of pollinator communities as
   visualized through rank abundance curves showed that there were many
   species with low abundance and only a few species with a much higher
   abundance. The most abundant species among the bees, in order, were
   Nomia sp.3, Megachile bicolor, and Colletes sp.3; among flies, Syrphus

Abstract = {{This study examined invertebrate floral visitor responses to floral

   surrounded by concentric rings of smaller habitat patches (1-m
   diameter), separated from one another by 1, 8, 13, and 21 m,
   respectively, and including four flowering species. We observed plant
   and visitor interactions via structured 10-minute flower visitation
   observations over a 3-month period. Key findings included: (1) each
   plant species interacted with a variety of flower visitors, but flower
   visitor groups differed only marginally among the plant species; (2)
   floral patches outside the central garden exhibited reduced quantities
   of floral structures; and (3) number of floral structures per patch, but
   not isolation of floral patches within the habitat, affected the number
   of visitors and visitor taxa richness. For practitioners and land
   managers looking to restore pollination systems in arid ecosystems with

Abstract = {{Native pollinators are increasingly needed on conventional farms yet
   rarely fostered via management. One solution is habitat restoration in
   marginal areas, but colonization may be constrained if resident
   pollinator richness is low or if restored areas fail to provide
   sufficient floral or nesting resources. We quantified restoration
   outcomes for native bees, and associated resources, on three
   conventional farms with forb-grass prairie plantings on marginal areas
   of varying sizes, in a heavily farmed region of central North America.
   We tested bee abundance and richness in restored prairie versus the
   dominant habitats of the region-crops, forest remnants, and edges of
   fields and roads. Restored prairie supported 2x more species (95 of 119
   total species) and 3x more bees (72\% of captured individuals) compared
   to the other cover types. All richness and abundance differences among
   habitat types were associated with higher floral resources in restored
   prairie. Thirty percent of the bee species were unique to prairie,
   consistent with long-distance dispersal but begging the question of
   origin given the absence of prairie regionally. Our results suggest that
   road and field edges may be the source, as these areas had more floral
   and nesting resources than forest or crop fields combined and supported
   55\% of all species despite covering only approximately 5\% of the
   sampled farms. Habitat scarcity is not the only constraint on native

Volume = {{106}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Premise Most plants interact with mycorrhizal fungi and animal
   pollinators simultaneously. Yet, whether mycorrhizae affect traits
   important to pollination remains poorly understood and may depend on the
   match between host and fungal genotypes. Here, we examined how ericoid
   mycorrhizal fungi affected flowering phenology, floral traits, and
   reproductive success, among eight genotypes of highbush blueberry,
   Vaccinium corymbosum (Ericaceae). We asked three overarching questions:
   (1) Do genotypes differ in response to inoculation? (2) How does
   inoculation affect floral and flowering traits? (3) Are inoculated
   plants more attractive to pollinators and less pollen limited than
   non-inoculated plants of the same genotype? Methods To examine these
   questions, we experimentally inoculated plants with ericoid mycorrhizal
   fungi, grew the plants in the field, and measured flowering and floral
   traits over 2 years. In year 2, we conducted a hand-pollination
   experiment to test whether plants differed in pollen limitation. Results
   Inoculated plants had significantly higher levels of colonization for
   some genotypes, and there were significant floral trait changes in
   inoculated plants for some genotypes as well. On average, inoculated
   plants produced significantly larger floral displays, more fruits per
   inflorescence, and heavier fruits with lower sugar content, than
   non-inoculated, control plants. Hand pollination enhanced the production
   of fruits, and fruit mass, for non-inoculated plants but not for those
   that were inoculated. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that
   inoculation with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi enhanced flowering and
   altered investment in reproduction in genotype-specific ways. These
   findings underscore the importance of examining belowground symbionts
   and genotype-specific responses in their hosts to fully understand the

Abstract = {{Aim Bees play an important role in natural ecosystems and the world's
   food supply. In the past decades, bee abundance and diversity have
   declined globally. This has resulted in decreased pollination services
   for natural ecosystems and the agricultural sector at the field scale.
   One of the causes of the decline in bee abundance and diversity is the
   use of pesticides. Linking pesticide use, land use and bee presence
   could provide crucial insights into areas, and pesticides that pose a
   significant threat to the abundance and diversity of bees. Obtaining
   actual figures of farmer pesticide use is rarely possible. Therefore, we
   designed a method to study the effects of potential pesticide use on the
   survival and distribution of honeybees and bumblebees. Location The
   Netherlands. Methods A pesticide risk model was implemented
   incorporating a hazard quotient as the risk assessment. The number of
   allowed pesticide active ingredients per crop that could pose a risk to
   honeybees and bumblebees was linked to the Dutch crop parcel locations
   for 2015 and 2016. The potential pesticide risk maps were analysed using
   honeybee colony survival and bumblebee presence data. Results
   Non-significant negative effects of potential pesticide risk on honeybee
   colony survival and bumblebee presence were found. A significant
   negative effect of greenhouses was identified for both honeybees and
   bumblebees. The most important factors in the models predicting honeybee
   colony survival and bumblebee presence were urban land areas and natural
   grasslands, respectively, both showing a positive effect. Main
   conclusions Here, the first attempt to estimate and map pesticide risk
   to bees in the Netherlands in a country-wide manner is presented. The
   results could provide crucial high-resolution insights for bee
   conservation action and facilitate the increase of pollination services

Abstract = {{Honey bees are important insect pollinators used heavily in agriculture
   and can be found in diverse environments. Bees may encounter toxicants
   such as cadmium and selenate by foraging on plants growing in
   contaminated areas, which can result in negative health effects. Honey
   bees are known to have a simple and consistent microbiome that conveys
   many benefits to the host, and toxicant exposure may impact this
   symbiotic microbial community. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assay
   the effects that sublethal cadmium and selenate treatments had over 7
   days and found that both treatments significantly but subtly altered the
   composition of the bee microbiome. Next, we exposed bees to cadmium and
   selenate and then used untargeted liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics to show that chemical exposure changed
   the bees' metabolite profiles and that compounds which may be involved
   in detoxification, proteolysis, and lipolysis were more abundant in
   treatments. Finally, we exposed several strains of bee-associated
   bacteria in liquid culture and found that each strain removed cadmium
   from its medium but that only Lactobacillus Firm-5 microbes assimilated
   selenate, indicating the possibility that these microbes may reduce the
   metal and metalloid burden on their host. Overall, our report shows that
   metal and metalloid exposure can affect the honey bee microbiome and
   metabolome and that strains of bee-associated bacteria can bioaccumulate
   these toxicants.
   IMPORTANCE Bees are important insect pollinators that may encounter
   environmental pollution when foraging upon plants grown in contaminated
   areas. Despite the pervasiveness of pollution, little is known about the
   effects of these toxicants on honey bee metabolism and their symbiotic
   microbiomes. Here, we investigated the impact of selenate and cadmium
   exposure on the gut microbiome and metabolome of honey bees. We found
   that exposure to these chemicals subtly altered the overall composition
   of the bees' microbiome and metabolome and that exposure to toxicants
   may negatively impact both host and microbe. As the microbiome of
   animals can reduce mortality upon metal or metalloid challenge, we grew
   bee-associated bacteria in media spiked with selenate or cadmium. We
   show that some bacteria can remove these toxicants from their media in
   vitro and suggest that bacteria may reduce metal burden in their hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Chemosensory communication between flowers and pollinators is a
   fundamental component of terrestrial biodiversity, given the importance
   of olfaction to foraging animals. In this respect, exploring chemically
   mediated interspecific interactions in natural assemblies may provide
   novel insights into the ecofunctional significance of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) for plant-insect co-evolution. However, multispecies
   datasets of associations between plant semiochemicals and arthropods are
   still very rare and tend to lack community context. Here, we present the
   first insect-floral VOC meta-network using plant-pollinator visitation
   data and the plants' floral scent blends, collected in a Mediterranean
   scrubland. We assembled the insect-VOC meta-network by substituting each
   plant species in the plant-pollinator network with the blend of VOCs it
   emits. Furthermore, we identified the modules of the network that is the
   most densely connected insect-VOC groups. After describing the role of
   the species in the network, we focused on the bees of the community, and
   by building phylogenetically informed GLS models, we found the species
   traits predicting the degree of chemical specialization. Modularity
   analysis of the meta-network revealed tight associations between several
   classes of VOCs and pollinator groups. Linkage patterns suggest positive
   associations between (a) Megachilidae bees and sesquiterpenes, (b)
   Apidae and Andrenidae bees and benzenoids/phenylpropanoids, and (c)
   wasps, C6 green-leaf volatiles and specific terpenoids. Benzenoids were
   found to be the least influential and most specialized chemical class in
   the community, whereas sesquiterpenes represented the most influential
   one. Furthermore, the degree of chemical generalization of the bees in
   the meta-network was significantly associated with their ecological
   generalization, body mass and phenology, whereas their contribution to
   the network's structure was related to their level of sociality.
   Synthesis. Our findings help to disclose the ecofunctional significance
   of the floral volatile landscape and contribute novel testable
   hypotheses on the behavioural trends and chemical niches of pollinators
   in a natural community. The insect-volatilome meta-network is thus shown
   to be advantageous for detecting and visualizing patterns of chemically
   mediated interspecific interactions. Given the ubiquity of chemosensory
   biocommunication, our approach can be applied for investigating various
   types of ecological interactions in community contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The exposure of bees to agrochemicals during foraging and feeding has

   agrochemicals can affect behavior and the microbiota. Gut microbiota is
   associated with insect nutritional health, immunocompetence, and is
   essential for neutralizing the damage caused by pathogens and
   xenobiotics. Research on the effect of the bioinsecticides and
   fertilizers on the microbiota of bees remains neglected. In this study,
   we assessed the sublethal effect of both bioinsecticide spinosad and the
   fertilizer copper sulfate (CuSO4) on the behavior and gut microbiota in
   forager adults of the stingless bee Partamona helleri (Friese), which is
   an important pollinator in the Neotropical region. Behavioral assays and
   gut microbiota profiles were assessed on bees orally exposed to
   estimated LC5 values for spinosad and CuSO4. The microbiota were
   characterized through 16S rRNA gene target sequencing. Acute and oral
   sublethal exposure to spinosad and CuSO4 did not affect the overall
   activity, flight take-off, and food consumption. However, CuSO4
   decreased bee respiration rate and copper accumulated in exposed bees.
   Exposure to spinosad increased the proportional abundance of the genus
   Gilliamella, but CuSO4 did not alter the composition of the gut

Title = {{Historical changes in bumble bee body size and range shift of declining
   species}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION}},
Abstract = {{Bumble bees are declining worldwide, their vital ecosystem services are
   diminishing and underlying mechanisms are species specific and
   multifaceted. This has sparked an increase in long-term assessments of
   historical collections that provide valuable information about
   population trends and shifts in distributions. However, museums
   specimens also contain important ecological information, including
   rarely measured morphological traits. Trait-based assessments of museums
   specimens provide additional information on underlying mechanisms of
   population trends, by tracking changes over time. Here, we used museum
   specimens of four Bombus species, spanning a timeframe of 125 years to:
   (i) compare body size of declining and increasing species, (ii) assess
   intra-specific trends over the last century, and (iii) investigate
   shifts in geographical distribution over time. We found that declining
   Bombus species were larger than increasing ones. All four species were
   smaller in current time than a century ago. Intra-specific size declines
   were more pronounced for larger-bodied species. With our sampling,
   declining and increasing species showed an upward shift in elevation,
   and declining species showed an additional geographic shift in recent

Abstract = {{Longleaf pine savannas are highly threatened, fire-maintained ecosystems
   unique to the southeastern United States. Fire suppression and
   conversion to agriculture have strongly affected this ecosystem,
   altering overstory canopies, understory plant communities, and animal
   populations. Tree thinning to reinstate open canopies can benefit
   understory plant diversity, but effects on animal communities are less
   well understood. Moreover, agricultural land-use legacies can have
   long-lasting impacts on plant communities, but their effects on animal
   communities either alone or through interactions with restoration are
   unclear. Resolving these impacts is important due to the conservation
   potential of fire-suppressed and post-agricultural longleaf savannas. We
   evaluated how historical agricultural land use and canopy thinning
   affect the diversity and abundance of wild bees in longleaf pine
   savannas. We employed a replicated, large-scale factorial block
   experiment in South Carolina, where canopy thinning was applied to
   longleaf pine savannas that were either post-agricultural or remnant (no
   agricultural history). Bees were sampled using elevated bee bowls. In
   the second growing season after restoration, thinned plots supported a
   greater bee abundance and bee community richness. Additionally, restored
   plots had altered wild bee community composition when compared to
   unthinned plots, indicating that reduction of canopy cover by the
   thinning treatment best predicted wild bee diversity and composition.
   Conversely, we found little evidence for differences between sites with
   or without historical agricultural land use. Some abundant Lasioglossum
   species were the most sensitive to habitat changes. Our results
   highlight how restoration practices that reduce canopy cover in
   fire-suppressed savannas can have rapid benefits for wild bee
   communities.}},

   visitation and seed set in an early spring grassland plant?}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge on how the timing of flowering is related to plant fitness and
   species interactions is crucial to understand consequences of
   phenological shifts as they occur under climate change. Early flowering
   plants may face advantages of low competition for pollinators and
   disadvantages of low pollinator abundances and unfavourable weather
   conditions. However, it is unknown how this trade-off changes over the
   season and how the timing affects reproductive success. On eight
   grasslands we recorded intra-seasonal changes in pollinators,
   co-flowering plants, weather conditions, flower visitation rates, floral
   longevity and seed set of Pulsatilla vulgaris. Although bee abundances
   and the number of pollinator-suitable hours were low at the beginning of
   the season, early flowers of P. vulgaris received higher flower
   visitation rates and estimated total number of bee visits than later
   flowers, which was positively related to seed set. Flower visitation
   rates decreased over time and with increasing number of co-flowering
   plants, which competed with P. vulgaris for pollinators. Low
   interspecific competition for pollinators seems to be a major driver for
   early flowering dates. Thus, non-synchronous temporal shifts of
   co-flowering plants as they may occur under climate warming can be
   expected to strongly affect plant-pollinator interactions and the
   fitness of the involved plants.}},

Title = {{Deceptive pollination of Calanthe by skippers that commonly act as
   nectar thieves}},
Journal = {{ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Flowers have developed different strategies to attract pollinators
   through visual or olfactory signals. Most flowers offer pollinators a
   reward (e.g. nectar and pollen) for the pollination service. However,
   one-third of Orchidaceae have been shown not to provide a reward.
   Calanthe are terrestrial orchids distributed throughout China, Nepal,
   Japan and tropical Asia. Despite its high diversity, the pollination
   biology of Calanthe remains largely unknown, even though it is an
   important aspect of plant conservation. In the study, through field
   surveying, there were three Hesperiidae butterflies pollinating two
   species of Calanthe and the pollination behavior differed between the
   two species of Calanthe, which might lead to different fruit setting
   rates. There was no nectar in the flowers of the two species, indicating
   deceptive pollination. Using a glass cylinder experiment, it was deduced
   that the two species of Calanthe were most likely to attract pollinators
   by generalized food deception. Interestingly, Hesperiidae butterflies
   were traditionally thought to be nectar thieves and generally do not
   transmit pollinia. However, our findings showed that, in this case, the
   thieves were deceived by the plants and pollinated them for free.}},

Title = {{Interacting effects of landscape and management on plant-solitary bee
   networks in olive orchards}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Understanding how multi-scale environmental heterogeneity shapes the
   structure and functions of animal and plant communities is pivotal in
   agroecology. Our capacity to ensure the provision of ecosystem services
   (ES), the sustainability of agroecosystems and the efficiency of
   agri-environmental schemes (AES) relies on this knowledge. There is
   growing interest in how biodiversity and ES are affected by the
   interplay between landscape characteristics and agricultural management
   (e.g., intermediate landscape complexity hypothesis; ILCH). However,
   studies have typically focused on classical measures of community
   structure (e.g., species abundance, richness and biodiversity), tending
   to neglect the effects on the structure and stability of ecological
   networks and the increased risk of biotic homogenization (i.e., loss of
   beta-diversity). In this work, we use bee trap nests to sample
   pollen-solitary bee mutualistic networks in 9 pairs of olive groves
   under different management regimes (conventional vs. organic) in a
   landscape complexity gradient in southern Spain. We analyse the
   mutualistic networks at farm level to test the ILCH and study how
   agricultural practices and landscape complexity interact to affect the
   properties of these networks. We also explore the effects on spatial
   biotic homogenization by performing multivariate analyses of the
   composition and abundance of bee-plant communities and their pairwise
   interactions. The results show that solitary bee-plant networks have
   greater complexity and stability on organic olive farms embedded in
   relatively heterogeneous landscapes. Differences from conventional
   management were higher in landscapes of intermediate complexity but were
   non-significant on olive farms located in simpler landscapes.
   beta-diversity of bees, plants and their pairwise interactions was also
   greater on organic olive farms. In conclusion, human-induced
   environmental heterogeneity interacts at different scales to shape
   plant-solitary bee networks in olive groves, which may have important
   implications for ES provision and the effectiveness of
   agri-environmental measures. A free Plain Language Summary can be found

Abstract = {{The bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, is an important pollinator
   commercially used on a global scale. The exported subspecies B. t.
   terrestris has colonised diverse environments, in some cases displacing
   wild pollinators to the verge of local extinction. In this sense, the
   native Iberian subspecies B. t. lusitanicus may be threatened by the
   subspecies B. t. terrestris, naturally distributed from the Pyrenees to
   Central Europe but also observed in southern Spain due to escapes from
   commercial nests. Mitochondrial genomes have a low recombination rate
   and a small effective population size owing to their maternal
   inheritance, thus providing an accurate approach to study hybridisation
   events between populations. Therefore, we present the sequences of the
   mitogenomes of both subspecies as a molecular framework to select
   suitable markers to detect possible introgression events between them.
   We used metagenomics to obtain approximately 17 kbp of the mitogenome
   from both subspecies. Their mitogenomes differed in 358 bp (excluding
   the AT-rich region). Four mitogenomic fragments were selected to be
   tested as subspecific diagnostic markers. A RFLP detected in the gene
   nad2 (NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2) has proven to be an efficient, quick
   and cost-effective tool to assess the dispersion of the non-endemic
   subspecies into Iberian native populations. Subspecific haplotypes were
   observed in both morphological subspecies, suggesting introgression
   events in the northern natural contact area and in the new
   human-mediated contact area in the south of the Iberian Peninsula.}},

Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{Nectar is considered to be a primary food reward for most pollinators.
   It mostly contains sugars, but also has amino acids. The significance of
   the concentration and composition of amino acids in nectar is often less
   understood than that of its volume, sugar concentration and composition.
   However, there is a trend towards a broader approach in ecological
   research, which helps to understand nectar properties in an ecological
   context. The genus Fritillaria, exhibiting great diversity in flower
   morphology, nectar composition, and dominant pollinators, allows for the
   possibility to study some of the above. We studied the concentration and
   composition of amino acids in the nectar of 38 Fritillaria species
   attracting different groups of pollen vectors (bees, flies, passerines,
   and hummingbirds). The flowers of fritillaries produced nectar with a
   varying composition and concentration of amino acids. These differences
   were mostly associated with the pollinator type. The nectar of passerine
   bird-pollinated species was rich in amino acids, whereas humming
   bird-pollinated produced low amino acid nectar. Contrary to previous
   reports nectar of the insect-pollinated species did not contain a higher
   amount of proline. Two non-protein amino acids, sarcosine and norvaline,
   were detected in the floral nectar for the first time.}},

Journal = {{INSECT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Parasitism can result in dramatic changes in host phenotype, which are
   themselves underpinned by genes and their expression. Understanding how
   hosts respond at the molecular level to parasites can therefore reveal
   the molecular architecture of an altered host phenotype. The
   entomoparasitic nematode Sphaerularia bombi is a parasite of bumblebee
   (Bombus) hosts where it induces complex behavioural changes and host
   castration. To examine this interaction at the molecular level, we
   performed genome-wide transcriptional profiling using RNA-Sequencing
   (RNA-Seq) of S. bombi-infected Bombus terrestris queens at two critical
   time-points: during and just after overwintering diapause. We found that
   infection by S. bombi affects the transcription of genes underlying host
   biological processes associated with energy usage, translation, and
   circadian rhythm. We also found that the parasite affects the expression
   of immune genes, including members of the Toll signalling pathway
   providing evidence for a novel interaction between the parasite and the
   host immune response. Taken together, our results identify host
   biological processes and genes affected by an entomoparasitic nematode

Abstract = {{Plant phytochemicals can act as natural ``medicines{''} for animals
   against parasites {[}1-3]. Some nectar metabolites, for example, reduce
   parasite infections in bees {[}4-7]. Declining plant diversity through
   anthropogenic landscape change {[}8-11] could reduce the availability of
   medicinal nectar plants for pollinators, exacerbating their decline
   {[}12]. Existing studies are, however, limited by (1) a lack of
   mechanistic insights into how phytochemicals affect pollinator diseases
   and (2) the restriction to few, commercially available chemicals,
   thereby potentially neglecting plants with the biggest antiparasitic
   effects. To rapidly identify plants with the greatest potential as
   natural bee medicines, we developed a bioactivity-directed fractionation
   assay for nectar metabolites. We evaluated 17 important nectar plants
   against the bumblebee pathogen Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae)
   {[}13-17]. The most bioactive species was heather (Calluna vulgaris),
   the second most productive UK nectar plant {[}10]. We identified
   4-(3oxobut-1-enylidene)-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohex-2-en1-one (callunene)
   from heather nectar as a potent inhibitor of C. bombi. Wild bumblebees
   (Bombus terrestris) foraging on heather ingest callunene at
   concentrations causing complete C. bombi inhibition. Feeding on
   callunene was prophylactic against infections. We show that C. bombi
   establishes infections by flagellar anchoring to the ileum epithelium.
   Short-term callunene exposure induced flagellum loss in C. bombi
   choanomastigotes, resulting in a loss of infectivity. We conclude that
   plant secondary metabolites can disrupt parasite flagellum attachment,
   revealing a mechanism behind their prophylactic effects. The decline of
   heathlands {[}18-21] reduces the availability of natural bee

Abstract = {{Cowpea is an important grain legume crop in Africa. Cowpea flowers are
   capable of self-fertilization, which might be the most frequent type of
   reproduction. Nevertheless, the rate of cross-pollination could vary
   between 1\% and 10\%, depending on the populations of bumblebees or
   domestic bees that are present, the climate and the cultivar. The aim of
   this study was to identify and assess the efficiency rate of the
   pollinators of the wild cowpea, Vigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata
   var. spontanea, the progenitor of the domesticated cowpea Vigna
   unguiculata subsp. unguiculata. Pollination study was conducted by
   observing patches of flowers (average 10-20/m(2)) from dawn to midday,
   approximately 05:00-12:30 hr for three years. All insects visiting the
   flowers were noted and identified to species level, where possible, and
   their foraging behaviour was monitored. Pollen grain deposit and pod set
   were estimated using single bee visits on plants with strictly
   outcrossing flowers. Major flower visitors were large bees of the family
   Megachilidae and the genus Xylocopa (Apidae, Xylocopinae). Xylocopa
   caffra (Linnaeus) was the most abundant bee species, accounting for 59\%
   of total bees observed and 58\% of total flower visited. Pod set was
   higher in visits by megachilid bees compared to Xylocopa bees. Within
   Xylocopa, there is a good correlation between size and efficiency (r =
   .95, p = .0477), the larger insects being more efficient. Honeybees,
   small bees (Ceratina and Nomia species) and Lepidopterans also visited
   flowers but without any effect on pollination. Cowpea pollination system
   is specialized, and pollinators are restricted to Megachilidae and
   Xylocopa species. Variation in pollen load deposit and pod set reveals
   that pollination success depends on the insect species involved and
   their size. Megachilids are the most efficient pollinators, especially
   since they are able to promote outcrossing more efficiently than
   Xylocopa species.}},

Abstract = {{Golf courses are among the largest, most ubiquitous highly maintained
   urban green spaces in the U.S. Although their primary function is
   recreation, a large portion of golf course land is not actively in use,
   which presents opportunities to create more ecologically functional
   areas. Golf courses around the world are converting these out-of-play
   areas to alternative habitats, but few do so using evidence that
   maximizes their benefit. Previous studies have investigated effects of
   conservation plantings on golf courses, but none have isolated the
   biological control services of flying natural enemies and few
   investigated effects on native bees. In this study, we ask if converting
   out-of-play maintained turfgrass areas into wildflower habitats
   increases bee and insect natural enemy abundance and diversity and their
   associated ecosystem services. We created wildflower habitats at two
   levels of species richness and compared their effects on insects within
   and around them to turfgrass plots. To quantify effects on biological
   control, we deployed sentinel prey Spodoptera frugiperda larvae,
   excluding ground-dwelling predators. As predicted, we found that
   converting turfgrasses to flowering habitats increased bees and natural
   enemies on golf courses. However, high wildflower species richness was
   an important factor in promoting native bees and natural enemies. We
   found that wildflower habitats, particularly those with highest floral
   richness, increased biological control rates in adjacent turfgrass areas
   by up to 50\% compared to turfgrass controls. Our results indicate that
   purposefully designed conservation plantings on golf courses can help
   support insect pollinators while also augmenting biological control of
   turfgrass pests.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees (Apinae: Corbiculata: Meliponini) are biologically and
   culturally important pollinators within the tropical and subtropical
   areas of the world. However, limited information is available for the
   majority of the species. Biological and systematic data are presented
   for a new species of Trigonisca Moure, from the arid region of La
   Guajira, Colombia. The genus is part of the distinctive Trigonisca genus
   group, noteworthy for its position as the earliest diverging extant
   lineage of neotropical stingless bees. We briefly diagnose the genus
   group and provide a key to the genera and subgenera of the Trigonisca
   genus group, along with the description of Exochotrigona Engel, new
   subgenus. We also outline the species occurring in Colombia and present
   a description for Trigonisca (Trigonisca) mepecheu Engel and Gonzalez,
   new species, including accounts of all three castes. A single, poorly
   preserved egg is noteworthy because of its extremely small size. Its
   chorion is extensively covered by a surface pattern of elevated
   geometric figures, as seems to be characteristic of the Meliponini. The
   robust mature larva, though remarkably small, exhibits extensive
   spiculation of dorsal body surfaces and most body segments with small,
   paired dorsolateral tubercles. In addition, the labral apex exhibits an
   apical patch of recently discovered multipronged spicules intermixed
   with various sensory sensilla. These morphological features of immature
   stages, where known, are similar to those previously reported for other
   Meliponini. We document the internal architecture of nests of T.
   mepecheu, which we found in trunks of Stenocereus griseus (Haw.) Buxb.
   (Cactaceae) and more commonly in Libidibia coriaria (Jacq.) Schltdl.
   (Fabaceae), along with nests of the only other stingless bee from La
   Guajira, Melipona favosa (Fabricius). Nests were also found in the sides
   of manufactured structures. The indigenous Wayuu harvest stingless-bee
   honey and have specific names in Wayuunaiki for the two species
   occurring in the region, although there is apparently an oral tradition
   in which the honey of T. mepecheu causes blindness. Trigonisca
   (Trigonisca) ameliae Penney from Colombian copal is a new junior synonym
   of T. (T.) schulthessi (Friese).}},

Abstract = {{Floral herbivory (florivory) can directly and indirectly affect plant
   reproduction through the loss of ovules or seeds and by reducing the
   visitation by pollinators through the reduction in flower
   attractiveness, respectively. We studied the effect of florivory on
   pollinator visitation in a buzz-pollinated herb. We used Solanum
   rostratum as the study model because its specialised morphology,
   heterantherous flowers that emit floral scents, demands a close
   association with its pollinators (buzzing bees). We hypothesized that
   when florivores consume the attractive structures (corolla and rewarding
   anthers), the pollinators would visit the damaged flowers less often,
   indirectly affecting S. rostratum reproductive success. Furthermore, we
   hypothesized that consumption of the reproductive structures
   (pollinating anther and pistil) would directly affect the plants
   reproductive success. We conducted observations of three S. rostratum
   populations in central Mexico. We observed twelve species of florivore
   consuming S. rostratum flowers. Florivores preferred to consume the
   attractive structures (corolla) over reproductive structures. However,
   they preferred to consume the anthers specialised for feeding
   pollinators over the anthers specialised for pollination. In addition,
   we recorded floral volatiles emitted by flowers damaged by florivory
   using solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. We identified 25 volatile compounds in S. rostratum
   flowers, mainly aromatic, monoterpene and sesquiterpene compounds. The
   relative proportions of these compounds differed between undamaged and
   damaged flowers. Bioassays showed that both legitimate visitors
   (pollinators) and illegitimate visitors (thieves) visited undamaged
   flowers more often than flowers damaged by florivores; however, the
   decrease in visitation frequency did not affect fruit and seed
   production. In conclusion, the consumption of attractive (corolla) and
   reward floral structures (feeding anthers) reduced the frequency of
   visits by pollinators but does not affect S. rostratum reproductive
   success (fruit and seed set) probably because reproductive structures
   (pistil and pollinating anthers) are less often consumed.}},

Abstract = {{An important function of agri-environmental schemes (AES) is to change
   management of pastures to better conserve biodiversity. However, the
   effects of most AES on biodiversity are poorly understood, especially
   when it comes to effects of AES management over time. The main aim of
   this study is to investigate if the species richness and abundance of
   grassland specialists of vascular plants and two important insect
   pollinator groups (bumblebees and butterflies) differ over time (5
   years) in pastures with AES management (two value levels; general values
   and special values) and pastures without AES management. We also
   investigate if local vegetation characteristics and landscape
   composition relate to species richness in semi-natural grasslands. Using
   data from more than 400 sites we found that species richness of vascular
   plants (grassland specialists) was higher in pastures with AES
   management (for special and general values) compared to those without
   AES, which implies that these schemes do have value of the conservation
   of plant diversity. However, species richness and abundance of
   butterflies (grassland specialists) and bumblebees (all species) did not
   differ significantly among the three AES categories. We found no
   evidence that the type of AES management caused any changes in species
   richness of plants, butterflies or bumblebees during the 5 year period
   of our investigation. It appears that AES management that encourages
   uniform and minimum levels of grazing can have both positive and
   negative effects on biodiversity. For example, pollinators may benefit
   from a lower grazing intensity that could increase flower richness and
   heterogeneity in vegetation height. However, low grazing intensity may
   lead to increased cover of trees and shrubs, which can have negative
   effects for both insect pollinators and vascular plants. The effects of
   landscape composition were weak and only species richness of bumble bees
   were associated with landscape composition. Designing management regimes
   to maintain suitably heterogeneous vegetation layer, and continued
   long-term monitoring of biodiversity will be critical for safeguarding
   culturally and functionally important semi-natural grasslands.}},

   floral richness, not floral identity, was the best predictor of floral

   (i.e. plants found at relatively few sites) were only fully realised
   when farms were embedded in diverse landscapes. Our analysis used the

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{687}},
Pages = {{1285-1294}},

Abstract = {{Of fundamental importance for the functioning of a community is the flow
   of energy and elements through its components. However, the question of
   how (if at all) the edge effect of habitats can drive elemental traits
   of organisms has hitherto been largely neglected issue in ecosystem
   ecology at the community level. We quantified the abundance of
   invertebrates and measured the elemental composition (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Cu,
   Zn, Fe, Mn, As, Cd, Co and Pb) of 15 different organisms within the
   plant-invertebrate food web (plant - oilseed rape pests/herbivores -
   pollinators = wild bees - saprovores - predators - parasitoids) sampled
   in 34 fields of a key bioenergy crop that is an exceptionally strong
   biodiversity driver, the oilseed rape. Then these were related to the
   individual field edge habitat features (including typically
   anthropogenic ones like dirt and tarred roads) measured within a 100 m
   radius around the invertebrate sampling sites. Our study showed that
   elemental traits of the plant-invertebrate food web components in
   oilseed rape crops varied owing to the habitat specificity determined at
   the relatively small spatial scale of an individual field, and that the
   elemental traits of these organisms differed from both an inter- and an
   intra-guild perspective. The major mechanistic explanation for most of
   these relationships seems to derive from the secondary gut content
   effect. Determining one single state for the homeostatic/stoichiometric
   regulation of chemical elements in invertebrates based on the
   application of whole-body metal concentrations is in principle
   impossible, because of the unknown noise caused by the inclusion of
   extracellular portions of metals in the analysis. It is thus imperative
   to develop consistent principles for assessing elemental traits of
   organisms that are based on highly sensitive and high-throughput
   analytical methods for the ionomic profiling of microsamples at the
   organ, tissue, cellular or even sub-cellular levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {{Environmental filtering of body size and darker coloration in pollinator
   communities indicate thermal restrictions on bees, but not flies, at
   high elevations}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{Background. Bees and flies are the two most dominant pollinator taxa in
   mountain environments of the Southwest USA. Communities of both taxa
   change dramatically along elevation gradients. We examined whether bee
   and fly traits would also change along elevation gradients and if so, do
   they change in a predictable way related to a decrease in temperature as
   elevation increases.
   Methods. We used insect body size and darkness traits as proxies for
   energetic requirements and indicators of cold tolerance in order to
   assess patterns of bee and fly community trait differences along an
   elevation gradient. We examined 1,922 individuals of bees and flies
   sampled along an elevation gradient ranging from 2,400 meters to 3,200
   meters and from 9.6 degrees C to 5.2 degrees C mean annual temperature.
   We examined bees and flies separately using community weighted means
   (site-level trait values weighted by species abundance) and estimates of
   environmental filtering (quantified as the inverse of the standardized
   range of trait values).
   Results. Bees and flies exhibited two somewhat distinct patterns; (1)
   Community weighted mean body volume and darkness of bees increased
   sharply at the highest elevation, and the intensity of environmental
   filtering also increased with elevation. This was due to both a change
   among bee populations within a species as well as species replacement at
   the highest elevation. (2) Community weighted mean body volume and
   darkness of flies also increased moderately with increasing elevation,
   but did not exhibit patterns of significant environmental filtering. In
   fact, the intensity of environmental filtering as indicated by the range
   of fly body volume weakened with elevation.
   Conclusion. The increase in filter intensity at high elevations
   exhibited by bees suggests a significant limitation on the breadth of
   viable functional strategies for coping with extreme cold, at least
   within this regional species pool. Flies, on the other hand, do not
   appear to be limited by high elevations, indicating that the shift from
   bee to fly dominance at high elevations may be due, at least in part, to
   greater environmental constraints on bee adaptation to colder
   environments.}},

Title = {{Bees may drive the reproduction of four sympatric cacti in a vanishing
   coastal mediterranean-type ecosystem}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Sympatric congeneric plants might share pollinators, or each
   species might avoid competition by evolving specialized traits that
   generate partitions in pollinator assemblages. In both cases, pollen
   limitation (a decrease in the quality and quantity of compatible
   reproductive pollen) can occur, driving the plant mating system to
   autogamy as a mechanism of reproductive assurance. We assessed the
   relationships between pollinator assemblages and mating systems in a
   group of sympatric congeneric plants. We attempted to answer the
   following questions:
   (i) How similar are pollinator assemblages among sympatric cactus
   species?
   (ii) Which mating systems do sympatric cactus species use?
   Methods: We studied sympatric Eriosyce taxa that inhabit a threatened
   coastal strip in a mediterranean-type ecosystem in central Chile. We
   performed field observations on four taxa and characterized pollinators
   during the years 2016 and 2017. We estimated differences in the
   pollinator assemblages using the Bray-Curtis index. To elucidate the
   mating systems, we conducted hand-pollination experiments using three
   treatments: manual cross-pollination, automatic self-pollination, and
   control (unmanipulated individuals). We tested differences in seed
   production for statistical significance using Kruskal-Wallis analysis.
   Results: Eriosyce subgibbosa showed a distinctive pollinator assemblage
   among the sympatric species that we studied (similarity ranged from 0\%
   to 8\%); it was visited by small bees and was the only species that was
   visited by the giant hummingbird Patagona gigas. Pollinator assemblages
   were similar between E. chilensis (year 2016 = 4 species; 2017 = 8) and
   E. chilensis var. albidiflora (2016 = 7; 2017 = 4); however, those of E.
   curvispina var. mutabilis (2016 = 7; 2017 = 6) were less similar to
   those of the aforementioned species. E. curvispina var. mutabilis showed
   the highest interannual variation in its pollinator assemblage (18\%
   similarity). Reproduction in E. subgibbosa largely depends on
   pollinators, although it showed some degree of autogamy. Autonomous
   pollination was unfeasible in E. chilensis, which depended on flower
   visitors for its reproductive success. Both E. chilensis var.
   albidiflora and E. curvispina var. mutabilis showed some degree of
   autogamy.
   Discussion: We observed differences in pollinator assemblages between E.
   subgibbosa and the remaining Eriosyce taxa, which depend on
   hymenopterans for pollen transfer. Pollinator assemblages showed
   considerable interannual variation, especially those of E. subgibbosa
   (ornithophilous syndrome) and E. curvispina var. mutabilis
   (melitophilous syndrome). Autogamous reproduction in these taxa may act
   as a reproductive assurance mechanism when pollinator availability is
   unpredictable. Our study contributes to improving our understanding of
   the reproductive systems of ecological interactions between threatened
   species in a Chilean mediterranean-type ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Nature-based agriculture that reduces dependency on chemical inputs
   requires using ecological principles for sustainable agro-ecosystems,
   aiming to balance ecology, economics and social justice. There is
   growing evidence that pollinator-dependent crops with high insect,
   particularly bee, pollination service can give higher yields. However,
   the interacting effects between insect pollination and agricultural
   inputs on crop yields and farm economics remain to be established to
   reconcile food production with biodiversity conservation. We quantified
   individual and combined effects of pesticides, insect pollination and
   soil quality on oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) yield and gross margin,
   using a total of 294 farmers' fields surveyed between 2013 and 2016. We
   show that yield and gross margins are greater (15-40\%) in fields with
   higher pollinator abundance than in fields with reduced pollinator
   abundance. This effect is, however, strongly reduced by pesticide use.
   Greater yields may be achieved by either increasing agrochemicals or
   increasing bee abundance, but crop economic returns were only increased
   by the latter, because pesticides did not increase yields while their
   costs reduced gross margins.}},

Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Apart from floral morphology and colours perceived by the human eye,
   ultraviolet (UV) reflectance acts as an important visual advertisement
   of numerous flowering plant species for pollinators. However, the effect
   of UV signalling on attracting pollinators of particular plant species
   is still insufficiently studied, especially in the Afrotropics.
   Therefore, we studied the pollination system of Hypoxis camerooniana in
   montane grasslands of Mount Cameroon, West/Central Africa. We focused
   mainly on the effects of the flowers' UV reflectance on its visitors. We
   experimentally removed UV reflection from petals either completely or
   partially. Thereafter, flower visitors were recorded and pistils were
   collected post-flowering to quantify germinated pollen tubes per
   treatments. The most important visitors were bees, followed by flies.
   Due to their contacts with reproductive organs bees are considered as
   the primary pollinators. Visitation rates were lower when UV reflectance
   was completely removed, whereas the decrease of frequency on
   half-treated flowers did not differ significantly from control
   treatments. The complete removal of UV also affected bees' landing
   behaviour, but not that of flies. We showed that the presence of UV
   reflectance is more important than UV pattern for bees visiting flowers
   of H. camerooniana. We hypothesize that exploiting all flowers
   irrespective of their pattern can be more efficient for pollinators in
   the open grasslands of high altitudes to spot these relatively scarce
   flowers by their UV reflectance. Furthermore, we highlight the necessity
   of both experimental and natural controls in similar studies to control
   for additional effects of the used UV manipulations.}},

   metagenomics approach has greater potential for accurately quantifying
   species relative abundances, but applying metagenomics to eukaryotes is
   challenging due to low numbers of reference genomes. We have developed a
   pipeline, RevMet (Reverse Metagenomics) that allows reliable and
   semi-quantitative characterization of the species composition of
   mixed-species eukaryote samples, such as bee-collected pollen, without
   requiring reference genomes. Instead, reference species are represented
   only by `genome skims': low-cost, low-coverage, short-read sequence
   datasets. The skims are mapped to individual long reads sequenced from
   mixed-species samples using the MinION, a portable nanopore sequencing
   device, and each long read is uniquely assigned to a plant species. We
   genome-skimmed 49 wild UK plant species, validated our pipeline with
   mock DNA mixtures of known composition, and then applied RevMet to
   pollen loads collected from wild bees. We demonstrate that RevMet can
   identify plant species present in mixed-species samples at proportions
   of DNA >= 1\%, with few false positives and false negatives, and
   reliably differentiate species represented by high versus low amounts of
   DNA in a sample. RevMet could readily be adapted to generate
   semi-quantitative datasets for a wide range of mixed eukaryote samples.
   Our per-sample costs were 90 pound per genome skim and 60 pound per
   pollen sample, and new versions of sequencers available now will further
   reduce these costs.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are commonly used to provide pollination services within
   crop fields and greenhouses, with Bombus impatiens Cresson; Hymenoptera:
   Apidae, a bee native to the eastern United States, being the only
   managed bumble bee available commercially in the United States. Although
   many researchers have explored managed bumble bees' ability to pollinate
   various crops and the potential spread of pathogens by managed bumble
   bees, scant research is available on how managed bumble bee colony
   health is affected after foraging within crop fields. We measured 10 B.
   impatiens colony health parameters: 1) colony weight; number of 2)
   honey/pollen pots, 3) workers, 4) queens, 5) drones, 6) immatures, 7)
   eggs; and weight of 8) workers, 9) drones, and 10) queens from colonies
   that foraged within blueberry or watermelon fields, and compared them to
   control colonies that were purchased and immediately frozen upon
   receipt. Bees that foraged within blueberry increased in colony weight
   and in the number of immatures and eggs during the bloom period compared
   to control colonies. In contrast, bee colonies placed within watermelon
   decreased in colony weight, number of workers and immature bees, and
   individual bee weight compared to control colonies. Blueberry appeared
   to provide bees with sufficient nectar and pollen, whereas watermelon
   may not have provided adequate resources for the bees. Bees foraging
   within watermelon were probably forced to search for other sources of
   pollen and nectar, resulting in colony health parameter declines. Our
   data suggest that some crops (e.g., blueberry) can support managed B.
   impatiens, potentially adding to localized bumble bee populations, while
   others (e.g., watermelon) cannot.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are often considered to be effective pollinators in both

   compare pollination effectiveness, visit frequency and pollen foraging
   behaviour between female and male individuals of a mining bee, Andrena
   emeishanica, visiting a nectariferous spring flower (Epimedium
   pubescens). Female bees were observed to forage for both pollen and
   nectar, but male bees foraged only for nectar. Female bees had large
   hairy hind tibiae with conspicuous scopae, and nearly 90\% of the pollen
   grains they collected went onto the hind legs. Male bees removed less
   pollen from anthers than female bees but deposited more pollen on
   stigmas per visit. The higher pollen transfer efficiency of male bees
   was due to 48.4\% of pollen grains remaining ungroomed on the thorax and
   abdomen, available for stigma contact, but their visitation rate to
   flowers was much lower. Our results indicate that male solitary bees

Abstract = {{Most bees collect pollen and nectar for their larvae, while some also

   oil-collecting behaviour in the Apidae and the evolutionary effects of
   floral oils on host brood cells for cuckoo bees. Focusing on apid bee
   phylogeny, we reconstructed the evolution of floral oil collection by
   females, use of floral oils in cell construction and the inclusion of
   oils in provisioning immatures. Ancestral character reconstruction
   demonstrates that floral oil-collecting behaviour arose four times
   independently. We also found that in cuckoo bees, parasitization of
   oil-collecting bees arose three times (including one secondary return)
   in Apidae. Except for Ctenoplectrina, oil cuckoo bees are all closely
   related to each other, forming an independent clade within the
   Nomadinae. Analysis of evolutionary transition rates indicates that
   there is a greater tendency for switching from an oil-collecting host to
   a non-oil-collecting host than the reverse. In apid bees, evolutionary
   transition rates are higher for switching to cuckoo behaviour from an

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are important insect pollinators for many wildflowers and
   crops. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non-coding small RNAs that
   regulate different biological functions in insects. In this study, the
   miRNAs in the heads of the three castes of the bumblebee Bombus
   lantschouensis were identified and characterized by small RNA deep
   sequencing. The significant differences in the expression of miRNAs and
   their target genes were analyzed. The results showed that the length of
   the small RNA reads from males, queens, and workers was distributed
   between 18 and 30 nt, with a peak at 22 nt. A total of 364 known and 89
   novel miRNAs were identified from the heads of the three castes. The
   eight miRNAs with the highest expressed levels in males, queens, and
   workers were identical, although the order of these miRNAs based on
   expression differed. The male vs. queen, male vs. worker, and worker vs.
   queen comparisons identified nine, fourteen, and four miRNAs with
   significant differences in expression, respectively. The different
   castes were clustered based on the differentially expressed miRNAs (DE
   miRNAs), and the expression levels of the DE miRNAs obtained by RT-qPCR
   were consistent with the read counts obtained through Solexa sequencing.
   The putative target genes of these DE miRNAs were enriched in 29 Gene
   Ontology (GO) terms, and catalytic activity was the most enriched GO
   term, as demonstrated by its association with 2837 target genes in the
   male vs. queen comparison, 3535 target genes in the male vs. worker
   comparison, and 2185 target genes in the worker vs. queen comparison.
   This study highlights the characteristics of the miRNAs in the three B.

Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{349-358}},

Abstract = {{A prime example of plant-animal interactions is the interaction between
   plants and pollinators, which typically receive nectar and/or pollen as
   reward for their pollination service. While nectar provides mostly
   carbohydrates, pollen represents the main source of protein and lipids
   for many pollinators. However, the main function of pollen is to carry
   nutrients for pollen tube growth and thus fertilization. It is unclear
   whether pollinator attraction exerts a sufficiently strong selective
   pressure to alter the nutritional profile of pollen, e.g., through
   increasing its crude protein content or protein-to-lipid ratio, which
   both strongly affect bee foraging. Pollen nutritional quality may also
   be merely determined by phylogenetic relatedness, with pollen of closely
   related plants showing similar nutritional profiles due to shared
   biosynthetic pathways or floral morphologies. Here, we present a
   meta-analysis of studies on pollen nutrients to test whether differences
   in pollen nutrient contents and ratios correlated with plant insect
   pollinator dependence and/or phylogenetic relatedness. We hypothesized
   that if pollen nutritional content was affected by pollinator
   attraction, it should be different (e.g., higher) in highly
   pollinator-dependent plants, independent of phylogenetic relatedness. We
   found that crude protein and the protein-to-lipid ratio in pollen
   strongly correlated with phylogeny. Moreover, pollen protein content was
   higher in plants depending mostly or exclusively on insect pollination.
   Pollen nutritional quality thus correlated with both phylogenetic
   relatedness and pollinator dependency, indicating that, besides
   producing pollen with sufficient nutrients for reproduction, the
   nutrient profile of zoophilous plants may have been shaped by their
   pollinators' nutritional needs.}},

Title = {{Urban development decreases bee abundance and diversity within coastal

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{20}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Globally, coastal human population density is approximately three times
   than that of inland areas. Such development threatens the integrity of
   coastal ecosystems. Coastal dune systems contain unique sets of
   terrestrial invertebrates and native plants, and represent some of the
   last remaining areas of semi-natural habitats along the coasts. In our
   study, we monitored bee and flowering plant abundance and diversity
   within coastal dune systems located within protected lands and developed
   sites throughout South and Central Florida. Our aim was to assess the
   potential impacts dune degradation and development could have on these
   economically and ecologically important insects. A total of 5419 bees
   from 5 families and 56 taxa were captured using bowl traps. Halictidae
   accounted for 70\% of all bees collected, followed by Apidae (28\%),
   Megachilidae (2\%), Andrenidae (0.1\%) and Colletidae (0.07\%). Both
   species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were higher in
   protected lands when compared with developed sites. A majority of the
   commonly collected bee species showed higher abundances in protected
   lands compared with developed sites. Protected lands also supported
   higher abundances of ground, wood, and tunnel-nesting bees when compared
   with developed sites. Bee species richness and Shannon-Wiener indices
   were lower in sites with greater percentages of development occurring
   within close proximity to the dune systems, and higher in sites with
   greater availability of dune coverage. We observed higher abundance and
   flowering plant species richness within protected lands when compared
   with developed sites; protected lands also supported more federally
   endangered/threatened or state protected plant species compared with
   developed sites. Overall, coastal dune systems are ecologically
   important bee sanctuaries and should be conserved to help sustain native
   bee communities and the flowering plants that occur within them. (c)

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Insects pollinate many globally important crops and therefore rapid and
   effective means to measure crop pollinators and pollination are required
   to support national monitoring schemes and allow localised measurements
   of pollinator supply and demand to crops. We tested user-friendly
   protocols for assessing pollinators and pollination in crops to better
   understand the capacity and willingness of a group of farmers and
   citizen scientists to implement such techniques in the field. We asked
   the different recorder groups including farmers and agronomists,
   non-expert volunteers and experienced researchers to complete three
   pollinator and pollination service assessment techniques: transect
   walks, pan trapping and pollinator exclusion and supplementary
   pollination. Recorders provided feedback on each method through a
   questionnaire and the data collected using different methods were
   compared. Our volunteer members of the public, and farmers and
   agronomists were able to implement all assessment techniques in apple,
   bean and oilseed rape fields. The experienced researchers and volunteer
   members of the public were more willing to record bumblebees to species
   level on transects than the farmers and agronomists. There was also a
   significant interaction between recorder and crop type for certain
   insect taxa demonstrating that in certain crops some taxa may be easier
   to record than others. All our recorder groups found transects and pan
   traps straightforward and enjoyable to implement. Our non-expert
   volunteers were willing to use pollinator exclusion and supplementary
   pollination techniques as part of a wider scheme, the farmers and
   agronomists who implemented the technique were less positive about
   applying this method more widely. We have demonstrated that volunteer
   recorders, including farmers and agronomists, can be engaged and are
   able to implement methods to assess pollinators and pollination,
   although additional training is necessary to ensure accurate species
   data collection. For the more direct and time consuming measures of
   pollination service, both training and additional support may be needed,
   particularly for farmers. The tools developed and tested here will be
   valuable for wider pollinator monitoring schemes and for integration
   into standard agronomic practices. (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{The assessment of nature's contribution to people (NCP) is an important
   strategy for decision-making given the increasing need to reconcile
   biodiversity and human society with conservation. A monetary and a
   non-monetary approaches were combined to evaluate the pollination
   services provided by two Brazilian protected areas (PAs) in northern
   (Serra da Bocaina, Para) and southeastern region (Mata do Jambreiro,
   Minas Gerais) within the Amazon forest and Atlantic forest biomes,
   respectively. The monetary valuation methodology was based on the role
   of pollination for crop production in the municipalities surrounding the
   PAs, and the non-monetary involved estimating the areas with wider range
   of resources for sustaining pollinators. In Serra da Bocaina, the total
   annual monetary value of the pollination services performed by bee
   species was estimated at approximately 564,000 dollars and in Mata do
   Jambreiro, 246,000 dollars, both for 2016. The non-monetary valuation
   highlighted the PAs and their surrounding areas with denser plant
   coverage. The methods used in this study allowed us to evaluate and
   integrate different types of information: bee diversity data, the
   spatial data of the PAs and their surroundings, and the economic value
   of the agricultural production of the neighbouring municipalities. The
   results can be applied in management and sustainability studies aiming
   to increase awareness about the importance of PAs and their value and
   importance for agricultural production. This study demonstrates where
   efforts can be concentrated for future proposals for valuating
   pollination services and conservation strategies, especially in areas

Volume = {{238}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ecologically complex agroecosystems often provide multiple conservation
   benefits, yet understanding the agricultural practices that favor
   biodiversity is often a theoretical task until we simultaneously
   demonstrate the economic impact of such practices on farmers. We provide
   a multifunctional analysis of both biodiversity and ecosystem services
   that influence coffee farm profit in Puerto Rico. We show that the
   vegetation heterogeneity of an agroecosystem, more so than any one
   ecological component (e.g. shade), is associated with a higher
   biodiversity of plants, birds, lizards, bees, ants, and parasitoid
   wasps. However, a farm's vegetation heterogeneity does not consistently
   correlate with profit-related ecosystem services, including coffee yield
   and biological control of coffee pests and pathogens, due to tradeoffs
   between services. Therefore, inherent financial incentives that would
   encourage farmers to manage farms in ways that maintain high associated
   biodiversity may be lacking. We explored several economic incentives
   that would allow farms to be simultaneously biodiverse and profitable,
   which we show is possible through realistic incentive schemes. We found
   that the combination of a certification premium plus carbon payments
   (50\% premium plus \$16 t(-1) CO(2)e) or a restructuring of agricultural
   subsidies using currently experienced subsidy amounts may be sufficient
   to make farms that are more heterogeneous, and therefore more
   biodiverse, the most profitable option for farmers. If these biodiverse
   farms can also be profitable, it will open critical opportunities for
   maintaining rural landscapes that support farmers' livelihoods, as well
   as protect the planet's biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of monocultures and the overuse of agrochemicals have
   resulted in the loss of beneficial insects and disruption of ecosystem
   services such as pollination and biological control in agricultural
   landscapes. Bees, wasps and flower flies were our model groups to
   investigate how landscape structure attributes affect alpha and beta
   diversity of different beneficial insect groups in Brazilian landscapes
   containing coffee crops. Species richness and abundance of wasps, and
   bee richness were positively correlated with forest cover at multiple
   spatial extents. Bee abundance, and species richness and abundance of
   flower flies did not respond to any landscape predictor. The community
   composition of wasps and bees in landscapes with low forest cover was
   composed of subsets of the communities located in forested landscapes,
   leading to species loss in structurally impoverished landscapes. High
   variations in landscape diversity and edge density between landscapes
   resulted in flower fly species replacement suggesting that pairs of
   landscapes with high and low diversity of habitat types and edge density
   harbor different species. Such results indicate that initiatives for the
   conservation of beneficial insects in the Atlantic Forest biodiversity
   hotspot must focus on forest conservation and restoration, because high
   levels of forest loss can result in the loss of wasp and bee species
   with potential negative consequences for the provision of pollination

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture has led to a reduction of overall biodiversity and
   ecosystem services such as pollination and biological control. To offset
   these economic losses, many farmers are planting native wildflowers to
   enhance flowering plant diversity and augment pollinator and other
   beneficial arthropod populations on their farms. In this study, we
   examined arthropod communities in Florida (USA) within wildflower plots
   and fallow control plots, which were primarily composed of grasses.
   Significantly more herbivorous insects, predatory arthropods, and
   pollinators were found within wildflower plots than in fallow control
   plots. We also implemented pollinator surveys at flowering plants. These
   surveys highlighted numerous plant-pollinator interactions within
   wildflower plots, supporting the idea that some native wildflower
   species are more attractive to pollinators than are others.
   Nevertheless, utilizing diverse flowering plants for wildflower plots
   may support a wide diversity of beneficial arthropod species, including
   native bees. Our results suggest that wildflower plantings in Florida
   can be a successful management tool to harbor increased overall plant
   and arthropod diversity (including native pollinators and other
   beneficial arthropods) within intensive agricultural areas.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Despite their diversity and abundance, the importance of native, forest
   bee communities to pollination services and inherent biological
   diversity conservation is often overlooked. We studied forest bee
   communities in Delaware and Pennsylvania, USA, to better understand how
   forest bee community structure varies with changing land use and
   microhabitat quality among small, urban and suburban forest fragments in
   the mid-Atlantic United States. Our hypotheses were that (1)
   microhabitat quality would affect relative abundance of bee taxa, (2)
   surrounding landscape composition would drive local patch
   colonization-extinction dynamics, and (3) forest patch size would not
   affect community structure and composition. We found a lack of spatial
   autocorrelation among forest patches, indicating the importance of
   individual fragments in the autonomous generation and/or maintenance of
   bee communities. Community analyses revealed the importance of both
   landscape context and microhabitat quality in defining forest bee
   communities. By partitioning beta diversity into its constituent
   components, we also found that landscape composition drove changes in
   the relative abundance of taxa, while both landscape and microhabitat
   characteristics significantly influenced species turnover. Neither
   landscape composition nor quality of the microhabitat influenced initial
   site occupancy or colonization-extinction dynamics. Bisected by
   highways, suburban neighborhoods, agricultural lands, and urban
   development, many urban and suburban forest patches in the eastern
   United States are similar in composition to our study sites. As many
   native forest bees have limited capacity for long-range movement between
   forest patches, these remaining forest fragments are critical to the
   conservation of unique and speciose forest bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is a known predictor of foraging distance in stingless bees

   distances, particularly in tropical regions, are poorly understood.
   Here, we use translocation ('homing') experiments, the release of marked
   individuals at various distances from the nest, to investigate how
   homing abilities of the Neotropical stingless bee, Scaptotrigona aff.
   postica differ across the transition between wet and dry seasons
   (February-August) in a heterogenous tropical landscape in the eastern
   Brazilian Amazon. We also determined nectar sugar concentrations of
   unmanipulated returning foragers to assess temporal changes in collected
   resource quality. Maximum and typical homing distances (i.e. distances
   where 90\% and 50\% of released bees are lost) were estimated to be 860
   and 392 m, respectively, confirming that while some individuals travel
   long distances, most workers must remain close to nests during foraging
   trips. Homing distances and collected nectar sugar concentrations showed
   inverse temporal patterns, as homing range declined in later months (May
   to August), whereas nectar sugar concentrations increased over the same
   period. Thus, shorter homing distances in later `dry season' months
   probably reflected an increased availability of floral resources
   compared with earlier months. Together, our findings highlight the
   limited spatial extent of foraging activities in S. aff. postica
   workers, and that bee homing distances vary with environmental
   conditions. These results provide useful information for both stingless
   bee colony management and conservation in humid tropical regions.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an important ecosystem service threatened by current

   Here, we experimentally test whether plant species roles in pollination
   networks can be used to identify species with the most potential to
   recover plant-pollinator communities. Using published pollination
   networks, we calculated each plant's centrality and chose five central
   and five peripheral plant species for introduction into replicate
   experimental plots. Flower visitation by pollinators was recorded in
   each plot and we tested the impact of introduced central and peripheral
   plant species on the pollinator and resident plant communities and on
   network structure. We found that the introduction of central plant
   species attracted a higher richness and abundance of pollinators than
   the introduction of peripheral species, and that the introduced central
   plant species occupied the most important network roles. The high
   attractiveness of central species to pollinators, however, did not
   negatively affect visitation to resident plant species by pollinators.
   We also found that the introduction of central plant species did not
   affect network structure, while networks with introduced peripheral
   species had lower centralisation and interaction evenness than networks
   with introduced central species. To our knowledge, this is the first
   time species network roles have been tested in a field experiment. Given

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are among the most abundant and important wild pollinators

   The aim of this study was to investigate the habitat use, nesting
   phenology, and key food plants of spring bumble bee queens. Through 108
   nonlethal surveys of bumble bee queens in spring 2018, researchers
   observed 451 nest seeking and 555 foraging queens of nine species in
   Ohio, U.S.A. Spring queen activity began in mid-April and peaked in mid
   -May, although nest seekers were observed into late June. Nest seeking
   queens favored woody transitional habitats over open habitats. In
   accordance queen abundance and diversity increased with the proportion
   of forest in the surrounding landscape. The proportion of row crops and
   urban areas negatively influenced queen diversity and the number of nest
   seekers, respectively. Through a literature review, the earliest
   emergence dates for each species were compared for 12 datasets to
   establish an order of species emergence in northeastern North America.
   Fortyseven species of flowering plants were used by foraging queens.

Abstract = {{Plants growing along steep elevational gradients experience variations

   with pollinators in response to elevation by identifying pollinators and
   measuring morphological and biochemical floral traits as well as
   studying the breeding systems of ten aggregated Rhododendron species in
   the Sikkim Himalaya. Corolla length, nectar volume and distance between
   stamen and stigma significantly decreased with elevation. In contrast,
   nectar concentrations were positively associated with elevation. Birds,
   bumblebees and flies were the three dominant pollinator groups. Bird
   visits showed a strong negative association with elevation while visits

   using the ecological economics Avoided Cost Method, also known as
   replacement cost. Farms from this region informally hire temporary day
   laborers to supplement natural pollination with manual pollination of

   used to estimate the economic value of bee pollination. The value of

Abstract = {{Aim Understanding fire effects on pollinators is critical in the context
   of fire regime changes and the global pollination crisis. Through a
   systematic and quantitative review of the literature, we provide the
   first global assessment of pollinator responses to fire. We hypothesize
   that pollinators increase after fire and during the early postfire
   succession stages; however, high fire frequency has the opposite effect,
   decreasing pollinators. Location Terrestrial ecosystems, excluding
   Antarctica. Time period Data collected from 1973 to 2017. Major taxa
   studied Insects (Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera) and a
   few bird species. Methods We first compiled available studies across the
   globe that assessed fire effects on pollinator communities. Then, by
   means of hierarchical meta-analyses, we evaluated how different fire
   regime parameters (fire frequency, postfire time and fire type) and
   habitat characteristics affect the abundance and richness of animals
   that act as pollinators. We also explored to what extent the responses
   vary among taxa groups and life history traits of pollinators (sociality
   system, nest location and feeding specialization), and among biomes.
   Results The overall effect size of fire on pollinator abundance and
   richness across all studies was positive. Fire effect was especially
   clear and significant in early postfire communities, after wildfires,
   and for Hymenoptera. Taxonomic resolution influenced fire effects, where
   only studies at the species/genus and family levels showed significant
   effects. The main exceptions were recurrent fires that showed a negative
   effect, and especially wildfire effects on Lepidoptera abundance that
   showed a significant negative response. Main conclusions Pollinators
   tend to be promoted after a wildfire event. However, short fire
   intervals may threat pollinators, and especially lepidopterans. Given
   the current fire regime changes at the global scale, it is imperative to
   monitor postfire pollinators across many ecosystems, as our results
   suggest that fire regime is critical in determining the dynamics of
   pollinator communities.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of plant species worldwide are dependent on birds for
   pollination. While the ecology and evolution of interactions between
   specialist nectarivorous birds and the plants they pollinate is
   relatively well understood, very little is known on pollination by
   generalist birds. The flower characters of this pollination syndrome are
   clearly defined but the geographical distribution patterns, habitat
   preferences and ecological factors driving the evolution of
   generalist-bird-pollinated plant species have never been analysed.
   Herein I provide an overview, compare the distribution of character
   states for plants growing on continents with those occurring on oceanic
   islands and discuss the environmental factors driving the evolution of
   both groups. The ecological niches of generalist-bird-pollinated plant
   species differ: on continents these plants mainly occur in habitats with
   pronounced climatic seasonality whereas on islands
   generalist-bird-pollinated plant species mainly occur in evergreen
   forests. Further, on continents generalist-bird-pollinated plant species
   are mostly shrubs and other large woody species producing numerous
   flowers with a self-incompatible reproductive system, while on islands
   they are mostly small shrubs producing fewer flowers and are
   self-compatible. This difference in character states indicates that
   diverging ecological factors are likely to have driven the evolution of
   these groups: on continents, plants that evolved generalist bird
   pollination escape from pollinator groups that tend to maintain
   self-pollination by installing feeding territories in single flowering
   trees or shrubs, such as social bees or specialist nectarivorous birds.
   This pattern is more pronounced in the New compared to the Old World. By
   contrast, on islands, plants evolved generalist bird pollination as an
   adaptation to birds as a reliable pollinator group, a pattern previously
   known from plants pollinated by specialist nectarivorous birds in
   tropical mountain ranges. Additionally, I discuss the evolutionary
   origins of bird pollination systems in comparison to systems involving
   specialist nectarivorous birds and reconstruct the bird pollination
   system of Hawaii, which may represent an intermediate between a
   specialist and generalist bird pollination system. I also discuss the
   interesting case of Australia, where it is difficult to distinguish
   between specialist and generalist bird pollination systems.}},

   red flowers. Above a steep transition zone with mixed-colored
   populations (c. 1000-1300 m) most flowers were purple and beetles were
   rare. Color-trapping experiments revealed a strong preference for red
   over other colors in beetles and colorimetric modeling suggests that a
   simple chromatic mechanism is sufficient to explain their color choices.
   We thus hypothesize that beetles select for red flowers and that with
   increasing elevation and decreasing beetle density, other flower
   visitors (e.g., bees) gain importance as pollinators and select for a
   different color.}},

Abstract = {{1. Urban ecosystems create suitable habitats for many plant and animal
   species, including pollinators. However, heterogenic habitats in city
   centres and suburban areas have various effects on pollinators due to
   variations in the composition of vegetation and in landscape management
   by humans. 2. This study compared the abundance and species richness of
   three main groups of pollinators - wild bees, butterflies, and
   hoverflies - in Poznan, western Poland, and in three different types of
   urban green areas - urban grasslands, urban parks, and green
   infrastructure in housing estates. 3. The total abundance of pollinators
   was higher in urban grasslands than in housing estates and urban parks.
   Species composition of pollinator communities differed between the three
   habitat types. 4. The study results showed that species richness and
   abundance of butterflies varied between habitat types, whereas no such
   differences were found in the case of wild bees and hoverflies. Cover of
   green area, vegetation structure, and plant height were important for
   the pollinator community; however, these variables had different effects
   depending on habitat type. 5. These findings revealed that not all urban
   green areas are equally valuable in terms of local biodiversity.
   High-quality urban habitats such as urban grasslands are capable of
   supporting rich and abundant populations of pollinators. Therefore, it
   is important to protect high-value urban green areas and simultaneously
   strive to improve intensively managed urban habitats through effective

Abstract = {{The use of insecticides based on metabolites found in live organisms,
   such as the insecticide spinosad, has been an option for the control of
   agricultural pests because of the allegedly low toxicological risk for
   nontarget arthropods, such as stingless bees. In the current study, we
   evaluate the effects of chronic oral exposure to spinosad during the
   larval phase on survival, developmental time, body mass, midgut
   epithelial remodeling, and the peritrophic matrix (PM) of Partamona
   helleri stingless bee workers. Worker larvae that were raised in the
   laboratory were orally exposed to different concentrations (0, 6.53,
   13.06, 32.64, and 3,264 ng. a.i. bee(-1)) of spinosad (formulation), and
   the resulting survival, developmental time, and body mass were studied.
   The concentration of spinosad recommended for use in the field (3,264
   ng. a.i. bee(-1)) reduced the survival of workers during development.
   Also, sublethal concentrations of spinosad delayed the development and
   caused morphological changes in the midgut epithelium. Finally, the
   chronic exposure of larvae to 32.64 ng. a.i. bee(-1) spinosad also
   altered the remodeling of the midgut during metamorphosis and affected
   the organization of the PM of larvae, pupae, and adults. Our data
   suggest possible environmental risks for using spinosad in cultures that
   are naturally pollinated by stingless bees. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The bee tribe Eucerini is a large monophyletic taxon occurring in all
   continents, except Oceania and Antarctica, but far more diverse in the
   Americas and, especially, in the Neotropics. The phylogenetic
   relationships within its subtribe Eucerina, which contains the bulk of
   Eucerini diversity, is poorly understood, this being especially true for
   the relationships among its Neotropical representatives, which have been
   poorly represented in all phylogenetic studies, including Eucerini, to
   date. This leads to a generalized lack of confidence on the monophyly of
   the groups currently accepted as genera and subgenera. Here, a
   phylogenetic study based on three molecular markers (COI, 18S, and 28S,
   totalling about 1700 bp) and 58 morphological characters is presented as
   a contribution to the understanding of the relationships of the
   so-called Thygater-Trichocerapis group, and especially of the genus
   Thygater Holmberg, which has not previously been extensively sampled.
   Representatives of Trichocerapis, including its monotypic subgenus T.
   (Dithygater), are included for the first time in a phylogenetic study.
   The main results were: (i) support for the monophyly of the
   Thygater-Trichocerapis group; (ii) support for the monophyly of
   Thygater; (iii) recognition of two main clades in Thygater, each one
   containing the type species of one of the previously recognized
   subgenera; and (iv) additional support for the position of
   Alloscirtetica as sister to all remaining Eucerina. Based on these
   results a redefinition of the scope of the two subgenera of Thygater is
   proposed, with changes in the subordination of three of its species, T.

Abstract = {{Flowers may become inoculated with pathogens that can infect bees and

   forage freely on flowers of a variety of shapes in a flight cage.
   Flowers were then examined under ultraviolet light for fluorescing fecal
   matter. We found that bumble bees did defecate on floral surfaces during
   foraging and that composite flowers with a large area of disk flowers
   were the most likely to have feces on them. Our results point to

   Honeybees During and After Apple Bloom}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Honeybees closely rely on insect-pollinated plants for their survival.
   Each forager bee displays a tendency of loyalty toward specific plant
   species during the many daily foraging flights. Due to the ease of
   collection, pollen loads have been extensively used as a proxy for
   detection of pesticide residues. Pollen is the main protein food source
   for colonies, and its contamination has also been addressed as a reason
   for the colony losses phenomenon. As honeybees fly over a variable but
   wide range territory, they might collect pollen from both agricultural,
   urban and wild environments, also displaying considerable preferences in
   botanical sources between colonies of the same apiary. It is thus
   difficult to address the source of the pesticide contamination, when
   pollen is analyzed as a whole. In the current study, a practical and
   reliable approach has been proposed to narrow down the source of
   contamination. Pollen loads have been collected from colonies placed in
   eight locations over large apple orchard extensions in Trentino-South
   Tyrol region (Italy), during and 2 weeks after apple blossom. The pollen
   loads have been separated by the color due to the predominant plant
   species. On each color group, palynology and multi-residual chemical
   analyses have been performed in parallel. The pollen hazard quotient
   (PHQ) was used to estimate the risk to honeybees of each color group and
   of the total collected pollen. Apple and dandelion pollen were the main
   portions of the first collection, while a greater variety emerged after
   the apple blossom. Dandelion was always present in the samples. The
   frequency and the amount of pesticide residues differed according to the
   collection periods, the locations and the pollen color groups. The
   amount of insecticide residues increased after the apple blossom, while
   no difference between the period was found on fungicide residues. The
   PHQ values were higher after the blossom due to the insecticide
   contribution, with highest values of 160,000 and 150,000. The variations
   within samples did not allow to identify a unique source of
   contamination, whereas it seems that the pollen from plants outside the
   agricultural areas has as much residues as the pollen from apple
   orchards.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on foraging partitioning in pollinators can provide critical
   information to the understanding of food-web niche and pollination
   functions, thus aiding conservation. Metabarcoding based on PCR
   amplification and high-throughput sequencing has seen increasing
   applications in characterizing pollen loads carried by pollinators.
   However, amplification bias across taxa could lead to unpredictable
   artefacts in estimation of pollen compositions. We examined the efficacy
   of a genome-skimming method based on direct shotgun sequencing in
   quantifying mixed pollen, using mock samples (five and 14 mocks of
   flower and bee pollen, respectively). The results demonstrated a high
   level of repeatability and accuracy in identifying pollen from mixtures
   of varied species ratios. All pollen species were detected in all mocks,
   and pollen frequencies estimated from the number of sequence reads of
   each species were significantly correlated with pollen count proportions
   (linear model, R-2 = 86.7\%, p = 2.2e-16). For >97\% of the mixed taxa,
   pollen proportion could be quantified by sequencing to the correct order
   of magnitude, even for species which constituted only 0.2\% of the total
   pollen. In addition, DNA extracted from pollen grains equivalent to
   those collected from a single honeybee corbicula was sufficient for
   genome-skimming. We conclude that genome-skimming is a feasible approach
   to identifying and quantifying mixed pollen samples. By providing
   reliable and sensitive taxon identification and relative abundance, this
   method is expected to improve our understanding in studies that involve
   plant-pollinator interactions, such as pollen preference in corbiculate
   bees, pollen diet analyses and identification of landscape pollen
   resource use from beehives.}},

Abstract = {{Testing inbred lines for their combining ability is, due to high numbers
   of line to line testing needed for determination of hybrid performance,
   the most limiting factor in the F-1 hybrid breeding procedure. We
   propose a novel method of F-1 hybrid breeding that enables evaluation of
   large number of line to line crosses for their hybrid performance.
   Inbred lines (preferably doubled haploid - DH) are produced from
   heterozygous populations, genotyped and maintained. A group of lines is
   inter-pollinated randomly and their progeny examined. To identify elite
   F-1 hybrids, these individual plants are selected by their superior
   phenotypic characteristics. Finally using paternity testing only of
   selected hybrids, the origin of paternal lines is revealed. To predict
   the number of F-1 offspring needed in relation to the number of inbred
   lines being inter-pollinated, a mathematical formula was developed. For
   instance, using this formula for the inter-pollination of 60 distinct
   lines, the probability of obtaining all descendants of paternal-parent
   lines in a maternal-parent row represented at least once is achieved
   with 420 F-1 plants in a row (p = 0.95). In a practical experiment with
   white cabbage, DH lines were produced using microspore culture; plants
   were grown to maturity and genotyped at eight polymorphic SSR loci. Two
   groups of lines (36 and 33 lines per group) were inter-pollinated by two
   methods, either using cage pollination with bumblebees or using open
   pollination in isolated field. A total of 9,858 F-1 plants were planted
   and based on their phenotypic characteristics 213 were selected as elite
   phenotypes. 99 of them were genetically diverse and 5 of them were
   selected as super elite. Selected plants were analysed by the same SSR
   markers and the paternal origin of selected F-1 plants was determined.
   Out of 213 selected elite plants 48 were reciprocals thus exhibiting
   power of selection based on single plant. We demonstrate that this new
   approach to hybrid development is efficient in white cabbage and we
   propose breeders to test it in various vegetable and crop species.
   Moreover, some other aspects of the proposed technique need to be tested
   and verified both for practical and economic criteria.}},

Title = {{Flower colour segregation and flower discrimination under the bee vision
   model in the polymorphic Lysimachia arvensis}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Floral colour determines pollinator behaviour, strongly affecting
   plant-mating systems. Lysimachia arvensis has blue- and red-flowered
   plants and colour inheritance remains largely unknown. A control of
   floral colour based on one locus, with the red allele as dominant, has
   been proposed. This proposal cannot explain the sporadic appearance of
   other floral colours in wild populations. We studied floral colour
   segregation in L. arvensis and assessed the possibility that pollinators
   can visually distinguish colour morphs by using Chittka's hexagon model,
   sigmoidal model of bee discrimination and experimental studies on
   pollinator attendance for two years. Hand crossing between morphs
   originated a homogeneous F1 with salmon-coloured flowers. In the F2,
   blue, red, salmon morphs and other plants with intermediate colours
   appeared, suggesting that more than one single locus are involved in
   colour segregation. Results from the sigmoidal discrimination model
   suggest that blue, red and salmon flowers can be discriminated by
   pollinators. In fact, pollinators showed strong colour constancy and
   discriminated against the salmon morph. Our study shows that ``Flower
   colour{''} is a natural marker to assess the rate of crossing between
   morphs. The extreme rarity of salmon flowers in wild populations and
   flower constancy of L. arvensis pollinators indicates assortative
   mating.}},

   bees (Bombus spp., Hymenoptera: Apidae) in Southwestern Ontario, Canada}},
Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Abstract = {{Bumble bees are declining globally, largely due to habitat loss driven
   by agricultural intensification. Within agriculturally dominated
   landscapes, semi-natural habitats (e.g. meadows, wetland edges) are
   fragmented, increasing the value of uncropped agricultural field margins
   for providing a source of food, nesting, and hibernation resources to
   bumble bees. We compared bumble bee communities sampled in agricultural
   field margins and semi-natural habitats across Southwestern Ontario,
   Canada in order to assess differences in habitat quality. We then
   examined the effect of floral resources and soil characteristics on the
   bumble bee communities present in each site, independent of the habitat
   type classification. Our data revealed that bumble bee abundance,
   diversity, and community composition did not differ between habitat
   types. However, when examined independently of habitat type, bumble bee
   abundance and diversity increased with floral abundance, floral
   diversity, the number of rodent holes, and sandy soil texture. These
   results suggest that agricultural field margins are not inherently
   degraded bumble bee habitat and have the potential to provide food and
   nesting resources comparable to semi-natural habitats in a fragmented
   agricultural landscape. Ensuring field margins contain the necessary
   floral resources and soil characteristics for bumble bees has
   implications for conservation and mitigating habitat loss caused by the

   a consequence of co-evolution. Yet when plants and pollinators
   co-evolve, it is not clear if this will also result in frequent
   cospeciation. Here, we investigate the mutual evolutionary history of
   South African oil-collecting Rediviva bees and their Diascia host
   plants, in which the elongated forelegs of female Rediviva have been
   suggested to coevolve with the oil-producing spurs of their Diascia
   hosts. After controlling for phylogenetic nonindependence, we found
   Rediviva foreleg length to be significantly correlated with Diascia spur
   length, suggestive of co-evolution. However, as trait correlation could
   also be due to pollinator shifts, we tested if cospeciation or
   pollinator shifts have dominated the evolution of Rediviva-Diascia
   interactions by analysing phylogenies in a cophylogenetic framework.
   Distance-based cophylogenetic analyses (PARAFIT, PACo) indicated
   significant congruence of the two phylogenies under most conditions.
   Yet, we found that phylogenetic relatedness was correlated with
   ecological similarity (the spectrum of partners that each taxon
   interacted with) only for Diascia but not for Rediviva, suggesting that
   phylogenetic congruence might be due to phylogenetic tracking by Diascia
   of Rediviva rather than strict (reciprocal) co-evolution. Furthermore,
   event-based reconciliation using a parsimony approach (CORE-PA) on
   average revealed only 11-13 cospeciation events but 58-80 pollinator
   shifts. Probabilistic cophylogenetic analyses (COALA) supported this
   trend (8-29 cospeciations vs. 40 pollinator shifts). Our study suggests
   that diversification of Diascia has been largely driven by Rediviva
   (phylogenetic tracking, pollinator shifts) but not vice versa. Moreover,
   our data suggest that, even in co-evolving mutualisms, cospeciation
   events might occur only infrequently.}},

Abstract = {{The status of pollinating insects is of international concern, but
   knowledge of the magnitude and extent of declines is limited by a lack
   of systematic monitoring. Standardized protocols are urgently needed,
   alongside a better understanding of how different methods and recorders
   (data collectors) influence estimates of pollinator abundance and
   diversity. We compared two common methods for sampling wild pollinating
   insects (solitary bees, bumblebees and hoverflies), pan traps and
   transects, in surveys of 1 km countryside squares (agricultural and
   semi-natural habitats) and flowering crop fields across Great Britain,
   including the influence of local floral resources (nectar sugar
   availability or crop flower density) on the insects sampled. Further, we
   compared the performance of recorders with differing expertise
   (non-specialist research staff, taxonomic experts and non-expert
   volunteers) in applying methods. Pan traps and transects produced
   compositionally distinct samples of pollinator communities. In the wider
   countryside, pan traps sampled more species of solitary bee and
   hoverfly. In flowering crops, transects recorded a greater number of
   individual bumblebees, but fewer species. Across all taxonomic groups
   and countryside and crop samples, transects generally had lower rates of
   species accumulation per individual collected than pan traps. This
   demonstrates that differences between methods in estimating richness are
   not due to sampling effort alone. However, recorders possessing greater
   taxonomic expertise can produce species accumulation data from transects
   that are almost commensurate with pan trapping. The abundance and
   species richness of pollinators (except solitary bees) on transects in
   the wider countryside was positively related to the availability of
   estimated nectar sugar. In crops, pollinator abundance responses to
   flower densities were idiosyncratic according to crop type, but overall
   the response was positive and negative for transects and pan traps,
   respectively. Given these taxonomic and context-specific differences in
   method performance, we assess their suitability for monitoring
   pollinating insect communities and pollination services. We discuss the
   relevance of these findings within the context of achieving
   standardized, large-scale monitoring of pollinating insects.}},

Abstract = {{Solitary bees build their nests by modifying the interior of natural

   metabarcoding of the ITS2 rDNA and the 16S rDNA to simultaneously
   characterize the pollen composition and the bacterial communities of 100
   solitary bee nest chambers belonging to seven megachilid species. We
   found a weak correlation between bacterial and pollen alpha diversity
   and significant associations between the composition of pollen and that
   of the nest microbiota, contributing to the understanding of the link
   between foraging and bacteria acquisition for solitary bees. Since
   solitary bees cannot establish bacterial transmission routes through
   eusociality, this link could be essential for obtaining bacterial

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{281}},
Pages = {{124-133}},

Abstract = {{Both wild and managed pollinators significantly contribute to global
   food production by providing pollination services to crops. Colonies of
   commercially-reared honey bees and bumblebees are two of the largest
   groups of managed pollinators. Bumblebees in particular are increasingly
   used on soft fruit crops, such as strawberry, an economically important
   crop globally. Despite the use of commercial bumblebees in strawberry
   crops, there is little quantitative evidence that they provide a benefit
   to farmers. Given the negative impacts that commercial colonies can have
   on wild bee populations, it is vital that the benefits of commercial
   bumblebees are quantified, so reasoned management decisions can be made
   that provide maximum benefit to both farmers and wild bees. In this
   study, commercial colonies of the UK native subspecies Bombus terrestris
   audax were placed into June-bearer (flowering March-April, varieties
   `Malling Centenary' and `Flair') and everbearer (flowering May-June)
   strawberry polytunnels on a soft-fruit farm in the south east of
   England, and opened and closed at weekly intervals. The flower-visiting
   assemblage inside polytunnels was quantified, and fruit was harvested
   and quality assessed. In the June-bearer variety Malling Centenary, the
   presence of commercial bumblebees increased the amount of high
   commercial grade fruit by 25\%. In contrast, no benefit of commercial
   bees on pollination or fruit quality was observed in the June-bearer
   variety Flair and the everbearer crop. The increase in quality of fruit
   in the Malling Centenary crop may be driven by the higher B. terrestris
   audax flower visitation rates seen in this crop in combination with
   varietal differences in pollination dependency. The number of flower
   visits by wild pollinators was not a well-supported predictor of
   strawberry quality, thus the benefit they provide in this system remains
   to be elucidated. The results presented here suggest that commercial
   bumblebees can greatly increase the quality and subsequent value of a
   strawberry crop, when deployed on a suitable variety at a time when wild
   pollinator numbers are low. However, the results also raise the
   possibility that commercial colonies do not always provide the benefits
   to strawberry crops that they are thought to. For growers to make
   informed decisions on commercial bumblebee use, further research is
   required into the effect of commercial bumblebees on the major
   strawberry varieties, in different locations and seasons. This study is
   an important step in gaining this understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees provide important pollination services for crops and wild

   wild bee diversity across agricultural landscapes, the creation of
   semi-natural habitats has been proposed as a counter-measure. However,
   the relative value of semi-natural and natural habitats in promoting

   world's largest plantation forest area, characterized by intensively
   managed, mono-dominant stands of wind-pollinated tree species. We
   sampled wild bees in apple orchards to assess how their assemblages were
   influenced by semi-natural habitats in the surrounding landscape and the

   isolation from natural shrubland. In contrast, wild bee diversity and

   abundance of large bees, this effect was partly ameliorated by local
   flowering groundcover. Maintaining or restoring wild bee assemblages in

Abstract = {{Drivers of species productivity and ecosystem function are of great
   ecological significance. In fire-prone ecosystems, dispersion patterns
   of important pollinator species are driven by the various fire events
   over space and time. However, different species have varying responses
   to fire intensity and frequency. Here, we assess how time since last
   fire influences abundance, composition, and dispersion patterns of
   flowering plants and anthophiles in a highly fire-prone landscape. We
   classified study area into age since last fire, which were <1 yr
   (short-term burned), 2-3 yr (medium-term burned), and 9-10 yr (long-term
   burned). We collected insect anthophiles using yellow, blue, and white
   pan traps at sites established in each post-fire class. We also
   estimated flower abundance at each study site. Overall, anthophile
   abundance was highest in medium-term burned, while lowest in short-term
   burned sites. Also, flower abundance was highest at medium-term burned
   and lowest in long-term burned sites. Species composition of flowering
   plants and anthophiles, especially bees and flies, differed
   significantly across post-fire class. Overall, flower abundance had a
   significant positive effect on bee abundance. Of all the taxa, bees were
   the only group that showed dispersion patterns reflecting those of
   flower abundance. Other factors, especially requirements for other
   resources such as logs, drive the distribution of other anthophile taxa,
   especially flies. We conclude that fire drives the distribution patterns
   of bees through its direct effect on flower abundance and composition in
   a fire-prone landscape. While high frequency of short-term fire may
   reduce flower abundance, flower-rich areas with moderate time since fire
   may increase diversity of anthophiles in this fire-prone landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are important and widespread insect pollinators who face
   many environmental challenges. For example, bees are exposed to the
   metalloid selenate when foraging on pollen and nectar from plants
   growing in contaminated soils. As it has been shown that the microbiome
   of animals reduces metalloid toxicity, we assayed the ability of the bee
   microbiome to increase survivorship against selenate challenge. We
   exposed uninoculated or microbiota-inoculated Bombus impatiens workers
   to a field-realistic dose of 0.75 mg l(-1) selenate and found that
   microbiota-inoculated bees survive slightly but significantly longer
   than uninoculated bees. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that
   selenate exposure altered gut microbial community composition and
   relative abundance of specific core bacteria. We also grew two core
   bumble bee microbes - Snodgrassella alvi and Lactobacillus bombicola -
   in selenate-spiked media and found that these bacteria grew in the
   tested concentrations of 0.001-10 mg l(-1) selenate. Furthermore, the
   genomes of these microbes harbour genes involved in selenate
   detoxification. The bumble bee microbiome slightly increases
   survivorship when the host is exposed to selenate, but the specific

Abstract = {{Large-scale spatial variability in plant-pollinator communities (e.g.
   along geographic gradients, across different landscapes) is relatively
   well understood. However, we know much less about how these communities
   vary at small scales within a uniform landscape. Plants are sessile and
   highly sensitive to microhabitat conditions, whereas pollinators are
   highly mobile and, for the most part, display generalist feeding habits.
   Therefore, we expect plants to show greater spatial variability than
   pollinators. We analysed the spatial heterogeneity of a community of
   flowering plants and their pollinators in 40 plots across a 40-km(2)
   area within an uninterrupted Mediterranean scrubland. We recorded 3577
   pollinator visits to 49 plant species. The pollinator community (170
   species) was strongly dominated by honey bees (71.8\% of the visits
   recorded). Flower and pollinator communities showed similar
   beta-diversity, indicating that spatial variability was similar in the
   two groups. We used path analysis to establish the direct and indirect
   effects of flower community distribution and honey bee visitation rate
   (a measure of the use of floral resources by this species) on the
   spatial distribution of the pollinator community. Wild pollinator
   abundance was positively related to flower abundance. Wild pollinator
   visitation rate was negatively related to flower abundance, suggesting
   that floral resources were not limiting. Pollinator and flower richness
   were positively related. Pollinator species composition was weakly
   related to flower species composition, reflecting the generalist nature
   of flower-pollinator interactions and the opportunistic nature of
   pollinator flower choices. Honey bee visitation rate did not affect the
   distribution of the wild pollinator community. Overall, we show that, in
   spite of the apparent physiognomic uniformity, both flowers and
   pollinators display high levels of heterogeneity, resulting in a mosaic
   of idiosyncratic local communities. Our results provide a measure of the
   background of intrinsic heterogeneity within a uniform habitat, with
   potential consequences on low-scale ecosystem function and
   microevolutionary patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Preserving species diversity is critical to ensure ecosystem
   functioning; however, different components of diversity might respond to
   human disturbance in different ways. Similarly, trophic levels might
   have uncoupled responses to the same disturbance, thus ameliorating or
   aggravating the persistence of ecological communities. In this study, we
   analysed how the density, richness and evenness of flowers and
   pollinators respond to four levels of woodland thinning intensity (0,
   30, 50 and 70\% of woodland basal area removed) over 2 years in three
   contrasting sites. We found a mismatch in the response of flowers and
   pollinators to thinning. Flower density and richness had disparate
   responses, depending on the site and year, while evenness did not change
   with thinning. In contrast, pollinator density and richness, but not
   evenness, consistently increased with thinning among years and sites.
   These results suggest that thinning has a great influence on pollinators
   through changes in abiotic conditions and, perhaps, flower
   attractiveness rather than through small-scale changes in flower density
   and richness. At the site where tree flowers were absent, bee pollinator
   community composition was impoverished, suggesting that trees provide
   important floral resources to pollinators. Our findings indicate that
   disturbance may diminish local plant abundance and richness, but
   pollinator abundance and richness are enhanced after intense thinning at
   small scales.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging bees expend considerable time and energy handling flowers that
   are morphologically complex (with concealed food rewards) while simple
   flowers (with readily available rewards) bloom simultaneously in their
   foraging environment. Previous studies have investigated the
   consequences of floral morphology for both foragers and plants, often
   treating `complex' and `simple' morphologies as dichotomous traits. How
   pollinators' foraging choices and success vary along a floral complexity
   gradient has received less attention. Here we investigated, using real
   flowers of increasing morphological complexity, how complex flowers are
   chosen and handled by naive and experienced bumblebees when presented
   along with simple ones. Intact flowers of Tecoma x `Orange Jubilee'
   (Bignoniaceae), Antirrhinum majus (Plantaginaceae) and Lupinus pilosus
   (Fabaceae) represented a gradient of increasing morphological
   complexity. We manipulated some flowers of each species to look simple
   with a readily accessible food reward, while keeping their colour and
   odour unchanged. Bombus terrestris workers were given four simple and
   four complex flowers of a single species with equal rewards in choice
   assays in a flight room. Sixty per cent of naive foragers chose a
   complex flower on their first visit to all three flower species arrays.
   Experienced bees visited complex flower types of all three species but
   had lower feeding success and longer handling times on the more complex
   species. Thus, the bees' foraging efficiency on the complex option
   decreased with increasing complexity of the flowers, while individual
   variation in feeding success on the complex option was increased. These
   results suggest that inexperienced foragers and unsuccessful feeding
   attempts increasingly contribute to floral pollination along the
   morphological complexity gradient. (C) 2019 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions vary along a specialization-generalization
   continuum. Advances in understanding the evolutionary and ecological
   consequences of different degrees of specialization depend on precise
   data on plant-pollinator interdependency. We studied the association of
   Parodia neohorstii (Cactaceae) and its bee pollinators focusing on
   pollinator foraging behaviour, flower functioning, female and male
   reproductive success, and pollen fate. Parodia neohorstii showed
   synchronized flower opening and pollen presentation but discontinuous
   blooming. The apparently generalized flowers partition pollen through
   thigmonastic stamen movements that function as a mechanical filter
   against generalist bees by restricting access to the major pollen
   reservoir to bees that show flower handling know-how', thereby favouring
   the oligolectic bee Arhysosage cactorum. This pollinator adjusted its
   pollen foraging to flower opening, removed pollen hurriedly, and
   promoted maximal fruit and seed set, which was minimal in its absence.
   Estimates of pollen fate revealed that a huge amount of pollen flows to
   specialized pollinators (86.5\%), and only 0.9\% reaches conspecific
   stigmas. The specialized interaction between P. neohorstii and
   Arhysosage cactorum, both threatened species, is efficient but fragile.

Abstract = {{Impacts of neonicotinoid-containing pesticides on pollinators have been
   heavily debated in recent years. While bees in the field get rarely
   exposed to lethal concentrations of neonicotinoids applied as seed
   coating, sublethal levels found in pollen and nectar may affect bee
   population development. We assessed a realistic and a worst-case
   scenario of clothianidin exposure to mason bees (Osmia bicornis) and
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) by conducting a small-scale field and
   semi-field experiment at sites planted with winter oilseed rape. Flight
   activity, mortality and population development (brood, colony strength
   and weight) of bumblebees and number of mason bee brood cells were
   assessed at three locations. We also analysed clothianidin residues in
   bee-collected pollen and nectar. We detected clothianidin at low
   concentrations in nectar and pollen; residues in pollen were higher than
   in nectar but did not exceed a maximum field concentration of 2.7 mu
   g/kg for bumblebees and 4.7 mu g/kg for mason bees. Exposure did not
   result in significant negative impacts on bumblebee colony development
   and potential reproductive success of mason bees in either semi-field or
   field setup. During exposure bumblebees in semi-field treatment tunnels
   were flying less actively than in control tunnels. Bumblebee colonies in
   treatment tunnels weighed more than control colonies at the end of the
   experiment. Our findings suggest that field-realistic exposure to
   oilseed rape grown from clothianidin-treated seeds (10 g clothianidin/kg
   seeds) poses little risks to mason bees, bumblebees and their population
   development. However, an impairment of flower visitation under a

Abstract = {{Population declines have been documented in approximately one-third of
   bumble bee species. Certain drivers of these declines are known;
   however, less is known about the interspecific trait differences that
   make certain species more susceptible to decline. Two traits that have
   implications for responding to rapidly changed environments may be
   particularly consequential for bumble bee populations: intraspecific
   body size variation and brain size. Bumble bee body size is highly
   variable and is likely adaptive at the colony level, and brain size
   correlates with cognitive traits (e.g., behavioral plasticity) in many
   groups. Trait variation and plasticity may buffer species against
   negative effects of rapidly changed environments. Using phylogenetically
   controlled analyses of 31 North American bumble bee species, we find
   that higher intraspecific body size variation is associated with species
   having increased their relative abundance over time. However, this
   variation does not significantly interact with tongue length, another
   trait thought to influence bees' decline susceptibility. Head size, a
   proxy for brain size, is not correlated with change in relative
   abundance. Our results support the hypothesis that variation in body
   size makes species less susceptible to decline in rapidly altered

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction in Angiosperms mostly depends on pollen transfer
   mediated by an agent. In plants pollinated by biotic agents,
   reproductive success and population structure are mainly determined by
   pollinator behavior. To further comprehend this aspect of the
   reproductive process, data regarding pollen transport and deposition
   patterns need to be gathered and analyzed. The aim of this study was to
   examine pollen flow dynamics in a population of the Xylocopa
   bee-pollinated Passiflora caerulea using fluorescent powdered dyes as
   pollen mimics and to analyze the relationship between inter-plant
   distance and fruit production. Plant arrangement, number of flowers per
   plant, pollen flow and fruit set exhibited leptokurtic distributions as
   a function of the distance between plants. Minimum and maximum dispersal
   distances were 4 m and 257 m, respectively. Geitonogamous transfers were
   more frequent than xenogamous ones. Pollinator movements, evidenced by
   pollen analogues transferences, responded to plant arrangement. Centris
   sp. was recorded for the first time as a pollinator of Passiflora
   caerulea. Fruit set decayed as distance between individuals increased.
   The tools employed allowed to better understand the dependence between

Abstract = {{Pollinators are experiencing declines globally, negatively affecting the
   reproduction of wild plants and crop production. Well-known drivers of
   these declines include climatic and nutritional stresses, such as a
   change of dietary resources due to the degradation of habitat quality.
   Understanding potential synergies between these two important drivers is
   needed to improve predictive models of the future effects of climate
   change on pollinator declines. Here, bumblebee colony bioassays were
   used to evaluate the interactive effects of heat stress, a reduction of
   dietary resource quality, and colony size. Using a total of 117
   colonies, we applied a fully crossed experiment to test the effect of
   three dietary quality levels under three levels of heat stress with two
   colony sizes. Both nutritional and heat stress reduced colony
   development resulting in a lower investment in offspring production.
   Small colonies were much more sensitive to heat and nutritional stresses
   than large ones, possibly because a higher percentage of workers helps
   maintain social homeostasis. Strikingly, the effects of heat stress were
   far less pronounced for small colonies fed with suitable diets. Overall,
   our study suggests that landscape management actions that ensure access

Abstract = {{The effects of climate change on solitary bee species, the most diverse
   and abundant group of wild pollinators, remain poorly understood,
   limiting our ability to forecast consequences for bee-plant interactions
   and pollination services. Life history traits, such as overwintering
   life stage, sex, and body size may influence solitary bee responses to
   climate change by mediating the effects of temperature on physiological
   processes spanning fall, winter, and spring. Yet, most studies assessing
   the effects of temperature on solitary bees have focused on managed
   species and have isolated the effects of winter temperature. Here, we
   reared male and female individuals representing eight cavity-nesting
   solitary bee species that overwinter either as adults (i.e., Osmia spp.)
   or prepupae (i.e., Megachile spp.). Eight rearing treatments were used,
   in which we manipulated fall and spring temperature, fall duration, and
   the timing of spring onset. We measured pre-emergence mortality,
   pre-emergence weight loss, emergence timing, and post-emergence
   lifespan. We found that Osmia spp. responded primarily to the timing of
   spring onset, whereas Megachile spp. responded primarily to spring
   temperature. Early-spring onset increased both pre-emergence mortality
   and pre-emergence weight loss and reduced post-emergence lifespan in
   Osmia spp. In addition, treatments caused unequal shifts in the timing
   of emergence between male and female Osmia spp. By contrast, warmer
   spring temperature decreased weight loss, and increased lifespan in
   Megachile spp. These findings suggest that Osmia spp. may be more
   vulnerable to negative fitness consequences of climate change compared
   to Megachile spp., and that climate change may have implications for
   population-level sex-ratios and mating success in species of Osmia. This
   work helps build a mechanistic understanding of how life histories may
   mediate solitary bee responses to climate change, and how these
   responses may impact solitary bee fitness and plant-bee interactions.}},

Title = {{Sex-differential reproduction success and selection on floral traits in
   gynodioecious Salvia pratensis}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gynodioecy, a sexual system with hermaphrodite and female
   individuals in a population, raises the question how the two sexual
   morphs are maintained. Salvia pratensis is a gynodioecious species
   featured by its modified stamens that act as a lever mechanism in
   pollination. Given sexual dimorphism in floral traits of the species, it
   is predictable that two sexual morphs differ in their interplay with
   pollinators and thus in their fitness. In this study, we investigated
   sex-specific reproduction success and floral adaptation in a population
   of S. pratensis.
   Results: We found that two sexual morphs in S. pratensis distinctly
   differed in their floral proportions. Female flowers fitted better to
   the pollinators than hermaphrodites in terms of touching the stigmas
   when being probed, and hence were more efficient in pollen deposition.
   Floral traits overall underwent stronger selection in the population,
   with stigma position and corolla length subject to disruptive selection
   mediated by different body-sized bumble bees; some selections on floral
   traits were significantly different in the strength, even opposite in
   the direction between two morphs. Flower production tended to be under
   correlational selection with floral structural traits, implying that a
   large plant with many flowers did not show an advantage in fitness
   unless its flower construction mechanically matched the pollinators
   well.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the pollinator-mediated selection likely
   played an important role in the evolution and maintenance of sexual
   dimorphism in the gynodioecious S. pratensis; and sex-divergent
   mechanical interaction with pollinators served as a critical mechanism
   by which female individuals were maintained in the population with a
   female advantage in pollen deposition efficiency (i.e. receiving
   pollen).}},

Abstract = {{Continuous availability of food resources, such as pollen, is vital for
   many insects that provide pollination and pest control services to
   agriculture. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the shared or
   complementary use of floral resources by such species, which hampers
   more effective landscape management to simultaneously promote them in
   agroecosystems. Here, we simultaneously quantified pollen use by a
   bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and a mason bee (Osmia bicornis), two bee
   species recognized as important crop pollinators, as well as a lacewing
   (Chrysoperla carnea) and a ladybeetle species (Harmonia axyridis), both
   common predators of crop aphids, throughout the season in 23
   agricultural landscapes in Germany and Switzerland. Pollen diets were
   more diverse and similar among C. carnea and H. axyridis compared to the
   two bee species, but all four species shared key pollen types early in
   the season such as Acer, Quercus, Salix and Prunus. All species
   exhibited a pronounced shift in pollen sources from primarily woody
   plants (mainly trees) in spring to primarily herbaceous plants in
   summer. The majority of pollen (overall >= 64\%) came from
   non-agricultural plants even in crop-dominated landscapes. Synthesis and
   applications. Our results highlight the importance of trees as pollen
   sources for many insect species, particularly early in the season. Our
   findings support incentives that promote heterogeneous agricultural
   landscapes including both woody and herbaceous semi-natural habitats,
   ensuring phenological complementarity of floral resources for insect
   species that can provide pollination and pest control services to

Abstract = {{While the importance of floral odours for pollinator attraction relative
   to visual cues is increasingly appreciated, how they structure
   community-level plant-pollinator interactions is poorly understood.
   Elucidating the functional roles of flowering plant species with respect
   to their floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and how those roles
   vary over the growing season is an initial step towards understanding
   the contribution of floral VOCs to plant-pollinator interaction
   structure. We sampled the floral VOCs, phenologies and bee visitors of
   naturally growing plants in a montane meadow in the Northern Rocky
   Mountains of USA in order to acquire a base understanding of how floral
   VOCs and other plant traits may structure plant-pollinator interactions
   across the growing season. We expected forb species with floral VOCs
   that were original (far from the community mean) and unique (far from
   the nearest neighbour) would have few pollinating partners (i.e.
   specialists), while forbs with non-original or highly variable floral
   VOCs would form the generalist core of interactors, thereby contributing
   to network nestedness (specialists interacting with nested subsets of
   generalists). Network modularity (patterns of distinct, highly connected
   subnetworks) could be influenced by groups of pollinators that are
   attracted to or repelled by certain floral bouquets. Species blooming in
   early spring emitted similar floral VOC blends containing generalist
   attractants, whereas floral VOC complexity was highest in mid to late
   summer. Forb species varied in the originality, uniqueness, and
   intraspecific variation (i.e. dispersion) of their floral VOCs,
   indicating the potential for different functional roles in
   plant-pollinator networks. Specifically, the originality, uniqueness and
   dispersion of forb species' floral VOCs increased across the growing
   season. Floral VOCs influenced forb interactions with pollinators.
   Floral VOCs contributed to the nested structure, but not modular
   structure, of community-level plant-pollinator network structure. Forb
   species with more original floral VOCs were less connected, while forb
   species emitting more compounds and with higher intraspecific variation
   in floral VOCs were more connected to pollinators. These findings show
   that floral scent plays important roles in structuring bee-forb
   interactions and guiding seasonal patterns in complex communities.
   Understanding seasonal patterns in floral VOCs may have important
   implications for plant-pollinator interactions among communities
   differing in species composition, or as shifts occur in suites of
   co-flowering species due to climate change. A free Plain Language
   Summary can be found within the Supporting Information of this article.}},

Abstract = {{Production of many agricultural crops and fruits strongly depends on
   pollinators. For instance, pome fruits such as apple and pear are highly
   dependent on pollination for fruit set, fruit quality, and yield. Nectar
   is often inhabited by microbes, most often yeasts and bacteria, which
   may change nectar quality and therefore also affect plant-pollinator
   interactions. Here, we used high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene
   amplicon sequencing to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in
   bacterial communities in floral nectar of apple and pear. We sampled 15
   apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) and 15 pear (Pyrus communis L.)
   orchards distributed over the eastern part of Belgium over a timespan of
   seven days. Nectar bacterial community composition differed strongly
   among fruit species. Nectar of pear was dominated by Actinobacteria,
   followed by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Apple nectar was strongly
   enriched in Bacteroidetes, a phylum which until now has been found to be
   rarely associated with floral nectar. Nectar was dominated by only a few
   bacterial species, with Brevibacterium (Actinobacteria) and
   Undibacterium (Proteobacteria) as the most abundant bacteria in pear and
   apple nectar, respectively. Bacterial richness and diversity were found
   to fluctuate during flowering, likely due to changing environmental
   conditions. Additionally, spatial structure in nectar bacterial
   community composition was found in apple orchards, while this was not
   the case for pear. Differences in nectar bacterial communities between
   apple and pear nectar may differently affect the chemical and
   nutritional composition of the nectar, influencing pollinator attraction
   and visitation, and thus pollination efficacy in general.}},

Abstract = {{The impact on pollination of supplementing wild pollinators with
   commercially reared Osmia bicornis in commercial orchards growing the
   self-fertile sweet cherry variety ``Stella{''} was investigated in each
   of two years. The quality characteristics used by retailers to determine

   released at recommended commercial rates. No effect of treatment on the
   number of fruit set or subsequent rate of growth was recorded. However,
   supplemented pollination resulted in earlier fruit set when compared to
   pollination by wild pollinators alone and offered the potential benefit
   of a larger proportion of the crop reaching optimum quality within a
   narrower time range, resulting in more consistent produce. Retailers use
   five key quality criteria in assessment of market value of cherries (the
   weight of individual fruit, width at the widest point, fruit colour,
   sugar content and firmness). Price paid to growers depends both on
   meeting the criteria and consistency between fruit in these
   characteristics. In both years, the commercial criteria were met in full
   in both treatments, but harvested fruit following supplemented
   pollination were consistently larger and heavier compared to those from
   the wild pollinator treatment. In the year where supplemented

Abstract = {{Ecotoxicological risks of neonicotinoid insecticides are raising
   significant concerns, including their potential role in bee population
   declines. Neonicotinoids are water-soluble, systemic insecticides, and
   exposure of nontarget organisms such as pollinators occurs mainly
   through residues in nectar and pollens of flowering plants. To better
   elucidate the underlying mechanisms for such nontarget exposure, it is
   highly valuable to develop analytical capabilities for in vivo
   monitoring of neonicotinoids in live plants. In this study, we developed
   a novel biomimetic water-swelling solid-phase microextraction (SPME)
   probe, with limits of detection for neonicotinoids as low as 0.03 ng
   mL(-1), and applied it for in vivo detection of seven neonicotinoids in
   plant sap. The preparation of this fiber was simple and free of
   stringent or complex physical-chemical reactions. Equilibrium in
   neonicotinoid accumulation on the fiber was reached in <10 min, allowing
   for near instantaneous sampling. The water-swelling fiber displayed much
   greater sampling capacity than the commercially available
   polydimethylsiloxane and polyacrylate fibers, good reproducibility (RSD
   of inter- and intrafiber <8.9\% and 7.8\%, respectively), and
   antibiofouling property (no loss in performance after 20 use cycles).
   After treating lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) by foliar spray and soybean
   (Glycine max M.) by seed soaking, the in vivo assays provided a wealth
   of information, including changes in levels and distribution of
   neonicotinoids over time in the same plants. Kinetics and distribution
   patterns suggested that after treatment at the same level,
   neonicotinoids differed significantly in their levels in the sap. The in
   vivo sampling and monitoring of neonicotinoids in live plants may
   provide unique and much needed information in achieving breakthrough
   understanding of the connection between neonicotinoid use and pollinator
   exposure.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Many insects sequester nutrients during developmentally programmed
   periods, which they metabolize during subsequent life history stages.
   During these periods, failure to store adequate nutrients can have
   persistent effects on fitness. Here, we examined a critical but
   under-studied nutrient storage period in queen bumble bees: the first
   days of adult life, which are followed by a diapause period typically
   coinciding with winter. We experimentally manipulated availability of
   pollen (the primary dietary source of lipids and protein) and the sugar
   concentration of artificial nectar (the primary source of carbohydrates)
   for laboratory-reared queens during this period and examined three
   nutritional phenomena: (i) diet impacts on nutritional status, (ii) the
   timescale upon which nutrient sequestration occurs and (iii) the fitness
   consequences of nutrient sequestration, specifically related to survival
   across the life cycle. We found evidence that pollen and nectar
   starvation negatively impact lipid storage, whereas nectar sugar
   concentration impacts stored carbohydrates. The majority of nutrients
   were stored during the first similar to 3 days of adult life. Nutrients
   derived from pollen during this period appear to be more critical for
   surviving earlier life stages, whereas nutrients sequestered from nectar
   become more important for surviving the diapause and post-diapause
   periods. Negative impacts of a poor diet during early life persisted in
   our experiment, even when pollen and a relatively high (50\%) nectar
   sugar concentration were provided post-diapause. Based on these
   findings, we posit that the nutritional environment during the early
   adult life of queens has both immediate and persistent impacts on
   fitness. These findings underscore the importance of examining effects
   of stage-specific nutritional limitations on physiology and life history
   traits in this social insect group. Moreover, the findings may shed
   light on how declining food resources are contributing to the decline of
   wild bumble bee populations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{We present a method for calculating the Acute Insecticide Toxicity
   Loading (AITL) on US agricultural lands and surrounding areas and an
   assessment of the changes in AITL from 1992 through 2014. The AITL
   method accounts for the total mass of insecticides used in the US, acute
   toxicity to insects using honey bee contact and oral LD50 as reference
   values for arthropod toxicity, and the environmental persistence of the
   pesticides. This screening analysis shows that the types of synthetic
   insecticides applied to agricultural lands have fundamentally shifted
   over the last two decades from predominantly organophosphorus and
   N-methyl carbamate pesticides to a mix dominated by neonicotinoids and
   pyrethroids. The neonicotinoids are generally applied to US agricultural
   land at lower application rates per acre; however, they are considerably
   more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment.
   We found a 48- and 4-fold increase in AITL from 1992 to 2014 for oral
   and contact toxicity, respectively. Neonicotinoids are primarily
   responsible for this increase, representing between 61 to nearly 99
   percent of the total toxicity loading in 2014. The crops most
   responsible for the increase in AITL are corn and soybeans, with
   particularly large increases in relative soybean contributions to AITL
   between 2010 and 2014. Oral exposures are of potentially greater concern
   because of the relatively higher toxicity (low LD(50)s) and greater
   likelihood of exposure from residues in pollen, nectar, guttation water,
   and other environmental media. Using AITL to assess oral toxicity by
   class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids accounted for nearly 92 percent
   of total AITL from 1992 to 2014. Chlorpyrifos, the fifth most widely
   used insecticide during this time contributed just 1.4 percent of total
   AITL based on oral LD(50)s. Although we use some simplifying
   assumptions, our screening analysis demonstrates an increase in
   pesticide toxicity loading over the past 26 years, which potentially
   threatens the health of honey bees and other pollinators and may
   contribute to declines in beneficial insect populations as well as
   insectivorous birds and other insect consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Supporting pollinators in agricultural landscapes is important for
   reversing their global decline. Road verges and hedges are used by
   pollinators for feeding and reproduction, but few studies consider
   entire pollinator communities, and it remains unclear how they are
   distributed across adjacent verges, hedges and fields, or how they are
   affected by traffic and verge cutting. We surveyed flowers and
   pollinators, using transect counts and pan traps, to explore the role of
   road verges and their associated hedges in supporting pollinators in an
   agricultural landscape in southwest England, and the impacts of traffic
   and verge cutting. At 19 sites, we surveyed the road verge (verge edge
   and verge centre), the verge hedge (both sides), a field hedge and the
   field interior. Road verges and hedges had a much greater flower
   abundance, flower species richness and pollinator abundance than field
   interiors. Verge hedges had far less woody cover than field hedges, but
   greater flower species richness. There were fewer pollinators along
   verge edges (next to roads) than along verge centres (2-11 m from roads)
   and fewer pollinators in road verges next to busier roads. Road verges
   were generally cut once (in summer), and cuttings were never removed.
   There were substantially fewer flowers and pollinators in road verges
   that had been cut, even though surveys often took place many weeks after
   cutting. Synthesis and applications. Road verges and their associated
   hedges can provide hotspots of resources for pollinators in agricultural
   landscapes, but their capacity to do so is reduced by heavy traffic and
   summer verge cutting. We recommend that beneficial management for
   pollinators should prioritize wider road verges (at least 2 m wide),
   roads with less traffic, and areas away from the immediate vicinity of
   the road. Where possible, verge cutting should not be carried out during
   peak flowering times.}},

Abstract = {{A striking characteristic of the Western North American flora is the
   repeated evolution of hummingbird pollination from insect-pollinated
   ancestors. This pattern has received extensive attention as an
   opportunity to study repeated trait evolution as well as potential
   constraints on evolutionary reversibility, with little attention focused
   on the impact of these transitions on species diversification rates. Yet
   traits conferring adaptation to divergent pollinators potentially impact
   speciation and extinction rates, because pollinators facilitate plant
   reproduction and specify mating patterns between flowering plants. Here,
   we examine macroevolutionary processes affecting floral pollination
   syndrome diversity in the largest North American genus of flowering
   plants, Penstemon. Within Penstemon, transitions from ancestral
   bee-adapted flowers to hummingbird-adapted flowers have frequently
   occurred, although hummingbird-adapted species are rare overall within
   the genus. We inferred macroevolutionary transition and state-dependent
   diversification rates and found that transitions from ancestral
   bee-adapted flowers to hummingbird-adapted flowers are associated with
   reduced net diversification rate, a finding based on an estimated 17
   origins of hummingbird pollination in our sample. Although this finding
   is congruent with hypotheses that hummingbird adaptation in North
   American Flora is associated with reduced species diversification rates,
   it contrasts with studies of neotropical plant families where
   hummingbird pollination has been associated with increased species
   diversification. We further used the estimated macroevolutionary rates
   to predict the expected pattern of floral diversity within Penstemon
   over time, assuming stable diversification and transition rates. Under
   these assumptions, we find that hummingbird-adapted species are expected
   to remain rare due to their reduced diversification rates. In fact,
   current floral diversity in the sampled Penstemon lineage, where less
   than one-fifth of species are hummingbird adapted, is consistent with
   predicted levels of diversity under stable macroevolutionary rates.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, there are only five bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Bombus)
   species that have been successfully commercialized for agriculture. The
   Hunt bumble bee, Bombus huntii Green, 1860, has been recognized as a
   suitable pollinator of crops and has a broad distribution in western
   North America, making it a viable candidate for commercialization. In
   this study, our goal was to characterize the foraging dynamics of B.
   huntii female workers under open field conditions. To accomplish this
   goal, we monitored three B. huntii colonies over an 8-wk period in the
   summer of 2012 in northern Utah. Using marked bees, we studied the
   relationship between foraging duration/offloading and pollen/nonvisible
   pollen collection. In total, we observed 921 foraging events across all
   three colonies. Of our observations, 82\% (n = 756) were foraging events
   that included both a departure and arrival time observation. Average
   duration of pollen and nonpollen (i.e., nectar) trips across foragers is
   41.86 +/- 5.65 min (+/- SE) and 32.18 +/- 5.89 min, respectively.
   Workers spent a significantly longer time offloading pollen in the nest
   after a foraging trip relative to workers without pollen present on
   their corbicula. Pollen foraging rate increases over the course of the
   day, likely due to the time it takes to learn how to forage on a diverse
   array of flower morphologies. Our study provides data on how long it
   takes for B. huntii to forage in open field conditions and will be
   useful when comparing foraging rates in controlled crop systems.}},

Abstract = {{Industrialized farming practices result in simplified agricultural
   landscapes, reduced biodiversity, and degraded species-interaction
   networks. Thus far, most research assessing the combined effects of
   farming systems and landscape complexity on beneficial insects has been
   conducted in relatively diversified and mesic systems and may not
   represent the large-scale, monoculture-based dryland agriculture that
   dominates many regions worldwide. Specifically, the effects of farming
   systems on forbs, bees, and their interactions are poorly understood in
   highly simplified dryland landscapes such as those in the Northern Great
   Plains, United States, an area globally important for conventional and
   organic small grain, pulse, forage, and oilseed production. During a
   3-yr (2013-2015) study, we assessed 1) the effects of dryland no-till
   conventional and tilled organic farming on forbs, bees, and bee- flower
   networks and 2) the relationship between natural habitat and bee
   abundance. Flower density and richness were greater in tilled organic
   fields than in no-till conventional fields, and forb community
   composition differed between farming systems. We observed high bee
   diversity (109 taxa) in this highly simplified landscape, and bee
   abundance, richness, and community composition were similar between
   systems. Compared with tilled organic fields, bee-flower interactions in
   no-till conventional fields were poorly connected, suggesting these
   systems maintain relatively impoverished plant-pollinator networks.
   Natural habitat (11\% of the landscape) did not affect small-bodied bee
   abundance in either farming system but positively affected large-bodied
   bees within 2,000 m of crop-field centers. In highly simplified
   agricultural landscapes, dryland organic farming and no-till
   conventional farming together support relatively high bee diversity,
   presumably because dryland organic farming enhances floral resources and
   bee-flower networks, and no-till management in conventional farming
   provides undisturbed ground-nesting habitats for wild bees (Hymenoptera:
   Apoidea).}},

Abstract = {{The native prairie of the southern Great Plains has been especially
   modified by two related forces: conversion of native prairie to
   agricultural forms of land use and removal of black-tailed prairie dogs
   (Rodentia: Sciuridae, Cynomys ludovicianus (Ord, 1815)) that act as
   ecosystem engineers via their burrowing and grazing activities. It is
   unknown how these changes have affected the native bee community. We
   surveyed the bee communities in relatively intact native prairie at two
   National Wildlife Refuges in Texas, quantifying bee community structure
   as a function of the presence/absence of grazing by prairie dogs. Over a
   5-mo sampling period in spring-summer 2013, we found high overall bee
   diversity (180 species, mostly solitary ground-nesters), with
   differences detected in diversity between Muleshoe and Buffalo Lake
   National Wildlife Refuges as well as on and off prairie dog colonies.
   Although the same three species dominated the bee community at both
   refuges, most species were represented by relatively few individuals,
   leading to overall differences in diversity (richness, evenness, and
   effective number of species) by refuge. Bee diversity differed between
   sites on and off prairie dog colonies, but in trends that differed by
   refuge and by index, suggesting that location was more important than
   prairie dog presence.These results represent a reference fauna against
   which other regional bee communities in other land-cover types can be
   compared, but the high spatial heterogeneity we found indicates that
   detecting effects of landscape change on native bees will be
   challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are economically important insects which perform essential
   pollination tasks in natural and managed ecosystems. Recent research
   studying Neotropical bumblebee species in Brazil showed a clear decrease
   in genetic diversity over time in Bombus pauloensis. A new temporal
   assessment of genetic diversity is needed to know whether this was a
   location-specific result, or a more general phenomenon. This knowledge
   is essential to be able to prioritize conservation and management needs.
   Here, the genetic variability of B. pauloensis populations in Argentina
   was investigated over time using museum collection specimens from 1933
   to 2016, and compared with reanalyzed data from Brazilian populations.
   Furthermore, specific time series were made for two Argentinean
   locations, Candelaria and La Plata, and compared with the time series of
   Porto Alegre (Brazil). All collected specimens were genotyped with 16
   microsatellite loci to estimate genetic diversity parameters. Our
   results showed no drop in either allelic richness or expected
   heterozygosity over all Argentinean populations. However, a clear drop
   in genetic diversity was observed in two out of three location-specific
   time series. This loss of diversity will have negative impacts on
   population survival, especially over longer periods of time.
   Furthermore, the use and release of mass-reared specimens of B.
   pauloensis, which may be inbred and specifically selected for certain
   commercial but non-adaptive traits, could further diminish the genetic
   pool. Thus, our result implies the urgent need for regional conservation

Abstract = {{Landscape composition is assumed to modify spatial foraging patterns of

   size and distances to nesting sites were selected from 11 agricultural
   landscapes with independent gradients of surrounding semi-natural
   habitats and nesting resources. Semi-natural habitats and nesting
   resources were quantified either by field inspections or from satellite
   images; flower visitor densities and vetch pollination services were
   measured across overall flowering seasons. The proportion of
   semi-natural habitats did not modify the concentration effect or
   waylaying effect of the abundant and highly social honey bees or the
   solitary species Anthophora waltoni. The increase in area of brick
   walls, acting as nesting resources of A. waltoni, increased the

   the proportion of semi-natural habitats and the proportion of buildings
   did not influence the concentration effect or the waylaying effect.
   Honey bee density, A. waltoni density and other solitary bee density
   positively predict vetch pollination services. The landscape-modified

Abstract = {{Mass-flowering crops such as oilseed rape (Brassica napus) are
   attractive for some pollinators. Consequently, flowering oilseed rape
   fields may compete for pollinators with co-flowering wild plants
   occurring in adjacent non-crop habitats. We evaluated the influence of
   flowering oilseed rape through both its area and its configuration in
   the landscape on pollinator abundance and on the reproductive success of
   a co-flowering wild plant functionally close to oilseed rape in
   surrounding grasslands. We monitored the production of seeds of a
   pollinator-generalist plant, Cardamine pratensis, and sampled pollinator
   communities in 22 permanent grasslands. To understand the landscape
   effect of oilseed rape, we quantified its area and aggregation in the
   landscape at 1 000 m around each grassland. We measured the flower
   abundance in the grasslands and C. pratensis conspecific plant abundance
   to consider local influences. At the landscape scale, C. pratensis seed
   set was unaffected by the aggregation of oilseed rape patches but it was
   reduced by increasing oilseed rape area in the landscape. At the local
   scale, the conspecific plant abundance enhanced seed set (i.e.
   facilitation effect), whereas flower abundance in the grassland reduced
   it (i.e. competition effect). Analyses revealed a significant positive
   correlation between seed set and honeybee abundance, but no correlation
   was found between seed set and solitary bee abundance. Oilseed rape
   aggregation and the area of semi-natural habitats in the landscape had a
   weak negative effect on honeybee abundance. Oilseed rape area had either
   a positive or a negative effect on solitary bee abundance depending on
   oilseed rape aggregation in the landscape. Flowering oilseed rape can
   either enhance or reduce the pollinator abundance and the reproductive
   success of wild plants depending on its quantity and spatial
   arrangement. Guidance for plant and pollinator conservation should
   therefore consider both landscape aspects.}},

Volume = {{280}},

Abstract = {{Coffee is one of the most important tropical crops on earth, considering
   both its gross production value and the number of families that depend
   on it for their livelihoods. Coffee also grows within some of the
   world's most biodiverse habitats, in areas predicted to experience
   severe climate change impacts. Like many other crops, coffee benefits
   from several ecosystem services (ES) that provide important inputs or
   conditions for production. Given coffee's strong interactions with
   conservation, livelihoods, and climate change, it is important to
   understand the roles of biodiversity-regulated ES to coffee and how they
   are likely to change under future climates. Here we review the available
   literature on the provision of two essential and interacting ES that
   regulate coffee production: control of a beetle pest by birds and
   pollination by bees. Studies show that bird and bee communities provide
   pest control and pollination services that improve coffee quantity and
   quality, benefiting coffee farmers whose livelihoods depend on this
   crop. The literature also shows that a variety of plot, farm, and
   landscape management practices that support resources for bees and birds
   can enhance these ES. We also evaluate how these ES and their
   interactions may change under future climate change. Several studies
   have estimated likely climate impacts on coffee per se, but few have
   investigated climate vulnerability of pollination and pest control ES.
   Even less studies have quantified interactions between these ES.
   Although evidence is incomplete, managing coffee farms as diversified
   agroforestry systems could improve climate resilience of coffee cropping
   and communities of birds and bees, and therefore help farming families
   adapt to their changing environment. Based on our review, we identify
   six critical research priorities in this active area of study. Filling
   knowledge gaps would advance our understanding of interactions among
   landscapes, ES, and climate change, and would support climate adaptation
   for the millions of households whose livelihoods depend on coffee.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of pollinator diversity is fundamental to maintaining
   sustainable agricultural systems and food security. Some agricultural
   systems support pollinator diversity, while others may lead to their
   decline. Previous studies have evaluated the impacts of agricultural
   intensification on pollinators in temperate climates regions, but in
   tropical regions these impacts have been evaluated by only very few
   studies. We conducted a study in southeastern Mexico, in order to
   understand the effects of three agricultural systems on bee diversity in
   a tropical landscape. We compared 18 sites at two different scales (plot
   scale and landscape scale). We found a link between agricultural system
   intensity level at the plot scale and forest proportion at the landscape
   scale: land use intensity was low at both scales in 7 polycultures, low
   at plot scale and high at landscape scale in 4 pastures, and high at
   both scales in 7 monocultures. We collected bees at all sites, and found
   an overall high bee richness, with a total of 127 species. Bee richness
   was compared across agricultural systems using diversity accumulation
   curves with iNEXT package. Both polycultures and pastures had
   significantly higher richness as monocultures. We constructed bee
   species guilds according to ecological and life-history traits (i.e.
   size, sociality and nesting) and found that whatever the trait
   considered, the species richness in the different agricultural systems
   was most often affected in the same way than the complete community
   richness. Our results show, for the first time in tropical conditions
   that agricultural systems with low-intensity farming practices and
   forested landscape allow the preservation of a significantly higher
   diversity of bees than agricultural systems with high-intensity farming
   practices and highly deforested landscape. Considering that bee
   diversity is key to maintaining crop productivity, these findings can
   help scientists, policy-makers, and community members design policies
   that support both agricultural production and biodiversity conservation

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The concept of limiting similarity is important in ecology because it
   encapsulates the expectation under niche theory that differences among
   species are fundamental to coexistence. A growing body of research has
   tested for evidence of limiting similarity, but only a small number of
   studies have produced support. Here, using relevant field data, we
   highlight one possible explanation for the paucity of support for
   limiting similarity. We test whether coexisting plant species that share
   bees as pollinators flower asynchronously, a form of temporal niche
   separation consistent with limiting similarity. Our results provide
   evidence of limiting similarity, adding to the small collection of null
   modeling studies that have thus far done so. Our work also provides
   evidence that temporal niche variation may be an important niche axis
   that broadly contributes to species coexistence. Finally, we demonstrate
   that a more conservative assessment of coexistence that includes only
   individual plants that have achieved reproduction, is consequential in
   whether we find evidence of significant flowering asynchrony in this
   study. We conclude that the conservative approach to assessing
   coexistence that we present here can reduce noise in coexistence data,
   improving our power to test for evidence consistent with limiting
   similarity. Using this approach may or may not result in an increase in
   evidence supporting limiting similarity; however, it will certainly give
   researchers more confidence that they have not missed existing evidence
   of limiting similarity.}},

   diversity, composition) and pollination services (visitation frequency).
   We collected 729 bees representing 19 genera and 57 species. We found
   that bee community composition was strongly associated with percent
   impervious surface. Bee abundance declined with increased canopy cover
   and impervious surface, while declines in bee diversity with increasing
   impervious surface were greatly reduced by increases in floral
   resources. Visitation rates were positively correlated with bee
   abundance and diversity, declining with increased impervious surface,
   but increasing with floral resource availability. These results suggest
   that increasing floral resources at high impervious sites may counteract
   the negative effects of impervious surface on bee diversity and
   pollination services in cities similar to Toledo, OH.}},

Abstract = {{Non-native plant species reliant on insect pollination must attract
   novel pollinators in their introduced habitat to reproduce. Indeed,
   pollination services provided by resident floral visitors may contribute
   to the spread of non-native species, which may then affect the
   pollination services received by native plants. To determine the
   mechanisms by which an invasive thistle attracts pollinators in its
   introduced range, and whether its presence changes the pollinator
   visitation to native plant species, we compared bee visitation to native
   plants in the presence or absence of the invader. We experimentally
   tested the effect of a thistle invasion into a native plant community.
   We found that the non-native thistle was the most attractive of the
   plant species to visiting bee species. However, there was no effect of
   experimental treatment (presence of thistle) on bee abundance or
   visitation rate (bees per unit floral area per sample) to native plant
   species. Across 68 bee and 6 plant species, we found a significant
   correlation between pollen protein content and bee abundance and
   visitation rate. Thistle pollen also had a similar protein:lipid ratio
   to legumes, which correlated with bumble bee visitation. The high
   protein content of the thistle pollen, as compared to four native
   asters, may allow it to attract pollinators in novel ecosystems, and
   potentially contribute to its success as an invader. At the same time,
   this high protein pollen may act as a novel resource to pollinators in
   the thistle's invaded range.}},

Abstract = {{Premise Genetically diverse sibships are thought to increase parental
   fitness through a reduction in the intensity of sib competition, and
   through increased opportunities for seedling establishment in spatially
   or temporally heterogeneous environments. Nearly all research on mate
   diversity in flowering plants has focused on the number of fathers
   siring seeds within a fruit or on a maternal plant. Yet as
   hermaphrodites, plants can also accrue mate diversity by siring
   offspring on several pollen recipients in a population. Here we explore
   whether mate composition overlaps between the dual sex functions, and
   discuss the implications for plant reproductive success. Methods We
   established an experimental population of 49 Mimulus ringens
   (monkeyflower) plants, each trimmed to a single flower. Following
   pollination by wild bees, we quantified mate composition for each flower
   through both paternal and maternal function. Parentage was successfully
   assigned to 240 progeny, 98\% of the sampled seeds. Results Comparison
   of mate composition between male and female function revealed high mate
   diversity, with almost no outcross mates shared between the two sexual
   functions of the same flower. Conclusions Dual sex roles contribute to a
   near doubling of mate diversity in our experimental population of
   Mimulus ringens. This finding may help explain the maintenance of
   hermaphroditism under conditions that would otherwise favor the
   evolution of separate sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen collection is necessary for bee survival and important for
   flowering plant reproduction, yet if and how pollen extraction motor
   routines are modified with experience is largely unknown. Here, we used
   an automated reward and monitoring system to evaluate modification in a
   common pollen-extraction routine, floral sonication. Through a series of
   laboratory experiments with the bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, we examined
   whether variation in sonication frequency and acceleration is due to
   instrumental learning based on rewards, a fixed behavioral response to
   rewards, and/or a mechanical constraint. We first investigated whether
   bees could learn to adjust their sonication frequency in response to
   pollen rewards given only for specified frequency ranges and found no
   evidence of instrumental learning. However, we found that absence versus
   receipt of a pollen reward did lead to a predictable behavioral
   response, which depended on bee size. Finally, we found some evidence of
   mechanical constraints, in that flower mass affected sonication
   acceleration (but not frequency) through an interaction with bee size.
   In general, larger bees showed more flexibility in sonication frequency
   and acceleration, potentially reflecting a size-based constraint on the
   range over which smaller bees can modify frequency and acceleration.
   Overall, our results show that although bees did not display
   instrumental learning of sonication frequency, their sonication motor
   routine is nevertheless flexible.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators use multiple cues whilst foraging including direct cues from
   flowers and indirect cues from other pollinators. The use of indirect
   social cues is common in social insects, such as honeybees and
   bumblebees, where a social environment facilitates the ability to use
   such cues. Bumblebees use cues to forage on flowers according to
   previous foraging experiences. Flowers are an essential food source for
   pollinators but also pose a high risk of parasite infection through the
   shared use of flowers leading to parasite spillover. Nevertheless,
   bumblebees have evolved behavioral defense mechanisms to limit parasite
   infection by avoiding contaminated flowers. Mechanisms underlying the
   avoidance of contaminated flowers by bumblebees are poorly understood.
   Bumblebees were recorded having the choice to forage on non-contaminated
   flowers and flowers contaminated by a trypan osome gut parasite,
   Crithidia bombi. The use of different treatments with presence or
   absence of conspecifics on both contaminated and non-contaminated
   flowers allowed to investigate the role of social visual cues on their
   pathogen avoidance behavior. Bumblebees are expected to use social
   visual cues to avoid contaminated flowers. Our study reveals that the
   presence of a conspecific on flowers either contaminated or not does not
   help bumblebee foragers avoiding contaminated flowers. Nevertheless,
   bumblebees whereas gaining experience tend to avoid their conspecific
   when placed on contaminated flower and copy it when on the
   non-contaminated flower. Our experiment suggests a detrimental impact of
   floral scent on disease avoidance behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Angle dependent colors, such as iridescence, are produced by structures

   interpretations of how to classify these colors either as a signal or a
   cue when considering the natural conditions under which pollination
   occurs. We sampled flowers from 6 plant species across various
   viewpoints looking for changes in the visual appearance of the petals.
   Spectral characteristics were measured with different instruments to
   simulate both the spectral and spatial characteristics of honeybee's

   however, the appearance of the angle dependent color patches
   significantly varies with viewpoint and would only be resolved by the

   revealed that pollinators did not use angle dependent colors to drive
   behavior when presented with novel flower presentations. Results show
   that angle dependent colors do not comply with the requirements of a

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in flies as potentially important

   4 spectral classes of photoreceptors that contribute to the perception
   of color. Our current understanding of how color signals are perceived
   by flies is based on data for the blowfly Lucilia sp., which after being
   conditioned to rewarded monochromatic light stimuli, showed evidence of
   a categorical color visual system. The resulting opponent fly color
   space has 4 distinct categories, and has been used to interpret how some
   fly pollinators may perceive flower colors. However, formal proof that
   flower flies (Syrphidae) only use a simple, categorical color process
   remains outstanding. In free-flying experiments, we tested the hoverfly
   Eristalis tenax, a Batesian mimic of the honeybee, that receives its
   nutrition by visiting flowers. Using a range of broadband
   similar-dissimilar color stimuli previously used to test color
   perception in pollinating hymenopteran species, we evaluated if there
   are steep changes in behavioral choices with continuously increasing
   color differences as might be expected by categorical color processing.
   Our data revealed that color choices by the hoverfly are mediated by a
   continuous monotonic function. Thus, these flies did not use a
   categorical processing, but showed evidence of a color discrimination
   function similar to that observed in several bee species. We therefore

Abstract = {{Covariation among traits can modify the evolutionary trajectory of
   complex structures. This process is thought to operate at a
   microevolutionary scale, but its long-term effects remain controversial
   because trait covariation can itself evolve. Flower morphology, and
   particularly floral trait (co)variation, has been envisioned as the
   product of pollinator-mediated selection. Available evidence suggests
   that major changes in pollinator assemblages may affect the joint
   expression of floral traits and their phenotypic integration. We expect
   species within a monophyletic lineage sharing the same pollinator type
   will show not only similarity in trait means but also similar phenotypic
   variance-covariance structures. Here, we tested this expectation using
   eighteen Salvia species pollinated either by bees or by hummingbirds.
   Our findings indicated a nonsignificant multivariate phylogenetic signal
   and a decoupling between means and variance-covariance phenotypic
   matrices of floral traits during the evolution to hummingbird
   pollination. Mean trait value analyses revealed significant differences
   between bee- and hummingbird-pollinated Salvia species although fewer
   differences were detected in the covariance structure between groups.
   Variance-covariance matrices were much more similar among bee- than
   hummingbird-pollinated species. This pattern is consistent with the
   expectation that, unlike hummingbirds, bees physically manipulate the
   flower, presumably exerting stronger selection pressures favouring
   morphological convergence among species. Overall, we conclude that the
   evolution of hummingbird pollination proceeded through different
   independent transitions. Thus, although the evolution of hummingbird
   pollination led to a new phenotypic optimum, the process involved the
   diversification of the covariance structure.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional farming has been implicated in global biodiversity and
   pollinator declines and organic farming is often regarded as a more
   ecological alternative. However, the effects of organic farming on
   honeybees remain elusive, despite honeybees' importance as pollinators
   of crops and wild plants. Using 6 years of data from a large-scale study
   with fortnightly measurements of honeybee colony performance traits (10
   apiaries per year distributed across a 435 km(2)-large research site in
   France), we related worker brood area, number of adult bees and honey
   reserves to the proportions of organic farmland in the surroundings of
   the hives at two spatial scales (300 m and 1,500 m). We found evidence
   that, at the local scale, organic farming increased both worker brood
   production and number of adult bees in the period of flower scarcity
   between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower (hereafter `dearth
   period'). At the landscape scale, organic farming increased honey
   reserves during the dearth period and at the beginning of the sunflower
   bloom. The results suggest that worker brood development benefitted from
   organic farming mostly through a more diverse diet due to an increase in
   the availability of diverse pollen sources in close proximity of their
   hives. Reduced pesticide drift may have additionally improved bee
   survival. Honey reserves were possibly mostly affected by increased
   availability of melliferous flowers in foraging distance. Synthesis and
   applications. Organic farming increases honeybee colony performance in a
   period of resource scarcity, likely through a continuous supply of
   floral resources including weeds, cover crops and semi-natural elements.
   We demonstrate how worker brood area increases in the critical dearth
   period (between the blooms of oilseed rape and sunflower). This has
   previously been linked to winter colony survival, suggesting that
   organic farmland may mitigate repercussions of intensive farming on
   colony vitality. We conclude that organic farming benefits a crucial

Abstract = {{Trade-offs are considered a major factor in the evolution of ecological
   specialization, as organisms can rarely specialize on more than one
   niche. Here we ask whether flowers can be specialized for more than one
   pollinator group. We studied an outcrossing plant, Aloe kraussii
   (Asphodelaceae), whose floral morphology is intermediate between that of
   exclusively bird-and exclusively insect-pollinated aloes. Previous field
   experiments showed that bees effectively pollinate A. kraussii; while
   sunbirds are frequent visitors their effectiveness as pollinators was
   unknown, especially as their long bills prevent head feathers-the normal
   location of pollen transfer by birds-from touching A. kraussii's
   relatively short anthers and stigmas. We tested whether sunbirds can
   pollinate A. kraussii, and whether this might be facilitated by flowers'
   narrow corolla opening, which could increase pollen transfer via narrow
   sunbird bills. Aviary experiments showed that a Malachite sunbird's bill
   can successfully pick up and deposit A. kraussii pollen, so long-billed
   sunbirds can be effective pollinators despite the apparent mismatch
   between bill and corolla length. Flowers with experimentally widened
   corolla openings experienced lower pollen removal and deposition by
   sunbirds than unmanipulated flowers with narrow openings. Aloe
   kraussii's floral morphology therefore enables dual specialization on
   two divergent pollinator guilds; short corollas facilitate bee
   pollination by enabling access to nectar, while narrow corolla openings
   facilitate pollen transfer via sunbird bills. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published

Abstract = {{Morphological and allozyme analyses suggested the occurrence of a
   pseudocryptic species in the Lasioglossum villosulum (Kirby, 1802)
   species complex (Hymenoptera: Halictidae). We analysed the morphology of
   more than 1500 specimens and the DNA barcode fragment of the cytochrome
   c oxidase subunit I (COI) of 102 specimens of this species complex from
   several Palaearctic countries. Our phylogenetic tree reconstructions,
   based on maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference revealed one Glade
   corresponding to all specimens morphologically identified as
   Lasioglossum medinai (Vachal, 1895) and one divergent specimen
   morphologically identified as Lasioglossum berberum (Benoist, 1941). The
   other specimens, morphologically identified as L. villosulum, aggregated
   into at least three other lineages in our phylogenetic trees. The
   tree-based species delineations methods based on the Generalized Mixed
   Yule Coalescent (GMYC) model and the Bayesian Poisson Tree Process
   (bPTP) identified five to ten candidate species within the L. villosulum
   species complex, with L. medinai and L. berberum consistently recognized
   as separated from all other candidate species. Diagnostic morphological
   differences were found among L. medinai, L. berberum and the remaining
   specimens identified as L. villosulum. No diagnostic morphological
   differences were found to distinguish the different phylogenetic
   candidate species or lineages found within L. villosulum and L. medinai.
   Thus, both genetic and morphological approaches support the existence of
   L. medinai and L. berberum as distinct species from L. villosulum.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-mediated selection is expected to constrain floral color
   variation within plant populations, yet populations with high color
   variation (at least in human visual space) are common in nature. To
   explore this paradox, we collected floral reflectance spectra for 34
   populations of 14 putatively bee-pollinated plant species of
   north-central New Mexico, USA, and translated them into three different
   animal visual spaces. We asked, (1) is intrapopulation variation in
   flower color constrained to be lower than the discrimination threshold
   of the putative dominant pollinators? And, (2) is perceived
   intrapopulation variation in flowers higher for non-pollinating animals
   than it is for the presumed dominant pollinator group? We found evidence
   consistent with some pollinator-imposed constraints on floral color in
   our species, with the majority (70.6\%) of populations having>95\% of
   flower-flower or flower-centroid comparisons (where the centroid
   represents the mean phenotype) estimated to be visually indiscriminable
   to bees. We also found that perceived floral color variation was
   significantly greater for two non-pollinating groups-birds and
   humans-than for bees. Our results suggest that a large portion of
   human-perceived floral color variation within populations persists
   because it is effectively invisible to pollinators. In this scenario,
   human-perceived color may evolve neutrally (via drift) or via indirect
   selection on correlated characters such as herbivore- or

Abstract = {{Managed pollinators such as the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile
   rotundata, are essential to the production of a wide variety of
   agricultural crops. These pollinators encounter a diverse array of
   microbes when foraging for food and nest-building materials on various

   affects the composition of the bee-nest microbiome, we exposed M.
   rotundata adults to treatments that varied both floral and foliar source
   in a 2x2 factorial design. We used 16S rRNA gene and internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing to capture the bacterial and fungal
   diversity of the bee nests. We found that nest microbial communities
   were significantly different between treatments, indicating that bee
   nests become inoculated with environmentally derived microbes. We did
   not find evidence of interactions between the fungi and bacteria within
   our samples. Furthermore, both the bacterial and fungal communities were
   quite diverse and contained numerous exact sequence variants (ESVs) of
   known plant and bee pathogens that differed based on treatment. Our
   research indicates that bees deposit plant-associated microbes into
   their nests, including multiple plant pathogens such as smut fungi and
   bacteria that cause blight and wilt. The presence of plant pathogens in
   larval pollen provisions highlights the potential for bee nests to act

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. It is hypothesised that ecological restoration in grasslands can
   induce an alternative stable state shift in vegetation. The change in
   vegetation influences insect community assemblages and allows for
   greater functional redundancy in pollination and refuge for native
   insect species. 2. Insect community assemblages at eight coastal
   California grassland sites were evaluated. Half of these sites had
   undergone restoration through active revegetation of native grassland
   flora and half were non-restored. Insects were collected from Lupinus
   bicolor (Fabaceae) within 2 x 2-m(2) plots in spring 2017. Lupinus
   bicolor is a common native species that is used in California
   restoration projects, and home and state landscaping projects. 3.
   Ordination demonstrated that insect community assemblages were different
   between restored and non-restored sites. These differences were seen in
   insect functional groups as well as taxa-specific differences and were
   found to be driven by environmental characteristics such as non-native
   forb cover. 4. Functional redundancy of herbivores decreased at restored
   sites, while pollinators became more redundant compared with
   non-restored sites. The assemblages of the common species found at
   restoration sites contained more native insects than those found at
   non-restored sites, including species such as Bombus vosnesenskii. 5.
   Local grassland restoration has the potential to induce an alternative
   stable state change and affect insect community assemblages.
   Additionally, it was found that grassland restoration can be a potential
   conservation tool to provide refugia for bumblebees (Bombus), but
   additional studies are required to fully understand its broader
   applicability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural intensification generally leads to large-scale habitat
   changes marked by decreasing availability of nesting sites and flower
   resources for pollinators. However, little is known about how such
   changes impact wild bee maternal body size and foraging effort and, more
   importantly, whether there is a subsequent effect on their offspring. 2.
   Nests were collected from the common eastern North American stem nesting
   bee, Ceratina calcarata, across three land management types: (i)
   intensely managed conventional farms; (ii) moderately disturbed organic
   farmland; and (iii) least managed roadsides. The study assessed the
   effects of land use types on body size and wing wear (a proxy for
   foraging effort) of maternal bees, and on their offspring in terms of
   clutch size, survival, sex ratio and body size. 3. Findings revealed
   that more brood reached pupal stages from nests collected in
   conventional farmlands. This was due to the total lack of parasites,
   possibly because the host density is below the threshold that can
   support a brood parasite population in intensively farmed landscapes. A
   positive association between maternal bee size and clutch size was only
   found in least managed roadsides, while, in both farm types, body sizes
   for daughters and sons were smaller, barely reaching the predicted
   overwintering threshold. 4. The results suggest that the effects of
   intensified agricultural land use will be more pronounced in bee
   offspring, potentially leading to decreased fitness for subsequent
   generations. This implies far-reaching consequences for agricultural
   pollination services and declines in wild bee populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plants belonging to the genus Passiflora produce exuberant flowers with

   anthocyanins present in the corona filaments of two wild parent species,
   P. incarnate and P. coccinea, that are pollinated by bees and
   hummingbirds, respectively, and their artificial commercial hybrid P.
   `Lady Margaret'. The anthocyanin profiles of the corona filaments were
   characterized by ultra-high performance chromatography with electrospray
   ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
   Monoglucosides of two anthocyanidins (cyanidin and pelargonidin) were
   found in P. coccinea corona filaments, whereas diglucosides of four
   anthocyanidins (cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin and malvidin) were
   identified in P. incarnate corona. The P. `Lady Margaret' hybrid
   contained both mono and diglucosides of the anthocyanidins identified in
   the parent species and also novel anthocyanin molecules not found in the
   parents. The use of UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS was an efficient method to identify
   the anthocyanins present in the corona of Passiflora species. P.
   incarnate acquired its red flowers by suppression of the delphinidin
   pathway. The wide variety of anthocyanins found in the corona filaments
   of the P. `Lady Margaret' interspecific hybrid indicated that it
   inherited the anthocyanidin pathways as well as the glycosylation

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{745-755}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity and ecosystem functions are threatened by human
   disturbance, and tropical forests are one the most vulnerable habitats.
   Monitoring the impacts of disturbance and the success of conservation
   projects is crucial, and to do this effectively it is important to
   identify suitable measures that are sensitive to ecosystem disturbance.
   Orchid bees (Euglossini) are a specialist group with mutualistic
   relationships with many plant species and can fly long distances, making
   them important pollinators of widely dispersed plant species. A loss of
   specialist pollinators such as these could have severe consequences for
   the plants that rely on their services. We therefore aimed to answer the
   following question: are orchid bees useful indicators of the impacts of
   human disturbance? If so, what measures of orchid bee diversity are most
   sensitive? And do orchid bees provide any indication of changes in
   pollination services along a disturbance gradient? Orchid bees were
   collected from 18 sites across a gradient of disturbance in a tropical
   forest region in southeast Peru. Alpha diversity across the gradient was
   compared using Hills numbers. Beta diversity was assessed using
   community composition, species contributions to beta diversity, beta
   diversity partitioning and novel measures of redundancy and
   representativeness. The potential pollination services available at each
   site were measured using artificial flowers and counts of pollinator
   visits. Alpha diversity of orchid bees showed low sensitivity to
   disturbance. Beta diversity measures were more informative, with
   disturbed sites found to be highly redundant in the ecosystem compared
   to the less disturbed sites. However, the most sensitive measure across
   the gradient was abundance - there was a significant decrease in the
   number of bees caught as disturbance increased, with likely consequences
   for pollination services. These results suggest that orchid bees may be
   useful indicators of the impacts of human disturbance, but alpha
   diversity is a poor metric for this purpose. In order to understand how
   human disturbance is affecting biodiversity, multiple diversity indices
   should be considered, and in the case of orchid bees, redundancy and
   abundance could be useful for detecting sensitive responses to forest
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Network analysis is a powerful tool to understand community-level
   plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the role of floral visitors
   on plant fitness through a series of pollination exclusion experiments
   to test the effectiveness of pollinators of an Ipomoea community in the
   Pacific coast of Mexico, including: (1) all flower visitors, (2)
   visitors that contact the reproductive organs, (3) visitors that deposit
   pollen on stigmas, and (4) visitors that mediate fruit and seed
   production. Our results show that networks built from effective
   pollination interactions are smaller, less connected, more specialized
   and modular than floral visitor networks. Modules are associated with
   pollinator functional groups and they provide strong support for
   pollination syndromes only when non-effective interactions are excluded.
   In contrast to other studies, the analyzed networks are not nested. Our
   results also show that only 59\% of floral visitors were legitimate
   pollinators that contribute to seed production. Furthermore, only 27\%
   of the links in visitation network resulted in seed production. Our
   study shows that plant-pollination networks that consider effectiveness
   measures of pollination in addition to floral visitation provide
   insightful information about the different role floral visitors play in

Volume = {{124}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{221-232}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Pollinator-mediated interactions between plant
   species may affect the composition of angiosperm communities. Floral
   colour signals should play a role in these interactions, but the role
   will arise from the visual perceptions and behavioural responses of
   multiple pollinators. Recent advances in the visual sciences can be used
   to inform our understanding of these perceptions and responses. We
   outline the application of appropriate visual principles to the analysis
   of the annual cycle of floral colour structure in two Australian
   herbaceous communities.
   Methods We used spectrographic measurements of petal reflectance to
   determine the location of flowers in a model of hymenopteran colour
   vision. These representations of colour perception were then translated
   to a behaviourally relevant metric of colour differences using
   empirically calibrated colour discrimination functions for four
   hymenopteran species. We then analysed the pattern of colour similarity
   in terms of this metric in samples of co-flowering plants over the
   course of a year. We used the same method to analyse the annual pattern
   of phylogenetic relatedness of co-flowering plants in order to compare
   colour structure and phylogenetic structure.
   Key Results Co-flowering communities at any given date seldom had colour
   assemblages significantly different from random. Non-random structure,
   both dispersion and clustering, occurred occasionally, but depended on
   which bee observer is considered. The degree of colour similarity was
   unrelated to phylogenetic similarity within a co-flowering community.
   Conclusions Perceived floral colour structure varied with the sensory
   capabilities of the observer. The lack of colour structure at most
   sample dates, particularly the rarity of strong dispersion, suggests
   that plants do not use chromatic signals primarily to enable bees to
   discriminate between co-flowering species. It is more likely that
   colours make plants detectable in a complex landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, anthropogenic change is causing biodiversity loss, disrupting
   many critical ecosystem functions. Most studies investigating the
   relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning focus on
   species richness, predominantly within the context of
   productivity-related functions. Consequently, there is limited
   understanding of how other biodiversity measures, such as species
   evenness (the distribution of abundance among species), affect complex
   multitrophic functions such as pollination. We explore the effect of
   species evenness on the ecosystem function of pollination using a
   controlled experiment with selected plants and insects in flight cages.
   We manipulated the relative abundances of plant and pollinator species,
   while holding species richness, composition, dominance order, and total
   abundance constant. Then, we tested how numerical species evenness
   affected network structure and consequently, seed production, in our
   artificial communities. Contrary to our expectation, numerical dominance
   in plant communities increased complementarity in pollinator use
   (reduced pollinator sharing) among plant species. As predicted by
   theory, this increased complementarity resulted in higher seed
   production for the most dominant and rare plant species in our cages.
   Our results show that in a controlled experiential setting, numerical
   species evenness can alter important aspects of plant-pollinator
   networks and plant reproduction, irrespective of species richness,
   composition, and total abundance. Extending this understanding of how
   species evenness affects ecosystem functioning to natural systems is
   crucial as anthropogenic disturbances continue to alter species'
   abundances, likely disrupting ecosystem functions long before
   extinctions occur.}},

Abstract = {{The High Arctic bumble bee fauna is rather poorly known, while a growing
   body of recent molecular research indicates that several Arctic species
   may represent endemic lineages with restricted ranges. Such local
   endemics are in need of special conservation efforts because of the
   increasing anthropogenic pressure and climate changes. Here, we
   re-examine the taxonomic and biogeographic affinities of bumble bees
   from Novaya Zemlya using historical samples and recently collected
   materials (1895-1925 vs. 2015-2017). Three bumble bee species inhabit
   the Yuzhny (Southern) Island and the southern edge of Severny (Northern)
   Island of this archipelago: Bombus glacialis Friese, 1902, B.
   hyperboreus Schonherr, 1809, and B. pyrrhopygus Friese, 1902. Bombus
   glacialis shares three unique COI haplotypes that may indicate its
   long-term (pre-glacial) persistence on Novaya Zemlya. In contrast,
   Bombus hyperboreus and B. pyrrhopygus share a rather low molecular
   divergence from mainland populations, with the same or closely related
   haplotypes as those from Arctic Siberia and Norway. A brief
   re-description of Bombus pyrrhopygus based on the newly collected
   topotypes is presented. Habitats, foraging plants and life cycles of
   bumble bees on Novaya Zemlya are characterized, and possible causes of
   extremely low bumble bee abundance on the archipelago are discussed. The
   species-poor bumble bee fauna of Novaya Zemlya is compared with those in
   other areas throughout the Arctic. The mean bumble bee species richness
   on the Arctic Ocean islands is three times lower than that in the
   mainland Arctic areas (3.1 vs. 8.6 species per local fauna,
   respectively). General linear models (GLMs) indicate that this
   difference can be explained by specific environmental conditions of
   insular areas. Our findings highlight that the insularity is a
   significant factor sharply decreasing species richness in bumble bee
   assemblages on the Arctic Ocean archipelagoes through colder climate
   (lower summer temperatures), prevalence of harsh Arctic tundra
   landscapes with poor foraging resources, and in isolation from the
   mainland.}},

Abstract = {{The negative effects of landscape simplification on bee communities are
   well documented. To reverse these effects, flowering habitat
   enhancements are designed to provide supplemental nutritional resources
   for wild bees and are particularly important when few resources are
   available in the surrounding landscape. Yet, it is not known whether or
   how habitat enhancements support bee populations under varying landscape
   contexts. Body size is a morphological trait that is strongly linked to
   foraging ability, immune function, and fitness in bees. Landscape
   simplification has been associated with size declines across bee taxa
   and smaller body size can be an early indicator of environmental stress.
   To determine whether the negative effects of landscape simplification on
   body size can be improved by adding floral resources to farm landscapes,
   we measured the body size of 10 wild bee species collected at 70 sites
   with or without habitat enhancements in Michigan and New York. Bees were
   collected at sites with varying amounts of agriculture in the
   surrounding landscape, allowing us to test whether morphological
   responses to enhancements are affected by landscape simplification. Half
   of the bee species measured exhibited declining body size across the
   landscape gradient. Among these species, declines were buffered by the
   presence of habitat enhancements suggesting this response is the result
   of improved nutrition, reduced need for long-distance foraging, enhanced
   recruitment of larger individuals or a combination of these mechanisms.
   Declines in body size were strongest in both the smallest and the
   largest species. Large and medium sized species exhibited the greatest
   response to flowering habitat enhancements. Synthesis and applications.
   At sites with high agricultural cover, we observed intraspecific body
   size declines among many species; however, we did not observe decreased
   body size in any species at sites with a flowering habitat enhancement.
   Therefore, our findings suggest that the presence of flowering habitat
   enhancements can support wild bees experiencing stress from intensively
   managed agricultural landscapes across multiple cropping systems and
   regions.}},

   significantly higher than that of concealed pollen (i.e. where anthers
   are enclosed or shielded by corollas). The color contrast between pollen
   and corolla was significantly smaller in species with exposed pollen

Abstract = {{1. The natural history of pollination has been studied for centuries and
   is well documented for diurnal insect species, such as bees and
   butterflies, but less so for moths. There are notable cases of
   pollination systems among moths, but given their enormous diversity and
   primarily nocturnal habits, the role of moths as flower visitors is
   poorly understood. One potential issue with studying moth-pollination
   systems is determining which approach to use in order to acquire data
   and reveal pollination patterns and dynamics. Based on reports from the
   literature and the authors' own research, this paper outlines eight
   approaches that can be employed to search for patterns of flower
   visitation by moths. 2. The outlined approaches include searching the
   internet and online databases, sampling ecosystems, monitoring specific
   flowers, using artificial baits and floral scent lures, using moth
   phylogeny, proboscis morphology, and DNA and environmental DNA
   metabarcoding, which are supplemented with a brief description of the
   techniques and examples for each approach. 3. Each approach has the
   potential to increase researchers' knowledge of associations between
   moths and the flowers that they visit, but their relative strengths and
   limitations are dependent on scope, efficacy of application, technical
   expertise, and level of effort. 4. Each of these approaches, alone or in
   combination, are likely to be useful in the search for novel information
   on the natural history of flower visitation by moths and other potential
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundEssential oils (EOs) of Lavandula angustifolia, mainly consist
   of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids, are of great commercial value.
   The multi-flower spiciform thyrse of lavender not only determines the
   output of EOs but also reflects an environmental adaption strategy. With
   the flower development and blossom in turn, the fluctuation of the
   volatile terpenoids displayed a regular change at each axis. However,
   the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of volatile terpenoids
   during the process of flowering is poorly understood in lavender. Here,
   we combine metabolite and RNA-Seq analyses of flowers of five
   developmental stages at first- and second-axis (FFDSFSA) and initial
   flower bud (FB0) to discover the active terpenoid biosynthesis as well
   as flowering-related genes.ResultsA total of 56 mono- and
   sesquiterpenoids were identified in the EOs of L. angustifolia JX-2'.
   FB0' EO consists of 55 compounds and the two highest compounds,
   beta-trans-ocimene (20.57\%) and (+)-R-limonene (17.00\%), can get rid
   of 74.71 and 78.41\% aphids in Y-tube olfactometer experiments,
   respectively. With sequential and successive blossoms, temporally
   regulated volatiles were linked to pollinator attraction in field and
   olfaction bioassays. In three characteristic compounds of FFDSFSA' EOs,
   linalyl acetate (72.73\%) and lavandulyl acetate (72.09\%) attracted
   more bees than linalool (45.35\%). Many transcripts related to flowering
   time and volatile terpenoid metabolism expressed differently during the
   flower development. Similar metabolic and transcriptomic profiles were
   observed when florets from the two axes were maintained at the same
   maturity grade. Besides both compounds and differentially expressed
   genes were rich in FB0, most volatile compounds were significantly
   correlated with FB0-specific gene module. Most key regulators related to
   flowering and terpenoid metabolism were interconnected in the subnetwork
   of FB0-specific module, suggesting the cross-talk between the two
   biological processes to some degree.ConclusionsCharacteristic compounds
   and gene expression profile of FB0 exhibit ecological value in pest
   control. The precise control of each-axis flowering and regular
   emissions at transcriptional and metabolic level are important to
   pollinators attraction for lavender. Our study sheds new light on
   lavender maximizes its fitness from gene-volatile terpenoid-insect three

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Bee populations have experienced declines in recent years, due in part
   to increased disease incidence. Multiple factors influence bee-pathogen
   interactions, including nectar and pollen quality and secondary
   metabolites. However, we lack an understanding of how plant interactions
   with their environment shape bee diet quality. We examined how plant
   interactions with the belowground environment alter floral rewards and,
   in turn, bee-pathogen interactions. Soil-dwelling mycorrhizal fungi are
   considered plant mutualists, although the outcome of the relationship
   depends on environmental conditions such as nutrients. In a 2 x 2
   factorial design, we asked whether mycorrhizal fungi and nutrients
   affect concentrations of nectar and pollen alkaloids (anabasine and
   nicotine) previously shown to reduce infection by the gut pathogen
   Crithidia in the native bumble bee Bombus impatiens. To ask how plant
   interactions affect this common bee pathogen, we fed pollen and nectar
   from our treatment plants, and from a wildflower pollen control with
   artificial nectar, to bees infected with Crithidia. Mycorrhizal fungi
   and fertilizer both influenced flowering phenology and floral chemistry.
   While we found no anabasine or nicotine in nectar, high fertilizer
   increased anabasine and nicotine in pollen. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) decreased nicotine concentrations, but the reduction due to AMF
   was stronger in high than low-nutrient conditions. AMF and nutrients
   also had interactive effects on bee pathogens via changes in nectar and
   pollen. High fertilizer reduced Crithidia cell counts relative to low
   fertilizer in AMF plants, but increased Crithidia in non-AMF plants.
   These results did not correspond with effects of fertilizer and AMF on
   pollen alkaloid concentrations, suggesting that other components of
   pollen or nectar were affected by treatments and shaped pathogen counts.
   Our results indicate that soil biotic and abiotic environment can alter
   bee-pathogen interactions via changes in floral rewards, and underscore
   the importance of integrative studies to predict disease dynamics and
   ecological outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Euglossini bees are more diverse in tropical and subtropical rainforests

   fragrances, mainly from orchids, used as precursors for sex pheromones,
   a fact that allows the use of synthesized compounds for their capture.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of Euglossini males
   in elevated sites of a montane rainforest (from 960 to 1,200 m) in
   southeastern Brazil (Atlantic Forest). Scent traps were distributed at
   three locations in different altitudes on one day per month over 19
   months. Six traps with different baits were distributed at each
   location. Overall, the male Euglossini community presented a low number
   of species (seven) and individuals (110). Moreover, we detected a
   drastic decay in Euglossini species richness and abundance with
   increasing altitude, which suggests a limit for the occurrence of
   Euglossini populations around 1100 m in the study area. This community
   presented a high dominance degree with a single dominant species
   (Euglossa annectans). In addition, only one species of perfume orchid
   was abundant and flowered in the study area during our sampling period.
   The distribution of this orchid species corresponds to the occurrence of

Abstract = {{Linden (Tilia spp.), a profusely flowering temperate tree that provides
   bees with vital pollen and nectar, has been associated with bumble bee
   (Bombus spp.) mortality in Europe and North America. Bee deaths have
   been attributed, with inadequate evidence, to toxicity from mannose in
   nectar or starvation due to low nectar in late blooming linden. Here, we
   investigated both factors via untargeted metabolomic analyses of nectar
   from five T. cordata trees beneath which crawling/dead bumble bees (B.
   vosnesenskii) were observed, and of thoracic muscle of 28 healthy
   foraging and 29 crawling bees collected from linden trees on cool

   (P<0.05) in 34 of 123 identified metabolites. Of these, TCA (Krebs)
   cycle intermediates were strongly represented (pathway analysis;
   P<0.01), suggesting that the central metabolism is affected in crawling
   bees. Hence, we propose the following explanation: when ambient
   temperature is low, bees with energy deficit are unable to maintain the
   thoracic temperature required for flight, and consequently fall, crawl,
   and ultimately, die. Energy deficit could occur when bees continue to
   forage on linden despite limited nectar availability either due to
   loyalty to a previously energy-rich source or trigonelline-triggered
   memory/learning impairment, documented earlier with other alkaloids.
   Thus, the combination of low temperature and nectar volume, resource
   fidelity, and alkaloids in nectar could explain the unique phenomenon of
   bumble bee mortality associated with linden.}},

Abstract = {{The global increase in the proportion of land cultivated with
   pollinator-dependent crops implies increased reliance on pollination
   services. Yet agricultural practices themselves can profoundly affect
   pollinator supply and pollination. Extensive monocultures are associated
   with a limited pollinator supply and reduced pollination, whereas
   agricultural diversification can enhance both. Therefore, areas where
   agricultural diversity has increased, or at least been maintained, may
   better sustain high and more stable productivity of pollinator-dependent
   crops. Given that >80\% of all crops depend, to varying extents, on
   insect pollination, a global increase in agricultural pollinator
   dependence over recent decades might have led to a concomitant increase
   in agricultural diversification. We evaluated whether an increase in the
   area of pollinator-dependent crops has indeed been associated with an
   increase in agricultural diversity, measured here as crop diversity, at
   the global, regional, and country scales for the period 1961-2016.
   Globally, results show a relatively weak and decelerating rise in
   agricultural diversity over time that was largely decoupled from the
   strong and continually increasing trend in agricultural dependency on
   pollinators. At regional and country levels, there was no consistent
   relationship between temporal changes in pollinator dependence and crop
   diversification. Instead, our results show heterogeneous responses in
   which increasing pollinator dependence for some countries and regions
   has been associated with either an increase or a decrease in
   agricultural diversity. Particularly worrisome is a rapid expansion of
   pollinator-dependent oilseed crops in several countries of the Americas
   and Asia that has resulted in a decrease in agricultural diversity. In
   these regions, reliance on pollinators is increasing, yet agricultural
   practices that undermine pollination services are expanding. Our
   analysis has thereby identified world regions of particular concern
   where environmentally damaging practices associated with large-scale,
   industrial agriculture threaten key ecosystem services that underlie
   productivity, in addition to other benefits provided by biodiversity.}},

   show that Oenothera drummondii flowers, exposed to playback sound of a

   pollination. We found that the flowers vibrated mechanically in response

   serves as an auditory sensory organ. Both the vibration and the nectar
   response were frequency-specific: the flowers responded and vibrated to
   pollinator sounds, but not to higher frequency sound. Our results
   document for the first time that plants can rapidly respond to
   pollinator sounds in an ecologically relevant way. Potential
   implications include plant resource allocation, the evolution of flower

Abstract = {{Several population genetic studies investigated the extent of gene flow
   and population connectivity in bumblebees. In general, no restriction in
   gene flow is considered for mainland populations of common bumblebee
   species. Whether this assumption holds true for all species is not
   known. An assessment of bumblebee genetic structure in the context of
   their geographic distribution is needed to prioritize conservation and
   management needs. Here, we conducted a genetic study on seven bumblebee
   species occurring in Belgium and Estonia. Using 16 microsatellite
   markers, we investigated genetic diversity and population structuring in
   each species. This is the first study investigating population
   structuring of both declining and stable bumblebee species on both small

   population structuring between the populations of the restricted and
   declining bumblebee species on both scales, while significant
   structuring was found for populations of the common species on the
   larger scale. The latter result, which may be due to human or
   environmental changes in the landscape, implies the need for the
   conservation of also widespread bumblebee species. Conservation
   strategies to improve gene flow and connectivity of populations could
   avoid the isolation and future losses of populations of these important

Abstract = {{Wildfire regimes are changing in the western United States, yet the ways
   in which wildfires influence native bees, the resources they depend on
   for food and nesting, or the traits that influence their interactions
   with plants are poorly understood. In burned and unburned areas in
   Montana, USA, we investigated the abundance and diversity of native
   bees, floral and nesting resources, nesting success, and traits of
   flowers and bees. In two of the three localities studied, burned areas,
   including areas that burned with high-severity wildfires, supported
   higher density and diversity of native bees and the flowers they depend
   on for food and larval provisioning. Burned areas also had more bare
   ground for ground-nesting bees and more available coarse woody debris
   for cavity-nesting bees than unburned areas. Moreover, cavity-nesting
   bees were completely unsuccessful at nesting in artificial nesting boxes
   in unburned areas, while nesting success was 40\% in burned areas. Mean
   bee intertegular distance (a trait strongly correlated with tongue
   length, foraging distance, and body size) was similar between burned and
   unburned areas. However, wildfires influenced both interspecific and
   intraspecific trait variation of bees and plants. Intraspecific
   variation in bee intertegular distance was higher in unburned than
   burned areas. Both interspecific and intraspecific variation in floral
   traits important for interactions with pollinators were generally higher
   in burned than unburned areas. Thus, wildfires generally increased the
   density and species diversity of bees and flowers as well as trait
   variation at both trophic levels. We conclude that wildfires-even large,
   high-severity wildfires-create conditions that support native bees and
   the resources they need to flourish, but that unburned areas maintain
   trait variation in landscape mosaics with heterogeneous fire conditions.}},

Abstract = {{1. Though recent literature highlights widespread bee declines, detailed
   information on local communities and individual species remains scarce.
   In order to accurately direct conservation initiatives and to evaluate
   the status of wild bees, regional long-term data on these populations
   are critical.
   2. This study analysed 119 wild bee species within New Hampshire, USA,
   over 125 years (1891-2016) using museum data. Examining pollinator
   communities across regional spatial scales has the power to highlight
   small-scale changes that go undetected in larger investigations. In the
   light of unknown effects of introduced species and cumulative range
   expansions of exotic taxa, monitoring wild communities closely and
   extensively over time is becoming increasingly important.
   3. The composition of the New Hampshire wild bee community has changed
   between the historical and contemporary time periods with 14 species
   found to be statistically significantly declining and eight species
   found to be statistically significantly increasing. Over half of the
   species found to be in statistically significant decline experienced a
   significant elevational or latitudinal range shift, many are regionally
   important crop pollinators, and all are native New Hampshire taxa.
   4. Guild affiliations were not found to be indicators of change,
   suggesting that the requirements and behaviour of individual species
   must be examined in order to evaluate the current and future stability
   of the wild bee community. Many of these species occur in varied
   landscapes, climates, and habitats; thus, monitoring changes at regional
   scales is critical to informing conservation recommendations broadly and
   focusing future research directions.}},

   richness in spring. During spring, the most common bees at Napatree were
   twig- and cavity-nesting species such as Ceratina dupla and Osmia

Abstract = {{In many plant species, flower size is correlated with the production of
   floral rewards such as nectar and pollen and, therefore, provides
   information to pollinators about flower quality. However, how
   relationships between flower size and rewards influence plant fitness is
   not well understood. In particular, it is unclear whether indicating to
   pollinators which flowers are unrewarding harms or benefits plants. We
   used a laboratory system with artificial flowers to examine bumblebees'
   (Bombus impatiens) responses to plants that had flower size as an
   informative cue (with large flowers rewarding and small flowers
   unrewarding) as compared with ``deceptive{''} plants that had a mixture
   of rewarding and unrewarding large flowers and plants with only large,
   rewarding flowers. Bees had previously foraged in a context in which
   only large flowers provided rewards. Small flowers were visited less
   often than large flowers. In comparing plants with different numbers of
   flowers, we found that small flowers, although they added less to a
   plant's attractiveness than large flowers, did increase a plant's
   attractiveness if present in sufficient number. Furthermore, plants with
   informative cues received substantially fewer flower visits per plant
   visit in comparison with deceptive plants, even when the plants with
   informative cues had a larger number of flowers. Cues identifying
   unrewarding flowers could, therefore, reduce rates of within-plant
   pollen movement, increasing the plant's fitness gains per flower visit.
   Their contribution to whole-plant attractiveness and avoidance of
   inbreeding could help explain why many plants produce small, relatively
   unrewarding flowers even though pollinators avoid visiting them.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural habitats (SNH) are vital to sustain pollinators and natural
   enemies, and the ecosystem services they provide in agroecosystems.
   However, little is known about the relative importance of different SNH
   types and their vegetation traits for pollinators and natural enemies.
   Yet, such knowledge is essential for effective habitat management to
   promote both functional arthropod groups and associated multiple
   ecosystem services. We quantified vegetation traits and abundances of
   pollinators (bees) and natural enemies (predatory flies and parasitic
   wasps) in 217 SNH differing in type (woody or herbaceous) and shape
   (linear or areal habitats), for edge and interior locations within each
   SNH patch with respect to adjacent crops, across 62 agricultural
   landscapes in four European countries. Pollinators and natural enemies
   responded distinctively to major SNH types and within-habitat location
   of SNH: abundance of natural enemies (predatory flies and parasitic
   wasps) was higher along woody habitat edges than herbaceous SNH or the
   interior of woody habitats. In contrast, bee abundances, especially of
   honey bees, were generally higher in areal herbaceous compared to woody
   SNH. Abundances of both wild bees and managed honey bees were lowest for
   the interior sampling location in areal woody habitats. These findings
   reflected divergent key vegetation traits driving pollinator and natural
   enemy abundances across SNH: bee pollinators increased with herbaceous
   plant cover and were well predicted by SNH type and the floral abundance
   of identified key plant trait groups. In contrast, floral abundances of
   these plant groups were poor predictors of the studied natural enemies,
   which were better predicted by SNH type and sampling location within
   SNH. Our findings stress the need to move beyond the simplistic pooling
   of SNH types and highlight the importance of considering their
   vegetation traits to more reliably predict pollinators and natural
   enemies in agroecosystems. They suggest that the floral abundance of key
   groups of flowering plants is crucial for habitat management to promote
   bee pollinators, while vegetation-structural traits appear more
   important for predatory flies and parasitoids. The distinct importance
   of different SNH types and associated vegetation traits for pollinators
   and natural enemies calls for agroecosystem management ensuring diverse
   SNH with complementary vegetation traits to concomitantly foster
   pollination and pest control services.}},

Abstract = {{Certain agroecosystems can contribute to regional biodiversity
   conservation and to the maintenance of ecosystem services. Prickly pear
   cactus (Opuntia albicarpa) crops on the Mexican Plateau could fulfill
   these roles, but little is known about their potential. The objective of
   this study was to analyze the diversity of bee communities in prickly
   pear cactus crops and natural cactus xerophilous scrub dominated by
   Opuntia spp., and to identify the possible influence of bee diversity in
   prickly pear production. Using colored pan traps, we collected 4012
   bees, 2405 in crops and 1607 in natural scrub. There were no significant
   differences between habitats in any of the bee community parameters
   (richness, average abundance, diversity, and species composition). There
   was a negative relationship between bee abundance and the proportion of
   area covered by other types of crops in landscape units measuring 1 km
   radius around the sampling sites. In the prickly pear crops, there was a
   positive relationship between the number of fruits and bee diversity,
   although the number of fruits was also strongly dependent on the number
   of flowers. In the natural scrub, the number of fruits was positively
   related to both bee abundance and the number of flowers. Future studies
   should be carried out to study O. albicarpa pollination in depth. The
   results support the idea that prickly pear crops have a high
   conservation potential for local bee diversity, and that they provide
   habitat and food resources just like the natural scrub does. Moreover,
   the results suggest that bee diversity may have a positive influence on
   food production (Opuntia fruit) and may contribute to socio-economic
   well-being in the region.}},

Abstract = {{High pollinator reliability is essential to maintain a stable and
   predictable crop production. However, still few studies have considered
   landscape effects on the stability (low variability) of the pollination
   service to crops. The stability of pollination services may increase in
   heterogeneous landscapes with high availability and diversity of
   alternative habitats. By using data on pollinator visitation and fruit
   production in 18 almond tree fields in Mallorca Island, we related
   landscape heterogeneity (richness, evenness and diversity of land-cover
   classes) at 1 and 2 km-radius buffer zone to the spatial (among-tree)
   stability of their pollination services (total visit rates, wild
   pollinators' visit rates, pollinator richness and fruit set). Overall,
   landscape heterogeneity increased the spatial stability (i.e., decreased
   spatial variability) of pollination services to almond trees.
   Interestingly different components of heterogeneity influenced diverse
   components of this service. Thus, increasing landscape evenness at the 2
   km buffer zone increased the spatial stability of both total pollinator
   visitation and fruit set. However, the stability of wild-pollinators'
   visit rate as well as the stability of pollinator richness increased
   instead with the percentage of natural habitat in the buffers, as the
   abundance of wild pollinators might depend on the total availability of
   habitat in the field surroundings. The stability in pollinator richness
   had a further positive effect on the stability of fruit set, indicating
   the importance of diversity maintaining stable crop production. Lastly,
   fruit set was also negatively affected by landscape richness, probably
   because of a loss of pollinator source habitat when the number of land
   uses is too high. Preserving a heterogeneous habitat of high quality in
   the surroundings of crop fields may help to maintain a stable fruit
   production.}},

   (M.B. Viswan. \& Manik.) B. Xue \& R.M.K. Saunders (Annonaceae), a
   steno-endemic and critically endangered tree species from the
   Kalakkad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve of India for its phenology, pollen
   morphology and viability, pollinators and conditions required to
   increase individuals and populations. We used Global Positioning System
   mapping to collect required data. Recording of mere 171 individuals in 7
   populations justify its inclusion in IUCN Red List Category of
   critically endangered. Though flowering occurs throughout the year, it
   is at peak in July. Flowers are protogynous and cantharophilous and bear
   215 +/- 10 anthers/flower, 750 +/- 60 pollen grains/anther, 1,65,000 +/-
   100 pollen grains/flower, 25 +/- 12 ovules/flower and 6,600:1
   pollen/ovule. Predominant pollinators are beetles belonging to
   Carpophilus plagiatipennis and Cerambycid species. Other pollinators
   include species of Aphis, Azteca, Endaeus, Pseudococcus and Psylla.
   Species of Halyzia and Scolopendra have also been noticed. Pollinators
   left behind black markings after feeding. Pollen germination was high
   (73.44\% to MTT assay; 73.10\% at 20\% sucrose concentration). While
   humus-free soil significantly promotes seed germination, it requires

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Sand mines represent anthropogenically impacted habitats found
   worldwide, which bear potential for bee conservation. Although floral
   resources can be limited at these habitats, vegetation free patches of
   open sandy soils and embankments may offer good nesting possibilities
   for sand restricted and other bees. We compared bee communities as found
   in three reclaimed sand mines and at adjacent roadside meadows in
   Maryland, USA, over two years. Both sand mines and roadsides hosted
   diverse bee communities with 111 and 88 bee species, respectively. Bee
   abundances as well as richness and Shannon diversity of bee species were
   higher in sand mines than at roadsides and negatively correlated with
   the percentage of vegetational ground cover. Species composition also
   differed significantly between habitats. Sand mines hosted a higher
   proportion of ground nesters, more uncommon and more `sand loving' bees
   similar to natural sandy areas of Maryland. Despite the destruction of
   the original pre-mining habitat, sand mines thus appear to represent a
   unique habitat for wild bees, particularly when natural vegetation and
   open sand spots are encouraged. Considering habitat loss, the lack of
   natural disturbance regimes, and ongoing declines of wild bees, sand
   mines could add promising opportunities for bee conservation which has
   hitherto mainly focused on agricultural and urban habitats. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{Scutellaria mexicana (Lamiaceae) is a common shrub in the Mojave and
   northern Sonoran Deserts in North America. The plant produces small
   tubular and bilabiate flowers that are nototribic by enclosing 2 pairs
   of stamens and a style within a hooded upper corolla lip. I investigated
   the pollination of the species in southern Nevada during April 2018 by
   aspirating insects from flowers. I estimated amounts of S. mexicana
   pollen on the front of the head and dorsum of the thorax, determined
   proportions of conspecific pollen on the head, thorax, and middle and
   hind legs, and examined correspondence between measurements of insect
   and flower structure. All insects collected on flowers were similarly
   sized bees in Anthophora (Apidae), mostly comprising A. coptognatha
   females, followed by A. centriformis males and females. Bees landed on
   flowers and fed on nectar with the front of the head against lobes that
   extended laterally from the base of the upper corolla lip. Large and
   varying amounts of conspecific pollen were carried on the head and
   thorax of bees, consistent with S. mexicana's nototribic flowers. Bees
   appeared specific to the plant because they carried high proportions of
   S. mexicana pollen. Proportions of conspecific pollen on bees differed
   among collection sites, likely due to different floral compositions.
   Lower proportions of conspecific pollen on the legs compared with the
   head or thorax indicated that pollen from plants other than S. mexicana
   was more likely to be transferred to the legs by bees of both sexes and
   transported to larvae by females. The length of Anthophora's long glossa
   corresponded to the depth of the corolla and the availability of nectar.
   The vertex of the head and anterior dorsum of the thorax of bees feeding
   on nectar would align with the anthers and stigma on the flowers.
   Scutellaria mexicana in southern Nevada appears to be dependent on
   Anthophora bees for pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Premise Closely related species occurring in sympatry may experience the
   negative consequences of interspecific pollen transfer if reproductive
   isolation (RI) barriers are not in place. We evaluated the importance of
   pre- and post-pollination RI barriers in three sympatric species of
   Achimenes (Gesneriaceae), including ecogeographic, phenological, floral
   isolation, self-pollination, and hybrid viability (fruit and seed set).
   Methods We recorded geographic distribution throughout species ranges
   and assessed flowering phenology and pollinator visitation at one site
   in central Mexico. In the greenhouse, we measured floral traits involved
   in RI and quantified fruit and seed set for from self, intraspecific,
   and interspecific crosses. Results Ecogeographic barriers were important
   in RI, but under sympatry, phenological and floral barriers contributed
   more to total RI. Phenological RI varied between species and years,
   while floral RI was 100\% effective at preventing interspecific
   visitation. Species showed differences in floral morphology, color, and
   scents associated with specialized pollination systems (A.
   antirrhina-hummingbirds, A. flava-bees, A. patens-butterflies);
   heterospecific visitation events were restricted to rare secondary
   pollinators. Hybrid crosses consistently yielded progeny in lower
   numbers than intraspecific crosses. Conclusions This study indicated
   that neither autogamy nor early post-pollination barriers prevent
   interspecific pollen flow between Achimenes species. However, floral
   isolation, acting through a combination of attraction and reward traits,
   consistently ensures specificity of the pollination system. These
   results suggest that selection on floral traits to reduce the costs of
   hybrid progeny production may have played a role in evolution or
   maintenance of specialized pollination systems in Achimenes.}},

Abstract = {{Bird pollination systems are dominated by specialist nectarivores, such
   as hummingbirds in the Americas and sunbirds in Africa. Opportunistic
   (generalist) avian nectarivores such as orioles, weavers and bulbuls

   exclusively on birds for seed production. We found that the number of
   pollen grains on stigmas of flowers receiving single visits by

   twofold greater than on those that received single visits by honeybees.
   The number of pollen grains on stigmas of flowers visited by sunbirds
   was similar to that on stigmas of unvisited flowers. These results show
   that opportunistic birds are highly effective pollinators of A. ferox,

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Most flowering plants species rely on in sects for pollination, a
   successful mutualism allowing them to reproduce over wide areas while
   flower-visitors are rewarded with food. This association is so
   conspicuous in the case of bees that other groups of potential
   pollinators, especially flies, have long been underestimated. However,
   visitors are not always pollinators. While the importance of flies in
   plant-visitor networks is now acknowledged, their pollination
   effectiveness has hardly been investigated. In this study, we assessed
   the pollination effectiveness of Geranium sylvaticum flower-visitors
   using single-visit seed set experiments, in a subalpine meadow where
   flies are predominant. We found that: (i) empidine dance flies were the
   most frequent visitors of G. sylvaticum (ii) a single-visit by an
   empidine dance fly produced the same average number of seeds as a visit
   by a bee; (iii) large pollinators were more efficient than small
   pollinators irrespective of their identity. As a conclusion, large
   empidines were the main pollinators of G. sylvaticum. Considering the
   high diversity and abundance of flower-visiting fly species, such
   results showing their ability to be as effective pollinators as bees

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Animals such as bumblebees use chemosensory cues to both locate and
   evaluate essential resources. Increasingly, it is recognized that
   microbes can alter the quality of foraged resources and produce
   metabolites that may act as foraging cues. The distinct nature of these
   chemosensory cues however and their use in animal foraging remain poorly
   understood. Here, we test the hypothesis that species of
   nectar-inhabiting microbes differentially influence pollinator
   attraction and feeding via microbial metabolites produced in nectar. We
   first examined the electrophysiological potential for bumblebee (Bombus
   impatiens) antennal olfactory neurons to respond to microbial volatile
   organic compounds (mVOCs), followed by an olfactory preference test. We
   also assessed gustatory preferences for microbial-altered nectar through
   both no-choice and choice feeding assays. Antennal olfactory neurons
   responded to some mVOCs, and bees preferred nectar solutions inoculated
   with the bacterium Asaia astilbes over the yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii
   based on volatiles alone. However, B. impatiens foragers consumed
   significantly more Metschnikowia-inoculated nectar, suggesting distinct
   roles for mVOCs and non-volatile metabolites in mediating both
   attraction and feeding decisions. Collectively, our results suggest that
   microbial metabolites have significant potential to shape interspecific,
   plant-pollinator signalling, with consequences for forager learning,
   economics and floral host reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{How animals explore and acquire knowledge from the environment is a key
   question in movement ecology. For pollinators that feed on multiple
   small replenishing nectar resources, the challenge is to learn efficient
   foraging routes while dynamically acquiring spatial information about
   new resource locations. Here, we use the behavioural mapping
   t-Stochastic Neighbouring Embedding algorithm and Shannon entropy to
   statistically analyse previously published sampling patterns of
   bumblebees feeding on artificial flowers in the field. We show that
   bumblebees modulate foraging excursions into distinctive behavioural
   strategies, characterizing the trade-off dynamics between (i) visiting
   and exploiting flowers close to the nest, (ii) searching for new routes
   and resources, and (iii) exploiting learned flower visitation sequences.
   Experienced bees combine these behavioural strategies even after they
   find an optimal route minimizing travel distances between flowers. This
   behavioural variability may help balancing energy costs-benefits and
   facilitate rapid adaptation to changing environments and the integration
   of more profitable resources in their routes.}},

Abstract = {{ContextBees are the most important pollinators of crops worldwide. For
   most bees, patches of semi-natural habitat within or adjacent to crops

   within agroecological landscapes, with potentially negative consequences
   for bee communities and the services they provide.ObjectivesIdentify how
   the availability of semi-natural habitat impacts bee communities across
   biogeographic regions, which may reveal commonalities and key governing
   principles that transcend a single region or taxa.MethodsWe analyze and
   compare the drivers of bee community composition in cotton fields within
   Brazil and the U.S. to reveal how land cover and land cover change
   impact bee community composition across these two regions.ResultsWe show
   that the most critical factors impacting bee communities in cotton
   agroecosystems are the same in Brazil and the U.S.: bee abundance
   increases with cotton bloom density and the abundance of semi-natural
   habitat. Further, the loss of semi-natural habitat over a 5-year period
   negatively impacts bee abundance in both agroecosystems.ConclusionsGiven
   the importance of bee abundance for the provision of pollination service

Abstract = {{Pollination is an ecosystem service that directly contributes to
   agricultural production, and can therefore provide a strong incentive to
   conserve natural habitats that support pollinator populations. However,
   we have yet to provide consistent and convincing pollination service
   valuations to effectively slow the conversion of natural habitats. We
   use coffee in Kodagu, India, to illustrate the uncertainties involved in
   estimating costs and benefits of pollination services. First, we fully
   account for the benefits obtained by coffee agroforests that are
   attributable to pollination from wild bees nesting in forest habitats.
   Second, we compare these benefits to the opportunity cost of conserving
   forest habitats and forgoing conversion to coffee production.
   Throughout, we systematically quantify the uncertainties in our
   accounting exercise and identify the parameters that contribute most to
   uncertainty in pollination service valuation. We find the value of
   pollination services provided by one hectare of forest to be 25\% lower
   than the profits obtained from converting that same surface to coffee
   production using average values for all parameters. However, our results
   show this value is not robust to moderate uncertainty in parameter
   values, particularly that driven by variability in pollinator density.
   Synthesis and applications. Our findings emphasize the need to develop

Abstract = {{Floral resources are known to be important in regulating wild pollinator

   and restoration schemes which aim to support pollinators and their

   resources at the whole-farm scale on replicate farms in Southwestern UK
   throughout the flowering season. We quantify the corresponding nectar
   demands of a subset of common wild pollinators (bumblebees) to compare
   nectar supply and pollinator demand throughout the year, thereby
   identifying periods of supply-demand deficit. We record strong seasonal
   fluctuations in farmland nectar supplies, with two main peaks of nectar
   production (May and July) and a considerable ``June Gap{''} in between.
   March and August/September are also periods of low nectar availability.
   Comparing the phenology of nectar supply with the phenology of bumblebee
   nectar demand reveals ``hunger gaps{''} during March and much of
   August/September when supply is unlikely to meet demand. Permanent
   pasture and woodland produced the greatest share of farmland nectar
   because of their large area; however, linear features such as hedgerows
   and field margins provided the greatest nectar per unit area. Fifty
   percent of total nectar was supplied by just three species (Allium
   ursinum, Cirsium arvense and Trifolium repens), but some less productive
   species (e.g. Hedera helix and Taraxacum agg.) were important in
   ensuring phenological continuity of nectar supply. Synthesis and
   applications. By comparing the phenology of farmland nectar supply with
   the phenology of pollinator demand, we demonstrate that the timing of
   nectar supply may be as important as total nectar production in limiting
   farmland pollinator populations. Considering phenology in the design of
   agri-environment or restoration schemes is therefore likely to improve
   their suitability for pollinators. Plant species which flower during
   periods of resource deficit (early spring and late summer) should be
   prioritized in schemes which aim to conserve or restore pollinator
   populations. Maintaining a range of semi-natural habitats with
   complementary flowering phenologies (e.g. woodland, hedgerows and field
   margins) will ensure a more continuous supply of nectar on farmland,
   thereby supporting pollinators for their entire flight season.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To assess whether the reduced nutritional resources available for
   pollinators due to plant community simplification along an elevational
   plant-diversity gradient changes pollinator niche breadth and richness.
   Additionally, we evaluated how body size and proboscis length of
   pollinators shifted along the gradient, and whether these changes were
   related to pollinator niche breadth. Location An elevational gradient
   (2,350-3,520 m a.s.l.) on the oceanic high-mountain strato-volcano of El
   Teide (Tenerife, Canary Islands). Taxon Flowering plant and pollinator
   species. Methods We compared quantitative plant-pollinator networks
   along the plant-diversity gradient. We calculated a set of niche-based
   topological metrics that capture the degree of specialization, niche
   breadth and niche overlap. Furthermore, we obtained beta-diversity
   measures and the proportion of replacement and richness components.
   Results There was an overall decline in species richness of pollinators
   with increasing elevation. This decline was mainly driven by the loss of
   species along the elevational gradient, which conformed a nested subset
   pattern. The whole network showed less specialization, greater
   connectance and lower modularity towards the summit. At high elevations,
   pollinators were more generalized and less selective in their flower
   choice, showing a greater trophic niche breadth compared to pollinators
   at lower elevations. Mean body size of pollinators increased with
   elevation, and species body size and proboscis length were positively
   associated with the number of plant species visited. Main conclusions
   Overall, results indicated that the elevational gradient filters
   pollinator species, probably according to their thermal tolerance and
   ability to exploit a wide range of trophic resources. The finding that
   pollinators become more generalized and opportunistic at higher
   elevations is a novel result, which may have implications for new
   research into how ecological networks vary over environmental gradients.
   From an applied perspective, our results highlight the importance of
   considering the spatial variation of species assemblages when aiming to
   construct functionally reliable interaction networks along environmental
   gradients.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, extirpated plant species can be reintroduced and managed to
   restore sustainable populations. However, few reintroduced plants are
   known to persist for more than a few years. Our adaptive-management case
   study illustrates how we restored the endangered hemiparasitic annual
   plant, Chloropyron maritimum subsp. maritimum (salt marsh bird's beak),
   to Sweetwater Marsh, San Diego Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California,
   United States, and used monitoring and experimentation to identify the
   factors limiting the reintroduced population. After extirpation in 1988,
   reintroduction starting that year led to a resilient, genetically
   diverse population in 2016 (a ``boom{''} of approximately 14,000) that
   rebounded from a ``bust{''} (62 in 2014). Multiple regressions
   attributed 82\% of the variation in population counts to tidal
   amplitude, rainfall, and temperature. Populations of salt marsh bird's
   beak crashed when the diurnal tide range peaked during the 18.6-year
   lunar nodal cycle (a rarely considered factor that periodically added
   approximately 12 cm to tidal ranges). We explain booms as follows:
   During smaller tidal amplitudes, above-average rainfall could desalinize
   upper intertidal soils and stimulate salt marsh bird's beak germination.
   Then, moderate temperature in May favors growth to reproduction in June.
   In addition, salt marsh bird's beak needs a short and open canopy of
   native perennial plants, with roots to parasitize (not non-native annual
   grass pseudohosts) and nearby upland soil for a preferred pollinator,
   ground-burrowing bees. Although our reintroduced salt marsh bird's beak
   population is an exceptional case of persistence, this rare
   species-specific environmental and biological requirement makes it
   vulnerable to rising sea levels and global warming.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen viability affects the probability that a pollen grain deposited
   on a plant's stigma will produce a viable seed. Because a mature seed is
   needed before a gene flow event can occur, pollen viability will
   influence the risk of escape for genetically engineered (GE) crops.
   Pollen viability was measured at intervals for up to 2 h following
   removal of the pollen from the anthers. It was quantified at three
   temperatures and for different alfalfa varieties, including both
   conventional and Roundup Ready (RR) varieties. Pollen viability was
   assessed using in vitro germination. Time since removal from the anthers
   was the most prevalent factor affecting pollen viability in alfalfa.
   Pollen viability declined with increasing time at all three temperatures
   and for all varieties tested. Pollen viability was not affected by
   temperatures ranging between 25 and 37 degrees C and did not vary among
   plant varieties, including conventional and RR varieties. Bee foraging
   behaviour suggested pollen viability within the first 10 min following
   pollen removal from a flower to most affect seed production. Pollen

Abstract = {{Although common among orchids, pollination by perfume-gathering male
   euglossine bees is quite rare in other Neotropical families. In
   Gesneriaceae, for example, it is reported in two genera only, Drymonia
   and Gloxinia. Flowers of G. perennis are known to emit perfume, thereby
   attracting male euglossine bees as pollinators. However, detailed
   reports on the pollination ecology, as well as on chemistry of floral
   perfume of individuals in natural populations, are still missing. In
   this study, we report on the pollination ecology of G. perennis,
   focusing on the ecological significance of its floral perfume. In
   natural populations in Peru, we documented the floral biology and
   breeding system of G. perennis, as well as its interaction with flower
   visitors. We also characterised the chemical composition of floral
   perfume, as well as its timing of emission. Gloxinia perennis is
   self-compatible and natural pollination success is high. Spontaneous
   self-pollination occurs as a `just in case strategy' when pollinators
   are scarce. Perfume-collecting males of Eulaema cingulata and El.
   meriana were identified as pollinators. The perfume bouquet of G.
   perennis consists of 16 compounds. (E)-Carvone epoxide (41\%) and
   limonene (23\%) are the major constituents. Perfume emission is higher
   at 09:00 h, matching the activity peak of Eulaema pollinators. Flowers
   of G. perennis have evolved a mixed strategy to ensure pollination (i.e.
   self- and cross-pollination), but cross-pollination is favoured. The
   size and behaviour of Eulaema males enables only these bees to
   successfully cross-pollinate G. perennis. Furthermore, G. perennis
   floral perfume traits (i.e. chemistry and timing of emission) have
   evolved to optimise the attraction of these bees.}},

Abstract = {{It has been hypothesised that intense metabolism of nectar-inhabiting
   yeasts (NIY) may change nectar chemistry, including volatile profile,

   fitness. However, empirical evidence for the plant-microbe-pollinator
   interactions remains little known. To test this hypothesis, we use a
   bumblebee-pollinated vine Clematis akebioides endemic to southwest China
   as an experimental model plant. To quantify the incidence and density of
   Metschnikowia reukaufii, a cosmopolitan NIY in floral nectar, a
   combination of yeast cultivation and microscopic cell-counting method
   was used. To examine the effects of NIY on plant-pollinator
   interactions, we used real flowers filled with artificial nectar with or
   without yeast cells. Then the volatile metabolites produced in the
   yeast-inoculated nectar were analysed with coupled gas chromatography
   and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). On average 79.3\% of the C. akebioides
   flowers harboured M. reukaufii, and cell density of NIY was high to 7.4
   x 10(4) cells mm(-3). In the field population, the presence of NIY in
   flowers of C. akebioides increased bumblebee (Bombus friseanus)
   pollinator visitation rate and consequently seed set per flower. A
   variety of fatty acid derivatives produced by M. reukaufii may be
   responsible for the above beneficial interactions. The volatiles
   produced by the metabolism of M. reukaufii may serve as an honest signal
   to attract bumblebee pollinators and indirectly promote the female
   reproductive fitness of C. akebioides, forming a potentially tripartite

   sampled the bee fauna at 27 randomly selected sites along a 140-km
   (89-mile) segment of a transmission line that extends from Connecticut

   collected over a 12-week study period (late May to early August) with
   corridor plots yielding more than twice as many bee species and more
   than ten times the number of individuals than the forest plots. The
   aggregate richness for the 54 plots (= 205 species) represents nearly
   half the bee fauna of New England with species estimation curves

Abstract = {{Disconnected habitat fragments are poor at supporting population and

   studies, however, have considered how networks of restored habitat

   theory to examine the interaction between local and landscape

   habitat patches interact with the local floral diversity, bee diet
   breadth and bee body size to influence site occupancy, via colonisation

Abstract = {{Genetic correlations among different components of phenotypes,

   similar pollinator syndromes. We assessed the role of pleiotropy in the
   differentiation of floral and other reproductive traits between two
   species - Jaltomata sinuosa and J. umbellata (Solanaceae) - that have
   divergent suites of floral traits consistent with bee and hummingbird
   pollination, respectively. To do so, we generated a hybrid population

   quantitative trait locus (QTL) distribution) underlying 25 floral and
   fertility traits. We found that most floral traits had a relatively
   simple genetic basis (few, predominantly additive, QTLs of moderate to
   large effect), as well as little evidence of antagonistic pleiotropy
   (few trait correlations and QTL colocalization, particularly between
   traits of different classes). However, we did detect a potential case of

Abstract = {{Broccoli is an important Brassica vegetable that shows obvious
   heterosis. The main method for hybrid broccoli production is to use
   cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) and pollination by bees. Therefore, the
   evaluation and selection of high quality sources of CMS is important for
   broccoli breeding. We aimed to evaluate the effects of different CMS
   sources on the morphology and size of floral organs, the attractiveness
   to pollinators and yield of hybrid seeds. Using broccoli CMS lines
   generated from different CMS sources with the same maintainer lines, we
   studied morphophysiological characteristics of flowers, such as flower
   shape and size, nectar production and sugar content, as well as the
   number of bee visits and seed yield. The degree of bud abortion, floral
   organs shape, degree of flower opening, nectar production, bee visits,
   and hybrid yield differed in CMS lines with same recurrent parent. When
   the CMS source was same and the recurrent parents were different, the
   degrees of bud abortion were different among the CMS lines, while the
   flowering characteristics were similar. Generally, larger floral organs
   and higher volumes of nectar were associated with higher frequency of
   bee visits and higher seed yield. Based on the morphological
   characteristics and size of floral organs, nectar secretion,
   bee-attracting ability and hybrid yield, we selected four CMS sources
   suitable for future use in broccoli breeding. Our results will provide
   an important reference for breeding high-quality CMS lines in broccoli
   and provide valuable CMS sources for breeding other cruciferous crops.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing cost-effective monitoring programs for wild bees remains
   challenging due to the high costs of sampling and specimen
   identification. To reduce costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based
   methods have lately been suggested as alternatives to morphology-based
   identifications. To provide a comprehensive presentation of the
   advantages and weaknesses of different NGS-based identification methods,
   we assessed three of the most promising ones, namely metabarcoding,
   mitogenomics and NGS barcoding. Using a regular monitoring data set (723
   specimens identified using morphology), we found that NGS barcoding
   performed best for both species presence/absence and abundance data,
   producing only few false positives (3.4\%) and no false negatives. In
   contrast, the proportion of false positives and false negatives was
   higher using metabarcoding and mitogenomics. Although strong
   correlations were found between biomass and read numbers, abundance
   estimates significantly skewed the communities' composition in these two
   techniques. NGS barcoding recovered the same ecological patterns as
   morphology. Ecological conclusions based on metabarcoding and
   mitogenomics were similar to those based on morphology when using
   presence/absence data, but different when using abundance data. In terms
   of workload and cost, we show that metabarcoding and NGS barcoding can
   compete with morphology, but not mitogenomics which was consistently
   more expensive. Based on these results, we advocate that NGS barcoding
   is currently the seemliest NGS method for monitoring of wild bees.
   Furthermore, this method has the advantage of potentially linking DNA
   sequences with preserved voucher specimens, which enable morphological
   re-examination and will thus produce verifiable records which can be fed
   into faunistic databases.}},

Abstract = {{Main conclusionThis study provides first evidence of a thrips species
   pollinating Sambucus nigra and describes how interactions are driven by
   plant biochemical signalling and moderated by temporal changes in floral
   chemistry.AbstractThe concept of flower-feeding thrips as pollinating
   insects in temperate regions is rarely considered as they are more
   frequently regarded to be destructive florivores feeding on pollen and
   surrounding plant tissue. Combining laboratory and field-based studies
   we examined interactions between Sambucus nigra (elderflower) and Thrips
   major within their native range to ascertain the role of thrips in the
   pollination of this species and to determine if floral chemicals
   mediated flower visits. If thrips provide a pollination service to S.
   nigra, then this will likely manifest in traits that attract the
   pollinating taxa at temporally critical points in floral development. T.
   major were highly abundant in inflorescences of S. nigra, entering
   flowers when stigmas were pollen-receptive and anthers were immature.
   When thrips were excluded from the inflorescences, fruit-set failed.
   Linalool was the major component of the inflorescence headspace with
   peak abundance coinciding with the highest number of adult thrips
   visiting flowers. Thrips were absent in buds and their numbers declined
   again in senescing flowers inversely correlating with the concentration
   of cyanogenic glycosides recorded in the floral tissue. Our data show
   that S. nigra floral chemistry mediates the behaviour of pollen-feeding
   thrips by attracting adults in high numbers to the flowers at
   pre-anthesis stage, while producing deterrent compounds prior to fruit
   development. Taking an integrative approach to studying thrips behaviour
   and floral biology we provide a new insight into the previously
   ambiguously defined pollination strategies of S. nigra and provide
   evidence suggesting that the relationship between T. major and S. nigra
   is mutualistic.}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of complex phenotypes depends on the adaptive importance of
   individual traits, and the developmental changes required to modify
   traits. Floral syndromes are complex adaptations to pollinators that
   include color, nectar, and shape variation. Hummingbird-adapted flowers
   have evolved a remarkable number of times from bee-adapted ancestors in
   Penstemon, and previous work demonstrates that color over shape better
   distinguishes bee from hummingbird syndromes. Here, we examined the
   relative importance of nectar volume and nectary development in defining
   Penstemon pollination syndromes. We tested the evolutionary association
   of nectar volume and nectary area with pollination syndrome across 19
   Penstemon species. In selected species, we assessed cellular-level
   processes shaping nectary size. Within a segregating population from an
   intersyndrome cross, we assessed trait correlations between nectar
   volume, nectary area, and the size of stamens on which nectaries
   develop. Nectar volume and nectary area displayed an evolutionary
   association with pollination syndrome. These traits were correlated
   within a genetic cross, suggesting a mechanistic link. Nectary area
   evolution involves parallel processes of cell expansion and
   proliferation. Our results demonstrate that changes to nectary
   patterning are an important contributor to pollination syndrome
   diversity and provide further evidence that repeated origins of
   hummingbird adaptation involve parallel developmental processes in
   Penstemon.}},

   C. analis for crop pollination. The study was conducted from May to
   October 2017, using trap nests and daily observations from 5.00 a.m. to
   6.00 p.m. of nest occupation and building, foraging trips in the field
   and interactions between individuals and kleptoparasites. The results
   showed that the bees easily colonize and nest in trap nests for an
   extended period of the year under tropical conditions, and that the use
   of this type of nest makes it possible to multiply populations of this
   species for their potential use in crop pollination. However, sources of
   floral oil and the availability of nesting sites have both proved to be
   limiting factors to population growth in this species on bee farms.}},

   The bees P. aff. flavocincta foraged from 6 a. m. to 5: 30 p. m., with a

   species, and shows preference for more concentrated sugar sources, but
   also explores the food source with lower sugar concentrations within
   their flight range. Such strategy may help to understand how a

   effect of temperature on the phenology of the red-list plant Pulsatilla

   plants with later flowering. With a warming of 0.1 degrees C, the

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid insecticides have been linked to bee declines. However,

   collected from 114 commercial honeybee colonies placed along a gradient
   of agricultural intensity between June and September. Neonicotinoid
   concentrations increased through the season, peaking at the end of
   August. As a result, concentrations in pollen were negatively associated
   with collection from woody and crop plants that flower early-mid season,

Title = {{Multi-sensor mapping of honey bee habitats and fragmentation in
   agro-ecological landscapes in Eastern Kenya}},
Journal = {{GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL}},
Abstract = {{Extensive land transformation leads to habitat loss, which directly
   affects and fragments species habitats. Such land transformations can
   adversely affect fodder availability for bees and thus colony strength
   with consequences for rural communities that use bee keeping as a
   livelihood option. Quantification of the landscape structure is thus
   critical if the linkages between the landscape and honey bee colony
   health are to be well understood. In this study, a random forest
   algorithm was used on dual-polarized multi-season Sentinel-1A (S1)
   synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and single season Sentinel-2A (S2)
   optical imagery to map honey bee habitats and their degree of
   fragmentation in a heterogeneous agro-ecological landscape in eastern
   Kenya. The dry season S2 optical imagery was fused with the S1 data and
   class-wise mapping accuracies (with and without radar) were compared.
   Relevant fragmentation indices representing patch sizes, isolation and
   configuration were thereafter generated using the fused imagery. The
   fused imagery recorded an overall accuracy of 86\% with a kappa of 0.83
   versus the SAR imagery only, which had an overall accuracy of 76\% with
   a kappa of 0.68. However, the S1 imagery had slightly higher user's and
   producer's accuracies for under-represented but important honey bee
   habitat classes, that is, natural grasslands and hedges. The variable
   importance analysis using the fused imagery showed that the short-wave
   infrared and the red-edge waveband regions were highly relevant for the
   classification model. Our mapping approach showed that fusing data
   generated from S1 and S2 with improved spectral resolution, could be
   effectively used for the spatially explicit mapping of honey bee
   habitats and their degree of fragmentation in semi-arid African

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollinator communities are thought to transition from
   bee-dominated communities at low elevations to fly-dominated communities
   at high elevations. We predicted that increased tree canopy cover and a
   subsequent decrease in meadows and flowering plants would limit bees but
   not flies at higher elevations. We tested and supported this prediction
   by examining changes in both abundance and species richness for 128 bee
   species and 96 fly species at key points along an elevational gradient
   in Northern Arizona represented by distinct vegetation life zones. In
   addition to an increase in fly species and abundance relative to bees
   with increasing elevation, there were changes in community structure).
   To better understand factors that might influence this transition we
   examined how tree canopy cover changed along the elevational gradient
   and how this influenced the change in insect pollinator communities.
   While bee communities were progressively divergent between forest and
   meadow habitats with increasing elevation and tree canopy cover, there
   was no significant pattern with flies between meadow and forest
   habitats. However, fly abundance did increase with increasing elevation
   relative to bees. Along a comparable elevational gradient on an adjacent
   mountain with no tree canopy cover (i.e., a fire burned mountain), the
   bee-to-fly transition did not occur; bees persisted as the dominant
   pollinator into the highest life zone. This suggests that tree canopy
   cover can in part explain the transition from bee-to fly-dominated
   communities. In conclusion, this is the first study in North America to
   document a bee-fly transition for both abundance and species richness
   and show that tree canopy cover may play a role in determining
   pollinator community composition, by restricting bees to open meadow
   habitats.}},

Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Secondary pollen presentation (SPP) is a reproductive strategy that
   enhances the efficiency of pollen transfer, which has been explored for
   more than 200 years, resulting in 10 identified types of SPP. The
   ephemeral plant Hypecoum erectum L. (Papaveraceae) has an elaborate
   petal structure. The middle lobe is a key functional organ in SPP. To
   explore the importance of the middle lobe structure, we measured the
   flowering process, the curling movement and growth of the middle lobe,
   pollination characteristics, pollination efficiency, and the mating
   system in H. erectum in the field. The yellow middle lobe structure had
   an important role in attracting pollinators. The middle lobes on the
   inner petals function as a redundant cucullate structure and wrapped
   about 84\% of the total pollen grains as soon as the anthers dehisced.
   These then grew upward and gradually presented pollen to pollinators via
   the roll out of the middle lobes. One bee species, Colletes vestitus
   from Colletidae, was the only effective pollinator of H. erectum. The
   SPP mechanism increased the efficiency of pollen transfer by C.
   vestitus. The middle lobes, which wrapped pollen and grew upward,
   contacted the stigma and provided an advantage for self-pollination and
   outcrossing by growing upward higher than the corolla. Hypecoum erectum
   L. has a mixed mating system with selfing and outcrossing. Thus, the SPP
   mechanism plays a key role during the pollination process and is
   necessary for improving pollination efficiency and promoting

Abstract = {{An appreciation of body size allometry is central for understanding

   coefficients for five of the seven extant bee families (Apoidea:
   Anthophila) to include crucial but difficult-to-measure traits, such as
   proboscis length, in ecological and evolutionary studies. Melittidae
   were not included although they are important pollinators in South
   Africa where they comprise an especially rich and morphologically
   diverse fauna. We measured intertegular distance (correlated with body
   size) and proboscis length of 179 specimens of 11 species from three
   genera of Melittidae. With the inclusion of Melittidae, we tested the
   between family differences in the allometric scaling coefficients. AIC
   model selection was used to establish which factors provide the best
   estimate of proboscis length. We explored a hypothesis that has been
   proposed in the literature, but which has not been tested, whereby body
   and range sizes of bees are correlated with rainfall regions. We tested
   this by using body size measurements of 2109 museum specimens from 56
   species of Melittidae and applied the model coefficients to estimate
   proboscis length and foraging distance. Our results from testing
   differences across bee families show that with the addition of
   Melittidae, we retained the overall pattern of significant differences
   in the scaling coefficient among Apoidea, with our model explaining 98\%
   of the variance in species-level means for proboscis length. When
   testing the relationship between body size and rainfall region we found
   no relationship for South African Melittidae. Overall, this study has
   added allometric scaling coefficients for an important bee family and
   shown the applicability of using these coefficients when linked with
   museum specimens to test ecological hypothesis.}},

   robbed open flowers. In robbed flowers, pollinators' visit type and

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and degradation due to agricultural intensification and
   urbanization are key threats facing wild pollinators, especially bees.
   However, data on the distribution and abundance of most of the world's
   20,000+ bee species is lacking, making it difficult to assess the
   effects of anthropogenic disturbance through time. Moreover, there are
   geographic biases in the study of bees creating gaps in our
   understanding of species distributions and regional patterns of
   diversity. Research efforts are often focused around cities or field
   stations associated with universities and other research institutions.
   In this perspectives paper, we provide examples of geographic bias in
   knowledge regarding bee species distributions using recently collected
   data from Michigan and Colorado, USA-two states with published species
   checklists. We illustrate how a limited sampling effort can advance
   knowledge about bee species distributions, yielding species occurrence
   records at local and regional scales. Given the implications of
   geographic biases, we recommend future research efforts focus on poorly
   sampled geographic regions, especially those affected by anthropogenic
   disturbance, in order to expand our understanding of human impacts on
   wild bee species. Sampling across a broader geographic area will provide
   critical information for taxonomy and predictive models of bee species
   distributions and diversity. We encourage researchers to plan future
   studies with consideration of strategies to avoid oversampling local bee
   populations, the taxonomic expertise required to identify specimens, and
   resources necessary to voucher specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Teeming within pollen provisions are diverse communities of symbiotic
   microbes, which provide a variety of benefits to bees. Microbes
   themselves may represent a major dietary resource for developing bee
   larvae. Despite their apparent importance in sustaining bee health,
   evidence linking pollen-borne microbes to larval health is currently
   lacking. We examined the effects of microbe-deficient diets on the
   fitness of larval mason bees. In a series of diet manipulations,
   microbe-rich maternally collected pollen provisions were replaced with
   increasing fractions of sterilized, microbe-deficient pollen provisions
   before being fed to developing larvae. Convergent findings from amino
   acid and fatty acid trophic biomarker analyses revealed that larvae
   derived a substantial amount of nutrition from microbial prey and
   occupied a significantly higher trophic position than that of strict
   herbivores. Larvae feeding on increasingly sterile diets experienced
   significant adverse effects on growth rates, biomass and survivorship.
   When completely deprived of pollen-borne microbes, larvae consistently
   exhibited marked decline in fitness. We conclude that microbes
   associated with aged pollen provisions are central to bee health, not
   only as nutritional mutualists, but also as a major dietary component.
   In an era of global bee decline, the conservation of such bee-microbe
   interactions may represent an important facet of pollinator protection
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The flowering phenology of early-blooming plants is largely determined
   by snowmelt timing in high-latitude and high-altitude ecosystems. When
   the synchrony of flowering and pollinator emergence is disturbed by
   climate change, seed production may be restricted due to insufficient
   pollination success. We revealed the mechanism of phenological mismatch
   between a spring ephemeral (Corydalis ambigua) and its pollinator
   (overwintered bumblebees), and its impact on plant reproduction, based
   on 19 years of monitoring and a snow removal experiment in a
   cool-temperate forest in northern Japan. Early snowmelt increased the
   risk of phenological mismatch under natural conditions. Seed production
   was limited by pollination success over the 3 years of the pollination
   experiment and decreased when flowering occurred prior to bee emergence.
   Similar trends were detected on modification of flowering phenology
   through snow removal. Following snowmelt, the length of the
   pre-flowering period strongly depended on the ambient surface
   temperature, ranging from 4 days (at greater than 7 degrees C) to 26
   days (at 2.5 degrees C). Flowering onset was explained with an
   accumulated surface degree-day model. Bumblebees emerged when soil
   temperature reached 6 degrees C, which was predictable by an accumulated
   soil degree-day model, although foraging activity after emergence might
   depend on air temperature. These results indicate that phenological
   mismatch tends to occur when snow melts early but subsequent soil
   warming progresses slowly. Thus, modification of the snowmelt regime
   could be a major driver disturbing spring phenology in northern
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicide use has attracted attention recently due to potential damage
   to human health and lethality to the honey bees and other pollinators.
   Fenton reagent treatment processes can be applied for the degradation of
   herbicidal contaminants from water. However, the need to carry out the
   normal Fenton reactions under acidic conditions often hinders their
   practical application for pollution control. Herein, we report on the
   synthesis and application of multiphasic porous electro-Fenton catalysts
   prepared from calcinated metal-organic framework compounds, CMOF@PCM,
   and their application for the mineralization of herbicides in aqueous
   solution at circum-neutral pH. CMOF nanoparticles (NPs) are anchored on
   porous carbon monolithic (PCM) substrates, which allow for binder-free
   application. H2O2 is electrochemically generated on the PCM substrate
   which serves as a cathode, while center dot OH is generated by the CMOF
   NPs at low applied potentials (-0.14 V). Results show that the structure
   and reactivity of the CMOF@PCM electro-Fenton catalysts are dependent on
   the specific MOF precursor used during synthesis. For example,
   CMIL-88-NH2, which is prepared from MIL-88(Fe)-NH2, is a porous
   core-shell structured NP comprised of a cementite (Fe3C) intermediate
   layer that is sandwiched between a graphitic shell and a magnetite
   (Fe3O4) core. The electro-Fenton production of hydroxyl radical on the
   CMOF@PCM composite material is shown to effectively degrade an array of

Abstract = {{The East Himalaya is one of the world's most biodiverse ecosystems.
   However, very little is known about the abundance and distribution of
   many plant and animal taxa in this region. Bumble bees are a group of
   cold-adapted and high elevation insects that fulfil an important
   ecological and economical function as pollinators of wild and
   agricultural flowering plants and crops. The Himalayan mountain range
   provides ample suitable habitats for bumble bees. Systematic study of
   Himalayan bumble bees began a few decades ago and the main focus has
   centred on the western region, while the eastern part of the mountain
   range has received little attention and only a few species have been
   verified. During a three-year survey, more than 700 bumble bee specimens
   of 21 species were collected in Arunachal Pradesh, the largest of the
   north-eastern states of India. The material included a range of species
   that were previously known from a limited number of collected specimens,
   which highlights the unique character of the East Himalayan ecosystem.
   Our results are an important first step towards a future assessment of
   species distribution, threat, and conservation. Clear elevation patterns

Abstract = {{The factors that influence seed production and seed dormancy in rare
   plant species are crucial to their conservation yet are often poorly
   understood. In this study, we examined the breeding system and seed
   biology of the critically endangered Australian endemic species
   Persoonia pauciflora through a series of experiments. Pollinator
   visitation surveys and manipulative hand-pollination treatments were
   conducted to investigate the breeding system and subsequent seed
   production. We used an experimental seed burial to examine the breakdown
   of the woody endocarp and changes to germination over time. Seed
   germination response under simulated local seasonal conditions was also
   examined. Persoonia pauciflora was found to be predominantly pollinated
   by native bees, and cross-pollinated flowers produced significantly more
   mature fruit (18 +/- 3\%) than self-pollination treatments (2-3\%). The
   average strength of P. pauciflora pyrenes buried in soil significantly
   decreased over two years, from 413.3 +/- 14.6 N to 130.8 +/- 11.8 N.
   Post-burial seed germination was cyclical, with highest final
   germination percentage occurring following late-summer exhumations (75
   +/- 2\% and 74 +/- 14\%, respectively). When seeds were incubated under
   different local seasonal conditions, germination at local summer
   temperatures was more likely when compared with autumn/spring and winter
   temperature-incubated seeds. Our study highlights the importance of
   ensuring appropriate biotic pollen vectors are present in the local
   landscape for maximising viable fruit production for this species. In
   addition, our data indicate that recruitment will most likely occur
   after the endocarp has suitably weakened, allowing physiological
   dormancy of the embryo to be relaxed and germination to commence
   following summer temperatures.}},

   the chemical substances are complementary in the attractiveness of the

Abstract = {{The study investigated the occupation and emergence of bees that nest in

   In the four studied sites, a total of 185 artificial nests were offered

   distributed in five genera (Centris, Mesocheira, Euglossa, Megachile and
   Coelioxys) occupied the 34 trap-nests, but of this total nests, 24
   presented emergence of individuals. In the rest of the nests there was
   mortality of the occupants. Considering the total of nests with
   emergence, it was obtained 139 individuals: 131 bees (28 kleptoparasite
   bees) and 8 coleopterans. In 34 bee nests obtained, there were
   constructed 162 brood cells, the number of cells per trap-nest varied
   from 1 to 13 brood cells and the length of these nests varied from 2.4
   to 14cm. Thirteen nests were parasitized by hymenopterans (Apidae and

Abstract = {{Bumble bee pollinators can be exposed to pathogens when foraging on

   affects pathogens prior to being ingested by their host. We exposed the
   trypanosomatid gut pathogen, Crithidia bombi (Lipa \& Triggiani 1988)

   levels when consumed in hosts after infection, and citric acid is a
   common preservative found in citrus fruits and some honeys. We found
   that both citric acid and aucubin reduced Crithidia cell counts compared
   with controls. However, catalpol, nicotine, thymol, and anabasine did
   not have significant effects on Crithidia levels. These results suggest
   that Crithidia exposure in some floral nectars may reduce cell

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are generalist pollinators that typically collect floral
   rewards from a wide array of flowering plant species. Among the greatest
   threats to wild bumble bee populations worldwide, many of which are
   declining, is a loss of floral resource abundance and diversity in the
   landscapes they inhabit. We examined how composition of pollen diet
   impacts early nesting success in laboratory-reared queens of the bumble
   bee Bombus impatiens. Specifically, we provided queens and their young
   nests with one of three pollen diets, each of which was dominated by a
   single pollen type, and explored how this diet treatment influenced the
   length of time until queens initiated nests, total counts of brood in
   the nest at the end of the experiment (8 wk later), and the size and
   weight of adult offspring produced. We found that the amount of
   later-stage brood (pupae and/or adults) produced by recently-initiated
   nests was strongly impacted by pollen diet. For example, on average 66\%
   fewer later-stage brood were found in nests provided with the Cistus
   pollen Linnaeus (Cistaceae), relative to the predominantly Asteraceae
   pollen. This finding suggests that particular pollen diet compositions
   may delay larval growth, which delays colony development and may
   ultimately be detrimental for young nests. This study sheds light on how
   one of the leading stressors for bumble bees (nutritional stress) may
   negatively impact populations through its influence on brood production

   of the bumble bee (Bombus haemorrhoidalis Smith) (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   was analyzed and compared to honeybee pollination, hand-pollination,
   open-pollination and control (crop without pollinators) kiwifruit grown
   under insect proof nylon cages. Buzz pollination resulted in higher
   fruit set (79.43\%), longer fruits (59.56 mm/fruits), higher fruit
   breadth (40.58 mm/fruit), heavier fruits (68.14 g/fruit), higher total
   fruit yield (8.14 kg/vine), higher healthy fruits (94.60\%), higher seed
   number (560.13 seeds/fruit) and test weight (1.67 g!1000 seed) in
   kiwifruit and accounted an increase of 46.05, 41.53, 37.00, 180, 191.75,
   107.33, 25.34 and 57.54 per cent, respectively over control. Only A
   grade and B grade fruits were yielded in bumble bee pollinated fruit
   vines. Chemical parameters viz. TSS, TSS/acidity ratio, total sugars,
   reducing sugars and non-reducing sugars of kiwifruits were also found
   effected with buzz pollination. In kiwifruit, buzz pollination was
   observed as better mode of pollination next to hand pollination. Bumble
   bee (B. haemorrhoidalis) pollination proved superior over control (crop
   without pollinator), open/natural pollination and equally good (at par)
   to hand-pollination, with respect to all quantitative as well as
   qualitative parameters. The preliminary present studies indicate that
   bumble bee pollination is helpful to enhance the quality and quantity of
   kiwifruit and will definitely increase farmers' income.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of seed predation by phytophagous/parasitoid wasps on the
   reproductive output of aloes is relatively unknown. In this study,
   conducted at a nature reserve in Pretoria East, South Africa, the range
   of insects utilising Aloe pretoriensis (Asphodelaceae) fruits and/or
   seeds and the impact of this usage on its reproductive output were
   investigated. Using a GLMM, we explored the effects of morphological
   features (e.g. floral display size) and selected ecological factors
   (viz. distance between the aloes and conspecifics and other surrounding
   vegetation) on fruit utilisation and seed predation. A variety of insect
   visitors to A. pretoriensis (mainly bees and wasps) were identified
   including a number of seed predators and parasitoids. Evidence of
   phytophagy in dissected flowers showed increasing evidence of fruit
   utilisation and seed predation over an 8-week period. Emergence boxes
   with infructescences revealed a range of insect phytophages (and their
   associated parasitoids) in the aloe fruits and seeds: the drosophilid
   fly, Apenthecia and six species of wasp - five of them associated with
   ultilisation of aloe fruits/seeds for the first time: Eurytoma aloineae
   (Chalcididae), Mesopolobus sp., Pteromalus sp., and c.f. Chlorocytus in
   the Pteromalidae, Bracon sp. (Braconidae) and Pediobius (Eulophidae).
   Fruit set ranged between 48\% and 93\%, with an average of 76\%, while
   average percentage utilisation of fruits was 29\%, ranging between 7\%
   and 68\%. Average seed set was 23 seeds per fruit and average percentage
   seed predation 21\% (range: 0-51\%). Fruit utilisation was found to be
   significantly negatively correlated with distance to the nearest
   flowering bush (usually Helichrysum kraussii), but display size did not
   significantly affect fruit utilisation, nor did distance to
   conspecifics. Aloe pretoriensis thus serves as host to a variety of
   phytophagous insects and their associated parasitoids, which impacts
   considerably on its reproductive output with possible implications for
   the future conservation of this aloe species.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat degradation and climate change are currently threatening wild
   pollinators, compromising their ability to provide pollination services
   to wild and cultivated plants. Landscape genomics offers powerful tools
   to assess the influence of landscape modifications on genetic diversity
   and functional connectivity, and to identify adaptations to local
   environmental conditions that could facilitate future bee survival.
   Here, we assessed range-wide patterns of genetic structure, genetic
   diversity, gene flow, and local adaptation in the stingless bee Melipona
   subnitida, a tropical pollinator of key biological and economic
   importance inhabiting one of the driest and hottest regions of South
   America. Our results reveal four genetic clusters across the species'
   full distribution range. All populations were found to be under a
   mutation-drift equilibrium, and genetic diversity was not influenced by
   the amount of reminiscent natural habitats. However, genetic relatedness
   was spatially autocorrelated and isolation by landscape resistance
   explained range-wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by
   geographic distance, contradicting earlier findings for stingless bees.
   Specifically, gene flow was enhanced by increased thermal stability,
   higher forest cover, lower elevations, and less corrugated terrains.
   Finally, we detected genomic signatures of adaptation to temperature,
   precipitation, and forest cover, spatially distributed in latitudinal
   and altitudinal patterns. Taken together, our findings shed important
   light on the life history of M. subnitida and highlight the role of
   regions with large thermal fluctuations, deforested areas, and mountain
   ranges as dispersal barriers. Conservation actions such as restricting
   long-distance colony transportation, preserving local adaptations, and
   improving the connectivity between highlands and lowlands are likely to
   assure future pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The main selective force driving floral evolution and diversity is
   plant-pollinator interactions. Pollinators use floral signals and
   indirect cues to assess flower reward, and the ensuing flower choice has
   major implications for plant fitness. While many pollinator behaviors
   have been described, the impact of parasites on pollinator foraging
   decisions and plant-pollinator interactions have been largely
   overlooked. Growing evidence of the transmission of parasites through
   the shared-use of flowers by pollinators demonstrate the importance of
   behavioral immunity (altered behaviors that enhance parasite resistance)
   to pollinator health. During foraging bouts, pollinators can protect
   themselves against parasites through self-medication, disease avoidance,
   and grooming. Recent studies have documented immune behaviors in
   foraging pollinators, as well as the impacts of such behaviors on flower
   visitation. Because pollinator parasites can affect flower choice and
   pollen dispersal, they may ultimately impact flower fitness. Here, we
   discuss how pollinator immune behaviors and floral traits may affect the
   presence and transmission of pollinator parasites, as well as how
   pollinator parasites, through these immune behaviors, can impact
   plant-pollinator interactions. We further discuss how pollinator immune
   behaviors can impact plant fitness, and how floral traits may adapt to
   optimize plant fitness in response to pollinator parasites. We propose
   future research directions to assess the role of pollinator parasites in
   plant-pollinator interactions and evolution, and we propose better
   integration of the role of pollinator parasites into research related to
   pollinator optimal foraging theory, floral diversity and agricultural
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Male orchid bees (Euglossini) collect volatiles from their environment
   to concoct species-specific perfumes, which are later emitted at mating
   sites. Intensity, complexity or composition of perfumes may encode age
   (survival) of a male, but how the individual perfume develops over time
   needs to be clarified. We investigated chemical changes during storage
   in leg pockets. We injected a mixture of eight perfume compounds into
   pockets of Euglossa imperialis and only the two most volatile compounds
   decreased over 12 days. Using a different approach we found significant
   shifts in quantities of naturally occurring perfume compounds of
   Euglossa championi over 10days, with the strongest decreases (up to 70\%
   peak area) in highly volatile minor compounds, e.g. monoterpenes, and
   noteworthy increases (up to 40\%) in some sesquiterpenoids.
   Corresponding shifts were observed in legs of dried bees, suggesting
   that no metabolic activity is required for the observed changes to
   occur. Our results confirm that male orchid bees are generally good at
   preserving collected perfumes. However, subtle shifts towards heavier
   compounds in blends may occur over the lifetime of individual bees, e.g.
   due to evaporation or in-pocket chemical reaction, with old males
   acquiring a more pronounced base note in their seasoned perfumes.}},

Abstract = {{Large carpenter bees are charismatic and ubiquitous flower visitors in
   the tropics and sub-tropics. Unlike honeybees and bumblebees that have
   been popular subjects of extensive studies on their neuroethology,
   behaviour and ecology, carpenter bees have received little attention.
   This review integrates what is known about their foraging behaviour as
   well as sensory, physiological and cognitive adaptations and is
   motivated by their versatility as flower visitors and pollinators. This
   is evident from their extremely generalist foraging and adeptness at
   handling diverse flower types as legitimate pollinators and as
   illegitimate nectar robbers. They purportedly use traplining to forage
   between isolated patches and are long-distance flyers over several
   kilometres suggesting well-developed spatial learning, route memory and
   navigational capabilities. They have a broad range of temperature
   tolerance and thermoregulatory capabilities which are likely employed in
   their forays into crepuscular and nocturnal time periods. Such temporal
   extensions into dim-light periods invoke a suite of visual adaptations
   in their apposition optics. Thus, we propose that carpenter bees are an
   excellent though understudied group for exploring the complex nature of
   plant-pollinator mutualisms from ecological and mechanistic

Abstract = {{Bumblebees Bombus terrestris are good at learning to distinguish between
   patterned flowers. They can differentiate between flowers that differ

   bumblebees trained to discriminate between nonvisual scent patterns can
   transfer this learning to visually patterned flowers that show similar
   spatial patterning to the learnt scent patterns. Bumblebees can,
   therefore, transfer learnt patterns between different sensory
   modalities, without needing to relearn them. We used differential
   conditioning techniques to explore whether cross-modal transfer of
   learnt patterns also occurred between visual and temperature patterns.
   Bumblebees that successfully learnt to distinguish rewarding and
   unrewarding temperature patterns did not show any preferences for the
   corresponding unlearnt visual pattern. Similarly, bumblebees that learnt
   visual patterns did not transfer these to temperature patterns,
   suggesting that they are unable to transfer learning of temperature and

Abstract = {{Different enantiomers of chiral compounds within floral perfumes usually
   trigger distinct responses in insects; however, this has frequently been
   neglected in studies investigating semiochemicals in plant-pollinator
   interactions. Approximately 1000 neotropical plants produce floral
   perfumes as the only reward for pollinators, i.e. male euglossine bees.
   The chiral compound carvone epoxide is a key component of the scent
   bouquet of many perfume-rewarding plants that are pollinated by males of
   Eulaema. Here, we tested the biological activity of the four carvone
   epoxide stereoisomers to four Eulaema species occurring in the Atlantic
   Rainforest of NE-Brazil. We determined the stereochemistry of carvone
   epoxide in the floral scent of several Catasetum species, tested whether
   the antennae of bees respond differentially to these stereoisomers and
   investigated if there is a behavioural preference for any of the
   stereoisomers. We found that 1) Catasetum species emit only the
   (-)-trans-stereoisomer of carvone epoxide, 2) for E. atleticana and E.
   niveofasciata antennal responses to the (-)-trans-carvone epoxide were
   significantly stronger than those to (-)-cis-carvone epoxide, 3) the
   strength and pattern of antennal responses to all 4 stereoisomers
   (separately tested) did not differ among Eulaema species, and 4) there
   were significant differences in attractiveness of the four stereoisomers
   to the bees species with the (-)-trans-stereoisomer being particularly
   attractive. We assume (-)-trans-carvone epoxide to be the dominant
   isomer in perfume-rewarding plants pollinated by Eulaema. The universal
   occurrence of carvone epoxide in Catasetum species pollinated by
   Eulaema, suggests that this compound has evolved in perfume-rewarding as
   a specific attractant for Eulaema bees as pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are highly social pollinators in tropical ecosystems.
   Besides floral pollen and nectar, they collect substantial amounts of
   plant resins, which are used for nest construction/maintenance and
   defence against antagonists. Moreover, some stingless bees extract
   chemical compounds from resins and incorporate them in their cuticular
   chemical profiles, rendering this trait directly dependent on the plant
   community of the surrounding environment. While previous studies have
   investigated how variation in the composition and diversity of available
   resin sources affect resin storages inside hives, subsequent effects on
   the bees' cuticular chemistry have not been studied. To fill this gap,
   we investigatedthe number, proportion and composition of compounds in
   the cuticular chemical profile of an Australian stingless bee using gas
   chromatography and mass spectrometry. We analysed whether and (if so)
   how the cuticular chemistry was affected by habitat (i.e., plantations,
   forests, and gardens) and tree species richness. We found that overall
   numbers and proportions of self-produced and resin-derived compounds in
   the cuticular chemical profiles of Tetragonula carbonaria were similar
   across habitats, while the composition of all compounds (i.e., both
   self-produced and resin-derived) and of resin-derived compounds differed
   between habitats. This indicates that the surrounding tree species
   community and thus available resin chemistry affected the composition of
   particularly resin-derived compounds on the bees' cuticle. As the number
   and composition of resin-derived cuticular compounds were not affected
   by tree species richness, stingless bees appear to selectively
   incorporate specific compounds available in the surrounding environment
   in their cuticular chemical profiles, which mayincrease their defensive
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Bee-friendly plants are defined by the quantity of food they produce and
   the visitation rates of adult insects foraging for nectar. However, it
   is pollen nutritional quality that enables proper larval development of
   bees, affecting their populations. Not all plants produce pollen that
   satisfies the nutritional requirements of bee larvae, and we lack an
   understanding of how different plant pollens impact bee nutritional
   demands. This study examined whether nutritionally desirable key plant
   species may promote wild bee larval development, which is essential if
   the population is to thrive. The generalist solitary mason bee Osmia
   bicornis L. was used as a model species to examine differences between
   bee larva nutritional demand and host plant nutrient supply; an
   ecological stoichiometry framework was applied. The stoichiometric
   ratios of 12 elements were investigated in bee bodies and cocoons
   (reflecting nutritional demand) and in the pollen supplied by the mother
   (nutritional supply; N = 15 x 2 sexes). Similarly, the stoichiometry of
   62 pollen taxa, including native, alien, and garden plants and crops,
   was compared with the bee demand based on the literature. Compared to
   males, females had higher demands for P, Cu and Zn and were supplied
   with pollen richer in these elements. Therefore, when collecting pollen
   for their progeny, Osmia provides daughters and sons with different
   pollen mixtures, reflecting sex-specific nutritional demand. Bees may be
   limited by the availability of P, Na, Mn, Mg, K, Fe, Ca, Zn and Cu, with
   high taxonomic variability in their concentrations in pollen. Female
   fitness may be particularly related to a high proportion of P in the
   diet. Synthesis and applications. Access to key plant species that allow
   nutritionally balanced larval diets may be essential for bee
   development, whether food is gathered intentionally or randomly. Such
   plant species-and not only those rich in nectar and pollen-should be
   promoted in wild bee conservation efforts, including planting flower
   strips and hedgerows. Bee-friendly plants should not be defined and
   planted solely based on the quantities of food they produce and on the
   visitation rates of adult insects foraging for energy.}},

Abstract = {{Communication between plants and nocturnal pollinators in low light
   conditions is mainly guided by floral scents, which is well documented
   for plants pollinated by bats, moths, and beetles. Just recently,
   nocturnal bees have been added to the list of pollinators known to
   respond to floral scents of their host plants. Little is known about the
   floral scent chemistry of plants visited and pollinated by nocturnal
   bees. Among these plants are economically important fruit crops of the
   family Myrtaceae. We aimed to analyze the nocturnal floral scent
   profiles of 10 species of Myrtaceae (only diurnal P. cattleianum was
   sampled after sunrise) and address the following questions: i) What are
   the main floral scent compounds emitted by the species? ii) Are the
   floral scent profiles similar to those described for other species
   pollinated by nocturnal bees? Floral scents were collected by dynamic
   headspace and analyzed by GC-MS (gas chromatography - mass
   spectrometry). The total amount of scent trapped ranged from 74
   ng/flower/hour for Syzygium malaccense to 7556 ng/flower/hour for
   Eugenia dysenterica. A total of 46 floral scent compounds were detected
   in the samples with the most abundant compounds being the aromatics
   benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, methyl salicylate,
   2-phenylethyl acetate, and benzyl acetate; the aliphatic compound
   1-octanol; and the monoterpene linalool. The different species exhibited
   different relative scent patterns. Overall, the nocturnal scents of the
   studied species of Myrtaceae are dominated by aromatic compounds, which
   is in contrast to the scent profiles described for other plants

   by larger animals such as sunbirds. The sturdy inflorescence stem, and
   thick fleshy perianth tissue, orange-red colour of the flowers, low
   scent production and large viscidia, are traits shared with other,
   distantly related bird-pollinated Satyrium species and can therefore be
   considered likely to play a functional role in bird pollination. We
   previously made anecdotal observations of sunbird visits to this orchid

Abstract = {{Given the decline of pollinators around the world, preserving these
   animals has become a priority. This is especially urgent in threatened
   areas that concentrate high biodiversity such as the Atlantic forest
   (AF) in South America. Orchid bees are among the most important
   pollinators in the AF and are considered as good biological indicators
   of environmental quality. However, the populations of these bees have
   been reduced in size as a result of environmental impacts caused by
   human activities. In the present study, we used historical climate
   modelling to infer the refuge areas within the AF that concentrate high
   genetic diversity of orchid bees. From a total of 235 records of ten
   species, we built species models for the current days, Mid-Holocene and
   Last Glacial Maximum periods using MaxEnt program. Our results show
   refuge areas separately for each species, which may harbor their high
   levels of individual genetic diversity in the AF. On the other hand, the
   assemblage-scale model of climate stability shows a large continuous
   range of suitable areas from the southern to the northern AF, divided
   into three main stability zones (northeastern, central and
   southeastern-southern) where putatively are concentrated high levels of
   genetic diversity for most of these bees. This inference of stability
   zones should be useful to direct the choice of new conservation units in
   the AF, mainly in the northern portion of the AF, where the zone of
   greater suitability for orchid bees analyzed is present, which has been
   under protected and has experienced an increase of deforestation in the
   recent years. Finally, we point out that phylogeographic studies with
   these bees are necessary and might validate our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Agroforestry has the potential to provide multiple products and services
   from agricultural land, including bioenergy feedstock and habitat for
   wild bees. Our goal is to assess how variation in alley crop
   composition, landscape configuration, and total agroforestry area
   affects wild bee habitat in Illinois. First, different agroforestry
   crops may provide different floral and nesting resources for bees.
   Second, policy and economic factors may affect the total area and
   configuration of land devoted to agroforestry within a landscape. Third,
   farmers' operational preferences will affect area and configuration;
   they may be more willing to convert entire fields to agroforestry than
   to convert small patches within fields. We use the Lonsdorf model, a
   spatially explicit assessment of bee abundance, to model how wild bee
   habitat in hypothetical alternatives to an Illinois landscape is
   affected by alley crop composition (willow and row crops or willow and
   prairie), landscape configuration (alley cropping in subfield patches or
   in entire fields), and total alley crop area (12, 24, or 29\% of the
   agricultural land). Our results indicate that the alley crop composition
   and area are important influences on the modeled nesting bee abundance
   index at the scale of both the landscape and the field. Although the
   configuration of agroforestry plantings significantly predicts bee
   abundance at the field scale, it is not an important factor when
   assessing bee abundance at the level of the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological models for multihost pathogen systems often classify
   individuals taxonomically and use species-specific parameter values, but
   in species-rich communities that approach may require intractably many
   parameters. Trait-based epidemiological models offer a potential
   solution but have not accounted for within-species trait variation or
   between-species trait overlap. Here we propose and study trait-based
   models with host and vector communities represented as trait
   distributions without regard to species identity. To illustrate this
   approach, we develop susceptible-infectious-susceptible models for
   disease spread in plant-pollinator networks with continuous trait
   distributions. We model trait-dependent contact rates in two common
   scenarios: nested networks and specialized plant-pollinator interactions
   based on trait matching. We find that disease spread in plant-pollinator
   networks is impacted the most by selective pollinators, universally
   attractive flowers, and cospecialized plant-pollinator pairs. When
   extreme pollinator traits are rare, pollinators with common traits are
   most important for disease spread, whereas when extreme flower traits
   are rare, flowers with uncommon traits impact disease spread the most.
   Greater nestedness and specialization both typically promote disease
   persistence. Given recent pollinator declines caused in part by
   pathogens, we discuss how trait-based models could inform conservation
   strategies for wild and managed pollinators. Furthermore, while we have
   applied our model to pollinators and pathogens, its framework is general
   and can be transferred to any kind of species interactions in any
   community.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Floral scents can act as important contributing factors to plant
   reproductive isolation mediated by pollinators. Plants may utilize fetid
   floral odors that specifically lure saprophilous flies seeking high
   protein content substrates, such as dung or carrion, to reach sexual
   maturity or as food sources for their larvae. In this work, we used
   baits with fetid volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are produced
   during the decay of animal protein substrates (oligosulfides and a
   fermented bone-meal blend) to evaluate the role that olfactory signals
   may have played in the shift to saprophilous fly pollination in species
   of the nightshade genus Jaborosa Juss. Traps with the fetid baits
   attracted the same assemblage of saprophilous fly species that were
   recorded pollinating the flowers in different populations of the
   Andean-distributed species J. laciniata, whereas no flies were attracted
   to the control traps using mineral oil. Furthermore, the addition of
   oligosulfides to flowers of J. integrifolia, a lowland distributed
   species pollinated by nocturnal hawkmoths, resulted in the nearly
   immediate attraction of saprophilous flies (mainly Calliphoridae) to the
   flowers. These results provide evidence that the emission of fetid
   floral VOCs is sufficient to attract flies to flowers irrespective of
   other flower features and geographic region. This suggests that the
   evolutionary shift to saprophilous fly pollination in the genus Jaborosa
   could have been initiated with novel floral visitors attracted by the
   emission of fetid VOCs and then followed by major changes in other
   flower traits such as corolla color and morphology to optimize pollen
   export and placement.}},

   North-eastern USA. Time period The sampling was done over 15 years
   (2001-2015). Major taxa studied Apoidea. Methods We used an
   unprecedented extensive dataset of >15,000 bee specimens, comprising
   more than 400 species collected across north-east USA. We extracted
   habitat information from the sample points and used network analyses,

Abstract = {{Growing interest in urban agriculture has increased demand for

   do not consider the impacts of fine-scale urban land-use practices on
   the dynamics of pollination delivery, leaving a critical gap in our
   understanding of the pollinator supply-demand balance in urban
   landscapes. This study demonstrates a spatially-explicit framework,
   using Iowa City, IA (USA) as the case study region, for assessing the
   capacity of urban ecosystems to produce pollinator services in support
   of demand from urban agriculture. We estimate pollinator supply using
   the InVEST pollination model with detailed land-cover data produced
   through field survey and Bayesian hierarchical analysis, and we validate
   modeling results with bee abundance and richness data. We map social
   demand for pollinators using a kernel density estimation of urban
   agricultural sites and evaluate supply-demand budgets through spatial
   overlay analysis. Our results show that incorporating
   high-thematic-resolution urban land-use data substantially improves the
   performance of pollination supply modeling. Pollinator supply meets
   demand in 72\% of the city. Surpluses occur in natural areas and
   heavily-vegetated, established residential neighborhoods, whereas
   deficits occur in resource-poor lawns. Our mapping framework stresses
   the key role of humans in modifying resource availability and pollinator
   services, and demonstrates the effectiveness of using disaggregated
   socio-economic data in urban land-cover classification for predicting
   pollinator supply. Our improved ability to identify spatial congruence
   and disparities in urban pollinator supply and demand can be used to
   inform pollinator conservation to support sustainable urban agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{This project, as part of adissertation on floral biology of the wild
   service tree, provided the following results: 1)The wild service tree
   Sorbus torminalis of the Rosaceae family either grows as asolitary
   deciduous broad-leaf forest tree, mainly in France (Alsace) or Austria
   (near Vienna), or in orchards as aspur grafted on dwarfing quince
   rootstock. 2)The white self-fertile flower aims at the widest possible
   range of potential pollinators and offers easy access to tits nectar.
   The nectar has two distinct smells, one of honey, which attracts bees,
   and one of rotting material, which attracts flies. The anthers contained
   ample fertile pollen, apre-requisite for effective pollination, but also
   for solitary bees, who spend most of their time collecting pollen, which
   is mixed with asmall amount of nectar as food supply for their young. In
   the present experiment, Sorbust. pollination was by bumble bees, honey
   bees, solitary bees, except for the solitary Osmia bees, possibly due to
   lack of nesting structures. 3)A local pollination experiment in the Bonn
   region showed the greatest number of seeds per fruit, as ameasure of the
   pollination success, with manual cross-pollination. The pollination
   success rate of the free blooming control flowers, to which the flower
   visitors had free access, was similar to that of the manual
   self-pollination. This suggests there was alimited supply of pollen,
   probably caused by insufficient pollinators, although atotal of
   88species was counted on the flowers. 4)The red-brown, cherry-sized
   fruits are difficult to pick from the large solitary trees by long
   ladders. The fruits contained up to five seeds, responsible for the
   marzipan-like taste on fruit processing. Due to the astringent taste of
   the fresh fruit, they might be more suitable for bread spreads,
   preserves, jam, distilling into brandy and dried fruit for ahealthy
   snack. 5)Challenges of Sorbus torminalis cultivation include
   a)determination of the optimum harvest date (OHD) and uniform
   maturation, b)rootstock selection for dwarfing and early yield and
   c)countermeasures against alternate/biennial bearing. 6)Advantages of
   Sorbus torminalis cultivation include tolerance to frost in the winter
   and to drought in the summer and hence climate resilience and increase
   in biodiversity.}},

   habitat-generalist plant and pollinator species. We found that plant and
   pollinator species of the two different grassland communities were
   highly interconnected, revealing that pollination interactions occur at
   a level of organization above that of the single community. The
   co-occurrence of the two grassland communities increased the type,
   number and frequency of contacts, thereby contributing to networks
   stability. The role of habitat-specialist and habitat-generalist plant
   and pollinator species in pollination networks was asymmetric, with
   habitat-specialist plants and habitat-generalist pollinators being
   keystone species, while habitat-generalist plants and habitat-specialist
   pollinators being peripheral in the pollination networks. Our results
   showed that the stability of the network does stem from the
   co-occurrence of different species pools having different but
   complementary roles in the pollination networks. From a conservation
   perspective, the maintenance of different grassland communities is
   important not only because they allow the conservation of
   habitat-specialist species, but specifically because plant species
   specialized in either grassland community are also keystone for the
   maintenance of the stability of the pollination networks.}},

Abstract = {{The limited information available on aroid reproductive systems suggests
   that most species are visited and pollinated by arthropods, especially
   bees, beetles, and flies. However, hummingbirds and passerine birds have
   been reported to visit some Colombian Anthurium that retain many typical
   aroid traits. Observations in upper montane cloud forests (2700 m) on
   the eastern slope of the Andes in northern Ecuador revealed a third
   Anthurium species visited by birds. Male-phase inflorescence features
   that seemed to favor bird visitation included a robust and all red
   inflorescence, and copious fluid secretions that appeared to have
   nutritive value. Over a weeklong period, at least four species of
   hummingbird and one passerine bird, a flowerpiercer, were observed to
   pick up pollen when they fed on the fluid secretions during repeated
   visits to a male-phase inflorescence. The bird-plant interaction
   depended on species-specific foraging methods, rank in the local
   dominance hierarchy, and diel activity patterns. In addition, several
   arthropod taxa were documented as Anthurium visitors for the first time.
   We consider the potential for a bird or a mixed pollination system of

Abstract = {{Honeybees (HB) are strongly attracted to lychee flowers and serve as the
   main pollen vector in most lychee orchards throughout the world. Despite
   precise protocols for managing HB in Israeli lychee orchards, we
   suspected that the full pollination potential of the orchards was not
   being achieved and that yields could be increased. Since bumblebees (BB)
   forage in harsh weather and at lower temperatures than HB, in previous
   studies we questioned if adding BB to HB in apple and pear orchards
   would increase fruit set and yield. Encouraged by the important results,
   we examined this approach in lychee in the present work. The experiments
   were conducted for three years, resulting in a significant increase in
   lychee fruit set and yield. Our observations revealed that BB contribute
   to lychee pollination not only because they are active in conditions
   that HB are not, but also because HB collect mainly nectar from the
   lychee flowers and barely contact the reproductive organs, while BB
   collect mainly pollen and hence pollination increases. As a result of
   this work, since 2018 10 BB hives per hectare have been introduced into
   many lychee orchards in Israel in addition to the standard 2.5 HB hives

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases are a primary driver of bee decline worldwide, but
   limited understanding of how pathogens are transmitted hampers effective
   management. Flowers have been implicated as hubs of bee disease
   transmission, but we know little about how interspecific floral
   variation affects transmission dynamics. Using bumblebees (Bombus
   impatiens), a trypanosomatid pathogen (Crithidia bombi) and three plant
   species varying in floral morphology, we assessed how host infection and
   plant species affect pathogen deposition on flowers, and plant species
   and flower parts impact pathogen survival and acquisition at flowers. We
   found that host infection with Crithidia increased defaecation rates on
   flowers, and that bees deposited faeces onto bracts of Lobelia
   siphilitica and Lythrum salicaria more frequently than onto Monarda
   didyma bracts. Among flower parts, bracts were associated with the
   lowest pathogen survival but highest resulting infection intensity in
   bee hosts. Additionally, we found that Crithidia survival across flower
   parts was reduced with sun exposure. These results suggest that
   efficiency of pathogen transmission depends on where deposition occurs
   and the timing and place of acquisition, which varies among plant
   species and environmental conditions. This information could be used for
   development of wildflower mixes that maximize forage while minimizing

Abstract = {{The problem of pollination is unique among a wide scope of search
   problems, since it requires optimization of benefits for both the

   search time and number of visited plants as functions of the
   distribution of nectar in the plant population and of the probability
   that a pollinator will leave the plant after examining a flower, thus
   effectively restarting the search. We demonstrate that nectar variation
   in plants serves as a driving force for pollination and establish
   conditions required for optimal pollination, which provides an efficient
   pollinator search strategy and the maximum number of plants visited by
   the pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Pollinators often drive the evolution of floral
   traits, but their capacity to influence the evolution of pollen colour
   remains unclear. Pollen colour in Campanula americana is variable and
   displays a longitudinal cline from prevalence of deep purple in western
   populations to white and light-purple pollen in eastern populations.
   While selection for thermal tolerance probably underlies darker pollen
   in the west, factors contributing to the predominance of light pollen in
   eastern populations and the maintenance of colour variation within
   populations throughout the range are unknown. Here we examine whether
   pollinators contribute to the maintenance of pollen colour variation in
   C. americana.
   Methods In a flight cage experiment, we assessed whether Bombus
   impatiens foragers can use pollen colour as a reward cue. We then
   established floral arrays that varied in the frequency of white-and
   purple-pollen plants in two naturally occurring eastern populations. We
   observed foraging patterns of wild bees, totalling >1100 individual
   visits.
   Key Results We successfully trained B. impatiens to prefer one pollen
   colour morph. In natural populations, the specialist pollinator,
   Megachile campanulae, displayed a strong and consistent preference for
   purple-pollen plants regardless of morph frequency. Megachile also
   exhibited a bias toward pollen-bearing male-phase flowers, and this bias
   was more pronounced for purple pollen. The other main pollinators,
   Bombus spp. and small bees, did not display pollen colour preference.
   Conclusions Previous research found that Megachile removes twice as much
   pollen per visit as other bees and can deplete pollen from natural
   populations. Taken together, these results suggest that Megachile could
   reduce the reproductive success of plants with purple pollen, resulting
   in the prevalence of light-coloured pollen in eastern populations of C.
   americana. Our research demonstrates that pollinator preferences may
   play a role in the maintenance of pollen colour variation in natural
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mating system and allele dispersal through pollen and seeds
   influence population genetic constitution and are directly associated
   with structure and diversity. Petunia secreta is a rare and endemic
   species that is characterised by high levels of genetic variability and,
   despite being dependent on bee-pollination, its breeding system is
   unknown. Aims: In order to understand how a rare and narrowly
   distributed species presents levels of genetic diversity compatible with
   that of widely distributed congeneric species, the aims of this study
   were to investigate the mating system of P. secreta; to evaluate its
   pollen and seed dispersal; and to estimate the level of inbreeding.
   Methods: We geographically mapped and genotyped all adult individuals
   from the type origin of P. secreta during one reproductive season and
   125 offspring originating from 11 mother plants at nine polymorphic
   microsatellite loci and using population genetics tools and paternity
   analysis. Results: No geographical structure was observed in adult
   individuals. The species has mixed mating system, with predominant
   self-fertilisation and few outcrossing events. All outcrossing events
   occurred within the respective maternal plant's collection site. High,
   positive F-is values were observed among adult plants, and inbreeding
   depression was observed in progenies. Conclusions: In the long term, the
   main threat for this species consists of the high level of inbreeding
   depression resulting mainly from the biparental inbreeding, which
   affects the genetic diversity. These results should be considered in the
   development of strategies for in situ species conservation.}},

Journal = {{PLANT DIRECT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The invasion success of Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) in
   certain parts of Europe and North America has been partially attributed
   to its ability to compete for bee pollinators with its rich nectar and
   due to its capacity to produce and release allelopathic
   1,4-naphthoquinones (1,4-NQs) from its roots and leaves. Given that
   other 1,4-NQs present in the digestive fluids of certain carnivorous
   plants are proposed to control microbial colonization, we investigated
   the potential for the 1,4-NQs, 2-methoxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (2-MNQ) and
   lawsone, to fulfill an analogous role in the nectaries of I.
   glandulifera. Both 2-MNQ and lawsone were detected in the floral
   nectaries of I. glandulifera at levels comparable to leaves and roots,
   but were discovered to be at significantly higher levels in its
   extra-floral nectaries (EFNs) and to be present in EFN nectar itself.
   Nectar microbe inhibition assays revealed that the common nectar
   bacteria Gluconobacter oxydans and Asaia prunellae are not inhibited by
   2-MNQ or lawsone, although both compounds were found to inhibit the
   growth of the common fungal nectar microbes Metschnikowia reukaufii and
   Aureobasidium pullulans. Taken together, these findings suggest that
   2-MNQ and lawsone could serve to protect the rich nectar of I.
   glandulifera against fungal growth. The high abundance of 2-MNQ and
   lawsone in I. glandulifera EFNs may also point to an unsuspected
   mechanism for how allelopathic 1,4-NQs are leached into the soil where
   they exhibit their known allelopathic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination by animals presents important advantages for plant
   reproduction. However, relying on biotic pollen dispersers also exposes
   plants to challenges, which include, for instance, the need to match the
   ecologies and phenologies of the pollinator species. Because of their
   ecological simplicity, specialized pollination systems are useful models
   to understand some of the variables that modulate how zoophilous
   pollination evolves, and whether or not species involved in pollination
   interactions respond jointly to evolutionary or ecological processes. In
   this study, we used a combination of field work, species distribution
   modeling (SDM), and geospatial analyses to investigate whether the
   number of floral visits by different pollinators in specialized
   zoophilous pollination interactions is correlated with the climatic
   suitability of the pollinator insects and, thus, to insect potential
   abundance. To do this, we investigated the pollination biology of four
   Calceolaria L. (Calceolariacea) species from central Chile, and we
   sampled across their whole ranges. Our results indicate that the four
   plant species are pollinated by different oilbees of genera Centris
   Fabricius (Apidae: Centridini) and Chalepogenus Holmberg (Apidae:
   Tapinotaspidini), and that the number of floral visits varies at
   different localities. Our SDMs were accurate, successfully recovering
   the known ranges of the pollinators. Our analyses indicated that most
   plant species occur at localities in which insect climatic suitabilities
   are high. Furthermore, the number of pollinator visits at each locality
   was significantly and positively correlated with the insect suitability
   values, suggesting that matching high suitability areas can indeed
   increase the reproductive success of the plants.}},

Abstract = {{Dioecy is rare among flowering plants, and is associated with a high
   frequency of threatened species. Dioecious plants are often pollinated
   by wind or insects, but are susceptible to pollination failure should
   male and female plants become spatially separated, or should pollinator
   abundance decline. Here we characterize the plant-pollinator
   interactions of Rhus michauxii Sarg (Sapindales: Anacardiaceae), an
   endangered dioecious shrub endemic to the southeastern United States.
   Working in the sandhills region of North Carolina, we detected a diverse
   community of arthropods visiting R. michauxii flowers, including 55
   species or morphospecies, with moderate niche overlap between male and
   female flowers. Although most visitors acquired pollen from male
   flowers, pollen loads were greatly reduced or diluted on visitors to
   female flowers; conspecific pollen was completely absent at all-female
   sites. Bees in the genus Megachile appear to be the most important
   pollen vectors in this system because of their abundance and pollen load
   composition. We constructed a regional pollen transport network
   involving 73 arthropod species and 46 pollen species/morphotypes, in
   which R. michauxii participated in 10\% of links and attracted 38\% of
   individual visitors, suggesting that it competes successfully with other
   plants for visitation. Finally, time-lapse videography revealed that
   female inflorescences were visited about six times less often than male
   inflorescences, but at similar times of day. Despite overall high rates
   of bee visitation, pollen movement from male to female plants was
   uncommon, and restoration of sexual reproduction in this species may
   require hand pollination or translocation of suitable mates to
   single-sex sites.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the long-term consequences of habitat alteration for the
   preservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function requires an
   understanding of how ecological filters drive taxonomic and functional
   biodiversity loss. Here, we test a set of predictions concerning the
   role of ecological filters in restructuring native bee assemblages
   inhabiting fragmented coastal sage scrub ecosystems in southern
   California, USA. In 2011 and 2012, we collected native bees in scrub
   habitat belonging to two treatment categories: large natural reserves
   and small habitat fragments embedded in an urban landscape. We compared
   bee assemblages in reserve and fragment sites with respect to their
   taxonomic and functional alpha diversity, beta diversity, assemblage
   composition, and mean geographical range size estimated via distribution
   maps compiled for this study from digitized specimen records. We found
   multiple lines of evidence that ecological filtering drove bee diversity
   loss in fragments: a disproportionate loss of functional diversity
   relative to taxonomic diversity, shifts in assemblage composition driven
   largely by the preferential extirpation of reserve-associated indicator
   species, and disproportionate loss of range-restricted species. However,
   we found no evidence of taxonomic or functional homogenization across
   fragment bee assemblages, suggesting that filtering was not sufficiently
   strong to cause a subset of functional traits (and their associated
   species) to dominate assemblages in fragments. Our results suggest that
   ecological filtering altered bee assemblages in habitat fragments, even
   when such fragments contained well-preserved native plant assemblages,
   underscoring the importance of preserving large areas of natural habitat
   for the conservation of bees (especially range-restricted taxa) and
   their associated ecological functions.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal is central to the ecology and evolution of spatially

   microbes among floral organs is unknown. Pollinators are recognized as
   key microbial vectors, but effects of their different foraging behaviors
   on transfer dynamics among flowers or different floral organs are not
   known. We asked how foraging behaviors of a model pollinator (Bombus
   impatiens) affect acquisition and dispersal of microbes among flower
   organs. We used monkeyflowers (Mimulus guttatus) to examine dispersal
   within a natural context and artificial flowers to test how common bee
   foraging behaviors (nectaring, buzzing, or scrabbling) shaped dispersal
   of a green fluorescent protein-labeled bacteria, Pseudomonas
   fluorescens. Bees acquired 1\% of a flower's microbes and dispersed 31\%
   of acquired microbes to the next flower. All bees acquired microbes, and
   85\% and 76\% of bees dispersed microbes to live and artificial flowers,
   respectively. Microbes acquired from the corolla were mainly deposited
   on the corolla, followed by the stamens, and least on the
   nectary/pistil. Bee foraging behavior affected acquisition, with
   scrabbling for pollen resulting in 23\% more microbes acquired than
   nectaring, and with buzzing for pollen resulting in a 79\% slower rate
   of microbial acquisition relative to scrabbling. Bee foraging behavior
   also affected deposition but depended on the floral organ: Scrabbling

Abstract = {{Communication is often vital to the maintenance of mutualisms. In
   plant-pollinator mutualisms, plants signal pollinators via floral
   displays, composed of olfactory, visual, and other plant-derived cues.
   While plants are understood to be associated with microbes, only
   recently has the role of microbial (yeast and bacteria) inhabitants of
   flowers as intermediaries of plant-pollinator communication been
   recognized. Animals frequently use microbial cues to find resources, yet
   no study has examined whether microbes directly mediate learned and
   innate pollinator responses. Here, we asked whether microbes on the
   flower surface, independent of their modification of floral rewards, can
   mediate these key components of pollinator preference. In the field, we
   characterized flower and bumble bee microbial abundance, and in
   laboratory assays we tested whether bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)
   discriminated flowers on the basis of an experimental floral microbial
   community on the petals and whether microbe-derived chemicals were
   effective cues. Learning of microbial community cues was associative and
   reward context-dependent and mediated by microbial chemicals.
   Deconstructing the experimental microbial community showed bees innately
   avoided flowers with bacteria, but were undeterred by yeast. Microbial
   cues thus potentially facilitate dynamic communication between plants
   and pollinators such as bumble bees, especially as pollinator visitation
   can change flower microbiota. We suggest that the study of communication
   in mutualism generally would benefit by considering not only the
   multicellular eukaryote partners, but their microbial associates.
   Microbes on flower surfaces can mediate plant-pollinator communication.
   We demonstrate that an experimental community of yeast and bacteria on
   artificial and live flowers can directly mediate the learned floral
   preferences of bees. Bacteria, but not yeast, mediated innate
   preference. Preferences were directly mediated by microbial chemicals
   and did not require modification of the floral reward. We showed
   microbes were abundant on flowers and floral microbes may therefore
   potentially widely facilitate communication between plants and
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{ContextBumblebees are important pollinators for agricultural crops and
   wild plants. However, agricultural intensification and loss of
   semi-natural habitat may have adverse effects on colony performance.
   While mass-flowering crops may serve as food sources, landscapes
   dominated by intensive agriculture may be a poor bumblebee habitat
   compared to landscapes dominated by semi-natural habitat, such as
   forests and species-rich grasslands.ObjectivesWe investigated the effect
   of different land use classes on bumblebee colony performance at two
   periods of time during the flying season. We expected mass-flowering
   crops to have a positive influence on colony performance during
   flowering. After mass-flowering, presence of semi-natural habitat was
   hypothesized to be essential for colony development.MethodsWe placed
   artificial colonies of Bombus terrestris in 28 apple and pear orchards
   during and after mass-flowering. We measured colony growth and took
   pollen samples from foraging workers. Causal relationships between
   land-use, pollen quality, amount of pollen collected and colony
   performance were analyzed.ResultsContrary to our expectations, we found
   a negative correlation between orchard cover and amount of pollen
   collected in spring, during mass-flowering, resulting in a lower colony
   performance. During mass-flowering, colony performance and pollen
   diversity were positively correlated with cover of open semi-natural
   habitat, while after mass-flowering, colony performance was positively
   correlated with forest cover. After mass-flowering, pollen sources were
   more diverse and colony growth was related to land use classes at a
   larger spatial scale, indicating that bumblebees foraged further. We did
   not find a correlation between the performances of colonies at one
   specific site that were placed during and after
   mass-flowering.ConclusionsLandscapes dominated by mass-flowering
   orchards represent inferior habitats for bumblebees during flowering.
   Heterogenous landscapes, containing a mix of various types of
   semi-natural habitat increase the habitat quality for bumblebees. We
   advise to maintain these diverse patches of semi-natural habitat, as
   mass-flowering crops alone are insufficient to support bumblebee

Abstract = {{ContextBiodiversity monitoring programs require fast, reliable and
   cost-effective methods for biodiversity assessment in landscapes.
   Sampling pollinators across entire landscapes is challenging, as
   trapping needs to cover many habitat types.ObjectivesWe developed and
   tested a landscape-wide sampling design for pollinators. We assessed the
   predictability and stability of pollinator biodiversity estimates in
   agricultural landscapes, and tested how estimates were affected by
   sampled habitat, landscape composition and spatial scale.MethodsWe
   sampled pollinators using pan traps at 250 locations in 10 replicated
   landscapes measuring 1x1km and calculated bee richness predictions based
   on different sample sizes. Traps were placed regularly in each
   landscape, sampling each habitat proportionally to its area. Landscapes
   contained semi-natural habitats, crop fields and forests and differed in
   the amount of a mass-flowering crop (oilseed rape).ResultsRegular
   sampling reflected local habitat amount. Compared with cereal fields,
   significantly more pollinators occurred in oilseed rape, and fewer in
   forests. Sampling in only one habitat type led to biased estimates of
   landscape-wide bee species richness, even when sample size was
   increased. The spatial scale of best predictions depended on the sampled
   habitat. Species richness was overestimated when sampling was limited to
   semi-natural habitats and underestimated in oilseed rape fields.
   Precision increased with the number of sampling points per
   landscape.ConclusionsTo study landscape-wide pollinator biodiversity, we
   suggest to sample multiple sites per landscape in a broad range of
   resource-providing habitat types, with sample sizes proportional to
   habitat amount. Our approach will also be useful for biodiversity
   monitoring programs in general.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification has been proposed as a strategy to mitigate
   the impacts of conventional intensive land use on pollinators and insect
   pollination. However, research has concentrated on the effects of land
   management on pollinator abundance and diversity, while studies directly
   measuring pollination services are still lacking for many crops and
   regions. This study examines the effects of landscape heterogeneity,
   pesticide use intensity and flowering time on insect pollination of
   turnip rape Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera, a major oil crop at high
   latitudes. The field experiment included monitoring pollinator visits on
   turnip rape flowers and measuring yield in 34 spring-sown turnip rape
   fields in Southern Finland. The fields were situated in two landscape
   types that differed in the cover of arable land and represented
   independent gradients of pesticide use intensity and flowering time.
   Based on flower visits and number of seeds per silique, turnip rape was
   best pollinated in fields with late flowering time. The result suggests
   a temporal mismatch between crop flowering and the availability of
   pollination service in early sown fields. The increase in flower visits
   during summer was steeper among fields with low than high pesticide use,
   possibly due to a faster colony growth of important bee pollinators.
   Pollinator community in turnip rape fields was more diverse in
   heterogeneous landscapes with less arable land than in homogeneous
   field-dominated landscapes, suggesting higher stability of pollination
   services in diverse landscapes. Total yield per plant was positively
   related to pesticide use intensity. The relationship between insect
   pollination and total yield was weakened by high compensation capacity
   of turnip rape, the plants producing more flowers under poor
   pollination.Synthesis and applications. Crop pollination can be enhanced
   by shifting sowing time to better match crop flowering to the peak
   availability of the most important pollinators. Reduced pesticide use
   may also enhance pollination services but can lead to the total yield
   reduction due to pests. This highlights the need for pollinator-friendly
   pest control methods to maintain turnip rape yields while conserving
   pollination services.

   Maatalouden ekologista tehostamista on esitetty strategiaksi, jonka

   monimuotoisuuden, torjunta-aineiden kayton ja kukinta-ajan vaikutusta
   rypsin hyonteispolytykseen. Peltokokeessa seurattiin polyttajien
   vierailuja rypsin kukilla ja mitattiin satoa 34 kevatrypsipellolla
   Uudellamaalla. Pellot sijaitsivat kahdessa maisematyypissa, joista
   toinen oli peltovaltainen ja toinen monimuotoisempi ja vahemman peltoa
   sisaltava. Lisaksi pellot erosivat toisistaan torjunta-aineiden kayton
   ja kukinta-ajan suhteen. Polyttajien kukkavierailut ja siementen maara

   niiden peltojen joukossa, joilla ei kaytetty torjunta-aineita.
   Mahdollinen selitys on, etta tarhamehilaisten ja kimalaisten yhdyskunnat

Abstract = {{Despite a long history of significant advances in understanding natural
   selection and evolution, the field of plant reproductive biology has
   largely studied plant mating without directly tracking pollen movement
   due to a lack of suitable pollen-tracking methods. Here, we develop and
   test a novel pollen-tracking technique using quantum dots as
   pollen-grain labels. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals that
   are so small, they behave like atoms. When exposed to UV light, they
   emit extremely bright light in both visible and infrared wavelengths. We
   tested the suitability of non-toxic CuInSexS2-x/ZnS (core/shell) quantum
   dots with oleic-acid ligands as pollen-grain labels. Using a
   micropipette, we dispensed quantum dots dissolved in hexane in minute
   volumes (0.15-0.5l) directly onto dehisced anthers of four different
   plant species from four different families (Wachendorfia paniculata
   {[}Haemodoraceae], Sparaxis villosa {[}Iridaceae], Arctotheca calendula
   {[}Asteraceae], Oxalis purpurea {[}Oxalidaceae]). After application, the
   hexane solvent evaporated immediately, leaving behind quantum dots that
   remained attached to pollen grains of the four different plant species
   even after agitation in a polar solvent. This suggests a lipophilic
   interaction between oleic-acid ligands on quantum dots, and pollenkitt
   surrounding pollen grains. We also showed that most pollen grains within
   anthers of the same four plant species were labelled with quantum dots
   after applying a volume of quantum-dot solution sufficient to cover an
   individual anther. To test whether quantum-dot pollen labels influenced
   pollen transport, we conducted pollen transfer trials (one donor, 10
   sequential recipients) on S.villosa using captively reared honey bees to
   ensure bees were free of external pollen prior to experiments. We found
   no difference in pollen transport to recipients from donor flowers with
   labelled or unlabelled pollen grains. We demonstrate that quantum dots
   can be used as pollen labels allowing subsequent tracking of pollen
   fates. This method is relatively inexpensive (<\$500 for equipment and
   ca. \$0.02 per labelled anther thereafter) and can be simply and
   directly applied to anthers of most flowers in the lab and field. The
   ability to track pollen grain movement in situ, may help to address a
   historically neglected aspect of plant reproductive ecology and
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance factor in many terrestrial ecosystems,
   leading to landscape transformation in fire-prone areas. Species in
   mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like
   fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are
   unclear. We use bipartite insect-flower interaction networks across a
   recently burned landscape to explore how plant-pollinator interaction
   networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level,
   and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the
   effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to
   hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower-visiting insects
   during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of
   flower-visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of
   fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic
   Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and
   pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in
   interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity
   was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also
   tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the
   valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of
   specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction
   network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However,
   species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant
   difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower-rich fire
   refuges sustain plant-pollinator interactions, especially those
   involving specialized species, in fire-disturbed landscape. This may be
   an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that
   the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of
   ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{Plants and pollinators form beneficial relationships, with plants
   offering resources in return for pollination services. Some plants,
   however, add compounds to nectar to manipulate pollinators. Caffeine is
   a secondary plant metabolite found in some nectars that affects foraging
   in pollinators. In honeybees, caffeine increases foraging and
   recruitment to mediocre food sources, which might benefit the plant, but
   potentially harms the colonies. For the largest group of social bees,
   the stingless bees, the effect of caffeine on foraging behaviour has not
   been tested yet, despite their importance for tropical ecosystems. More
   generally, recruitment and foraging dynamics are not well understood in
   most species. We examined whether caffeine affects the foraging
   behaviour of the stingless bee Plebeia droryana, which frequently visits
   plants that produce caffeinated nectar and pollen. We trained bees to
   food sources containing field-realistic concentrations of sugar and
   caffeine. Caffeine did not cause P. droryana to increase foraging
   frequency and persistence. We observed P. droryana recruiting to food
   sources; however, this behaviour was also not affected by caffeine.
   Instead we found that higher sugar concentrations caused bees to
   increase foraging effort. Thus, unlike in other pollinators, foraging
   behaviour in this stingless bee is not affected by caffeine. As the
   Brazilian P. droryana population that we tested has been exposed to
   coffee over evolutionary time periods, our results raise the possibility
   that it may have evolved a tolerance towards this central nervous system
   stimulant. Alternatively, stingless bees may show physiological
   responses to caffeine that differ from those of other bee groups.}},

Abstract = {{A striking structural pattern of pollination networks is the presence of
   a few highly connected species which has implications for ecological and
   evolutionary processes that create and maintain diversity. To understand
   the structure and dynamics of pollination networks we need to know which
   mechanisms allow the emergence of highly connected species. We
   investigate whether social pollinator species are highly connected in
   pollination networks, and whether network structure is affected by the
   presence of high proportions of social pollinator species. Social
   insects are abundant, with long activity periods and, at the highest
   level of social organisation, specialised foraging castes. These three
   attributes are likely to increase the number of interactions of social
   species and, consequently, their role in pollination networks. We find
   that social species have, on average, more prominent network roles than
   solitary species, a possible mechanism being the individual-rich
   colonies of social insects. However, when accounting for the shared
   evolutionary history of pollinators, sociality is only associated with
   highly interactive roles in Apidae. For apid bees, our structural
   equation analysis shows that the effect of sociality on species network
   roles is an indirect result of their high levels of interaction
   frequency. Despite the relative importance of sociality at a
   species-level, an increasing proportion of social species in pollination
   networks did not affect overall network structure. Our results suggest
   that behavioural traits may shape patterns of interaction of individual
   species but not the network-level organisation of species interactions.
   Instead, network structure appears to be determined by more general
   aspects of ecological systems such as interaction intimacy, patterns of
   niche overlap, and species abundance distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are key components of the global biodiversity, providing

   Understanding pollinator assemblage and how it changes spatially is
   important in order to device effective ecosystem management planning.
   This is the first empirical study to explore pollinator community
   structure in four widely isolated nature reserves of southern Punjab,
   Pakistan, i.e., the central agricultural plain (Pirowal Forest), the
   Indus delta plain (Ghazi Ghat Wetland), hilly mountains (Fort Munro),
   and a sandy desert (Lal Suhanra Forest). Six assemblage parameters,
   i.e., abundance, richness, dominance, evenness, Simpson index, and
   Shannon-Wiener index, were studied over seven consecutive months
   (February to August 2012). Maximum abundance and richness of the
   pollinators were recorded at Ghazi Ghat (1354 individuals and 84
   species), followed by Pirowal (1331 individuals and 80 species), Lal
   Suhanra (1197 individuals and 77 species), and Fort Munro (808
   individuals and 65 species). The highest values of Simpson and evenness
   indexes were recorded at Fort Munro, while the Shannon-Wiener and
   dominance indexes were highest at Ghazi Ghat and Pirowal. Species
   richness was highest for bees, while it was lowest for flies, yet the
   latter were the highest in abundance among the four pollinator groups.
   The current study is a first account of pollinator assemblage structure
   in four widely isolated forest reserves of Punjab, Pakistan. This will
   support ecosystem management planning, and opens doors for further
   research in order to reveal complexities in pollinator assemblage
   structure especially in relation with plant communities. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide vital ecosystem services across croplands, yet
   simultaneously they are influenced by agricultural practices.
   Nevertheless, only a few studies have explored the potential
   interactions between soil fertilisers and pollinators. The aim of the
   current study, which was carried out in Poland in 2015, was to
   investigate the effect of different fertiliser regimes on bumblebee
   flower visitation rate and seed yield in crops of the field bean (Vicia
   faba L.). Our results show that the number of bumblebee visits may be
   affected by the choice of crop fertiliser. We detected differences in
   bumblebee number between fertiliser treatments. The organic fertiliser
   (manure) treatment resulted in the highest bumblebee visitation,
   although this did not differ significantly from NP, no fertiliser and NK
   treatments. On the other hand, we observed lower numbers of bumblebees
   on field bean plots treated with N, NPK, and PK inorganic fertilisers.
   Manure application also boosted plant height and resulted in a high
   yield similar to other balanced fertilisers (NPK and PK). Therefore,
   manure was the only fertiliser that resulted in a high field bean yield
   and at the same time attracted the main pollinators of the crop. Thus,
   we suggest that appropriate management practices influence both plant
   growth and also pollination services and we show that modern agriculture
   can make compromise between effectiveness and nature conservation. (C)

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are eusocial, yet queens are solitary for much of their
   lives. Little is known about the stages in the solitary phase of queens,
   including the factors that influence successful initiation of nests. One
   anecdotal recommendation suggests that wild-caught queens are less
   likely to initiate nests if they are captured while carrying pollen
   loads. Queens that are collecting pollen have already chosen a nest site
   and are either preparing to lay their first clutch of eggs, have already
   begun oviposition, or are provisioning developing brood. Although there
   is a conservation-based argument for leaving these queens to their own
   devices, we were interested in the biological aspect of this: if a queen
   has already initiated a nest in the wild, will she initiate another one
   in captivity? In 2016 and 2017, 960 queens of five species were
   captured, and the presence or absence of corbicular loads of pollen was
   noted. Each queen was then placed in an artificial nest and provided
   with unlimited food for 21days. Nests were monitored for brood presence
   daily, and rates of nest initiation (brood production) were compared
   between queens captured with and without pollen loads. Nest initiation
   rates varied among species, as did the influence of pollen-collecting
   behavior at the time of capture. Pollen-laden Bombus occidentalis queens
   were less likely to lay eggs, yet B. bifarius and B. vosnesenskii queens
   with pollen had a greater chance of initiating a captive nest. These
   results should inform both commercial and conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in habitat fragmentation impacts plant-pollinator
   interactions and threatens the sustainability of plant species.
   Astragalus tragacantha (Fabaceae), is a rare endangered plant species
   along the coastal habitats where the plant populations have undergone
   considerable fragmentation and decline of size. Controlled pollination
   treatments, the observation of pollinator activity, and pollinator
   captures, have been conducted to study: (1) the mating system of A.
   tragacantha and the potential for inbreeding depression and/or
   outbreeding depression based on controlled pollination treatments, (2)
   the pollinator composition among populations using a correspondence
   analysis and a hierarchical clustering, and (3) the link between
   pollinators and the plant reproductive success using a path-analysis
   model. In this study, we demonstrated that this plant was not autogamous
   self-pollinating and depended on pollinators for its reproduction. The
   absence of difference between manual and open pollinations regarding the
   reproductive success showed an absence of pollen limitation in our
   populations. We showed that populations differed in the composition of
   their pollinator guilds. Some pollinator species were predominant in
   certain populations. The pollination treatments revealed the existence
   of a mixed mating system in A. tragacantha populations. We showed an
   inbreeding depression potentially linked to a predominant
   pollinator-facilitated selfing, and the existence of outbreeding
   depression between some distant populations. These differences in
   pollinator guild and plant mating systems among populations must be
   considered during the restoration of populations along the Mediterranean
   coastal habitats in order to enhance the reproductive success and
   sustainability of A. tragacantha.}},

Abstract = {{A new genus of melitturgine bees (Panurginae: Melitturgini) is described
   and figured from central Saudi Arabia. Bellitingula najdica Engel, gen.
   et sp. n., is similar in several respects to the genus Flavomeliturgula
   Patiny in that both have a greatly elongate glossa that is longer than
   the face and is truncate apically. The former differs in the greatly
   elongate and flattened first labial palpomere, the remaining palpomeres
   unmodified, the greatly protuberant clypeus, and long labrum lacking
   dense setal patches, among other traits. In addition, remarks are made
   on the composition of Flavomeliturgula, with Meliturgula deseria Warncke
   (Iran, Pakistan), removed to Khuzimelissa Engel, gen. n., resulting in
   the new combination Khuzimelissa deserta (Warncke), comb. n.
   Khuzimelissa differs from Flavomeliturgula by the unmodified labial
   palpomeres (lacking the elongate first three labial palpomeres of the
   latter genus), the acute glossa (broadly truncate in the latter), glossa
   shorter than head length (greater than head length in the latter), the
   abundant, white, squamiform setae of the mesoscutum (sparse, erect setae
   in the latter), cleft pretarsal daws (simple in the latter), presence of
   metasomal setal bands (lacking in the latter), and apically emarginate
   pygidial plate (acutely rounded in the latter). The species of
   Flavomeliturgula are organized into three subgenera, including
   Koreshomelissa Engel, subgen. n., and Freyamelissa Engel, subgen. n.,

Title = {{Male and female bees show large differences in floral preference}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Intraspecific variation in foraging niche can drive food web dynamics
   and ecosystem processes. In particular, male and female animals can
   exhibit different, often cascading, impacts on their interaction
   partners. Despite this, studies of plant-pollinator interaction networks
   have focused on the partitioning of the floral community between
   pollinator species, with little attention paid to intraspecific
   variation in plant preference between male and female bees. We designed
   a field study to evaluate the strength and prevalence of sexually
   dimorphic foraging, and particularly resource preferences, in bees.
   Study design
   We observed bees visiting flowers in semi-natural meadows in New Jersey,
   USA. To detect differences in flower use against a shared background of
   resource (flower) availability, we maximized the number of interactions
   observed within narrow spatio-temporal windows. To distinguish observed
   differences in bee use of flower species, which can reflect abundance
   patterns and sampling effects, from underlying differences in bee
   preferences, we analyzed our data with both a permutation-based null
   model and random effects models.
   Findings
   We found that the diets of male and female bees of the same species were
   often dissimilar as the diets of different species of bees. Furthermore,
   we demonstrate differences in preference between male and female bees.
   We show that intraspecific differences in preference can be robustly
   identified among hundreds of unique species-species interactions,
   without precisely quantifying resource availability, and despite high
   phenological turnover of both bees and plant bloom. Given the large
   differences in both flower use and preferences between male and female
   bees, ecological sex differences should be integrated into studies of
   bee demography, plant pollination, and coevolutionary relationships
   between flowers and insects.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 23}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecological process, and invasive alien plant
   species have been shown to significantly affect plant-pollinator
   interactions. Yet, the role of the environmental context in modulating
   such processes is understudied. As urbanisation is a major component of
   global change, being associated with a range of stressors (e.g. heat,
   pollution, habitat isolation), we tested whether the attractiveness of a
   common invasive alien plant (Robinia pseudoacacia, black locust) vs. a
   common native plant (Cytisus scoparius, common broom) for pollinators
   changes with increasing urbanisation. We exposed blossoms of both
   species along an urbanisation gradient and quantified different types of
   pollinator interaction with the flowers. Both species attracted a broad
   range of pollinators, with significantly more visits for R.
   pseudoacacia, but without significant differences in numbers of insects
   that immediately accessed the flowers. However, compared to native
   Cytisus, more pollinators only hovered in front of flowers of invasive
   Robinia without visiting those subsequently. The decision rate to enter
   flowers of the invasive species decreased with increasing urbanisation.
   This suggests that while invasive Robinia still attracts many
   pollinators in urban settings attractiveness may decrease with
   increasing urban stressors. Results indicated future directions to
   deconstruct the role of different stressors in modulating
   plant-pollinator interactions, and they have implications for urban
   development since Robinia can be still considered as a
   ``pollinator-friendly{''} tree for certain urban settings.}},

Abstract = {{Many bees are effective pollen collectors; however, pollen grains

   reduce pollen waste by deterring ineffective pollinators {[}4-6], but
   this hypothesis remains unexamined. Here, we provide evidence that
   secondary metabolites in pollen function as chemical defense by
   deterring some bees from gathering pollen. In two Dipsacus species, a
   defense compound, dipsacus saponin {[}7], occurs in pollen but not in
   nectar. We observed that bumblebees disliked grooming bitter-tasting
   pollen with a high saponin content. Manipulation of saponin
   concentrations in nectar and measurements of corbicular pollen showed
   that the bumblebee species differed in their tolerance to saponin. Those
   species susceptible to saponin groomed little Dipsacus pollen into their
   pollen loads, and their ungroomed pollen was observed to be effectively
   delivered to stigmas. By rewarding bees with edible nectar, but not
   pollen, plants solve the conflict of pollen partitioning between sexual
   and reward functions. Ungroomed toxic pollen on the bee body promotes
   pollen transfer efficiency, facilitating pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in understanding bee responses to habitat loss indicate
   that body size is a trait with important consequences for conservation.
   Stingless bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) are a diverse group of
   eusocial bees providing pollination services in tropical landscapes,
   exhibiting a large range in body size across species. We tested the
   effects of deforestation on the body sizes of stingless bee communities
   by using museum specimens and revisiting a previous effort that sampled
   stingless bee communities across varying levels of deforestation at 183
   sites in Rondonia, Brazil, in 1996-1997. Body size measurements
   (intertegular distance) from 72 species collected were included as
   dependent variables in response to forest area, forest edge, and
   connectivity of forest patches at several spatial scales. We find that
   stingless bee body size is negatively related to forest cover: mean
   community body size was larger in areas with greater amounts of
   deforestation, and smaller in areas with less deforestation. Second,
   stingless bee species richness was positively associated with forest
   edge regardless of body size. Lastly, we find that as forest patch
   isolation increased, the stingless bee community body size also
   increased. These findings support hypotheses that small stingless bee
   species might be more negatively affected by deforestation, adding to
   the growing body of evidence that stingless bees require areas of intact
   forest in near proximity to other forest patches to conserve these
   diverse pollinator communities.}},

Title = {{Tracking neonicotinoids following their use as cotton seed treatments}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids are a leading class of insecticides on the global market,
   accounting for nearly 25\%. They are widely used in both agricultural
   and residential settings. Causing neuron failure by irreversibly binding
   to the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, neonicotinoids offer
   broad spectrum efficacy against a variety of pests. However, because
   they are non-selective with regard to insect species, there has been
   some concern with neonicotinoid use over threats to pollinators such as
   honeybees, and potential indirect effects to migratory waterfowl as a
   result of invertebrate prey population depletion. In order to study
   occurrence and fate of neonicotinoids (thiamethoxam and imidacloprid),
   we analyzed cotton leaves on plants grown from neonicotinoid-treated
   seeds and corresponding soil samples between cotton rows. Neonicotinoid
   concentration data from cotton leaves appears to be consistent with the
   claim that seed treatments protect plants for 3-4 weeks; by 30 days
   post-planting, neonicotinoid concentrations fell, in general, to 200
   ng/g or lower. This represents about a 10-fold decrease from plant
   concentrations at approximately 2 weeks post-planting. It was found that
   neonicotinoids used as seed treatments remained present in the soil for
   months post planting and could be available for runoff. To that end, 21
   playa wetlands were sampled; 10 had at least one quantifiable
   neonicotinoid present, three of which were classified as grassland or
   rangeland playas, two were urban, and the remaining five were cropland
   playas. In several instances, neonicotinoid concentrations in playas
   exceeded EPA chronic benchmarks for aquatic invertebrates.}},

   three mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of Andrena species, which are

   gene arrangement of insects, the three mitogenomes present identical
   gene rearrangement events, including local inversion (trnR) and gene
   shuffling (trnQ/trnM, trnK/trnD, and trnW/trnC-trnY). Most PCGs initiate
   with standard ATN codon and share the stop codon of TAA or TAG, whereas
   truncated stop codon T was detected in the atp6 gene of A.
   chekiangensis. Furthermore, the nad4 gene end with a single T in all
   three Andrena species. All tRNAs could be folded into clover-leaf
   secondary structure except for trnS1, with the dihydrouracil (DHU) arm
   forming a simple loop. Phylogenetic analysis is performed on 17 Andrena

Abstract = {{Avocado (Persea americana M.) exhibits a two-type `synchronous
   dichogamy' form of flowering that promotes outcrossing. In `type A,' the
   flower opens in the female phase from morning till noon, then closes and
   re-opens on the afternoon of the following day in the male phase. In
   `type B,' the flower opens in the female form on the afternoon of the
   first day, closes at the end of the day, and re-opens in the male form
   on the following morning. In both types, the female and male forms may
   overlap and self-fertilize. Planting an A type and B type cultivar
   adjacently to each other increases yield in most cases. `Hass' (A type)
   is the most favorable avocado cultivar worldwide, however, the cultivar
   that serves as its pollinator varies between regions and countries. In
   Israel, for more than 30 years, the `Ettinger' cultivar (B type, a
   seedling of Tuerte' selected in Israel) is its only pollinator, hence,
   adding another pollinator for `Hass' should be beneficial. `Iriet' (B
   type) is an Israeli-bred cultivar and its fruit has a Ilass'-like
   appearance (a marked change in color from green when not ripe to black
   at full ripe).
   For accurate comparison between `Iriet' and `Ettinger' as a pollinator
   of `Hass,' an orchard with the two pollinators was planted and a SNP
   analysis was developed for the identification of the paternal parents of
   the `Hass' fruits. In addition, the flowering phonology and honeybee
   visits were determined. The results suggest that `Iriet' is a good
   pollinator for `Hass' and could be added alongside `Ettinger' as a
   pollen donor for `Hass'.}},

Abstract = {{Conserving and restoring semi-natural habitat, i.e. enhancing landscape
   complexity, is one of the main strategies to mitigate pollinator decline
   in agricultural landscapes. However, we still have limited understanding
   of how landscape complexity shapes pollinator communities in both crop
   and non-crop habitat, and whether pollinator responses to landscape
   complexity vary with their association with mass-flowering crops. Here,
   we surveyed pollinator communities on mass-flowering leek crops and in
   nearby semi-natural habitat in landscapes of varying complexity. Surveys
   were done before and during crop bloom and distinguished between
   pollinators that visit the crop frequently (dominant), occasionally
   (opportunistic), or not at all (non-crop). Forty-seven per cent of the
   species in the wider landscape were also observed on leek flowers. Crop
   pollinator richness increased with local pollinator community size and
   increasing landscape complexity, but relationships were stronger for
   opportunistic than for dominant crop pollinators. Relationships between
   pollinator richness in semi-natural habitats and landscape complexity
   differed between groups with the most pronounced positive effects on
   non-crop pollinators. Our results indicate that while dominant crop
   pollinators are core components of crop pollinator communities in all
   agricultural landscapes, opportunistic crop pollinators largely
   determine species-richness responses and complex landscapes are local
   hotspots for both biodiversity conservation and potential ecosystem
   service provision.}},

Abstract = {{Communities of plants and their insect brood pollinators have provided
   important insights into the evolution of mutualism. The discovery of new
   systems has the potential to extend our knowledge of the origins and
   consequences of these interactions. Many palms are known to be
   pollinated by beetles that breed on their reproductive parts, but in
   most cases these interactions are not well described. Here we describe
   the natural history of insects visiting flowers of the licuri palm
   Syagrus coronata. Using a literature review combined with new data on
   pollination, behaviour, larval breeding sites and geography of over 25
   species of insects, we show that this palm is pollinated both by
   generalist insects (mostly meliponine bees) and by specialized beetles
   that breed on floral tissues as larvae. Among these beetles, there is
   very strong evidence that the weevil Anchylorhynchus trapezicollis is an
   important pollinator and also a pre-dispersal seed predator. The seed
   beetle Pachymerus thoracicus, long considered only a post-dispersal seed
   predator, is also a pollinator. Our results increase the number of known
   cases of specialized brood pollinators associated with a generalist
   plant, opening the possibility of using palms and their associated
   insects as model systems in the study of coevolution and biological
   interactions.}},

Title = {{Wild bee diversity increases with local fire severity in a fire-prone
   landscape}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{As wildfire activity increases in many regions of the world, it is
   imperative that we understand how key components of fire-prone
   ecosystems respond to spatial variation in fire characteristics.
   Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting
   in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how
   pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is
   limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of
   a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire
   to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped
   by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas
   Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how
   bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that
   fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more
   individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that
   experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire
   severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee
   community, with more individuals and more species captured during late
   summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two
   critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations-flowering
   plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees-also
   increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the
   relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire
   severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and
   Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences
   in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a
   large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse
   wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important
   implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected
   expansion of wildfires in the coming decades.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland vegetative strips are a proven source of support for ecosystem
   services and are globally used to mitigate effects of agricultural
   intensification. However, increasing pressures on agricultural land
   require increases in their functionality, such as supporting multiple
   ecosystem services concurrently. The plant species sown in a vegetative
   strip seed mix determine the establishment, plant community, and
   ecosystem services that are supported. Currently, there is no clearly
   defined or structured method to select plant species for multifunctional
   vegetative strips. Plant traits determine how plants support ecosystem
   services. Also, the establishment and persistence of plant communities
   is influenced by key internal and external factors. We propose a novel,
   evidence-informed method of multifunctional vegetative strip design
   based on these essential traits and factors. This study had three
   distinct stages. The first identified plant traits that support water
   quality protection, pollinators and/or crop pest natural enemies, using
   existing research evidence. We then identified key factors affecting
   plant community establishment and persistence. Finally, we applied these
   standardized methods to design a multifunctional vegetative strip for a
   specific case study (UK lowland farmland). Key plant traits identified,
   included floral display size, flower color, nectar content, leaf surface
   area, leaf trichome density, percentage fine roots, root length, rooting
   depth, and root density. Key internal and external establishment factors
   included life history, native status, distribution, established
   competitive strategy, associated floristic diversity, flowering time and
   duration, and preferred soil type and pH. In the United Kingdom case
   study, we used five different plant traits and all of the identified
   factors to design a seed mix for a multifunctional vegetative strip. We
   present a transferable method of vegetative strip design that can be
   adapted for other ecosystem services and climates. It provides
   landowners and advisors with an evidence-informed approach to increase
   field margin functionality while supporting farmland biodiversity.

Abstract = {{Body size is an important trait linking pollinators and plants.
   Morphological matching between pollinators and plants is thought to
   reinforce pollinator fidelity, as the correct fit ensures that both
   parties benefit from the interaction. We investigated the influence of
   body size in a specialized pollination system (buzz-pollination) where
   bees vibrate flowers to release pollen concealed within poricidal
   stamens. Specifically, we explored how body size influences the
   frequency of buzz-pollination vibrations. Body size is expected to
   affect frequency as a result of the physical constraints it places on
   the indirect flight muscles that control the production of floral
   vibrations. Larger insects beat their wings less rapidly than
   smaller-bodied insects when flying, but whether similar scaling
   relationships exist with floral vibrations has not been widely explored.
   This is important because the amount of pollen ejected is determined by
   the frequency of the vibration and the displacement of a bee's thorax.
   We conducted a field study in three ecogeographic regions (alpine,
   desert, grassland) and recorded flight and floral vibrations from freely
   foraging bees from 27 species across four families. We found that floral
   vibration frequencies were significantly higher than flight frequencies,
   but never exceeded 400Hz. Also, only flight frequencies were negatively
   correlated with body size. As a bee's size increased, its buzz ratio
   (floral frequency/flight frequency) increased such that only the largest
   bees were capable of generating floral vibration frequencies that
   exceeded double that of their flight vibrations. These results indicate
   size affects the capacity of bees to raise floral vibration frequencies
   substantially above flight frequencies. This may put smaller bees at a
   competitive disadvantage because even at the maximum floral vibration
   frequency of 400Hz, their inability to achieve comparable thoracic
   displacements as larger bees would result in generating vibrations with
   lower amplitudes, and thus less total pollen ejected for the same
   foraging effort.}},

Title = {{Traditional semi-natural grassland management with heterogeneous mowing
   times enhances flower resources for pollinators in agricultural
   landscapes}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{For a diverse pollinator fauna it is important that pollen and nectar
   are available over the entire summer at spatially relevant scales.
   Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most important sources of flower
   resources for pollinators, but the resources are strongly affected by
   the timing of mowing. Management recommendations for hay meadows often
   prescribe late mowing on order to allow undisturbed flowering during
   most of the summer. Traditional practices, however, often include also
   earlier mowing. We investigate the link between the temporal variation
   of flower resources and traditional mowing practices of semi-natural hay
   meadows in a low-intensity agricultural landscape in Romania. In early
   August, we botanically surveyed meadows that were cut early,
   intermediately, or late in the season. We recorded all herb species,
   their phenological stage, and the number of reproductive units of each
   species. Data were analysed using DCA, LM and GLM. Plant species
   richness and composition are not affected by the time of mowing, but
   different sets of species flower in semi-natural grasslands with
   different mowing regimes. In August the proportion of species flowering
   and flower density are highest in the early-mown meadows due to
   re-flowering after mowing. Analyses of phenological stages indicate that
   late-mown meadows are the main pollen and nectar sources in July,
   whereas meadows mown early are the main resource from August to the end
   of the season. The results demonstrate that for pollinator conservation,
   heterogeneous mowing times within a landscape need to be encouraged when
   possible, and that strict focus on late mowing may lead to shortage of
   flower resources late in the summer. Studies of low-intensity
   agriculture has a great potential for learning about management methods
   that can be used in other parts of the world where traditional practices
   have been lost. Such studies can thereby contribute with important
   knowledge to manage global pollinator loss. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Journal = {{NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Plant density varies naturally, from isolated plants to clumped
   individuals, and this can influence pollinator foraging behaviour and
   plant reproductive success. In addition, the effect of conspecific
   density on reproduction may depend on the pollination system, and
   deceptive species differ from rewarding ones in this regard, a high
   density being often associated with low fruit set in deceptive plants.
   In our study, we aimed to determine how local conspecific density and
   floral display size (i.e. number of flowers per plant) affect fruit set
   in a deceptive orchid (Orchis militaris) through changes in pollinator
   visitation. We measured fruit set in a natural population and recorded
   pollinator abundance and foraging behaviour within plots of different O.
   militaris densities. Detailed data were recorded for the most abundant
   potential pollinators of O. militaris, i.e. solitary bees. Floral
   display size was negatively correlated to fruit set in medium-density
   plots, but uncorrelated in low- and high-density plots. Plot density had
   no effect on solitary bee abundance and visitation, which may be due to
   low pollinator abundance within the study site. The proportion of
   visited flowers per inflorescence was negatively influenced by floral
   display size, which is in line with previous studies. In addition,
   solitary bees spent decreasing time in successive flowers within an
   inflorescence, and the time spent per flower was negatively affected by
   ambient temperature. Our results suggest that pollinator behaviour
   during visitation is poorly linked to pollen deposition and reproductive
   success in O. militaris.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{275}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollinators are in a serious decline due to habitat loss,
   isolation and landscape fragmentation, putting pollination services to
   crops at risk. Hedgerows have been repeatedly emphasized as landscape
   elements that provide nesting and food resources, connect fragmented
   habitats and could thus facilitate crop pollination. However, the
   beneficial and potentially also detrimental impacts of hedgerows on crop
   pollination remain poorly studied. Here, we analysed the effects of
   pollinators and herbivorous pollen beetles (Meligethes spp.) on quantity
   and quality of strawberries from phytometer plants located at
   forest-connected hedgerows, isolated hedgerows and on grassy margins
   without any hedgerows. Higher pollinator abundance increased strawberry
   weight, whereas pollen beetle abundance reduced strawberry weight.
   Strawberry weight was significantly reduced by 29\% at isolated
   hedgerows and 32\% on grassy margins, compared to berries at connected
   hedgerows. Plants placed at forest-connected hedgerows produced more
   high quality strawberries with 90\% classified as ``marketable{''},
   whereas only 75\% of strawberries from plants at isolated hedgerows,
   48\% of strawberries from plants on grassy margins and 41\% of
   strawberries from self-pollinated control plants where classified as
   marketable. Consequently, increased habitat connectivity through
   hedgerows enhanced the commercial value of strawberries from 9.27 (sic)
   per 1000 strawberries for plants grown on grassy margins to 14.95 (sic)
   for plants located at forest-connected hedgerows. Correspondingly,
   pollinator abundance was highest on phytometer plants at
   forest-connected hedgerows, lowest on grassy margins and intermediate at
   isolated hedgerows. Pollen beetle abundance on phytometer plants was not
   affected by hedgerows.
   Our study highlights the importance of hedgerows and habitat
   connectivity for promoting pollination services in agricultural

Abstract = {{In the absence of pollinating insects commercial strawberry (Fragaria x
   ananassa) yields would fall by approximately 45\%, while damage from
   aphids is estimated to cost growers at least 1\% of annual yields in the
   UK alone. This combined effect could result in losses of over 100
   million per year for the UK economy. We investigated whether
   incorporating floral resources within commercial polythene-clad tunnels
   could improve pollination services and aphid control and, hence,
   strawberry fruit quality. In a randomised block experiment (using 3 x 6
   m plots), coriander (Coriandrum sativum) field forget-me-not (Myosotis
   arvensis) and corn mint (Mentha arvensis) plants were inserted in rows
   of commercially-grown strawberries. Their effect on numbers of naturally
   occurring flower visitors, aphids and aphid predators was compared.
   Counts of flower visitors, including visitors to sown flower species,
   were higher in coriander and mint plots. However strawberry flowers
   received more insect visits in control plots. Fruit from forget-me-not
   plots were lower in sugar than fruit from controls, while fruit from
   mint plots had fewer fertilised seeds than fruit from control plots.
   Strawberries from coriander plots did not differ from control fruit on
   any fruit quality measures. Crucially, proportions of marketable fruit
   did not differ across treatments. Aphid numbers did not differ between
   treatments even though coriander significantly increased the numbers of
   lacewing eggs laid on aphid-infested strawberry plants in coriander
   plots. Hence, although there were no negative effects on the proportions
   of marketable fruits with intercropping, the benefits received were
   limited. It might be that in a different growing season the effect would
   be more pronounced but this would need to be weighed up against the cost
   of implementing such interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Wildflower strips (WFS) are increasingly commonly adopted measures to
   promote biodiversity in agro-ecosystems. While their effectiveness in
   providing floral and other food resources for pollinators and natural
   enemies has been relatively well studied, much less is known about the
   value of different types of WFS as overwintering habitat for different
   functional arthropod groups. Here, we examined arthropod overwintering
   in WFS of different age compared to winter wheat fields. Moreover, we
   addressed the largely unexplored question to what extent non-permanent
   WFS may act as sink or ecological trap, if they attract high numbers of
   overwintering arthropods but only a low proportion of them survive and
   successfully emerge due to ploughing of strips during overwintering.
   Overwintering of all studied arthropod groups including potential pest
   natural enemies spiders, carabid beetles, staphylinid beetles and
   different families of pollinating flies was higher in WFS compared to
   winter wheat crops. Overwintering increased in WFS compared to wheat
   fields irrespective of WFS age, except for 4 year old WFS in the case of
   carabid beetles and 1 year old WFS in the case of spiders. While WFS age
   positively affected spider overwintering, numbers of overwintering
   pollinating flies and staphylinid beetles did not change significantly
   with WFS age. Moreover, carabid beetles tended to decline in the four
   years old WFS compared to younger ones. Ploughing of annual WFS during
   overwintering significantly reduced the number of successfully emerging
   arthropods by 59\% on average. Detrimental effects were strongest for
   carabid beetles and spiders (reductions by 67\% and 69\%, respectively)
   to their numbers in ploughed WFS being similar to winter wheat fields.
   Reductions were less severe for pollinating flies and staphylinid
   beetles (both 47\%), with higher numbers emerging from annual WFS
   compared to winter wheat fields even after ploughing of WFS.
   We conclude that perennial WFS are valuable overwintering habitats for a
   range of arthropod taxa across functional groups in arable cropping
   systems. Distinct responses of different arthropod taxa to WFS age
   highlight the importance of managing perennial WFS of various
   successional stages in order to promote overwintering of a broad variety
   arthropods in agro-ecosystems. Our study raises concerns, however, that
   annual WFS ploughed during the overwintering period are poor
   overwintering habitats for arthropods and may even act as ecological
   traps.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the StudyA key question in evolutionary biology is why some
   clades are more successful by being widespread geographically, biome
   diverse, or species-rich. To extend understanding of how shifts in area,
   biomes, and pollinators impact diversification in plants, we examined
   the relationships of these shifts to diversification across the
   mega-genus Salvia.
   MethodsA chronogram was developed from a supermatrix of anchored hybrid
   enrichment genomic data and targeted sequence data for over 500 of the
   nearly 1000 Salvia species. Ancestral areas and biomes were
   reconstructed using BioGeoBEARS. Pollinator guilds were scored,
   ancestral pollinators determined, shifts in pollinator guilds
   identified, and rates of pollinator switches compared.
   Key ResultsA well-resolved phylogenetic backbone of Salvia and updated
   subgeneric designations are presented. Salvia originated in Southwest
   Asia in the Oligocene and subsequently dispersed worldwide. Biome shifts
   are frequent from a likely ancestral lineage utilizing broadleaf and/or
   coniferous forests and/or arid shrublands. None of the four species
   diversification shifts are correlated to shifts in biomes. Shifts in
   pollination system are not correlated to species diversification shifts,
   except for one hummingbird shift that precedes a major shift in
   diversification near the crown of New World subgen. Calosphace. Multiple
   reversals back to bee pollination occurred within this hummingbird
   clade.
   ConclusionsSalvia diversified extensively in different continents,
   biomes, and with both bee and bird pollinators. The lack of tight
   correlation of area, biome, and most pollinator shifts to the four
   documented species diversification shifts points to other important
   drivers of speciation in Salvia.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are rich in biodiversity and thus important
   habitats for conservation, yet they are experiencing rapid declines due
   to agricultural intensification and abandonment. Promoting a more
   diverse mammalian herbivore community, including large and
   megaherbivores, may result in positive cascade effects for biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, reintroducing an ecologically
   functional substitute of an extinct large herbivore could mitigate
   current biodiversity declines and foster semi-natural grassland
   conservation. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year rewilding
   experiment where 12 feral horses were introduced in three 10-hectare
   enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). We used
   community-weighted mean plant functional traits to elucidate plant
   community changes induced by grazing through time. We also investigated
   the effects of this experimental treatment on insect pollinated plants
   and on pollinator habitat use. The grassland community exerted a mixed
   tolerance/avoidance response to grazing. This resulted in plant
   functional compositional changes which favoured prostrate plant species
   with higher specific leaf area, characteristic of ruderal communities.
   Plant species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed areas.
   Butterfly and bumblebee habitat use, as well as feeding and resting
   activities were also higher in grazed areas. Moreover, the number of
   pollinators increased with plant species richness.Synthesis and
   applications. This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of
   a given herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild
   horses can have significant effects on the functional composition of
   grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular
   bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use. Novel management
   alternatives are urgently needed to reverse the negative effect of land
   abandonment in European agricultural landscapes. Thus, rewilding
   interventions with large mammalian herbivores may offset current
   biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between
   plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Understanding population genetic structure is key to developing
   predictions about species susceptibility to environmental change, such
   as habitat fragmentation and climate change. It has been theorized that
   life-history traits may constrain some species in their dispersal and
   lead to greater signatures of population genetic structure. In this
   study, we use a quantitative comparative approach to assess if patterns
   of population genetic structure in bees are driven by three key
   species-level life-history traits: body size, sociality, and diet
   breadth. Specifically, we reviewed the current literature on bee
   population genetic structure, as measured by the differentiation indices
   Nei's G(ST,) Hedrick's G `(ST), and Jost's D. We then used phylogenetic
   generalised linear models to estimate the correlation between the
   evolution of these traits and patterns of genetic differentiation. Our
   analyses revealed a negative and significant effect of body size on
   genetic structure, regardless of differentiation index utilized. For
   Hedrick's G `(ST) and Jost's D, we also found a significant impact of
   sociality, where social species exhibited lower levels of
   differentiation than solitary species. We did not find an effect of diet
   specialization on population genetic structure. Overall, our results
   suggest that physical dispersal or other functions related to body size
   are among the most critical for mediating population structure for bees.
   We further highlight the importance of standardizing population genetic
   measures to more easily compare studies and to identify the most
   susceptible species to landscape and climatic changes.}},

Abstract = {{Social bees are important insect pollinators of wildflowers and
   agricultural crops, making their reported declines a global concern. A
   major factor implicated in these declines is the widespread use of
   neonicotinoid pesticides. Indeed, recent research has demonstrated that
   exposure to low doses of these neurotoxic pesticides impairs bee
   behaviours important for colony function and survival. However, our
   understanding of the molecular-genetic pathways that lead to such
   effects is limited, as is our knowledge of how effects may differ
   between colony members. To understand what genes and pathways are
   affected by exposure of bumblebee workers and queens to neonicotinoid
   pesticides, we implemented a transcriptome-wide gene expression study.
   We chronically exposed Bombus terrestriscolonies to either clothianidin
   or imidacloprid at field-realistic concentrations while controlling for
   factors including colony social environment and worker age. We reveal
   that genes involved in important biological processes including
   mitochondrial function are differentially expressed in response to
   neonicotinoid exposure. Additionally, clothianidin exposure had stronger
   effects on gene expression amplitude and alternative splicing than
   imidacloprid. Finally, exposure affected workers more strongly than
   queens. Our work demonstrates how RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling can
   provide detailed novel insight on the mechanisms mediating pesticide
   toxicity to a key insect pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering time is a trait that reflects the timing of specific resource
   requirements by plants. Consequently, several predictions have been made
   related to how species are assembled within communities according to
   flowering time. Strong overlap in flowering time among coexisting
   species may result from clustered abiotic resources, or contribute to
   improved pollination success. Conversely, low flowering time overlap
   (asynchrony) among coexisting species may reduce competition for soil,
   light, or pollinator resources and alleviate interspecific pollen
   transfer. Here, we present evidence that coexisting species in an
   old-field community generally overlap less in flowering time than
   expected under a commonly used and statistically validated null model.
   Flowering time asynchrony was more pronounced when abundance data were
   used (compared to presence-absence data), and when analyses focused on
   species that share bees as pollinators. Control and herbivore-exclusion
   plots did not differ in flowering time overlap, providing no evidence of
   the reduction in overlap expected to result from increased competition.
   Our results varied with the randomization algorithm used, emphasizing
   that the choice of algorithm can influence the outcome of null models.
   Our results varied between 2years, with patterns being less clear in the
   second year, when both growing season and flowering times were
   contracted. Finally, we found evidence that further supports a previous
   finding that higher plot-level flowering time overlap was associated
   with higher proportions of introduced species. Reduced flowering time
   overlap among species in our focal community may promote coexistence via
   temporal niche differentiation and reduced competition for pollinators
   and other abiotic resources.}},

Abstract = {{Chengdu Plain is one of China's most important agricultural production
   zones and has a large human population. Agricultural crops require
   insect pollination to increase yield and quality, which is especially
   important in plains areas where forest area is small. Homegardens are
   the main habitat of pollinators. The present study identified the
   importance of insect pollination in homegardens in the Chengdu Plain
   through field investigations and comparative experiments and revealed
   the risk to pollination services caused by the decrease in diversity and
   population of managed and wild pollinators. The results showed that (1)
   prohibiting all insect pollination (treatment A) and prohibiting managed
   bee pollination (treatment B) significantly reduced the yield and seed
   number of rapeseed and significantly reduced the size, weight, and
   sweetness of peach fruit, but had no significant effects on plums; (2)
   the dependence on insect pollination and the economic values of insect
   pollination for rapeseed and peaches are 0.56 and \$85.1 million and
   0.44 and \$31.0 million, respectively; (3) there were 23 flower-visiting
   pollinator species at the experimental sites including: four species of
   managed bees and 19 species of wild pollinators. The peak time for
   pollinators to visit flowers was 11:00 to 15:00, and the managed bees
   accounted for over 67.55\% of these visits; (4) within a radius of 1000
   m from the site, 58.06\% of the bees were non-locally managed, and the
   bee population managed locally by farmers decreased; and (5) compared
   with 2008, the number of homegardens decreased by 17.24\%, the managed

Abstract = {{Wild blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton, is a native forest
   understory plant that is managed as a fruit crop. Over the past 51
   years, experiments have been conducted to investigate its reproduction.
   A model was developed that predicts bloom to begin at 100 degrees days

   period of three to four weeks. Flower stigmas are only receptive to
   pollen deposition for eight to 10 days, and the rate of fruit set
   declines rapidly after four days. Placement of pollen upon receptive
   stigmas suggests that fruit set occurs with as little as a single pollen
   tetrad. Twelve tetrads result in 50\% fruit set. Several years of
   exploratory fruit set field experiments show viable seeds per berry,
   which result from pollination with compatible genotype pollen, is
   associated with larger berry mass (g). Decomposition of the total
   variance in fruit set shows that stem variation explains 65\% to 79\% of
   total variance in the fruit set. To a lesser extent, the field, year,
   and clone also explain the percent fruit set variation. Variation
   between stems may be due to variation in the number of flowers. Fruit
   set tends to decrease as the flower density increases, possibly due to
   the limitation of pollinators.}},

   were not affected by ant treatments or their interactions with EFN
   treatments. These results suggest that EFNs in S. javanica attracted
   both ants and flying pollinators, but ants did not present a defensive
   role against herbivores, did not deter flying pollinators from visiting
   inflorescences and had no effects on fruit production. In addition, ants

Abstract = {{Conservation of organisms usually focuses on areas that are not
   significantly altered by human activity. However, many areas under the
   influence of human activity can be important for maintaining
   biodiversity. Sand quarries became important substitute habitats for
   many species of insects, including wild bees. However, their
   attractiveness as a potential place for oligolectic bees to forage is
   insufficiently known. We examined the species richness and abundance of
   wild bees, including species with a specialized diet, in 20 used and
   inactive sand quarries differing in area (0.64-7.40 ha), succession
   stage and location in the landscape. Some of the inactive quarries were
   littered with municipal and household waste, i.e. mainly plant biomass
   and soil from home gardens and construction debris. We recorded 156
   species of wild bees (32\% of the domestic Polish fauna). Polylectic
   species accounted for 57\% of the bee community (66\% of the total
   abundance), 17\% of the community were oligolectic species (25\% of the
   total abundance) and 26\% of the community were cleptoparasitic species
   (9\% of the total abundance). The total number of polylectic species and
   their abundance increased with the increasing area of sand quarries. At
   the same time, the richness and abundance of oligolectic species
   increased with the increasing number and abundance of food species.
   Among the recorded oligolectic bees, 55\% were common in the studied
   habitats, 30\% were frequently reported, and only 15\% were rare

Abstract = {{Rangeland invertebrates contribute greatly to biodiversity and provide
   important services including pollination, pest control, and nutrient
   cycling. As wildfire frequency increases across these areas of the
   United States, it is imperative to understand how these disturbances
   affect beneficial invertebrate communities. We examined bee
   (Hymenoptera), spider (Araneae), and vegetative communities 1 yr before
   and 1 yr after a large wildfire swept across an intact grassland in
   eastern Oregon. Several sites were left unburned after the fire, and a
   before-after-control-impact study design was used to assess changes
   within the communities. Fire had no effect on bee or spider abundance,
   or spider diversity or richness; however, fire significantly increased
   native bee diversity and richness. In addition, composition of both
   native bee and spider communities differed significantly between burned
   and unburned areas 1 yr after the fire. Sheet web spiders (Linyphiidae)
   and several bee species (primarily large, generalist species) were
   associated with burned sites. Invasive annual grass and biological soil
   crust cover decreased significantly in burned sites, butmaximum
   vegetation height and litter cover did not differ significantly among
   treatments. Forb abundance increased in burned sites; however, species
   richness of forbs in burned and unburned sites did not differ
   significantly 1 yr after the fire. Several forbs were indicative of
   burned areas including non-native species, such as Douglas' knotweed
   (Polygonum douglasii) and Russian thistle (Salsola tragus), and native
   species such as Canadian horseweed (Conyza canadensis), hoary tansyaster
   (Machaeranthera canescens), and tall willowherb (Epilobium
   brachycarpum). This study demonstrates that both invertebrate and plant
   communities show strong short-term responses to wildfire, and our
   results can be used to inform management of rare habitat and
   biodiversity in rangelands impacted by wildfire in arid grasslands. (C)

Abstract = {{Approximately 70\% of the 30 000 known bee (Hymenoptera) species and
   most flower-visiting, solitary wasps (Hymenoptera) nest in the ground.
   However, nesting behaviours of most ground-nesting bees and wasps are
   poorly understood. Habitat loss, including nesting habitat, threatens
   populations of ground-nesting bees and wasps. Most ground-nesting bee
   and wasp studies implement trapping methods that capture foraging
   individuals, but provide little insight into the nesting preferences of
   these taxa. Some researchers have suggested that emergence traps may
   provide a suitable means by which to determine ground-nesting bee and
   wasp abundance. We sought to evaluate nest-site selection of
   ground-nesting bees and wasps using emergence traps in two study
   systems: (1) planted wildflower enhancement plots and fallow control
   plots in agricultural land; and (2) upland pine and hammock habitat in
   forests. Over the course of three years (2015-2017), we collected 306
   ground-nesting bees and wasps across all study sites from emergence
   traps. In one study, we compared captures per trap between coloured pan
   traps and emergence traps and found that coloured pan traps captured far
   more ground-nesting bees and wasps than did emergence traps. Based on
   our emergence trap data, our results also suggest ground-nesting bees
   and wasps are more apt to nest within wildflower enhancement plots than
   in fallow control plots, and in upland pine habitats than in hammock
   forests. In conclusion, emergence traps have potential to be a unique
   tool to gain understanding of ground-nesting bee and wasp habitat
   requirements.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is a major driver of wild bee decline.
   Vineyards may be inhabited by plant and animal species, especially when
   the inter-row space is vegetated with spontaneous vegetation or cover
   crops. Wild bees depend on floral resources and suitable nesting sites
   which may be found in vineyard inter-rows or in viticultural landscapes.
   Inter-row vegetation is managed by mulching, tillage, and/or herbicide
   application and results in habitat degradation when applied intensively.
   Here, we hypothesize that lower vegetation management intensities,
   higher floral resources, and landscape diversity affect wild bee
   diversity and abundance dependent on their functional traits. We sampled
   wild bees semi-quantitatively in 63 vineyards representing different
   vegetation management intensities across Europe in 2016. A proxy for
   floral resource availability was based on visual flower cover
   estimations. Management intensity was assessed by vegetation cover (\%)
   twice a year per vineyard. The Shannon Landscape Diversity Index was
   used as a proxy for landscape diversity within a 750 m radius around
   each vineyard center point. Wild bee communities were clustered by
   country. At the country level, between 20 and 64 wild bee species were
   identified. Increased floral resource availability and extensive
   vegetation management both affected wild bee diversity and abundance in
   vineyards strongly positively. Increased landscape diversity had a small
   positive effect on wild bee diversity but compensated for the negative
   effect of low floral resource availability by increasing eusocial bee
   abundance. We conclude that wild bee diversity and abundance in
   vineyards is efficiently promoted by increasing floral resources and
   reducing vegetation management frequency. High landscape diversity
   further compensates for low floral resources in vineyards and increases
   pollinating insect abundance in viticulture landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Colour signals are the main floral trait for plant-pollinator
   communication. Owing to visual specificities, flower visitors exert
   different selective pressures on flower colour signals of plant
   communities. Although they evolved to attract pollinators, matching
   their visual sensitivity and colour preferences, floral signals may also
   evolve to avoid less efficient pollinators and antagonistic flower
   visitors.
   We evaluated evidence for the bee avoidance hypothesis in a Neotropical
   community pollinated mainly by bees and hummingbirds, the campo
   rupestre. We analysed flower reflectance spectra, compared colour
   variables of bee-pollinated flowers (bee-flowers; 244 species) and
   hummingbird-pollinated flowers (hummingbird-flowers; 39 species), and
   looked for evidence of bee sensorial exclusion in hummingbird-flowers.
   Flowers were equally contrasting for hummingbirds. Hummingbird-flowers
   were less conspicuous to bees, reflecting mainly long wavelengths and
   avoiding red-blind visitors. Bee-flowers reflected more short
   wavelengths, were more conspicuous to bees (higher contrasts and
   spectral purity) than hummingbird-flowers and displayed floral guides
   more frequently, favouring flower attractiveness, discrimination and
   handling by bees.
   Along with no phylogenetic signal, the differences in colour signal
   strategies between bee- and hummingbird-flowers are the first evidence
   of the bee avoidance hypothesis at a community level and reinforce the
   role of pollinators as a selective pressure driving flower colour
   diversity.}},

   to determine whether there is versatility regarding sources of oil,
   nectar, and pollen in different regions of Brazil. By using the pollen,
   we also determined whether the source of oil used corresponded to the
   collection apparatus of the females. In total, we sampled 150 C.
   burgdorfi females and their associated pollen in three distinct habitat
   types across Brazil. We prepared pollen by acetolysis and performed
   quantitative analysis on 400 grains per bee. We identified 41 plant
   species belonging to 18 families that were used by C. burgdorfi.
   Although none of the plant species used by C. burgdorfi were shared
   among areas, the Chamaecrista genus was present in the diet at all three
   sites. The probable oil source came from plants of the genus Krameria, a
   genus with epithelial elaiophores. In regions where the Krameriaceae
   family was not present (e.g., southern Brazil), bees used Angelonia
   integerrima, a plant with trichomate elaiophores, demonstrating that C.
   burgdorfis exhibited versatility in its dietary breadth among the
   studied regions. C. burgdorfi proved to be locally specialized in oil
   floral source and selectivity in pollen sources, but a generalist when

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing concern about the status and trends of animal
   pollinators worldwide. Pollinators provide a key service to both wild
   plants and crops by mediating their reproduction, so pollinator
   conservation is of fundamental importance to conservation and to food
   production. Understanding of the extent of pollinator declines is
   constrained by the paucity of accessible data, which leads to
   geographically- and taxonomically-biased assessments. In addition, land
   conversion to agriculture and intensive agricultural management are two
   of the main threats to pollinators. This is paradoxical, as crop
   production depends on pollinators to maximize productivity. There is a
   need to reconcile conservation and ecosystem service provision in
   agroecosystems. These challenges require coordinated transdisciplinary
   research infrastructures. Specifically, we need better research
   infrastructures to (i) describe pollinator decline patterns worldwide,
   (ii) monitor current pollinator trends, and (iii) understand how to
   enhance pollinator numbers and pollination in agroecosystems. This can
   be achieved, first, by redoubling the efforts to make historical data on
   species occurrences, interactions and traits openly available and easy
   to integrate across databases. Second, by empowering citizen science to
   monitor key pollinator species in a coordinated way and standardizing,
   consolidating and integrating long term collection protocols both in
   natural and agricultural areas. Finally, there is a need to develop
   multi-actor, localised research infrastructures allowing integration of
   social, economic and ecological approaches in agriculture. We illustrate
   how decentralized infrastructures can accelerate the process of
   co-producing research and integrating data collection across scientists,
   managers, members of the public, farmers and disciplines. The time is
   ripe to harness the power of coordinated research infrastructures to

Abstract = {{Tropical and subtropical plants provide to pollinators a range of
   nutritive and non-nutritive materials as alternative to pollen and
   nectar, including resins, which are gathered by females of several
   groups of social and solitary bees. Although resin-like material has
   previously been recorded in Maxillariinae, these investigations
   generally did not present data relating to pollinators. In fact, the
   collection of resins has never been recorded elsewhere in orchids. The
   aim of this paper was to provide a detailed study of the reproductive
   biology of an Amazonian Heterotaxis, H. superflua, based on records of
   flowering phenology, floral morphology, pollinator behavior and breeding
   system. Heterotaxis superflua offers resin-like material to pollinators
   and is pollinated by a single species of stingless bee. The resin is a
   heterogeneous material rich in mucilage, starch and sugars, while
   lipoidal substances occur as small droplets. Chemical analyses confirm
   the presence of sugar, which explain the presence of reducing sugars and
   mucilage detected in the histochemical investigations. Our data also
   showed the Heterotaxis is self-compatible and pollinator dependent. This
   study demonstrates for the first time the collection of resin-like
   material in orchids. The gathering of resin is frequently associated
   with the nest construction, since this material is considered to be a
   water-repellent and has anti-pathogen chemical properties. Despite
   offering of a floral reward, fruit set under natural conditions is lower
   than for experimental pollinations, suggesting limited pollen flow
   within the population.}},

Abstract = {{Human-mediated introductions of species may have profound impacts on
   native ecosystems. One potential impact with largely unforeseen
   consequences is the potential admixture of introduced with autochthonous
   species through hybridization. Throughout the world, bumblebees have
   been deliberately introduced for crop pollination with known negative
   impacts on native pollinators. Given the likely allochthonous origin of
   commercial bumblebees used in Portugal (subspecies Bombus terrestris
   terrestris and B. t. dalmatinus), our aim was to assess their putative
   introgression with the native Iberian subspecies B. terrestris
   lusitanicus. We analysed one mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit I (COX1) and genomic data involving thousands of genome-wide
   restriction-site-associated DNA markers (RAD-seq). In the mitochondrial
   COX1 analyses, we detected one relatively common haplotype in commercial
   bumblebees, also present in wild samples collected nearby the
   greenhouses where the commercial hives are used. In the RAD-seq
   analysis, we found a clear genetic differentiation between native and
   commercial lineages. Furthermore, we detected candidate hybrids in the
   wild, as well as putatively escaped commercial bumblebees, some of which
   being potentially fertile males. Although we cannot assess directly the
   fitness effects of introgressed alleles, there is a risk of maladaptive
   allele introgression to the local bumblebee subspecies, which can
   negatively impact autochthon populations. One immediate recommendation
   to farmers is for the proper disposal of hive boxes, after their use in
   greenhouses, so as to minimize the risk of escapees contaminating native
   populations. On the other hand, the feasibility of using local
   subspecies B. t. lusitanicus, preferably with local production, should
   be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{How insects promote crop pollination remains poorly understood in terms
   of the contribution of functional trait differences between species. We
   used meta-analyses to test for correlations between community abundance,
   species richness and functional trait metrics with oilseed rape yield, a
   globally important crop. While overall abundance is consistently
   important in predicting yield, functional divergence between species
   traits also showed a positive correlation. This result supports the
   complementarity hypothesis that pollination function is maintained by
   non-overlapping trait distributions. In artificially constructed
   communities (mesocosms), species richness is positively correlated with
   yield, although this effect is not seen under field conditions. As
   traits of the dominant species do not predict yield above that
   attributed to the effect of abundance alone, we find no evidence in
   support of the mass ratio hypothesis. Management practices increasing
   not just pollinator abundance, but also functional divergence, could
   benefit oilseed rape agriculture.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination networks are usually constructed and assessed by direct
   field observations which commonly assume that all flower visitors are
   true pollinators. However, this assumption is often invalid and the use
   of data based on mere visitors to flowers may lead to a misunderstanding
   of intrinsic pollination networks. Here, using a large dataset by both
   sampling floral visitors and analyzing their pollen loads, we
   constructed 32 networks pairs (visitation versus pollen transport)
   across one flowering season at four elevation sites in the
   Himalaya-Hengduan Mountains region. Pollen analysis was conducted to
   determine which flower visitors acted as potential pollinators (pollen
   vectors) or as cheaters (those not carrying pollen of the visited
   plants). We tested whether there were topological differences between
   visitation and pollen transport networks and whether different taxonomic
   groups of insect visitors differed in their ability to carry pollen of
   the visited plants. Our results indicated that there was a significantly
   higher degree of specialization at both the network and species levels
   in the pollen transport networks in contrast to the visitation networks.
   Modularity was lower but nestedness was higher in the visitation
   networks compared to the pollen transport networks. All the cheaters
   were identified as peripheral species and most of them contributed
   positively to the nested structure. This may explain in part the
   differences in modularity and nestedness between the two network types.
   Bees carried the highest proportion of pollen of the visited plants.
   This was followed by Coleoptera, other Hymenoptera and Diptera.
   Lepidoptera carried the lowest proportion of pollen of the visited
   plants. Our study shows that the construction of pollen transport
   networks could provide a more in-depth understanding of plant-pollinator
   interactions. Moreover, it suggests that detecting and removing cheater
   interactions when studying the topology of other mutualistic networks
   might be also important.}},

Abstract = {{Urban landscapes are often florally rich due to extensive management of
   cultivated plants around the city. High abundance and diversity of these
   floral resources has been linked to more abundant and diverse pollinator
   communities, but little is known about how urban pollinators select from
   the wide variety of available flowers. This study provides unique
   insight into urban plant-pollinator interactions by examining how many
   plant taxa, and which taxa, are visited by pollinators. Over a
   three-year period, we observed foraging of urban pollinators across 63
   neighborhoods in Chicago, Illinois (USA). We observed 1815
   plant-pollinator interactions between 24 pollinator morpho-types and 106
   plant taxa. An additional 57 plant taxa were flowering but not visited
   by pollinators. On average, each pollinator morpho-type visited 19 plant
   taxa, and most pollinators showed generalist tendencies. We identified
   42 plant taxa that were visited by more pollinator morpho-types than
   their floral abundance would predict; we call these `highly attractive'
   plants. In general, perennial and native plants received more pollinator
   visits than their counterparts, and ornamental plants were visited by
   more species than unintentional `weeds'. However, the two most-visited
   plant taxa were non-native, perennial weeds. Our results suggest that
   many flowering plants in cities are not visited by pollinators.
   Furthermore, the plant-pollinator network could be reduced to only four
   plant taxa without losing any pollinator morpho-types. To enhance urban
   pollinator conservation, urban residents can select ornamental plants
   from our list of `highly attractive' plant taxa, or can allow some of
   the highly attractive `weeds' to persist in their gardens.}},

Abstract = {{Honeybees and other pollinators are threatened by changing landscapes
   and pesticides resulting from intensified agriculture. In 2018 the
   European Union prohibited the outdoor use of three neonicotinoid
   insecticides due to concerns about pollinators. A new pesticide by the
   name of Sivanto was recently released by Bayer AG. Its active ingredient
   flupyradifurone binds to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AchR) in
   the honeybee brain, similar to neonicotinoids. Nevertheless,
   flupyradifurone is assumed to be harmless for honeybees and can even be
   applied on flowering crops. So far, only little has been known about
   sublethal effects of flupyradifurone on honeybees. Intact motor
   functions are decisive for numerous behaviors including foraging and
   dancing. We therefore selected a motor assay to investigate in how far
   sublethal doses of this pesticide affect behavior in young summer and
   long-lived winter honeybees. Our results demonstrate that
   flupyradifurone (830 mu mol/l) can evoke motor disabilities and disturb
   normal motor behavior after a single oral administration (1.2 mu g/bee).
   These effects are stronger in long-lived winter bees than in young
   summer bees. After offering an equal amount of pesticide (1.0-1.75 mu g)
   continuously over 24h with food the observed effects are slighter. For
   comparisons we repeated our experiments with the neonicotinoid
   imidacloprid. Intriguingly, the alterations in behavior induced by this
   pesticide (4ng/bee) were different and longer-lasting compared to
   flupyradifurone, even though both substances bind to nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Honeybees are well recognised for their key role in plant reproduction
   as pollinators. On the other hand, their activity may vector some
   pathogens, such as the bacterium Erwinia amylovora, the causative agent
   of fire blight disease in pomaceous plants. In this research, we
   evaluated whether honeybees are able to discriminate between healthy and
   E. amylovora-infected flowers, thus altering the dispersal of the
   pathogen. For this reason, honeybees were previously trained to forage
   either on inoculated or healthy (control) apple flower. After the
   training, the two honeybee groups were equally exposed to inoculated and
   control flowering apple plants. To assess their preference, three
   independent methods were used: (1) direct count of visiting bees per
   time frame; (2) incidence on apple flowers of a marker bacterium
   (Pantoea agglomerans, strain P10c) carried by foragers; (3)
   quantification of E. amylovora populations in the collected pollen
   loads, proportional to the number of visits to infected flowers. The
   results show that both honeybee groups preferred control flowers over
   inoculated ones. The characterisation of volatile compounds released by
   flowers revealed a different emission of several bioactive compounds,
   providing an explanation for honeybee preference. As an unexpected
   ecological consequence, the influence of infection on floral scent
   increasing the visit rate on healthy flowers may promote a secondary
   bacterial spread.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The act of converting prairie grassland to agricultural farmland has
   negative implications for pollinator communities. In the Prairie Pothole
   Region, wetland remnants are a common feature in intensively cultivated
   landscapes. These wetlands are typically small and often left embedded
   in the cropland matrix and may act as the only semi-natural feature in a
   radius of several hundred metres. To quantify the role that these
   in-field wetlands play in supporting native pollinators, we sampled bees
   at three distances from the wetland margin into the surrounding cropland
   (0 m, 25 m and 75 m) across the season in three field types (canola,
   cereal and perennial grassland). We used Bayesian multilevel models to
   test the hypothesis that native bees are using infield wetlands as
   habitat for nesting and foraging. Native bee abundance and diversity
   decreased further away from the margin of wetlands in both canola and
   cereal fields, while it increased in wetlands located in perennial
   grassland. Community composition did not change further away from
   wetlands, which may be because the foraging range of most species was
   within the sampling distance of the study. These results suggest that
   wetlands play an important role in providing critical resources for
   native pollinators, and encouraging farmers not to drain or plow through
   these wetlands will have beneficial impacts for native pollinators in
   the area. Maintaining infield wetlands may have additional pollination
   benefits for farmers growing crops such as canola, which is known to
   benefit from insect visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids and the closely related insecticide classes sulfoximines
   and butenolides have recently attracted growing concerns regarding their
   potential negative effects on non-target organisms, including
   pollinators such as bees. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly clear that
   these effects may occur at much lower levels than those considered to be
   safe for humans. To properly assess the ecological and environmental
   risks posed by neonicotinoids, appropriate sampling and analytical
   procedures are needed. Here, we used honey as reliable environmental
   sampler and developed an unprecedentedly sensitive method based on
   QuEChERS and UHPLC-MS/MS for the simultaneous determination of the nine
   neonicotinoids and related molecules currently present on the market
   (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, flupyradifurone, imidacloprid,
   nitenpyram, sulfoxaflor, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam). The method was
   validated and provided excellent levels of precision and accuracy over a
   wide concentration range of 3-4 orders of magnitude. Lowest limits of
   quantification (LLOQs) as low as 2-20 pg/g of honey depending on the
   analytes were reached. The method was then applied to the analysis of 36
   honey samples from various regions of the World which had already been
   analysed for the five most common neonicotinoids (acetamiprid,
   clothianidin, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and thiamethoxam) in a previous
   study. This allowed us to determine the long-term stability (i.e. up to
   40 months) of these molecules in honey, both at room temperature and -20
   degrees C. We found that the five pesticides were stable over a period
   of several years at -20 degrees C, but that acetamiprid and thiacloprid
   partially degraded at room temperature. Finally, we also measured the
   levels of dinotefuran, nitenpyram, sulfoxaflor and fiupyradifurone and
   found that 28\% of the samples were contaminated by at least one of
   these pesticides. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effective monitoring of native bee populations requires accurate
   estimates of population size and relative abundance among habitats.
   Current bee survey methods, such as netting or pan trapping, may be
   adequate for a variety of study objectives but are limited by a failure
   to account for imperfect detection. Biases due to imperfect detection
   could result in inaccurate abundance estimates or erroneous insights
   about the response of bees to different environments. To gauge the
   potential biases of currently employed survey methods, we compared
   abundance estimates of bumblebees (Bombus spp.) derived from
   hierarchical distance sampling models (HDS) to bumblebee counts
   collected from fixed-area net surveys ({''}net counts{''}) and
   fixed-width transect counts ({''}transect counts{''}) at 47
   early-successional forest patches in Pennsylvania. Our HDS models
   indicated that detection probabilities of Bombus spp. were imperfect and
   varied with survey- and site-covariates. Despite being conspicuous,
   Bombus spp. were not reliably detected beyond 5 m. Habitat associations
   of Bombus spp. density were similar across methods, but the strength of
   association with shrub cover differed between HDS and net counts.
   Additionally, net counts suggested sites with more grass hosted higher
   Bombus spp. densities whereas HDS suggested that grass cover was
   associated with higher detection probability but not Bombus spp.
   density. Density estimates generated from net counts and transect counts
   were 80\%-89\% lower than estimates generated from distance sampling.
   Our findings suggest that distance modelling provides a reliable method
   to assess Bombus spp. density and habitat associations, while accounting
   for imperfect detection caused by distance from observer, vegetation
   structure, and survey covariates. However, detection/non-detection data
   collected via point-counts, line-transects and distance sampling for
   Bombus spp. are unlikely to yield species-specific density estimates
   unless individuals can be identified by sight, without capture. Our
   results will be useful for informing the design of monitoring programs
   for Bombus spp. and other pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the side effects of pesticides on pollinators is an
   important topic due to the increasing loss of pollinators. We aimed to
   determine the effects of chronic sublethal exposure of the neonicotinoid
   pesticide imidacloprid on the bumblebee Bombus terrestris under
   laboratory conditions. The analytical standard of imidacloprid in sugar
   solution was used for the treatment. Verification of pesticides using
   UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS in the experimental bumblebees showed the presence of
   only two compounds, imidacloprid and imidacloprid-olefin, which were
   found in quantities of 0.57 +/- 0.22 and 1.95 +/- 0.43 ng/g,
   respectively. Thus, the level of the dangerous metabolite
   imidacloprid-olefin was 3.4-fold higher than that of imidacloprid.
   Label-free nanoLC-MS/MS quantitative proteomics of bumblebee heads
   enabled quantitative comparison of 2883 proteins, and 206 proteins were
   significantly influenced by the imidacloprid treatment. The next
   analysis revealed that the highly downregulated markers are members of
   the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis pathway (KEGG: bter00900) and that
   imidacloprid treatment suppressed the entire mevalonate pathway, fatty
   acid synthesis and associated markers. The proteomics results indicate
   that the consequences of imidacloprid treatment are complex, and the
   marker changes are associated with metabolic and neurological diseases
   and olfaction disruption. This study provides important markers and can
   help to explain the widely held assumptions from biological
   observations. Significance: The major finding is that all markers of the
   mevalonate pathway were substantially downregulated due to the chronic
   imidacloprid exposure. The disbalance of mevalonate pathway has many
   important consequences. We suggest the mechanism associated with the
   novel toxicogenic effect of imidacloprid. The results are helpful to
   explain that imidacloprid impairs the cognitive functions and possesses
   the delayed and time cumulative effect.}},

Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is a critical ecosystem service underpinning the
   productivity of agricultural systems across the world. Wild insect
   populations provide a substantial contribution to the productivity of
   many crops and seed set of wild flowers. However, large-scale evidence
   on species-specific trends among wild pollinators are lacking. Here we
   show substantial inter-specific variation in pollinator trends, based on
   occupancy models for 353 wild bee and hoverfly species in Great Britain
   between 1980 and 2013. Furthermore, we estimate a net loss of over 2.7
   million occupied 1 km(2) grid cells across all species. Declines in
   pollinator evenness suggest that losses were concentrated in rare
   species. In addition, losses linked to specific habitats were
   identified, with a 55\% decline among species associated with uplands.
   This contrasts with dominant crop pollinators, which increased by 12\%,
   potentially in response agri-environment measures. The general declines
   highlight a fundamental deterioration in both wider biodiversity and
   non-crop pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{The study intended to compare repellency of three insecticides on bumble
   bees and honey bees in Norwegian red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) seed
   crops, and to examine effects of thiacloprid on bumble bee colony
   development in the field. The repellency study was carried out in a
   large-scale field trial in SE Norway in 2013. On average for
   observations during the first week after spraying, 17 and 40\% less
   honey bees (P = .03) and 26 and 20\% less bumble bees (P = .36) were
   observed on plots sprayed with the pyrethroids lambda-cyhalothrin and
   alpha-cypermethrin, respectively, than on unsprayed control plots. No
   pollinator repellency was found on plots sprayed with the neonicotinoid
   thiacloprid. Compared with unsprayed control the seed yield increases
   were 22\% on plots sprayed with thiacloprid vs. 12-13\% on plots sprayed
   with pyrethroids (P = .10). Follow-up studies in 2014-2016 focused on
   the effect of thiacloprid on bumble bee colony development in
   commercially reared nests of Bombus terrestris placed into red clover
   seed crops at the start of flowering. Unsprayed control crops were
   compared with crops sprayed either at the bud stage or when 18-44\% of
   flower heads were in full bloom. Chemical analyses of adult bumble bees
   showed that thiacloprid was taken up in bees when crops were sprayed
   during flowering, but not detected when crops were sprayed at the bud
   stage. The bumble bees in late-sprayed crops also developed weaker
   colonies than in unsprayed crops. Dead bees with a high internal
   concentration of thiacloprid were found in one crop sprayed during the
   night at 35\% flowering. This shows that thiacloprid is not bee-safe if
   sprayed after anthesis and that spraying has to be conducted at the bud
   stage to reduce its contamination of nectar and pollen.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity influences ecosystem function, but there is limited
   understanding of the mechanisms that support this relationship across
   different land use types in mosaic agroecosystems. Network approaches
   can help to understand how community structure influences ecosystem
   function across landscapes; however, in ecology, network analyses have
   largely focused on species-species interactions. Here, we use bipartite
   network analysis in a novel way: to link pollinator communities to sites
   in a tropical agricultural landscape. We used sentinel plants of
   Brassica rapa to examine how the structure of the community network
   influences plant reproduction. Diptera was the most common order of
   flower visitors at every site. Syrphidae visits were the strongest
   contributor to the number of fertilized pods, while visits by Syrphidae,
   Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera had the strongest effect on the number of
   seeds per pod. Sentinel pots at forest sites were visited by more unique
   species (i.e. species with higher d') than sites in other land uses, and
   dairy sites had more visitors that were common across the network.
   Participation coefficients, which indicate how connected a single node
   is across network modules, were strong predictors of ecosystem function:
   plant reproduction increased at sites with higher participation
   coefficients. Flower visitor taxa with higher participation coefficients
   also had the strongest effect on plant reproduction. Hymenoptera visits
   were the best predictor for participation coefficients but an Allograpta
   sp. (Diptera: Syrphidae) was the most influential flower visitor species
   in the landscape network. A diverse insect community contributed to
   plant reproduction and connection among nodes in this system.
   Identifying the `keystone' flower visitor species and sites that have a
   strong influence on network structure is a significant step forward to
   inform conservation priorities and decision-making in diverse
   agroecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Honey bee colony performance and health are intimately linked to the
   foraging environment. Recent evidence suggests that the US Conservation
   Reserve Program (CRP) has a positive impact on environmental suitability
   for supporting honey bee apiaries. However, relatively little is known
   about the influence of habitat conservation efforts on honey bee colony
   health. Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the
   colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across
   diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome
   individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers
   during critical pre-and post-winter time points. Major categories of
   colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity)
   were impacted by apiary site. In general, apiaries within foraging
   distance of CRP lands showed improved performance and higher gene
   expression of vitellogenin (vg), a nutritionally regulated protein with
   central storage and regulatory functions. Mirroring vg levels, gene
   transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and immune-related proteins
   were typically higher in colonies exposed to CRP environments. Our study
   highlights the potential of CRP lands to improve pollinator health and
   the utility of colony-level molecular diagnostics to assess
   environmental suitability for honey bees.}},

Title = {{Harmonic radar tracking reveals random dispersal pattern of bumblebee
   (Bombus terrestris) queens after hibernation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{The dispersal of animals from their birth place has profound effects on
   the immediate survival and longer-term persistence of populations.
   Molecular studies have estimated that bumblebee colonies can be
   established many kilometers from their queens' natal nest site. However,
   little is known about when and how queens disperse during their
   lifespan. One possible life stage when dispersal may occur, is directly
   after emerging from hibernation. Here, harmonic radar tracking of
   artificially over-wintered Bombus terrestris queens shows that they
   spend most of their time resting on the ground with intermittent very
   short flights (duration and distance). We corroborate these behaviors
   with observations of wild queen bees, which show similar prolonged
   resting periods between short flights, indicating that the behavior of
   our radar-monitored bees was not due to the attachment of transponders
   nor an artifact of the bees being commercially reared. Radar-monitored
   flights were not continuously directed away from the origin, suggesting
   that bees were not intentionally trying to disperse from their
   artificial emergence site. Flights did not loop back to the origin
   suggesting bees were not trying to remember or get back to the original
   release site. Most individuals dispersed from the range of the harmonic
   radar within less than two days and did not return. Flight directions
   were not different from a uniform distribution and flight lengths
   followed an exponential distribution, both suggesting random dispersal.
   A random walk model based on our observed data estimates a positive net
   dispersal from the origin over many flights, indicating a biased random
   dispersal, and estimates the net displacement of queens to be within the
   range of those estimated in genetic studies. We suggest that a distinct
   post-hibernation life history stage consisting mostly of rest with
   intermittent short flights and infrequent foraging fulfils the dual
   purpose of ovary development and dispersal prior to nest searching.}},

Abstract = {{Biomimetic systems often exhibit striking designs well adapted to
   specific functions that have been inspiring the development of new
   technologies. Herein, we explored the remarkable ability of honey bees
   to catch and release large quantities of pollen grains. Hair spacing and
   height on bees are crucial for their ability to mechanically fix pollen
   grains. Inspired by this, we proposed the concept of a micropatterned
   surface for microparticle entrapment, featuring high-aspect-ratio
   elastic micropillars spaced to mimic the hairy surface of bees. The
   hypothesis was validated by investigating the ability of
   polydimethylsiloxane microfabricated patches to fix microparticles. The
   geometrical arrangement, spacing, height, and flexibility of the
   fabricated micropillars, and the diameter of the microparticles, were
   investigated. Higher entrapment capability was found through the match
   between particle size and pillar spacing, being consistent with the
   observations that the diameter of pollen grains is similar to the
   spacing between hairs on bees' legs. Taller pillars permitted
   immobilization of higher quantities of particles, consistent with the
   high aspect ratio of bees' hairs. Our biomimetic surfaces were explored
   for their ability to fix solid microparticles for drug-release
   applications, using tetracycline hydrochloride as a model antibiotic.
   These surfaces allowed fixation of more than 20 mg/cm(2) of antibiotic,
   about five times higher dose than commercialized patches (5.1 mg/cm(2)).
   Such bioinspired hairy surfaces could find applications in a variety of
   fields where dry fixation of high quantities of micrometer-sized objects
   are needed, including biomedicine, agriculture, biotechnology/chemical
   industry, and cleaning utensils.}},

Abstract = {{The non-target effects of pesticides are an area of growing concern,
   particularly for ecologically and economically important organisms such

   a class of insecticide that has gained attention for non-target effects,
   on bees focused on the consumption of contaminated food resources by a
   limited number of eusocial species. However, neonicotinoids are known to
   accumulate and persist in soils at concentrations 2 to 60 times greater

   pesticide, on bee longevity, development speed, and body mass. Cohorts

Abstract = {{The year-to-year variations in flowering, pollen and fruit production in
   ten Gmelina arborea individuals in a natural forest were observed over a
   period of five years, 2009-2013, and pollinator visits were observed
   closely over two years, 2011 and 2012. A pollen supplementation
   experiment was also undertaken in two years (2011 and 2012) of
   contrasting flowering levels. Considerable year-to-year variations were
   observed in flower, pollen and fruit production. The observed variation
   represented a normal sequence of good-year and poor-year cycling which
   is most parsimoniously attributed to resource allocation. The average
   level of pollen production per individual tree in good flowering years
   oscillated between 6.6 and 9.62 x 10(8), which in the poor flowering
   years was between 1.92 and 3.07 x 10(8). The magnitude of pollen
   limitation across years was highly significant (p < 0.0001). Fruit set
   through supplemental pollination was 73\% and 96\% greater than that of
   the open-pollinated branches in the year 2011 and 2012, respectively.
   Pollen limitation, irrespective of the arrival of outcross pollen, can
   reduce annual seed set in predominantly bee-pollinated trees. However,
   various other factors may cause flower abortion in addition to pollen
   limitation. The results of this study would be very valuable to the seed
   orchard managers and the silviculturists to manage the seed production
   areas (SPAs) of G. arborea. The study ultimately recommends supplemental
   pollination in seed orchards of G. arborea for better genetic gain and
   good seed yield.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, some bumble bee species have declined, including in
   North America. Declines have been reported in species of bumble bees
   historically present in Ontario, including: yellow bumble bee (Bombus
   fervidus) (Fabricus, 1798), American bumble bee (Bombus pensylvanicus)
   (DeGeer, 1773), and yellow-banded bumble bee (Bombus terricola) (Kirby,
   1837). Threats contributing to bumble bee population declines include:
   land-use changes, habitat loss, climate change, pathogen spillover, and
   pesticide use. A response to the need for action on pollinator
   preservation in North America has been to encourage `bee-friendly'
   plantings. Previous studies show differences in common and at-risk
   bumble bee foraging; however, similar data are unavailable for Ontario.
   Our research question is whether there is a difference in co-occurring
   at-risk and common bumble bee (Bombus spp.) floral use (including nectar
   and pollen collection) in protected areas in southern Ontario. We
   hypothesize that common and at-risk species forage differently,
   predicting that at-risk species forage on a limited selection of host
   plants. We conducted a field survey of sites in southern Ontario, using
   observational methods to determine bumble bee foraging by species. The
   results of a redundancy analysis show a difference in foraging between
   common and at-risk bumblebee species. At-risk bumble bee species show a
   preference for foraging on invasive, naturalized Vicia cracca (tufted
   vetch). This finding raises the question of how to preserve or provide
   forage for at-risk bumble bees, when they show an association with an
   invasive species often subject to control in protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification and landscape simplification have reduced
   flowering plant abundance and diversity worldwide, with subsequent
   negative effects on pollinators. To mitigate these effects, research and
   conservation have focused on incorporating flowering plants into
   agricultural landscapes through on-farm natural areas or flowering
   crops. However, while cover crops provide numerous agroecosystem
   services, they have received little attention for their role in
   providing floral resources for pollinators. In this study, we examined
   the value of cover crops for providing supplemental summer floral
   resources for both managed and wild bees in the Northern Great Plains of
   the United States, where a large proportion of honey bee colonies spend
   the summer. Specifically, using an experimental randomized plot design,
   we compared floral resources and bee visitation rates across 1, 2, 3,
   and 6-species cover crop mixes as well a 6-species annual native
   wildflower mix. We found that cover crop treatments including buckwheat
   provided the highest summer-long floral cover, higher than the annual
   native wildflower mix in which only two of six species bloomed, and that
   total bee visitation rates increased with higher floral cover. However,
   different bees were attracted to different treatments; honey bees and
   bumble bees were most attracted to mixes containing phacelia, while
   large-bodied solitary bees were more attracted to mixes including
   cultivated sunflower and to the wildflower mix, illustrating that the
   optimal plantings for attracting social or managed bees may differ from
   those attracting solitary wild bees. Additionally, while similar numbers
   of bee species visited the three main plants in our treatments
   (buckwheat, phacelia, and cultivated sunflower) more rare species
   visited cultivated sunflower while more common bees visited buckwheat
   and phacelia. Our results highlight the value of annual cover crops for
   providing pollinator resources in agricultural landscapes, particularly
   on rotated land where perennial flower plantings are less feasible, but
   illustrate trade-offs between attracting a large number of common
   generalist or managed bees versus attracting fewer individuals but
   species of potential conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed in 2009, 2015 and 2018, at urban areas of
   Petrolina (state of Pernambuco) and Juazeiro (state of Bahia), at the
   SSo Francisco valley, Brazilian Northeast. Trees were identified and
   investigated for the presence of Plebeia aff. flavocincta nests, in
   three years: 2009, 2015 and 2018. Data on height at nest entrance (HNE),
   tree diameter at nest entrance (DNE) and tree diameter at breast height
   (DBH) were obtained. Trees containing nests were identified and
   geo-referenced. In Petrolina and Juazeiro, the percentage of bees nests
   in all checked trees was smaller in 2009 (3.94\% and 0.56\%) than in
   2015 (1.92\% and 5.26\%) and in 2018 (21.21\% and 3.66\%). This increase
   (especially in Petrolina) suggests P. aff. flavocincta is well adapted
   to urban environments and food and/or nesting resources might be
   improved along the years. On the other hand, survival of nests was not
   high: only two nests found in 2009 survived up to 2018. Mortality of
   nests was mainly due to the cutting of trees. Simultaneously, according
   to observations, swarming probably occurs, what might have improved the
   number of nests observed in 2018. The vegetal species most used by the
   bees was Prosopis juliflora (84.38\%). Considering all data, the HNE,
   DNE, and DHB varied among the cities and years, but the differences were
   not significant in most of the cases. In Juazeiro, two nests were found
   also in a wall and another one in a pipe showing the diversity of
   nesting habits of the species. It is remarkable that despite high levels
   of stress (caused by noise, pollution, and human interferences) these

Abstract = {{Brahma's lotus (Saussurea obvallata (DC.) Edgew.: Asteraceae) that grows
   near the permanent snow line in the Himalaya, is one of several
   so-called ``glasshouse{''} plants, which enclose their inflorescences in
   large translucent bracts. Around the temple of Kedarnath (Uttarakhand:
   India), where this study was conducted, the inflorescences are harvested
   for offerings and for sale to pilgrims. In addition, the plant has many
   medicinal uses. We report on the reproductive biology of S. obvallata
   with the aim of understanding its distinctive morphology and also to
   gain insight into how it might respond to harvesting. The main questions
   were: (1) How does population density vary in relation to altitude? (2)
   What is the flowering and leafing phenology of S. obvallata? (3) Do
   populations differ in morphology? (4) Does the pollen to ovule ratio
   suggest outcrossing? (5) What pollinates S. obvallata, and how does
   visitation rate vary across sites? (6) Is the species self-compatible?
   (7) Does it require pollinators for seed production? (8) Is seed set
   pollen-limited? (9) Do the bracts enhance seed set, and (10) Is the
   species semelparous? To answer these questions, we recorded population
   density and floral visitors across an elevational gradient, conducted
   pollinator exclusion and hand-pollination experiments, modified floral
   morphology by folding back the bracts of experimental plants, and
   observed the life cycle. We found that the flowers were pollinated by
   rufous-striped bumblebees, Bombus rufofasciatus Smith, which are strong
   enough to separate and clamber between the whorled bracts.
   Paradoxically, visitation rates were higher at lower elevation, whereas
   the plants survived better at higher elevation. The bracts enhanced seed
   production, probably by keeping the inflorescences dry and warm during
   the wet monsoon (August). Despite the reduction of density due to
   harvesting, plants at one site were not pollen-limited and were capable
   of autonomous self-pollination. Nevertheless, seed set was somewhat
   higher in plants left open to receive pollinator visits.
   Self-compatibility and iteroparity are predicted to render the species
   less sensitive to the harvesting of inflorescences that some other
   Saussurea species, which are semelparous and self-incompatible. However,
   the currently high rate of harvesting highlights the need for monitoring
   and for a resource management strategy. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by

Abstract = {{On-farm pollinator refuge habitats can supplement floral and nesting
   resources to support wild and managed pollinator communities. Although
   the popularity of installing these habitats has grown, and federal
   programs provide technical and financial advice to participating
   landowners, recommendations regarding habitat establishment and species
   composition vary. We examined the effects of seedbed preparation, seed
   mix composition, and herbicide applications on pollinator refuge
   establishment and pollinator visitation in a controlled experiment
   across 2 years. Seedbeds were prepared either by a no-till method with
   glyphosate herbicide or by repeated conventional inversion tillage. Seed
   mixes contained either nine annual, biennial, and perennial forbs (mix
   AP); seven annual, biennial, and perennial forbs that are tolerant to
   imazapic herbicide (mix IT); or nine perennial forbs (mix P). Mixes AP
   and P were grown with and without application of the graminicide
   herbicide sethoxydim and mix IT was grown with application of the
   herbicide imazapic. Seedbed preparation methodology had a strong impact
   on pollinator refuge establishment. A no-till approach generated greater
   wildflower and lower weed cover relative to tillage, leading to a
   greater number of blooms. In particular, there were more Indian blanket,
   purple coneflower, slender mountain mint, and wild bergamot blooms
   following a no-till seedbed preparation, indicating that certain species
   are more vulnerable to the effects of tillage than others. The AP and IT
   treatments displayed more wildflower and less weed percent cover than
   the P treatments during the first year, but in the second year
   wildflower and weed cover were similar across all mixes grown with and
   without herbicide. Overall pollinator abundance, which was dominated by
   native bees, correlated positively with wildflower bloom counts,
   suggesting that habitat establishment methods that increase wildflower
   blooms can positively affect the pollinator conservation value of the
   habitats. This research indicates that establishing on-farm wildflower
   habitats can be most successful with no-till seedbed preparation, a
   mixture of annual, biennial, and perennial forb species, and that
   herbicides applied after planting wildflowers may not be worth the costs
   of application.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of model parameters plays a very important role in
   modeling solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. In the past decade,
   meta-heuristic algorithms (MHAs) have been used as promising methods for
   solving this problem. However, due to the non-linearity and
   multi-modality existed in the problem, many HMAs may present
   unsatisfactory performance due to their premature or slow convergence.
   Therefore, how to develop algorithms efficiently balancing the
   exploration and exploitation, and identify the PV model parameters
   accurately and reliably is still a big challenge. In this paper, to
   improve parameter estimation of solar photovoltaic models, we propose a
   hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm, called biogeography-based heterogeneous
   cuckoo search (BHCS) algorithm. Specifically, BHCS hybridizes cuckoo
   search (CS) and biogeography-based optimization (BBO) by employing two
   search strategies, namely heterogeneous cuckoo search and
   biogeography-based discovery. The cooperation of the two strategies
   helps BHCS achieve an efficient balance between exploration and
   exploitation. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is applied to solve
   four parameters estimation problems of different photovoltaic models,
   including single diode model, double diode model and two PV panel
   modules. Experimental results demonstrate that BHCS has very competitive
   performance in terms of accuracy and reliability compared with CS, BBO
   and several other meta-heuristic algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Context Small forest fragments are often the most abundant type of
   semi-natural habitat in intensive agricultural landscapes. Wild
   pollinators can use these forest patches as nesting or foraging habitat.
   However, the importance of small forest fragments as pollinator habitat
   has been neglected so far.
   Objectives We evaluated the role of these forest patches as pollinator
   habitat, focusing on the effect of nesting and foraging resources, both
   at a local and at a landscape scale.
   Methods Pollinators were sampled with pan traps in 78 forest patches,
   spread over five study regions in Northwestern Europe. We evaluated
   effect of forest and landscape characteristics on bee and hoverfly
   species richness, diversity and activity-abundance.
   Results We showed that the bee community is influenced by both microsite
   conditions and landscape characteristics. Species richness and
   activity-abundance were higher when suitable nesting resources, such as
   sloped terrain and bare soil were available. This suggests that forest
   edges are important in providing nesting sites, but that most species
   forage in different habitats. Hoverfly species richness was higher in
   old forest fragments. This relation was mainly caused by the presence of
   forest specialist hoverflies in old forest fragments.
   Conclusions Small forest fragments in agricultural landscapes can
   harbour a diverse pollinator community. Increasing the amount of nesting
   habitat, such as bare soil and sloped terrains is expected to have
   beneficial effects on the bee community, whereas older forest fragments
   should be conserved to sustain a rich hoverfly community.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological adaptations between flowers and pollinators are thought to
   reflect natural selection by excluding ineffective pollinators and
   increasing pollination efficiency. Previous studies have reported a
   variety of tube or spur flower shapes that influence the functional fit
   between pollinator and plant. However, little is known about the open'
   flower types, which like those of Ranunuculus s.l. are interpreted as
   generalist flowers'. However, petals in Ranunuculus s.l. have nectary
   scales which vary in shape, and to determine whether their diversity
   reflects adaptation to different pollinator traits, we compared
   Ranunculus japonicus with flap-like nectary scales to Halerpestes
   ruthenica and Batrachium bungei with cup-like and ring-like nectary
   scales. Visitation rate, visit duration and pollinator efficiency of
   each group were compared to distinguish true pollinators from visitors.
   Regression analysis was also used to identify potential correlation
   between different petal nectary scale shapes and morphological traits of
   proboscides of pollinators. Our results reveal that flap-like nectary
   scales exclude hoverflies from accessing nectar and increase both the
   length of visits by small bees and pollen transfer efficiency. In
   contrast, cup- and ring-like nectary scales partially allowed nectar
   access to hoverflies. To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the
   first time that pollinator mouthparts are the main driver of nectary
   shape rather than body and size.}},

Abstract = {{Animals that feed from resources that are constant in space and that

   Hummingbirds, like other central-place foragers, use short traplines
   when moving between several rewarding sites. Here we investigated
   whether traplining hummingbirds also use relevant temporal information
   when choosing which flowers to visit. Wild rufous hummingbirds that were
   allowed to visit 3 artificial flower patches in which flowers were
   refilled 20 min after they had been depleted repeated the order in which
   they visited the 3 patches. Although they tended to visit the first 2
   patches sooner than 20 min, they visited the third patch at
   approximately 20-min intervals. The time between visits to the patches
   increased across the experiment, suggesting that the birds learned to
   wait longer before visiting a patch. The birds appeared to couple the
   sequential pattern of a trapline with temporal regularity, to some
   degree. This suggests that there is a temporal component to the repeated
   spatial movements flown by foraging wild hummingbirds.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects have been associated with actinobacteria in protective
   symbiosis where antimicrobial metabolites inhibit host pathogens.
   However, the microbiota of neotropical insects such as the stingless-bee
   Tetragonisca angustula is poorly explored. T. angustula is a meliponid
   bee widely distributed in Latin America, its honey is traditionally
   exploited because of its ethno-pharmacological properties and its
   antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated. Also, the well-structured
   nest of this species allows exploration of the microbiota of its
   different components. Even though Streptomyces spp. have been cultured
   from stingless-bees, little is known about their role in this
   insect-microbe relationship. In this study, we examined the association
   between culturable actinobacteria and T. angustula, and evaluated the
   isolates' potential as antimicrobial producers. We isolated 51
   actinobacteria from adult bees and different substrates of the hive of
   T. angustula (pollen and honey storage, garbage pellets and cerumen). We
   then performed a 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis that clusters the
   bacteria to previously described lineages of host-associated
   Streptomyces. In addition, all the isolates were classified according to
   their antibacterial activity against human pathogens, measured by a
   growth inhibition test based on diffusion in agar. More than 50\% of our
   isolates exhibit antimicrobial activity, mainly to Gram-positive
   bacteria and fungi and only two against Gram-negative bacteria.
   Additionally, we obtained electron micrographs of adult bees with what
   appears to be patches of hyphae with Streptomyces-like cell morphology
   on their body surface. Our results suggest that T. angustula possibly
   uptakes and transfers actinobacteria from the environment, acting as
   vectors for these potentially beneficial organisms. This research
   provides new insights regarding the microbiota associated with T.
   angustula and justify future studies exploring the full diversity of the
   microbial community associated with the hive and the possible exchange
   of microbes with the crops they pollinate.}},

Title = {{The effect of management practices on bumblebee densities in hedgerow

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{28-33}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale declines in pollinator species are a concern at present.
   Such declines have been attributed to a range of factors that act in
   tandem, rather than in isolation. Some of the most pervasive factors
   affecting pollinator populations are habitat loss and degradation, which
   results in the loss of floral resources, nesting sites and landscape
   connectivity. Intensification of agriculture and urbanisation are two
   major causes of such habitat alterations. Hedgerows and grasslands are
   two vital habitats for pollinators in European landscapes. When managed
   appropriately, these habitats may provide abundant floral resources and
   nesting opportunities, as well as connectivity between habitats in a
   fragmented landscape. This study examined the effects that management
   practices of hedgerows and grasslands may have on bumblebee species, an
   important group of wild pollinators. Bumblebee abundance was recorded
   using transect walks in managed and unmanaged sites, including both
   hedgerows and grasslands. Greater densities of bumblebees were found in
   unmanaged grasslands in comparison to managed grasslands. Unmanaged
   hedgerows were also found to have a greater density of bumblebees than
   managed hedgerows. These results indicate that sites which are less
   intensively managed provide a more suitable habitat for bumblebees.
   Therefore, our study underlines the importance of (a) enforcing
   restrictions on hedge-cutting, and (b) reducing the management intensity
   of grasslands to provide adequate habitat for pollinators. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Plant species vary greatly in the number and diversity of floral
   visitors with which they interact. Even so, pollination ecologists have
   focused mainly on direct pairwise interactions (mutualists), overlooking
   indirect effects produced by different agents, such as floral larcenists
   and flower-dwelling predators. In our study area in Brazil, the
   pollen-flowers of Chamaecrista ramosa (Fabaceae) harbour Misumenops sp.
   (Thomisidae) spiders, a flower-dwelling predator with unknown signalling
   strategy. We measured the effect of Misumenops on the foraging behaviour
   of three bee species, one behaving as a pollen robber (Trigona spinipes)
   and two as pollinators (Xylocopa ordinaria and X. hirsutissima), and the
   consequences for plant fitness. The presence of Misumenops reduced the
   frequency of Trigona bee visits and increased the proportion of
   undamaged anthers, and thus pollen available to Xylocopa bees, which
   seemed unaffected by spider presence. However, spider presence
   (detectable by both Trigona and Xylocopa bees through achromatic and
   chromatic contrasts) had no effect on fruit and seed set when compared
   to flowers without spiders. Thus, the apparently antagonistic
   interaction between Trigona and flowers can represent a commensalism,
   modulated by differences between pollinators and larcenists regarding
   the window of foraging activity, as well as regarding foraging
   efficiency. The results also indicate that the quantitative impact of
   predators of floral visitor on plant fitness will be highly dependent on
   context in species with specialized pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{The bee avoidance' hypothesis posits that the colour of

   However, many hummingbird-pollinated plants possess bracts, and the role
   of bract colour in bee avoidance has not previously been tested. We
   assessed the signal value of bract colours by comparing them with the
   petals of species with and without bracts. We expected the bracts would
   contrast and enhance the petal signal more to hummingbirds than to bees,
   especially in long-tubed flowers. We compared bract signals in the
   hummingbird and bee visual systems, petal signals between the bract and
   leaf background, and the relationship between flower length and bract
   colour. For species with bracts, the bracts contrasted more than petals
   in the hummingbird visual system, but less in the bee visual system.
   Petals contrasted more with the bract background than with the leaf
   background to hummingbirds, but not to bees. Bract colours of long-tubed
   flowers contrasted less than those of short-tubed flowers to bees. Our

Abstract = {{After several decades of research, dynamics and patterns of mating
   system in floral evolution remain incompletely understood, especially
   with regards to strategies that combine both outcrossing and selfing, as
   frequently recorded in the genus Campanula. Data about temporal and
   spatial dynamics of secondary pollen presentation are still scarce in
   literature: we investigated them using Campanula medium (Campanulaceae)
   as case study. Experimental pollinations were conducted under natural
   conditions, to characterise the breeding system of this species. Effects
   on stigma opening and stigma receptivity of stylar pollen presence were
   investigated in manipulated flowers. The temporal dynamics and fitness
   of male and female functional phases were estimated. Flower visitors and
   their interactions with sexual parts of the flower were also annotated.
   C. medium is xenogamous and self-incompatible, with a clear temporal
   separation between sexual functional phases. Floral lifespan is
   shortened by experimental outcrossing. Removal of pollen from the style
   shortened the time span of male function. Pollen viability was highest
   at the beginning of the anthesis, decreasing during the flowering
   period, whereas stigmatic receptivity shows an opposite trend. We found
   a severe pollen limitation in the studied population. Bees were the most
   frequent floral visitors. In some of these insects we observed
   stereotyped interactions with the reproductive structures of the flower,
   in particular with the pollen, exposed along the upper and median
   portion of the style. Sexual phases in C. medium are inversely
   correlated and finely spatially and temporally coordinated, since stigma
   maturation is scalar along its length and depends on pollen presence on
   the style. Overall, our findings push forward the knowledge on
   reproductive strategies in Campanula.}},

   coverage spectrum of invasive goldenrods, and surveyed the abundance and
   diversity of pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and hover flies) and
   native plants. The species richness of native plants decreased linearly
   with goldenrod cover, whereas the abundance and species richness of bees
   and butterflies decreased non-linearly with increasing goldenrod cover.
   However, no statistically significant changes across goldenrod cover
   were noted for the abundance and species richness of hover flies.
   Because of the non-linear response, goldenrod had no visible impact on
   bees and butterflies until it reached cover in a habitat of about 50\%
   and 30-40\%, respectively. Moreover, changes driven by goldenrod in the
   plant and pollinator communities were related to species loss rather
   than species replacement. We demonstrated that the impact of goldenrod
   cover on a habitat is not instantaneous. Habit management aimed at
   preventing the invasion process and alleviating its impact should take
   into account that, for the non-linear relationships, the negative impact
   can appear rapidly after crossing the threshold point.}},

Abstract = {{Fire, a frequent disturbance in the Mediterranean, affects pollinator
   communities. We explored the response of major pollinator guilds to fire
   severity, across a fire-severity gradient at different spatial scales.
   We show that the abundance of all pollinator groups responded to fire
   severity, and that bees and beetles showed in addition a significant
   species-diversity response. Bees, sawflies, and wasps responded to fire
   severity at relatively small spatial scales (250-300 m), whereas flies
   and beetles responded at larger spatial scales. The response of bees,
   sawflies, and wasps was unimodal, as predicted by the intermediate
   disturbance hypothesis, whereas flies and beetles showed a negative
   response. A possible explanation is that the observed patterns (spatial
   scale and type of response) are driven by taxa-specific ecological and
   life-history traits, such as nesting preference and body size, as well
   as the availability of resources in the postfire landscape. Our
   observational study provides an insight into the effect of fire severity
   on pollinators. However, future research exploring the explicit link
   between the pre- and postfire landscape structure and pollinator traits
   and responses is required for further establishment and understanding of

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Conversion of annual crops to native perennial grasslands for bioenergy
   production may help conserve wild bees by enhancing nest and food
   resources. However, bee response to the disturbance of biomass
   harvesting may depend on their nesting location, thus their
   vulnerability to nest destruction, and the response of the forb
   community on which they forage. Moreover, because bees have long
   foraging ranges, effects of local harvesting may depend on the amount of
   natural habitat in the surrounding landscape. We performed a large-scale
   one- and two-year experiment in Michigan and Wisconsin, USA,
   respectively, to examine how grassland harvesting, landscape context,
   and study year affect the forb community, above- and belowground-nesting
   bee species richness, community composition, trap nest emergence, and
   visitation rate. In Wisconsin, harvesting increased forb richness,
   cover, and evenness compared to unharvested control sites. Harvesting
   negatively affected aboveground-nesting bee richness and emergence from
   trap nests, possibly because of nest destruction during the previous
   harvest. By contrast, harvesting positively affected belowground-nesting
   bee richness, possibly because of the greater food resource availability
   and reduced thatch allowing greater access to nesting sites in the soil.
   Harvesting also affected bee community composition, reflecting the
   increase in belowground-nesting species at harvested sites. Despite
   harvesting effects on forb and bee communities, there was no effect on
   flower visitation rate, indicating little effect on pollination
   function. We did not find a harvest by landscape context interaction,
   which, in combination with the negative harvesting effect on trap nest
   emergence, suggests that harvesting can affect local population growth
   rather than simply affecting forager aggregation in different resource
   environments. For bees, there was no harvest by study year interaction,
   indicating a consistent response over a short timescale. Similarly, in
   Michigan, belowground-nesting species also responded positively to
   harvesting, which was more pronounced in sandier soils that are
   preferred for nesting. However, other components of the Michigan bee and
   forb communities were not significantly affected by biomass harvesting.
   Overall, our study demonstrates that harvesting grasslands can
   positively affect the similar to 80\% of bee species that nest
   belowground by enhancing nest and/or forage resources, but that
   conserving aboveground nesters may require leaving some area
   unharvested.}},

Abstract = {{The response of animals to the edge reveals the potential mechanism
   underlying the impact of invasive plants on native pollinators. Many
   invasive plants flower only during a part of the growing season, which
   creates a temporal pattern of the availability of resources. This can
   lead to the emergence or disappearance of the edge effect in the
   pollinator community in the patches dominated by alien plants. We tested
   whether the variability in the supply of flower resources created by
   dense stands of flowering invasive goldenrods could create a temporal
   edge effect for pollinating insects in a grassland landscape. We
   surveyed pollinator communities along transects perpendicular to the
   goldenrod-grassland edge. To understand the variation in edge effects,
   we surveyed the number of flowers, which are the main food resources for
   pollinators. We found positive edge responses of abundance and species
   richness of all pollinator groups from the edges to the grassland
   interior before the goldenrod flowering period. During the goldenrod
   flowering period abundance and species richness of bees showed a neutral
   edge response, the response of butterflies and hoverflies towards the
   centre of the goldenrod patch were negative and positive respectively.
   Our results revealed that the emergence of the edge effect in a
   pollinating insect community is associated with temporal usability of
   invasive plants as a food source. Thus, the combined outcome of the
   available resources and invasion of alien plants can help to understand
   the edge effect on pollinator distributions in the invaded landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{In order to carry out the evaluation, control and maximum power point
   tracking on photovoltaic (PV) systems, accurate and reliable model
   parameter identification of PV cell and module is always desired. In
   this study, a performance-guided JAYA (PGJAYA) algorithm is proposed for
   extracting parameters of different PV models. In proposed PGJAYA
   algorithm, the individual performance in the whole population is
   quantified through probability. Then, based on probability, each
   individual can self-adaptively select different evolution strategies
   designed for balancing exploration and exploitation abilities to conduct
   the searching process. Meanwhile, the quantified performance is employed
   to select the exemplar to construct the promising searching direction.
   In addition, a self-adaptive chaotic perturbation mechanism is
   introduced around the current best solution to explore more better
   solution for replacing the worst one, thus improving the quality of
   whole population. The parameters estimation performance of PGJAYA is
   evaluated through three widely used standard datasets of different PV
   models including single diode, double diode, and PV module. Comparative
   and statistical results demonstrate that PGJAYA has a superior
   performance as it always obtains the most accurate parameters with
   strong robustness among all compared algorithms. Furthermore, the tests
   based on experimental data from the data sheet of different types of PV
   modules suggest that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior results
   at different irradiance and temperature. Based on these superiorities,
   it is concluded that PGJAYA is a promising parameter identification
   method for PV cell and module model.}},

Abstract = {{Enhancing floral resources is a widely accepted strategy for supporting
   wild bees and promoting crop pollination. Planning effective
   enhancements can be informed with pollination service models, but these
   models should capture the behavioural and spatial dynamics of
   service-providing organisms. Model predictions, and hence management
   recommendations, are likely to be sensitive to these dynamics. We used
   two established models of pollinator foraging to investigate whether
   habitat enhancement improves crop visitation; whether this effect is
   influenced by pollinator foraging distance and landscape pattern; and
   whether behavioural detail improves model predictions. The more detailed
   central place foraging model better predicted variation in bee
   visitation observed between habitat types, because it includes optimized
   trade-offs between patch quality and distance. Both models performed
   well when predicting visitation rates across broader scales. Using real
   agricultural landscapes and simulating habitat enhancements, we show
   that additional floral resources can have diverging effects on predicted
   crop visitation. When only co-flowering resources were added, optimally
   foraging bees concentrated in enhancements to the detriment of crop
   pollination. For both models, adding nesting resources increased crop
   visitation. Finally, the marginal effect of enhancements was greater in
   simple landscapes. Synthesis and applications. Model results help to
   identify the conditions under which habitat enhancements are most likely
   to increase pollination services in agriculture. Three design principles
   for pollinator habitat enhancement emerge: (a) enhancing only flowers
   can diminish services by distracting pollinators away from crops, (b)
   providing nesting resources is more likely to increase bee populations
   and crop visitation and (c) the benefit of enhancements will be greatest
   in landscapes that do not already contain abundant habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Providing noncrop flowering resources in agricultural landscapes is
   widely promoted as a strategy to support arthropods that deliver
   pollination and pest control services. However, management options have
   largely been developed separately for pollinators and natural enemies,
   whereas possible effects on insect herbivores, such as crop pests, have
   often been overlooked. A first critical step for design and
   implementation of multifunctional plantings that promote beneficial
   arthropods while controlling insect pests is to identify suitable plant
   species to use. We aimed to identify California native plants and, more
   generally, plant traits suitable for the coordinated management of
   pollinators (wild bees and honeybees), insect herbivores and arthropod
   natural enemies (predators and parasitic wasps). We established 43 plant
   species in a common garden experiment and sampled arthropods by weekly
   netting (wild bees), observations (honeybees), or vacuum sampling
   (insect herbivores, arthropod predators, and parasitic wasps) during
   peak bloom of each plant species over 2 years. Plant species differed in
   attractiveness for each arthropod functional group. Floral area of the
   focal plant species positively affected honeybee, predator, and
   parasitic wasp attractiveness. Later bloom period was associated with
   lower numbers of parasitic wasps. Flower type (actinomorphic, composite,
   or zygomorphic) predicted attractiveness for honeybees, which preferred
   actinomorphic over composite flowers and for parasitic wasps, which
   preferred composite flowers over actinomorphic flowers. Across plant
   species, herbivore, predator, and parasitic wasp abundances were
   positively correlated, and honeybee abundance correlated negatively to
   herbivore abundance. Synthesis and applications. We use data from our
   common garden experiment to inform evidence-based selection of plants
   that support pollinators and natural enemies without enhancing potential
   pests. We recommend selecting plant species with a high floral area per
   ground area unit, as this metric predicts the abundances of several
   groups of beneficial arthropods. Multiple correlations between
   functionally important arthropod groups across plant species stress the
   importance of a multifunctional approach to arthropod habitat
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The fact that different phylogenomic data sets can lead to highly

   2013, 23, 2058), in which ants and Apoidea (bees and spheciform wasps)
   were recovered as sister groups, contradicting previous studies. We
   found high levels of topological variation among gene trees, several of
   them disagreeing with previously published hypotheses. To profile the
   dynamics of emerging support versus conflicting signal in combined
   analysis of data, we employed a novel method based on the incremental
   addition of randomized data to coalescence-based phylogenetic inference.
   Although the monophyly of Aculeata and of Formicidae were consistently
   recovered using as little as 6.5\% of the 308 available markers, signal
   for the Formicidae + Apoidea clade prevailed only after more than 50\%
   of the loci were sampled. Still, non-negligible support for alternative
   hypotheses remained until all genes were added to the analysis. Our
   results suggest that phylogenetic conflict is rather pervasive and not
   scattered as noise across individual gene trees because alternative
   topologies were recovered not from a specific subset, but from several
   random combinations of loci. Thus, even though phylogenetic signal
   recovered from full gene data sets was already dominant in much smaller

Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Worldwide, bees have an important role in ecosystem function and the
   provision of ecosystem services through their role as pollinators. The
   diversity of bee species in rural landscapes is influenced by the type
   of landscape features present, and by land-use and management practices.
   A key challenge is to understand and predict how species vary across the
   landscape; and the role of functional traits in determining
   compositional patterns. We systematically sampled wild bees in four
   types of landscape feature - open farmland, scattered farmland trees,
   roadside vegetation and streamside vegetation - in rural landscapes in
   southern Australia. Landscapes were selected to represent wooded or
   non-wooded combinations of these site types (e.g. roadside vegetation
   with or without trees), embedded in farmland with different land-uses
   (e.g. cropping, grazing). The species richness and abundance of bees was
   greater at sites containing little or no tree cover; and the cumulative
   richness of species was greater for tree-less sites than for those with
   trees. In contrast, species evenness was greatest in wooded site types,
   indicating these were less dominated by abundant generalist species.
   Open farmland and treeless road-sides had greater functional diversity
   (based on species traits) than wooded site types. Strong species trait
   associations were more numerous with open parts of the landscape,
   reflecting the greater functional diversity of open site types. These
   results suggest that a suite of the extant bee fauna can exploit
   large-scale transformation from former extensively wooded ecosystems to
   open agricultural landscapes. However, not all species are able to
   exploit modified landscapes and may disappear with further loss of
   wooded vegetation. Trait-based approaches provide insight into how
   changes in landscape pattern affect the bee fauna. Failure to adequately
   cater for multiple functional groups of bees across all landscape
   features could mean a substantial loss in species that rely on more
   natural cover, thus affecting ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{The xeric hypothesis is that bees are more abundant pollinators than

   hypothesis is that differences in the proportions will impact plant
   community composition because different pollinators favour different
   floral traits. However, few studies have examined the predictive value
   of these hypotheses. In particular, differences in plant-pollinator
   compositions within biomes, such as the Prairie Ecozone, have not been
   compared. We documented plant-pollinator interactions and plant
   abundance in three Canadian prairie types. Flower visits in moist tall
   grass prairie were mainly by flies in the Syrphidae, whereas visits in
   the drier fescue and mixed grass prairie were mainly by long-tongued
   bees in the Apidae. Short-tongued bee visits were not significantly
   different between the prairie types. Insect visits to tubular,
   zygomorphic, violet/blue-, and white-flowered plants were higher in
   drier fescue and mixed grass prairie than in moister tall grass prairie.
   Further, proportions of plants with these features were lower in the
   tall grass prairie. Thus differences in the proportion of flies and
   long-tongued bees, likely affected by habitat conditions including
   moisture levels, appear to be influencing the types of plants that
   dominate each prairie type, providing some support for these hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of pollen transfer from complimentary pollinizing avocado
   cultivars and pollen deposition onto and within flowers of `Hass'
   avocado trees growing in southern California was examined. Experiments
   were conducted during the flowering seasons of 2001, 2003, 2005, and
   2006. Three commercial `Hass' (an A-type avocado) orchards interplanted
   with complimentary, B-type cultivars were chosen in locations
   representing cool, humid or warm, dry ``Mediterranean{''} conditions.
   Replicate cages were constructed of 40\% saran shade cloth, which
   prevented penetration of bees and other flying insects larger than 2 mm
   to the `Hass' flowers but permitted passage of drifting pollen. They
   were sown to form the rectangular cage roof, walls and floor and
   supported by a pipe framework. Four cages were installed over the
   canopies of `Hass' tree branches at the humid coastal site and at the
   inland, dry sites during February or early March of each year. Enclosure
   was accomplished during floral bud development but before the beginning
   of floral openings. At all locations, each caged and open-pollinated
   partner was staged next to each other with at least two non-observed
   buffer trees between the pair. The conclusions of the work were that
   self-pollination within Stage 2 flowers was the dominant mode of
   pollination at all the humid, coastal and the dry, inland test sites.
   Moreover, it was determined that pollen transfer between cultivars was
   mediated by wind, and bees had a negligible role in pollen transfer
   despite high forage activity. Temperatures that were marginally warm
   enough to allow normal floral opening and closing behavior were still
   insufficient to allow pollen tube growth to the ovule before abscission
   of the flowers. These results provide the basis for understanding why
   growers utilizing solid block avocado plantings in some areas achieve
   good yields without bees.}},

Abstract = {{Obtaining citrus fruits without seeds is a recurrent objective for
   fanners as it is one of the most valued characteristics, especially in
   mandarins. `Afourer' tangor is a highly valuable well-established
   mandarin, and a high percentage of seeded fruits are produced under
   cross-pollination conditions. Several agronomic techniques have been
   suggested to control presence of seeds, such as covering with nets and
   copper sulfate (CuSO4) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) treatments. Natural
   bee repellents are also proposed to reduce the number of seeds per
   fruit. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of several
   agronomic treatments to reduce the seed number in `Afourer' mandarin. To
   this end, we assessed the effect of chemical and bee repellent
   treatments on the seed number per fruit and the side effect on yield and
   fruit diameter. Under these experimental conditions the two bee
   repellents, one based on zinc and one based on Capsicum annuum, were not
   useful for reducing the seed number per fruit in `Afourer' mandarin. The
   copper sulfate + GA(3) treatment reduced the seed number per fruit by
   only 35\%, and this efficiency was clearly not enough to reduce the seed
   number for commercial purposes. The most effective method to reduce the
   seed number per fruit was covering with nets, but this technique led to
   markedly reduced yields. Yield data was highly variable. Fruit diameter
   correlated positively with the seed number, but it was a weak
   relationship as the seed number explained only 15\% of fruit size
   variability (R-2 = 0.15).}},

Abstract = {{The area cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops is increasing
   worldwide, while a shortfall in pollinator availability is a growing
   problem in many agroecosystems. For this reason, many highly
   pollinator-dependent crops are nowadays pollinated artificially by
   humans. Here, we compared the efficiency of artificial and bee
   pollination practices on the mean level and stability of pollination and
   fruit production of kiwifruit. In a kiwifruit orchard, we tagged a total
   of 800 flowers from 40 plants, half were pollinated by honeybees while
   the other half by spraying pollen on flowers, the most commonly
   pollination technique used in kiwifruit. During harvest, we measured
   fruit set, number of seeds per fruit, and fruit weight. On average,
   bee-pollinated plants produced 40\% more fruits than
   artificially-pollinated plants. Also, fruits from bee-pollinated flowers
   contained, on average, 34\% more seeds, showing also 2.8 times less
   variability in number of seeds per fruit than those pollinated
   artificially. Following the same trend, bee-pollinated flowers produce
   fruits that were 34\% heavier and 1.5 times less variable in weight.
   These results showed that bee pollination resulted in higher fruit
   production, and heavier and more homogeneous fruits than artificial
   pollination. According to these results, we encourage growers and land
   managers to use pollination management practices based on honey bees,
   instead of the use of mechanical pollination systems.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{62}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{Bees are important pollinators in agriculture. The bee population has
   recently begun to decline possibly due to pesticides. The bee gut
   microbiota strongly influences the health of bees. The gut microbiota of
   bees is composed of distinct members belonging to selective taxa.
   Chemicals like pesticides can alter the gut microbiota. The present
   study investigated the effect of carbaryl pesticides on gut microbiota
   of honey bees, which had come in contact with rapeseed plants (Brassica
   napus) sprayed with carbaryl wettable powder during the honey bee brood
   test under semi-field condition. Molecular techniques (conventional and
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), clone library method, and
   DNA sequencing) were employed to analyze changes in the microbial
   communities between the pesticide-exposed and unexposed bees.
   Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes of the clones from both groups,
   showed differences in their respective compositions of core and non-core
   bacteria. Both groups contained carbohydrate-degrading bacteria such as
   Gilliamella apicola and Lactobacillus. However, the unexposed bees
   harbored Alphaproteobacteria, which were absent in the exposed bees.
   Microorganisms found in honey bee guts such as Snodgrassella alvi and L.
   kullabergensis, however, were observed only in the exposed bees, but not
   in the unexposed bees. The difference between the two groups was
   distinctly recognized when copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes were compared
   by quantitative PCR. Results showed that the average gene copy number
   for the unexposed bees was higher than that for the exposed bees. This
   may indicate the toxic effect of pesticides on bees and gut microbiota.}},

Title = {{A spatial network analysis of resource partitioning between bumblebees
   foraging on artificial flowers in a flight cage}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Individual bees exhibit complex movement patterns to
   efficiently exploit small areas within larger plant populations. How
   such individual spatial behaviours scale up to the collective level,
   when several foragers visit a common area, has remained challenging to
   investigate, both because of the low resolution of field movement data
   and the limited power of the statistical descriptors to analyse them. To
   tackle these issues we video recorded all flower visits (N = 6205), and
   every interaction on flowers (N = 628), involving foragers from a
   bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colony in a large outdoor flight cage (880
   m(2)), containing ten artificial flowers, collected on five consecutive
   days, and analysed bee movements using networks statistics.
   Results: Bee-flower visitation networks were significantly more modular
   than expected by chance, indicating that foragers minimized overlaps in
   their patterns of flower visits. Resource partitioning emerged from
   differences in foraging experience among bees, and from outcomes of
   their interactions on flowers. Less experienced foragers showed lower
   activity and were more faithful to some flowers, whereas more
   experienced foragers explored the flower array more extensively.
   Furthermore, bees avoided returning to flowers from which they had
   recently been displaced by a nestmate, suggesting that bees integrate
   memories of past interactions into their foraging decisions.
   Conclusion: Our observations, under high levels of competition in a
   flight cage, suggest that the continuous turnover of foragers observed
   in colonies can led to efficient resource partitioning among bees in
   natural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Bee populations are currently undergoing severe global declines driven

   has the potential to exacerbate bee declines, unless steps are taken to
   ensure appropriate floral resources are available. Sown wildflower
   strips are one way in which floral resources can be provided to urban

   metabarcoding of the rbcL gene to compare the foraging patterns of
   different bee species observed using urban sown wildflower strips in
   July 2016, with a goal of identifying which plant species are most
   important for bees. We also demonstrate the use of a non-destructive
   method of pollen collection. Bees were found to forage on a wide variety
   of plant genera and families, including a diverse range of plants from
   outside the wildflower plots, suggesting that foragers visiting sown
   wildflower strips also utilize other urban habitats. Particular plants
   within the wildflower strips dominated metabarcoding data, particularly
   Papaver rhoeas and Phacelia tanacetifolia. Overall, we demonstrate that

Abstract = {{Animal pollination is an important input to the global food system,
   affecting 2/3 of crops and worth more than \$100 billion annually.
   Mounting evidence of pollinators' importance, and of their decline
   worldwide, has prompted efforts to conserve and restore wild bees within
   agricultural regions. To date, however, research on the value of wild
   pollinators has focused largely on crop productivity per se and on
   intensely managed landscapes. Here, we combine field experiments, bee
   observations, and economic methods to estimate the impact of wild
   pollinators on the quantity and quality of blueberry crops within a low
   intensity agricultural landscape in Vermont, USA. Visits by wild bees
   reduced pollination limitation and increased seed set by up to 92\%,
   fruit mass 12\%, and fruit set 12\%. Visitation also increased the
   uniformity of fruit size by up to 11\% and advanced the timing of
   harvest by 2.5 days, both of which can increase crop value. For five out
   of six groups of wild bees, increased visits improved seed set relative
   to hand-pollinated controls. The potential economic value of relieving
   pollen limitation (and therefore improving fruit set and fruit mass)
   varied widely among farms. On most, production could increase 1-6\%
   (representing \$500-\$4000 per year in additional revenue), but the
   maximum increase was 36\% (representing \$137,000 per year). Conserving
   wild pollinator communities, therefore, can increase crop quantity,
   quality, and farm revenue, but some farmers will benefit more than
   others. Farm-specific studies and recommendations are needed to best
   inform local and regional management decisions.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{272}},
Pages = {{199-205}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{The decline of pollination services in some regions has stimulated much
   research on the effects of agricultural intensification on bees. In
   addition to the characteristics of agricultural plots, bee assemblages
   in them are influenced by the adjacent habitats. Perennial,
   fruit-oriented nopal (Opuntia spp.) orchards cover large surfaces in
   Mexico, North Africa, South America and southern U.S.A. and produce tens
   of thousands of flowers, but their value as habitat for bees was
   unknown. To document bee assemblages in nopal orchards in the Llanos de
   Ojuelos, southern Mexican Plateau, and to assess the influence of
   adjacent habitats on them, we surveyed bees in nopal orchards adjacent
   to cropland (Cr-orchards) and adjacent to natural shrubland patches
   (Sh-orchards), and in remnants of natural shrubland. We used color traps
   and manual capture from flowers during the 2016 and 2017 peaks of
   Opuntia blooming periods. We hypothesized that Sh-orchards would harbor
   richer and larger native bee assemblages than Cr-orchards, and that
   assemblages' similarity between these Sh-orchards and shrublands would
   be greater than between Cr-orchards and shrublands. We collected 3823
   individuals of 45 different bee taxa; 90\% of all taxa, in nopal
   orchards. Our results partially support the premise that proximity of
   natural habitats to agricultural plots is positive for their bee overall
   abundance, but distance from shrublands did not impoverish bee species
   richness. Mean similarity values between Cr-orchards, Sh-orchards, and
   shrublands were not significantly different, as result of shrubland
   patches being very variable. As a result of their perennial condition
   and limited agricultural practices, nopal orchards provide shelter,
   forage, and nest substrate for native bee species, albeit perhaps less
   in Cr-orchards than in Sh-orchards, and likely facilitate bee movement
   between orchards and, or shrublands through a matrix of annual
   croplands. In doing so, this agroecosystem enhances regional bee
   community resilience in the context of an anthropized landscape.}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flower colour plays a major role in the attraction
   and decision-making of pollinators. Different functional groups of
   pollinators tend to prefer different flower colours, and therefor may
   lead to different flower colour compositions among different communities
   depending on the visual system of the dominant pollinators. However, few
   studies have investigated the linkage between pollinator fauna and
   flower colour composition in natural communities, a theme we explored in
   the present study.
   Methods Flower spectral reflectance of 106 Japanese and 96 New Zealand
   alpine plants in the wavelength range 300-700 nm were measured. The
   composition of pollinator fauna in the communities and the types of
   pollinators for each plant species were also investigated.
   Key Results Based on bee and fly colour vision models, as well as a
   principal components analysis, considering phylogenetic non-independence
   between plant species, flower colours appeared to vary according to
   pollinator type rather than geographical region. Consequently, flower
   colour composition differed between the regions, reflecting the bee/fly
   mixed pollinator fauna of Japan and the fly-dominant pollinator fauna of
   New Zealand. According to the bee colour vision model, the majority of
   the colours of hymenopteran-pollinated flowers appeared to be
   discriminated by bees. In contrast, many of the colours of
   dipteran-pollinated flowers would not be discriminated by bees and
   flies.
   Conclusion The results suggest that the differences in flower colour
   composition between Japanese and New Zealand alpine communities are due
   to differences in the pollinator fauna in these communities rather than
   differences in abiotic factors between the geographical regions and the
   phylogenetic origin of the communities.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the widespread use of pesticides and their persistence in the
   environment, non-target organisms are chronically exposed to mixtures of
   toxic residues. Fungicides, herbicides and insecticides are all found at
   low doses in the diet of pollinators such as honey bees, but due to the
   lack of data on the toxicological effects of these mixtures, determining
   their risk is difficult to assess. We therefore developed a study
   combining the identification of common pollen-bound pesticide mixtures
   associated with poor colony development and tested their effects on bee
   behavior and physiology. We exposed bees to the identified pesticide
   mixtures during the first days of their adult life, a crucial period for
   physiological development. Using optic bee counters we recorded the
   behavior of bees throughout their lives and identified two pesticide
   mixtures that delay the onset of foraging and slow-down foraging
   activity. Further-more, one of these mixtures hampers pollen foraging.
   As bee longevity is strongly influenced by the time spent foraging, bees
   exposed to these pesticide mixtures outlived control bees. Physiological
   analysis revealed that perturbations of the energetic metabolism
   preceded the altered behavior. In conclusion, we found that early-life
   exposure to low doses of pesticide mixtures can have long-term effects
   that translate into longer-lived but slower and less efficient bees.
   These surprising findings contrast with the commonly reported increase
   in bee mortality upon pesticide exposure, and demonstrate that exposure
   that may seem harmless (e.g., very low doses, pesticides not intended to
   kill insects) can have undesirable effects on non-target organisms. (C)

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has contributed to declines in wild bee
   populations at local and regional scales. The Northern Great Plains is a
   key region for small grain, forage, pulse, and oilseed production, yet
   the impact of available floral resources on colony success of eusocial
   bees is unknown. To assess the effects of farming system on bee colony
   success (relative growth rate and fecundity) and worker condition (lipid
   content and wing wear), we placed 60 mini-colonies of Bombus impatiens
   in six conventional and six organic spring wheat fields near Big Sandy,
   Montana, USA over two growing seasons. Consistent with our expectations,
   we found that flower density and forb richness were positively
   associated with colony relative growth rate and fecundity. Similarly,
   flower density, forb richness, and the relative growth rate and
   fecundity of B. impatiens colonies were greater in organic fields when
   compared to conventional fields. Workers from organic fields had lower
   mean wing wear and marginally greater average body lipid content.
   However, there were no differences in the number of reproductives
   (queens, workers, and males) between two systems. Lastly, though the
   overall composition of colony-collected pollen was not different across
   the farming systems, colony-collected pollen species richness was
   greater in organic fields in one of the two sampled growing seasons. We
   conclude that by increasing B. impatiens colony success and individual
   worker condition, the greater floral resources observed in organic
   systems can contribute to better biodiversity-based indirect ecosystem
   services in the highly simplified agricultural landscapes that dominates
   the Northern Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{Limited resources and land-use pressures require more efficient
   conservation strategies, from increasingly limited input. Pollinator
   declines are threatening food security and natural capital. I present a
   novel perspective on landscape level pollinator conservation from across
   multiple scientific fields. I examine the value of landscape structure
   provided by trees and hedgerows compared with floral strips, and discuss
   use of computer simulation technologies for understanding how spatial
   structure impacts pollinators' ability to forage.
   All bees forage on a mixture of both flowering plants and tree species.
   Honeybees have a detectable preference for foraging on trees, even when
   sparse. The spatial information provided by trees and hedgerows
   positively impacts formation of the ``cognitive map{''}, making
   pollination and foraging more efficient. Woody habitat features like
   trees and hedgerows provide more efficient resources for pollinators in
   a number of ways. They are more efficient forage targets due to absolute
   resource density; tree and hedgerow planting could provide more
   optimised foraging landscapes for pollinators. Using computer simulation
   may enable us to study pollinator responses to landscape development at
   this scale. Woodland development results in non-pollinator ecosystem
   services, representing a more cost-effective conservation strategy.

Abstract = {{The populations of most pollinators, including honeybees, are declining
   that heavily affects both crop and wild plant pollination. Wild bee
   diversity and habitat type may modulate these effects. We addressed the
   question how the structure of plant-pollinator networks in different
   habitat types may influence the vulnerability of pollinator communities
   to the hypothetical loss of honeybees. We performed network analysis
   based on plant-visitation data in a traditional agricultural landscape
   and quantified the structural vulnerability (i.e. the effect of the loss
   of honeybee) of the plant-pollinator networks by a topological index
   (distance-based fragmentation). We found that very different
   plant-pollinator communities inhabited the studied different
   agricultural habitat types. The early summer arable fields had the most,
   pastures in mid-summer had the less vulnerable structure and, in
   general, an intermediate plant/pollinator ratio was associated with high
   vulnerability in the absence of honeybees. We suggest that increased
   plant species richness can ensure higher wild bee diversity and more
   stable plant-pollinator networks without honeybee, where
   flower-visitation can rely more on wild bees. Decreased management
   intensity in agricultural landscapes can therefore contribute to the
   maintenance of diverse plant-pollinator communities in agricultural
   landscapes and to sustainable farming.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular methods have greatly increased our understanding of the
   previously cryptic spatial ecology of bumble bees (Bombus spp.), with
   knowledge of the spatial ecology of these bees being central to
   conserving their essential pollination services. Bombus hypnorum, the
   Tree Bumble Bee, is unusual in that it has recently rapidly expanded its
   range, having colonized much of the UK mainland since 2001. However, the
   spatial ecology of B.hypnorum has not previously been investigated. To
   address this issue, and to investigate whether specific features of the
   spatial ecology of B.hypnorum are associated with its rapid range
   expansion, we used 14 microsatellite markers to estimate worker foraging
   distance, nest density, between-year lineage survival rate and isolation
   by distance in a representative UK B.hypnorum population. After
   assigning workers to colonies based on full or half sibship, we
   estimated the mean colony-specific worker foraging distance as 103.6m,
   considerably less than values reported from most other bumble bee
   populations. Estimated nest density was notably high (2.56 and 0.72
   colonies ha(-1) in 2014 and 2015, respectively), estimated between-year
   lineage survival rate was 0.07, and there was no evidence of fine-scale
   isolation by distance. In addition, genotyping stored sperm dissected
   from sampled queens confirmed polyandry in this population (mean minimum
   mating frequency of 1.7 males per queen). Overall, our findings
   establish critical spatial ecological parameters and the mating system
   of this unusual bumble bee population and suggest that short worker
   foraging distances and high nest densities are associated with its rapid
   range expansion.}},

Abstract = {{AimBumble bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Bombus) are economically and
   ecologically important pollinators in agroecosystems and wildland
   habitats. In the Nearctic region, there are approximately 41 species, of
   which the IUCN lists twelve species as vulnerable, endangered, or
   critically endangered. We conducted a standardized faunal survey to
   inform ongoing conservation efforts including petitions under review for
   the Endangered Species Act. Furthermore, we test the appropriateness of
   a methodology for accurately sampling bumble bee communities.
   LocationThe United States of America, including 31 sites in 15 states.
   MethodsWe surveyed 15 states in the summer of 2015 to assess community
   composition and relative species abundance at agricultural and
   seminatural sites throughout the United States. We collected
   approximately 100 bees, using aerial nets, from each of 31 sites and
   identified specimens to species, totaling 3,252 bees. We assessed our
   survey methodology to understand whether it accurately sampled the
   potential community of bumble bees at each site for utility in future
   monitoring efforts.
   ResultsAverage site species richness was 5.12.05, and we detected 30 of
   the 41 species documented historically within the contiguous United
   States. Sampling a site beyond 100 bees rarely added additional species
   detections, whereas adding additional sampling sites within an ecoregion
   frequently increased the species richness for the ecoregion. Thirteen of
   the 30 species we detected each accounted for <1\% of the total fauna,
   and two species accounted for 49.02\% of all bees captured. Species
   richness and evenness increased with increasing latitude across
   communities.
   Main ConclusionsSpecies diversity and evenness in bumble bees increases
   in northern latitudes and increasing elevation in the United States;
   however, a few common species tend to dominate communities while many
   species occur only in low numbers. The results of this survey effort can
   inform current conservation evaluations and planning.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is an integral functional trait that underlies
   pollination-related ecological processes, yet it is often impractical to
   measure directly. Allometric scaling laws have been used to overcome
   this problem. However, most existing models rely upon small sample
   sizes, geographically restricted sampling and have limited applicability
   for non-bee taxa. Allometric models that consider biogeography,
   phylogenetic relatedness, and intraspecific variation are urgently
   required to ensure greater accuracy. We measured body size as dry weight
   and intertegular distance (ITD) of 391 bee species (4,035 specimens) and
   103 hoverfly species (399 specimens) across four biogeographic regions:
   Australia, Europe, North America, and South America. We updated existing
   models within a Bayesian mixed-model framework to test the power of ITD
   to predict interspecific variation in pollinator dry weight in
   interaction with different co-variates: phylogeny or taxonomy, sexual
   dimorphism, and biogeographic region. In addition, we used ordinary
   least squares regression to assess intraspecific dry weight ITD
   relationships for ten bees and five hoverfly species. Including
   co-variates led to more robust interspecific body size predictions for
   both bees and hoverflies relative to models with the ITD alone. In
   contrast, at the intraspecific level, our results demonstrate that the
   ITD is an inconsistent predictor of body size for bees and hoverflies.
   The use of allometric scaling laws to estimate body size is more
   suitable for interspecific comparative analyses than assessing
   intraspecific variation. Collectively, these models form the basis of
   the dynamic R package, pollimetry, which provides a comprehensive
   resource for allometric pollination research worldwide.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To monitor and quantify the changes in pollinator communities over time,
   it is important to have robust survey techniques of insect populations.
   Pan traps allow for the assessment of the relative insect abundance in
   an environment and have been promoted by the Food and Agricultural
   Organization (FAO) as an efficient data collection methodology. It has
   been proposed that fluorescent pan traps are particularly useful, as it
   has been suggested that they capture high numbers of insects in an
   unbiased fashion. We use a simultaneous presentation of fluorescent and
   non-fluorescent pan trap colours to assess how flower-visiting insects
   of different orders respond to visual stimuli and reveal a significant
   interaction between trap fluorescence and captured insect type. In
   particular, Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths)
   were captured significantly more frequently by fluorescent traps, whilst
   Dipterans (flies) were captured significantly less frequently by this
   type of pan trap. Hymenopterans (bees and wasps) showed no significant
   difference in their preference for fluorescent or non-fluorescent traps.
   Our results reveal that the use of fluorescent pan traps may differently
   bias insect capture rates when compared to the typical experience of
   colour flower-visiting insects in natural environments. Correction
   factors may, therefore, be required for interpreting insect pan trap
   data collected with different methodologies.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus) play key roles as pollinators in temperate
   ecosystems. Some North American species have declined due to factors
   that include habitat loss, parasites, pesticides, and climate change. In
   many regions conservation is hampered by lack of quantitative data on
   historical abundance and distribution, making status assessments
   difficult. From 2012 to 2014, with help from 53 citizen scientists, we
   conducted surveys to determine the status of bumble bees throughout
   Vermont, USA. For historical comparison, we identified and digitized
   bumble bee specimens from 13 public and private collections. Our dataset
   contained 12,319 records, which we separated into historic (1915-1999;
   n=1669) and modern (2000-2014; n=10,650) periods, with our survey
   contributing 94\% of modern data. Of 17 species, four were not detected
   and four showed significant declines. Rarefaction indicated that both
   modern and historic datasets slightly underestimated known species
   richness, diversity, and abundance, but confirmed a strong decline for
   all three parameters. Declining species broadly accorded with those
   reported elsewhere in eastern North America, and included those in
   subgenera Bombus, Fervidobombus, and Psithyrus. Four species in the
   subgenus Pyrobombus (B. bimaculatus, B. impatiens, B. ternarius, and B.
   vagans) greatly increased in relative abundance in the modern period.
   Landscape factors such as road density, elevation, and land use strongly
   predicted distribution of some species. Species diversity was correlated

Abstract = {{A worldwide decline of many bee species has been reported, but
   conversely some species seems to be in expansion. Nonetheless species
   truly in expansion may be overestimated, especially when they are

   lacking. The objective of this study was to test whether the bumblebee
   species Bombus morio and B. pauloensis will be safe under future climate
   changes. Specifically, test if these bees will suffer geographic decline
   or expansion; test whether each phylogeographic lineage within B.
   pauloensis will respond differently in modeling of future geographic
   distribution given climate change; find stable areas holding high
   genetic diversity based on predicted future climatic changes; and test
   whether these areas are covered by existing protected areas. To reach
   the objectives we performed analyses using phylogeographic data already
   available and climate change information to model the demography of the
   panmictic B. morio and the phylogeographic lineages in B. pauloensis.
   Our results suggest that both species will suffer a reduction in
   suitable area and that the reduction in distribution is masked for B.
   pauloensis. When each clade was separately analyzed, the ones in the
   edge of the species distribution are the most likely to decline. We
   found a large future refuge in eastern state of SAo Paulo and state of
   Rio de Janeiro for B. morio and for the clades of B. pauloensis. This
   refuge seems to show high levels of species richness and endemism for

   only the pattern of biodiversity but also the processes that generate

   semi-natural habitats impacting several important ecosystem services.
   One group of organisms that has suffered greatly are the bees and hence
   pollination, the supporting ecosystem service they complete. The United
   States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program
   (CRP) has implemented conservation practices designed to improve habitat
   for pollinators in agroecosystems by paying to recover environmentally
   sensitive agricultural land from production, and restoring them by
   planting native grass mixes, pollinator-friendly legumes and
   wildflowers. Our study, aimed at demonstrating the efficacy of this
   practice, measured diversity and abundance of wild bee genera in the
   agricultural landscape of eastern semiarid regions of Colorado, USA,
   where CRP practices were implemented. Over our 3-year study, we obtained
   a total of 16,207 bees belonging to 51 genera. We found inconsistent
   differences in number of bee genera and abundance of bees in CRP fields
   supplemented with wildflowers compared to those with conventional grass
   seed mix. However, we observed only a 40-80\% overlap in bee genera
   between fields supplemented with wildflowers and those with grass seed
   mixes indicating that diversity was enhanced by having both habitats.
   With the caveat that 3years is a very short period to see appreciable
   changes, our results suggest that recovering environmentally sensitive
   land can strengthen pollinator populations in landscapes dominated by
   agricultural activities. In addition, periodic evaluation and
   maintenance of these recovered lands will further support the efforts
   towards revitalization of ecosystem services in these areas.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of pesticides on the health of bee pollinators is determined
   in part by the capacity of bee detoxification systems to convert these
   compounds to less toxic forms. For example, recent work has shown that
   cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily are critically important in
   defining the sensitivity of honey bees and bumblebees to pesticides,
   including neonicotinoid insecticides. However, it is currently unclear
   if solitary bees have functional equivalents of these enzymes with
   potentially serious implications in relation to their capacity to
   metabolise certain insecticides. To address this question, we sequenced
   the genome of the red mason bee, Osmia bicornis, the most abundant and
   economically important solitary bee species in Central Europe. We show
   that O. bicornis lacks the CYP9Q subfamily of P450s but, despite this,
   exhibits low acute toxicity to the N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoid
   thiacloprid. Functional studies revealed that variation in the
   sensitivity of O. bicornis to N-cyanoamidine and N-nitroguanidine
   neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor or speed of cuticular penetration.
   Rather, a P450 within the CYP9BU subfamily, with recent shared ancestry
   to the Apidae CYP9Q subfamily, metabolises thiacloprid in vitro and
   confers tolerance in vivo. Our data reveal conserved detoxification
   pathways in model solitary and eusocial bees despite key differences in
   the evolution of specific pesticide-metabolising enzymes in the two
   species groups. The discovery that P450 enzymes of solitary bees can act
   as metabolic defence systems against certain pesticides can be leveraged
   to avoid negative pesticide impacts on these important pollinators.
   Author summary Bees have evolved sophisticated metabolic systems to
   detoxify the natural toxins encountered in their environment. Recent
   work has shown that specific enzymes (cytochrome P450s) in these
   biotransformation pathways can be recruited to protect honey bees and
   bumblebees against certain synthetic insecticides, including some
   neonicotinoids. However, it is unclear if solitary bees that carry out
   important pollination services have equivalent enzymes that play a key
   role in defining their sensitivity to insecticides. In this study we
   show that the genome of the solitary bee, Osmia bicornis, lacks the
   subfamily of cytochrome P450 enzymes that break down certain
   neonicotinoids in eusocial bees. Despite this, O. bicornis exhibits
   marked tolerance to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid as a result of
   efficient metabolism by a P450 enzyme from an alternative subfamily. The
   discovery that O. bicornis has key detoxification enzymes that determine
   its sensitivity to neonicotinoids can be leveraged to safeguard the
   health of this important pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{The fates of native bee communities in the Great Basin sagebrush steppe
   are linked with the susceptibilities of their floral hosts to
   increasingly frequent wildfires. Postfire survival and subsequent
   flowering of six prevalent perennial wildflowers representing five
   families were quantified across a range of realistic fire severities
   created using a calibrated propane burn barrel. Five burn prescriptions
   of varying intensity and duration were applied to cultivated rows of
   basalt milkvetch (Astrugalusfilipes Torr. ex A. Gray), Blue Mountain
   prairie clover (Daleaomuto Eaton \& J. Wright). sulphur-flower buckwheat
   (Eriogonum umbellatum Torr.), fernleaf biscuitroot (Lomatium dissectum
   Nutt.), blue penstemon (Penstemon cyaneus Pennell), and gooseberryleaf
   globemallow (Sphaerakea grossularifolia Hook. \& Am.). Overall
   differences in their fire sensitivities were maximal at peak fire
   severity, ranging from 80\% survival (L dissectum) to complete mortality
   (E umbellatum and P. cyaneus). Although A. filipes survived well (85\%),
   half of the 95 burn survivors then failed to flower the year after
   burning. The postfire fate of plant-pollinator interactions is a
   function of the bees' nesting habits, their floral host's sensitivity to
   a given burn intensity (both in terms of survival and flowering), and
   the reproductive interdependence of bee and floral host (taxonomic
   specialists vs. generalists). (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {{During buzz pollination, bees use their indirect flight muscles to
   produce vibrations that are transmitted to the flowers and result in
   pollen release. Although buzz pollination has been known for >100 years,
   we are still in the early stages of understanding how bee and floral
   characteristics affect the production and transmission of floral
   vibrations. Here, we analysed floral vibrations produced by four closely
   related bumblebee taxa (Bombus spp.) on two buzz-pollinated plants
   species (Solanum spp.). We measured floral vibrations transmitted to the
   flower to establish the extent to which the mechanical properties of
   floral vibrations depend on bee and plant characteristics. By comparing
   four bee taxa visiting the same plant species, we found that peak
   acceleration, root mean-squared acceleration (RMS) and frequency vary
   between bee taxa, but that neither bee size (intertegular distance) nor
   flower biomass (dry mass) affects peak acceleration, RMS or frequency. A
   comparison of floral vibrations of two bee taxa visiting flowers of two
   plant species showed that, while bee species affects peak acceleration,
   RMS and frequency, plant species only affects acceleration ( peak
   acceleration and RMS), not frequency. When accounting for differences in
   the transmission of vibrations across the two types of flower, using a
   species-specific `coupling factor', we found that RMS acceleration and
   peak displacement do not differ between plant species. This suggests
   that bees produce the same initial acceleration in different plants but
   that transmission of these vibrations through the flower is affected by
   floral characteristics.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Most crops grown in Europe, including sunflower (Helianthus annulus L.),
   benefit from insect pollination. However, valuing this benefit is not
   straightforward since estimates of the increase in sunflower yield vary
   from 18\% to 100\%. Most estimates have, moreover, been performed at
   plant scale, a scale that is not relevant for farmers who calculate at
   the field scale. In this four-year study, we quantified the contribution
   of insect pollination to sunflower yield at field and plant scales in
   working farm fields distributed along a gradient of pollinator diversity
   and abundance. Pollinators were found to increase field yield up to 40\%
   (i.e. 0.7 t/ha) and by 31.3\% at plant scale; the magnitude of effect on
   yield being therefore similar at both scales. The pollinators increased
   the yield by increasing the number of fertilized seeds per plant with no
   significant effect on the unit mass of the seeds although there was a
   trade-off between number of seeds and unit mass. Among pollinators,
   honeybees were the main taxon impacting sunflower yield. Sunflower plant
   density was a strong determinant of yield, with higher numbers
   attracting increased numbers of honeybees. Using pollinator and wind
   exclusion, we finally quantified the relative contributions of
   self-pollination (similar to 40\%), insect pollination (similar to 35\%)
   and wind pollination (similar to 20\%). Our results show, to the best of
   our knowledge, the first evidence of the key role of pollinators in
   sunflower production at field scale in real farming conditions, and
   underscore the need to maintain suitable conditions for pollinators in

   and guild}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{95-107}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Large areas of Western Europe are covered with intensively managed
   agricultural land. In these landscapes, wild pollinators depend on
   fragments of semi-natural habitat for foraging or reproduction. Small
   forest patches are often the most abundant type of semi-natural habitat
   in these agricultural landscapes. We investigated the role these patches
   play in conserving the pollinator community in intensively managed
   agricultural landscapes.
   Our survey of the pollinator community in 16 forest fragments showed
   that the pollinator community in the edges of small forest fragments is
   strongly influenced by forest and forest edge characteristics. Old
   forest fragments with a well-developed herb layer had more diverse bee
   communities than recent forests or old forests without a herb layer, but
   overall lower activity-abundances, while sun exposure of the forest
   edges had a strong positive effect on pollinator activity-abundance in
   general. The hoverfly community had higher activity-abundances in forest
   edges with a higher flower-index, while saproxylic hoverflies were
   caught in higher numbers in sites with a higher forest cover in the
   surrounding landscape.
   We also detected a strong seasonal effect. The effects of herb layer
   cover on bee species richness and activity-abundance were much stronger
   in spring than in summer, while bee species richness was also strongly
   positively correlated with forest age in spring. A strong positive
   correlation between pollinator species richness and sun exposure was
   found in summer, after canopy closure.
   While the sampled forest edges harbour a rich and diverse pollinator
   community, cavity-nesting bees were very scarce. This is probably caused
   by the low amount of dead wood in the studied forest fragments.
   We conclude that small forest fragments can play an important role in
   conserving the pollinator community, especially bees and saproxylic
   hoverflies. The importance of these forest fragments is strongest in
   spring, when the herb layer provides foraging resources. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{We explored the pollen foraging behaviour of honey bee colonies situated

   month-long period using both pollen metabarcoding and waggle dance
   inference of spatial foraging patterns. For molecular pollen analysis,
   we developed simple and cost-effective laboratory and bioinformatics
   methods. Targeting four plant barcode loci (ITS2, rbcL, trnL and trnH),

   protocols designed to minimize amplification biases and index mistagging
   events. We constructed comprehensive, curated reference databases for

   these databases to train the metaxa2 DNA sequence classifier.
   Comparisons between morphological and molecular palynology provide
   strong support for the quantitative potential of multi-locus

   locations and show clear trends in the phenological progression of honey
   bee spring foraging in these agricultural areas. Our data suggest that
   three key taxa, woody Rosaceae such as pome fruits and hawthorns, Salix,

Abstract = {{Floral odours play an important role in attracting insect pollinators.
   Because pollinators visit flowers to obtain pollen and nectar rewards,
   they should prefer floral odour profiles associated with the
   highest-rewarding flowers (honest signals). In previous work, bumblebees
   exhibited a preference for flowers from outbred over inbred Mimulus
   guttatus plants. Pollen is the only floral reward in M. guttatus, and
   pollen viability (a reliable indicator of protein content) is reduced in
   inbred plants. Yet, differences in pollen viability did not explain the
   observed preferences. In this study, we examined the floral volatile
   profiles of inbred and outbred M. guttatus to identify inbreeding
   effects and associations between volatile compounds and the number of
   viable pollen grains per flower, designated PRQ (pollen reward quality).
   We also conducted pairwise choice tests with Bombus impatiens to
   evaluate the ability of bees to discriminate between odours of rewarding
   and non-rewarding flowers and to determine whether bumblebee preferences
   are explained by differences in the floral odours of inbred and outbred
   plants. Inbred plants exhibited reduced emission of -trans-bergamotene,
   the second-most abundant compound in the volatile blend of outbred
   plants. Furthermore, pollen and fertile anthers emitted nonadecane. Six
   other compounds in the floral blend were positively correlated with PRQ.
   There was no overlap between compounds affected by inbreeding and
   compounds associated with PRQ. Even when given prior experience foraging
   on M. guttatus, bumblebees did not distinguish between the floral odours
   of rewarding and non-rewarding outbred plants. However, they preferred
   floral odours from non-rewarding outbred plants over rewarding inbred
   plants. Bumblebees without prior experience of flowers preferred
   volatile blends with higher versus lower amounts of -trans-bergamotene.
   Taken together, these results suggest that the volatile emissions of M.
   guttatus provide reliable indicators of pollen rewards (potential honest
   signals), but that the preference of bumblebees for outbred plants is
   not driven by these cues but rather by a sensory bias for
   -trans-bergamotene. This may represent a subtle form of
   deceit-pollination that allows plants to attract pollinators while
   minimizing investment in costly rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is a biennial plant with
   strong self-incompatibility and an obligate requirement for prolonged
   vernalization by exposure to low temperatures to induce flowering. These
   characteristics significantly increase the difficulty of exploiting
   novel germplasm induced by physical or chemical mutagens. In this study,
   we report a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system based on endogenous tRNA
   processing to induce high efficiency and inheritable mutagenesis in
   cabbage. Using the phytoene desaturase gene BoPDS, the S-receptor kinase
   gene BoSRK, and the male-sterility-associated gene BoMS1 as the target
   genes, multisite and multiple gene mutations were achieved using a
   construct with tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture to express
   multiple sgRNAs. The BoSRK3 gene mutation suppressed
   self-incompatibility completely, converting the self-incompatible line
   into a self-compatible line. In addition, the BoMS1 gene mutation
   produced a completely male-sterile mutant, which was highly cross
   compatible with its nonmutant isoline at the flowering stage as a result
   of a simultaneous BoSRK3 gene mutation, enabling the economic
   propagation of the male-sterile line through bee-mediated
   cross-pollination. Interestingly, higher site mutation efficiency was
   detected when a guide sequence was inserted into a location in the
   tandemly arrayed tRNA-sgRNA architecture that was distal from the
   upstream Pol III promoter. In addition, mutation sites were also
   detected in the paralogous genes of the BoPDS and BoSRK genes that had
   fully consistent sequences or base mismatches but beyond the ``seed{''}
   region in the spacer sequence compared with the target sgRNAs.
   Collectively, our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system,
   coupled with an endogenous tRNA-processing system, is an efficient tool
   to improve cabbage traits.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Current notions of ``pollinator decline{''} and ``pollination crisis{''}
   mainly arose from studies on pollinators of economic value in
   anthropogenic ecosystems of mid-latitude temperate regions.
   Comprehensive long-term pollinator data from biologically diverse,
   undisturbed communities are needed to evaluate the actual extent of the
   so-called ``global pollination crisis.{''} This paper analyzes the
   long-term dynamics of pollinator abundance in undisturbed Mediterranean
   montane habitats using pollinator visitation data for 65 plant species
   collected over two decades. Objectives are (1) to elucidate patterns of
   long-term changes in pollinator abundance from the perspectives of
   individual plant species, major pollinator groups, and the whole plant
   community and (2) to propose a novel methodological implementation based
   on combining a planned missing data design with the analytical strength
   of mixed effects models, which allows one to draw community-wide
   inferences on long-term pollinator trends in species-rich natural
   habitats. Probabilistic measurements ({''}patch visitation
   probability{''} and ``flower visitation probability{''} per time unit)
   were used to assess pollinator functional abundance for each plant
   species on two separate, randomly chosen years. A total of 13,054
   pollinator censuses accounting for a total watching effort of 2,877,039
   flower-min were carried out on 299 different dates. Supra-annual
   unstability in pollinator functional abundance was the rule, with
   visitation probability to flowering patches and/or individual flowers
   exhibiting significant heterogeneity between years in the majority of
   plant species (83\%). At the plant-community level, there was a
   significant linear increase in pollinator functional abundance over the
   study period. Probability of pollinator visitation to flowering patches
   and individual flowers increased due to increasing visitation by small
   solitary bees and, to a lesser extent, small beetles. Visitation to
   different plant species exhibited contrasting changes, and insect orders
   and genera differed widely in sign and magnitude of linear abundance
   trends, thus exemplifying the complex dynamics of community-wide changes
   in pollinator functional abundance. Results of this investigation
   indicate that pollinator declines are not universal beyond anthropogenic
   ecosystems; stress the need for considering broader ecological scenarios
   and comprehensive samples of plants and pollinators; and illustrate the
   crucial importance of combining ambitious sampling designs with powerful

Abstract = {{The risk of ecosystem function degradation with biodiversity loss has
   emerged as a major scientific concern in recent years. Possible
   relationships between taxonomic diversity and magnitude and stability of
   ecosystem processes build upon species' functional characteristics,
   which determine both susceptibility to environmental change and
   contribution to ecosystem properties. The functional diversity within
   communities thus provides a potential buffer against environmental
   disturbance, especially for properties emerging from interactions among
   species. In complex plant-pollinator networks, distantly related taxa
   spanning a great trait diversity shape network architecture. Here, we
   address the question of whether network properties are maintained after
   habitat loss by complementary contributions of phylogenetically distant
   pollinator taxa. We quantified contributions of wild bees and hoverflies
   to network structure (connectance, network specialization,
   specialization asymmetry) in 32 calcareous grassland fragments varying
   in size. Although hoverflies are often regarded less susceptible to
   environmental change than wild bees, species richness of both taxa was
   similarly affected by habitat loss. The associated loss of 80\% of
   interactions resulted in small and tightly connected networks, which was
   more strongly attributed to wild bee loss than hoverfly loss. Networks
   in small fragments were less specialized due to equivalent losses of
   species and interactions in both pollinators and plants. Because wild
   bee and hoverfly loss contributed similarly to declining network
   specialization, we conclude that trait diversity among distantly related
   pollinators does not necessarily provide insurance against functional
   homogenization during community disassembly following habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are important pollinators for a wide range of crops and wild
   plants. Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as
   food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural
   landscapes. It is well-known that semi-natural habitats can enhance
   floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different
   crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains
   unclear. We tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape
   {[}OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and
   compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of
   buff-tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen
   diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany. We
   found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen
   diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management
   resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated
   into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity
   gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity. In contrast,
   OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did
   neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the
   timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high
   flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed
   increased growth rates. Synthesis and applications. Our results
   complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen
   diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions.
   Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural
   landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their
   nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under
   the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to
   this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass-flowering crops
   turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources,
   while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee
   colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and
   strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially
   towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to
   support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator diversity and abundance are declining in the agricultural
   landscapes of some parts of the world along with the pollination
   services they provide. Among an array of reasons, climate change has
   been pointed out as a major player and studies suggest strong negative
   impacts on agricultural pollination toward the end of the 21st century.
   In this study, we investigated for the first time the concomitant effect
   of climate changes on a tropical crop, passion fruit (Passiflora
   edulis), and its two main pollinator bee species (Xylocopa frontalis and
   X. grisescens) in the Neotropics considering two of the IPCC
   environmental scenarios, RCP 4.5; RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration
   Pathways), and in the years 2060 and 2080. We have shown that the
   climate changes may lead to changes in the natural ranges of Xylocopa
   bees, with considerable loss of habitable area (X. frontalis, RCP 4.5 =
   -27.3 to -15.4\%; RCP 8.5 = -57.7 to -47.9\%; X grisescens, RCP 4.5 =
   -15.4 to -27.81\%; RCP 8.5 = -23.5 to -35.3\%), as well as for cropping
   passion fruit (RCP 4.5 = -44. 9 to -51.3\%; RCP 8.5 = -42.9 to -64.8\%),
   for years 2060 and 2080, respectively. We also predicted a potential
   reduction between 31.9\% and 54.9\% in the overlapping of the remaining
   suitable areas for the bees and passion fruit, increasing the potential
   spatial mismatch between the crop and its pollinators. Based on the
   models forecast of climate changes, we conclude that the suitable areas
   to co-occurrence of passion fruit crop and its effective pollinators
   will be largely affected in the Neotropics and steps to mitigate the
   effects of the climate changes should be taken to ensure viable
   population of pollinators in the remaining suitable areas for both bees

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key component in agricultural food production and
   ecosystem maintenance, with plant-pollinator interactions an important
   research theme in ecological and evolutionary studies. Natural history
   collections provide unique access to samples collected at different
   spatial and temporal scales. Identification of the plant origins of
   pollen trapped on the bodies of pollinators in these collections
   provides insight into historic plant communities and pollinators'
   preferred floral taxa. In this study, pollen was sampled from Megachile
   venusta Smith bees from the National Collection of Insects, South
   Africa, spanning 93 years. Three barcode regions, the internal
   transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and ribulose-1,5-biphosphate
   carboxylase (rbcL), were sequenced from mixed pollen samples using a
   next-generation sequencing approach (MiSeq, Illumina). Sequenced reads
   were compared to sequence reference databases that were generated by
   extracting sequence and taxonomic data from GenBank. ITS1 and ITS2 were
   amplified successfully across all (or most) samples, while rbcL
   performed inconsistently. Age of sample had no impact on sequencing
   success. Plant classification was more informative using ITS2 than ITS1
   barcode data. This study also highlights the need for comprehensive
   reference databases as limited local plant sequence representation in
   reference databases resulted in higher-level taxon classifications being
   more confidently interpreted. The results showed that small,
   insect-carried pollen samples from historic bee specimens collected from
   as early as 1914 can be used to obtain pollen metabarcodes. DNA
   metabarcoding of mixed origin pollen samples provided a faster, more
   accurate method of determining pollen provenance, without the need for
   expert palynologists. The use of historic collections to sample pollen
   directly from pollinators provided additional value to these
   collections. Sampling pollen from historic collections can potentially
   provide the spatial and temporal scales for investigations into changes
   in plant community structure or pollinator floral choice in the face of
   global climate change.}},

   Epifluorescence showed that most germinating grains failed to penetrate
   the stigmatic surface >24h after hand self-pollination suggesting
   early-acting self-incompatibility (SI). The majority of pollinators of
   H. hirsuta were female bees representing 21 species distributed in four
   families. Pollen load analyses indicated that most bees were polylectic
   and carried grains of H. hirsuta mixed with pollen of co-blooming,
   nectariferous species. In contrast, capsule production of H. aurea was
   60\% for open, insect-pollinated flowers. Pollen tubes of H. aurea also
   entered ovules within 24h, and SI of this species was partial. Evidence
   of a late-acting rejection in this species following self-pollination
   included abnormal growth of pollen tubes in styles with fewer tubes
   penetrating ovules. In contrast, abnormal tube growth was not observed
   in styles ofH. hirsuta. Hypoxis aurea received fewer insect visitations.
   Pollen was dispersed primarily by hoverflies (Syrphidae) followed by

Volume = {{131}},

Abstract = {{The Crassulaceae is an important family in the Greater Cape Floristic
   Region of southern Africa and is the seventh largest family in the arid
   Succulent Karoo Biome. After the Aizoaceae it is the largest group of
   leaf-succulents in southern Africa.
   This is the first investigation of a broad selection (68\%) of the +/-
   170 species of Crassula. We used data from three chloroplast and two
   nuclear gene-regions, which yielded many informative characters and
   provided good resolution among the species.
   We show that only five of the 20 sections in Crassula are monophyletic.
   However, the clades recovered show close correlation with the two
   subgenera that were once recognized. Crassula contains more than 25
   succulent annual species which are not closely related to each other but
   form early-diverging branches in each of the three major clades. One of
   these major clades contains far more perennial species than the others
   and is the greatest diversification within Crassula. This
   diversification mostly arose within the last 10 million years (my) and
   spread across much of southern Africa. Members of the smaller two major
   clades are often soft- and flat-leaved perennials (many with basic
   chromosome number x=8, with high levels of polyploidy). Those in the
   largest diversification (where a basic chromosome number of x=7
   predominates) show other arid-adaptations (more highly succulent leaves
   with a dense covering of hairs or papillae or a smooth xeromorphic
   epidermis). Their flowers are also more variable in shape and bee-,moth-
   and butterfly-pollinated species are known among them.
   We establish that Crassula arose in the Greater Cape Floristic Region of
   southern Africa. While much of its diversity has evolved in the last 10
   my, Crassula nevertheless contains species that are much older and
   itself arose +/- 46 my ago. Since all its species are succulent it is
   possible that they are part of an early arid-adapted flora that
   contributed to the Succulent Karoo Biome in the western part of southern
   Africa. Consequently this Biome may not be assembled only from `young
   lineages' as is usually thought to be the case.}},

Abstract = {{Oceanic island ecosystems harbour many endemic plant and animal species,
   which are often threatened because they have only a few small
   populations. Many factors contribute to the biological viability of such
   populations, such as demography and population dynamics, breeding system
   and pollination ecology, seed dispersal and genetic variation. In a
   collaborative project, all these factors were studied in the rare
   endemic, predominantly monoecious shrub Bencomia exstipulata Svent.
   (Rosaceae), which grows exclusively in the national parks of El Teide
   (Tenerife) and La Caldera de Taburiente (La Palma). Demography was
   monitored through annual censuses of individual plants in a natural and
   an augmented population on Tenerife. The breeding system and
   reproductive success were studied through bagging and pollination
   experiments, and insect visitation censuses. Seed dispersal by animals
   was assessed using cafetaria experiments. With matrix projection models
   and stochastic simulations, we show that the Tenerife population was
   demographically stable. This was largely explainable by the high
   survival of adult individuals. Despite frequent germination, successful
   seedling recruitment was very rare. Male and female flowers occurred in
   separate inflorescences within individuals, although some inflorescences
   were mixed and some shrubs were entirely male or female. Despite
   frequent visits by honeybees, the species is predominantly wind
   pollinated. Insect-proof bags reduced seed set by 12.5\%, and
   pollen-proof bags by 44\%. Large quantities of airborne pollen were
   detected on unbagged sticky microscope slides, this was 56\% reduced by
   insect-proof and 96\% by pollen-proof bags. Hence, some self-pollination
   also seems to occur. Cafetaria experiments showed that the local lizards
   (Gallotia galloti Oudart) readily eat the fruits and that the seeds pass
   through their intestines unharmed and germinable. Since other dispersal
   vectors are unknown, saurochory seems the most likely mode of dispersal.
   Our study strongly suggests that the population of B. exstipulata on
   Tenerife is viable, and that there are no significant threats associated
   with its breeding system, pollination or seed dispersal. To alleviate
   the natural extinction risk typical of narrow endemics, five main
   conservation measures are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination syndrome concept implies that flowers evolved with
   particular sets of characteristics, such as colors, shapes,

   However, these traits may have also evolved to deter unwanted visitors.
   The North American genus Penstemon exhibits a great floral diversity
   that is mainly associated with bumblebee and hummingbird pollination.
   Evolutionary shifts from insect pollination to hummingbird pollination
   have occurred in Penstemon repeatedly, but some species maintain
   mixed-pollination systems and intermediate floral traits between bee-
   and hummingbird-pollination modes. The apparently intermediate floral
   traits of species with mixed-pollination systems might be potentially
   acting to deter bumblebee foragers. Then, bird-flower traits might be
   selected with increased hummingbird visitation over evolutionary time
   might, resulting in specialization to and the evolution of floral traits
   present in hummingbird-pollinated species. Here, we modified
   bee-pollination floral traits in Penstemon gentianoides with a mixed
   pollination system, to resemble hummingbird-pollination traits, and
   measured the effects of trait modification on bumblebee foraging
   behavior and plant female reproductive fitness. Our results showed that
   reduction in the width of the corolla tube and the absence of the
   corolla lip negatively affects bumblebee visitation and their efficiency

   enhanced the anti-bee effect. We conclude that acquisition of floral

   prep). We document 202 species and morphospecies from 32 genera within
   five families, of which 25 species represent the first published state
   records for Montana. This study increases our overall understanding of
   the distribution of wild bee species associated with agroecosystems of
   the northern US Rockies, which is important for efforts aimed at
   conserving bee biodiversity and supporting sustainable crop pollination
   systems on farmlands.
   New information
   We provide a species list of wild bees associated with diversified
   farmlands in Montana and increase the number of published bee species
   records in the state from 374 to at least 399. The list includes new
   distributional records for 25 wild bee species, including two species
   that represent considerable expansions of their known ranges,
   Lasioglossum (Dialictus) clematisellum (Cockerell 1904) with previously
   published records from New Mexico, Arizona, California and Utah and
   Melissodes (Eumelissodes) niveus Robertson 1895 which was reported to
   range from New York to Minnesota and Kansas, south to North Carolina,
   Alabama and Mississippi.}},

Abstract = {{The genotype of the pollen that fertilizes the ovule is known to affect
   the characteristics of fruits and nuts for many species, a phenomenom
   known as the xenia effect. Cross-pollination increases fruit set, nut
   mass, kernel mass and kernel recovery of macadamia nuts at maturity when
   compared with self-pollination. However there is limited information on
   the xenic effects of different macadamia cultivars used as cross
   pollen-parents on the fruit components and fruit development. The aim of
   this study was to clarify in what nut components and at what
   developmental stages xenic effects occurred. Two large-seeded macadamia
   cultivars, `HAES 246' and `FiV A16', were used as maternal trees and
   pollen-parents were `HAES 246', `FIV A16' and `HAES 814', a small-seeded
   cultivar. Pollen-parents affected the mass of both the syngamous tissue
   of the kernel (embryo) and the tissues of maternal origin; i.e. the husk
   (pericarp) and shell (testa). Xenic effects were detected in the
   endosperm 6 weeks after pollination and in fruit, nut and kernel size
   and mass from 10 weeks after pollination until maturity. Nut mass,
   kernel mass and kernel recovery of macadamia were increased
   significantly by a different pollen-parent. The HV A16 pollen on HAES
   246 flowers produced an increase of 11\% nut mass compared with HV 814
   pollen on HAES 246 flowers. This would increase the gross margin of a
   farm producing 4.5 t/ha of nuts by \$2574/ha at typical 2018 prices.
   Macadamia growers and the macadamia industry would benefit from
   identification and use of the most beneficial cross-pollen sources
   available.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims As most plants rely on pollination for persistence
   in communities, pollination interactions should be important
   determinants of plant community assembly. Here, trait and phylogenetic
   null modelling approaches were combined with pollinator interaction
   networks to elucidate the processes structuring flower colour assembly
   patterns in Asteraceae communities in Namaqualand, South Africa.
   Methods Plant species were assigned to flower colour pattern categories
   (CPCs) that incorporate the complexity of the bulls-eye colour pattern,
   using pollinator vision models. Null models were used to assess whether
   daisy communities exhibit clustering (driven by filtering, facilitation
   or convergence) or overdispersion (driven by competitive exclusion or
   character displacement) of CPCs. Next, flower visitor networks were
   constructed for communities with non-random CPC assembly to confirm the
   functional role of pollinators in determining floral trait assembly.
   Key Results Plant species are unevenly distributed across CPCs, the
   majority of which are not phylogenetically conserved, suggesting that
   certain CPCs have a selective advantage. Clustering of CPCs in
   communities is more frequent than overdispersion, and this does not
   reflect non-random phylogenetic assembly. In most communities at least
   one CPC is overrepresented relative to null assemblages. Interaction
   networks show that each community has a single dominant pollinator that
   strongly interacts with the overrepresented CPC, suggesting a role for
   pollinator preferences in driving clustered assembly of CPCs within
   daisy communities.
   Conclusion This novel approach, which demonstrates non-random assembly
   of complex flower colour patterns and corroborates their functional
   association with particular pollinators, provides strong evidence that
   pollinators influence plant community assembly. Results suggest that in
   some community contexts the benefits of pollinator sharing outweigh the
   costs of heterospecific pollen transfer, generating clustered assembly.
   They also challenge the perception of generalized pollination in
   daisies, suggesting instead that complex daisy colour patterns represent
   a pollination syndrome trait linked to specific fly pollinators.}},
