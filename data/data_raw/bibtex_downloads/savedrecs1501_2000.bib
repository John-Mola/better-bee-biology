Abstract = {{The abundance of important providers of ecosystem services such as wild
   bees likely increases with landscape heterogeneity, but may also
   fluctuate across the flowering season following varying weather
   conditions.
   In the present study, we investigated the combined effect of landscape
   heterogeneity and intra-annual variability in temperature and
   precipitation on the spatial and temporal stability of wild bee
   abundance.
   We used bee monitoring data from six 4 km x 4 km sites in central
   Germany and 16 local communities per site. The data were collected six
   times per year from 2010 to 2013. Following a multimodel inference
   approach, we identified the importance of landscape heterogeneity,
   weather variability and their interaction to the stability of wild bee
   abundance.
   We found that the stability of wild bee abundance increased with
   landscape heterogeneity, but decreased with increasing intra-annual
   variability in both temperature and precipitation. However, our key
   finding was a buffering mechanism enabling high abundance stability in
   heterogeneous landscapes even under highly variable temperature
   conditions. Interestingly, the same mechanism did not apply for high
   variability in precipitation.
   Our findings suggest that increasing landscape heterogeneity is
   beneficial for protecting wild bees against the projected increase in
   temperature variability until the end of the twenty first century,
   although we cannot make inferences for extreme events such as heatwaves.
   Nevertheless, our results equally highlight that landscape heterogeneity
   should not be treated as a one-size-fits-all solution and the need
   remains for developing alternative strategies to mitigate the effect of
   increasing variability in precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Euglossine bees (Apidae: Euglossini) have long been hypothesized to act
   as long-distance pollinators of many low-density tropical plants. We
   tested this hypothesis by the analysis of gene flow and genetic
   structure within and among populations of the euglossine beepollinated
   vine Dalechampia scandens.
   Using microsatellite markers, we assessed historical gene flow by the
   quantification of regional-scale genetic structure and isolation by
   distance among 18 populations, and contemporary gene flow by the
   estimation of recent migration rates among populations. To assess
   bee-mediated pollen dispersal on a smaller scale, we conducted paternity
   analyses within a focal population, and quantified within-population
   spatial genetic structure in four populations.
   Gene flow was limited to certain nearby populations within continuous
   forest blocks, whereas drift appeared to dominate on larger scales.
   Limited long-distance gene flow was supported by within-population
   patterns; gene flow was biased towards nearby plants, and significant
   small-scale spatial genetic structure was detected within populations.
   These findings suggest that, although female euglossine bees might be
   effective at moving pollen within populations, and perhaps within forest
   blocks, their contribution to gene flow on the regional scale seems too
   limited to counteract genetic drift in patchily distributed tropical
   plants. Among-population gene flow might have been reduced following
   habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{center dot A third of all angiosperm species produce flowers with petals
   fused into a corolla tube. The various elaborations of corolla tube
   attributes, such as length, width and curvature, have enabled plants to
   exploit many specialized pollinator groups. These elaborations often
   differ dramatically among closely related species, contributing to
   pollinator shift and pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation and
   speciation. However, very little is known about the genetic and
   developmental control of these corolla tube attributes.
   center dot Here we report the characterization of a semi-dominant mutant
   in the monkeyflower species Mimulus lewisii, with a substantial decrease
   in corolla tube width but no change in tube length. This morphological
   alteration leads to a similar to 70\% decrease in bumblebee visitation
   rate for the homozygous mutant compared to the wild-type.
   center dot Through bulk segregant analysis and transgenic experiment, we
   show that the mutant phenotype is caused by a dominant-negative mutation
   in an actin gene. This mutation decreases epidermal cell width but not
   length, and probably also reduces the number of lateral cell divisions.

   `housekeeping' gene in fine-tuning the development of an ecologically

Abstract = {{Plant height is an important trait for plant reproductive success. Plant
   height is often under pollinator-mediated selection, and has been shown
   to be correlated with various other traits. However, few studies have
   examined the evolutionary trajectory of plant height under selection and
   the pleiotropic effects of plant height evolution. We conducted a
   bi-directional artificial selection experiment on plant height with fast
   cycling Brassica rapa plants to estimate its heritability and genetic
   correlations, and to reveal evolutionary responses to artificial
   selection on height and various correlated traits. With the divergent
   lines obtained through artificial selection, we subsequently conducted
   pollinator-choice assays and investigated resource limitation of fruit
   production. We found that plant height variation is strongly genetically
   controlled (with a realized heritability of 41-59\%). Thus, plant height
   can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection. In addition, we found
   remarkable pleiotropic effects in phenology, morphology, floral scent,
   color, nectar and leaf glucosinolates. Most traits were increased in
   tall-line plants, but flower size, UV reflection and glucosinolates were
   decreased, indicating potential trade-offs. Pollinators preferred plants
   of the tall selection lines over the short selection lines in both
   greenhouse experiments with bumblebees and field experiment with natural
   pollinators. We did not detect any differences in resource limitation
   between plants of the different selection lines. Overall, our study
   predicts that increased height should evolve under positive
   pollinator-mediated directional selection with potential trade-offs in
   floral signals and herbivore defense.}},

Abstract = {{The orchid genus Pachites, endemic to the Cape Floristic Region of South
   Africa, comprises two rare and poorly studied species which, despite
   several morphological differences, are considered congeneric based on a
   few shared characters. Here, we quantify previously undocumented floral
   traits related to pollination ecology including rewards, scent, and
   breeding system and include the species in a molecular phylogenetic and
   dating analysis to reconstruct the evolution of trait similarity and
   variation. Flowers of P. bodkinii produce oil and are characterised by a
   scent bouquet comprising 59 compounds including aliphatics, benzenoids
   and isoprenoids. 3,5-Dimethoxytoluene, prominent among these, is also
   produced by flowers of several distantly related species pollinated by
   oil-collecting Rediviva bees and is known to elicit antennal responses
   in these insects. We found that flowers of P. appressus are capable of
   autonomous self-pollination, produce neither nectar nor oil, and their
   500-fold weaker scent includes fewer than ten compounds. Separate
   phylogenetic analyses of plastid and nuclear data partitions both
   strongly supported a monophyletic Pachites in which the two species
   diverged approximately 12 million years ago. Of the features that
   characterise this genus, the long column part is clearly derived,
   whereas the subequal sepals and petals may be derived or plesiomorphic.
   Together, these results suggest that general floral trait similarity
   between Pachites species reflects common ancestry, whereas differences
   in floral morphology, rewards and scent chemistry likely reflect
   adaptations for different pollination strategies, which evolved during

Title = {{Wild pollinators enhance oilseed rape yield in small-holder farming

Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Insect pollinators play an important role in crop
   pollination, but the relative contribution of wild pollinators and honey
   bees to pollination is currently under debate. There is virtually no
   information available on the strength of pollination services and the
   identity of pollination service providers from Asian smallholder farming
   systems, where fields are small, and variation among fields is high. We
   established 18 winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) fields along a
   large geographical gradient in Jiangxi province in China. In each field,
   oilseed rape plants were grown in closed cages that excluded pollinators
   and open cages that allowed pollinator access. The pollinator community
   was sampled by pan traps for the entire oilseed rape blooming period.
   Results: Oilseed rape plants from which insect pollinators were excluded
   had on average 38\% lower seed set, 17\% lower fruit set and 12\% lower
   yield per plant, but the seeds were 17\% heavier, and the caged plants
   had 28\% more flowers and 18\% higher aboveground vegetative biomass
   than plants with pollinator access. Oilseed rape plants thus compensate
   for pollination deficit by producing heavier seeds and more flowers.
   Regression analysis indicated that local abundance and diversity of wild
   pollinators were positively associated with seed set and yield/straw
   ratio, while honey bee abundance was not related to yield parameters.
   Conclusions: Wild pollinator abundance and diversity contribute to
   oilseed rape yield by enhancing plant resource allocation to seeds
   rather than to above-ground biomass. This study highlights the
   importance of the conservation of wild pollinators to support oilseed
   rape production in small-holder farming systems in China.}},

Abstract = {{There is consensus that land-use change is a main driver behind the
   recent declines of many pollinator populations in Europe. However, it is
   still not adequately understood how the local resource quality and
   landscape composition influence pollinators, and if and how the effects
   vary in space and time. We analysed the influence of landscape- (2 km
   radius) and local scale- (50 m transects) resources on bumblebee species
   richness and abundance during two years in South-eastern Norway, where
   agriculture is highly modernised but landscapes still show limited
   spatial homogenization. Local flower density and species richness were
   strongly positively associated with bumblebee densities and species
   richness, but higher landscape-level flower species richness were linked
   to lower local bumblebee abundances. Early and late mass flowering crops
   had clear, but contrasting, effects. The total area of early flowering
   crops had a consistent negative impact on bumblebee density and species
   richness throughout the season, while late flowering crops had a
   positive impact in the beginning of the season before their bloom,
   suggesting a carry-over effect from previous years. The negative effects
   of early flowering crops could be due to competition of bumblebees with
   honey-bees, which are widely used in these crops. Bumblebee density and
   species richness were clearly negatively correlated with the total area
   of forest and flower-poor land use areas, including grass fields and
   cereals. In contrast, bumblebees were positively associated with most
   linear elements in the landscape (especially pasture and cropland
   verges), except for roads, which negatively affected bumblebee
   densities, possibly due to increased mortality, since the quality of the
   flower resources did not differ from other linear elements. Our results
   show that the quality and the spatial and temporal distribution of
   flower resources within the landscape are important drivers for
   bumblebees, but can create counterintuitive distribution patterns
   depending on the temporal and spatial resolution of the survey.
   Increasing flower resources in linear elements and the amount of late

Abstract = {{Agricultural land management modifies ecosystem structure and
   functioning in natural landscapes. Pollinators are a key functional
   group that may suffer from such intensification. Here we evaluate how
   agricultural land management influences the diversity of pollen
   transported by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among
   plants. We described pollen transport networks (which allow assessing
   the contribution of pollinators to the flow of pollen among plants) in
   agricultural and restored fragments in three sites representative of the
   pampas region of Argentina. We analyzed diversity of pollen transported
   by pollinators and the pollination niche overlap among plants in both
   types of fragments with general and generalized linear mixed models. The
   agricultural fragments were associated to increased diversity of
   transported pollen and pollination niche overlap among plants. Greater
   pollination niche overlap in agricultural fragments was associated with
   increased abundance of exotic plants. Our results indicate that
   agricultural intensification has significantly increased the diversity
   of pollen and the pollination niche overlap in natural communities by
   promoting exotic plants and generalized plant pollinator interactions.
   Strategies to encourage improvements in the quality of pollination in
   agroecosystems could range from controlling the levels of exotic species
   to mechanisms that promote increased diversity of native plants. (C)

Abstract = {{Pollination is frequently identified as an important ecosystem service
   to agricultural production. In contrast, ecosystem disservices are
   rarely considered. This study explores pollinator service versus
   disservice in lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) production.
   This crop is highly managed, requires insect pollination, and has a
   relatively long bloom; when combined, these characteristics may cause a
   portion of early season pollination to result in premature ripening and
   loss. To test this, we exposed early and late flowering clones to early
   season (wild) pollination only or late season (wild and managed)
   pollination only. Contrary to our hypothesis of disservice, pre-harvest
   loss, shatter, and sugar content were consistent across treatments, even
   though early season pollination plots exhibited heavier berries.
   Remarkably, early season pollination plots produced over 70\% of the
   total production of late season pollination plots. These results suggest
   that early season pollination by wild pollinators does not present an
   ecosystem disservice to lowbush blueberry production. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator
   populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment
   schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator
   population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES
   grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species
   richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the
   response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and
   hoverfiies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental
   mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the
   beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first
   cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control
   meadows but leaving 10-20\% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The
   rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the
   availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing
   refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies
   and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using
   pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first
   cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there
   was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the
   meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting
   resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and
   refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a
   higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows,
   whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge
   compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous
   hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge
   meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory
   hoverfiies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge
   compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by
   sweep netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a
   common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of
   pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the
   contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting
   heterogeneous management practices Within the landscape is important for
   supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services
   such as pollination and biocontrol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding how climate change may affect species distribution helps
   predict how ecosystem services, such as pollination, could be impaired
   in the future. We examine the potential consequences of climate change
   on the geographical distribution of five native bee species and estimate
   the possible effects of bee distribution shifts on tomato crops in
   Brazil. Ensemble forecasting was implemented through five algorithms in
   two carbon emission scenarios to predict range shifts for five
   tomato-visiting bee species for the year 2100. We then calculated the
   total tomato crop area in the cells with at least 50\% bee suitability,
   for each bee species, in each scenario. Results showed that all species
   will undergo a reduction in suitable areas in both scenarios. Bombus
   mono had the greatest area reduction in 2100 under the optimistic and
   pessimistic scenarios: near 38\% and 71\%, respectively. Centris tarsata
   had the smaller area reduction under the same scenarios: 8.5\% and
   19.5\% respectively. The high agreement between tomato crops and bee
   distribution observed in the present will also be reduced in both
   Scenarios for all species, especially in the pessimistic scenario. B.
   mono had the highest reduction in range due to habitat suitability and
   will be restricted to some parts of southeastern and southern Brazil.
   Over 60\% of the tomato crop area presently within the distribution of
   B. mono will become climatically unsuitable in the pessimistic emission
   scenario. This study indicates that the predicted climate change may
   negatively impact several species associated with tomato crops in Brazil
   by the year 2100. This is troubling, as it could result in tomato
   production losses, which would bring economic and environmental losses
   to the tomato-producing regions with implications for pollinator

Abstract = {{Fruit cultivation highly depends on insect pollination for fruit
   development. Yet, fruit cultivation as an intensive land use can
   possibly alter the diversity of pollinator communities and the
   corresponding pollination service. In this study we investigate how
   intensive fruit cultivation influences both pollinator diversity and
   fruit set in sweet cherry orchards in Flanders, Belgium. Negative
   relations were detected between intensive fruit cultivation within 250 m
   around the orchards and both pollinator species richness and wild
   pollinator abundance. Honeybee abundance on cherry blossom was
   positively related with intensive fruit cultivation within 1000 m. Sweet
   cherry fruit set decreased with increasing intensive fruit cultivation
   within 250 m and 1000 m around the orchards. These findings suggest that
   intensive land use such as intensive fruit cultivation can undermine the
   pollination service of wild pollinators. In addition, the loss of this
   pollination service was not compensated by honeybees. In these intensive
   agricultural landscapes the production of sweet cherry is below the
   optimum, inducing a clear yield gap. In order to gain the full benefit
   of intensive agriculture, the pollination service needs to be optimised.

   also impeded resulting in a reduction of mating rates by up to 80\%.
   Moreover, treated females were no longer able to locate hosts by using
   olfactory cues. Olfaction is crucial for the reproductive success of
   parasitoid wasps. Hence, sublethal doses of neonicotinoids might

Abstract = {{Complex internal skeletal structures, despite their potential as rich
   sources of phylogenetic information, are still poorly described and used
   in comparative studies of insects in general, and bees in particular. In
   this study we present the results of a comprehensive investigation of
   the internal structures of the mesosoma of bees (e.g. prosternum,
   propleuron, mesofurca/metafurca and mesophragma); a comparative study
   was undertaken for bees in general with special emphasis on the tribe
   Apini. Phylogenetically informative characters are defined and the
   morphological terminology used for bees is standardized to that used for
   other Hymenoptera. The potential of these morphological complexes as
   sources of phylogenetic information was evaluated contrasting the data
   obtained here with alternative scenarios for corbiculate phylogeny and a
   phylogenetic analysis was performed. The prosternum possessed the
   largest number of unambiguous character state changes - nine
   transformations in the most parsimonious scenario. The changes include
   the produced lateral processes of the prosternum, absence of the
   profurcal pit, constriction between the basisternum and the
   furcasternum, and absence of pubescence on the surface of the
   basisternum. On the other hand, considerable homoplasy was observed
   particularly for the characters from the propleuron and
   mesofurca/metafurca. This may be the consequence of a long morphological
   branch separating Apini from the remaining apids or a rapid
   diversification of the corbiculate lineages. In this context, the
   inclusion of fossil information and use of new technologies for
   phenotypic studies can open new windows for future comparative

Abstract = {{Calotropis procera (Ait.) R.Br. (Apocynaceae), an invasive woody
   milkweed, has expanded its range in northern Australia affecting
   rangeland and pastoral productivity. While self-compatibility should
   enhance the species range expansion, spread of C.procera is limited by
   the availability of larger wasp and bee species that are able to vector
   its solid pollinia. Pollination efficiency is thus likely dependent on
   both pollinator abundance and plant density. Calotropis procera flowers
   year round in Australia but fruiting is limited to the warm months of
   the year when pollinators are most abundant, indicating that seasonal
   regulation of reproduction may be due to pollinator limitation. We
   examine the propositions that C.procera reproduction is regulated by the
   interaction between plant population density and pollinator pressure and
   that low pollinator pressure causes low per capita plant fecundity. All
   pollinators belonged to Order Hymenoptera and pollinator composition was
   similar at six of the seven sites. Fruit production per plant
   (fecundity) was lower above and below intermediate densities
   (350-550plantsha(-1)) of flowering plants with evidence of a weak Allee
   effect at lower plant density. Pollinator visitation rates per plant
   were low at high and low plant densities, and greatest at intermediate
   densities, while pollen supplementation experiments showed that
   C.procera is pollen limited (Pollen Limitation Index(fruit)=0.9) even at
   intermediate densities. Pollen limitation caused by low pollinator
   pressure at low plant densities and pollinator satiation at high plant
   densities may account for these fruit production trends. Management
   should be conducted in the colder months when pollinator pressure is low
   and plants are not reproducing. In addition, where stand eradication
   cannot be achieved in one attempt, management should reduce flowering
   plants to below intermediate densities where the fecundity per plant is
   low.}},

Abstract = {{Repeated exposure to inhibitory compounds can drive the evolution of

   phytochemicals in nectar and pollen have antimicrobial properties that
   can ameliorate infection in pollinators, but evolved resistance among
   parasites could diminish the medicinal efficacy of phytochemicals.
   However, multicompound blends, which occur in nectar and pollen, present
   simultaneous chemical challenges that may slow resistance evolution. We
   assessed evolution of resistance by the common bumble bee gut parasite
   Crithidia bombi to two floral phytochemicals, singly and combined, over
   6weeks (similar to 100 generations) of chronic exposure. Resistance of
   C.bombi increased under single and combined phytochemical exposure,
   without any associated costs of reduced growth under phytochemical-free
   conditions. After 6weeks' exposure, phytochemical concentrations that
   initially inhibited growth by >50\%, and exceeded concentrations in
   floral nectar, had minimal effects on evolved parasite lines.
   Unexpectedly, the phytochemical combination did not impede resistance
   evolution compared to single compounds. These results demonstrate that
   repeated phytochemical exposure, which could occur in homogeneous floral
   landscapes or with therapeutic phytochemical treatment of managed hives,
   can cause rapid evolution of resistance in pollinator parasites. We
   discuss possible explanations for submaximal phytochemical resistance in

Abstract = {{1. Data collection on interactions between organisms and their
   environment has traditionally been conducted by on-site human
   observations, a time-consuming enterprise that could explain the
   shortage of around-the-clock observations of free-ranging wild animals.
   In this paper, I outline a time-efficient procedure to collect data on
   flower-visiting animals. The objectives were, first, to model diel
   activity rhythms by using cosine-based mixed-effects regression models
   (cosinor method) on data from an established automatic video monitoring
   system and, secondly, to test the use of a cheap off-the-shelf digital
   camera modified for automated monitoring of flower visitors. Two
   different model systems were studied: foraging bumblebees visiting focal
   white clovers, monitored around-the-clock (193h) to model diel activity;
   and honeybees visiting thistles, monitored over a shorter period (5h) to
   test the applicability and reliability of a new method for monitoring
   pollinators. The data were automatically entered and processed using
   R-scripts after manual filtering of the images, obviating the need for
   manual data entry prior to analysis. For diel activity in bumblebees,
   the model that gave the best fit included the 24-h fundamental period
   and one harmonic, a 12-h period to modulate the signal, together with
   temperature. The bumblebees were exclusive diurnal, with activity
   starting about 5h after sunrise, peaking sharply in the afternoon and
   ending about 1h before sunset. In addition to time of day, activity also
   increased with temperature. The off-the-shelf digital camera, Canon
   PowerShot((R)), with motion detection script, was triggered by every
   flower-visiting honeybee. In addition to recorded visitor frequency and
   visitor duration, it enabled high-resolution images, which could be
   important for species identification. Automatic camera recording is
   advantageous for close-up monitoring, compared with continuous video
   recording, because the latter demands more time and effort in reviewing
   the material. It could be used to study a range of different species
   such as pollinators, on-plant behaviour of herbivorous animals, cavity
   dwellers or cavity breeders. Moreover, the procedures for automatic data
   entry, data processing and statistical analysis for modelling diel
   activity rhythms could have great relevance for researchers using other
   types of camera monitoring systems operating 24h per day.}},

Abstract = {{Urucu (Melipona scutellaris L.) is an example of a native stingless bee
   typical of northeastern Brazil. It stands out due to its high-quality
   honey and for being responsible for 40 to 90\% of the pollination of
   native plant species. A total of 37 honey samples were analysed,
   collected between July 2012 and June 2014 in a meliponary located in the
   municipality of Entre Rios, in the state of Bahia, Brazil. Honey samples
   were diluted in distilled water, then in alcohol, and then were
   acetolysed. Climate information (precipitation and temperature) for the
   area was obtained during the same period of time. We found 102 pollen
   types, of which 71 were identified as belonging to 36 plant families.
   Fabaceae was the most representative family with 15 types, followed by
   Myrtaceae with seven types. Myrtaceae was highly significant due to the
   high distribution frequency and dominance of the Eucalyptus type. The
   Miconia type (Melastomataceae), highly polliniferous, also stood out in
   our analysis with a high distribution frequency and dominance in some of
   the sampled months. The precipitation index of the second year of study
   (August 2013 to June 2014) was much greater than the first year (July
   2012 to June 2013), being proportional to the increase of pollen
   diversity in the same period.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The archetypical double sigmoid-shaped growth curve
   of the sweet cherry drupe (Prunus avium) does not address critical
   development from eco-dormancy to anthesis and has not been correlated to
   reproductive bud development. Accurate representation of the growth and
   development of post-anthesis ovaries is confounded by anthesis timing,
   fruiting-density and the presence of unfertilized and defective ovaries
   whose growth differs from those that persist to maturation. These
   factors were addressed to assess pre-anthesis and full-season growth and
   development of three sweet cherry cultivars, `Chelan', `Bing' and
   `Sweetheart', differing primarily in seasonal duration and fruit size.
   Methods Volume was calculated from photographic measurements of
   reproductive buds, ovaries and pits at all phases of development. A
   population of unfertilized ovaries was produced using bee-exclusion
   netting to enable a statistical comparison with an open pollinated
   population to detect differences in size and shape between successful
   and failing fruit growth. Anthesis timing and fruiting-density were
   manipulated by floral extinction at the spur and whole-tree scales.
   Developmental time indices were analysed using polynomial curve fitting
   of log-transformed data supported by Richards and logistic functions of
   asymptotic growth of the pit and maturing fruit, respectively.
   Key Results Pre-anthesisgrowth began at the completion of eco-dormancy.
   A slight decline in relative growth rate (RGR) was observed during bud
   scale separation approx. -16 d from anthesis (DFA) before resumption of
   exponential growth to a maximum about 14 DFA. After anthesis, reduced
   growth of unfertilized or defective ovaries was partly discriminated
   from successful fruit at 5 DFA and completely at 25 DFA. Time indices of
   RGR inflections were similar among cultivars when adjusted for anthesis
   date alone, until the end of pit growth. Asymptotic growth of the pit
   underpinned the declining growth rate of fruit at the end of the first
   exponential growth phase. Duration of the subsequent expansive growth
   phase accounted for genotypic differences in seasonal duration and final
   size. Pit size and final fruit size were inversely related to
   fruiting-density.
   Conclusions Developmental differences among early, mid and late maturing
   cultivars were not detected until the final growth period.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation measures to preserve critically endangered species aim to
   maintain healthy and self-sustaining populations and often involve
   reintroductions. Effective introductions must take into account the
   genetic structure and diversity remaining in the species to inform
   choices of germplasm for introduction strategies. Lupinus aridorum
   (McFarlin ex Beckner; Fabaceae) is an endangered plant found on two
   disjunct ridge systems in central Florida. All plants are found in areas
   that are favored for human development and agriculture. Few options
   exist for introduction locations, so the most informed strategies must
   be used to preserve this species. We used ten microsatellite loci,
   developed for this species, to determine genetic diversity and genetic
   differentiation among populations, and to compare L. aridorum with two
   closely related congeners. Our results show a low level of diversity
   remaining in the species in comparison with a more abundant congener and
   similar levels of variability among each L. aridorum population. At
   least three L. aridorum populations exhibit a genetic signal of partial
   selfing. Hybridization with a closely-related congener was not apparent;
   however, additional crossing trials are needed to fully assess the
   possibility of hybridization. Although some sources list the taxonomy of
   L. aridorum as a variety of a Florida panhandle species, L. westianus
   (Small), the genetic differences revealed by our data support listing
   these two species as separate entities. Our findings can be used to
   guide sampling strategies for ex situ conservation such as providing a

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest an alarming decline in pollinators across many
   regions of the world due to multiple factors. One potential factor is
   climate change, which poses both direct and indirect threats to
   pollinator populations. To help ameliorate the impact of declining
   populations on the function of ecological and agricultural systems,
   there is a need to identify species that may adapt to limit the
   magnitude of this pollination deficit. The South West Pacific has a
   highly depauperate endemic bee diversity and numerous non-indigenous
   species, including honeybees. One allodapine bee, Braunsapis puangensis,
   has been accidentally introduced to Fiji where it has rapidly spread
   across multiple islands and become locally abundant. It is a
   long-tongued bee, unaffected by honeybee pathogens, and has the
   potential to become an important crop pollinator. Here, we model the
   distribution of this species under different climate scenarios to
   determine how it is likely to respond to future climate change. We show
   that its distribution is unlikely to contract, but potentially expand
   with climate warming. These scenarios therefore indicate that the
   plasticity in B.puangensis populations may allow it to represent an
   important crop pollinator in this region should honeybee populations
   decline.}},

Abstract = {{Receiver biases offer opportunities for the evolution of deception in
   signalling systems. Many spiders use conspicuous body colouration to
   lure prey, yet the perceptual basis of such deception remains largely
   unknown. Here we use knowledge of visual perception in key pollinator
   groups (bees and flies) to test whether colour-based lures resemble
   floral signals. We addressed this question at two levels: first
   according to the spectral reflectance of Australian orb-web spiders and
   flowers across a broad continental range, and second in reference to
   polymorphic variation in the species Gasteracantha fornicata. Analysis
   at the community level supported the hypotheses for broad-scale
   convergence among spider and flower signals. Moreover, data for G.
   fornicata indicate that each lure morph presents a signal biased towards
   the colouration of sympatric flowers. This analysis identified fly-
   and/or bee-pollinated plants whose flowers are likely to be
   indistinguishable from each G. fornicata colour morph. Our findings
   support the hypothesis that deceptive colour-based lures exploit prey
   preferences for floral resources. Further, the evidence implies a
   greater role for specific model/mimic relationships over generalised
   resemblance to flower-like stimuli as a driver of lure colouration and

   across June and July, (iii) with density of distribution of pitchers or
   (iv) with bumblebee gender. Pitcher contents were examined from an
   established population of Sarracenia purpurea growing in Dorset, UK.
   Results show that the total extent to which bumblebees were captured
   differed over the years 2012-2014 inclusive. A 1-year study in 2013
   showed that more bumblebees were caught in July than in June and more
   bumblebees were captured when pitchers grew at high density. Results
   from 2013 also showed that more pitchers caught more than one bumblebee
   than would be expected based on a normal probability distribution and
   that this phenomenon affects female and male bumblebees equally. We
   discuss possible reasons for these results including that the bumblebees
   may be using S. purpurea as a resource. Further work is required to
   establish the exact underpinning mechanisms and the relative roles of

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sustainable and resilient agricultural systems are needed to feed and
   fuel a growing human population. However, the current model of
   agricultural intensification which produces high yields has also
   resulted in a loss of biodiversity, ecological function, and critical
   ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. A key consequence of
   agricultural intensification is landscape simplification, where once
   heterogeneous landscapes contain increasingly fewer crop and non-crop
   habitats. Landscape simplification exacerbates biodiversity losses which
   leads to reductions in ecosystem services on which agriculture depends.
   In recent decades, considerable research has focused on mitigating these
   negative impacts, primarily via management of habitats to promote
   biodiversity and enhance services at the local scale. While it is well
   known that local and landscape factors interact, modifying overall
   landscape structure is seldom considered due to logistical constraints.
   I propose that the loss of ecosystem services due to landscape
   simplification can only be addressed by a concerted effort to
   fundamentally redesign agricultural landscapes. Designing agricultural
   landscapes will require that scientists work with stakeholders to
   determine the mix of desired ecosystem services, evaluate current
   landscape structure in light of those goals, and implement targeted
   modifications to achieve them. I evaluate the current status of
   landscape design, ranging from fundamental ecological principles to
   resulting guidelines and socioeconomic tools. While research gaps
   remain, the time is right for ecologists to engage with other
   disciplines, stakeholders, and policymakers in education and advocacy to
   foster agricultural landscape design for sustainable and resilient
   biodiversity services. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH

   We assessed whether the presence of a pond affects the abundance of
   pollinators and the quality and quantity of strawberry yield. We
   compared the abundance of pollinators and the quality and quantity of
   strawberries between habitats adjacent to the pond, semi-natural
   terrestrial habitat and field border without semi-natural vegetation
   (control habitat).
   We found significantly higher abundances of syrphids and bees next to
   ponds compared to control habitats. Also, syrphids were significantly
   more abundant at pond habitats compared to vegetation habitats and a
   similar tendency, although not significant, was found for the abundance
   of bees. The quantity and quality of strawberries was significantly
   higher near the vegetation and pond habitats compared to the control
   habitats.
   Our result supports the theory that the presence of semi-natural
   habitats, in the agricultural landscape benefits both public interest in
   biodiversity conservation and farmers' interest in crop pollination.
   These benefits may also come from ponds as semi natural habitats.
   However, further studies are required to disentangle the effect of the
   pond per se and the effect of the associated terrestrial vegetation. (C)

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are an essential component of our agroecosystems, and their
   decline represents a major threat for the sexual reproduction and hence
   survival of wild flowers and several important pollinator-dependent
   crops alike. The EU bumblebee fauna encompasses many highly imperiled
   species characterized by a relatively narrow range size and often
   restricted to high elevation mountain habitats where the threats of both
   current and future global warming are expected to be particularly
   severe. In this context, identifying how and where limited conservation
   resources should be targeted is a pressing priority to meet our
   fundamental biodiversity conservation targets in an
   economically-efficient way. Because classical taxonomic approaches to
   conservation can potentially overlook important alternative aspects of
   biodiversity such as the phylogenetic diversity, a key component for the
   maintenance of ecosystem processes and services, I used a multi-gene
   molecular phylogeny encompassing more than 85\% of the EU species to
   combine categories of the IUCN Red List with the evolutionary legacy and
   range size of EU bumblebees. My results from phylogenetic generalized
   least squares (PGLS) and phylogenetic independent contrasts (PIC)
   analyses first indicate that, contrary to theoretical prediction,
   evolutionary relatedness explains none of the range size similarity or
   the probability of extinction risk in EU buniblebees. Furthermore,
   although the extinction of extant threatened EU bumblebee species is
   unlikely to have a significant effect on the expected phylogenetic
   dispersion of the reniaining Bombus species at the EU scale, my results
   clearly illustrate that a significantly disproportionate amount of
   phylogenetic diversity/evolutionary history might be lost if the extant
   threatened EU bumblebee species would become extinct. Collectively, this
   study exemplifies the fact that the incorporation of a phylogenetic
   approach can increase the efficacy of the existing prioritization for
   the conservation of EU bumblebees (i) by capturing the phylogenetic
   diversity and its associated functions, as well as (ii) by better
   targeting species that are both evolutionarily unique (or
   non-redundant), threatened and restricted in their range size. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Conservation measures for bees often focus on increasing the diversity
   and abundance of floral resources. But it has not been clear if observed
   benefits of floral enhancements result from greater population growth,
   which is critical for the long-term success of conservation, or from
   mobile foragers aggregating in high-resource locations. Experimental
   evidence is only beginning to emerge in favor of the former mechanism
   and it is not well-established how different aspects of floral resources
   affect population growth. For example, bumble bee colonies may benefit
   from greater overall floral abundance, richness, or relative dominance
   of resource species. Because bumble bees are highly mobile, resource
   variability in the surrounding landscape is also important for colonies
   and may mediate local-scale effects. We experimentally assessed the
   growth and reproduction of bumble bee colonies (Bombus impatiens)
   deployed in grasslands in different local-and landscape-scale resource
   environments. We found that floral dominance, rather than the overall
   abundance or richness of floral resources, was the most important local
   factor for colony growth and reproduction. This may reflect more
   efficient foraging on a few numerically dominant and abundant resource
   species. Local-and landscape-scale predictor variables had interacting
   effects On colony growth and reproduction, suggesting that foraging
   distance depends on where in the landscape efficiently used resources
   are located. Our results provide further evidence that conservation
   strategies aimed at enhancing floral resources can increase bumble bee
   population growth. However, the most effective forth of floral
   enhancement may vary among bee species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Warm temperatures are required for insect flight. Consequently, warming
   could benefit many high-latitude and high-altitude insects by increasing
   opportunities for foraging or oviposition. However, warming can also
   alter species interactions, including interactions with natural enemies,
   making the net effect of rising temperatures on population growth rate
   difficult to predict. We investigated the temperature-dependence of
   nesting activity and lifetime reproductive output over 3 yr in subalpine
   populations of a pollen-specialist bee, Osmia iridis. Rates of nest
   provisioning increased with ambient temperatures and with availability
   of floral resources, as expected. However, warmer conditions did not
   increase lifetime reproductive output. Lifetime offspring production was
   best explained by rates of brood parasitism (by the wasp Sapyga), which
   increased with temperature. Direct observations of bee and parasite
   activity suggest that although activity of both species is favored by
   warmer temperatures, bees can be active at lower ambient temperatures,
   while wasps are active only at higher temperatures. Thus, direct
   benefits to the bees of warmer temperatures were nullified by indirect
   costs associated with increased parasite activity. To date, most studies
   of climate-change effects on pollinators have focused on changing
   interactions between pollinators and their floral host-plants (i.e.,
   bottom-up processes). Our results suggest that natural enemies (i.e.,
   top-down forces) can play a key role in pollinator population regulation
   and should not be overlooked in forecasts of pollinator responses to

Abstract = {{Pollination syndromes are suites of floral traits presumed to reflect
   adaptations to attract and utilize a ``primary{''} type of animal
   pollinator. However, syndrome traits may also function to deter
   ``secondary{''} flower visitors that reduce plant fitness through their
   foraging activities. Here we use the hummingbird-pollinated plant
   species Mimulus cardinalis as a model to investigate the potential
   deterrent effects of classic bird syndrome traits on bumble bee
   foragers. To establish that M. cardinalis flowers elicit an avoidance
   response in bees, we assessed the choice behavior of individual foragers
   on a mixed experimental array of M. cardinalis and its bee-pollinated
   sister species M. lewisii. As expected, bees showed a strong preference
   against M. cardinalis flowers (only 22\% of total bee visits were to M.
   cardinalis), but surprisingly also showed a high degree of individual
   specialization (95.2\% of total plant transitions were between
   conspecifics). To determine M. cardinalis floral traits that discourage
   bee visitation, we then assessed foraging responses of individuals to M.
   cardinalis-like and M. lewisii-like floral models differing in color,
   orientation, reward, and combinations thereof. Across experiments, M.
   cardinalis-like trait combinations consistently produced a higher degree
   of flower avoidance behavior and individual specialization than expected
   based on bee responses to each trait in isolation. We then conducted a
   series of flower discrimination experiments to assess the ability of
   bees to utilize traits and trait combinations associated with each
   species. Relative to M. lewisii-like alternatives, M. cardinalis-like
   traits alone had a minimal effect on bee foraging proficiency but
   together increased the time bees spent searching for rewarding flowers
   from 1.49 to 2.65 s per visit. Collectively, our results show that M.
   cardinalis flowers impose foraging costs on bumble bees sufficient to
   discourage visitation and remarkably, generate such costs through
   synergistic color-orientation and color-reward trait interactions.
   Floral syndromes therefore represent complex adaptations to multiple
   pollinator groups, rather than simply the primary pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Zeyheria tuberculosa, a Bignoniaceae tree that occurs in a broad
   latitudinal range in Brazilian forests, is a threatened species of
   seasonal tropical forest. It is crucial to enhance the knowledge on this
   species' floral biology, since interactions related to reproduction of
   plants are critical for the long term maintenance of their populations.
   Thus, we investigated the sexual reproduction and floral biology of Z.
   tuberculosa, including nectar features, aiming to understand the
   ecological processes associated to this mutualistic plant-animal
   interaction in the current modified landscape. For this, we performed
   experiments under natural conditions and in the laboratory. All the
   evaluated plants were self-incompatible. Zeyheria tuberculosa was
   pollinated by Bombus pauloensis, a medium-sized bee, and offered
   hexose-rich nectar as resource. Flowers were also visited by small-sized
   bee species, Trigona spinipes, that acted as pollen thief, and
   Pseudoaugochlora pandora and P. graminae that acted as nectar thieves.
   These three bee groups exhibited temporal separation in the peak of
   visits throughout the day. The peak of pollinator visits occurred
   firstly, which may allow the pollinator to access nectar and pollen
   loads before they are exploited by thieves. However, bee pollinator
   visits were scarce, and this fact, associated to the
   self-incompatibility of Z. tuberculosa, may explain the low fruit set
   registered in the studied plants. It could be of special concern for
   this threatened species maintenance in the medium and long term, which
   depends on the offspring originated by sexual reproduction. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Premise of research. Dust particles and pollen grains are similar in
   size. Dust deposition might therefore influence the pollination and
   reproduction of flowering plants. Little is known about such effects,
   however, despite more general interest in ecological effects of dust.
   Methodology. We used observational and experimental methods to explore
   whether dust generated by traffic on unpaved roads affects the amounts
   of pollen received and numbers of seeds produced by four species of
   native wildflowers in the western United States.
   Pivotal results. Flowers of Nuttall's larkspur (Delphinium
   nuttallianum), scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), Lewis flax
   (Linumlewisii), and sulphur paintbrush (Castilleja sulphurea) growing
   1-2mfrom a road received substantially more dust and less pollen than
   those growing 40-50 m away. We observed the same pattern when we
   transplanted individuals of the first two species into pots and placed
   pots near to compared with far from a road. Experimental ``hand
   dusting{''} of scarlet gilia and Lewis flax plants also reduced stigma
   pollen loads to a degree that resembled the average effect of road
   proximity for those species. On the other hand, numbers of seeds per
   flower ({''}seed set{''}) did not vary consistently for any species as a
   function of road proximity or hand-dusting treatment.
   Conclusions. Several mechanisms might contribute to the different
   effects of dust on pollen loads and seed set. Wediscuss four possible
   mechanisms, which we refer to as pollen excess, pollen quality, resource
   limitation, and compensatory herbivory. These mechanisms suggest avenues
   for further study of dust, pollination, and plant reproduction with this

   In addition, the low number of private alleles observed reinforces the

Abstract = {{In Japan, honey bees, bumblebees, and flies are used in strawberry

   growing one plant of `Shizutakara' with other cultivars and a single

   analysis showed that DNA fragments could not be detected in seeds

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes vary widely in the degree to which they provide
   natural habitat. This is in spite of the fact that the availability of
   natural habitat has been identified as a critical factor influencing the
   diversity and abundance of beneficial crop insects, including native
   pollinators. We examined the effect of the type of field edge habitat
   (forested or deforested) on the abundance and diversity of bee species
   foraging in 15 managed lowbush blueberry fields in the vicinity of St.
   Stephens, New Brunswick, Canada. Additionally, we tested whether edge
   habitat type was associated with differences in pollen limitation, fruit
   set, and seed set of adjacent lowbush blueberry plants. Finally, we used
   GIS to determine the influence of larger scale land use patterns on the
   pollinator community and crop success of individual fields. Our forested
   field edges were distinguished as having lower light availability,
   greater canopy cover, and a greater bee nesting habitat index than
   deforested edges. Forested edges also had a greater diversity of bees.
   In particular, they supported more species of cleptoparasitic bees than
   deforested edges. Meanwhile, the abundance of non-parasitic (i.e.,
   pollen-seeking) bees was greater along deforested edges. Blueberry
   plants along deforested edges tended to have more flowers, higher fruit
   set and marginally higher seed set than plants along forested edges. We
   found no difference in pollen limitation between edge types, suggesting
   that differences in fruit set were due to resource limitation. At the
   landscape level, we found no association among the amount of forest
   cover surrounding a field and the abundance or diversity of pollinators.
   However, on the forested edges of fields, we did find a positive
   correlation between the amount of forest surrounding a field and the
   abundance of pollinators. Our finding that forested edges had greater
   nesting habitat index and higher diversity of bees together suggest that
   the maintenance of areas of natural habitat within agricultural
   ecosystems helps to support greater pollinator diversity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Functional diversity loss among pollinators has rapidly progressed
   across the globe and is expected to influence plant-pollinator
   interactions in natural communities. Although recent findings suggest
   that the disappearance of a certain pollinator functional group may
   cause niche expansions and/or shifts in other groups, no study has
   examined this prediction in natural communities with high plant and
   pollinator diversities. By comparing coastal pollination networks on
   continental and oceanic islands, we examined how community-level flower
   visit patterns are influenced by the relative biomass of long-tongued
   pollinators (RBLP). We found that RBLP significantly correlated with
   pollinator functional diversity and was lower in oceanic than in
   continental islands. Pollinator niches shifted with decreasing RBLP,
   such that diverse species with various proboscis lengths, especially
   short-tongued species, increasingly visited long-tubed flowers. However,
   we found no conspicuous negative impacts of low RBLP and the consequent
   niche shifts on pollinator visit frequencies to flowers in oceanic
   island communities. Notably, fruit set significantly decreased as RBLP
   decreased in a study plant species. These results suggest that niche
   shifts by other functional groups can generally compensate for a decline
   in long-tongued pollinators in natural communities, but there may be
   negative impacts on plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Floral trait evolution is frequently attributed to pollinator-mediated
   selection but herbivores can play a key role in shaping plant
   reproductive biology. Here we examine the role of florivores in driving
   floral trait evolution and pollinator shifts in a recently radiated
   clade of flowering plants, Oenothera sect. Calylophus. We compare
   florivory by a specialist, internal feeder, Mompha, on closely related
   hawkmoth- and bee-pollinated species and document variation in damage
   based on floral traits within sites, species and among species. Our
   results show that flowers with longer floral tubes and decreased floral

   substantially smaller floral tubes, experience on average 13\% less
   Mompha florivory than do hawkmoth- pollinated flowers. The positive
   association between tube length and Mompha damage is evident even within

   differentiation at microevolutionary scales. Given that there are at

Title = {{Evolution of pollination systems involving edible trichomes in orchids}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Most flowering plants need biotic vectors for pollen transfer.
   Consequently, the emergence and maintenance of floral attributes are
   driven by selection generated by pollinators. As a result of such
   selective pressures, new strategies related to pollinator attraction and
   rewards can arise. In addition to nectar and pollen, pollinators exploit
   floral perfumes, wax, resins, edible oils and edible trichomes. Edible
   trichomes have been recorded in several plant families, but most
   frequently in orchids. However, these food hairs have not been recorded
   previously among members of the Neotropical Catasetinae. Using studies
   of flower morphology and anatomy, analyses of rewards, and observation
   of pollinators and pollination mechanism, this study aims to ascertain
   the pollination biology of Cyanaeorchis, an unusual genus currently
   recognized within Catasetinae, for which pollinators and rewards are
   unknown. We also investigate the evolution of floral rewards among the
   Catasetinae, and the evolution of edible trichomes in orchids more
   generally. Cyanaeorchis arundinae produces food hairs as a reward and is
   pollinated by bees that collect this food material. No other Catasetinae
   offer edible trichomes as a reward to pollinators. Grobya produces
   edible oil as a resource, while Galeandra is pollinated by nectar
   deception. The clade containing the genera Dressleria, Mormodes,
   Cycnoches, Clowesia and Catasetum offers volatile compounds ('perfumes')
   as a non-nutritive reward to male euglossine bees. Our data indicate
   that perfume rewards originated only once in the Catasetinae. Our
   analyses also suggest that edible trichomes evolved independently five
   times in Orchidaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Fire affects diversity and structure of flower-visitor communities. We
   explored the effect of fire history on the diversity patterns and
   structure of the flower-visitor guilds (bees, beetles, flies, sawflies,
   and wasps), across a post-fire regeneration sequence of pine forests in
   Rhodes Island, Greece. Fire history was defined by fire frequency and
   post-fire age of sites. We did not find significant differences in
   species richness and abundance per guild between fire-history regimes
   except for the abundance of flies, sawflies and the entire
   flower-visitor community. Fire strongly affected the community structure
   of bees, beetles, and sawflies. Some of the most abundant and common
   species responded significantly to fire in terms of abundance; yet, we
   observed no significant variation in the abundance of the common species
   of bees, the most prominent pollinator group, implying that provision of
   pollination services may not be considerably affected by fire.
   Long-unburnt sites displayed higher heterogeneity in species composition
   compared to recently-burnt sites (either burnt once or twice). This
   pattern deviated significantly from null expectations when analyzing the
   abundance-based metric of beta-diversity and was obscure in the case of
   the presence/absence-based metric, indicating that fire affected mainly
   the spatial distribution of individuals, i.e. the main change is not due

   the species composition in recently-burnt sites (burnt once in 2008)
   were more similar than in twice-burnt sites (including areas burnt once

   (Gillies ex Salm-Dyck) Walp., an endemic cactus of Argentina, whose
   floral traits would suggest that it is pollinated by moths. The floral
   lifespan and flower availability throughout the reproductive period were
   evaluated. Field experiments were carried out to study the reproductive
   system and the identity and effectiveness of floral visitors. Echinopsis
   leucantha flowers had a nocturnal anthesis time that extended into the

   included moths, bees, and passerine birds. However, diurnal visitors
   were more effective as pollinators than nocturnal ones. The flowers of
   E. leucantha were phenotypically specialized (sphingophily); however,
   the pollination system was functionally and ecologically generalized.
   The results confirm that generalized pollination systems are widespread

Abstract = {{Amount of semi-natural habitats (permanent grasslands, woodlands and
   hedgerows) and their level of fragmentation are among the main
   determinants of wild bee diversity in agricultural landscapes. However,
   their impact on the distribution of bee ecological traits has received
   little attention. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes in
   the distribution of bee ecological traits along gradients of habitat
   amount and fragmentation were due to a direct effect of landscape
   context on multiple traits ('response traits') or to a correlation of
   response traits with other ecological traits not involved in the
   response of bee species to landscape context. In two study regions in
   southwest France and southeast Australia, we used a RLQ analysis
   (three-table ordination method) to link bee traits with habitat amount
   and fragment isolation measured at the landscape scale. We found that
   bee ecological traits shifted at the community-level in association with
   landscape gradients, whereas species-level associations among bee traits
   and phylogenetic clustering in bee communities were of only minor
   importance in determining such shifts. We found that traits such as body
   size and nest location were closely linked to habitat amount and
   fragmentation. We also observed regionally-specific relationships among
   ecological traits, suggesting that the regional species pool can play an
   important role in determining the response of bee communities to habitat
   amount and fragmentation. Our findings suggest that improved knowledge

Abstract = {{1. Specialization in plant-pollinator relationships is a core concept in
   discussions of plant evolution and ecology; it is central to our
   thinking, not just about the ecology of plant-pollinator interactions
   and pollinator services, but also about reproductive isolation,
   speciation, extinction and assembly of communities. However, as reviewed
   here, the concept ` plant-pollinator specialization' has multiple
   definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion
   in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive
   framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding.
   2. This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and
   usage of plant-pollinator specialization, including distinguishing
   between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or
   resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with
   increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having
   specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three
   concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in
   interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and
   biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk.
   3. In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the
   relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral
   evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several
   implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of
   pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several bee species are experiencing significant population declines. As
   bees exclusively rely on pollen for development and survival, such
   declines could be partly related to changes in their host plant
   abundance and quality. Here, we investigate whether generalist bumblebee
   species, with stable population trends over the past years, adapted
   their diets in response to changes in the distribution and chemical
   quality of their pollen resources. We selected five common species of
   bumblebee in NW Europe for which we had a precise description of their
   pollen diet through two time periods ('prior to 1950' and `2004-2005').
   For each species, we assessed whether the shift in their pollen diet was
   related with the changes in the suitable area of their pollen resources.
   Concurrently, we evaluated whether the chemical composition of pollen
   resources changed over time and experimentally tested the impact of new
   major pollen species on the development of B. terrestris microcolonies.
   Only one species (i.e. B. lapidarius) significantly included more pollen
   from resources whose suitable area expanded. This opportunist pattern
   could partly explain the expansion of B. lapidarius in Europe. Regarding
   the temporal variation in the chemical composition of the pollen diet,
   total and essential amino acid contents did not differ significantly
   between the two time periods while we found significant differences
   among plant species. This result is driven by the great diversity of
   resources used by bumblebee species in both periods. Our bioassay
   revealed that the shift to new major pollen resources allowed
   microcolonies to develop, bringing new evidence on the opportunist
   feature of bumblebee in their diets. Overall, this study shows that the
   response to pollen resource drift varies among closely related
   pollinators, and a species-rich plant community ensures generalist
   species to select a nutrient-rich pollen diet.}},

   polypeptides and sterols) of the pollen of the ericaceous and dominant
   non-ericaceous species present in pollen loads. No relationship was
   detected between the abundance of a particular plant species in
   bumblebee loads and its pollen composition.
   4. The successive flowering periods and the nutritional quality of
   pollen of ericaceous species offer valuable resources for bumblebees.
   Ericaceous species represent a large part of bumblebee diets in
   heathlands, especially in early spring and late summer when the
   diversity of other flowering species was low.
   5. Bumblebee pollen loads also contained non-ericaceous flowering
   species that grow outside heathlands. Thus, land planning must
   incorporate conservation strategies for the different elements of the
   landscape matrix, including heathlands, peatlands, meadows and margins.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Pages = {{4-12}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Sempervivum funckii var. aqualiense, considered
   the only endemic vascular plant taxon of Belgium still existing in the
   wild, is threatened by urban development. There is a need for proposing
   appropriate in situ or ex situ conservation strategies through a precise
   evaluation of population demographic and genetic characteristics.
   Methods - We investigated demographic dynamics for six years (rosette
   density, floral production, reproductive success, seed germination and
   seedling recruitment), pollination (visiting insects and potential
   pollinators) and genetic diversity using IS SR markers of the unique
   population of S. funckii var. aqualiense.
   Key results - Visiting insects and potential pollinators, especially
   common and generalist pollen foraging bees, are abundant in the
   population of S. funckii var. aqualiense and the plant seems highly
   attractive. Pollination limitation does not represent a conservation
   issue. Despite a good floral production in most years (250-1,558
   flowering ramets, comprising 4-36 flowers), viable seed production and
   germination represent very rare events (0.05\% viable seeds and 1
   seedling) because of meiosis abnormalities related to the hybrid origin
   of the taxon. Recruitment by clonal propagation (vegetative rosettes)
   has been detected. Genetic diversity is very low (H = 0.0148), and may
   have originated from somatic mutations, related to extensive vegetative
   propagation, but is also compatible with relictual segregating sexual
   reproduction.
   Conclusions - The most cost-effective method for establishing new
   populations is the transplantation of rosettes. Given the low viable
   seed production, creating an ex situ seed bank requires collecting seeds
   for many nonconsecutive years. Conserving the rare genotypes can be done
   by preserving seeds and as many rosettes as possible. The preservation
   of the only existing population in its entirety appears to be the best
   option for long-term sustainable conservation of S. funckii var.
   aqualiense, and any partial destruction of the population should be
   avoided.}},

Abstract = {{The potato Solanum tuberosum is one of the most important products
   worldwide and is cultivated under different production systems. Its
   greatest diversity is concentrated in the South American Andes, where it
   originated; however, little is known about native pollen vectors that

   multiplication at the commercial level is carried out through its
   tubers. In order to understand the effects that this type of
   agro-ecosystem may have on the diversity of pollen vectors, particularly
   bees, an inventory was raised in three types of production systems of
   the department of Antioquia: monoculture, association with other
   cultivated species, and association with patches of natural vegetation
   or forests, which were surveyed in transects located within the crops,
   on the edges and in its matrix. In this work, the difference between
   transects, plots, and production systems was recorded. The importance of
   the patch conservation of natural vegetation and the maintenance of the
   vegetal diversity around the crops for the preservation of wild bees was
   demonstrated in different production systems. Finally, it was concluded
   that the design of the agro-ecosystem plays an important role in the bee

Abstract = {{The contribution of a bee plant species to honey production depends on
   the plant's nectar secretion quality and quantity, which is mainly
   governed by biotic and abiotic factors. The aim of the current study,
   was to investigate the nectar secretion dynamics and honey production
   potential of 14 major bee plant species of the target area. We examined
   the quantity and dynamics of nectar sugar per flower five times a day
   using a nectar sugar washing technique and direct measuring of nectar
   with calibrated capillary tubes. The average nectar sugar amount of the
   species varied from 0.41 mg/flower to 7.7 mg/flower (P < 0.0001). The
   honey sugar per flower was used to extrapolate the honey production
   potential per plant and per hectare of land. Accordingly the honey
   production potential of the species observed to vary from 14 kg/hectare
   in Otostegia fruticosa to 829 kg/hectare in Ziziphus spina-christi. The
   nectar secretion dynamics of the species generally showed an increasing
   trend early in the morning, peaking toward midday, followed by a decline
   but different species observed to have different peak nectar secretion
   times. Generally, the tree species secreted more nectar sugar/flower
   than the herbs. The nectar secretion amount of the species was
   positively correlated with the ambient temperature, indicating the
   adaptation of the species to hot climatic conditions. However, different
   species were observed to have a different optimum temperature for peak
   nectar secretion. Despite the limited rainfall and high temperature of
   the area, many plants were found to have good potential for honey
   production. The monetary value of honey per hectare of the studied
   honeybee plant species can be of equal or greater than the per-hectare
   monetary value of some cultivated crops that require numerous inputs. In
   addition, the information generated is believed to be useful in apiary
   site selection and to estimate the honey bee colony carrying capacity of
   an area. (C) 2016 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Evidence for passerine bird pollination in Rhododendron species}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{When insect activity is limited at low temperature, birds may be
   comparatively more important pollinators than insects for flowering
   plants. It has been thought that many large-flowered Rhododendron
   species are pollinated by local birds in the Himalayan regions because
   most of these species flower in spring at high elevation with cool
   atmospheric temperature. However, experimental evidence for the role of
   bird pollination in this hyper-diverse genus remains scarce. To examine
   the role of birds and insects in pollination, we observed floral
   visitors to 15 Rhododendron species with different floral sizes and
   abundant flowering individuals in the eastern Himalayas, Southwest
   China. To examine the role of birds and insects in female reproductive
   success in each species, cages were used to exclude birds but not
   insects from visiting flowers and net bags were used to exclude all
   floral visitors. Inflorescences where visitation was excluded did not
   produce fruits in any of the Rhododendron species, indicating that
   sexual reproduction in these species depended on pollinator visitation.
   Bird visits were generally less frequent than bee visits in the studied
   species. However, in the nine species on which bird visitors were
   observed, fruit and/or seed set were greatly reduced in inflorescences
   caged to exclude birds but not bees, compared to open-pollinated
   inflorescences. In the other six species on which bird visitation was
   not observed, fruit and seed set did not differ significantly between
   caged and open inflorescences except in one species (R. wardii).
   Manipulations to achieve selective exclusion of visitors demonstrated
   that birds could be effective pollinators for 10 out of 15 studied
   Rhododendron species in the eastern Himalayas. Floral characteristics of
   these Rhododendron species and weather conditions might favour the
   evolution of bird pollination systems in the East Himalayas.}},

Abstract = {{Corynura Spinola, Callistochlora Michener and Halictillus Moure are the
   only taxa of Augochlorini endemic to southern South America. They are
   phylogenetically close, comprising a clade sister to all other
   augochlorines, which are mainly distributed in tropical America.
   Corynura and Callistochlora are common bees in Chile and the Argentinean
   Patagonia, while Halictillus inhabits also central Argentina and
   southern Brazil. A phylogenetic parsimony analysis of 93 morphological
   characters coded for 25 species supports the monophyly of each of the
   three taxa, of the clade formed by them, and their sister relationship
   to the remaining Augochlorini genera. Our analyses suggest
   Callistochlora as sister to Hallictillus + Corynura. Callistochlora,
   which has been treated as a subgenus of Corynura, is elevated to genus
   level. The study of the gradulus of the sterna, a structure usually
   ignored in morphological analysis, helped in the resolution of the
   group. A revision of Corynura is presented. We recognize 19 valid
   species, of which five are described as new: C. callaina sp. n., C.
   challhuacoensis sp. n., C. condita sp. n., C. luisae sp. n., and C.
   nahuelita sp. n. The males of C. apicata Sichel, C. patagonica Cockerell
   and C. spadiciventris Alfken are described for the first time. The
   following are new synonyms: Rhopalictus callicladurus Cockerell syn. n.
   is a junior synonym of C. ampliata (Alfken); Halictus analis Herbst syn.
   n. and C. heterochlora Alfken syn. n. are junior synonyms of C.
   bruchiana (Schrottky); Rhopalictus corinogaster chiloeensis Cockerell
   syn. n. is a junior synonym of C. corinogaster (Spinola); R. chloronotus
   Cockerell syn. n. and R. melanocladus Cockerell syn. n. are junior
   synonyms of C. herbsti (Alfken). Neotypes are designated to stabilize
   the usage of three names: Halictus apicatus Sichel, Halictus bruchianus
   Schrottky, and Corynura gayi Spinola. Lectotypes are designated for six
   names: Halictus (Corynura) atrovirens Herbst, Halictus analis Herbst,
   Halictus (Corynura) herbsti Alfken, Halictus spinolae Friese, Corynura
   lepida Alfken, and Corynura spadiciventris Alfken. Diagnoses, comments

Title = {{Effects of model-mimic frequency on insect visitation and plant
   reproduction in a self-mimicry pollination system}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{The proportion of mimics and models is a key parameter in mimetic
   systems. In monoecious plants with self-mimicry pollination systems, the
   mimic-model ratio is determined by the floral sex ratio. While an equal
   sex ratio (1:1) could provide the perfect balance between pollen donors
   and stigma surfaces able to receive the pollen, an unequal ratio could
   increase pollination by production of a greater number of rewarding,
   model flowers. The aim of the present study is to test the differences
   in visitation frequency and reproductive rates of different mimic and
   model flower arrays in order to assess the efficacy of the mimetic
   system in a Begonia cucullata population. The frequencies of visitors to
   groups of flowers with three distinctive sex ratio arrays (male-biased,
   female-biased and equal ratio) were compared using a Bayesian approach.
   The reproductive outcomes were compared in order to detect advantages of
   particular sex ratios. Low visitation frequency was recorded in all
   arrays. Pollinators showed similar behaviour regardless of sex ratio;
   they tended to avoid female, rewardless flowers. Pollination quality was
   highest in the equal sex ratio array. The current study shows that sex
   ratio plays a critical role in the pollination of B. cucullata and that
   the efficacy of the self-mimicry system appears to be doubtful.
   Visitation frequency may be associated with visual or chemical cues that
   allow pollinators to recognize models and mimics, regardless of their
   frequency in the population.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of Perilla frutescens pollination on the content of seed
   antioxidants were analysed by agronomical and pollination trials,
   comparing seeds produced from bagged plants in 2013 (A) to prevent
   access to pollinating insects, and seeds from open-pollinated plants in
   2013 (B) and 2015 (C). The seeds of open-pollinated plants were
   significantly more numerous and heavier than those of self-pollinated
   plants. H-1 NMR seed analysis showed a higher presence of phenolic
   compounds in open-pollinated seeds, mainly rosmarinic acid and
   flavonoids, apigenin and luteolin. Flavonoids were present in the
   glucosylated form in seeds (A) and (C), and in the aglycone form in
   seeds from (B) plants. Saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (palmitic,
   linoleic and linolenic) were more abundant in seeds from self-pollinated
   flowers. Pollination performed almost exclusively by the honeybee
   notably increased the antioxidant content in perilla seeds and gave rise
   to a reduction in the fatty acid content.

Abstract = {{In Triumfetta rhomboidea, the floral characteristics such as showy

Abstract = {{The flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is a recently developed
   meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by the pollination process of flowers.
   Similar to other meta-heuristic algorithms, it encounters two probable

   in solving challenging complex real world problems. Similar to the chaos
   in actual flower pollination process, this paper proposes new FPAs that
   employ chaotic maps for adjustment of parameters with the aim to improve
   the convergence rate and prevent the FPAs to get trapped on local
   optima. This is achieved by employing chaotic number generators every
   time, a random number is needed by the classical FPA. Two new chaotic
   FPAs have been proposed and various test problems are used for their
   performance evaluation. To check the effectiveness of the proposed
   algorithms, they are tested on various benchmark functions and
   engineering design problems with different characteristics having real

   reed nests. Highest prevalence of parasitization was found in the
   innermost portion of the tunnel, where Osmia cocoons usually contains
   females. Additional damage is cocoon crashing, caused by A. anthrax
   armed pupae as it forces its way out of the tunnel. Both O. cornuta

Abstract = {{Background: The arrangement of flowers on inflorescences is important
   for determining the movement of pollinators within the inflorescence
   and, consequently, the overall mating success and fruit set of a plant.
   Aims: Spiranthes spiralis is an orchid that has a spiralled
   inflorescence. The species has two chiral forms that show opposite
   coiling directions (clockwise and anti-clockwise). We tested if this
   arrangement of inflorescence influences pollinator attraction and
   behaviour.
   Methods: We surveyed two natural populations, analysed the reproductive
   compatibility of the two morphs and estimated pollination success in
   natural and experimental populations.
   Results: We found that the two morphs were not isolated by pre- or
   post-mating barriers, occurred with a similar proportion in natural
   populations and showed similar levels of pollination success both in
   natural and artificial populations. However, we found a different
   pattern of pollination success along the inflorescences. In the two
   morphs, lower flowers experienced a higher pollination rate and this
   rate decreased along the inflorescence faster in anti-clockwise than in
   clockwise individuals.
   Conclusions: This finding suggests that pollinators visit the flowers
   sequentially from the lower part of the inflorescences and leave the
   anti-clockwise individuals more rapidly than the clockwise ones.
   However, this pollinator behaviour is not detrimental for the
   pollination success of either of the two morphs.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape changes can lead to bee species loss, what impairs proper
   landscape level pollination processes, impacting both nature
   conservation and human welfare. Although landscape heterogeneity can
   rescue bee communities from collapsing, these insects seem sensitive to
   reduced functional connectivity, hindering pollen transfer among plants.
   Our objective was to verify which of these two factors, landscape
   heterogeneity or functional connectivity, can better explain variations
   of bee abundance and richness in a fragmented Atlantic Forest region. We
   sampled flower-visiting bees in 12 landscapes with varying heterogeneity
   and functional connectivity measured using a Functional Ecological
   Corridors framework. Both richness and abundance were affected by
   landscape factors, reaching its highest levels at intermediate levels of
   functional connectivity in highly heterogeneous landscapes, indicating
   the existence of strong regime shifts in the system. In low-forested
   landscapes, conservation actions for pollinating bees should focus on
   implementing diversified environments with high quality which are
   interspersed among each other and with native vegetation. (C) 2017

Title = {{Pollination success following loss of a frequent pollinator: the role of
   compensatory visitation by other effective pollinators}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator abundance is declining worldwide and may lower the quantity
   and quality of pollination services to flowering plant populations. Loss
   of an important pollinator is often assumed to reduce the amount of
   pollen received by stigmas of a focal species (pollination success), yet
   this assumption has rarely been tested experimentally. The magnitude of
   the effect, if any, may depend on the relative efficiency of the
   remaining pollinators, and on whether the loss of one pollinator leads
   to changes in visitation patterns by other pollinators. To explore how a
   change in pollinator composition influences pollination of Asclepias
   verticillata, we excluded bumble bees from plots in large and small
   populations of this milkweed species. We then quantified pollinator
   visitation rates, pollen export and pollen receipt for control plots and
   for plots where bumble bees were experimentally excluded. We found that
   exclusion of bumble bees did not reduce pollen receipt by A.
   verticillata flowers. Visitation by Polistes wasps increased markedly
   following bumble bee exclusion, both in small populations (186\%
   increase) and in large populations (400\% increase). Because Polistes
   wasps were as efficient as bumble bees at pollen transfer, increased
   wasp visitation offset lost bumble bee pollination services. Thus, loss
   of a frequent pollinator will not necessarily lead to a decline in
   pollination success. When pollinator loss is followed by a shift in the
   composition and abundance of remaining pollinators, pollination success
   will depend on the net change in the quantity and quality of pollination
   services.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL HISTORY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{The genus Leucospis Fabricius is comprised of parasitoid wasps
   relatively uncommon in nature. Their immature stages develop on aculeate
   Hymenoptera, in particular solitary bees, but hosts are known for only
   around 25 Leucospis species (about 20\% of 115-120 world species), so
   the true relationship of this family with bees is largely unknown. Here
   we report on individuals of five species of Leucospis wasps which
   emerged from nests of different bee and wasp species during distinct
   sampling periods during a trap-nesting programme, in two contrasting
   areas: agro-ecosystems and natural habitats in the Pampean region. Some
   of these nests were parasitised by L. cayennensis Westwood, L. coxalis
   Kirby, L. egaia Walker, L. pulchriceps Cameron and L. signifera Boucek.
   Our results expand the available information of host species for L.
   cayennensis, L. coxalis, L. egaia and L. pulchriceps and represent the
   first record of hosts associated with L. signifera. The hosts were only
   bee species of the genera Centris, Tetrapedia (family Apidae) and
   Megachile (Megachilidae). These species were more abundant in the
   natural reserve than in agro-ecosystems, suggesting that anthropogenic
   activities could negatively affect their populations. Most nests were
   attacked in one (43.7\%) or two (40.7\%) cells, but the remaining nests
   (16.5\%) had more (up to seven cells). However, the position of the
   attacked cells was variable, suggesting that females of Leucospis
   species oviposit in recently built cells, and that the hatching of
   larvae is delayed, or that the first larval stage waits until the host
   larva reaches a sufficient size to attack.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are important pollinators of wild plants and crops. The
   identity of stingless bee species in Africa has not been fully
   documented. The present study explored the utility of morphometrics and
   DNA barcoding for identification of African stingless bee populations,

   variation within species. Stingless bee samples were collected from
   three ecological zones, namely Kakamega Forest, Mwingi and
   Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, which are geographically distant and cover high,
   medium and low altitudes, respectively. Forewing and hind leg
   morphometric characters were measured to determine the extent of
   morphological variation between the populations. DNA barcodes were
   generated from the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase I (COI) gene.
   Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the morphometric measurements
   separated the bee samples into three clusters: (1) Meliponula bocandei;
   (2) Meliponula lendliana + Plebeina hildebrandti; (3) Dactylurina
   schmidti + Meliponula ferruginea black + Meliponula ferruginea reddish
   brown, but Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) separated all the species
   except the two morphospecies (M. ferruginea reddish brown and black).
   The analysis of the COI sequences showed that DNA barcoding can be used
   to identify all the species studied and revealed remarkable genetic
   distance (7.3\%) between the two M. ferruginea morphs. This is the first
   genetic evidence that M. ferruginea black and M. ferruginea reddish

Abstract = {{Plant populations that are spatially isolated may experience genetic
   isolation if gene flow via pollination or seed dispersal is limited. The
   high genetic differentiation among populations of Encholirium horridum
   L.B.Sm. indicates low gene flow for this species that occurs exclusively
   on granitic inselbergs in South-east Brazil. Here we describe
   reproductive and pollination attributes of this bromeliad assessing how
   they influence the current degree of genetic isolation among
   populations. The mating system, estimated using five microsatellites
   markers, indicated allogamy and low pollen pool structure. The breeding
   system assessed by hand-pollination treatments supported partial
   self-incompatibility combined with inbreeding depression. Flowers of E.
   horridum are bell-shaped with crepuscular/nocturnal anthesis, and high
   nectar production, suggesting chiropterophily. Its pollination system
   was actually generalist but bats and hummingbirds were more frequent
   than hawkmoths and crepuscular bees. The high local abundance and large
   floral display per individual plant contributed to short distance
   pattern of pollen movement by pollinators. At the intra-population
   level, this pollinator foraging pattern, with inbreeding depression,
   promotes low seed viability and individual variations on outcrossing
   rate. At the inter-population level, those features led to low gene
   flow. Overall, heterozygosity, maintained by self-incompatibility and
   inbreeding depression, and pollination by vertebrates described here for
   E. horridum are consistent with other attributes that are predicted for
   inselberg plants by the OCBIL theory, such as reduced dispersability and
   genetic isolation among populations. Those characteristics contribute to
   the isolation of E. horridum populations and heighten the importance of
   population-based conservation strategies for taxa that occur exclusively
   in those naturally fragmented inselbergs.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{139-150}},
Abstract = {{Background - There is a growing appreciation that the evolution of
   floral traits is shaped by selection not only from pollinators, but also
   factors like abiotic stress, florivory, and disease. Many such pressures
   impose counter-selection for smaller, less attractive flowers. In
   self-incompatible taxa, floral investment in attraction is required to
   ensure cross-pollination, setting up a potential energetic trade-off
   with investment in fecundity through pollen and seeds.
   Methods - This study assesses ecological and evolutionary causes of
   variation in floral morphology across the diverse genus Helianthus
   (Asteraceae), focusing on floral size, colour, water content, and
   relative investment in attractive but sterile ray florets versus
   non-showy but fertile disc florets.
   Key results - All floral traits were found to be highly evolutionarily
   labile, and the trade-off in relative investment between ray and disc
   florets was found to evolve independently of floral size. Both floral
   size and disc water content were strongly correlated with source site
   climate and soil characteristics, with larger heads and higher water
   content repeatedly evolving in more fertile and drier habitats
   consistent with aspects of the resource-cost and enemy-escape hypotheses
   of floral trait evolution, respectively. The evolution of disc colour
   and relative ray-disc investment was not explained by life history,
   flowering period, or source site environmental characteristics,
   suggesting that the evolution of these traits may instead be driven by
   other selective pressures, including perhaps pollinators.
   Conclusions - Together the results of this study suggest that the
   macroevolution of sunflower floral architecture is likely driven by
   selective pressures from multiple biotic and abiotic factors, with
   habitat environmental conditions influencing some but not all aspects of
   floral morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Encyclia is a neotropical orchid genus distributed from Florida to South
   Brazil and comprises similar to 120 taxa, including Encyclia mapuerae
   (Huber) Brade \& Pabst. Besides its diversity and wide distribution,
   conclusive data on pollinators and reproductive biology of this orchid
   genus is scarce. Furthermore, nothing is known about the production of
   floral reward in Encyclia but the pollinators of their species are
   assumed to be attracted through food deception. Based on data on
   phenology, floral morpho-anatomy, histochemistry, pollinators,
   pollination mechanisms, and breeding system, the reproductive biology of
   E. mapuerae was studied in a nature reserve at Central Amazonia, Brazil.
   The flowers of E. mapuerae show longitudinal lines on the labellum that
   act as a nectar guide. The secretory epidermis has papillae whose cells
   are covered by an ornamented cuticle. The subtended tissue is composed
   of a tree-layered collenchyma. The flowers attract several species of
   Hymenoptera. However, a single species of Centris was recorded as
   pollinator. The bees collect the nectar produced inside the cuniculus.
   When the bees leave the flower the pollinarium is attached to their
   heads. Encyclia mapuerae is self-compatible and pollinator-dependent.
   The reproductive success in natural conditions is low because of
   deficient pollen transference due to the scarcity of pollinators. As far
   we know this is the first study that reports and production of floral
   reward in Encyclia. This discovery provides new insights on the function
   of the cuniculus in Laeliinae, and sheds light on the evolution of
   floral rewards and pollination mechanisms within this diverse group of
   Neotropical orchids.}},

Abstract = {{The study of nesting biology is an important biological aspect for both

   aim of this study was to describe and analyse the nesting biology and
   dynamic of an aggregation of the cavity-nesting bee species Centris
   analis during one generation. Twenty-eight females were marked and had
   their nesting activities documented, 64 nests were sampled, and 113
   individuals emerged from these nests. An asymmetry in the sex allocation
   was observed for this species, and the sex ratio was male-biased in the
   first nests built. Nonetheless, considering an individual-level
   perspective, the females showed different strategies, with some of them
   producing more daughters, other females producing more sons, and still
   others producing an equal proportion. The productivity per female was
   low compared to that of other solitary bee species, and the females
   displayed an aggressive usurpation behaviour against conspecific females
   and performed an intraspecific parasitism. As the substrate used to nest
   is a limiting factor for this species, the usurpation behaviour may be
   an important strategy that could increase the chance of nesting. A few
   males used the nesting site as a resting place and the fidelity observed
   to this locale was high. This study provides new information about the
   natural history of this bee species, which is an important pollinator of
   both crops and native plant species.}},

   management tools and practices to support O. lignaria as an alternative
   pollinator. Establishing O. lignaria pollination as a sustainable
   industry requires careful consideration of both bee and orchard
   management. Here, we test the effect of artificial nest box distribution
   on in-orchard propagation of O. lignaria in Utah commercial tart cherry
   orchards. Two nest box distributions were compared across three paired,
   1.2-ha plots. One distribution, traditionally employed by O. lignaria
   consultants, included a centrally located tote for mass-nesting with
   smaller, surrounding `satellite' nest boxes at orchard margins. The
   other distribution was composed of smaller, more equally distributed
   nest boxes throughout the 1.2-ha plots. Significantly higher propagation
   of O. lignaria was observed in the latter nest box distribution,
   although all treatments resulted in bee return exceeding the number of
   bees initially released. These findings provide support for the use of
   O. lignaria in tart cherry orchards, and demonstrate how simple changes
   to bee set-up and management can influence propagation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Many bumblebee (Bombus) species are undergoing a strong decline in
   Europe due to, amongst other things, a decrease of food resources. While
   leguminous plants (Fabaceae) are considered to be one of the main pollen
   sources of bumblebees, thistles (Asteraceae tribe Cardueae) have been
   suggested to be important for male diet. Yet, several European countries
   apply strict regulations against thistles since they are considered to
   be one of the principal weeds in agricultural landscapes. Such
   regulations could impact bumblebee conservation through disruption of
   male diet and ecology. Here, we assess the male-depending importance of
   thistles for bumblebee species based on field observations across
   countries where a legal regulation against thistles is in effect. We
   ultimately aim to evaluate the potential consequences of these
   regulations on bumblebee conservation. Our results confirm that most
   floral visit observations of males occur on thistles (mainly Cirsium
   spp. and Carduus spp.) and some species are almost exclusively observed
   on them. Thistle removal is thus most likely a threat for bumblebees.
   Therefore, we advocate repealing the thistle removal acts to make way
   for alternative thistle regulations which reconcile biodiversity
   conservation and agricultural requirements.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{In the summer of 2010, two male specimens of the neotropical orchid bee
   genus Eufriesea Cockerell were collected in the Guadalupe Mountains of
   western Texas and southeastern New Mexico, USA. We tentatively
   identified them as E. coerulescens (Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau) because
   of the uncertainty surrounding the limits of this taxon and hypothesized
   that they were members of a persistent bee population, rather than
   long-distance transient vagrants. The goals of this paper are to clarify
   the identity of these specimens, assess the species limits of E.
   coerulescens, and to evaluate suitability of habitats in the USA for
   this adventive species. Herein, we revise the species in the
   coerulescens group using morphological features of both sexes and
   confirm that the specimens of Eufriesea from the USA are E.
   coerulescens. We recognize the following six species in the coerulescens
   group: E. coerulescens, E. micheneri Ayala \& Engel, E. simillima (Moure
   \& Michener), which is reinstated from synonym with E. coerulescens, and
   three new species from Mexico (E. barthelli Gonzalez \& Griswold, sp.
   n., E. engeli Gonzalez \& Griswold, sp. n., and E. oliveri Gonzalez \&
   Griswold, sp. n.). To facilitate the identification of these taxa, we
   present a fully illustrated account of the species, comparative
   diagnoses, descriptions, and an updated key to all Mexican species of
   Eufriesea. Our analyses using species distribution modelling show an
   absence of suitable habitat for E. coerulescens in western Texas and
   southeastern New Mexico, thus favoring the long-distance dispersal
   hypothesis. The analyses also suggest high suitability of habitats
   across the Caribbean and some areas in Florida, as well as in other
   regions in Mexico and Central America. We discuss the implications of
   these results and compare them with the predicted distribution available
   for the other two known adventive orchid bee species in the USA.}},

Pages = {{288-299}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has led to a reduction in semi-natural
   areas and in the abundance of wild flowering plants, reducing the
   availability of floral resources upon which pollinating insects depend.
   This is widely accepted as one of the major drivers of pollinator
   declines, but few studies have directly addressed the effects of dietary
   restrictions on pollinator fitness. Here, we investigated the effects of
   restricting pollen and nectar supply on bumble bee (Bombus terrestris)
   colony growth, adult size and number. Colonies required up to 6 g
   pollen/1 g protein and 50 g sugar to establish a colony of 5 workers,
   and consumed in excess of 176 g pollen/31 g protein and 1,186 g sugar in
   their lifetime. Regardless of restrictions on pollen or nectar
   availability, colonies consumed a ratio of 1 g protein to similar to 43
   g sugar, though free-flying colonies require proportionally more sugar
   to fuel foraging. Food-limited colonies from an early stage grew little
   with anything less than ad-lib nectar, while more-established colonies
   increased in weight even with low levels of nectar suggesting a shortage
   of resources in early spring may be most damaging to bumble bee
   colonies. Dietary restriction reduced the number of reproductives
   produced, but had variable effects on the size of workers and males.
   Nosema ceranae infection was included as a covariate in analyses and had
   a significant negative effect on colony growth. This study provides a
   base line for the developmental requirements of bumble bee colonies, and
   indicates the effects a resource deficit may have on their development
   and reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Calanthe izuinsularis is a rare, beautiful and fragrant orchid endemic
   to the Izu archipelago. Although it is known that mainland populations
   of closely related Calanthe species are pollinated by medium-to
   large-sized bees, it is likely that C. izuinsularis has been forced to
   alter its floral biology to attract alternative pollinators, as
   large-sized bees are rarely found on the Izu Islands. Indeed, the
   unusual floral characteristics of C. izuinsularis, which produces pale
   flowers that emit a strong and fragrant scent during the night, are
   considered the adaptation to a moth-pollinator syndrome. As expected,
   our time-lapse photography using a digital camera revealed that the
   inflorescences of C. izuinsularis were most frequently visited by
   nocturnal moths such as Noctuidae, Geometridae and Crambidae, which
   accounted for 50\% of all insect visits ( in terms of both the number of
   frames with captured visitors and the number of times visited). However,
   our study could not provide evidence of a pollinator shift towards moths
   because none of the moth species was observed with pollinaria. On the
   other hand, our study found that the pollinaria of C. izuinsularis could
   become attached to the mesothorax of the small-sized sweat bee
   Lasioglossum occidens. Therefore, our study suggests that C.
   izuinsularis is still somewhat dependent on bee pollination, while the
   orchid has changed its floral colouration and scent. The occurrence of
   bee-pollination in C. izuinsularis would provide an explanation for how
   the natural hybridisation between C. aristulifera, C. discolor and C.
   izuinsularis can occur.}},

Abstract = {{This work provides a summary of the typical floral structure of subtribe
   Hyptidinae (Lamiaceae), in which both style and stamens are declinate
   within or near the concave anterior corolla lobe. Cross-pollination is
   facilitated by protandry, acting in conjunction with the explosive
   release of the stamens and pollen. In contrast, we report that in the
   three species of the genus Eplingiella we found individuals with either
   resupinate or non-resupinate flowers, which represents a novel floral
   dimorphism. In these species of Eplingiella, the style occupies a
   position towards the posterior corolla lip and opposes the declinate
   stamens. Thus, in non-resupinate flowers the pollinating bee receives
   pollen on its ventral side and makes contact with the style on its
   dorsal side, whereas in resupinate flowers, the bee receives pollen on
   its dorsal side, and contacts the style on its ventral side. Both floral
   morphs seem to be required to achieve cross-pollination. In the two
   populations studied, each of the two morphs is present and in similar
   proportions, providing a novel means of promoting cross-pollination and
   reducing selfing. The situation in Eplingiella is compared to some other
   examples of floral polymorphism, but appears to be a unique pollination
   strategy, here termed Resupinate Dimorphy.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are important pollinators that use resources from both cropped and
   natural habitats in agroecosystems, and the amount of extant resources
   have proven to be critical in the adoption of parental investment
   decisions. Thus, the mixed effects that resource distribution and the
   organisms' foraging and dispersal movements have on parental decisions
   cannot be adequately evaluated without the use of different spatial
   scales. We assess the effects of the landscape context and the local
   habitat type on the offspring traits of Osmia caerulescens L. Bees were
   obtained from standardized trap-nests established in Mediterranean
   crops. We analyzed the effects that the percentage of semi-natural
   habitats, the local habitat type, and the nest hole diameter have on
   offspring weight, the number of emergent progeny and offspring sex
   ratio. Both landscape and local scale factors affected the offspring
   traits in significant and interactive ways, and landscape-scale effects
   varied depending on local factors. Considering our results and taking
   into account the implications that offspring traits have on the
   population persistence, we stress the need to introduce these parameters
   in future studies. Maintaining agricultural landscape heterogeneity,
   with high crop diversity and the presence of semi-natural habitats is
   essential for the persistence of Osmia caerulescens populations.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees (Apidae, Meliponini) are frequently used as crop
   pollinators in tropical countries. The present study calls attention to
   the thermal limit for the use of these bees as pollinators in commercial
   greenhouses, in which the temperature frequently exceeds that of the
   outside environment. We assessed the thermal biology of Melipona
   subnitida, a stingless bee species that naturally occurs in
   north-eastern Brazil, a region characterized by elevated ambient
   temperatures all year round. The critical (CTN) and lethal limits (LTN)
   for worker bees under long-term temperature exposure (24 h) were 40 and
   44 degrees C respectively when individuals had access to water, or 39
   and 42 degrees C respectively without water. Due to limited active
   colony thermoregulation of this species, the temperatures inside the
   nests were similar to the ambient temperature. In their natural
   environment, nest temperatures never exceeded CTN. In strong contrast,
   inside a greenhouse, the nest temperatures exceeded the critical value
   nearly every day due to the high ambient temperatures in this closed
   environment. As a result, the colonies weakened critically and had to be
   removed from the greenhouse after 14 days. Our study emphasizes the need
   for both thermo-physiological investigations and management strategies
   when planning the use of bees as pollinators for greenhouse crops,
   particularly so in tropical regions, where temperatures in these
   enclosed environments may easily exceed the thermal limits of a species.}},

Title = {{Pulsed light inactivation of the bumble bee trypanosome parasite
   Crithidia bombi}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{The anthropogenic movement of managed bees has led to the introduction
   and global spread of parasites with significant adverse effects on the
   health of both managed and wild species. This constitutes the first
   study to report on the use of high-intensity pulsed light (PL) for the
   inactivation of the trypanosome parasite Crithidia bombi, a pest of wild
   and managed bees. Through initial PL range-finding studies we identified
   a putative effective UV dose of 12.96 mu J/cm(2) for C. bombi treatment.
   This was a result of tests on waterborne protozoan Cryptosporidium
   parvum, and was determined using in vitro combined cell culture-qPCR
   infectivity assays. This irradiance produced ca. >= 4 log(10) oocyst
   reductions of C. parvum. To confirm this dose as appropriate for
   treatment of C. bombi, we used the buff tailed bumble bee (Bombus
   terrestris) as an animal infectivity model. C. bombi was collected from
   the feces of wild B. terrestris queens and used to inoculate 30
   commercially supplied workers (B. terrestris audux) in order to obtain a
   colony-specific C. bombi inoculum. This was used for subsequent tests on
   60 randomly-selected unparasitised workers, which were divided evenly
   and fed either PL-treated or untreated (control) C. bombi inoculant. Of
   the 28 surviving workers fed with pooled C. bombi untreated inoculum, 25
   exhibited infection as confirmed by detection of the parasite in fecal
   samples after 9 days, where the remaining two did not excrete feces.
   Twenty-eight of 30 (93\%) workers fed PL-treated C. bombi at 12.96 mu
   J/cm(2) under similar test conditions were uninfected after the same
   time period (the remaining two workers did not produce feces for
   testing). Thus we demonstrate for the first time, that PL is potentially
   a reliable and efficient technology for the non-thermal inactivation of
   C. bombi for the pollination industry. Although in vivo treatment of
   whole bees with PL is not possible, the use of this technology on
   equipment used in commercial bumble bee breeding facilities could
   potentially reduce infection rates, therefore contributing to making the
   industry more sustainable and less of a risk to wild pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Native pollinators and, particularly bees, are a critical component of
   agricultural systems. Unfortunately, many factors are leading to their

   that aim to restore pollinator habitat in managed landscapes. A widely

   flowering shrubs and forbs along field edges. These habitats usually
   include a variety of species, chosen because they are attractive to
   pollinators and because they flower continuously over those pollinators'
   flight seasons. Because there are many potential plant species with
   different flowering times and pollinator preferences, selecting a subset
   is challenging. Here, we develop a tool that identifies a plant mix that
   optimizes some assessment criteria (e.g., pollinator visitation,
   richness, or phenology). We test our tool by showing that it identifies
   mixes that better satisfy these criteria than ones found using
   conventional expert-driven methods, when applied to a plant-pollinator

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The pollen diet provided by adult bees to their offspring varies
   immensely. While some species collect pollen on several plants
   irrespective of their phylogenetic relatedness (polyleges), others
   collect only on plants within a genus or family (oligoleges). Floral
   scents play a central role in bee-plant interactions. To locate flowers,
   polyleges are assumed to rely on compounds commonly found as floral
   scent constituents, whereas oligoleges rely on unusual compounds to
   recognize host flowers unambiguously. Campanula flowers are visited by
   both polylectic and oligolectic species, and their scent bouquets
   consist of common and unusual (e.g., spiroacetals) volatiles. In a
   comparative approach, we performed electroantennographic analyses to
   investigate the antennal responses of three polyleges and three
   oligoleges to three common volatiles and four spiroacetals. We
   hypothesized that: 1) oligoleges and polyleges should respond similarly
   to common flower volatiles, and 2) Campanula oligoleges should be more
   sensitive to spiroacetals than are polyleges. In corroboration, we found
   that antennal sensitivity to common volatiles was similar among bees
   irrespective of pollen diet, whereas oligoleges of Campanula were more
   sensitive to spiroacetals than polyleges. Newly emerged bees of the
   Campanula oligolege Chelostoma rapunculi rely on spiroacetals for
   recognizing host-flowers, and our results suggest that this might also
   be true for other Campanula oligoleges, since Chelostoma campanularum
   and Hoplitis mitis also were able to perceive these specific volatiles
   at very low concentrations. Together, our results provide interesting
   insights into the significance of olfactory adaptations in oligolectic
   and polylectic bee species.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The species composition within communities is highly dependent on the
   rate of species immigration and whether immigrating species possess the
   functional traits required by the prevailing environmental conditions.
   Once established, random fluctuations in birth and death rates may
   reduce the diversity of ecologically equivalent species if local
   populations are not replenished by immigrating individuals.
   Consequently, three key processes drive community assembly: dispersal
   limitation, ecological filtering, and ecological drift. However,
   disentangling the relative contribution of these processes remains a
   challenge in community ecology. We used a binomial generalized linear
   mixed model to test whether the occurrences of solitary bees within 46
   communities in southeast Norway were driven by (1) dispersal limitation,
   that is, the geographic distance to the nearest site where conspecifics
   occurred; (2) ecological filtering, that is, if forb species richness
   selected for non-Ericaceae-affiliated species; and (3) ecological drift,
   that is, if small, isolated communities were dominated by regionally
   common species. The regression slopes from the model for each potential
   driver of community composition were compared with those expected under
   a null model, in which species were treated as ecologically equivalent.
   Both dispersal limitation and ecological filtering influenced the
   probability of species occurring within communities. The occurrence of
   species decreased with elevation, and this relationship depended on the
   relative commonness of species and their floral preferences. For
   non-Ericaceae-affiliated species, the patterns of occurrence mirrored
   that expected under the null (neutral) model, resulting in the same
   patterns as would be expected under ecological drift. In contrast, the
   response of Ericaceae-affiliated species differed from what would be
   expected from the null model. Our results also indicate that processes
   leading to neutral dynamics in species compositions drive a large part
   of the gradient in species richness in Norwegian bee communities. These
   processes seem related to sampling effects so that large and
   interconnected communities have a higher probability of including
   regionally rare species than small, isolated communities. Our results
   suggest that targeting habitats-where the influence of ecological
   filtering is expected to be greater than that of neutral dynamics-can
   increase the success of habitat management plans aimed at promoting rare
   species.}},

   We also examined the differences in reproductive success between

   save more energy and result in larger bulbs, which produce more flowers

   they could affect bumblebees' foraging behavior and further promote the
   effective output of pollen. In addition, the resource savings could

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{126}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{The containment of genetically modified (GM) pollen is an issue of
   significant concern for many countries. For crops that are
   bee-pollinated, model predictions of outcrossing rates depend on the
   movement hypothesis used for the pollinators. Previous work studying
   pollen spread by honeybees, the most important pollinator worldwide, was
   based on the assumption that honeybee movement can be well approximated
   by Brownian motion. A number of recent studies, however, suggest that
   pollinating insects such as bees perform Levy flights in their search
   for food. Such flight patterns yield much larger rates of spread, and so
   the Brownian motion assumption might significantly underestimate the
   risk associated with GM pollen outcrossing in conventional crops. In
   this work, we propose a mechanistic model for pollen dispersal in which
   the bees performtruncated Levy flights. This assumption leads to a
   fractional- order diffusion model for pollen that can be tuned to model
   motion ranging from pure Brownian to pure Levy. We parametrize our new
   model by taking the same pollen dispersal dataset used in Brownian
   motion modelling studies. By numerically solving the model equations, we
   show that the isolation distances required to keep outcrossing levels
   below a certain threshold are substantially increased by comparison with
   the original predictions, suggesting that isolation distances may need
   to be much larger than originally thought.}},

Abstract = {{Utricularia cornigera and Utricularia nelumbifolia are giant,
   aquatic-epiphytic species of carnivorous bladderwort from southeastern
   Brazil that grow in the central `urns' of bromeliads. Both species have
   large, colourful flowers. The main aim of our study is to ascertain
   whether the prominent floral palate of U. cornigera and U. nelumbifolia
   functions as an unguentarius-i.e. an organ that bears osmophores. Floral
   tissues of both species were investigated using light microscopy,
   scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and
   histochemistry. Floral palates of U. cornigera and U. nelumbifolia
   provide clear visual signals for pollinating insects. In both species,
   the palate possesses diverse micro-morphology, comprising unicellular,
   conical to villiform papillae and multicellular, uniseriate, glandular
   trichomes that frequently display terminal branching. The most
   characteristic ultrastructural feature of these papillae was the
   presence of relatively large, polymorphic plastids (chromoplasts)
   containing many plastoglobuli. Similar plastids are known to occur in
   the fragrance-producing (osmophores) and oil-producing (elaiophores)
   tissues of several orchid species. Thus, these palate papillae may play
   a key role in providing the olfactory stimulus for the attraction of
   insect pollinators. Nectariferous trichomes were observed in the floral
   spurs of both species, and in U. nelumbifolia, free nectar was also
   recorded. The location, micro-morphology, anatomy and ultrastructure of
   the floral palate of the two species investigated may thus indicate that
   the palate functions as an unguentarius. Furthermore, the flowers of
   these taxa, like those of U. reniformis, have features consistent with
   bee pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Insects pollinate 75\% of crops used for human consumption. Over the
   last decade, a substantial reduction in the abundance of pollinating
   insects has been recorded and recognized as a severe matter for food
   supply security. Many of the important food crops destined for human
   consumption are grown in greenhouses. A unique feature of greenhouse
   agriculture is the extensive use of fungicides to curb multiple fungal
   infections. The most widely used pollinating insects in greenhouses are
   commercially reared bumblebees. However, there is no data regarding the
   toxicity of fungicides to bumblebee mitochondria. To fill this gap in
   knowledge, we examined the effects of 16 widely used fungicides on the
   energetics of the flight muscles mitochondria of Bombus terrestris. We
   found that diniconazole and fludioxonil uncoupled the respiration of
   mitochondria; dithianon and difenoconazole inhibited it. By analyzing
   the action of these inhibitors on mitochondrial respiration and
   generation of reactive oxygen species, we concluded that difenoconazole
   inhibited electron transport at the level of Complex I and
   glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Dithianon strongly inhibited
   succinate dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. It also
   strongly inhibited mitochondrial oxidation of NAD-linked substrates or
   glycerol 3-phosphate, but it had no effect on the enzymatic activity of
   Complex I. It may be suggested that dithianon inhibits electron
   transport downstream of Complex I, likely at multiply sites. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Pollination systems and associated floral traits generally differ
   between core and marginal populations of a species. However, such
   differences are rarely examined in plants with a mixed wind-and
   bumblebee-pollination system, and the role of wind pollination during
   range expansion in ambophilous plants remains unclear. We compared
   floral traits and the contributions of bumblebee and wind pollination in
   refugium and marginal populations of the ambophilous plant Aconitum
   gymnandrum. We found that most floral traits differed between the two
   populations, and those traits associated with the shift to wind
   pollination were pronounced in the marginal population. Bumblebee
   visitation rates varied significantly, but were generally low in the
   marginal population. Wind pollination occurred in both populations, and
   the efficiency was lower than that of bumblebee pollination. Two types
   of pollen grains, namely round and fusiform pollen, were transported to
   a stigma by bumblebees and wind, but fusiform pollen contributed to wind
   pollination to a larger degree, especially in the marginal population.
   Our results suggest that wind pollination was enhanced by pollen
   dimorphism in the marginal population of A. gymnandrum, and wind
   pollination may provide reproductive assurance when bumblebee activity
   is unpredictable during range expansion, indicating that ambophily is
   stable in this species and shift in pollination system could be common
   when plants colonize new habitats.}},

Volume = {{178}},

Pages = {{79-84}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Many mechanisms have evolved that increase the
   amount of pollen exported and the number of plants that receive this
   pollen. One such mechanism is pollen presentation, where plants regulate
   the amount of pollen available to a pollinator during a single visit.
   Presenting either a constant proportion or an increasing proportion of
   available pollen should maximize male fitness in most pollinator
   environments. But for constant or increasing pollen presentation
   schedules to evolve, variation in these schedules must have a heritable
   component.Methodology.We measured pollen presentation schedules of
   Lobelia siphilitica by simulating a sequence of 16 bee visits to flowers
   produced by progeny of 10 open-pollinated maternal families. A component
   of the pollen presentation schedule (the amount of pollen remaining in
   the flower at the end of the visitation sequence) was measured for
   plants from all of the families. The complete pollen presentation
   schedule was measured for plants from four of the 10 families.Pivotal
   results.Lobelia siphilitica flowers dispensed a mean of 8.76\% 1.37\% of
   available pollen in the first simulated visit, which is low relative to
   flowers of 31 other species. The amount of available pollen dispensed
   declined across simulated visits. The repeatability, which places an
   upper limit on the heritability, was 0.29 for the amount of pollen
   remaining in the flower after the simulated visits.Conclusions.Lobelia
   siphilitica flowers dispensed a declining proportion of their available
   pollen, which is not consistent with the prediction that constant or
   increasing proportional pollination schedules should evolve. However,
   the repeatability for the amount of pollen remaining in the flower after
   the simulated visits was low relative to the heritability for other
   floral traits in L. siphilitica, suggesting that there could be
   constraints on the evolution of constant or increasing proportional
   pollination schedules in L. siphilitica.}},

   for plants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{188-196}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Mutualisms are only rarely one-to-one interactions: each species
   generally interacts with multiple mutualists. Exploitation is ubiquitous
   in mutualisms, and we would therefore expect that each mutualist
   interacts with multiple exploiters as well. Exploiter species may also
   interact with one another. For example, the action of one exploiter
   species might open the opportunity for exploitation by a second species.
   2. Exploitation is common in many plant-pollinator mutualisms: `primary'
   nectar robbers feed through holes they make in flowers, which can be
   subsequently used by `secondary' nectar robbers unable to create holes
   themselves. The overall effect of nectar robbing on plant fitness is
   often (although not always) negative. No study has separated the effects
   of interacting with primary vs. secondary robbers.
   3. Here, we examine the effects of primary vs. secondary nectar robbing
   on pollinator visitation rate and female fitness in Ipomopsis aggregata.
   Manipulating the type of nectar robbing that flowers experienced, we
   found that secondary nectar robbing inflicted fitness costs to plants
   beyond that inflicted by primary robbing alone. Secondary nectar robbing
   significantly reduced pollen receipt to flowers, as well as fruit and
   seed production. Although the causes are elusive, the effect may be
   attributed to changes in pollinator behaviour at these plants.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings provide evidence that interacting with
   multiple exploiters can lead to increased negative effects for
   mutualists, and highlight the importance of incorporating multiple
   exploiters into the conceptual framework of mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDThe chitin synthesis inhibitor novaluron can suppress pests
   that affect alfalfa seed production, but can negatively affect
   reproductive success in the alfalfa pollinator Megachile rotundata.
   Novaluron is considered to be a reduced-risk insecticide because it
   disrupts ecdysis and is non-lethal to adult insects, but some exposed
   adults have fewer eggs and suppressed egg hatch. For this experiment,
   bees nested in field cages where they were exposed to alfalfa that had
   never been treated with novaluron, alfalfa that had recently been
   sprayed or alfalfa that had been sprayed 1 and 2 weeks earlier.
   RESULTSCompared with the control, greater proportions of dead eggs and
   larvae and lower proportions of live prepupae occurred when bees were
   exposed to recent novaluron sprays as well as one- or two-week old spray
   residues. Two possible routes of residual pesticide exposure were
   revealed. Mother bees become contaminated through ingestion or direct
   contact, or pollen-nectar provisions become contaminated with novaluron
   (1) on or within leaf pieces that surround provisions or (2) transferred
   from mother bees' bodies to provisions.
   CONCLUSIONWe found strong immature mortality effects of novaluron and
   its residues on M. rotundata. Understanding all possible pesticide
   exposure routes for pollinating bees enhances decision-making for
   maintaining bee populations while protecting crops. (c) 2016 Society of

Title = {{Sequential stamen maturation and movement in a protandrous herb:
   mechanisms increasing pollination efficiency and reducing sexual
   interference}},
Journal = {{AOB PLANTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Abstract = {{Successive stamen movement directly controls pollen presentation
   schedules through sequential stamen maturation and changes the extent of
   herkogamy by altering the positions of sexual organs. However, the
   implications of such movements in terms of pollination are not well
   understood. Pollen presentation theory predicts that staggered pollen
   presentation should be favoured when plants are subject to diminishing
   returns on pollen transfer. Herkogamy on the other hand, has been
   interpreted as an adaptive trait that reduces sexual interference in
   hermaphrodite flowers. In this study, we conducted floral manipulations
   to determine the function of successive stamen movement in pollen
   transfer. By artificially manipulating the flowers to present two
   anthers simultaneously in the floral centre, we attempted to investigate
   whether changes in the anther presentation strategy affect pollen
   removal, deposition and the efficiency of pollinators. Compared with the
   natural treatment, the pollen transfer efficiency of halictid bees
   decreased significantly when the flowers were manipulated to present two
   anthers simultaneously. Although the presentation of two anthers
   simultaneously led to a similar pollen removal rate, there was a
   significant reduction in pollen deposition on neighbouring stigmas. To
   evaluate the effect of movement herkogamy on pollen export and
   deposition and seed set, the flowers were manipulated with or without
   the movement of stamen bending out from the floral centre. Pollen export
   decreased significantly when the central anther was moved away from the
   pistil, and pollen deposition and seed set declined significantly when
   the five spent anthers were retained on the pistil. Our study provides
   good support for the pollen presentation theory and provides direct
   experimental evidence that successive stamen movement could increase
   pollen transfer efficiency by sequential stamen maturation. Moreover,
   movement herkogamy promotes pollen export, deposition and seed set, and
   could therefore be regarded as an effective mechanism to reduce
   interference between male and female functions.}},

Abstract = {{We establish a new genus for an unusual species of Peruvian calliopsine
   bees (Panurginae: Calliopsini) that was initially reported in the
   literature as an undescribed species of Spinoliella Ashmead that
   purportedly expanded the range of the latter genus beyond Argentina and
   Chile. Although the new genus superficially resembles Spinoliella, it is
   easily distinguished by a unique combination of characters in both sexes
   but particularly in the male hidden metasomal sterna and genitalia. A
   cladistic analysis of 82 adult external morphological characters
   including all species of Spinoliella, as well as species of the
   remaining genera of Calliopsini, suggests that this group is sister to a
   Glade consisting of Spinoliella and Callonychium Brethes. We describe
   and illustrate Xeranthrena imponticula Gonzalez and Engel, new genus and
   species, from males and females collected in xeric areas along the
   Pacific slopes of the Peruvian Andes. In addition, the phylogenetic
   study suggests two well-defined Glades within Spinoliella and
   corresponding to the previously recognized subgenera, although we do not
   advocate for their reinstatement. We briefly discuss new putative
   synapomorphies for Spinoliella and, building upon prior revisionary

Abstract = {{The middle Eocene Messel and Eckfeld localities are renowned for their
   excellently preserved faunas and diverse floras. Here we describe for
   the first time pollen from insect-pollinated plants found in situ on
   well-preserved ancient bees using light and scanning electron
   microscopy. There have been 140 pollen types reported from Messel and
   162 pollen types from Eckfeld. Here we document 23 pollen types, six
   from Messel and 18 from Eckfeld (one is shared). The taxa reported here
   are all pollinated by insects and mostly not recovered in the previously
   studied dispersed fossil pollen records. Typically, a single or two
   pollen types are found on each fossil bee specimen, the maximum number
   of distinct pollen types on a single individual is five. Only five of
   the 23 pollen types obtained are angiosperms of unknown affinity, the
   remainder cover a broad taxonomic range of angiosperm trees and include
   members of several major clades: monocots (1 pollen type), fabids (7),
   malvids (4), asterids (5) and other core eudicots (1). Seven types each
   can be assigned to individual genera or infrafamilial clades. Since bees
   visit only flowers in the relative vicinity of their habitat, the
   recovered pollen provides a unique insight into the autochthonous
   palaeo-flora. The coexistence of taxa such as Decodon, Elaeocarpus,
   Mortoniodendron and other Tilioideae, Mastixoideae, Olax, Pouteria and
   Nyssa confirms current views that diverse, thermophilic forests thrived
   at the Messel and Eckfeld localities, probably under a warm subtropical,
   fully humid climate. Our study calls for increased attention to pollen
   found in situ on pollen-harvesting insects such as bees, which can
   provide new insights on insect-pollinated plants and complement even
   detailed palaeo-palynological knowledge obtained mostly from pollen of
   wind-pollinated plants in the dispersed pollen record of sediments. In
   the case of Elaeocarpus, Mortoniodendron, Olax and Pouteria the pollen
   collected by the middle Eocene bees represent the earliest unambiguous

Abstract = {{The science of ecosystem service (ES) mapping has become increasingly
   sophisticated over the past 20 years, and examples of successfully
   integrating ES into management decisions at national and sub-national
   scales have begun to emerge. However, increasing model sophistication
   and accuracyand therefore complexity-may trade-off with ease of use and
   applicability to real-world decision-making contexts, so it is vital to
   incorporate the lessons learned from implementation efforts into new
   model development. Using successful implementation efforts for guidance,
   we developed an integrated ES modelling system to quantify several
   ecosystem services: forest timber production and carbon storage, water
   purification, pollination, and biodiversity. The system is designed to
   facilitate uptake of ES information into land-use decisions through
   three principal considerations: (1) using relatively straightforward
   models that can be readily deployed and interpreted without specialized
   expertise; (2) using an agent-based modelling framework to enable the
   incorporation of human decision-making directly within the model; and
   (3) integration among all ES models to simultaneously demonstrate the
   effects of a single land-use decision on multiple ES. We present an
   implementation of the model for a major watershed in Alberta, Canada,
   and highlight the system's capabilities to assess a suite of ES under
   future management decisions, including forestry activities under two
   alternative timber harvest strategies, and through a scenario modelling
   analysis exploring different intensities of hypothetical agricultural
   expansion. By using a modular approach, the modelling system can be
   readily expanded to evaluate additional ecosystem services or management
   questions of interest in order to guide land-use decisions to achieve

   Insights for Mitigation Strategies}},
Journal = {{PLoS One}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Bumblebees (i.e. Bombus genus) are major pollinators of flowering wild
   plants and crops. Although many species are currently in decline, a
   number of them remain stable or are even expanding. One factor
   potentially driving changes in bumblebee distribution is the suitability
   of plant communities. Actually, bees probably have specific nutritional
   requirements that could shape their floral choices and constraint them
   in the current context of global change. However, most studies primarily
   focus on one bumblebee species at a time, making comparative studies
   scarce. Herein we performed comparative bioassays on three bumblebee
   species (i.e. Bombus hypnorum, B. pratorum and B. terrestris) fed on
   three different pollen diets with distinct nutritive content (Cistus,
   Erica and Sa/ixpollen diets). Micro-colony performance was compared
   through different developmental and resource collection parameters for
   understanding the impact of change in pollen diet on different bumblebee
   species. The evidence suggests that B. terrestris is by far the most
   competitive species because of its performance compared to the other
   species, regardless of pollen diet. Our results also highlight a Bombus
   species effect as pollen diet impacts the micro-colonies in different
   ways according to the actual bumblebee species. Such interspecific
   variation in Bombus performance in response to a dietetic change
   underlines the importance of considering different bumblebee species in
   mitigation strategies. Such comparative studies are good advice for
   developing appropriate suites of plant species that can benefit
   threatened species while supporting stable or expanding ones.}},

Title = {{Hairiness: the missing link between pollinators and pollination}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background. Functional traits are the primary biotic component driving
   organism influence on ecosystem functions; in consequence, traits are
   widely used in ecological research. However, most animal trait-based
   studies use easy-to-measure characteristics of species that are at best
   only weakly associated with functions. Animal-mediated pollination is a
   key ecosystem function and is likely to be influenced by pollinator
   traits, but to date no one has identified functional traits that are
   simple to measure and have good predictive power.
   Methods. Here, we show that a simple, easy to measure trait (hairiness)
   can predict pollinator effectiveness with high accuracy. We used a novel
   image analysis method to calculate entropy values for insect body
   surfaces as a measure of hairiness. We evaluated the power of our method
   for predicting pollinator effectiveness by regressing pollinator
   hairiness (entropy) against single visit pollen deposition (SVD) and
   pollen loads on insects We used linear models and AICe model selection
   to determine which body regions were the best predictors of SVD and
   pollen load.
   Results. We found that hairiness can be fused as a robust proxy of SVD.
   The best models for predicting SVD for the flower species Brassica rapa
   and Actinidia deliciosa were hairiness on the face and thorax as
   predictors (R-2 = 0.98 and 0.91 respectively). The best model for
   predicting pollen load for B. rapa was hairiness on the face (R-2 =
   0.81).
   Discussion. We suggest that the match between pollinator body region
   hairiness and plant reproductive structure morphology is a powerful
   predictor of pollinator effectiveness. We show that pollinator hairiness
   is strongly linked to pollination an important ecosystem function and
   provide a rigorous and time-efficient method for measuring hairiness.
   Identifying and accurately measuring key traits that drive ecosystem
   processes is critical as, global change increasingly alters ecological
   communities, and subsequently, ecosystem functions worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions of plants with their pollinators are thought to be a
   driving force in the evolution of angiosperms. Adaptation to a new
   pollinator involves coordinated changes in multiple floral traits
   controlled by multiple genes. Surprisingly, such complex genetic shifts
   have happened numerous times during evolution. Here we report on the
   genetic basis of the changes in one such trait, floral scent emission,
   in the genus Petunia (Solanaceae). The increase in the quantity and
   complexity of the volatiles during the shift from bee to hawkmoth
   pollination was due to de novo expression of the genes encoding benzoic
   acid/salicylic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BSMT) and benzoyl-CoA:
   benzylalcohol/ 2-phenylethanol benzoyltransferase (BPBT) together with
   moderately increased transcript levels for most enzymes of the
   phenylpropanoid/benzenoid pathway. Loss of cinnamate-CoA ligase (CNL)
   function as well as a reduction in the expression of the MYB
   transcription factor ODO1 explain the loss of scent during the
   transition from moth to hummingbird pollination. The CNL gene in the
   hummingbird-adapted species is inactive due to a stop codon, but also
   appears to have undergone further degradation over time. Therefore, we
   propose that loss of scent happened relatively early in the transition
   toward hummingbird pollination, and probably preceded the loss of
   UV-absorbing flavonols. The discovery that CNL is also involved in the
   loss of scent during the transition from out-crossing to selfing in
   Capsella (Brassicaceae) (see the accompanying paper) raises interesting
   questions about the possible causes of deep evolutionary conservation of
   the targets of evolutionary change.}},

Abstract = {{Bee population declines are linked to the reduction of nutritional
   resources due to land-use intensification, yet we know little about the
   specific nutritional needs of many bee species. Pollen provides bees
   with their primary source of protein and lipids, but nutritional quality
   varies widely among host-plant species. Therefore, bees might have
   adapted to assess resource quality and adjust their foraging behavior to
   balance nutrition from multiple food sources. We tested the ability of
   two bumble bee species, Bombus terrestris and Bombus impatiens, to
   regulate protein and lipid intake. We restricted B. terrestris adults to
   single synthetic diets varying in protein: lipid ratios (P: L). The bees
   over-ate protein on low-fat diets and over-ate lipid on high-fat diets
   to reach their targets of lipid and protein, respectively. The bees
   survived best on a 10: 1 P: L diet; the risk of dying increased as a
   function of dietary lipid when bees ate diets with lipid contents
   greater than 5: 1 P: L. Hypothesizing that the P: L intake target of
   adult worker bumble bees was between 25: 1 and 5: 1, we presented
   workers from both species with unbalanced but complementary paired diets
   to determine whether they self-select their diet to reach a specific
   intake target. Bees consumed similar amounts of proteins and lipids in
   each treatment and averaged a 14: 1 P: L for B. terrestris and 12: 1 P:
   L for B. impatiens. These results demonstrate that adult worker bumble
   bees likely select foods that provide them with a specific ratio of P:
   L. These P: L intake targets could affect pollen foraging in the field

Abstract = {{Pollination remains crucial to achieve valuable fruit yield in European
   pear (Pyrus communis) orchards. An innovative approach to improve pollen
   transfer involves the use of pollen dispensers at the hive entrance. Due
   to its commercial availability, Nashi (Pyrus pyrifolia) pollen is
   proposed in pollen dispensers fitted in bumblebee hives for European
   pear tree pollination. Our objectives were (1) to investigate whether
   Nashi pollen is suitable for pollination of European pear and (2) to
   assess the efficiency of pollen dispenser in bumblebee hives. To test
   the compatibility between both species, Nashi pollen were used in
   hand-pollination of two European pear tree cultivars `Conference' and
   `Doyenne du Comice'. The impact of Nashi pollen on the bumblebee
   behaviour was investigated at the hive exit. Nashi pollen was suitable
   for pollination of `Conference' and `Doyenne du Cornice'. `Conference'
   fruits resulting from pollination with Nashi were smaller (53 +/- 1.5
   mm) than those pollinated with `Doyenne du Comice' (60 +/- 1.1 mm) while
   fruit diameter of `Doyenne du Cornice' did not vary with the pollen
   origin (71 +/- 1.3 vs. 69 +/- 1.2 mm). Pollen deposit at the hive
   entrance did not modify bumblebee behaviour. All insects leaving the
   hive were covered with pollen even if their pollen charge decreased by
   53\% 24h after pollen deposit. All together our results suggest that
   Nashi pollen could be used in pollen dispenser for pollination of the
   European pear cultivars `Conference' and `Doyenne du Cornice' if pollen
   dispenser is refilled at least once a day. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Pesticides, including neonicotinoids, typically target pest insects by
   being neurotoxic. Inadvertent exposure to foraging insect pollinators is
   usually sub-lethal, but may affect cognition. One cognitive trait,
   spatial working memory, may be important in avoiding previously-visited
   flowers and other spatial tasks such as navigation. To test this, we
   investigated the effect of acute thiamethoxam exposure on spatial
   working memory in the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, using an adaptation
   of the radial-arm maze (RAM). We first demonstrated that bumblebees use
   spatial working memory to solve the RAM by showing that untreated bees
   performed significantly better than would be expected if choices were
   random or governed by stereotyped visitation rules. We then exposed bees
   to either a high sub-lethal positive control thiamethoxam dose (2.5
   ng(-1) bee), or one of two low doses (0.377 or 0.091 ng(-1)) based on
   estimated field-realistic exposure. The high dose caused bees to make
   more and earlier spatial memory errors and take longer to complete the
   task than unexposed bees. For the low doses, the negative effects were
   smaller but statistically significant, and dependent on bee size. The
   spatial working memory impairment shown here has the potential to harm
   bees exposed to thiamethoxam, through possible impacts on foraging
   efficiency or homing.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1950s, bumblebee (Bombus) species are showing a clear decline
   worldwide. Although many plausible drivers have been hypothesized, the
   cause(s) of this phenomenon remain debated. Here, genetic diversity in
   recent versus historical populations of bumblebee species was
   investigated by selecting four currently restricted and four currently
   widespread species. Specimens from five locations in Belgium were
   genotyped at 16 microsatellite loci, comparing historical specimens
   (1913-1915) with recent ones (2013-2015). Surprisingly, our results
   showed temporal stability of genetic diversity in the restricted
   species. Furthermore, both historical and recent populations of
   restricted species showed a significantly lower genetic diversity than
   found in populations of co-occurring widespread species. The difference
   in genetic diversity between species was thus already present before the
   alleged recent drivers of bumblebee decline could have acted (from the
   1950's). These results suggest that the alleged drivers are not directly
   linked with the genetic variation of currently declining bumblebee
   populations. A future sampling in the entire distribution range of these

Abstract = {{Occupancy modelling has received increasing attention as a tool for
   differentiating between true absence and non-detection in biodiversity
   data. This is thought to be particularly useful when a species of
   interest is spread out over a large area and sampling is constrained. We
   used occupancy modelling to estimate the probability of three
   phylogenetically independent pairs of native-introduced species
   {[}Megachile campanulae (Robertson)-Megachile rotundata (Fab.),
   Megachile pugnata Say-Megachile centuncularis (L.), Osmia pumila
   Cresson-Osmia caerulescens (L.)] (Apoidea: Megachilidae) being present
   when repeated sampling did not always find them. Our study occurred
   along a gradient of urbanization and used nest boxes (bee hotels) set up
   over three consecutive years. Occupancy modelling discovered different
   patterns to those obtained by species detection and abundance-based data
   alone. For example, it predicted that the species that was ranked 4th in
   terms of detection actually had the greatest occupancy among all six
   species. The native M. pugnata had decreased occupancy with increasing
   building footprint and a similar but not significant pattern was found
   for the native O. pumila. Two introduced bees (M. rotundata and M.
   centuncularis), and one native (M. campanulae) had modelled occupancy
   values that increased with increasing urbanization. Occupancy
   probability differed among urban green space types for three of six bee
   species, with values for two native species (M. campanulae and O.
   pumila) being highest in home gardens and that for the exotic O.
   caerulescens being highest in community gardens. The combination of
   occupancy modelling with analysis of habitat variables as an
   augmentation to detection and abundance-based sampling is suggested to

Abstract = {{This case study explores a learning situation in a forest garden in
   Sweden. A forest garden is an edible polyculture landscape with
   different layers of mostly perennial vegetation. The forest garden is
   designed to maximize the yield of useful plants while minimizing the
   input of energy and resources, including human labour. Forest gardens
   may offer learning situations that contextualize interconnectedness and
   relations between organisms as well as situations that are beneficial
   for evaluative development (Keller t, 2002), i.e. the development of
   values, beliefs and moral perspectives in children.
   Twenty-seven seven to eight year old primary school children were
   followed in the first six months of a three year project in which they
   participated in developing a forest garden.
   The aim of the study is to investigate how the children reason with
   respect to different organisms' dependence on and relations to each
   other, themselves included. Specifically: How do the children describe
   their own relationships with other organisms, as well as the
   relationships between other organisms in the forest garden?
   What values of nature are expressed by the children, and in relation to
   which situations in the forest garden? Data were collected in the form
   of field notes, audio and video recordings and photos from the
   children's visits to the forest garden. The photos were used for
   stimulated recall in focus group interviews. The data were analysed
   using a combination of qualitative content analysis (Patton, 2002) and
   semi-quantitative methods.
   The children in the study presented a unidirectional perspective about
   the relationship between themselves and the organisms, especially the
   insects, in the forest garden. Rather than asking what these organisms
   can do for me/us, they pose the question: What can I/we do for the
   bugs/plants/ bees?
   The humanistic values, expressed by the children as a willingness to
   help other organisms (mostly insects) are in line with the explicit aims
   of the former curriculum for Biology to ``promote care and respect for
   nature{''}. We should note that these humanistic values are no longer
   explicitly stated in the current curriculum. It is striking that the
   anthropocentric ecosystem services perspective (introduced in the
   current curriculum from grade 4), is so rare in the data. The children
   seldom mentioned the benefits for humans from insect pollination, even
   though this relationship is clearly stated by the pedagogues together
   with humanistic values.
   In observations, the children showed a great deal of curiosity for the
   natural environment (naturalistic value) as well as joy and enthusiasm
   about participating in the different activities that took place in the
   forest garden. Aesthetic values were expressed in relation to flowers,
   cones, berries, a snail's shell etc. This study shows that forest
   gardens have the potential to be places where children can connect
   emotionally and cognitively to other organisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{2-8}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Plant fitness is reduced by pollen limitation when the amount and
   quality of pollen deposited on stigmas is restricted. Pollen limitation
   has direct implications in mating system and floral evolution, and
   negatively affects population dynamics. We assessed pollen limitation in
   the cactus Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus from the western Chihuahuan
   Desert. We performed a supplementary pollen treatment then compared
   outcomes with naturally pollinated flowers using generalized linear
   models (GLM) and a pollen limitation index (L). Floral aperture was
   compared between days of anthesis using a single ANOVA, whereas nectar
   production was contrasted between covered/uncovered flowers and days of
   anthesis using a factorial ANOVA. Results of both GLM and L show that
   seed set proportion decreases 0.22 as a result of pollen limitation in
   natural pollinated flowers contrasted with pollen-supplemented flowers.
   Most flowers opened two days, and floral aperture between the first and
   second day varied slightly. Nectar volume was higher in covered flowers,
   showing that floral visitors consume this reward. However, high
   variances in nectar volumes obscured potential differences between
   treatments. Competition for pollinators among flowers as a result of its
   synchronous flowering and patchy distribution, as well as limited bee
   abundance generated by anthropogenic disturbance, are the more plausible
   causes of pollen limitation in A. kotschoubeyanus.}},

Journal = {{VIRUSES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference (RNAi) is the primary antiviral defense system in
   insects and its importance for pollinator health is indisputable. In
   this work, we examined the effect of Israeli acute paralysis virus
   (IAPV) infection on the RNAi process in the bumblebee, Bombus
   terrestris, and whether the presence of possible functional viral
   suppressors could alter the potency of the host's immune response. For
   this, a two-fold approach was used. Through a functional RNAi assay, we
   observed an enhancement of the RNAi system after IAPV infection instead
   of its suppression, despite only minimal upregulation of the genes
   involved in RNAi. Besides, the presence of the proposed suppressor 1A
   and the predicted OrfX protein in IAPV could not be confirmed using high
   definition mass spectrometry. In parallel, when bumblebees were infected
   with cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), known to encode a suppressor of
   RNAi, no increase in RNAi efficiency was seen. For both viruses,
   pre-infection with the one virus lead to a decreased replication of the
   other virus, indicating a major effect of competition. These results are
   compelling in the context of Dicistroviridae in multi-virus/multi-host
   networks as the effect of a viral infection on the RNAi machinery may
   influence subsequent virus infections.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work we used landmark-based geometric morphometrics to

   differentiation of this group. Analyses of wing shape by the use of
   principal component analysis (PCA), and canonical variate analysis (CVA)

   phenotypic similarity in wing shape between M. albisecta (belonging to
   the subgenus Creightonella) and M. picicornis (belonging to the subgenus
   Eutricharaea). According to the results of UPGMA, a higher degree of
   divergence between M. farinosa (belonging to the subgenus
   Pseudomegachile) and species belonging to other subgenera, was detected.
   The results of a cross-validation test indicated that geometric
   morphometrics is an effective technique to use for distinguishing
   between Megachile species. The reliability rate of this technique was
   between 85.71-100\%. Using only two submarginal cell landmarks for

Abstract = {{The wild bees Andrena assimilis RADOSZKOWSKI, 1876, and Andrena gallica
   SCHMIEDEKNECHT, 1883, are morphologically very similar species and by

   authors treat A. gallica as a subspecies of A. assimilis, others assert
   that both A. gallica and A. assimilisare valid species. After analysing
   the morphological features, we confirm that they should be treated as
   two distinct species. The following characters help to separate A.
   gallica from A. assimilis in the case of females - the colouration of
   the stigma and veins in the forewing, in the case of males - the
   microsculpture of the surface of the metasomal terga, the punctation of
   terga II-III, and the width of the edeagus. Andrena gallica was reported
   in Poland in the first half of the twentieth century from the following
   regions: Baltic Coast, Krakow-Wielun Upland, Matopolska Upland, and
   Wielkopolska-Kujawy Lowland. Due to the synonymy, these records were
   included in the distribution of A. assimilis. After more than 50 years,
   the occurrence of A. gallica in Poland has been confirmed. The new
   record of the species is reported based on the specimen collected in
   Kampinos National Park (Mazovian Lowland). In 2004, one male was
   collected on fallow land. Water pan-traps (Moericke traps) were used to
   do the collecting. Diagnoses of both species, data on their biology, as

Abstract = {{Offering more floral resources for urban bees can be achieved by growing

   selected Asteraceae (Calendula officinalis `Persimmon Beauty' and
   `Santana', Centaurea macrocephala, Cosmos sulphureus, Dahlia pinnata,
   Tagetes patula, Tithonia rotundifolia, and Zinnia elegans) as pollen
   sources for pollinators. Under urban conditions in Lublin, SE Poland,
   the investigated plants flowered from late June to the end of October.
   The mass of pollen produced in florets and capitula was found to be
   species-related. The highest pollen amounts per 10 florets (10.1 mg) as
   well as per capitulum (249.7 mg) were found for C. macrocephala. The
   mass of pollen yielded by a single plant depended on both the pollen
   mass delivered per disk florets and the proportion of disk florets in
   capitulum, and the flowering abundance of the plants. A single plant of
   D. pinnata and a single plant of T. rotundifolia each produced the
   largest pollen mass. Mean pollen yield per 1m(2) of a plot ranged from
   6.2 g (Z. elegans) to 60.7 g (D. pinnata). Pollen grains are
   tricolporate, with echinate exine, medium or small in size. They can be
   categorised as oblatespherical, spherical, and prolatespherical. The
   principal visitors to C. macrocephala, C. sulphureus, and C. officinalis
   were honey bees, whereas bumble bees dominated on T. rotundifolia and D.
   pinnata. A magnet plant for butterflies was Z. elegans. Among the

Abstract = {{The effect of insecticides on bees has gained great attention, however,
   there are few studies that explore this issue on Neotropical bees.
   Bombus atratus is a neotropical species broadly distributed in Colombia
   and is considered an important pollinator of both Andean ecosystems and
   agroecosystems. However, as for many wild bees species, the effect of
   insecticides on B. atratus is unknow. In this study we determined the
   acute median lethal dose (LD50) of commercial formulations of
   insecticides Imidacloprid, Spinosad and Thiocyclam hydrogen oxalate,
   widely used in Colombia to control several pests of important crops. The
   LD50 was carried out by oral and contact routes, following and modifying
   the EPPO and OECD guidelines to perform LD50 on A. mellifera. We
   evaluated five doses for each route and insecticide, in a total of 25
   medium-size workers for each dose by duplicate. Mortality was registered
   at 24, 48 and 72 hours after the experiment; and data were analyzed with
   the Probit regression model. For Imidacloprid, contacts and oral LD50
   were 0.048 mu g/bee and 0.010 mu g/bee, respectively. For Thiocyclam
   hydrogen oxalate, topical and oral LD50 were 0.244 mu g/bee and 0.056 mu
   g/bee, respectively. For Spinosad, the oral LD50 corresponded to 0.28 mu
   g/bee; it was not possible to establish the LD50 for the contact route.
   The Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Index of Relative Toxicity indicated that
   all three active ingredients are highly toxic. We discussed the risk of
   the insecticides use on B. atratus, considering their chemical nature.}},

Abstract = {{Bergmann's rule originally described a positive relationship between
   body size and latitude in warm-blooded animals. Larger animals, with a
   smaller surface/volume ratio, are better enabled to conserve heat in
   cooler climates (thermoregulatory hypothesis). Studies on endothermic
   vertebrates have provided support for Bergmann's rule, whereas studies
   on ectotherms have yielded conflicting results. If the thermoregulatory
   hypothesis is correct, negative relationships between body size and
   temperature should occur in temporal in addition to geographical
   gradients. To explore this possibility, we analysed seasonal activity
   patterns in a bee fauna comprising 245 species. In agreement with our
   hypothesis of a different relationship for large (endothermic) and small
   (ectothermic) species, we found that species larger than 27.81 mg (dry
   weight) followed Bergmann's rule, whereas species below this threshold
   did not. Our results represent a temporal extension of Bergmann's rule
   and indicate that body size and thermal physiology play an important
   role in structuring community phenology.}},

   interactions. However, it is little understood how plant size affects
   plant mutualists vs. antagonists and the plant's resulting reproductive
   success. We established a common garden experiment covering an
   interspecific plant size gradient (from 10 to 130 cm height) across 21
   annual Brassicaceae species, thereby standardizing features of habitat
   and surrounding landscape. We assessed flower-visiting pollinators and
   florivores (pollen beetle adults and larvae) and the resulting effects
   of all these flower-visiting insects on plant reproductive success.
   Besides flower characteristics (size, abundance, color), plant size had
   a generally positive effect on abundance and species richness of
   pollinators as well as on abundance of pollen beetle adults and larvae.
   Pollen beetles reduced seed number as well as thousand-seed weight,
   whereas pollinators increased seed number only. Overall, increasing
   plant size led to less thousand-seed weight but had no effect on seed
   number, indicating counterbalancing effects of herbivory and
   pollination. In conclusion, seed number of large plant species should
   benefit from locations with many pollinators and few herbivores and
   small plant species' seed number from locations with few pollinators and
   many herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Flower-color polymorphisms are well-documented, but how color morph
   frequencies change over time is usually unknown. We studied this
   question using the milk thistle, Silybum marianum (Asteraceae), Purple
   flowers commonly occur in Israel, but an infrequent white morph has been
   recorded since the 1920s, at first from the south of the country. Over
   seven years, we recorded the frequencies of the two color morphs in 17
   populations along a 156 km south-north transect with a steep rainfall
   gradient, The proportion of white inflorescences per population
   consistently decreased from south to north, and {[}heir mean proportion
   decreased from 24\% to 12Y over the study period, Four of the
   populations went extinct, but two were recolonized, and two additional
   populations decreased to <10 individuals. To test whether the color
   morphs differ in fitness, we collected the ripe inflorescences shortly
   before seed dispersal from all dimorphic populations in two flowering
   seasons. The numbers of developed, partially eaten and aborted seeds did
   not differ between color morphs. There was also no geographical trend in
   the numbers of developed, aborted and partially eaten seeds in either
   morph. Insect pollinators did not discriminate against the white morph.
   Thus, the decline of white-flowering plants over the course of the study
   cannot be attributed to negative interactions with pollinators or with
   seed herbivores, two potentially important agents affecting seed output.
   Our findings are compatible with genetic drift, mediated through
   population bottlenecks and founder effects, but this interpretation was
   not directly tested. Our study contributes to the ongoing discussion of
   the role of natural selection vs, random events in maintaining
   flower-color polymorphisms.}},

Abstract = {{1. Bees are ecologically important pollinators that are threatened by
   disease, habitat degradation, and habitat loss. Bee species that share
   ecological traits (e.g. body size, diet breadth, and sociality) may
   often respond similarly to environmental disturbance; however, few
   studies have examined the extent to which closely related, ecologically
   similar species exhibit divergent responses to the same forms of
   disturbance.
   2. In the present study, the responses of bumble bees (Apidae: genus
   Bombus) to urbanization are examined by combining field surveys with the
   quantification of localand landscape-level variables using Geographic
   Information Systems (GIS). During the spring and summer of 2012 and
   2013, 57, bumble bees were surveyed in 1-ha plots in San Diego County,
   California that spanned a gradient of urbanisation. Species-level,
   occurrence (presence/absence) data and logistic regressions were then
   used to identify determinants of Bombus occurrence across this
   landscape.
   3. Approximately 1000 Bombus individuals belonging to three species were
   observed: B. californicus Smith, B. melanopygus Cresson, and B.
   vosnesenskii Radoszkowski. The occurrence of all Bombus species was
   negatively related to impermeable surface cover within study plots, but
   species responded uniquely to other plot-scale variables and exhibited
   distinctive patterns of scale-dependency with respect to impermeable
   surface cover surrounding plots.
   4. Urbanisation negatively affected all three focal bumble bee species
   in this study. Species-specific responses to plot-scale and
   landscape-scale variables presumably reflect interspecific trait
   differences (e.g. body size, tongue length, and foraging behaviour).
   Unique responses to urbanisation caution against pooling species into
   functional groups based merely on taxonomic relationships or perceived
   ecological similarities.}},

Abstract = {{The final COST Cherry FA 1104 conference was organized in Greece,

   Altitudes of ca. 600 m asl provide sufficient chilling (1200 Chilling
   Units) for early flowering at 40A degrees N at the beginning of April in
   Greece's predominant cherry growing region Macedonia; honey bees provide
   pollination. Cherries are cultivated on fertile soil without frost
   protection or polytunnels and harvested from 25 May to 15 June. Old
   varieties and trees are eventually replaced by new varieties in intense
   plantings on micro-propagated GiSelA 6 or Piku rootstocks from local
   tissue culture labs; nurseries provide the grafted trees for the cherry
   industry. The pomology institute in Naoussa was founded at a site of a
   grapevine nursery 50 years ago in 1961 for research and to support the
   industry and extended to cherry from 1970 onwards. A small portion
   (13-17 \%) of the 60,000 t harvest is exported mainly to Europe
   (8-10,000 t), while Russia imported 6000 t of Greek cherries until 2014,
   before the Russian embargo started. Export quality is achieved by hand
   thinning of the small fruitlets with scissors after flowering. These

Abstract = {{Sustainable livelihoods and human well-being depend on multiple

   address potential synergies and trade-offs among assets. We combined
   socio-economic and ecological methods to quantify natural (pollinator

   in both enhanced flower-visitor richness (natural asset) and coffee
   yield (financial asset). Farmers who dedicated more time to field work
   than to administrative work applied more PFP on their farms. Our results
   highlight that land-use decisions oriented toward enhancing natural

Abstract = {{Pollinators differ in morphological and behavioral traits. The effect of

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural practice across Europe and North America have
   been associated with declines in wild bee populations. Bee diet breadth
   has been associated with sensitivity to agricultural intensification,
   but much of this analysis has been conducted at the categorical level of
   generalist or specialist, and it is not clear to what extent the level
   of generalisation within generalist species is also associated with
   species persistence. We used pollen load analysis to quantify the pollen
   diets of wild solitary bees on 19 farms across southern England, UK. A
   total of 72 species of solitary bees were recorded, but only 31 species
   were abundant enough to allow for formal diet characterisation. The
   results broadly conformed to existing literature with the majority of
   species polylectic and collecting pollen from a wide range of plants.
   Pollen load analysis consistently identified pollens from more plant
   species and families from each bee species than direct observation of
   their foraging behaviour. After rarefaction to standardise pollen load
   sample sizes, diet breadth was significantly associated with frequency
   of occurrence, with more generalist bees present on more farms than less
   generalist bees. Our results show that the majority of bee species
   present on farmland in reasonable numbers are widely variable in their
   pollen choices, but that those with the broadest diet were present on
   the greatest number of farms. Increasing the diversity of plants
   included in agri-environment schemes may be necessary to provide a wider
   range of pollen resources in order to support a diverse bee community on
   farmland.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is considered a major factor in the succession process in
   ``Cerrado'', determining the dynamics and composition of these
   Neotropical savanna plant formations. However, when savannas are
   protected from fire, both fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive plant species
   increase in density and size, especially species of trees. Nevertheless,
   how this change in the vegetation structure relates to changes in the
   ecosystem function has been seldom evaluated. Pollination is a major
   ecosystem service, and here we aimed to determine possible changes in
   floristic composition, floral biology, and pollination systems in an
   area of open savanna protected against fire over a period of 20 years in
   Minas Gerais state, Central Brazil. The comparison over the two decades
   showed that ecological succession, in the absence of fire, increased the
   diversity and decreased the dominance of plant species. There was an
   increase in specie richness from 156 spp. in 1992 to 206 spp. in 2012,
   with appearance of trees and species with specialized pollination
   systems. Plants were predominantly pollinated by bees in both periods,
   but floral diversity and specialization seem to have increased after
   fire suppression, for instance, with the emergence of more species
   pollinated by moths. Not only generalist lightcolored actinomorphic
   flowers, but also tubular or cup-like nectar flowers commonly associated
   with more specialized pollinators predominated in both periods. The
   dominance of these contrasting features actually increased after two
   decades, especially when we compare the number of individuals in each
   group. However, it seems that the increase in plant diversity and
   density of woody species did not lead to marked specialization of floral
   features and pollination system along the studied period.}},

   two distinct geographic units (valley and mountains) and two seasons
   (rainy and dry). Spatial and temporal patterns in species composition
   and abundance of these families were identified and the diversity in
   each family compared. The spatial and temporal patterns in species
   composition, diversity, and resource use were different for each family.
   Overall, diversity was higher during the rainy season. Only fly families

   visited more plant species per insect species during the rainy season,

   Apidae, Megachilidae, and Bombyliidae visited more plant species in the
   mountains, while the other families exhibited no differences between the
   mountains and the valley. The variation in the community structures of
   each group may reflect distinct life histories, resources needs during

   nests were opened to monitor the subsequent developmental stages. The
   remaining bees were wintered in nests stored at cool temperature (4

   lower at the developmental temperature of 30 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate both mutualistic and
   antagonistic plant-animal interactions; thus, the attraction of
   mutualists and antagonists by floral VOCs constitutes an important
   trade-off in the evolutionary ecology of angiosperms. Here, we evaluate
   the role of VOCs in mediating communication between the plant and its
   mutualist and antagonist floral visitors. To assess the evolutionary
   consequences of VOC-mediated signalling to distinct floral visitors, we
   studied the reproductive ecology of Dichaea pendula, assessing the
   effects of florivores on fruit set, the pollination efficiency of
   pollinators and florivores, the floral scent composition and the
   attractiveness of the major VOC to pollinators and florivores. The
   orchid depends entirely on orchid-bees for sexual reproduction, and the
   major florivores, the weevils, feed on corollas causing
   self-pollination, triggering abortion of 26.4 \% of the flowers. Floral
   scent was composed of approximately 99 \% 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, an
   unusual floral VOC attractive to pollinators and florivores. The low
   fruit set from natural pollination (5.6 \%) compared to hand
   cross-pollination (45.5 \%) and low level of pollinator visitation
   {[}0.02 visits (flower hour)(-1)] represent the limitations to
   pollination. Our research found that 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol mediates
   both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, which could result in
   contrary evolutionary pressures on novo-emission. The scarcity of
   pollinators, not florivory, was the major constraint to fruit set. Our
   results suggest that, rather than anti-florivory adaptations,
   adaptations to enhance pollinator attraction and cross-pollination might
   be the primary drivers of the evolution of VOC emission in
   euglossine-pollinated flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Urban neighborhoods vary in development intensity and in the life style
   and demographics of their residents. Decisions made by urban residents
   affect plant communities, their functional characteristics, and the
   floral resources they provide. We recorded flowers in front-facing yards
   in 58 neighborhoods in Chicago, IL (USA) and examined patterns in
   community composition and species turnover between neighborhoods. We
   investigated how species richness and plant characteristics, including
   origin, cultivation intent, and life cycle, are affected by neighborhood
   socioeconomic factors. Urban plant species tended to be perennial,
   ornamental, and non-native. White clover had the broadest distribution
   and the highest floral abundance but was not present in several of the
   highest-income neighborhoods. Although we found 144 morpho-species
   across neighborhoods, most occurred infrequently. Species turnover was
   highest for ornamental species and lowest for weedy species, suggesting
   that intentional plantings are driving beta diversity across the
   landscape. We found the highest species richness in neighborhoods with
   intermediate numbers of Hispanic and white residents and with
   intermediate number of residential lots; neighborhoods with racially or
   ethnically homogenous populations had fewer plant species. The high
   frequency of weeds in low-income neighborhoods, the occurrence of
   certain ornamental plant species in whiter, wealthier communities, and
   high turnover of species from one neighborhood to another, all suggest a
   disparity in plant-related ecosystem services across cities. Complexity
   in urban plantings may be influenced by the suite of perspectives that
   residents bring towards habitat management. Cultivation sustains a
   diversity of plants and creates a disparity in plant traits by

   facilities penetration of species into cities. As for the density of

Abstract = {{Abundance and diversity of bumblebees have been declining over the past
   decades. To successfully conserve bumblebee populations, we need to
   understand how landscape characteristics affect the quantity and quality
   of floral resources collected by colonies and subsequently colony
   performance.
   We therefore investigated how amount and composition of pollen collected
   by buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris colonies was affected by the
   surrounding landscape (i.e. the proportion of forest, urban,
   semi-natural habitats) and how they were related to colony growth.
   Thirty B. terrestris colonies were placed at grassland sites differing
   in surrounding landscape. Colonies were established in spring when
   availability of flowering plants was highest, and their weight gain was
   monitored for 1 month. We additionally recorded the quantity and
   compared plant taxonomic composition and nutritional quality (i.e. amino
   acid composition) of pollen stored.
   Bumblebee colonies varied little in the pollen spectra collected despite
   differences in surrounding landscape composition. They collected on
   average 80 \% of pollen from woody plants, with 34 \% belonging to the
   genus Acer. Early colony growth positively correlated with total amount
   of woody pollen and protein collected and decreased with increasing
   proportions of semi-natural habitats and total amino acid
   concentrations.
   Our results suggest that woody plant species represent highly important
   pollen sources for the generalist forager B. terrestris early in the
   season. We further show that colony growth of B. terrestris is
   predominantly affected by the quantity, not quality, of forage,
   indicating that several abundant plant species flowering throughout the
   bumblebees' foraging season may cover the colonies' nutritional needs.}},

Abstract = {{The positive correlation between landscape area of semi-natural habitat
   and wild pollinator richness and abundance in agroecosystems has been
   well studied. However, we lack a deep understanding of local scale
   floral resource and nest provisioning for wild bees necessary to
   optimize implementation of pollinator conservation practices.
   The primary objective of this study was to use a spatially interactive
   landscape pollination model (hereafter, the Lonsdorf model) to represent
   field scale spatial patterns of wild bee abundance and richness within a
   heterogeneous landscape in the mid-Atlantic USA.
   We parameterized the Lonsdorf model with high resolution aerial imagery
   and insight from a previously published floristic study. To test the
   Lonsdorf model predictions, field studies were conducted to measure wild
   bee abundance and species richness in apple orchards as a function of
   distance from a forest edge.
   Field measurements indicated apple pollinator abundance and species
   richness significantly decreased with increasing distance from the
   forest edge. The Lonsdorf model pollination service score was highly
   sensitive to changes in resource provisioning in orchard and non-crop
   areas, and including resource rich forest and forest edge habitats in
   the model significantly improved pollination service estimates.
   We demonstrated a novel application of the Lonsdorf model at a field
   scale to predict trends in pollination service provisioning as a factor
   of local habitat features. With sufficiently detailed inputs, the
   Lonsdorf model is a promising tool to quantify field scale pollination
   service deficits, guiding more cost effective habitat supplementation
   and other conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollinators contribute to human food production and security
   thereby ensuring an important component of human well-being. The recent
   decline of these agents in Europe and North America has aroused the
   concern of a potential global pollinator crisis. In order to prioritize
   efforts for pollinator conservation, we evaluated the extent to which
   food production depends on animal pollinators in Brazil-one of the
   world's agriculture leaders-by comparing cultivated area, produced
   volume and yield value of major food crops that are pollinator dependent
   with those that are pollinator non-dependent. In addition, we valued the
   ecosystem service of pollination based on the degree of pollinator
   dependence of each crop and the consequence of a decline in food
   production to the Brazilian Gross Domestic Product and Brazilian food
   security. A total of 68\% of the 53 major food crops in Brazil depend to
   some degree on animals for pollination. Pollinator non-dependent crops
   produce a greater volume of food, mainly because of the high production
   of sugarcane, but the cultivated area and monetary value of pollinator
   dependent crops are higher (59\% of total cultivated area and 68\% of
   monetary value). The loss of pollination services for 29 of the major
   food crops would reduce production by 16.55-51 million tons, which would
   amount to 4.86-14.56 billion dollars/year, and reduce the agricultural
   contribution to the Brazilian GDP by 6.46\%-19.36\%. These impacts would
   be largely absorbed by family farmers, which represent 74.4\% of the
   agricultural labor force in Brazil. The main effects of a pollinator
   crisis in Brazil would be felt by the poorer and more rural classes due
   to their lower income and direct or exclusive dependence on this
   ecosystem service.}},

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{In face of a dramatic decline of wild bee species in many rural
   landscapes, potential conservation functions of urban areas gain
   importance. Yet effects of urbanization on pollinators, and in
   particular on wild bees remain ambiguous and not comprehensively
   understood. This is especially true for amenity grassland and
   extensively managed wastelands within large-scale residential housing
   areas. Using Berlin as a study region we aimed to investigate (a) if
   these greenspaces are accepted by wild bee assemblages as foraging
   habitats; (b) how assemblage structure of bees and individual bee
   species are affected by different habitat (e.g., management, flower
   density) and urban matrix variables (e.g., isolation, urbanization); and
   (c) to what extent grassland restoration can promote bees in urban
   environments. In summer 2012, we collected 62 bee species belonging to
   more than 20\% of the taxa known for Berlin. Urbanization significantly
   affected species composition of bees; 18 species were affiliated to
   different levels of urbanization. Most bee species were not affected by
   any of the environmental variables tested, and urbanization had a
   negative effect only for one bee species. Further, we determined that
   restoration of diverse grasslands positively affected bee species
   richnesss in urban environments. We conclude that differently structured
   and managed greenspaces in large-scale housing areas can provide
   additional foraging habitats and refuges for pollinators. This supports
   approaches towards a biodiversity friendly management within urban
   regions and may be of particular importance given that anthropogenic
   pressure is increasing in many rural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Plants have to fine-tune their signals to optimise the trade-off between
   herbivore deterrence and pollinator attraction. An important mechanism
   in mediating plant-insect interactions is the regulation of gene
   expression via DNA methylation. However, the effect of herbivore induced

   been systematically investigated. Here, we assessed the impact of foliar
   herbivory on DNA methylation and floral traits in the model crop plant
   Brassica rapa. Methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length
   polymorphism (MSAP) analysis showed that leaf damage by the caterpillar
   Pieris brassicae was associated with genome-wide methylation changes in
   both leaves and flowers of B. rapa as well as a downturn in flower
   number, morphology and scent. A comparison to plants with jasmonic
   acid-induced defence showed similar demethylation patterns in leaves,
   but both the floral methylome and phenotype differed significantly from
   P. brassicae infested plants. Standardised genome-wide demethylation
   with 5-azacytidine in five different B. rapa full-sib groups further
   resulted in a genotype-specific downturn of floral morphology and scent,
   which significantly reduced the attractiveness of the plants to the
   pollinator bee Bombus terrestris. These results suggest that DNA

Abstract = {{Several fungal plant pathogens induce `pseudoflowers' on their hosts to
   facilitate insect-mediated transmission of gametes and spores. When
   spores must be transmitted to host flowers to complete the fungal life
   cycle, we predict that pseudoflowers should evolve traits that mimic
   flowers and attract the most effective vectors in the flower-visiting
   community. We quantified insect visitation to flowers, healthy leaves
   and leaves infected with Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi (Mvc), the
   causative agent of mummy berry disease of blueberry. We developed a
   nested PCR assay for detecting Mvc spores on bees, flies and other
   potential insect vectors. We also collected volatiles from blueberry
   flowers, healthy leaves and leaves infected with Mvc, and experimentally
   manipulated specific pathogen-induced volatiles to assess attractiveness
   to potential vectors. Bees and flies accounted for the majority of
   contacts with flowers, leaves infected with Mvc and healthy leaves.
   Flowers were contacted most often, while there was no difference between
   bee or fly contacts with healthy and infected leaves. While bees
   contacted flowers more often than flies, flies contacted infected leaves
   more often than bees. Bees were more likely to have Mvc spores on their
   bodies than flies, suggesting that bees may be more effective vectors
   than flies for transmitting Mvc spores to flowers. Leaves infected with
   Mvc had volatile profiles distinct from healthy leaves but similar to
   flowers. Two volatiles produced by flowers and infected leaves, cinnamyl
   alcohol and cinnamic aldehyde, were attractive to bees, while no
   volatiles manipulated were attractive to flies or any other insects.
   These results suggest that Mvc infection of leaves induces mimicry of
   floral volatiles, and that transmission occurs primarily via bees, which
   had the highest likelihood of carrying Mvc spores and visited flowers
   most frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Global pollination is threatened by declining insect pollinator
   populations that may be linked to neonicotinoid pesticide use.
   Neonicotinoids over stimulate neurons and depolarize their mitochondria,
   producing immobility and death. However, mitochondrial function can be
   improved by near infrared light absorbed by cytochrome c oxidase in
   mitochondrial respiration. In flies, daily exposure to 670nm light
   throughout life increases average lifespan and aged mobility, and
   reduces systemic inflammation. Here we treat bumble bees with
   Imidacloprid a common neonicotinoid. This undermined ATP and rapidly
   induced immobility and reduced visual function and survival. Bees
   exposed to insecticide and daily to 670nm light showed corrected ATP
   levels and significantly improved mobility allowing them to feed.
   Physiological recordings from eyes revealed that light exposure
   corrected deficits induced by the pesticide. Overall, death rates in
   bees exposed to insecticide but also given 670nm light were
   indistinguishable from controls. When Imidacloprid and light exposure
   were withdrawn, survival was maintained. Bees and insects generally
   cannot see deep red light so it does not disturb their behaviour. Hence,
   we show that deep red light exposure that improves mitochondrial
   function, reverses the sensory and motor deficits induced by
   Imidacloprid. These results may have important implications as light
   delivery is economic and can be placed in hives/colonies.}},

   Extensive collecting throughout Israel in recent years has yielded eight
   new species and one new subspecies, adding to the rich bee fauna of the
   region: A. crocusella Pisanty \& Scheuchl n. sp., A. danini Pisanty \&
   Scheuchl n. sp., A. hermonella Scheuchl \& Pisanty n. sp., A. israelica
   Scheuchl \& Pisanty n. sp., A. judaea Scheuchl \& Pisanty n. sp., A.
   menahemella Scheuchl \& Pisanty n. sp., A. palaestina Pisanty \&
   Scheuchl n. sp., A. perahia Pisanty \& Scheuchl n. sp., and A.
   sphecodimorpha mediterranea Pisanty \& Scheuchl n. ssp. The previously
   unknown female of A. fimbriatoides Scheuchl 2004 and male of A. wolfi
   Gusenleitner \& Scheuchl 2000 are also described here for the first
   time. The discovery of males of A. wolfi lead us to reinstate A.
   iohannescaroli Nobile 2000 as a valid taxon. Detailed morphological
   description and differential diagnosis against closest relatives are
   provided for all species, as well as information on the distribution,
   phenology and flower visitation, when available. A neotype is designated
   for A. sphecodimorpha Hedicke, the holotype of which is considered to be
   lost. Additional collecting efforts in diverse habitats and seasons,
   incorporating diverse collecting techniques, are required in order to
   deepen our knowledge of the rich bee fauna in threatened habitats in the
   Mediterranean Basin, which constitutes one of the world's major hotspots
   for wild bees.}},

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions have been studied for approximately one
   hundred years. During that time, many field methods have been developed
   to clarify the pollination effectiveness of each pollinator for visited
   flowers. Pollinator observations have been one of the most common
   methods to identify pollinators, and bagging and cage experiments have
   been conducted to show the effectiveness of specific pollinators. In a
   previous study of Lycoris sanguinea var. sanguinea, its effective
   pollinators, the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor, and its
   reproductive strategies were not identified. This study reports the
   observation that small bees visited flowers that were partially opened (
   breaking buds). To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not
   been reported previously. Further, this study investigates the
   hypothesis that small bees can pollinate at that flowering stage. This
   study demonstrates the basic methods of field experiments in pollination
   ecology using L. sanguinea var. sanguinea. Pollinator observations and
   digital video showed the visitation frequencies of each floral visitor.
   Bagging and cage experiments revealed that these flowers could be
   pollinated fully and that breaking-bud pollination could be important
   for the pollination of this plant species. The advantages and
   disadvantages of each method are discussed, and recent developments,
   including laboratory experiments, are described.}},

Abstract = {{Plants experience often opposing energetic demands and selective
   pressures-for instance, where plants need to attract an insect that is
   both the pollinator and herbivore, or alternately, where plants attract
   prey (due to limited resources) and pollinators. Together, these
   selective pressures can modify the volatile signals available to the
   plant's mutualistic and antagonistic partners. Nevertheless, it remains
   an open question how changes in the information content of volatile
   signals modify behavioral responses in mutualists and antagonists, and
   what the underlying neural bases of these behaviors are. This review
   focuses on two systems to explore the impact of herbivory and resource
   availability on plant-pollinator interactions: hawkmoth-pollinated
   hostplants (where herbivory is common), and carnivorous bee-pollinated
   pitcher plants (where the plants differentially attract bee pollinators
   and other insect prey). We focus on (1) the volatile signals emitted
   from these plants because these volatiles operate as long-distance
   signals to attract, or deter, insect partners, (2) how this information
   is processed in the hawkmoth olfactory system, and (3) how volatile
   information changes spatiotemporally. In both the plants and their
   respective insect partner(s), volatile signaling, reception and behavior
   are dynamic and plastic, providing flexibility an ever-changing

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{30-36}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Invasive floral visitors may obtain nectar rewards from native plants
   exerting nectar robbing. Nevertheless, the probability of a plant to be
   robbed will ultimately depend upon the accessibility constraints imposed
   by the phenotypes of flowers and animals, and putatively upon the
   abundance of animals. The alien bumblebee B. terrestris is widely
   distributed in the temperate forests of Chile, where it is exerting
   nectar robbing on flowers of F. magellanica. Its geographic distribution
   and the causes of nectar robbing, however, are currently unknown. The
   aim of this study is to evaluate the distribution of nectar robbing in a
   wide range of distribution of plants and animals, and the causes of
   nectar robbing in terms of floral and animal phenotypes, and in terms of
   animal abundances. The primary nectar robbing did not correlate with the
   latitude, longitude or altitude of populations, thus indicating an
   absence of dine variation in the causes of nectar robbing. The
   variability of primary nectar robbing seemingly showed a bimodal
   distribution, since the most represented categories were the low and
   high incidence of primary nectar robbing. Petal length, rather than
   other flora traits, coupled to the glossa length of animals, played a
   pivotal role in the probability of flowers to experience nectar robbing.
   The putative negative consequences upon the population persistence and
   the evolution and maintenance of floral phenotypes of
   hummingbird-pollinated plants strongly encourage new assessments. (C)

Volume = {{149}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims - Apios priceana is a rare flowering plant that can
   only be found in parts of the Southeastern United States. Little is
   known about the reproductive biology of this plant and only a few insect
   flower visitors have been previously documented. The aim of this study
   was to further document the insect flower visitors of A. priceana in
   North Alabama.
   Methods - Cameras and observers recorded flower visitors during the 2014
   blooming season of a large North Alabama population of A. priceana.
   Key results - Although fifteen different species of insects were
   documented on flowers of A. priceana, most performed a single or very
   few visits. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.), two species of Megachilidae
   (Megachile sculpturalis and Megachile campanulae), and the hummingbird
   clearwing (Hemaris thysbe) were the most common visitors. Interestingly,
   the giant resin bee, M. sculpturalis, is considered to be an invasive
   species but in this case may be pollinating a native and Federally
   threatened plant.
   Conclusion - Although A. priceana flowers are visited by numerous
   insects, Bombus spp. and, surprisingly, an invasive species (Megachile
   sculpturalis) are probably the most important pollinators of this plant.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{149}},

Pages = {{319-328}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Blakea austin-smithii, B. chlorantha and B. aff.
   penduliflora from Costa Rican cloud forests share floral traits with
   rodent-pollinated plants, e.g. cryptic, inconspicuous, green flowers,
   and are known to be visited and probably pollinated by rodents. However,
   contrasting records indicate birds as pollen vectors for B. chlorantha.
   Previously, three Costa Rican Blakea species were described to have
   flowers lacking scent discernible to humans which is typical for
   bird-pollinated but not for rodent-pollinated flowers. This study aims
   at evaluating the role of rodents and birds as pollinators of B.
   austin-smithii and B. chlorantha in Costa Rica as well as the yet
   unstudied B. gregii in Panama. Therefore, additional diurnal observation
   data as well as data on floral traits were collected.
   Methods - In addition to floral visitor observations during the day and
   measurements of nectar properties, floral colour and morphology, floral
   scent was analysed by means of coupled gas chromatography - mass
   spectrometry. Two bee-pollinated Blakea species were chosen as
   methodological standards.
   Key results - We observed three passerine bird species, Chlorospingus
   flavopectus, C. pileatus, Myioborus torquatus, and the hummingbird
   Lampornis calolaemus visiting B. austin-smithii as well as the
   hummingbird Panterpe insignis visiting the similar Panamanian B. gregii.
   Whereas no scent was detected in B. austin-smithii, B. chlorantha and B.
   gregii, strong odours of B. maurofernandeziana (roselike) and B. anomala
   (lemon-like) could be confirmed with the finding of > 70\% phenylethyl
   alcohol, and monoterpenes, respectively.
   Conclusions - The bird observations together with lacking olfactory
   signals point to birds as main pollinators. However, to clearly evaluate
   pollinator importance of the different vertebrates, further observations
   and proof of pollen transfer are needed.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1950-1963}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Land-use change is cited as a primary driver of
   global biodiversity loss, with myriad consequences for species,
   populations, and ecosystems. However, few studies have examined its
   impact on species interactions, particularly pollination. Furthermore,
   when the effects of land-use change on pollination have been studied,
   the focus has largely been on species pollinated by diurnal pollinators,
   namely, bees and butterflies. Here, we focus on Oenothera harringtonii,
   a night-flowering, disturbance-adapted species that has experienced a
   range-wide gradient of land-use change. We tested the hypothesis that
   the negative impacts of land-use change are mitigated by long-distance
   pollination.
   METHODS: Our study included both temporal (4yr) and spatial (19
   populations range-wide, and 1,2, and 5 km from the population center)
   data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of land-use
   change on pollination biology and reproduction.
   KEY RESULTS: We first confirmed that O. harringtonii is
   self-incompatible and reliant on pollinators for reproduction. We then
   showed that hawkmoths (primarily Hyles lineata) are highly reliable and
   effective pollinators in both space and time. Unlike other studies, we
   did not detect an effect of population size, increased isolation, or a
   reduction in suitable habitat in areas with evidence of land-use change
   on pollination ( visitation, pollen removal and deposition).
   Furthermore, the proportion of suitable habitat and other fragmentation
   metrics examined were not associated with population size or density in
   this plant species.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that nocturnal pollination of Oenothera
   harringtonii via hawkmoths is robust to the negative impacts of land-use
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Disepalum comprises two monophyletic sister subgenera, Enicosanthellum
   and Disepalum, with strikingly different floral morphologies: the former
   has two whorls of unfused sepals, forming a partially enclosed floral
   chamber, whereas the latter possesses a single whorl of congenitally
   fused petals and lacks a floral chamber. The pollination ecologies of
   representative species are reported, including assessments of floral
   phenloogy, pollinators and floral thermogenesis. Disepalum pulchrum
   (subgenus Enicosanthellum) has hermaphroditic flowers with a pollination
   chamber and is protogynous with prolonged anthesis; it is pollinated by
   nitidulid beetles and drosophilid flies. Disepalum anomalum (subgenus
   Disepalum) is also hermaphroditic with prolonged anthesis, but has
   incomplete protogyny due to overlapping pistillate and staminate phases;
   it is pollinated by meliponine bees, which are attracted by the pollen,
   but which are only able to transfer pollen to receptive stigmas during
   the overlap phase. Alternative evolutionary hypotheses are evaluated,
   including the possibility that the ancestor of the subgenus Disepalum
   lineage may have experienced a profound genetic mutation, possibly
   involving genes responsible for organ merism and fusion, resulting in
   the loss of the pollination chamber and hence favouring different floral

Abstract = {{This study tested the hypothesis that self-compatibility would be
   associated with floral traits that facilitate autonomous
   self-pollination to ensure reproduction under low pollinator visitation.
   In a comparison of two pairs of Ipomoea species with contrasting
   breeding systems, we predicted that self-compatible (SC) species would
   have smaller, less variable flowers, reduced herkogamy, lower pollinator
   visitation and higher reproductive success than their self-incompatible
   (SI) congeners.
   We studied sympatric species pairs, I. hederacea (SC)-I. mitchellae (SI)
   and I. purpurea (SC)-I. indica (SI), in Mexico, over two years. We
   quantified variation in floral traits and nectar production, documented
   pollinator visitation, and determined natural fruit and seed set.
   Hand-pollination and bagging experiments were conducted to determine
   potential for autonomous self-pollination and apomixis.
   Self-compatible Ipomoea species had smaller flowers and lower nectar
   production than SI species; however, floral variation and integration
   did not vary according to breeding system. Bees were primary pollinators
   of all species, but visitation rates were seven times lower in SC than
   SI species. SC species had a high capacity for autonomous
   self-pollination due to reduced herkogamy at the highest anther levels.
   Self-compatible species had two to six times higher fruit set than SI
   species.
   Results generally support the hypothesis that self-compatibility and
   autonomous self-pollination ensure reproduction under low pollinator
   visitation. However, high variation in morphological traits of SC

Abstract = {{1 An increasing production of annual bioenergy crops such as maize has
   led to regional land-use changes, causing further shortages of already
   scarce floral resources for pollinators. Diversification of energy crop
   production with flowering crops is discussed as a mitigation strategy.
   The perennial Silphium perfoliatum, characterized by a flowering period
   between July and September, represents a promising candidate crop.
   2 The present study aimed to investigate the management and landscape
   conditions under which a cultivation of S. perfoliatum could be an
   effective measure for pollinator conservation. In this context,
   hoverflies served as suitable indicators as a result of the different
   feeding behaviours of adults (floral resources) and larvae (mostly
   zoophagous or microphagous).
   3 We compared abundance and species richness of adult hoverflies in 15
   flowering S. perfoliatum fields in Germany with that in neighbouring
   habitats (maize fields, ditches/brooks and forest edges) and tested
   whether the landscape composition influenced local abundance and species
   richness in S. perfoliatum fields depending on larval feeding type.
   4 Only microphagous hoverflies were more abundant in S. perfoliatum
   fields than in neighbouring habitats, primarily in mid-September. This
   might be explained by the different activity periods and adaptations to
   flower traits of the two hoverfly groups. Although the abundance of
   zoophagous hoverflies was positively influenced by a higher crop
   diversity, the abundance and species richness of microphagous hoverflies
   responded positively to higher proportions of semi-natural habitats in
   the surroundings.
   5 Silphium perfoliatum can support certain hoverfly groups when it is
   harvested late to ensure a flower supply through to September and when
   semi-natural habitats are maintained in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Bombus terrestris (L.) is naturally distributed mainly in Europe, and
   since 1988, it has been used commercially as a valuable pollinator of
   greenhouse crops in many countries, far beyond its natural range.
   Although the possible ecological impacts of this invasive species have
   been intensely discussed with respect to hybridization, we know little
   about the consequences of this nearly 30-year period of
   commercialization. We examined and compared the developmental
   characteristics of native and commercial colonies and their
   first-generation hybrids under the same laboratory conditions. Young
   queens and males produced in both native and commercial colonies were
   mated to generate four genotype groups: Native x Native (N-a (TM) Euro x
   N-a (TM),N-), Native x Commercial (N-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C-),
   Commercial x Commercial (C-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C-), and Commercial x
   Native (C-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N-). The commercial genotype produced
   significantly more gynes and workers than did the native genotype.
   However, average gyne number of N-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N- was not
   significantly different from the pooled N-a (TM) Euro x C-a (TM),C- and
   C-a (TM) Euro x N-a (TM),N-. The commercial genotype constructed more
   egg cells in the first brood and commenced egg laying earlier.
   Hybridization between commercial and native genotypes generally resulted
   in intermediate expression of the colony traits. Our data suggest that
   the maternal genotype primarily determines these colony traits. Our
   results imply that hybridization with the commercial genotype affected
   some colony traits of native B. terrestris colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Anthonomus signatus, the strawberry bud weevil, is active in early
   spring toinciding with the bloom period of host plants and when managed
   and unmanaged pollinators are active. Female A. signatus cause injury to
   the host plant during egg laying when they deposit a single egg inside
   an unopened flower bud and then girdle or ``clip{''} the bud at the
   pedicel. Past efforts to control A. signatus populations have relied on
   the use of broad spectrum insecticides. Fields are either treated at the
   first signs of damage, or precautionary treatments may be applied
   prophylactically in fields with a history of damage. Because A. signatus
   damage occurs during bloom, there is concern about the potential harm to
   pollinators caused by these treatments. In order to identify materials
   more compatible for use during bloom, the efficacy of reduced risk
   pesticides against A. signatus was tested in semi-field bioassays over
   two years. Beauveria bassiana, cyantraniliprole, novaluron, and
   pyrethrins were assessed in the first year, and none caused significant
   A. signatus mortality. Acetamiprid, flonicamid, and spinosad were

Abstract = {{Recent studies of mutualistic networks show that interactions between

   could drive these patterns, but the relative importance of these factors
   has not been separated. We established a field experiment consisting of
   102 monospecific plots of 17 native plant species, from which we
   collected 6713 specimens of 52 bee species over four years. We used
   these data and a null model to determine whether bee species' foraging
   choices varied more or less over time beyond the variation expected by
   chance. Thus we provide the first quantitative definition of rewiring
   and fidelity as these terms are used in the literature on interaction
   networks. All 52 bee species varied in plant partner choice across
   years, but for 27 species this variation was indistinguishable from
   random partner choice. Another 11 species showed rewiring, varying more
   across years than expected by chance, while 14 species showed fidelity,
   indicating that they both prefer certain plant species and are
   consistent in those preferences across years. Our study shows that
   rewiring and fidelity both exist in mutualist networks, but that once
   sampling effects have been accounted for, they are less common than has

Abstract = {{Declines in pollinator abundance and diversity are not only a
   conservation issue, but also a threat to crop pollination. Maintained
   infrastructure corridors, such as those containing electricity
   transmission lines, are potentially important wild pollinator habitat.
   However, there is a lack of evidence comparing the abundance and

   important pollinator habitats. We compared the diversity of a key
   pollinator group, bumblebees (Bombus spp.), between transmission
   corridors and the surrounding semi- natural and managed habitat types at
   10 sites across Sweden's Uppland region. Our results show that
   transmission corridors have no impact on bumblebee diversity in the
   surrounding area. However, transmission corridors and other maintained
   habitats such as roadsides have a level of bumblebee abundance and
   diversity comparable to semi- natural grasslands and host species that
   are important for conservation and ecosystem service provision. Under
   the current management regime, transmission corridors already provide
   valuable bumblebee habitat, but given that host plant density is the
   main determinant of bumblebee abundance, these areas could potentially
   be enhanced by establishing and maintaining key host plants. We show
   that in northern temperate regions the maintenance of transmission
   corridors has the potential to contribute to bumblebee conservation and
   the ecosystem services they provide.}},

Abstract = {{In dryland systems, shrubs often increase the productivity, abundance,
   and diversity of understory plants, however these positive interactions
   can also scale to other trophic levels. The facilitative effect of
   Larrea tridentata was hypothesized to extend beyond plants to the local
   insect community in the Mojave Desert. Pan traps were placed under
   shrubs and in open microsites to test the following predictions: 1)
   shrub-annual facilitation complexes increase insect abundance, richness,
   and diversity; and 2) specific insect families or functional groups
   respond to the shrub-annual facilitation complex more strongly due to
   increased resources. Abundance, richness, and diversity of the insect
   communities associated with shrubs were significantly greater in shrub
   compared to open microsites. The families Sphecidae, Formicidae,
   Bradynobaenidae and Lauxaniidae were positively associated with shrubs
   while Scarabaeidae was associated with open microsites. However, there
   was no difference in the relative abundances of major functional groups,
   suggesting that the primary pollinators for this ecosystem are not
   sensitive to differences in floral resources at this scale. This study
   demonstrates that shrubs facilitate local insect communities and
   supports the hypothesis that plant-plant facilitation can extend to
   other trophic levels. Management of desert shrubs is thus an effective
   means to enhance many components of insect biodiversity. (C) 2016

   For ectothermic animals, food temperature can be an important

   2. Here, the effect of food temperature on food preferences in the
   green-headed ant Rhytidoponera metallica (Smith, 1858) was investigated.
   The first aim of the study was to determine how food concentration
   (caloric value) and relative food temperature influenced colony-level
   preferences. We found that, all else being equal, green-headed ant
   colonies preferred warmer food solutions over colder solutions, and more
   concentrated food solutions over less concentrated ones.
   3. Next, the question of whether green-head ant colonies could make
   trade-offs between temperature and food concentration was tested. It was
   found that ant colonies switched their preferences in favour of a colder
   food solution when the colder food solution was 10 times more
   concentrated than the warmer food solution.
   4. These experiments show that temperature is an important

Abstract = {{The bumble bee (Bombus spp.) fauna of Texas has been infrequently

   status of the state's species. A significant body of research has
   documented declines for bumble bee species across several continents

   bimaculatus Cresson 1863, B. impatiens Cresson 1863, B. variabilis
   (Cresson 1872), B. fraternus (Smith 1854), and B. pensylvanicus (De Geer

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Speciation is often described as a continuous
   dynamic process, expressed by different magnitudes of reproductive
   isolation (RI) among groups in different levels of divergence. Studying
   intraspecific partial RI can shed light on mechanisms underlying
   processes of population divergence. Intraspecific divergence can be
   driven by spatially stochastic accumulation of genetic differences
   following reduced gene flow, resulting in increased RI with increased
   geographical distance, or by local adaptation, resulting in increased RI
   with environmental difference.
   Methods We tested for RI as a function of both geographical distance and
   ecological differentiation in Iris atropurpurea, an endemic Israeli
   coastal plant. We crossed plants in the Netanya Iris Reserve population
   with plants from 14 populations across the species' full distribution,
   and calculated RI and reproductive success based on fruit set, seed set
   and fraction of seed viability.
   Key Results We found that total RI was not significantly associated with
   geographical distance, but significantly increased with ecological
   distance. Similarly, reproductive success of the crosses, estimated
   while controlling for the dependency of each component on the previous
   stage, significantly reduced with increased ecological distance.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that the rise of post-pollination
   reproductive barriers in I. atropurpurea is more affected by ecological

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (genus Bombus) are globally important insect pollinators,
   and several species have experienced marked declines in recent years.
   Both nutritional limitation and pathogens may have contributed to these
   declines. While each of these factors may be individually important,
   there may also be synergisms where nutritional stress could decrease
   pathogen resistance. Understanding interactions between bumble bees,
   their parasites, and food availability may provide new insight into the
   causes of declines. In this study, we examined the combined impacts of
   pollen and nectar limitation on Crithidia, a common gut parasite in
   Bombus impatiens Cresson. Individual worker bees were inoculated with
   Crithidia and then assigned in a factorial design to two levels of
   pollen availability (pollen or no pollen) and two nectar sugar
   concentrations (high {[}30\%] or low {[}15\%] sucrose). We found that
   lack of pollen and low nectar sugar both reduced Crithidia cell counts,
   with the most dramatic effect from lack of pollen. Both pollen
   availability and nectar sugar concentration were also important for bee
   survival. The proportion of bees that died after seven days of infection
   was similar to 25\% lower in bees with access to pollen and high nectar
   sugar concentration than any other treatment. Thus, nectar and pollen
   availability are both important for bee survival, but may come at a cost
   of higher parasite loads. Our results illustrate the importance of
   understanding environmental context, such as resource availability, when
   examining a host-parasite interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Healthy plant communities of the American sagebrush steppe consist of
   mostly wind-pollinated shrubs and grasses interspersed with a diverse
   mix of mostly spring-blooming, herbaceous perennial wildflowers. Native,
   nonsocial bees are their common floral visitors, but their floral
   associations and abundances are poorly known. Extrapolating from the few
   available pollination studies, bees are the primary pollinators needed
   for seed production. Bees, therefore, will underpin the success of
   ambitious seeding efforts to restore native forbs to impoverished
   sagebrush steppe communities following vast wildfires. This study
   quantitatively characterized the floral guilds of 17 prevalent
   wildflower species of the Great Basin that are, or could be, available
   for restoration seed mixes. More than 3800 bees representing >170
   species were sampled from >35,000 plants. Species of Osmia, Andrena,
   Bombus, Eucera, Halictus, and Lasioglossum bees prevailed. The most
   thoroughly collected floral guilds, at Balsamorhiza sagittata and
   Astragalus filipes, comprised 76 and 85 native bee species,
   respectively. Pollen-specialists dominated guilds at Lomatium dissectum,
   Penstemon speciosus, and several congenerics. In contrast, the two
   native wildflowers used most often in sagebrush steppe seeding
   mixes-Achillea millefolium and Linum lewisii-attracted the fewest bees,
   most of them unimportant in the other floral guilds. Successfully
   seeding more of the other wildflowers studied here would greatly improve
   degraded sagebrush steppe for its diverse native bee communities.}},

Abstract = {{Many federal, state, and tribal agencies, as well as nonprofit

   areas can be managed to enhance native pollinators and the ecosystem
   services they provide. However, managing this important group must be
   balanced with other services that natural areas provide including
   hunting, timber production, and livestock grazing. Significant knowledge
   gaps exist about how to effectively manage habitats used by large
   ungulates (e.g., cattle (Bos taurus), elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer
   (Odocoileus hemionus)) in ways that also enhance pollinators. One key
   gap is understanding the degree to which diets of mammalian herbivores
   overlap with floral resources used by bees, and how this overlap varies
   spatially and temporally. Invertebrate pollinators, including bees, rely
   on flowering forbs and shrubs for nectar and pollen. Ungulates also feed
   on flowering plants, although preferences vary by ungulate species,
   vegetation community, and season. Here we review existing literature on
   ungulate diets relative to flowering plants and compare this information

   diversity at the Starkey Experimental Forest and Range in northeastern
   Oregon. Our review can inform managers about the potential dietary

Abstract = {{The steep declines over the last quarter century of wild pollinators in
   the Southwest among native bees, monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus
   L.), hummingbirds, and nectar-feeding bats have come during a time of
   accelerated climate change, and are likely due to a variety of stresses
   interacting with climatic shifts. Nevertheless, there is mounting
   evidence that declining availability and altered timing of floral
   resources along ``nectar corridors{''} accessible to pollinators
   involves climatic shifts as a serious stressor that had been previously
   underestimated. Longitudinal studies from both urban heat islands and
   rural habitats in Southwestern North America suggest peak flowering of
   many wildflowers serving as floral resources for pollinators is
   occurring three to five weeks earlier in spring than a century ago,
   leaving ``phenological gaps{''} in nectar resource availability for
   certain pollinators. To avoid the threat of what A. Dobson (Professor of
   Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Princeton University) and others have
   termed ``food web collapse,{''} a range of groups have initiated
   ecological restoration efforts in semi-arid zones that attempt to (a)
   assemble more resilient plant-pollinator food chains, and (b)
   hydrologically restore watercourses to ensure water scarcity will be
   less likely to disrupt re-assembled food chains in the face of droughts,
   catastrophic floods, and other correlates of global climate change. We
   recommend ``bottom-up food chain restoration{''} strategies for
   restoring nectar corridors in protected areas on or near geopolitical
   and land management boundaries in all regions, but particularly in the
   Southwest or US-Mexico desert border states. We highlight binational and

   services received by Santa Susana tarweed, Deinandra minthornii, a
   California-listed Rare (CR) endemic of the Santa Susana Mountains that
   were associated with a native forb seed mix used in a large-scale

   exclusion experiments indicate D. minthornii to be highly dependent on

   process. We studied phenotypic variation, genetic differentiation,
   spatial distribution and reproductive ecology in two sympatric forms of
   the understorey palm Geonoma macrostachys in lowland tropical rainforest
   in Amazonian Ecuador. The two forms were morphologically and genetically
   distinct and differed in habitat preference, with one form being
   confined to moist flood plain habitats and the other occurring in terra
   firme and flood plain. Pollen transfer between the two forms was
   limited, but not totally prevented, by differences in flowering time,
   with flowers of the small form opening 2-3 h earlier than those of the

Volume = {{128}},
Pages = {{27-33}},

Abstract = {{Drilling of treated seeds with vacuum-based precision drills can cause
   emissions of pesticide-laden dust, which have been linked with declines
   of pollinator populations. Predicting the drift pattern of this type of
   dust is challenging because the particles are very irregular in terms of
   size, shape, density, internal porosity and chemical composition. In
   this work, a 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model of seed
   treatment dust drift was developed and validated with wind tunnel data.
   In the wind tunnel experiment, dust abraded from pesticide-treated seed
   was separated in three size fractions and released from a point source
   at a height of 0.7 m at three air velocities. Dust deposition was
   measured at six distances on the wind tunnel floor. The physicochemical
   properties of the dust samples were measured and implemented in the CFD
   model. Lagrangian tracking was used to calculate the dust particle
   trajectories. The simulated dust deposition patterns agreed with those
   observed in the wind tunnel trials. It was demonstrated that an
   accurate, particle size-dependent description of the shape, chemical
   content and internal porosity of the dust particles was necessary to
   achieve good validation results. The CFD model can be used as a basis
   for the simulation of dust drift in the field during sowing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Factors associated with agricultural intensification, for example, loss
   of seminatural vegetation and pesticide use has been shown to adversely
   affect the bee community. These factors may impact the bee community
   differently at different landscape scales. The scale dependency is
   expected to be more pronounced in heterogeneous landscapes. However, the
   scale-dependent response of the bee community to drivers of its decline
   is relatively understudied, especially in the tropics where the
   agricultural landscape is often heterogeneous. This study looked at
   effects of agricultural intensification on bee diversity at patch and
   landscape scales in a tropical agricultural landscape. Wild bees were
   sampled using 12 permanent pan trap stations. Patch and landscape
   characteristics were measured within a 100 m (patch scale) and a 500 m
   (landscape scale) radius of pan trap stations. Information on pesticide
   input was obtained from farmer surveys. Data on vegetation cover,
   productivity, and percentage of agricultural and fallow land (FL) were
   collected using satellite imagery. Intensive areas in a bee-site network
   were less specialized in terms of resources to attract rare bee species
   while the less intensive areas, which supported more rare species, were
   more vulnerable to disturbance. A combination of patch quality and
   diversity as well as pesticide use regulates species diversity at the
   landscape scale (500 m), whereas pesticide quantity drove diversity at
   the patch scale (100 m). At the landscape scale, specialization of each
   site in terms of resources for bees increased with increasing patch
   diversity and FL while at the patch scale specialization declined with
   increased pesticide use. Bee functional groups responded differentially
   to landscape characteristics as well as pesticide use. Wood nesting bees
   were negatively affected by the number of pesticides used but other bee
   functional groups were not sensitive to pesticides. Synthesis and
   Applications: Different factors affect wild bee diversity at the scale
   of landscape and patch in heterogeneous tropical agricultural systems.
   The differential response of bee functional groups to agricultural
   intensification underpins the need for guild-specific management
   strategies for wild bee conservation. Less intensively farmed areas
   support more rare species and are vulnerable to disturbance;
   consequently, these areas should be prioritized for conservation to
   maintain heterogeneity in the landscape. It is important to conserve and
   restore seminatural habitats to maintain complexity in the landscapes
   through participatory processes and to regulate synthetic chemical
   pesticides in farm operations to conserve the species and functional
   diversity of wild bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticides have become an inseparable element of agricultural
   intensification. While the direct impact of pesticides on non-target
   organisms, such as pollinators, has recently received much attention,
   less consideration has been given to the microorganisms that are
   associated with them. Specialist yeasts and bacteria are known to
   commonly inhabit floral nectar and change its chemical characteristics
   in numerous ways, possibly influencing pollinator attraction. In this
   study, we investigated the in vitro susceptibility of nectar yeasts
   Metschnikowia gruessi, Metschnikowia reukaufii, and Candida bombi to six
   widely used agricultural fungicides (prothioconazole, tebuconazole,
   azoxystrobin, fenamidone, boscalid, and fluopyram). Next, a commercial
   antifungal mixture containing tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin was
   applied to natural populations of the plant Linaria vulgaris and the
   occurrence, abundance, and diversity of nectar-inhabiting yeasts and
   bacteria was compared between treated and untreated plants. The results
   showed that prothioconazole and tebuconazole were highly toxic to nectar
   yeasts, inhibiting their growth at concentrations varying between 0.06
   and 0.5 mg/L. Azoxystrobin, fenamidone, boscalid, and fluopyram on the
   other hand exhibited considerably lower toxicity, inhibiting yeast
   growth at concentrations between 1 and 32 mg/L or in many cases not
   inhibiting microbial growth at all. The application of the antifungal
   mixture in natural plant populations resulted in a significant decrease
   in the occurrence and abundance of yeasts in individual flowers, but
   this did not translate into noticeable changes in bacterial incidence
   and abundance. Yeast and bacterial species richness and distribution did
   not also differ between treated and untreated plants. We conclude that
   the application of fungicides may have negative effects on the abundance
   of nectar yeasts in floral nectar. The consequences of these effects on
   plant pollination processes in agricultural systems warrant further
   investigation.}},

   We analyzed 170 barcode-compliant COI sequences from 19 species. DNA
   barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two
   new cryptic species. Interspecific distances were significantly higher
   than those reported for other bees. Maximum intraspecific divergence was
   less than 1\% in 14 species. Barcode index numbers (BINs) were useful to
   identify putative species that need further study. More than one BIN was
   assigned to five species. The name Corynura patagonica (Cockerell)
   probably refers to two cryptic species. The results suggest that
   Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified using DNA barcodes.
   The sequences of the species included in this study can be used as a

Abstract = {{Thirty-eight species of the genus Helianthus L. were evaluated for

   vegetative period, self-fertility, and seed production for traits
   important for genebank maintenance. Direct sowing gave poor results,
   while germination of seeds, growing plantlets in the greenhouse, and
   transplanting them to the field was more appropriate. Cultivation as a
   living collection in the field was found to be a convenient way to
   maintain perennial species because of their high self-sterility. Seed
   germination was very low, with an average of 26.3 \% in the annual
   species. By removing the seed hull and coat (dehulling), it increased
   germination to 64.4 \%. Seeds of most of the perennial species did not
   germinate, while the average germination with the use of dehulling was
   23.9 \%. The number of days to flowering in the annual species averaged
   76 days, while in the perennial species it was much longer, averaging
   121 days. For some species, photoperiod manipulation is recommended to
   get them to flower before first frost. Self-fertility in the majority of
   tested species was close to zero so that self-pollination is not a
   useful seed regeneration method. Sibbing in isolation cages proved to be
   most efficient method for seed production, but with mandatory pollen

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is a major threat for beneficial organisms and the

   Trap-nests of O. bicornis were studied in 30 agricultural landscapes of

   of 500 m around the sites. Pollen composition of larval diet changed as
   isolation to the main pollen source, Ranunculus, increased, suggesting
   that O. bicornis adapted its foraging strategy in function of the nest
   proximity to main pollen sources. Abundance of O. bicornis was neither
   related to isolation or amount of nesting habitat nor to isolation or
   abundance of food plants. Surprisingly, nests of O. bicornis contained
   fewer larvae in sites at forest edge compared to isolated sites,
   possibly due to higher parasitism risk. This study indicates that O.
   bicornis can nest in a variety of situations by compensating scarcity of

Abstract = {{Stingless bees constitute a species-rich tribe of tropical and
   subtropical eusocial Apidae that act as important pollinators for
   flowering plants. Many foraging tasks rely on vision, e.g. spatial
   orientation and detection of food sources and nest entrances. Meliponini
   workers are usually small, which sets limits on eye morphology and thus
   quality of vision. Limitations are expected both on acuity, and thus on
   the ability to detect objects from a distance, as well as on
   sensitivity, and thus on the foraging time window at dusk and dawn. In
   this study, we determined light intensity thresholds for flight under
   dim light conditions in eight stingless bee species in relation to body
   size in a Neotropical lowland rainforest. Species varied in body size
   (0.8-1.7 mm thorax-width), and we found a strong negative correlation
   with light intensity thresholds (0.1-79 lx). Further, we measured eye
   size, ocelli diameter, ommatidia number, and facet diameter. All
   parameters significantly correlated with body size. A disproportionately
   low light intensity threshold in the minute Trigonisca pipioli, together
   with a large eye parameter P (eye) suggests specific adaptations to
   circumvent the optical constraints imposed by the small body size. We
   discuss the implications of body size in bees on foraging behavior.}},

   by bees}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{83-91}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators frequently use complex motor routines to find and extract
   floral rewards. Studies of pollinators foraging for nectar rewards
   indicate these routines are typically learned, and that constraints
   associated with learning and memory give pollinators incentive to
   continue foraging on these flowers. However, plants offer rewards
   besides nectar, including pollen, lipids and essential oils. In
   particular, bees use a complex motor routine termed floral sonication to
   extract pollen, their primary source of protein, from the more than 6\%
   of flowering plant species (>22000 species) that conceal pollen rewards
   within tube-like poricidal anthers. If floral sonication requires
   learning, this pollen extraction behaviour could contribute to floral
   fidelity. However, no studies have quantified the effect of experience
   on flower handling for bees extracting pollen from poricidal species. We
   therefore examined the degree to which floral sonication behaviour was
   modified by experience. We found that the key elements of the sonication
   motor routine appeared in full-blown form in a flower-naive bee's first
   visit to a flower. We additionally found consistent, albeit modest,
   effects of experience on certain aspects of sonication behaviour. The
   latency to sonicate slightly decreased with experience. Bees also
   adjusted the length and amplitude of their sonication buzzes in response
   to pollen receipt. We conclude that the role of experience in foraging
   for concealed pollen rewards is different from that reported for nectar
   rewards. We offer an alternative explanation for its function in
   sonication. Finally, we discuss alternative hypotheses for the function
   of poricidal anthers and for how pollen-bearing plants may ensure floral
   fidelity even in the absence of a significant impact of experience on
   pollen extraction behaviour. (C) 2016 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Attraction of mutualists and defense against antagonists are critical
   challenges for most organisms and can be especially acute for plants
   with pollinating and non-pollinating flower visitors. Secondary
   compounds in flowers have been hypothesized to adaptively mediate
   attraction of mutualists and defense against antagonists, but this
   hypothesis has rarely been tested. The tissues of milkweeds (Asclepias
   spp.) contain toxic cardenolides that have long been studied as chemical
   defenses against herbivores. Milkweed nectar also contains cardenolides,
   and we have examined the impact of manipulating cardenolides in nectar
   on the foraging choices of two flower visitors: generalist bumble bees,
   Bombus impatiens, which are mutualistic pollinators, and specialist
   monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus, which are herbivores as larvae
   and ineffective pollinators as adults. Although individual bumble bees
   in single foraging bouts showed no avoidance of cardenolides at the
   highest natural concentrations reported for milkweeds, a pattern of
   deterrence did arise when entire colonies were allowed to forage for
   several days. Monarch butterflies were not deterred by the presence of
   cardenolides in nectar when foraging from flowers, but laid fewer eggs
   on plants paired with cardenolide-laced flowers compared to controls.
   Thus, although deterrence of bumble bees by cardenolides may only occur
   after extensive foraging, a primary effect of nectar cardenolides
   appears to be reduction of monarch butterfly oviposition.}},

Abstract = {{Much research debates whether properties of ecological networks such as
   nestedness and connectance stabilise biological communities while
   ignoring key behavioural aspects of organisms within these networks.
   Here, we computationally assess how adaptive foraging (AF) behaviour
   interacts with network architecture to determine the stability of
   plant-pollinator networks. We find that AF reverses negative effects of
   nestedness and positive effects of connectance on the stability of the
   networks by partitioning the niches among species within guilds. This
   behaviour enables generalist pollinators to preferentially forage on the
   most specialised of their plant partners which increases the pollination
   services to specialist plants and cedes the resources of generalist
   plants to specialist pollinators. We corroborate these behavioural
   preferences with intensive field observations of bee foraging. Our
   results show that incorporating key organismal behaviours with
   well-known biological mechanisms such as consumer-resource interactions
   into the analysis of ecological networks may greatly improve our
   understanding of complex ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Could honeybees' most valuable contribution to mankind besides
   pollination services be alternative tools against infections? Today, due
   to the emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens, we are facing a new era
   of searching for alternative tools against infections. Natural products
   such as honey have been applied against human's infections for millennia
   without sufficient scientific evidence. A unique lactic acid bacterial
   (LAB) microbiota was discovered by us, which is in symbiosis with
   honeybees and present in large amounts in fresh honey across the world.
   This work investigates if the LAB symbionts are the source to the
   unknown factors contributing to honey's properties. Hence, we tested the
   LAB against severe wound pathogens such as methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) among others. We demonstrate a
   strong antimicrobial activity from each symbiont and a synergistic
   effect, which counteracted all the tested pathogens. The mechanisms of
   action are partly shown by elucidating the production of active
   compounds such as proteins, fatty acids, anaesthetics, organic acids,
   volatiles and hydrogen peroxide. We show that the symbionts produce a
   myriad of active compounds that remain in variable amounts in mature
   honey. Further studies are now required to investigate if these
   symbionts have a potential in clinical applications as alternative tools
   against topical human and animal infections.}},

   Honeybees and bumblebees have strong preferences for `blue' stimuli, and

   Currently, however, there is a paucity of data on the innate colour

   In controlled laboratory conditions, we tested the innate colour

Abstract = {{Ecology studies often require large datasets. The benefits of citizen
   science for collecting such datasets include the extension of spatial
   and temporal scales, and cost reduction. In classical citizen science,
   citizens collect data and send them directly to scientists. This may not
   be possible for the many biological groups for which specimen
   identification is difficult and requires high-level expertise. Here we
   report the results of an expert-assisted citizen science program where
   teachers from 20 French agricultural high schools collected bees, which
   were identified to species level by a panel of expert bee taxonomists.
   Overall the dataset included 70 collections (year x sampling site
   combinations) that resulted in 4574 specimens belonging to 195 species.
   We analysed this dataset using data freely available at a national scale
   on agriculture intensity and landscape composition. We found that
   species richness increased with increasing proportion of herbaceous
   semi-natural elements; species dominance decreased with increasing crop
   diversity; the proportion of above ground nesting species and specimens
   increased as the intensity of agricultural practices decreased.
   Comparing the results obtained with identification to species level and
   those obtained with higher taxa or parataxonomic approaches, we found
   that the loss of taxonomic resolution resulted in the non-significance
   of some results on the effects of environmental variables on bee
   assemblage-level attributes. Our study suggests that identification to
   species level is of great importance to detect the effects of global
   change on bees and that an expert-assisted citizen science paradigm
   could provide relevant results to guide conservation measures at a

Abstract = {{1. Citizen science, the involvement of volunteers in collecting of
   scientific data, can be a useful research tool. However, data collected
   by volunteers are often of lower quality than those collected by
   professional scientists.
   2. We studied the accuracy with which the volunteers identified insects
   visiting ivy (Hedera) flowers in Sussex, England. In the first
   experiment, we examined the effects of training method, volunteer
   background and prior experience. Fifty-three participants were trained
   for the same duration using one of three different methods (pamphlet,
   pamphlet + slide show or pamphlet + direct training). Almost immediately
   following training, we tested the ability of the participants to
   identify live insects on ivy flowers to one of 10 taxonomic categories
   and recorded whether their identifications were correct or incorrect,
   without providing feedback.
   3. The results showed that the type of training method had a significant
   effect on identification accuracy (P = 0.008). Participants identified
   79.1\% of insects correctly after using a one-page colour pamphlet,
   85.6\% correctly after using the pamphlet and viewing a slide show and
   94.3\% correctly after using the pamphlet in combination with direct
   training in the field.
   4. As direct training cannot be delivered remotely, in the following
   year we conducted a second experiment, in which a different sample of 26
   volunteers received the pamphlet plus slide show training repeatedly
   three times. Moreover, in this experiment, participants received c. 2
   min of additional training material, either videos of insects or stills
   taken from the videos. Testing showed that identification accuracy
   increased from 88.6\% to 91.3\% to 97.5\% across the three successive
   tests. We also found a borderline significant interaction between the
   type of additional material and the test number (P = 0.053), such that
   the video gave fewer errors than stills in the first two tests only.
   5. The most common errors made by volunteers were misidentifications of
   honeybees and social wasps with their hover fly mimics. We also tested
   six experts who achieved nearly perfect accuracy (99.8\%), which shows
   what is possible in practice.
   6. Overall, our study shows that two or three sessions of remote
   training can be as good as one of direct training, even for relatively
   challenging taxonomic discriminations that include distinguishing models
   and mimics.}},

Abstract = {{Classification and evolutionary studies of particularly speciose clades
   pose important challenges, as phylogenetic analyses typically sample a
   small proportion of the existing diversity. We examine here one of the
   largest bee genera, the genus Megachile - the dauber and leafcutting
   bees. Besides presenting a phylogeny based on five nuclear genes (5480
   aligned nucleotide positions), we attempt to use the phylogenetic signal
   of mitochondria] DNA barcodes, which are rapidly accumulating and
   already include a substantial proportion of the known species diversity
   in the genus. We used barcodes in two ways: first, to identify
   particularly divergent lineages and thus to guide taxon sampling in our
   nuclear phylogeny; second, to augment taxon sampling by combining
   nuclear markers (as backbone for ancient divergences) with DNA barcodes.
   Our results indicate that DNA barcodes bear phylogenetic signal limited
   to very recent divergences (3-4 my before present). Sampling within
   clades of very closely related species may be augmented using this
   technique, but our results also suggest statistically supported, but
   incongruent placements of some taxa. However, the addition of one single
   nuclear gene (LW-rhodopsin) to the DNA barcode data was enough to
   recover meaningful placement with high Glade support values for nodes up
   to 15 million years old. We discuss different proposals for the generic
   classification of the tribe Megachilini. Finding a classification that
   is both in agreement with our phylogenetic hypotheses and practical in
   terms of diagnosability is particularly challenging as our analyses
   recover several well supported clades that include morphologically
   heterogeneous lineages. We favour a classification that recognizes seven
   morphologically well-delimited genera in Megachilini: Coelioxys,
   Gronoceras, Heriadopsis, Matangapis, Megachile, Noteriades and
   Radoszkowskiana. Our results also lead to the following classification
   changes: the groups known as Dinavis, Neglectella, Ewymeda and
   Phaenosarus are reestablished as valid subgenera of the genus Megachile,
   while the subgenus Alocanthedon is placed in synonymy with M.
   (Callomegachile), the subgenera Parachalicodoma and Largella with M.
   (Pseudomegachile), Anodonteutricharaea with M. (Paracella), Platysta
   with M. (Eurymella), and Grosapis and Eumegachile with M. (Megachile)
   (new synonymies). In addition, we use maximum likelihood reconstructions
   of ancestral geographic ranges to infer the origin of the tribe and
   reconstruct the main dispersal routes explaining the current,
   cosmopolitan distribution of this genus. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Little is known regarding pollination webs involving island coastal
   plants and pollinators, and roles that nonnative flower visitors may
   play in these interaction networks. Plant-pollinator observations made
   in March 2008 and 2009 were used to describe the pollination network for
   Ka'ena Point, one of Hawai'i's best-conserved coastal communities. The
   network includes 15 native plant species, two native bee species, and 26
   nonnative insect taxa, forming 119 interactions. Network connectance is
   29.4\% and weighted nestedness is 17.9, which are similar to values of
   other dry-habitat, island networks. The network's structure has a core
   of generalized pollinators plus several more-specialized pollinators.
   Nearly all plant species interact with two or more generalist
   pollinators and a variable number of specialists. Small, nonnative bees
   (Lasioglossum, Ceratina), wasps (Proconura), and flies (mostly
   Tachinidae) were responsible for 72.7\% of flower visits, and they visit
   five plant species not visited by native bees. The two native visitors
   were the bees Hylaeus anthracinus and H. longiceps (both proposed as
   endangered). Hylaeus spp. (especially females) provided 19.8\% of flower
   visits, foraging at high visitation rates and on many species, including
   the endangered Scaevola coriacea and Sesbania tomentosa. In Hawai'i's
   coastal habitat, nonnative insects form novel interactions with native
   species and may maintain an ecosystem's function following loss of most
   of the original native pollinators. However, their high visitation rates
   suggest that the two remaining native Hylaeus species are potentially
   important pollinators for many of the native plants on which they rely
   for nectar and pollen resources.}},

Abstract = {{Larger floral displays increase pollinator visitation as well as
   among-flower self-pollination (geitonogamy) in self-compatible species.
   Dichogamy (temporal separation of gender expression) can limit
   geitonogamy and increase outcrossing but this depends on pollinator
   behavior within inflorescences. Declining nectar volume from lower to
   upper flowers is a hypothesized adaptation to increase outcrossing and
   pollen export by encouraging the upward movment of pollinators from
   female to male flowers and by reducing the number of flowers probed per
   inflorescence, but supporting evidence has been equivocal. We tested
   this hypothesis in Aconitum gymnandrum by studying floral display and
   rewards, pollinator visitation, and pollinator-mediated selection on
   floral traits. We found that larger inflorescences of A. gymnandrum
   attracted more pollinators, but did not increase the number of flowers
   probed per visit. Nectar production declined with increasing flower
   height on average, but the opposite pattern was also common. Bumblebees
   responded strongly to the nectar pattern, moving from higher to lower
   nectar concentration. Finally, there was significant pollinator-mediated
   direct selection for this pattern of declining nectar volume after
   correcting for correlations with flower size, number, and mean nectar
   volume. Together, the results strongly suggest that declining nectar
   production in higher flowers is an adaptation to enhance outcrossing in
   A. gymnandrum.}},

   calcitic casts of numerous plant trichomes-a nesting behaviour unique to
   the modern-day carder bees (Anthidiini). The presence of Celliforma

   indicative of a dry, savannah environment, in agreement with recent work
   on the palaeoenvironment of Plio-Pleistocene southern Africa. Moreover,
   the occurrence of ground-nesting bees provides furtherevidence that the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to describe the mature larvae of all taxa
   of the tribe Osmiini (Megachilidae) whose postdefecating larvae have
   been collected and are available. The hope is that data uncovered will
   eventually lead to a better understanding of the interrelationships of
   included taxa and of their anatomies, behaviors, and ecologies (i.e.,
   their natural histories). The species included are representatives of
   the following taxa: Ashmeadiella, Atoposmia, Chelostoma, Heriades,
   Hoplitis, and Osmia (Hoplosmia). We also include recently described
   larval representatives of Haetosmia and Ochreriades. Because of its
   large size and diversity, the genus Osmia alone (with the exception of
   the subgenus Hoplosmia) is allocated to a separate future investigation.
   Larvae of the tribe share many features with one another and also with
   other members of the Megachilidae. Anatomical structures of larval
   Osmiini whereby they can be differentiated from other megachilids were
   not identified. However, most (though not all) members of the tribe fall
   into one of three main subgroups on the basis of: (1) body form, (2)
   presence or absence of middorsal, intersegmental tubercles on basal
   abdominal segments 1-5, and (3) the depth of intersegmental
   constrictions.
   In the process of gathering specimens the authors uncovered new
   information concerning nesting biology with respect to nest location and
   structure and to cocoon structure and function. These data were derived
   from the authors' own field studies as well as from specimens and field
   data collected through the years by others.}},

Title = {{Total Bee Dependence on One Flower Species Despite Available Congeners

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 22}},
Abstract = {{Extreme specialization is a common phenomenon in antagonistic biotic
   interactions but it is quite rare in mutualistic ones. Indeed, bee
   specialization on a single flower species (monolecty) is a questioned
   fact. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence on true monolecty in a
   solitary bee (Flavipanurgus venustus, Andrenidae), which is consistent
   across space (18 sites in SW Iberian Peninsula) and time (three years)
   despite the presence of closely related congeneric plant species whose
   flowers are morphologically similar. The host flower (Cistus crispus,
   Cistaceae) is in turn a supergeneralist, visited by at least 85 insect
   species. We uncover ultraviolet light reflectance as a distinctive
   visual cue of the host flower, which can be a key mechanism because bee
   specialization has an innate basis to recognize specific signals.
   Moreover, we hypothesized that a total dependence on an ephemeral
   resource (i.e. one flower species) must lead to spatiotemporal matching
   with it. Accordingly, we prove that the bee's flight phenology is
   synchronized with the blooming period of the host flower, and that the
   densities of bee populations mirror the local densities of the host
   flower. This case supports the `predictable plethora' hypothesis, that
   is, that host-specialization in bees is fostered by plant species
   providing predictably abundant floral resources. Our findings, along
   with available phylogenetic information on the genus Cistus, suggest the
   importance of historical processes and cognitive constraints as drivers
   of specialization in bee-plant interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bees, especially ground-nesting species, are important for crop
   pollination. However, the extent to which regular disturbance, such as
   tillage, impacts ground-nesting bees is poorly known. We conducted a
   two-year tillage experiment on the squash bee, Peponapispruinosa (Say),
   to quantify how tillage impacted offspring survival, offspring sex
   ratio, and timing of emergence. We established P. pruinosa nests in
   twenty 3 m by 3 m cages and then randomly assigned a tillage treatment
   to half of those cages. The following summer we trapped emerging
   offspring. We used a Bayesian framework to analyse the data. Offspring
   emergence varied greatly, but there was modest evidence that tillage
   reduced offspring emergence in treatment cages. There was limited
   evidence that tillage reduced the proportion of male bees emerging into
   cages, suggesting that tillage did not impact sex ratio. There was
   strong evidence that tillage delayed emergence of surviving offspring.
   Tillage practices should be considered when managing fields for this
   ground nesting bee. However, even disturbed squash fields may contribute
   to this species' persistence in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Natural and semi-natural habitats within agricultural landscapes provide
   food and nesting resources for wild bees, thus promoting crop
   pollination services. In central Spain, a large network of drove roads
   (DRs) crosses extensive areas of intensive agricultural fields. DRs are
   tracks (20-75 m wide) with semi-natural vegetation, protected for their
   priority function of transhumant livestock herding. In this study, we
   analyse the bee community of one of the main, Spanish DRs, and evaluate
   its effects on flower visitation and seed set in adjacent sunflower
   fields. We used pan traps to assess bee abundance and richness at 13
   sites along the DR and in adjacent sunflower fields at 10, 75 and 150m
   from the DR. We also conducted visual counts to assess visitation rates
   to sunflower heads and measured seed set. Wild bee abundance and
   richness were significantly higher in the DR than in sunflower fields;
   but there were no significant differences among distances within
   sunflower fields. Honey bee abundance did not differ between the DR and
   sunflower fields. Wild bee visitation to sunflower heads was higher at
   10 m compared to 75 and 150 m from the DR, but differences in honey bee
   visitation were non-significant. Sunflower seed set was significantly
   higher at 10 m compared to 75 and 150 m, and was associated with wild
   bee abundance, but not with honey bee abundance. Our results show that
   livestock DRs act as reservoirs of wild bee diversity within intensive
   agricultural matrices, enhancing wild bee visitation and seed set in
   adjacent sunflower crops. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Landing is an important but understudied behavior that flying animals
   must perform constantly. In still air, insects decelerate smoothly prior
   to landing by employing the relatively simple strategy of maintaining a
   constant rate of image expansion during their approach. However, it is
   unclear whether insects employ this strategy when faced with challenging
   flight environments. Here, we tested the effects of wind on bumblebees
   (Bombus impatiens) landing on flowers. We find that bees' approach paths
   to flowers shift from multidirectional in still air to unidirectional in
   wind, regardless of flower orientation. In addition, bees landing in a
   3.5 m s(-1) headwind do not decelerate smoothly, but rather maintain a
   high flight speed until contact, resulting in higher peak decelerations
   upon impact. These findings suggest that wind has a strong influence on
   insect landing behavior and performance, with important implications for
   the design of micro aerial vehicles and the ecomechanics of insect
   flight.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of pollinator-dependent crops, especially in the

   reliant on pollination services for food supply often live in regions
   where our knowledge of pollination services is poor. In a manipulative
   experiment replicated at 23 sites across an Ethiopian agricultural
   landscape, we found poor pollination services and severe pollen
   limitation in a common oil crop. With supplementary pollination, the
   yield increased on average by 91\%. Despite the heterogeneous
   agricultural matrix, we found a low bee abundance, which may explain
   poor pollination services. The variation in pollen limitation was
   unrelated to surrounding forest cover, local bee richness and bee
   abundance. While practices that commonly increase pollinators
   (restricted pesticide use, flower strips) are an integral part of the
   landscape, these elements are apparently insufficient. Management to

Abstract = {{Most species of Solanum L. (Solanaceae) exhibit a floral morphology
   typical of the genus: Yellow poricidal anthers with rigid walls
   contrasting in color with the corolla. However, some species of Solanum
   sect. Cyphomandropsis differ from most of the other species of Solanum
   by having flowers without contrasting colors and large anthers with
   flexible walls. These features resemble those of some closely related
   species belonging to Solanum sect. Pachyphylla that exhibit a bellows
   pollination mechanism whereby male euglossine bees cause the compression
   of thin anther walls and trigger pneumatic pollen release without
   vibration. Herein we studied the reproductive and pollination biology of
   a population of Solanum luridifuscescens (sect. Cyphomandropsis), a
   species with purple corolla and anthers, expecting to find a bellows
   mechanism of pollination. Both artificial mechanical stimuli applied
   with forceps and vibrations transmitted with an electric toothbrush
   resulted in the release of pollen from the anthers. Females of six
   species of bees visited the flowers and vibrated the anthers to collect
   pollen. Only one male euglossine bee visited the flowers, without
   causing pollen release. Solanum luridifuscescens exhibits pollen flower
   characteristics that are common among species of Solanum, such as the
   absence of nectar and the presence of poricidal anthers that release dry
   pollen by vibration. However, it also exhibits features that resemble
   mature anthers of perfume flowers typical of Solanum sect. Pachyphylla,
   such as a dorsally developed connective covered with purple papillae
   that do not contrast with the corolla plus flexible anther walls that
   are two or three cell layers thick on the lateral and ventral surfaces.
   Despite this distinct anther morphology, pollen of the flowers of S.
   luridifuscescens was removed exclusively by female bees using a typical
   vibratory mechanism. Morphological traits alone, thus, are not
   sufficient to predict the pollination mechanism of species of Solanum.

   to evaluate how urban expansion on campus has influenced the Meliponini

Abstract = {{Few studies have addressed the use of overnight substrate by congeneric
   bee species, although sleeping bees with other insect taxa or other bee
   families have been found to share the same substrates. We observed the
   sleeping aggregations of two sympatric bees, Amegilla florea urens and
   A. senahai senahai, to determine whether they shared the same substrates
   for sleeping on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Many
   sleeping aggregations were found in broad-leaved deciduous forests and
   were patchily distributed along a pathway in broad-leaved evergreen
   forests in June for 2 years. Overnight aggregations formed on the leaves
   of monocotyledons or the fine roots of trees exposed on the slope of a
   bare cliff along the edge of the pathway. Neither species showed
   preference for any particular substrates. Over 2 years, we found 1 A. f.
   urens male aggregation, 6 A. s. senahai male aggregations, and 88 A. f.
   urens female aggregations. A sleeping site with aggregations of both
   Amegilla bee species was observed only once. Although no physical
   contact or mating approaches among sleeping individuals in each species
   were observed during the night, conspecific individuals slept close to
   other individuals in the aggregation. We suggest that single species
   aggregation would have an advantage for conspecifics to increase the
   night survival rate by sharing information such as predator attack.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plant species differ greatly in the
   three-dimensional arrangements of their flowers (inflorescence
   architecture). However, the nature of selection responsible for this
   diversity is poorly understood. Studies that examine among-species
   variation suggest that inflorescence architecture affects pollinator
   behaviour, and so should influence plant mating. However, few studies
   consider the consequences of within-population architectural variation
   for pollinator behaviour.
   Methods We manipulated inflorescence architecture of Delphinium glaucum
   to contrast bumblebee responses to normal and one-sided (secund)
   inflorescences.
   Key Results The `dimensionality' of manipulated inflorescences did not
   affect the number of flowers that bees visited; however, bees moved
   upward proportionally more on secund inflorescences.
   Conclusions This study shows that realistic within-population variation
   in inflorescence architecture can manipulate pollinator behaviour. These
   results bear important consequences for plant mating success and the
   coordinated evolution of inflorescence architecture and floral
   specialization within inflorescences. These results also question why
   secund inflorescences are rare, for which we propose four testable

Abstract = {{The Neotropical bee Centris (Hemisiella) dichrootricha is a solitary bee
   that nests in pre-existing cavities that occur in the rain forest. This
   study describes the nesting biology of C. dichrootricha and its
   preference for nesting in Cerrado and gallery forest habitats. The study
   was conducted from January 2012 and December 2013, in Mirador State Park
   in the municipality of Formosa da Serra Negra, Maranhao State, Brazil.
   For this, wooden trap-nests of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 mm in diameter
   were used; a total of 300 trap-nests were placed in the gallery forest
   and Cerrado areas, respectively. Traps were monitored monthly and all
   completed nests were collected and replaced with empty ones. The nests
   were then taken to the laboratory to analyze bee development and
   emergence, nests characteristics and parasites presence. The species
   used 29 of the trap-nests, which had diameters of 8, 10, 12 and 14 mm. A
   total of 87 C. dichrootricha specimens emerged. The nests were
   parasitized by two bee species, Mesocheira bicolor (Apinae) and
   Coelioxys sp. (Megachilinae), and one fly species, Antrax sp. (Diptera).
   The highest nesting incidence of 72.4 \% was observed in the gallery
   forest, whereas only 27.6 \% in the Cerrado; this difference in habitat
   use was significant (chi(2) = 5.56; p < 0.05; DF = 1). For the nests
   that were built in the gallery forest, 80.9\% of the soil originated
   from the Cerrado. The females were significantly larger than the males
   (F-1,F- 76 = 595.19; p < 0.001). There were 11 pollen types that
   belonged to six families. Pollen of the family Malpighiaceae was most
   frequently used, with four species represented (Byrsonima crassifolia,
   B. rotunda, B. spicata and Heteropterys sp.). C. dichrootricha showed a
   preference for nesting in cavities of various diameters in gallery
   forest sites. The present study provides a novel description of the
   nesting habits and biology of C. dichrootricha in habitats of
   Central/Southern Maranhao. C. dichrootricha primarily used resources
   from the Cerrado, including soil to build their nests, pollen and floral
   oils; we concluded that gallery forest and Cerrado areas are
   intrinsically related to the maintenance of local populations of this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Thygater aethiops is a native bee that can be found in parks and gardens
   in diverse urban areas such as those in the city of Bogota (Colombia).
   However, little is known about its biology as well as ecological
   adaptations to urban areas. This study aimed to describe the seasonal
   cycle and daily foraging activities of T. aethiops, as well as identify
   the pollen resources used by this bee over a year in a population
   nesting in an aggregation in the ``Parque Nacional Enrique Olaya
   Herrera{''} in Bogota. Changes in the nest activity were monitored
   weekly by counting the number of active nests in the aggregation between
   December/2012 and February/2014. To determine the daily foraging
   activity, the numbers of bees entering their nests over a period of 10
   minutes every hour between 8: 00 and 14: 00 h were recorded. Females
   with pollen loads entering to their nest were captured weekly, between
   September/2012 and August/2013, and their pollen loads analyzed. Three
   nesting peaks occurred after the precipitation peaks, but the number of
   active nests was not correlated with precipitation. The nesting
   activities stopped in a large number of the active nests (20-50 \% of
   nests) after an anthropic disturbance was registered in the nesting
   area. Bees forage for nectar and pollen between 8: 00 and 14: 00 h, with
   a peak at 10: 00 h. Daily foraging activity changed during the study
   period due to anthropic disturbance. There was not a significant
   relationship between air temperature and the number of females entering
   their nests. Foraging activities did not change between the dry and
   rainy seasons. A total of 26 pollen types were found in 169 pollen
   loads. Ulex europaeus (Fabaceae) and Solanum laxum (Solanaceae) were the
   most abundant plants represented on the pollen load across the study
   period. According to these results, T. aethiops would be considered a
   mesolectic species. The ability of T. aethiops to use different pollen
   resources both native and exotic, as well as to presumably recover its
   population after disturbances, are characteristics that may have allowed
   this bee to adapt to urban environments. Knowledge on the floral
   resources as well as other biological features of this bee species is
   important to promote its conservation in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Wild and managed bees provide critical pollination services to both
   native and cultivated plants, and the invasion of exotic plants can have
   positive or negative effects on bee communities. In this study we
   investigated the influence of the exotic invasive Centaurea stoebe ssp.
   micranthos (spotted knapweed) On bee species diversity and abundance in
   old-fields (Michigan, USA). We conducted field observations in knapweed
   dominated fields and adjacent fields with greater forb diversity to
   determine whether the bee communities foraging in each field type
   differed in their composition, diversity, and abundance, and to
   determine how bees' use of floral resources changed throughout the
   growing season. This was coupled with a common garden experiment that
   contrasted the attractiveness of C. stoebe to 12 native plant species,
   which occur in similar habitats, Both studies were conducted throughout
   the 2012-2013 growing seasons to examine the temporal effect of floral
   resource availability. C stoebe was the most heavily-visited plant, in
   terms of total bee visitation and bee species richness in both studies.
   While C. stoebe-dominated old-fields had high floral resource levels
   during its peak bloom period, before and after this period these fields
   contained very few floral resources. In contrast, diverse fields had a
   number of flowering plant species that provided floral resources before,
   during, and after C. stoebe bloom. As a result, diverse fields contained
   significantly greater season-long floral resource availability and
   significantly greater season-total bee abundance, diversity and species
   richness. This greater species richness was driven at least in part by
   the ability of diverse flowering plant communities to support bee
   species that are active before and after the bloom period of C. stoebe.
   Our results suggest that efforts in manage C. stoebe should take into
   account the floral resources the plant is providing, and coincide with
   the restoration of diverse forb communities in order to enhance bee
   foraging-habitat in old-fields.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{177}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Premise of research. The primarily Neotropical Malpighiaceae exhibit an
   elegant suite of floral morphological characteristics associated with a
   specialized mutualism with oil bee pollinators, including bilaterally
   symmetrical flowers and paired oil glands on the calyx. One clade within
   the family, Hiptage Gaertn., has migrated to the paleotropics and lost
   its association with oil bees. Corresponding to this transition, some
   members of Hiptage have evolved a highly elaborate zygomorphic corolla
   with strongly reflexed petals and striking dorsoventral heteranthery.
   Previously, we demonstrated that expression of CYCLOIDEA2-like
   (CYC2-like) genes is correlated with the evolution of floral symmetry in
   Malpighiaceae. Here, we examine CYC2 expression in relation to the
   evolution of elaborate floral zygomorphy in Hiptage benghalensis.
   Methodology. CYC2-like genes were cloned from H. benghalensis. The
   spatial pattern of CYC2 expression was examined with quantitative
   reverse-transcription PCR on the dissected floral organs.
   Pivotal results. While most Neotropical Malpighiaceae express two
   CYC2-like genes, CYC2A and CYC2B, we demonstrate that H. benghalensis
   has experienced further duplications yielding four copies, which are
   expressed in all four whorls of the flower. As in Neotropical
   Malpighiaceae, CYC2A homologs HbCYC2A-1 and HbCYC2A-2 are expressed
   broadly in the dorsal region of the flower, but unlike that in other
   Neotropical species, expression also extends to the dorsal stamens. The
   CYC2B copies HbCYC2B-1 and HbCYC2B-2 are intensely expressed in the
   single dorsal petal ( as in Neotropical Malpighiaceae), but their
   expression is further detected in the other floral whorls, especially in
   the stamens of the dorsal region.
   Conclusions. The relaxation of the conserved expression of CYC2-like
   genes in Neotropical Malpighiaceae and the expansion to broader floral
   regions, including the dorsal androecium, correlate with the development
   of dorsoventral heteranthery in H. benghalensis. We propose that changes
   in the pattern of CYC2 expression may have contributed to the elaborated
   androecium of H. benghalensis, which was crucial for its adaptation to a
   novel pollination strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Context In modern agricultural landscapes, fragmentation of partial
   habitats is a significant filter for multi-habitat users, reducing local
   taxonomic and functional diversity. There is compelling evidence that
   small species are more susceptible than large species. The impact of
   habitat fragmentation on intraspecific body-size distribution, however,
   is yet unexplored.
   Objectives We tested habitat fragmentation, a major driver of pollinator
   loss, for its impact on intraspecific body-size distributions of
   solitary wild-bee species. Subsequently, we tested individual body size
   for its impact on pollination services.
   Methods We sampled 1272 individuals of the four most common Andrena wild
   bee species in 22 newly established flowering fields (0.21-0.41 ha) in
   Hessen, Central Germany, over two consecutive years. Study sites were
   located in a ca. 80 ha landscape context of increasing habitat
   fragmentation. We analysed the pollen loads of the most abundant
   species.
   Results Body size within local populations of the two medium-sized bees
   increased with fragmentation, suggesting intraspecific selection for
   higher dispersal capacity. Pollen analysis carried out for the most
   common species revealed that larger individuals visited a significantly
   smaller plant spectrum. Habitat fragmentation may thus alter pollination
   services without necessarily affecting species richness or composition.
   Conclusions Systematic body-size variation at the population level thus
   explains the considerable variability between simple community measures
   and ecosystem functioning. Filtering processes at the individual level
   require increased understanding for targeting pollination services under
   current and future land-use change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Restrictions on the use of neonicotinoid insecticides in the European
   Union are widely debated in relation to bee decline, but their potential
   consequences at the interface between sustainable crop production and
   conservation are less frequently discussed.
   2. This paper raises issues to be considered if we are to achieve a
   balanced consensus in this contentious area.
   3. The common legal framework governing testing and environmental impact
   for all chemical crop protection products is highlighted, leading to
   concerns that the current focus on impact of neonicotinoids is diverting
   attention from other drivers of bee decline to the detriment of a
   balanced conservation strategy.
   4. The evidence for the causal relationship between neonicotinoid use
   and bee decline is considered and information gaps requiring further
   work identified.
   5. How research into the parallel use of pesticides and beneficial
   invertebrates in integrated pest management (IPM) can inform the
   pollinator debate is highlighted. The importance of the neonicotinoids
   in major IPM systems is illustrated, leading to discussion of potential
   consequences for conservation of biodiversity and sustainable crop
   protection if they were lost and we revert to reliance on other pest
   management options.
   6. Increasing agricultural production and conservation are sometimes
   viewed as being contradictory and the paper concludes by calling for a
   broadening of the discussion to consider the complimentary objectives of
   bee conservation and sustainable crop production, so that advances in
   both fields can hasten consensus on the way forward, rather than
   perpetuating the current rather polarised debate.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination is a critical ecosystem function with high ecological and
   economic value. Conservation initiatives aimed at protecting diverse
   pollinator communities in natural and agricultural habitats are
   essential, but the implementation and success of such initiatives often
   depends on public support.
   2. Mass media play an important role in building public awareness around
   environmental issues, and biased coverage can have damaging effects.
   Here, we present the first analysis of how Australian mainstream media
   present the `pollinator' paradigm. We gathered insect pollinator and
   pollination related articles from major Australian online newspapers
   published over a period of 9 years, and performed a qualitative content
   analysis using deductive coding to record information on the pollinator
   species or groups discussed in the story.
   3. We found 151 stories, and demonstrate that within these, there was a
   disproportionate focus on introduced European honey bees as the most
   important, or only, pollinator insect relevant to Australia. Only 15\%
   of stories mentioned native bees as pollinators and 17\% mentioned
   non-bee pollinators.
   4. There is potential that the trend we report here for pollinators may
   be indicative of a larger overall simplification and neglect of
   biodiversity concepts in mainstream media, both in Australia and
   globally. As public awareness of science and environmental issues partly
   depend on disseminating accurate information beyond the scholar network,
   it is imperative that the broader effects of inaccurate science

Abstract = {{It remains unclear how related co-flowering species with shared
   pollinators minimize reproductive interference, given that the degree of
   interspecific pollen flow and its consequences are little known in
   natural communities. Differences in pollen size in six Pedicularis
   species with different style lengths permit us to measure heterospecific
   pollen transfer (HPT) between species pairs in sympatry. The role of
   pollen-pistil interactions in mitigating the effects of HPT was
   examined. Field observations over 2yr showed that bumblebee pollinators
   visiting one species rarely moved to another. Heterospecific pollen (HP)
   comprised <10\% of total stigmatic pollen loads for each species over
   2yr, and was not related to conspecific pollen deposition. Species with
   longer styles generally received more HP per stigma. The pollen tube
   study showed that pollen from short-styled species could not grow the
   full length of the style of long-styled species. Pollen from long-styled
   species could grow through the short style of P.densispica, but
   P.densispica rarely received HP in nature. Flower constancy is a key
   pre-pollination barrier to HPT between co-flowering Pedicularis species.
   Post-pollination pollen-pistil interactions may further mitigate the
   effects of HPT because HP transferred to long styles could generally be
   effectively filtered.}},

   radius of 1 and 3.5 km, respectively. Possibly, continuous food
   resources provided by natural forest areas favor colony establishment

   Also, pollinator dependent crop area can generate a ``transient dilution

   disadvantages of intensive and inappropriate use of pesticides have
   stimulated the search for more selective and less harmful agrochemicals.
   Thus, we have evaluated the effectiveness of 16 synthetic molecules
   (phthalides and precursors) to control the melonworm Diaphania
   hyalinata, a key pest in cucurbit crops of economic importance in
   Brazil. The selectivity to beneficial organisms Solenopsis saevissima
   and Tetragonisca angustula and the phytotoxicity to Cucumis sativus of
   the promising insecticides were also assessed.
   RESULTSIn the screening assay, compounds 1 and 6 provided 91 and 88\%
   mortality of the melonworm. Compound 1 presented higher toxicity (median
   lethal dose LD50 = 15.99 mu mol g(-1)) and higher speed on pest control
   (median survival time LT50 = 420 min) than compound 6 (LD50 = 44.51 mu
   mol g(-1) and LT50 = 840 min). Both compounds inhibited less than 11\%
   of host-plant growth and caused 36 and 93\% mortality of predator and
   pollinator respectively.
   CONCLUSIONAmong the tested compounds, only compounds 1 and 6 were
   effective in melonworm control. Both compounds presented no considerable
   phytotoxicity and were selective to predator but non-selective to
   pollinator, which enables their application for pest control if the
   exposure of the bees is minimised. (c) 2015 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{In order to make agriculture more sustainable it is important to enhance
   the natural processes supporting crop production, including pollination
   and pest control. The distance over which these services are delivered
   into the crop (referred to as spill-over) sets limitations on
   biodiversity mediated agriculture sustainability. We assess how pest
   control of aphids on wheat (Rhopalosiphum padi) and pollinator linked
   yield gain in oilseed rape decline with distance from the crop edge. For
   natural pest control we also assess how field margin floristic diversity
   (simple grass vs. species-rich wildflower) affects pest control. We do
   not consider the impact of field margins on oilseed rape pollination as
   perennial dominated field margins are not in flower at the time of
   oilseed rape seed set and so do not act to attract pollinators. Aphid
   colonies exposed to invertebrate natural enemies went extinct at a
   faster rate than colonies where they were excluded. The rate of decline
   in per capita growth rates of aphid colonies was greatest when exposed
   to natural predators, with this effect being detected up to 50 m into
   the crop where species-rich field margins were present. While oilseed
   rape yield gains were correlated with pollinator (bees and flies)
   visitation rates, there was no evidence that yield gain declined with
   distance from the crop edge. Possibly this was due to honeybees showing
   no evidence of declining visitation rates with distance into the crop
   (over 200 m). This contrast with bumblebees, solitary bees and flies
   which showed evidence of declining visitation rates with distance from
   the crop edge. Our results suggests that for a typical arable field (c.
   12 ha) surrounded by species rich field margins, 50\% of the total area
   could benefit from enhanced pest control services. Increased yields of
   oilseed rape due to insect pollinators of c. 0.4 t ha(-1) were
   identified, but there was no evidence that field size would limit the
   spatial distribution of yields. Our results have implications for
   integrated crop management world-wide through the use of variable dose
   rate applications technologies that could be used to target pesticides
   to field centres and so help support biodiversity mediated ecosystem
   services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Private yards comprise a significant component of urban lands, with
   managed lawns representing the dominant land cover. Lawns blanket >
   163,000 km(2) of the United States, and 50\% of urban and suburban
   areas. When not treated with herbicides, lawns have the capacity to
   support a diversity of spontaneous (e.g., not planted) flowers, with the
   potential to provide nectar and pollen resources for pollinators such as
   native bees. In order to determine the extent to which suburban lawns
   support these important species, we surveyed lawns in 17 suburban yards
   in Springfield, MA, between May and September 2013 and 2014.
   Householders participating in the study did not apply chemical
   pesticides or herbicides to lawns for the duration of the study. We
   collected 5,331 individual bees, representing 111 species, and 29\% of
   bee species reported for the state. The majority of species were native
   to North America (94.6\%), nested in soil (73\%), and solitary (48.6\%).
   Species richness was lower for oligolectic (specialists on a single
   plant; 9.9\%) and parasitic species (12.6\%). Abundance percentages for
   number of individuals were similar. We documented 63 plant species in
   the lawns, the majority of which were not intentionally planted. The
   most abundant lawn flowers were dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and
   clover (Trifolium sp.). Nearly 30\% of the spontaneous plant species
   growing in the lawns were native to North America. Our study suggests
   that the spontaneous lawn flowers could be viewed as supplemental floral
   resources and support pollinators, thereby enhancing the value of urban

Abstract = {{1. Uncultivated field boundaries constitute a significant part of the
   remaining semi-natural habitat in simplified agricultural landscapes,
   providing habitats for many grassland species. In Europe,
   agri-environment schemes (AES) offer incentives to farmers to manage
   farmland more environmentally friendly. In Sweden, one AES has
   specifically targeted management of incidental habitats on farmland by
   promoting removal of woody vegetation to benefit cultural heritage and
   biodiversity.
   2. This study investigates if pollinating insects benefit from removal
   of woody vegetation and whether any such benefits depend on the
   structural complexity of the surrounding landscape. Using a nested study
   design, pollinator communities were compared in pairs of managed and
   unmanaged field boundaries in landscapes of different complexity.
   3. The effect of removing trees and bushes in field boundaries varied
   among pollinator groups. Bumblebee species richness and abundance
   benefited from the management, whereas the species richness of solitary
   bees and hoverflies were unaffected. The abundance of solitary bees was
   higher in managed field boundaries, but only late in the season in
   complex landscapes, while the same management lowered the hoverfly
   abundance particularly late in the season. Landscape complexity did not
   affect bumblebees, while the abundance of solitary bees and the species
   richness of hoverflies were positively correlated with increasing
   landscape complexity, but at different spatial scales.
   4. The contrasting effects of management on different organism groups
   shown in this study, illustrate the importance of studies conducted on
   multiple taxa. Management prescriptions based on results from one
   pollinator group may not benefit other pollinator groups.}},

Abstract = {{Native plant and beneficial insect associations are relatively unstudied
   yet are important in native habitat restoration programs for improving
   and sustaining conservation biological control of arthropod pests in
   agricultural crops. Milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) are currently the focus
   of restoration programs in the USA aimed at reversing a decline in
   populations of the milkweed-dependent monarch butterfly (Danaus
   plexippus); however, little is known of the benefits of these plants to
   other beneficial insects. Beneficial insects (predators, parasitoids,
   pollinators) attracted to two milkweed species (Asclepias speciosa,
   Asclepias fascicularis) in central Washington State, WA, USA were
   identified and counted on transparent sticky traps attached to blooms
   over five seasons. Combining all categories of beneficial insects, means
   of 128 and 126 insects per trap were recorded for A. speciosa and A.
   fascicularis, respectively. Predatory and parasitic flies dominated trap
   catches for A. speciosa while parasitic wasps were the most commonly
   trapped beneficial insects on A. fascicularis. Bees were trapped
   commonly on both species, especially A. speciosa with native bees
   trapped in significantly greater numbers than honey bees. Beneficial
   insect attraction to A. speciosa and A. fascicularis was substantial.
   Therefore, these plants are ideal candidates for habitat restoration,
   intended to enhance conservation biological control, and for pollinator
   conservation. In central Washington, milkweed restoration programs for
   enhancement of D. plexippus populations should also provide benefits for
   pest suppression and pollinator conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Context Anthropogenic landscape simplification and natural habitat loss
   can negatively affect wild bees. Alternatively, anthropogenic land-use
   change may diversify landscapes, creating complementary habitats that
   maintain overall resource continuity and diversity.
   Objectives We examined the effects of landscape composition, including
   land-cover diversity and percent semi-natural habitat, on wild bee
   abundance and species richness within apples, a pollinator-dependent
   crop. We also explored whether different habitats within diverse
   landscapes can provide complementary floral resources for bees across
   space and time.
   Methods We sampled bees during apple bloom over 2 years within 35
   orchards varying in surrounding landscape diversity and percent woodland
   (the dominant semi-natural habitat) at 1 km radii. To assess habitat
   complementarity in resource diversity and temporal continuity, we
   sampled flowers and bees within four unique habitats, including
   orchards, woodlands, semi-natural grasslands, and annual croplands, over
   three periods from April-June.
   Results Surrounding landscape diversity positively affected both wild
   bee abundance and richness within orchards during bloom. Habitats in
   diverse landscapes had different flower communities with varying
   phenologies; flowers were most abundant within orchards and woodlands in
   mid-spring, but then declined over time, while flowers within grasslands
   marginally increased throughout spring. Furthermore, bee communities
   were significantly different between the closed-canopy habitats,
   orchards and woodlands, and the open habitats, grasslands and annual
   croplands.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that diverse landscapes, such as ones
   with both open (grassland) and closed (woodland) semi-natural habitats,
   support spring wild bees by providing flowers throughout the entire
   foraging period and diverse niches to meet different species'
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{We studied biotically pollinated angiosperms on Macquarie Island, a
   remote site in the Southern Ocean with a predominately or exclusively
   dipteran pollinator fauna, in an effort to understand how flower colour
   affects community assembly. We compared a distinctive group of
   cream-green Macquarie Island flowers to the flora of likely source pools

   northern hemisphere. We used both dipteran and hymenopteran colour
   models and phylogenetically informed analyses to explore the chromatic
   component of community assembly. The species with cream-green flowers
   are very restricted in colour space models of both fly vision and bee
   vision and represent a distinct group that plays a very minor role in
   other communities. It is unlikely that such a community could form
   through random immigration from continental source pools. Our findings
   suggest that fly pollination has imposed a strong ecological filter on
   Macquarie Island, favouring floral colours that are rare in continental
   floras. This is one of the strongest demonstrations that

Abstract = {{The use patterns and role of insecticide seed treatments, with focus on
   neonicotinoid insecticides, were examined for canola/oilseed rape
   production in Canada and the EU. Since nearly all planted canola acres
   in Western Canada and, historically, a majority of planted oilseed acres
   in the EU, use seed treatments, it is worth examining whether broad use
   of insecticidal seed treatments (IST) is compatible with principles of
   integrated pest management (IPM). The neonicotinoid insecticide (NNI)
   seed treatment (NNI ST) use pattern has risen due to effective control
   of several early season insect pests, the most destructive being flea
   beetles (Phyllotreta sp.). Negative environmental impact and poor
   efficacy of foliar applied insecticides on flea beetles led growers to
   look for better alternatives. Due to their biology, predictive models
   have been difficult to develop for flea beetles, and, therefore,
   targeted application of seed treatments, as part of an IPM program, has
   contributed to grower profitability and overall pollinator success for
   canola production in Western Canada. Early evidence suggests that the
   recent restriction on NNI may negatively impact grower profitability and
   does not appear to be having positive impact on pollinator health.
   Further investigation on impact of NNI on individual bee vs. hive health
   need to be conducted. Predictive models for flea beetle
   emergence/feeding activity in canola/oilseed rape need to be developed,
   as broad acre deployment of NNI seed treatments may not be sustainable

Abstract = {{Wildflower mixes are often planted around field margins to provide
   forage for pollinators. Although seed for these mixtures is often
   wild-sourced, for species where agricultural cultivars are available,
   for example red clover (Trifolium pratense), cultivars can also be
   included. Previous evidence suggests that plant genetic background can
   have a strong influence on plant-arthropod interactions and therefore
   the provenance and genetic background of the plants included in
   wildflower mixes could impact plant-pollinator interactions. We tested
   the performance of five individual T. pratense cultivars against two
   commercially available wild-sourced T. pratense populations in terms of
   their ability to attract potential pollinator species (focusing on
   bumblebees) and their floral traits using greenhouse and garden
   experiments. The main bumblebee observed interacting with T. pratense
   was Bombus pascuorum and we found no difference in the absolute number
   of B. pascuorum visiting the cultivars or wild populations. However, we
   found variation among cultivars and between wild populations in their
   ability to attract bumblebees, which seems to be related to their
   relative investment in different floral traits. There was a positive
   relationship between biomass and number of inflorescences produced by
   the wild populations of T. pratense, which was not apparent for the
   cultivars. This suggests that artificial selection on the cultivars has
   changed the G-matrix of correlated traits. We show that agricultural
   cultivars of T. pratense can be as effective as wild populations at
   attracting pollinators such as bumblebees, but that the genetic
   background of both cultivars and wild populations can have a significant
   impact on the attractiveness of the plant to pollinators. We also show
   divergence in the correlated traits of T. pratense cultivars and wild
   populations that could lead to outbreeding depression if the plants
   interbreed.}},

   bee species (42 Halictidae; 32 Apidae; 29 Andrenidae; 24 Megachilidae; 7
   Colletidae; 1 Melittidae) and 83 species of hoverflies. We describe a
   new species of hoverfly, Eumerus pannonicus sp. nov., and compare it to
   other similar species. Based on our study, the Special Nature Reserve of
   Pasnjaci Velike Droplje is critical for the conservation of this new
   Eumerus-being only found at this locality-and other species such as
   Chrysotoxum lineare (Zetterstedt), which is rare in Europe and protected
   under Serbian legislation. The highest numbers of bee species were
   recorded in the Deliblato and Subotica sand areas (40 and 32,
   respectively), while Fruska Gora Mountain and the Vrsac Mountains
   harboured the highest number of hoverfly species.}},

Title = {{An energetics-based honeybee nectar-foraging model used to assess the
   potential for landscape-level pesticide exposure dilution}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Estimating the exposure of honeybees to pesticides on a landscape scale
   requires models of their spatial foraging behaviour. For this purpose,
   we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of
   nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency
   determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single
   optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of
   foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited
   simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to
   depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The
   model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource
   depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and
   seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops
   and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource
   patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only,
   net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the
   energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also
   determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and
   clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess
   the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different
   composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in
   nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a
   treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away
   from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations
   over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that
   were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which
   detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were
   available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were
   expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources
   than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated
   crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges
   (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field
   (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution
   occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more
   attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of
   flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips
   were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field
   habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal
   location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of
   resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with
   numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large
   resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a
   small number of patches.}},

Abstract = {{With steadily shrinking areas of species-rich semi-natural grasslands in
   Europe, the management of the remaining fragments becomes ever more
   crucial for the preservation of key elements of biodiversity in the
   agricultural landscape. Detailed knowledge about species-wise, as well
   as group-wise, relationships can provide guidelines for conservation
   management and a basis for predictions about different management
   scenarios. In the present study, we related the occurrence of species of
   bumblebees (N = 12), butterflies (31) and day-flying moths (4) and their
   total richness in 424 sites in southern Sweden to three grass sward
   attributes, (i) flower abundance, (ii) height of the grass sward and
   (iii) within-site variation in height of vegetation. The abundance of
   nectar-bearing flowers proved overall the best predictor of richness and
   in most of the occurrence-based species-wise models. However, both high
   grass sward height and high variation in grass sward height contributed
   significantly to species richness and occurrence of individual species.
   There was a tendency for bumblebees to respond less positively to flower
   abundance and vegetation height than butterflies and moths. One
   expectation was that grassland specialists, red-listed species, or
   species decreasing in other part of Europe, would be more responsive to
   tall vegetation or flower abundance but there was no support for this in
   the data. Hence, management strategies that promote common species will
   also benefit all, or most of, the rare ones as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   multilevel image thresholding: A performance study}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{566-584}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the ability of two new nature-inspired
   metaheuristics namely the flower pollination (FP) and the social spiders
   optimization (SSO) algorithms to solve the image segmentation problem
   via multilevel thresholding. The FP algorithm is inspired from the
   biological process of flower pollination. It relies on two basic
   mechanisms to generate new solutions. The first one is the global
   pollination modeled in terms of a Levy distribution while the second one
   is the local pollination that is based on random selection of local
   solutions. For its part, the SSO algorithm mimics different natural
   cooperative behaviors of a spider colony. It considers male and female
   search agents subject to different evolutionary operators. In the two
   proposed algorithms, candidate solutions are firstly generated using the
   image histogram. Then, they are evolved according to the dynamics of
   their corresponding operators. During the optimization process,
   solutions are evaluated using the between-class variance or Kapur's
   method. The performance of each of the two proposed approaches has been
   assessed using a variety of benchmark images and compared against two
   other nature inspired algorithms from the literature namely PSO and BAT
   algorithms. Results have been analyzed both qualitatively and
   quantitatively based on the fitness values of obtained best solutions
   and two popular performance measures namely PSNR and SSIM indices as
   well. Experimental results have shown that both SSO and FP algorithms
   outperform PSO and BAT algorithms while exhibiting equal performance for
   small numbers of thresholds. For large numbers of thresholds, it was
   observed that the performance of FP algorithm decreases as it is often
   trapped in local minima. In contrary, the SSO algorithm provides a good
   balance between exploration and exploitation and has shown to be the
   most efficient and the most stable for all images even with the increase
   of the threshold number. These promising results suggest that the SSO
   algorithm can be effectively considered as an attractive alternative for
   the multilevel image thresholding problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Land-use change and intensification threaten bee populations worldwide,
   imperilling pollination services. Global models are needed to better
   characterise, project, and mitigate bees' responses to these human
   impacts. The available data are, however, geographically and
   taxonomically unrepresentative; most data are from North America and
   Western Europe, overrepresenting bumblebees and raising concerns that
   model results may not be generalizable to other regions and taxa. To
   assess whether the geographic and taxonomic biases of data could
   undermine effectiveness of models for conservation policy, we have
   collated from the published literature a global dataset of bee diversity
   at sites facing land-use change and intensification, and assess whether
   bee responses to these pressures vary across 11 regions (Western,
   Northern, Eastern and Southern Europe; North, Central and South America;
   Australia and New Zealand; South East Asia; Middle and Southern Africa)
   and between bumblebees and other bees. Our analyses highlight strong
   regionally-based responses of total abundance, species richness and
   Simpson's diversity to land use, caused by variation in the sensitivity
   of species and potentially in the nature of threats. These results
   suggest that global extrapolation of models based on geographically and
   taxonomically restricted data may underestimate the true uncertainty,
   increasing the risk of ecological surprises.}},

Title = {{A horizon scan of future threats and opportunities for pollinators and
   pollination}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background. Pollinators, which provide the agriculturally and
   ecologically essential service of pollination are under threat at a
   global scale. Habitat loss and homogenisation, pesticides, parasites and
   pathogens, invasive species, and climate change have been identified as
   past and current threats to pollinators. Actions to mitigate these
   threats, e.g., agri-environment schemes and pesticide-use moratoriums,
   exist, but have largely been applied post-hoc. However, future
   sustainability of pollinators and the service they provide requires
   anticipation of potential threats and opportunities before they occur,
   enabling timely implementation of policy and practice to prevent, rather
   than mitigate, further pollinator declines.
   Methods. Using a horizon scanning approach we identified issues that are
   likely to impact pollinators, either positively or negatively over the
   coming three decades.
   Results. Our analysis highlights six high priority, and nine secondary
   issues. High priorities are: (1) corporate control of global
   agriculture, (2) novel systemic pesticides, (3) novel RNA viruses, (4)
   the development of new managed pollinators, (5) more frequent heatwaves
   and drought under climate change, and (6) the potential positive impact
   of reduced chemical use on pollinators in non-agricultural settings.
   Discussion. While current pollinator management approaches are largely
   driven by mitigating past impacts, we present opportunities for
   pre-emptive practice, legislation, and policy to sustainably manage
   pollinators for future generations.}},

Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Insect pollinators such as bumblebees play a vital role in many
   ecosystems, so it is important to understand their foraging movements on
   a landscape scale. We used harmonic radar to record the natural foraging
   behaviour of Bombus terrestris audax workers over their entire foraging
   career. Every flight ever made outside the nest by four foragers was
   recorded. Our data reveal where the bees flew and how their behaviour
   changed with experience, at an unprecedented level of detail. We
   identified how each bee's flights fit into two categories-which we named
   exploration and exploitation flights-examining the differences between
   the two types of flight and how their occurrence changed over the course
   of the bees' foraging careers. Exploitation of learned resources takes
   place during efficient, straight trips, usually to a single foraging
   location, and is seldom combined with exploration of other areas.
   Exploration of the landscape typically occurs in the first few flights
   made by each bee, but our data show that further exploration flights can
   be made throughout the bee's foraging career. Bees showed striking
   levels of variation in how they explored their environment, their
   fidelity to particular patches, ratio of exploration to exploitation,
   duration and frequency of their foraging bouts. One bee developed a
   straight route to a forage patch within four flights and followed this
   route exclusively for six days before abandoning it entirely for a
   closer location; this second location had not been visited since her
   first exploratory flight nine days prior. Another bee made only rare
   exploitation flights and continued to explore widely throughout its
   life; two other bees showed more frequent switches between exploration
   and exploitation. Our data shed light on the way bumblebees balance
   exploration of the environment with exploitation of resources and reveal
   extreme levels of variation between individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The tropical Bignoniaceae is mostly late-acting self-incompatible (LSI)
   and depends on a guild of medium to large sized bees for their
   pollination. Adenocalymma nodosum and A. peregrinum are syntopic shrubs
   in savanna areas with similar flowers and flowering overlap. In this
   sense, the aims of the present study were to analyse the pollination
   biology and breeding systems of these species, and to check for
   bilateral compatibility which could hinder reproductive isolation and
   species boundaries. Flower features such as yellow corolla, sweet scent
   and diurnal one-day anthesis were similar between species. However, they
   differed in nectar production patterns, which showed higher volume in A.
   nodosum and was irregular in A. peregrinum. The main pollinators for
   both species were medium to large Centridini bees. Many nectar and
   pollen robbers may disturb effective pollination and help to explain the
   low natural fruit-set. The species were self-sterile but pollen tube
   growth down to the ovules and differential ovary development indicated
   LSI, as in most Bignoniaceae studied to date, which reinforce the idea
   of family, clustering for this self-incompatibility system. Fruit-set
   from interspecific hand pollinations was similar to those of
   intraspecific cross-pollinations, with high seed viability (88\%) and
   seedling development. Similar floral biology and guild of pollinators,
   and bilateral inter-compatibility indicate that natural hybridization is
   possible among these species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Pollinator and/or mate scarcity affects pollen transfer, with important
   ecological and evolutionary consequences for plant reproduction.
   However, the way in which the pollen loads transported by pollinators
   and deposited on stigmas are affected by pollination context has been
   little studied. We investigated the impacts of plant mate and visiting
   insect availabilities on pollen transport and receipt in a
   mass-flowering and facultative autogamous shrub (Rhododendron
   ferrugineum). First, we recorded insect visits to R. ferrugineum in
   plant patches of diverse densities and sizes. Second, we analyzed the
   pollen loads transported by R. ferrugineum pollinators and deposited on
   stigmas of emasculated and intact flowers, in the same patches. Overall,
   pollinators (bumblebees) transported much larger pollen loads than the
   ones found on stigmas, and the pollen deposited on stigmas included a
   high proportion of conspecific pollen. However, comparing pollen loads
   of emasculated and intact flowers indicated that pollinators contributed
   only half the conspecific pollen present on the stigma. At low plant
   density, we found the highest visitation rate and the lowest proportion
   of conspecific pollen transported and deposited by pollinators. By
   contrast, at higher plant density and lower visitation rate, pollinators
   deposited larger proportion of conspecific pollen, although still far
   from sufficient to ensure that all the ovules were fertilized. Finally,
   self-pollen completely buffered the detrimental effects on pollination
   of patch fragmentation and pollinator failure. Our results indicate that
   pollen loads from pollinators and emasculated flowers should be
   quantified for an accurate understanding of the relative impacts of
   pollinator and mate limitation on pollen transfer in facultative
   autogamous species.}},

Abstract = {{Sound vibrations form a potential environmental stimulus, which trigger
   molecular changes typical of a signaling cascade within a cell, and thus
   have ecological significance.Being sessile, plants continuously deal
   with their dynamic and complex surroundings, identifying important cues
   and reacting with appropriate responses. Consequently, the sensitivity
   of plants has evolved to perceive a myriad of external stimuli, which
   ultimately ensures their successful survival. Research over past
   centuries has established that plants respond to environmental factors
   such as light, temperature, moisture, and mechanical perturbations (e.g.
   wind, rain, touch, etc.) by suitably modulating their growth and
   development. However, sound vibrations (SVs) as a stimulus have only
   started receiving attention relatively recently. SVs have been shown to
   increase the yields of several crops and strengthen plant immunity
   against pathogens. These vibrations can also prime the plants so as to
   make them more tolerant to impending drought. Plants can recognize the
   chewing sounds of insect larvae and the buzz of a pollinating bee, and
   respond accordingly. It is thus plausible that SVs may serve as a
   long-range stimulus that evokes ecologically relevant signaling
   mechanisms in plants. Studies have suggested that SVs increase the
   transcription of certain genes, soluble protein content, and support
   enhanced growth and development in plants. At the cellular level, SVs
   can change the secondary structure of plasma membrane proteins, affect
   microfilament rearrangements, produce Ca2+ signatures, cause increases
   in protein kinases, protective enzymes, peroxidases, antioxidant
   enzymes, amylase, H+-ATPase / K+ channel activities, and enhance levels
   of polyamines, soluble sugars and auxin. In this paper, we propose a
   signaling model to account for the molecular episodes that SVs induce
   within the cell, and in so doing we uncover a number of interesting
   questions that need to be addressed by future research in plant
   acoustics.}},

Abstract = {{Backgrounds and Aims Floral traits that attract pollinators may also
   attract seed predators, which, in turn, may generate conflicting natural
   selection on such traits. Although such selection trade-offs are
   expected to vary geographically, few studies have investigated selection
   mediated by pollinators and seed predators across a geographic mosaic of
   environments and floral variation.
   Methods Floral traits were investigated in 14 populations of the
   bumble-bee-pollinated herb, Pedicularis rex, in which tubular flowers
   are subtended by cupular bracts holding rain water. To study potentially
   conflicting selection on floral traits generated by pollinators and
   florivores, stigmatic pollen loads, initial seed set, pre-dispersal seed
   predation and final viable seed production were measured in 12-14
   populations in the field.
   Key Results Generalized Linear Model (GLM) analyses indicated that the
   pollen load on stigmas was positively related to the exsertion of the
   corolla beyond the cupular bracts and size of the lower corolla lip, but
   so too was the rate of seed predation, creating conflicting selection on
   both floral traits. A geographic mosaic of selection mediated by seed
   predators, but not pollinators, was indicated by significant variation
   in levels of seed predation and the inclusion of two-, three- and
   four-way interaction terms between population and seed predation in the
   best model {[}lowest corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc)]
   explaining final seed production.
   Conclusions These results indicate opposing selection in operation:
   pollinators generated selection for greater floral exsertion beyond the
   bracts, but seed predators generated selection for reduced exsertion
   above the protective pools of water, although the strength of the latter
   varied across populations.}},

Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Effects of an exotic plant on pollination may
   change as the invasive increases in density. Quantity of pollinator
   visits to a native may increase, decrease, or change nonlinearly, while
   visit quality is likely to decrease with greater interspecific pollen
   movement. How visit quantity and quality contribute to the effect on
   reproductive success at each invasion stage has not been measured.
   METHODS: We simulated four stages of invasion by Brassica nigra by
   manipulating the neighborhood of potted plants of the native Phacelia
   parryi in a field experiment. Stages were far from the invasion, near
   the invasion, intermixed with the invasive at low density, and
   intermixed at high density. We measured pollinator visitation,
   conspecific and invasive pollen deposition, and seed set for P. parryi
   at each stage.
   KEY RESULTS: Native individuals near invasive plants and within areas of
   low invasive density showed greatest seed production, as expected from
   concurrent changes in conspecific and invasive pollen deposition. Those
   plants experienced facilitation of visits and received more conspecific
   pollen relative to plants farther from invasives. Native individuals
   within high invasive density also received frequent visits by many
   pollinators (although not honeybees), but the larger receipt of invasive
   pollen predicted interference with pollen tubes that matched patterns in
   seed set.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pollinator visitation was highest when exotic plants were
   nearby. Detrimental effects of heterospecific pollen deposition were
   highest at high exotic density. Our study quantified how reproduction
   benefits from near proximity to a showy invasive, but is still
   vulnerable when the invasive reaches high density.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in agricultural conversion are leading to declines in native
   grasslands and natural resources critical for beneficial insects.
   However, little is known regarding how these changes affect pollinator
   diversity. Land use types were categorized within 300m and 3km radii of
   pollinator sampling locations in Brookings County, SD. Pollinator
   abundance and species richness were regressed on the proportion of the
   landscape dedicated to row crops, grass and pasture, forage crops, small
   grains, and aquatic habitats using variance components modeling. Row
   crops had a negative effect on bee abundance at 300 m, after fixed
   effects modeling accounted for outliers skewing this relationship. At 3
   km, corn positively affected bee abundance and richness, while soybean
   acreage decreased species richness. The landscape matrix of outlying
   sites consisted of large monocultured areas with few alternative habitat
   types available, leading to inflated populations of Melissodes and
   Halictidae. Syrphids had a positive parabolic relationship between
   diversity and row crops, indicating potential for competitive exclusion
   from intermediate landscapes. Unlike other studies, landscape diversity
   within 300m was not found to significantly benefit pollinator diversity.
   Within especially agriculturally developed areas of the region, high
   abundances of pollinators suggest selection for a few dominant species.
   There was no effect of forage crops or aquatic habitats on pollinator
   diversity, indicating that less highly managed areas still represent
   degraded habitat within the landscape. Incorporating pollinator-friendly
   crops at the farm level throughout the region is likely to enhance
   pollinator diversity by lessening the negative effects of large

Abstract = {{Aerial traps, using combinations of color and attractive lures, are a
   critical tool for detecting and managing insect pest populations. Yet,
   despite improvements in trap efficacy, collection of nontarget species
   ({''}bycatch{''}) plagues many insect pest surveys. Bycatch can
   influence survey effectiveness by reducing the available space for
   target species and increasing trap screening time, especially in areas
   where thousands of insects are captured as bycatch in a given season.
   Additionally, bycatch may negatively impact local nontarget insect
   populations, including beneficial predators and pollinators. Here, we
   tested the effect of pheromone lures on bycatch rates of Coccinellidae
   (Coleoptera), Apoidea (Hymenoptera), and nontarget Lepidoptera.
   Multicolored (primarily yellow and white) bucket traps containing a
   pheromone lure for capturing one of three survey target species,
   Spodoptera litura (F.), S. littoralis (Boisduval), or Helicoverpa
   armigera (Hubner), were placed in alfalfa and corn fields, and compared
   to multicolored traps without a pheromone lure. All-green traps with and
   without H. armigera lures were employed in a parallel study
   investigating the effect of lure and trap color on bycatch. Over 2,600
   Coccinellidae representing seven species, nearly 6,400 bees in 57
   species, and >9,000 nontarget moths in 17 genera were captured across
   180 traps and seven temporal sampling events. Significant effects of
   lure and color were observed for multiple taxa. In general, nontarget
   insects were attracted to the H. armigera lure and multicolored trap,
   but further studies of trap color and pheromone lure specificity are
   needed to better understand these interactions and to minimize nontarget

Abstract = {{The progression from solitary living to caste-based sociality is
   commonly regarded as a major evolutionary transition. However, it has
   recently been shown that in some taxa, sociality may be plastic and
   dependent on local conditions. If sociality can be environmentally
   driven, the question arises as to how projected climate change will
   influence features of social organisation that were previously thought
   to be of macroevolutionary proportions. Depending on the time available
   in spring during which a foundress can produce worker offspring, the
   sweat bee Halictus rubicundus is either social or solitary. We analysed
   detailed foraging data in relation to climate change predictions for
   Great Britain to assess when and where switches from a solitary to
   social lifestyle may be expected. We demonstrate that worker numbers
   should increase throughout Great Britain under predicted climate change
   scenarios, and importantly, that sociality should appear in northern
   areas where it has never before been observed. This dramatic shift in
   social organisation due to climate change should lead to a bigger
   workforce being available for summer pollination and may contribute
   towards mitigating the current pollinator crisis.
   The sweat bee Halictus rubicundus is socially polymorphic, expressing
   both solitary and social forms, and is socially plastic, capable of
   transitioning from solitary to social forms, depending on local
   environmental conditions. Here, we analyse detailed foraging data in
   relation to climate change predictions for Great Britain to show that
   worker numbers and sociality both increase under predicted climate
   change scenarios. Especially dramatic will be the appearance of social
   H. rubicundus nests in the north of Britain, where previously only
   solitary forms are found. Particularly, if more taxa are found to be
   socially plastic, environmentally driven shifts in social organisation
   may help to mitigate future pollinator crises by providing more

Abstract = {{Species integrity relies on the maintenance of reproductive isolation,

   hypothesized that the presence of heterospecific pollen on flower
   stigmas adversely affects plant reproduction with increasing effect in
   closely related species. Using two pairs of co-occurring buzz-pollinated
   Thysanotus spp. in the Mediterranean climate region of Perth, Western
   Australia, we quantified the effect of heterospecific pollen on fruit
   and seed set. We first determined the mating systems of the two focal
   species using self- and outcross pollen, followed by separate treatments
   with heterospecific pollen within each species pair. Of the two species
   receiving pollen, Thysanotus triandrus had a mixed mating system, but
   with significantly lower fruit and seed set from self-pollen relative to
   outcross pollen. Thysanotus tenellus was autogamous with no difference
   in fruit or seed set between autogamous, self- or outcross pollinations.
   Heterospecific pollen had no effect on fruit or seed set of either focal
   species. These outcomes point to post-pollination reproductive
   isolation, consistent with a floral morphology that causes low
   specificity of pollen placement and thus a poor capacity for
   pre-pollination discrimination. Negative effects of heterospecific
   pollen, therefore, do not appear to play a role in the reproduction in

Abstract = {{Large floral displays favour pollinator attraction and the import and
   export of pollen. However, large floral displays also have negative
   effects, such as increased geitonogamy, pollen discounting and
   nectar/pollen robber attraction. The size of the floral display can be
   measured at different scales (e.g. the flower, inflorescence or entire
   plant) and variations in one of these scales may affect the behaviour of
   flower visitors in different ways. Moreover, the fragmentation of
   natural forests may affect flower visitation rates and flower visitor
   behaviour. In the present study, video recordings of the inflorescences
   of a tree species (Tabebuia aurea) from the tropical savannah of central
   Brazil were used to examine the effect of floral display size at the
   inflorescence and tree scales on the visitation rate of pollinators and
   nectar robbers to the inflorescence, the number of flowers approached
   per visit, the number of visits per flower of potential pollinators and
   nectar robbers, and the interaction of these variables with the degree
   of landscape disturbance. Nectar production was quantified with respect
   to flower age. Although large bees are responsible for most of the
   pollination, a great diversity of flower insects visit the
   inflorescences of T.aurea. Other bee and hummingbird species are highly
   active nectar robbers. Increases in inflorescence size increase the
   visitation rate of pollinators to inflorescences, whereas increases in
   the number of inflorescences on the tree decrease visitation rates to
   inflorescences and flowers. This effect has been strongly correlated
   with urban environments in which trees with the largest floral displays
   are observed. Pollinating bees (and nectar robbers) visit few flowers
   per inflorescence and concentrate visits to a fraction of available
   flowers, generating an overdispersed distribution of the number of
   visits per inflorescence and per flower. This behaviour reflects
   preferential visits to young flowers (including flower buds) with a
   greater nectar supply.}},

   although species lost their native mutualists and gained novel
   interactions in the alien community, their role did not differ
   significantly between ranges. Consequently, closeness centrality and
   normalized degree in the alien range were highly predictable from the
   native range networks.
   Main conclusions Species with high degree and centrality define the core
   of nested networks. Our results suggest that core species are likely to
   establish interactions and be core species in the alien range, whilst
   species with few interactions in their native range will behave
   similarly in their alien range. Our results provide new insights into
   species role conservatism and could help ecologists to predict alien
   species impact at the community level.}},

Abstract = {{Territorial males may adopt a mating tactic that yields greater
   reproductive success but that at the same time increases the risk of
   predation. Plasticity in reproductive behavior can reflect a balance
   between sexual selection and natural selection. In this study, we sought
   to verify the effect of predation risk on territorial behavior of males
   of the solitary bee Ptilothrix fructifera (Apidae). Males of the species
   employ alternative mating tactics and can be territorial in defense of
   larval food sources. By manipulating predator models in the field, we
   tested whether (1) males avoid perch flowers containing predator models;
   (2) males alternate between mating tactics when their territory is
   associated with a predation risk; and (3) female foraging on flowers in
   a territory is altered in the presence of a predator model. We measured
   the responses of males and females in flowers containing and not
   containing a model of a spider or a stuffed bird. The results show that
   territorial males of P. fructifera alter their territorial behavior when
   faced with a high risk of predation. They do not abandon their territory
   or change to a non-territorial mating tactic, but instead change the use
   of their territory, avoiding flowers containing predator models or
   perching on other flowers when the previous flower presented a potential
   predation risk. Female P. fructifera decreases the frequency of their
   visits to flowers and the length of time spent there in the presence of
   a spider model. In short, in the face of predation risk, females and
   males alter their behaviors at the cost of less efficient foraging and
   searching for partners, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the dietary requirements of a burgeoning human population, the
   demand for animal-dependent crops continues to grow. To meet the demand,
   intensive farming practices are used. The gains in food production
   associated with agricultural intensification may be offset by its
   detrimental effects on pollinator populations through natural habitat
   fragmentation and pesticide use. Abundance and species richness of
   pollinators have been found to decrease with increasing distance to
   natural habitat in agroecosystems, reducing crop yields. A key aspect of
   crop pollination lies in the diversity of functional traits (functional
   diversity, FD) of flower-visitor communities within crop fields. Higher
   FD allows improved pollination success through complementarity between
   flower-visitors' morphology, phenology and behaviour. Many studies
   reported negative effects of increasing distance to natural habitats on
   the abundance and richness of flower-visitor communities, but the link
   between FD and natural habitat isolation is less well understood. Also,
   a more complete understanding of the functional traits of flower visitor
   communities within crops should consider potential variations through
   time. Differences in resources availability between seasons are
   important in tropical areas and could modify ecological responses of
   flower-visitor communities to isolation. In this study, we surveyed the
   Hymenoptera and Diptera communities within mango orchards of South
   Africa using pan traps at 100 m, 200 m and at the maximal distance
   possible from any natural habitat. We measured the response of insect
   abundance, wing span and body size as well as functional diversity to
   habitat isolation during mango flowering (dry season), and during the
   wet season (after mango fruit harvest). Flying insect abundance
   decreased with increasing distance to natural habitat during mango
   flowering, but no effect was detected during the wet season. FD of
   flying insects declined with increasing distance to natural habitat in
   both sampling periods. Insects captured during mango flowering were
   smaller but had higher wing length/body length ratios than those caught
   during the wet season. This study highlights that mango orchards are
   more inhospitable for flying insects during mango flowering. This effect
   might be due to low palatability of mango flowers, or pesticide use in
   mango fields. In order to maintain a high FD of flower-visiting species,
   and reduce the detrimental effects of habitat isolation to ultimately
   ensure better crop pollination, we propose establishment of patches of
   resource-rich habitats combined with judicious use of pesticides within
   orchards. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Colour is one of the main floral traits used by
   pollinators to locate flowers. Although pollinators show innate colour
   preferences, the view that the colour of a flower may be considered an
   important predictor of its main pollinators is highly controversial
   because flower choice is highly context-dependent, and initial innate
   preferences may be overridden by subsequent associative learning. Our
   objective is to establish whether there is a relationship between flower
   colour and pollinator composition in natural communities.
   Methods We measured the flower reflectance spectrum and pollinator
   composition in four plant communities (85 plant species represented by
   109 populations, and 32 305 plant-pollinator interactions in total).
   Pollinators were divided into six taxonomic groups: bees, ants, wasps,
   coleopterans, dipterans and lepidopterans.
   Key Results We found consistent associations between pollinator groups
   and certain colours. These associations matched innate preferences
   experimentally established for several pollinators and predictions of
   the pollination syndrome theory. However, flowers with similar colours
   did not attract similar pollinator assemblages.
   Conclusions The explanation for this paradoxical result is that most
   flower species are pollination generalists. We conclude that although
   pollinator colour preferences seem to condition plant-pollinator
   interactions, the selective force behind these preferences has not been
   strong enough to mediate the appearance and maintenance of tight
   colour-based plant-pollinator associations.}},

Abstract = {{Floral variation among closely related species is thought to often
   reflect differences in pollination systems. Flowers of the large genus
   Impatiens are characterized by extensive variation in colour, shape and
   size and in anther and stigma positioning, but studies of their
   pollination ecology are scarce and most lack a comparative context.
   Consequently, the function of floral diversity in Impatiens remains
   enigmatic. This study documents floral variation and pollination of
   seven co-occurring Impatiens spp. in the Southeast Asian diversity
   hotspot. To assess whether floral trait variation reflects
   specialization for different pollination systems, we tested whether
   species depend on pollinators for reproduction, identified animals that
   visit flowers, determined whether these visitors play a role in
   pollination and quantified and compared key floral traits, including
   floral dimensions and nectar characteristics. Experimental exclusion of
   insects decreased fruit and seed set significantly for all species
   except I.muscicola, which also received almost no visits from animals.
   Most species received visits from several animals, including bees,
   birds, butterflies and hawkmoths, only a subset of which were effective
   pollinators. Impatiens psittacina, I.kerriae, I.racemosa and
   I.daraneenae were pollinated by bees, primarily Bombus haemorrhoidalis.
   Impatiens chiangdaoensis and I.santisukii had bimodal pollination
   systems which combined bee and lepidopteran pollination. Floral traits
   differed significantly among species with different pollination systems.
   Autogamous flowers were small and spurless, and did not produce nectar;
   bee-pollinated flowers had short spurs and large floral chambers with a
   wide entrance; and bimodally bee- and lepidopteran-pollinated species
   had long spurs and a small floral chamber with a narrow entrance.
   Nectar-producing species with different pollination systems did not
   differ in nectar volume and sugar concentration. Despite the high
   frequency of bee pollination in co-occurring species, individuals with a
   morphology suggestive of hybrid origin were rare. Variation in floral
   architecture, including various forms of corolla asymmetry, facilitates
   distinct, species-specific pollen-placement on visiting bees. Our
   results show that floral morphological diversity among Impatiens spp. is
   associated with both differences in functional pollinator groups and
   divergent use of the same pollinator. Non-homologous mechanisms of
   floral asymmetry are consistent with repeated independent evolution,
   suggesting that competitive interactions among species with the same
   pollination system have been an important driver of floral variation
   among Impatiens spp.}},

Abstract = {{Male flowers of the wind-pollinated, dioecious shrub Boehmeria caudata
   Sw. release pollen explosively, possibly stimulated by anther
   dehydration in response to temporarily dry conditions coupled with
   hydrostatic pressure in the filament. In the Brazilian Atlantic rain
   forest, the daily frequency of male flower anthesis peaked between
   1000-1200 h (GMT -3) and was positively correlated with rising
   temperature, wind currents, and direct insolation, but negatively
   correlated with relative humidity. A generalized linear mixed model
   predicts the probability of pollen release under different conditions of
   relative humidity and wind. Receptive stigmas on female flowers were
   found at any time of day: individual stigmas were receptive (H2O2 test)
   for at least two days. Beetles and halictid bees were observed feeding
   on pollen from staminate flowers, but probably did not affect
   pollination because they did not seem to visit pistillate flowers.
   Individual plants of this apparently ruderal species grow along road
   edges and show aggregated (clumped) spatial dispersion. The overall sex
   ratio we found was 29 females to 43 males, with one monoecious plant in
   a total transect distance of 6319 m. Pollen traps were placed on the
   female plants to measure pollen arrival. Pollen capture was higher on
   the more exposed road-facing side and positively related to male plant

Abstract = {{Crop pollination by bees has long been recognized as an ecosystem
   service of huge economic value; a large number of food crops depend upon

Abstract = {{1. Pollinating insects provide important ecosystem services and are
   influenced by the intensity of grazing. Based on the Intermediate
   Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), pollinator diversity is expected to peak
   at intermediate grazing intensities. However, this hump-shaped
   relationship is rarely found. 2. The effect of grazing intensity was
   tested on flower cover, on the abundance and richness of bees,
   hoverflies and bee flies, and on pollination services to early-flowering
   bee-pollinated Asphodelus ramosusL. For that, we used data on 11
   plant-pollinator phryganic communities from Lesvos Island (Greece)
   widely differing in grazing intensities. 3. Flower abundance and
   richness showed hump-shaped relationships with grazing intensity.
   Grazing affected the abundance and richness of bees and hoverflies
   directly and also indirectly, through changes in the flower community.
   Grazing influenced directly the richness but not the abundance of bee
   flies. Overall, pollinator abundance and richness showed hump-shaped
   relationships with grazing intensity, but variations in strength
   (hoverfly abundance) and direction (bee community) of the effect
   appeared along the season. Early in the season, grazing increased bee
   abundance but decreased richness, resulting in increased pollen
   limitation in A. ramosus. 4. The effects of grazing on pollinators vary
   with the intensity of the disturbance, generally supporting the IDH, and
   the timing of land-use activities may influence pollination services.
   Management strategies should include moderate grazing levels to preserve
   overall diversity in this area, however, the conservation of particular
   early bee or bee-pollinated species may benefit from reduced grazing in
   early spring.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators that collect pollen - and specifically, pollen-specialist
   bees - are often considered to be the best pollinators of a (host)
   plant. Although pollen collectors and pollen specialists often benefit
   host plants, especially in the pollen that they deliver (their
   pollination ``effectiveness{''}), they can also exact substantial costs
   because they are motivated to collect as much pollen as possible,
   reducing the proportion of pollen removed that is subsequently delivered
   to stigmas (their pollination ``efficiency{''}). From the plant
   perspective, pollen grains that do not pollinate conspecific stigmas are
   ``wasted{''}, and potentially costly. We measured costs and benefits of
   nectar-collecting, pollen-collecting, and pollen-specialist pollinator
   visitation to the spring ephemeral Claytonia virginica. Visits by the
   pollen-specialist bee Andrena erigeniae depleted pollen quickly and
   thoroughly. Although all pollinators delivered roughly the same number
   of grains, the pollen specialist contributed most to C. virginica pollen
   delivery because of high visitation rates. However, the pollen
   specialist also removed a large number of grains; this removal may be
   especially costly because it resulted in the depletion of pollen grains
   in C. virginica populations. While C. virginica appears to rely on
   pollen transfer by the pollen specialist in these populations,
   nectar-collecting visitors could provide the same benefit at a lower
   cost if their visitation rates increased. Pollen depletion affects a
   pollinator's value to plants, but is frequently overlooked. If they
   lower the effectiveness of future floral visitors, visits by A.
   erigeniae females to C. virginica may be more detrimental than
   beneficial compared to other pollinators and may, in some circumstances,
   reduce plant fitness rather than increase it. Therefore, A. erigeniae
   and C. virginica may vary in their degree of mutualism depending on the

Abstract = {{Native bees provide essential pollination services to cultivated and
   wild plants worldwide. Despite the need to conserve pollinators, the
   foraging patterns of native bees are poorly understood. Classic concepts
   of resource use have typically categorized bee species as specialists or
   generalists based on floral visitation patterns. While intraspecific
   variation in bee foraging likely depends on local land use, sex, and
   phenological period, among other factors, these potential drivers of
   floral visitation are rarely explicitly investigated. In this study, we
   explore the potential for inter-and intra-specific variation in floral
   visitation by investigating the pollen loads of two solitary, similarly
   sized, ground-nesting native bee species within the Apinae, Melissodes
   tepaneca (Cresson) and Diadasia rinconis (Cockerell), categorized as
   generalist and specialist based on past floral visitation studies,
   respectively. Our analyses reveal generalist foraging and indicate that
   natural habitat availability significantly drives pollen load
   composition for both species. The putative specialist, D. rinconis,
   exhibited significant differences in pollen load composition between
   males and females, between pan and net collection methods, and between
   the different phenological periods. The putative generalist, M.
   tepaneca, exhibited significant differences in pollen load composition
   between the sexes, but only in the late season. Both species exhibited
   significant preference levels for multiple native plant species across
   the study region. Given that pollen collection is essential for native
   bee population persistence across natural and human-dominated habitats,
   our findings suggest consideration of both pollen collection and floral
   visitation patterns to holistically describe floral usage and develop
   pollinator conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Low genetic variability has normally been considered a consequence of
   animal husbandry and a major contributing factor to declining bee
   populations. Here, we performed a molecular analysis of captive and wild
   populations of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula, one of the most

   showed similar genetic variability between wild and captive populations
   However, captive populations showed lower mitochondrial genetic

   patterns of genetic structure. We conclude that increasing the number of
   colonies kept through nest divisions does not negatively affect nuclear
   genetic variability, which seems to be maintained by small-scale male
   dispersal and human-mediated nest transport. However, the transport of
   nests from distant localities should be practiced with caution given the
   high genetic differentiation observed between samples from western and

Abstract = {{The global initiatives of monitoring and conserving pollinators require
   worldwide assessments with comparable data sets collected through
   standardized methods. The use of pan traps is a passive method widely
   applied to sample flower visitors, standing out for its simplicity.
   Despite its wide use to sample pollinator diversity, the influence of
   color on trap efficiency is not well understood. The available studies
   are particularly scarce in the tropics and have generated divergent
   results. The main goal of the present study was to assess whether blue,
   yellow and white pan traps are complementary to sample Hymenoptera
   community. For this, we placed 49 sample units of blue, white and yellow
   pan traps in agricultural and natural (savanna-like) areas in Chapada
   Diamantina, Bahia, Brazil. We found that the species richness from blue
   and yellow pan traps were not significantly different, but both were
   significantly greater than the species richness from white pan traps.
   However, bees were significantly more attracted to the blue pan traps
   and wasps to the yellow ones; thus, color attractiveness was
   group-specific. Pan traps of different color showed low species
   composition overlap with 61 \% of species collected exclusively in one
   of the three pan trap colors, and the species composition in the blue
   traps differed consistently from that in the traps of the other colors.
   In the article we discuss the implication of the results and defend the
   combined use of pan traps with different colors as a solution for the
   differential variable sample bias.}},

Abstract = {{Wild bee declines have been ascribed in part to neonicotinoid
   insecticides. While short-term laboratory studies on commercially bred
   species ( principally honeybees and bumblebees) have identified
   sub-lethal effects, there is no strong evidence linking these
   insecticides to losses of the majority of wild bee species. We relate 18
   years of UK national wild bee distribution data for 62 species to
   amounts of neonicotinoid use in oilseed rape. Using a multi-species
   dynamic Bayesian occupancy analysis, we find evidence of increased
   population extinction rates in response to neonicotinoid seed treatment
   use on oilseed rape. Species foraging on oilseed rape benefit from the
   cover of this crop, but were on average three times more negatively
   affected by exposure to neonicotinoids than non-crop foragers. Our
   results suggest that sub-lethal effects of neonicotinoids could scale up
   to cause losses of bee biodiversity. Restrictions on neonicotinoid use
   may reduce population declines.}},

   Susceptible Hosts?}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Plant volatiles play important roles in attraction of certain
   pollinators and in host location by herbivorous insects. Virus infection
   induces changes in plant volatile emission profiles, and this can make
   plants more attractive to insect herbivores, such as aphids, that act as
   viral vectors. However, it is unknown if virus-induced alterations in
   volatile production affect plant-pollinator interactions. We found that
   volatiles emitted by cucumber mosaic virus (CMV)-infected tomato
   (Solanum lycopersicum) and Arabidopsis thaliana plants altered the
   foraging behaviour of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris). Virus-induced
   quantitative and qualitative changes in blends of volatile organic
   compounds emitted by tomato plants were identified by gas
   chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry. Experiments with a CMV mutant
   unable to express the 2b RNA silencing suppressor protein and with
   Arabidopsis silencing mutants implicate microRNAs in regulating emission
   of pollinator-perceivable volatiles. In tomato, CMV infection made
   plants emit volatiles attractive to bumblebees. Bumblebees pollinate
   tomato by `buzzing' (sonicating) the flowers, which releases pollen and
   enhances self-fertilization and seed production as well as pollen
   export. Without buzz-pollination, CMV infection decreased seed yield,
   but when flowers of mock-inoculated and CMV-infected plants were
   buzz-pollinated, the increased seed yield for CMV-infected plants was
   similar to that for mock-inoculated plants. Increased pollinator
   preference can potentially increase plant reproductive success in two
   ways: i) as female parents, by increasing the probability that ovules
   are fertilized; ii) as male parents, by increasing pollen export.
   Mathematical modeling suggested that over a wide range of conditions in
   the wild, these increases to the number of offspring of infected
   susceptible plants resulting from increased pollinator preference could
   outweigh underlying strong selection pressures favoring pathogen
   resistance, allowing genes for disease susceptibility to persist in
   plant populations. We speculate that enhanced pollinator service for
   infected individuals in wild plant populations might provide mutual
   benefits to the virus and its susceptible hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogate species have a long history of use in research and regulatory
   settings to understand the potentially harmful effects of toxic
   substances including pesticides. More recently, surrogate species have
   been used to evaluate the potential effects of proteins contained in
   genetically engineered insect resistant (GEIR) crops. Species commonly
   used in GEIR crop testing include beneficial organisms such as
   honeybees, arthropod predators, and parasitoids. The choice of
   appropriate surrogates is influenced by scientific factors such as the
   knowledge of the mode of action and the spectrum of activity as well as
   societal factors such as protection goals that assign value to certain
   ecosystem services such as pollination or pest control. The primary
   reasons for using surrogates include the inability to test all possible
   organisms, the restrictions on using certain organisms in testing (e.g.,
   rare, threatened, or endangered species), and the ability to achieve
   greater sensitivity and statistical power by using laboratory testing of
   certain species. The acceptance of surrogate species data can allow
   results from one region to be applied or ``transported{''} for use in
   another region. On the basis of over a decade of using surrogate species
   to evaluate potential effects of GEIR crops, it appears that the current
   surrogates have worked well to predict effects of GEIR crops that have

Abstract = {{Newly formed refugia for open landscape species within otherwise
   afforested temperate landscape suffer from a lack of sustainability.
   Here, we test the hypothesis proposing off-road motorcycling as a
   long-term stressor, which could be responsible for the long-term
   sustainability of afforested habitat patches, particularly those formed
   in (post-)industrial areas, such as sandpits, claypits, quarries and ash
   and slug tailing ponds. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed assemblages
   of bees and wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) within 19 off-road motorcycle
   circuits distributed across the Czech Republic, representing circuits
   subject to high- and low-intensity use, as well as recently closed
   circuits. Off-road motorcycle circuits were associated with specific
   assemblages of bees and wasps, many of which were of conservation
   interest. Open landscape species, in particular, as well as those
   requiring the presence of solitary, sun-exposed trees, thrived under
   such conditions. Formation of off-road motorcycle circuits, particularly
   those with low intensity traffic, should be considered an appropriate
   tool supporting the biodiversity in the highly cultivated landscape of
   Central Europe, as they host highly diverse assemblages of specialist
   pollinators and other hymenopterans. Aculeata were sensitive to both the
   presence and intensity of off-road traffic. The species richness and
   abundance of red-listed Aculeata were associated with the presence of a
   fine-grained substrate, low-intensity off-road traffic and high
   diversity of E-2 plant species and E-1 red-listed plant species. In
   contrast, the overall abundance of Aculeata was not sensitive to any of
   these factors. There were no aculeate families specifically associated
   with closed off-road motorcycle circuits. Off-road motorcycle circuits
   should be considered to be an appropriate form of reclamation of closed
   quarries, sandpits and claypits, considering that off-road motorcycles
   can potentially be used as a management tool to block the afforestation
   of habitats formed at post-industrial sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Signatures of a globally optimal searching strategy in the
   three-dimensional foraging flights of bumblebees}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{Simulated annealing is a powerful stochastic search algorithm for
   locating a global maximum that is hidden among many poorer local maxima
   in a search space. It is frequently implemented in computers working on
   complex optimization problems but until now has not been directly
   observed in nature as a searching strategy adopted by foraging animals.
   We analysed high-speed video recordings of the three-dimensional
   searching flights of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) made in the presence
   of large or small artificial flowers within a 0.5m(3) enclosed arena.
   Analyses of the three-dimensional flight patterns in both conditions
   reveal signatures of simulated annealing searches. After leaving a
   flower, bees tend to scan back-and forth past that flower before making
   prospecting flights (loops), whose length increases over time. The
   search pattern becomes gradually more expansive and culminates when
   another rewarding flower is found. Bees then scan back and forth in the
   vicinity of the newly discovered flower and the process repeats. This
   looping search pattern, in which flight step lengths are typically
   power-law distributed, provides a relatively simple yet highly efficient
   strategy for pollinators such as bees to find best quality resources in
   complex environments made of multiple ephemeral feeding sites with
   nutritionally variable rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Availability of mass flowering plants in landscapes dominated by
   agriculture can have a strong positive impact on the density of
   generalist, native pollinators. Row-crop production in Iowa accounts for
   75\% of the arable acres, with corn, Zea mays, representing the majority
   of hectares planted. To date, there has been no description of the
   insect pollinator community found within Iowa cornfields. We report a
   field study to determine the optimal sampling methodology to
   characterize the community of insect pollinators within cornfields.
   During 2012 and 2013, 3,616 insect pollinators representing 51 species
   were captured using bee bowls, and 945 individuals representing 10
   species were captured using sticky cards. We examined the effects of
   trap type, height, and bowl color on the described community. Bee bowls
   captured a more abundant and species rich community than sticky cards
   with all species captured on sticky cards also present in bee bowls.
   Traps deployed at the height of the tassels describe a more abundant and
   species rich community of pollinators than traps at ear height (2x as
   many individuals) or ground height (4x as many individuals). Blue bowls
   captured more bees than white (2.75x as many individuals) or yellow
   bowls (3.5x as many individuals); and yellow bowls captured more flies

Title = {{Flower diversity and bee reproduction in an arid ecosystem}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Diverse flower communities are more stable in floral
   resource production along the flowering season, but the question about
   how the diversity and stability of resources affect pollinator
   reproduction remains open. High plant diversity could favor short
   foraging trips, which in turn would enhance bee fitness. In addition to
   plant diversity, greater temporal stability of floral resources in
   diverse communities could favor pollinator fitness because such
   communities are likely to occupy the phenological space more broadly,
   increasing floral availability for pollinators throughout the season. In
   addition, this potential effect of flower diversity on bee reproduction
   could be stronger for generalist pollinators because they can use a
   broader floral spectrum. Based on above arguments we predicted that
   pollinator reproduction would be positively correlated to flower
   diversity, and to temporal stability in flower production, and that this
   relationship would be stronger for the most generalized pollinator
   species.
   Materials and Methods: Using structural equation models, we evaluated
   the effect of these variables and other ecological factors on three
   estimates of bee reproduction (average number of brood cells per nest
   per site, total number of brood cells per site, and total number of
   nests per site), and whether such effects were modulated by bee
   generalization on floral resources.
   Results: Contrary to our expectations, flower diversity had no effect on
   bee reproduction, stability in flower production had a weakly negative
   effect on one of the bee reproductive variables, and the strength of the
   fitness-diversity relationship was unrelated to bee generalization. In
   contrast, elevation had a negative effect on bee reproduction, despite
   the narrow elevation range encompassed by our sites.
   Discussion: Flower diversity did not affect the reproduction of the
   solitary bees studied here. This result could stem from the context
   dependence of the diversity-stability relationship, given that elevation
   had a positive effect on flower diversity but a negative effect on bee
   reproduction. Although high temporal stability in flower production is
   expected to enhance pollinator reproduction, in our study it had a
   weakly negative-instead of positive-effect on the average number of
   brood cells per nest. Other environmental factors that vary with
   elevation could influence bee reproduction. Our study focused on a small
   group of closely-related bee species, which cautions against
   generalization of our findings to other groups of pollinators. More
   studies are clearly needed to assess the extent to which pollinator
   demography is influenced by the diversity of floral resources.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important wild and managed

   bees into risk assessments for pesticides, but standardized methods for
   assessing hazards of pesticides in semi field and field settings have
   not yet been established for bumble bees. During semi-field studies,
   colonies are caged with pesticide-treated flowering surrogate plants,
   which must be attractive to foragers to ensure colony exposure to the
   test compound, land must produce an ample nectar and pollen to sustain
   colonies during testing. However, it is not known which plant(s) are
   suitable for use in semi-field studies with bumble bees.
   Materials and Methods. We compared B. impatiens foraging activity and
   colony development on small plots of flowering buckwheat (Fagopyrum
   esculentum,. var. common), red clover (Trifolium pratense), and purple
   tansy (Phacelia tanacetifolia) under semi-field conditions to assess
   their suitability as surrogate plants for pesticide risk assessment
   studies with bumble bees. We also compared the growth characteristics
   and input requirements of each plant type.
   Results. All three plant types generally established and grew well. Red
   clover and purple tansy experienced significant weed pressure and/or
   insect pest damage. In contrast, pest pressure was extremely low in
   buckwheat. Overall, B. impatiens foraging activity was significantly
   greater on buckwheat plots than red clover or purple tansy, but plant
   type had Ino effect on number of individuals produced per colony or
   colony weight.
   Discussion. Because of the consistently high foraging activity and
   successful colony development observed on buckwheat plots, combined with
   its favourable growth characteristics and low maintenance requirements,
   we recommend buckwheat as a surrogate plant for use in semi-field
   pesticide toxicity assessments with B. impatiens.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide pollinator declines are attributed to a number of factors,

   leaf, nectar, honey, and bee bread at organic and seed-treated farms.
   Total glycogen, lipids, and protein from honey bee workers were
   quantified. The proportion of plants testing positive for clothianidin

   Results: The maximum number of flowers was recorded in irregular types
   of inflorescence, i.e., 434.80 flowers/inflorescence. Fruit setting
   (bud) was higher in open pollinated mango trees (i.e.
   37.00/inflorescence) than enclosed pollination by blow flies (i.e.
   22.34/inflorescence). The size of the mango fruit was the highest (5.06
   mm) in open pollinated tree than those pollinated by blow flies (3.93
   mm) and followed by without any pollinator (3.18 mm) at marble stage. We
   found that the maximum weight of mango fruit (201.19 g) was in open
   pollinated trees.
   Discussion: The results demonstrated that blow flies can be used as
   effective mango pollinators along with other flies and bees. The blow
   flies have shown a positive impact on the quality and quantity of mango.
   This study will be helpful in future and also applicable at farm level
   to use blow flies as pollinators that are cheap and easy to rear.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem services (ES) such as pollination are vital for the continuous
   supply of food to a growing human population, but the decline in
   populations of insect pollinators worldwide poses a threat to food and
   nutritional security. Using a pollinator (honeybee) exclusion approach,
   we evaluated the impact of pollinator scarcity on production in four
   brassica fields, two producing hybrid seeds and two producing
   open-pollinated ones. There was a clear reduction in seed yield as
   pollination rates declined. Open-pollinated crops produced significantly
   higher yields than did the hybrid ones at all pollination rates. The
   hybrid crops required at least 0.50 of background pollination rates to
   achieve maximum yield, whereas in open-pollinated crops, 0.25
   pollination rates were necessary for maximum yield. The total estimated
   economic value of pollination services provided by honeybees to the
   agricultural industry in New Zealand is NZD \$1.96 billion annually.
   This study indicates that loss of pollination services can result in
   significant declines in production and have serious implications for the
   market economy in New Zealand. Depending on the extent of honeybee
   population decline, and assuming that results in declining pollination
   services, the estimated economic loss to New Zealand agriculture could
   be in the range of NZD \$295728 million annually.}},

Number = {{113}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Here's a look at what's coming up in the July 2016 issue of JoVE: The
   Journal of Visualized Experiments.
   In JoVE Neuroscience, gustatory perception - or taste - is an important
   factor for pollinating insects and the flowers that they feed from. Most
   studies have used restrained honeybees to study gustatory responses
   towards nutrients and toxins. This month, Ma et al. present a new
   behavioral assay that uses freely moving bumblebees to measure how
   different compounds influence their feeding behavior. This assay will be
   useful to pollination biologists, toxicologists, and neuroethologists
   studying the bumblebee's taste system.
   In JoVE Environment, trace metal measurements in natural waters are
   often inaccurate due to inadequate sampling and analytical techniques.
   In fact, using improved techniques, researchers are finding that true
   concentrations of dissolved trace metals may be orders of magnitude
   lower than previously thought. So Jiann et al. present a protocol for
   clean sampling and trace metal analysis of river and estuary waters.
   They present techniques for reducing contamination throughout all phases
   of trace metal analysis. The improved data quality allows accurate
   assessment of trace metals and their relationships to environmental
   parameters.
   In JoVE Engineering, Janus colloids are special nanoparticles that have
   multiple chemical, physical, and structural properties - making them
   attractive tools for biomedical applications. Campbell et al. present a
   method to prepare catalytically active Janus colloids that ``swim{''} in
   fluids, and determine their 3D motion using fluorescence microscopy.
   With this method, 3D trajectories are obtained for the swimming colloid,
   which allows accurate measurement of swimming velocity and other
   physical phenomena.
   In JoVE Behavior, vision problems can have a major impact on
   development. But in young children or those with intellectual
   disabilities, it is often difficult quantitatively assess visual
   problems, which limits accurate diagnostics. To overcome these problems,
   Kooiker et al. describe a method for quantifying visual information
   processing. A remote eye tracker measures eye movements in response to
   different visual stimuli - providing valuable information for vision
   assessment and rehabilitation.

   the functional connectivity of an orchid bee (Eulaema atleticana
   Nemesio, 2009) with a high fidelity to forest habitats in the Brazilian
   Atlantic Forest Corridor by analyzing genetic diversity, spatial genetic
   structure, and gene flow estimated from microsatellite and mitochondrial
   markers. Genetic diversity was not correlated with area of the forest
   fragments, or with forest isolation. At the mosaic scale, Eulaema
   atleticana showed no significant or low genetic differentiation,
   indicating genetic homogeneity among forest fragments. A previous field
   study indicated that Eulaema atleticana was one of the most sensitive
   Euglossina bees to forest fragmentation but the present molecular
   analyses demonstrates that current gene flow is sufficient to maintain

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Bombus terrestris, commonly known as the buff-tailed bumblebee, is
   native to Europe, parts of Africa and Asia. It is commercially bred for
   use as a pollinator of greenhouse crops. Larvae pupate within a silken
   cocoon that they construct from proteins produced in modified salivary
   glands. The amino acid composition and protein structure of hand drawn
   B. terrestris, silk fibres was investigated through the use of
   micro-Raman spectroscopy. Spectra were obtained from single fibres drawn
   from the larvae salivary gland at a rate of 0.14 cm/s. Raman
   spectroscopy enabled the identification of poly(alanine),
   poly(alanine-glycine), phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine, which
   is consistent with the results of amino acid analysis. The dominant
   protein conformation was found to be coiled coil (73\%) while the -sheet
   content of 10\% is, as expected, lower than those reported for hornets
   and ants. Polarized Raman spectra revealed that the coiled coils were
   highly aligned along the fibre axis while the -sheet and random coil
   components had their peptide carbonyl groups roughly perpendicular to
   the fibre axis. The protein orientation distribution is compared to
   those of other natural and recombinant silks. A structural model for the

Abstract = {{Pollen plays a dual role as both a gametophyte and a nutritional reward
   for pollinators. Although pollen chemistry varies across plant species,
   its functional significance in pollination has remained obscure, in part
   because little is known about how floral visitors assess it. Bees rely
   on pollen for protein, but whether foragers evaluate its chemistry is
   unclear, as it is primarily consumed by larvae. We asked whether the
   chemical composition of pollen influences bumblebees' foraging
   behaviour. Using putatively sweet and bitter pollen blends, we found
   that chemical composition influenced two aspects of bee behaviour
   relevant to plant fitness: the amount of pollen collected and the
   likelihood of subsequently visiting a visually similar flower. These
   findings offer a new perspective on the nutritional ecology of
   plant-pollinator interactions, as they show that pollen's taste may
   mediate its collection and transfer.}},

Title = {{Evolution and diversity of floral scent chemistry in the euglossine
   bee-pollinated orchid genus Gongora}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{135-148}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Animal-pollinated angiosperms have evolved a variety
   of signalling mechanisms to attract pollinators. Floral scent is a key
   component of pollinator attraction, and its chemistry modulates both
   pollinator behaviour and the formation of plant- pollinator networks.
   The neotropical orchid genus Gongora exhibits specialized pollinator
   associations with male orchid bees ( Euglossini). Male bees visit orchid
   flowers to collect volatile chemical compounds that they store in hind-
   leg pouches to use subsequently during courtship display. Hence, Gongora
   floral scent compounds simultaneously serve as signalling molecules and
   pollinator rewards. Furthermore, because floral scent acts as the
   predominant reproductive isolating barrier among lineages, it has been
   hypothesized that chemical traits are highly species specific. A
   comparative analysis of intra- and inter- specific variation of floral
   scent chemistry was conducted to investigate the evolutionary patterns
   across the genus.
   Methods Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to analyse
   the floral scent of 78 individuals belonging to 28 different species of
   Gongora from two of the three major lineages sampled across the
   neotropical region. Multidimensional scaling and indicator value
   analyses were implemented to investigate the patterns of chemical
   diversity within and among taxonomic groups at various geographic
   scales. Additionally, pollinator observations were conducted on a
   sympatric community of Gongora orchids exhibiting distinct floral scent
   phenotypes.
   aEuro cent Key Results A total of 83 floral volatiles, mainly terpenes
   and aromatic compounds, were detected. Many of the identified compounds
   are common across diverse angiosperm families (e.g. cineole, eugenol,
   beta-ocimene, beta-pinene and terpinen-4-ol), while others are
   relatively rare outside euglossine bee-pollinated orchid lineages.
   Additionally, 29 volatiles were identified that are known to attract and
   elicit collection behaviour in male bees. Floral scent traits were less
   variable within species than between species, and the analysis revealed
   exceptional levels of cryptic diversity. Gongora species were divided
   into 15 fragrance groups based on shared compounds. Fragrance groups
   indicate that floral scent variation is not predicted by taxonomic rank
   or biogeographic region.
   aEuro cent Conclusions Gongora orchids emit a diverse array of scent
   molecules that are largely species specific, and closely related taxa
   exhibit qualitatively and quantitatively divergent chemical profiles. It
   is shown that within a community, Gongora scent chemotypes are
   correlated with near non-overlapping bee pollinator assemblies. The
   results lend support to the hypothesis that floral scent traits regulate
   the architecture of bee pollinator associations. Thus, Gongora provides
   unique opportunities to examine the interplay between floral traits and
   pollinator specialization in plant-pollinator mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive ants can influence abundance and diversity of insect
   pollinators, and this effect may be expected to be especially strong on
   oceanic islands. We examined abundance of native Hylaeus bees and
   patterns of flower visitation to three native Hawaiian plant species
   (Leptecophylla tameiameiae, Santalum haleakalae, and Geranium cuneatum)
   in presence and absence of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile)
   in the subalpine shrubland of Haleakala volcano. Native bees, nonnative
   honeybees, and microlepidoptera were responsible for the majority of
   visits to flowers of the three plant species. Ants visited flowers of S.
   haleakalae and G. cuneatum relatively commonly in ant-invaded zones but
   were less common or absent on flowers of L. tameiameiae in the same
   zones. Zones with ants had fewer Hylaeus bees in yellow pan traps than
   the zone without ants, and overall flower visitation rates to one plant
   species, G. cuneatum, were six times lower in sites containing ants. In
   one of two observation years, flower visitation to L. tameiameiae was
   also reduced in sites containing ants. Results suggest that Argentine
   ants may cause a reduction of native Hylaeus bee abundances; however,
   other factors correlated with elevation cannot be ruled out as the cause
   of differences in Hylaeus abundances across our sites.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators are essential for both the production of a large
   proportion of world crops and the health of natural ecosystems. As
   important pollinators, bumblebees must learn to forage on flowers to
   feed both themselves and provision their colonies.
   Increased use of pesticides has caused concern over sublethal effects on
   bees, such as impacts on reproduction or learning ability. However,
   little is known about how sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels
   of pesticide might affect the ability of bees to visit and manipulate
   flowers.
   We observed the behaviour of individual bumblebees from colonies
   chronically exposed to a neonicotinoid pesticide (10ppb thiamethoxam) or
   control solutions foraging for the first time on an array of
   morphologically complex wildflowers (Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium
   repens) in an outdoor flight arena.
   We found that more bees released from pesticide-treated colonies became
   foragers, and that they visited more L.corniculatus flowers than
   controls. Interestingly, bees exposed to pesticide collected pollen more
   often than controls, but control bees learnt to handle flowers
   efficiently after fewer learning visits than bees exposed to pesticide.
   There were also different initial floral preferences of our treatment
   groups; control bees visited a higher proportion of T.repens flowers,
   and bees exposed to pesticide were more likely to choose L.corniculatus
   on their first visit.
   Our results suggest that the foraging behaviour of bumblebees on real
   flowers can be altered by sublethal exposure to field-realistic levels
   of pesticide. This has implications for the foraging success and
   persistence of bumblebee colonies, but perhaps more importantly for the
   interactions between wild plants and flower-visiting insects and ability
   of bees to deliver the crucial pollination services to plants necessary
   for ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation and forest fragmentation are contributing to declines in
   crop pollinator populations worldwide. Several studies have examined the
   impact of forest proximity on plant pollination ecology, but
   concentrated on single crop species. However, it can be more informative
   to investigate multiple crop and pollinator species in a community,
   because different pollinator groups may respond differently to forest
   distance. We evaluated flower visitor diversity, visitation frequency,
   and fruit set for three crop species (rambutan, durian and mango) in 10
   pairs of mixed fruit orchards. Each pair consisted of one orchard near
   to (< 1 km) and one orchard far from (> 7 km) the forest edge. Rambutan
   fruit set was significantly influenced by distance to forest. The main
   visitors of rambutan flowers were stingless bees. In contrast, the
   dominant visitors to durian and mango flowers were nectarivorous bats
   and flies, respectively, and the fruit set of these crops were not
   significantly influenced by distance to forest. However, durian fruit
   set was negatively affected by distance to the nearest cave inhabited by
   nectarivorous bats. This study demonstrates that both caves and forests
   can be important pollinator sources for agricultural crops, and that the
   dispersal success of pollinators is related to isolation from source
   habitats. Maintaining forest patches and limestone karsts may provide
   stepping stones across fragmented landscapes, and attract greater
   numbers of pollinators to agricultural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima provide examples of effects

   of plants causing anther-smut disease in Chernobyl, its viability,
   fertility and karyotype variation, and the accumulation of nonsynonymous

   latifolia from locations ranging by more than two orders of magnitude in
   background radiation, from 0.05 to 21.03 mu Gy/h. Disease prevalence
   decreased significantly with increasing radiation level, possibly due to
   lower pollinator abundance and altered pollinator behaviour. Viability
   and fertility, measured as the budding rate of haploid sporidia
   following meiosis from the diploid teliospores, did not vary with
   increasing radiation levels and neither did karyotype overall structure

   found no significant evidence of increased deleterious mutation rates at
   higher levels of background radiation in this plant pathogen. We even
   found lower levels of nonsynonymous substitution rates in contaminated
   areas compared to control regions, suggesting that purifying selection
   was stronger in contaminated than uncontaminated areas. We briefly
   discuss the possibilities for a mechanistic basis of radio resistance in

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation affects a wide variety of biological variables
   including species' abundance and richness (population demography),
   phenology, male and female reproductive fitness, and it also affects the
   degree of specialization versus generalization of pollination networks.
   Evidence is accumulating that suggests that habitat fragmentation can
   have significant impacts on plant-pollinator interactions. In this
   article, we review the literature on habitat fragmentation effects on
   plants, pollinators, and the pollination network. We also discuss
   pollination network mechanisms that may be affected by habitat
   fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations and affects
   ecological properties at both population and community levels. Evidence
   shows that habitat size and connectivity directly or indirectly
   influence the abundance of both plant and pollinator species. In
   general, plant and pollinator diversity and population size decrease
   with the decreasing size and habitat connectivity. Habitat fragmentation
   of plant communities can shift plant phenological patterns, contract
   flowering periods and increase the risk of local pollinator extirpation.
   Fragmentation has the potential to influence pollination dynamics by
   altering pollinator or plant densities and by altering pollinator
   behavior. However, evidence for the impact of habitat fragmentation on
   plant species' flowering phenology is relatively limited, and little is
   known about the effect of habitat fragmentation on the phenology of
   pollinators. Habitat fragmentation also leads to reduced reproduction in
   many species. In contrast, other species showed neutral or positive
   responses to habitat fragmentation in female reproductive fitness,
   especially in plants regularly affected by pollen limitation and
   pollination limitation which lead to plants' experience selection for
   increased autogamy in isolated habitats. Habitat fragmentation often
   leads to the extirpation of specialist species and results in an influx
   of generalists. However, studies have shown that pollinators tend to be
   more generalized as habitat fragmentation increases. The reason is that
   habitat fragmentation changes the composition of the flora, and scatters
   floral resources, so any remaining pollinators may need to behave as
   generalists in order to survive. However, the knowledge of potential
   ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation is limited, especially
   regarding the effects on a long-term scale and at landscape scales. We
   propose experiments involving long-term monitoring, permanent samples of
   flowering plants, pollinators, and their interactions at large spatial
   and temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Most species in Melastomataceae have poricidal anthers related to
   specialised bee buzz-pollination, while some have anthers with large
   openings associated to non-bee pollination systems. We tracked the
   evolution of anther morphology and seed number on the Miconieae
   phylogenetic tree to understand the evolutionary shifts in such
   pollination systems. Anther morphometric data and seed number were
   recorded for 54 taxa. Pollinators (bees, flies, wasps) were recorded for
   20 available species. Ancestral state reconstruction was made using
   Maximum Likelihood from nrITS sequences. We used phylogenetic
   eigenvector regressions to estimate phylogenetic signal and the adaptive
   component for these traits. Species pollinated by bees or bees and wasps
   tend to have smaller pores and fruits with more seeds. Species
   pollinated by flies or flies and bees and/or wasps tend to have larger
   pores and fruits with less seeds. Independent evolution occurred three
   times for anthers with large pores and twice for fruits with few seeds.
   We detected a phylogenetic signal in both traits, and negative
   correlated evolution between them. In actinomorphic small-flowered
   Miconieae, changes in anther morphology can be related to generalisation
   in the pollination system incorporating flies and wasps as pollinators
   and lessening the importance of buzzing bees in such process.
   Differences in pollen removal and deposition may explain differences in
   anther morphology and seed number in Miconieae.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary rainforest remnants might contribute to biodiversity
   conservation and preservation of healthy interspecific interactions with

   trap-nesting bees along a fragmentation gradient of secondary forest
   remnants in Costa Rica. Fragment size did not affect bee abundance,
   diversity, and parasitism and mortality rates. However, height and edge
   effects influenced bee communities. Bees were more abundant in the
   canopy and the understory compared to an intermediate height, and bee
   diversity was higher in the canopy. Tree location (forest edge,
   intermediate distance, forest center) did not affect abundance but did
   affect bee diversity since most species preferred the forest interior.
   The cuckoo bees Aglaomelissa duckei and Coelioxys sp. 1 only partly
   followed their hosts' patterns, two Centris species. We conclude that an
   increasing amount of edge habitat will have negative consequences for

Abstract = {{Alien invasive plant species can affect pollination, reproductive
   success and population dynamics of co-flowering native species via
   shared pollinators. Consequences may range from reproductive competition
   to facilitation, but the ecological drivers determining the type and
   magnitude of such indirect interactions remain poorly understood. Here,
   we examine the role of the spatial scale of invader presence and
   spatially contingent behavioural responses of different pollinator
   groups as potential key drivers, using the invasive Oxalis pes-caprae
   and the self-incompatible native annual Diplotaxis erucoides as a model
   system. Three treatments were assigned to native focal plants: (1)
   invader present at the landscape scale (hectares) but experimentally
   removed at the floral neighbourhood scale (pa); (2) invader present at
   both scales (pp); (3) invader absent at both scales (aa). Interestingly,
   we found pronounced spatially contingent differences in the responses of
   pollinators: honeybees and bumblebees were strongly attracted into
   invaded sites at the landscape scale, translating into native plant
   visitation facilitation through honeybees, while bumblebees almost
   exclusively visited Oxalis. Non-corbiculate wild bees, in contrast,
   showed less pronounced responses in foraging behavior, primarily at the
   floral neighborhood scale. Average heterospecific (Oxalis) pollen
   deposition onto stigmas of Diplotaxis was low (<1 \%), but higher in the
   pp than in the pa treatment. Hand-pollination of Diplotaxis with Oxalis
   and conspecific pollen, however, reduced seed set by more than half when
   compared to hand-pollination with only conspecific pollen. Seed set of
   Diplotaxis, finally, was increased by 14 \% (reproductive facilitation)
   in the pp treatment, while it was reduced by 27 \% (reproductive
   competition) in the pa treatment compared to uninvaded populations. Our
   study highlights the crucial role of spatial scale and pollinator guild

Abstract = {{Pear and apple are among the main fruit crops worldwide. These species
   can be planted in mixed orchards, and they both depend on insect
   pollination for fruit set. As pollinating insects are attracted by the
   floral resources, we investigated nectar and pollen production and
   chemical composition in four pear ('Concorde', `Conference', `Doyenne du
   Cornice', `Triomphe de Vienne') and five apple ('Braeburn', `Golden
   Reinders', lonagored', `Pinova', `Wellant') cultivars commonly grown in
   Belgium. We also investigated whether insect flower visitation rate and
   pollination efficiency are linked to floral resource quantity and
   quality. The pear cultivars flowered one week before the apple cultivars
   in early spring, and their flowers were about six times less visited by
   insects. The visitors foraged more on the pollen of the pear trees and
   the nectar of the apple trees. Pear flowers produced higher volumes of
   nectar than apple flowers (1.3-3.2 mu l vs. 0.4-0.6 mu l), but with
   lower sugar concentration (9.6\%-10.8\% vs. 28.3\%-36.4\%). Pear flowers
   also produced fewer pollen grains per anther than apple flowers
   (2425-4937 vs. 3284-7919), but these had higher polypeptide (346-362 mu
   g/mg vs. 216-303 mu g/mg), amino-acid (40-77 mu g/mg vs. 12-18 mu g/mg)
   and phytosterol (21-47 mu g/mg vs. 15-43 mu g/mg) concentrations. The
   foraging behavior of the insects is thus better explained by nectar and
   pollen quality rather than quantity. Despite the differences in flower
   visitation rates, pollination of both species resulted in valuable fruit
   production. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research. Pollination syndromes are suites of correlated
   characters that reflect selection by most frequent and effective
   pollinators. However, the floral phenotypes of some angiosperm species
   combine traits from different pollination syndromes. The aim of this
   study was to assess the correspondence between floral traits and floral
   visitors, considering the breeding systems of two co-occurring Drymonia
   species with mixed floral phenotypes.
   Methodology. We assessed floral morphology, nectar production patterns,
   frequency of floral visitation, breeding systems, and natural fruit set
   in Drymonia strigosa and Drymonia oinochrophylla species at Los Tuxtlas,
   Veracruz, Mexico, during 2011-2014. We also conducted a field test of
   reproductive assurance in D. strigosa, the only species with a high
   potential for autonomous self-pollination.
   Pivotal results. In D. strigosa, morphology and nectar production
   patterns correspond to the ornithophilous syndrome; however, anthers
   have poricidal dehiscence, a trait associated with bee pollination.
   Hummingbirds were the most frequent floral visitors, and stingless bees
   were less frequent visitors acting mostly as nectar robbers. The species
   has a high autofertility potential, but autonomous self-pollination
   contributed little to fruit set during the study years. In D.
   oinochrophylla, most floral traits correspond to the melittophilous
   syndrome; however, high nectar production and large flower size resemble
   traits of chiropterophilous flowers. Primary pollinators were bees with
   less frequent visits by butterflies and moths; bats were not observed
   during the study period. Drymonia oinochrophylla is self-compatible, but
   it has little potential for autonomous self-pollination; therefore, seed
   production is highly dependent on pollinators.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that mixed floral phenotypes in the two
   Drymonia species are not likely a consequence of visitation by multiple
   pollinator functional groups. Instead, incomplete correspondence of
   floral traits with classic pollination syndromes may represent
   undetected floral visitors in disturbed environments or plesiomorphies
   retained throughout the evolutionary history of the genus Drymonia.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary compounds in nectar can function as toxic chemical defences
   against floral antagonists, but may also mediate plant-pollinator
   interactions. Despite their ecological importance, few studies have
   investigated patterns of spatial variation in toxic nectar compounds in
   plant species, and none outside their native range. Grayanotoxin I (GTX
   I) occurs in nectar of invasive Rhododendron ponticum where it is toxic
   to honeybees and some solitary bee species. We examined (i) geographic
   variation in the composition of nectar GTX I, as well as GTX III (which
   is not toxic to these species), in the native and introduced range of
   R.ponticum, (ii) how their expression is structured at patch and
   landscape scales within ranges, and (iii) whether climatic and
   environmental factors underpin spatial patterns. While both GTXs varied
   within ranges, variation in GTX I, but not GTX III, was detected between
   ranges. GTX I expression was thus markedly lower or (in 18\% of cases)
   absent from nectar in introduced plants. Spatial autocorrelation was
   apparent at both patch and landscape scales and in part related to heat
   load interception by plants (a function of latitude, aspect and slope).
   As expression of nectar GTXs was generally robust to environmental
   variation, and aggregated in space, this trait has the potential to be
   spatially discriminated by consumers. Given the specificity of change to
   GTX I, and its differential toxicity to some bee species, we conclude
   that its expression was likely to have been influenced during invasion
   by interaction with herbivores/consumers, either via pollinator-mediated
   selection or enemy release from floral antagonists.Synthesis. As the
   first demonstration of large-scale geographic variation and spatial
   structure in toxic nectar compounds, this work deepens our understanding
   of the chemical ecology of floral interactions in native and introduced
   species. Spatially explicit studies of nectar secondary compounds are
   thus required to show how the extent and structure of spatial variation
   may affect floral ecology. Future development of invasion theory should
   incorporate a holistic view of plant defence, beyond antagonistic
   interactions, which integrates the consequences of chemically defended
   mutualist rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Highbush blueberry is an economically important crop across North
   America and has become important worldwide. Under certain climatic
   conditions experienced in various geographical regions, fruit set in
   blueberry remains relatively poor and contributes to reduced yields. The
   mechanisms contributing to fruit set are complex. Poor fruit set may be
   associated with improper or incomplete pollination, inadequate nutrient
   availability, disease pressure, or poor climatic conditions experienced
   during critical stages of flowering and fruit set. Improving fruit set
   in blueberry necessitates the evaluation of floral morphology and the
   impact of morphology on pollinator efficiency. Pollination requirements
   as they relate to floral morphology among specific cultivars of
   blueberry and pollen saturation, as well as the assessment of nutrient
   applications and their impact on reproductive processes pivotal for
   fruit set and development, are also in need of further investigation.
   The objective of this report is to provide a review of the literature
   addressing pollination and fruit set of highbush blueberry. The
   development of reproductive buds and flowers are impacted by nutrient
   availability and associated metabolic compounds and processes. Calcium
   and boron may be of specific importance for reproductive developmental
   processes and the requirements, roles, and potential application of
   these nutrients will be discussed. Variation exists in floral morphology
   across blueberry cultivars. Additional consideration is given to this
   variation and how it may impact the efficiency of pollination by primary
   commercial pollinators. Additionally, the efficacy of pollination may be
   influenced by pollinator species, the interaction between species of
   pollinator and cultivar of blueberry, and the environmental conditions
   during bloom time. These issues are important to understand, especially
   when considering the development of solutions for the improvement of
   fruit set for this economically important crop.}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in habitat restoration is targeting the key aspects of
   a species' niche for enhancement, particularly for species that use a
   diverse set of habitat features. However, restoration that focuses on
   limited aspects of a species' niche may neglect other resources that are
   critical to population persistence. We evaluated the ability of native
   plant hedgerows, planted to increase pollen and nectar resources for
   wild bees in agricultural landscapes, to provide suitable nesting
   habitat and enhance nesting rates of ground-nesting bees. We found that,
   when compared to unmanaged field edges (controls), hedgerows did not
   augment most indicators of nest habitat quality (bare ground, soil
   surface irregularity, and soil hardness), although coarser soils were
   associated with higher incidence and richness of nesting bees. Hedgerows
   did not augment nesting rates when compared to control edges. Although
   all the bee species we detected nesting were also found foraging on
   floral resources, the foraging versus nesting assemblages found within a
   site were highly dissimilar. These results may reflect sampling error;
   or, species found foraging but not nesting in hedgerows could be
   utilizing hedgerows as ``partial habitats,{''} nesting outside hedgerow
   plantings but foraging on the floral resources they provide. We conclude
   that although hedgerows are known to provide critical floral resources
   to wild bees especially in resource-poor intensive agricultural
   landscapes, simply increasing vegetative diversity and structure may not
   be simultaneously enhancing nesting habitat for ground-nesting bees.}},

Abstract = {{In Vanilla species (Orchidaceae), the influence of sexual and asexual
   mating systems on the spatial structuring of population genetic
   diversity is understudied. These elements are crucial in restoration
   program to limit inbreeding depression and to maintain the genetic
   diversity of natural populations. In the remnant fragments of tropical
   dry forest in Mayotte (Comoros Archipelago, Indian Ocean), the
   clarification of the reproductive strategies of the orphan leafless
   Vanilla humblotii Rchb. f. will provide a better understanding of its
   fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Approaches combining reproductive
   biology and fine-scale spatial genetic structure analyses using ten
   microsatellite markers in 49 individuals sampled in the only remaining
   large population of V. humblotii were employed to unravel the
   reproductive strategies of this species. The results showed that V.
   humblotii displays unscented flowers and is allogamous and
   pollinator-dependent although also self-compatible. A total absence of
   pollen movements and a low level of natural fruit set (similar to 1\%)
   are reported, although a wild bee (Allodape obscuripennis Strand,
   Xylocopinae) and a bird (Nectarinia coquerelli, Nectarinidae) visited
   the flowers. A high genotypic diversity (G/N = 0.88) and a phalanx
   clonal growth are detected, and seed dispersal is higher than pollen
   dispersal. The phalanx distribution of the repeated genotypes (ramets
   arisen from the same genet) is responsible for significant
   autocorrelations detected at small distances. Limited inbreeding was
   detected although geitonogamy could have been enhanced by vegetative
   reproduction. This study highlights the need to perform
   interdisciplinary studies to unravel the reproductive strategy of clonal
   plant species with a deceptive pollination system. (C) 2016 SAAB.

Abstract = {{Species roles in ecological networks combine to generate their

   diversity also affects ecosystem functioning and resilience, yet it

   transport networks to characterise this relationship. We found that,
   apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits
   either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a
   subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions
   to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche
   specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having
   unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners.
   Conversely, these effects were not detected in plants, potentially
   because key aspects of their flowering traits are conserved at a family
   level. Relating functional and network roles can provide further insight

Abstract = {{The bee tribe Anthidiini (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) is a large,
   cosmopolitan group of solitary bees that exhibit intriguing nesting
   behavior. We present the first molecular-based phylogenetic analysis of
   relationships within Anthidiini using model-based methods and a large,
   multi-locus dataset (five nuclear genes, 5081 base pairs), as well as a
   combined analysis using our molecular dataset in conjunction with a
   previously published morphological matrix. We discuss the evolution of
   nesting behavior in Anthidiini and the relationship between nesting
   material and female mandibular morphology. Following an examination of
   the morphological characters historically used to recognize anthidiine
   genera, we recommend the use of a molecular-based phylogenetic backbone
   to define taxonomic groups prior to the assignment of diagnostic
   morphological characters for these groups. Finally, our results reveal
   the paraphyly of numerous genera and have significant consequences for
   anthidiine classification. In order to promote a classification system
   based on stable, monophyletic clades, we hereby make the following
   changes to Michener's (2007) classification: The subgenera Afranthidium
   (Zosteranthidium) Michener and Griswold, 1994, Afranthidium
   (Branthidium) Pasteels, 1969 and Afranthidium (Immanthidium) Pasteels,

Abstract = {{Animal-mediated pollination is required for the reproduction of the
   majority of angiosperms, and pollinators are therefore essential for
   ecosystem functioning and the economy. Two major threats to insect
   pollinators are anthropogenic land-use change and the spread of
   pathogens, whose effects may interact to impact pollination. Here, we
   investigated the relative effects on the ecosystem service of
   pollination of (i) land-use change brought on by agriculture and
   urbanization as well as (ii) the prevalence of pollinator parasites,
   using experimental insect pollinator-dependent plant species in natural
   pollinator communities. We found that pollinator habitat (i.e.
   availability of nesting resources for ground-nesting bees and local
   flower richness) was strongly related to flower visitation rates at the
   local scale and indirectly influenced plant pollination success. At the
   landscape scale, pollination was positively related to urbanization,
   both directly and indirectly via elevated visitation rates. Bumblebees
   were the most abundant pollinator group visiting experimental flowers.
   Prevalence of trypanosomatids, such as the common bumblebee parasite
   Crithidia bombi, was higher in urban compared with agricultural areas, a
   relationship which was mediated through higher Bombus abundance. Yet, we
   did not find any top-down, negative effects of bumblebee parasitism on
   pollination. We conclude that urban areas can be places of high
   transmission of both pollen and pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Squash was first domesticated in Mexico and is now found throughout

   expanded from the wild host plant's range in Mexico and were established
   by a series of founder events. Eastern North America was most likely
   colonized from squash bee populations in the present-day continental
   Midwest USA and not from routes that followed the Gulf and Atlantic
   coasts from Mexico. Populations of P. pruinosa west of the Rockies
   spread north from the warm deserts much more recently, showing two

Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: As a means of biologically controlling Mikania micrantha
   H.B.K. in Yunnan, China, the influence of sweet potato {[}Ipomoea
   batatas (L.) Lam.] on its reproductive characteristics was studied. The
   trial utilized a de Wit replacement series incorporating six ratios of
   sweet potato and M. micrantha plants in 25 m(2) plots over 2 years.
   Results: Budding of M. micrantha occurred at the end of September;
   flowering and fruiting occurred from October to February. Flowering
   phenology of M. micrantha was delayed (P < 0.05), duration of flowering
   and fruiting was reduced (P < 0.05) and duration of bud formation was
   increased (P < 0.05) with increasing proportions of sweet potato.
   Reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index
   of M. micrantha were significantly reduced (P < 0.05) with increasing
   sweet potato densities. Apidae bees, and Calliphoridae or Syrphidae
   flies were the most abundant visitors to M. micrantha flowers. Overall
   flower visits decreased (P < 0.05) as sweet potato increased. Thus the
   mechanism by which sweet potato suppressed sexual reproduction in M.
   micrantha was essentially two-fold: causing a delay in flowering
   phenology and reducing pollinator visits. The number, biomass, length,
   set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of M. micrantha
   seeds were suppressed (P < 0.05) by sweet potato competition. With
   proportional increases in sweet potato, sexual and asexual seedling
   populations of M. micrantha were significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The
   mortality of both seedling types increased (P < 0.05) with proportional
   increases in sweet potato.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that sweet potato significantly
   suppresses the reproductive ability of the invasive species M.
   micrantha, and is a promising alternative to traditional biological
   control and other methods of control. Planting sweet potato in
   conjunction with other control methods could provide a comprehensive
   strategy for managing M. micrantha. The scenario of controlling M.
   micrantha by utilizing a crop with a similar growth form may provide a
   useful model for similar management strategies in other systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cotton is the most economically and culturally important fiber crop
   worldwide. Though cotton may potentially benefit from animal mediated
   pollination, it is unknown if the species is indeed pollen limited
   across agroecological landscapes. Our study had three objectives: (1)
   identify the land use attributes that impact wild pollinator abundance
   and diversity, (2) investigate the relationship between pollinator
   community composition and cotton pollen limitation and (3) determine the
   extent of direct and indirect effects of land use on pollinator
   community composition and pollination service. To address these
   objectives, we used a combination of pollinator community surveys, GIS
   analysis, and pollen limitation experiments across 12 cotton landscapes
   in South Texas. Overall, we found that pollinator community composition
   was closely related to the abundance of natural areas (250 m radius). We
   also found evidence of substantial cotton pollen limitation, as
   significantly larger bolls were produced with the addition of outcross
   pollen. Further, we reveal that pollen limitation was negatively
   correlated with pollinator abundance and richness. Path analysis
   confirmed the two direct effects of land use composition on pollinator
   community and pollinator community composition on pollen limitation.
   Overall, our results reveal potential for increased crop yields via wild
   pollinator-mediated fruit set, equivalent to more than \$108/acre with a
   regional gain of over \$1.1 million USD. Further, our research provides
   insight into the specific land management practices that support
   pollinator communities within cotton agroecosystems. Cotton landscapes
   that maintain natural areas promote wild pollinator abundance and
   diversity, and subsequently experience reduced pollination limitation
   and increased crop yields. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland biodiversity is strongly declining in most of Western Europe,
   but still survives in traditional low intensity agricultural landscapes
   in Central and Eastern Europe. Accession to the EU however intensifies
   agriculture, which leads to the vanishing of traditional farming. Our
   aim was to describe the pollinator assemblages of the last remnants of
   these landscapes, thus set the baseline of sustainable farming for
   pollination, and to highlight potential measures of conservation. In
   these traditional farmlands in the Transylvanian Basin, Romania (EU
   accession in 2007), we studied the major pollinator groups-wild bees,
   hoverflies and butterflies. Landscape scale effects of semi-natural
   habitats, land cover diversity, the effects of heterogeneity and woody
   vegetation cover and on-site flower resources were tested on pollinator
   communities in traditionally managed arable fields and grasslands. Our
   results showed: (i) semi-natural habitats at the landscape scale have a
   positive effect on most pollinators, especially in the case of low
   heterogeneity of the direct vicinity of the studied sites; (ii) both
   arable fields and grasslands hold abundant flower resources, thus both
   land use types are important in sustaining pollinator communities; (iii)
   thus, pollinator conservation can rely even on arable fields under
   traditional management regime. This has an indirect message that the
   tiny flower margins around large intensive fields in west Europe can be
   insufficient conservation measures to restore pollinator communities at
   the landscape scale, as this is still far the baseline of necessary
   flower resources. This hypothesis needs further study, which includes
   more traditional landscapes providing baseline, and exploration of other
   factors behind the lower than baseline level biodiversity values of
   fields under agri-environmental schemes (AES).}},

Abstract = {{Mimicry illustrates the power of selection to produce phenotypic
   convergence in biology {[}1]. A striking example is the imitation of
   female insects by plants that are pollinated by sexual deception of
   males of the same insect species {[}2-4]. This involves mimicry of
   visual, tactile, and chemical signals of females {[}2-7], especially
   their sex pheromones {[}8-11]. The Mediterranean orchid Ophrys exaltata
   employs chemical mimicry of cuticular hydrocarbons, particularly the
   7-alkenes, in an insect sex pheromone to attract and elicit mating
   behavior in its pollinators, males of the cellophane bee Colletes
   cunicularius {[}11-13]. A difference in alkene double-bond positions is
   responsible for reproductive isolation between O. exaltata and closely
   related species, such as O. sphegodes {[}13-16]. We show that these
   7-alkenes are likely determined by the action of the
   stearoyl-acyl-carrier-protein desaturase (SAD) homolog SAD5. After gene
   duplication, changes in subcellular localization relative to the
   ancestral housekeeping desaturase may have allowed proto-SAD5's reaction
   products to undergo further biosynthesis to both 7- and 9-alkenes. Such
   ancestral coproduction of two alkene classes may have led to
   pollinator-mediated deleterious pleiotropy. Despite possible
   evolutionary intermediates with reduced activity, amino acid changes at
   the bottom of the substrate-binding cavity have conferred enzyme
   specificity for 7-alkene biosynthesis by preventing the binding of
   longer-chained fatty acid (FA) precursors by the enzyme. This change in
   desaturase function enabled the orchid to perfect its chemical mimicry
   of pollinator sex pheromones by escape from deleterious pleiotropy,
   supporting a role of pleiotropy in determining the possible trajectories
   of adaptive evolution.}},

Title = {{Using metabarcoding to reveal and quantify plant-pollinator interactions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{Given the ongoing decline of both pollinators and plants, it is crucial
   to implement effective methods to describe complex pollination networks
   across time and space in a comprehensive and high-throughput way. Here
   we tested if metabarcoding may circumvent the limits of conventional
   methodologies in detecting and quantifying plant-pollinator
   interactions. Metabarcoding experiments on pollen DNA mixtures described
   a positive relationship between the amounts of DNA from focal species
   and the number of trnL and ITS1 sequences yielded. The study of pollen
   loads of insects captured in plant communities revealed that as compared
   to the observation of visits, metabarcoding revealed 2.5 times more
   plant species involved in plant-pollinator interactions. We further
   observed a tight positive relationship between the pollen-carrying
   capacities of insect taxa and the number of trnL and ITS1 sequences. The
   number of visits received per plant species also positively correlated
   to the number of their ITS1 and trnL sequences in insect pollen loads.
   By revealing interactions hard to observe otherwise, metabarcoding
   significantly enlarges the spatiotemporal observation window of
   pollination interactions. By providing new qualitative and quantitative
   information, metabarcoding holds great promise for investigating diverse
   facets of interactions and will provide a new perception of pollination
   networks as a whole.}},

   rearing (25 degrees C, 65\% R.H.). The egg durations of the female and
   male bees were 3.6 +/- 0.8 days and 3.1 +/- 1.3 days, respectively.
   During larval development, the head widths of the 1st to 5th instars
   ranged from 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm to 1.3 +/- 0.1 mm. The peak of the growth in
   head width was the 2nd instar. The larval lengths ranged from 3.7 +/-

Abstract = {{Urban gardens may preserve biodiversity as urban population densities
   increase, but this strongly depends on the characteristics of the
   gardens and the landscapes in which they are embedded. We investigated
   whether local and landscape characteristics are important correlates of
   bee (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) abundance and species richness in urban
   community gardens. We worked in 19 gardens in the California central
   coast and sampled bees with aerial nets and pan traps. We measured local
   characteristics (i.e., vegetation and ground cover) and used the USGS
   National Land Cover Database to classify the landscape surrounding our
   garden study sites at 2 km scales. We classified bees according to
   nesting type (i.e., cavity, ground) and body size and determined which
   local and landscape characteristics correlate with bee community
   characteristics. We found 55 bee species. One landscape and several
   local factors correlated with differences in bee abundance and richness
   for all bees, cavity-nesting bees, ground-nesting bees, and different
   sized bees. Generally, bees were more abundant and species rich in
   bigger gardens, in gardens with higher floral abundance, less mulch
   cover, more bare ground, and with more grass. Medium bees were less
   abundant in sites surrounded by more medium intensity developed land
   within 2 km. The fact that local factors were generally more important
   drivers of bee abundance and richness indicates a potential for
   gardeners to promote bee conservation by altering local management
   practices. In particular, increasing floral abundance, decreasing use of
   mulch, and providing bare ground may promote bees in urban gardens.}},

   temperatures exceeding 44 degrees C. In these conditions, males largely
   stopped foraging but females continued, usually limiting their flower
   visits to a few seconds and making frequent short -flights. These
   flights would cool the bees down, because bees suspended in air were
   cooler than bees in sunlit flowers, and convective cooling during flight
   would further enhance the cooling effect of departure from the flower.

   families, 15 genera, and 61 species of bees that restrict pollen
   foraging to 23 families, 33 genera, and 201 possible species of native

Abstract = {{Wild grapevine (Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris) is the dioecious
   ancestral form of grapevine, from which the domesticated cultivars have

   female inflorescence may contribute to the understanding of the
   pollination biology of this endangered taxon. Inflorescence scents of
   male and female individuals were collected by dynamic headspace and
   analysed by thermal desorption-GC/MS. A total of 17 compounds of
   C5-branched chain alcohols, aliphatics, aromatics, and terpenoids were
   identified with benzyl alcohol being most abundant in both sexes. Eight
   of the compounds were sex specific and differences in
   1,2-dimethoxybenzene were most obvious. This aromatic compound was a
   main constituent in the scent of females (30\%), but it did not occur in
   males. Some of the main compounds of the scent samples are known to be
   detected by beetles (Cerambycidae) or attract sweat bees (Halictidae)

Abstract = {{Inducement to stamen movement by oligolectic bees has been reported for
   some Loasaceae species; however, detailed research studies on the
   pollination ecology of species in the genus Aosa are absent. In this
   study, we analyzed the floral biology and breeding system of Aosa
   rupestris (Hook.) Weigend, focusing on the role of pollinators in
   inducing stamens' movements. We described the anthesis, the behavior of
   floral visitors, and carried out reproductive experiments in a
   population in a dry forest ({''}caatinga'') area in Northeastern Brazil.
   Wecarried out four experiments and one control to establish whether the
   interval between the movements of two successive stamens is regulated by
   pollinator visits. Anthesis lasted for 3-4 days. Stamens (102 +/- 12.57)
   remained with closed anther inside petals early in the anthesis, after
   which they moved to the center of the flower and presented its pollen
   (male phase). After all stamens have reached the center of the flower,
   the female phase started. Bicolletes nordestina Urban, 2006 was the only
   floral visitor to A. rupestris flowers, drinking nectar, collecting
   pollen, or sleeping on the flowers. Aosa rupestris was autogamous, but
   fruit set was higher under natural conditions. The interval between
   movements of two successive stamens was not different among experiments.
   Therefore, stamen movements were spontaneous and did not respond to
   pollinator visits, in contrast to the pattern of stamen movements
   observed in other Loasaceae species. Although A. rupestris is
   autogamous, floral structure and behavior of the oligolectic bee
   pollinator ensured the highest level of fruit set in this species.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{383-394}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As a consequence of founder effects, small population size and
   demographic constraints, island populations are often characterized by
   low genetic diversity and high inbreeding. The effects of inbreeding are
   more pronounced in haplo-diploid insects like bees than in similar
   diploid species, because their method of sex determination requires
   heterozygosity at a sex locus. Inbreeding leads to homozygosity at the
   sex locus and the production of non-viable diploid males. This means
   that island populations of bees are particularly prone to extinction.
   Here we determine the levels of diversity and isolation between islands
   and mainland populations of the bumble bee Bombus morio in southeast
   Brazil. We analyzed 659 individuals from 24 populations, sequencing two
   mitochondrial genes (COI and Cytb) and genotyping all individuals at 14
   microsatellite loci. Surprisingly, genetic diversity was high and
   genetic isolation was low in all populations except Teodoro Sampaio
   (mainland) and Ilha da Vitria (island). Genetic diversity is not
   significantly correlated with island area, but is lower in populations
   that are more distant from the mainland. Except perhaps for Ilha da
   Vitria, we suggest that the island populations are unlikely to go
   extinct due to genetic factors. Finally, based on its genetic distance
   from all other populations, we identify a putative new subspecies in the
   Teodoro Sampaio region.}},

   negatively impact biodiversity. Pollinators constitute a vital component
   of grassland ecosystems, but the impact of grazing on pollinator
   diversity has seldom been evaluated in North America. We assessed
   vegetation structure, and pollinator and flowering plant abundance,
   richness, diversity, and community composition in four pairs of
   spring-grazed/ungrazed sites in south-central British Columbia, Canada.
   We also investigated whether pollinator or floral communities differed
   between the two threatened shrubsteppe habitat types we
   sampled-antelope-brush and big sagebrush shrubsteppe. Pan-trapping
   surveys captured 5907 bees, flies, beetles, wasps and butterflies
   constituting 253 species. We found that the percent cover of shrubs and
   bare soil increased with grazing, while the height of grasses and forbs
   decreased. In contrast, pollinator and flowering plant abundance,
   richness, diversity, and community composition were not significantly
   affected by grazing. Flowering plant and pollinator community
   composition did differ significantly between shrubsteppe habitats. Our
   results indicate that grasslands in North America, when managed
   responsibly, can maintain pollinator and flowering plant diversity under
   grazing pressure. The continued effort of land managers to balance
   ecological integrity and economic viability will be important for the
   conservation of grassland pollination systems.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing concern about bee decline has largely focused on honey bees
   and neonicotinoid insecticides, while native pollinators such as
   Neotropical stingless bees and agrochemicals such as other insecticide
   groups, pesticides in general, and fertilizers-especially leaf
   fertilizers-remain neglected as potential contributors to pollination
   decline. In an effort to explore this knowledge gap, we assessed the
   lethal and sublethal behavioral impact of heavy metal-containing leaf
   fertilizers in a native pollinator of ecological importance in the
   Neotropics: the stingless bee Friesella schrottkyi (Friese). Two leaf
   fertilizers-copper sulfate (24\% Cu) and a micronutrient mix (Arrank L:
   5\% S, 5\% Zn, 3\% Mn, 0.6\% Cu, 0.5\% B, and 0.06\% Mo)-were used in
   oral and contact exposure bioassays. The biopesticide spinosad and water
   were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Copper
   sulfate compromised the survival of stingless bee workers, particularly
   with oral exposure, although less than spinosad under contact exposure.
   Sublethal exposure to both leaf fertilizers at their field rates also
   caused significant effects in exposed workers. Copper sulfate enhanced
   flight take-off on stingless bee workers, unlike workers exposed to the
   micronutrient mix. There was no significant effect of leaf fertilizers
   on the overall activity and walking behavior of worker bees. No
   significant effect was observed for the respiration rate of worker bees
   under contact exposure, but workers orally exposed to the micronutrient
   mix exhibited a reduced respiration rate. Therefore, leaf fertilizers do
   affect F. schrottkyi, what may also occur with other stingless bees,
   potentially compromising their pollination activity deserving attention.}},

Abstract = {{In a modern agricultural landscape the assurance of food resources is a
   key issue in the maintaince and control of food niche for pollinators.
   In the present study we evaluated bee forage flora composition and
   diversity within railway embankments located in the agricultural
   landscape, SE Poland. We also analysed the abundance of pollinators that
   use food resources along railway embankments and recognized insect
   visitors preference for selected plant species. Railway embankments
   represent valuable refuge areas for bee forage flora (307 species, i.e.
   76.1\% of total flora) and pollinators (in total 4172 insect visits from
   9 taxonomic groups). However, the richness and abundance of bee forage
   flora significantly differed between types of the railway distinguished
   by traffic volume. The highest diversity of bee forage flora is noted
   along the railway with intermediate traffic volume. Approx. 25\% and
   40\% less bee forage species was identified along railways with low and
   high traffic volume. Likewise, bee forage flora differed considerably
   between microhabitat types, i.e. top vs. slope vs. bottom of the
   embankment. Providing support (e.g. mowing) seems to be an important
   management type in order to strengthen the native bee forage flora
   particularly on railway embankments along low and high traffic volume
   tracks. Such activity is crucial to counteract the spread of aggressive
   non-forage species (e.g. Calamagrostis epigejos, Artemisia vulgaris,
   Phragmites communis) and invasive species (e.g. Bunias orientalis,
   Solidago gigantea).}},

Abstract = {{Secondary metabolites that are present in floral nectar have been
   hypothesized to enhance specificity in plant-pollinator mutualism by
   reducing larceny by non-pollinators, including microorganisms that
   colonize nectar. However, few studies have tested this hypothesis. Using
   synthetic nectar, we conducted laboratory and field experiments to
   examine the effects of five chemical compounds found in nectar on the
   growth and metabolism of nectar-colonizing yeasts and bacteria, and the
   interactive effects of these compounds and nectar microbes on the
   consumption of nectar by pollinators. In most cases, focal compounds
   inhibited microbial growth, but the extent of these effects depended on
   compound identity, concentration, and microbial species. Moreover, most
   compounds did not substantially decrease sugar metabolism by microbes,
   and microbes reduced the concentration of some compounds in nectar.
   Using artificial flowers in the field, we also found that the common
   nectar yeast Metschnikowia reukaufii altered nectar consumption by small
   floral visitors, but only in nectar containing catalpol. This effect was
   likely mediated by a mechanism independent of catalpol metabolism.
   Despite strong compound-specific effects on microbial growth, our
   results suggest that the secondary metabolites tested here are unlikely
   to be an effective general defense mechanism for preserving nectar
   sugars for pollinators. Instead, our results indicate that microbial
   colonization of nectar could reduce the concentration of secondary
   compounds in nectar and, in some cases, reduce deterrence to
   pollinators.}},

Pages = {{1442-1451}},

Abstract = {{Plant species can influence the pollination and reproductive success of
   coflowering neighbors that share pollinators. Because some individual
   pollinators habitually forage in particular areas, it is also possible
   that plant species could influence the pollination of neighbors that
   bloom later. When flowers of a preferred forage plant decline in an
   area, site-fidelity may cause individual flower feeders to stay in an
   area and switch plant species rather than search for preferred plants in
   a new location. A newly blooming plant species may quickly inherit a set
   of visitors from a prior plant species, and therefore experience higher
   pollination success than it would in an area where the first species
   never bloomed. To test this, we manipulated the placement and timing of
   two plant species, Delphinium barbeyi and later-blooming Gentiana
   parryi. We recorded the responses of individually marked bumble bee
   pollinators. About 63\% of marked individuals returned repeatedly to the
   same areas to forage on Delphinium. When Delphinium was experimentally
   taken out of bloom, most of those site-faithful individuals (78\%)
   stayed and switched to Gentiana. Consequently, Gentiana flowers received
   more visits in areas where Delphinium had previously flowered, compared
   to areas where Delphinium was still flowering or never occurred.
   Gentiana stigmas received more pollen in areas where Delphinium
   disappeared than where it never bloomed, indicating that Delphinium
   increases the pollination of Gentiana when they are separated in time.
   Overall, we show that individual bumble bees are often site-faithful,
   causing one plant species to increase the pollination of another even
   when separated in time, which is a novel mechanism of pollination
   facilitation.}},

Abstract = {{One goal of wildflower plantings is to promote biodiversity in
   intensively managed agricultural landscapes. Flower visitors of
   wildflower plantings encompass many ecologically and economically
   important species. However, most studies on flower visitors of
   wildflower plantings have focused on single or few prominent taxa (e.g.,
   wild bees and hoverflies). In contrast, it remains largely unresolved
   how non-prominent flower visitors of the community are affected by
   wildflower resources, landscape context and time of the flowering
   season. We studied highly diverse flower-visitor communities on 14
   wildflower plantings varying in flower abundance and richness and their
   surrounding landscape context within a 500 m radius (percentage arable
   land, presence of additional wildflower plantings). Flower visitors were
   sampled in the early (May-June) and late (June-July) flowering season
   and grouped as follows: managed honeybees, wild bees, hoverflies, all
   other flower visitors. Strikingly, only 81 (25.1\%) of all 322 visiting
   species (<50.0\% of individuals) were bees or hoverflies, and 241
   non-prominent `other' visitor taxa were sampled, encompassing many
   ecologically and economically important species, e.g., parasitic wasps
   and non-syrphid Diptera. With the exception of honeybee abundance that
   was positively related to flower abundance, flower abundance and
   richness of wildflower plantings affected neither abundance nor richness
   of any visitor group. While a high amount of surrounding arable land
   decreased species richness of wild bees, richness of all other groups
   was unaffected. In contrast to the relatively weak abundance and
   richness responses at the group-level, we found strong species-specific
   responses to landscape context, resulting in substantial spatial and
   temporal turnover in community composition. In the early flowering
   season, wildflower plantings that were accompanied by additional local
   plantings and embedded within complex landscapes supported the highest
   abundances of habitat specialists (e.g. Bombus spp.), whereas isolated
   plantings were predominantly visited by agricultural generalists (e.g.
   predatory hoverflies and pollen beetles). These compositional
   differences diminished towards the end of the flowering season. Our
   study highlights the great conservation potential of wildflower
   plantings in agricultural landscapes. With the exception of wild bees,
   wildflower plantings support a high diversity of
   functionallycomplementary flower-visitor species from complex to
   structurally simple agricultural landscapes. These so-far overlooked
   flower visitors may have the potential to provide complementary
   ecosystem services and to step-in in agricultural settings where
   prominent providers have been lost. Assessments of the value of
   wildflower plantings to biodiversity conservation and agriculture
   require a shift away from solely focusing on prominent taxa and towards
   a more holistic appreciation of the entire flower-visitor community. (C)

Abstract = {{1. Fire can affect bees directly through exposure to heat and smoke.
   Direct effects include mortality, injury, and displacement affecting at
   most two generations adults and any immature progeny present during the
   fire. To study the direct effects of fire on bees, two criteria must be
   met. First, bees must be sampled soon after the fire event, before
   colonists arrive from outside the burn. Second, sampling locations must
   be far enough into the burned habitat to ensure that bees observed are
   survivors, and not foragers nesting outside the burn.
   2. Bees were systematically sampled far inside (>7 km) and outside the
   burn perimeter immediately following a massive wildfire that burned
   primarily at night in sagebrush steppe habitat. Because adult females
   sleep in their nests, it was hypothesised that females of species with
   nests >10 cm underground would be safe from lethal heat. Whereas females
   with shallow or above-ground nests would be vulnerable. It was also
   hypothesised that fire would kill proportionately more males, as they
   typically sleep above ground.
   3. Adult bees were present at all burned sample sites 14 and 21 days
   after the fire started, Many females were observed transporting pollen,
   indicative of active nest provisioning. Among the guild of bees surveyed
   at wild sunflowers (the only surviving flowering plant), fewer species
   were active within the burn. Guild composition was significantly
   altered, particularly by loss or depletion of several (but not all)
   sunflower specialists. Sex ratios did not shift, possibly due to
   surviving males aggregating in remaining patches of sunflowers.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Pollination success of animal-pollinated flowers depends on rate of
   pollinator visits and on pollen deposition per visit, both of which
   should vary with the pollen and nectar ``neighborhoods{''} of a plant,
   i.e., with pollen and nectar availability in nearby plants. One
   determinant of these neighborhoods is per-flower production of pollen
   and nectar, which is likely to respond to environmental influences. In
   this study, we explored environmental effects on pollen and nectar
   production and on pollination success in order to follow up a surprising
   result from a previous study: flowers of Ipomopsis aggregata received
   less pollen in years of high visitation by their hummingbird
   pollinators. A new analysis of the earlier data indicated that high bird
   visitation corresponded to drought years. We hypothesized that drought
   might contribute to the enigmatic prior result if it decreases both
   nectar and pollen production: in dry years, low nectar availability
   could cause hummingbirds to visit flowers at a higher rate, and low
   pollen availability could cause them to deposit less pollen per visit. A
   greenhouse experiment demonstrated that drought does reduce both pollen
   and nectar production by I. aggregata flowers. This result was
   corroborated across 6 yr of variable precipitation and soil moisture in
   four unmanipulated field populations. In addition, experimental removal
   of pollen from flowers reduced the pollen received by nearby flowers. We
   conclude that there is much to learn about how abiotic and biotic
   environmental drivers jointly affect pollen and nectar production and
   availability, and how this contributes to pollen and nectar
   neighborhoods and thus influences pollination success.}},

   elongation with the acquisition of hummingbird pollination. It is
   proposed that this increases the fit between the bird head and flower
   structures, and isolates or partially blocks bees from the interaction.
   But can this transition occur if the ancestral flower design lacks tubes
   or spurs? Here we focus on the transition from bee to hummingbird
   pollination in the Loasaceae subfamily Loasoideae. Loasoideae flowers
   have radial corollas with separated petals; therefore, they do not
   display corolla tubes nor nectar spurs. These flowers also present a
   whorl of nectar scales and staminodes, unique to the subfamily, which is
   involved in flower-pollinator fit and in nectar harvesting. To explore
   flower shape adaptation to hummingbird pollination, we tested for
   correspondence between pollinators and flower shape in Loasoideae. In
   order to achieve this, we first compared the evolutionary history of
   flower phenotype and pollination mode, and then used stochastic
   character mapping and geometric-morphometric variables in a comparison
   of alternative evolutionary models. The results of our study suggest
   that the transition from bee to bird pollination was accompanied by
   changes in the shape of the staminodial complex, along with the
   evolution of relatively closed corollas. Moreover, while bird
   pollination seems to be the end point in the evolution of pollination
   syndromes in many angiosperm lineages, rodent pollinated flowers
   probably evolved from ancestral bird pollinated flowers in Loasoideae.
   Our findings suggest that the evolution of bird pollinated flowers from
   ancestral bee pollinated flowers does not require the presence of
   corolla tubes or spurs, and can take place as long as the flower design
   includes structures participating in flower-pollinator fit.}},

Abstract = {{Male marking pheromones (MPs) are used by the majority of bumblebee
   species (Hymenoptera: Apidae), including a commercially important
   greenhouse pollinator, the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), to
   attract conspecific females. MP biosynthetic processes in the cephalic
   part of the bumblebee male labial gland (LG) are of extraordinary
   complexity, involving enzymes of fatty acid and isoprenoid biosynthesis,
   which jointly produce more than 50 compounds. We employed a differential
   transcriptomic approach to identify candidate genes involved in MP
   biosynthesis by sequencing Bombus terrestris LG and fat body (FB)
   transcriptomes. We identified 12 454 abundantly expressed gene products
   (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads value > 1)
   that had significant hits in the GenBank nonredundant database. Of
   these, 876 were upregulated in the LG (> 4-fold difference). We
   identified more than 140 candidate genes potentially involved in MP
   biosynthesis, including esterases, fatty acid reductases, lipases,
   enzymes involved in limited fatty acid chain shortening, neuropeptide
   receptors and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of triacylglycerols,
   isoprenoids and fatty acids. For selected candidates, we confirmed their
   abundant expression in LG using quantitative real-time reverse
   transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Our study shows that the Bombus terrestris
   LG transcriptome reflects both fatty acid and isoprenoid MP biosynthetic
   processes and identifies rational gene targets for future studies to
   disentangle the molecular basis of MP biosynthesis. Additionally, LG and
   FB transcriptomes enrich the available transcriptomic resources for
   Bombus terrestris.}},

Abstract = {{1. Grassland for livestock production is a major form of land use
   throughout Europe and its intensive management threatens biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning in agricultural landscapes. Modest increases
   to conventional grassland biodiversity could have considerable positive
   impacts on the provision of ecosystem services, such as pollination, to
   surrounding habitats.
   2. Using a field-scale experiment in which grassland seed mixes and
   sward management were manipulated, complemented by surveys on working
   farms and phytometer experiments, the impact of conventional grassland
   diversity and management on the functional diversity and ecosystem
   service provision of pollinator communities were investigated.
   3. Increasing plant richness, by the addition of both legumes and forbs,
   was associated with significant enhancements in the functional diversity
   of grassland pollinator communities. This was associated with increased
   temporal stability of flower-visitor interactions at the community
   level. Visitation networks revealed pasture species Taraxacum sp.
   (Wigg.) (dandelion) and Cirsium arvense (Scop.) (creeping thistle) to
   have the highest pollinator visitation frequency and richness. Cichorium
   intybus (L.) (chichory) was highlighted as an important species having
   both high pollinator visitation and desirable agronomic properties.
   4. Increased sward richness was associated with an increase in the
   pollination of two phytometer species; Fragaria 9 ananassa (strawberry)
   and Silene dioica (red campion), but not Vicia faba (broad bean).
   Enhanced functional diversity, richness and abundance of the pollinator
   communities associated with more diverse neighbouring pastures were
   found to be potential mechanisms for improved pollination.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A modest increase in conventional
   grassland plant diversity with legumes and forbs, achievable with the
   expertise and resources available to most grassland farmers, could
   enhance pollinator functional diversity, richness and abundance.
   Moreover, our results suggest that this could improve pollination
   services and consequently surrounding crop yields (e.g. strawberry) and
   wildflower reproduction in agro-ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (F.), is the primary
   pollinator for alfalfa seed production in North America. Under current
   management practice, developing pupae are incubated at 29-30 degrees C
   until the adults emerge for pollination. If unfavorable spring weather
   delays peak alfalfa bloom, managers will cool pupae to slow development,
   which can increase mortality and causes sublethal effects. Previously,
   we demonstrated that exposure to a fluctuating thermal regime (FTR)
   increases survival and extends the viable storage period. To determine
   the optimal conditions for FTR during storage of developing M.
   rotundata, we examined four variables: temperature of the daily warm
   pulse, duration of the warm pulse, number of weeks exposed to the FTR
   treatment, and developmental stage of the bee. Survival was measured by
   successful eclosion to the adult stage. Under all conditions, exposure
   to FTR increased survival compared with exposure to a constant 6 degrees
   C. When the temperature of the daily warm pulse was 20-25 degrees C from
   a base temperature of 6 degrees C, and the pulse duration was extended
   to 3 h, survival rates were as high as those observed under standard
   storage conditions (29 degrees C). Under this FTR storage protocol, bee
   managers can delay emergence for similar to 8 wk without significant
   decreases in survival. Our findings have substantial economic
   implications for bee management and alfalfa seed production by
   increasing the flexibility and efficiency of M. rotundata adult
   emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Petunia hybrida is a popular bedding plant that has a long history as a

   of inbred derivatives of its two wild parents, P. axillaris N and P.

   diploid genomes (1.4 Gb; 2n = 14) containing 32,928 and 36,697

   lineage has experienced at least two rounds of hexaploidization: the
   older gamma event, which is shared with most Eudicots, and a more recent
   Solanaceae event that is shared with tomato and other solanaceous
   species. Transcription factors involved in the shift from bee to moth
   pollination reside in particularly dynamic regions of the genome, which
   may have been key to the remarkable diversity of floral colour patterns

Abstract = {{Native bee community diversity is known to vary temporally in the
   Neotropics, but little research has been done to quantify the extent of
   this variation. We studied monthly variation in native bee diversity in
   tropical semi-deciduous forest on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, over a
   twelve-month period in 2007. Hurricane Dean traversed the study area in
   August of that year, causing some changes in the environment and in the
   native bee community. A total of 2,335 individual bee specimens were
   collected, belonging to 102 species from four families. The family
   Apidae had the highest number of species (46\%) and individuals (71\%).
   Species richness, abundance, and diversity varied throughout the study
   period. Species proportions of lifestyles and nesting behaviors varied
   from month to month, and absolute numbers changed. Low to moderate
   similarity values indicated high monthly species turnover, with almost
   half of species present for only one to two months. Species richness
   declined after the hurricane, with a loss of 40\% of the species present
   beforehand, but nine new species appeared in September. The hurricane
   also reduced the number of solitary, parasocial, and social species,
   mostly those nesting in preexisting cavities and wood. Species
   composition in August had similarity values nearer to those of months in
   the dry season than to those in the rainy season. Two months after the
   hurricane, the native bee community had returned to previous species
   diversity levels, probably due to the rapid recovery of the vegetation
   on which the bee community depends. Effective biodiversity conservation
   programs will need more data on changes in vegetation community
   structure and how such changes influence Neotropical native bee
   communities after natural disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of bees is a major concern due to their vital role in
   pollinating many crops and wild plants. Some regions in South America,
   and especially the Pampas, are amongst those parts of the world where
   stressors of bee populations have been little studied. The Pampas has
   been intensively transformed for agriculture, being presently one of the
   most productive areas of agricultural commodities in the world. Here, we
   aim to provide first insights on the taxonomic and functional
   composition of bee assemblages in the Rolling Pampa, the most
   intensively managed part of the Pampas. Soybean (herbicide-tolerant
   genetically modified varieties) is the predominant crop in this region.
   Bees were sampled with coloured pan traps. Sampling points were located
   on field margins in either the cropped or the semi-natural grassland
   area of a farmland site devoted to annual cropping. A total of 2384
   individuals were caught, representing 33 taxa {[}mainly
   (morpho)species]. The subgenus Lasioglossum (Dialictus) largely
   dominated captures (78\% of the total abundance) and was relatively
   abundant in the entire study area, suggesting that some species are
   likely to reach their ecological requirements in cropped areas. No-till
   fields and field margins may provide large areas for these below-ground
   nesting species, while their polylectic food preferences allow them to
   collect pollen on a wide range of plant species, among them possibly
   soybean. On the contrary, the richness and the abundance of other taxa
   were higher in the semi-natural area than in the cropped area. Among
   them, above-ground nesting or oil-collecting species, which have more
   specialised nesting and floral requirements, were highly associated with
   the semi-natural area. Our findings highlight the large dominance of L.
   (Dialictus) species in this highly intensively managed landscape, and
   the urgent need of preserving semi-natural habitats to maintain
   species-rich and functionally diverse bee communities in the Pampas.}},

Abstract = {{The coloration of flowers is due to thewavelength-selective absorption
   by pigments of light backscattered by structures inside the petals. We
   investigated the optical properties of flowers using (micro)
   spectrophotometry and anatomical methods. To assess the contribution of
   different structures to the overall visual signal of flowers, we used an
   optical model, where a petal is considered as a stack of differently
   pigmented and structured layers and we interpreted the visual signals of
   the model petals with insect vision models. We show that the reflectance
   depends, in addition to the pigmentation, on the petal's thickness and
   the inhomogeneity of its interior. We find large between-species
   differences in floral pigments, pigment concentration and localization,
   as well as floral interior structure. The fractions of reflected and
   transmitted light are remarkably similar between the studied species,
   suggesting common selective pressures of pollinator visual systems. Our
   optical model highlights that pigment localization crucially determines
   the efficiency of pigmentary filtering and thereby the chromatic
   contrast and saturation of the visual signal. The strongest visual
   signal occurs with deposition of pigments only on the side of viewing.
   Our systematic approach and optical modelling open new perspectives on
   the virtues of flower colour.}},

Title = {{Apple Pollination: Demand Depends on Variety and Supply Depends on
   Pollinator Identity}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollination underpins apple production but the extent to which
   different pollinator guilds supply this service, particularly across
   different apple varieties, is unknown. Such information is essential if
   appropriate orchard management practices are to be targeted and
   proportional to the potential benefits pollinator species may provide.
   Here we use a novel combination of pollinator effectiveness assays
   (floral visit effectiveness), orchard field surveys (flower visitation
   rate) and pollinator dependence manipulations (pollinator exclusion
   experiments) to quantify the supply of pollination services provided by
   four different pollinator guilds to the production of four commercial
   varieties of apple. We show that not all pollinators are equally
   effective at pollinating apples, with hoverflies being less effective
   than solitary bees and bumblebees, and the relative abundance of
   different pollinator guilds visiting apple flowers of different
   varieties varies significantly. Based on this, the taxa specific
   economic benefits to UK apple production have been established. The
   contribution of insect pollinators to the economic output in all
   varieties was estimated to be 92.1M pound across the UK, with
   contributions varying widely across taxa: solitary bees (51.4M) pound,
   honeybees (21.4M) pound, bumblebees (18.6M) pound and hoverflies (0.7M)
   pound. This research highlights the differences in the economic benefits
   of four insect pollinator guilds to four major apple varieties in the
   UK. This information is essential to underpin appropriate investment in
   pollination services management and provides a model that can be used in
   other entomolophilous crops to improve our understanding of crop
   pollination ecology.}},

Abstract = {{The astonishing diversity of floral form in angiosperm plants is driven
   in large part by preferences of pollinators for various floral traits,
   including learned preferences. Remarkably, almost all of a vast
   literature on learning and memory in pollinators relates to nectar as a
   reward, even though bees and many flies, beetles, and butterflies must
   collect pollen. In this study, we asked if bees formed preferences for
   plant species from which pollen had been collected successfully. Using
   absolute conditioning, we gave pollen foraging bees experience with
   plant species that offered only pollen rewards. Naive bees generally
   showed modest preferences, whereas experienced bees adopted strong
   preferences for those species over alternative species not previously
   experienced. Learned preferences were retained for at least 24 h,
   consistent with preferences learned with nectar rewards. These
   experience-mediated changes in preference raised the possibility that
   bees formed associations between particular floral features and pollen
   rewards. We therefore asked if learned preferences required that bees
   successfully collect pollen. Using differential conditioning, we
   determined that learned preferences were strongly influenced by receipt
   of a pollen reward. In a final experiment, we characterized the
   importance of 2 floral features, the corolla and the anther, in the
   expression of learned preferences. Although experience altered responses
   to both floral parts, responses to anthers were influenced more
   strongly. We discuss recent evidence in the literature for associative
   learning with pollen rewards and propose that learned preferences in the
   context of pollen collection have played an important role in floral
   display evolution.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{How foragers cope with complexity in both needs and resources is a major
   question in behavioral ecology. When faced with nutritionally diverse
   resources, or when foraging for offspring with divergent nutritional
   needs, animals must meet the challenge of how to structure their
   foraging bouts, including what resources to forage for and in what order
   (how) to collect them. We investigated how nutritional variation in
   resources and requirements shapes the structure of bumble bee foraging
   bouts. Bumble bee workers collect 2 nutritionally distinct resources for
   consumers with different nutritional needs, floral nectar (largely
   carbohydrates) for their own needs and that of larvae, and pollen
   (largely protein) that is used primarily by larvae. We maintained
   colonies of the Eastern Bumble Bee (Bombus impatiens) in the laboratory
   on either protein-rich or protein-limited diets and assessed bees'
   foraging bout structure on artificial flowers that offered low, medium,
   or high ratios of pollen to nectar. We analyzed bout structure using
   both traditional floral constancy metrics as well as hierarchical
   Bayesian analyses. Bees from pollen-satiated colonies responded to
   variation in floral pollen: nectar ratios, tending to collect pollen
   consecutively when nectar volumes were high. In contrast, foragers from
   pollen-limited colonies were relatively insensitive to floral reward
   ratio, tending to collect pollen in long runs regardless of nectar
   volume. We discuss the implications of these findings for the
   pollination services that bees provide plants.}},

Abstract = {{Gradual warming and changes in extreme weather patterns associated with
   human induced climate change are altering the range distributions of
   species. However, species responses to climate change are predicted to
   be more strongly affected by extreme events than by changes in mean
   values. As a result, measuring species' responses to extreme events in
   addition to the mean changes in climate are necessary to predict species
   range limits under future conditions. This study examines the impacts of
   a cold spell in southern Florida on native and an introduced
   oil-collecting bees by examining the bees' interactions with two native
   plants species. Our results provide evidence of differential impacts
   from an extreme cold event on a native, subtropical bee vs. an
   introduced, tropical bee. Specifically, the cold spell had little impact
   on the abundance of the native bee, while the abundance of the
   introduced, tropical bee was negatively impacted. Our findings
   demonstrate that extreme cold spells are important climate
   change-related phenomena that can have strong impacts on tropical
   species distributions and abundances, especially at the threshold of
   their thermal tolerances. Our approach also provided a rare opportunity
   to examine these impacts on multiple interacting species, which provides
   a more realistic assessment of the potential impacts of climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Recent efforts to evaluate the contribution of neonicotinoid

Abstract = {{The interplay between insect and plant traits outlines the patterns of

   studied the factors that affect the pollination efficiency of a
   pollinator community of Dictamnus albus L. by evaluating insect
   behaviour and morphological characteristics in relation to flowering
   phenology. In order to extrapolate the pollinator importance of single
   taxa and of the whole pollinator guild, we calculated an index
   distinguishing between potential (PPI) and realized (RPI) pollinator
   importance. Although the pollinator species spectrum appeared rather
   constant, we found high intra- and inter-annual variability of
   pollinator frequency and importance within the insect community. Flower
   visitation rate strictly depended on insect abundance and on the overlap
   between their flying period and flower blooming. All the pollinators
   visited flowers from the bottom to the top of the racemes, excluding
   intra-plant geitonogamous pollination, and most of them showed high
   pollen fidelity. Only medium large-sized bees could contact the upward
   bending stiles while feeding on nectar, highlighting a specialisation of
   the plant towards bigger pollinators. Moreover, we found evidence of
   functional specialisation, since all pollinators were restricted to a
   single taxonomic group (order: Hymenoptera; superfamily: Apoidea). Both
   the PPI and RPI indices indicate Habropoda tarsata as the most important
   pollinator of D.albus. Following hand cross-pollination experiments we
   revealed the presence of pollination limitation in 1 of the 3years of

Abstract = {{1. Many non-rewarding orchid species mimic the signals of co-occurring
   food flowers and thereby attract food-seeking animal pollinators. These
   signals are often visually complex with a colour pattern that contrasts
   between outer and central parts. The significance of this colour
   complexity for the pollination success of flowers of deceptive orchids
   has scarcely been investigated.
   2. We tested the effects of the colour patterns of the food-deceptive
   orchid Paphiopedilum micranthum on bumblebee visitation choices and
   pollination success using behavioural experiments in a community
   context. Using comparative phylogenetic analysis and a bee vision model,
   we also compared the colour patterns of P. micranthum with those of its
   congeners and sympatric food flowers.
   3. The probability of both long-range approach and close-up choice by
   bumblebees to orchids was all enhanced in communities with food flowers
   similar in colour pattern to the orchid. Probability of long-range
   approach and close-up choice was negatively correlated with colour
   distance between orchid and food flowers in floral outer and centre,
   respectively. Flowers of P. micranthum that were manipulated to reduce
   visual complexity had reduced male and female pollination success.
   4. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the outer floral colour of P.
   micranthum is apomorphic and thus likely represents an evolutionary
   innovation, whereas the central colour is plesiomorphic and thus likely
   to function in the bumblebee pollination system as an exaptation. The
   contrast between the inner and outer colours appears to exploit visual
   preferences of bumblebees acquired during foraging on local food plants
   with similar colour patterns.
   5. This study highlights the adaptive significance of colour patterns in
   successful food deception and the importance of complex signals in
   facilitating interspecific interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator populations respond to environmental changes operating on
   different spatial scales, but the contribution of scale-dependent
   habitat management to crop pollination and yield-gap reduction is little
   understood. Here, we analyze how bee abundance and their effects on
   cucumber production in tropical homegardens is driven by factors
   measured on three spatial scales; the (1) homegarden scale (flower cover
   of the focal homegarden); the (2) adjacent-habitat scale (amount of
   homegarden habitat within a 200 m radius around the focal homegarden);
   and the (3) landscape scale (distance of the focal homegarden to the
   nearest forest from 0 to 2200 m). We also evaluate bee responses
   according to functional traits such as body size.
   We found that bees were affected by factors on multiple spatial scales.
   On the homegarden scale, the percentage flower cover best predicted
   pollinator attraction, if, on the adjacent-habitat scale the percentage
   of surrounding homegardens was at least 20\%. On the landscape scale,
   bee abundance, mainly of small species, increased when homegardens were
   closer to the forest.
   Increasing abundance of flower-visiting bees increased cucumber yield,
   with solitary bees being the most abundant flower visitors. We predicted
   that a 50\% loss in bee abundance would translate into a 47\% yield and
   associated income decline. Homegardens with a flower cover of 50\%,
   being surrounded by a homegarden area of 50\% and being established <100
   m from the forest can translate in a nine-fold higher yield and income
   compared to homegardens with low flower cover (<15\%), and isolated from
   other homegardens (<20\%) and the forest (>1500 m).
   Our work suggests that farmers need to be aware of management practices
   not only at the local and landscape scale but also on the
   adjacent-habitat scale. Only then farmers can increase wild bee
   populations to reduce crop yield gaps through pollination services. (C)

Title = {{Flower colour and visitation rates of Costus arabicus support the `bee
   avoidance' hypothesis for red-reflecting hummingbird-pollinated flowers}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Floral colour mediates plant-pollinator interactions by often
   signalling floral resources. In this sense, hummingbird-pollinated
   flowers are frequently red-coloured, and there are two tentative
   hypotheses to explain this pattern: 1. hummingbirds are attracted to red
   due its easier detection and 2. bees are sensorially excluded from red
   flowers. The second hypothesis is based on bees' red colour blindness,
   which lead them to be less frequent and less important than hummingbirds
   as pollinators of red-reflecting flowers.
   2. Here, we untangled the role of different flower traits mediating
   plant-pollinator interactions and empirically tested the above
   hypotheses. We chose Costus arabicus due to its synchronopatric white-
   and pink-flowered individuals and its bee and hummingbird pollination
   system. Although pink flowers are not totally achromatic as pure red
   ones, they show an achromaticity degree that could drive bee exclusion.
   Specifically, we tested whether differences on red reflectance work
   attracting hummingbirds or excluding bees and the consequent
   implications for the plant's reproduction.
   3. Flower colour morphs of C. arabicus do differ neither in morphology
   nor in nectar sugar content. Moreover, white and pink flowers can be
   discriminated by the bees' and hummingbirds' colour vision system. Both
   groups are able to discriminate the red colour variation morph on the
   flower petals, the white flowers being more easily detected by bees and
   the pink flowers by hummingbirds. Bees preferentially visited the white
   flowers, whereas hummingbirds visited both colours at the same rate -
   both patterns corroborating the second hypothesis.
   4. Pollen loads deposited on stigmas did not differ between flower
   colour morphs, indicating that bees and hummingbirds play a similar role
   in the overall pollen deposition. However, bees are more likely to
   self-pollinate than hummingbirds. Self-pollination limits C. arabicus
   reproduction, and red-reflecting flowers may be better pollinated by
   discouraging bee visitation. Therefore, the intraspecific colour
   variation is driving flowers to show colour-related different levels of
   generalization.
   5. Our results support the `bee avoidance' rather than the `hummingbird
   preference' hypothesis. Sensory exclusion of bees seems to be the
   pressure for red-reflecting flowers evolution, driving specialization in
   hummingbird-pollinated flowers due to the costs of bee pollination on
   plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Fire has a major impact on the structure and function of many ecosystems
   globally. Pyrodiversity, the diversity of fires within a region (where
   diversity is based on fire characteristics such as extent, severity, and
   frequency), has been hypothesized to promote biodiversity, but changing
   climate and land management practices have eroded pyrodiversity. To
   assess whether changes in pyrodiversity will have impacts on ecological
   communities, we must first understand the mechanisms that might enable
   pyrodiversity to sustain biodiversity, and how such changes might
   interact with other disturbances such as drought. Focusing on
   plant-pollinator communities in mixed-conifer forest with frequent fire
   in Yosemite National Park, California, we examine how pyrodiversity,
   combined with drought intensity, influences those communities. We find
   that pyrodiversity is positively related to the richness of the
   pollinators, flowering plants, and plant-pollinator interactions. On
   average, a 5\% increase in pyrodiversity led to the gain of
   approximately one pollinator and one flowering plant species and nearly
   two interactions. We also find that a diversity of fire characteristics
   contributes to the spatial heterogeneity (-diversity) of plant and
   pollinator communities. Lastly, we find evidence that fire diversity
   buffers pollinator communities against the effects of drought-induced
   floral resource scarcity. Fire diversity is thus important for the
   maintenance of flowering plant and pollinator diversity and predicted
   shifts in fire regimes to include less pyrodiversity compounded with
   increasing drought occurrence will negatively influence the richness of
   these communities in this and other forested ecosystems. In addition,
   lower heterogeneity of fire severity may act to reduce spatial turnover
   of plant-pollinator communities. The heterogeneity of community
   composition is a primary determinant of the total species diversity
   present in a landscape, and thus, lower pyrodiversity may negatively
   affect the richness of plant-pollinator communities across large spatial
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important pollinators, and
   the value of bumblebees for crop pollination has led to the commercial
   production and exportation/importation of colonies on a global scale.
   Commercially produced bumblebee colonies can carry with them infectious
   parasites, which can both reduce the health of the colonies and
   spillover to wild bees, with potentially serious consequences. The
   presence of parasites in commercially produced bumblebee colonies is in
   part because colonies are reared on pollen collected from honey bees,
   which often contains a diversity of microbial parasites. In response to
   this threat, part of the industry has started to irradiate pollen used
   for bumblebee rearing. However, to date there is limited data published
   on the efficacy of this treatment. Here we examine the effect of gamma
   irradiation and an experimental ozone treatment on the presence and
   viability of parasites in honey bee pollen. While untreated pollen
   contained numerous viable parasites, we find that gamma irradiation
   reduced the viability of parasites in pollen, but did not eliminate
   parasites entirely. Ozone treatment appeared to be less effective than
   gamma irradiation, while an artificial pollen substitute was, as
   expected, entirely free of parasites. The results suggest that the
   irradiation of pollen before using it to rear bumblebee colonies is a
   sensible method which will help reduce the incidence of parasite
   infections in commercially produced bumblebee colonies, but that further
   optimisation, or the use of a nutritionally equivalent artificial pollen
   substitute, may be needed to fully eliminate this route of disease entry
   into factories. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects obtain gut microbes from their diet, but how a mother's
   foraging patterns influence the microbes found in her offspring's food
   remains an open question. To address this gap, we studied a bee that
   forages for pollen from multiple species of plants and may therefore
   acquire diverse bacteria from different plants. We tested the hypothesis
   that pollen diversity correlates with bacterial diversity by
   simultaneously characterizing these two communities in bee brood
   provisions for the first time. We used deep sequencing of the plant RBCL
   gene and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to characterize pollen and
   bacterial diversity. We then tested for associations between pollen and
   bacterial species richness and community composition, as well as
   co-occurrence of specific bacteria and pollen types. We found that both
   pollen and bacterial communities were extremely diverse, indicating that
   mother bees visit a wide variety of flowers for pollen and nectar and
   subsequently bring a diversity of microbes back into their nests. Pollen
   and bacterial species richness and community composition, however, were
   not correlated. Certain pollen types significantly co-occurred with the
   most proportionally abundant bacteria, indicating that the plants these
   pollen types came from may serve as reservoirs for these bacteria. Even
   so, the overall diversity of these communities appears to mask these
   associations at a broader scale. Further study of these pollen and
   bacteria associations will be important for understanding the
   complicated relationship between bacteria and wild bees.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cost efficient foraging is of especial importance for animals like
   hawkmoths or hummingbirds that are feeding `on the wing', making their
   foraging energetically demanding. The economic decisions made by these
   animals have a strong influence on the plants they pollinate and floral
   volatiles are often guiding these decisions. Here we show that the
   hawkmoth Manduca sexta exhibits an innate preference for volatiles of
   those Nicotiana flowers, which match the length of the moth's proboscis.
   This preference becomes apparent already at the initial inflight
   encounter, with the odour plume. Free-flight respiration analyses
   combined with nectar calorimetry revealed a significant caloric gain per
   invested flight energy only for preferred-matching-flowers. Our data
   therefore support Darwin's initial hypothesis on the coevolution of
   flower length and moth proboscis. We demonstrate that this interaction
   is mediated by an adaptive and hardwired olfactory preference of the
   moth for flowers offering the highest net-energy reward.}},

Abstract = {{Many Velloziaceae flowers present conspicuous glands, whose taxonomic
   value has already been highlighted. However, until now, their
   micromorphology, anatomy and ultrastructure have not been investigated,
   nor have the natures and possible functions of their exudates. Our aim
   was to investigate distribution, ontogenesis, structure, and secretion
   mechanisms of glands of Barbacenia flava and Vellozia intermedia and to
   discuss their possible ecological functions. Samples were prepared
   according to standard methods for investigations of plant anatomy,
   scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
   Histochemical tests were performed, and focal field observations were
   made in the study site. The capitate stalked glands on the pedicel,
   tepals and hypanthium are covered by a sticky secretion that is released
   in the gland head through the outer periclinal cell walls and cuticle.
   Secretions are produced in the epidermal and subepidermal cells that
   contain structural components typical of mixed, mainly lipophilic
   secretions. Bacteria were found inside the oil-resin gland cells of both
   species. The Meliponina bees Trigona spinipes and Tetragonisca angustula
   were observed collecting resin from both species, but were not involved
   in pollination. Our observations clearly indicate that flower glands of
   B. flava and V. intermedia are oil-resin secreting and remain active in
   secretion from very young buds, through to immature fruit. New, smaller
   glands replace senescent glands by divisions near the base of the
   original stalk cells. Oil-resin glands have a number of different, but
   important functions, including the interaction with Meliponina bees,
   protection against water loss and high temperatures by ultraviolet
   screening, and anti-desiccant properties.}},

   Crocus species}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Most flowers display distinct colour patterns comprising two different
   areas. The peripheral large-area component of floral colour patterns
   attracts flower visitors from some distance and the central small-area
   component guides flower visitors towards landing sites. Whereas the
   peripheral colour is largely variable among species, the central colour,
   produced mostly by anthers and pollen or pollen mimicking floral guides,
   is predominantly yellow and UV-absorbing. This holds also for yellow
   flowers that regularly display a UV bull's eye pattern. Here we show
   that yellow-flowering Crocus species are a noticeable exception, since
   yellow-flowering Crocus species-being entirely UV-absorbing-exhibit low
   colour contrast between yellow reproductive organs and yellow tepals.
   The elongated yellow or orange-yellow style of Crocus flowers is a
   stamen-mimicking structure promoting cross-pollination by facilitating
   flower visitors' contact with the apical stigma before the flower
   visitors are touching the anthers. Since Crocus species possess either
   yellow, violet or white tepals, the colour contrast between the
   stamen-mimicking style and the tepals varies among species. In this
   study comprising 106 Crocus species, it was tested whether the style
   length of Crocus flowers is dependent on the corolla colour. The results
   show that members of the genus Crocus with yellow tepals have evolved
   independently up to twelve times in the genus Crocus and that
   yellow-flowering Crocus species possess shorter styles as compared to
   violet- and white-flowering ones. The manipulation of flower visitors by
   anther-mimicking elongated styles in Crocus flowers is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing concern over the risk to bee populations from
   neonicotinoid insecticides and the long-term consequences of reduced
   numbers of insect pollinators to essential ecosystem services and food
   security. Our knowledge of the risk of neonicotinoids to bees is based
   on studies of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam and these findings are
   extrapolated to clothianidin based on its higher potency at nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors. This study addresses the specificity and
   consequences of all three neonicotinoids to determine their relative
   risk to bumblebees at field-relevant levels (2.5 ppb). We find
   compound-specific effects at all levels (individual cells, bees and
   whole colonies in semi-field conditions). Imidacloprid and clothianidin
   display distinct, overlapping, abilities to stimulate Kenyon cells,
   indicating the potential to differentially influence bumblebee behavior.
   Bee immobility was induced only by imidacloprid, and an increased
   vulnerability to clothianidin toxicity only occurred following chronic
   exposure to clothianidin or thiamethoxam. At the whole colony level,
   only thiamethoxam altered the sex ratio (more males present) and only
   clothianidin increased queen production. Finally, both imidacloprid and
   thiamethoxam caused deficits in colony strength, while no detrimental
   effects of clothianidin were observed. Given these findings,
   neonicotinoid risk needs to be considered independently for each
   compound and target species.}},

   evidence of an exotic N. bombi origin based on genetic analysis of
   global Nosema populations; the widespread Nosema strain found currently

Abstract = {{Changes in climate and land use can have important impacts on
   biodiversity. Species respond to such environmental modifications by
   adapting to new conditions or by shifting their geographic distributions
   towards more suitable areas. The latter might be constrained by species'
   functional traits that influence their ability to move, reproduce or
   establish. Here, we show that functional traits related to dispersal,
   reproduction, habitat use and diet have influenced how three pollinator
   groups (bees, butterflies and hoverflies) responded to changes in
   climate and land-use in the Netherlands since 1950. Across the three
   pollinator groups, we found pronounced areal range expansions (>53\%)
   and modelled range shifts towards the north (all taxa: 17-22 km), west
   (bees: 14 km) and east (butterflies: 11 km). The importance of specific
   functional traits for explaining distributional changes varied among
   pollinator groups. Larval diet preferences (i.e. carnivorous vs.
   herbivorous/detritivorous and nitrogen values of host plants,
   respectively) were important for hoverflies and butterflies, adult body
   size for hoverflies, and flight period length for all groups. Moreover,
   interactions among multiple traits were important to explain species'
   geographic range shifts, suggesting that taxon-specific multi-trait
   analyses are needed to predict how global change will affect

   highest pressure whereas the trigger application hardly affects operator
   and environmental exposure. The ordinary non-professional user generates
   most pressure on aquatic organisms. Pressure of non-professional
   pesticides on bees is mainly caused by the use of insecticides,
   especially the active substance imidacloprid in combination with the
   aerosol spray can application method applied by an intensive operator.
   In general, both total usage (kg) and pressure of pesticides decreased
   for the period 2005 to 2012 due to efforts made by the government and
   industry. The results of this study suggest to pay special attention to
   aerosol spray applications and the non-professional use of insecticides.

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Floral colour change is visual signals for pollinators to avoid old
   flowers and increase pollination efficiency. Quisqualis indica flowers
   change colour from white to pink to red may be associated with a shift
   from moth to butterfly pollination. To test this hypothesis, we
   investigated Q. indica populations in Southwest China. Flowers secreted
   nectar continuously from the evening of anthesis until the following
   morning, then decreased gradually with floral colour change. The scent
   compounds in the three floral colour stages were similar; however, the
   scent composition was different, and the scent emission rate decreased
   from the white to red stage. Dichogamy in Q. indica prevents
   self-pollination and interference of male and female functions.
   Controlled pollinations demonstrated that this species is
   self-incompatible and needs pollinators for seed production. Different
   pollinators were attracted in each floral colour stage; mainly moths at
   night and bees and butterflies during the day. Observations of
   open-pollinated inflorescences showed that white flowers had a higher
   fruit set than pink or red flowers, indicating the high contribution of
   moths to reproductive success. We concluded that the nectar and scent
   secretion are related to floral colour change in Q. indica, in order to
   attract different pollinators and promote reproductive fitness.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{As key pollinators, honey bees are crucial to many natural and
   agricultural ecosystems. An important factor in the health of honey bees
   is the availability of diverse floral resources. However, inmany parts
   of the world, high-intensity agriculture could result in a reduction in
   honey bee forage. Previous studies have investigated how the landscape
   surrounding honey bee hives affects some aspects of honey bee health,
   but to our knowledge there have been no investigations of the effects of
   intensively cultivated landscapes on indicators of individual bee health
   such as nutritional physiology and pathogen loads. Furthermore,
   agricultural landscapes in different regions vary greatly in forage and
   land management, indicating a need for additional information on the
   relationship between honey bee health and landscape cultivation. Here,
   we add to this growing body of information by investigating differences
   in nutritional physiology between honey bees kept in areas of
   comparatively low and high cultivation in an area generally high
   agricultural intensity in the Midwestern United States. We focused on
   bees collected directly before winter, because overwintering stress
   poses one of the most serious problems for honey bees in temperate
   climates. We found that honey bees kept in areas of lower cultivation
   exhibited higher lipid levels than those kept in areas of high
   cultivation, but this effect was observed only in colonies that were
   free of Varroa mites. Furthermore, we found that the presence of mites
   was associated with lower lipid levels and higher titers of deformed
   wing virus (DWV), as well as a non-significant trend towards higher
   overwinter losses. Overall, these results show that mite infestation
   interacts with landscape, obscuring the effects of landscape alone and
   suggesting that the benefits of improved foraging landscape could be
   lost without adequate control of mite infestations.}},

Abstract = {{In North America, brood parasitic bees of the genus Coelioxys attack
   nests of solitary nest-provisioning bees of the genus Megachile. Using
   trap-nests in central New York State, we found Coelioxys modesta (Smith)
   in 49\% of 72 nests and 27\% of 313 cells provisioned by Megachile
   campanulae (Robertson). Because we had a nearly complete record of the
   species and sex of individuals developing in nest cells, we were able to
   use logistic regression to test several hypotheses concerning the risk
   of brood parasitism, the spatial distribution of infested cells, and the
   sex and size of C. modesta at different cell positions. The
   probabilities that a nest was infested or contained multiple C. modesta
   were higher in nests of larger diameter and in those had been active for
   longer durations. Cells of the host and cells infested with C. modesta
   tended to cluster with those of conspecifics within nests, an
   observation consistent with the hypothesis that individual female C.
   modesta remain at or frequently revisit individual host nests in which
   they have already oviposited. One nest contained a string of six
   consecutive cells attacked by C. modesta. As is typical of
   cavity-nesting Megachile, M. campanulae female offspring tended to
   predominate in inner cells of nests. Because the risk of attack by C.
   modesta was unrelated to cell position, however, M. campanulae offspring
   sex ratio did not differ between infested and uninfested nests. Brood
   parasites within inner nest cells were more likely to be Females. Males
   in inner cells tended to be above average in body size, probably as a
   result of inner cells containing larger pollen masses. A review of
   studies of Coelioxys brood parasitism of Megachile revealed that the
   percent of M. campanulae nests infested in our study is one of the
   highest published values.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat management within agroecosystems can conserve wild pollinator
   communities by providing nesting and floral resources. However,
   demarcating arable land for conservation may reduce farm income. A
   conciliatory habitat management plan thus consists of planting
   harvestable commodities which offer pollinator resources. This study's
   goal was to determine whether a single species annual flowering crop
   could support an abundant and diverse wild pollinator community despite
   its own uniformity. Local bee communities were sampled using pan traps
   and hand collection within sixty 10 m(2) plots of a sunflower,
   Helianthus annuus L., field and thirty 10 m(2) plots within a meadow
   three times throughout August, 2012. In total, 2316 bees were collected
   with Bombus impatiens Cresson constituting 81.5\% of sampled bees.
   Examined collectively, hand collections yielded significantly higher bee
   abundances in the sunflower field (P < 0.01) across every sampling date.
   Conversely, an equivalent number of pan-trapped bees occurred among
   habitats for all sampling dates except week three (P = 0.02) when a
   greater abundance was observed in the sunflower habitat. Species
   diversity did not differ (P-hand = 0.99, P-pan = 0.97) between habitats
   although community composition differed with high significance (P <
   0.01) indicating that these habitats had comparable diversity levels but
   attracted particular bee assemblages. Our study identifies sunflower
   crops as useful pollinator resources, especially for Bombus species, and
   provides insight into single species annual crops' potential
   contribution to pollinator conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Phenotypic diversification of flowers is frequently
   attributed to selection by different functional groups of pollinators.
   During optimization of floral phenotype, developmental robustness to
   genetic and non-genetic perturbations is expected to limit the
   phenotypic space available for future evolutionary changes. Although
   adaptive divergence can occur without altering the basic developmental
   programme of the flower (ontogenetic scaling hypothesis), the rarity of
   reversion to ancestral states following adaptive radiations of
   pollination syndromes suggests that changes in the ancestral
   developmental programme of the flower are common during such
   evolutionary transitions. Evidence suggests that flower diversification
   into different pollination syndromes in the Loasoideae genus Caiophora
   took place during a recent adaptive radiation in the central Andes. This
   involved transitions from bee to hummingbird and small rodent
   pollination. The aim of this work was to examine if the adaptive
   radiation of pollination syndromes in Caiophora occurred through
   ontogenetic scaling or involved a departure from the ontogenetic pattern
   basal to this genus.
   Methods We used geometric morphometric variables to describe the shape
   and size of floral structures taking part in the pollination mechanism
   of Loasoideae. This approach was used to characterize the developmental
   trajectories of three species basal to the genus Caiophora through
   shape-size relationships (ontogenetic allometry). We then tested if the
   shape-size combinations of these structures in mature flowers of derived
   Caiophora species fall within the phenotypic space predicted by the
   development of basal species.
   Key Results Variation in the size and shape of Caiophora flowers does
   not overlap with the pattern of ontogenetic allometry of basal species.
   Derived bee-, hummingbird- and rodent-pollinated species had divergent
   ontogenetic patterns of floral development from that observed for basal
   bee-pollinated species.
   Conclusions The adaptive radiation of Caiophora involved significant
   changes in the developmental pattern of the flowers, rejecting the
   ontogenetic scaling hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential increase of mobile telephony has led to a pronounced
   increase in electromagnetic fields in the environment that may affect
   pollinator communities and threaten pollination as a key ecosystem
   service. Previous studies conducted on model species under laboratory
   conditions have shown negative effects of electromagnetic radiation
   (EMR) on reproductive success, development, and navigation of insects.
   However, the potential effects that widespread mobile telecommunication
   antennas have on wild pollinator communities outside the laboratory
   microcosm are still unknown. Here we studied the effects of EMR from
   telecommunication antennas on key wild pollinator groups (wild bees,
   hoverflies, bee flies, remaining flies, beetles, butterflies, and
   wasps). We measured EMR at 4 distances (50, 100, 200 and 400 m) from 10
   antennas (5 on Limnos Island and 5 on Lesvos Island, eastern
   Mediterranean, Greece), and correlated EMR values with insect abundance
   and richness (the latter only for wild bees and hoverflies). All
   pollinator groups except butterflies were affected by EMR. In both
   islands, beetle, wasp, and hoverfly abundance decreased with EMR,
   whereas the abundance of underground-nesting wild bees and bee flies
   unexpectedly increased with EMR. The effect of EMR on the abundance of
   remaining flies differed between islands. With respect to species
   richness, EMR only tended to have a negative effect on hoverflies in
   Limnos. As EMR affected the abundance of several insect guilds
   negatively, and changed the composition of wild pollinators in natural
   habitats, it might also have additional ecological and economic impacts
   on the maintenance of wild plant diversity, crop production and human

   was built using mostly off-the-shelf components and has a novel feeding
   mechanism that uses servos to perform refill operations. We used the
   robotic system in two separate behavioral studies with bumblebees

   The software and the hardware design are open source. The development of
   cheap open-source prototyping platforms during the recent years has
   opened up many possibilities in designing of experiments. Automatization
   not only reduces workload, but also potentially allows experimental

Title = {{Longan fruit farmers' demand for policies aimed at conserving native
   pollinating bees in Northern Thailand}},
Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Northern Thailand is orienting its agriculture towards intensive
   production systems at risk of being subjected to the current worldwide
   pollinator crisis. Bee-friendly pest management, improving native bee
   habitats within agro-forest ecosystems and fostering the husbandry of
   native bee species are three widely recognized strategies to conserve
   the local pollinating fauna. We attempted at eliciting farmers'
   valuation of these measures and that of their potential effect on local
   native bees, by conducting a choice experiment with 198 longan
   (Dimocarpus longan) farmers. The results of a mixed logit model indicate
   a significant heterogeneity in farmers' preferences, part of which was
   explained by the respondents' attitude towards native bees, among other
   idiosyncratic variables such as gender. We also determined a generally
   positive willingness to pay for the above mentioned conservation
   measures, which implemented together were valued at approx. (sic)18.1 by
   the average household, all else equal. Additionally, avoiding a 50\%
   native bee population decline was valued in average at (sic)40.5 per
   household. These estimates stand in strong contrast with the
   comparatively high economic losses such a decline could potentially
   entail in terms of reduced longan production and the relatively low
   investment costs to implement a conservation strategy aimed at
   preventing such losses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Does Consumer Awareness of Neonicotinoid Insecticides Influence Their

Abstract = {{Consumer awareness of neonicotinoid (neonic) insecticides is growing (in
   part) due to increased publicity and media attention. Environmental
   groups want neonic insecticides to be banned because of their perceived
   potential negative consequences on nontarget species (especially bees
   and other pollinator insects). Several retail outlets and governmental
   agencies are now requiring the ornamental horticulture industry
   (hereafter, green industry) to label plants grown using neonic
   insecticides. Although the scientific value of the mandatory labeling
   policies are debatable, neonic labeling may negatively influence
   consumers' demand for plants. Research on consumers' awareness of neonic
   insecticides is limited, and the extent to which awareness influences
   preferences and shopping behavior is less understood. This manuscript
   addresses these research gaps by investigating correlations between
   awareness of neonic insecticides, knowledge about related topics (e.g.,
   gardening and pollinator insect health), and purchase likelihood, using
   an online survey of 921 U.S. consumers. Results indicate that only 24\%
   of surveyed plant purchasers are aware of neonic insecticides. Consumers
   who are aware of neonic insecticides are more knowledgeable about plants
   that improve pollinator health and entomology than those who are not
   aware. Labels with ``neonic-free{''} wording were the least preferred
   and influential pollinator-related in-store promotion. However,
   awareness of neonic insecticides was positively correlated with
   consumers' purchase likelihood for ``neonic-free{''} plants. Overall,
   awareness influences consumers' shopping behavior, which could
   necessitate altering green industry pest management strategies as
   consumers' awareness of neonic insecticides increases due to the
   negative publicity surrounding it.}},

Abstract = {{In comparison to other insects, like honeybees, bumblebees are very
   effective pollinators. Even though landing is a crucial part of
   pollination, little is known about how bumblebees orchestrate the final,
   critical moments of landing. Here, we use high-speed recordings to
   capture the fine details of the landing behaviour of free-flying
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), while landing on a flat platform with
   different orientations. We find that the bees have a fairly constant
   body and head orientation at the moment of leg extension, irrespective
   of platform tilt. At the same moment in time, the distance to the
   platform is held constant at around 8 mm (with the exception of low
   platform tilts). The orientation of the antennae and the first appendage
   that touches the platform vary between platform orientations, while the
   duration of the hover phase does not. Overall, the final moments of
   landing in bumblebees and their close relatives, the honeybees, are
   similar. However, the distance to the platform at the moment of leg
   extension and the duration of the hover phase are different in
   bumblebees and honeybees, suggesting that they are primarily adapted to
   land on surfaces with different orientations.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the reproductive biology, including the floral biology,

   Pachira aquatica, a native and dominant tropical tree of fresh water
   wetlands, throughout the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico. The
   flowers present nocturnal anthesis, copious nectar production and sugar
   concentration (range 18-23\%) suitable for nocturnal visitors such as
   bats and sphingid moths. The main nocturnal visitors were bats and
   sphingid moths while bees were the main diurnal visitors. There were no
   differences in legitimate visitation rates among bats, moths and honey
   bees. Bats and honey bees fed mainly on pollen while moths fed on
   nectar, suggesting resource partitioning. Eight species of bats carried
   pollen but Leptonycteris yerbabuenae is probably the most effective
   pollinator due to its higher pollen loads. The sphingid moths Manduca
   rustica, Cocytius duponchel and Eumorpha satellitia were recorded
   visiting flowers. Hand pollination experiments indicated a predominant
   outcrossing breeding system. Open pollination experiments resulted in a
   null fruit set, indicating pollen limitation; however, mean reproductive
   success, according to a seasonal census, was 17 +/- 3\%; these
   contrasting results could be explained by the seasonal availability of

Abstract = {{In bumblebee-pollinated Cypripedium macranthos var. rebunense, some
   plants have small labella that do not allow pollinating queens to enter,

   We found that after anthesis, the labellum gradually droops, and its
   width and length (but not height) distinctly increase, eventually
   producing an elongate and dorsoventrally compressed shape. The rate of
   increase in labellum size was significantly greater in flowers that
   initially had a smaller labellum, so that the post-anthesis changes
   actually enabled large-bodied bumblebees to enter those labella.
   Therefore, we conclude that C. macranthos var. rebunense relied on only
   bumblebee queens for pollination, irrespective of labellum size at the

Abstract = {{Many members of the Orchidaceae offer no rewards to pollinators and
   attract them through deception. One common approach is to mimic the
   specific floral signals of co-flowering species that are rewarding
   (Batesian floral mimicry) to exploit their pollinators. We investigated
   two putative Batesian floral mimics, Disa gladioliflora subsp.
   capricornis and Disa ferruginea, within a single community to determine
   whether their pollinators are able to discriminate them from their
   models. Despite mimics being indistinguishable from models in terms of
   floral colour as perceived by pollinators, strong preference for model
   flowers was observed in both systems. We nevertheless recorded frequent
   pollen transfer in D. gladioliflora subsp. capricornis, suggesting
   pollination still occurs in the face of pollinator discrimination.
   Although the inability of pollinators to discriminate between models and
   mimics is often cited as a requirement for Batesian floral mimicry, we
   suggest that this need not be the case. Pollination by discriminating
   visitors may still lead to fruit set, with the most accurate mimics
   expected to have the highest fitness. Batesian floral mimicry may thus
   be best indicated when mimic fitness is positively correlated with its

Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships of corbiculate bees have been a well-known
   focus of controversies over the past 30 years. The majority of the
   morphological datasets support the monophyly of Apina + Meliponina,
   whereas molecular datasets recover Meliponina as sister to Bombina. This
   issue is especially critical to the proper understanding of the
   evolution of clusters of traits that define the corbiculate eusocial
   behaviour. This work provides a description and discussion on characters
   of the head capsule, mandibles and sitophore of bees. Thirty-three
   characters are proposed and optimized within concurrent phylogenetic
   hypotheses for corbiculate bees, which results in seven derived
   character-states supporting the monophyly of the Apina + Meliponina +
   Bombina and nine supporting the Apina + Meliponina clades. Although some
   striking synapomorphies (e.g. tentorial bridge, pleurostomal condyle,
   hypopharyngeal lobe) support the former clade, most characters
   supporting the latter (i.e. Apina + Meliponina) were losses/reductions.
   Moreover, two previously undescribed character transformations on
   hypostoma and sitophore favour the Bombina + Meliponina clade. Internal
   head capsule characters are useful for phylogenetic analysis in
   comparative studies of bees, and corbiculate bees in particular, when
   efforts are made to solve the corbiculate controversy'. An attempt is
   made to standardize the current terminology used for bees and for other

   combination with molecular data using parsimony. The monophyly of
   Augochlorini and most genera is confirmed, with divergence of the main
   lineages of the tribe around 55-20 Ma. Seven clades were supported by

Abstract = {{Understanding the importance of biodiversity in applied settings is a
   central theme for ecologists. Pollination is an essential ecosystem

   Empirical examples which link functional outcomes of increased

   importance of wild and managed pollinator communities to apple
   production, we assessed the effect of wild and managed bee abundance and
   diversity on pollen limitation and seed set on commercial farms in New
   York State. Seed set increased and pollen limitation decreased with
   increasing wild bee species richness, functional group diversity (based
   on nesting, sociality, and size traits), and abundance, but not with
   honey bee abundance. Functional group diversity explained more variation
   in apple seed set than species richness. Our findings demonstrate the
   important role of functional complementarity of wild bees, defined here
   as functional group diversity, to crop pollination even in the presence
   of large populations of managed honey bees. Therefore, our results
   suggest that management of diverse pollinator communities may decrease
   reliance on managed honey bees for pollination services and enhance crop

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Brassicaceae is one of the most diversified families
   in the angiosperms. However, most species from this family exhibit a
   very similar floral bauplan. In this study, we explore the Brassicaceae
   floral morphospace, examining how corolla shape variation (an estimation
   of developmental robustness), integration and disparity vary among
   phylogenetically related species. Our aim is to check whether these
   floral attributes have evolved in this family despite its apparent
   morphological conservation, and to test the role of pollinators in
   driving this evolution.
   Methods Using geometric morphometric tools, we calculated the phenotypic
   variation, disparity and integration of the corolla shape of 111
   Brassicaceae taxa. We subsequently inferred the phylogenetic
   relationships of these taxa and explored the evolutionary lability of
   corolla shape. Finally, we sampled the pollinator assemblages of every
   taxon included in this study, and determined their pollination niches
   using a modularity algorithm. We explore the relationship between
   pollination niche and the attributes of corolla shape.
   Key Results Phylogenetic signal was weak for all corolla shape
   attributes. All taxa had generalized pollination systems. Nevertheless,
   they belong to different pollination niches. There were significant
   differences in corolla shape among pollination niches even after
   controlling for the phylogenetic relationship of the plant taxa. Corolla
   shape variation and disparity was significantly higher in those taxa
   visited mostly by nocturnal moths, indicating that this pollination
   niche is associated with a lack of developmental robustness. Corolla
   integration was higher in those taxa visited mostly by hovering
   long-tongued flies and long-tongued large bees.
   Conclusions Corolla variation, integration and disparity were
   evolutionarily labile and evolved very recently in the evolutionary
   history of the Brassicaceae. These floral attributes were strongly
   related to the pollination niche. Even in a plant clade having a very
   generalized pollination system and exhibiting a conserved floral
   bauplan, pollinators can drive the evolution of important developmental
   attributes of corolla shape.}},

Abstract = {{The activity of a honey bee colony is heavily environmentally dependent.
   So, monitoring the colony activity should include the information of
   biological and physical factors both inside and outside of a beehive.
   However, using manual methods to simultaneously monitor the incoming and

   factors with high temporal resolution may cause drawbacks such as labor
   intensive and low accuracy. To cope with these difficulties, this study
   develops an automatic monitoring system for honey bee behavior based on
   wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. The monitoring system can be
   installed at the entrance of a beehive. The WSN-based monitoring system
   can not only detect the environmental factors both inside and outside
   the beehive, but also provide the long-term data of incoming and
   outgoing foraging activities of honey bees with a high temporal
   resolution. The results show that the average counting accuracy of
   incoming and outgoing behavior is 84.92\% and 85.95\%, respectively.
   Moreover, the long-term monitoring data that represent the frequencies
   of incoming and outgoing activities and the beehive related
   environmental factors are also analyzed. According to the data, honey
   bees become more energetic when the daily average ambient temperature is
   higher than 25 degrees C, and the average ambient relative humidity is
   between 60\%RH and 70\%RH. The experimental results show that the
   proposed monitoring system can reliably collect environmental data and
   the data related to the activities of honey bees simultaneously. This
   study also demonstrates that the proposed monitoring system is an
   excellent platform, which can be used to examine the relation between
   honey bees' incoming and outgoing activities and environmental factors.

Abstract = {{Pollination services are increasingly threatened by the loss and
   modification of natural habitats, posing a risk to the maintenance of
   both native plant biodiversity and agricultural production. In order to
   safeguard pollination services, it is essential to examine the impacts
   of habitat degradation on the population dynamics of key pollinators and
   identify potential ``rescue pollinators{''} capable of persisting in
   these human-altered landscapes. Using a landscape genetic approach, we
   assessed the impact of landscape structure on genetic differentiation in
   the widely-distributed tropical stingless bee Trigona spinipes (Apidae:
   Meliponini) across agricultural landscape mosaics composed of coffee
   plantations and Atlantic forest fragments in southeastern Brazil. We
   genotyped 115 bees at 16 specific and highly polymorphic microsatellite
   loci, developed using next-generation sequencing. Our results reveal
   that T. spinipes is capable of dispersing across remarkably long
   distances, as we did not find genetic differentiation across a 200 km
   range, nor fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Furthermore, gene flow
   was not affected by forest cover, land cover, or elevation, indicating
   that reproductive individuals are able to disperse well through
   agricultural landscapes and across altitudinal gradients. We also found
   evidence of a recent population expansion, suggesting that this
   opportunistic stingless bee is capable of colonizing degraded habitats.
   Our results thus suggest that T. spinipes can persist in heavily-altered
   landscapes and can be regarded as a rescue pollinator, potentially
   compensating for the decline of other native pollinators in degraded
   tropical landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are important pollinators of both crops and
   wildflowers. Their contribution to this essential ecosystem service has
   been threatened over recent decades by changes in land use, which have
   led to declines in their populations. In order to design effective
   conservation measures, it is important to understand the effects of
   variation in landscape composition and structure on the foraging
   activities of worker bumble bees. This is because the viability of
   individual colonies is likely to be affected by the trade-off between
   the energetic costs of foraging over greater distances and the potential
   gains from access to additional resources. We used field surveys,
   molecular genetics, and fine resolution remote sensing to estimate the
   locations of wild bumble bee nests and to infer foraging distances
   across a 20-km(2) agricultural landscape in southern England, UK. We
   investigated five species, including the rare B. ruderatus and
   ecologically similar but widespread B. hortorum. We compared worker
   foraging distances between species and examined how variation in
   landscape composition and structure affected foraging distances at the
   colony level. Mean worker foraging distances differed significantly
   between species. Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, and B. ruderatus
   exhibited significantly greater mean foraging distances (551, 536, and
   501 m, respectively) than B. hortorum and B. pascuorum (336 and 272 m,
   respectively). There was wide variation in worker foraging distances
   between colonies of the same species, which was in turn strongly
   influenced by the amount and spatial configuration of available foraging
   habitats. Shorter foraging distances were found for colonies where the
   local landscape had high coverage and low fragmentation of seminatural
   vegetation, including managed agri-environmental field margins. The
   strength of relationships between different landscape variables and
   foraging distance varied between species, for example the strongest
   relationship for B. ruderatus being with floral cover of preferred
   forage plants. Our findings suggest that management of landscape
   composition and configuration has the potential to reduce foraging
   distances across a range of bumble bee species. There is thus potential
   for improvements in the design and implementation of landscape
   management options, such as agri-environment schemes, aimed at providing
   foraging habitat for bumble bees and enhancing crop pollination
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification and resulting habitat loss are put forward as
   the main causes of flower visitor decline. However, the impact of
   urbanization, the prime driver of land-use intensification in Europe, is
   poorly studied. In particular, our understanding of whether and how it
   affects the composition and functioning of flower visitor assemblages is
   scant, yet required to cope with increasing urbanization worldwide.
   Here, we use a nation-wide dataset of plant-flower visitor (Coleoptera,
   Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera) interactions sampled by citizen
   scientists following a standardized protocol to assess macroecological
   changes in richness and composition of flower visitor communities with
   urbanization. We measured the community composition by quantifying the
   relative occurrence of generalist and specialist flower visitors based
   on their specialisation on flowering plant families. We show that
   urbanization is associated with reduced flower visitor richness and a
   shift in community composition toward generalist insects, indicating a
   modification of the functional composition of communities. These results
   suggest that urbanization affects not only the richness of flower
   visitor assemblages but may also cause their large-scale functional
   homogenization. Future research should focus on designing measures to

Abstract = {{Potential detrimental impacts of neonicotinoids on non-target organisms,

   ban of three neonicotinoids by the EU. While recent research has
   fortified concerns regarding the effects of neonicotinoids on ecosystem
   service (ES) providers, potential impacts have been considered
   negligible in systems with a relatively small proportion of arable land

   there is not sufficient information to assess magnitude and extent of
   neonicotinoid application, as well as potential non-target impacts on ES
   providers in grass-dominated systems with frequent land-use change.
   Using Ireland as an example, we show that the highly dynamic
   agricultural landscape, in conjunction with estimated persistence times
   of neonicotinoids in soils, may lead to a much larger area (18.6 +/- 0.6
   \% of the Irish agricultural area) exposed to these pesticides than
   initially assumed. Furthermore we present a number of important gaps in

Abstract = {{We previously characterized and quantified the influence of land use on
   survival and productivity of colonies positioned in six apiaries and
   found that colonies in apiaries surrounded by more land in uncultivated
   forage experienced greater annual survival, and generally more honey
   production. Here, detailed metrics of honey bee health were assessed
   over three years in colonies positioned in the same six apiaries. The
   colonies were located in North Dakota during the summer months and were
   transported to California for almond pollination every winter. Our aim
   was to identify relationships among measures of colony and individual
   bee health that impacted and predicted overwintering survival of
   colonies. We tested the hypothesis that colonies in apiaries surrounded
   by more favorable land use conditions would experience improved health.
   We modeled colony and individual bee health indices at a critical time
   point (autumn, prior to overwintering) and related them to eventual
   spring survival for California almond pollination. Colony measures that
   predicted overwintering apiary survival included the amount of pollen
   collected, brood production, and Varroa destructor mite levels. At the
   individual bee level, expression of vitellogenin, defensin1, and
   lysozyme2 were important markers of overwinter survival. This study is a

Abstract = {{Iridescence is a form of structural coloration, produced by a range of
   structures, in which hue is dependent on viewing angle {[}1-4]. One of
   these structures, the diffraction grating, is found both in animals (for
   example, beetles {[}2]) and in plants (on the petals of some animal
   pollinated flowers {[}5]). The behavioral impacts of floral iridescence
   and its potential ecological significance are unknown {[}6-9].
   Animal-pollinated flowers are described as ``sensory billboards''
   {[}10], with many floral features contributing to a conspicuous display
   that filters prospective pollinators. Yet floral iridescence is more
   subtle to the human eye than that of many animal displays because the
   floral diffraction grating is not perfectly regular {[}5-9]. This
   presents a puzzle: if the function of petals is to attract pollinators,
   then flowers might be expected to optimize iridescence to increase
   showiness. On the other hand, pollinators memorize floral colors as
   consistent advertisements of reward quality, and iridescence might
   corrupt flower color identity. Here we tested the trade-off between
   flower detectability and recognition, requiring bumblebees (Bombus
   terrestris) to identify artificial flowers that varied in pigmentation
   and degree of iridescence. We find that iridescence does increase target
   detectability but that ``perfect'' iridescence (produced by an
   artificial diffraction grating) corrupts target identity and bees make
   many mistakes. However, ``imperfect'' floral iridescence does not lead
   to mistaken target identity, while still benefitting flower
   detectability. We hypothesize that similar trade-offs might be found in
   the many naturally ``imperfect'' iridescence-producing structures found
   in animal-animal, as well as other plant-animal, interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Allometric relationships among morphological traits underlie important
   patterns in ecology. These relationships are often phylogenetically
   shared; thus quantifying allometric relationships may allow for
   estimating difficult-to-measure traits across species. One such trait,
   proboscis length in bees, is assumed to be important in structuring bee
   communities and plant-pollinator networks. However, it is difficult to
   measure and thus rarely included in ecological analyses. We measured
   intertegular distance (as a measure of body size) and proboscis length
   (glossa and prementum, both individually and combined) of 786 individual
   bees of 100 species across 5 of the 7 extant bee families (Hymenoptera:
   Apoidea: Anthophila). Using linear models and model selection, we
   determined which parameters provided the best estimate of proboscis
   length. We then used coefficients to estimate the relationship between
   intertegular distance and proboscis length, while also considering
   family. Using allometric equations with an estimation for a scaling
   coefficient between intertegular distance and proboscis length and
   coefficients for each family, we explain 91\% of the variance in
   species-level means for bee proboscis length among bee species. However,
   within species, individual-level intertegular distance was a poor
   predictor of individual proboscis length. To make our findings easy to
   use, we created an R package that allows estimation of proboscis length
   for individual bee species by inputting only family and intertegular
   distance. The R package also calculates foraging distance and body mass
   based on previously published equations. Thus by considering both
   taxonomy and intertegular distance we enable accurate estimation of an
   ecologically and evolutionarily important trait.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Recently there has been increasing focus on monitoring pollinating
   insects, due to concerns about their declines, and interest in the role
   of volunteers in monitoring pollinators, particularly bumblebees, via
   citizen science.
   Methodology / Principal Findings
   The Big Bumblebee Discovery was a one-year citizen science project run
   by a partnership of EDF Energy, the British Science Association and the
   Centre for Ecology \& Hydrology which sought to assess the influence of
   the landscape at multiple scales on the diversity and abundance of
   bumblebees. Timed counts of bumblebees (Bombus spp.; identified to six
   colour groups) visiting focal plants of lavender (Lavendula spp.) were
   carried out by about 13 000 primary school children (7-11 years old)
   from over 4000 schools across the UK. 3948 reports were received
   totalling 26 868 bumblebees. We found that while the wider landscape
   type had no significant effect on reported bumblebee abundance, the
   local proximity to flowers had a significant effect (fewer bumblebees
   where other flowers were reported to be >5m away from the focal plant).
   However, the rate of mis-identifcation, revealed by photographs uploaded
   by participants and a photo-based quiz, was high.
   Conclusions / Significance
   Our citizen science results support recent research on the importance of
   local flocal resources on pollinator abundance. Timed counts of insects
   visiting a lure plant is potentially an effective approach for
   standardised pollinator monitoring, engaging a large number of
   participants with a simple protocol. However, the relatively high rate
   of mis-identifications (compared to reports from previous pollinator
   citizen science projects) highlights the importance of investing in
   resources to train volunteers. Also, to be a scientifically valid method
   for enquiry, citizen science data needs to be sufficiently high quality,
   so receiving supporting evidence (such as photographs) would allow this
   to be tested and for records to be verified.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous angiosperms rely on pollinators to ensure efficient flower
   fertilization, offering a reward consisting of nourishing nectars
   produced by specialized floral cells, known as nectaries. Nectar
   components are believed to derive from phloem sap that is enzymatically
   processed and transformed within nectaries. An increasing body of
   evidence suggests that nectar composition, mainly amino acids, may
   influence pollinator attraction and fidelity. This notwithstanding,
   little is known about the range of natural variability in nectar content
   for crop species. Sugar and amino acid composition of nectar harvested
   from field-grown plants at the 63-65 phenological stage was determined
   for a set of 44 winter genotypes of rapeseed, a bee-pollinated crop.
   Significant differences were found for solute concentrations, and an
   even higher variability was evident for nectar volumes, resulting in
   striking differences when results were expressed on a single flower
   basis. The comparison of nectar and phloem sap from a subset of eight
   varieties pointed out qualitative and quantitative diversities with
   respect to both sugars and amino acids. Notably, amino acid
   concentration in phloem sap was up to 100 times higher than in nectar.
   Phloem sap showed a much more uniform composition, suggesting that
   nectar variability depends mainly on nectary metabolism. A better
   understanding of the basis of nectar production would allow an
   improvement of seed set efficiency, as well as hive management and honey
   production.}},

Title = {{Monitoring Flower Visitation Networks and Interactions between Pairs of
   Bumble Bees in a Large Outdoor Flight Cage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators, such as bees, often develop multi-location routes
   (traplines) to exploit subsets of flower patches within larger plant
   populations. How individuals establish such foraging areas in the
   presence of other foragers is poorly explored. Here we investigated the
   foraging patterns of pairs of bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) released
   sequentially into an 880m(2) outdoor flight cage containing 10 feeding
   stations (artificial flowers). Using motion-sensitive video cameras
   mounted on flowers, we mapped the flower visitation networks of both
   foragers, quantified their interactions and compared their foraging
   success over an entire day. Overall, bees that were released first
   (residents) travelled 37\% faster and collected 77\% more nectar,
   thereby reaching a net energy intake rate 64\% higher than bees released
   second (newcomers). However, this prior-experience advantage decreased
   as newcomers became familiar with the spatial configuration of the
   flower array. When both bees visited the same flower simultaneously, the
   most frequent outcome was for the resident to evict the newcomer. On the
   rare occasions when newcomers evicted residents, the two bees increased
   their frequency of return visits to that flower. These competitive
   interactions led to a significant (if only partial) spatial overlap
   between the foraging patterns of pairs of bees. While newcomers may
   initially use social cues (such as olfactory footprints) to exploit
   flowers used by residents, either because such cues indicate higher
   rewards and/or safety from predation, residents may attempt to preserve
   their monopoly over familiar resources through exploitation and
   interference. We discuss how these interactions may favour spatial
   partitioning, thereby maximising the foraging efficiency of individuals
   and colonies.}},

Abstract = {{Global food security, particularly crop fertilization and yield
   production, is threatened by heat waves that are projected to increase
   in frequency and magnitude with climate change. Effects of heat stress
   on the fertilization of insect-pollinated plants are not well
   understood, but experiments conducted primarily in self-pollinated
   crops, such as wheat, show that transfer of fertile pollen may recover
   yield following stress. We hypothesized that in the partially
   pollinator-dependent crop, faba bean (Vicia faba L.), insect pollination
   would elicit similar yield recovery following heat stress. We exposed
   potted faba bean plants to heat stress for 5 days during floral
   development and anthesis. Temperature treatments were representative of
   heat waves projected in the UK for the period 2021-2050 and onwards.
   Following temperature treatments, plants were distributed in flight
   cages and either pollinated by domesticated Bombus terrestris colonies
   or received no insect pollination. Yield loss due to heat stress at 30
   degrees C was greater in plants excluded from pollinators (15\%)
   compared to those with bumblebee pollination (2.5\%). Thus, the
   pollinator dependency of faba bean yield was 16\% at control
   temperatures (18-26 degrees C) and extreme stress (34 degrees C), but
   was 53\% following intermediate heat stress at 30 degrees C. These
   findings provide the first evidence that the pollinator dependency of
   crops can be modified by heat stress, and suggest that insect
   pollination may become more important in crop production as the
   probability of heat waves increases. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Management that enhances floral resources can be an effective way to
   support pollinators and pollination services. Some wildlife-friendly
   farming schemes aim to enhance the density and diversity of floral
   resources in non-crop habitats on farms, whilst managing crop fields
   intensively. Others, such as organic farming, aim to support ecological
   processes within both crop and non-crop habitats. How effective these
   different approaches are for supporting pollination services at the farm
   scale is unknown. We compared organic farming with two non-organic
   wildlife-friendly farming schemes: one prescriptive (Conservation Grade,
   CG) and one flexible (Entry Level Stewardship, ELS), and sampled a
   representative selection of crop and non-crop habitats. We investigated
   the spatial distribution and overall level of: (i) flower density and
   diversity, (ii) pollinator density and diversity and (iii) pollination
   services provided to Californian poppy (Eschscholzia californica) potted
   phytometer plants. Organic crop habitats supported a higher density of
   flowers, insect-wildflower visits, and fruit set of phytometers than CG
   or ELS crop habitats. Non-crop habitats supported a higher density of
   flowers and insect-flower visits than crop habitats on CG and ELS farms.
   Pollination services were higher on organic farms overall compared to CG
   or ELS. Pollinator diversity and density did not differ between schemes,
   at the point or farm level. CG farms received the highest total number
   of insect-wildflower visits. The findings support organic farming
   practices that increase floral resources in crop habitats, such as
   sowing clover or reduced herbicide usage, as mechanisms to enhance
   pollination services. However trade-offs with other ecosystem services
   are likely and these are discussed. The findings support the CG scheme
   as a way of supporting pollinators within farms where high wheat yields
   are required. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bees provide critical pollination services to 87\% of angiosperm plants;

   the quality and quantity of resources available for female bees to

   relationship between landscape scale agricultural intensification and

   species, Andrena nasonii. We show that agricultural intensification at
   the landscape scale was associated with a reduction in the average size
   of field collected A. nasonii adults in highly agricultural landscapes
   but not with the number of individuals collected. Small females carried
   significantly smaller (40\%) pollen loads than large females, which is
   likely to have consequences for subsequent offspring production and

Abstract = {{In Italy, alien acacias have been introduced for ornamental and
   reforestation purposes, and some species became invasive occupying
   patches of the Mediterranean landscape. On the Island of Elba (Central
   Italy), Acacia dealbata and A. pycnantha form dense stands at short
   distance, showing an impressive massive flowering at the end of the
   winter/early spring. Our aim was to investigate the behaviour of the two
   species in relation to the flowering features, from phenology to floral
   characteristics, and their replay to the observed flower visitors.
   Differences between the two species emerged on all the parameters
   considered. A. pycnantha peak of flowering occurred later than A.
   dealbata and showed larger flower heads (FHs), more flowers/head,
   stamens/flower and polyads. On A. dealbata, we recorded longer racemes
   and more FHs/raceme, determining a more flower-dense crown. Even if
   contacts with flower visitors were generally low on both species, A.
   dealbata showed a more heterogeneous visitor assemblage. Both acacias
   species interacted with local generalist pollinators, as bumblebees and
   honey bees. Flower handling and resource collection strategy by the
   honey bee indicate a long-term relationship between the bee and the

Abstract = {{Honey bee colonies in the United States have suffered from an increased

   characterization of the components of the UPR in honey bees. The
   IRE1-dependent splicing of the mRNA for the transcription factor Xbp1,
   leading to translation of an isoform with more transactivation
   potential, represents the most conserved of the UPR pathways. Honey bees
   and other Apoidea possess unique features in the Xbp1 mRNA splice site,

   pathway. However, we find robust induction of target genes upon UPR
   stimulation. In addition, the IRE1 pathway activation, as assessed by
   splicing of Xbp1 mRNA upon UPR, is conserved. By providing foundational

Abstract = {{Desert mistletoe, Phoradendron californicum (Viscaceae), is a dioecious
   parasitic plant that grows on woody legumes in the Mojave and Sonoran
   Deserts, produces minute flowers during winter, and is dispersed by
   birds defecating fruits. Pollination of desert mistletoe has not been
   examined despite the species' reliance on insects for transporting
   pollen from male to female plants. I investigated the pollination of P.
   californicumn parasitizing Acacia greggii (Fabaceae) shrubs at 3 sites
   at different elevations in the Mojave Desert of southern Nevada during
   February 2015. I examined pollen from male flowers, aspirated insects
   landing on female flowers, and counted pollen grains in insect pollen
   loads. Desert mistletoe's tricolpate pollen differed from a previous
   description by being oblate instead of subprolate in equatorial view.
   Female flowers were visited by 13 species of Diptera in 10 genera and 6
   families and 3 species of Hymenoptera in 3 families. Almost all (98.5\%)
   of the pollen carried by insects was from desert mistletoe. Five species
   of phytophagous fruit flies in Tephritidae were frequently found on
   flowers, comprising 53\% of the insects collected, but carried low
   amounts of P californicum pollen. Two species of blow flies in
   Calliphoridae, both larval decomposers of animals, were also relatively
   abundant on flowers and carried moderate to high pollen loads. Flies in
   Syrphidae, 2 predators and 1 plant-decomposer, carried varying amounts
   of conspecific pollen. Conspecific pollen loads also varied on a species
   of native bee in Halictidae and on naturalized honey bees in Apidae.
   Desert mistletoe appears to be pollinated mostly by tephritids, due to
   their abundance on female flowers, and by calliphorids. Blow flies would
   be more likely than fruit flies to carry pollen between male and female
   plants on different host shrubs due to their larger size and stronger
   flight. Parasitic, dioecious P californicum plants appear to rely on a
   web of mutualism between fruit-eating birds and flower-fertilizing

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Surveys of bumble bees and the plants they visit, carried out in 1974
   near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado, were repeated
   in 2007, thus permitting the testing of hypotheses arising from observed
   climate change over the intervening 33-yr period. As expected, given an
   increase in average air temperature with climate warming and a declining
   temperature with increasing elevation, there have been significant
   shifts toward higher elevation for queens or workers or both, for most
   bumble bee species, for bumble bee queens when species are combined, and
   for two focal plant species, with no significant downward shifts.
   However, contrary to our hypotheses, we failed to observe significant
   altitudinal changes for some bumble bee species and most plant species,
   and observed changes in elevation were often less than the upward shift
   of 317m required to maintain average temperature. As expected, community
   flowering phenology shifted toward earlier in the season throughout our
   study area, but bumble bee phenology generally did not change, resulting
   in decreased synchrony between bees and plants. However, we were unable
   to confirm the narrower expectation that phenologies of bumble bee
   workers and community flowering coincided in 1974 but not in 2007. As
   expected, because of reduced synchrony between bumble bees and community
   flowering, bumble bee abundance was reduced in 2007 compared with 1974.
   Hence, climate change in our study area has apparently resulted
   primarily in reduced abundance and upward shift in distribution for
   bumble bees and shift toward earlier seasonality for plant flowering.
   Quantitative disagreements between climate change expectations and our
   observations warrant further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The delivery of ecosystem services by mobile organisms depends on the
   distribution of those organisms, which is, in turn, affected by
   resources at local and landscape scales. Pollinator-dependent crops rely
   on mobile animals like bees for crop production, and the spatial
   relationship between floral resources and nest location for these
   central-place foragers influences the delivery of pollination services.
   Current models that map pollination coverage in agricultural regions
   utilize landscape-level estimates of floral availability and nesting
   incidence inferred from expert opinion, rather than direct assessments.
   Foraging distance is often derived from proxies of bee body size, rather
   than direct measurements of foraging that account for behavioral
   responses to floral resource type and distribution. The lack of direct
   measurements of nesting incidence and foraging distances may lead to
   inaccurate mapping of pollination services. We examined the role of
   local-scale floral resource presence from hedgerow plantings on nest
   incidence of ground-nesting bees in field margins and within
   monoculture, conventionally managed sunflower fields in California's
   Central Valley. We tracked bee movement into fields using fluorescent
   powder. We then used these data to simulate the distribution of
   pollination services within a crop field. Contrary to expert opinion, we
   found that ground-nesting native bees nested both in fields and edges,
   though nesting rates declined with distance into field. Further, we
   detected no effect of field-margin floral enhancements on nesting. We
   found evidence of an exponential decay rate of bee movement into fields,
   indicating that foraging predominantly occurred in less than 1\% of
   medium-sized bees' predicted typical foraging range. Although we found
   native bees nesting within agricultural fields, their restricted
   foraging movements likely centralize pollination near nest sites. Our
   data thus predict a heterogeneous distribution of pollination services

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Flowering plants display considerable variation in
   mating system, specifically the relative frequency of cross-and
   self-fertilization. The majority of estimates of outcrossing rate do not
   account for temporal variation, particularly during the flowering
   season. Here, we investigated seasonal variation in mating and fertility
   in Incarvillea sinensis (Bignoniaceae), an annual with showy,
   insect-pollinated, `one-day' flowers capable of delayed selfing. We
   examined the influence of several biotic and abiotic environmental
   factors on day-to-day variation in fruit set, seed set and patterns of
   mating.
   Methods We recorded daily flower number and pollinator abundance in nine
   3 x 3-m patches in a population at Mu Us Sand land, Inner Mongolia,
   China. From marked flowers we collected data on daily fruit and seed set
   and estimated outcrossing rate and biparental inbreeding using six
   microsatellite loci and 172 open-pollinated families throughout the
   flowering period.
   Key Results Flower density increased significantly over most of the 50-d
   flowering season, but was associated with a decline in levels of
   pollinator service by bees, particularly on windy days. Fruit and seed
   set declined over time, especially during the latter third of the
   flowering period. Multilocus estimates of outcrossing rate were obtained
   using two methods (the programs MLTR and BORICE) and both indicated high
   selfing rates of similar to 80 \%. There was evidence for a significant
   increase in levels of selfing as the flowering season progressed and
   pollinator visitation declined. Biparental inbreeding also declined
   significantly as the flowering season progressed.
   Conclusions Temporal variation in outcrossing rates may be a common
   feature of the mating biology of annual, insect-pollinated plants of
   harsh environments but our study is the first to examine seasonal
   mating-system dynamics in this context. Despite having large flowers and
   showy floral displays, I. sinensis attracted relatively few pollinators.
   Delayed selfing by corolla dragging largely explains the occurrence of
   mixed mating in I. sinensis, and this mode of self-fertilization
   probably functions to promote reproductive assurance when pollinator
   service is limited by windy environmental conditions and competition
   from co-occurring flowering plants.}},

Abstract = {{Competition theory states that multiple species should not be able to
   occupy the same niche indefinitely. Morphologically, similar species are
   expected to be ecologically alike and exhibit little niche
   differentiation, which makes it difficult to explain the co-occurrence
   of cryptic species. Here, we investigated interspecific niche
   differentiation within a complex of cryptic bumblebee species that
   co-occur extensively in the United Kingdom. We compared the
   interspecific variation along different niche dimensions, to determine
   how they partition a niche to avoid competitive exclusion. We studied
   the species B. cryptarum, B. lucorum, and B. magnus at a single location
   in the northwest of Scotland throughout the flight season. Using
   mitochondrial DNA for species identification, we investigated
   differences in phenology, response to weather variables and forage use.
   We also estimated niche region and niche overlap between different
   castes of the three species. Our results show varying levels of niche
   partitioning between the bumblebee species along three niche dimensions.
   The species had contrasting phenologies: The phenology of B. magnus was
   delayed relative to the other two species, while B. cryptarum had a
   relatively extended phenology, with workers and males more common than
   B. lucorum early and late in the season. We found divergent thermal
   specialisation: In contrast to B. cryptarum and B. magnus, B. lucorum
   worker activity was skewed toward warmer, sunnier conditions, leading to
   interspecific temporal variation. Furthermore, the three species
   differentially exploited the available forage plants: In particular,
   unlike the other two species, B. magnus fed predominantly on species of
   heather. The results suggest that ecological divergence in different
   niche dimensions and spatio-temporal heterogeneity in the environment
   may contribute to the persistence of cryptic species in sympatry.
   Furthermore, our study suggests that cryptic species provide distinct
   and unique ecosystem services, demonstrating that morphological
   similarity does not necessarily equate to ecological equivalence.}},

   During a field experiment, repeated over 2years, we measured the effect
   of increasing plant functional diversity on community structure of
   arthropod visitors, the abundance of multiple pests and induced crop
   damage, and fruit production in two varieties of tomato. Plant resources

   abundance of bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes). However, we only detected
   relatively small variability in arthropod visitors among types of

Abstract = {{Flower visitors often fly among plants of the same species more often

   floral traits, whether flower constancy is associated with perceptual
   stimuli, reward value, and/or flower handling skills has been debated by
   many authors. However, it remains unknown whether flower handling skill
   has a substantial influence on flower constancy because flowers that
   require different handling skills generally also differ in their
   appearance (i.e., shape). We investigated the foraging type constancy of
   Bombus terrestris workers that foraged flower patches consisting of two
   (Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) or three (T. pratense, T.
   repens, and Lotus corniculatus) plant species. In these flower patches,
   individual bees foraged T. pratense flowers by either one of the two
   foraging modes that require different foraging techniques (legitimate
   foraging versus nectar robbing). Behavioral and pollen load analysis
   indicated that bees sometimes switched their foraging types between
   legitimate visits to T. pratense and visits to T. repens and between
   nectar robbing on T. pratense and visits to L. corniculatus, though they
   rarely switched between other combinations of foraging types. These
   results indicate that factors other than perceptual stimuli and spatial
   distribution of plants affected foraging type constancy. After
   considering other factors, such as the rewards and the sizes of

Abstract = {{Exotic plants can alter habitat composition and reduce the diversity of

   fragment surrounded by coffee crops, Coffea arabica L. (Rubiaceae), in
   south-eastern Brazil, the life history of the oil-collecting bee
   Tetrapedia diversipes Klug (Apidae) was studied. Besides providing data
   on the phenology, nesting biology, and natural enemies of this bee
   species, we aimed to investigate if the intense mass flowering of coffee
   trees would attract T. diversipes specimens rather than native plants in
   bloom. As T. diversipes females nest in preexisting cavities, we
   displayed in the study site two types of trapnests: bamboo canes and
   5.8-by 0.6-cm black cardboard tubes. The trap-nests were inspected once
   a month from June 2011 to May 2013 and 494 nests were collected.
   Tetrapedia diversipes is a multivoltine species. Prepupal diapause
   occurred in nests collected at the end of the hot and wet season and
   during the cold and dry season. Nests were attacked by 14 species of
   natural enemies, and the most abundant species were the cuckoo bee
   Coelioxoides waltheriae Ducke (Apidae); the bee fly Anthrax oedipus F.

   (Meloidae). Despite the mass flowering of coffee trees, pollen grains of
   C. arabica were not found in the pollen analysis. Our study reveals that
   even in the presence of an abundant source of floral resources of exotic

Abstract = {{Increasing human land use for agriculture and housing leads to the loss
   of natural habitat and to widespread declines in wild bees. Bee foraging
   dynamics and fitness depend on the availability of resources in the
   surrounding landscape, but how precisely landscape related resource
   differences affect bee foraging patterns remains unclear. To investigate
   how landscape and its interaction with season and weather drive foraging
   and resource intake in social bees, we experimentally compared foraging
   activity, the allocation of foragers to different resources (pollen,
   nectar, and resin) and overall resource intake in the Australian
   stingless bee Tetragonula carbonaria (Apidae, Meliponini). Bee colonies
   were monitored in different seasons over two years. We compared foraging
   patterns and resource intake between the bees' natural habitat (forests)
   and two landscapes differently altered by humans (suburban gardens and
   agricultural macadamia plantations). We found foraging activity as well
   as pollen and nectar forager numbers to be highest in suburban gardens,
   intermediate in forests and low in plantations. Foraging patterns
   further differed between seasons, but seasonal variations strongly
   differed between landscapes. Sugar and pollen intake was low in
   plantations, but contrary with our predictions, it was even higher in
   gardens than in forests. In contrast, resin intake was similar across
   landscapes. Consequently, differences in resource availability between
   natural and altered landscapes strongly affect foraging patterns and
   thus resource intake in social bees. While agricultural monocultures
   largely reduce foraging success, suburban gardens can increase resource
   intake well above rates found in natural habitats of bees, indicating
   that human activities can both decrease and increase the availability of
   resources in a landscape and thus reduce or enhance bee fitness.}},

Abstract = {{1. Plants evolved strategies to attract pollinators that are essential
   for reproduction. However, plant defence against herbivores may trade
   off with pollinator attraction. 2. Here, we investigated the role of
   inducible plant secondary metabolites in such a trade-off. Our objective
   was to reveal the mechanisms underlying the effects of induced plant
   responses to pollination and herbivory. We assessed how responses of
   plants to pollination and insect herbivory affect the behaviour of
   flower visitors. Subsequently, we investigated how the production of
   volatile and non-volatile compounds changes after pollination and
   herbivory. 3. Both herbivores and pollinators induced important
   phenotypic changes in flowers. Brassica nigra plants respond to
   pollination and herbivory with changes in the profile of volatiles and
   non-volatiles of their flowers. Our results show that butterflies use
   different cues when searching for an oviposition site or a nectar
   source. Pollination status influenced the behaviour of butterflies, but
   not that of syrphid flies. 4. We discuss the results in the context of
   the trade-off between defence and reproduction in plants and suggest

Abstract = {{Urbanization and agricultural intensification of landscapes are
   important drivers of global change, which in turn have direct impacts on
   local ecological communities leading to shifts in species distributions
   and interactions. Here, we illustrate how human-altered landscapes, with
   novel ornamental and crop plant communities, result not only in changes
   to local community diversity of floral-dependent species, but also in
   shifts in seasonal abundance of bee pollinators. Three years of data on
   the spatio-temporal distributions of 91 bee species show that seasonal
   patterns of abundance and species richness in human-altered landscapes
   varied significantly less compared to natural habitats in which floral
   resources are relatively scarce in the dry summer months. These findings
   demonstrate that anthropogenic environmental changes in urban and
   agricultural systems, here mediated through changes in plant resources
   and water inputs, can alter the temporal dynamics of pollinators that
   depend on them. Changes in phenology of interactions can be an
   important, though frequently overlooked, mechanism of global change.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Recent studies showed that diverse wild bee assemblages are more
   efficient pollinators than honeybees. In urban ecosystems pollination
   services are also important, for example for the reproduction of many
   plant species in parks, for the production of vegetables and fruits in
   home gardens, as well as other animals depending on bee-pollinated
   plants.
   2. This study investigates the effect of `urbanity' on the abundance,
   species richness and community structure of wild bees foraging at city
   trees and quantifies the contribution of wild bees and honeybees to
   successful pollination. Four common city tree species in Berlin,
   Germany, were sampled in three parks defined as ` green spaces' and
   compared with trees in more ` urban areas'.
   3. In total, 57 wild bee species foraged at the observed trees
   representing 19 \% of all known species in Berlin. Wild bee species
   richness showed only small differences between green spaces and urban
   areas even though social species were found more frequently in green
   areas. Wild bees visited flowers more frequently in green areas, whereas
   the numbers of honeybee flower visits were higher in urban areas. Wild
   bee but not honeybee flower visits showed a positive relationship with
   the reproductive success of trees.
   4. The results suggest that wild bees are important pollinators of city
   trees that dominate the pollinator community in green spaces. To support
   wild bee communities green spaces should be preserved and tree species
   with floral reward should be planted and preserved in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{1. Climate change and deforestation are suggested to be the main drivers
   of decline in pollinators. Forest-dependent species are expected to be
   the most affected and Euglossa marianae Nemesio (Hymenoptera: Apidae),
   an endemic species of the highly fragmented Brazilian Atlantic Forest
   (AF), is believed to be declining as a consequence of human impact.
   2. Over the last 17 years, we carried out field surveys to unveil its
   distribution, allowing us to investigate the potential effects of global
   climate change on this species, from the last glacial maximum into the
   future, using species distribution models. Our main goals were to: (i)
   identify populations potentially under risk of extinction given future
   climate change; (ii) quantify the amount of climatically suitable and
   climatically stable areas for E. marianae within AF; (iii) evaluate the
   area that are available as natural habitat and under legal protection,
   in an attempt to indicate priority areas to preserve this species.
   3. The most stable areas for maintaining populations of E. marianae were
   located in southern Bahia and northern Espirito Santo states, a region
   severely affected by deforestation and with several protected areas.
   Climate change per se does not seem to be the major problem for E.
   marianae. It may constitute an indirect problem given the limited
   dispersal abilities of this species, however.
   4. Climatically suitable areas will probably increase southwards in the
   future, but the extreme fragmentation of AF adds great uncertainty as to
   whether the species will disperse southwards, to regions such as the
   `Serra do Mar' in northeastern Sao Paulo.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees demonstrate an extensive capacity for learning complex motor
   skills to maximise exploitation of floral rewards. This ability is well
   studied in nectar collection but its role in pollen foraging is less
   well understood. Floral sonication is used by bees to extract pollen
   from some plant species with anthers which must be vibrated (buzzed) to
   release pollen. Pollen removal is determined by sonication
   characteristics including frequency and amplitude, and thus the ability
   to optimise sonication should allow bees to maximise the pollen
   collection. We investigated the ability of the buff-tailed bumblebee
   (Bombus terrestris) to modify the frequency and amplitude of their
   buzzes with increasing experience manipulating flowers of the
   buzz-pollinated plant Solanum rostratum. We analysed flight and feeding
   vibrations generated by na < ve workers across feeding bouts. Feeding
   buzzes were of a higher frequency and a lower amplitude than flight
   buzzes. Both flight and feeding buzzes had reduced amplitudes with
   increasing number of foraging trips. However, the frequency of their
   feeding buzzes was reduced significantly more than their flight buzzes
   as bumblebee workers gained experience manipulating flowers. These
   results suggest that bumblebees are able to modify the characteristics
   of their buzzes with experience manipulating buzz-pollinated flowers. We
   discuss our findings in the context of bumblebee learning, and the
   current understanding of the optimal sonication characteristics for
   releasing pollen in buzz-pollinated species. Our results present a
   tantalising insight into the potential role of learning in floral
   sonication, paving the way for future research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Flower color patterns have long served as a model for developmental
   genetics because pigment phenotypes are visually striking, yet generally
   not required for plant viability, facilitating the genetic analysis of
   color and pattern mutants. The evolution of novel flower colors and
   patterns has played a key role in the adaptive radiation of flowering
   plants via their specialized interactions with different pollinator
   guilds (e.g., bees, butterflies, birds), motivating the search for
   allelic differences affecting flower color pattern in closely related
   plant species with different pollinators. We have identified LIGHT
   AREAS1 (LAR1), encoding an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, as the causal
   gene underlying the spatial pattern variation of floral anthocyanin
   pigmentation between two sister species of monkeyflower: the
   bumblebee-pollinated Mimulus lewisii and the hummingbird-pollinated
   Mimulus cardinalis. We demonstrated that LAR1 positively regulates
   FLAVONOL SYNTHASE (FLS), essentially eliminating anthocyanin
   biosynthesis in the white region (i.e., light areas) around the corolla
   throat of M. lewisii flowers by diverting dihydroflavonol into flavonol
   biosynthesis from the anthocyanin pigment pathway. FLS is preferentially
   expressed in the light areas of the M. lewisii flower, thus
   prepatterning the corolla. LAR1 expression in M. cardinalis flowers is
   much lower than in M. lewisii, explaining the unpatterned phenotype and
   recessive inheritance of the M. cardinalis allele. Furthermore, our
   gene-expression analysis and genetic mapping results suggest that
   cis-regulatory change at the LAR1 gene played a critical role in the
   evolution of different pigmentation patterns between the two species.}},

Abstract = {{Leafcutting bees (Megachile: Megachilidae) cut leaves from various
   trees, shrubs, wildflowers and grasses to partition and encase brood
   cells in hollow plant stems, decaying logs or in the ground. The
   identification of preferred plant species via morphological characters
   of the leaf fragments is challenging and direct observation of bees
   cutting leaves from certain plant species are difficult. As such, data
   are poor on leaf preference of leafcutting bees. In this study, I use
   DNA barcoding of the rcbL and ITS2 regions to identify and compare leaf
   preference of three Megachile bee species widespread in Toronto, Canada.
   Nests were opened and one leaf piece from one cell per nest of the
   native M. pugnata Say (N = 45 leaf pieces), and the introduced M.
   rotundata Fabricius (N = 64) and M. centuncularis (L.) (N = 65) were
   analysed. From 174 individual DNA sequences, 54 plant species were
   identified. Preference by M. rotundata was most diverse (36 leaf
   species, H' = 3.08, phylogenetic diversity (pd)= 2.97), followed by M.
   centuncularis (23 species, H' = 2.38, pd = 1.51) then M. pugnata (18
   species, H' = 1.87, pd = 1.22). Cluster analysis revealed significant
   overlap in leaf choice of M. rotundata and M. centuncularis. There was
   no significant preference for native leaves, and only M. centuncularis
   showed preference for leaves of woody plants over perennials.
   Interestingly, antimicrobial properties were present in all but six
   plants collected; all these were exotic plants and none were collected
   by the native bee, M. pugnata. These missing details in interpreting
   what bees need offers valuable information for conservation by
   accounting for necessary (and potentially limiting) nesting materials.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological impacts of alien species invasion are a major threat to
   global biodiversity. The increasing number of invasion events by alien
   species and the high cost and difficulty of eradicating invasive species
   once established require the development of new methods and tools for
   predicting the most susceptible areas to invasion. Invasive pollinators
   pose serious threats to biodiversity and human activity due to their
   close relationship with many plants (including crop species) and high
   potential competitiveness for resources with native pollinators.
   Although at an early stage of expansion, the bumblebee species Bombus
   terrestris is becoming a representative case of pollinator invasion at a
   global scale, particularly given its high velocity of invasive spread
   and the increasing number of reports of its impacts on native bees and
   crops in many countries. We present here a methodological framework of
   habitat suitability modeling that integrates new approaches for
   detecting habitats that are susceptible to Bombus terrestris invasion at
   a global scale. Our approach did not include reported invaded locations
   in the modeling procedure; instead, those locations were used
   exclusively to evaluate the accuracy of the models in predicting
   suitability over regions already invaded. Moreover, a new and more
   intuitive approach was developed to select the models and evaluate
   different algorithms based on their performance and predictive
   convergence. Finally, we present a comprehensive global map of

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{362}},
Pages = {{205-217}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Some of the most productive taxa for forestry are interspecific F-1
   hybrids grown as exotics in the tropics and subtropics. Attributes of
   resilience, adaptability and vigour which engender the hybrids for wood
   production, may also exacerbate the risk they present from gene flow to
   native species gene pools or to local ecologies as weeds. To determine
   the biological and genetic factors that influence the extent of
   hybridisation, we examine the distribution and genealogy of wildlings
   surrounding plantings of locally-exotic Corymbia torelliana (Section
   Cadageria) near native C. henryi (Section Maculatae) in northern New
   South Wales. Our study showed pre-mating and pre- and post-zygotic
   barriers were incomplete, with in situ generation and natural
   establishment of both F-1 hybrids (n = 3) and advanced generation
   hybrids under the disturbed conditions bordering native forest. As
   hybrids were located on alluvial flats exposed to frost, they also
   likely have an extended ecological range relative to native C. henryi.
   Despite the likely generation of large viable seed crops on F-1 trees at
   the site over many years, establishment success and survival of advanced
   generation hybrids may be low, as only 5 immature and no mature advanced
   generation hybrids were identified. Propagation and genetic analysis of
   a seed crop from one F-1 wildling showed early survival and vigour of
   seedlings in cultivation was high, and that at least for some F-1 in
   some seasons, backcrossing to the recurrent native C henryi parent is
   favoured (60\%), whereas selfing (10\%) and crossing with other F-1
   (30\%) was less frequent. Transport of seed by stingless bees probably
   accounted for long distance dispersal from C torelliana, but this
   mechanism does not appear to supplement gravity-dispersal of seed from
   the F-1. Coupled with other evidence from studies of bee behaviour,
   controlled pollination in Corymbia sp., and long-term fitness in second
   generation eucalypt hybrids, we anticipate gene flow via pollen rather
   than seed will be the greater challenge for managing the risk of
   introgression of C. torelliana ancestry into native species from the
   planted F-1 hybrid. If large sources of F-1 pollen become available to
   compete with native pollen, gene flow will probably be frequent and
   hybrids may establish in disturbed conditions and in habitats beyond the
   ecological range of their native parent. Further study is needed to
   determine the degree to which outbreeding depression and poor survival
   inhibits on-going gene flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change and global warming are important factors driving bee
   decline, but it is largely unknown whether these drivers have resulted
   in changes in the life-history traits of bees. Recent studies have shown
   a stronger population decline of large-than small-bodied bee species,
   suggesting there may have been selective pressure on large, but not on
   small species to become smaller. Here we test this hypothesis by
   analyzing trends in bee body size of 18 Dutch species over a 147-year
   period using specimens from entomological collections. Large-bodied
   female bees shrank significantly faster than small-bodied female bees
   (6.5\% and 0.5\% respectively between 1900 and 2010). Changes in
   temperature during the flight period of bees did not influence the
   size-dependent shrinkage of female bees. Male bees did not shrink
   significantly over the same time period. Our results could imply that
   under conditions of declining habitat quantity and quality it is
   advantageous for individuals to be smaller. The size and sex-dependent
   responses of bees point towards an evolutionary response but genetic
   studies are required to confirm this. The declining body size of the
   large bee species that currently dominate flower visitation of both wild

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1990s, Bombus occidentalis (Green) has declined from being
   one of the most common to one of the rarest bumble bee species in the
   Pacific Northwest of the United States. Although its conservation status
   is unresolved, a petition to list this species as endangered or
   threatened was recently submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   To shed light on the conservation situation and inform the U.S. Fish and
   Wildlife Service decision, we report on the detection and abundance of
   B. occidentalis following bumble bee collection between 2012 and 2014
   across the Pacific Northwest. Collection occurred from the San Juan
   Islands and Olympic peninsula east to northern Idaho and northeastern
   Oregon, excluding the arid region in central Washington. B. occidentalis
   was observed at 23 collection sites out of a total of 234. With the
   exception of three sites on the Olympic peninsula, all of these were in
   the southeastern portion of the collection range.}},

Abstract = {{Camellia changii is an endemic and rare species in China with an
   extremely narrow range. It is an insect-pollinated and self-incompatible
   species. We conducted two types of conservation translocation
   experiments, augmentation and conservation introduction at two sites,
   Ehuangzhang and Tianxin, respectively, using 4-year-old grafted C.
   changii reproductive-size plants. In addition to survival and growth
   rate, we compared reproductive traits including flowering phenology,
   pigment production in flowers, pollinator visiting frequency, and
   reproductive success (flower, fruit and seed productions) for 2 years at
   augmentation and introduction sites. The survival rate of transplanted
   plants was 100 \% after 2 years at both sites. The individuals at the
   augmentation site grew significantly faster than those at the
   introduction site (P < 0.05). Transplanted plants at the augmentation
   site produced 26-28 flowers per plant per year, significantly less than
   did those at the introduction site (35-38 flowers) during the 2-year
   (2013-2014) observation period (P < 0.05). The content of anthocyanin, a
   main pigment in the petal of flowers, at the introduction site was less
   than that at the augmentation site. Compositions of the pollinating
   species of C. changii at both sites were similar, but the
   dominant-pollinating species and their visiting frequency were
   different. Butterflies dominated the augmentation site and bees the
   introduction site. Nevertheless, the annual fruit and seed productions
   of both translocations in 2013 and 2014 were very similar. Our findings
   suggest that C. changii subject to the out-of-range conservation
   introduction did not suffer a decline in reproductive success when
   compared with augmentation. These findings suggest that certain rare and
   endangered plants may have the ability to cope with challenges that are
   brought on by conservation introduction in the face of climate change,
   at least in the short term.}},

Abstract = {{Plants produce an array of secondary metabolites that play important
   ecological roles as anti-herbivore and anti-pathogen defenses. Many
   herbivores experience physiological costs when they consume secondary
   metabolites, yet some also benefit, for example when these chemicals
   confer resistance to parasites and predators. Secondary metabolites are
   often present in nectar and pollen, which is paradoxical given that
   floral rewards are important in the attraction of mutualists rather than
   deterrence of antagonists. Motivated by studies of interactions among
   plants, herbivores, and parasites, as well as research showing that
   secondary metabolites can reduce bee disease, we characterized the
   occurrence of two iridoid glycosides, aucubin and catalpol, in floral
   rewards and other tissues of the bee pollinated plant, Chelone glabra.
   We then experimentally investigated effects of nectar iridoid glycoside
   concentrations on the foraging behavior of bumble bee pollinators
   naturally afflicted by a parasitoid fly and a protozoan intestinal
   parasite, and subsequent effects on an estimate of plant reproduction.
   We found that floral nectar had lower iridoid glycoside concentrations
   than leaves, pollen, and corollas, and that, compared to those plant
   parts, the relative ratio of the two primary iridoid glycosides, aucubin
   and catalpol, was reversed in nectar. Whether bees carried parasitoid
   fly larvae did not affect their response to nectar chemistry; however,
   there was a significant interaction between protozoan parasite infection
   and nectar treatment, with infected bees foraging longer at flowers with
   high compared to low nectar iridoid glycoside concentrations.
   Parasitized bees were also more likely to return to inflorescences with
   high iridoid glycoside nectar. Consequently, flowers in the high iridoid
   glycoside nectar treatment donated significantly more pollen to
   conspecific stigmas than did flowers in the low iridoid glycoside
   treatment, suggesting an increase in male plant fitness. Taken together,
   these results demonstrate that nectar secondary metabolites can mediate
   the behavior of pollinators with subsequent benefits for estimates of
   plant reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Declining bee populations has garnered media attention, which has
   pressured plant retailers to ask or demand the reduction or elimination
   of neonicotinoid insecticide use in greenhouse production. This study
   investigated consumer perspectives on eco-friendly ornamental plant
   production practices in combination with a variety of insect management
   practices. Data from an online study were collected from 1555 Americans
   in May 2015. Over half (55\%), nearly half (48.2\%), and more than 30\%
   of the participants felt that ``bees are not harmed,{''} ``better for
   the environment,{''} or ``plants that attract bees,{''} respectively,
   was a characteristic of bee-friendly insect management practices. The
   latter group erroneously confused bee-friendly insect management
   practices with plants that are a potential food source for bees. When
   asked to rate various insect management plant production practices on a
   five-point Likert scale, consumer mean scores were positive (defined
   here as 3.5 to 5.0) for ``plants grown using bee-friendly insect
   management practices,{''} ``plants grown using insect management
   strategies that are safe for pollinators,{''} ``plants grown using best
   insect management practices to protect pollinators,{''} and ``plants
   grown using insect management practices that leaves no insecticide
   residue on the plant.{''} Plant species accounted for 31.6\% of the
   decision to purchase the plant, followed by price (25.1\%), insect
   management strategy (23.3\%), and eco-friendly practices (20.1\%) that
   was similar to prior published findings. Analyses showed that plants
   labeled as ``grown using bee friendly insect management practices{''}
   were worth \$0.26, \$0.26, \$0.89, and \$1.15 more than plants labeled
   as ``grown in a sustainably produced potting soil/mix,{''} ``grown using
   recycled/recaptured water,{''} ``grown using protective neonicotinoid
   insecticides,{''} and ``grown using traditional insect management
   practices,{''} respectively. In addition, plants labeled as ``grown
   using best insect management practices to protect pollinators{''} were
   worth \$0.10, \$0.10, \$0.73, and \$0.99 more than plants labeled as
   ``grown in a sustainably produced potting soil/mix,{''} ``grown using
   recycled/recaptured water,{''} ``grown using protective neonicotinoid
   insecticides,{''} and ``grown using traditional insect management
   practices,{''} respectively. Thus, selected insect management strategies
   were valued more, on average, than eco-friendly production practices.}},

Abstract = {{Fallows (i.e. fields temporarily taken out of production) provide
   important habitat for flower-visiting insects in intensively cultivated
   agricultural landscapes. Cost-efficiency of fallowing schemes could be
   enhanced through improved understanding of key characteristics of
   fallows and surrounding landscape that determine community composition
   and provide support for species of conservation concern. Impacts of
   fallow characteristics and landscape structure on the species
   composition of butterflies and bumblebees were studied in two types of
   perennial fallows in boreal farmland. To understand species' responses
   to environmental factors from a conservation perspective, community
   composition was examined with respect to two species traits-niche
   breadth and dispersal capacity. Whereas overall species composition of
   butterflies and bumblebees was strongly affected by forest cover in the
   surrounding landscape, the studied species traits were most related to
   fallow type and the cover of perennial grasslands. Habitat breadth of
   butterflies was narrowest in long-term grassland fallows in landscapes
   with high grassland cover. Dispersal capacity of butterflies was also
   lowest in grassland-rich landscapes. Diet breadth of bumblebees was
   narrower in long-term grassland fallows than in short-term fallows. The
   results confirm that the diversity of butterflies and bumblebees can be
   enhanced by establishing and managing fallows both in open and forested
   landscapes. For conservation of habitat specialists and less mobile
   species, retention of long-term fallows in grassland-rich landscapes is
   apparently the best option. The results provide no justification for
   exempting forested regions or farms with high grassland cover from the
   ecological focus area requirement under the European Union's current
   agricultural policy.}},

Abstract = {{When alien pollinator species enter a native community of pollinators in
   which resource partitioning has been established, the pollination
   network between plants and pollinators may be modified through the
   interactions between the pollinators over the use of floral resources.
   We observed the floral-use patterns of native (Bombus hypocrita and B.
   deuteronymus) and alien (B. terrestris) bumblebee species in a coastal
   grassland in northern Japan. We analyzed the factors determining
   resource partitioning patterns. B. hypocrita tended to visit flowers
   with shallow or wide open corollas, such as Rosa rugosa, whereas B.
   deuteronymus visited flowers with complex or deeper corollas, such as
   Lathyrus japonicus. Given the wider floral preference of B. terrestris,
   floral use by the alien bumblebees consistently overlapped with that of
   native bumblebees. The visitation of B. terrestris to R. rugosa flowers
   was positively correlated with that of B. hypocrita. These bumblebee
   species frequently used similar floral resources, in part because of the
   large overlap in the seasonality of their foraging activity. The
   visitation frequency of B. deuteronymus to L. japonicus flowers was
   independent of the visitation frequency of other bumblebee species. The
   major visitation periods of the bumblebees to L. japonicus flowers
   reciprocally differed between B. deuteronymus and B. terrestris,
   suggesting phenological resource partitioning between these species. Our
   study suggests that phenological niche partitioning is more common in
   specialized flowers (L. japonicus) than in generalized flowers (R.

Abstract = {{Recent studies on plant-pollinator networks have focused on explaining
   network structure through linkage rules, including spatio-temporal
   overlap, and phenotypic trait or phylogenetic signal complementarity.
   Few studies, however, have quantified the extent to which functional
   traits affect the probability of plants and pollinators interacting with
   each other. Dirichlet-multinomial (DM) regression is a consumer-resource
   model for the interaction probabilities in a mutualistic network. This
   flexible model accommodates network heterogeneity through random effects
   and overdispersion and can estimate the contribution of species-level
   traits to plant-pollinator interactions. Using artificial networks based
   on linkage rules and neutrality, we evaluate the performance of DM
   regression and explore the model's parameter space. We also analyse an
   empirical network in which the interaction probabilities are modelled by
   species characteristics. Study results show that such random effects
   models can provide good fits to observed data. The characteristics
   pollinators seek in plant species may be better anticipated if species
   interactions are modelled by the functional traits that drive them.}},
