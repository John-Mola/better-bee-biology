Abstract = {{The pollination biology and flower visitors of Lobelia spicata, an
   herbaceous prairie perennial, were examined, and this species was found
   to be xenogamous, self-compatible, and gynodioecious. Hermaphroditic
   individuals are protandrous, produce nectar, and have secondary pollen
   presentation (i.e., pump mechanism). Female individuals do not produce
   nectar. No significant differences were found between the fruit set of
   open-pollinated hermaphroditic and female flowers. In hermaphroditic
   bagged flowers seeds were produced (i.e., undeveloped fruits) suggesting
   self-pollination; however, this was determined to be the result of
   geitonogamous pollination by thrips. Autogamy is not likely in this
   species because there is no overlap between the staminate and pistillate
   phases. This species is pollinated mainly by bees from the genus
   Augochlorella. Overall, this study shows that L. spicata shares many
   common characteristics with other species of Lobelia (i.e., L.
   cardinalis and L. siphilitica) such as protandry, self-compatibility, no
   autonomous self-pollination, similar flower phenology (i.e., pistillate
   and staminate phases), and secondary pollen presentation (i.e., pump
   mechanism). In contrast to these other species, L. spicata blooms early,
   has smaller flowers, and attracts smaller pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Most hermaphroditic, many-flowered plants should Suffer reduced fitness
   from within-plant selfing (geitonogamy). Large inflorescences are most
   attractive to pollinators, but also promote many flower visits during a
   single plant visit, which may increase selfing and decrease pollen
   export. A plant might avoid the negative consequences of attractiveness
   through modification of the floral display to promote fewer flower
   visits, while retaining attractiveness. This report shows that
   increasing only the variance in nectar volume per flower results in
   fewer flower visits per inflorescence by wild hummingbirds (Selasphorus
   rufus) and captive humble bees (Bombus flavifrons) foraging on
   artificial inflorescences. Inflorescences were either constant (all
   flowers contained the same nectar volume) or variable (half the flowers
   were empty, the other half contained twice as Much nectar as in the
   constant flowers). Both types of inflorescence were simultaneously
   available to foragers. Risk-averse foraging behaviour was expressed as a
   patch departure preference: birds and bees visited fewer flowers on
   variable inflorescences, and this preference was expressed when resource
   variability could be determined only by concurrent sampling. When
   variance treatments were clearly labelled with colour and offered to
   hummingbirds, the departure effect was maintained however, when
   preference was measured by inflorescence choice, birds did not
   consistently prefer to visit constant inflorescences. The reduced
   visitation lengths on variable inflorescences by both birds and bees
   documented in this study imply that variance in nectar production rates
   within inflorescences may represent an adaptive trait to avoid the costs
   of geitonogamy.}},

Abstract = {{Penstemon digitalis, a prairie species whose flowers possess a large

   presence and removal in open-pollinated flowers. Staminode removal
   significantly reduced total pollen deposition but had no effect on total
   pollen removal. The second experiment utilized single bee visits to
   assess the interaction between pollinator size and staminode presence on
   the rate of pollen deposition and removal. This experiment indicated
   that staminode removal resulted in fewer pollen grains deposited on
   stigmas and less pollen removed from anthers for both large and small

   pollen grains deposited was greatly reduced for large bees, staminode

Abstract = {{Petrocoptis montsicciana (Caryophyllaceae) is a threatened pre-Pyrenean
   endemic that grows exclusively on caves and walls of limestone. We
   studied its pollination ecology by monitoring phenology and by
   evaluating pollen and nectar production, pollinator activity (frequency
   and behaviour of visitors), quantity and quality of pollination
   services, pollen/ovule ratio, and seed set in response to insect
   exclusion and self-compatibility tests. We also analysed the effect of
   population size on reproductive mechanisms by comparing a large and a
   small population. Flowers of P. montsicciana produced nectar and were
   visited by Hymenoptera (79.7\%), Diptera (11.5\%), and Lepidoptera
   (8.8\%). The most frequent pollinators (60.6\% of total visits) were
   long-tongued bees of the genus Anthophora. Both populations had a
   similar range of pollinators. We found a correlation between the number
   of visited flowers and the number of open flowers per census; 88.7\% of
   pollen grains deposited on the stigmas were conspecific and the main
   competitor was another chasmophyte plant, Antirrhinum molle. Bagged
   flowers set seeds but significantly less so than hand-self-pollinated
   and control flowers. Thus, although self-compatible and self-pollinated,
   entomophilous pollination of R montsicciana is required in order to
   explain c. 10-40\% of total seed set, in accordance with P/O ratio
   estimations. Bagged flowers from the small population set significantly
   more seeds than the large one. Visitation rates were lower in the small
   population, but, unexpectedly, showed higher stigmatic pollen loads and
   similar or higher seed set. These results suggest an increase of
   spontaneous selfing rates in the small population, probably favoured by
   a smaller flower size, which can not only assure reproductive success
   when pollinators are scarce, but also provide additional potential to
   adapt to climatic changes. (C) 2002 The Linnean Society of London.}},

   Hoverflies always visited male flowers and rarely visited female

   Thus, observed non-randomness in flower choice by solitary bees may be
   caused by female > male sexual dimorphism and may increase the chance of

Abstract = {{Most ecological processes and interactions depend on scales much larger
   than a single habitat, and therefore it is important to link spatial
   patterns and ecological processes at a landscape scale. Here, we
   analyzed the effects of landscape context on the distribution of bees
   (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) at multiple spatial scales with respect to the
   following hypotheses: (1) Local abundance and diversity of bees increase
   with increasing proportion of the surrounding seminatural habitats. (2)
   Solitary wild bees, bumble bees, and honey bees respond to landscape
   context at different spatial scales, We selected 15 landscape sectors
   and determined the percentage of seminatural habitats and the diversity
   of habitat types at eight spatial scales (radius 250-3000 m) by field
   inspections and analyses of vegetation maps using two Geographic
   Information Systems. The percentage of seminatural habitats varied
   between 1.4\% and 28\%. In the center of each landscape sector a patch
   of potted flowering plants (four perennial and two annual species) was
   placed in the same habitat type, a grassy field margin adjacent to
   cereal fields. In all, 865 wild bee individuals and 467 honey bees were
   observed and an additional 475 individuals were caught for species

   showed a close positive correlation with the percentage of seminatural

   bees did not respond to landscape context at these scales. In contrast,
   honey bees were correlated with landscape context at large scales. The
   densities of flower-visiting honey bees even increased with decreasing
   proportion of seminatural habitats at a radius of 3000 m. We are not
   aware of any empirical studies showing contrasting foraging patterns
   related to landscape context at different spatial scales. We conclude
   (1) that local landscape destruction affects solitary wild bees more
   than social bees, possibly changing mutualistic plant-pollinator and
   competitive wild bees-honey bees interactions and (2) that only analyses
   of multiple spatial scales may detect the importance of the landscape

Abstract = {{Studies of dichogamy seldom address its possible effects on other floral
   traits. An exception has been work on the apioid umbellifers (Apiaceae,
   subfamily Apioideae), which typically exhibit andromonoecy and both
   intra- and interfloral dichogamy. Several students of apioid umbellifers
   have suggested that variation in proportions of perfect and staminate
   flowers among sequentially blooming inflorescences (umbels) of
   individual plants has evolved in response to dichogamy. Here, we report
   a 2-yr study of dichogamy, pollination, and sex expression in
   Pseudocymopterus montanus, a common wildflower of the Rocky Mountains.
   We recorded floral phenology, determined the timing of pollination,
   collected and identified floral visitors, documented variation in sex
   expression and fecundity within and among plants, and examined possible
   reasons why some perfect flowers did not set fruit. Floral visitors
   included andrenid and halictid bees and anthomyid, muscoid, syrphid, and
   tachinid flies. Autogamy was prevented by strong intrafloral protogyny
   of the perfect flowers, which were pollinated before their anthers
   dehisced. Flowering individuals produced a single primary (terminal)
   umbel, one or two secondary (lateral) umbels, and occasionally a
   tertiary (sublateral) umbel. Umbels of different orders matured
   sequentially, producing multiple cycles of protogyny. Weak interfloral
   protogyny within and among umbels allowed the possibility of
   geitonogamous selfing. All individuals expressed the same pattern of
   variation in sex expression among sequentially blooming umbels. Over
   90\% of flowers in primary umbels were staminate, but the frequency of
   staminate flowers fell to 65\% or less in secondary and tertiary umbels.
   Primary and secondary umbels differed significantly in sex expression,
   even though their prepollination reproductive efforts (floral biomass)
   were the same. We favor the view that this distinctive pattern of
   within-plant sex expression, i.e., decreasing proportions of staminate
   flowers in sequentially blooming umbels, evolved in response to
   protogyny. In apioid umbellifers, protogyny appears to have been derived
   from protandry. The selective forces involved in the derivation of
   protogyny may have included more specialized interactions with
   pollinators and the ability to geitonogamously self-pollinate if
   cross-pollination failed. Sex allocation theory predicts that protogyny
   is a sufficient condition for the evolution of increasing relative
   allocations to female function in sequentially blooming flowers or
   inflorescences. Plants with higher reproductive effort had higher
   absolute allocations to both male and female reproductive functions as
   well as higher relative allocations to female function (higher
   phenotypic femaleness). The more female-biased gender of larger plants
   may result from higher frequencies of geitonogamy in inflorescences with
   more flowers.}},

   flowers are violet, strongly zygomorphic, of gullet type, with a pair of
   posterior pockets. Each pocket contains a patch of oil-producing
   glandular hairs (elaiophore). The flowers were only visited, and
   pollinated, by oil-collecting female bees of the Apidae-Apinae: Centris
   hyptidis and Tapinotaspis spec. nov. 1. These two bees differ
   considerably in size but they share the peculiarity of possessing one
   pair of disproportionately elongate legs suitable to gain access to the
   concealed elaiophores. In C. hyptidis, it is the front pair, whereas in
   T. spec. nov. 1 the mid pair of legs is elongated. T spec. nov. 1
   exhibited two modes of visiting behaviour. Angelonia cornigera is

Abstract = {{Evolutionary key innovations give organisms access to new ecological
   resources and cause rapid, sometimes spectacular adaptive radiation. The
   well known obligate pollination mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths
   is a major model system for studies of coevolution, and it relies on the
   key innovation in the moths of complex tentacles used for pollen
   collecting and active pollination. These structures lack apparent
   homology in other insects, making them a rare example of a novel limb.
   We performed anatomical and behavioral studies to determine their origin
   and found evidence of a remarkably simple mechanism. Morphological
   analyses of the tentacles and adjacent mouthparts in pollinators and
   closely related taxa showed that the tentacle appears abruptly in female
   pollinating yucca moths. Several morphological synapomorphies between
   the galeae, which constitute the characteristic lepidopteran proboscis,
   and the tentacle suggest that the tentacle evolved quickly through
   expression of the genetic template for the galea at an apical growth bud
   on the first segment of the maxillary palp. Behavioral data indicate
   that tentacle and proboscis movements are controlled by a shared
   hydraulic extension mechanism, thus no new mechanism was needed for
   tentacle function. Known developmental paths from other insects can
   explain the origin of this sex-specific key innovation in a few steps.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are valuable pollinators of crops as well as native plants
   but their populations have declined in many parts of western Europe
   during recent decades. Their decline has been greatest in intensively
   managed agricultural areas and associated with the decline in suitable
   forage plants.
   The objective of this study was to compare the abundance and diversity
   of forage plants and bumblebees in agricultural and semi-natural
   habitats in Estonia, where land management for agriculture is less
   intensive than in western Europe. Six localities were surveyed, each by
   two census transects (1000 m long x 2 m wide), one passing through a
   semi-natural habitat and the other through an agricultural habitat.
   Flower abundance and bumblebee visitors to flowers along the transects
   were recorded on 4 days per transect during late July/early August in
   each of 3 years.
   No significant difference in the abundance of either flowering forage
   plants or bumblebees between agricultural and semi-natural habitats was
   found. However, the number of bumblebee species observed in agricultural
   areas was significantly smaller than the number in adjacent semi-natural
   areas. The smaller proportion of preferred forage plants in the
   agricultural habitat was a possible reason for its reduced bumblebee
   species richness. For example, in the agricultural habitat, the annual
   and biennial plants tended to be more common and the hemiparasitic
   Melampyrum nemorosum significantly less common, among the flowers
   visited by bumblebees, than in the semi-natural habitat. The proportion
   of stable micro-habitats, which are not subjected to ploughing and root
   disturbance and therefore allow establishment of highly preferred forage
   plants, rather than the overall quantity of any kinds of refuge areas
   between cultivated lands, may be critical for the species richness of
   bumblebee communities in agro-ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Madagasikaria andersonii is described here as a new genus and species of
   Malpighiaceae from Madagascar. The phylogenetic placement of
   Madagasikaria was estimated by using combined data from ndhF and trnL-F
   chloroplast sequences and phytochrome (PHYC) and ITS nuclear sequences.
   It forms a strongly supported clade with the Malagasy endemic genera
   Rhynchophora and Microsteira. Despite nearly identical floral morphology
   among species in this elude (here called the madagasikarioid clade),
   these genera are easily distinguishable on the basis of their fruits,
   The schizocarpic fruits of Madagasikaria have distinctive mericarps.
   Each mericarp has a lateral wing, which completely encircles the nut,
   and a peculiar dorsal wing, which folds over on itself. The morphology
   of this fruit suggests that the homology of the unusual wing in
   Rhyncnophora is lateral in nature and represents a reduced wing similar
   to the lateral wing in Madagasikaria. Taxa in the madagasikarioid clade
   all appear to be morphologically androdioecious and functionally
   dioecious, producing both staminate and ``bisexual{''} (i.e.,
   functionally carpeliate) individuals. This condition appears to be
   exceedingly rare in flowering plants and has important implications for
   floral evolution within Malpighiaccae. Neotropical Malpighiaceae are
   pollinated by specialized oil-collecting anthophorine bees of the tribe
   Centridini and exhibit highly conserved floral morphology despite
   tremendous diversity in fruit morphology and habit. These oil-collecting
   bees are absent from the paleotropics, where most members of the
   Malpighiaceae lack both the oil glands and the typical floral
   orientation crucial to pollination by neotropical oil-collecting bees.
   The madagasikarioids represent one shift from the neotropical
   pollination syndrome among Old World Malpighiaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the large earth bumblebee, Bombus terrestris (L.), in
   native vegetation were collated to determine the extent to which this
   exotic species has invaded Tasmanian native vegetation during the first
   9 years after its introduction. The range of B. terrestris now
   encompasses all of Tasmania's major vegetation types, altitudes from sea
   level to 1260 m a.s.l., and the entire breadth of annual precipitation
   in the state from more than 3200 mm to less than 600 mm. Observations of
   workers carrying pollen, together with the presence of large numbers of
   bumblebees at many localities across this range indicate that colonies
   are frequently established in native vegetation. Evidence that colonies
   are often successful was obtained from repeated observations of the
   species during more than 1 year at particular sites. Unequivocal
   evidence of colonies was obtained from six National Parks, including
   four of the five in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (WHA).
   Indeed, the species has been present in the WHA for at least as long as
   it has in the city of Hobart, where it was first recorded. In south-
   western Tasmania, evidence of colonies was obtained up to 40 km from
   gardens, 61 km from small towns and 93 km from large towns. Hence,
   contrary to previous suggestions, the species is established in the most
   remote parts of Tasmania and is not dependent on introduced garden
   plants. Given their strong record of invasion, it is likely that B.
   terrestris will form feral populations on the mainland of Australia and
   in many other parts of the world if introduced. Because of their likely
   negative impacts on native animals and plants, and potential to enhance
   seed production in weeds, the spread of bumblebees should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{We examined visiting patterns of pollinators of Betonica officinalis L.
   (Lamiaceae) in experimentally fragmented calcareous grasslands and
   corresponding control plots at two study sites (Movelier and Nenzlingen)
   in the north-western Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments (1.5 x 1.5 m) were
   isolated by a 5-m wide strip of frequently mown vegetation while the
   control plots were situated in the adjacent undisturbed vegetation. The
   most common pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus veteranus (Apidae), visited
   fragments 53.7\% less frequently than control plots. Furthermore, a
   change in foraging behaviour of Bombus veteranus was observed. In
   fragments the bumblebees visited more inflorescences, flew longer total
   visiting distances and the visiting time per patch tended to be higher
   than in control plots. The distribution of angles between arrival and
   departure direction (turning angles) differed from a uniform
   distribution in fragments but not in control plots. The increased
   directionality of bumblebee flight might be due to a decrease in floral
   rewards. Our results show that small-scale habitat fragmentation can
   affect plant pollination at two levels both relevant for plant fitness.
   First, lower visitation rates indicate a limitation of pollinators which
   might result in reduced seed set of the pollinated plant. Second,
   changes in pollinator behaviour might reduce pollen dispersal among
   flowers, increase inbreeding and hence reduce genetic variability in
   populations of this bumblebee pollinated plant. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large flowers often contain larger nectar rewards, and receive more
   pollinator visits, than small flowers. We studied possible behavioral
   mechanisms underlying the formation of flower size preferences in
   bumblebees, using a two-phase laboratory experiment. Experimentally
   naive Bombus terrestris (L.) foraged on artificial flowers that bore
   either a large (3.8 cm diameter) or a small (2.7 cm. diameter) display
   of a uniform color. Only flowers of one display size contained nectar
   rewards. We changed the display color and the locations of large and
   small flowers in the second experimental phase. We recorded the bees'
   choices in both phases. Almost half of the bees (41 \%) made their first
   visit to a small flower. The bees learned to associate display size with
   food reward, and chose rewarding flowers with > 85\% accuracy by the end
   of each experimental phase. Some learning occurred within the bees'
   first three flower visits. Learning of the size-reward association was
   equally good for large and small displays in the first experimental
   phase, but better for small displays in the second phase. Formation of
   size-reward associations followed a similar course in both phases. This
   suggests that the bees did not apply their experience from the first
   learning phase to the new situation of the second phase. Rather, they
   treated each phase of the experiment as an independent learning task.
   Our results suggest that associative learning is involved in the
   formation of preferences for large displays by bees. Moreover, bees that
   had learned to prefer large displays in one foraging situation may not
   transfer this preference to a novel situation that is sufficiently
   different. We propose that this feature of the bees' behavior can select
   for honest advertising in flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Hummingbird flower mites are transported in the nares of hummingbirds
   and may compete with them by ``robbing{''} nectar secreted by the host
   plants. We have shown that Tropicoseius sp. flower mites consume almost
   half the nectar secreted by the long-lived, protandrous flowers of
   Moussonia deppeana (Gesneriaceae) pollinated by Lampornis amethystinus
   (Trochilidae). In this paper, we ask whether mimicking nectar
   consumption of flower mites alters some aspects of hummingbird foraging
   patterns, and. if so. how this affects host plant seed production. We
   observed hummingbirds foraging on (a) plants in which nectar was removed
   from the flowers and there filled with a sugar solution to half the
   volume of nectar simulating nectar consumption by flower mites, and (b)
   plants where nectar was removed and then filled with the sugar solution
   Lip to normal nectar volumes. Flower mites were excluded from both
   groups of plants to control for mite activity. Hummingbirds made fewer
   but longer visits to plants and revisited more the flowers with nectar
   removal than those without the treatment. We then conducted a
   pollination experiment on pistillate flowers using a stuffed L.
   amethystinus hummingbird to evaluate the effect of pollination intensity
   (number of bill insertions into one flower) on seed production. Flowers
   with more insertions produced significantly more seeds than those
   flowers that received fewer insertions. We conclude that the simulation
   of nectar consumption by hummingbird flower mites can influence the
   behavior of the pollinator, and this may positively affect seed
   production.}},

   of spectra of pollinators has allowed to distinguish five groups
   (subcomplexes) of plants characterized by dominance of different groups
   of pollinators: myiophylous (flies from superfamily Muscoidea dominate),
   syrphidophylous, (flies from family Syrphidae dominate), nonspecialized
   melittophylous (Apoidea, mainly bumblebees, dominate), psychophylous
   (butterflies dominate), and cantharophylous (beetles dominate). The
   belonging of plants to concrete subcomplex is determined by the
   morphology of flowers and inflorescences, but in some cases habitat and
   time of blooming are also important. From year to year the composition
   of pollinators of the same plant species varies because of change in
   abundance of different groups of pollinators. However for long term
   these fluctuations are leveled off. External reproductive isolation of
   plants of myiophylous subcomplex is achieved mainly by spatial
   (ecological) and time (defferent time of flowering) isolations. However
   when two species of the same subcomplex grow together and their
   flowering time strongly overlap, there are some distinction in their
   pollinators reducing competition for pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination process in Trigonidium obtusum Lindl. (Epidendroideae:
   Maxillariinae) is documented. The flowers are pollinated by sexually
   excited drones of Plebeia droryana (Meliponinae). When attempting to
   copulate either with sepals or petals, these bees slip on the waxy
   perianth surface and become trapped in the funnel-like flower tube, Bees
   trying to escape from the flowers may instead access the space between
   the column and lip, fixing the pollinarium on their scutellum.
   Pollinarium-bearing bees may pollinate the flowers when repeating the
   above-mentioned steps, leaving pollinia on the concave stigmatic
   surface, thus effecting pollination. Recently removed pollinaria are too
   broad to enter the stigma but they begin to dehydrate and within 40 min
   of removal are small enough to fit the stigmatic cavity. This mechanism
   prevents insect-mediated self-pollination and promotes
   cross-pollination. Preliminary evidence based on experiments with
   cultivated plants suggests that they are self-compatible but that fruit
   set is pollinator-dependent. The data obtained are discussed in a
   phylogenetic context. It is suggested that the pseudocopulatory syndrome
   in Trigonidium could have evolved from rewardless (food advertising)
   ancestors. Pseudocopulation in the context of the long flowering period
   of this orchid species (about 7 months) is understandable since the
   eusocial Plebeia bees produce fertile individuals several times a year.

Abstract = {{1 For 3 years, I examined the effects of fragmentation on pollination of
   an endemic, euglossine bee-pollinated, epiphytic orchid, Catasetum
   viridiflavum, on 10 islands created during the construction of the
   Panama Canal and at five sites in nearby large tracts of mainland
   forest.
   2 I investigated the viability of pollinia over time, availability of
   pollinators and male and female reproductive success (measured as
   removal of pollinaria and fruit set, respectively) at different sites.
   3 Viability of pollinia declined dramatically over time, although some
   remained at least partially viable for up to 60 days. Bees moved between
   trapping stations at different sites within a day, and viable pollen
   therefore could have been transferred between populations.
   4 Although euglossine bees were equally frequent in fragments and
   continuous forest, those recorded on islands were visitors from mainland
   sites, and not island residents.
   5 Neither male nor female reproductive success were significantly
   different between island and mainland forest types in 1997. The higher
   reproductive success in certain sites within both forest types
   throughout the flowering season could not be explained by variation in
   overall population floral display. Larger inflorescences had higher male
   and female reproductive success.
   6 In 2 of 3 years, plants on islands had significantly lower fruit set
   than plants on mainland sites. Female reproductive success differed
   dramatically across years and sites.
   7 The low fruit set in 1996 and 1998 on islands in comparison with
   mainlands, and the observation that bees are not island residents,
   conform with expectations of physical isolation of forest patches. In
   spite of the evidence of fragmentation in this system, patterns of
   pollinator behaviour and of reproductive success suggest significant
   connectedness among sites. This 3-year study shows that a single year
   study may not have highlighted the complexity of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Delphinium barbeyi is a common herbaceous wildflower in montane meadows
   at 2,900 m near the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, and its
   flowers are important nectar resources for bumblebees and hummingbirds.
   During the period 1977-1999 flowering was highly variable in both timing
   (date of first flower ranged from 5 July to 6 August, mean=17 July) and
   abundance (maximum open flowers per 2x2-m plot ranged from 11.3 to
   197.9, mean=82). Time and abundance of flowering are highly correlated
   with the previous winter's snowpack, as measured by the amount of snow
   remaining on the ground on 15 May (range 0-185 cm, mean=67.1). We used
   structural equation modeling to investigate relationships among
   snowpack, first date of bare ground, first date of flowering, number of
   inflorescences produced, and peak number of flowers, all of which arc
   significantly correlated with each other. Snowpack depth on 15 May is a
   significant predictor of the first date of bare ground (R-2=0.872),
   which in turn is a significant predictor of the first date of flowering
   (R-2=0.858); snowpack depth is also significantly correlated with number
   of inflorescences produced (R-2=0.713). Both the number of
   inflorescences and mean date of first flowering are significant
   predictors of flowers produced (but with no residual effect of
   snowpack). Part of the effect of snowpack on flowering may be mediated
   through an increased probability of frost damage in years with lower
   snowpack - the frequency of early-season ``frost events{''} explained a
   significant proportion of the variance in the number of flowers per
   stem. There is significant reduction of flower production in La Nina
   episodes. The variation in number of flowers we have observed is likely
   to affect the pollination, mating system, and demography of the species.
   Through its effect on snowpack, frost events, and their interaction,
   climate change may influence all of these variables.}},

   the Chiricahua Mountains, Arizona. Although elevation affected flowering
   time, it had little effect on the size distribution or taxonomic classes
   of visitors. Hummingbirds visited at all sites and relative visit rates
   of large (7 g) and small (3 g) hummingbirds were similar at each
   elevation, Males of large species visited more commonly than females,
   whereas the reverse was true for small hummingbirds. Halictid bees
   visited commonly at all elevations, but other insects were rare. The
   Survey of visitors revealed no elevation-related patterns that would
   select for differentiation in floral traits. However, flower length and
   correlated traits (distance from nectar chamber to anthers and stigma)
   increased significantly with elevation, with maximum differences of
   15-18\%, indicating a possible advantage of large flower size at higher
   elevations. Flower width and nectar chamber size did not vary
   significantly. Nectar production rate tended to increase with elevation,
   but differences were nonsignificant and overshadowed by wide variation
   among plants at a site.
   Claret CLIP flowers are huge and highly, rewarding compared to sympatric
   hummingbird flowers from other plant families. Flower length and width

Abstract = {{Conostephium (Epacridaceae) has flowers that conform with a
   buzz-pollination syndrome but, unlike most plants with this form of
   pollination, the anthers are hidden within the corolla tube. Vibrations
   generated by bees grasping the apices of the corolla tubes must be
   transferred via short broad filaments to the anthers. The anthers do not
   have pores but each dehisces from the apex by a slit that elongates over
   the time the flowers take to senesce (up to 10 days). This may limit
   self-fertilisation as the stigma is receptive as soon as it appears from
   between the very short corolla lobes, so little pollen is released at
   first but later this would increase as the slit elongates. Visitation by
   pollinators has rarely been seen but several observations of native bees
   (Leioproctus and Lasioglossum) working the flowers are presented. The
   bees visit the nectarless flowers of Conostephium only for pollen and
   must forage at other kinds of flowers to obtain nectar. Pollen tubes
   occurred in the stigmas of most older flowers of C. pendulum, so pollen
   delivery does not seem to limit seed set. Despite this, the species sets
   few fruit. From examination of the taxonomic positions of likely
   buzz-pollinated taxa in the family, it appears that pollination by

   Spiranthinae) was studied in the State of Sao Paulo, south-eastern
   Brazil. This orchid is protandrous and almost fully self-compatible, but
   pollinator-dependent. Thus, pollinators are required for the plants to
   set fruits and seeds. The flowers are pollinated by moths of the family
   Noctuidae. Pollinia are dislodged when the moths probe flowers in the
   male phase. At this stage the stigmatic surface is inaccessible, so that
   the flowers can act only as pollen-donors. Flowers in the female phase
   present their stigmatic surfaces well exposed and dry viscidia; at this
   stage the flowers act as pollen receivers. Pollinarium-bearing moths,
   when visiting a flower in the female phase, will brush the pollinarium
   against the stigmatic surface, thus effecting the pollination.
   Moth-pollination is reported here for the first time for the orchid
   subtribe Spiranthinae. Protandry also occurs in a few additional
   Brazilian Spiranthinae. Based on the evidence presented in this work,
   protandry in Spiranthinae is not necessarily linked to bumblebee
   pollination, as currently accepted. It is suggested that the occurrence

   differences in the physiology of colour recognition between humans and
   bees (and wasps) the findings have to be reconsidered. S hirta shows a
   clear preference to flowers that appear bee-cyan and bee-blue. Flowers
   of Solidago canadensis that appear yellow to humans but green to bees
   were used in habitats where this plant is predominant, or where flowers
   of preferred bee-colours were not available.
   Because of the head morphology and the length of proboscis of S hirta
   the nectar of the flowers has to be easily accessable. Plants with
   composite head-flowers, umbels, false spikes (umbellar) panicles or
   other glomerate aggregated inflorescences are prefered by the species.
   The provided feeding plant spectrum is not combinable with the classical
   concept of pollination syndromes in its narrow sense. The observations
   are being discussed from the background of a multi-dimensional point of
   view of pollinator-flower-relations, whose dynamics are interacted and
   confined through different factors.}},

Abstract = {{Many orchid species are unusual in that they provide no nectar or pollen
   rewards for their pollinators. Absence of reward is expected to have a
   fundamental effect on pollinator visitation patterns. In particular the
   number of flowers visited per inflorescence is expected to be affected
   in both unrewarding and co-flowering rewarding species. We used arrays
   of artificial inflorescences, which could be either rewarding or
   unrewarding and were differentiated by their colour, to test how many
   flowers bumblebees visit in each type of inflorescence. The frequency of
   the two colours was varied, thus modelling the case where different
   frequencies of both an unrewarding and rewarding species were present in
   a patch. We found that bumblebees visited more flowers per rewarding
   inflorescence after they have experienced unrewarding or partially
   emptied rewarding inflorescences. We used these results to simulate
   pollen transfer and thus predict selfing rates on rewarding
   inflorescences. We found these increased when nectar depleted or when
   there was a greater proportion of unrewarding inflorescences in the
   patch. Conversely, we found that the number of flowers bumblebees
   visited on each unrewarding inflorescence did not significantly change
   through experiments. Selfing rates for unrewarding inflorescences were
   predicted to depend principally on the number of these inflorescences
   bumblebees visited rather than on the number of flowers they visit per
   inflorescence. This was because most visitors to orchids are supposed to
   be naive, and pollinators that commence foraging carrying no pollen will
   necessarily self any flower they pollinate on the first inflorescence
   they visit. Thus the average selfing rate is expected to increase as the
   sequence of inflorescences visited decreases in length.}},

Abstract = {{Mating in plants is usually mediated by animals, yet few studies have
   determined whether the mating system of plant populations changes in
   response to variation in the taxonomic composition or to the foraging
   behavior of animal pollinators. Here, I investigate covariation between
   striking geographic variation in pollinator fauna and the mating system
   of a widespread self-compatible wetland plant, Decodon verticillatus.
   Flower visitor surveys in two northern populations from Canada and three
   southern populations from the southeastern United States revealed that
   flowers in northern populations were visited primarily by bumblebees
   (30\%), nonnative honeybees (39\%), and small, apparently ineffective,
   pollinators including wasps, flies, and solitary bees (31\%). In
   contrast, southern populations were visited by butterflies (27\%), large
   native bees (Bombus and Xylocopa; 65\%), and only rarely by honeybees
   (2\%). The frequency of visits to inflorescences was also much higher in
   southern () than in northern populations (1.1/ h). The foraging behavior
   of mean = 3.3/h butterflies may enhance outcrossing by reducing
   geitonogamy, the predominant mode of self-fertilization in northern
   populations. Compared to bees, butterflies moved between inflorescences
   more frequently (64\% vs. 43\% of the time) and flew longer distances
   between inflorescences ( medians = 50 vs. 25 cm). Despite large regional
   differences in visitor composition and movement patterns, multilocus
   estimates of the proportion of outcrossed progeny did not differ between
   five southern populations (; mean +/- SE = 0.75 +/- 0.04 range =
   0.65-0.87) and 10 northern populations (0.72 +/- 0.02; 0.62-0.86).
   Similarly, the fixation index of mature plants did not differ from 0 in
   either northern or southern populations. These results indicate that
   variation in the pollinator fauna, including major geographic shifts in
   the frequency of butterflies versus bees and native versus nonnative
   pollinators, does not greatly affect the mating system of D.
   verticillatus.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in floral display size may enhance fitness by increasing a
   plant's attractiveness to pollinators. Alternatively, a larger display
   may reduce fitness by increasing pollen movement within an individual.
   In dichogamous species the frequency of this geitonogamy also depends on
   floral gender ratio and pollinator response to floral gender and to
   inflorescence architecture. We explored the relationships of floral
   display size and dichogamy to potential geitonogamy in Campanula
   americana, a protandrous herb. We observed pollinators in a natural
   population, in which individuals differed in display size, gender ratio,
   and distance to conspecifics, and in experimental arrays, in which
   individuals differed only in display size. In both settings, bees
   responded to increased floral displays by increasing the number and
   length of foraging bouts. The number of potentially geitonogamous
   visits, those to female-phase flowers after male-phase flowers, also
   increased with display size. In addition, although proportion of flowers
   visited did not increase with the floral display, the proportion of
   geitonogamous visits did. There was no evidence that dichogamy reduced
   the potential for geitonogamy. The ratio of male-to female-phase flowers
   did not affect bee behavior, and bees did not display a gender
   preference. In contrast to other studies, the presentation of
   female-phase flowers below male-phase flowers on reproductive branches
   did not reduce geitonogamy. Variation in floral display size may cause
   the mating system to vary among populations. We found that display size
   varied among 12 populations and that geitonogamy may be infrequent in
   many populations as a result of small display sizes. Finally, within
   populations, the selfing rates of larger biennial C. americana are
   likely to exceed those of smaller annual individuals.}},

Abstract = {{A community study of bees visiting flowers with poricidal anthers was
   made in the subtropical Araucaria forest region of Rio Grande do Sul,
   Brazil. Bees of 79 species, representing about 40\% of the taxa
   occurring at the study site, were collected on 19 species of flowering
   plants with poricidal anthers of the families Melastomataceae and
   Solanaceae. The majority of flower visitors were able to buzz (sonicate)
   to release pollen. Buzzing is thought to be the only mode of pollen
   collection that results in pollination. No oligolectic bee-plant
   relation based on buzz pollination was detected. Most bees were not
   specialized to forage on plants with poricidal anthers. According to the
   abundance of visitors at specific flowers, three major groups of buzz
   pollinators could be distinguished; these were bumble bees, stingless
   bees of the genus Melipona and halictid bees. The pollen sources mainly
   exploited by them differ in flower structure, flowering syndrome and
   forest stratum. Therefore, the structure of the bee community seems to
   be closely related to the composition of the local vegetation. The
   extent to which bees of a species show preference for poricidal flowers,
   however, is more dependent on habitat than on plant taxa. The evolution
   of buzzing behaviour by female bees to maximize pollen harvest may,have
   preceded the appearance of poricidal anthers and the syndrome of buzz
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{By analysing patterns of phenotypic integration and multivariate

   populations of bumblebee-pollinated Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae),
   this paper attempts to test the general hypothesis that pollinators

   correlations between functionally linked floral traits. The five floral
   traits examined exhibited significant phenotypic integration at all
   populations, and both the magnitude and the pattern of integration
   differed widely among populations. Variation in extent and pattern of
   integration was neither distance-dependent nor significantly related to
   between-population variation in taxonomical composition and

   integration were closer to expectations derived from consideration of
   developmental affinities between floral whorls than to expectations
   based on a pollinator-mediated adaptive hypothesis. Taken together,
   results of this study suggest that between-population differences in

   frauds, and in most of them, the deception is not mimetic. These plants

   attractant of naive pollinators. In a field experiment, we studied the
   response of bumblebees and other types of flower visitors to colour
   differences between experimentally paired plants of Dactylorhiza

Abstract = {{The taxonomically poorly known, neotropical genus Clusia (Clusiaceae)
   comprises over 300 species of trees, shrubs and hemiepiphytes. The
   flowers are morphologically highly diverse and offer either nectar,
   pollen or resin as a reward for pollinators. Resin production in flowers
   is a poorly studied phenomenon, known from only five angiosperm genera.
   Variation in sequences of the nuclear ribosomal ITS region was analysed
   cladistically in order to trace the evolution of floral resin production
   in Clusia, and as a first step towards a phylogenctically based
   reclassification of the genus. The most parsimonious trees show that the
   genera Havetia, Havetiopsis, Oedematopus and Quapoya are nested inside
   Clusia. Traditionally, Clusia has been divided into sections based on
   androecial variation, and most of these groups are supported as
   monophyletic based on the ITS data. Sections Retinostemon, Havetia and
   Cochlanthera together form one of very few well-supported suprasectional
   groups. Character optimisation experiments suggest that resiniferous
   flowers have evolved at least three times independently in Clusia, but a
   character-evolution model with a single origin for floral resin is only
   slightly less parsimonious. Clades of resiniferous species are
   morphologically the most diverse, and it is concluded that resin
   production has been a key innovation triggering floral morphological
   diversification. Secondary losses of resin and switches to apomixis seem
   to be correlated with colonisation of habitats and areas where
   resin-collecting bees are less frequent.}},

Abstract = {{Many bumblebee species are declining at a rapid rate in the United
   Kingdom and elsewhere. This is commonly attributed to the decline in
   floral resources that has resulted from an intensification in farming
   practices. Here we assess growth of nests of the bumblebee, Bombus
   terrestris, in habitats providing different levels of floral resources.
   Experimental nests were placed out in conventional farmland, in farmland
   with flower-rich conservation measures and in suburban areas. Nests
   gained weight more quickly and attained a larger final size in suburban
   areas compared to elsewhere. The diversity of pollens gathered by bees
   was highest in suburban areas, and lowest in conventional farmland.
   Nests in suburban areas were also more prone to attack by the specialist
   bumblebee parasite Aphomia sociella, suggesting that this moth is more
   abundant in suburban areas than elsewhere. Overall, our results
   demonstrate that gardens provide a greater density and diversity of
   floral resources than farmland, and probably support larger populations
   of B. terrestris. Contrary to expectation, schemes deployed to enhance
   farmland biodiversity appear to have little measurable impact on nest
   growth of this bumblebee species. We argue that B. terrestris probably
   forage over a larger scale than that on which farms are managed, so that
   nest growth is determined by the management of a large number of
   neighbouring farms, 7 not just that in which the nest is located.}},

   nectar-producing flowers of Pedicularis schistostegia. Our previous
   study (Sugiura et al. 2001) suggested that they form a floral mimicry

   Cypripedium occurred with lower frequency relative to Pedicularis. And
   (3) in a mixed stand of both plants, foraging bumblebees were sometimes
   confused between the mimic and model flowers. The present study
   clarified the system with new evidence. (4) Flower colour of Cypripedium
   and Pedicularis would be similar within the range of a bumblebee's
   visual spectrum. And (5) both species largely overlapped in spatial

Abstract = {{The floral visitors of silky oak, Grevillea robusta A. Cunn. ex R.Br.,
   their foraging behaviour and their effects on fruit-set were studied at
   Malava, western Kenya. Grevillea robusta is a popular tree for farm
   plantings in the eastern and central African highlands. Yield of seed
   has been disappointingly low in some areas and a lack of appropriate
   pollinators has been suggested as a possible cause. Investigations
   involved the monitoring of visitors on active inflorescences, assessment
   of the rewards available to potential pollinators, and exclusion
   experiments to establish the effects of various visitors on fruit-set.
   The flowers are visited mainly by birds and insects. The likely
   pollinators of G. robusta are sunbirds (Nectarinia amethystina, N.
   cyanolaema, N. olivacea, N. superba and N. venusta) and white-eyes
   (Zosterops kikuyuensis and Z. senegalensis). Very little aggressive
   behaviour between birds was recorded. No nocturnal pollinators were
   observed. Nectar was the major floral reward for pollinators, but is
   likely depleted by ants and honey bees, the foraging behaviour of which
   confirmed them to be nectar-robbers. These insects hardly ever touched
   stigmas during their visits. Eighty-nine per cent of bird visits were in
   the morning (07.00-10.00 hours) when nectar volume was highest.
   Inflorescences bagged to exclude birds set no fruits, and unmanipulated
   flowers and flowers bagged with self-pollen set no fruits, indicating a
   self-incompatibility mechanism. Control cross-pollinated flowers
   displayed greatly increased fruit-set (25.1\%) compared with natural
   open-pollination (0.9\%). All these findings confirm the importance of
   cross-pollen transfer to flowers and the necessity of pollinators for
   fruit-set. Effective seed production requires activity of pollinators
   for self-pollen removal and cross-pollen deposition. Seed production
   stands for G. robusta should be established where flowering is prolific
   and bird pollinators are abundant.}},

Abstract = {{Introductions of European honeybees have occurred globally, potentially

   honeybees are now the most frequent visitors to the inflorescences of
   the self-compatible, bird-pollinated Australian shrub Grevillea
   macleayana and may therefore be expected to have altered the mating
   system. To examine the degree to which birds continue to play a role in
   determining the mating system of G. macleayana in this disturbed system,
   we compared outcrossing rates in open-pollinated inflorescences with
   inflorescences from which birds bad been selectively excluded.
   Outcrossing rates were estimated from the microsatellite genotypes of
   over 100 seeds per population in three populations, Outcrossing rates
   (t) in open-pollinated seeds were surprisingly low (0.062-0.225) and did
   not vary significantly among the three populations, Nevertheless,
   outcrossing was significantly lower when birds were excluded (data
   pooled from all populations). Two lines of evidence suggest that there
   are temporal fluctuations in outcrossing rate and hence that birds
   usually have a major effect on the mating system of G. macleayana. First
   at one site, t was substantially lower than estimates from an earlier
   study (0.06 in 1995 cf. 0.85 in 1990). Second, fixation indices based on
   seeds were high in all populations (>0.68), whereas values for the
   established plants (parental generation) were much lower in two of the
   three populations (0.06-0.32). Our findings suggest that honeybee

Abstract = {{We studied variation in flowering phenology, fruit and seed set, and the
   abundance of the pollinators of four species of night-blooming Sonoran
   Desert columnar cacti for up to eight years at one site in Mexico and
   one year at one site in Arizona. We determined how spatiotemporal
   variation in plant-pollinator interactions affects the evolution of
   generalized pollination systems. We conducted pollinator exclusion and
   hand pollination experiments to document annual variability in
   pollinator reliability and to determine whether pollination systems were
   redundant (different species are partially or totally substitutable) or
   complementary (different species have an additive effect on fruit set).
   The cacti we studied included three species with generalized pollination
   systems involving bats, birds, and bees (cardon, Pachycereus pringlei;
   Saguaro, Carnegiea gigantea; and organ pipe, Stenocereus thurberi) and
   one specialized moth-pollinated species (senita, Lophocereus schottii).
   We predicted that the migratory lesser long-nosed bat, Leptonycteris
   curasoae, is a less reliable pollinator than birds and bees, and that
   cacti with generalized pollination systems have more variable flowering
   phenologies than the specialized species.
   Annual time of peak flowering and mean size of flower crops were
   relatively invariant in Saguaro and organ pipe. Time of peak flowering
   in cardon varied by as much as six weeks, and mean flower crop size
   varied threefold over six years. In senita, peak flowering varied by as
   much as 5-8 wk among years. Peak numbers of the nectar bat L. curasoae
   varied among years, and bat density (0.9/ha) was an order of magnitude
   lower than that of cactus-visiting birds at both study sites. The
   abundance of migratory hummingbirds was also highly variable among
   years.
   Pollinator exclusion experiments indicated that bats were major
   pollinators of cardon, whereas diurnal visitors accounted for most fruit
   set in Saguaro (except in 1995 when bats were most important) and organ
   pipe at our Mexican site; honeybees accounted for 64-87\% of diurnal
   fruit set in these species. Annual variation in the contribution to
   fruit set by bats was substantially higher than that of diurnal
   pollinators in Saguaro and organ pipe, but not in cardon. There was
   little geographic variation in the relative importance of nocturnal vs.
   diurnal pollinators in Saguaro and senita, but bats were much more
   important for fruit set in organ pipe in Arizona than in Mexico. We
   generally detected no effect of different pollinators on number of seeds
   per fruit in any species.
   Annual variation in fruit set was lowest in saguaro, the species with
   the most diurnal pollination system, and highest in organ pipe, the
   species with the most generalized pollination system. Fruit set was
   strongly pollen limited only in females of cardon (a trioecious species)
   and in organ pipe (at both sites). The ``missing{''} pollinators in both
   species are likely Leptonycteris bats. The pollination systems of
   saguaro and cardon were partially redundant, whereas that of organ pipe
   was complementary.
   The four species of cactus that we studied occur at the northern
   geographic limits of Mexican columnar cacti where many vertebrate
   pollinators are seasonal migrants. In the Sonoran Desert, variation in
   rainfall and spring temperatures affects timing of flowering and the
   extent of competition between cacti for pollinator visits and causes the
   relative importance of particular pollinators, especially Leptonyeteris
   bats, for fruit set to vary annually. Under such conditions, selection
   has favored generalized pollination systems (as seen in organ pipe) or
   shifts from reliance primarily on nocturnal pollinators (as seen in
   cardon) to reliance primarily on diurnal pollinators (as seen in
   Saguaro). Nonetheless, as exemplified by the senita-senita moth system,
   highly specialized pollination mutualisms can also evolve in this
   habitat in plants that rely on sedentary insects rather than migratory
   bats and birds for pollination.}},

   Facultative agamospermy was found in the parental species. Prezygotic
   and postzygotic reproductive barriers between these taxa were weak.
   Reciprocal hand-pollinations between parental species and with hybrids
   yielded high fruit sets with viable seeds. Evaluations of fruit set,
   seed set, seed germination, and pollen viability were undertaken to
   compare the fitness of the hybrids relative to their parents. The

Abstract = {{The reproductive assurance hypothesis posits that selection favors
   self-pollination in flowering plants where mates and/or pollinators are
   scarce. A corollary is that self-pollinating populations are expected to
   be superior colonizers of mate- and pollinator-scarce environments. The
   California annual Clarkia xantiana includes outcrossing populations
   (ssp. xantiana) and autogamously self-pollinating populations (ssp.
   parviflora). Outcrossing is ancestral, and the subspecies have
   parapatric distributions with a narrow contact zone. We tested aspects
   of the reproductive assurance hypothesis by examining geographic and
   subspecies variation in the densities of mates and pollinators (native
   bees) and the density dependence of pollinator visitation and pollen
   receipt. Plant and flower densities, pollinator density, and pollinator
   visitation rates were lowest in the region of exclusively
   self-pollinating populations. Pollinator assemblages there lacked
   Clarkia-associated pollinator taxa that were common elsewhere.
   Self-pollinating populations in the contact zone generally had densities
   and visitation rates intermediate between allopatric self-pollinating
   populations and outcrossing populations. Visitation rate and pollen
   receipt increased significantly with plant density. These findings
   suggest that selection for reproductive assurance influenced the origin
   of self-pollination and/or that reproductive assurance influenced the
   geographic distribution of self-pollination. Geographic variation in
   pollinator assemblages may have generated variation in the value of
   reproductive assurance.}},

Abstract = {{The `most effective pollinator principle' implies that floral
   characteristics often reflect adaptation to the pollinator that
   transfers the most pollen, through a combination of high rate of
   visitation to flowers and effective deposition of pollen during each
   visit. We looked for the expected positive correlation between quantity
   and quality of visits in lpomopsis aggregata, whose red, tubular flowers
   are considered to be adapted to hummingbirds. Hummingbirds were indeed
   the most common floral visitors in 5 years of observation. However,
   long-tongued bumblebees deposited on average three-times as much
   outcross pollen per visit to virgin flowers, and elicited four-times as
   much seed production, as did hummingbirds. Hence visitors that are
   relatively infrequent, and unexpected given the `pollination syndrome'
   of the plant, can be surprisingly good pollinators. One interpretation
   of this observation is that natural selection favours a specialized
   floral morphology that excludes all but a single type of visitor, but
   that there are constraints on achieving this outcome. An alternative is
   that selection favours some degree of floral generalization, but that
   flowers can retain features that adapt them to a particular type of
   pollinator in spite of this generalization. (C) 2001 Annals of Botany

Abstract = {{Fruit set on seven self-fertile (SF) sweet cherry genotypes from the
   Cornell Sweet Cherry Breeding Program was investigated. The S-alleles of
   all tested genotypes, based on controlled pollination and PCR-based
   S-allele typing analysis were determined to be: S1S4' for Lapins, and
   S3S4' for Stella, Starkrimson, NY 13688, NY 13696, NY 13788 and NY
   13791. Higher fruit set of open-pollinated self-fertile genotypes
   indicated that the additional pollen donor was probably advantageous for
   fruit set in self-fertiles in the preliminary field study. However, no
   statistically significant differences were found between fully and self-
   (half compatible) pollination in caged trees in subsequent years'
   studies. This inconsistency may have been due to shading by cages (for
   self-pollination only) or to differences in bee activity in caged trees
   as compared with open-pollinations made during preliminary studies.
   Additionally, the variation in fruit setting potential was dependent on
   genotype. Spring frost injury reduced fruit setting potential in
   self-fertile sweet cherries but pollen quality was not associated with
   variable fruit set. The results suggest that self-pollination would
   produce optimal fruit set in self-fertile sweet cherry cultivars
   regardless of partial pollen incompatibility. However, a more detailed
   study including fruit setting factors other than spring frost injury and
   varying setting capacity depending on genotypes, would be required for a

Abstract = {{We address how a conflict between pollinator attraction and avoidance of
   flower predation influences the evolution of flower shape in Polemonium
   viscosum. Flower shape in P. viscosum is the product of an isometric
   relationship between genetically correlated (r(A) = 0.70) corolla flare
   and length. Bumblebee pollinators preferentially visit flowers that are
   more flared and have longer tubes, selecting for a funnel-shaped
   corolla. However, flower shape also influences nectar-foraging ants that
   sever the style at its point of attachment to the ovary. Surveys of ant
   damage show that plants having flowers with flared, short corollas are
   most vulnerable to ant predation. Consistent with this result, the ratio
   of corolla length to flare is significantly greater in a krummholz (high
   predation risk) population than in a tundra (low predation risk)
   population. To explicitly test whether the evolution of a better
   defended flower would exact a cost in pollination, we created tubular
   flowers by constricting the corolla during development. Performance of
   tubular flowers and natural controls was compared for defensive and
   attractive functions. In choice trials, ants entered control flowers
   significantly more often than tubular ones, confirming that the
   evolution of tubular flowers would reduce the risk of predation.
   However, in a bumblebee-pollinated population, tubular flowers received
   significantly less pollen and set fewer seeds than controls. A fitness
   model incorporating these data predicts that in the absence of the
   genetic correlation between corolla length and flare, intermittent
   selection for defense could allow tubular flowers to spread in the
   krummholz population. However, in the tundra, where bumblebees account
   for nearly all pollination, the model predicts that tubular flowers
   should always confer a fitness disadvantage.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of pollen dispersal is essential for maximizing

   pollen from trees of a single cultivar ('Idared') throughout two apple
   orchards. In each orchard, the percentage of seeds sired by `Idared' was
   estimated for trees sampled at regular intervals along three transects,
   extending up to 18 rows (86 m) from the closest donor trees. The
   percentage of seed sired by `Idared' pollen ranged from 76\% to 1\% of

   Variation in `Idared' siring success was attributable to the cultivar of
   the fruit-bearing trees as well as their distance to the nearest
   `Idared' tree. Cultivar effects were associated with differences in
   flowering overlap, but not cross-compatibility with the pollenizer.
   Furthermore, flowering overlap was a good predictor of siring success
   only when the flowering times of competing pollenizer cultivars were
   also considered. The implications for orchard design are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Emission of methyl benzoate, one of the most abundant scent compounds of
   bee-pollinated snapdragon flowers, occurs in a rhythmic manner, with
   maximum emission during the day, and coincides with the foraging
   activity of bumblebees. Rhythmic emission of methyl benzoate displays a
   ``free-running{''} cycle in the absence of environmental cues (in
   continuous dark or continuous light), indicating the circadian nature of
   diurnal rhythmicity. Methyl benzoate is produced in upper and lower
   snapdragon petal lobes by enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the
   reaction catalyzed by S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid carboxyl
   methyltransferase (BAMT). When a detailed time-course analysis of BAMT
   activity in upper and lower petal lobes during a 48-hr period was
   performed, high BAMT activity was found at night as well as in
   continuous darkness, indicating that the BAMT activity is not an
   oscillation-determining factor. Analysis of the level of benzoic acid
   during a 24-hr period revealed oscillations in the amount of benzoic
   acid during the daily light/dark cycle that were retained in continuous
   darkness. These data clearly show that the total amount of substrate
   (benzoic acid) in the cell is involved in the regulation of the rhythmic
   emission of methyl benzoate. Our results also suggest that similar
   molecular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of methyl benzoate
   production in diurnally (snapdragon) and nocturnally (tobacco and

Abstract = {{Two sympatric Delphinium species, D. barbeyi and D. nuttallianum, are
   ecologically and morphologically similar. However, D. barbeyi has
   multiple, large inflorescences while D. nuttallianum has a single, small

   greater intraplant pollen transfer in D. barbeyi, leading to higher
   rates of self-pollination through geitonogamy. Reduced gene flow by
   pollen should in turn produce greater population differentiation among
   populations of D. barbeyi relative to D. nuttallianum. We tested these
   predictions by comparing pollinator behavior, breeding systems,
   outcrossing rates, and population genetic structure of sympatric
   populations of the two species in Colorado. Bumble bee and hummingbird
   pollinators visit more flowers and inflorescences per foraging bout in
   D. barbeyi than in D. nuttallianum. The species differed in breeding
   system; D. barbeyi produced more seeds by autogamy (9 vs. 2\%) than D.
   nuttallianum and suffered no reduction in seed set in hand-self vs.
   outcross pollinations, in contrast to a 41\% decline in D. nuttallianum.

Abstract = {{Competition for pollination can be an important factor in plant

   pollination to investigate the effects of pollen from an invasive
   species (Lythrum salicaria) on seed set in a sympatric and co-flowering

   and secondary infection from point sources of ascospores and conidia
   placed in separate plant rows were recorded in each of 2 years at two
   sites with no history of the disease. Primary infection gradients were
   longer downwind than upwind, with 95\% of blighted shoots occurring

   a positive correlation (r = 0.852, P = 0.0072, n = 8) between the
   distance over which shoot blight occurred and wind speed parallel to the
   row, supports the role of wind as a key factor in ascospore dispersal.
   By contrast, secondary infection gradients were shorter downwind and
   longer upwind, with 95\% of infected fruit occurring within 20 in of the
   conidial point source. The shorter downwind spread of secondary
   infection, along with a nonsignificant correlation (r = -0.649, P =

   the transfer of conidia to open flowers; this could include conidial
   dispersal by bee pollinators, which have been shown previously to forage
   primarily upwind. Exponential and Pareto cumulative distribution
   functions were fitted to cumulative counts of blighted shoots and

   changes in flower-visitor behaviour and the contrasting responses of

   However, there are many crops of local economic importance whose yield
   or quality may be enhanced by good pollinator activity: studies of these
   deserve more attention. Amongst those cases already documented,
   intensification and habitat loss are the most frequent causes of
   pollinator impoverishment reducing crop yield. As yet there is no clear
   example of low crop yield resulting from the effect of pesticides or
   transgenic plants on pollinators, and only one example involving
   herbicides, although each of these agents can affect populations of crop
   pollinators. (C) 2001 Annals of Botany Company.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation of the endangered species, Hygrophila pogonocalyx
   Hayata (Acanthaceae), was estimated based on RAPD fingerprints.
   According to the criteria of the International Union for Conservation of
   Nature and Nature Resources, H. pogonocalyx is on the Red List Category
   due to its endangered status. Entomophilous plants of H. pogonocalyx are
   mostly pollinated by honeybees. Gene flow between populations is
   constrained by the migratory capacity of the pollinators. A survey based
   on RAPD fingerprinting using 50 random primers revealed the distribution
   of genetic variation following an ``isolation by distance{''} model. A
   hierarchical AMOVA analyses indicated significant differentiation
   between geographical regions (Phi (ct) = 0.934; P = 0.048), among
   populations (Phi (st) = 0.945; P < 0.001), and among populations within
   region (Phi (sc) = 0.169: P < 0.001). The differentiation between
   geographic populations may be ascribed to a long isolation since the
   formation of the Central Mountain Range 1 million years ago. In contrast
   to low levels of genetic variation in many endangered species, some
   genetic processes avoiding selling may have evolved in H. pogonocalyx.
   Somatic mutation also possibly contributed to the variability
   maintenance within populations with limited size. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Orchidaceae characteristically contain a very large number of
   species that attract pollinators but do not offer them any form of
   reward in return for visitation. Such a strategy is highly unusual in
   the plant kingdom. We conducted experiments in order to manipulate the
   reward strategy of the rewardless bumble-bee-pollinated orchid Barlia
   robertiana by adding sucrose solution to inflorescences. We found that
   supplementation decreased the probability of a pollinator removing
   pollinia by approximately ten times. Despite pollinators visiting many
   more flowers per inflorescence on supplemented plants, right times fewer
   pollinia were removed from supplemented inflorescences during each
   visit. Pollinia deposition patterns were not significantly affected by
   supplementation and no geitonogamous deposition was recorded. In
   populations where inflorescences were supplemented for 20 days, pollinia
   removal was reduced by over half for supplemented inflorescences,
   whereas fruit set was unmodified by supplementation. We conclude that
   rewardlessness would increase total seed paternity, but not change
   either total seed maternity or the probability that offspring were
   outcrossed in this species. To the authors' knowledge this is the first

Abstract = {{Food-deceptive flowers are pollinated by animals that expect a reward
   but are cheated. Such plants profit from their similarity to rewarding
   plants and should develop signals that hinder discrimination. We use
   artificial rewarding model flowers and nonrewarding mimicking flowers
   that present similar visual cues. We test how additional scent cues
   change flower choice of the mimic by bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) in
   two situations: (1) both flower types are simultaneously present and can
   be compared by the pollinator, and (2) both flower types are encountered
   successively in the absence of each other. We find that in situation 1,
   discrimination learning is greater if scents are used as cues for
   identifying the mimic, whether the mimic has a different scent or if it
   is scentless while the model is scented, In situation 2, a
   generalization task, a scented mimic is avoided faster than a scentless
   one. Discrimination of the mimic is poorest if it has the same scent as
   the model, thus demonstrating a potential for scent mimic, which has nor
   yet been proved to exist among differently rewarding flowers. Thus, the
   best strategy for a mimic would be to have the same scent as the model,
   but this strategy may not be used due to evolutionary constraints.
   Alternatively, if there are several potential models, then having no
   scent would be a better strategy than mimicking just one of the models.
   In situation 1 flower discrimination by color cues is enhanced in the
   mere presence of scent, compared to unscented controls, even if the
   scent does not provide a distinguishable cue itself. The results
   indicate that the presence of scent may enhance color discrimination by
   improving attention towards visual cues and/or that combined color/odor
   cues may lead to better memory formation and retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Floral development, structure, and pollination biology of species of

   primordia. This contrasts with monandrous orchids, in which the median
   petal primordium is the first organ of the inner perianth whorl to
   develop. Stamens are only formed on the abaxial side of the flower.
   However, in Neuwiedia veratrifolia and Apostasia nuda, vestiges of
   stamen primordia are present on the adaxial side of the flower. In
   Apostasia only, the lateral stamens are fully developed, whereas the
   median organ is a staminode; in A. nuda the staminode is suppressed. At
   anthesis the anthers are free in Neuwiedia, but they are postgenitally
   connected in Apostasia. In both genera, stamens and style are
   congenitally fused at the base. The inferior ovary is at first
   unilocular and then becomes trilocular by postgenital fusion of the
   ovary septa and the development of a short synascidiate zone. The three
   carpels of both genera are equal from the beginning, but in A. nuda
   only, the median carpel dominates during early development. The stigma
   is convex and papillate. Conspicuous raphide idioblast accumulations
   occur in staminode and style and in the tips of anthers and filaments.
   In contrast to all other orchids, both genera offer pollen as a reward.
   Neuwiedia has lip flowers, which are pollinated by Trigona bees;
   Apostasia has ``Solanum-type{''} flowers with recurved perianth and
   united anthers. Our study supports the view that Apostasia and Neuwiedia
   are closely related and that Apostasioideae are at the base of the

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet is an important component of the photic environment. It is
   used by a wide variety of animals and plants in mutualistic
   communication, especially in insect and flower inter-relationships.
   Ultraviolet reflections and sensitivity are also becoming well
   considered in the relationships between vertebrates and their
   environment. The relative importance of ultraviolet vis a vis other
   primary colours in trichromatic or tetrachromatic colour spaces is
   discussed, and it is concluded that ultraviolet is, in most cases, no
   more important that blue, green or red reflections. Some animals may use
   specific wavebands of light for specific reactions, such as ultraviolet
   in escape or in the detection of polarised light, and other wavebands in
   stimulating feeding, oviposition or mating. When colour vision and,
   thus, the input from more than a single spectral receptor type are
   concerned, we point out that even basic predictions of signal
   conspicuousness require knowledge of the neuronal wiring used to
   evaluate the signals from all receptor types, including the ultraviolet.
   Evolutionary analyses suggest that, at least in arthropods, ultraviolet
   sensitivity is phylogenetically ancient and undergoes comparatively
   little evolutionary fine-tuning. Increasing amounts of ultraviolet in
   the photic environment, as caused by the decline of ozone in the
   atmosphere, are not likely to affect colour vision. However, a case for
   which ultraviolet is possibly unique is in the colour constancy of bees.
   Theoretical models predict that bees will perform poorly at identifying
   pure ultraviolet signals under conditions of changing illumination,
   which may explain the near absence of pure ultraviolet-reflecting
   flowers in nature.}},

   period from December to April. Male flowers appear first, thereafter
   female and male flowers appear together. Flower lifetime (9 h) was

   This is a self-compatible plant. Fruit and seed set and fruit traits
   (total mass, width and length of fruits, number of seeds per fruit, and

Abstract = {{The benzenoid ester, methylbenzoate is one of the most abundant scent

   varieties. It is produced. in upper and lower lobes of petals by
   enzymatic methylation of benzoic acid in the reaction catalyzed by
   S-adenosyl-L-methionine :benzoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (BAMT).
   To identify the location of methylbenzoate biosynthesis, we conducted an
   extensive immunolocalization study by Light and electron microscopy at
   cellular and subcellular levels using antibodies against BAMT protein.
   BAMT was immunolocalized predominantly in the conical cells of the inner
   epidermal layer and, to a much lesser extent, in the cells of the outer
   epidermis of snapdragon flower petal lobes. It was also located in the
   inner epidermis of the corolla tube with little BAMT protein detected in
   the outer epidermis and in the yellow hairs within the tube on the bee's
   way to the nectar. These results strongly suggest that scent
   biosynthetic genes are expressed almost exclusively in the epidermal
   cells of floral organs. Immunogold labeling studies reveal that BAMT is
   a cytosolic enzyme, suggesting cytosolic location of methylbenzoate
   biosynthesis. The concentration of scent production on flower surfaces

   National Park, Malawi. Mammals and birds were censused simultaneously

   woodland, with and without targets. Mammals were also monitored by
   surveys of their spoor on experimentally cleared plots (5 m in diameter)
   and a target relocation experiment was conducted when the targets were
   removed from the test transects and transferred to the controls.
   Significantly fewer small antelopes (e.g. common Duiker Sylvicapra
   grimmia) were detected in plots along transects with targets (tests)
   than along control transects. The presence of targets affected the
   frequency of occurrence of antelopes, suids and large herbivores in the

   were unaffected. A conclusion of the relocation experiment was that the
   deltamethrin-impregnated cloth was responsible for the observed effects
   and not the acetone. A total number of 23 species of birds meeting a
   criterion for their abundance in the areas surveyed were selected for

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of four species of passionflower was studied in
   south-eastern Brazil, specifically the importance of chemical features
   of floral nectar, pigments and odours. All species required pollinators
   to produce fruits: P. alata was pollinated by bees, P. speciosa by
   hummingbirds, and P. gabbana and P. mucronata by bats. Pollinators
   consumed nectar as a food source. The activity of vertebrate pollinators
   reflected resource availability: they foraged when large amounts of
   nectar were available and when quantitative resource predictability was
   greater. The nectar of the vertebrate-pollinated species was richer in
   cholesterol and phospholipids, and had a potassium-sodium ratio higher
   than 1.0. For all species, the light absorption of flowers was
   paralleled by the pollinators' visual spectral sensitivity. This first
   report on Passiflora floral volatile compounds showed that there was a
   greater chemical class diversity among the species pollinated by animals
   with an acute olfactory sense, such as bees and bats. Benzenoid alcohols
   were the most represented compounds. The fragrances contained compounds

Abstract = {{Nectar robbers are animals that extract the nectar produced by plants
   without effecting pollination. These animals can have negative,
   positive, or neutral effects on the interaction, depending on the direct
   and indirect effects of each participant in the system. The purpose of
   this work was to analyze the prevalence of nectar robbing and its
   temporal dynamics in a tropical highland forest in western Mexico. The
   system was studied in terms of the seasonal changes in (i) specific
   composition and abundance of hummingbird pollinators, their hosts, and
   the nectar robbers, (ii) use of resources by the nectarivorous birds and
   flowers, and (iii) prevalence of flower piercing by the cinnamon
   flowerpiercer, Diglossa baritula. The guild consisted of 17 species of
   hummingbirds, 2 species of nectar robbers, and 21 plant species that
   were visited by nectarivorous birds (robbers and pollinators). The
   relative abundance of birds and available flowers showed two peaks, one
   in winter and the other in the rainy season. Some plant species were
   used more than expected from their abundance. Overlap in the use of
   flowers among hummingbirds and also between hummingbirds and the nectar
   robbers was high. Nectar robbing was found to be widespread, occurring
   in almost all of the plants known to be hummingbird pollinated. The
   ratio of hummingbirds to nectar robbers was around 10 throughout the
   year.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{art. no.-3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Few studies directly address the consequences of habitat fragmentation
   for communities of pollinating insects, particularly for the key
   pollinator group, bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes). Bees typically live in
   habitats where nesting substrates and bloom are patchily distributed and
   spatially dissociated. Bee studies have all defined habitat fragments as
   remnant patches of floral hosts or forests, overlooking the nesting
   needs of bees. Several authors conclude that habitat fragmentation is
   broadly deleterious, but their own data show that some native species
   proliferate in sampled fragments. Other studies report greater densities
   and comparable diversities of native bees at flowers in some fragment
   size classes relative to undisrupted habitats, but find dramatic shifts
   in species composition.
   Insightful studies of habitat fragmentation and bees will consider
   fragmentation, alteration, and loss of nesting habitats, not just
   patches of forage plants, as well as the permeability of the surrounding
   matrix to interpatch movement. Inasmuch as the floral associations and
   nesting habits of bees are often attributes of species or subgenera,
   ecological interpretations hinge on authoritative identifications. Study
   designs must accommodate statistical problems associated with bee
   community samples, especially non-normal data and frequent zero values.
   The spatial scale of fragmentation must be appreciated: bees of medium
   body size can regularly fly 1-2 km from nest site to forage patch.
   Overall, evidence for prolonged persistence of substantial diversity and
   abundances of native bee communities in habitat fragments of modest size
   promises practical solutions for maintaining bee populations. Provided
   that reserve selection, design, and management can address the foraging
   and nesting needs of bees, networks of even small reserves may hold hope
   for sustaining considerable pollinator diversity and the ecological
   services pollinators provide.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem health and agricultural wealth in North America depend on a
   particular invertebrate fauna to deliver pollination services. Extensive
   losses in pollinator guilds and communities can disrupt ecosystem
   integrity, a circumstance that today forces most farmers to rely on
   honey bees for much fruit and seed production. Are North America's
   invertebrate pollinator faunas already widely diminished or currently
   threatened by human activities? How would we know, what are the
   spatiotemporal scales for detection, and which anthropogenic factors are
   responsible? Answers to these questions were considered by participants
   in a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Ecological Analysis
   and Synthesis in October of 1999, and these questions form the nucleus
   for the papers in this special issue. Several contributors critically
   interpret the evidence for declines of bee and fly pollinators, the
   pollination deficits that should ensue, and their economic costs.
   Spatiotemporal unruliness in pollinator numbers, particularly bees, is
   shown to hinder our current insights, highlighting the need for refined
   survey and sampling designs. At the same time, two remarkable studies
   clearly show the long-term persistence of members of complex bee
   communities. Other authors offer new perspectives on habitat
   fragmentation and global warming as drivers of pollinator declines. Bees
   and lepidopterans are contrasted in terms of their natural genetic
   variation and their consequent resilience in the face of population
   declines. Overall, many ecologists and conservation biologists have not
   fully appreciated the daunting challenges that accompany sampling
   designs, taxonomy, and the natural history of bees, flies, and other
   invertebrate pollinators, a circumstance that must be remedied if we are
   to reliably monitor invertebrate pollinator populations and respond to
   their declines with effective conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Since agricultural activities were first recorded, there have been
   shortages of pollinators. Today it seems that pollination systems in
   many areas of agriculture are threatened by the inadequacy or lack of
   sustainable managed, indigenous, or imported pollinators. Pollinator
   shortages can adversely affect crop production and commodity markets.
   This paper presents an economic model than can be used. to measure some
   of the economic impacts of pollinator deficits on traded commodities.
   This economic analysis indicates that consumers of a commodity affected
   by a pollinator deficit may suffer because the commodity costs more and
   becomes less available. At the same time, although the producers of the
   affected commodity may experience crop declines, they may also
   experience economic gains in the form of higher prices. The amount the
   producer gains or loses depends on the shape of the supply and demand
   functions, and the magnitude of these losses or gains is an empirical
   question. Although there are few data available to evaluate this model,
   those we do have indicate that serious problems for world food supply,
   security, and trade could be in the offing if current declines in
   pollinator abundance, diversity, and availability are not reversed.
   Various crops and cropping systems are suggested as practical starting
   places for economic studies of the effects of pollinator declines, with
   emphasis on the type of data required.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in flower-visiting insect populations or communities that result
   from human impacts can be documented by measuring spatial or temporal
   trends, or by comparing abundance or species composition before and
   after disturbance. The level of naturally occurring variation in
   populations and communities over space and time will dictate the
   sampling effort required to detect human-induced changes. We compiled a
   set of existing surveys of the bee faunas of natural communities from
   around the world to examine patterns of abundance and richness. We
   focused on a subset of these studies to illustrate variation in bee
   communities among different sites and within sites over different
   spatial and temporal scales. We used examples from our compilation and
   other published studies to illustrate sampling approaches that maximize
   the value of future sampling efforts. Existing studies suggest that bee
   faunas are locally diverse, highly variable in space and time, and often
   rich in rare species. All of these attributes indicate that intense
   sampling among sites and years will be required to differentiate changes
   due to specific impacts from the natural dynamics of populations and
   communities. Given the limits on time and funding for studying bees,
   approaches that maximize information for effort must be sought for
   future studies. Reliable information on population and community changes
   may be gleaned from examining ``functional groups{''} rather than entire
   faunas. Regardless of the purpose of the study, standardized sampling
   protocols using replicated designs will increase the value of data.
   Standardization permits statistical testing of changes in bee

Abstract = {{Many spiders, and in particular those in the genus Argiope, spin highly
   visible web decorations whose function and significance are the subject
   of spirited debate. In this work, we present data to address two of the
   competing hypotheses that fuel this controversy. In particular, we
   examine the relationship between the presence of web decorations and
   spider survivorship (predator-protection hypothesis) and the
   relationship between the presence of prey and spider decorating behavior
   (the prey-attraction hypothesis). Our laboratory studies reveal that the
   decorating behavior of the spider A. argentata has a genetic component
   hut that the expression elf decorating behavior tends to be elicited
   only when a spider is well fed. Furthermore, our field studies show
   th;lt in the presence of abundant stingless bees, spider decorating
   behavior is induced. Nevertheless, our field surveys also suggest that
   spiders that decorate their webs show reduced survivorship. We propose
   that the high correlation between web decorating in the presence of
   stingless bees supports the hypothesis that A. argentata engage in
   decorating behavior when attracting or targeting specific prey types.
   However, we also propose that web decorations attract the: predators of
   A. argentata because high-frequency decorators suffer lower survivorship
   than spiders that decorate moderately or rarely. These findings suggest
   that spider web decorating behavior is affected by conflicting selection
   pressures: the positive effect of prey attraction versus the negative
   effect of predator attraction. Due to the heritable component of
   decorating behavior, web decorating among A. argentata is likely to be
   particularly sensitive to the spider's local ecology as well as local
   patterns of gene flow.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of most high-density orchards of apple (Malus x
   domestica Borkh.) into single-cultivar rows is often viewed as an
   impediment to effective pollen dispersal and pollination; however, few
   direct estimates of pollen dispersal are available to assess the extent
   of this problem. We estimated the magnitude of pollen dispersal across
   rows (pollinator cultivars: Idared, Vista Bella, Granny Smith), and
   along rows, (pollinator cultivars Fuji, Paulared, Golden Russet), in two
   high-density orchards in Ontario, Canada. Fruit were sampled from trees
   at regular intervals along transects that extended beyond (either across
   or along row) each pollinator cultivar and the percentage of seeds that
   were sired by the pollen donor was estimated using allozyme markers.
   Seeds sired by the pollinator cultivar were found from seven ('Granny
   Smith') to 18 rows ('Idared') from the nearest pollinator tree and from
   seven ('Fuji', `Paulared') to five trees ('Granny Smith') down the same
   row. Measured in metres, the maximum pollen dispersal distance was
   greater across rows (62.4 m) than along rows (13.7 m). However, the
   average dispersal distance across rows, expressed in metres or trees,
   (17.4 m +/- 3.6, 3.6 +/- 0.7 trees) did not differ from that along rows
   (5.8 m +/- 4.1, 2.7 +/- 0.8 trees). These results are at odds with
   previous studies that indicate that honeybees move farther along rows
   than across, and have important implications for the design of

Abstract = {{The main objective of this investigation was to study the pollination
   characteristics of two types of Amazonian rain forest at plant community
   level. Seasonally inundated forest was compared with upland (tierra
   firme) forest. The study focused on plant species in the canopy. The
   pollination spectra show that in both forests most canopy trees and
   lianas are pollinated by small bees, large bees, butterflies or by
   small, relatively unspecialized insects. In the upland forest small bees
   are the most important pollinators (32\% of all species of trees and
   lianas are pollinated by them), whereas large bees are predominant in
   the floodplain (22\%). Other pollinators, like hummingbirds, bats,
   moths, and beetles are less common (< 10\%), but always somewhat more
   important in the flood plain than in the upland forest. Bees are the
   most common pollinators of epiphytes. In the flood plain forest, flies
   are also important as epiphyte pollinators (19\%), whereas in the upland
   forest hummingbirds pollinate more epiphytes. The phenological patterns
   are quite similar in both the upland and the flood plain. We found a
   peak in flowering in the transition period between the wet and the dry
   season. Flowering activity was lowest during the wet season.
   Differentiation in sexual systems was correlated with life form. Dioecy
   and monoecy were found mostly among tree species. Most species of all
   life forms though were hermaphroditic. No difference with respect to the
   relative importance of sexual systems was found between the two forest
   types.}},

Abstract = {{Invertebrates mediate several important ecological processes, including
   pollination and seed predation, and events that affect invertebrate
   diversity or behaviour can potentially disrupt forest regeneration
   processes. This study investigates the impact of logging in Thailand and
   forest fragmentation in Costa Rica on the pollination and seed
   production of two self-incompatible forest trees. Logging in a dry
   deciduous dipterocarp forest in Thailand resulted in reduced densities
   of the common dipterocarp tree Shorea siamensis and variably isolated
   individual trees. The number of flower visits to S. siamensis by
   pollinating Trigona bees was not affected by logging disturbance.
   However, pollinators did spend longer periods of time foraging in the
   canopies of isolated trees which were more prevalent in logged areas
   where tree density had been reduced. Consequently, at the logged site
   few cross-pollinations were effected and fruit set of S. siamensis was
   considerably lower than at nearby unlogged sites where distances between
   flowering conspecifics were smaller. Reduced fruit set has long-term
   implications for the recovery of S. siamensis populations in disturbed
   areas, and local population genetic structure is likely to be affected
   as reduced outcrossing rates among trees in disturbed regions results in
   relatively inbred seed. In Costa Rica forest fragmentation has
   restricted the once widespread tree Anacardium excelsum to forest
   patches located in an agriculturally-dominated landscape. As with S.
   siamensis, the abundance of pollinators, also Trigona bees, in the
   canopies of A. excelsum was largely unaffected by fragment size.
   Nevertheless, pollination success and seed production was positively
   correlated with fragment size. We propose that small bees rarely move
   between forest fragments and gene exchange through pollination occurs
   predominantly among trees within fragments and, together with likely low
   genetic variability in small fragments, that this contributes to the
   observed reduced fertilisation and seed set of A. excelsum. Thus
   increased tree isolation tree through selective logging or habitat
   fragmentation by forest clearance can result in reduced seed set due to
   changes in the foraging patterns of poorly mobile pollinators. Even if
   population sizes of the pollinators are maintained following
   environmental perturbation, this study shows that disturbance may
   disrupt pollination processes through changes in pollinator foraging
   behaviour. More attention needs to be focussed on changes in the
   behaviour of species involved in key ecological interactions following
   disturbance events in tropical forests.}},

Abstract = {{In optimal foraging theory, search time is a key variable defining the
   value of a prey type. But the sensory-perceptual processes that
   constrain the search for food have rarely been considered. Here we
   evaluate the flight behavior of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) searching
   for artificial flowers of various sizes and colors. When flowers were
   large, search times correlated well with the color contrast of the
   targets with their green foliage-type background, as predicted by a
   model of color opponent coding using inputs from the bees' UV, blue, and
   green receptors. Targets that made poor color contrast with their
   backdrop, such as white, UV-reflecting ones, or red flowers, took
   longest to detect, even though brightness contrast with the background
   was pronounced. When searching for small targets, bees changed their
   strategy in several ways. They flew significantly slower and closer to
   the ground, so increasing the minimum detectable area subtended by an
   object on the ground. In addition, they used a different neuronal
   channel for flower detection. Instead of color contrast, they used only
   the green receptor signal for detection. We relate these findings to
   temporal and spatial limitations of different neuronal channels involved
   in stimulus detection and recognition, Thus, foraging speed may not be
   limited only by factors such as prey density, flight energetics, and
   scramble competition. Our results show that understanding the behavioral
   ecology of foraging can substantially gain from knowledge about
   mechanisms of visual information processing.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Vestigial organs arise commonly during morphological evolution, but they
   need not be destined for elimination. Instead, vestigial organs may
   facilitate functional innovation because their freedom from functional
   constraints allows them to assume novel roles that their functional
   progenitor could not perform. We illustrate this vestigial transition
   between functions with an experimental study of the staminode of
   Penstemon flowers. Previous phylogenetic and developmental studies
   indicate that this staminode represents a stamen that was lost
   phenotypically, but not genetically, and then reappeared in the tribe
   Cheloneae, to which Penstemon belongs. To assess whether the Penstemon
   staminode has adopted a novel function(s), we compared pollination of
   flowers with and without staminodes for two bee-pollinated species, P.
   ellipticus and P. palmeri, and two hummingbird-pollinated species, P.
   centranthifolius and P. rostriflorus. The staminode acts differently in
   the two bee-pollinated species. For P. ellipticus, which represents the
   basal Penstemon lineage, the staminode hinders pollinator access to
   nectar, which increases visit duration and pollinator contact with
   sexual organs, thereby increasing pollen receipt by stigmas and
   controlling pollen removal from anthers. In contrast, in P, palmeri, the
   staminode acts as a lever that enhances stigma contact with the
   pollinator, so that staminode removal reduced pollen receipt, but did
   not affect pollinator attraction, visit duration, or pollen removal.
   Unlike in bee-pollinated species, staminode removal from
   hummingbird-pollinated species did not affect any measured aspect of
   pollination, indicating that the staminode serves no function in this
   derived pollination system. These results illustrate several features of
   vestigial organs: loss of function can be temporary; loss of function
   facilitates the evolution of novel roles; and functional reinvention
   will often involve only a single role, thus increasing the chance of
   both secondary loss of function (bird-pollinated penstemons) and
   functional switches (P. palmeri).}},

Abstract = {{We tested the constancy of floral choice by Trigona carbonaria Smith in

   Constancy was tested on three levels. Within a single trip, 88\% of the
   samples examined comprised pure pollen loads (97\% or more of one pollen
   type). Within a single day, 88\% of bees visited the same species across
   trips sampled. Across 2 and 3 days, 82\% and 73\%, respectively, of
   individual bees foraged on a single pollen type. The majority of the
   remaining bees collected only two species of pollen. This pattern is
   consistent with that of other highly social bees. It enhances the
   pollinator efficacy of these insects by increasing the chances of pollen
   being transferred to stigmas of the same plant species. This increases
   the ecological importance of these bees and their value in crop
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted field studies on the Juan Fernandez Islands flora on the
   breeding system of 25 endemic species from 17 families. We recorded data
   on flower features, pollen and ovule number, pollen/ovule ratio, pollen
   size, self-compatibility, floral visitors, and pollination. Flowers are
   mostly hermaphrodite, inconspicuous, small, and green. Six species are
   dioecious. Over 806 of the cosexual species are self compatible.
   However, many species are dichogamous (mostly protandrous); thus, even
   the self-compatible species may require pollen transfer. Selfing through
   geitonogamy seems to be the most common system, and several species
   express mixed breeding systems. Floral visitors are uncommon to rare,
   except for two hummingbird species (one native and one endemic) that
   visit five species we studied. In more than 300 h of observation of
   flowers over three field seasons, we detected only 23 native insect
   visits representing ten species (Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera).
   One species each of an introduced ant and an introduced bee were also
   observed on some flowers, all near the single human settlement of San
   Juan Bautista. Wind directly moving pollen, or indirectly via shaking
   the flowers. is the most important pollen distribution mechanism. The
   majority of the wind-pollinated species bear some typical anemophilous
   features, but also others not characteristic of wind pollination, that
   presumably represent the condition of their biotically pollinated
   ancestors. Floral features often reflect ancestral reproductive systems,
   so floral biology studies of oceanic islands in particular must be done
   with cognizance of presumed ancestral forms, because the observed

   production were significantly higher on large serpentine outcrops than

   the soil's ratio of calcium to magnesium. Successful pollination was
   positively affected by flower density and the number of other flowering

   was enhanced by the experimental addition of pollen from other patches,

Abstract = {{Wild bee communities were studied on one- to five-year-old set-aside

   bees on two-year-old set-aside fields and a second on old meadows.
   Successional changes of bee communities were related to changes of
   vegetation. The transition from pioneer successional stages, dominated
   by annuals, to early successional stages, dominated by perennials.
   resulted in the highest species richness of flowering plants in the

   of flowering plants was the best predictor variable for species richness
   of bees, whereas the cover of flowering plants correlated with the
   abundance of bees. Annual plants were visited more often and perennials
   less often than expected from their flower cover. Halictidae tended to
   prefer flowers of annuals, whereas Megachilidae, Apidae and

Abstract = {{1. Bees are believed to be dominant pollen vectors in tropical forests,
   yet studies specific to bees in south-east Asia are rare. Regeneration
   and restoration of the rapidly disappearing lowland forests of this
   region are reliant on bees, thus there is an urgent need for forest bee
   data at the community level.
   2. Bee communities of eight forested sites in Johor (Malaysia) and
   Singapore were surveyed three times each from February to August 1999 at
   the below-canopy level. These sites ranged from relatively undisturbed
   primary lowland dipterocarp forests to late secondary forests and exotic
   forests, including an oil palm plantation. We attempted to elucidate the
   environmental factors that correlated with the distribution of bees.
   3. Bee abundance, in particular that of Apidae, was significantly higher
   in larger primary forests than other types of forests. However, bee
   species richness was higher in disturbed forests.
   4. The distribution of bees was apparently influenced by variables
   closely related to forest disturbance and resource abundance, such as
   the density of big trees (diameter at breast height 30-40 cm),
   temperature and flowering intensity of trees and shrubs.
   5. More stingless bees (Trigona spp.) were found where trees were larger
   and ambient conditions more constant but flowering intensities lower.
   6. The differences between the bee communities in forests of urban
   Singapore and primary forests in Johor may indicate that ecological
   processes in the forests of Singapore, in particular pollination, may be
   changing. However, pollination may not be totally intact in the primary
   forests surveyed, as their bee communities seemed to be depauperate.
   7. The role of important pollinators, especially bees, for the long-term
   survival of tropical lowland forests is poorly understood. Our study
   indicates that we urgently need more thorough understanding of
   pollination and pollinators, as some bee species appear to be
   disappearing from disturbed tropical lowland forests.}},

Abstract = {{1 The variation of floral sex allocation with flower position within

   ambigua. Investment in female function (pistil), attraction (corolla)
   and nectar production decreased from bottom to top flowers, whereas male
   investment (stamen) did not differ.
   2 This self-incompatible species appears to set seeds as a result of
   visitation by nectar robbing bumblebee queens. The tendency of bees to
   visit lower flowers first and then move upwards within an inflorescence
   should result in directional pollen flow from bottom to top flowers.
   3 Naturally pollinated upper flowers set fewer seeds than intermediate
   and lower flowers due to pollen limitation. The lack of differences in
   seed set and seed mass per pod following artificial outcrossing
   indicated that resource limitation did not explain the variation in seed
   production of flowers in different positions. Pollen viability also did
   not differ significantly between flower positions.
   4 A model of pollination was developed that incorporated the visitation
   pattern of bumblebees and observed variations in nectar distribution
   between flower positions. This predicted that receipt of outcross pollen
   would decrease from bottom to top flowers, but that pollen export to
   other plants would not differ between flower positions provided that the
   pollen exchange rate of pollinators was either small or positively
   correlated with nectar content of each flower position. The observed
   pattern of floral sex allocation would then be parallel to relative
   success of pollen export and import between flower positions within

Abstract = {{1 Habitat fragmentation and the resulting decline in the local abundance
   of plant species can affect biological interactions. We examined the
   effects of abundance on plant-pollinator interactions by observing the
   pollinator service and subsequent reproductive output of a mostly
   outbreeding, but self-compatible, plant, Lychnis viscaria, in
   experimental populations of different sizes (number of individuals) and
   densities (distance between individuals).
   2 Bumblebees, the main pollinators of L. viscaria, preferred larger
   populations, but visitation rates were higher in sparser populations.
   Pollinators were attracted to the larger inflorescences in sparse
   populations, which were also more visible due to their larger area for a
   given size.
   3 Bumblebees probed more flowers within plants in sparse populations,
   probably due to the larger inflorescences and longer flight distances
   between individuals.
   4 Subsequent reproductive success (capsule production) was higher in
   sparse populations, due to differences in pollination success and
   resource competition, and their interaction. In self-compatible species,
   such as L. viscaria, reproductive success may be determined more by
   resource availability, whereas self-incompatible plants may be more
   sensitive to changes in pollinator abundance.
   5 We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions are sensitive to
   changes in both the size and spatial arrangement of plant populations,
   which can affect their demography and genetics. In this study, species
   density had a greater effect than size and the unexpectedly beneficial
   effects of low density may be due to greater resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{Diverse pollinator assemblages may impose complex selection and thus

   variation in floral design (flower size and form) and floral display
   (number of open flowers) for the distylous clonal shrub Jasminum

   insect type and population for seven populations in one year, and
   between insect types and years for a single population over 3 years.
   There was also a significant interaction between insect type and
   population for the proportion of flowers visited. In general the number
   of visits was positively related to the number of open flowers in a
   patch, but analyses by insect type showed that this was only true for
   bee flies and butterflies. Short-tongued bees showed a positive
   relationship between visitation rate and the number of open flowers on
   the focal stem, and hawkmoths and butterflies made more visits to plants
   with larger flowers. Hawkmoths were the only insect type to show a
   positive relation between the number of flowers visited per foraging
   bout and flower size. The significant differences between different
   insect types in patterns of variation in visitation rates in response to

   a significant increase in absolute and relative amounts of

   it functions in the lining of the brood cells. Furthermore, this

   contained qualitatively and quantitatively similar resources. The
   authors also investigated whether site constancy was affected by the
   arrangement of patches within the area. The experimental arena was a
   field of barley containing patches of a grass/herb mixture, including
   Centaurea nigra L. (black knapweed) which provided nectar and pollen for
   bumble bees, particularly Bombus lapidarius L. Patches were either
   contiguous or non-contiguous in patch groups. Twenty to 28\% of marked
   B. lapidarius were re-observed in the experimental arena during the week
   following marking. The number of re-observations of bees decreased over
   time probably because floral density decreased, the bees sought
   alternative forage elsewhere or they died from natural causes. The bees
   showed striking site constancy: 86-88\% of re-observations were constant
   to patch group (27 x 27 m(2) or 45 x 45 m(2)) and fewer re-observations
   were constant to small patches (9 x 9 m(2)) within a patch group. Most
   observed moves were to patches or patch groups adjacent to those on
   which the bumble bees were marked. There was Limited evidence that
   bumble bees were more constant to 9 x 9 m(2) patches surrounded by
   barley (70-73\% of re-observations were patch constant) than to 9 x 9
   m(2) patches that were contiguous (20-50\% of re-observations were patch
   constant). The implications of the observed bumble bee site constancy
   for plant gene flow in the arable ecosystem are discussed. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Pollination strategies adopted by the largely sub-Saharan African
   Gladiolus (approximately 260 species), one of the largest genera of the
   monocot family Iridaceae, are unusually diverse. The primary or sole
   pollinators include long-tongued apid and amhophorine bees (Apidae),
   short-tongued halictid and andrenid bees (Halictidae, Andrenidae),
   sometimes in combination with hopliine beetles (Scarabaeidae),
   long-prohoseid flies (Nemestrinidae, Tabanidae), large butterflies
   (Satyridae), moths (mostly Noctuidae and Sphingidae), and sunbirds
   (Passerinae.). Floral form correlates closely with pollination strategy,
   allowing us to infer the pollination ecology of almost all 165 species
   in southern Africa, although we have observations of animal visitors
   capable of accomplishing pollen transfer in only half this number.
   Pollination by apid bees foraging for nectar and passively transferring
   pollen brushed onto their bodies during feeding occurs in all seven
   sections of the genus in southern Africa and is also the most common
   strategy in five of these sections. Other pollinators include female
   bees actively foraging for pollen, or long-proboseid flies, sunbirds,
   moths, the satyrid butterfly, Aeropetes, all foraging for nectar, and in
   one species hopliine beetles that use the flowers as sites for assembly
   and copulation. Shifts in floral form associated with changes in
   pollination appear complex in the large flowers of Gladiolus species,
   but may in fact involve relatively simple developmental modifications,
   involving changes in perianth pigmentation, and often the type of
   marking on the tepals, presence or absence of scent, length of the
   perianth tube, and occasionally a shift from zygomorphy to actinomorphy.
   Associated with these changes is a correlated adjustment in nectar
   characteristics, including volume, sugar concentration, and sometimes
   sugar chemistry. With an inferred minimum of 32 shifts in pollination
   system in the 165 species in southern Africa, Gladiolus appears to have
   an unusually labile floral morphology, which may account for its
   extensive adaptive. radiation.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the species richness and abundance of pollinator

   April 1999) among four types of urban land use in the Phoenix, Arizona,
   USA, metropolitan area (xeriscaped residential yards, mesiscaped
   residential yards, urban desert-remnant parks, and natural desert parks
   on the fringe of the metropolitan area). Richness and abundance of bees
   were generally lower in residential areas than in desert areas, with
   desert areas on the fringe of the metro area possessing the highest
   diversity of all sites. Residential yards that utilized xeric
   landscaping had a more diverse bee community (with proportionally more
   rare species) than did mesic (turf grass) yards, particularly in late
   summer (September). Although bee community structure was apparently
   unaffected by the density of local habitat features (native and exotic
   trees, shrubs, cacti, and herbaceous plants in addition to human-built
   structures), the types of habitat features do appear to influence the
   number and types of bees present in an area. These results suggest that
   urban development can be designed to promote the conservation of bees.
   Specifically, preservation of desert and greater use of xeric
   landscaping rather than mesiscaping may help preserve this ecologically
   and economically vital group of organisms.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{127-144}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The separation between staminate and pistillate phases in protandrous,
   long-lived hermaphroditic flowers results :in a seasonal shift in sex
   ratio from a pure male to a pure female flower population. In theory,
   temporal sex ratio associated with dichogamy may affect pollination,
   promoting the evolution of sexual specialization in plants when
   pollinator visitation does not limit seed output. Alstroemeria aurea, a
   perennial herb native to the temperate forests of southern South
   America, bears strongly protandrous flowers. Over a three-year period, I
   assessed the influence of seasonal changes in flower sex ratio and
   pollinator abundance on the pollination dynamics of this plant species.
   Workers of Bombus dahlbomii accounted for >90\% of all visits to A.
   aurea flowers and were the most efficient pollinators on a per-visit
   basis. As the season progressed, pollen loads carried by bumble bees
   decreased by almost one order of magnitude, and the amount of pollen
   deposited per visit decreased as well from >40 to <4 pollen grains from
   the beginning to the end of the flowering season. As flowering patches
   became more female, the number of male-phase flowers visited
   uninterruptedly during each bumble bee foraging bout decreased, while
   the number of sequential visits to female-phase Aowers increased. A
   laboratory experiment of manipulating dried bumble bees showed that the
   number of male- and female-phase flowers visited in uninterrupted
   sequence strongly influences the amount of pollen deposited on a
   flower's stigma. Pollen deposition in this experiment closely mimicked
   the relationship between sex ratio and the observed seasonal decline in
   per-visit pollen deposition in the field.
   Because overall rate of bumble bee visitation increased monotonically
   over the flowering season, total pollen receipt per flower also
   increased during the first half of the season. Nevertheless, pollen
   deposition decreased during the second half of the season when
   visitation rates saturated pollen removal, and low pollen availability
   associated with an increasingly female-biased sex ratio apparently
   became the limiting factor in pollen transfer.
   Despite pronounced seasonal changes in pollinator and pollination
   levels, comparisons of seed output between open- and hand-pollinated
   flowers showed no evidence that seed production was ever limited by
   total pollen receipt. Because flower sex ratio influenced pollinator
   visitation and pollination patterns, and pollinator availability did not
   limit seed output, protandry should favor the evolution of female and
   male specialists flowering at the tails of the flowering season. Neither
   unisexuality nor any other form of sexual polymorphism is found in A.
   aurea, however. Likewise, I found no evidence that plants might be
   compensating for a seasonal shift in sex ratio through differential
   allocation into pollen and ovule production within flowers or to
   relative duration of male and female sexual phases. These results
   suggest that a seasonal shift in operational sex ratio within a
   dichogamous species can profoundly affect pollination without
   necessarily driving the evolution of floral polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reviews briefly the presently available information on
   bee-flies (Bombylius, Bombyliidae, Diptera) and their role in the

   field studies carried out over three consecutive flowering seasons in
   the surroundings of Vienna (Lower Austria). Field work concentrated on
   factors affecting flower visit frequencies of bee-flies to evaluate
   their role as potential pollinators. The results indicate that the
   significance of bee-flies in pollination is commonly undervalued. Though
   there are no plants that are exclusively pollinated by bee-flies and
   though a clearly defined type of ``bee-fly flower{''} does not exist,
   significant relations between bee-flies and flower size, shape and
   coloration can be recognized. Bee-flies visit numerous taxa of different
   families, but prefer groups with hypocrateriform, tubular, disk and lip
   flowers, while other floral types, such as keel and funnel flowers,
   receive less attention. The preferred colours of the flowers visited are
   purple, violet, blue and white. Yellow flowers, and still more reddish
   or pink flowers are much less attractive. The hitherto existing records
   on plants visited by bee-flies in Europe are summarized (Tab. 7). The
   activity of the bee-flies depends strongly on weather conditions; a
   significant correlation was found between visit frequency and solar
   irradiation. Low flight activity in shade and shade-avoidance explains
   why plants pollinated predominantly by bee-flies (e.g., Pulmonaria

Abstract = {{The floral relationships existing between the mainly New World genus
   Sisyrinchium (Iridaceae) and oil-collecting bees were investigated in
   southern South America. In addition to a single species known before as
   producing floral oil and being pollinated by oil-dependent bees, the
   present paper documents 11 further species of Sections Sisyrinchium and
   Echthronema (including Sect. Cephalanthum), which share this ecological
   status. The oil is secreted by one-celled, headed glandular trichomes
   which form in many species dense carpets (elaiophors) covering the
   staminal column basally, rarely parts of free filaments or tepals. Based
   on literature, 23 additional species possessing columnar hair carpets,
   presumable elaiophores, are listed. The principal and in some taxa
   exclusive visitors of oil-bearing S. are species of Lanthanomelissa
   (Anthophoridae-Tapinotaspidini), a southern genus that appears to have
   coevolved with its oil hosts. The females bear special scrapers on the
   forelegs by which they disrupt the oil-filled cuticular blisters of the
   hairs to forage the fluid. The oil then becomes mixed with pollen
   passively taken up from the same flower. Species of Tapinotaspis and
   Chalepogenus (Tapinotaspidini) also forage oil in S. species. The
   oil-harvesting and pollinating procedure is described in detail for S.
   arenarium, chilense. pachyrhizum, and laxum. Sympatric S. species may
   display divergent day-times of flower opening. - Altogether, seven
   flower types including taxa lacking elaiophors are discriminated in S.
   The latter - pollen flowers exploited by polylectic bees - are
   distributed over the genus and predominate in the related genera. The
   oil-based partnership of S. is so far only known from the southern
   Neotropics, the probable centre of origin of both partners. The North
   America members of S., presumable derivatives from the Neotropical
   stock, bear vestigial elaiophors no longer used and are pollinated by

   anthesis and the sticky viscin threads that last on the birds for a long
   time. Additionally, the flowers are very attractive to bumble bees,

   to be the plants' most effective pollinators at the site. Hummingbirds,

Abstract = {{The `Red Delicious' apple exhibits full self-incompatibility, therefore
   its fruit production depends totally on cross pollination, especially by
   honeybees, which are the ultimate apple pollinators. In the present
   study, the technique of sequential introduction of honeybee colonies and
   doubling their density was applied to determine effects on yield. In
   three consecutive season it was found that sequentially increasing the
   density of colonies in the apple orchards from 2.5 colonies per ha., as
   recommended previously, to 5.0 colonies per ha, and introducing them
   sequentially (half at the 10\% full bloom (FB) and half at FB),
   increased the number of bees per tree, their mobility among the rows,

Abstract = {{The describe a simple study of how bumblebees ( Bombus spp.) behave when
   visiting florets which are arranged in a circle around a vertical
   inflorescence. In four species of bees, individuals showed a tendency
   for rotation in the same direction around each inflorescence on
   successive visits, i.e., each individual tended to go either clockwise
   or anticlockwise. Similar behavior has also been observed in mammals
   including humans. The implications of this tendency to repeat tasks in
   the same way are discussed, particularly in relation to our
   understanding of the phenomenon known as flower constancy: In humans,
   the tendency for individuals to turn in a particular direction is
   strongly related to handedness. In three of the four bee species there
   was a significant overall tendency for the bees to rotate in a preferred
   direction, suggesting that they too may exhibit handedness.}},

Abstract = {{Several recent phylogenetic analyses of separate morphological,
   molecular, and paleontological data sets have addressed evolutionary
   relationships among the tribes of corbiculate bees (Apidae: Apini,
   Bombini, Euglossini, and Meliponini). These analyses appear to disagree
   in their implications about the evolution of eusociality within this
   group. Whereas morphological and paleontological data strongly support
   the classical hypothesis of a single origin of general eusociality and a
   single origin of advanced eusociality, some authors have suggested that
   molecular data strongly contradict this view, and instead support
   independent, parallel origins of advanced eusociality or, alternatively,
   evolutionary reversals to solitary behavior from a eusocial ancestor
   common to all corbiculate bees. In order to reconcile this conflict
   between morphology and molecules, these authors have suggested that the
   morphological data may be flawed. We briefly review the evidence for
   this disagreement between morphological and molecular data and conclude
   that it is exaggerated; we also find the various criticisms of the
   morphological data unpersuasive. By any standard phylogenetic measure,
   three of four molecular data sets are ambiguous in their support of
   alternate hypotheses regarding eusocial evolution, whereas
   morphological, paleontological, and recent ethological data are
   unequivocal. Judged in its entirety, then, the available evidence
   continues to support Darwin's null hypothesis of (Euglossini + (Bombini

   advanced eusocial behavior in the corbiculate bees.}},

Abstract = {{The large circumboreal genus Delphinium is characterized by
   short-spurred blue-purple flowers pollinated primarily by bees. Two
   interesting exceptions to this pattern are the long-spurred red flowers
   of two western North American species known to be
   hummingbird-pollinated, and the long-spurred evening-scented white
   flowers of an east African species, Delphinium leroyi. Observations on
   the Nyika Plateau, Malawi, showed that flowers of D. leroyi were
   frequently visited by hawkmoths during a 30 minute period after dusk.
   The most common visitor, Hippotion celerio, has a mean tongue length of
   37 rum, corresponding almost exactly to the floral spur of D. leroyi;
   consequently, there is effective placement of pollen on the underside of
   the moths. The flowers were also visited occasionally by the very long
   tongued hawkmoth Agrius convolvuli, but this moth does not make
   effective contact with anthers and appears to act only as a nectar
   robber. Delphinium leroyi occurs in open grasslands on the Nyika
   Plateau, while a related species D. dasycaulon which has short-spurred
   blue flowers that are visited by bees, occurs in shrubby vegetation
   associated with old termitaria and forest margins. Although the two

Abstract = {{Spatial processes in pollination biology are poorly understood,
   especially at levels above that of the local population. For example,
   little is known about how pollinators and pollen move among populations,
   although there is evidence that such movement can exceed what is
   predicted from intrapopulational movement. We explored pollination
   success in experimental isolates of the bumblebee- and
   hummingbird-pollinated wildflower Delphinium nuttallianum. We
   established a total of 15 arrays of potted plants isolated by 50-400 m
   from ten natural ``source{''} populations, as well as control arrays
   embedded within each source. Flowers on potted plants were emasculated,
   so any pollen received could be assumed to come from source populations.
   A total of 69 h of observation suggested that pollinators were somewhat
   less abundant in isolates than in controls, but visited more plants and
   flowers once within an isolate. Consistent with this, 82.1\% of all
   flowers in isolated arrays received pollen, versus 87.7\% in controls.
   Mean receipt was more than 100 pollen grains per flower in most arrays,
   and seed set in isolates and controls respectively averaged 69.8\% and
   74.3\% of ovules. Furthermore, pollen receipt in isolates declined
   relatively slowly with distance from the source. We conclude that
   pollinators of D. nuttallianum often will fly up to 400 m among
   populations, and that substantial pollination ensues. Thus isolated
   populations of this species often belong to metapopulations in terms of
   pollen dispersal, with important consequences for genetic
   differentiation, and potential implications for the management of
   endangered plant species.}},

Abstract = {{The outcomes of interactions among plants and the insects that use their
   flowers are likely to vary among the physical environments and the
   communities in which they grow. In this study we quantified floral
   damage of Aconitum lycoctonum in high (>2000 m) and low (c. 500 m)
   elevation populations in Switzerland. At high elevation, floral damage
   was frequent and was caused by nectar-robbing short-tongued bumblebees.
   Nectar robbers make a hole in the flower when they collect nectar. A
   nectar robber exclusion experiment showed that nectar robbery by
   short-tongued bumblebees had no effect on the female reproductive
   success of plants; robbing bees rarely damaged the nectaries, and damage
   to the petals probably does not decrease flower longevity. In addition,
   nectar robbers tended to collect pollen during about 10\% of their
   visits. Thus, these bees may act as low-efficiency pollinators and may,
   at times, be mutualistic associates. At low elevation, the holes in the
   flowers were caused by beetles (Meligethes viridescens) and not by
   short-tongued bumblebees. The beetles eat pollen and might also consume
   nectar. Since the beetles gain access to pollen and nectar by entering
   the flower through its opening, and later chew holes while foraging on
   floral tissue, the beetles are pollen eaters rather than nectar robbers.
   Overall, our results show that not all floral damage is caused by nectar
   robbers and that there can be strong altitudinal variation in the causes
   and consequences of floral damage.}},

Abstract = {{The density of a plant population is expected to influence reproductive

   was lower than in nearby dense populations, whereas quantity of
   pollination service was equivalent. To explore the hypotheses that
   environmental quality or pollination quality are lower in sparse natural
   populations, leading to lower seed set, we manipulated density using
   arrays of potted plants. In three replicate experiments with D.
   nuttallianum, pollinator visitation rate and seed set were
   indistinguishable in sparse and dense arrays, consistent with the
   interpretation that environmental quality contributed to the earlier
   result in natural populations of this species. In three replicates with
   A. columbianum, visitation rate tended to increase with density, and
   seed set increased significantly, in contrast to our earlier result. One
   element of pollination quality, the degree of within-plant selfing, did

   the basic aspects of the floral morphology and reproduction of Macleania
   bullata (Ericaceae) in a tropical montane wet forest in southwest
   Colombia, I examined the percent of flowers robbed and the effect of
   nectar robbery on fruit set. The flowers of this species are typical for
   plants pollinated by long-bill hummingbirds. They are protandrous and
   open for four days. Fruit production requires a pollinator visit; fruit
   set following pollinator exclusion was zero. Fruit set following
   xenogamous pollen transfer (36.8\%) differed significantly from that of
   population controls (11.9\%) and of autogamous pollen transfer (6.3\%).
   Nectar volume, sugar concentration and sugar production were measured at
   daily intervals from bud opening until the fading of flowers. Daily
   nectar production (both volume and amount of sugar) varied considerably
   with flower age. Sugar production peaked on the second day, coinciding
   with the male phase. The frequency of nectar robbing in the studied

   correlated with reduced fruit set. I discuss the probability of a
   relation between reduced fruit set on robbed flowers and an energetic

   re-synthesize more nectar. The high incidence of nectar robbing impugns
   the advantage of specialization.}},

Abstract = {{Diurnal visitors to the flowers of many native plant species were
   identified in a wide range of Tasmanian sclerophyllous vegetation
   between September 1996 and April 1997. These foraging profiles were
   analysed to determine whether they were characteristic of various floral
   morphologies in predictable ways. It was found that although visitor
   profiles were sometimes consistent with classic pollination syndromes,
   these syndromes were unreliable predictors of floral visitors. Very few
   flowers were exclusively bird-pollinated, and none were strictly fly-,
   beetle-, wasp-, or butterfly-pollinated. The majority of flowering
   plants were unspecialized in their morphology, and consequently hosted a
   diverse array of visitors. In addition, visitor profiles to congeners
   with similar floral morphologies, and even to conspecifics, differed
   between habitats. Altitude was a major factor in determining visitors,
   with flies being the most abundant visitors above 700 m. However,
   congeners in several genera of Epacridaceae, as well as the genus
   Correa, which differed in floral morphology also differed in visitor
   profiles. Tubular flowers were associated with birds, while flowers with
   more accessible nectar were visited by insects. The only taxa exhibiting
   a bee-pollination syndrome that were largely visited by bees were the
   Fabaceae and Goodenia ovata Sm. Several species with purple or pink
   flowers were also predominantly visited by bees, but did not strictly
   conform to the melittophilous syndrome. In contrast, other flowers
   exhibiting an ostensibly mellitophilous syndrome hosted very few bees.
   Of these, species that occurred at high altitude were mainly visited by
   flies, while others received very few potential pollen vectors.}},

Title = {{Evolution of reproductive strategies in the sexually deceptive orchid
   Ophrys sphegodes: How does flower-specific variation of odor signals

Abstract = {{The orchid Ophrys sphegodes Miller is pollinated by sexually excited
   males of the solitary bee Andrena nigroaenea, which are lured to the
   flowers by visual cues and volatile semiochemicals. In O. sphegodes,
   visits by pollinators are rare. Because of this low frequency of
   pollination, one would expect the evolution of strategies that increase
   the chance that males will visit more than one flower on the same plant;
   this would increase the number of pollination events on a plant and
   therefore the number of seeds produced. Using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses, we identified more than 100 compounds in
   the odor bouquets of labellum extracts from O. sphegodes; 24 compounds
   were found to be biologically active in male olfactory receptors based
   on gas chromatography with electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD). Gas
   chromatography (GC) analyses of odors from individual flowers showed
   less intraspecific variation in the odor bouquets of the biologically
   active compounds as compared to nonactive compounds. This can be
   explained by a higher selective pressure on the pollinator-attracting
   communication signal. Furthermore, we found a characteristic variation
   in the GC-EAD active esters and aldehydes among flowers of different
   stem positions within an inflorescence and in the n-alkanes and
   n-alkenes among plants from different populations. In our behavioral
   field tests, we showed that male bees learn the odor bouquets of
   individual flowers during mating attempts and recognize them in later
   encounters. Bees thereby avoid trying to mate with flowers they have
   visited previously, but do not avoid other flowers either of a different
   or the same plant. By varying the relative proportions of saturated
   esters and aldehydes between flowers of different stem positions, we
   demonstrated that a plant may take advantage of the learning abilities
   of the pollinators and influence flower visitation behavior. Sixty-seven
   percent of the males that visited one flower in an inflorescence
   returned to visit a second flower of the same inflorescence. However,
   geitonogamy is prevented and the likelihood of cross-fertilization is
   enhanced by the time required for the pollinium deposited on the
   pollinator to complete its bending movement, which is necessary for
   pollination to occur. Cross-fertilization is furthermore enhanced by the
   high degree of odor variation between plants. This variation minimizes
   learned avoidance of the flowers and increases the likelihood that a
   given pollinator would visit several to many different plants within a
   population.}},

   province in Brazil and are nowadays the main agricultural frontier which
   has resulted in deforestation rates much higher than those occurring in
   lowland tropical forests. Despite the marked winter/dry - summer/wet

   year, although with a peak at the end of the dry season. Seven
   pollination guilds were identified, ranging from very small insects
   (body size less than 5 mm) to bats, but bee pollination was predominant,
   and overall pollination biology of the cerrado community was similar to
   that reported for evergreen neotropical forests. Most species were
   outbreeding in that self-pollinations yielded very few fruits, but
   heteromorphic and homomorphic self-incompatibility were rare and control
   of selfing was commonly exercised by ill-defined post-zygotic

Abstract = {{Pollinators collect resources that are patchy., since flowers are
   usually aggregated on several spatial scales. Empirical studies have
   established that pollinators almost invariably visit a smaller
   proportion of Bowers as patch size increases. This has not been
   adequately explained. Here I present data on the payoff curve achieved
   by bumblebees, Bombus lapidarius, when visiting patches containing
   different numbers of inflorescences, and use the marginal value theorem
   to predict the optimum duration of stay within patches. The data
   demonstrate that visiting a declining proportion of inflorescences as
   patch size increases is an optimal strategy, if we assume that bees are
   attempting to maximise their rate of reward acquisition. I argue that
   this occurs because starching for the remaining unvisited inflorescences
   is easier in a small patch. On large patches, bees visited more
   inflorescences per patch than predicted (although still visiting a
   declining proportion). I suggest that this may occur because bees are
   using simple departure rules which result in near-optimal behaviour. I
   show that a departure rule based on two successive encounters with empty

Abstract = {{Broad-tailed and rufous hummingbirds avoid plants and flowers that have
   recently been visited by nectar-robbing bees. However. the cues the
   hummingbirds use to make such choices are not known. To determine the
   proximate cues hummingbirds use to avoid visiting nectar-robbed plants,
   I conducted multiple field experiments and one aviary study using the
   nectar-robbed, hummingbird-pollinated plant Ipomopsis aggregata. In the
   first held experiment, free-flying hummingbirds were presented with
   plants in which I manipulated nectar volume and the presence of
   nectar-robber holes. Hummingbirds visited significantly more plants with
   nectar and probed more available flowers on those plants, regardless of
   the presence of nectar-robber holes. Thus, I hypothesized that
   hummingbirds may avoid robbed plants based on their spatial memory of
   unrewarding plants and/or visual cues that nectar absence provides. In
   an aviary study, I removed spatial cues by re-randomizing the position
   of plants after each hummingbird-foraging bout, but hummingbirds still
   selected plants with nectar. Nectar map provide a visual cue in I.
   aggregata flowers because corollas are translucent, and nectar is
   visible through the side of the corolla. To determine if hummingbirds
   use this visual cue to avoid plants with no nectar, I masked corolla
   translucence in a field study by painting flowers with acrylic paint.
   Hummingbirds still visited significantly more plants with nectar and
   probed more flowers on those plants, whether ol not the corollas were
   painted. These results suggest that hummingbirds use nectar as a
   proximate cue to locate and avoid non-rewarding, nectar-robbed plants,
   even in the absence of spatial cues and simple visual cues.}},

Abstract = {{We studied pollinator visitation rates and movement patterns in
   experimental arrays of irises at two sites within a Louisiana iris
   hybrid zone. Arrays contained single-flowered stems of red-flowered Iris
   fulva, blue-flowered I. hexagona, and purple-flowered F-1 hybrids. At
   one site, where I. hexagona was the only wild-growing iris, queen bumble
   bees were the most common pollinator, and the rank order of pollinator
   visit rates was I. hexagona > F-1 > I. fulva. At a second site, where I.
   fulva predominated in the wild, hummingbirds were the most common
   pollinators. and this order was reversed: I. hexagona < F-1 < I. fulva.
   Thus, at both rites, the naturally occurring iris was visited most
   frequently and F-1 flowers were visited more frequently than the
   non-native species. Pollinators used both long-distance and
   short-distance cues to discriminate among flowers, and differences in
   visit rates seemed to be based on differences in the ease of access to
   pollen and nectar records on flowers of different size. Analysis of
   movement patterns between flowers showed that pollinators were more
   likely to make parental-F-1 transitions than heterospecific transitions.
   These data suggest that pollinator behavior acts as a partial barrier to
   initial hybridization, although this barrier largely breaks down after
   F-1, formation. Our results help to explain the existence of many
   introgressed populations of Louisiana iris, despite the fact that F(1)s
   are extremely rare in the wild.}},

Abstract = {{The invariability of animal-pollinated flowers relative to vegetative

   stabilizing selection, which occurs when intermediate phenotypes attain
   the highest fitness. Evidence for the operation of such a mechanism is
   rare in this context, however. Here, I report an experiment that used
   oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv. Westar) as the basis of a model system
   in which the spatial disposition of flowers' sexual organs was
   manipulated in order to characterize the relationship between form and
   function. Specifically, individual flowers were manipulated by replacing
   a section of the style with a length of fine wire in order to produce
   flowers with pistils of various lengths. The pollination performance of
   these virgin, model flowers was then assessed by measuring the amount of
   pollen removed and deposited during a single bumblebee visit. There was
   no evidence that pollen removal was affected by pistil length. Variation
   in pistil length, however, was associated with a pronounced optimum in
   pollen deposition, which was attained by only a narrow range of pistil
   variants of intermediate length. These results suggest that stabilizing

   distribution is restricted, mainly associated with ``campos

   self-compatible but because of herkogamy they are greatly dependent on
   visitors to effect pollination. The main pollinators are medium-sized
   bees. In experiments where pollinators were excluded or discouraged the
   percentage of abscised fruits was total or extremely high; most of these
   fruits dropped within the first two weeks after pollination in D.
   orbicularis and three weeks in D. hirsutus. The percentage of surviving
   fruits from control or manual pollination was higher in D. orbicularis
   (co. 70\%) than in D. hirsutus (co. 50\%). Seed set was very variable,
   with slightly lower means in D. hirsutus. Within each species the mean
   seed set was similar in self-, cross-pollinated fruits, and controls. In
   both species, the similarity between control and manual pollination
   fruit survival curves suggests that factors other than pollen limitation
   are the cause of abortion in the study area. The high rate of
   abscission, which was also observed in unmanipulated fruits, was
   attributed to resource limitation. In D. hirsutus this was caused by
   drought during seed development. In D. orbicularis it was enhanced by
   nutrient drain by shoot-galling flies. The lack of selective abortion of

Abstract = {{We have re-examined the nectar status of Cistus creticus, a plant that
   was previously thought to be an almost exclusive pollen donor. Although
   attempts to extract nectar with the microcapillary method failed,
   rinsates of the flower interior yielded considerable amounts of sugar,
   yet with high interplant variation. Enzymatic microassays revealed that
   secreted sugar is adsorbed onto the surfaces of the numerous filaments
   surrounding the nectary, on the dense pubescence of the ovary surrounded
   by the nectary and on the yellow base of the purplish-pink, free,
   obovate petals. The conclusion that C. creticus is an efficient nectar
   donor was further strengthened by video recording the behaviour of bees
   and by the high frequency of nectar thieves. We propose that the shallow
   flower shape and the overheating caused by solar tracking facilitate
   evaporative concentration of nectar. Alternatively (or in addition), the
   morphological proximity of the nectary to the filaments and the ovary
   pubescence facilitates adsorption and the capillary action of the cell
   walls works antagonistically to glass microcapillaries precluding nectar
   collection. Addition of artificial nectar in the field had no effect on
   bee visit frequency but it increased visit duration significantly and
   decreased abortion rates, in addition, seed yield was increased,

Abstract = {{Nectar robbers are birds, insects, or other flower visitors that remove
   nectar from flowers through a hole pierced or bitten in the corolla.
   This paper is a review of the effects of nectar robbers on pollinators,
   pollination, and fitness of the plants they rob. Charles Darwin assumed
   that nectar robbers had a negative impact on the plants that they visit,
   but research done in the last 50 years indicates that they often have a
   beneficial or neutral effect. Several studies document that robbers
   frequently pollinate the plants that they visit. Robbers may also have
   an indirect effect on the behavior of the legitimate pollinators, and in
   some circumstances, the change in pollinator behavior could result in
   improved fitness through increased pollen how and outcrossing. The
   effects of nectar robbers are complex and depend, in part, on the
   identity of the robber, the identity of the legitimate pollinator, how
   much nectar the robbers remove, and the variety of floral resources
   available in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to find one or more rearing methods that
   would allow us to release Osmia lignaria Say populations from natal
   nests to pollinate February-flowering almonds, Prunus amygdalus Batsch,
   in California's Central Valley. We exposed three phenologically distinct
   O. lignaria populations (early-, mid-, and late-flying) to different
   temperature treatments through development and wintering for a total of
   nine rearing treatments. These treatments combined three approaches to
   obtain early Lee emergence: (1) exposing bees to warmer or fluctuating
   temperatures, or both, during development; (2) exposing bees to warmer
   wintering temperatures: and (3) using early-flying lee populations from
   Central Valley California latitudes. Extended periods of high
   prewintering temperatures resulted in apparent fat bod, consumption of
   prewintering adults and reductions in springtime adult longevity. In
   general, temperature treatments that promoted rapid immature
   development, and thus longer wintering periods, resulted in earlier
   spring emergence patterns of bees well timed with bloom period of
   almonds. Warmer wintering periods also resulted in earlier emergence. In
   addition to providing good Ice-bloom synchrony, several treatments also
   yielded vigorous emerging populations, rapid establishment and nesting,
   and population increases. The potential importance of our results to
   anticipated increases in the demand for pollination services in
   California's Central Valley almonds is discussed.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{907-918}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Using alfalfa grown for seed, we tested the hypothesis that seed set for
   a awed number of pollinations is lower when the standing crop of open
   flowers is high than when it is low. This could occur if pollinators are
   more likely to move between flowers on the same plant, causing
   self-pollination, when flowers are abundant. The hypothesis has
   practical implications for agricultural production because
   self-pollinations produce fewer seeds per pod than do cross-pollinations
   in alfalfa. We simulated seed set in a model that included published
   movement patterns of the alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata
   (F.) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), and estimates of seed set when a
   series of flowers on the same giant are hand pollinated. Seed set from a
   fixed number of pollinations averaged only approximate to6-7\% higher
   when standing crop was low than when standing crop was high. This small
   increase in seed set would he difficult to detect experimentally because
   of high variability between plants. M. rotundata appears to move with a
   56\% probability of leaving a given raceme and a given plant: this
   foraging behavior results in few flowers visited per plant. A pollinator
   with a higher probability of leaving racemes and plan ts could set
   slightly more seed than M. rotundata, whereas a pollinator with a lower
   probability of leaving racemes and plants would be more affected by
   newer standing crop than is M. rotundata. The distribution of flowers
   visited per raceme by bees in alfalfa can be predicted by superimposing
   the movement probability on the distribution of open flowers per raceme.
   This conceptualization of bee movement on flowers differs from (but is
   not mutually exclusive of) resource-driven optimal foraging models, and
   is useful for predicting geitonogamy.}},

Abstract = {{Trade-offs between Rower size and number seem likely to influence the
   evolution of floral display and are an important assumption of several
   theoretical models. We assessed floral trade-offs by imposing two
   generations of selection on Rower size and number in a greenhouse
   population of bee-pollinated Eichhornia paniculata. We established a
   control line and two replicate selection lines of 100 plants each for
   large flowers (S+), small flowers (S-), and many flowers per
   inflorescence (N+). We compared realized heritabilities and genetic
   correlations with estimates based on restricted-maximum-likelihood
   (REML) analysis of pedigrees. Responses to selection confirmed REML
   heritability estimates (flower size, h(2) = 0.48; daily flower number,
   h(2) = 0.10; total flower number, h(2) = 0.23). Differences in nectar,
   pollen, and ovule production between S+ and S- lines supported an
   overall divergence in investment per flower. Both realized and REML
   estimates of the generic correlation between daily and total flower
   number were r = 1.0. However, correlated responses to selection were
   inconsistent in their support of a trade-off. In both S- lines,
   correlated increases in flower number indicated a genetic correlation of
   r = -0.6 between flower size and number. In contrast, correlated
   responses in N+ and Sf lines were not significant, although flower size
   decreased in one N+ line. In addition, REML estimates of genetic
   correlations between flower size and number were positive, and did not
   differ from zero when variation in leaf area and age at first flowering
   were taken into account. These results likely reflect the combined
   effects of variation in genes controlling the resources available for
   flowering and genes with opposing effects on flower size and number. Our
   results suggest that the short-term evolution of floral display is not:
   necessarily constrained by trade-offs between Rower size and number, as
   is often assumed.}},

Abstract = {{Among- and within-population variation at neutral loci is governed by an

   by substantial levels of gene flow, but also that seed production may be
   the result of self-fertilization to a considerable extent. We examined
   the genetic structure of 21 C. bulbosa populations in northern Sweden by
   F-statistics analyses of variation at three polymorphic allozyme loci.
   Four populations each consisted of two or three distinct patches, which
   also allowed us to evaluate among-patch differentiation. The inbreeding
   coefficient over all loci within populations was high (F-IS=0.283).
   F-statistics indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among
   patches within populations varied among populations. F-ST among patches
   within populations ranged between -0.021 and 0.119 and was significantly
   different from zero in two of the populations. There was low to moderate
   genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST=0.072). A Mantel test
   indicated a positive correlation between geographical and genetic
   distances among populations, but this correlation was dependent on the
   difference in allele frequencies between the southernmost population
   sampled and all other populations. Self-fertilization and substructuring
   within sampling units (within patches and populations) may have
   contributed to the high inbreeding coefficients observed in many C.

Abstract = {{In selected foraging habitats of an agricultural landscape flower visits
   of bumblebees and community structure of foraging bumblebees were
   studied, with special regard to the role of crops as super-abundant
   resources. Most crops represent temporal foraging habitats with high
   abundance of bumblebees but mainly with low diversity in the bumblebee
   forage community, in contrast to permanent foraging habitats such as,
   for example, a hedgerow. The high numbers of bumblebees in the
   monoculture of crop plantations consisted mainly of short-tongued
   bumblebee species. The role of foraging distances for the visitation
   rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture-recapture
   experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius
   and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as
   the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more
   restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging
   activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B.
   terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant
   resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of
   highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably
   only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances,
   such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare,
   long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting
   and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one
   important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator
   limitation in modern agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, long-distance
   flights of bumblebee pollinators have to be considered in the present
   discussion on gene flow from transgenic plant species on a landscape

   Solidago spathulata DC., Juncus lesueurii Bolander, and mosses; negative
   associations with Carer obnupta L. Bailey and Lathyrus littoralis
   (Nuttall) Endlicher. Nest density and total plant cover were not
   significantly correlated. Nests were generally not constructed near the
   bee's host plants. Most nesting occurred in a zone transitional between
   mesic lowlands and xeric higher elevations. Natural successional change
   was increasing nesting habitat, but climax shore pine-spruce forest
   should eventually eliminate nesting habitat in the long term if
   succession is not disturbed. The introduced plants Lupinus arboreus Sims

   spent more time attempting to insert their bills into them. Once their

   that a bird was positioned under a flower's anthers. Unlike the
   conventional view of hummingbird-flower evolution, which argues for the
   loss or reduction of lips, our results suggest that lower lips may be

   preadaptations that act as nectar guides for hummingbirds and

Abstract = {{Pollinator selectivity is thought to influence the evolution of separate
   sexes in plants because of its potential to limit plant reproductive
   success. Selective visitation could also constrain or promote the
   phenotypic divergence of the sexes. In this study, I explored the causes
   and consequences of selectivity by generalist pollinators of a
   gynodioecious wild strawberry (Fragaria virginiana) and thus provide
   insight into potential pollinator-mediated selection for dioecy and
   sexual dimorphism. I found that flowers of F. virginiana show pronounced
   sexual dimorphism in petal length, stamen length, nectar and pollen
   production, and that this results in dramatic and consistent levels of
   sex-differential visitation by ants, bees, and flies. I performed
   manipulations of hermaphrodite flowers to understand the basis of
   selectivity and found that much of bee and fly preference for
   hermaphrodite flowers derived from their strong preference for longer
   petals, but also from a more subtle preference for pollen-filled
   anthers. These studies also revealed that other traits contribute to the
   observed discrimination against females. A stronger relationship existed
   between bee visitation and pollen receipt in females than between bee
   visitation and pollen removal from hermaphrodites. An analysis of
   natural variation in petal and stamen length confirmed the central role
   of petal length and also showed a lack of an effect of vestigial stamen
   length in pollination success of females. It also revealed a significant
   effect of stamen length, but not of petal length, on pollen removal. The
   data suggest that pollinator selectivity may affect the evolution of
   floral sexual dimorphism, both by exerting selection that could lead to
   the maintenance of stamens in females and by exerting selection to
   increase petal length in females.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of nectar robbers on plants and their mutualistic
   pollinators are poorly understood due, in part, to the paucity of
   studies examining male reproductive success in nectar-robbed plants.
   Here we measured the effects of a nectar-robbing bumblebee, Bombus
   occidentalis, on realized male reproductive success (seeds sired) in a
   hummingbird-pollinated plant, Ipomopsis aggregata. To determine the
   effects of nectar robbing on paternity, we used a series of experimental
   populations of plants containing a known allozyme marker. In each
   population, we experimentally controlled the levels of nectar robbing on
   each I. aggregata plant by cutting a hole in the corolla with dissecting
   scissors and removing nectar with a micro-capillary tube. We measured
   hummingbird-pollinator foraging behavior and fruit and seed production
   (maternal function) for each plant. We then genotyped seeds for the
   allozyme marker to determine the number of seeds sired by plants with
   known levels of robbing. Heavy nectar robbing (>80\% of flowers robbed)
   significantly reduced the number of seeds sired, as well as the number
   of seeds produced due to pollinator avoidance of heavily robbed plants.
   Total plant reproduction, both male and female contributions, were
   reduced by 50\% due to high levels of robbing. To date, no other studies
   have measured the effects of nectar robbing on realized male function
   (number of seeds sired). Ours is the first study to demonstrate that
   robbing can simultaneously decrease realized male reproductive success
   as well as female reproductive success, and that the effects are
   incurred indirectly through pollinator avoidance of robbed plants.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses the pollination ecology of shrub species in an
   upper montane forest in Costa Rica, where the diversity of insect
   visitors is much below that of the well-studied tropical forests of
   lower elevations. Data are presented on visitation rates by the tropical
   bumblebee Bombus ephippiatus to flowers of three species, pollen loads
   on bumblebee bodies, and pollen loads on stigmas of two of` the species.
   High visitation rates to flowers of Palicourea brenesii were found, a
   species which produces copious amounts of nectar. Visitation rates to
   nectarless Leandra subseriata and Deppea grandiflora were much lower.
   Conspecific pollen comprised on average 90\% of the pollen load on
   stigmas of Leandra, while Palicourea stigmas carried only 26 to 55\%
   conspecific pollen, With only two ovules per flower, fruit and seed set
   in Palicourea were not limited by a shortage of conspecific pollen. In
   Leandra, 20-25\% of the flowers received too few conspecific pollen
   grains for maximum seed set among 440 ovules per flower. Individual
   bumblebees showed no constancy in plant choice, judging from the high
   number of different pollen types (6-12) on their bodies. Workers
   returned frequently to the same Palicourea patch without visiting nearby
   Palicourea plants, which suggests the use of foraging paths.}},

Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{1 Theoretical models indicate that coexistence of diploid and polyploid
   individuals in sympatric populations is unlikely when mating is random
   among cytotypes and hybrids are inviable. However, coexistence may be
   facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype
   mating and increase assortative mating.
   2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in
   Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral
   morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a
   mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also
   calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of
   the frequency of triploid offspring.
   3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as
   shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly
   taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers
   per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering
   periods overlapped by 51\%, with diploid stems flowering earlier.
   4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering
   simultaneously, only 26\% of all bee flights were between flowers on
   different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15\%
   were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering
   asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for
   intercytotype mating from 49\% expected if mating is random to about 2\%
   of the total number of pollinator flights.
   5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator
   flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of
   cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation
   plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period
   when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6\%, similar to the proportion
   of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4\%).
   6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour las
   influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic
   mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the
   maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators of gender dimorphic (e.g., gynodioecious or dioecious)
   species often show a preference for hermaphrodite or male flowers over
   conspecific Females, and such pollinator selectivity can have
   implications for the evolution of sexual dimorphism. However, because
   the sex morphs differ in several floral Features, it is not readily
   apparent which specific traits generate differential pollinator service.
   In this study, we sought to understand the basis of pollinator
   preferences for hermaphrodites to females of gynodioecious Fragaria
   virginiana. We extend a previous study that revealed that lack of
   pollen-filled anthers and shorter petals were not solely responsible for
   small bee and fly discrimination against females, by investigating the
   roles of other morphological Features, reward characters, and floral
   context in bringing about pollinator discrimination. Using floral
   manipulations we revealed that small bees preferentially visit flowers
   with wide petals, more nectar, intact stamens, as well as flowers
   located in hermaphrodite-dominated patches. Specifically, bees were able
   to remotely detect nectar presence. In addition, bees were attracted to
   both the anther sac and the filament regions of the stamen, indicating
   that not only anthers: but also filaments may function as visual or
   olfactory cues to pollen reward. Furthermore, pollinator preference for
   flowers in hermaphrodite-dominated patches serves to intensify their
   discrimination against female flowers which occur predominantly in
   female-dominated patches. For the most part, preferences of flies
   mirrored those of the bees with the exception that flies also showed a
   significant preference for flowers held high over those held closer to
   the ground. These results indicate that a suite of character differences
   contributes to pollinators' preferences for hermaphrodite to female
   flowers. Furthermore. they suggest pollinators could mediate selection
   on both floral morphology and reward in this species.}},

Abstract = {{In southern England, Linaria vulgaris (common yellow toadflax) suffers
   from high rates of nectar robbery by bumblebees. In a wild population of
   L. vulgaris we found that 96 \% of open flowers were robbed. Five
   species of bumblebee were observed foraging on these flowers, although
   short-tongued species (Bambus lapidarius, B. lucorum and B, terrestris)
   robbed nectar whilst longer-tongued ones behaved as legitimate
   pollinators (B. hortorum and B. pascuorum). Nectar rewards were highly
   variable; on average there was less nectar in robbed than in unrobbed
   flowers, but this difference was not statistically significant. The
   proportion of flowers containing no nectar was significantly higher for
   robbed flowers compared with unrobbed flowers. Secondary robbers and
   legitimate pollinators had similar handling times on flowers and,
   assuming they select flowers at random to forage on, received
   approximately the same nectar profit per minute, largely because most
   flowers had been robbed. There was no significant difference in the
   number of seeds in pods of robbed flowers and in pods of flowers that
   were artificially protected against robbing. However, more of the robbed
   dowers set at least some seed than the unrobbed flowers, possibly as a
   consequence of the experimental manipulation. We suggest that nectar
   robbing has little effect on plant fecundity because legitimate foragers
   are present in the population, and that seed predation and seed abortion
   after fertilization may be more important factors in limiting seed
   production in this species. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales

Abstract = {{This paper examines the hypothesis that nectar robbing can affect plant
   reproductive success either positively or negatively. To this end. I
   investigated various aspects of the pollination ecology of a population
   of the herb Anthyllis vulneraria subsp. vulgaris in northwest Spain over
   5 yr. By observing floral visitors, I found that the most important
   pollinator species was the long-tongued bee Anthophora acervorum, which
   accounted for similar to 45\% of recorded insect visits. However, just
   over 45\% of visits were by the nectar-robbing bumble bees Bombus
   terrestris and B. jonellus. Although the incidence of robbing differed
   considerably over 5 yr of study, the frequency in every season was very
   high (66.4-76.5\% of robbing) except for 1997 (0\% robbing). Despite
   this high frequency of robbing, robbed flowers had a higher probability
   of setting fruit than nonrobbed flowers in all years of the study (mean:
   82.0 vs. 51.0\%; excluding 1997). This increased fruit set in robbed
   flowers is directly related to bumble bee behavior because the robbers'
   bodies came into contact with both the anthers and stigmas while
   robbing. Thus, the robbers effect pollination. These results suggest
   that the effect of nectar robbers on plant reproductive success is
   dependent both on the robbers' behavior and on flower/inflorescence
   structure. The importance of nectar-robbing bumble bees on the
   reproductive success of A. vulneraria and its yearly high frequency
   suggest that the relationship between robbers and this plant is part of
   a successful long-term mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{We studied nectar production characteristics (volume, sugar

   significantly Less concentrated nectar than did the bee-pollinated A.
   sylvatica (7.81 +/- 0.46 mu l vs. 0.99 +/- 0.08 mu l, mean +/- SE, and
   28.9 +/- 0.4\% vs. 50.3 +/- 0.5\%); sugar output for A. pavia was also
   significantly higher than in A. sylvatica (3.53 +/- 0.33 mg vs. 0.84 +/-
   0.04 mg). Plants sampled from a natural hybrid swarm were intermediate
   between the parental species with respect to nectar volume (5.85 +/-
   0.14 mu l) and sugar output (1.76 +/- 0.04 mg), but they produced nectar
   with significantly lower sugar concentration than both parental species
   (24.3 +/- 0.2\%). In Iris. the bird-pollinated T. fulva produced
   significantly smaller volumes of significantly less concentrated nectar
   than did the bee-pollinated I. brevicaulis (20.4 +/- 2.5 mu l vs. 56.6
   +/- 6.0 mu l, and 18.3 +/- 0.6\% vs. 23.6 +/- 0.3\%). The net result was
   significantly lower sugar output for I. fulva as compared to I.
   brevicaulis (4.3 =/- 0.6 mg vs. 14.7 +/- 1.7 mg). Regardless of which
   parental species served as the maternal parent, experimentally generated
   F-1 interspecific hybrids were almost perfectly intermediate between
   their parental species with respect to nectar volume (36.6 +/- 4.2 mu l
   and 36.2 +/- 2.1 mu l) and sugar output (9.8 +/- 0.7 mg and 9.8 +/- 1.4
   mg), but their mean concentration was more similar to that of I.
   brevicaulis (23.3 +/- 0.3\% and 24.0 +/- 0.4\%). It is unclear whether
   or not pollinator-mediated selection has shaped and/or maintained the
   large differences in nectar characteristics between these species.}},

Abstract = {{Different methods are used to study the incidence of genetically
   modified oilseed rape on honeybees, that depend on the type of transgene
   and on the transformation induced in the plant. Two examples are chosen
   to present risk assessment procedures. One deals with oilseed rape
   resistant to pest insects (by expressing protease inhibitors PI), the
   other concerns oilseed rape tolerant to an herbicide (glufosinate). In
   the first case, the aim is to ensure the safety of honeybees. First, the
   occurrence of the transgene product in nectar and pollen is checked and
   the foraging behaviour on the plants is observed Second, the effects of
   various concentrations, equal or higher than those expressed in the
   plant, is evaluated under laboratory conditions. Thus, acute and chronic
   toxicity, individual learning behaviour and life span of workers exposed
   to the PI is investigated. Experiments are also carried out to examine
   the effects on the colony activity and development. In addition,
   indirect effect related to secondary changes in plant signals cueing
   bees visits are examined in the second case, the aim is to assess the
   risk for transgene dispersal in the environment, mediated by honeybees,
   It is unlikely that tolerance to herbicide has toxic effects, but a
   pleitropic effect of the transgene could effect the value and
   attractiveness of the plants. So, pollen and nectar production, flower
   size and density are evaluated and experiments are carried out in the
   field to study the foraging behaviour In particular, the ability of
   honeybees to cross-visit transgenic and traditional oilseed rape or
   oilseed rape and weedy relatives is observed. Both types of studies show
   how complementary methods and collaborations between teams have been
   designed to study various aspects of the impact of genetic engineered
   oilseed rape on honeybees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen can function as a vehicle to disseminate introduced, genetically
   engineered genes throughout a plant population or into a related
   species. The measurement of the risk of inadvertent dispersal of
   transgenes must include the assessment of accidental dispersion of
   pollen. Factors to be considered include the rate of pollen spread, the
   maximal dispersion distance of pollen, and the spatial dynamics of
   pollen movement within seed production fields; none of which are known
   for alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), an insect-pollinated crop species.
   Using a rare, naturally occurring molecular marker, alfalfa pollen
   movement was tracked from seed and hay production fields. Results
   indicated that leafcutter bees ((Megachile spp.) used in commercial seed
   production show a directional, non-random bias when pollinating within
   fields, primarily resulting in the movement of pollen directly towards
   and away from the bee domicile. Within-field pollen movement was
   detected only over distances of 4 m or less. Dispersal of pollen from
   alfalfa hay and seed production fields occurs at distances up to 1000 m.
   By examining widely dispersed, individual escaped alfalfa plants and
   their progeny using RAPD markers, gene movement among escaped alfalfa
   plants has been confirmed for distances up to 230 m. The outcrossing
   frequency for large fields was nearly 10-times greater than that of
   research-sized plots. A minimum isolation distance of 1557 m may be
   required to prevent gene flow in alfalfa. Data suggest that complete
   containment of transgenes within alfalfa seed or hay production fields
   would be highly unlikely using current production practices.}},

Abstract = {{Nuphar comprises 13 species of aquatic perennials distributed in the
   temperate Northern Hemisphere. The European species N. lutea and N.
   pumila in Norway, the Netherlands, and Germany are pollinated by bees
   and flies, including apparent Nuphar specialists. This contrasts with
   reports of predominant beetle pollination in American N. advena and N.
   polysepala. We studied pollination in N. ozarkana in Missouri and N.
   avena in Texas to assess whether (1) there is evidence of pollinator
   shifts associated with floral-morphological differences between Old
   World and New World species as hypothesized by Padgett, Les, and Crow
   (American Journal of Botany 86: 1316-1324. 1999) and (2) whether beetle
   pollination characterizes American species of Nuphar. Ninety-seven and
   67\% of flower visits in the two species were by sweat bees, especially
   Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) nelumbonis. Syrphid fly species visiting both
   species were Paragus sp., Chaleosyrphus metallicus, and Toxomerus
   geminatus. The long-horned leaf beetle Donacia piscatrix was common on
   leaves and stems of N. ozarkana but rarely visited flowers. Fifteen
   percent of visits to N. advena flowers were by D. piscatrix and D.
   texana. The beetles' role as pollinators was investigated experimentally
   by placing floating mesh cages that excluded flies and bees over N.
   advena buds about to open and adding beetles. Beetles visited 40\% of
   the flowers in cages, and flowers that received visits had 69\% seed
   set, likely due to beetle-mediated geitonogamy of 1st-d flowers.
   Experimentally outcrossed 1st-d flowers had 62\% seed set, and
   open-pollinated flowers 76\%: 2nd-d selfed or outcrossed flowers had low
   seed sets (9 and 12\%. respectively). Flowers are strongly protogynous
   and do not self spontaneously. Flowers shielded from pollinators set no
   seeds. A comparison of pollinator spectra in the two Old World and three
   New World Nuphar species studied so far suggests that the relative
   contribution of flies, bees, and beetles to pollen transfer in any one
   population depends more on these insects' relative abundances (and in
   the case of Donacia. presence) and alternative food sources than on
   stamen length differences between Old World and New World pond-lilies.}},

Abstract = {{It is usually assumed that the choice behavior of bees for floral colors
   is influenced by innate preferences only for the first flower visits
   prior to any experience. After visits to rewarding flowers bees learn to
   associate their colors with a reward. This learning process leads to an
   acquired preference for the trained colors that has been believed to
   dominate over previous experiences and over innate preferences. This
   work investigates how bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) chose among
   artificial flowers of different colors after they had been extensively
   trained to other colors. The bees chose novel colors according to their
   similarity to the trained color if the trained color was similar to some
   of the test colors. This was true also if trained colors and test colors
   were well distinguished, so their color choice reflected generalization
   between colors. If the test colors were so different from the trained
   color that no generalization tool; place, choice behavior was not
   affected by the trained color and reflected innate preferences. The
   differences in choice frequencies could not be explained by physical
   properties of the test colors other than the dominant wavelength, a
   parameter taken to reflect hue perception. Preferred dominant
   wavelengths correspond to those observed in naive bumble bees and
   honeybees. Thus bumble bees show innate preferences for certain colors
   not only prior to color learning but also after intensive learning when
   choosing among very different novel colors. Color choice among similar
   colors, however, is controlled by generalization from the learned color.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation has the potential to affect plant reproduction by
   changing the community of pollinators and natural enemies, the
   neighborhood of potential mates, the availability of resources, and
   microclimate. I examined the effect of habitat fragmentation on
   reproduction of four species found in mallee woodlands of central New
   South Wales, Australia: Acacia brachybotrya, Senna artemisioides,
   Eremophila glabra, and Dianella revoluta. At six sites I surveyed plants
   in a reserve and in a nearby linear strip of vegetation. Two additional
   sites were established in a large reserve. Many effects were apparent at
   the extreme end of fragmentation, revealed by two-way analysis of
   covariance comparing reserves and linear strips at each site. The nature
   of the response differed among species. Flower production was greater in
   most linear strip fragments for S. artemisioides and E. glabra. Fruit
   set efficiency was significantly greater in linear strips for S.
   artemisioides and significantly lower for A. brachybotrya, E. glabra,
   and D. revoluta. Fruit predation was lower in most linear strips for E.
   glabra. For A. brachybotrya, fruit predation was significantly lower in
   linear strips. The net effect of these changes was a significant
   increase in whole-plant seed production for S. artemisioides, a
   significant decrease in whole-plant seed production for A. brachybotrya
   and in whole-plant fruit production for D. revoluta, and no consistent
   effect on whole-plant fruit production for E. glabra. In contrast, the
   only pattern apparent when the effect of fragment size was considered
   over a range from linear strips <40 m wide to a reserve >140,000 ha was
   a positive correlation between the fragment size and fruit-set
   efficiency of A. brachybotrya. These results suggest that habitat
   fragmentation can significantly alter important reproductive functions
   of species, by changing both the plant's physical environment and its
   interactions with animals.}},

   Dummies scented with cuticle extracts of virgin females or of O.
   sphegodes labellum extracts elicited significantly more male reactions
   than odorless dummies. Therefore, copulation behavior eliciting
   semiochemicals are located on the surface of the females' cuticle and
   the surface of the flowers. Within bee and orchid samples, n-alkanes and
   n-alkenes, aldehydes, esters, all-trans-farnesol and all-trans-farnesyl
   hexanoate triggered electroantennographic responses in male antennae.
   Most of the alkanes and alkenes occurred in similar patterns both in the
   bees and orchids. O. sphegodes leaf extracts contained mostly the same
   compounds but in different proportions. In behavioral tests with
   synthetic compounds, blends of alkenes triggered significantly more
   approaches and pounces of the males whereas alkanes were not more

   small effective size of population and genetic drift are of utmost
   importance, was lower than the other outbreeding plants. The calculated
   GST indicated a high level of genetic differentiation among populations,
   suggesting that gene flow was limited. The dendrogram based on Nei's
   genetic distance showed that the Pu-an and the Koe-san populations fell
   into two distinct groups, which were consistent with geographic distance
   and distribution. It was probable that in the populations of A.
   distichum sexually reproduced individuals rarely become established
   within the populations. From observations, Lassioglossum bee was found
   to be the most effective pollinator of A. distichum. Artificial crossing
   experiment indicated that pollinators contributed considerably to

   reduce fitness of A. distichum in wild populations. The management of

   the low pollination efficiency of a diversus, based on the finding that
   the low average seed set of I. umbrosus did not require a definite
   morphological match between flowers and pollinators, and did not require
   very frequent visitations to each flower. In other words, Isodon
   umbrosus could briefly maintain constant seed production under the

Abstract = {{The yellow-flowered monkshood Aconitum lycoctonum has variable degrees
   of inbreeding among populations, despite being primarily bee-pollinated.
   Here we examined the pollination ecology of A. lycoctonum. We
   investigated pollinator community and frequency in four populations at
   two altitudes over two years. We found that flowers were more often
   visited at low elevation than at high elevation. However, because
   flowers lived longer at high elevation than at low elevation, and plants
   at high elevation had more flowers than at low elevation, the overall
   chance of a plant being visited may be greater at high elevation.
   Breeding system experiments showed that at least some populations of A.
   lycoctonum were self-compatible and also were not completely
   protandrous. Thus selfing, especially by geitonogamous pollen, will be
   common if pollinators often visit several Bowers within a plant, as we
   found to be true for the main pollinator (bumblebees) of A. lycoctonum.
   Although the stereotypical behavior of bees is to move upwards, 17\% of
   the within-plant movements of the main pollinator (Bombus gerstaeckeri)
   were downwards, i.e. from a male-phased to a female-phased flower
   because the flowers open from the bottom to the top of the plant. Other
   pollinators of A. lycoctonum moved less often within plants. We conclude
   that in addition to differences in self-compatibility, differences in
   pollinator abundance and behavior could have led to variation in the
   realized mating system in different A. lycoctonum populations.}},

Abstract = {{In snapdragon flowers, the volatile ester methyl benzoate is the most
   abundant scent compound. It is synthesized by and emitted from only the
   upper and lower lobes of petals, where pollinators (bumblebees) come in
   contact with the flower. Emission of methyl benzoate occurs in a
   rhythmic manner, with maximum emission during the day, which correlates
   with pollinator activity. A novel S-adenosyl-L-methionine:benzoic acid
   carboxyl methyl transferase (BAMT), the final enzyme in the biosynthesis
   of methyl benzoate, and its corresponding cDNA have been isolated and
   characterized. The complete amino acid sequence of the BAMT protein has
   only low levels of sequence similarity to other previously characterized
   proteins, including plant O-methyl transferases. During the life span of
   the flower, the levels of methyl benzoate emission, BAMT activity, BAMT
   gene expression, and the amounts of BAMT protein and benzoic acid are
   developmentally and differentially regulated. Linear regression analysis
   revealed that production of methyl benzoate is regulated by the amount
   of benzoic acid and the amount of BAMT protein, which in turn is
   regulated at the transcriptional level.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of pollination ecology have been hindered by an absence of
   biochemical information about the basis of polymorphism. Using model
   plants and mutant lines described by molecular genetics may circumvent
   this difficulty. Mutation of genes controlling petal colour and petal
   epidermal cell shape in Antirrhinum majus was previously shown to
   influence fruit set. White flowers set less fruit than magenta flowers
   and mutants with flat petal epidermal cells set less fruit than flowers
   with conical cells. Here we analyse the causal pathway underlying this
   phenomenon through a study of floral characteristics and bee behaviour.
   Results indicate that bees recognized plants with magenta conical-celled
   flowers at a distance and did not approach white flowers or magenta
   flat-celled flowers so frequently. Petal cell shape interacted with
   colour in determining whether an approaching bee landed on a flower
   within a plot and whether a bee landing on a flower would probe it. The
   intrafloral temperature of flowers with conical petal cells was shown to
   increase with solar irradiance, unlike the intrafloral temperature of
   flowers with flat petal cells. The difference in fruit set may reflect
   pollinator discrimination between genotypes as a consequence of the
   effect of intrafloral temperature on nectar quality and quantity.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic constraints on insects in alpine environments have important
   consequences for the biology of their plant mutualists; in particular,
   reduced insect diversity and activity in alpine plant populations can
   result in pollinator-limited seed set and, potentially, in low genetic

   populations can compensate for low visitation rates. In this study we
   hypothesized that, because of highly effective pollination by
   bumblebees, alpine populations of Campanula rotundifolia would not
   experience more frequent cycles of pollinator limitation than
   low-elevation populations and would therefore exhibit comparable levels
   of genetic variability and inbreeding to those found in foothill
   populations. Enzyme electrophoresis was used to assess genetic
   variability at nine putative loci in alpine and foothill populations of
   C. rotundifolia in Colorado. Genetic variability in C. rotundifolia was
   found to be comparable to that reported for other long-lived herbaceous
   perennials. Measures of genetic variability and fixation indices did not
   differ between high- and low-elevation populations and were consistent

Abstract = {{Few studies have surveyed the insects visiting flowers at many sites and
   for many related species. Calochortus, a genus of about 60 species with
   its center of diversity in California, has flowers with a wide range of
   appearances. Insects visiting Calochortus flowers in 25 species were
   censused at 40 sites. Visitors at coflowering plants were also censused
   at each site. Calochortus flowers attracted insects in several orders,
   especially beetles that feed at glands on the petals and bees that often
   collect pollen. Species in Calochortus section Calochortus had a
   somewhat narrower spectrum of visitors than species in section Mariposa.
   The diversity of visitor species at Mariposa flowers was often greater
   than the diversity at coflowering species. On the whole, Calochortus
   flowers seem to be generalists in terms of their pollinators.
   Differences in visitor assemblage were greater between Calochortus
   populations at different sites than between visitors to Calochortus
   versus coflowering species at a site. Nevertheless, there were always
   significant differences in the proportions of various insects at
   Calochortus versus coflowering plants. In addition, proportions of
   visitors also differed between species of Calochortus at the same site.
   Thus, Calochortus flowers have diverged in the visitors they attract,
   and evidently they have done so without permanently specializing (except
   to a limited degree at the sectional level). What we know of the
   radiation of Calochortus lilies is consistent with an interpretation of
   adaptive wandering through a spatiotemporal mosaic of pollinator
   communities.}},

   simulating a 15\% ozone depletion over Patras (38.3 degrees N, 29.1

   true pollinators (bees) and nectar thieves. The frequency of visits to
   both control and UV-B treated plants was the same and independent of
   whether the UV-B tubes were on or off during video recording. UV-B
   radiation had no effect on gross floral morphology (petal surface area,
   number of pollen grains, stamens and ovules, optical properties of
   petals and stamens), yet nectary size was almost doubled. In addition,
   the duration of insect visits was significantly longer on UV-B treated
   plants, provided that the UV-B tubes were off during monitoring. The
   differences were abolished during the part of the day that the tubes
   were on, indicating that the insects were annoyed by supplemental UV-B
   radiation. These results are consistent with the nectaries producing
   larger quantities of nectar, which caused the insects to stay longer on

   scarabaeid and six meloid species, some of which were anthophilous
   species. Various fluctuation patterns were observed among the beetle
   species in aspects of both seasonality and correlation with the
   supraannual phenological pattern. Three large chafer species

   a clear seasonal population pattern and hardly fluctuated annually.
   Populations of an anthophilous scarabaeid species, Parastasia
   bimaculata, a specific pollinator of Homalomena propinqua (Araceae),
   hardly fluctuated, probably because of its response to the constant
   flowering of its floral hosts. Monthly catches of an anthophilous
   scarabaeid, Anomala sp., and meloid beetles showed clear supraannual
   patterns in response to the general flowering and were significantly
   correlated with the flowering intensity with or without a lag of a

Abstract = {{The flowers of Helicteres isora are large, bisexual and zygomorphic with

   with a short style ending in a simple stigma projects beyond the anthers
   and stays in an erect position. The flowers open daily at 0300-0330 h
   and are visited by birds and insects during daytime. The flowers
   characteristically change their colour, being bluish-grey on day one
   (d(1)), changing to light red on day two (d(2)) and dark red on day
   three (d(3)). Birds collect nectar more frequently from d(2) and d(3)
   flowers. Bees collect nectar and pollen mostly from d(1) flowers. The
   flowers are not apomictic, but compatible for auto-, geitono- and
   xenogamy. The bees Ceratina and Trigona mediate autogamy and geitonogamy
   by remaining mostly on the same flower while Pseudapis and Amegilla
   promote xenogamy by their frequent inter-tree movement. The birds quaker
   babbler Alcippe poioicephala and Indian myna Acridotheres tristis
   largely promote xenogamy because stigma receptivity continues up to the
   second day of flower life. Since the two bird species implicated in
   pollination are not entirely nectarivorous, total dependence on them for
   pollination may not be an ideal strategy, and receiving
   pollen-collecting bees may help in the reproduction of H. isora. Floral
   damage caused by the red-vented bulbul, Pycnonotus cafer and by the
   blister beetle and the insect larvae is detrimental to H. isora
   reproduction. Natural fruit production is very low which may be due to
   the in-adequancy of pollinators.}},

   P. pinifolius were 30\% narrower than those of P. barbatus, but they
   were similar in tube length. Although a narrower corolla appeared to
   decrease access by large insects, small halictid bees were the only

   Species differences in nectar production rate and concentration were
   minor, being smaller than within-species differences between dry and
   rainy periods. Taller inflorescences and a wider corolla tube may
   contribute to greater hummingbird use of P, barbatus. Penstemon
   pinifolius was fully self-compatible and weakly autogamous, whereas P.

   Exclusion of hummingbirds reduced seed set fourfold in both species,
   supporting the inference from morphology and rewards that hummingbirds
   are the primary pollinators. In the absence of hummingbirds, halictids
   increased the seed set of P. barbatus relative to exclusion of all
   visitors, but they did not increase the seed set of P. pinifolius.
   Despite sharing the basic set of hummingbird-syndrome traits, the two
   species differed in degree of investment in individual flowers and in
   adaptations for outcrossing.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator preference may influence the origin and dynamics of plant
   hybrid zones. Natural hybrid populations between the red-flowered Iris
   fulva and the blue-flowered Iris brevicaulis are found in southern
   Louisiana. The genetic structure of these populations reflects a lack of
   intermediate genotypes. We observed pollinator behaviour in an
   experimental array with five plants each of I. fulva, I. brevicaulis,
   their F-1, and the first backcross generation in each direction, to
   obtain data on flower type preferences and transitions between flower
   types. The most abundant visitors were Ruby-throated Hummingbirds
   (Archilochus colubris) and workers of the bumblebee Bombus
   pennsylvanicus. Hummingbirds visited I. fulva twice as often as I.
   brevicaulis and visited hybrids at intermediate frequencies. Bumblebee
   workers preferred the purple-flowered F(1)s and visited plants of I.
   fulva and the backcross to I. fulva more often than I. brevicaulis and
   its backcross. Overall, F-1 flowers were visited most frequently. Both
   hummingbirds and bumblebees visited nearest neighbours in almost 80\% of
   the interplant movements. This meant that a majority of movements were
   between different flower types, rather than between plants of the same
   type. Findings from the present study suggest that pollinator preference
   is not a major causal factor for the lack of intermediate genotypes in
   natural iris hybrid populations. Instead, pollinator behaviour in our
   array promoted mixed mating between flower types belonging to different
   pollination syndromes. However, owing to predominant nearest-neighbour
   visitation, the spatial distribution of parental and hybrid genotypes
   (in concert with pollinator behaviour) will have a strong influence on
   mating patterns and thus the genotypic structure and evolution of
   Louisiana iris hybrid zones.}},

Abstract = {{Many insects which gather nectar or pollen exhibit flower constancy, a
   learned fidelity to a particular species of plant. Recent studies
   suggest that foraging insects may use a perceptual mechanism akin to a
   search image to detect Bowers, in a manner analogous to the way that
   predators search for prey. This has emerged as an alternative (but not
   mutually exclusive) explanation for flower constancy to that proposed by
   Darwin, who suggested that it may result from a limited ability to
   learning or remember the handling skills appropriate for particular
   flowers. However, search images are thought to be a mechanism for
   locating cryptic prey. Plants which are pollinated by animals have
   evolved brightly coloured flowers Co attract the attention of their
   pollinators. It thus seems implausible to argue that flowers may
   actually be cryptic. One possible explanation for this apparent
   contradiction is that flowers are effectively cryptic when Viewed
   against a background which contains many other flowers of similar
   colour. I present experimental evidence which suggests that a background
   of flowers of similar colour does reduce foraging efficiency of
   bumblebees, but that a background of dissimilarly coloured flowers has
   no effect. This I interpret as evidence that flowers may be cryptic,
   suggesting that pollinators may indeed use a search image in location of
   flowers. However, the relative importance of constraints on foragers'
   abilities to locate flowers versus their abilities to handle them as
   causes of flower constancy remain to be elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Many co-sexual plants segregate female and male function among flowers
   on an inflorescence through dichogamy or the production of unisexual
   flowers. Sexual segregation may reduce self-pollination among flowers
   within inflorescences (geitonogamy), thereby increasing the pollen
   available for export to other plants. To assess these complementary
   roles we manipulated the simultaneously hermaphroditic (adichogamous)
   flowers of Eichhornia paniculata to produce ten-flowered inflorescences
   with either female above male flowers (female/male inflorescences) or
   male/female inflorescences, which competed for mating opportunities with
   five-flowered adichogamous inflorescences. Because of the upward
   movement of bumble-bees, selfing increased upward in adichogamous
   inflorescences (overall female selfing rate (s) over bar+/-s.e. =
   0.320+/-0.026). Female flowers of male/female inflorescences selfed less
   than flowers in corresponding positions in adichogamous inflorescences
   so (s) over bar fell to 0.135 +/- 0.027. In contrast, all-female flowers
   of female/male inflorescences selfed similarly to upper flowers on
   adichogamous inflorescences, elevating (s) over bar (0.437 +/- 0.043).
   During 1997, male/female inflorescences sired more outcrossed seeds than
   female/male or adichogamous inflorescences, whereas during 1994 flowers
   on male/female inflorescences received fewer visits than those of
   adichogamous inflorescences, reducing their outcross siring success.
   Hence, sexual segregation limits geitonogamy and enhances outcross
   siring success when it does nor affect pollinator behaviour,
   illustrating the importance of both female and male function in
   inflorescence design.}},

Abstract = {{Polyploid evolution is often considered a mechanism of instant
   speciation; yet the establishment of rare tetraploids within diploid
   populations may be constrained by a frequency-dependent mating
   disadvantage (minority cytotype exclusion principle). I tested this
   hypothesis using experimental populations of Chamerion angustifolium
   (Onagraceae) that contained different proportions of tetraploids and
   diploids. Fitness: measured as total seed production over the entire
   flowering season, was calculated from a census of flower number and
   estimates of ovule number per flower and proportion of seed set per
   fruit. The fitness of tetraploids relative to diploids was frequency
   dependent, increasing from 0.4, when tetraploids were rare, to 0.7 when
   at 50\% and 1.15 when they were in the majority (67\%). This pattern
   exists because of a negative relationship between tetraploid frequency
   and seed set per fruit in diploids. Seed set in tetraploids was
   independent of cytotype frequency. The frequency -independent effect in
   tetraploids reflects higher assortative mating, partly because of
   non-random patterns of bee visitation. Bees visited a disproportionately
   high number of diploid inflorescences; however, the proportion of
   successive flights between tetraploids increased above random
   expectations as the frequency of tetraploids decreased. These results
   provide the fir st experimental test of frequency-dependent fitness in

   specialization For creosote bush pollen has evolved repeatedly among
   bees in the Lower Sonoran and Mojave deserts. In these highly xeric,
   floristically depauperate environments, species of specialist bees
   surpass generalist bees in diversity, biomass and abundance. The ability
   of specialist bees to facultatively remain in diapause through
   resource-poor years and to emerge synchronously with host plant bloom in
   resource-rich years probably explains their ecological dominance and
   persistence in these areas. Repeated origins of pollen specialization to
   one host plant where bloom occurs least predictably is a counter-example
   to prevailing theories that postulate such traits originate where the
   plant grows best and blooms most reliably Host-plant synchronization, a
   paucity of alternative floral hosts, or flowering attributes of creosote

Abstract = {{Flowering phenology, floral morphology, nectar features (chemical
   composition, secretion pattern, standing crop, removal effects),
   breeding system, and flower visitors were analyzed in seven populations
   of Erythrina crista-galli from Argentina and Uruguay. Its flowering
   phenology corresponds to the sub-annual frequency class of Newstrom et
   al., with a major burst in November. Flowers lasted for 3 to 4 days and
   produced abundant hexose-dominant nectar with its chemical composition
   and concentration (ca. 22\%) constant across all flowering stages. Most
   of the total nectar was secreted by buds. When the flowers first opened,
   most (> 50\%) of the total nectar was available to pollinators. As
   flowers faded, a resorption period began. The overall sugar production
   was not affected by nectar removal. Hand crosses showed that this
   species is self-compatible. Crossed fruits showed significant
   differences from hand-selfed ones (autogamy and geitonogamy). Xenogamous
   fruits and seeds showed the highest values for many traits (fruit mass,
   total seeds per fruit mass, mean seed mass, and seed germination
   percentage). Approximately 6\% of the flowers set seeds in natural
   populations. Hymenopterans (carpenter bees and honeybees) and
   hummingbirds (four species) assiduously visited the trees in all the
   areas sampled and can be assumed pollinators. Almost 93\% of recorded
   flowers were visited by bees, with the rest visited by hummingbirds.
   Phylogenetically, this species was included in the basal clade for the
   genus and characterized as passerine/hummingbird pollinated. However, we
   found that not only birds but bees functioned as major pollinators. This
   observation may indicate that this basal clade may represent an
   intermediate step from entomophily (typical of tribe Phaseoleae) to
   ornithophily (typical of Erythrina).}},

Abstract = {{Successful long-term conservation and management of populations of
   plants requires successful management of the suite of factors that
   determine their `realised' mating systems. Within the genus Grevillea,
   mating systems are potentially complex. They may vary among species and
   among populations within a species, reflecting variation in pollinator
   behaviour and diversity ('potential' mating systems) and in breeding
   system (the `preferred' mating system). We used a combination of
   pollinator observations, pollination experiments and electrophoretic
   analysis of seed from open pollinations, to examine variation in
   potential and preferred mating systems in two populations of each of two
   `spider-flowered' Grevillea species: G. mucronulata (visited by
   honeyeaters and honeybees, although only birds effected pollen removal
   and transfer) and G. sphacelata (visited only by honeybees, which made
   frequent contact with pollen and stigmas). Almost all observed bird and
   insect foraging bouts on either species involved movements among
   inflorescences within plants or among inflorescences on closely
   neighbouring plants. On the basis of these data, the mating system was
   predicted to involve a high level of selfing or inbreeding. However, the
   pollination experiment revealed that both species were highly
   self-incompatible and showed a clear preference for outcross pollen in
   mate-choice experiments. For both species, fruit set through autogamy
   was lower than 0.7\% and fruit set from self-pollinations was always
   significantly lower than for outcross pollinations (0-11\% cf. 25-33\%
   for G. mucronulata and 0\% cf. 4.2-8.8\% for G. sphacelata). Allozyme
   studies revealed that genotypes in open-pollinated seeds on 20 G.
   mucronulata and 20 G. sphacelata plants were surprisingly uniform, best
   explained by outcrossed matings between close neighbours. We found
   little between-population variation in any aspect of the mating system
   for either species. These studies reveal that the preferred mating
   system of the plant and the pattern of pollinator behaviour interact to
   determine the mating system in a population, emphasising the need for a
   multifaceted investigation of mating systems, especially in predicting
   the fates of populations that have pollination systems altered by
   disturbance, small size, isolation and introduced species such as the
   honeybee.}},

Abstract = {{1. Movements by bumblebees Bombus lapidarius were studied in arrays of
   plants of oil-seed rape Brassica napus cv Westar. In the arrays, plants
   were arranged into either a uniformly dispersed configuration or a
   patchily dispersed configuration.
   2. Progress across an array was measured as the distance bumblebees had
   moved away from an original plant location after eight subsequent,
   successive plant visits. Movements were analysed in units of both metres
   and inter-plant spaces. In both units, bumblebees progressed more slowly
   across patchily dispersed arrays.
   3. Plant dispersion had a detectable effect on certain components of
   bees' individual inter-plant moves (e.g. move length in metres) but not
   on others (e.g. mean turning angle). In some cases, the effects of
   aggregation on the components of individual moves were probably too
   small to detect statistically and only emerged in their cumulative
   effect on bees' progress.
   4. Over short sequences of plant visits, bumblebees revisited plants
   rarely, but the frequency of revisits was almost twice as high in patchy
   arrays as in uniform arrays, and economic penalties may result from
   foraging among highly aggregated plants.
   5. The effects of plant dispersion on pollinator movements detected in
   this study are unlikely to have a major impact on pollen transfer in B.
   napus because differences in pollinator progress only emerged after
   several successive inter-plant flights away from a potential pollen
   source, by which time the limited extent of pollen carryover in this
   species means that fertilisations from the source plant would be very
   rare.}},

Abstract = {{1. Nesting behaviour and interactions between the bee Chelostoma
   florisomne (L.) (Megachilidae) and its nest parasite Sapyga clavicornis
   (L.) (Sapygidae) were studied through continual observations of
   individuals and dissections of bee nests. Protection of bee offspring is
   based on (1) the bee's discovery and removal of parasite eggs deposited
   prior to the construction of a cell closure, (2) minimising the time
   when fully provisioned cells might be parasitised successfully, and (3)
   the construction of empty cells in front of brood cells.
   2. An empty cell was found in front of 64.4\% of all brood cells and, if
   the outermost brood cell in a nest was excluded, in front of 74.3\% of
   inner brood cells. A vestibule closure is most often constructed in
   front of the outermost brood cell.
   3. Following oviposition, the bee made only five flights, which together
   lasted 6-13 min, to construct a cell closure. A cell closure does not
   prevent the nest parasite from oviposition inside the brood cell,
   however, and parasite eggs deposited through the cell closure are not
   detected and removed by the bee. Only an additional cell closure, i.e.
   the formation of an empty cell, may protect a brood cell when the bee is
   not in the nest. The nest parasite often oviposited through the
   additional cell closure but its offspring were then trapped in the empty
   cell and starved to death.
   4. Only 5.4\% of the inner brood cells that were protected by an empty
   cell were parasitised, compared with 28.9\% of those without an
   anterior, empty cell; 27.4\% of the empty cells contained dead parasite
   offspring (eggs and larvae). Thus, the empty cells provided significant
   protection and, combined with additional means of protection of brood
   cells, led to a low degree of parasitism. More than 77\% of the wasp
   offspring died at an early stage due to intraspecific interference
   competition within brood cells and as result of the wasps' oviposition
   into empty cells.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators of the Mediterranean shrub Lavandula latifolia
   (Labiatae) differ in components of pollinating effectiveness that may
   influence seed production and progeny quality. This study tests the
   prediction that L. latifolia flowers exposed to pollination regimes
   differing in pollinator composition should differ in their expected
   contribution to population recruitment in the field, as measured in
   terms of established seedlings, because of differences in seed
   production, progeny quality, or both. Using a randomized complete block
   design, two pollination regimes were induced during a 3-wk period on
   each of 15 L. latifolia plants by alternately exposing flowers in the
   two halves of each shrub to natural pollinators during two
   nonoverlapping diurnal periods (0930-1630, MD regime; dawn to 0930 and
   1630 to dusk, R regime). The two pollination regimes differed in
   pollinator composition. The importance as flower visitors of butterflies
   and small bees was greater during the MD regime, which was also
   characterized by higher flower visitation rate and higher probability of
   visitation per time unit of individual flowers. MD flowers set
   proportionally more fruits, and each fruit contained more seeds, than R
   flowers. Seed production per inflorescence was also greater in MD than
   in R half-plants. Seeds from the MD and R regimes did not differ
   significantly in either mean mass, probability of germination under
   laboratory conditions, or probability of producing a seedling when
   planted in a greenhouse. When planted in the field, seeds originating
   from MD flowers had a greater probability of producing a seedling than
   those originating from R flowers, the difference being greatest where
   soil characteristics were most adverse for early seedling growth. In the
   field, MD and R seedlings did not differ in post-emergence survival rate
   and size of eventual survivors. The estimated average probability (+/-1
   SE) of one ovule eventually producing one third-year, established
   seedling in the home environment was significantly greater for MD
   (0.0192 +/- 0.0041) than for R (0.0085 +/- 0.0020) flowers. This
   demographic advantage of MD ovules was mainly accounted for by the
   greater seedling emergence rate of MD seeds, and only secondarily by the
   greater fruit- and seed-set of MD flowers. Observed patterns may be
   explained by a combination of increased outcrossing derived from the
   greater relative importance of small bees and butterflies as
   pollinators, and increased gametophytic competition resulting from
   increased overall visitation rates to individual flowers during the MD
   pollination regime. This study suggests that even relatively minor
   differences in pollinator composition and abundance may have a
   measurable demographic impact on plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Seed set and pollinator activity of bumble bees were examined in a

   plant individuals within islets), and tussock level (plant individuals
   within patches). Size of patches and islets were study design
   parameters, whereas isolation at the patch and islet level and size at
   the tussock level were treated in the analysis as covariates. Isolation
   of islets and patches had no significant effect on the response
   variables (seed set and bumble bee activity). However, the isolation of
   islets and patches was quite small compared to the activity range of
   bumble bees in the study area. While islet size seemed to be
   unimportant, both pollinator activity and seed set increased with
   increasing patch and tussock size, whereas the frequency of aborted
   seeds decreased. The increased seed set of larger and presumably older
   patches and tussocks indicate that to maximize viability of a

Abstract = {{Habitat alteration can deteriorate plant-pollinator interactions and
   thereby increase the risk of population extinction. As part of a larger
   study on the effects of changes in land use on fen grassland vegetation,
   factors influencing the seed set of a short-lived, endangered wetland
   plant, Pedicularis palustris, were studied. We conducted field
   pollination experiments in one large and one small population. To
   investigate the effect of pollen source on seed set, individual flowers
   of caged plants were left unpollinated or were pollinated with pollen
   from the same flower, the same population or another population. To
   study pollen limitation and flower display, whole plants were subjected
   to pollinator exclosure, hand pollination or natural pollination.
   Self-compatibility was high, but differed between populations (61\% and
   97\% of seed set after cross-pollination within populations).
   Cross-pollination between populations did not significantly alter seed
   number per capsule. Pollinator exclosure resulted in a very low seed set
   (<15\% of natural seed set), despite high self-compatibility. The most
   likely explanations for high self-compatibility in combination with low
   autofertility are geitonogamy as reproductive assurance, selective
   neutrality of self-compatibility and phylogenetic constraints. Because
   of low autofertility, the seed set in P. palustris depends on
   pollinators. In the study populations, natural pollination was clearly
   sufficient for maximum seed production per plant, but seed set per
   capsule was significantly pollen-limited in the smaller population.
   Plants in this population also had a higher maximum percentage of
   simultaneously open flowers than those of the large population (31\% vs.
   13\%), while flower longevity was generally extended without
   pollination. It is concluded that P palustris may influence pollinator
   behaviour and therefore the risk of pollen limitation by flower display.
   P. palustris showed a flexible reaction to differing pollination regimes
   without losses in overall seed set in the study populations.}},

   the determining factor for the number of workers and the investment sex
   ratio of the B. t. dalmatinus colonies. The colonies of these two

Abstract = {{To comprehend the reproductional success of Impatiens glandulifera in
   Central Europe, the pollination system was analyzed under field
   conditions. Impatiens glandulifera attracts a lot of visitors because of
   its abundant amount of nectar with its high sugar content. The range of
   visitors, their composition and their changes during the blooming time
   and their pollen loading capacity were investigated as well as plant and
   flower morphology, the nectar production, the quantity and viability of
   pollen, the stigmatic pollen load, the pollen/ovule ratio and the seed
   production of the neophyte. The visitors, which in Central Europe almost
   exclusively utilize the nectar, are passively covered with pollen
   because of the morphology and the mobile suspension of the flowers.
   Consequently the next landing results in a pollination of I.
   glandulifera during the female blooming phase. Although the germination
   rate of the pollen deposited on the stigma is very low, a 100\% seed set
   is readily obtained during the initial visit to a flower in female
   stage.}},

   affected pollen deposition positively whereas deposition did neither
   affect seed set (number per flower) nor seed weight. Insects reaction to
   corolla size was dependent on plant size, and thus we found the effect
   of corolla size on pollen deposition to decline with plant size. Instead
   pollen deposition per plant seemed to be correlated to overall floral
   display. We argued that resource status of the individual plants could

Abstract = {{The recovery of vegetation following fire has been studied intensively
   in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Little attention, however, has been
   given to floral traits, and almost no data have been collected on the
   effects of fire on pollinator activity and fruit-set. This paper reports
   the effects of fire on flower visitation rates and the possibly related
   fruit-set. We compared visitation rates of the main pollinators on four
   plant core-species in burned and adjacent unburned areas. Measurements
   were performed at an unburned phrygana (scrub lands), and at a burned
   area (5-7 years post-fire). Bumble bees and solitary bees were the main
   taxa of visitors, while few honeybees were recorded. Solitary bees were
   almost absent from the burned area. Fruit-set was significantly higher
   in the unburned area for three out of the four plant species. The lower
   fruit-set in the burned area was possibly the result of low activity of
   solitary bees which are the main effective pollinators of the examined
   species. We hypothesize that the populations of the solitary bees were
   diminished or extirpated either directly by the fire, or indirectly by
   the scarcity of nectar in the early post-fire years due to dominance of
   young pine and Cistus spp. seedlings. The short foraging range of the
   solitary bees and their slow invasion rate into the burned area may
   explain our results.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the interrelation between nectary structure (13 parameters),
   nectar characteristics (yield, chemical composition), and flower size of
   11 Labiatae species in a Mediterranean shrub community near Athens,
   Greece. We also explored whether the above attributes are affected by
   the Mediterranean summer drought constraints. Our findings show that
   among all nectary parameters studied, nectary size and stomatal opening
   are the most important in (positively) shaping nectar secretion, nectary
   size being the most meaningful. Nectary structure is correlated to
   quantity of the nectar secreted, not its quality. Wide Rowers bear wide
   nectaries with large stomatal openings, whereas deep flowers are not
   related to any nectary size. Corolla size (both length and width) and
   nectary stomatal opening decrease with flowering time. This applies also
   to nectary size, nectar volume and sugar content of the perennials (9
   species). Ail above cases of time dependence show that there is a
   constraint effect of Mediterranean climate on floral and nectary
   structure, reflected also as a decrease in nectar secretion. Nectary
   structure in Labiatae is largely shaped by both phylogenetic and climate
   constraints. On the other hand, although nectar is largely influenced by
   nectary structure, it is to a large extent ecologically biased, implying
   that, in addition to phylogeny, there are many other ecological
   parameters interfering in its secretion such as time within the season,
   life history, and light requirements.}},

   bees repeatedly came to flowers. A testable basis for the

   pheromone mimicry, recently documented for some honey bees. Meliponine

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of the common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) as
   a pollinator of the rainforest tree Syzygium cormiflorum was assessed by
   comparing movements: pollen loads, and visitation frequency, with those
   of birds. The study was carried out in a fragmented rainforest landscape
   in north Queensland and movements were determined by radio-telemetry.
   Bars carried 6 times more pollen than birds, but were less frequent
   visitors to S. cormiflorum, suggesting that the quantity of pollen
   distributed by the two groups may not differ greatly. However. pollen
   quality (the geographic genetic distance moved) may be a more important
   factor in determining pollinator effectiveness. Bats were very mobile in
   the fragmented landscape, with home ranges varying from 12 to 1796 ha
   and often encompassing more than one forest fragment. Bats usually moved
   along strips of vegetation, but were found to fly; up to 5.8 km (mean =
   1 km) across cleared land. This mobility led to similar numbers of S.
   australis being caught in small (< 50 ha) forest fragments and
   continuous forest. At the scale of individual trees, bats fed for an
   average of 1.2 min per tree, compared to 5.0 min for birds. Short
   foraging rimes per tree and frequent movements of > 200 m should
   increase the opportunity for movement of pollen between individual
   trees. Collectively, these observations suggest that S, australis carry
   pollen of high quality. Although they fly across cleared land,
   fragmentation may impact bat populations by allowing increased owl
   predation in open country and by increasing the reliance of bats on
   flower resources in the agricultural matrix. On the Atherton Tablelands,
   the latter is provided mostly by cultivated bananas (Musa sp.), which
   produce nectar but not pollen. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The floral syndrome of Macleania bullata Yeo (Ericaceae) reflects its
   adaptation to hummingbird pollination. Its flowers, however, are subject
   to high levels of nectar robbing. I examined the floral visitor
   assemblage of M. bullata in a tropical montane wet forest in
   southwestern Colombia, focusing on the behavior of the visitors. I also
   rested far the presence of nocturnal pollination and the effects of
   nectar removal on new nectar production. The principal floral visitors
   were the nectar robbing hummingbirds Ocreatus underwoodii (19.1\% of
   visits) and Chlorostilbon mellisugus (18.9\%). Only two species of
   long-billed hummingbirds visited the Bowers of M. bullata as
   ``legitimate{''} pollinators: Coeligena torquata (14.7\% of visits) and
   Doryfera ludoviciae (14.3\%). The remaining visits constituted nectar
   robbing by bees, butterflies, and other species of hummingbirds.
   Nocturnal pollination took place, although fruit set levels were 2.4
   rimes higher when only diurnal pollination was allowed as opposed to
   exclusively nocturnal pollination. Nectar robbers removed floral nectar
   without pollinating the flower. Treatments of experimental nectar
   removal were carried out to examine if flowers synthesize more nectar
   after nectar removal. Nectar removal increased the total volume of
   nectar produced by each Bower without affecting sugar concentration.
   Thus, nectar robbing can impose a high cost to the plants by forcing
   them to replace lost nectar.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of flower visitors to monitor returns when collecting pollen
   from flowers has been seldom studied despite the importance of pollen as
   a food resource, particularly for bees. Californian populations of
   Mimulus guttatus are polymorphic for pollen quality: many plants produce
   a high proportion of cytoplasmless pollen grains that render the grains
   incapable of fertilizing ovules or of supporting bees nutritionally. We
   found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of
   inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen
   grains per flower was also consistent within a plant at each date but
   declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees
   (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the
   basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with
   choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that
   varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two
   patches of plants differed in quality.
   We found that bees could discriminate among plants on the basis of
   pollen quality provided that flowers still retained most of the pollen.
   In the two-genotype trials, bees chose genotypes primarily on the
   quantity of viable pollen, and nectar was much less important.
   Similarly, where patches of low- and high-pollen quality plants were
   established, bees responded by visiting the high-quality patch more
   often and by visiting more flowers within the patch. However, the
   results from the outdoor plots that contained genotypes of varying
   phenotypes were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of a large number of
   separate plots showed that the overall correlation between visitation
   rate and pollen quality was significant, but variation among plots was
   also significant. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was
   suggested in a greenhouse trial in which we showed that, when foraging
   density was high, depletion of the standing crop of pollen happened
   quickly, and this reduced the ability of the foragers to choose the
   higher-quality genotypes. The results have implications for the
   evolution of pollen production in Mimulus guttatus and reward production
   in other plants.}},

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Geitonogamy (transfer of pollen among flowers on the same plant) may
   lead to reduced outcrossing and interfere with sex function. Orchids
   with pollen packaged into pollinaria would be expected to be
   particularly vulnerable to the loss of cross-mating opportunities
   imposed by geitonogamy. We tested the hypothesis that the absence of
   floral rewards in many orchid species is a means of reducing
   geitonogamy. Experiments with the deceptive species Orchis mascula and
   Orchis morio showed that queen bumble bees probe more flowers and stay
   longer on plants when artificial nectar is added to the hewers. Overall,
   the data indicated that the evolution of nectar production in deceptive
   Orchis species would result in moderate to high levels of geitonogamy,
   as a consequence of the greater number of flowers probed and longer
   visit duration (similar to 60 s) by pollinators. However, the estimated
   levels of geitonogamy were less than expected, due both to a time delay
   before freshly withdrawn pollinaria bend into the correct position to
   strike a stigma and to extensive carryover of pollen. The time elapsed
   before a freshly withdrawn pollinarium is in the correct position to
   strike the stigma was found to vary 30-80 a, depending on the orchid
   species. Since pollinators usually spend <30 s on an inflorescence, we
   estimate that natural populations of the study species are highly
   outcrossed. The fraction of the pollen load carried over from flower to
   flower was found to be 0.67 in O. mascula. Selection should favor longer
   delays in pollinaria bending and extensive pollen carryover in
   nectar-producing orchids. This is corroborated by the nectariferous
   orchid Platanthera chlorantha, which we found to have a pollinaria
   bending delay of 80 s and a high pollen carryover fraction (0.87). In
   general, selection for traits that prevent geitonogamy should occur only
   when pollinators are abundant. Since fruit set of orchids is usually
   pollinator limited, additional explanations may have to be sought to
   explain deception. The most plausible complementary hypothesis is that
   resources in pollinator-limited orchids are invested in advertising
   display, rather than nectar production.}},

Abstract = {{For agricultural crops that depend on pollination, the impact of flower
   abundance and pollinator movement on seed or fruit yield is of economic
   importance, and may have implications for crop and pollinator
   management. Using alfalfa, Medicago sativa L. (Leguminosae), I tested
   the hypothesis that seed set is lower when standing crop of open Rowers
   is high than when standing crop is low. This could occur if pollinators
   move more among flowers on the same plant, causing self-pollination,
   when flowers are abundant. In a greenhouse experiment I compared seed
   set for 3 simulated pollinator movement patterns between flowers on the
   same versus different plants, under the 2 standing crop regimes
   generated by varying the number of flowers hand-pollinated each day.
   Treatments maximized, minimized, and were intermediate in movement
   between flowers on different plants. Significantly more seeds were
   produced per pod when flower standing crop was low than when standing
   crop was high. I hypothesized that movement pattern would have a greater
   effect when standing crop was high rather than low. Despite a trend in
   the expected direction, this interaction was not significant. Field
   observations of within versus between plant movement of the pollinator,
   Megachile rotundata (F.) (Megachilidae), indicated that the bees visit
   more flowers per raceme when standing crop is high than when standing
   crop is low. In a series of hand pollinations among flowers on the same
   plant, seeds per pollination decreased between the Ist flowers
   pollinated and later flowers pollinated in succession. Alfalfa may yield
   less seed when flowers are abundant, suggesting that early introduction
   of bees into alfalfa seed fields is desirable to maintain a low flower
   standing crop.}},

Abstract = {{1. We quantified geitonogamous selfing in Echium vulgare, a
   self-compatible, bumble-bee pollinated plant. A maximum estimate of
   selfing was determined using a paternity analysis with RAPDs. In the
   first experiment, bumble-bees visited a sequence of virgin flowers. The
   percentage selfing increased rapidly from 12\% in the first flower
   visited, up to 50\% in the 15th flower visited in the sequence. In the
   second experiment, when bees visited plants in a natural population, the
   average selfing of plants increased with the number of open flowers from
   0\% to maximally 33\%.
   2. The results obtained in both experiments are consistently lower than
   predicted by our model on pollen dynamics (Rademaker, de Jong \&
   Klinkhamer 1997). We modified the model on pollen dynamics to link it
   more to the field situation with observations on flower stage, flower
   opening and bumble-bee preference, so that the bumble-bees encounter a
   variable number of pollen grains per flower. We also adjusted the
   parameters. If less pollen adheres to the bee (25\% instead of 50\%)
   after removal from the anthers, or if bees arrive at a plant with more
   pollen grains (6000 instead of 4448), the predictions of the model in
   regard to selfing could be improved but were still high compared with
   the observed selfing rates measured with RAPDs.
   3. We suggest that the model is consistent with pollen dynamics in the
   field. However, post-pollination processes like selective abortion could
   play a role in E. vulgare.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal-pollinated species experience low visitation rates and, in
   some cases, stand on the brink of extinction because they are poorly
   fertilized. Among these plants, some are deceptive species (flowering
   plants that do not offer any reward to their pollinators). A learning
   process that pollinators undergo determines visitation rate in those
   food frauds that do not mimic rewarding models. Pollinators that visit
   cheating species avoid them after having experienced the absence of
   reward a few times and then visit rewarding plants. We modeled this
   learning process, using classical optimal foraging and game theory
   tools, and applied our model to survey how visitation rate can be
   adjusted in deceptive species in a density-dependent way and how it can
   influence the population dynamics of those species. We found pollinator
   behavior to induce positive density dependence at low density (Allee
   effect) and therefore to create a threshold density under which
   population survival is not possible. Moreover, negative density
   dependence occurs at high density so that in most cases pollination
   limitation creates a stable demographic equilibrium. Stochastic
   simulations were performed to investigate the stability of populations
   at these equilibria and estimate their mean time to extinction. Because
   some parameters such as pollinator density or habitat fragmentation were
   explicitly taken into account, we tried to describe environmental
   conditions conducive to a deceptive plant's survival.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of nectar reward on a bumblebee's decision to stay on or to

   Nectar standing crop was varied by covering plants for different

   ``decision strategy{''} as function of the duration (in seconds) of the
   current flower visit (y). The duration of the previous flower visit and
   the number of previous flower visits on the same plant did not influence
   the bumblebee's departure behaviour.
   Bumblebees on E. vulgare use a probabilistic decision rule. The chance
   (p) of staying on the plant can be described by a hyperbolic function of
   the time spent in the current flower (y): p = 0.97 - (0.11/(0.04 + y)).
   Simulations were carried out in which the distribution of nectar over
   the flowers within a plant was varied. High variation in nectar content
   shortened visitation sequences.
   In the field we covered plants to increase nectar standing crop per
   flower. This resulted in longer visitation sequences, but no effect of

Abstract = {{The genotypic variability in nectar secretion among 71 genotypes of
   winter oilseed rapes was tested for floral nectar volume, sugar
   composition and concentration. Differences were found between seed
   quality genotypes: double low {[}00] oilseed rape varieties tended to
   secrete much more nectar than single low {[}0 + ] and double high {[}+
   +] varieties. Male-sterile lines (Ogura CMS) secreted one-half to
   one-third the amount of their isogenic male-fertile counterparts.
   Restored lines behaved as conventional rape varieties. On average,
   amounts of nectar were 2 mu l/flower and ranged from 0.7 to 6 mu
   l/flower. Among the genotypes under test, the male-sterile lines were
   not the least productive. The analysis of `Samourai' winter oilseed rape
   showed that total sugar concentrations in nectar were highest at the
   beginning of the flowering period (30 g/100 ml) and lowest towards the
   end (10 g/100 ml). At a given date, total sugar contents in nectar of
   {[}0 +] varieties were significantly higher than those of{[}+ +]
   varieties and were due to higher fructose contents. Differences between
   genotypes within the same type also occurred, depending on the day of
   sampling. Oilseed rape nectar was confirmed to be predominantly composed
   of hexose (glucose and fructose). From the results of these
   investigations, it is concluded that the opportunity exists to select
   oilseed rape genotypes, including male-sterile lines, that secrete
   sufficient amounts of nectar to attract honeybees to ensure pollination
   of male-sterile lines for hybrid seed production.}},

Abstract = {{The biological function of the wedge-like, dorsally adhesive viscidium

   (grouped in the so-called `Peiexia alliance') is elucidated by the study
   of the pollination biology of three species occurring in Sao Paulo
   State, southeastern Brazil. Cyclopogon congestus is pollinated by the
   bee, Pseudoaugochloropsis graminea (Halictidae), Pelexia oestrifera by
   workers of Bombus (Fervidobombus) atratus (Apidae) and Sarcoglottis
   fasciculata by males and females of Euglossa cordata (Apidae:
   Euglossini). These three species offer nectar as a reward and are
   self-compatible, though they need pollinators to set fruits. In spite of
   the difference in flower sizes and in their pollinators' taxonomic
   groups, the pollination mechanism is essentially the same for these
   species. The pollinarium adheres to the ventral surface of the bee
   labrum. The viscidium needs to be dorsally pressed in order to liberate
   a glue which fixes the pollinarium to a bee. Pollination is achieved by
   the interaction of the orchid column and the mouthparts of the bees.
   Fixation to the ventral surface of the labrum is advantageous for the
   orchid, since it is a difficult place for the bees to clean. Another
   advantage is that, since the labrum is articulated, when the bees fold
   and close their mouthparts, the pollinarium remains protected under the
   bee's head, thus reducing the risks of pollen loss. Since the
   wedge-like, dorsally adhesive viscidium is a characteristic feature of
   Cyclopogon, Pelexia and Sarcoglottis, it is suggested that some kind of
   phylogenetic constraint may exist, impeding the occurrence of
   pollinators other than bees in these orchid genera, All other
   flower-visiting animals lack the labrum-like structure needed to fix the
   pollinarium. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.}},

   which provides only nectar to its pollinators, shares with Monttea the
   same kind of nectary. It is derived from the base of the floral tube,
   corresponds anatomically to the mesenchymatic type, and persists after
   corolla abscission. The presence of two rewarding systems, i. e. oils
   and nectar, is hen considered in relation to the pollination biology.
   The pollinators of Monttea schickendantzii and M. chilensis are recorded
   for the first time. The Monttea pollinators can have, in addition to the
   regular foreleg oil-collecting combs, specialized tarsal pads to collect
   oils from trichome elaiophores. Oil collecting organs are also present
   on the middle legs, though these are not used while foraging oils from
   Monttea.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of floral color change on long- and short-distance

   red flowers had a significantly greater pollen and nectar reward and

   blue flowers both influenced long-distance attractiveness of plants,
   defined as the number of insect approaches towards an individual plant.
   After reaching a plant, flower visitors preferred to visit young red
   flowers. Therefore, short-distance attractiveness, defined as the number
   of flowers visited successively on an individual plant, was influenced
   mainly by the number of young red flowers. The co-occurrence of the
   change in reproductive ability, in amount of reward, and in flower color
   enabled lungwort plants to direct pollinators to reproductive, highly
   rewarding red flowers. The data suggest that by maintaining changed
   flowers lungwort plants can increase their long-distance attraction and

Abstract = {{Destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats is the major reason
   for the decreasing biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. Loss of
   populations may negatively affect biotic interactions and ecosystem
   stability. Here we tested the hypothesis that habitat fragmentation
   affects bee populations and thereby disrupts plant-pollinator
   interactions. We experimentally established small ``habitat islands{''}
   of two self-incompatible, annual crucifers on eight calcareous
   grasslands and in the intensively managed agricultural landscape at
   increasing distances (up to 1000 m) from these species-rich grasslands
   to measure effects of isolation on both pollinator guilds and seed set,
   independently from patch size and density, resource availability and
   genetic erosion of plant populations. Each habitat island consisted of
   four pots each with one plant of mustard (Sinapis arvensis) and radish
   (Raphanus sativus). Increasing isolation of the small habitat islands
   resulted in both decreased abundance and species richness of
   flower-visiting bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea). Mean body size of
   flower-visiting wild bees was larger on isolated than on nonisolated
   habitat islands emphasizing the positive correlation of body size and
   foraging distance. Abundance of flower-visiting honeybees depended on
   the distance from the nearest apiary. Abundance of other flower visitors
   such as hover flies did not change with increasing isolation. Number of
   seeds per fruit and per plant decreased significantly with increasing
   distance from the nearest grassland for both mustard and radish. Mean
   seed set per plant was halved at a distance of approximately 1000 m for
   mustard and at 250 m for radish. In accordance with expectations, seed
   set per plant was positively correlated with the number of
   flower-visiting bees. We found no evidence for resource limitation in
   the case of mustard and only marginal effects for radish. We conclude
   that habitat connectivity is essential to maintain not only abundant and
   diverse bee communities, but also plant-pollinator interactions in
   economically important crops and endangered wild plants.}},

Abstract = {{Many plants show obvious floral adaptations to attract and facilitate

   frequent diurnal visits, yet little is known about how these different
   visitors contribute to plant reproductive success. We studied the
   pollination biology of Manfreda virginica to measure the relative

   what extent floral characters and visitation rates predict contribution
   to seed set. The pattern of nectar and pollen production indicated that
   M. virginica is adapted primarily to nocturnal pollination. Our
   observations of natural populations of M. virginica during two field
   seasons indicated nocturnal visitors consisted of medium sized moths and
   larger hawkmoths. The primary diurnal visitors were large bees. The
   results of exclusion experiments showed that diurnal pollination
   resulted in significantly less seed set than nocturnal and open
   pollination despite the frequency of diurnal visits. Visitor behavior
   and timing of anthesis appear to contribute to the reduced impact of
   diurnal visits to plant reproduction. These results suggest that while
   diurnal pollination contributes less to plans reproduction in some
   years, it may be important when considering the evolution of nocturnal

Abstract = {{A paradigm of evolutionary biology is that adaptation and reproductive
   isolation are caused by a nearly infinite number of mutations of
   individually small effect. Here, we test this hypothesis by
   investigating the genetic basis of pollinator discrimination in two
   closely related species of monkeyflowers that differ in their major
   pollinators. This system provides a unique opportunity to investigate
   the genetic architecture of adaptation and speciation because floral
   traits that confer pollinator specificity also contribute to premating
   reproductive isolation. We asked: (i) What floral traits cause
   pollinator discrimination among plant species? and (ii) What is the
   genetic basis of these traits? We examined these questions by using data
   obtained from a large-scale field experiment where genetic markers were
   employed to determine the genetic basis of pollinator visitation.
   Observations of F-2 hybrids produced by crossing bee-pollinated Mimulus
   lewisii with hummingbird-pollinated Mimulus cardinalis revealed that
   bees preferred large flowers low in anthocyanin and carotenoid pigments,
   whereas hummingbirds favored nectar-rich flowers high in anthocyanins.
   An allele that increases petal carotenoid concentration reduced bee
   visitation by 80\%, whereas an allele that increases nectar production
   doubled hummingbird visitation. These results suggest that genes of
   large effect on pollinator preference have contributed to floral
   evolution and premating reproductive isolation in these monkeyflowers.
   This work contributes to growing evidence that adaptation and
   reproductive isolation may often involve major genes.}},

Abstract = {{Bees (series Apiformes, superfamily Apoidea) are most diverse in arid
   regions of the world. Arid regions (deserts and semi-deserts) are
   characterized by discrete rainy seasons and extreme temporal variability
   in rainfall. This paper documents several novel mechanisms by which one
   desert bee species (Perdita portalis) copes with harsh and unpredictable
   conditions in xeric habitats. These same mechanisms are likely to be
   present in diverse bee families. First, diapausing P. portalis follow a
   bet-hedging emergence pattern, such that only approximately half of the
   larvae pupate under optimal conditions. Second, emergence is condition
   dependent such that larvae with a low average body weight are
   significantly more likely to emerge than are larvae with a high average
   body weight under similar conditions. Finally, larval emergence is
   induced by exposure to high humidity (rainfall). The parallels between
   bee larvae and angiosperm seeds in arid environments are striking. In
   both cases there is clear evidence of bet hedging, emergence (or
   germination) is dependent on larval (or seed) condition and rainfall
   triggers emergence (or germination). These patterns of emergence are
   significant for understanding bee species diversity in arid regions.}},

Abstract = {{1. The thermoregulatory capabilities of 18 species of Alaskan bees
   spanning nearly two orders of magnitude of body mass were measured.
   Thoracic temperature, measured across the temperature range at which
   each species forages, was regressed against operative (environmental)
   temperature to determine bees' abilities to maintain relatively constant
   thoracic temperatures across a range of operative temperatures
   (thermoregulatory performance).
   2. Previous studies on insect thermoregulation have compared thoracic
   temperature with ambient air temperature. Operative temperature, which
   integrates air temperature, solar radiation and effects of wind, was
   estimated by measuring the temperature of a fresh, dead bee in the field
   environment. It is suggested that this is a more accurate measure of the
   thermal environment experienced by the insect and also allows direct
   comparisons of insects under different microclimate conditions, such as
   in sun and shade.
   3. Simple regression analysis of species and family means, and analysis
   of phylogenetically based independent contrasts showed thermoregulatory
   capability, ability to elevate thoracic temperature, and minimum
   thoracic temperature necessary for initiating flight all increased with
   body size.
   4. Bumble-bees were better thermoregulators than solitary bees primarily
   as a consequence of their larger body size. However, their
   thermoregulatory abilities were slightly, but significantly, better than
   predicted from body size alone, suggesting an added role of pelage
   and/or physiology. Large solitary bees were better thermoregulators than
   small solitary bees apparently as a result of body-size differences,
   with small bees acting as thermal conformers.}},

   developed to describe this choice behaviour in terms of linear
   interactions between the different spectral types of photoreceptors, The
   green receptor has a positive influence, whereas the blue (and possibly
   the ultraviolet and violet) receptor and the red receptor have negative

   pollination, low fruit set (1-22\%) and a very striking decrease in
   fruit production from bottom to top of the inflorescence. All of these
   indicate that the orchid may rely on deception to attract visitors.
   Ajuga forrestii Diels (Labiatae) appears to be the main or exclusive
   subsidiary nectar source for A. mangkamensis during the flowering period
   of H. flabellata. It appears that H. flabellata utilizes a food deceit
   pollination strategy for pollination. The orchid benefits from the great
   variation of flowers in colour and shape. Phenological,
   functional-morphometric and distribution data indicate that A.
   mangkamensis is an optimal pollinator of H. flabellata and thus the
   anthecological adaptation of the orchid to the pollen vector may be
   unique. (C) 1999 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinating seed-consuming interactions are rare, but include fig-fig
   wasp and yucca-yucca moth interactions, both of which are thought to be
   coevolved. Conditions favoring such mutualisms are poorly known but
   likely include plants and pollinators whose life cycles are
   synchronized. In this paper, we describe a new pollinating seed-consumer
   mutualism between a Sonoran Desert cactus, Lophocereus schottii (senita
   cactus), and a pyralid moth, Upiga virescens (senita moth). We compare
   this mutualism with the yucca mutualism in terms of Life history traits,
   active pollination, and selective abortion. Senita cactus flowers were
   pollinated nearly exclusively by nocturnal senita moths, but a few
   halictid bees also pollinated flowers. Only 40\% of flowers set fruit
   during the years of study, apparently due to resource limitation. All
   phases of the senita moth's life history were associated with the senita
   cactus. During flower visitation, female senita moths collected pollen,
   actively pollinated flowers, and oviposited one egg. After flowers
   closed, emerging larvae bored into the tops of developing fruit, where
   they consumed seeds and fruit tissue. However, not all seeds/fruit were
   consumed by larvae because only 20\% of eggs produced larvae that
   survived to be seed/fruit consumers. Senita cactus and senita moth
   interactions were mutualistic. Moths received food resources (seeds,
   fruit) for their progeny, and cacti had a 4.8 benefit-to-cost ratio;
   only 21\% of developing fruit were destroyed by larvae. Life history
   traits important to this mutualism included low survival of senita moth
   eggs/larvae, several moth generations per flowering season, host
   specificity of senita moths, active pollination, oviposition into
   flowers, and limited seed/fruit consumption. Active pollination by
   senita moths in the presence of co-pollinators supports the prediction
   that active pollination can evolve during a period of coexistence with
   co-pol linators. The specialization of both senita and senita moths in
   the presence of co-pollinators makes the senita mutualism quite
   remarkable in comparison with fig-fig wasp and yucca-yucca moth
   mutualisms.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary biologists have long hypothesized that the diversity of
   flower colours we see is in part a strategy to promote memorization by
   pollinators, pollinator constancy and therefore, a directed and
   efficient pollen transfer between plants. However, this hypothesis has
   never been tested against a biologically realistic null model, nor were
   colours assessed in the way pollinators see them. Our intent here is to
   fill these gaps. Throughout one year, we sampled floral species
   compositions at five ecologically distinct sites near Berlin, Germany.
   Bee-subjective colours were quantified for all 168 species. A model of
   colour vision was used to predict how similar the colours of sympatric
   and simultaneously blooming flowers were for bees. We then compared
   flower colour differences in the real habitats with those of random
   plant communities. We did not find pronounced deviations from chance
   when we considered common plants. When we examined rare plants, however,
   we found significant divergence in two of the five plant communities. At
   one site, similarly coloured species were found to be more frequent than
   expected, and at the other two locations, flower colours were
   indistinguishable from a random distribution. These results fit
   theoretical considerations that rare plants are under stronger selective
   pressure to secure pollination than common plants. Our study illustrates
   the power of linking such distinct biological traditions as community
   ecology and the neuroethology of bee vision.}},

Abstract = {{1 Levels of nectar and pollen were manipulated in individual flowers of
   oil-seed rape, Brassica napus, which were then offered to foraging
   bumblebees (Bombus lapidarius) for a single visit.
   2 The durations of flower visits by bumblebees increased with the amount
   of nectar, bur were unaffected by the level of available pollen, The
   bees' flower-handling routine may have become behaviourally fixed by the
   expectation of low pollen rewards, which prevailed in the experimental
   garden.
   3 The effects of nectar provision on both pollen import (deposition on
   stigma) and export (removal from anthers) were studied. The amount of
   pollen transfected during a bumblebee's visit was affected only by the
   amount of pollen that the flower presented.
   4 Manipulated flowers that presented a large amount of available pollen
   received approximately three times more pollen on their stigmas during a
   bee's visit than flowers with little available pollen, which suggests
   that autogamous pollen transfer contributes substantially to pollen
   deposition when pollen availability is high. The gradual dehiscence of
   the anthers in this species means that available pollen accumulates only
   if pollinator visits are infrequent, when the increased autogamy may act
   to ensure adequate pollination.
   5 There was no relation between the quantity of nectar residue that a
   bee left after visiting a manipulated flower and the mean duration of
   its visits to unmanipulated flowers. Therefore, variation among
   individuals in the duration of visits to unmanipulated flowers
   apparently resulted from differences in foraging speed rather than from
   variation in the thoroughness of nectar removal.}},

Abstract = {{Fertile ramets of bumblebee-pollinated Alstroemeria aurea, a clonal
   perennial native to the temperate forests of the southern Andes, produce
   single terminal inflorescences that may bear two or more temporally
   non-overlapping whorls of flowers. While fruit set is commonly high (>
   80\%) among early-opening flowers, it is usually low (< 20\%) among
   late-opening flowers within ramets. Using flowering ramets with two
   whorls of flowers, we examined experimentally the following related
   hypotheses. First, late flowers act as a reserve of ovaries, increasing
   their likelihood of setting seed when early fruits abort due to either
   pollen or resource limitation. Second, where early fruit abortion has
   occurred, plants may actively ensure pollination of late flowers by
   increasing their attractants and rewards. In a natural population, we
   simulated (1) lack of pollen deposition in early flowers, by excising
   their stigmas just before receptivity, and (2) resource limitation, by
   removing all the leaves from an experimental flowering ramet. Treatments
   were applied to individual ramets according to a 2 x 2 factorial design.
   We found that when early flowers failed to set fruit due to stigma
   excision, nectar secretion and particularly pollen receipt strongly
   increased in late flowers. Higher pollen deposition contributed
   significantly to the observed five-fold increase in seed output of late
   flowers. Fruit and seed set from early flowers were more negatively
   affected by defoliation than that from late flowers. Defoliation did not
   interfere with a ramet's capacity to increase late reproductive output
   when early reproduction failed. These results support the assertion that
   late flowers act as a reserve of ovaries helping a plant to cope with an
   unpredictable environment. These results also suggest that plants may
   actively increase pollinator visitation by opportunistically increasing
   flower rewards.}},

Abstract = {{Floral diversity in Streptocarpus and Saintpaulia can be classified into
   six distinct types on the basis of quantitative variation. Species are
   differentiated by overall flower size and by corolla lobe size in
   relation to corolla tube opening size, characteristics implicated in
   pollination ecology. Saintpaulia has a very short corolla tube and
   yellow protruding anthers, strikingly different from Streptocarpus, and
   probably associated with buzz pollination. Some species of Streptocarpus
   and all species of Saintpaulia are enantiostylous, a feature often
   linked to buzz pollination. Mapping of these floral characters onto a
   molecular phylogeny based on ITS sequence data showed that in
   Streptocarpus flower size evolved from small to large, with reversals in
   four species. The putatively bee pollinated `open-tubed' type had two
   independent origins, and the putatively lepidopteran-pollinated
   `keyhole' type had four separate origins. Enantiostyly had one or two
   origins. The degree of zygomorphy varies within
   Streptocarpus/Saintpaulia. The most extreme difference is between
   Saintpaulia ionantha and a Saintpaulia peloric cultivar. The
   developmental basis of floral variation was compared using SEM in three

   artificially varied nectar-robbing rates within 20 natural I. aggregata

   analogs, we estimated the amount of pollen donated (male fitness
   component) and the amount of pollen received (female fitness component)
   by plants with different levels of nectar robbing. We also measured
   percentage fruit set per plant, seed set per fruit, and average seed
   mass as additional components of female fitness. Nectar robbing
   significantly decreased both male and female fitness components. Heavy
   nectar robbing (>80\% of available flowers robbed) significantly
   decreased dye donation, pollen receipt, and average number of seeds per
   fruit at the whole-plant level. Furthermore, nectar robbing
   significantly decreased dye donation by individual flowers. Although
   nectar robbing has often been regarded as unimportant to plant
   reproductive success, we document significant effects of nectar robbing

Abstract = {{Two designs were set up to produce semidwarf hybrid seeds of oilseed
   rape and were tested for pollination efficiency. In both cases the
   male-fertile/male-sterile ratio was 2/13, so that the most distant
   male-sterile strip was 19m away from the male-fertile strip. In 1991,
   the male fertile line was dwarf whilst in 1995 the male-sterile line was
   dwarf. The male and female lines differed in height up to 90cm.
   Pollinating entomofauna (with hives addition) and yield components were
   studied. In 1991, the floribundity of the two lines was much higher than
   in 1995, but their flowering time were well synchronized in both
   designs. The proportion of solitary bees, bumblebees and dipterans were
   different according to the year but the addition of hives led to a
   drastic predominance of the honeybee population. Pollen gatherers stayed
   on the male-fertile strip and their density/1000 flowers was
   particularly high in 1991. That can be partially attributed to a
   ``corridor effect{''} of the dwarf male-fertile strip. Nevertheless,
   even if the difference in height reduces the number of shiftings between
   the lines, it does not completely stop them. No gradient in the nectar
   gatherers density was detected in relation to their distance from the
   male-fertile strip. Considering the yield components in each design, no
   very significant differences were found between male and female lines.
   They had no incidence on the final yield except for the male-fertile
   line when this one was dwarf and suffered from the competition with tall
   male-sterile line. In both cases, the male-sterile lines yield was
   always higher than male-fertile ones and was independent of their
   distance from the male strip. Consequently, both designs con be used.
   Nevertheless such results only concern the Basin of Rennes where the
   climatic conditions are favourable to hybrid seed production with
   pollinating insects. A confirmation of these preliminary results in
   other regions is needed.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study of Campanula punctata pollinated by Bombus diversus
   showed greater male reproductive success in plants with wider corollas

   Pollen removal alone was not a good measure of male reproductive
   success. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the mechanism
   underlying the selection on corolla width in C. punctata. Multiple
   regression analysis of male reproductive success in experimental
   populations revealed that the advantage of a wide corolla to the male is
   independent of the corolla width of pollen recipients, indicating that
   the position of pollen deposited on Bombus may not be an important
   factor for selection. However, the number of pollen grains that fell on
   the petal or off the flower and were lost at the first visit of Bombus
   (pollen fall) decreased with increasing corolla width, so that most
   pollen grains removed from a wide flower were deposited onto the
   pollinator. In a narrow flower, a greater proportion of the pollen
   removed was wasted through pollen fall. Pollen removal does not reflect
   male reproductive success, at least in part because of the loss of
   pollen in some flowers through pollen fall. The positive relationship
   between wider corollas and reduced loss of pollen through pollen fall is
   likely to lead to greater male reproductive: success of wider flowers
   under repeated visits of pollinators. Decreased pollen fall, probably
   due to more gentle contact between pollen and bees in flowers with wider
   corollas, may be one of the mechanisms underlying the selection on
   corolla width of C. punctata.}},

Abstract = {{1 Pollen limitation of female fertility has often been documented in
   animal-pollinated plants, but seldom have the ecological mechanisms
   responsible been investigated. We examined factors influencing pollen
   limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which
   pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination.
   Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake
   Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the
   edge of its familial range.
   2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability
   of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average
   of 57.6\%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because
   the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen
   limitation was prevalent throughout the 3-4-week blooming period in one
   population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of
   flowering, despite their close proximity.
   3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatients) to R. virginica flowers
   were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was
   recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was
   0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but
   on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity
   was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions.
   4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R.
   virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2\% of pollen removed
   from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen
   removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average,
   47.3\% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis.
   5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen
   limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the
   proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the
   intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing
   mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees
   compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of the dioecious, neo-tropical plant genus Clusia secrete a
   viscous, hydrophobic resin from glandular tissues in both male and
   female flowers. This substance is readily gathered by meliponine and
   euglossine bees for whom it most often serves as the sole pollinator
   reward. Bees use Clusia resin as a nest-building material. As such,
   resin clearly serves an indispensable mechanical function. However,
   resins with antimicrobial properties may also serve to reduce the risk
   of pathogenesis in the nest. If resin-gathering apids benefit from
   antimicrobial properties in nesting materials and are able to discern
   these characteristics in the forage they gather, one might predict that
   the resin reward presented in Clusia could have evolved under selection
   for both mechanical and antimicrobial properties. In dioecious species,
   where females and males each present a resin reward, selection regimes
   may differ between the sexes with the result that resin form and
   function diverge. We investigated both the form and function of the male
   and female pollinator reward resins of Clusia grandiflora. Using
   thin-layer chromatography (TLC), we compared the chemical compositions
   of floral resins from five widely separated populations of this species
   growing in southeastern Venezuela. We found that male and female resins
   exhibited a marked chemical dimorphism, with females having two major
   TLC-resolvable fractions and males having seven. This dimorphism was
   stable: there were no component differences between populations in
   either sex. Using a disk-diffusion technique, we surveyed the same
   resins for antimicrobial activity using assay microorganisms isolated
   from eusocial meliponine bees. Both male and female Clusia grandiflora
   resins had pronounced but relatively directed antimicrobial activity:
   both were toxic to 10 of 11 Gram-positive bacteria, 7 of 15
   Gram-negative or variably-staining bacteria, 0 of 3 yeasts, and 0 of 3
   filamentous fungi. Again with the disk-diffusion technique, we performed
   more detailed tests of resin bioactivity using two Gram-positive
   honeybee associates, Paenibacillus larvae and P. alvei, as model
   pathogens. Both male and female C. grandiflora resins were highly toxic
   to these honeybee pathogens. Female resin, however, produced zones of
   inhibition with more than twice the mean diameter of those produced by
   the male resin. This divergence in form and function of the C.
   grandiflora pollinator reward resins could be in response to different
   selective regimes as mediated by the pollinating insects.}},

   collected using headspace methods and was analysed by combined gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The natural scented inflorescence
   models attracted significantly (p < 0.0001) more insects than the
   non-scented models. Although the total amount of floral scent produced
   decreased steadily during the daily flowering, individual compounds
   showed three patterns of variation: a steady decrease, an increase
   during the morning followed by a steady decrease, and an increase during
   the morning and midday followed by a steady decrease. The variation in
   chemical composition of the floral scent of staminate and pistillate
   flowers on the same individuals was as large as it was between all
   pistillate and staminate samples and individuals investigated. The
   diurnal variation in floral scent production and composition is

   male euglossine bees are regarded as potentially important pollinators

Abstract = {{Flowers of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum, are attacked by
   nectar-thieving ants of Formica neorufibarbus. Plants in this species
   display continuous variation in floral form from long, broadly-flared
   flowers to short, narrow flowers. This study addresses three aspects of
   the potential For ants to exert selection on floral traits in P.
   viscosum: the effect of ant visitation on seed production, the
   relationship between ant visitation patterns and variation in floral
   form among co-occurring individuals, and the behavioral mechanisms
   underlying nonrandom flower;er choice by ants. Ants visiting flowers of
   P. viscosum interfere with seed production by dislodging the style from
   the ovary. In 1982 and 1997 plants protected from ant visits set
   significantly more seeds per flower than open controls. Plants with
   broadly-flared flowers incurred significantly higher rates of ant damage
   than individuals with narrower flowers in 1995. Similarly, in 1997,
   damage increased significantly with plant score on a principal component
   positively correlated to corolla flare and length. Ant abundance
   declines with elevation above timberline, and, in 1997, damage
   associated with corolla flare and length was significantly greater for
   plants in the timberline (krummholz) habitat than fur plants higher on
   the alpine tundra. Laboratory choice trials showed that ants prefer
   flowers with lung broadly-flared corollas over flowers with short narrow
   corollas, Ant preference may reflect differences in floral reward:
   broadly-flared flowers contain more nectar sugar than narrow ones in P.
   viscosum. Additionally energetic costs associated with nectar collection
   depend in part on flower form. In choice experiments, handling time, or
   the time required for an ant to move from the corolla opening to the
   nectary decreased significantly with corolla flare and was also less
   variable for ants choosing broadly-flared flowers than those choosing
   narrow ones. Ants have the potential to exert selection on flower form
   in P. viscosum, as their activity negatively affects the female
   component of reproductive fitness and is nonrandomly associated with
   different floral phenotypes. In this system, enemies show similar flower
   choice patterns to bumblebee pollinators, and their behavior may help
   maintain heritable variation in newer form within populations of P.
   viscosum.}},

   pollination guilds found in gingers in Sarawak are comparable to the
   pollination guilds of neotropical Zingiberales, i.e., hummingbird; and
   euglossine-bee-pollinated guilds. Canonical discriminant analysis
   revealed that there were significant correlations between floral
   morphology and pollination guilds and suggests the importance of
   plant-pollinator interactions in the evolution of floral morphology.
   Most species in the three guilds were separated on the plot by the first

   longer floral tubes, while Amegilla-pollinated flowers had wider lips
   than the others, which function as a platform for the pollinators.
   Pistils and stamens of halictid-pollinated flowers were smaller than the
   others. The fact that gingers with diverse morphologies in a forest with

   resources. The sites we sampled were separated by 0.5 to > 1450 km, and
   spanned three distinct deserts and four vegetation zones. We found that
   species of Larrea pollen specialist bees occurred at more sites and
   tended to be more abundant than generalists. Surprisingly, spatial
   turnover was high for both pollen specialist and generalist bee species
   at all distances, and species composition of samples from sites 1-5 km
   apart varied as much as repeat samples made at single sites.
   Nevertheless, the pattern of bee species turnover was not haphazard. As
   distance among sites increased faunal similarity of sites decreased.
   Faunal similarities among sites within 250 km of each other were
   generally greater than if randomly distributed over all sites (the null
   model). No single ecological category of species (widespread, localized,
   Larrea pollen specialist, floral generalist) accounted for this spatial
   predictability. Evidently, concordant local distribution patterns of
   many ecologically diverse species contribute to the non-random spatial
   pattern. The ecological dominance of creosote bush does not confer
   obvious ecological advantages to its specialist floral visitors. Spatial
   turnover is comparable to that found for bee guilds from other
   biogeographic regions of the world and is not therefore limited to those
   bee species that inhabit highly seasonal climates, such as deserts.
   Philopatry and differences in bloom predictability among sites are
   probably more important causes for spatial turnover of bee species than
   are interspecific competition for nest sites or floral resources. (C)

Abstract = {{1. Females of the desert solitary bee Anthophora pauperata collect
   nectar and pollen almost exclusively from Alkanna orientalis
   (Boraginaceae). The bee and plant are found together in the early
   spring, living in the bottom of steep-sided wadis (dry river valleys) at
   an altitude of 1500 m in Egyptian Sinai.
   2. Female A. pauperata showed clear morning and afternoon peaks in
   foraging activity, separated by a 2-3 h midday period spent in their
   underground nests. This study analyses the following in order to
   identify the factors structuring this daily pattern: thermal aspects of
   the bee and its environment, temporal patterns of resource provision by
   the plant, and female nectar and pollen foraging behaviour.
   3. Although A. pauperata can generate substantial heat endothermically,
   morning and evening ambient temperatures well below 10 degrees C defined
   a thermal window within which foraging occurred. Maximum air
   temperatures were moderate (25-30 degrees C), and examination of the
   physiology and behaviour of A. pauperata suggests that the midday
   reduction in flight activity was not due to thermal constraints.
   4. Alkanna orientalis produces protandrous hermaphroditic flowers.
   Female A. pauperata collected pollen from male-phase flowers and
   harvested nectar preferentially from female-phase flowers. Although the
   nectar standing crop was relatively constant throughout the day, pollen
   availability peaked strongly in the early afternoon.
   5. Female A. pauperata visited young male-phase flowers as soon as they
   opened, generating an early afternoon peak in pollen foraging activity
   and depleting the pollen standing crop rapidly. A morning peak in pollen
   foraging occurred when females gleaned remnant pollen from flowers that
   had opened the previous day. Pollen availability in the morning was far
   lower than in the early afternoon, and the time taken to collect a full
   pollen load in the morning was significantly longer. Collection of
   pollen in the morning despite very low resource availability suggests
   that pollen may be a limiting resource for A. pauperata.
   6. In contrast to many existing examples of bimodal activity patterns in
   highly endothermic bees, the bimodal activity patterns of female A.
   pauperata appear to be driven not by thermal considerations but by daily
   patterns of pollen release from its principal food source.}},

   whether hybridization. realized mating system within populations or
   colonization from different Pleistocene refugia might explain some of
   the morphological variation, the genetic structure of 19 populations
   from central and southern Europe was studied using starch gel
   electrophoresis and 10 enzyme loci, of which eight were polymorphic. A
   pattern typical of an outcrossing species was expected because ii.
   lycoctonum flowers are adapted to pollination by long-tongued
   bumblebees. However, heterozygosity was very low (between 0.031 and
   0.150), which is atypical of either widespread or outcrossing species.
   The inbreeding coefficient, F-IS, also suggested inbreeding in more than
   half the: populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that 31\%
   of the genetic variation is found among populations, again suggesting
   inbreeding. A neighbour-joining tree based on Reynolds's genetic
   distance showed a clear separation between the central/eastern European
   populations and the samples from the Iberian peninsula and Alpes
   Maritimes. These data are consistent with the hypothesized refugia and
   the phylogeographical histories of several European forest trees. The
   genetic identity of all populations was very high, suggesting that all
   investigated populations belong to the same species despite high
   morphological variability. Hybridization was not supported by the data.}},

   animals, but only phyllostomid bats, especially Phyllostomus hastatus
   and Phyllostomus discolor, played a relevant role promoting
   cross-pollination, Pollinations which occurred in the early morning by
   diurnal floral visitors were ineffective since pollen tubes did not
   traverse the style and reach the ovary before stylar abscission. Despite
   the apparently normal growth of the self-pollen tubes, controlled
   pollinations carried out in one tree revealed no fruit set by selfing
   and 16.8\% fruit set by crossing. Progeny analysis from this
   `self-incompatible' tree using isozyme markers showed that fruits
   resulting from mixed-pollination (i.e., 50\% self-plus 50\% cross-pollen
   on the stigma) set only 1.6\% of selfed seeds. The percentage of
   outcrossed seeds in fruits resulting from open-pollination in two
   neighbouring planted trees, which flowered in isolation and
   concomitantly, was estimated at 91\% and 71\%. Two isolated trees did

   midnight (or until the early morning in S. nutans). After midnight and
   until midday, nectar volume in non-visited flowers (except S. dioica)
   decreased. Nectar volume in non-visited S. dioica flowers increased
   constantly with flower age, indicating a stable nectar secretion rate,
   possibly favouring both day- and night-active flower visitors. Even at
   the time of highest nectar secretion, all species studied presented
   several nectarless flowers. Sucrose dominance in the nectar of the
   nocturnal species S. nutans and Saponaria officinalis fits well with the
   general syndrome of flowers pollinated by hawkmoths. The syndrome also
   applies to the nocturnal but regularly selfing, S. noctiflora. The more
   generalistic species S. dioica and S. vulgaris, which are regularly
   visited by bumblebees as well as nocturnal moths, secreted
   hexose-dominant nectar. Unexpectedly, Silene alba, the only nocturnal
   species that strictly excluded day-active flower visitors by closing
   flowers during the day, also secreted hexose-dominant nectar. In some

   between hermaphroditic, male, and female flowers. Female flowers of S.

Abstract = {{This study describes the interaction between Hormathophylla spinosa, a
   crucifer shrub, and its pollinators, analyzing the spatiotemporal
   variability of the pollinator assemblage as well as the foraging
   behavior and effectiveness of the common pollinators. The study was
   carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four
   years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located
   along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during
   the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging
   to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H.
   spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary
   bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There
   were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the
   distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were
   leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as
   pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production.
   Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds:
   nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and
   hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation
   rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the
   slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively
   between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved
   between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit
   than did nectarivores. H. spinosa interacted most frequently with the
   nectarivorous Proformica longiseta, Fannia scalaris, and Exechia
   dorsalis in the two lowest elevation populations of Sierra Nevada, and
   with the pollinivorous Colletes sp. and Eristalis tenax in the highest
   elevation population. The mutualistic interaction between H. spinosa and
   its pollinators is a generalized system, where the traits of the flower
   allow almost every floral visitor to act as a true, effective,
   pollinator. The lack of differences in per-visit pollination
   effectiveness and the functional equivalence of very different
   pollinators may help to maintain this generalized system.}},

   transgenic B. napus and wild B. rapa from Denmark. F-1 progeny were
   backcrossed to B. rapa and BC1 plants were selected for chromosome
   numbers similar to B. rapa. Further backcrossing resulted in a BC2
   generation that was hemizygous for herbicide resistance. We quantified
   the reproductive success of 457 BC3 progeny representing six full-sib
   families raised in growth rooms (plants were pollinated by captive
   bumblebees). Pollen fertility and seed production of BC3 plants were as
   great as those of B. rapa raised in the same growth rooms. Segregation
   for herbicide resistance in BC3 plants was 1:1 overall, but the

Abstract = {{In studying the relationship between floral syndrome and pollen transfer
   in an endangered plant Liriodendron chinense (Hemsl.) Sarg., three
   natural populations in Guizhou, Hunan and Zhejiang Provinces of China
   were respectively chosen for the field work throughout the florescence.
   The role of wind-pollination in this species could be ignored as the
   pollen quantity decreased rapidly with the increasing distance. In spite
   of morphological protogyny, pollen viability and the life-span of
   receptive stigmas overlaped more than 24 h. Anatomically, anther sac has
   four locules with unequally thickened endothecium which may affect
   anther to dehisce. There were many secretory cells (and groups of
   fluorescent cells) at the base of petals and styles, but PAS reaction
   indicated that polyhexose was mostly concentrated in the cells around
   the vascular bundle of petals. Fluorescent cells and flower fragrance
   were regarded as attractants, nectar and pollen as rewards to visitors.
   The floral syndrome seems to be adaptive to insect pollination. During
   1994 to 1996, a total number of thirty-nine species of insects including
   bees, flies and beetles were recognized as the flower visitors. Among
   which only four were present in all the three populations. The visiting
   frequency varied distinctly from species to species and among
   populations. While bees were observed as the most frequent visitors in
   the population in Guizhou Province, they were substituted by flies in
   the other two populations in Hunan and Zhejiang Province and became
   occasional visitors themselves. The beetles, despite of their frequent
   activity in flowers, played a much less important role in
   cross-pollination. Comparing the mean pollen numbers deposited on
   stigmas per visit, it was found that bees were much more effective than
   flies in pollination. SEM examination of insect body also supported this
   point. Moreover, the visiting frequency was also observed to be closely
   associated with the characters of flower blossom. Visitors preferred to
   visit those flowers in early anthesis. Treatments of emasculation and
   perianth removal showed that the rewards of nectar was more attractive
   than pollen to pollinators. This species is tend to be cross-pollinated
   by insects but without its faithful pollinators.}},

   to transfer pollen grains among clones. Fruit and seed sets in C.

   number of compatible pollen grains, Although C. sepium clones were also

Abstract = {{The reproductive success of Mandevilla pentlandiana was studied to
   disclose its reproductive strategy, and to determine the links between
   nectar production, breeding system, fruit set and inflorescence size.
   The plant produces many inflorescences with a large number of flowers
   but initiates few fruits (9\%). This vine is self-compatible but not
   autogamous. Given that no significant differences could be detected
   considering many traits (ripe and abortive fruit sets, fruit quality and
   seedling survival) between the pollination treatments (self-, cross- and
   natural-), the low natural fruit set was not related to pollen
   limitation. Fruits were not distributed at random within inflorescences
   (earlier Fruits had the highest probability of maturation) but there
   were no significant differences in fruit quality according to different
   fruit positions. Conversely, the time of fruit initiation influenced
   most of the fruit-traits. Many developing fruits were aborted (20\%). An
   increase in the probability of abortion was detected when the whole
   inflorescence was hand pollinated. In addition, a positive correlation
   was detected between the abortions and the number of ripe fruits which
   developed before them. Looking at our data from an evolutionary
   perspective, we argue that a theoretical inflorescence size,
   corresponding to the intersection point between the mean values of fruit
   number and fruit set per inflorescence, can be assumed to indicate the
   optimum inflorescence size that maximizes equally both female and male
   functions. Comparison between the theoretical and the observed mean
   inflorescence size suggests, that for M, pentlandiana, pollen donation

Abstract = {{Pollination-related and time-dependent floral morphological changes
   occur in a diverse set of angiosperm taxa and appear to be particularly
   common in species occupying resource-limited environments. In deer weed

   yellow to orange and a folding of the banner petal down over the keel.
   These changes are rapidly induced by pollination, but will also occur
   much more slowly without pollination. Orange flowers typically lack
   nectar and pollen. We examined the reproductive success of these plants
   to test the hypothesis that retention of orange flowers increases
   pollinator visitation rate and fruit set while reducing costs to the
   pollinators. All of the common species of bee pollinators that visited
   deer weed easily distinguished between yellow and orange flowers at
   close range and preferentially probed yellow flowers. Retention of
   orange flowers by these plants resulted in a higher frequency of
   pollinator visits and a higher fruit set per flower than plants that
   lacked orange flowers. The number of flowers visited by each pollinator
   was lower on plants with a mixture of yellow and orange flowers,

Abstract = {{Stanhopeinae are a group of tropical American orchids characterized by
   euglossine bee pollination and lateral inflorescences stemming from the

   configurations are tetracytic. Chlorenchyma is homogeneous and
   characterized by fibre bundles in adaxial/abaxial or
   adaxial/median/abaxial positions. Collateral vascular bundles occur in a
   single row and feature phloic and xylic sclerenchymatous caps and
   thin-walled bundle sheath cells. Fibre bundles and vascular sclerenchyma
   are accompanied by stegmata containing conical silica bodies.
   Pseudobulbs have thick-walled turbinate epidermal cells and ground
   tissue of smaller, living assimilatory cells and larger, dead
   water-storage cells. Fibre bundles are usually absent but occur in
   several genera. Collateral vascular bundles show phloic sclerenchyma,
   but xylic sclerenchyma occurs only in the larger vascular bundles.
   Phloic and xylic sclerenchyma are associated with stegmata containing
   conical silica bodies. Roots are velamentous. Velamen cell walls have
   fine, spiral thickenings. Exodermal cells are thin-walled. The cortex
   features scattered thick-walled cells and in some cases branched bars of
   secondary cell wall material. Endodermis is either boolean OR- or
   O-thickened, but pericycle is always O-thickened opposite the phloem.

   simultaneous flowering responses of a new crop plant, Limnanthes alba

   (Hydrophyllaceae), to five lifetime UV-B dosages ranging between 2.74
   and 15.93 kJ.m(-2).d(-1), Floral traits known to link plant pollination
   with bee host preference, host fidelity and larval development were
   measured. Intensified UV-B had no overall effect on nectar and pollen
   production of L. alba and P. campanularia flowers. A quadratic
   relationship between UV-B and nectar sugar production occurred in P.
   campanularia and showed that even subambient UV-B dosages can be
   deleterious for a floral trait. Other floral responses to UV-B were more
   dramatic and idiosyncratic. As UV-B dosage increased, L. alba plants
   were less likely to flower, but suffered no delays in flowering or
   reductions to lifetime flower production for those that did Bower.
   Conversely, an equal proportion of P. campanularia plants flowered under
   all UV-B treatments, but these same plants experienced delayed onset to
   bloom and produced fewer flowers at greater UV-B intensities. Therefore,
   intensified UV-B elicits idiosyncratic responses in flowering phenology
   and flower production from these two annual plants. Diurnal patterns in
   nectar and pollen production strongly coincided with fluctuating
   humidity and only weakly with UV-B dosage. Overall, our results

Abstract = {{Pollination strategies of Gladiolus one of the largest genera of the
   monocot family Iridaceae, are unusually diverse and involve various bee
   species, foraging either for nectar or for pollen, or moths, a large
   butterfly, passerine birds, and long-proboscid flies foraging for
   nectar. The latter system has been demonstrated for 16 species of
   Gladiolus of diverse taxonomic affinities. These species are primarily
   or exclusively pollinated by flies with elongate mouthparts. All have
   similar flowers with a slender, elongate perianth tube, mostly 25-50 mm
   long, a white to cream or pink perianth, usually marked with pink or red
   nectar guides on the lower tepals, and lack floral odor. The flowers
   produce ample quantities of sucrose-rich to sucrose-dominant nectar of
   moderate sugar concentration. Each of these species is pollinated by one
   or two species of flies of the families Tabanidae or Nemestrinidae,
   which have mouthparts usually 20-60 mm long, exceptionally to 80 mm in
   Moegistorhynchus longirostris. An important aspect of long-proboscid
   fly-pollination systems is the formation of guilds in which a number of
   species of plants of differ ent genera and families have similar flowers
   and utilize the same pollinator. In these guilds pollen placement on the
   pollinator's body is fairly precise, and different members of a guild at
   any site use different parts of the pollinator's body for pollen
   transport. An additional 13 species of southern African Gladiolus have
   flowers conforming to those pollinated by long-proboscid flies and are
   thus inferred to have this pollination strategy These species extend
   from the southern,African winter-rainfall zone in the southwest to the
   Drakensberg Mountains of the eastern half of the subcontinent and flower
   at precisely the times that long-proboscid flies are on the wing, mostly
   late spring in the west (mid September to November) or late summer in
   the east (February to April). An autumn-flowering guild using a
   different fly species occurs in the southern part of the winter-rainfall
   zone. The taxonomic relationships of Gladiolus species pollinated by
   long-proboscid flies are diverse with these 29 species falling in six of
   the seven sections of the genus occurring in southern Africa, and the
   pollination system appears to have evolved independently in each

Abstract = {{The assertion that the recently introduced large earth bumblebee, Bombus
   terrestris, does not compete with other bees was investigated by
   examining the impact of B. terrestris on the foraging of two species of
   Chalicodoma (Megachilidae) on flowers of Gompholobium huegelii
   (Fabaceae). Chalicodoma spp. spent less time at each flower during the
   afternoon in quadrats where B. terrestris foraged than at quadrats from
   which B. terrestris was excluded, indicating that standing crops of
   nectar were depleted by B. terrestris during the course of the day. This
   decline in resources was associated with reductions in the numbers of
   flowers visited, and the amount of time spent foraging, by Chalicodoma
   spp. II is proposed that the native bees avoided foraging in the quadrat
   where B, terrestris occurred as a response to reduced foraging
   efficiency in that situation. Thus, B. terrestris displaced these two
   species of Chalicodoma through competition for a limited resource. The
   high densities at which B. terrestris occurred, together with its
   ability to Forage at lower ambient temperatures than the native bees,
   exacerbated the impact of this exotic species. The possibility that this
   will adversely affect pollination in G. huegelii is also discussed.}},

Pages = {{361-384}},
Abstract = {{Overlap between plants in the bee species visiting their flowers was
   investigated in three vegetation types near Hobart in southern Tasmania.
   Visitor profiles of plants were influenced by flowering phenology, the
   vegetation type in which they occurred, blossom shape and colour, and
   botanical family. Most Colletidae, especially in the subfamilies
   Euryglossinae and Hylaeinae, predominantly visited brush-like
   inflorescences and/or members of Myrtaceae. However, some Colletidae,
   particularly in the subfamily Colletinae, were oligolectic on
   non-myrtaceous petaloid flowers. Many Halictidae were polylectic, others
   foraged predominantly on the yellow zygomorphic flowers of Fabaceae,
   while others were largely restricted to non-yellow actinomorphic
   flowers. Both species of Anthophoridae were polylectic, whereas both
   species of Megachilidae were narrowly polylectic on non-white flowers.
   It is argued that pollination of nectarless flowers is likely to be
   enhanced by the presence of petaloid nectariferous flowers, particularly
   Fabaceae and Leucopogon spp., which provide carbohydrates for their bee
   pollinators. Mutualism between sequentially, and also possibly
   concomitantly, flowering nectariferous flowers is also likely via
   support of shared bee pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Computer aided systems based on image analysis have become popular in
   zoological systematics in the recent years. For insects in particular,
   the difficult taxonomy and the lack of experts greatly hampers studies
   on conservation and ecology. This problem was emphasized at the UN
   Conference of Environment, Rio 1992, leading to a directive to intensify
   efforts to develop automated identification systems for pollinating
   insects. We have developed a system for the automated identification of
   bee species which employs image analysis to classify bee forewings.
   Using the knowledge of a zoological expert to create learning sets of
   images together with labels indicating the species membership, we have
   formulated this problem in the framework of supervised learning. While
   the image analysis process is documented in {[}5], we describe in this
   paper a new model for classification that consists of a combination of
   Linear Discriminant Analysis with a de-noising technique based on a
   nonlinear generalization of principal component analysis, called Kernel
   PCA. This model combines the property of visualization provided by
   Linear Discriminant Analysis with powerful feature extraction and leads
   to significantly improved classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Communality is considered a widespread form of social organization in
   bees and wasps, one in which two or more females of the same generation
   share a common nest and amongst whom there is no reproductive division
   of labor. The evolution and maintenance of egalitarian communal
   societies poses theoretical difficulties where `cheating' amongst
   nestmates is practised. Yet there is little knowledge of the intranidal
   social interactions among communal conspecifics that allow an
   understanding of the degree of cooperation versus exploitation amongst
   nestmates in such societies. Using a circle-tube arena, we staged
   interactions in the laboratory among pairs of female conspecifics using
   two communal andrenid species, Andrena scotica and Panurgus calcaratus,
   to score their cooperative and aggressive behaviors. For both species,
   females did not discriminate between familiar (nestmate) and unfamiliar
   (non-nestmate) conspecifics in their cooperative and aggressive
   behaviors, suggesting that there is universal acceptance of
   conspecifics. Levels of cooperation and aggression did not vary with the
   number of nestmates in the nest of origin for either species. In
   addition, frequencies of social interactions did not vary with body
   size, wing wear or ovarian development in P. calcaratus. Interspecific
   comparisons were made with published data on social interactions of
   other bee species at varying levels of social organization (solitary to
   eusocial) derived from analogous circle-tube experiments. Panurgus
   calcaratus displayed highly cooperative behavior, similar to that of a
   previously studied communal bee, Lasioglossum hemichalceum (Kukuk,
   1992a). Andrena scotica displayed lower levels of cooperation, and was
   in this sense more similar to solitary species and to interactions
   amongst non-nestmate individuals of eusocial species. Both A. scotica
   and P. calcaratus displayed very low levels of aggressive behavior,
   again similar to L. hemichalceum. As a working hypothesis, we suggest
   the existence of a communal behavioral syndrome comprising high levels
   of intranidal cooperation and low aggression, both directed
   indiscriminately at conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{The typical Mediterranean phrygana has a very rich biodiversity of
   plants and of solitary bees. Fire may kill the brood of soil-nesting and
   other solitary bees and may affect pollen and nectar sources. Such
   changes would be expected to influence seed production in populations of
   post-fire obligate seeder species and thus also their population
   dynamics. We compared nectar standing crop, flower visitation rate of
   bumble bees and solitary bees, and consequent seed production in a
   typical Mediterranean shrub (Salvia fruticosa Miller) growing in
   unburned east Mediterranean phrygana vegetation and in an adjacent
   burned area. The volume of nectar standing crop in the burned area was
   higher than in the unburned area, while the nectar concentration showed
   the opposite trend. The mean frequency of Bombus' visits was higher in
   the burned area, while solitary bees visited flowers only in the
   unburned habitats. The seed production of S. fruticosa was significantly
   lower in the burned area. This reduction might have a long-term effect
   on post-fire species composition and abundance due to the fact that this
   species is an obligate post-fire seeder. The present evidence indicates
   that the bee-dependent pollination environment was not re-balanced even
   six years after fire. This situation has important implications

Abstract = {{Conventional pollen load analyses have calculated the proportion of pure

   flower species multiplied by the proportion of bees carrying that

   however, bumble bees were more efficient than the common agricultural
   practice of using the electric bee 2-3 times a week. Even in the

   percentage of fruit set was obtained by the bees. Under these adverse

Abstract = {{The reproductive phenology of a population of 39 adult trees of
   Couratari multiflora was studied in `terra firme' forests located 90 km
   N of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Trees of this species, found in low
   densities, were inventoried in a 400-ha plot in which only one tree
   greater than or equal to 20 cm DBH per 10 ha was encountered. This
   species flowers from January to June, with a peak in the mid-wet season
   (March), and fruits during the dry season (May-September). Median
   distances between synchronized flowering trees were 600 to 1000 m
   depending on the time of the flowering season. The number of synchronous
   flowering trees at each observation date in the 400-ha plot was 14 or
   17.5 per 1 d, 13 (both) per 15 d, and three or 13 per 30 d, depending
   upon which of the two methods was used to evaluate synchrony. Fifty
   percent of the flowering trees overlapped in flowering with six to seven
   other flowering trees growing within a radius of 1000 m during most of
   the annual flowering period. Outcrossing rates were 100 \% and the
   relatively long distances between trees in flower at the same time,
   support the assumption that this species is pollinated by pollinators
   travelling distances as far as 1000 m.}},

Abstract = {{Various factors known to affect fruit set in self-incompatible plants

   significant positive correlation between genetic variation and

Abstract = {{The breakdown of species integrity was studied in three sympatric

   multivariate analysis. Satyrium erectum x S. bicorne and S. erectum x S.
   coriifolium hybrids were common, while only one S. bicorne x SI
   coriifolium hybrid was found (a new record). Reciprocal artificial
   crossing experiments confirmed that genetic compatibility exists between
   all three species. However, the species have different pollinators:
   moths in S. bicorne, bees in S. erectum and sunbirds in S. coriifolium.
   Pollinators, rather than genetic factors, therefore, appear to be
   responsible for reproductive isolation between these species. Breakdown
   in pollinator specificity results in interspecific pollen transfer and
   the formation of hybrids. Overlap in floral signals, including nocturnal
   scent in both S. erectum and S. bicorne, and bright coloration in both
   S. erectum and S. coriifolium, facilitates the formation of hybrids
   between these species pairs. The brown, scented flowers of S. bicorne,
   on the other hand, share no obvious floral signals with the bright
   orange, unscented flowers of S. coriifolium, accounting for the rarity
   of hybrids between this species pair. Differences in floral morphology
   also result in mechanical isolation between these two species. Since the
   three species are sympatric in a very small part of their geographic
   ranges, it is unlikely that avoidance of hybridization has been an

Pages = {{281-298}},
Abstract = {{Various aspects of the reproductive biology of the Andean-disjunct genus
   Retanilla (DC.) Brongn. were studied in populations of R. trinervia and
   R. ephedra located in central Chile and of R. patagonica in southern
   Argentina. Flowering extends from -austral- winter (early spring in R.
   patagonica) to early summer. The small, white, entomophilous flowers are
   incompletely protandrous and last four to five days. A weak pleasant
   odor along with nectar and pollen attract thirty-seven diurnal insect
   species, ten of which are probable pollinators: these include the honey
   bee, eight species of solitary bees pertaining to Anthophoridae (1 sp.),
   Colletidae (3 spp.) and Halictidae (4 spp.), and a nemestrinid fly.
   Although flower morphology and individual flower phenology do not fully
   prevent self-pollination (and geitonogamy can easily take place), the
   level of autogamy is low. Therefore, some self-incompatibility mechanism
   seems operative in Retanilla. Fruit set of open-pollinated flowers is
   extremely low, with a maximal value of c. 3\% in R. patagonica. In this
   species, ripe fruits contain on average 1.37 viable seeds. Predispersal
   (maternal) reproductive success (percent ovules becoming viable seeds)
   is 2.3\%. For medium to full-sized individuals this corresponds to c.
   4600 potential offspring per year. As presently known, Retanilla is a
   reproductively uniform group, in which the Andean disjunction seems to
   have exerted no particular impact, which is consistent with the view
   that pollination generalization exerts some stabilizing influence on
   floral morphology and other reproductive traits. Retanilla expresses a
   basic rhamnacean set of traits (including protandry and
   self-incompatibility) showing also high pollen production and secondary
   pollen presentation. The latter two traits seem characteristic of the
   Retanilla-Trevoa an clade, suggesting that a trend to increased male
   effort and, perhaps, dependence upon pollen-eating has evolved within
   the tribe Colletieae.}},

   Although this division keeps the same stages as before, a different
   interpretation is implied to cell preprovisioning which is, henceforth,
   given in connection to prevalent forms of inter-caste behaviors. This
   procedure. in its turn, has improved previous concepts relatively to
   patrolling behavior by the queen. In addition, an interim approach to
   the main aspects related to POP sociogenesis is attempted. Behavioral
   strifes taking place at the vicini-ty of a mass provisioned brood cell
   are seen as corner-stones of POP evolution. Indeed, likely relies of
   those behaviors are of trivial presence in many species. Invariable
   occurrence of highly eusocial behavior becomes difficult to identify in
   studied taxa, whose POP syndrome is basal. On bionomic and taxonomic
   grounds, it seems reasonable to suppose that integrated syndromes (overt
   queen dominance, high intercaste generalized agitation, many cells
   synchronically provisioned, etc,), are evolutionarily low-ranked
   relative to disintegrated syndromes (ritualized queen dominance, low
   cell-localized inter-caste agitation, cells provisioned one by one,

   derivation from a former not yet integrated stage of which
   identification among extant species is difficult presently. On taxonomic
   grounds, Melipona has sometimes been considered the sister-group of
   stingless bees (a proposal not uniformly accepted by specialists).
   Concerning POP aspects, congruence with this position is tenable, as
   Melipona POP is certainly less elaborate than in integrated taxa.}},

   visit and with the pollen it carries during transport. These
   interactions typically cause some portions of a flower's pollen to
   experience different transport conditions than other portions.
   We model three classes of heterogeneous transport conditions to assess
   their effects on pollen dispersal. Two classes occur when the pollen
   carried by individual pollinators becomes spatially structured.
   ``Horizontal{''} structure arises when areas of a pollinator's body
   differ in their frequency or intensity of contact with anthers and/or
   stigmas. Alternatively, ``vertical{''} structure develops when
   pollinators do not disturb their pollen load, causing pollen to
   accumulate on the pollinator's body in layers, so that much pollen is
   temporarily inaccessible to stigmas. The third class of heterogeneity
   occurs when the pollinators that visit a flower differ consistently with
   respect to pollen transfer from pollinator to stigmas. These classes of
   heterogeneous transport produce similar mean patterns of pollen
   dispersal, which differ from that expected if transported pollen acts as
   a homogeneous population. In particular, near and far recipient flowers
   receive proportionately more of the donor pollen reaching stigmas than
   predicted for a single population. Reanalysis of data in the literature
   illustrates that predictions based on heterogeneous transport conditions
   are more representative of observed dispersal patterns than predictions
   of the traditional characterization of pollen dispersal. We also
   demonstrate that stochastic variation between flowers in pollen donation
   and receipt does not affect the arithmetic mean pattern of pollen
   dispersal, although it does reduce the geometric mean.
   Although the different types of heterogeneous transport conditions
   produce similar mean patterns of pollen dispersal, the influences of
   specific floral and pollinator characteristics on dispersal can depend
   on the type(s) of heterogeneity involved. In particular, pistil
   characteristics should affect dispersal independently of stamen
   characteristics when horizontal heterogeneity governs transport
   dynamics, but not when pollen accumulates in layers. This relation is
   likely reflected in many aspects of floral divergence among related taxa
   pollinated by different vectors and convergent design among unrelated
   taxa served by similar vectors.}},

Abstract = {{The preferences for nectar amino acids, urea and ammonium ions of
   peacock butterflies, Inachis io, were tested experimentally. Females
   clearly preferred a mimic of Lantana camara nectar containing amino
   acids to an otherwise similar plain sugar solution, whereas males did
   not discriminate between these test solutions. Neither males nor females
   discriminated between the full mixture of amino acids in a mimic of L.
   camara a nectar and similar test solutions containing only the single
   amino acids arginine or proline. Furthermore, the butterflies were not
   able to detect methionine in the test solutions. Both sexes detected and
   preferred ammonium ions in test solutions but showed no response to
   urea. These results support the hypothesis that butterflies can select
   for high amino acid concentrations in floral nectar. However, it seems
   unlikely that they select for particular amino acids. The rather
   unspecific response of I. io males to the nectar constituents tested may
   result from their relatively low demand for nitrogen for spermatophore
   and sperm production, while their high activity may make energy supply
   (i.e. sugar) more important. The preference for ammonium ions suggests
   that I. io could also acquire nitrogen from ammonium-contaminated soil
   by puddling, as has been shown for sodium in swallowtail butterflies.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination biology, reproductive output, and population structure of
   male and female plants and flowers of Smilax herbacea were studied in
   nearly 900 individuals from 11 roadside populations in northeast-central
   Connecticut over a three-year period. Percentages of either sex did not
   vary across sites or between years. Reproductive plants represented 60\%
   of an average population and nearly 65\% of these were male. Female
   mortality is suggested as the most likely reason for the strong male
   bias (2.3 male:1 female). The male plants, although smaller, had twice
   the number of inflorescences, and 68\% more flowers than female plants.
   Both inflorescence and flower number were significantly correlated with
   plant size in male plants. This correlation was absent for female plants
   implying that male plants are less constrained in the number of
   inflorescences and flowers they can produce. Although site size,
   population size, and population density of both female and male plants
   varied significantly across sites, gender and overall plant densities
   were not correlated with site size. However, a significant interaction
   was found between the densities of each sex and the site of their
   occurrence, suggesting that distribution of gender patterns may be
   influenced by site-specific ecological factors. Smilax herbacea can be
   characterized as a generalist in its attraction of pollinators. The
   carrion-like odor produced in tepals of male and female flowers, and the
   pollen reward of the staminate flowers attract bees, beetles, and flies.
   Due primarily to their high mobility and good pollen carrying capacity,
   andrenid and halictid bees and anthomyiid and stratiomyiid flies are
   considered major pollinators. Minor pollinators include soldier
   (Cantharidae), long-homed (Cerambycidae), and fire-colored
   (Pyrochroidae) beetles. Overall fruit set was lower in 1995 than in 1994
   or 1996; this likely was due to unusually wet conditions that year. No
   significant difference in fruit set among populations was detected. Less
   than 1\% of intrapopulational fruit set variation was explained by
   either site size or by plant density. Male plant densities were not
   significantly correlated with fruit set across sites. Furthermore,
   experimental interpopulational crosses did not significantly increase
   fruit set. These facts imply resource rather than pollen limitation in
   female plants.}},

Abstract = {{Some species of flowering plants engage in nonmodel deceptive
   pollination, attracting pollinators by large nonmimetic floral displays
   and providing no reward. Pollinators can learn to avoid deceptive plants
   and to favor nectariferous species. The reproductive success of these
   species is expected to be density dependent for two opposite reasons:
   the commoner cheating flowers are, the easier they are to avoid and the
   lower the quality of the patch, making it more difficult to recognize
   that unrewarding flowers are not profitable. When a deceptive species is
   made up of multiple floral variants, pollinators' learning could
   decrease the reproductive success of any particularly common floral
   variant. Within a population of deceptive plants, mean reproductive
   success could, therefore, vary with the number of floral variants. We
   investigate these three hypotheses by modeling the behavior of
   pollinators foraging in communities of deceptive and rewarding flowers.
   Simulations revealed that the reproductive success of deceptive flowers
   varies in a density-dependent manner and that floral variants can be
   submitted to negative frequency-dependent selection. We compare density
   dependence in nonmodel deceptive species to what is expected in Batesian
   mimics and discuss possible selection of morphological variants.
   Finally, we survey how pollinators' learning capacities can make mean

Abstract = {{We investigated the relationships among a number of population and site
   characteristics and the ovule and seed production and seed set in 17
   populations of the rare, self-compatible, bumblebee-pollinated perennial
   Gentiana pneumonanthe L. in the Netherlands. Population size and
   offspring heterozygosity were used as population properties; grass and
   heath cover, soil concentrations of various ions, soil acidity (pH), and
   soil moisture were used as habitat characteristics. Our aim was to find
   out how important population size and genetic variation are for the seed
   production of a rare plant, when accounting for a number of habitat
   parameters that might also be important for successful reproduction.
   Correlation coefficients between population and habitat characteristics
   showed that sites with low soil moisture and higher concentration of
   most nutrients have a higher cover of grasses and a low cover of heath
   species. At such sites the population size of G. pneumonanthe was small
   and offspring heterozygosity was low. The number of ovules per fruit (a
   component of reproductive effort) was negatively associated with
   heterozygosity, phosphorus, and pH and positively associated with
   calcium, potassium, SO(4), NH(4), and electric conductivity. Total
   vegetation cover correlated positively with the variation in ovule
   production among individuals. Seed set and number of viable seeds per
   fruit, indicators of the success of fertilization and seed maturation,
   correlated positively with population size, the cover of co-flowering
   heath species, and the same group of nutrients that (independently) had
   a positive effect on ovule on ovule production. A high NO(2)
   concentration might be toxic because it had a negative effect on the
   number of viable seeds. Seed weight seemed to be independent of any
   population or habitat parameter. Besides lower mean values, we also
   found more variation in reproductive success among individuals in
   smaller populations. We conclude that plants in small populations of G.
   pneumonanthe have a similar reproductive potential per flower but have
   lower seed production and a higher uncertainty of successful
   reproduction than plants in large populations. Genetic variation was
   apparently not very important. In addition to population size, habitat
   characteristics also seemed to be important for seed production and seed
   set. The most important factors were the facilitating effect of the
   presence of other insect-pollinated species and the concentrations of
   specific nutrients in the soil. To restore small populations, we advise
   small-scale sod cutting around the remaining reproductive individuals.
   This simultaneously allows germination and seedling establishment of G.
   pneumonanthe, removes soil nutrients, and restores the cover of
   pollinator-attracting heath species at the cost of grasses.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{1, Results from four field studies show that communities of trap-nesting
   bees and wasps and their natural enemies are promising bioindicators for
   ecological change or habitat quality. These small and easy-to-handle
   communities can be analysed with respect to (i) species richness and
   related parameters, and (ii) ecological functions or interactions. The
   communities comprise Hymenoptera (Apidae, Sphecidae, Eumenidae,
   Pompilidae) and natural enemies belonging to many insect taxa. Traps
   consisted of 150-200, 15-20-cm long, reed internodes, put into tills or
   plastic tubes of 13-15 cm diameter; wooden posts with 2-10 of such
   reed-filled tins were exposed ill the target habitat.
   2, Species richness and abundance of bees (but trot wasps) were closely
   related to plant species richness of the habitat, a measure of the bees'
   food resource. However, availability of nest sites of above-ground
   nesting species was equally important: meadows with old trees supported
   greater populations than meadows without trees. A threefold increase in
   exposed traps resulted in a twofold increase in species.
   3. The sensitivity of this bioindicator system profits from the fact
   that evaluations rely not only on presence/absence data, descriptive
   population attributes or diversity indices, but also on interactions or
   ecological functions. Monitoring ecological responses or multitrophic
   interactions, and their relationship to species diversity, is rarely
   done but much needed. Ecological functions include (i) the percentage
   mortality of trap-nesting bees and wasps due to parasitoids and
   predators, which was correlated with the species richness of these
   natural enemies; (ii) seed set of allogamous plants due to successful
   pollination by trap-nesting bees; and (iii) biological control by the
   predacious wasps.
   4, With increasing isolation of fragmented habitats (when traps were
   exposed in a cleared agricultural landscape), both species richness of
   natural enemies and percentage mortality (parasitism and predation)
   declined significantly. In a comparison of habitat types (grasslands and
   field mal-gins), species richness of the trap-nest community correlated
   with plant diversity, but percentage mortality, due to parasitism and
   predation, with field age only. The threshold distance to the nearest
   habitat was 106-530 m for a 10 50\% decrease in mean mortality, and the
   mortality increased greatly in habitats that were older than 5 years.
   Accordingly, these studies emphasize the significance of a continuum of
   old habitat patches for the augmentation of nat ural enemies.
   5, Exposure of standardized traps is an experimental approach with a
   small, interacting and reproducing community that can be easily
   characterized by simple parameters. Taxonomy and biology are well known,
   and quick evaluations can be done using the close correlation between
   the number of occupied traps and species richness. Species richness of
   trap-nesting bees and wasps was closely correlated with that sampled by
   sweep nets. Further criteria of indicator taxa that apply to this system
   are discussed in the text.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bee pollinated Chamaecrista fasciculata provides pollen as the
   sole reward to its pollinators. Male sterility, expressed as an absence
   or nearly complete absence of pollen production, occurs in low frequency
   in populations of C. fasciculata. Here we describe experiments, using C.
   fasciculata, to examine frequently cited determinants of the spread and
   maintenance of male sterility: compensation and the genetic basis of
   male sterility. In addition, we examine the role the pollination system
   plays in determining the reproductive success of the male steriles.
   Seventeen populations in Maryland, Illinois, and Kansas were surveyed
   and found to range from 0 to 6\% male sterility per population. An
   artificial population of male-sterile simulants and hermaphrodites was
   created to examine how the local frequency of nonrewarding male steriles
   might affect male-sterile female reproductive success. Male steriles
   performed equally poorly, with respect to seed production, whether
   surrounded by other male-sterile simulants or hermaphrodites.
   Compensation was examined by comparison of male steriles and
   hermaphrodites with respect to several reproductive and nonreproductive
   characters. Male steriles outperformed hermaphrodites in terms of
   nonreproductive biomass, but performed equally in terms of ovule number
   and produced many fewer flowers. The genetic basis of male sterility was
   examined by performing both intra- and interpopulational crosses of male
   steriles to hermaphrodites and indicate that male sterility is not
   purely cytoplasmic. The low frequency of male sterility in C.
   fasciculata populations may reflect reduced female reproductive success
   because of pollinator avoidance, lack of reproductive compensation, and
   a mode of inheritance that is not purely cytoplasmic.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological studies of hummingbird communities have emphasized die
   importance of local conditions and contemporary interactions in the
   development of these varied faunas. A time-calibrated, DNA
   hybridization-based phylogeny of the principal hummingbird lineages was
   used to examine historical aspects of hummingbird faunas in the
   species-rich tropical lowlands and Andes, and the relatively depauperate
   West Indies and temperate regions of Central and North America.
   Parsimony reconstructions of ancestral distributions indicate that these
   faunas are polyphyletic in origin, comprising several to many
   independent lineages. Based on the timing of geologic and cladogenic
   events, hummingbird faunas appear to have arisen more often by
   colonization than by large-scale vicariance, with multiple dispersals
   across water gaps, elevational gradients, and latitude. The extent to
   which particular lineages colonized different regions depended, however,
   on lineage ecology as well as on the habitat and age of the fauna. In
   general, the oldest extant trochilofauna, which today occupies the
   tropical lowlands, was the principal source of colonizing taxa. However,
   all regions except possibly the West Indies contributed taxa now found
   elsewhere, including in the tropical lowlands. The Andean fauna
   comprises several lineages with lowland origin (hermits, Mangoes,
   Brilliants, Coquettes? Emeralds) as well as at least one that arose in
   temperate regions outside South America (Bees). At least two lineages
   that colonized the West Indies gave rise to endemic genera (Mangoes to
   Eulampis, and Emeralds to Orthorhyncus). Even groups that diversified in
   the highlands (Brilliants and Bees) Save rise to taxa that subsequently
   reinvaded the tropical lowlands. As the result of these varied
   histories, hummingbird communities cannot be arranged easily with
   respect to organizational complexity and coevolution with nectar
   sources. Although the physically insular faunas in the Andes and West
   Indies differ markedly in diversity, both were more strongly affected by
   colonization than the other faunas. A high potential for coevolution
   between hummingbirds and plants probably facilitated the successful
   establishment and radiation of the several Andean-associated lineages.
   However, coexistence between the two most diverse Andean clades may have
   been favoured initially through different habitat preferences by their
   extra-Andean ancestors. In the tropical lowlands, by comparison, the
   basic separation between the forest-dwelling hermits and canopy and
   edge-dwelling nonhermits appears to have evolved in situ. The low
   species and morphologic diversity of hummingbirds breeding north of
   Mexico reflects the predominance there of a single relatively recent
   lineage. The regional coexistence of numerous unrelated lineages implies
   that patterns of ancestry, colonization, and extinction contribute to
   the make-up of contemporary species-rich hummingbird faunas and serves
   to qualify the view that hummingbird communities are coadapted
   assemblages that resist change. (C) 1998 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Hummingbirds foraging for nectar in mountains of the western USA
   encounter spatially-variable rewards under energetically-demanding
   environmental conditions. Previous workers have found that hummingbirds
   respond quickly to the average quantity and quality of reward; in
   addition, one might expect a response to reward variance. To explore
   this possibility we observed free-flying hummingbirds visiting two
   arrays of the native plant Ipomopsis aggregata. All flowers in one array
   received a 1 mu l aliquot of artificial nectar whereas every fifth
   flower in the other array received 5 mu l. This yielded a mean nectar
   standing crop similar to that found in nature, and variances in standing
   crop that were only slightly more extreme than those in nature. Over 12
   days we recorded 362 foraging bouts by male and female Broad-tailed
   Selasphorus platycercus and Rufous S, rufus Hummingbirds. The
   ``high-variance{''} (HV) array received 8.9\% fewer foraging bouts than
   the ``low-variance{''} (LV) array, and this difference was significant
   statistically at the alpha = 5.4\% level. Bout frequency varied among
   periods of the day, but not differentially by nectar treatment. Foraging
   bouts tended to be longer in the LV array, though not significantly so,
   and hummingbirds visiting both arrays in sequence were significantly
   more likely to visit the LV array first. These results suggest weak
   risk-aversion under natural conditions. Lack of a stronger response may
   derive from the fact that hummingbirds sample thousands of flowers a
   day, so that the total profit realized over a day is not strongly
   influenced by flower-to-flower variation.}},

   Floral diversity includes numerous representatives of Magnoliidae,
   Hamamelididae, Rosidae, Dilleniidae, and Asteridae (Ericales sensu
   late). Included are hypogynous, five-merous flowers with uniseriate
   hairs on the pedicels and stamens in bundles most frequently borne
   opposite the petals. There is considerable variation in filament length,
   and some filaments are branched. On some anthers, strands of residue,
   suggesting the former presence of a liquid of unknown nature, partially
   occlude the apparent zone of dehiscence. In other casts, open anthers
   are fully occluded by an amorphous substance. Pollen is rarely found
   associated with anthers, but is common on stigmatic surfaces. Pollen is
   prolate and tricolporate with reticulate micromorphology. The superior
   syncarpous ovary is five-carpellate with axile/intruded parietal
   placentation and numerous anatropous ovules/carpel. Ovary partitions
   have closely spaced, parallel ascending channels (secretory canals?),
   and there are apparent secretory canals/cavities in receptacles, sepals,
   and petals. Individual stigmas are cuneiform with a central groove and
   eccentrically peltate. Styles are short and fused. In aggregate, the
   stigmas form a secondarily peltate stigma. Seeds have a reticulate
   sculpture pattern, a pronounced raphe, and funicular arils with
   sculpture similar to the seeds. Phylogenetic analyses of several data
   matrices of extant taxa place this fossil in a monophyletic group with
   the modern genera Garcinia and Clusia within the Clusiaceae. As such,
   these fossils represent the earliest fossil evidence of the family
   Clusiaceae. Some modern Clusiaceae are notable, in particular for their
   close relationship with meliponine and other highly derived bee
   pollinators; the fossil flowers share several characters that suggest a
   similar mode of pollination. This possibility is consistent with other
   floral and insect data from the same locality.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of the orchid Ceratandra grandiflora was
   investigated in order to determine whether the partial loss of a
   specialized floral reward (i.e., oil) was the result of an incomplete
   shift from one specialized pollinator to another. In the three-species
   clade of section Ceratandra, there has been a progressive loss of the
   oil-secreting callus. It is always present in C, atrata, sometimes
   present in C. grandiflora, and never present in C. globosa. Thirty-nine
   to 67\% of individuals in populations of C. grandiflora bear the callus
   gland, but gland presence has no significant effect on the proportion of
   Hewers pollinated. Pollinator observations show that the shift in
   pollinators is complete and that the oil-secreting callus is a vestige
   of the ancestral oil-bee pollination system that no longer plays a role
   in pollination. C. grandiflora is pollinated almost exclusively by a
   single species of hopliine beetle (Scarabaeidae). Experiments with
   artificial flower traps indicate that color alone can explain the
   attraction of beetles to C. grandiflora, despite the absence of a floral
   reward. The proportion of C. grandiflora flowers pollinated (50.2 and
   61.1\%; N = 524 and 324 flowers, respectively) is unusually high for a
   plant that relies an generalized food deception and is probably due to

Abstract = {{Pollen volume varies among angiosperm species over five orders of

   correspondingly in pollen size, as would be expected if pollen size
   affected pollen transport. Analysis of nine Pedicularis species detected
   significant interspecific variation in pollen size; however, the overall
   mean pollen volume of species pollinated primarily by nectar-collecting
   bees did not differ significantly from that of species pollinated by
   pollen-collecting bees. Similarly, comparison of bee- and

Abstract = {{Flower morphology, nectar features (chemical composition, production

   analysed in an Argentine population of Mandevilla pentlandiana. Nectar
   variability was examined during the lifetime of a single flower, over

   Nectar is sucrose dominant. There were some variations in the
   proportions of sugar throughout both the flower lifespan and the
   flowering season. Flowers produced most nectar during bud-stage. Nectar
   secretion ceased near the end of the first day after flower opening.
   Nectar quantity varied as a function af flower age due to a combination
   of nectar secretion, cessation, and resorption periods. Overall sugar
   production was increased by nectar removal. Standing crop data showed
   that each open flower and inflorescence offers c. 2 and 11 mg of sugar
   respectively at any time of the flowering season. There was higher
   nectar availability at the beginning of the flowering season compared
   with the rest of the period. Flowers were visited by bumblebees,
   honeybees and hummingbirds. The greater the number of open flowers and
   the nectar variance, the more the mean reward quantity per flower
   available in the inflorescence. The sources of nectar variability in M.
   pentlandiana seem to be linked with both the female function (nectar
   resorption, nectar cessation) and the male one (early and comparatively
   large nectar availability, variation in nectar production as the flower
   ages; nectar secretion stimulation by nectar removals). (C) 1998 The

Abstract = {{In many plant species with unisexual flowers, the female flowers lack
   pollinator rewards and are pollinated by visitors who mistake the female
   flowers for rewarding male flowers. Here we present the results of
   observations and experiments designed to investigate pollinator
   discrimination and its consequences for female reproductive success in
   two monoecious Begonia species pollinated by deceit. Male and female
   flowers of B. urophylla are similar in shape, but female flowers are
   smaller than male flowers, while in B. tonduzii, male and female flowers
   have strikingly different shapes, but their petaloid tepals are similar
   in total area. Flower visitors displayed marked discrimination against
   the rewardless female flowers of both species, Seven bee species were
   observed on B. urophylla, and for all species taken together the
   relative visitation rate to male flowers was 8.6 times that to female
   flowers. The bee Trigona fulviventris accounted for 95\% of all visits
   to B. tonduzii and visited male flowers 15.4 times as often as female
   flowers. The flower visitors of B, urophylla varied significantly in
   their degree of discrimination against female flowers, with visitation
   rates to male flowers 3.7-21.8 times those to female flowers. The two
   most abundant flower visitors displayed the greatest discrimination
   against female flowers and, although they comprised nearly 54\% of all
   visits, were responsible for only 15\% of all visits to female flowers.
   Thus, the relative abundance of different flower visitors on B.
   urophylla is a poor predictor of pollinator importance.
   In both species the inflorescence sex ratio was male-biased early in the
   season and female-biased later. Hand-pollination experiments revealed
   that fruit set in B. tonduzii was pollinator limited both during peak
   and late flowering, with supplemental pollination having its greatest
   effect late in the season when male flowers were rare. In contrast,
   fruit set was only weakly affected by supplemental hand-pollination in
   B. urophylla. The significant pollinator limitation observed in B.
   tonduzii and the lack of it in B, urophylla are consistent with our
   observation that the visitation rate to female flowers was much higher
   in B. urophylla than in B. tonduzii, which was due in part to the lower
   level of pollinator discrimination against female flowers of B.
   urophylla. Our finding that female reproductive success is limited by
   pollinator visitation in B. tonduzii indicates an opportunity for the
   evolution of increased resemblance between male and female flowers in
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{In the present, final part of a series of contributions on nectaries,
   further, miscellaneous case histories are presented because of their
   histological or ecological interest. In the special section, extrafloral
   and floral nectaries of members of six families are treated. A general
   survey concludes the paper.
   Extranuptial glands attracting ant guards are associated with the
   flowers of Becium and Ocimum (Lamiaceae); they represent novel cases in
   a family hitherto believed to lack this kind of organs. The glands
   develop in an unusual way by transformation of abscission scars of
   floral bracts. The five floral but extranuptial glands on the calyx of
   Siphocampylus betulifolius (Lobeliaceae), with a similar function, are
   unusual in sharing the same histological structure and drainage via
   stomatal sap-holes with the closely adjoining nuptial nectary, a disk.
   Three case histories refer to zoophilous unisexual flowers with only one
   of the functional sexual morphs rewarding with nectar. In Pachysandra
   and Sarcococca (monoecious Buxaceae) the male flowers are nectariferous.
   The nectarless pistillate flowers are inadvertently pollinated by bees
   while these exploit the staminate flowers. Two other instances, although
   heterogeneous in detail, exhibit the reverse situation in that only the
   pistillate flowers yield nectar: the male capitula of the dioecious
   composite Hererothalamus alienus are girdled by female-sterile ray
   florets with copious nectar; bees taking it become dusted with pollen
   when they move over the dry staminate disk florets. They may
   subsequently pollinate the female heads, which entirely consist of
   nectariferous pistillate ray florets. In the hummingbird-pollinated
   Begonia ferruginea it is also the pistillate flowers that contain a
   presumably nectareous fluid, while the dry staminate ones fallaciously
   attract the visitors by mimicking the pistillate flowers.
   Although basically epigynous, the protandrous revolver flowers of the
   little-known genus Pentaphragma (Pentaphragmataceae) have maintained the
   subbasal position of their five separate nectaries on the ovary wall,
   the nectar being accessible to bees via five receptacular channels.
   In the concluding chapter, possible evolutionary pathways leading to
   floral nectaries, particularly floral disks, are discussed. Hydathodes
   of vegetative provenance rather than extrafloral nectaries are likely
   precursors of most floral nectaries. Developmental modules comprising a
   single stomatal sap-hole or groups of them, associated with peristomatal
   gland cells, may have aggregated in flowers to form disks. Separate
   nectariferous scales as found in flowers of the Cucurbitaceae,
   Crassulaceae and the Geraniales also reveal similarities with the
   respective leaf hydathodes. The organophylesis of the single scale
   seated in the axial spur of Pelargonium is detailed as an example. A
   clustered distribution of stomatal sap-holes on disks can be partly
   interpreted as revealing their origin from meristic hydathodal modules.
   Examples of the diversity of these patterns are given, which are little
   explored and may provide useful taxonomic characters.}},

   studied for two seasons. Only two species of bumblebees, Bombus alpinus
   and B. hyperboreus, are common at the site. Bombus hyperboreus is an
   obligate nest parasite on B. alpinus; the latter species is four times
   more abundant than the former. The number of captures on any given day
   was very low. However, the number of queens foraging in the area was
   estimated by a mark-reacapture method to ca 350 specimens, indicating
   that the queens forage over large areas. The dates for capturing queens
   carrying pollen in their corbiculae and the emergence of workers and
   males indicate that the queens only have time to produce one batch (or
   possibly two overlapping batches) of workers. The utilization of
   different plant species corresponds well with their flowering phenology
   at the site. The unspecialized flowers of Saxifraga oppositifolia are
   the main pollen and nectar source in the early part of the season. The
   bumblebees switch to Astragalus alpinus and Bartsia alpina as soon as
   they come into flower; these species show a typical bee pollination
   syndrome. The corbicular loads most commonly consisted of 91-100\% of
   pollen from a single species. The change in flower utilization and the
   composition of the corbicular loads give no support for the hypothesis
   that arctic bumblebees should be more generalistic in their foraging
   than temperate species. The preference for Astragalus and Bartsia will
   probably have an effect on outcrossing in late-flowering specimens of
   Saxifraga oppositifolia, which has a very extended flowering period.}},

Abstract = {{1 The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp
   tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three
   sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons.
   The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was
   reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately
   disturbed to disturbed sites.
   2 Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially
   self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of
   inbred fruit. Although more than 90\% of flowers from trees at all sites
   were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of
   these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production
   were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed,
   were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more
   fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered
   production of mature fruit.
   3 Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited
   significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance
   between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between
   sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by
   changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities.
   Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with
   distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites.
   4 At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded
   with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed
   site was significantly lower than expected.
   5 Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is
   dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is
   a function of tree isolation. This species may thus be subject to the
   Allee effect, where population viability is reduced disproportionately
   with a decline in population size or, as in this study, population
   density. The implications of these results for population recovery and
   genetic structure following disturbance are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Floral traits that increase attractiveness to pollinators are predicted
   to evolve through selection on male function rather than on female
   function. To determine the importance of male-biased selection in
   dioecious Wurmbea dioica, we examined sexual dimorphism in flower size
   and number and the effects of these traits on pollinator visitation and
   reproductive success of male and female plants. Males produced more and
   larger flowers than did females. Bees and butterflies responded to this
   dimorphism and visited males more frequently than females, although
   flies did not differentiate between the sexes. Within sexes, insect
   pollinators made more visits to and visited more flowers on plants with
   many flowers. However, visits per flower did not vary with flower
   number, indicating that visitation was proportional to the number of
   flowers per plant. When flower number was experimentally held constant,
   visitation increased with flower size under sunny but not overcast
   conditions. Flower size but not number affected pollen removal per
   flower in males and deposition in females. In males, pollen removal
   increased with flower size 3 days after flowers opened, but not after 6
   days when 98\% of pollen was removed. Males with larger flowers
   therefore, may have higher fitness not because pollen removal is more
   complete, but because pollen is removed more rapidly providing
   opportunities to preempt ovules. In females, pollen deposition increased
   with flower size 3 days but not 6 days after flowers opened. At both
   times, deposition exceeded ovule production by four-fold or more, and
   for 2 years seed production was not limited by pollen. Flower size had
   no effect on seed production per plant and was negatively related to
   percent seed set, implying a tradeoff between allocation to attraction
   and reproductive success. This indicates that larger flower size in
   females is unlikely to increase fitness. In both sexes, gamete
   production was positively correlated with flower size. In males, greater
   pollen production would increase the advantage of large flowers, but in
   females more ovules may represent a resource cost. Selection to increase
   flower size and number in W. dioica has probably occurred through male
   rather than female function.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of flower constancy have been the focus of
   many studies, but almost all have examined the foraging behavior of
   bumblebees, honeybees, or butterflies. We test whether constancy occurs
   in an overlooked group of pollinators, the syrphid flies. Foraging
   sequences of wild flies of two species, Episyrphus balteatus and Syrphus
   ribesii, were examined when visiting flowers in seminatural plant
   communities and in artificial arrays of two color morphs of Lobularia
   maritima planted at a range of frequencies. Both species exhibited
   marked floral constancy when foraging in the mixed-plant community.
   Because all groups of pollinating insect so far examined exhibit
   constancy at least under some circumstances, we suggest that this is the
   predominant strategy used by pollinators and that there is probably a
   common explanation. Neither syrphid species exhibited constancy to
   different color morphs within a plant species, in contrast to previously
   published studies of Hymenoptera foraging among polymorphic flowers,
   which all describe positive frequency-dependent selection. Possible
   explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. We argue that constancy
   in these syrphids is unlikely to result from learning constraints on
   handling ability, currently the most widely accepted explanation for
   flower constancy, because they forage primarily for pollen which is
   easily located in most flowers they visit.}},

   schottii is a night-blooming, self-incompatible columnar cactus.
   Beginning at sunset, its flowers are visited by U. virescens females,
   which collect pollen on specialized abdominal scales, actively deposit
   pollen on flower stigmas, and oviposit a single egg on a flower petal.
   Larvae spend 6 days eating ovules before exiting the fruit and pupating
   in a cactus branch. Hand-pollination and pollinator exclusion
   experiments at our study site near Bahia Kino, Sonora, Mexico, revealed
   that fruit set in L. schottii is likely to be resource limited. About
   50\% of hand-outcrossed hand-outcrossed and open-pollinated senita
   flowers abort by day 6 after flower opening. Results of exclusion
   experiments indicated that senita moths accounted for 75\% of
   open-pollinated fruit set in 1995 with two species of halictid bees

   scnita system with the yucca/yucca moth mutualism reveals many
   similarities, including reduced nectar production, active pollination,
   and limited seed destruction. The independent evolution of many of the
   same features in the two systems suggests that a common pathway exists
   for the evolution of these highly specialized pollination mutualisms.
   Nocturnal flower opening, self-incompatible breeding systems, and
   resource-limited fruit production appear to be important during this

Abstract = {{Dipsacus fullonum (Dipsacus sylvestris) is a native biennial, common in
   the UK agricultural landscape, providing floral resources for potential

   north America, the plant has become established as an invasive alien,
   threatening to displace native species of sensitive conservation status.
   Surveys of farmland in Cambridgeshire, UK, over a three year period
   indicated that the plant's distribution along field boundaries rendered
   it prone to damage by routine boundary management practices. In
   experiments, some stems cut before flowering regrew but produced
   significantly fewer flowerheads than uncut plants; stems cut during or
   after flowering produced no new flowerheads. Seeds borne in flowerheads
   of plants cut during or immediately after flowering failed to germinate.
   Although the local persistence of D. fullonum did not appear to be
   threatened by routine management in this study, resulting loss of floral
   resources has implications for the plant's insect fauna. Flexibility in
   the timing of boundary management could alleviate potential negative
   effects on beneficial insects in UK agroecosystems. Knowledge of the

Abstract = {{Crop-weed hybridization can potentially influence the evolutionary
   ecology of wild populations. Many crops are known to hybridize with wild
   relatives, but few studies have looked at the long-term persistence of
   crop genes in the wild. This study investigated one factor in the
   hybridization process in radish: differential pollinator visitation to
   wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) vs. crop-wild F-1 hybrids (R.
   sativus X R. raphanistrum). Wild genotypes had yellow flowers, a
   recessive single-locus trail, whereas hybrids always had white or pale
   pink flowers. In experimental arrays in northern Michigan, total
   pollinator visitation was significantly biased toward wild plants when
   the frequencies of wild and hybrid plants were equal. Syrphid flies, the
   most frequent visitors, preferred wild plants while bumble bees showed
   no preference. This pattern was also observed when hybrid plants were
   overrepresented in the array (12 hybrid:2 wild). In contrast, when
   hybrid plants were rare (2 hybrid:12 wild), neither morph was preferred
   by any pollinator group. Later in the summer, pollinators were also
   observed in a large experimental garden with nearly equal frequencies of
   wild and hybrid plants. Cabbage butterflies (Pieris rapae) strongly
   overvisited wild plants, while bumble bees showed a slight preference
   for hybrids. Taken together, these studies suggest that F-1 hybrids may
   not be at a disadvantage with regard to pollinator visits when they
   occur at low frequencies or when bumble bees are frequent flower
   visitors. Thus, variation in the proportion of white-flowered morphs
   among wild radish populations could be influenced by different histories
   of crop-to-wild hybridization, as well as by variation in the
   composition of local pollinator taxa.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the patterns of adaptive radiation in Disa, a large orchid
   genus in southern Africa. A cladogram for 27 species was constructed
   using 44 morphological characters, Pollination systems were then mapped
   onto the phylogeny in order to analyze pathways of floral evolution.
   Shifts from one pollination system to another have been a major feature
   of the evolutionary diversification of Disa. Unlike many plant genera
   that are pollinated mainly by a single group of insects, radiation in
   Disa has encompassed nearly all major groups of pollinating insects; in
   all, 19 different specialized pollination systems have been found in the
   27 species included in this analysis. Another striking pattern is the
   repeated evolution of broadly similar pollination systems in unrelated
   clades. For example, butterfly-pollinated flowers have evolved twice;
   showy deceptive flowers pollinated by carpenter bees, twice:
   long-spurred flowers pollinated by long-tongued flies, four times;
   night-scented Rowers pollinated by moths, three times; and
   self-pollination. three times. This suggests that a few dominant
   pollinator species in a region may be sufficient to generate
   diversification in plants through repeated floral shifts that never
   retrace the same pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Conservationists are becoming increasingly aware of the value of insects
   and the need to include them in programs to preserve diversity.;Most
   current endeavors emphasize individual species or specific taxa with
   little emphasis on preserving species interactions or processes. Insects
   exhibit spectacular and diverse behaviors and ecological interactions
   that should be preserved in their own right, and more importantly, they
   provide essential processes for the long-term survival of populations
   and species assemblages in preserved landscapes. As habitats are
   increasingly Fragmented and disturbed, vital insect-driven interactions
   may be disrupted greatly diminishing the survival of the community.
   Research is needed to evaluate the effect of habitat change on insect
   interactions, in addition to the presence or absence of insects. The
   presence of a species does not indicate anything about its behavior;
   insect behavior is the key to participation in interactions, the lock
   binding communities together. Mutualisms such as pollination,systems;
   and parasitisms such as bird-ectoparasite or parasitoid-herbivore
   systems, have been shown to be affected by fragmentation of habitats.
   Conservation management directed at ensuring the survival of functional
   flagship species interactions will preserve other codependent and
   coexisting species and interactions. Entomologists are the most
   competent at recognizing, understanding, and manipulating insect
   interactions and should apply this knowledge and these skills to the
   needs of conservation. Lessons from applied entomology, including
   integrated pest management, clearly show the importance of preserving
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The length of time that pollen remains viable after being removed from
   the anther may be subject to species-specific selection pressures, e.g.,
   when the average transit time between anther and stigma is long,
   long-lived pollen may be favoured. Flowering plants that provide no
   reward to pollinators are predicted to have relatively long-lived
   pollen, because pollinators are less likely to immediately revisit
   flowers of a nonrewarding species. I studied the effect of pollen age on
   fertilization success in three species of orchids that provide little or
   no reward. Pollen was aged 0, 1, 2, 4, or 8 days outside of the anther
   and then placed on the stigmas of conspecific flowers. I collected and
   weighed all resultant fruits and used a subsampling technique to
   determine the number of embryonated seeds per fruit and the percentage
   of all seeds that had embryos. There was no evidence that pollen age
   affected fruit set, fruit weight, embryonated-seed number, or percentage
   of embryonated seeds in two species (Calopogon tuberosus (Linn.) Britton
   and Pogonia ophioglossoides (Linn.) Ker.). In the third, Cypripedium
   reginae Walt., 8-day-old pollen produced significantly lighter fruits
   with fewer embryonated seeds; however, the percentage of embryonated
   seeds was not affected. Although the pollen of these nonrewarding
   orchids appears to have an impressive life-span, it is difficult to make
   comparisons with other species because most previous studies have relied
   on laboratory tests of viability that appear to have little relation to
   performance of pollen in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) is pollinated by several apoid species which
   trip the flowers and cause either self or cross fertilization. Great
   variations in hybridization rate occur under field conditions. A better
   understanding of gene dispersal among faba bean is required to improve
   breeding programs. Our objective was to determine the contribution of
   foreign pollen to the fertilization of recipient flowers according to
   their position in the visitation sequence. Single workers of Bombus
   terrestris L. were used with caged faba bean. They foraged 10 flowers of
   a donor line (D-27) prior to those of a recipient line (D-23). Seventeen
   bumblebee workers visited 1261 flowers of D-23. The mean number of D-23
   flowers visited per individual run was 74. The 17 runs induced 2812
   seeds which were harvested and analyzed by starch-gel electrophoresis to
   estimate the cross-fertilization rates by allozyme markers. These rates
   were 21.3 and 17.5\% for the first five and 10 flowers visited,
   respectively. The percentage of pods containing one? two, or three
   hybrid seeds was 78.0, 13.5, and 8.5\%, respectively. These proportions
   were affected neither by the floral node level nor by the ovule position
   in ovary. After the first visits to the recipient flowers, the insect
   foraging rapidly loses its efficacy in terms of cross fertilization.
   Therefore, hybridization between lines requires a high frequency of
   alternate foraging which can be influenced by the breeding procedures,
   in particular by the spatial arrangement of parental lines.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) are hermaphrodite and
   self-incompatible; their cross-pollination depends entirely on insect
   visitors, mainly bees (Apoidea). Because self-pollination of white
   clover occurs before flower anthesis, we determined whether selfing
   affected the pollination efficiency of a honeybee visit. We compared
   pollen deposition in emasculated and intact flowers following (1) a
   single honeybee visit, (2) open-pollination for a day and (3) enclosure
   in a cloth bag to prevent insect visits. In emasculated flowers,
   open-pollination resulted in more pollen deposited than after one visit
   (+ 30\%) which is consistent with flowers being visited more than once
   by pollinators during the course of a day. On intact flowers, saturation
   of the stigma was achieved after the first visit of a honeybee (near 280
   grains) because of self-pollination. Additional visits did not increase
   pollen deposits, but they improved pollen efficiency in terms of numbers
   of pollen tubes reaching the ovules. In such a context of easily
   saturated stigmas, self-pollen does not inhibit cross-pollen activity,
   but represents a constraint for pollination which demands multiple bee
   visits to each flower to achieve maximum fertilization.}},

   Given the tightly controlled experimental conditions and use of inbred

   Predicted from the above two functions, the visitation rate per head was
   independent of floral display and nearly constant within each day. Our

Abstract = {{We examined diurnal and nocturnal nectar secretion across sexual stages
   in protandrous Alstroemeria aurea, a bumble bee-pollinated herb with
   long-lived flowers native to the southern Andes. We found the following
   patterns: (1) most nectar was produced diurnally and (2) three times
   more sugar was secreted during the male than female phase, not only
   because the male phase lasted longer but also because the rate of nectar
   production was higher. This 3:1 ratio in nectar production matched the
   ratio of the minimum number of bumble bee visits required on average to
   saturate male (pollen removal) vs. female (seed set) functions. Standing
   crop of nectar, on the other hand, did not differ greatly between
   male-and female-stage flowers left open to visitors, because the
   high-production male-phase flowers were visited more frequently than
   female-phase flowers. In an experiment concurrent with the repeated
   nectar sampling of individual flowers over their life-span, we removed
   pollen from anthers or deposited pollen on stigmas by hand. Neither
   treatment, designed to mimic effects of visits by Alstroemeria's native
   bumble bee pollinator, affected nectar production. The absence of

   breeding systems and pollination vectors, and occur in small populations
   in remnant patches of semi-natural habitats throughout the landscape.
   There was no or only a weak correlation between population size and
   genetic diversity. The wind-pollinated, outcrossing species F. ovina had
   the highest levels of genetic variation, intermediate levels were found
   in the largely outcrossing and insect pollinated L. viscaria, while
   lowest levels of variation were found in the inbreeding A. thaliana.
   Relative to their breeding systems and the small geographical scale of
   the study all species exhibited remarkably high levels of total genetic
   variation. In the outbreeding species most of the genetic variation was
   found within populations (F. ovina: F-ST=0.059 and L. viscaria:
   F-ST=0.092). No geographic pattern was found between populations in the
   outbreeding species, indicating high levels of gene flow. The cereal
   fields separating the populations may function as conduits rather than
   barriers to pollen dispersed by wind, and pollinating insects
   (bumblebees and butterflies) may have no problems moving between patches
   at this scale, thus alleviating the danger of genetic erosion associated
   with small population size. In contrast, the fields appear to be
   efficient barriers to gene flow by seed dispersal. In the inbreeding
   Arabis thaliana a geographic pattern was evident. Most of the variation
   in this species was found between populations (F-ST = 0.722) indicating
   low levels of gene flow; single populations exhibited large variation in
   the number of genotypes present (1 to 15).}},

Abstract = {{The pollination biology of Pedicularis L. was studied in the Zhongdian
   and Deqin counties of Northwest Yunnan in the summer of 1993. From late
   July to late August, 18 species of Pedicularis were found in full bloom,
   while P. integrifolia was almost out of bloom. A preliminary study of
   pollination biology of six species was conducted. The paper reports the
   results of four better-studied species, among which P. tsekouensis
   Bonati and P. roylei Maxim. are of short-tubed, erostrate and nectarless
   corolla type and P. longiflora var, tubiformis (Klotz.) Tsoong and P.
   siphonantha var. delavayi (Franch.) Tsoong are long-tubed, rostrate and
   nectarless. The short-tubed P. tsekouensis and P. roylei were found
   exclusively by Bombus friseanus workers standing on the lower lips of
   the corolla and vibrating pollen from anthers concealed within the
   galea. The pollen deposited on the dorsal side of the head-thorax of the
   workers was transferred to the stigma of another plant by the insects
   nototribically. The long-tubed species were pollinated by Bomus
   rufofasciatus workers hanging inverted from the corolla and buzzing
   pollen, the stigma contacted pollen on the ventral side of the
   pollinator's thorax. This falls into the sternotribical pollination
   type. The blooming phenology of later-summer Pedicularis seems
   corresponding to the emergence of short-tongued bumblebee workers rather
   than longer tongue queens. Preliminary observations were made to check
   whether Leptopteran insects were the pollinators of the very long-tubed
   species but no such phenomenon was found. The long-tubes of the yellow
   flowered P. longiflora var. tubiformis and those of the magentha
   flowered P. siphonantha var. delavayi may be just an adaptation in
   extending the rostrate vibration pollination mechanism beyond the
   relatively short plants. This seems a result of coevolution of these
   alpine plants and their pollinating bumblebees.}},

   purpureus Pennell. P. digitalis Nutt. ex Sims, P. grandiflorus Nutt., P.
   pallidus Small, and P. tubaeflorus Nutt. was studied by sampling
   populations at nine prairie sites in Illinois. Kansas, and Missouri.
   rill five species show protandry, but the receptive stigma lies only 2
   mm away from the two pairs of fertile stamens. Bagging experiments on
   three Penstemon spp. show that only P. digitalis sets seed when insect
   visitors are excluded. Flowers of all five species exhibit a horizontal
   presentation of the corolla and emit a slightly discernible scent.
   However, the presumed pollination systems of Penstemon spp, correlate
   with corolla form and the size of the floral sinus. The tubular, white
   flowers of P. tubaeflorus appear to be pollinated by a combination of
   diurnal Lepidoptera and some native bees favoring a dorsal deposition of
   pollen on mouthparts and upper thoraces. The four remaining species have
   gullet- or bell-shaped corollas ornamented with violet-purple blotches
   or lines. These species appear to be pollinated primarily by
   polylectic/polyphagic bees (including sis Rombus spp.). with P.
   digitalis and P. cobaea visited infrequently by the rare Penstemon wasp,
   Pseudomasaris occidentalis. Queens of Bombus pennsylvanicus subsp.
   pennsylvanicus forage primarily on the large, gullet flowers of P.
   grandiflorus and both varieties of P. cobaea. Queens of Bombus
   nevadensis subsp. auricomus prefer those P. digitalis and P. pallidus
   shoring a reduced gullet or bell form. Ree pollination in four Penstemon
   spp. may operate within a two-tiered system. Large-bodied Bombus spp.,
   Megachile brevis, and anthophorids (Synhalonia hamata and Anthophora
   terminalis) carry dorsal depositions of Penstemon pollen because they
   contact anthers and stigmas while they forage exclusively for nectar. In
   contrast, small-bodied members of the Anthophoridae (Ceratina),
   Colletidae (Hylaeus spp.), Halictidae (Augochlorella, Halictus,
   Lasioglossum), and Megachilidae (Hoplitis and Osmia) forage actively for
   Penstemon pollen encouraging repeated, ventral contact with the sexual
   organs of the flowers. Bombus queens were more prevalent at large
   Penstemon populations (especially P. cobaea). Bombus workers were
   collected primarily on restored sites. The importance of small bees as
   pollinators appeared to vary indirectly with Penstemon population size.}},

   positively, and the ovary diameter was negatively, correlated with the
   decrease in night temperatures. The functioning of the flower female
   organs was also affected by low (14 degrees C or less) night
   temperatures, and the number of viable pollen grains per flower was
   markedly reduced and their germinability was impaired. Fruits which set
   under low night temperatures were deformed (and generally seedless),
   whereas under higher night temperatures most of the fruits were of the
   normal, blocky type. The male and female flower organs of cv. 899 were
   less sensitive to low temperatures than those of cv. Mazurka, so that
   all the fruits of cv. Mazurka which had set under low night temperatures
   were small and seedless (flattened) or pointed, while more fruits of cv.
   899 were larger, seeded and of better shape. Nevertheless, a single
   pollination of flowers grown under a night temperature of 12 degrees C
   with pollen originated from a night temperature of 18 degrees C brought
   about a markedly greater percentage of normal fruits in both cultivars.
   Double pollination of the same flowers further increased fruit size and
   improved the shape; three successive pollinations had greater effect.
   The flowers of cv. 899 showed a greater response than those of cv.
   Mazurka to the repeated pollinations, in increased seed production,
   increased fruit size and improved fruit shape. These results indicate
   that pollen viability is important in determining the size and shape of
   fruits developed under low temperatures, and that repeated pollinations,
   which mimic bees' activities in a greenhouse, can considerably increase
   yields and improve fruit shape, thereby improving the farmer's income.}},

   Hovedoya in Oslo, and a large population located centrally within the
   main area of this species in Norway, on Sandoya in Tjome, Vestfold. One
   objective was to assess, if possible, the chance of survival of the
   outpost population. Pulsatilla pratensis is not completely self
   incompatible, since artificial selfing produced a small amount of seed.
   However, spontaneous selfing does not occur. Pollination is accomplished
   by insects, almost exclusively bumble bees (Bombus spp.). Nectar
   thievery resulted when the bumble bee inserted its proboscis from
   outside the flower in between the tepals (base working). A comparison
   between the two populations indicates that pollinator scarcity at the
   time of flowering possibly might constitute a limiting factor for
   recruitment in the outpost population.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of Gentianella uliginosa, a rare annual in The
   Netherlands, was studied in three relatively small coastal dune
   populations. In all populations, the species was fully self-compatible:
   manual self pollination resulted in a seed set of 92-94\%. Autofertility
   was also high (seed set of caged, unhandled flowers 80-85\%). The
   homogamous flowers were visited by Bombus pascuorum, which collected
   nectar and transported pollen sternotribically. Differences among
   populations in bumblebee visitation rate did not affect natural seed
   set. In one plot, seed set following natural pollination was lower than
   after manual selfing, and as high as after spontaneous selfing. As
   flowers here were also visited frequently, this might be due to pollen
   limitation through heterospecific pollen competition. Support for this
   hypothesis was derived from another population, where seed set after
   natural pollination was lower in a plot dominated by co-flowering Mentha
   aquatica than in a plot with few Mentha. However, differences in water
   availability might also have caused this. In one population, seed sets
   of the cross pollination and spontaneous selfing treatments were lower
   than those of the manual selfing and natural pollination treatments.
   Whether the low outcrossing success can be attributed to small
   differences in the treatment of the experimental plants or to
   outcrossing depression remains unclear. We conclude that this annual
   species is most likely a predominant selfer. Its high autofertility is
   probably an adaptation to its wet dune slack habitat, where reproductive
   assurance may be important to cope with unpredictable fluctuations in
   water table, summer droughts and pollinator service.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator behavior influences plant reproduction in many ways. A
   traditional measure of pollination, the number of visits received, may
   be a poor predictor of plant reproductive success, particularly when
   there are trade-offs between visit quantity and components of visit
   quality. For example, the duration of pollinator visits may be
   negatively correlated with the number of visits received by a flower. We
   tested for a trade-off between the number of bumblebee visits and the
   duration of those visits in an experimental population of snapdragons
   (Antirrhinum majus: Scrophulariaceae). The duration of a bumblebee visit
   to a flower increased significantly with the time interval since the
   flower had last been visited. Over the lifetime of a flower the
   correlation between the total number and average duration of visits
   received by a flower was weakly negative. However, at the whole-plant
   level the correlation was positive: plants whose flowers received more
   visits also received visits of longer duration. Factors affecting the
   relationship between quantity and duration of pollinator visits to
   flowers also were investigated. Two factors weakened the negative
   dependence of average visit duration on number of visits received by
   individual snapdragon flowers: (1) the correlation between the total
   number of visits to a flower and the average interval between visits was
   only -0.53, as visits to individual flowers were not very evenly spaced
   over time, and (2) newly opened flowers received fewer and shorter
   visits than older flowers. Comparing whole plants, nectar production per
   flower varied dramatically across individuals, a probable explanation
   for the positive correlation between visit number and average duration
   per flower observed at the plant level. The potential for a trade-off
   between these two components of pollinator service exists when visit
   duration depends on reward quantity, whether the trade-off is realized
   will depend on variation in nectar production and on whether pollinators
   forage systematically.}},

   consistent phylogeny in the combined data analysis. Morphological
   evolution in Exostema involves many specializations for xeric habitats,
   reflecting repeated ecological shifts from moist forest to exposed,

   Both moth and bee pollination syndromes are found in Exostema, and

Abstract = {{To improve our understanding of the floral biology, pollination, and
   systematics of the genus Narcissus, a comparative study was made of
   flower Volatiles from nine species native to southern Spain using
   headspace collection and GC-MS analysis. The species fell into three
   fragrance types based on the identity of their major volatiles. In all
   but one species the fragrances consisted mainly of monoterpene
   isoprenoids mixed with benzenoids: in six species trans-beta-ocimene
   occurred in high proportions, in two others it was lacking; the last
   species had a fragrance dominated by fatty acid derivatives, mixed with
   terpenoids. Two of the species showed marked intraspecific variation in
   many of their volatiles. When the volatile data matrix of ail species
   was subjected to cluster analyses and the resulting phenetic trees
   compared with currently recognized taxonomic groups, there was no
   congruence at the subgeneric level. However, there was considerable
   agreement at the sectional level, although in most sections we studied
   only a single species. This apparent agreement was stronger when the
   volatiles were analyzed according to shared biosynthetic pathways rather
   than treated individually, pointing to the higher value of using
   biosynthetic pathways for uncovering and confirming phenetic, and
   probable evolutionary, relationships among species. In terms of possible
   selective pressures from pollinators in shaping fragrance chemistry,
   available information on the pollination of our species suggested an
   association between fragrance and types of pollinators. Two
   pollinator-fragrance groups were apparent: (1) species pollinated by
   insects that include butterflies and moths displayed fragrances
   containing volatiles typical of moth-pollinated flowers, most
   particularly indole combined with high amounts of eaters, and (2)
   species visited exclusively by insects other than butterflies and moths,
   especially by bees and flies, had fragrances lacking this combination of
   volatiles. Narcissus assoanus was unusual among our species in having
   both fragrance chemotypes. Future pollination studies of Narcissus in
   the field are needed to test the reliability and predictability of the
   proposed fragrance-pollinator associations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

   I. aggregata, which contain superior nectar rewards and have relatively
   broad corolla tubes, relative to flowers of I. tenuituba, which are
   white, contain small nectar rewards, and have narrow tubes. There was no

   preferred to visit the more rewarding, wider tubed I. aggregata. These

   lateral parts of the labellum (Beadlea dutraei, Pelexia bonariensis,
   Stenorrhynchos orchioides, Spiranthinae). The spur of Habenaria is a
   nonvascularised and nonstructural nectary. The inner epidermis bears
   one-celled long papillae. In bud stage, the papillae are filled with
   starch grains, but when the flower opens and nectar secretion starts,
   they show no starch grains. This fact may indicate that starch is a
   source for some of the secreted nectar. In the remainder genera, the

Abstract = {{Aristea fimbriata, A. inaequalis, and A. rupicola are new to this genus
   of some 52 species of sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar. The new species
   all occur in the western part of the southern African winter-rainfall
   climatic zone and are highly local endemics, two of them known only from
   single extended populations. All three species have three-winged
   capsules, a specialized condition that defines subgenus Aristea, a taxon
   virtually restricted to the southern African winter-rainfall zone. In
   addition the new species have pollen grains with apertures confined to
   one face of the grain, either monosulcate or trichotomosulcate, and have
   specialized, undivided styles that define section Racemosae, one of two
   sections of subgenus Aristea. Observations on the pollination biology of
   A. inae qualis show that it is probably pollinated by female Anthophora
   diversipes (Anthophoridae) bees, which forage for pollen on the flowers
   of this species. This pollination strategy conforms to that of other
   blue-flowered species of the genus, that is, they have flowers adapted
   for pollination by various species of female bees foraging for pollen. A
   revised key to section Racemosae is presented, which includes entries
   for apparently undescribed taxa that require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Two patches of the tropical weed Triumfetta semitriloba Jacq.(Tiliaceae)

   season (March to May). Ten plants per patch, and five flowers per plant
   were randomly chosen for the following pollination tests:
   self-pollination; control; bee control; high load of cross-pollen and
   high load of self-pollen. Fruits were collected to study seeds. Results
   for role of pollinators acid pollen limitation in seed production were
   different between patches, probably because of differences;in patch
   ``quality{''} (nutrient availability, number of flowers per plant and
   per patch, pollinator abundance). Seeds initiation was independent of
   pollinators, but seed initiation and seed set were increased by
   pollinators. Seed production was limited by pollen, as seed initiation
   and seed set were increased by high load of cross-pollen, only in one
   patch. Nevertheless, nutrients may also be limiting seed production,
   because a high load of cross-pollen did not maximize seed production, in
   either patch. Fruit abortion was higher in self-pollination and high
   load of self-pollen treatments, possibly because of selective abortion
   of self-progeny and fruits with less seeds. As expected for a weed
   species, T. semitriloba has a breeding system where seed production is
   guaranteed by self-pollination, but the presence of bee pollinators
   increases seed set, and probably improves seed quality by
   cross-pollination. Differences between patches showed that this species
   may experience spatial differences in reproductive success, with patches
   where seed production is limited by nutrients, patches limited by
   pollen, and patches where seed production is limited by both.}},

   have sterile petals. In samples from four Maine sites, floral density in
   Amelanchier nantucketensis was 30.3\% greater than that for Amelanchier

   Amelanchier nantucketensis, flowers were more numerous per cubic metre

Abstract = {{We studied seed set in the endangered land plant Dracocephalum
   ryuschiana L. (Lamiaceae) in 20 populations ranging in size from 1 to
   450 genets. Bumblebees appear to be the only important pollinator and,
   despite self-compatibility, very few seeds were produced in their
   absence. Therefore, seed set may be determined by bumblebee abundance
   and their foraging behaviour. Seed set in the populations varied from 3
   to 40\% of the ovules produced, indicating that the reproductive ability
   of individuals will vary substantially between sites and, hence, that
   the populations differ in their viability. Seed set was not
   significantly correlated with population size, and including other
   enviromental variables in the model did not improve the ability to
   predict seed set (stepwise multiple regression; size and degree of
   isolation of the habitat, species-richness of the vegetation, frequency

Abstract = {{Foraging organisms (like bumble bees) move between resource points (like
   flowers) whose natural distributions vary enormously: from
   hyperdispersed to random to clumped. These differences in habitat
   structure may significantly influence the fitness of both plant and
   pollinator. To examine the effect of habitat structure on pollinator
   movement and fitness, we observed captive worker bumble bees collecting
   nectar from artificial flowers containing equal volumes of reward and
   arranged in two spatial configurations: a hexagonal array with constant
   distances between flowers (''constant''), and an `'exploded hexagonal''
   array, with variable distances between flowers (''variable''). The mean
   nearest-neighbour distance was the same in both arrays, as was the
   general hexagonal appearance. The experiment therefore compares how
   resource dispersion, independent of nearest-neighbour distance,
   influences bee behaviour. Bees in the variable array showed decreased
   directionality, higher revisitation frequencies, and greater
   inter-flower flight distances than shown in the constant array. As a
   consequence, bees in the variable array had a 19\% lower gross rate of
   nectar collection. Our results suggest that wild-foraging bees should
   prefer regularly spaced flowers (when all else, including mean

Abstract = {{Extraordinary floral variation is common among some orchids that employ
   deception to attract pollinators. This variation may be maintained by
   frequency-dependent selection where rare phenotypes are preferred. Over
   a 2-yr period, 1993-1994, we monitored the reproductive success of
   Tolumnia variegata, an obligately outcrossing epiphytic orchid, at three
   localities in Puerto Rico that differed in pollinator service. Plants
   varied in floral morphology and fragrance characteristics. Artificial
   arrays of varying frequencies of scentless and fragrant phenotypes were
   established to test for frequency-dependent selection. Where pollinators
   were rare (Cambalache, range of census average = 0-0.2 bees/h),
   0.9-1.2\% of the flowers were effectively visited (pollinarium removals
   and pollinations). At Tortuguero where 0.4-1.1 bees/h were observed,
   4-9.2\% of the flowers were visited. At Pi (n) over tilde ones where
   bees were the most abundant (1.4-5.2 bees/h), 20.9-25.0\% of the flowers
   were visited. A significant portion of the variance in all measures of
   reproductive success (male, female, and combined) was explained by
   differences among populations, which we attribute mostly to variation in
   pollinator abundance. Neither the fragrance phenotype nor its frequency
   had a significant effect on success as revealed by a split-plot ANOVA.
   There was a significant interaction between population and phenotypic
   frequencies in all our measures of reproductive success, but only for
   the 1994 flowering season. Thus, variation in floral fragrance
   phenotypes is not likely maintained by frequency-dependent selection.
   High levels of variation remain unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{1. We quantified pollen deposition on the stigma, pollen removal from

   Bombus terrestris under controlled conditions. We used dye as a pollen
   analogue. Bumble-bees were trained to visit a sequence of
   non-emasculated flowers to estimate pollen carryover and to visit
   individual flowers to estimate pollen loss.
   2. Carryover of pollen grains and dye particles between flowers was
   similar, which justifies using dye as a pollen analogue. On average
   93.8\% of the dye particles on the bee were carried over to the next
   flower. Only a small fraction of the pollen grains was deposited on the
   stigma (0.15\%). A much larger fraction (6.1\%) was lost in another way:
   passively during flight, through grooming or on floral parts other than
   the stigma. The bees removed 44\% of the pollen grains from a fresh
   flower and 50.3\% of this removed pollen adhered to the bee.
   3. We predict that, using the parameters mentioned above, during a
   single visit to a newly opened flower, a bee collects an amount of
   pollen grains which will bring about 60\% geitonogamous self-pollination
   in the next flower visited. The expected percentage of self-pollination
   is considerably less if bees visit flowers that have been visited

Abstract = {{1. When considered together, the diversity and abundance of biologically
   similar organisms (e.g. pollinators) within a community, are more
   powerful in assessing the effects of disruption than when taken
   separately. The log-normal model of abundance and diversity is
   illustrated as a tool in applied ecology.
   2. Data were collected from sampling pollinating bees over 8 years in 13
   blueberry fields in New Brunswick, Canada. These data were used to test
   the log-normality of the species diversity and abundance relationships
   with respect to the disruption of communities by applications of the
   insecticide fenitrothion to nearby forests.
   3. Ecosystemic integrity (health) of the lowbush blueberry fields was
   assessed by using species diversity and abundance in Sugihara's (1980)
   sequential breakage model. This model was used to test the log-normality
   of data sets from fields which were affected and unaffected by
   fenitrothion.
   4. On both spatial and temporal bases, fields unaffected by the
   pesticide fitted well to the log-normal model of species diversity and
   abundance, whereas affected fields departed from that pattern. Thus, the
   relationship is useful because the samples from fields affected by
   fenitrothion presumably represent compromised integrity and decline in
   ecosystemic health.
   5. Shannon-Wiener's hierarchical diversity indices and Jaccard's indices
   of similarity were found to have little value in measuring ecosystemic
   health. For the former, none of the indices calculated showed any
   difference between communities with a lognormal pattern of species
   diversity and abundance, and those without it. Jaccard's index of
   similarity was low and similar in all the cases.
   6. In general, ecosystemic health should not be narrowly assessed
   through biodiversity but must include taxonomic and population changes
   together. The log-normal relationship linking species diversity and
   abundance is an objective standard against which applied ecologists can
   test ecosystemic integrity, disruption, health, ill-health, and
   reconstitution.}},

   attracted to a mass flowering tree, Andira inermis (Fam. Fabaceae), in
   1972 and 1996 at Liberia, a site in the seasonal dry forest of
   Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, indicated a significant reduction of
   bee pollinators due to habitat loss over the 24 year period. In 1972,
   about 70 bee species were collected from trees of A. inermis at Liberia.
   In 1996, only 28 species were collected, and their frequencies were
   substantially lower. Overall the 1996 sample represented a reduction of
   90\% in total bees collected. Samples collected during the same season
   at a second less disturbed site, Monteverde, were both higher in numbers
   of species (37) and in numbers of bees than the Liberia collections.
   Loss of habitat due to agricultural development and other
   human-disturbances such as fire are discussed as the primary reasons for
   the loss of bee species richness and abundance at the two study sites.
   Andira inermis trees varied in their relative attractiveness to bees. At
   one extreme, some trees attracted a wide variety of species in large
   numbers; at the opposite end were trees attractive to very few
   individuals. In between were trees attractive to large anthophorid bees
   such as Centris and Epicharis and to a much lesser extent to honey bees

   primarily honey bees and to a much lesser extent to large bees. Several

   greater fecundity; alternatively, greater seed set in pins could be due
   to the differential allocation of resources to male and female function

Abstract = {{To evaluate possible evolutionary links between plant-herbivore and
   plant-pollinator relationships, defense and reward characteristics and
   pollination ecology were mapped onto a morphologically estimated
   phylogeny of 42 species of Dalechampia. This procedure generated
   detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and
   pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of
   chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions.
   Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in
   Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of
   triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers, This feature was a
   preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based,
   pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees
   originated as a `'transfer exaptation'' (a new function replaced the
   old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of
   floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward
   resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a
   reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of
   defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large,
   involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably
   originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a
   defensive function through `'addition exaptation'' (a new function was
   added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment
   of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition
   exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping
   sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of
   involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition
   exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing
   shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also
   derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral
   resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears
   that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of
   a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification
   of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have
   been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and
   each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on
   several occasions.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of ant-guarding on Acacia trees is probably the best

   sometimes the interests of the plant and its defender conflict: for
   example, when they are in newer the Acacia trees require the presence
   and service of other insects to effect cross-pollination. How is
   pollinator access achieved in the face of aggressive ant-guards? Here we
   report that ants are deterred from young flowers at the crucial stage of
   dehiscence, allowing bees and other pollinators to visit and transfer
   pollen. This deterrence appears to be a response to a volatile chemical
   signal from young flowers, perhaps from the pollen itself. Ants patrol
   the young (undehisced) buds, and also return to the flowers after
   dehiscence, protecting the fertilized ovules and developing seeds. The
   outcome is a directly improved seed-set in the presence of ants (rather

Abstract = {{Introductions of exotic species provide unique opportunities to study
   the demographic significance of species interactions, but as yet there
   is little information on how mutualistic interactions affect the
   invasion process. A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the
   rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub
   Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the
   west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are `'tripped''
   open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with
   resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of
   Washington showed that <1\% of untripped flowers produced fruits and
   that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than
   self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean
   pollinator visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers
   tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low
   (3-30\%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and
   Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two
   native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in
   southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed
   significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and
   1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to
   2620\%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban
   populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production
   appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more
   available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994. The
   relationship between natural visitation and proportion fruit set per

   1995. Significant correlations were found between pollinator visitation
   and variation in whole-plant fruit production in all 3 yr. No evidence
   was found for either (1) reallocation of resources between branches
   within a season, or (2) a cost of reproduction between seasons in plants
   receiving supplemental pollen. Demographic analysis showed that a very
   large cost of reproduction would be required to counterbalance the
   increase in fecundity achieved with full pollination. Simulations of new
   populations invading over a short time scale (10-30 yr) demonstrated
   little effect of pollen limitation in the slow-growing urban
   populations, but a potentially large effect of increasing pollinator
   visitation in the rapidly invading prairie populations.}},

Abstract = {{We carried out two experiments to determine the effect of leaf damage on
   plant attractiveness to pollinators using Wild radish. Raphanus
   raphanistrum (Brassicaceae), a self-incompatible annual herb. Pairs of
   plants from 36 full-sib families were grown in pots in the greenhouse.
   One member of each pair was damaged by Pieris rapae larvae that were
   allowed to remove half of the leaf area of each of the first four
   rosette leaves. The plants were subsequently taken out for pollinator
   observations once a week from the beginning of flowering in late June
   until the end of August. We conducted two experiments to examine how
   foliar damage affected visitation by pollinators. In the first
   experiment, numbers of pollinators visiting planes were compared between
   damaged and control sibling plants. Tn the second experiment, the number
   of open flowers during observations was controlled to be the same for
   both damaged and undamaged sibs. Damage significantly decreased the
   number and size of flowers during the first observations in late June.
   Damaged plants received fewer visits by native bees during the first
   week of observations, Since damage did not affect native bee visits when
   the number of open flowers was equalized between treatments, flower
   number was probably the main cue attracting native bees to plants. Tn
   the experiment without flower number control, syrphid flies, the other
   abundant pollinator taxon, spent more time per flower on the undamaged
   than on the damaged plants. When flower number was controlled, flies
   probed significantly more flowers during each visit on the undamaged
   than on the damaged plants and had higher visitation rates to undamaged
   plants early in the season. Since syrphid flies preferred undamaged
   plants both with and without flower number control, they apparently used
   cues apart from flower number for visitation. The difference between
   undamaged and damaged plants in floral characteristics and pollinator
   visitation vanished within a few weeks after the start of flowering.
   This result suggests that early damage may not have a strong fitness
   effect through reduction in mating success. However, poor weather
   conditions can cause early mortality of plants in the field, and
   nutrient depletion and competition decrease fruit set of later flowers.
   Therefore. conditions exist under which visitation to early flowers may
   affect plant fitness.}},

   receipt and seed output. The long-lived, bumblebee-pollinated flowers of
   A. aurea are synchronously protandrous with a given ramet being either
   all male or all female and thus incapable of self or geitonogamous
   pollination at the ramet level. Even though each ramet changes sex over

   respect to density and sex ratio during the span of a focal ramet female
   phase. Contrary to expectation, under field conditions neither local
   density nor sexual identity explained significant amounts of variation
   in pollen receipt. Density of neighboring flowering ramets marginally

   composition on pollen receipt, the sexual identity of neighbors affected
   seed output which suggests effects on the quality of pollination due to
   changes in patterns of pollen flow. I also compared pollen loads on the
   stigmas of artificially isolated ramets (6 m) with those on experimental
   fetal ramets surrounded by six close neighbors (20 cm) that were either
   all male or all female. Here, pollen receipt by focal ramets in all-male
   neighborhoods was 1.3 times greater than in isolated ramets, and 3.8
   times greater than in ramets in all-female neighborhoods. In these
   artificial neighborhoods, stigmatic pollen deposition increased
   significantly over time. In nature, rates of bumblebee visits were
   higher in female-biased (early-flowering) than in male-biased
   (late-flowering) co-occurring floral patches, Thus, spatio-temporal
   shifts in visitation frequencies associated with the sexual composition
   of floral neighborhoods might compensate for spatial variability in
   pollen availability within populations and explain the discrepancies
   between empirical tmd experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of nonmodel deceptively pollinated orchids are polymorphic
   for corolla color These species are pollinated by naive insects
   searching for nectar, and are not mimics. It has been suggested that the
   foraging behavior of insect pollinators during the avoidance learning
   process results in these stable corolla color polymorphisms; for this to
   occur pollinators must induce negative frequency-dependent selection on
   corolla color. Therefore the hypothesis that pollinator behavior results
   in a preference for rare color morphs of deceptive species was tested
   experimentally. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) foraged in the laboratory
   on arrays of artificial flowers with different corolla color morphs.
   Morphs were varied in frequency, and bumblebee preferences were recorded
   on arrays where morphs did and did not contain sucrose solution rewards.
   Bumblebees preferred the most common color morph when flowers contained
   sucrose solution rewards, but overvisited rare morphs when sampling
   dowers that contained no rewards. Bumblebees also tended to move between
   unlike color morphs when these were unrewarding, suggesting that a
   probabilistic sampling strategy was adopted. Thus experiments
   demonstrated that pollinator behavior could result in a selective
   advantage for rare color morphs of plant species that are pollinated by
   deception without mimicry, which would induce negative
   frequency-dependent selection on corolla color. The observed pollinator
   behavior could allow stable corolla color polymorphisms to be maintained
   by selection in nonmodel deceptively pollinated species.}},

Abstract = {{Hemerocallis hakuunensis, a Korean endemic species, maintains
   considerably higher levels of allozyme variation within populations
   (mean He=0.253) and substantially lower levels of allozyme divergence
   among populations (mean G(ST)=0.077) than average values reported for
   other insect-pollinated, outcrossing herbs. Indirect estimates of the
   number of migrants per generation (Nm=3.00, calculated from G(ST);
   Nm=3.57, calculated from the frequency of nine alleles unique to single
   populations) indicate that gene flow has been extensive in H.
   hakuunensis, This is somewhat surprising when we consider the fact that
   no specialized seed dispersal mechanism is known, flowers are visited by
   bees, and the present-day populations of the species are discontinous
   and isolated. Results of a spatial autocorrelation analysis based on
   mean allele frequencies of 19 populations reveal that only 13\% (95/720
   cases) of Moran's / values for the ten interpopulational distance
   classes are significantly different from the expected values and no
   distinct trend with respect to the distance classes is detected.
   Although it is unclear how the populations are genetically homogenous,
   it is highly probable that H. hakuunensis might have a history of
   relatively large, continuous populations that had more chance for gene
   movement among adjacent populations after the last Ice Age. In addition,
   occasional hybridization with H. thunbergii in areas of sympatry in the
   central and southwestern Korean Peninsula may be one factor contributing
   the present-day high allozyme variation observed in H. hakuunensis.}},

Abstract = {{Fifteen flavonoids were isolated from flowers and leaves of four species
   of Weigela {[}W. florida (Bunge) A, DC., W. praecox (Lemoine) Bailey, W,
   hortensis (Sieb, et Zucc,) K. Koch, and W. subsessilis (Nakai) Bailey]
   of Korea and one species (W. coraeensis Thunb,) of Japan, The flavonoid
   data indicated the presence of two distinct chemical groups:the `'yellow
   flower'' type producing flavonols and the `'red flower'' type producing
   flavonols and flavones, Two cyanidin 3-O-glycosides (glucoside and
   glucose-xylose) also occurred in all examined taxa, In the floral
   color-changing species, W,subsessilis, only quercetin glycosides
   predominated in floral tissue at first, decreasing in number and
   quantity with time, Instead, cyanidin 3-O-glycosides became present
   predominantly in flower color changing tissue from yellow to mauve,
   Weigela florida produced apigenin and luteolin glycosides, along with
   cyanidin 3-O-glycosides, which were also found in W,subsessilis, Within
   a relatively limited number of individuals (five), W. hortensis was
   unique in its production of all flavonols, flavones, and anthocyanins,
   although two individuals lacked flavone compounds but possessed all
   flavonols and anthocyanins, In effect, the putative hybrid, W. hortensis
   of Korea showed additive profiles of the parental marker compounds of W.
   subsessilis and W. florida, Pollinator (andrenid bees)
   non-discrimination between Weigela flower-color morphs leading to
   non-assortive mating was a common, which indicated no breeding barrier
   among species, This flavonoid study indicated that species of both
   sections, Weigela and Calysphyrum appeared in each chemical grouping and
   it was obvious that the arrangement based on flavonoids cut across the
   sectional treatment of Hara, Floral tissues may be directly involved in
   the evolutionary strategy of pollination mechanisms and hence, their
   inherent flavonoids may no longer support taxonomic relationships, The
   presence of flavone glycosides in Weigela would support that tribe
   Dievilleae have a closer affinity to tribe Lonicereae within the Family
   Caprifoliaceae.}},
