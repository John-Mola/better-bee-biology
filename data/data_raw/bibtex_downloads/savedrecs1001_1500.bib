Abstract = {{Different aspects of human activities can cause environmental change
   that endanger species persistence, alter species distributions, and lead
   to changes in antagonistic and mutualistic interactions, whereas
   deforestation and flooding of riparian forest results in landscapes
   consisting of patchily distributed riparian forest fragments in a matrix
   of pastures, plantations, and urban areas. Therefore, we assessed the
   richness, abundance, and trophic interactions of trap-nesting
   Hymenoptera and their parasites at four patches of restored riparian
   forest and at one reference natural fragment, of different sizes and
   ages, located at the Volta Grande Reservoir, in Minas Gerais and So
   Paulo states to answer the following questions: (1) Does the richness
   and abundance of cavity-nesting bees and wasps differ in riparian forest
   fragments according to the seasonal periods? (2) Does the composition of
   cavity-nesting bees and wasps vary among restoration and reference sites
   and between climate seasons (wet and dry)? (3) How do the degrees of
   specialization of the parasites vary among the patches of forest? We
   recorded 12 species of wasps, eight of bees, and nine species of
   parasites. Areas with longer time since restoration (reference site)
   showed higher species richness. However, the abundance was higher in
   most recent areas. The composition of bee and wasp assembly has not
   significantly changed between the climate seasons, although it is
   different between sampling areas. The richness and abundance were higher
   in warmer and rainy periods. The rate of bee and wasp mortality was
   high. The degree of specialization of parasites varies among sampling
   units, and the network of host-parasite interaction has a modular
   configuration with generalists and specialists. We concluded that the
   restored areas with more complex habitat could provide better conditions
   for the reestablishment of ecological interactions among these insects,
   the local flora, and other invertebrates, which together contribute to
   the success of the restored environments.}},

Abstract = {{Neonicotinoids are highly toxic to insects and may systemically
   translocate to nectar and pollen of plants where foraging bees may
   become exposed. Exposure to neonicotinoids can induce detrimental
   sublethal effects on individual and colonies of bees and may have
   long-term impacts, such as impaired foraging, reduced longevity, and
   reduced brood care or production. Less well-studied are the potential
   effects on queen bumble bees that may become exposed while foraging in
   the spring during colony initiation. This study assessed queen survival
   and nest founding in caged bumble bees {[}Bombus impatiens (Cresson)
   (Hymenoptera: Apidae)] after chronic (18-d) dietary exposure of
   imidacloprid in syrup (1, 5, 10, and 25 ppb) and pollen (0.3, 1.7, 3.3,
   and 8.3 ppb), paired respectively. Here we show some mortality in queens
   exposed at all doses even as low as 1 ppb, and, compared with untreated
   queens, significantly reduced survival of treated queens at the two
   highest doses. Queens that survived initial imidacloprid exposure
   commenced nest initiation; however, they exhibited dose-dependent delay
   in egg-laying and emergence of worker brood. Furthermore, imidacloprid
   treatment affected other parameters such as nest and queen weight. This
   study is the first to show direct impacts of imidacloprid at
   field-relevant levels on individual B. impatiens queen survival and nest
   founding, indicating that bumble bee queens are particularly sensitive
   to neonicotinoids when directly exposed. This study also helps focus
   pesticide risk mitigation efforts and highlights the importance of
   reducing exposure rates in the early spring when bumble bee queens, and
   other wild bees are foraging and initiating nests.}},

Abstract = {{Gregarious nesting behavior occurs in a broad diversity of solitary bees
   and wasps. Despite the prevalence of aggregative nesting, the underlying
   drivers and fitness consequences of this behavior remain unclear. I
   investigated the effect of two key characteristics of nesting
   aggregations (cavity availability and progeny density) on reproduction
   and brood parasitism rates in the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria Say)
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), a solitary species that nests gregariously
   and appears to be attracted to nesting conspecifics. To do so, I
   experimentally manipulated nest cavity availability in a region of
   northern Utah with naturally occurring populations of O. lignaria. Nest
   cavity availability had a negative effect on cuckoo bee (Stelis montana
   Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) parasitism rates, with lower
   parasitism rates occurring in nest blocks with more available cavities.
   For both S. montana and the cleptoparasitic blister beetle Tricrania
   stansburyi Haldeman (Coleoptera: Meloidae), brood parasitism rate was
   negatively correlated with log-transformed O. lignaria progeny density.
   Finally, cavity availability had a positive effect on male O. lignaria
   body weight, with the heaviest male progeny produced in nest blocks with
   the most cavities. These results suggest that cavity availability and
   progeny density can have substantial effects on brood parasitism risk
   and reproduction in this solitary bee species.}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata F. (Hymenoptera:
   Megachilidae), is one of the most intensively managed solitary bees and
   greatly contributes to alfalfa production in both the United States and
   Canada. Although production of certain commodities, especially alfalfa
   seed, has become increasingly dependent on this species' pollination
   proficiency, little information is known about how M. rotundata is
   affected by insecticide exposure. To better understand the risk posed to
   M. rotundata by the increasing use of insecticides to manage mosquitoes,
   we conducted field experiments that directly exposed M. rotundata nests,
   adults, and larvae to a pyrethroid insecticide via a ground-based
   ultra-low-volume (ULV) aerosol generator. We directly targeted nest
   shelters with Zenivex (R) E20 (etofenprox) at a half-maximum rate of
   0.0032 kg/ha at dusk and then observed larval mortality, adult
   mortality, and the total number of completed nests for both the treated
   and control groups. There was no significant difference in the
   proportion of dead (P = 0.99) and alive (P = 0.23) larvae when the
   control group was compared with the treated group. We also did not
   observe a significant difference in the number of emerged adults reared
   from the treated shelters (P = 0.22 and 0.50 for females and males,
   respectively), and the number of completed cells after exposure to the
   insecticides continued to increase throughout the summer, indicating
   that provisioning adults were not affected by the insecticide treatment.
   The results from this study suggest that the amount of insecticide
   reaching nest shelters may not be sufficient to cause significant
   mortality.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the mathematical model parameters of photovoltaic (P17)
   cells and modules represents a great challenge. In the last few years,
   several analytical, numerical and hybrid methods have been proposed for
   extracting the PV model parameters from datasheets provided by the
   manufacturers or from experimental data, although it is difficult to
   determine highly reliable solutions quickly and accurately. In this
   paper, we propose a new method for determining the PV parameters of both
   the single-diode and the double-diode models, based on the guaranteed
   convergence particle swarm optimization (GCPSO), using experimental data
   under different operating conditions. The main advantage of this method
   is its ability to avoid premature convergence in the optimization of
   complex and multimodal objective functions, such as the function that
   determines PV parameters. To validate performance, the GCPSO method was
   compared with several analytical, numerical and hybrid methods found in
   the literature. This validation considered three different case studies.
   The first two are important reference case studies in the literature and
   have been widely used by researchers. The third was performed in an
   experimental environment, in order to test the proposed method under a
   real implementation. The proposed methodology can find highly accurate
   solutions while demanding a reduced computational cost. Comparisons with
   other published methods demonstrate that the proposed method produces
   very good results in the extraction of the PV model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The world is becoming increasingly urbanized, with more than half of the
   global population now living in cities. Understanding the factors
   impacting natural communities in fragmented landscapes is therefore
   crucial for predicting how the remaining ecosystems will respond to
   global change. Ground-active arthropods, which are important in nutrient
   cycling, are likely sensitive to habitat changes resulting from
   urbanization.
   We addressed two questions: (1) What is the relative importance of local
   and landscape factors in shaping ground-active arthropod communities in
   urban woodlands? (2) How does body size (as a surrogate for dispersal
   ability) affect sensitivity to landscape-level factors?
   In the summers of 2010 and 2011, we sampled ground-active arthropod
   communities in 19 woodlands in the Chicago metropolitan region using
   pitfall traps. We also assessed local plant and soil characteristics, as
   well as landscape-level variables using GIS.
   Redundancy analyses and variation partitioning revealed that local
   factors, particularly invasive woody-plant cover and soil nitrate, had
   the most influence on arthropod communities, explaining 12\% of the
   total variation. Of the landscape-level variables, landscape richness,
   which is one measure of landscape fragmentation, explained the most
   variation; however, the shared variance between landscape and local
   variables was responsible for half (16\%) of the total explained
   variation (32\%). Landscape factors alone explained only 4\% of
   variation. No relationship between arthropod body size and landscape
   variables was observed, but several groups (e.g. ants and ground
   beetles) were correlated with landscape-level factors.
   Our research shows that both local and landscape variables are important
   in influencing ground-active arthropods, but the majority of explained
   variance is attributed to the covariation between landscape richness,
   invasive woody-plant cover, and soil nitrate. We therefore conclude that
   landscape fragmentation is likely affecting the ground-active arthropods
   through its positive influence on invasive woody plants and soil
   nitrogen.}},

   based on the nitrogen content of pollen, however, such methods provide
   no information on the distribution of essential and non-essential amino
   acids constituting the proteins.
   2. Here, we describe a method of microwave-assisted acid hydrolysis
   using low amounts of pollen that allows exploration of amino acid
   composition, quantified using ultra high performance liquid
   chromatography (UHPLC), and a back calculation to estimate the crude
   protein content of pollen.
   3. Reliable analysis of protein-bound and free amino acids as well as an
   estimation of crude protein concentration was obtained from pollen
   samples as low as 1 mg. Greater variation in both protein-bound and free
   amino acids was found in pollen sample sizes <1 mg. Due to the
   variability in recovery of amino acids in smaller sample sizes, we
   suggest a correction factor to apply to specific sample sizes of pollen
   in order to estimate total crude protein content.
   4. The method described in this paper will allow researchers to explore
   the composition of amino acids in pollen and will aid research assessing
   the available nutrition to pollinating animals. This method will be
   particularly useful in assaying the pollen of wild plants, from which it
   is difficult to obtain large sample weights.}},

Title = {{Effects of the floral phytochemical eugenol on parasite evolution and
   bumble bee infection and preference}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Ecological and evolutionary pressures on hosts and parasites jointly
   determine infection success. In pollinators, parasite exposure to floral
   phytochemicals may influence between-host transmission and within-host
   replication. In the bumble bee parasite Crithidia bombi, strains vary in
   phytochemical resistance, and resistance increases under in vitro
   selection, implying that resistance/infectivity trade-offs could
   maintain intraspecific variation in resistance. We assessed costs and
   benefits of in vitro selection for resistance to the floral
   phytochemical eugenol on C. bombi infection in Bombus impatiens fed
   eugenol-rich and eugenol-free diets. We also assessed infection-induced
   changes in host preferences for eugenol. In vitro, eugenol-exposed cells
   initially increased in size, but normalized during adaptation. Selection
   for eugenol resistance resulted in considerable (55\%) but
   non-significant reductions in infection intensity; bee colony and body
   size were the strongest predictors of infection. Dietary eugenol did not
   alter infection, and infected bees preferred eugenol-free over
   eugenol-containing solutions. Although direct effects of eugenol
   exposure could influence between-host transmission at flowers, dietary
   eugenol did not ameliorate infection in bees. Limited within-host
   benefits of resistance, and possible trade-offs between resistance and
   infectivity, may relax selection for eugenol resistance and promote
   inter-strain variation in resistance. However, infection-induced dietary
   shifts could influence pollinator-mediated selection on floral traits.}},

Abstract = {{In 2008, a new species for the French bee fauna was recorded in Allauch
   near Marseille: the giant resin bee, Megachile sculpturalis (Smith,
   1853). This was the first European record of this species that is native
   to East Asia. To our knowledge, it is the first introduced bee species
   in Europe. Here, we provide an overview of the current distribution of
   M.sculpturalis in France and we describe the history of its range
   expansion. Besides our own observations, information was compiled from
   literature and Internet websites, and by contacting naturalist networks.
   We collected a total of 117 records (localityxyear combinations) for the
   2008-2016 period. The geographical range of M.sculpturalis has extended
   remarkably, now occupying a third of continental France, with the most
   northern and western records located 335 and 520km from Allauch,
   respectively. Information on its phenology, feeding, and nesting
   behavior is also provided. We report several events of nest occupation
   or eviction of Osmia sp. and Xylocopa sp. individuals by M.sculpturalis.
   Our results show that M.sculpturalis is now well established in France.
   Given its capacity to adapt and rapidly expand its range, we recommend
   amplifying the monitoring of this species to better anticipate the
   changes in its geographical range and its potential impacts on native
   bees.}},

Title = {{Phylogeny, new generic-level classification, and historical biogeography
   of the Eucera complex (Hymenoptera: Apidae)}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{81-92}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The longhorn bee tribe Eucerini (Hymenoptera: Apidae) is a diverse,
   widely distributed group of solitary bees that includes important
   pollinators of both wild and agricultural plants. About half of the
   species in the tribe are currently assigned to the genus Eucera and to a
   few other related genera. In this large genus complex, comprising ca.
   390 species, the boundaries between genera remain ambiguous due to
   morphological intergradation among taxa. Using ca. 6700 aligned
   nucleotide sites from six gene fragments, 120 morphological characters,
   and more than 100 taxa, we present the first comprehensive molecular,
   morphological, and combined phylogenetic analyses of the `Eucera
   complex'. The revised generic classification that we propose is
   congruent with our phylogeny and maximizes both generic stability and
   ease of identification. Under this new classification most generic names
   are synonymized under an expanded genus Eucera. Thus, Tetralonia,
   Peponapis, Xenoglossa, Cemolobus, and Syntrichalonia are reduced to
   subgeneric rank within Eucera, and Synhalonia is retained as a subgenus
   of Eucera. Xenoglossodes is reestablished as a valid subgenus of Eucera
   while Tetraloniella is synonymized with Tetralonia and Cubitalia with
   Eucera. In contrast, we suggest that the venusta-group of species,
   currently placed in the subgenus Synhalonia, should be recognized as a
   new genus. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate convergent loss
   or gain of important diagnostic traits to minimize the use of
   potentially homoplasious characters when establishing classifications.
   Lastly, we show that the Eucera complex originated in the Nearctic
   region in the late Oligocene, and dispersed twice into the Old World.
   The first dispersal event likely occurred 24.2-16.6 mya at a base of a
   clade of summer-active bees restricted to warm region of the Old World,
   and the second 13.9-12.3 mya at the base of a clade of spring-active
   bees found in cooler regions of the Holarctic. Our results further
   highlight the role of Beringia as a climate-regulated corridor for bees.}},

Abstract = {{Floral monosymmetry appears to be a derived condition, arising
   independently many times, with a multiplicity of forms, and related to
   both, pollinator and plant diversification. It reduces interference
   between sexual functions in flowers and increases cross-pollination and
   allogamy. But since the description and assessment of the functioning of
   those floral features depend on fresh material and field observations,
   the number of groups thoroughly observed is limited. In the mostly
   Neotropical and actinomorphic Melastomataceae, monosymmetric flowers
   seem to be derived and the resulting herkogamy may constitute a
   mechanism to avoid anther-stigma interference and self-pollination. Here
   we studied Tococa guianensis, a Neotropical widespread shrub or treelet
   well known for its leaf-domatia ant interaction, but still lacking
   details on its breeding biology. We studied a population in UberlA cent
   ndia, Central Brazil, observing floral biology features, diversity of
   visitors and breeding system. Flowers showed diurnal anthesis and a
   single-day life span. Pollen was the only floral resource offered, and
   poricidal anthers were clustered in the centre of the flower, while
   style was bent away from flower axis creating a transient herkogamy and
   flower monosymmetry. Style moves towards the floral axis during the day
   facilitating pollination. To date we do not know other Tococa species
   displaying such stylar features, which may be an intermediate form
   between the actinomorphic Miconieae and specialized zygomorphic Tococa.
   Contrasting with previous studies, the self-incompatibility found in T.
   guianensis indicates that transient herkogamy may function to avoid
   stigma clogging with self-pollen and allow flexible use of specialized
   buzz-pollinating bees.}},

Abstract = {{Reports of world-wide decline of pollinators, and of bees in particular,
   raise increasing concerns about maintenance of pollination interactions.
   While local factors of bee decline are relatively well known and
   potential mitigation strategies at the landscape scale have been
   outlined, the regional and continental-scale threats to bee diversity
   have only been marginally explored. Here we document large-scale spatial
   patterns for a representative bee subfamily, the determinants of its
   species richness, and assess major threats to these pollinators. Using a
   comprehensive global dataset of Colletinae (genera Colletes, also called
   ``polyester{''} or ``cellophane{''} bees for their underground nests
   lined with a polyester secretion, and Mourecotelles), a species-rich
   subfamily whose organismal and physiological ecology is representative
   of many bees, we measured species richness and endemism on global to
   continental scales. We explored the relationships between bee species
   richness and potential environmental stress factors grouped into three
   categories: contemporary climate, habitat heterogeneity, and
   anthropogenic pressure. Bees of the subfamily Colletinae demonstrate the
   reversed latitudinal gradient in species richness and endemism suggested
   for bees; the highest species richness of Colletinae was found between
   30A degrees and 50A degrees latitude in both the northern and southern
   hemispheres. Centres of endemism largely overlapped with those of
   species richness. The importance of the Greater Cape Floristic Region,
   previously identified as a centre of richness and endemism of bees, was
   confirmed for Colletinae. On the global scale, present-day climate was a
   significant predictor of species richness as was flowering plant
   diversity represented by vascular plant species richness and centres of
   plant diversity. Our main conclusion is that climate change constitutes
   a potential threat to bee diversity, as does declining diversity of
   vascular plants. However, a significant overlap between centres of bee
   richness and plant diversity might increase chances for developing
   conservation strategies.}},

Title = {{Study on Reproductive Biology of Rhododendron longipedicellatum: A Newly
   Discovered and Special Threatened Plant Surviving in Limestone Habitat
   in Southeast Yunnan, China}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Rhododendron longipedicellatum is a narrow endemic species and a subject
   of urgent demand in the domestic market and overseas. Its fascinating
   shapes, brilliantly gilvous flowers, and unusual flowering time endow
   this species with extremely high ornamental value. However, only five
   wild populations of R. longipedicellatum surviving in limestone habitat
   have been found through elaborate field investigation, and the number of
   the populations decreases further or is even confronted with risk of
   extinction due to the damage of human activities. To enhance the
   protection and utilization of R. longipedicellatum, this study
   systematically investigated several important aspects of reproductive
   biology, including floral syndrome, pollen viability and stigma
   receptivity, petal color reflectance, breeding system, and pollination
   biology. The results demonstrated that arched styles not only create
   obvious herkogamy that avoide self-pollination, but also effectively
   reduce rain damage to the intrinsic characteristics of the stigma
   surface secretions, promoting the female fitness of R. longipedicellatum
   in poor weather. Pollen viability maintained a high level over the
   flowering period. The reflectance spectrum of petals had two peaks at
   wavelengths of 360 and 580 nm. Tests of OCI, P/O and artificial
   pollination all indicated that R. longipedicellatum was selfcompatible
   and that the breeding system was mixed mating. Geitonogamy mediated by
   Bombus braccatus was the primary pollination route in the natural
   environment, which suggested that the breeding system of R.
   longipedicellatum might be evolving from selfing to outcrossing. The
   pollination vector of R. longipedicellatum was very specific, in that
   only B. braccatus was confirmed to deliver pollen to the stigmas.
   Visitation frequency was influenced by the activity rhythms and resource
   requirements of the different castes (i. e., sex). B. braccatus workers
   were the most effective pollinators because of higher visitation
   frequency and more effective contribution to fruit production, whereas
   the presence of B. braccatus males might enhance pollen flow within the
   population to a certain extent. Finally, these findings not only
   provided a reliable theoretical basis for hybridization breeding of R.
   longipedicellatum as parents, but also laid a solid foundation for
   further molecular biology studies to more broadly reveal the mechanisms
   of its endangerment in the future.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 18}},
Abstract = {{The larval stage of the stingless bee Scaptotrigona depilis must consume
   a specific brood cell fungus in order to continue development. Here we
   show that this fungus is a member of the genus Zygosaccharomyces and
   provides essential steroid precursors to the developing bee. Insect
   pupation requires ecdysteroid hormones, and as insects cannot synthesize
   sterols de novo, they must obtain steroids in their diet. Larval in
   vitro culturing assays demonstrated that consuming ergosterol
   recapitulates the developmental effects on S. depilis as ingestion of
   Zygosaccharomyces sp. cells. Thus, we determined the molecular
   underpinning of this intimate mutualistic symbiosis. Phylogenetic
   analyses showed that similar cases of bee-Zygosaccharomyces symbiosis
   may exist. This unprecedented case of bee-fungus symbiosis driven by
   steroid requirement brings new perspectives regarding
   pollinator-microbiota interaction and preservation.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{There is widespread concern over the use of neonicotinoid pesticides in
   the agro-ecosystem, due in part to their high water solubility which can
   lead to widespread contamination of non-target areas including standing
   surface water. Most studies investigating the negative fitness
   consequences of neonicotinoids have focused on bees, with little
   research on the impact on other non-target insects. Here we examined the
   effect of exposure on the aquatic larval stages of the hoverfly
   Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae) to a range of concentrations
   (control, 5, 15, 50, 100 and 500 ppb) of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam;
   no published studies have thus far examined the effects of
   neonicotinoids on hoverflies. Survival was significantly lower when
   exposed to 500 ppb thiamethoxam, but this concentration exceeds that
   likely to be found in the field. We observed no effect on survival,
   development or any latent effects on adult activity budgets resulting
   from exposure to lower concentrations (up to 100 ppb). Our results
   suggest that E. tenax exposed as larvae to thiamethoxam are unlikely to
   be negatively impacted by this neonicotinoid under field conditions.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Organosilicon surfactants are the most potent adjuvants available for
   formulating and applying agricultural pesticides and fertilizers,
   household cleaning and personal care products, dental impressions and
   medicines. Risk assessment of pesticides, drugs or personal care
   products that takes into account only active ingredients without the
   other formulation ingredients and adjuvants commonly used in their
   application will miss important toxicity outcomes detrimental to
   non-target species including pollinators and humans. Over a billion
   pounds of organosilicon surfactants from all uses are produced globally
   per year, making this a major component of the chemical landscape to
   which bees and humans are exposed. These silicones, like most
   ``inerts{''}, are generally recognized as safe, have no mandated
   tolerances, and their residues are largely unmonitored. Lack of their
   public disclosure and adequate analytical methods constrains evaluation
   of their risk. Organosilicon surfactants, the most super-spreading and
   -penetrating adjuvants available, at relevant exposure levels impair
   honey bee learning, are acutely toxic, and in combination with bee
   viruses cause synergistic mortality. Organosilicon surfactants need to
   be regulated as a separate class of ``inerts{''} from the more common
   silicones. In turn, impacts of organosilicon surfactant exposures on
   humans need to be evaluated. Silicones in their great diversity probably
   represent the single most ubiquitous environmental class of global
   synthetic pollutants. Do honey bees, a model environmental indicator
   organism, forewarn of hidden risks to humans of ubiquitous silicone
   exposures? (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a recent optimization algorithm named multi-verse
   optimizer (MVO) is applied to identify the optimal parameters of the
   proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) under certain operating
   conditions. seven parameters to be optimized are xi(1), xi(2), xi(3),
   xi(4), lambda, R-c, b in order to obtain polarization curves closely
   converged to those obtained in the manufacture's datasheet. MVO is
   characterized by simple construction, less controlling parameters and
   requiring less effort in computation process. Four sets of experimental
   voltage stack are taken into consideration; two of them are used for
   optimization process while the others are used for model validation in
   the presence of two types of parameter constraints. Comparative studies
   including statistical parameters with two types of methods are
   performed; the first methods are reported in the literature like SGA,
   HGA, HABC, RGA and HADE while the second approaches are programmed such
   as grey wolf optimizer (GWO), artificial bee colony (ABC), mine blast
   algorithm (MBA) and flower pollination algorithm (FPA). The obtained
   results reveal that MVO is the best choice among the others since it
   presents less fitness function and less convergence time. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Insect pollination in basal angiosperms is assumed to mostly involve
   `generalized' insects looking for food, but direct observations of ANITA
   grade (283 species) pollinators are sparse. We present newdata for
   numerous Schisandraceae, the largest ANITA family, from fieldwork,
   nocturnal filming, electron microscopy, barcoding and molecular clocks
   to infer pollinator/plant interactions over multiple years at sites
   throughout China to test the extent of pollinator specificity.
   Schisandraceae are pollinated by nocturnal gall midges that lay eggs in
   the flowers and whose larvae then feed on floral exudates. At least
   three Schisandraceae have shifted to beetle pollination. Pollination by
   a single midge species predominates, but one species was pollinated by
   different species at three locations and one by two at the same
   location. Based on molecular clocks, gall midges and Schisandraceae may
   have interacted since at least the Early Miocene. Combining these
   findings with a review of all published ANITA pollination data shows
   that ovipositing flies are the most common pollinators of living
   representatives of the ANITA grade. Compared to food reward-based
   pollination, oviposition-based systems are less wasteful of plant
   gametes because (i) none are eaten and (ii) female insects with
   herbivorous larvae reliably visit conspecific flowers.}},

Title = {{The genomes of Crithidia bombi and C. expoeki, common parasites of
   bumblebees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JAN 5}},
Abstract = {{Trypanosomatids (Trypanosomatidae, Kinetoplastida) are flagellated
   protozoa containing many parasites of medical or agricultural
   importance. Among those, Crithidia bombi and C. expoeki, are common
   parasites in bumble bees around the world, and phylogenetically close to
   Leishmania and Leptomonas. They have a simple and direct life cycle with
   one host, and partially castrate the founding queens greatly reducing
   their fitness. Here, we report the nuclear genome sequences of one clone
   of each species, extracted from a field-collected infection. Using a
   combination of Roche 454 FLX Titanium, Pacific Biosciences PacBio RS,
   and Illumina GA2 instruments for C. bombi, and PacBio for C. expoeki, we
   could produce high-quality and well resolved sequences. We find that
   these genomes are around 32 and 34 MB, with 7,808 and 7,851 annotated
   genes for C. bombi and C. expoeki, respectively-which is somewhat less
   than reported from other trypanosomatids, with few introns, and
   organized in polycistronic units. A large fraction of genes received
   plausible functional support in comparison primarily with Leishmania and
   Trypanosoma. Comparing the annotated genes of the two species with those
   of six other trypanosomatids (C. fasciculata, L. pyrrhocoris, L.
   seymouri, B. ayalai, L. major, and T. brucei) shows similar gene
   repertoires and many orthologs. Similar to other trypanosomatids, we
   also find signs of concerted evolution in genes putatively involved in
   the interaction with the host, a high degree of synteny between C. bombi
   and C. expoeki, and considerable overlap with several other species in
   the set. A total of 86 orthologous gene groups show signatures of
   positive selection in the branch leading to the two Crithidia under
   study, mostly of unknown function. As an example, we examined the
   initiating glycosylation pathway of surface components in C. bombi,
   finding it deviates from most other eukaryotes and also from other
   kinetoplastids, which may indicate rapid evolution in the extracellular
   matrix that is involved in interactions with the host. Bumble bees are
   important pollinators and Crithidia-infections are suspected to cause
   substantial selection pressure on their host populations. These newly
   sequenced genomes provide tools that should help better understand
   host-parasite interactions in these pollinator pathogens.}},

Title = {{Neonicotinoid residues in UK honey despite European Union moratorium}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Due to concerns over negative impacts on insect pollinators, the
   European Union has implemented a moratorium on the use of three
   neonicotinoid pesticide seed dressings for mass-flowering crops. We
   assessed the effectiveness of this policy in reducing the exposure risk
   to honeybees by collecting 130 samples of honey from bee keepers across
   the UK before (2014: N = 21) and after the moratorium was in effect
   (2015: N = 109). Neonicotinoids were present in about half of the honey
   samples taken before the moratorium, and they were present in over a
   fifth of honey samples following the moratorium. Clothianidin was the
   most frequently detected neonicotinoid. Neonicotinoid concentrations
   declined from May to September in the year following the ban. However,
   the majority of post-moratorium neonicotinoid residues were from honey
   harvested early in the year, coinciding with oilseed rape flowering.
   Neonicotinoid concentrations were correlated with the area of oilseed
   rape surrounding the hive location. These results suggest mass flowering
   crops may contain neonicotinoid residues where they have been grown on
   soils contaminated by previously seed treated crops. This may include
   winter seed treatments applied to cereals that are currently exempt from
   EU restrictions. Although concentrations of neonicotinoids were low (<
   2.0 ng g(-1)), and posed no risk to human health, they may represent a
   continued risk to honeybees through long-term chronic exposure.}},

   radio-telemetry}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Asian hornets (Vespa velutina) are voracious predators of bees, and are
   the latest emerging threat to managed and wild pollinator populations in
   Europe. To prevent establishment or reduce the rate of spread of V.
   velutina, early detection and destruction of nests is considered the
   only option. Detection is difficult as their nests are well hidden and
   flying hornets are difficult to follow over long distances. We address
   this challenge by tracking individual V. velutina workers flying back to
   their nests using radio telemetry for the first time, finding five
   previously undiscovered nests, up to 1.33 km from hornet release points.
   Hornets can fly with 0.28 g tags if the tag: hornet ratio is less than
   0.8. This method offers a step-change in options to tackle the spread of
   this invader, providing an efficient means of finding V. velutina nests
   in complex environments to manage this emerging threat to pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Chaetodactylus osmiae (Dufour, 1839) is a mite parasitizing the solitary
   bee - Osmia rufa L.- used as a commercial pollinator. In this study we
   present the anatomy of female and male reproductive systems of this
   species as well as its gonadal structure and gametogenesis at the
   ultrastructural level. The reproductive systems are similar to those of
   other Astigmata. The ovaries are paired and each contains germ-line
   cells - a giant nutritive ovarian cell connected via funnel-type
   intercellular bridges to oogonia and previtellogenic oocytes. Germinal
   cells are embedded in several large somatic stroma cells. Numerous
   protrusions of the nutritive ovarian cell penetrate into the stroma cell
   cytoplasm. Conspicuous ER cisterns run close and parallel to the surface
   of the germinal cells. Oocytes entering vitellogenesis disassociate with
   the nutritive cell and a vitelline envelope composed of heterogeneous
   material appears on their surface. When vitellogenesis is completed, the
   oocytes are full of lipid droplets and two types of yolk spheres; the
   vitelline envelope transforms into a thin and homogeneous chorion.
   Paired testes are located on one side of the body, whereas the opposite
   side is filled by a male accessory gland. In testis, germinal cells are
   embedded in a few somatic stroma cells. The earliest spermatogonia form
   a compact germarium, whereas later stages are dispersed randomly within
   the testis. Spermatocytes are characterized by a superficial spongy
   layer, formation of mitochondrial derivatives, loss of the nuclear
   envelope and condensation of chromatin in threads. A single
   electron-dense lamella appears during the spermatid stage, separating
   chromatin threads from a large spongy body surrounded by arcuate.
   double-membrane bounded cisterns. In spermatids. the superficial spongy
   layer is absent. The testicular central cell in the germarium and
   structures related to meiotic division were not observed in the testes.
   Spermatozoa arc multiform cells (approx. 4 x 11 mu m) containing
   electron-dense lamella (ca. 45 nm thick) surrounded by mitochondrial
   derivatives which separate chromatin threads 45-50 run thick from
   remnants of the spongy body i.e. arcuate cistern profiles. Spermatozoa
   deposited in female spermatheca are more electron dense; the
   electron-dense lamella is deeply folded several times, whereas chromatin
   threads are present in the center of the spermatozoon and are either
   flanked by lamella folds or located more peripherally under the
   plasmalemma. Remnants of the spongy body are not discernible.}},

Pages = {{468-478}},
Abstract = {{Ornithophily is a widespread pollination syndrome that has evolved
   independently several times along the evolution of plants. It is
   reported in sixty-five plant families, including Gesneriaceae. One of
   the most diverse genera within gesneriads is Sinningia, which comprises
   species pollinated by bees, hummingbirds and bats. However, little is
   known about the reproduction biology of either species or on pollinator
   specificity in this genus. Based on investigations on flowering
   phenology, flower morpho-anatomy, volume and concentration of floral
   nectar, pollinators, and breeding system, this paper reports the
   reproduction and the pollinator specificity of Sinningia douglasii and
   Sinningia araneosa in natural areas in Brazil. Both species offer nectar
   as a resource and are exclusively pollinated by a single species of
   hermit hummingbird. Nectar is produced by glands around the ovary.
   Pollen is deposited between the base of the beak and the head feathers.
   Both species are self-compatible and pollinator-dependent. In both
   Sinningia species, the combination of protandry, pollinator specificity,
   due to long corolla tubes that exclude the visitation of short-billed
   hummingbirds. The presence of particular flower features influence the
   occurrence of pollination by specific pollen vectors, such as hermit
   hummingbirds, in deterrence of illegitimate visitors (i.e. territorial
   hummingbirds), protection against vigorous foraging, and accurate
   placement of pollen on legitimate pollinators. In addition, the foraging
   of Phaethornis on flowers of Sinningia is independent of relative
   humidity and air temperature, whereas the main factor influencing
   hummingbird visits is the luminosity.}},

Title = {{Integrating restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) with
   morphological cladistic analysis clarifies evolutionary relationships
   among major species groups of bee orchids}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-105}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Bee orchids (Ophrys) have become the most popular
   model system for studying reproduction via insect-mediated
   pseudo-copulation and for exploring the consequent, putatively adaptive,
   evolutionary radiations. However, despite intensive past research, both
   the phylogenetic structure and species diversity within the genus remain
   highly contentious. Here, we integrate next-generation sequencing and
   morphological cladistic techniques to clarify the phylogeny of the
   genus.
   Methods At least two accessions of each of the ten species groups
   previously circumscribed from large-scale cloned nuclear ribosomal
   internal transcibed spacer (nrITS) sequencing were subjected to
   restriction site-associated sequencing (RAD-seq). The resulting matrix
   of 4159 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for 34 accessions was
   used to construct an unrooted network and a rooted maximum likelihood
   phylogeny. A parallel morphological cladistic matrix of 43 characters
   generated both polymorphic and non-polymorphic sets of parsimony trees
   before being mapped across the RAD-seq topology.
   Key Results RAD-seq data strongly support the monophyly of nine out of
   ten groups previously circumscribed using nrITS and resolve three major
   clades; in contrast, supposed microspecies are barely distinguishable.
   Strong incongruence separated the RAD-seq trees from both the
   morphological trees and traditional classifications; mapping of the
   morphological characters across the RAD-seq topology rendered them far
   more homoplastic.
   Conclusions The comparatively high level of morphological homoplasy
   reflects extensive convergence, whereas the derived placement of the
   fusca group is attributed to paedomorphic simplification. The phenotype
   of the most recent common ancestor of the extant lineages is inferred,
   but it post-dates the majority of the characterstate changes that typify
   the genus. RAD-seq may represent the high-water mark of the contribution
   of molecular phylogenetics to understanding evolution within Ophrys;
   further progress will require large-scale population-level studies that
   integrate phenotypic and genotypic data in a cogent conceptual
   framework.}},

Title = {{Selecting cost-effective plant mixes to support pollinators}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{195-202}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Growing concern about wild and managed pollinator populations has led to
   efforts to create floral habitat to promote bees and other pollinators,
   especially in agricultural lands where they make important contributions
   to crop pollination. These actions all require practitioners to
   determine what mixture of plant species to select to best support
   diverse and functionally important pollinators. Like in the selection of
   areas for nature reserves, plant choices must balance function against
   differences in cost. To date, plant mixes have been compiled using
   expert opinion based on the performance of individual species, but
   researchers and practitioners have called for a systematic approach to
   optimize mixtures. We applied a decision analytic approach to select
   best flowering mixes to meet two specified objectives at the least cost:
   maximizing total bee richness or maximizing crop pollinating bees. The
   model identified best plant mixes for each objective across a range of
   budgets. Accounting for the variation in costs among plant species
   allowed for substantially more cost effective mixes with little loss in
   achieving the target objective. Including multiple objectives
   simultaneously revealed the power of the approach to meet complex goals.
   The resulting mix supported over 96\% of the bee species for both goals
   at no difference in cost. This gain in efficiency could dramatically
   increase the extent of habitat implemented and remove financial barriers
   to adoption by stakeholders and conservation practitioners.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{437-445}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Concerns about the rapid and severe declines of many bumble bee (Bombus
   spp.) species in Europe, and more recently North America, have spurred
   research into the extent and possible causes for these losses. Drawing
   conclusions has been difficult due to a lack of long-term data,
   especially for specific regions that may have different factors at play
   than the global trend. In this study, 150 years of Bombus records in the
   state of New Hampshire from the University of New Hampshire Insect
   Collection were examined. This allowed for changes in abundance and
   distribution to be tracked over time, with focus on species designated
   of greatest conservation need by NH Fish \& Game Department. Floral
   records also provided insight into the diet breadth of these species,
   which may affect their vulnerability. Evidence of drastic decline was
   found in Bombus affuris, Bombus fervidus, and Bombes terricola, as well
   as significant decline in Bombus vagans with data suggesting it has been
   ecologically replaced by Bombus impatiens over time. We suggest Bombus
   vagans receive future conservation consideration. Our analyses found a
   severe constriction of the geographic range of Bombus terricola to high
   elevation regions in the latter half of the 20th century, and its role
   as pollinator of several alpine plants necessitates immediate
   conservation action.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing recognition that the gut microbial community regulates
   a wide variety of important functions in its animal hosts, including
   host health. However, the complex interactions between gut microbes and
   environment are still unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and
   economically important pollinators that host a core gut microbial
   community that is thought to be constant across populations. Here, we
   examined whether the composition of the gut microbial community of honey
   bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are exposed to.
   We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two
   main landscape types for 6 weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or
   agricultural farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The
   gut bacterial communities of adult bees from the colonies were then
   characterized and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA
   gene. While previous studies have delineated a characteristic core set
   of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut, our results suggest that the
   broad environment that bees are exposed to has some influence on the
   relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. This
   includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and
   health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape
   exposure on honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential
   effect of exposure to different environmental parameters, such as forage
   type and neonicotinoid pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria. This
   work emphasizes the complexity of the relationship between the host, its
   gut bacteria, and the environment and identifies target microbial taxa
   for functional analyses.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that the biological species concept of the genus
   Ophrys corresponds to the general concepts of Ernst Mayr. On the example
   of two closely related forms of the fusca group in Andalucia, it is
   shown how to handle the different criteria of the biospecies concept.
   One is the high specifity of attraction of a male bee followed by a
   complex pseudocopulation behaviour which enables the correct pollen
   transfer within the species. The high specifity is caused by a highly
   remarkable imitation of the sexual pheromones of the mimicked female of
   the pollinator. Sexual pheromones of animals act as intraspecific
   signals which result in attractions of only males of the same species.
   Exactly this specific behaviour is triggered by the Ophrys flower, too.
   Thus the pollinator male is attracted only to those flowers which have
   the correct mixture of the pheromone molecules. To further ensure
   success the pollinating males also select other characters of the Ophrys
   flower as labellum size, colour, labellum hair characters, phenology and
   possibly habitat selections etc. In the sexual reproduction behaviour of
   the male insect acts as pregamic isolation mechanisms for the given
   Ophrys like for their own female.
   We were successful in confirming the high specifity of the pollination
   mechanisms in numerous field experiments, mainly choice experiments,
   this in contrast o the statements of Hennecke \& Munzinger (2013). They
   had argued that there were many different pollinator species listed in
   the literature for a given Ophrys species. However, they did not
   critically assess the reliability of these citations. For this, they
   would have had to critically read the primary literature and not only
   the secondary quotations like in Delforge (2005, 2016) or others.
   Therefore, they rehashed many of the old mistakes concerning wrong
   identifications of the bees or even the Ophrys taxons which had long
   been corrected. Especially a mixture of old and actual names of the same
   species in different combinations is annoying and seems to demonstrate
   that the authors are not really fit in the nomenclature of Ophrys and
   their pollinators. This is demonstrated by some examples, which are very
   confusing without knowledge of the bees. For example, these authors did
   not realize that a 3-4 mm bee (Andrena hesperia) could not serve as a
   pollinator of a 20 mm labellum of a large Ophrys omegaifera species.
   However, there are some cases with more than one pollinator. Besides the
   main pollinator the others I call them ``secondary pollinators{''} which
   in those cases we could check their pollination contribution in the
   population is very weak. In many cases, these secondary visitors are
   mainly pollinaria thieves because they are only attracted and try to
   copulate. However, they seem learn very quickly that Ophrys is not a
   true female and will never visit another flower of this kind. In some
   quantitative field experiments (with Eucera nigrescens/longicornis on
   Ophrys holosericea) we could confirm this hypothesis.
   The conclusion of the two authors that Ophrys species are not
   species-specific regarding sexual attractivity does not correspond to
   our field experiments regarding olfactory compound investigations in
   biotests, and does not agree with the molecular data of population
   biology and with the genetic analyses.
   The other proof the authors used in their argumentations are the
   supposed frequency of hybrids. But this is also a spurious argument.
   Hybrids are only frequent in literature and not in nature. In places
   frequently visited by orchid enthusiasts, the number of observed
   ``hybrids{''} is conspicuously high, which may indicate ``hand
   pollination{''}.
   The aim of the two authors has been to reduce the many species within
   Ophrys because they cannot be discriminated. Consequently, they try to
   establish a simplified classification system without any biological
   background. A complete anthropomorphic typological systematic like the
   ``Index of accepted plant names{''} is issued by Kew Gardens. However,
   this is in the 21st century, 150 years after Darwin, a kind of middle
   age taxonomy. They use a quite typological morphospecies concept like in
   the book of Pederson \& Faurhold (2007). This does not fit with nature.
   If you pay attention to the different criteria of the biospecies concept
   within the genus Ophrys you will recognise the many species which the
   genus makes so interesting.
   A critical list of the known specific pollinators of the genus Ophrys is
   given as an appendix.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian native meliponines are currently threatened by increased human
   impacts. The assessment of their genetic variation by microsatellite DNA
   markers can assist in the conservation of populations and help in the
   planning and establishment of efficient management strategies. The
   purpose of this study was to develop the first set of microsatellite
   markers for Melipona fasciculata, selected from partial genome assembly
   of Illumina paired-end reads. Primer pairs were designed for each
   detected locus at their flanking regions. Bee samples were genotyped
   from two different populations of Northeastern Brazil for marker
   characterization and validation. A total of 17 microsatellite loci
   displayed polymorphism. Mean H-E and H(O )heterozygosities were 0.453
   and 0.536, respectively. PIC across all loci ranged from 0.108 to 0.714.
   A genetic diversity analysis revealed high values for population
   differentiation estimates (F-ST = 0.194, R-ST = 0.230, and D-est =
   0.162) within the investigated region. PCoA and Bayesian clustering
   showed a separation of the species into two distinct clusters. These
   microsatellite markers have demonstrated strong potential for
   population-level genetic studies. Moreover, the preliminary analysis of
   the genetic diversity in M. fasciculata provides provisional evidence of
   significant population differentiation between the two studied
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Plant interactions with flower visitors are essential to understand the
   reproductive biology, evolution and distribution of flowering plants.
   Morphological convergences of flower traits have allowed flowers to
   maximize their attraction to pollinator agents leading to the concept of
   pollination syndromes. Due to habitat heterogeneity, low water retention
   and resource availability in the soil, as well as broad altitudinal
   range of the system, plants often show restricted distributions in
   rupestrian grasslands. The present study aimed to describe the floral
   biology and reproductive aspects of Collaea cipoensis, a shrub
   restricted to small patches alongside watercourses in rupestrian
   grasslands of Serra do Cipo, Brazil. Specifically, weexamined the
   dependence on pollinators to set fruits and the functional role of
   floral visitors (i.e. pollinators, nectar-robbers, nectar-thieves, and
   florivores). Collaea cipoensis is a strictly xenogamous species and two
   hummingbirds (Colibri serrirostris and Eupetomena macroura) are its
   potential pollinators. Although C. serrirostris also behaves as
   illegitimate visitor, it represents 90\% of legitimate visits, thus
   being the most important pollinator. However, the most common flower
   visitors are two important nectar-robbers, the bee Trigona spinipes and
   the syrphid Toxomerus musicus. The species is self-incompatible and
   pollen-limited, as hand-pollination increased fruit production more than
   50\%. Still, hand-pollination set only 20\% of fruits and 48\% of seeds.
   Overall, the dependence on cross-pollination, the stressful
   environmental conditions and the high floral visitation rates by
   illegitimate visitors may limit reproduction of this species, leading to
   a fitness reduction. Our results reinforce the idea that rupestrian
   grasslands conforma complex scenario that restricts the species
   distribution. (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is an ongoing campaign to DNA barcode the world's > 20 000 bee
   species. Recent revisions of Lasioglossum (Dialictus) (Hymenoptera:
   Halictidae) for Canada and the eastern United States were completed
   using integrative taxonomy. DNA barcode data from 110 species of L.
   (Dialictus) are examined for their value in identification and
   discovering additional taxonomic diversity. Specimen identification
   success was estimated using the best close match method. Error rates
   were 20\% relative to current taxonomic understanding. Barcode Index
   Numbers (BINs) assigned using Refined Single Linkage Analysis (RESL) and
   barcode gaps using the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) method
   were also assessed. RESL was incongruent for 44.5\% of species, although
   some cryptic diversity may exist. Forty-three of 110 species were part
   of merged BINs with multiple species. The barcode gap is non-existent
   for the data set as a whole and ABGD showed levels of discordance
   similar to the RESL. The viridatum species-group is particularly
   problematic, so that DNA barcodes alone would be misleading for species
   delimitation and specimen identification. Character-based methods using
   fixed nucleotide substitutions could improve specimen identification
   success in some cases. The use of DNA barcoding for species discovery
   for standard taxonomic practice in the absence of a well-defined barcode
   gap is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees in Europe have been in steady decline since the 1900s. This
   decline is expected to continue with climate change as the main driver.
   However, at the local scale, land use and land cover (LULC) change
   strongly affects the occurrence of bumblebees. At present, LULC change
   is rarely included in models of future distributions of species. This
   study's objective is to compare the roles of dynamic LULC change and
   climate change on the projected distribution patterns of 48 European
   bumblebee species for three change scenarios until 2100 at the scales of
   Europe, and Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg (BENELUX). We compared
   three types of models: (1) only climate covariates, (2) climate and
   static LULC covariates and (3) climate and dynamic LULC covariates. The
   climate and LULC change scenarios used in the models include, extreme
   growth applied strategy (GRAS), business as might be usual and
   sustainable European development goals. We analysed model performance,
   range gain/loss and the shift in range limits for all bumblebees.
   Overall, model performance improved with the introduction of LULC
   covariates. Dynamic models projected less range loss and gain than
   climate-only projections, and greater range loss and gain than static
   models. Overall, there is considerable variation in species responses
   and effects were most pronounced at the BENELUX scale. The majority of
   species were predicted to lose considerable range, particularly under
   the extreme growth scenario (GRAS; overall mean: 64\% +/- 34). Model
   simulations project a number of local extinctions and considerable range
   loss at the BENELUX scale (overall mean: 56\% +/- 39). Therefore, we
   recommend species-specific modelling to understand how LULC and climate
   interact in future modelling. The efficacy of dynamic LULC change should
   improve with higher thematic and spatial resolution. Nevertheless,
   current broad scale representations of change in major land use classes
   impact modelled future distribution patterns.}},

   use change. We explored how the biodiversity of native bee species
   changes across forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. We
   collected bee community data from 36 sites across a 75,000 km(2) region,
   and analyzed bee abundance, species richness, composition, and
   life-history traits. Season-long bee abundance and richness were not
   detectably different between natural and anthropogenic landscapes, but
   community phenologies differed strongly, with an early spring peak
   followed by decline in forests, and a more extended summer season in
   agricultural and urban habitats. Bee community composition differed
   significantly between all three land use types, as did phylogenetic
   composition. Anthropogenic land use had negative effects on the
   persistence of several life-history strategies, including early spring
   flight season and brood parasitism, which may indicate adaptation to
   conditions in forest habitat. Overall, anthropogenic communities are not
   diminished subsets of contemporary natural communities. Rather, forest
   species do not persist in anthropogenic habitats, but are replaced by
   different native species and phylogenetic lineages preadapted to open
   habitats. Characterizing compositional and functional differences is
   crucial for understanding land use as a global change driver across
   large regional scales.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agricultural practices resulting in large scale habitat loss
   ranks as the top contributing factors in the global bee decline. Growing
   Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) crops as large
   monocultures has resulted extensive applications of herbicides leading
   to the degradation of natural habitats surrounding farmlands. Herbicide
   tolerance trait is beneficial for crops such as Canola (Brassica napus)
   that are extremely vulnerable to weed competition. While the trait in
   itself does not harm pollinators, growing genetically modified herbicide
   tolerant cultivars indirectly contributes towards pollinator declines
   through habitat loss. Canola, a mass-flowering crop is highly attractive
   to bee pollinators and the extensive adoption of the herbicide tolerant
   trait has led to depletion of non-crop floral resources. Extensive use
   of herbicide in and near fields with herbicide tolerant cultivars
   systematically eliminates semi-natural habitats around agricultural
   fields which consist of non-crop flowering plants. Planting pollinator
   strips provides floral resources for bees after crop flowering. We
   document the bee genera in canola and the adjoining pollinator strip.
   The overlap in bee genera reinforces the importance of pollinator
   habitats in agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{1. Accumulating evidence shows that landscape fragmentation drives the
   observed worldwide decline in populations of pollinators, particularly
   in species of Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. However, Little is known
   about the effects of landscape fragmentation on hoverfly (Diptera,
   Syrphidae) communities. Hoverflies provide varied ecosystem services:
   larvae contribute to waste decomposition (saprophagous species) and pest
   control (aphidophagous species), and adults pollinate a wide range of
   flowers.
   2. To determine how the diversity and quantity of resources for larvae
   and adults affect hoverfly abundance and species richness at three
   spatial scales, we recorded insect visitors of five target plant species
   in Belgian heathlands, habitats that have decreased considerably due to
   human activities.
   3. Hoverflies represented the most abundant visitors on two plant
   species, and the second most abundant visitors (after bumblebees) on the
   other target plant species. A large proportion of hoverflies observed
   were aphidophagous species associated with coniferous and deciduous
   forests. Resources for the larvae and floral resources for the adults
   influenced interactions among hoverflies and plants, but acted at
   different scales: larval habitat availability (distance to larval
   habitat) was relevant at the landscape scale, whereas adult resource
   availability (floral density) was relevant at the plot scale.
   4. Hoverfly abundance and species richness decreased with distance to
   larval habitat but increased with floral density. Moreover, landscape
   structure and composition had different effects according to hoverfly
   ecological traits. Landscape composition influenced aphidophagous but
   not saprophagous hoverflies, in that their abundance and species
   richness decreased with distance to forests. Maintenance of the
   interactions between plants and their hoverfly visitors requires
   complementary resources at both landscape and local scales.}},

Abstract = {{Bombyliinae, one of the largest subfamilies of Bombyliidae, including 78
   genera assigned to four tribes, is distributed on all continents except
   Antarctica. Their larvae are parasitoids, and adults are important
   pollinators. The Australian Bombyliinae currently has 17 described
   genera and 87 described species. The purpose of this study is to
   establish the phylogeny of the Australian members of the subfamily
   Bombyliinae, including the boundaries and relationships of the genera,
   using morphological characters. One maximum parsimony tree was generated
   from 83 morphological characters scored for 50 species, representing all
   recognised genera and some unplaced species that we considered may
   represent new genera. Phylogenetic analysis recovered the relationships
   between the recognised Australian genera of Bombyliinae and clarified
   generic limits. The group comprises five main clades, with the genus
   Pilosia being sister to the remaining Bombyliinae. On the basis of this
   analysis, four new genera are described: Lambkinomyia Li \& Yeates, gen.
   nov., Dissodesma Bowden \& Li, gen. nov., Nigromyia Li \& Yeates, gen.
   nov. and Robertsmyia Li \& Yeates, gen. nov. Ten new species are
   described: Dissodesma immaculata Li \& Yeates, sp. nov., Dissodesma
   flava Li \& Yeates, sp. nov., Dissodesma smarti Li \& Yeates, sp. nov.,
   Nigromyia collessi Li \& Yeates, sp. nov., Nigromyia crocea Li \&

   sp. nov., Nigromyia parva Li \& Yeates, sp. nov. and Nigromyia tomentosa
   Li \& Yeates, sp. nov. Two new junior synonyms are identified:
   Apiformyia is a junior synonym of Eristalopsis and Brychosoma is a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{467-478}},
Abstract = {{The availability of floral resources is considered a key factor for the
   maintenance and conservation of pollinators. We compared the forage
   floral diversity of three types of lowland meadows (Molinia meadows,
   tall herb fringe meadows, and hay meadows) located in south eastern
   Poland. The total number of plant species was 125, including 84 species
   (67.2\%) classified as plants visited by insects. The richness and
   diversity of forage flora differed between the types of meadow. The
   Molinia meadows and hay meadows were preferred by pollinators. However,
   different taxonomic groups of pollinators can respond to the variability
   and availability of floral resources in a different way. Molinia meadows
   are of particular importance for the abundance of Bombus spp., solitary
   bees, and flies. The RDA ordination model demonstrated that the floral
   community composition, plant species abundance, plant species richness,
   and floral attributes (size, shape, phenology) were all important for
   the abundance of insect visitors in the mosaic of meadows. The cluster
   analysis showed that most plant species were visited by similar groups
   of insects; however, their proportion differed considerably. Our results
   present arguments for inclusion of semi-natural meadows into
   conservation plans and for efforts of protection of highly effective
   floral resources aimed at maintenance of pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Sex-specific chemical secretions have been widely used as diagnostic
   characters in chemotaxonomy. The taxonomically confused group of
   bumblebees has reaped the benefit of this approach through the analyses

   few from the New World. Here, the CLGS of four East-Palearctic species
   Bombus deuteronymus, B. filchnerae, B. humilis, and B. exil (subgenus
   Thoracobombus) are analysed. Our results show high levels of variability
   in the major compounds in B. exil. In contrast, we describe a low
   differentiation in CLGS compounds between B. filchnerae and its
   phylogenetically closely related taxon B. muscorum. Moreover, the
   chemical profiles of B. filchnerae and B. muscorum are characterized by
   low concentrations of the C16 component, which is found in higher
   concentrations in the other Thoracobombus species. This raises the
   possibility that courtship behavior as well as environmental constraints
   could affect the role of the bumblebee males' CLGS.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Gynodioecy, the co-occurrence of females and hermaphrodites, is arguably
   the most common angiosperm gender polymorphism in many florae. Females'
   ability to invade and persist among hermaphrodites depends, in part, on
   pollinators providing adequate pollination to females. We directly
   measured diurnal and nocturnal pollinators' contributions to female and
   hermaphrodite seed production in artificial populations of gynodioecious
   Silene vulgaris by experimentally restricting pollinator access. We
   found that female relative seed production in this system depended
   strongly on pollination context: females produced more than twice as
   many seeds as hermaphrodites in the context of abundant,
   nectar-collecting moths. Conversely, females showed no seed production
   advantage in the context of pollen-collecting syrphid flies and bees due
   to acutely hermaphrodite-biased visitation. We infer that variation in
   pollinator type, behaviour and abundance may be important for achieving
   the female relative fitness thresholds necessary for the maintenance of
   gynodioecy. Generally, our study illustrates how pollinator-mediated
   mechanisms may influence the evolution of breeding systems and
   associated suites of floral traits. Segments of a pollinator community
   may facilitate gynodioecy by selecting for plant characteristics that
   increase the attractiveness of both sexes to pollinators, such as nectar
   rewards. Conversely, discriminating visitors in search of pollen may
   restrict gynodioecy in associated plant lineages by reducing male
   steriles' fitness below threshold levels.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an essential ecosystem service that can be affected by
   habitat features in the immediate environment, termed here `local
   landscape features'. This study tested how five local landscape features
   (bare ground, native biodiversity plantings, homestead gardens,
   shelterbelts, and control areas of pasture) affect local pollinator
   communities on Canterbury farms. We also compared two sampling methods
   (flower visitation to native potted plants vs sticky traps) to determine
   if the sampling method affects the results of landscape-feature
   comparisons. We recorded 928 pollinators of 17 taxa on the potted plants
   and 791 pollinators of 16 taxa on the sticky traps. There were
   significant differences in pollinator abundances between the landscape
   features and the control areas. Both sampling methods recorded fewer
   pollinators overall at shelterbelts and bare ground sites than control
   sites, although morning-evening fly was more common at bare ground
   sites. However, the methods gave contrasting results for biodiversity
   plantings and gardens: the flower method recorded significantly more
   pollinators in biodiversity plantings and gardens than it did at control
   sites, whereas the sticky trap method recorded significantly fewer. As
   the flower method showed higher pollinator abundances near biodiversity
   plantings and gardens, planting native insect-pollinated plants on farms
   could boost populations of wild pollinators, which may improve crop
   pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Whether honeybees utilise oilseed rape (Brassica napus), and thus come
   into contact with neonicotinoid pesticides, has been questioned in the
   UK. Here we report the melissopalynology of honey samples taken from
   hives in the northeast of the UK from 2014 to 2015. The results show
   that Brassica pollen is predominant in honey extractions from June,
   following the mass bloom of oilseed rape. Honey extractions from July
   and September show more diverse sources of nectar from entomophilous
   crops, weeds and garden plants. Our results clearly show that honeybees
   will extensively utilise oilseed rape mass blooms in spring, and any
   change in the current European Union moratorium on neonicotinoids should
   be carefully considered. We also confirm the importance of gardens (when
   planted with bee-friendly flowers') in sustaining pollinators within
   suburban to rural environments.}},

   estimate of 133,492 nesting females exceeds previously reported
   occurrences for this species by two orders of magnitude. Floral
   resources supporting this aggregation over three years of observation
   included dense flowering shrubs covering 16 ha of abandoned farmland

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Three synchronopatric Cactaceae species, Echinopsis rhodotricha,
   Harrisia balansae and Praecereus saxicola, have mostly nocturnal
   anthesis and similar flowers, characteristics that motivated us to
   perform a comparative study of reproductive ecology. Reproductive
   phenology was sampled monthly from December 2014 to November 2015. We
   describe floral biology, breeding system via pollination treatments and
   evaluate floral visitors from focal and filming observations. Pollen
   grains found on moth proboscis were compared among cactus species under
   light microscopy. We used fluorescent dye particles to test intra- and
   interspecific pollen flow. These three species have extended flowering
   with greater intensity in the wet season, causing high overlap. They
   have white and hypocrateriformis flowers that open at twilight or
   nightfall and last about 15h. H.balansae seems to be self-incompatible,
   while E.rhodotricha presented self-compatibility. P.saxicola presented
   self-fertility, but most of the population seems to be
   self-incompatible. We suggest sphingophily for the three species, but
   only P.saxicola was visited by Manduca rustica (Sphingidae). However, we
   observed pollen grains of all three species on the proboscis of moths,
   especially M.rustica and M.sexta. Prolonged anthesis allowed bees
   (herein considered as secondary pollinators) to visit flowers of
   E.rhodotricha and P.saxicola. It can be concluded that the studied
   species share nocturnal and diurnal pollinators, suggesting
   interspecific pollen flow, which, however, could not be detected with
   fluorescent dye particles. In view of the low frequency of primary
   pollinators, it appears that these three species have different
   reproductive strategies, ensuring the fruiting and production of viable
   seeds.}},

Title = {{Changes in floral biology and inbreeding depression in native and

Journal = {{PLANT BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{214-223}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Plant populations invading new environments might compromise their
   fitness contribution to the next generation, because of the lack of
   native specialist pollinators and/or potential mates. Thus, changes in
   plant mating system and traits linked to it are expected in populations
   colonising new environments where selection would favour selfing and
   floral traits that maximise reproductive output. To test this, we
   studied native (Mexico) and non-native (Spain) populations of the
   obligate sexual reproducing annual weed Datura stramonium. Flower size,
   herkogamy, total number of seeds per plant, number of visits by and type
   of pollinators, and inbreeding depression were assessed in native and
   non-native populations. Finally, we measured phenotypic selection on
   corolla size and herkogamy in each population. Flower size and herkogamy
   showed wide and similar variation in both ranges. However, the largest
   average flower size was found in one non-native population whereas the
   highest average positive herkogamy was detected in one native
   population. On average, flowers in the native range received more visits
   by pollinators. Hawkmoths were the main visitors in the native
   populations while only bees were observed visiting flowers in Spain's
   populations. Only in the native range was inbreeding depression
   detected. Selection to reduce herkogamy was found only in one native
   population. Absence of both inbreeding depression and selection on
   floral traits suggest a change in mating system of D.stramonium in a new
   range where generalist pollinators may be promoting high reproductive
   success. Selection against deleterious alleles might explain the
   reduction of inbreeding depression, promoting the evolution of selfing.}},

Abstract = {{Malpighiaceae species are recognized for their sepal elaiophores of
   which secretions reward oil-collecting bees. Information on elaiophore
   location, structure and functioning is likely to provide valuable
   insights into pollination ecology and evolution of the family. We
   characterized the elaiophores in three Malpighiaceae species and
   compared the patterns of distribution and dimensions of these glands,
   their structural organization, their histochemistry and their life
   spans. Intact elaiophores from buds and 1-day flowers (bagged and
   un-bagged) of Banisteriopsis variabilis, Byrsonima coccolobifolia and
   Peixotoa reticulata were collected for structural, histochemical and
   ultrastructural studies. We also reported the behavior of
   elaiophore-visiting insects. Elaiophores exhibit uniseriate secretory
   epithelium covered by a thick cuticle and vascularized parenchyma. The
   secretory surfaces can be flat (B. coccolobifolia and P. reticulata) or
   convoluted (B. variabilis). In B. variabilis and P. reticulata the
   epithelium has longer cells than in B. coccolobifolia and these become
   papillose, taking an appearance similar to trichomal elaiophores. The
   mixed secretions accumulate within subcuticular spaces and may be
   released either by a natural rupture of the cuticle (B. coccolobifolia
   and P. reticulata) or by a sudden rupture caused by the bee activity (B.
   variabilis). Different bees were observed exploiting the elaiophores,
   acting as potential pollinators or oil robbers. A greater diversity of
   oil-collecting bees was registered in B. variabilis. The differences
   identified, mainly in relation to the location of the glands on the
   sepals, in the fine structure of secretory epithelia and cuticle
   architecture, and in their secretion release mechanisms, in some way,
   can affect the behavior of visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Bees have a diversified natural history, thus the methods applied to
   study such diversity are varied. When it comes to studies of nesting
   biology, bees which nest in pre-existing cavities have been reasonably
   well studied since researchers started using trap-nests. However, bees
   whose nests are built underground are poorly studied due to the
   difficulty of finding natural nesting areas and the absence of a method
   that facilitates bee nest excavation. The latter is evidenced by the
   lack of accurate descriptions in literature of how nests are excavated.
   In this study we tested cylindrical rubber refills of eraser pen as a
   new material to be used as a tracer of underground nest galleries in a
   natural nesting area of two species of Epicharis Klug, 1807 (Apidae). We
   compared this technique directly with plaster in powder form mixed with
   water and our results with other methodological studies describing
   alternative methods and materials. The rubber refill technique overcame
   the main issues presented by materials such as plaster, molten metal
   alloys and bioplastic, namely: death of the organisms by high
   temperatures and/or formation of plugs and materials unduly following
   the roots inside the galleries. (C) 2017 Sociedade Brasileira de

Abstract = {{Fruit set represents the very first step of fruit development. This
   study investigated the effect of different fruit-setting methods
   {[}1-(2-chloro-4-pyridyl)-3-phenylurea (CPPU) treatment, artificial
   pollination, and honey bee pollination] on the concentrations of
   fructose, glucose, and sucrose, and the activities of sucrose
   metabolising enzymes of watermelon fruit under plastic film greenhouse
   conditions. No significant difference in fructose and glucose
   concentrations was observed among the three treatments at fully ripe
   stage of fruit {[}33 days after anthesis (33 DAA)]. However, artificial
   and honey bee pollination significantly increased sucrose concentration.
   Measurement of sucrose metabolising enzyme activities and correlation
   analysis demonstrated that the increased activity of SuSy-s (sucrose
   synthase, synthesis direction) is the key mechanism of increased sucrose
   concentration in the artificially pollinated and honey bee pollinated
   fruits. The concentrations of fructose, glucose, and sucrose were
   similar between artificially pollinated and honey bee-pollinated fruits
   at fully ripe stage (33 DAA). Therefore, we can conclude that artificial
   and bee pollination can improve the sweetness of watermelon fruit. In
   addition, the honey bee can provide a pollination service that is
   similar to that of artificial pollination for watermelon grown in a
   protected cultivation system.}},

Abstract = {{Although orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are known as key pollinators
   in tropical ecosystems, knowledge of their floral sources is still
   scarce, especially for those species commonly found in urban
   environments. We aimed to identify the pollen, nectar and resin sources
   used by the widespread species Euglossa cordata in an urban area in
   south-eastern Brazil. The residual pollen from 81 brood cells of nine
   nests reactivated between October 2013 and December 2014 was acetolysed
   and analysed. A total of 50 pollen types belonging to 20 botanical
   families were identified in the samples. Pollen sources included species
   from seven families; five of them were plants with poricidal anthers
   (Bixaceae, Commelinaceae, Fabaceae, Melastomataceae and Solanaceae). The
   mass-flowering trees Handroanthus chrysotrichus and H. heptaphyllus
   (Bignoniaceae) are firstly reported as important pollen sources to an
   orchid bee species. Nectar was collected primarily from plants with
   long, tubular corolla as Acanthaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoniaceae and
   Convolvulaceae. The vine species Dalechampia stipulacea (Euphorbiaceae)
   acted as a floral resin source. All pollen sources consisted of native
   plants whereas some exotic plant species were visited for nectar
   collection. Although nesting in an area encompassed by a high proportion
   of invasive plant species, Euglossa cordata females preferred to visit
   native plants to gather floral resources.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen loads collected by Melipona quadrifasciataanthidioides were
   examined in order to detect the botanical origin of pollen and to
   recognise the pollination action of these bees in an urban Atlantic

   without the use of acetolysis. The results revealed a great contribution
   of monofloral (more than 90\% of a single pollen type or more than 60\%
   if no accessory pollen was present). Quantitatively, Myrtaceae pollen
   samples followed Melastomataceae ones. Bifloral or heterofloral samples
   combine several pollen types. Besides Myrcia and Eucalyptus, the most
   frequent pollen types were Solanum, Mimosacaesalpiniifolia and
   Alchornea. The current study was related to the apiaries' surrounding
   vegetation and reflected both the resources available and the preference
   for native plant species by the bees. Furthermore, these results are

Abstract = {{Honey and bee bread samples from storage pots of Melipona quadrifasciata
   anthidioides were collected monthly from April 2015 to May 2016 in the
   Mogi Guacu Biological Reserve (22o 10' S, 47o 11' W). The flora in the
   site is characteristic of the Atlantic Forest with preserved areas of
   savanna-like vegetation surrounded by commercial forests, orchards and
   various crops of exotic and native plants. Samples were analysed with
   the use of melissopalynological methodology and 46 pollen types from 38
   genera and 30 families were identified in 25 honey samples. Fabaceae,
   Asteraceae, Myrtaceae, Sapindaceae showed the greatest pollen richness
   in honey. Predominant nectariferous pollen types were Anadenanthera,
   Cordia, Eucalyptus, Mimosa scabrella, Schefflera, Sida, Serjania and
   Vernonia. Twenty-eight types of pollen from 21 genera and 19 families
   were identified in 22 bee bread samples. Fabaceae, Asteraceae and
   Myrtaceae showed the highest pollen richness. Anadenanthera, Cecropia,
   Eucalyptus, Melastomataceae, Mimosa scabrella, Mimosa verrucosa and
   Myrcia were the most frequent polliniferous pollen types. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that honey and pollen samples
   formed two main groups of similarity, mainly due to Eucalyptus' nectar
   and pollen of Melastomataceae, respectively. Melipona quadrifasciata
   anthidioides collected nectar and pollen from the preserved areas as
   well as in the secondary and ruderal' vegetation and in cultivated
   forests/fields, suggesting their importance as pollinators both of
   native flora and exotic species. The use of trophic resources of plants
   grown with pesticides is a concern for the conservation of these species
   of bee and should be better studied.}},

Title = {{Floral preferences of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) in response to the
   abundance and species richness of flowering plants}},
Journal = {{ZOOLOGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{228-237}},
Abstract = {{For understanding the relationship between floral resources and the
   abundance of hoverflies, five meadows were selected at different
   elevations in a forested region. At each site the number of flowering
   herbaceous plants was assessed along a transect at 10-m intervals. To
   measure floral density, we counted the number of open flowers per
   species in each plot. Hoverflies visiting flowering plants were captured
   in each plot during 10 minutes. Path analysis showed that there was a
   negative correlation between plant species richness and syrphid
   abundance. Flower abundance had a strong positive direct effect on
   syrphid abundance but had indirect effects on the number of syrphid
   species. Only altitude had a strong positive direct effect on the number
   of syrphid species and this may be explained by the different climatic
   conditions. Some plant species attracted more syrphids than others.
   There were significantly fewer species of hoverfly per plot with
   increasing numbers of flowers. We interpret this to mean that plant
   species with a high density of flowers attracted more syrphids of the

Abstract = {{The Eucera complex (Apidae: Eucerini), which traditionally included the
   genus Eucera and a few other related genera comprises a large complex in
   which generic boundaries have long remained unsettled. Based on
   comprehensive phylogenetic analyses, a recent study completely
   reorganized the generic classification of the group. Unexpectedly, both
   morphological and molecular analyses indicated that the taxon known as
   the venusta-group of the Eucera subgenus Synhalonia is in fact an
   isolated early diverging lineage, distantly related to Synhalonia. The
   only three species currently known in the venusta-group are endemic to
   arid and semi-arid habitats of the southwestern USA and Baja California
   in Mexico, and are relatively rare in entomological collections. Here we
   recognize a new genus: Protohalonia Dorchin gen.n., compare its
   morphology with related genera, and present a revision and
   identification keys for the three species included. We reexamine the
   phylogenetic position of the new genus based on our previously published
   molecular and morphological datasets, which we supplement with data for
   the remaining Protohalonia species. All analyses recovered Protohalonia
   as a monophyletic group with strong support, sister to Simanthedon in
   the molecular and combined dataset analyses, or Simanthedon plus
   Martinapis in the morphological analysis; these taxa combined were
   sister to all the remaining lineages of the Eucera complex which
   together form the genus Eucera. Based on ancestral state reconstruction
   we identify unique traits supporting the monophyly of Protohalonia and
   document important diagnostic traits. Our results show that this taxon
   possesses a combination of apomorphic and plesiomorphic character states
   that appear in parallel in either the Eucera complex or outgroup taxa
   consistent with the phylogenetic position of the new genus. Lastly, we
   also propose replacement names for six new homonymies resulting from our
   recent classification of the Eucera complex.}},

   14.00; only the flowers of C. glomerata continued the opening process
   until 16.00 (GMT + 2 h). The flower life-span differed between species
   and was the longest for C. persicifolia - ca. 5.5 days and lasted
   3.0-3.5 days in C. glomerata and C. trachelium. The duration of the male
   phase was 2-3 fold shorter (C. persicifolia and C. glomerata) than the
   female phase or was equal (C. trachelium). Irrespective of the year of
   study and the species, the female-biased nectar production pattern was
   evidenced. The amount of nectar accumulated at the female phase reached
   70-87\% of the maximum nectar produced by a flower. The total sugar
   yield (0.412.2 g/10 m(2)) established for the studied species is low
   compared to other herbaceous meadow species. However, due to diverse
   insect visitors groups, the Campanula flowers can be recommended to
   support pollinators in home gardens or on idle lands.}},

Abstract = {{Hedyotis brachiata presents a phenology that concentrates vegetative
   growth and reproduction during rainy and winter season. In this study,
   we investigated floral morphology, floral biology, pollination,
   pollinators, fruit and seed dispersal aspects. It is an annual herb that
   grows in open, sandy soils. It is distylous, herkogamous and
   self-compatible. The pin and thrum plants produce high natural fruit and
   seed set, but it is highest in thrum plants. Autonomous selfing occurs
   in thrum flowers while it is precluded in pin flowers, however, selfing
   occurs due to the foraging activity of thrips. The plant is pollinated
   by honey bees and lycaenid butterflies. Other insects also pollinate the
   plant but they are occasional foragers. The plant produces multi-seeded
   capsules which mature within three weeks. Fruit is a non-fleshy erect
   and cup-like capsule which dehisces septicidally. The seed dispersal
   modes include anemochory, barochory, ombrochory and hydrochory. The
   seeds are dormant, germinate and produce new plants seasonally.
   Therefore, the study substantiates that this plant is evolved to
   complete its entire life cycle seasonally.}},

Abstract = {{Stingless bees are important pollinators of cultivated and wild plants,
   contributing significantly to biodiversity and food security. Conserving
   pollinator plant interactions is essential to secure these ecosystems
   services. The use of morphological features in the identification of
   stingless bees in the genus Hypotrigona is extremely difficult, due to
   many similarities among species resulting in taxonomic ambiguity. Here,
   we apply both traditional morphometrics and DNA barcoding as
   complementary tools for the identification of three Hypotrigona species
   from Kenya: Hypotrigona gribodoi, H. ruspolii and H. araujoi. Our
   results show that morphometrics separates H. gribodoi and H. ruspolii
   from H. araujoi; however there is an overlap between H. gribodoi and H.
   ruspolii. On the other hand, DNA barcoding separates the three species.
   There was lower genetic distance between H. araujoi and H. gribodoi from
   Kakamega (1.4\%) than between H. gribodoi collected from Kakamega and H.
   gribodoi from Mwingi (4.3\%). The high genetic distance or intraspecific
   distance within H. gribodoi strongly suggests cryptic speciation within
   this species, and that the H. gribodoi collected from Mwingi is a
   putative new species. Thus the use of morphometrics and molecular
   taxonomic approaches (DNA barcoding) provide a convenient, robust and
   reliable way to identify Hypotrigona species. It also indicates the need
   for a thorough revision of H. gribodoi species.}},

Abstract = {{The European bumble bee, Bombus terrestris, is an excellent commercial
   pollinator. In Japan, B. terrestris is categorized as an invasive alien
   species, and the use of the bee is restricted. In this study, we
   identify the native bumble bee Bombus hypocrita sapporoensis as a
   candidate commercial pollinator in Hokkaido Island. To evaluate the risk
   of disturbing the natural genetic structure if this bee is used as a
   commercial pollinator, we sequenced the mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) gene to elucidate the phylogenetic relationship
   of B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido Island and the Asian continent. In
   addition, we analyzed six microsatellites to further investigate the
   population genetic structure in Hokkaido Island. The mitochondrial
   analyses revealed that there is little differentiation within Hokkaido
   Island; however, there is considerable differentiation between Hokkaido
   and the Asian continent. Microsatellite analyses using STRUCTURE showed
   that B. h. sapporoensis in Hokkaido was divided into two genetic groups.
   Individuals belonging to each group were distributed throughout Hokkaido
   Island, and no clear geographical differentiation was observed. These
   results indicate that there would be little risk of genetic disturbance
   if bees from Hokkaido Island were used. However, it would be advisable
   to avoid importing continental bees as a pollinating insect in Hokkaido
   Island. El abejorro europeo, Bombus terrestris, es un polinizador

Abstract = {{The pollination syndrome hypothesis predicts a direct relationship
   between a set of floral characters and the principal pollinating agent.
   The presence of flowers with poricidal anthers, heterostemony and pollen
   as the only reward are common traits in Melastomataceae species and are
   associated with buzz pollination by bees. Trembleya laniflora Cong.
   (Melastomataceae: Microlicieae) is an endemic species from campo
   rupestre tropical grassland, with large and white pollen flowers
   differing from the common purple-colored flowers of the Tribe. We
   examine the relationship between the distinct floral characteristics of
   T. laniflora and its pollination syndrome and reproduction ecology. We
   observed different individuals of T. laniflora randomly sampled in Serra
   do Cipo, Espinhaco Range, Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. We carried
   out observations on their reproductive phenology (31 individuals),
   flower biology (3), pollination (23), and tested the reproductive system
   (29). Trembleya laniflora presented a seasonal flowering pattern in the
   dry and post-dry seasons (MayOctober) and set fruits during the dry,
   post-dry and rainy seasons (June-December). Floral aperture occurred
   mainly during the night and the first hours of the morning, the period
   with the greatest availability of fresh flowers and with the highest
   visitation by Xylocopa bimaculata. Tests identified the species as
   non-apomictic, self-incompatible and dependent on large bees such as
   Xylocopa, Bombus, Centris and Ptiloglossa for pollination. Trembleya
   laniflora showed a specialized pollination system mediated by a
   restricted group of bees that perform crepuscular buzz pollination.
   Floral characteristics and reproductive biology of T. laniflora are
   likely adaptive responses to pollination by large bees foraging during
   the crepuscular hours. Our results support the pollination syndrome
   hypothesis, demonstrating a direct relationship between a set of floral
   characters and the principal pollinators of the species. Dependence on
   interbreeding may promote outcrossing within and among the endemic
   populations, naturally isolated on rocky outcrops. (c) 2016 Elsevier

   an exploratory study}},

Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{365-378}},
Abstract = {{Declining pollinator insect populations is an important global concern
   due to potential negative environmental and economic consequences.
   However, research on consumer perceptions of pollinator friendly traits
   is limited. Understanding consumer perceptions is important because they
   impact behavior and product selection. In turn, this affects the
   effectiveness of relevant policies and pollinator insects' access to
   beneficial plants. This manuscript quantifies consumers' perceptions of
   plant traits that aid pollinators. U.S. consumers (n=1,243) were
   surveyed to identify their perceptions of pollinator friendly traits.
   Binary logit models and marginal effects were estimated using 22 plant
   traits and consumers' purchasing interest, existing knowledge, and
   demographic variables. Results imply consumers interested in purchasing
   pollinator friendly plants selected positive traits regardless of
   accuracy. Furthermore, consumers selected traits that aligned with their
   knowledge. Older participants had more accurate perceptions of
   pollinator friendly traits. Results highlight the challenges facing
   regulatory efforts geared towards promoting pollinator friendly
   products/practices.}},

Abstract = {{In Colombia the strawberry has become a crop of economic interest due to
   the growing demand in the foreign market in the last decade. Most
   plantations are open fields and do not use pollination strategies to
   improve the production quality. Pollination with bumblebees improves the
   quality of the fruits, although these are produced by spontaneous
   pollination. The native species Bombus atratus has been recognized as an
   efficient pollinator of Colombian horticultural crops under greenhouse.
   The present study evaluated the pollination efficiency of two orphan
   colonies in the quality of the fruits of the ``Camino real{''} and
   ``Ventana{''} cultivars planted under a greenhouse in Cajica-Colombia.
   The buttons were excluded to obtain the fruits produced spontaneously
   and to be compared with the fruits coming from the visit of workers of
   B. atratus. It was found that the visit of the workers improved fruit
   quality in the features: caliber (35 \% and 31 \%), length (28 \% and 19
   \%), fresh weight (103 \% and 90 \%), dry weight 126 \% and 145 \%) and
   number of seeds (55 \% and 81 \%) for the cultivar ``Camino Real{''} and
   ``Ventana{''} respectively. From the observations made, it was
   determined that the floral resource used by the workers of B. atratus
   was the nectar and recommendations are done about on its use in this
   crop.}},

Title = {{Are the assemblages of tree pollination modes being recovered by

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsDo the assemblages of pollination modes in restored (tree
   plantings) and secondary (naturally regenerated) forests change in
   comparison to primary forests, and how do these assemblages relate to
   species turnover at regional scale?
   LocationSoutheast region of Brazil.
   MethodsWe classified tree species found in a total of 40 forest sites
   (18 primary, 11 restored, 11 secondary) according to pollination mode,
   based on the literature. We calculated and compared functional
   dissimilarity distances, amounts of species and accumulated abundance of
   pollination modes, and functional indices of richness and evenness
   between forest types.
   ResultsFunctional dissimilarity distances were much smaller than species
   dissimilarity distances within forest types (mean <20\%, >80\%,
   respectively), indicating a small variation in pollination modes between
   sites. Functional indices of richness and evenness did not differ
   between forest types. However, significant changes were found in the
   species and abundance proportions of several pollination modes. Primary
   forests were characterized by the predominance of generalized
   insect-pollinated species, followed by secondary proportions of bee,
   wind and moth pollination; other pollination modes were
   underrepresented. In restored forests, reductions were found in
   generalized insect, moth, wind, fly, pollen-consuming insect and
   very-small insect pollination, whereas the species pollinated by bees
   and bats more than doubled. Smaller changes were found among secondary
   forests, including reductions in moth, fly and fig-wasp pollination,
   whereas there were incremental changes in bee, beetle, big animal and
   small insect pollination.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate a rather stable assemblage of
   pollination modes and also high ecological redundancy among trees
   regardless of the species replacement at the regional scale. Major
   changes among restored forests are probably in response to larger
   disturbance effects and/or restoration practices conducted in these
   sites. In contrast, smaller changes among secondary forests could be in
   response to smaller disturbance effects and natural selection processes,
   and also seem to suggest that highly resilient degraded areas are more
   likely to recuperate their functional diversity through natural
   regeneration alone. In both cases, however, efforts to recover such
   patterns should be encouraged to avoid possible negative effects in
   plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) possess the longest proboscides
   among bees. In this study, we compared the feeding behavior and
   functional morphology of mouthparts in two similarly large-sized species
   of Euglossa that differ greatly in proboscis length. Feeding
   observations and experiments conducted under semi-natural conditions
   were combined with micro-morphological examination using LM, SEM and
   micro CT techniques. The morphometric comparison showed that only the
   components of the mouthparts that form the food tube differ in length,
   while the proximal components, which are responsible for proboscis
   movements, are similar in size. This study represents the first
   documentation of lapping behaviour in Euglossini. We demonstrate that
   Euglossa bees use a lapping-sucking mode of feeding to take up small
   amounts of fluid, and a purely suctorial technique for larger fluid
   quantities. The mouthpart movements are largely similar to that in other
   long-tongued bees, except that the post-mentum in Euglossa can be
   extended, greatly enhancing the protraction of the glossa. This results
   in a maximal functional length that is about 50\% longer than the length
   of the food canal composing parts of the proboscis. The nectar uptake
   and the sensory equipment of the proboscis are discussed in context to
   flower probing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and ultrastructure on floral nectaries of Heliocarpus
   popayanensis Kunth. and Luehea divaricata Mart (Malvaceae-Grewioideae)
   were investigated for the first time. The floral nectaries of the
   analysed species are structured (can be recognised macroscopically and
   microscopically) and of trichomatic type. Significant morphological
   differences were observed between the nectaries of perfect and
   pistillate flowers of H. popayanensis, as well as between nectaries of
   this species and those of the related species, Triumfetta rhomboidea
   Jacq. The volume of nectar produced in the perfect and pistillate
   flowers of H. popayanensis and in the perfect flowers of L. divaricata
   presents significant differences that could be related to the rewards
   offered to flower visitors. No differences were observed in
   ultrastructure features of the glandular trichomes between H.
   popayanensis and L. divaricata. Nectar accumulation occurs between the
   wall and the cuticle. The predominant floral visitors in perfect and
   pistillateflowers of H. popayanensis were bees, and less
   frequentlyflies; whereas for L. divaricata were wasps, bumblebees,
   butterflies and beetles. Our results support the inclusion of each genus
   in different tribes according to the recent tribal classification based
   on molecular and morphological data of the subfamily Grewioideae.}},

Title = {{The value of small arable habitats in the agricultural landscape:
   Importance for vascular plants and the provisioning of floral resources
   for bees}},

Abstract = {{Small remnants of non-arable habitat within the farmland mosaic are
   considered important for the conservation of farmland biodiversity, but
   their contribution to landscape-scale species richness is poorly
   understood. In the present study, we examined the relative contributions
   of different habitat types to the landscape-scale species richness of
   vascular plants within farmland of varying landscape complexity. We also
   analysed pollen collected by bees to examine the extent to which the
   different habitat types contributed towards the provisioning of floral
   resources for three taxa (Bombus terrrestris, Megachile sp. and Osmia
   bicornis). We found that plant species richness increased with landscape
   complexity (defined as the proportion of semi-natural habitats). The
   relative contribution of small fragments of non-arable habitat to total
   plant species richness was high within all landscape types, especially
   in relation to the small area they covered. The importance of small
   non-arable fragments for the provisioning of floral resources to bees
   varied over time and between taxa. Bombus terrestris used the different
   habitat types differently during different parts of the growing season:
   arable fields were important early in the season, leys late in the
   season, and small non-arable habitat fragments during the mid-season
   when no mass-flowering crops were in bloom. In contrast, Megachile sp.
   and O. bicornis mainly foraged on plants occurring within grasslands. We
   conclude that small fragments of non-arable habitat are important for
   plant species richness at the landscape-scale and that their importance
   for plants may cascade to the bees that use them as foraging resources.
   Consequently, it is important to consider the entire landscape mosaic
   when taking actions to conserve farmland species.}},

Title = {{Pollinator-mediated selection on floral size and tube color in Linum
   pubescens: Can differential behavior and preference in different times
   of the day maintain dimorphism?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1096-1106}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Diversity of flower traits is often proposed as the outcome of selection
   exerted by pollinators. Positive directional pollinator-mediated
   selection on floral size has been widely shown to reduce phenotypic
   variance. However, the underlying mechanism of maintaining
   within-population floral color polymorphism is poorly understood.
   Divergent selection, mediated by different pollinators or by both
   mutualists and antagonists, may create and maintain such polymorphism,
   but it has rarely been shown to result from differential behavior of one
   pollinator. We tested whether different behaviors of the same
   pollinators in morning and evening are associated with dimorphic floral
   trait in Linum pubescens, a Mediterranean annual plant that exhibits
   variable within-population frequencies of dark- and light-colored flower
   tubes. Usia bicolor bee-flies, the major pollinators of L.pubescens, are
   mostly feeding in the flower in the morning, while in the evening they
   are mostly visiting the flowers for mating. In 2years of studying
   L.pubescens in a single large population in the Carmel, Israel, we found
   in one year that dark-centered flowers received significantly higher
   fraction of visits in the morning. Fitness was positively affected by
   number of visits, but no fitness differences were found between
   tube-color morphs, suggesting that both morphs have similar pollination
   success. Using mediation analysis, we found that flower size was under
   positive directional pollinator-mediated selection in both years, but
   pollinator behavior did not explain entirely this selection, which was
   possibly mediated also by other agents, such as florivores or a-biotic
   stresses. While most pollinator-mediated selection studies show that
   flower size signals food reward, in L.pubescens, it may also signal for
   mating place, which may drive positive selection. While flower size
   found to be under pollinator-mediated selection in L.pubescens,
   differential behavior of the pollinators in morning and evening did not
   seem to explain flower color polymorphism.}},

Title = {{Fire-induced change in floral abundance, density, and phenology benefits
   bumble bee foragers}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a dominant, and well-studied, structuring force in many
   temperate and semi-arid communities; yet, few studies have investigated
   the effects of fire on multi-trophic interactions. Here, we ask how
   fire-induced changes in flowering affect the abundance of bumble bee
   foragers (Bombus vosnesenskii) and whether differences in floral
   resource availability are due to changes in plant species composition or
   lengthened bloom of a consistent set of species within burned and
   unburned grasslands. Following fire, burned and unburned sites had
   similar early spring bee and floral abundances. However, after the early
   bloom, forager activity remained high only in burned sites, where floral
   abundance persisted for longer. Importantly, the increased floral
   abundance following fire was due to a lengthening of within-species
   flowering phenology, as burned areas later in the season retained floral
   abundance and composition similar to that of unburned areas early in the
   season. Furthermore, density of flower patches chosen by bumble bee
   foragers was significantly higher at burned sites, suggesting an
   increase in patch quality for foragers in post-fire communities. Our
   results suggest positive effects of fire for bumble bee foragers and
   forb communities in California grassland ecosystems in the year
   following disturbance, namely through differences in plant phenology and
   floral density. We conclude that fire-induced changes in flowering
   phenology can alter interspecific interactions and benefit pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{With concerns about declines in pollinating bee species worldwide, there
   is renewed interest in solitary native bee species and their role in
   pollination services. We studied the foraging preferences and foraging
   distances of Lasioglossum sordidum (Halictidae), New Zealand's smallest
   solitary bee, in urban Christchurch. Lasioglossum sordidum were abundant
   within the Christchtuch Botanic Gardens. Pollen samples taken from 40
   bees at each of two nest sites were identified using a pollen reference
   collection from the sites. Bees were collecting pollen from both native
   and exotic plants. In total, pollen from 23 different plant taxa was
   found, but 96\% came from five taxa: Asteraccae (65\%), Hebe spp.
   (16\%), Aesculus spp. (8\%), Yucca baccata (3\%) and Taraxacum
   officinale (3\%). Individual bees usually specialised in a few pollen
   types, with 74\% of bees having >90\% of a single pollen type and a mean
   of 2.6 pollen types per bee. The minimum flight distances to the nearest
   sources of each pollen type were typically 70-250 m. These easily
   overlooked bees may be assisting more in general pollination services
   given the diversity of plant taxa from which the bees were collecting
   pollen, the variation from bee to bee in the plant taxa collected, and
   the sometimes considerable minimum foraging distances exhibited.}},

Title = {{Simulation-based modeling of wild blueberry pollination}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{144}},
Pages = {{94-101}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The high variability of wild (lowbush) blueberry plants in spatial and
   genetic structure, in combination with bee foraging behavior varying
   between species, and the complexity of these factors interacting over
   time and space, are major obstacles to understanding of pollination
   dynamics subject to environmental change. The bottom-up modeling
   paradigm provides an ideal approach to bridging the gap between known
   mechanisms of individual organisms and unknown spatial temporal dynamics
   of pollination at the field scale. By linking empirical data to
   stochastically-based ecological process modeling, we present a
   spatially-explicit agent-based simulation model that enables exploration
   of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangements,
   outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather
   conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency
   throughout a blueberry bloom season. The firmly validated open-source
   model is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for
   wild blueberry pollination researches. Sensitivity analysis suggested
   that fruit set and resulting measures of productivity such as fruit mass
   and viable seeds per fruit were sensitive to parameterization of
   blueberry genotype or clone size and the amount of blueberry plant cover
   in a field. Fruit set due to pollen compatibility was sensitive to ovule
   number per flower and foraging bee density. Simulation experiments
   allowed us to compare bee pollination efficiencies at the bee taxon
   population level (honey bees, bumble bees, and native solitary bees),
   the effect of foraging distance from bee nest or colony site on fruit
   set, and test whether the mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility
   (pre- vs. post-zygotic decision making by the plant) in wild blueberry
   pollination at the field level matters in estimating yield.}},

   and despite extensive sampling of bumblebees across the QTP, records for
   just seven more individuals of B. tanguticus have been published, all
   queens. In this paper I report two recently collected workers (females)
   that extend the known distribution of the species and describe a new
   white-banded colour pattern from one of the workers. Available data on
   the species' distribution are mapped, the location of the collecting

Abstract = {{Three native palms are dominant features of the pine rocklands
   understory of peninsular southern Florida: sabal palm (Sabal palmetto),
   saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), and silver palm (Coccothrinax argentata).
   Despite the abundance of these three palm species, the breeding system
   and pollination mechanisms need further clarification. We used
   controlled hand-pollination experiments to investigate the breeding
   systems of these three species. We also observed and captured floral
   visitors, as well as examined their bodies for pollen, to determine the
   pollinator assemblages. Our experiments demonstrated that all three
   palms are self-compatible, and some flowers may set fruit with no
   manipulation. Natural (open) pollination treatments yielded more fruit
   than either cross-or self-pollination, indicating no shortage of
   pollination and suggesting that multiple visits by many pollinators
   enhances fruit set. We observed a wider variety of visitors (Coleoptera,
   Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera) to flowers of sabal and saw palmetto,
   as they offer both nectar and pollen. On flowers of silver palm, we
   observed only pollen-collecting bees. We found evidence of palm flower
   specialists in only two cases: Xylocopa micans bees carried only
   Coccothrinax pollen and Anartia jatrophae butterflies carried only Sabal
   pollen. All other visitors appeared to be generalists as they carried
   pollen from multiple plant species. These results highlight the
   importance of subcanopy palms in the pine rocklands ecosystem as they
   provide floral rewards for a wide array of insects that are beneficial
   for other plants of this imperiled habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Reclamation of coal mine lands in the eastern United States creates
   pockets of grassland habitat in an otherwise predominantly forested
   region. These sites may represent an opportunity for pollinator
   conservation if they provide valuable foraging habitat for wild bees. To
   determine site characteristics that influence bee success on reclamation
   lands, we monitored growth and reproduction of 24 commercially reared
   bumble bee (Bombus impatiens) colonies placed on 12 former coal mines
   (aged 2 to 30+ years post-reclamation) in Ohio, U.S.A. Twenty colonies
   survived the duration of the experiment (May-August 2014). All colonies
   produced both new queens (mean 21.0 +/- 37.0 SD) and males (36.5 +/-
   36.5), in proportion to overall colony size. Results of generalized
   linear models indicate that colony growth and reproduction increased
   with floral diversity and species turnover, and declined with site area
   and the proportion of forest in the surrounding landscape. The sex ratio
   of reproductive offspring was significantly more male-biased on sites
   with low flower diversity, underscoring the importance of floral
   diversity for meeting the higher resource demands of queen production.
   Floral resource composition and consistency were influenced by site age
   and surrounding landscape. Older sites had higher floral diversity and
   species turnover throughout the season than younger sites, and included
   high-quality native bee forage plants. We discuss the implications of
   this study for reclamation project managers seeking to promote bee
   reproduction and conservation.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bumblebees are influenced by socially acquired information when deciding
   on which flowers to forage. In some circumstances, however, this
   attraction towards conspecifics may lead to suboptimal foraging
   performance because the presence of multiple pollinators typically
   results in a faster rate of nectar depletion in the flower. We tested
   the capacity of bees to learn to avoid flowers occupied by conspecifics
   when they offered a lower reward than unoccupied similar flowers.
   Bumblebees were able to discriminate between poorly and highly rewarding
   flowers by using the presence of a nonsocial cue ( a wooden rectangular
   white block). When poorly rewarding flowers were indicated by social
   cues ( model bees), however, bees did not discriminate between the two
   flower types except when an additional cue was provided ( flower
   colour). These findings indicate that bumblebees attach particular
   meaning to conspecific presence on flowers, even when this could lead to
   suboptimal foraging performance. The relatively lower flexibility in the
   use of social than nonsocial cues suggests a biased positive value of
   conspecifics as indicators of rewarded flowers. (C) 2017 The Association

Title = {{Linking components of complex signals to morphological part: the role of
   anther and corolla in the complex floral display}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{135}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Signals used in communication are frequently complex, being composed of
   multiple signal components that in combination improve information
   transfer. A variety of morphological parts are typically used to
   transmit components of any given complex signal. Our understanding of
   why a given morphological part is used to transmit a given signal
   component is poor. We hypothesized that the function of a given signal
   component is improved by its association with its morphological part and
   that such parts interact functionally to transmit information. In a
   laboratory study we characterized the function of different floral
   signal components transmitted by associated floral parts and the
   interaction of those signal components. Using Solanum houstonii flowers,
   we focused on two major floral parts, corolla and anthers, involved in
   signalling bumblebee, Bombus impatiens, visitors. We further examined
   how experience affected the relationship between signal component and
   floral part. Floral visits involve a stepwise process in which bees
   approach, land and acquire pollen. We found that the corolla plays the
   dominant role in eliciting approaches by bees, whether naive or
   experienced. Landing is elicited by corolla signals and, to a lesser but
   additive degree, anther signals. Following experience, anther signals
   nearly completely dominate corolla signals in eliciting landing. The
   anthers convey signals mediating pollen acquisition, regardless of the
   bee's experience level. Our findings suggest there is selection for
   specific relationships between signal components and morphological
   parts, which in turn might drive complex signal evolution. (C) 2017 The

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The astounding variety of angiosperm flower morphologies has evolved in
   response to many selective forces. Flower development is highly
   coordinated and involves developmental associations between size and
   shape, ontogenetic allometry, which in turn affect the morphology of
   mature flowers. Although ontogenetic allometries can act as a
   developmental constraint and may influence adaptive evolution,
   allometries can evolve themselves and may change rapidly in response to
   selection. We explored the evolution of ontogenetic allometry in the
   flowers of 11 species of Loasoideae. Seven species belong to Caiophora,
   which radiated recently in the central Andes, and contains species that
   are pollinated by bees, hummingbirds, and small rodents. According to a
   previous study, the diversification of Caiophora involved departures
   from simple allometric scaling, but the changes to allometry that
   enabled flower diversification have not been explored yet. We
   characterized the ontogenetic allometry of each species with the methods
   of geometric morphometrics. We studied the evolution of allometries by
   constructing allometric spaces, in which the allometry of each species
   is represented by a point and the arrangement of points indicates the
   relations among allometric trajectories. To examine the history of
   changes of ontogenetic allometries, we projected the phylogeny into the
   allometric spaces. Inspection of allometric spaces suggests that
   ontogenetic variation is limited to a few dominant features. The
   allometries of the two main functional flower parts under study differ
   in their evolutionary labilities, and patterns of variation reflect
   pollination systems, differences in structural organization, and abiotic
   environmental factors.}},

Abstract = {{Plant stigmas and bee pollinators are competitors for pollen. Pollen
   placed on a pollinator's body can be picked up by conspecific stigmas or
   it can be collected by the pollinator as food. Hypothetically, one
   solution is for pollen to be placed on `safe sites' on the pollinator's
   body, sites where the pollinator cannot easily remove it, leaving the
   pollen for stigmas. We compared 14 sites on the bumblebee body in terms
   of the ability of the bee to groom off fluorescent power, a dust that
   may be thought of as analogous to pollen. The safest sites were along
   the midline of the dorsal thorax, the dorsal abdomen, and the ventral
   abdomen. Next, we counted how much pollen is borne on the 14 sites by
   bees visiting one nectariferous and three nectarless Pedicularis
   species. In the four species, only 7, 26, 28, and 30\% of pollen found
   on the bees were on safe sites. Finally, we observed that the 14 sites
   were contacted by stigmas of the four Pedicularis species; none of the
   most contacted sites were safe sites. Across all four Pedicularis
   species, pollen is mainly positioned on sites of the bee body that were
   beneficial for both the plant and the bee, not on sites detrimental to
   either of them. Our analysis showed that the conflict of interest
   between flowers and bees can be solved by cooperation. Pedicularis
   pollen is placed where it strengthens the mutualism between plants and
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Geographical variation in pollinators visiting a plant can produce plant
   populations adapted to local pollinator environments. We documented two
   markedly different pollinator climates for the spring ephemeral
   wildflower Claytonia virginica: in more northern populations, the
   pollen-specialist bee Andrena erigeniae dominated, but in more southern
   populations, A. erigeniae visited rarely and the bee-fly Bombylius major
   dominated. Plants in the northern populations experienced faster pollen
   depletion than plants in southern populations. We also measured
   divergent pollen-related plant traits; plants in northern populations
   produced relatively more pollen per flower and anther dehiscence was
   more staggered than plants in southern populations. These plant traits
   might function to increase pollen dispersal via the different pollen
   vectors.}},

Title = {{Attractiveness of wildflower mixtures for wild bees and hoverflies

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural intensification is considered to be a major driver of
   terrestrial biodiversity decline. Resulting loss, isolation and
   degradation of flower-rich habitats are threatening pollinators.
   Agri-environmental schemes (AES) aim to counteract these negative
   effects, including measures to enhance floral resources in agricultural
   landscapes. The impact of plant species composition on their efficiency
   to mitigate pollinator loss, however, is largely unexplored.
   2. We tested four recommended seed mixtures for their attractiveness to
   wild bees and hoverflies in a replicated plot design over two
   consecutive years against the background of the seedbank. Of the 94
   available plant species, 14 key plant species were crucial for the whole
   flower-visiting bee and hoverfly community. Approximately one third of
   each originated from the seedbank. The four top plants already supported
   80\% of flower visitors. Although seed mixtures differed significantly
   in attracting flower visitors at the plot level, the presence of key
   plants was more important than plant species diversity per se.
   3. Seed mixtures showed contrasting attractiveness for wild bees and
   hoverflies. Identification of plant species exclusively utilised by
   specific taxonomic groups opens opportunities for assorting plant
   mixtures for specific ecosystem functions or taxa of conservation
   concern. Plant species shared by common pollinators are valuable for
   overall pollinator diversity.
   4. The fact that rare and specialised pollinator species were mostly
   absent, however, substantiates that within 2 years of establishment,
   flowering resources are not the sole limiting factor in modern
   agricultural landscapes. Considering additional resources seems
   indispensable to maximise the conservation of species- rich pollinator
   communities.}},

Title = {{Prey-dependent benefits of sown wildflower strips on solitary wasps in
   agroecosystems}},
Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},

Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Sown wildflower strips can support insects that collect pollen for
   their larvae. How these strips affect flower visitors with carnivorous
   larvae, however, is almost unknown. We studied the impact of wildflower
   strips and their surroundings on two common solitary wasps: the
   caterpillar-hunting Ancistrocerus nigricornis Curtis and the
   spider-hunting Trypoxylon figulus Linnaeus.
   2. Trap-nest locations at 22 semi-natural habitats in central Germany
   formed independent gradients in landscape complexity and distance to
   either one or several wildflower strips in their surroundings. For each
   brood cell, we recorded the number of prey items, total caterpillar
   weight and spider species richness.
   3. Ancistrocerus nigricornis built more cells in proximity to wildflower
   strips and with increasing amount of surrounding grassland. Fewer prey
   items provided in landscapes with large shares of semi-natural habitats
   suggest that in these landscapes high-quality prey is available. In
   contrast, T. figulus built more cells with increasing distance of nests
   to wildflower strips. If there were few strips, T. figulus built more
   cells in grassland-rich landscapes, whereas low shares of grassland were
   compensated when several wildflower strips were present. Benefits of
   flowering strips for T. figulus seem related to flower resources for
   adults, rather than through prey provisioning.
   4. In conclusion, wildflower strips promote prey-hunting wasps through
   species- specific effects on adult and larval food provisioning.
   Considering the differential effects of wasps on crop pests
   (caterpillars) and natural enemies (spiders), the functional role of
   wildflower strips in agroecosystems may be much greater than assumed
   when solely focusing on pollination.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{1. Kleptoparasitic and parasitoid insects are expected to be
   particularly sensitive to changes in habitat availability due to their
   high trophic position and small population sizes compared with their
   hosts, but there are only few quantitative studies on their population
   changes.
   2. Here, we studied the distribution and abundance of 48 kleptoparasitic
   and parasitoid species of cuckoo wasps (Chrysididae) and eight selected
   host species recorded in Finland from 1840 to 2015 based on an extensive
   survey of entomological collections. Population trends were assessed by
   studying changes in occupancy in 10 9 10 km grid squares between two
   study periods, 1840-1967 and 1968-2015.
   3. Statistically significant decreases in occurrence were found for 11
   cuckoo wasp species and one host species, while significant increases
   were not observed for any species. Trends of cuckoo wasps and their
   hosts were positively correlated, and changes were generally stronger in
   cuckoo wasps than in their hosts.
   4. In a comparative analysis of species traits, abundance, body size and
   nesting type of host were related to occurrence changes of cuckoo wasps.
   Scarce and small species that use above ground-nesting hosts declined
   more than abundant and large species that use ground-nesting hosts.
   5. Cuckoo wasp species dependent on dead wood are more vulnerable to
   changes in the environment than species associated with open sandy
   habitats. While both groups of species have probably suffered from
   habitat loss, the emergence of secondary habitats may have benefitted
   species living in sandy areas and compensated for the negative impact of
   habitat destruction.}},

Title = {{Rapid initial recovery and long-term persistence of a bee community in a

Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-99}},

Abstract = {{1. The effects of habitat restoration are usually studied using
   crosssectional comparisons of species assemblages among sites of various
   ages or disturbance levels. Longitudinal studies, however, are necessary
   for detecting longterm responses to habitat restoration and for
   understanding annual demographic variation.
   2. To investigate the time course of bee community restoration in sites
   previously made uninhabitable by anthropogenic disturbance, we studied a
   former landfill site for 10 years from initial revegetation in 2003
   until 2013, comparing two restored sites with three nearby, undisturbed
   control sites. We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance
   and generalised additive mixed models to investigate how bee abundance
   and species richness varied over time (years), between seasons and
   between restoration levels.
   3. Landfill restoration and the creation of foraging and nesting habitat
   resulted in rapid and persistent occupation by bees, suggesting that
   efforts to restore bee communities can be successful when a source of
   colonists exists nearby.
   4. Based on earlier studies, we predicted that in restored sites there
   would be an initial rapid increase in bee abundance and species
   richness, followed by a decline to a stable intermediate level. This
   prediction was supported as bee abundance and species richness in
   restored sites increased until 2006/2007 and subsequently declined.
   5. In control sites, there were significant declines in abundance and
   species richness over time, despite a lack of anthropogenic disturbance.
   Possible contributors are changing weather patterns, especially severe
   droughts; plant community succession resulting in loss of bare ground
   for nesting sites; and increasing suburbanisation of the surrounding
   landscape.}},

Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a valuable ecosystem service, and plant-pollinator
   interactions in particular are known to play a crucial role in
   conservation and ecosystem functioning. These mutualisms, like other
   ecological interactions, are currently threatened by different drivers
   of global change, mainly habitat loss, fragmentation, or modification of
   its quality. Most studies so far have focused on the impact of such
   disturbances on particular species interactions and we thus need more
   empirical evidence on the responses at a community-level. Here we
   evaluated how habitat loss influenced the pattern of interactions
   between plants and their flower visitors in a coastal dune marshland
   community. Using data from four years (2008-2011), we assessed the
   effect of a large disturbance in the area (occurring in 2010) that
   represented the loss of more than 50\% of the vegetation cover. We found
   a considerable decrease in species richness and abundance of flower
   visitors, which resulted in a lower number of interactions after the
   disturbance. Not all functional groups, however, responded similarly.
   Contrary to the expected from previous findings, bees and wasps were
   less negatively influenced than beetles, flies and ants, possibly due to
   their higher movement capacity. Species interactions in the community
   were more specialized after habitat loss, resulting in a lower level of
   network nestedness and a higher modularity. At a species level, the
   number of flower visitors per plant decreased after the disturbance, and
   plants were visited by less abundant flower visitors. Our findings lead
   us to predict that the overall plant-flower visitor network became less
   robust and resilient to future perturbations. However, the fact that
   each functional group responds distinctly to disturbances makes it more
   difficult to foresee the final consequences on community composition and
   ecosystem functioning.}},

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{139-149}},

Abstract = {{1. Global warming can disrupt mutualistic interactions between solitary
   bees and plants when increasing temperature differentially changes the
   timing of interacting partners. One possible scenario is for insect
   phenology to advance more rapidly than plant phenology.
   2. However, empirical evidence for fitness consequences due to temporal
   mismatches is lacking for pollinators and it remains unknown if bees
   have developed strategies to mitigate fitness losses following temporal
   mismatches.
   3. We tested the effect of temporal mismatches on the fitness of three
   spring-emerging solitary bee species, including one pollen specialist.
   Using flight cages, we simulated (i) a perfect synchronization (from a
   bee perspective): bees and flowers occur simultaneously, (ii) a mismatch
   of 3days and (iii) a mismatch of 6days, with bees occurring earlier than
   flowers in the latter two cases.
   4. A mismatch of 6days caused severe fitness losses in all three bee
   species, as few bees survived without flowers. Females showed strongly
   reduced activity and reproductive output compared to synchronized bees.
   Fitness consequences of a 3-day mismatch were species-specific. Both the
   early-spring species Osmia cornuta and the mid-spring species Osmia
   bicornis produced the same number of brood cells after a mismatch of
   3days as under perfect synchronization. However, O.cornuta decreased the
   number of female offspring, whereas O.bicornis spread the brood cells
   over fewer nests, which may increase offspring mortality, e.g. due to
   parasitoids. The late-spring specialist Osmia brevicornis produced fewer
   brood cells even after a mismatch of 3days. Additionally, our results
   suggest that fitness losses after temporal mismatches are higher during
   warm than cold springs, as the naturally occurring temperature
   variability revealed that warm temperatures during starvation decreased
   the survival rate of O.bicornis.
   5. We conclude that short temporal mismatches can cause clear fitness
   losses in solitary bees. Although our results suggest that bees have
   evolved species-specific strategies to mitigate fitness losses after
   temporal mismatches, the bees were not able to completely compensate for
   impacts on their fitness after temporal mismatches with their food
   resources.}},

Title = {{Managing trap-nesting bees as crop pollinators: Spatiotemporal effects
   of floral resources and antagonists}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{195-204}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. The decline of managed honeybees and the rapid expansion of
   mass-flowering crops increase the risk of pollination limitation in
   crops and raise questions about novel management approaches for wild
   pollinators in agroecosystems. Adding artificial nesting sites, such as
   trap nests, can promote cavity-nesting bees in agroecosystems, but
   effectiveness could be limited by the availability of floral resources
   in the surrounding landscape and by natural antagonists.
   2. In two European regions, we exposed artificial trap nests in paired
   field boundaries adjacent to oilseed rape (OSR) fields or non-flowering
   crops for 2years within 32 landscapes covering two independent gradients
   of OSR cover and semi-natural habitat (SNH) cover in the landscape. We
   analysed the effects of local and landscape-wide floral resource
   availability, land-use intensity, landscape complexity and natural
   antagonists on community composition and population dynamics of
   trap-nesting bees.
   3. Numbers of brood cells showed a strong, three-fold increase in
   response to the additional nesting sites. Species richness and abundance
   of cavity-nesting bees that were active during OSR flowering increased
   significantly with increasing amounts of early season landscape-wide
   floral resource availability, such as the cultivation of OSR. Later
   foraging species benefited instead from the availability of late-season
   alternative flower resources or SNH cover once the mass-flowering had
   ceased. Density-dependent parasitism increased following mass-flowering,
   while no density-dependent effect was found during mass-flowering.
   4. Structural equation modelling revealed that the influence of floral
   resource availability on community growth rate was mediated by community
   size. Community size showed a strong negative effect on community growth
   rate. Despite positive density-dependent parasitism, antagonists had
   only weak regulating effects on community growth rate.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Trap-nesting bee populations grow
   markedly with the increasing availability of food resources in the
   landscape and effectiveness of trap nests is only marginally limited by
   natural antagonists. Thus, trap nests could be a simple
   pollinator-supporting strategy to accompany the current expansion of
   mass-flowering crops and to ensure pollination services for
   insect-pollinated crops. Trap nests benefit, not only early season
   active generalist bees during oilseed rape flowering, but also species
   with later phenology if accompanied by other pollinator-supporting
   practices.}},

Title = {{Seasonal Food Scarcity Prompts Long-Distance Foraging by a Wild Social
   Bee}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-57}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Foraging is an essential process for mobile animals, and its
   optimization serves as a foundational theory in ecology and evolution;
   however, drivers of foraging are rarely investigated across landscapes
   and seasons. Using a common bumblebee species from the western United
   States (Bombus vosnesenskii), we ask whether seasonal decreases in food
   resources prompt changes in foraging behavior and space use. We employ a
   unique integration of population genetic tools and spatially explicit
   foraging models to estimate foraging distances and rates of patch
   visitation for wild bumblebee colonies across three study regions and
   two seasons. By mapping the locations of 669 wild-caught individual
   foragers, we find substantial variation in colony-level foraging
   distances, often exhibiting a 60-fold difference within a study region.
   Our analysis of visitation rates indicates that foragers display a
   preference for destination patches with high floral cover and forage
   significantly farther for these patches, but only in the summer, when
   landscape-level resources are low. Overall, these results indicate that
   an increasing proportion of long-distance foraging bouts take place in
   the summer. Because wild bees are pollinators, their foraging dynamics
   are of urgent concern, given the potential impacts of global change on
   their movement and services. The behavioral shift toward long-distance
   foraging with seasonal declines in food resources suggests a novel,
   phenologically directed approach to landscape-level pollinator
   conservation and greater consideration of late-season floral resources
   in pollinator habitat management.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{160-164}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In sexually dimorphic species, hermaphrodite flowers in gynodioecious
   species or male flowers in dioecious species are often larger and
   produce more nectar than their conspecific female flowers. As a
   consequence, hermaphrodite or male flowers frequently receive more
   pollinator visits. Sex ratio, flower size, floral display, nectar
   production and floral visits were evaluated in two natural populations
   of Fuchsia thymifolia, a morphologically gynodioecious but functionally
   subdioecious insect-pollinated shrub. Sex ratio did not differ from the
   expected 1:1 in the two studied populations. As expected, hermaphrodite
   flowers were larger than female flowers, but in contrast to the general
   pattern, hermaphrodite flowers did not produce nectar or produced much
   less than female flowers. Flower visitors were flies (68\%) and
   bumblebees (24\%), both of which showed a preference for female flowers.
   No sex difference was detected in either flower longevity or floral
   display across the flowering season. Higher nectar production by females
   may attract more pollinators, and may be a strategy to enhance female
   reproductive success in this species. Finally, floral dimorphism and
   insect preferences did not seem to hamper the maintenance of sub-dioecy
   or prevent the evolution of dioecy in F.thymifolia.}},

Title = {{Bee pollination increases yield quantity and quality of cash crops in
   Burkina Faso, West Africa}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Mutualistic biotic interactions as among flowering plants and their
   animal pollinators are a key component of biodiversity. Pollination,
   especially by insects, is a key element in ecosystem functioning, and
   hence constitutes an ecosystem service of global importance. Not only
   sexual reproduction of plants is ensured, but also yields are stabilized
   and genetic variability of crops is maintained, counteracting inbreeding
   depression and facilitating system resilience. While experiencing rapid
   environmental change, there is an increased demand for food and income
   security, especially in sub-Saharan communities, which are highly
   dependent on small scale agriculture. By combining exclusion
   experiments, pollinator surveys and field manipulations, this study for
   the first time quantifies the contribution of bee pollinators to
   smallholders' production of the major cash crops, cotton and sesame, in
   Burkina Faso. Pollination by honeybees and wild bees significantly
   increased yield quantity and quality on average up to 62\%, while
   exclusion of pollinators caused an average yield gap of 37\% in cotton
   and 59\% in sesame. Self-pollination revealed inbreeding depression
   effects on fruit set and low germination rates in the F1-generation. Our
   results highlight potential negative consequences of any pollinator
   decline, provoking risks to agriculture and compromising crop yields in
   sub-Saharan West Africa.}},

Abstract = {{With more than 80\% of flowering plant species specialized for animal
   pollination, understanding how wild pollinators utilize resources across
   environments can encourage efficient planting and maintenance strategies
   to maximize pollination and establish resilience in the face of
   environmental change. A fundamental question is how generalist
   pollinators recognize ``flower objects{''} in vastly different ecologies
   and environments. On one hand, pollinators could employ a specific set
   of floral cues regardless of environment. Alternatively, wild
   pollinators could recognize an exclusive signature of cues unique to
   each environment or flower species. Hoverflies, which are found across
   the globe, are one of the most ecologically important alternative
   pollinators after bees and bumblebees. Here, we have exploited their
   cosmopolitan status to understand how wild pollinator preferences change
   across different continents. Without employing any a priori assumptions
   concerning the floral cues, we measured, predicted, and finally
   artificially recreated multimodal cues from individual flowers visited
   by hoverflies in three different environments (hemiboreal, alpine, and
   tropical) using a field-based methodology. We found that although
   ``flower signatures{''} were unique for each environment, some
   multimodal lures were ubiquitously attractive, despite not carrying any
   reward, or resembling real flowers. While it was unexpected that cue
   combinations found in real flowers were not necessary, the robustness of
   our lures across insect species and ecologies could reflect a general
   strategy of resource identification for generalist pollinators. Our
   results provide insights into how cosmopolitan pollinators such as
   hoverflies identify flowers and offer specific ecologically based cues
   and strategies for attracting pollinators across diverse environments.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{RNA viruses impact honey bee health and contribute to elevated colony
   loss rates worldwide. Deformed wing virus (DWV) and the closely related
   Varroa destructor virus-1 (VDV1), are the most widespread honey bee
   viruses. VDV1 is known to cause high rates of overwintering colony
   losses in Europe, however it was unknown in the United States (US).
   Using next generation sequencing, we identified VDV1 in honey bee pupae
   in the US. We tested 603 apiaries the US in 2016 and found that VDV1 was
   present in 66.0\% of them, making it the second most prevalent virus
   after DWV, which was present in 89.4\% of the colonies. VDV1 had the
   highest load in infected bees (7.45{*}10(12) +/- 1.62{*}10(12) average
   copy number +/- standard error) compared to other tested viruses, with
   DWV second (1.04{*}10(12) +/- 0.53{*}10(12)). Analysis of 75 colonies
   sourced in 2010 revealed that VDV1 was present in only 2 colonies
   (2.7\%), suggesting its recent spread. We also detected newly emerged
   recombinants between the US strains of VDV1 and DWV. The presence of
   these recombinants poses additional risk, because similar VDV1-DWV
   recombinants constitute the most virulent honeybee viruses in the UK.}},

   pollinators}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 6}},
Abstract = {{Plant responses induced by herbivore damage can provide fitness
   benefits, but can also have important costs due to altered interactions
   with mutualist pollinators. We examined the effects of plant responses
   to herbivory in a hummingbird-pollinated distylous shrub, Palicourea
   angustifolia. Through a series of field experiments we investigated
   whether damage from foliar herbivores leads to a reduction in fruit set,
   influences floral visitation, or alters floral traits that may influence
   pollinator preference or pollinator efficiency. Foliar herbivory by a
   generalist grasshopper led to reduced fruit set in branches that were
   directly damaged as well as in adjacent undamaged branches on the same
   plant. Furthermore, herbivory resulted in reduced floral visitation from
   two common hummingbird species and two bee species. An investigation
   into the potential mechanisms behind reduced floral visitation in
   induced plants showed that foliar herbivore damage resulted in shorter
   styles and lower nectar volumes. This reduction in style length could
   reduce pollen deposition between different floral morphs that is
   required for optimal pollination in a distylous plant. We did not detect
   any differences in the volatile blends released by damaged and undamaged
   branches, suggesting that foliar herbivore-induced changes in floral
   morphology and rewards, and not volatile blends, are the primary
   mechanism mediating changes in visitation. Our results provide novel
   mechanisms for how plant responses induced by foliar herbivores can lead
   to ecological costs.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 4}},
Abstract = {{Evaluations of restoration success usually focus on the structural
   aspects of ecosystems. Pollination, as an important functional aspect,
   is often overlooked. Here, the shifts in pollinator assemblage and
   pollen limitation in the desert shrub Caragana microphylla were examined
   along a restoration gradient in Horqin Sand Land, northern China. We
   identified seven species of bees; however, only four bee species were
   found to be effective pollinators, with Xanthosaurus remota dominating
   in the fixed dunes, and with no bee species or only a single species, X.
   remota, being observed in the semi-fixed and mobile dunes. Flower
   visitation rate was nearly ten times higher in the fixed dunes than in
   the mobile and semi-fixed dunes. Experimental floral manipulations
   revealed that the fixed dune populations experienced less pollen
   limitation, along with the increase in pollinator availability. Between
   the mobile and semi-fixed dune populations, pollen limitation was severe
   and at similar levels. The intensity of pollen limitation was negatively
   related to pollinator abundance and richness. Overall, the dependence on
   pollinators for reproduction may be an important constraint that limits
   persistence in this system. Increased pollinator service during the
   restoration process may ameliorate pollen limitation, benefiting the
   restoration of vegetation in this semiarid sandy area.}},

Abstract = {{The medicinal and food tree species Parkia biglobosa (Fabaceae:
   Mimosoideae) is widespread in the Sudanian savannahs of sub-Saharan
   Africa, where it has a strong socio-cultural and economic importance.
   Populations of this species are highly threatened in large parts of its
   range due to overexploitation and environmental degradation. In the
   light of climatic changes, safeguarding the genetic diversity of the
   species is crucial to foster adaptation and to support its long-term
   survival. Genetic insight is also relevant to guide sustainable
   harvesting. This paper has the objective to review information on the
   species' geographic distribution, reproductive biology, genetic
   characteristics and existing conservation practices, and to identify
   knowledge gaps to orientate future conservation and research focus. The
   literature review revealed that the species is mainly outcrossed and is
   pollinated by a diversity of vectors, including bats that allow
   long-pollen dispersal. When bats are absent, pollination is mainly
   carried out by honey bees and stingless bees and in such case
   pollen-mediated gene flow is relatively restricted. Data of a
   large-scale genetic study based on allozyme markers showing a moderate
   genetic differentiation among populations were reanalyzed using an
   inverse distance weighted interpolation function. Three distinctive
   regions of diversity based on allelic richness and expected
   heterozygosity were identified. Finally, we discuss future challenges
   for genetic conservation by emphasizing the need to use both neutral and
   adaptive markers in future research.}},

   I investigated the pollination of P. juniperinum parasitizing Juniperus
   osteosperma trees in the Cerbat Mountains in western Arizona during
   June-July 2016. I examined pollen from male flowers, aspirated insects
   from female flowers, counted conspecific pollen grains on insects, and
   estimated floral constancy from proportions of conspecific pollen in
   pollen loads. The tricolpate pollen from P. juniperinum was subangular
   in shape with open furrows in polar view and oval-spherical in shape in
   equatorial view. Most insects on flowers were small (< 3 mm in length).
   Insects carrying conspecific pollen to female flowers included 6 species
   of Hymenoptera in 6 families and 6 species of Diptera in 5 genera and 4
   families. Conspecific pollen was found on 41\% of the insects, with only
   18\% carrying > 1 grain, and numbers of grains on insects did not differ
   among the species collected. Phoradendron juniperinum was most likely
   pollinated by 2 species of flies in Hippelates (Chloropidae) and
   Desmometopa (Milichiidae) and 1 species of parasitic wasp in Apanteles
   (Braconidae). Insects in these genera were widespread and frequently
   collected, with half of specimens carrying conspecific pollen that
   comprised most of the pollen load. Other Diptera carrying conspecific
   pollen included 1 species in Olcella (Chloropidae), 2 species in
   Mythicomyia (Mythicomyiidae), and 1 species in Scatopsidae. Other
   Hymenoptera with conspecific pollen included 1 species of bee in
   Lasioglossum (Halictidae), 1 species of wasp in Parancistrocerus
   (Vespidae), and 3 species of parasitic wasps in Chalcidoidea. Minute
   flies, such as Tephritidae or Chloropidae, are the most common
   pollinators among P. juniperinum and the 2 other examined species of
   Phoradendron (P. californicum and P. coryae). Pollination of
   Phoradendron likely differs among species due to different host plants,
   plant communities, and flowering seasons.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{We present a new county checklist developed from bee research in Maine
   since the 1800s. The list contains 278 bee species in 37 genera and 6
   families, of which all but 8 are native, with >= 50 taxa each in Andrena
   and Lasioglossum. Data for 16 counties from publications, museum
   collections, and recent surveys varied in number of species from 8
   (Androscoggin) to 197 (Hancock). Research since 1930 on Vaccinium
   angustifolium (Lowbush Blueberry) led to many records. Twenty-one
   species are considered unusual, including 3 first recorded in 2016:
   Epeoloides pilosulus, Melitta melittoides, and Holcopasites
   calliopsidis. Maine records provide evidence of declines in Bombus
   affinis, decline in B. terricola followed by partial recovery, and
   increase in B. impatiens. Crops that should be studied regarding
   associated bees are Malus pumila (Apple), Vaccinium corymbosum (Highbush
   Blueberry), Vaccinium macrocarpon (American Cranberry), and
   Curcurbitaceae (cucurbits). Montane, sandy, and island habitats were
   identified as priorities for future sampling. We discuss records of bee
   species from New England relevant to understanding the Maine fauna, bee
   diversity, changes in abundance, cleptoparasitism, pesticide impacts,
   habitat requirements, and climate change.}},

Title = {{A Natural History of Change in Native Bees Associated with Lowbush
   Blueberry in Maine}},
Journal = {{NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{49-68}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{More than 120 native bee species have been documented in Maine since
   1930 in association with the native plant Vaccinium angustifolium
   (Lowbush Blueberry). We report 3 studies in commercial Lowbush Blueberry
   fields: (1) a survey of diversity in Osmia (mason bees) and closely
   related Megachile (leaf-cutter bees) using trap nests in 93 fields from
   1990 to 2012, (2) a 29-year study of a native bee community, and (3) an
   examination of climate-change effects on bee-foraging periods during
   blueberry bloom. Osmia appeared to be more stable over a 22-year period
   in their species richness and relative abundances in Lowbush Blueberry
   fields when compared to Megachile over a similar 17-year period. The
   native bee community in a single location in Winterport was observed to
   fluctuate in abundance 2 to 3 times annually. Modeling of the total bee
   community and taxa-specific group abundances (Bombus, Megachilids,
   Andrenids, and Halictids and other bees) suggest that while stochastic
   density-independent processes such as weather can play a role in
   determining their annual oscillations, density-dependent lags of 1 and 2
   years appear to be the main driving forces. Estimation of fruit set over
   the same 29-year period, based upon native bee abundance, suggests that
   pollination is more buffered than community bee abundance, resulting in
   a lesser degree of fluctuation over time. We speculate that this finding
   is due to redundancy in floral preferences, multiple floral visitations,
   and differing pollination efficiencies by the highly diverse native bee
   community associated with Lowbush Blueberry. Effects of climate change
   in Maine Lowbush Blueberry fields during May bloom was investigated
   using a historic weather database. Since the early 1990s, precipitation
   has, to a large degree, reduced the number of optimal bee foraging days
   during bloom, with implications for pollination and bee species
   abundances. This new information reinforces the need for provision of
   pollinator gardens to support native pollinators of Lowbush Blueberry.}},

Title = {{Solving the puzzle of yeast survival in ephemeral nectar systems:
   exponential growth is not enough}},
Journal = {{FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Flower nectar is a sugar-rich ephemeral habitat for microorganisms.
   Nectar-borne yeasts are part of the microbial community and can affect
   pollination by changing nectar chemistry, attractiveness to pollinators
   or flower temperature if yeast population densities are high.
   Pollinators act as dispersal agents in this system; however, pollination
   events lead potentially to shrinking nectar yeast populations. We here
   examine how sufficiently high cell densities of nectar yeast can develop
   in a flower. In laboratory experiments, we determined the remaining
   fraction of nectar yeast cells after nectar removal, and used honeybees
   to determine the number of transmitted yeast cells from one flower to
   the next. The results of these experiments directly fed into a
   simulation model providing an insight into movement and colonization
   ecology of nectar yeasts. We found that cell densities only reached an
   ecologically relevant size for an intermediate pollination probability.
   Too few pollination events reduce yeast inoculation rate and too many
   reduce yeast population size strongly. In addition, nectar yeasts need a
   trait combination of at least an intermediate growth rate and an
   intermediate remaining fraction to compensate for highly frequent
   decimations. Our results can be used to predict nectar yeast dispersal,
   growth and consequently their ecological effects.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Certain pesticides are coming under scrutiny because of their impact on
   pollinator insects. Although most consumers express willingness to aid
   pollinators, the reasons for consumers' preferences or barriers to
   purchasing pollinator-friendly plants and the types of pollinators' that
   consumers are trying to protect are less understood. Using an online
   survey of 1200 Connecticut (CT) consumers, of which 841 had home
   landscapes, we find that 46\% of consumers with home landscapes
   purchased pollinator-friendly plants to attract pollinators to their
   landscape. Consistent with past research that focused on consumers'
   preferences for pollinator-friendly plants, the data also reveal that
   some consumers are willing to pay premiums for plants that contribute to
   pollinator's health. However, only 17\% stated that attracting
   pollinators was their primary motivation; a finding that suggests
   labeling alone will likely not motivate consumers to purchase plants.
   The major barriers to purchasing pollinator-friendly plants included
   lack of labeling (cited by 28\%), followed by high price (28\%).
   Consumers purchasing pollinator-friendly plants were trying to attract
   butterflies (Lepidoptera) (78\%), bees (Apidae) (59\%), hummingbirds
   (Trochilidae) (59\%), and other birds (41\%). We also find that
   demographics and purchasing behavior affect barriers and types of
   pollinators desired. Simply labeling plants has the potential to
   increase purchasing, but increasing price could be detrimental as many
   consumers feel pollinator-friendly plants are highly priced.
   Implications for ornamental horticulture stakeholders are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean scientists in China have tried to utilize heterosis for yield
   enhancement. A number of cytoplasmic-nuclear male-sterile (CMS) lines,
   their maintainers and restorers were developed, but the commercialized
   hybrid seed production is still a bottleneck. Five soybean CMS lines
   with their maintainers and restorers were studied for the sufficiency of
   viable and effective pollens from maintainers/restorers, the natural
   insect pollinators in fields and outcrossing capacity of CMS lines. The
   results showed that the maintainers/restorers may offer viable pollens
   during the flowering day time in Nanjing and Taiyuan (germination rate
   77.8-86.5\%). But the morning dew causes pollens losing effectiveness in
   Nanjing, while normal in Taiyuan, indicating the location and planting
   season without morning dew is a key for CMS/hybrid seed production. In
   CMS fields in Taiyuan, the major insect pollinators composed of China
   bee (54.3\%), Mellifera bee (11.3\%), Northern-cutting bee (6.0\%), Corn
   belt hair bee (1.5\%), etc. A parallel trend between insect number and
   flower nectar amount in a day with peak time at 12:00-13:00 implied the
   soybean nectar attracting the insects. The outcrossing pod-set rate of
   CMS lines in net-room with artificial-raised bees, net-room without bees
   and open-field with enhanced natural insects was 57.8, 2.1 and 47.3\%,
   respectively, indicating that insect pollination is necessary. The
   realized outcrossing pod-set rate in seed production field achieved
   88.9\% (1460.4 kg/ha) for SXJLCMS1A 9 SXJLCMS1B and 145.2\% (1829.5
   kg/ha) for SXCMS1A 9 JY-31, different outcrossing capacity existed among
   CMS lines. Thus the CMS/hybrid seed production can be improved through
   optimizing the pollen effectiveness, pollinator population and talented
   CMS line.}},

Abstract = {{The Single von Willebrand factor C-domain proteins (SVCs) are a group of
   short proteins mainly found in arthropods. They are proposed to be
   responsive in relation to environmental challenges including the
   nutritional status, bacterial and viral infections. The SVC protein Vago
   acts as a cross-talk molecule between the small interfering RNA (siRNA)
   pathway and the Jak/STAT pathway upon viral infection in Drosophila
   melanogaster and Culex mosquito cells. Unlike flies and mosquitoes that
   possess diverse SVCs, most bee species only have one of which the
   function remains unclear. Here we investigated whether this single SVC
   within the genome of the bumblebee Bombus terrestris is also involved in
   the host antiviral immunity and whether links with other immune pathways
   can be found. We can show the presence of two key characteristics of
   Vago linked with the single SVC in B. terrestris (BtSVC). The antiviral
   character is proven by silencing BtSVC, which lead to increased Israeli
   acute paralysis virus (IAPV) levels in the fat body. Second, the
   silencing of BtDicer-2 resulted in a lower expression of BtSVC and
   increased IAPV levels, confirming the link between Dicer-2 and BtSVC. We
   were, however, unable to demonstrate a third known role of Vago in the
   activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. This is probably because we lack
   good markers for this pathway in bumblebees. Interestingly, we found
   that BtSVC contributes to the basal expression levels of four
   antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-coding genes in the fat body of the
   bumblebees. Therefore, the single SVC gene in bumblebees may be involved
   in both host antiviral immunity and basal AMPs expression. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Based on current research the agglomerations are potentially desirable
   habitats for bumblebees. However, the relationship between the
   biodiversity of these bees and the green areas where they live is poorly
   understood. The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of green
   areas (ranging from 8 to 102 ha) of big cities on bumblebee species
   richness, composition, and the relative number of these insects. The
   studies were conducted within the administrative borders of the city of
   Wrocaw (Poland) in 2011-2012 in 12 green areas such as parks, cemeteries
   and other places with trees and shrubs. Species richness and abundance
   of bumblebees was determined by direct observation during 30 min. The
   gathered materials were used to calculate how areas of urban green space
   affected qualitative and quantitative bumblebee community structure. In
   total, 13 species of bumblebees (Bombus Latr.) were recorded, of which 3
   belonged to cuckoo bumblebees (Psithyrus subgenus). The share of the
   most similar groups was congregated in green areas not smaller than 30
   ha. This was proved by analysis of qualitative structure (Sorensen
   index), quantitative structure (Renkonen index), and
   qualitative-quantitative structure (Cody's index). The number of
   bumblebee species in the surveyed green areas (r = 0.7497) was decisive
   for the arrangement of the mutual similarity of group structure. Green
   urban areas should be created in a size of at least 30 ha. Such sites
   provide conditions for the most diversified bumblebee species
   communities. Sites smaller than 30 ha can play an important role as
   refuges, and allow migration to all pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Model-mimic plant systems are well known. However, the conditions
   promoting the existence of such systems are still an enigma. We suggest
   that by focusing on floral similarity between model and mimic, reward
   levels offered by models, and pollinators' ability to adjust foraging
   accordingly, the conditions can be better understood. Using
   spatially-explicit modelling, we examined trait combinations that lead
   to the survival of deceptive species under a large range of mimic
   strategies, from Batesian mimicry to general food deception. Unlike
   previous models studying such systems, we examined model-mimic
   interactions in the presence of a third, dissimilar species, thus
   generating a more realistic scenario where pollinators may avoid the
   model-mimic system altogether. Results showed that overall survival and
   abundance of species in food deceptive systems depend on the relative
   reward provided by the participating species and the potential
   alternatives available. Specifically, the success of a mimic in a
   Batesian mimicry system depends on high levels of reward provided by its
   model species relative to potential alternatives in the flower
   community. On the other hand, the success of a mimic in a general food
   deception system was higher when the reward offered was lower. Our study
   suggests that the ability of pollinators to utilize their experience as
   part of decision-making is highly relevant in promoting mimic survival,
   thus shedding light on the conditions under which food deception is
   expected.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generations (DGs) have been utilized in some electric power
   networks. Power loss reductions, voltage improvement, increasing
   reliability, postponement of system upgrading and environmental
   friendliness are some advantages of DG-unit applications. This paper
   presents a new optimization approach that employs a flower pollination
   algorithm (FPA) to determine the optimal DG-unit's size and location in
   order to minimize the total system real power loss and improve the
   system buses voltage. The FPA is a new metaheuristic optimization
   technique and it is inspired by the reproduction strategy of the flow
   pollination process of flowering plants. To reveal the validity of the
   FPA algorithm, IEEE 33-bus, 69-bus and 136-bus radial distribution test
   systems are examined with different test cases of the objective function
   using the MATLAB. Furthermore, the results obtained by the proposed FPA
   algorithm are compared with other metaheuristic optimization techniques
   such as backtracking search optimization algorithm, artificial bee
   colony, and selection algorithm. The outcomes verify that the FPA
   algorithm is efficient, robust, and capable of handling mixed integer

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Predacious syrphid fly species, also known as flower flies or hover
   flies, are cosmopolitan diptera that play two important ecological
   roles: predator and pollinator. In decades past, syrphid flies were
   studied by agricultural researchers due to their larvae's ability to
   function as a biological control agent. In recent years, the global
   decline in both honey bees and various important wild bee species has
   led ecological researchers to investigate the role of syrphid fly
   pollination in both natural systems and agriculture. While these two
   roles have often been considered separately, they are rarely considered
   together in single studies. Syrphid fly population fluctuations in
   natural and agricultural systems are understudied, prompting calls for
   further study into the fundamental drivers of population dynamics of
   syrphid communities. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the
   fundamental dynamics of syrphid ecology, the present study offers a
   community model where both syrphid predation and pollination are
   incorporated into a single dynamic model. Using populations of
   predacious syrphid flies, herbivorous insects, and a shared resource
   flowering plant, the model is used to investigate community dynamics and
   persistence across different levels of plant reproductive dependence on
   syrphid pollination. Results indicate distinct levels of community
   viability across different pollination relationships as well as a
   tendency toward chaotic dynamics inherent to the trophic interactions of
   the community.}},

Abstract = {{Although heterostyly frequently occurs in Rubiaceae, there are cases of
   distylous species with populations that have variations in their
   reproductive systems. For example, in the typically distylous genus
   Palicourea, P. crocea showed a pin-monomorphism. Considering this, the
   questions addressed in the present study were: (1) Are there other
   pin-monomorphic Palicourea crocea populations? (2) How important are
   flower visitors to the pollination of this species? (3) What is the
   compatibility system in P. crocea? In addition, we tested the hypothesis
   that P. crocea is self-compatible and autogamous that can be a result of
   a variation in the distylous pattern. To answer the questions, we
   verified the position of anthers and stigmas in flowers of other
   populations of Palicourea crocea using voucher specimens. Furthermore,
   we made focal observations to analyze the role of flower visitors and we
   made field experiments to verify the compatibility system in P. crocea.
   Among seven flower visitors species observed-four bees, one wasp, one
   butterfly and one hummingbird-the latter was considered the main
   pollinator due to its high frequency of visits at all times analyzed.
   However, the small size of the population in the study area, the
   territorial behavior of hummingbirds, and the activity of nectar robbers
   may contribute to a low pollen flow. In this situation, traits as
   self-compatibility and autogamy observed in Palicourea crocea are
   beneficial, since they maintain species fertility. This could represent
   a new evolutionary path for the reproduction of this population,
   different from that of P. crocea populations that display distinct
   floral morphs.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of Vespa crabro L. queen were found to be infected by deformed
   wing virus (DWV). The abdomen and the thorax of asymptomatic and
   symptomatic wasps were positive for the virus by strand specific RT-PCR,
   indicating active replication. This finding confirms the ability of the
   virus to infect not only bees (Apoidea) but also wasps (Vespoidea)
   suggesting a possible transmission route by ingestion of infected honey
   bees by wasp's larva. This is the first report concerning the detection
   of DWV in V. crabro. In the view of this finding the possibility of
   using naturally infected bees as a tool for the biological control of
   its predators is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea, Apiformes) are taxonomically and
   ecologically diverse, with a wide range of social complexity, nesting
   preferences, floral associations, and biogeographic restrictions. A
   Canadian bee checklist, greatly assisted by the gene-assisted approach
   of DNA barcoding, is nearing completion. Previous evaluation of bee
   diversity in Canada, assisted by DNA barcoding, was restricted to Nova
   Scotia, which contains about 25\% of the bee species in the country.
   Here, we summarise efforts to date to build a comprehensive DNA barcode
   library supporting bee taxonomic studies in Canada, consisting of more
   than 12 500 barcode-compliant sequences yielding 811 distinct barcode
   index numbers (BINs). This appears to represent similar to 95\% of the
   856 bee species presently recorded from Canada, but comparison with
   known morphological species in each genus shows that some genera are
   still under-sampled or may contain cryptic taxa, with much taxonomic
   work still to be done on bees in Canada. This is particularly true
   within the taxonomically difficult genera Andrena Fabricius
   (Andrenidae), Hylaeus Fabricius (Colletidae), Melissodes Latreille
   (Apidae), Nomada Scopoli (Apidae), Osmia Panzer (Megachilidae), and
   Sphecodes Latreille (Halictidae). DNA analysis will likely be a key
   asset in resolving bee taxonomic issues in Canada in the future, and to
   date has even assisted studies of well-known bee taxa. Here we present
   summaries of our results, and discuss the use of DNA barcoding to assist
   future taxonomic work, faunal lists, and ecological studies.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Exotic species often cause severe alterations in native communities due
   to their ability to rapidly and efficiently utilize a broad spectrum of
   resources. In flower-visitor interactions, the breadth of resource use
   by native and exotic animals as well as the partitioning of resources
   among them is often estimated based on the number of (shared) plant
   species used as resources. However, whether a flower visitor is able to
   exploit plant resources has been shown to be delimited by functional
   floral traits such as morphological barriers or attractive or repellent
   chemical cues. Each of the ecologically relevant traits can be viewed as
   a dimension of a Hutchinsonian n-dimensional hypervolume, which
   characterizes the range of phenotypes exploitable by a species. In this
   study, we quantified the sizes and overlaps of n-dimensional
   hypervolumes defined by floral traits that are exploited by native and
   exotic flower visitors (afterwards referred to as exploited space, ES).
   In the heavily invaded Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, USA, we
   phenotyped 40 native and exotic plant species and recorded
   flower-visitor interactions. To quantify the size and overlap of ES, we
   applied dynamic range boxes. On average, exotic flower visitors were
   more generalized in resource use (larger ES) than natives ones, which is
   additionally indicated by the absence of native flower visitors on
   exotic flowering plant species. In particular, ES based on floral scent
   emission was larger for exotic flower visitors compared to native ones.
   The unevenly expanded ES of native and exotic animals led to an
   asymmetric overlap of floral ES where exotic flower visitors shared only
   a small proportion of their ES with natives but occupied a large
   proportion of the ES of natives. The asymmetry in resource use of native
   and exotic flower visitors suggests a potential advantage in resource
   exploitation of the latter, potentially explaining their success in
   Hawaiian ecosystems. Predicted range expansion of exotic plant and
   animal species may further increase the competition for and reduce the
   availability of resources for native animals. This may lead to further
   declines of native species and increasing threats for Hawaiian
   ecosystems.

Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wildflower strip plantings in intensive agricultural systems have become
   a widespread tool for promoting pollination services and biological
   conservation because of their use by wasps and bees. Many of the
   trap-nesting wasps are important predators of common crop pests, and
   cavity-nesting bees that utilize trap-nests are important pollinators
   for native plants and many crops. The impact of wildflower strips on the
   nesting frequency of trap-nesting wasps or bees within localized areas
   has not been thoroughly investigated. Trap-nests made of bamboo reeds
   (Bambusa sp.) were placed adjacent to eight 0.1 ha wildflower plots and
   paired fallow areas (control plots) to determine if wildflower strips
   encourage the nesting of wasps and bees. From August 2014 to November
   2015, occupied reeds were gathered and adults were collected as they
   emerged from the trap-nests. Treatment (wildflower or fallow plots) did
   not impact the number of occupied reeds or species richness of
   trap-nesting wasps using the occupied reeds. The wasps Pachodynerus
   erynnis, Euodynerus megaera, Parancistrocerus pedestris, and Isodontia
   spp. were the most common trap-nesting species collected. Less than 2\%
   of the occupied reeds contained bees, and all were from the genus
   Megachile. The nesting wasp and bee species demonstrated preferences for
   reeds with certain inside diameters (IDs). The narrow range of ID
   preferences exhibited by each bee/wasp may provide opportunities to take
   advantage of their natural histories for biological control and/or
   pollination purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Faced with the decline of pollinators, it is relevant to strengthen our
   understanding of the whole plant-pollinator web in semi-natural
   grasslands that serve as refuges for pollinator populations. The aim of
   this study was to explore the diversity of flower-foraging insects
   involved in pollen transfer in mountain semi-natural grasslands. Insects
   actively collecting pollen and/or nectar were caught in spring in six
   mountain semi-natural grasslands displaying a floristic richness
   gradient. Individual determinations of insects were made at the finest
   possible taxonomic scale and pollen loads were removed from the insect
   body. Using next-generation DNA sequencing, pollens were identified
   through the ribosomal DNA cistron using the ITS2 database and the ITS
   plant rDNA cistron sequences from Genbank. A total of 236
   flower-foraging insects were collected. Diptera represented 82\% of the
   total catches distantly followed by Hymenoptera (15\%) and Apoidea
   (bees) (11\%). Visual observations revealed that Diptera foraged on 16
   of the 21 flower species visited by insects. DNA metabarcoding showed
   that 82\% (191) of all of the collected insects were carrying pollen and
   44\% (104) were carrying two genera of plants or more. Our results
   demonstrate that Diptera are potential key-pollinators in mountain
   semi-natural grasslands that cannot be overlooked by the scientific
   community. However difficulties of taxonomic determination due to severe
   shortage of experts for Diptera have to be urgently overcome. Further
   studies on the link between pollen transfer and actual pollination in a
   global change context are also required. Moreover, our results support
   the idea that DNA metabarcoding provides accurate information about the
   plants-insects networks but it also pointed out sensitive issues,
   especially the necessity to build reliable national barcode databases.}},

Abstract = {{The role of urban expansion on bee diversity is poorly understood, but
   it may play an important role in restructuring pollinator diversity
   observed in rural regions at the urban perimeter. We studied bee
   communities in two habitats essential for pollinators (residential
   gardens and semi-natural areas) at 42 sites situated at the edge of
   greater Montreal, Canada. Bee species richness, abundance and functional
   diversity all increased with urbanization in both habitat types, but
   gardens and semi-natural areas supported distinct bee communities with
   unique responses to urbanization in terms of species turnover. Compared
   to semi-natural sites, residential gardens supported bees that foraged
   from a greater number but a lower proportion of available plant species.
   Bees did not discriminate between exotic and indigenous plant species in
   either gardens or semi-natural sites and were attracted to flowers in
   either habitat irrespective of their origins. Protecting semi-natural
   ruderal areas and providing residential garden habitats for pollinators
   are both effective means of promoting regional bee diversity in
   urbanizing regions.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change can influence consumer populations both directly, by
   affecting survival and reproduction, and indirectly, by altering
   resources. However, little is known about the relative importance of
   direct and indirect effects, particularly for species important to
   ecosystem functioning, like pollinators. We used structural equation
   modelling to test the importance of direct and indirect (via floral
   resources) climate effects on the interannual abundance of three
   subalpine bumble bee species. In addition, we used long-term data to
   examine how climate and floral resources have changed over time. Over 8
   years, bee abundances were driven primarily by the indirect effects of
   climate on the temporal distribution of floral resources. Over 43 years,
   aspects of floral phenology changed in ways that indicate
   species-specific effects on bees. Our study suggests that climate-driven
   alterations in floral resource phenology can play a critical role in
   governing bee population responses to global change.}},

Title = {{Sweat bees on hot chillies: provision of pollination services by native
   bees in traditional slash-and-burn agriculture in the Yucatan Peninsula
   of tropical Mexico}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1814-1824}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Traditional tropical agriculture often entails a form of
   slash-and-burn land management that may adversely affect ecosystem
   services such as pollination, which are required for successful crop
   yields. The Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico has a >4000year history of
   traditional slash-and-burn agriculture, termed milpa'. Hot Habanero'
   chilli is a major pollinator-dependent crop that nowadays is often grown
   in monoculture within the milpa system.
   2. We studied 37 local farmers' chilli fields (sites) to evaluate the
   effects of landscape composition on bee communities. At 11 of these
   sites, we undertook experimental pollination treatments to quantify the
   pollination of chilli. We further explored the relationships between
   landscape composition, bee communities and pollination service provision
   to chilli.
   3. Bee species richness, particularly species of the family Apidae, was
   positively related to the amount of forest cover. Species diversity
   decreased with increasing proportion of crop land surrounding each
   sampling site. Sweat bees of the genus Lasioglossum were the most
   abundant bee taxon in chilli fields and, in contrast to other bee
   species, increased in abundance with the proportion of fallow land,
   gardens and pastures which are an integral part of the milpa system.
   4. There was an average pollination shortfall of 21\% for chilli across
   all sites; yet the shortfall was unrelated to the proportion of land
   covered by crops. Rather, chilli pollination was positively related to
   the abundance of Lasioglossum bees, probably an important pollinator of
   chilli, as well indirectly to the proportion of fallow land, gardens and
   pastures that promote Lasioglossum abundance.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Current, low-intensity traditional
   slash-and-burn (milpa) agriculture provides Lasioglossum spp.
   pollinators for successful chilli production; fallow land, gardens and
   pasture therefore need to be valued as important habitats for these and
   related ground-nesting bee species. However, the negative impact of
   agriculture on total bee species diversity highlights how agricultural
   intensification is likely to reduce pollination services to crops,
   including chilli. Indeed, natural forest cover is vital in tropical
   Yucatan to maintain a rich assemblage of bee species and the provision
   of pollination services for diverse crops and wild flowers.}},

Title = {{Enhancing plant diversity in agricultural landscapes promotes both rare
   bees and dominant crop-pollinating bees through complementary increase
   in key floral resources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1856-1864}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Enhancing key floral resources is essential to effectively mitigate
   the loss of pollinator diversity and associated provisioning of
   pollination functions in agro-ecosystems. However, effective floral
   provisioning measures may diverge among different pollinator
   conservation targets, such as the conservation of rare species or the
   promotion of economically important crop pollinators. We examined to
   what extent such diverging conservation goals could be reconciled.
   2. We analysed plant-bee visitation networks of 64 herbaceous
   semi-natural habitats representing a gradient of plant species richness
   to identify key resource plants of the three distinct conservation
   target groups: rare bees (of conservation concern), dominant wild
   crop-pollinating bees and managed crop-pollinating bees (i.e.
   honeybees).
   3. Considering overall flower visitation, rare bees tended to visit
   nested subsets of plant species that were also visited by crop
   pollinators (46\% and 77\% nestedness in the dissimilarity between rare
   bees and wild crop pollinators or managed honeybees respectively).
   However, the set of preferred plant species, henceforth key plant
   species' (i.e. those species disproportionately more visited than
   expected according to their floral abundance) was considerably more
   distinct and less nested among bee target groups.
   4. Flower visits of all bee target groups increased with plant species
   richness at a similar rate. Importantly, our analyses revealed that an
   exponential increase in the flower abundance of the identified key plant
   species and complementarity in the bee visitation pattern across plant
   species - rather than total flower abundance - were the major drivers of
   these relationships.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the multiple goals of
   preserving high bee diversity, conserving rare species and sustaining
   crop pollinators can be reconciled if key plant species of different
   target groups are simultaneously available. This availability is
   facilitated by a high floral resource complementarity in the plant
   community. The list of identified key resource plant species we provide
   here can help practitioners such as land managers and conservationists
   to better design and evaluate pollinator conservation and restoration
   measures according to their goals. Our findings highlight the importance
   of identifying and promoting such plant species for pollinator
   conservation in agricultural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Harvesting biofuel grasslands has mixed effects on natural enemy
   communities and no effects on biocontrol services}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2011-2021}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Perennial bioenergy systems, such as switchgrass and restored
   prairies, are alternatives to commonly used annual monocultures such as
   maize. Perennial systems require lower chemical input, provide greater
   ecosystem services such as carbon storage, greenhouse gas mitigation and
   support greater biodiversity of beneficial insects. However, biomass
   harvest will be necessary in managing these perennial systems for
   bioenergy production, and it is unclear how repeated harvesting might
   affect ecosystem services.
   2. In this study, we examined how repeated production-scale harvesting
   of diverse perennial grasslands influences vegetation structure, natural
   enemy communities (arthropod predators and parasitoids), and natural
   biocontrol services in two states (Wisconsin and Michigan, USA) over
   multiple years.
   3. We found that repeated biomass harvest reduced litter biomass and
   increased bare ground cover. Some natural enemy groups, such as
   ground-dwelling arthropods, decreased in abundance with harvest, whereas
   others such as foliar-dwelling arthropods increased in abundance. The
   disparity in responses is likely due to how different taxonomic groups
   utilize vegetation and differences in dispersal abilities.
   4. At the community level, biomass harvest altered community
   composition, increased total arthropod abundance and decreased evenness
   but did not influence species richness, diversity or biocontrol
   services. Harvest effects varied with time, diminishing in strength both
   within the season (for total abundance and evenness), across seasons
   (for evenness) or were consistent throughout the duration of the study
   (for community composition). Greater functional redundancy and
   compensatory responses of the different taxonomic groups may have
   buffered against the potentially negative effects of harvest on
   biocontrol services.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that in the short-term,
   repeated harvesting of perennial grasslands (when insect activity is
   low) consistently altered vegetation structure but had mixed effects on
   natural enemy communities and no discernible effects on biocontrol
   services. However, the long-term effects of repeated harvesting on
   vegetation structure, natural enemies and other arthropod-derived
   ecosystem services such as pollination and decomposition remain largely
   unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services provided by agricultural ecosystems include natural
   pest control and pollination, and these are important to ensure crop
   productivity. This study investigates the use of the banker plant
   Calendula officinalis L. to provide multiple ecosystem services by
   increasing the abundance of natural enemies for biological control of
   tomato pests, providing forage resources to wild bees, and improving
   crop yield. C. officinalis was selected for this experiment as it is
   used as a banker plant for Dicyphini (Hemiptera: Miridae) predators.
   Strips of flowering C. officinalis were established in the field edges
   of tomato fields and arthropod visitation to C. officinalis strips and
   tomato was measured. Crop damage from multiple pests of tomato was
   assessed in fields with C. officinalis strips and control sites. The
   contribution of pollination to crop yield was assessed through a
   pollinator exclusion experiment. The inclusion of C. officinalis in
   tomato fields was associated with increased abundance of Dicyphini,
   parasitoids, bees and other arthropod groups within these strips. A
   reduction in the total leaf crop damage from Lepidoptera pests was
   recorded in fields with C. officinalis strips. Increased fruit set and
   biomass were recorded in open-pollinated tomato but this was not
   significantly different between control and C. officinalis fields.
   Results presented here demonstrate that the inclusion of a companion
   plant can improve the conservation of beneficial arthropods and the
   delivery of agroecosystem services but efficacy is likely to be improved
   with the addition of plants, with different functional traits, and with
   improved attractiveness to crop pollinators.}},

   local plant species, which may translate into alterations at higher
   tropic levels, such as arthropods. Due to the diverse functional roles
   of arthropods in the ecosystems, it is critical to understand how
   arthropod communities are affected by plant invasions. Here, we
   investigated the impact of the invasive ornamental herb Lupinus
   polyphyllus (Lindl.) on arthropod communities during its main flowering
   period in southwestern Finland over two years. The total number of
   arthropods was about 46\% smaller at the invaded sites than at the
   uninvaded sites in both study years, and this difference was mainly due
   to a lower abundance of beetles, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and ants.
   However, the number of bumblebees (particularly Bombus lucorum) was
   about twice as high at invaded sites compared with uninvaded sites, even
   though bumblebee richness did not differ between sites. There was no
   statistically significant difference between invaded and uninvaded sites
   in the abundances of the other arthropod groups considered (Hymenoptera
   (excluding bumblebees and ants), Hemiptera, and Arachnida). In addition,
   L. polyphyllus affected the relative abundance of four arthropod groups,
   with the order Lepidoptera being less common at invaded sites than at
   uninvaded sites, while the opposite was true for bumblebees, Hemiptera,
   and Arachnida. Overall, these results demonstrate that the negative
   impact of L. polyphyllus on biodiversity goes beyond its own trophic
   level, suggesting that this species has the potential to alter the
   abundance of different arthropod groups and, consequently, the structure
   of arthropod communities at a large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Agricultural intensification and urbanization are important drivers
   of biodiversity change in Europe. Different aspects of bee community
   diversity vary in their sensitivity to these pressures, as well as
   independently influencing ecosystem service provision (pollination). To
   obtain a more comprehensive understanding of human impacts on bee
   diversity across Europe, we assess multiple, complementary indices of
   diversity.
   Location: One Thousand four hundred and forty six sites across Europe.
   Methods: We collated data on bee occurrence and abundance from the
   published literature and supplemented them with the PREDICTS database.
   Using Rao's Quadratic Entropy, we assessed how species, functional and
   phylogenetic diversity of 1,446 bee communities respond to land-use
   characteristics including land-use class, cropland intensity, human
   population density and distance to roads. We combined these models with
   statistically downscaled estimates of land use in 2005 to estimate and
   mapat a scale of approximately 1km(2)-the losses in diversity relative
   to semi-natural/natural baseline (the predicted diversity of an
   uninhabited grid square, consisting only of semi-natural/natural
   vegetation).
   Results: We show that-relative to the predicted local diversity in
   uninhabited semi-natural/natural habitat-half of all EU27 countries have
   lost over 10\% of their average local species diversity and two-thirds
   of countries have lost over 5\% of their average local functional and
   phylogenetic diversity. All diversity measures were generally lower in
   pasture and higher-intensity cropland than in semi-natural/natural
   vegetation, but facets of diversity showed less consistent responses to
   human population density. These differences have led to marked spatial
   mismatches in losses: losses in phylogenetic diversity were in some
   areas almost 20 percentage points (pp.) more severe than losses in
   species diversity, but in other areas losses were almost 40pp. less
   severe.
   Main conclusions: These results highlight the importance of exploring
   multiple measures of diversity when prioritizing and evaluating
   conservation actions, as species-diverse assemblages may be
   phylogenetically and functionally impoverished, potentially threatening
   pollination service provision.}},

Abstract = {{Farms can harbor substantial biodiversity, which in turn sustains the
   supply of ecosystem services. The effectiveness of farm management to
   enhance biodiversity, however, may be modified by land cover in the
   surrounding landscape beyond a farmer's direct control. We examined how
   landscape pattern and farm management affect the abundance and diversity
   of native bees visiting highbush blueberry in Vermont, USA. We
   quantified landscape pattern at multiple scales and created an
   agricultural intensity index that represents farm management practices
   such as pesticide use, mowed and grain crop area. We observed native bee
   visitation to assess the supply of pollination service provided to
   blueberry growers. Across 15 farms, 84 wild bee species were observed
   visiting highbush blueberry, almost a third of bee species recorded in
   Vermont. Visitation rate, abundance and species richness increased with
   the amount of natural area surrounding farms. Less intensively managed
   farms had higher levels of bee visitation, abundance and a more diverse
   bee community. Bee communities and the pollination services they provide
   are influenced by interactions between local management and landscape
   pattern. In particular, intensive farm management appears to compound
   the negative effects of landscape simplification. To support native
   pollinators on their farms, growers should consider farming approaches
   in the context of the broader landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Floral displays are often composed of areas of contrasting stimuli which
   flower visitors use as guides, increasing both foraging efficiency and
   the likelihood of pollen transfer. Many aspects of how these displays
   benefit foraging efficiency are still unexplored, particularly those
   surrounding multimodal signals and the spatial arrangement of the
   display components. We compare the nectar discovery times of forager
   bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) when presented with artificial flowers
   with unimodal or compound displays of visual and/or olfactory stimuli,
   positioned in either radiating or non-radiating arrangements. We found
   that the addition of individual display components from either modality
   reduces nectar discovery time but there was no time benefit to bimodal
   displays over unimodal displays or any benefit to radiating stimuli
   arrangements over non-radiating arrangements. However, preference tests
   revealed a time advantage to radiating unimodal visual patterns over
   non-radiating unimodal visual patterns when both types were displayed
   simultaneously. These results suggest that the benefits of multimodal
   stimuli arrangements to pollinators are unrelated to benefits in nectar
   discovery time. Our results also suggest that spatial patterns of scent
   can be used as nectar guides and can reduce nectar discovery times
   without the aid of visual stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{Floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play important roles in
   plant-pollinator interactions. We investigated the reproductive ecology
   and floral VOCs of Zygopetalinae orchids to understand the relationship
   between floral scents and pollinators. We performed focal observations,
   phenological censuses and breeding system experiments in eight species
   in southeast Brazil. Floral scents were collected and analysed using
   SPME/GC-MS. We performed multivariate analyses to group species
   according to affinities of their VOCs and define compounds associated to
   each plant. Dichaea cogniauxiana was pollinated by weevils which use
   their developing ovules, while D. pendula was pollinated by the same
   weevils and perfume-collecting male euglossine bees. The other species
   were deceit-pollinated by bees. Zygopetalum crinitum was pollinated by
   carpenter bees, while W. warreana, Z. mackayi and Z. maxillare were
   bumblebee-pollinated. The latter was also pollinated by Centris confusa.
   Breeding system varied widely with no association to any pollinator
   group. Most VOCs are common to other floral scents. Zygopetalum crinitum
   presented an exclusive blend of VOCs, mainly composed of benzenoids. The
   scents of Pabstia jugosa, Promenaea xanthina and the Zygopetalum spp.
   were similar. The bumblebee-pollinated species have flowering periods
   partially overlapped, thus neither phenology nor pollinators constitute
   hybridization barriers among these species. Euglossines are not the only
   pollinators of Zygopetalinae. Different VOCs, size and lifespan of
   flowers are associated with distinct pollinators. A distinctive VOC
   bouquet may determine specialisation in carpenter bees or male
   euglossines within bee-pollinated flowers. Finally, visitation of
   deceit-pollinated flowers by perfume-collecting euglossines allows us to
   hypothesise how pollination by this group of bees had evolved.}},

Abstract = {{Animal pollination mediates both reproduction and gene flow for the
   majority of plant species across the globe. However, past functional
   studies have focused largely on seed production; although useful, this
   focus on seed set does not provide information regarding
   species-specific contributions to pollen-mediated gene flow. Here we
   quantify pollen dispersal for individual pollinator species across more
   than 690 ha of tropical forest. Specifically, we examine visitation,
   seed production, and pollen-dispersal ability for the entire pollinator
   community of a common tropical tree using a series of individual-based
   pollinator-exclusion experiments followed by molecular-based fractional
   paternity analyses. We investigate the effects of pollinator body size,
   plant size (as a proxy of floral display), local plant density, and
   local plant kinship on seed production and pollen-dispersal distance.
   Our results show that while large-bodied pollinators set more seeds per
   visit, small-bodied bees visited flowers more frequently and were
   responsible for more than 49\% of all long-distance (beyond 1 km)
   pollen-dispersal events. Thus, despite their size, small-bodied bees
   play a critical role in facilitating long-distance pollen-mediated gene
   flow. We also found that both plant size and local plant kinship
   negatively impact pollen dispersal and seed production. By incorporating
   genetic and trait-based data into the quantification of pollination
   services, we highlight the diversity in ecological function mediated by
   pollinators, the influential role that plant and population attributes
   play in driving service provision, and the unexpected importance of
   small-bodied pollinators in the recruitment of plant genetic diversity.}},

   case study with two invasive species and a generalist bumble bee}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{It is now well established that invasive plants may induce drifts in the
   quantity and/or quality of floral resources. They are then often pointed
   out as a potential driver of bee decline. However, their impact on bee
   population remains quite unclear and still controversial, as bee
   responses are highly variable among species. Here, we compared the amino
   acid composition of pollen from three native and two invasive plant
   species included in diets of common pollinators in NW Europe. Moreover,
   the nutritional intake (i.e., pollen and amino acid intakes) of Bombus
   terrestris colonies and the pollen foraging behaviour of workers (i.e.,
   visiting rate, number of foraging trips, weight of pollen loads) were
   considered. We found significant differences in pollen nutrients among
   the studied species according to the plant invasive behaviour. We also
   found significant differences in pollen foraging behaviour according to
   the plant species, from few to several foraging trips carrying small or
   large pollen loads. Such behavioural differences directly impacted the
   pollen intake but depended more likely on plant morphology rather than
   on plant invasive behaviour. These results suggest that common
   generalist bumble bees might not always suffer from plant invasions,
   depending on their behavioural plasticity and nutritional requirements.}},

Title = {{The bees of Michigan (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Anthophila), with notes on

Volume = {{4352}},

Abstract = {{The state of Michigan occupies an area between the Great Plains and the
   northeastern United States, bordering four Great Lakes, with diverse
   biogeographical regions. Michigan also has the second most diverse
   agriculture in the country, with many crops that depend on bees for
   pollination. This unique combination provides a wide range of
   opportunities for bees to persist, yet there is no current published
   checklist of these important insects. This study was conducted to
   provide the first annotated checklist of the bee (Apoidea: Anthophila)
   fauna of Michigan, summarizing aspects of their taxonomy and behavior
   and to provide provisional conservation assessment. The list was
   compiled from a critical review of published literature, museum
   specimens, and database records, supplemented by new collections. In
   total, 465 species are included in the checklist, including 38 new
   records, however evidence for 13 species is poor, several more species
   require taxonomic revision, and the presence of additional species is
   expected. The exotic megachilid species Megachile apicalis Spinola, M.
   pusilla Perez (=concinna Smith, auct.) and Osmia taurus Smith are
   reported from Michigan for the first time. New state records of native
   species include Anthidium tenuiflorae Cockerell and Nomada alpha alpha
   Cockerell, both previously undocumented from eastern North America, and
   Nomada sphaerogaster Cockerell, which has rarely been recognized. The
   taxonomy of some bee species is clarified by the formal publication of
   11 new synonymies (some previously reported online or in manuscripts).
   The following list cites junior synonyms first followed by the valid
   name: Andrena chippewaensis Mitchell 1960 = A. (Simandrena) wheeleri
   Graenicher 1904; Osmia hendersoni Cockerell 1907 = O. (Melanosmia)
   tarsata Provancher 1888; Osmia michiganensis Mitchell 1962 = O. (M.)
   subarctica Cockerell 1912 (new status, removed from synonymy with O.
   (M.) tersula Cockerell 1912); Sphecodes persimilis Lovell and Cockerell
   1907 = S. davisii Robertson 1897; Sphecodes knetschi Cockerell 1898 = S.
   dichrous Smith 1853; Sphecodes carolinus Mitchell 1956 = S. coronus
   Mitchell 1956; Sphecodes stygius Robertson 1893 = S. mandibularis
   Cresson 1872; Sphecodes prostygius Mitchell 1960 = S. fattigi Mitchell
   1956; Stelis vernalis Mitchell 1962 = S. coarctatus Crawford 1916; and
   Stelis michiganensis Mitchell 1962 = S. foederalis Smith 1854. Poorly
   known Andrena (Cnemidandrena) are discussed, including A. parnassiae
   Cockerell, a new state record, A. robervalensis Mitchell, and the
   extralimital A. runcinatae Cockerell. Of these, only A. robervalensis
   was considered in the subgeneric revision, but we recognize all three as
   valid species pending further study. Nomada binotata (Robertson 1903)
   and N. quadrimaculata (Robertson 1903) are removed from synonymy with N.
   ovata (Robertson 1903), based on examination of the lectotypes. A new
   species, Triepeolus eliseae Rightmyer, the eastern representative of the
   verbesinae species group, is described. A putative undescribed species,
   Osmia aff. trevoris, is documented, but requires additional study for
   its status to be fully resolved. A rich bee fauna is documented that
   includes geographically-restricted species, rare and
   regionally-declining species, and economically-important species,
   providing information for ongoing conservation planning and future
   analysis of trends in bee populations.}},

   parameters}},
Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{157}},
Pages = {{116-124}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The nonlinear current vs voltage (I-V) characteristics of solar PV make
   its modelling difficult. Optimization techniques are the best tool for
   identifying the parameters of nonlinear models. Even though, there are
   different optimization techniques used for parameter estimation of solar
   PV, still the best optimized results are not achieved to date. In this
   paper, Wind Driven Optimization (WDO) technique is proposed as the new
   method for identifying the parameters of solar PV. The accuracy and
   convergence time of the proposed method is compared with results of
   Pattern Search (PS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Simulated Annealing
   (SA) for single diode and double diode models of solar PV. Furthermore,
   for performance validation, the parameters obtained through WDO are
   compared with hybrid Bee Pollinator Flower Pollination Algorithm
   (BPFPA), Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA), Generalized Oppositional
   Teaching Learning Based Optimization (GOTLBO), Artificial Bee Swarm
   Optimization (ABSO), and Harmony Search (HS). The obtained results
   clearly reveal that WDO algorithm can provide accurate optimized values
   with less number of iterations at different environmental conditions.
   Therefore, the WDO can be recommended as the best optimization algorithm
   for parameter estimation of solar PV. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Neonicotinoid pesticide limits improvement in buzz pollination by
   bumblebees}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid pesticides have been linked to global declines of
   beneficial insects such as bumblebees. Exposure to trace levels of these
   chemicals causes sub-lethal effects, such as reduced learning and
   foraging efficiency. Complex behaviours may be particularly vulnerable
   to the neurotoxic effects of neonicotinoids. Such behaviours may include
   buzz pollination (sonication), in which pollinators, usually bees, use
   innate and learned behaviours to generate high-frequency vibrations to
   release pollen from flowers with specialised anther morphologies. This
   study assesses the effect of field-realistic, chronic exposure to the
   widely-used neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on the development of sonication
   buzz characteristics over time, as well as the collection of pollen from
   buzz-pollinated flowers. We found that the pollen collection of exposed
   bees improved less with increasing experience than that of unexposed
   bees, with exposed bees collecting between 47\% and 56\% less pollen by
   the end of 10 trials. We also found evidence of two distinct strategies
   for maximising pollen collection: (1) extensions to the duration of
   individual buzzes and (2) extensions of the overall time spent buzzing.
   We find new complexities in buzz pollination, and conclude that the
   impacts of field-realistic exposure to a neonicotinoid pesticide may
   seriously compromise this important ecosystem service.}},

Title = {{A common neonicotinoid pesticide, thiamethoxam, alters honey bee
   activity, motor functions, and movement to light}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Honey bees provide key ecosystem services. To pollinate and to sustain
   the colony, workers must walk, climb, and use phototaxis as they move
   inside and outside the nest. Phototaxis, orientation to light, is linked
   to sucrose responsiveness and the transition of work from inside to
   outside the nest, and is also a key component of division of labour.
   However, the sublethal effects of pesticides on locomotion and movement
   to light are relatively poorly understood. Thiamethoxam (TMX) is a
   common neonicotinoid pesticide that bees can consume in nectar and
   pollen. We used a vertical arena illuminated from the top to test the
   effects of acute and chronic sublethal exposures to TMX. Acute
   consumption (1.34 ng/bee) impaired locomotion, caused hyperactivity
   (velocity: +109\%; time moving: +44\%) shortly after exposure (30 min),
   and impaired motor functions (falls: +83\%; time top: -43\%; time
   bottom: +93\%; abnormal behaviours: +138\%; inability to ascend: +280\%)
   over a longer period (60 min). A 2-day chronic exposure (field-relevant
   daily intakes of 1.42-3.48 ng/bee/day) impaired bee ability to ascend.
   TMX increased movement to light after acute and chronic exposure. Thus,
   TMX could reduce colony health by harming worker locomotion and,
   potentially, alter division of labour if bees move outside or remain
   outdoors.}},

Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3059-3072}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Life-history transitions require major reprogramming at the behavioral
   and physiological level. Mating and reproductive maturation are known to
   trigger changes in gene transcription in reproductive tissues in a wide
   range of organisms, but we understand little about the molecular
   consequences of a failure to mate or become reproductively mature, and
   it is not clear to what extent these processes trigger neural as well as
   physiological changes. In this study, we examined the molecular
   processes underpinning the behavioral changes that accompany the major
   life-history transitions in a key pollinator, the bumblebee Bombus
   terrestris. We compared neuro-transcription in queens that succeeded or
   failed in switching from virgin and immature states, to mated and
   reproductively mature states. Both successes and failures were
   associated with distinct molecular profiles, illustrating how
   development during adulthood triggers distinct molecular profiles within
   a single caste of a eusocial insect. Failures in both mating and
   reproductive maturation were explained by a general up-regulation of
   brain gene transcription. We identified 21 genes that were highly
   connected in a gene coexpression network analysis: nine genes are
   involved in neural processes and four are regulators of gene expression.
   This suggests that negotiating life-history transitions involves
   significant neural processing and reprogramming, and not just changes in
   physiology. These findings provide novel insights into basic
   life-history transitions of an insect. Failure to mate or to become
   reproductively mature is an overlooked component of variation in natural
   systems, despite its prevalence in many sexually reproducing organisms,
   and deserves deeper investigation in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Tick and mosquito management is important to public health protection.
   At the same time, growing concerns about declines of pollinator species
   raise the question of whether vector control practices might affect
   pollinator populations. We report the results of a task force of the
   North American Pollinator Protection Campaign (NAPPC) that examined
   potential effects of vector management practices on pollinators, and how
   these programs could be adjusted to minimize negative effects on
   pollinating species. The main types of vector control practices that
   might affect pollinators are landscape manipulation, biocontrol, and
   pesticide applications. Some current practices already minimize effects
   of vector control on pollinators (e.g., short-lived pesticides and
   application-targeting technologies). Nontarget effects can be further
   diminished by taking pollinator protection into account in the planning
   stages of vector management programs. Effects of vector control on
   pollinator species often depend on specific local conditions (e.g.,
   proximity of locations with abundant vectors to concentrations of floral
   resources), so planning is most effective when it includes
   collaborations of local vector management professionals with local
   experts on pollinators. Interventions can then be designed to avoid
   pollinators (e.g., targeting applications to avoid blooming times and
   pollinator nesting habitats), while still optimizing public health
   protection. Research on efficient targeting of interventions, and on
   effects on pollinators of emerging technologies, will help mitigate
   potential deleterious effects on pollinators in future management
   programs. In particular, models that can predict effects of integrated
   pest management on vector-borne pathogen transmission, along with
   effects on pollinator populations, would be useful for collaborative
   decision-making.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{236-237}},
Pages = {{115-125}},

Abstract = {{Passiflora incarnata is a functionally andromonoecious clonal
   wildflower, native to the southeastern United States, whose primary
   pollinator is the carpenter bee, Xylocopa virginica. While recent
   studies looking at reproductive ecology in P. incarnata have classified
   flowers as one of two morphs (male or hermaphroditic) based on stylar
   deflexion, preliminary field studies conducted in Tennessee indicated
   there were five distinct morphs present (three male, two
   hermaphroditic), supported by stylar deflexion, floral size, and pistil
   development. The present study sought to test the hypothesis that five
   distinct floral morphs are present in P. incarnata by sampling 13 floral
   characters, and to document variation in nectar constituents, volume,
   and concentration across the five morphs. Five well-established
   individual plants were examined at three sites in Cookeville, Tennessee.
   Two-factor permuted analysis of variance of 13 floral characteristics
   with floral morph and individual plants as factors suggested that morph:
   plant interactions explained 6\%, individual plant explained 18\%, and
   floral morph explained 36\% of variation in floral characteristics.
   Nectar sampling indicated that all morphs produced nectar comprised
   exclusively of sucrose. Nectar volume generally increased with floral
   morph size, while nectar concentration decreased. NMDS analysis
   indicated that four of the five hypothesized morphs were supported as
   distinct, with morphs 4a and 4b best classified as submorphs due to
   substantial overlap. The supported morphs are best distinguished by
   ovary width, ovary length, style length, and stigma width. These
   findings support a hypothesis that the morphs result from variation in
   developmental arrest during floral ontogeny. The ecological implications
   of the morphs and nectar variation are considered for X. virginica with
   suggestions for additional studies.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Plant-bee visitorcommunities are complex networks. While studies show
   that deleting nodes alters network topology, predicting these changes in
   the field remains difficult. Here, a simple trait-based approach is
   tested for predicting bee community composition following disturbance. I
   selected six fields with mixed cover of flower species with shallow
   (open) and deep (tube) nectar access, and removed all flowers or flower
   heads of species of each trait in different plots paired with controls,
   then observed bee foraging and composition. I compared the bee community
   in each manipulated plot with bees on the same flower species in control
   plots. The bee morphospecies composition in manipulations with only tube
   flowers remaining was the same as that in the control plots, while the
   bee morphospecies on only open flowers were dissimilar from those in
   control plots. However, the proportion of short-and long-tongued bees on
   focal flowers did not differ between control and manipulated plots for
   either manipulation. So, bees within some functional groups are more
   strongly linked to their floral trait partners than others. And, it may
   be more fruitful to describe expected bee community compositions in
   terms of relative proportions of relevant ecological traits than
   species, particularly in species-diverse communities.}},

Title = {{Are food-deceptive orchid species really functionally specialized for
   pollinators?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Food-deceptive orchid species have traditionally been considered
   pollination specialized to bees or butterflies. However, it is unclear
   to which concept of specialization this assumption is related; if to
   that of phenotypic specialization or of functional specialization. The
   main aim of this work was to verify if pollinators of five widespread
   food-deceptive orchid species (Anacamptis morio (L.) R.M. Bateman,
   Pridgeon \& M.W. Chase, Anacamptis pyramidalis (L.) Rich.,
   Himantoglossum adriaticum H. Baumann, Orchis purpurea Huds. and Orchis
   simia Lam.) predicted from the phenotypic point of view matched with the
   observed ones. We addressed the question by defining target orchids
   phenotypic specialization on the basis of their floral traits, and we
   compared the expected guilds of pollinators with the observed ones.
   Target orchid pollinators were collected by conducting a meta-analysis
   of the available literature and adding unpublished field observations,
   carried out in temperate dry grasslands in NE Italy. Pollinator species
   were subsequently grouped into guilds and differences in the guild
   spectra among orchid species grouped according to their phenotype were
   tested. In contradiction to expectations derived from the phenotypic
   point of view, food-deceptive orchid species were found to be highly

Title = {{Coevolution with pollinating resin midges led to resin-filled nurseries

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Resin is a defence against herbivores and a floral
   reward in a few African and South American species whose bee pollinators
   collect it for nest construction. Here we describe a new role for floral
   resin from the Asian genus Kadsura (Schisandraceae). Kadsura tepals
   tightly cover a globe formed by carpels (in females) or near-fused
   stamens with fleshy connectives (in male flowers of most, but not all
   species).
   Methods We carried out field observations at four sites in China and
   used pollinator behavioural assays, chemical analyses and
   time-calibrated insect and plant phylogenies to investigate the
   specificity of the interactions and their relationship to floral
   structure.
   Key Results Nocturnal resin midges (Resseliella, Cecidomyiidae) walk
   around on the flowers' sexual organs to oviposit, thereby transferring
   pollen and wounding tissues. The larvae then develop in resin-filled
   chambers. Male and female floral scents are dominated by alpha-pinene,
   while the resinous exudate is dominated by caryophyllene. As revealed by
   barcoding of multiple midge larvae per flower species, the mutualisms
   are species specific and appear to have evolved over the past 6-9
   million years.
   Conclusions Resin feeding, not pollen or ovule feeding, by midge larvae
   explains the abundant Kadsura exudates, highlighting the poorly known
   world of nocturnal flower-fly interactions.}},

Title = {{Effect of expanded variation in anther position on pollinator visitation
   to wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{5, SI}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plant-pollinator interactions shape the evolution of
   flowers. Floral attraction and reward traits have often been shown to
   affect pollinator behaviour, but the possible effect of efficiency
   traits on visitation behaviour has rarely been addressed. Anther
   position, usually considered a trait that influences efficiency of
   pollen deposition on pollinators, was tested here for its effect on
   pollinator visitation rates and visit duration in flowers of wild
   radish, Raphanus raphanistrum.
   Methods Artificial selection lines from two experiments that expanded
   the naturally occurring phenotypic variation in anther position were
   used. In one experiment, plant lines were selected either to increase or
   to decrease anther exsertion. The other experiment decreased anther
   dimorphism, which resulted in increased short stamen exsertion. The
   hypothesis was that increased exsertion would increase visitation of
   pollen foragers due to increased visual attraction. Another hypothesis
   was that exsertion of anthers above the corolla would interfere with
   nectar foragers and increase the duration of visit per flower.
   Key Results In the exsertion selection experiment, increased exsertion
   of both short and long stamens resulted in an increased number of fly
   visits per plant, and in the dimorphism experiment bee visits increased
   with increased short stamen exsertion. The duration of visits of nectar
   feeders declined significantly with increasing long stamen exsertion,
   which was opposite to the hypothesis.
   Conclusions Until now, anther position was considered to be an
   efficiency trait to enhance pollen uptake and deposition. Anther
   position in wild radish is shown here also to have an ecological
   significance in attracting pollen foragers. This study suggests an
   additional adaptive role for anther position beyond efficiency, and
   highlights the multiple ecological functions of floral traits in
   plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Functional pollinator abundance and diversity reflects global ecosystem
   health. Declines imply consequences for ecosystems, food production and
   human health. While broader objectives away from monoculture
   conventional agriculture is not addressed smaller scale approaches for
   land management require analysis to improve pollinator conservation
   outcomes. Policy response to neonicotinoid use can provide valuable
   lessons for developing well-informed, cautious and planned policy that
   encourages pollinator abundance and diversity. Response is inconsistent
   around the world with harm considered scientifically inconclusive by
   companies, governments and policy makers, and varied responses
   reflecting this position. Bans demonstrate how strong precautionary
   policy can assist pollination conservation despite a multitude of
   contrasting stakeholder opinions. Approach to implementation of such
   bans influences longevity and influence on conservation.
   This article presents findings from analysis of policy response by
   country to neonicotinoid use and suggests that variation in response be
   attributed to three non-exclusive areas; translation of research
   findings influencing how inconclusive research findings could increase
   motivation for strong precaution, vested interest and approach to
   implementation. Scholarly articles and research findings clarifying
   information available to inform policy decisions are summarised through
   literature review, organised by key theme of article and additionally
   mentioned themes. Meta-analysis of the scholarly articles provides
   statistical representation of mention rates indicative of how pollinator
   research is considering multiple stressors, associated or concurrent as
   contributing to declines. The policy process for neonicotinoid use is
   suggested as a space for learning where other conservation approaches,
   including introducing new species becomes relevant for policy.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Solanum (family Solanaceae) includes more than 1400 species
   and has buzz-pollinated flowers with poricidal anthers. The present
   study aimed to describe the distribution, breeding system and
   pollination mechanism of Solanum melissarum, a species endemic to
   Brazil. The study of breeding system was conducted in an urban forest
   fragment in Jatai, GO. Distribution data were gathered from floristic
   surveys and digital plant databases. The floral morphology and the
   pollination mechanism were studied on through field observations and
   preserved flowers. The breeding system was determined through hand
   pollination treatments. The species has a distribution only in the
   Brazilian Atlantic forest coastal, and this study provides the first
   records of S. melissarum for the state of Goias. The pendulous flowers
   have poricidal anthers close to the stigma, with membranous thecae
   joined by a connective bearing osmophores that attract males of Euglossa
   cordata bees. As they collect fragrances, the bees press the thecae and
   pollen is released through a bellows mechanism. Based on the
   hand-pollination treatments, this species is self-incompatible. Isolated
   forest fragments may not include enough pollinators to ensure the
   pollination of plants with specialized systems. However, they are
   essential for the conservation of species with interesting
   phytogeographic patterns, such as the vicariance observed in S.
   melissarum, and for the conservation of regional diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The reproductive assurance (RA) hypothesis predicts that the ability to
   autonomously self-fertilize should be favored in environments where a
   lack of mates or pollinators limits outcross reproduction. Because such
   limits to outcrossing are predicted to be most severe at range edges,
   elevated autonomy in peripheral populations is often attributed to RA.
   We test this hypothesis in 24 populations spanning the range of
   Campanula americana, including sampling at the range interior and three
   geographic range edges. We scored autonomous fruit set in a
   pollinator-free environment and detected clinal variationautonomy
   increased linearly from the southern to the northern edge, and from the
   eastern to the western edge. We then address whether the cline reflects
   the contemporary pollination environment. We measured population size,
   plant density, pollinator visitation, outcross pollen limitation and RA
   in natural populations over two years. Most populations were pollen
   limited, and those that experienced higher visitation rates by
   bumblebees had reduced pollen limitation. Reproductive assurance,
   however, was generally low across populations and was unrelated to
   pollen limitation or autonomy. Neither pollen limitation nor RA
   displayed geographic clines. Finally, autonomy was not associated with
   pollinator visitation rates or mate availability. Thus, the data do not
   support the RA hypothesis; clinal variation in autonomy is unrelated to
   the current pollination environment. Therefore, geographic patterns of
   autonomy are likely the result of historical processes rather than
   contemporary natural selection for RA.}},

Abstract = {{Heteranthery, the presence of feeding and pollinating anthers in the
   same flower, seems to mediate the evolutionary dilemma for plants to
   protect their gametes and yet provide food for pollinators. This study
   aims to elucidate the role of heteranthery in the buzz-pollinated Senna
   reniformis. The fecundity of pollen from long-, medium- and short-sized
   anthers was determined by hand cross-pollination experiments, and the
   quantity, size, ornamentation and viability of pollen of different
   anthers were compared. Rates of flower rejection by bees were measured
   in anther removal experiments to assess the preferences of flower
   visitors for feeding or pollinating anthers. Large bees, which were the
   effective pollinators of self-incompatible S.reniformis, avoided flowers
   without short feeding anthers, but not those without medium or long
   anthers. Illegitimate small and medium-sized bees were unresponsive to
   anther exclusion experiments. Long anthers deposited pollen on the back
   and short anthers on the venter of large bees. Pollen from long anthers
   had higher invitro viability and higher fruit and seed set after
   cross-pollination than pollen from other sized anthers. Short anthers
   produce feeding pollen to effective pollinators and long anthers are
   related to pollination of S.reniformis. Bee behaviour and size was found

Abstract = {{Naturalists Fritz and Hermann Muller hypothesised that heteranthery
   often leads to a division of labour into feeding' and pollinating'
   stamens; the latter often being as long as the pistil so as to promote
   successful pollination on the bees' back. In many buzz-pollinated
   species of Senna, however, the so-called pollinating stamens are short
   and not level with the stigma, raising the question of how pollen is
   shed on the bees' back. Here we explore a mechanism called ricochet
   pollination'. We test whether division of labour is achieved through the
   interaction between short lower stamens and strongly concave deflector
   petals'. We studied the arrangement and morphology of the floral organs
   involved in the ricochet pollination, functioning of the flowers through
   artificial sonication and observed the interactions between bees and
   flowers in the field. The middle stamens are adapted to eject pollen
   downwards, which can be readily collected on the bee mid legs. Most of
   the pollen is ejected towards the deflector petal(s). Pollen from this
   set of stamens is more likely to contribute to pollination. The pollen
   grains seem to ricochet multiple times against the deflector petals to
   eventually reach the bee's back. The pollen ricochet mechanism promotes
   a division of labour by involving additional floral organs, such as
   petals, reinforcing the Mullers' division-of-labour hypothesis. However,
   alternative, non-multiexclusive hypotheses could be explored in genus
   Senna and other angiosperm species.}},

Title = {{Increasing plant functional diversity is not the key for supporting

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{144-155}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Intensification of agriculture has been one of the major drivers for
   biodiversity loss in recent decades. Pollinators, which serve an
   important role in pollinating crops as well as wild plants, have shown a
   decline in species richness. Flower strips can be used to support
   pollinators in agro-ecosystems, however the question remains as to how
   their design can be optimized in order to best benefit pollinators.
   Increasing plant species diversity has been shown to be beneficial for
   pollinators, and it is often suggested that functional traits are
   driving this relationship. Therefore, increasing plant functional
   diversity could be a tool to support pollinator abundance and diversity.
   As experimental evidence on this relationship is scarce, we developed a
   field study with experimental sown flower strips with four functional
   diversity levels, based on multiple flower traits and with equal plant
   species richness. We monitored vegetation development, as well as the
   flower-visiting pollinator community and their interaction networks with
   flowers. We were able to create a functional diversity gradient while
   controlling for plant species richness and evenness. However, in
   contrast to our expectations, pollinator species richness and evenness
   were not influenced by functional diversity, and increasing functional
   diversity even resulted in lower flower visitation rates. Network
   stability metrics showed no effect or negative relationships with
   functional diversity. We conclude that increasing functional diversity
   was not the key for supporting pollinators in wildflower strips. Our
   results also suggest that, for a constant amount of flower resources,
   increasing plant functional diversity and thus decreasing redundancy of
   potential pollinator feeding niches, decreases the amount of flower
   resources present per feeding niche. As pollinator species tended to
   have less overlap in their feeding niches in flower strips with
   increased functional diversity, this may lead to a reduction of flower
   resources available for pollinator species with a more specialized
   feeding niche.}},

Title = {{The relation between oilseed rape and pollination of later flowering
   plants varies across plant species and landscape contexts}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Increasing cultivation of oilseed rape may have consequences for
   pollinators and wild plant pollination. By providing pollinating insects
   with pollen and nectar, oilseed rape benefits short-tongued, generalist
   insect species. Long-tongued bumble bee species, specialized to other
   flower types, may instead be negatively affected by increased
   competition from the generalists (e.g. due to nectar-robbing of
   long-tubed flowers) after oilseed rape flowering has ceased. We expected
   that the increased abundance of short-tongued pollinators and reduced
   abundance of long-tongued bumble bees in landscapes with a high
   proportion of oilseed rape would impact the pollination of later
   flowering wild plant species. In addition, we expected contrasting
   effects on plants pollinated by short-tongued pollinators and those
   pollinated by long-tongued bumble bees. We predicted that semi-natural
   grasslands, which provide insects with alternative floral resources,
   would reduce both negative and positive effects on pollination by
   mitigating competition between pollinators.
   In 16 semi-natural grasslands, surrounded by agricultural landscapes,
   with a variation in both the proportion of oilseed rape and the
   proportion of semi-natural grassland within 1 km, we studied
   reproductive output in two species of potted plants with different
   pollination strategies: the woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) and red
   clover (Trifolium pratense). The first species is mainly pollinated by
   short-tongued pollinators, e.g. hoverflies and solitary bees, and the
   latter by long-tongued bumble bees. Both species flowered after oilseed
   rape.
   Strawberry weight was higher in landscapes with a high proportion of
   oilseed rape, but only in landscapes with a low proportion of
   semi-natural grassland. The proportion of developed achenes was also
   positively related to the proportion of oilseed rape, but only during
   the latest flowering period. In contrast, red clover seed set was
   unrelated to the proportion of oilseed rape. Whereas the discrepancy
   between the two strawberry measurements calls for further research, this
   study suggests that oilseed rape can affect later flowering plants and
   that the impact differs among species. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The plant-pollinator relationship is generally considered mutualistic.
   This relationship is less clear, however, when pollinators also cause
   tissue damage. Some Megachilidae bees collect plant material for nests
   from the plants they pollinate. In this study, we examined the
   relationship between Anthidium manicatum, the European wool-carder bee,
   and the source of its preferred nesting material - Stachys byzantina,
   lamb's ear. Female A. manicatum use their mandibles to trim trichomes
   from plants for nesting material (a behaviour dubbed ``carding{''}).
   Using volatile organic compound (VOC) headspace analysis and behavioural
   observations, we explored (a) how carding effects S. byzantina and (b)
   how A. manicatum may choose specific S. byzantina plants. We found that
   removal of trichomes leads to a dissimilar VOC bouquet compared to
   intact leaves, with a significant increase in VOC detection following
   damage. A. manicatum also visit S. byzantina plants with trichomes
   removed at a greater frequency compared to plants with trichomes intact.
   Our data suggest that A. manicatum eavesdrop on VOCs produced by damaged
   plants, leading to more carding damage for individual plants due to
   increased detectability by A. manicatum. Accordingly, visitation by A.
   manicatum to S. byzantina may incur both a benefit (pollination) and
   cost (tissue damage) to the plant.}},

   Andrena bee species}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{215}},
Pages = {{72-80}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The loss of key forage plants and a narrow pollen diet have both been
   implicated in the decline of wild bees over the past 70 years. These
   ideas have been studied extensively in recent years in bumblebees
   (Bombus spp.), but have rarely been investigated in other bee groups,
   due in part to a lack of detailed ecological data for many species of
   wild bee. Chambers (1968) extensively documented pollen preferences in
   bees from the genus Andrena collected in Bedfordshire, UK, during the
   1940s, before the period of rapid agricultural intensification following
   the Second World War. This extensive dataset allows for the importance
   of diet breadth in modifying the response of bees to environmental
   change to be investigated in a common and widespread but understudied
   genus of bees. We compared the pollen preferences of a suite of Andrena
   species collected in the 1941-1949 period with a similar suite of
   Andrena species collected between 1985 and 2016. Relative diet breadth
   was consistent across studied species between the historical and
   contemporary period. However, dietary composition changed with a shift
   away from Rosaceae and towards Brassicaceae. The reduction in the
   collection of Rosaceae pollen was more pronounced in spring-flying than
   summer-flying Andrena, which may be due to a reduction in the length and
   quality of hedgerow habitats and hence spring-flowering woody Rosaceae
   present in the countryside, and an increase in the availability of the
   mass-flowering crop oilseed rape (Brassica napus). Both historical and
   contemporary diet breadth were significant positive predictors of how
   frequently Andrena species are encountered on contemporary farmland,
   with those species with a relatively wider diet present on the majority
   of farms. These findings support the idea that inherent differences in
   diet breadth mediate the ability of bee species to respond to changes in
   resource availability resulting from agricultural intensification. A
   more detailed understanding of species-level characteristics can help
   improve our understanding of why seemingly similar species respond very
   differently to environmental change.}},

   clear how species richness and functional diversity, in terms of
   pollination-relevant traits, of these two groups influence each other
   and how they respond to land use change. In the present study, we used
   data from 24 agricultural landscapes in seven European countries to
   investigate the effect of landscape composition and habitat richness on
   species richness and functional diversity of wild bees and
   insect-pollinated plants. We characterized the relationships between the
   diversity of bees and flowering plants and identified indirect effects
   of landscape on bees and plants mediated by these relationships. We
   found that increasing cover of arable land negatively affected flowering
   plant species richness, while increasing habitat richness positively
   affected the species richness and functional diversity of bees. In
   contrast, the functional diversity of insect-pollinated plants (when
   corrected for species richness) was unaffected by landscape composition,
   and habitat richness showed little relation to bee functional diversity.
   We additionally found that bee species richness positively affected
   plant species richness and that bee functional diversity was positively
   affected by both species richness and functional diversity of plants.
   The relationships between flowering plant and bee diversity were
   modulated by indirect effects of landscape characteristics on the biotic
   communities. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that landscape
   properties affect plant and bee communities in both direct and indirect
   ways. The interconnection between the diversities of wild bees and
   insect-pollinated plants increases the risk for parallel declines,
   extinctions, and functional depletion. Our study highlights the
   necessity of considering the interplay between interacting species
   groups when assessing the response of entire communities to land use
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Fire represents a frequent disturbance in many ecosystems, which can
   affect plant-pollinator assemblages and hence the services they provide.
   Furthermore, fire events could affect the architecture of
   plant-pollinator interaction networks, modifying the structure and
   function of communities.
   Some pollinators, such as wood-nesting bees, may be particularly
   affected by fire events due to damage to the nesting material and its
   long regeneration time. However, it remains unclear whether fire
   influences the structure of bee-plant interactions.
   Here, we used quantitative plant-wood-nesting bee interaction networks
   sampled across four different post-fire age categories (from
   freshly-burnt to unburnt sites) in an arid ecosystem to test whether the
   abundance of wood-nesting bees, the breadth of resource use and the
   plant-bee community structure change along a post-fire age gradient.
   We demonstrate that freshly-burnt sites present higher abundances of
   generalist than specialist wood-nesting bees and that this translates
   into lower network modularity than that of sites with greater post-fire
   ages. Bees do not seem to change their feeding behaviour across the
   post-fire age gradient despite changes in floral resource availability.
   Despite the effects of fire on plant-bee interaction network structure,
   these mutualistic networks seem to be able to recover a few years after
   the fire event. This result suggests that these interactions might be
   highly resilient to this type of disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{In natural environments, organisms must adapt to changing light
   conditions. Significant research has been done on diurnal pollinating
   insects' vision. However, little is known on parasitoid insects. Here,
   we studied how locomotor activity of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi
   and its main host, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, is affected under
   controlled artificial illumination. Using LEDs of 5 different
   wavelengths (361, 450, 500-600, 626 and 660 nm), we created different
   artificial light spectra that parasitoids and host aphids can encounter
   in natural environment including leaf-shade and direct sunlight. We
   found that pea aphid probability of walking depended on interactions
   between illumination, developmental stage and genotype as expressed in
   clonal variation. Artificial light intensity did not affect the
   parasitoid's probability of walking as opposed to wavelength, and
   activity depended on the sex of individuals. Males were more active than
   females under all monochromatic wavelength spectra tested. Virgin
   females were much less active under the artificial leaf-shade
   illumination and artificial sunlight, as compared to males and mated
   females. Delay before flight for females was favored by sunlight
   illumination whereas the light environment did not affect flight delay
   for males. We demonstrated that locomotor activity of A. pisum (walking)
   and of A. ervi (walking and flight) vary according to the light
   environment. This study should help develop better understanding of the
   effects of illumination on host-parasitoid interactions, which in turn
   may help control insect pest populations.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological processes operating on large spatio-temporal scales are
   difficult to disentangle with traditional empirical approaches.
   Alternatively, researchers can take advantage of natural' experiments,
   where experimental control is exercised by careful site selection.
   Recent advances in developing protocols for designing these
   pseudo-experiments' commonly do not consider the selection of the focal
   region and predictor variables are usually restricted to two. Here, we
   advance this type of site selection protocol to study the impact of
   multiple landscape scale factors on pollinator abundance and diversity
   across multiple regions.
   Using datasets of geographic and ecological variables with national
   coverage, we applied a novel hierarchical computation approach to select
   study sites that contrast as much as possible in four key variables,
   while attempting to maintain regional comparability and national
   representativeness. There were three main steps to the protocol: (i)
   selection of six 100x100km(2) regions that collectively provided land
   cover representative of the national land average, (ii) mapping of
   potential sites into a multivariate space with axes representing four
   key factors potentially influencing insect pollinator abundance, and
   (iii) applying a selection algorithm which maximized differences between
   the four key variables, while controlling for a set of external
   constraints.
   Validation data for the site selection metrics were recorded alongside
   the collection of data on pollinator populations during two field
   campaigns. While the accuracy of the metric estimates varied, the site
   selection succeeded in objectively identifying field sites that differed
   significantly in values for each of the four key variables.
   Between-variable correlations were also reduced or eliminated, thus
   facilitating analysis of their separate effects.
   This study has shown that national datasets can be used to select
   randomized and replicated field sites objectively within multiple
   regions and along multiple interacting gradients. Similar protocols
   could be used for studying a range of alternative research questions
   related to land use or other spatially explicit environmental variables,
   and to identify networks of field sites for other countries, regions,
   drivers and response taxa in a wide range of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the linkage between flowering phenology and pollination
   success in alpine plant communities, we quantified the seasonality of
   flower visitors, the temporal transition of floral resources, and the
   variation in pollination success of alpine plants in northern Japan.
   Bumble bees, syrphid flies, and non-syrphid flies were the predominant
   flower visitors. Foraging activity of bumble bees increased toward the
   late flowering period reflecting the life cycle of colony development.
   The activity of syrphid flies was sensitive to ambient temperature,
   while that of non-syrphid flies remained high throughout the season.
   Flower production of bee-pollinated plants fluctuated significantly
   between years with a bimodal pattern peaking in the early and late
   periods, while flower production of fly-pollinated plants was less
   variable between years. Fruit-set success of bee-pollinated plants
   increased considerably from the early to the late flowering period,
   while the trend for fly-pollinated plants was less marked. Three times
   more visits of dipteran insects are necessary for fly-pollinated plants
   to achieve fruiting success comparable to bee-pollinated plants. Bumble
   bees are potentially excellent pollinators, but the visitation frequency
   is low early in the season. Lower pollination ability of dipteran
   insects may be compensated for by abundant flower visits. The
   relationships between flowering phenology and fruit-set success of
   alpine plant communities highly depend on the type of pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of floral displays simultaneously broadcast signals from
   multiple sensory modalities, but these multimodal displays come at both
   a metabolic cost and an increased conspicuousness to floral antagonists.
   Why then do plants invest in these costly multimodal displays? The
   efficacy backup hypothesis suggests that individual signal components
   act as a backup for others in the presence of environmental variability.
   Here, we test the efficacy backup hypothesis by investigating the
   ability of bumblebees to differentiate between sets of artificial
   flowers in the presence of either chemical interference or high wind
   speeds, both of which have the potential to impede the transmission of
   olfactory signals. We found that both chemical interference and high
   wind speeds negatively affected forager learning times, but these
   effects were mitigated in the presence of a visual signal component. Our
   results suggest that visual signals can act as a backup for olfactory
   signals in the presence of chemical interference and high wind speeds,

Abstract = {{Diverse forms of nanoscale architecture generate structural colour and
   perform signalling functions within and between species. Structural
   colour is the result of the interference of light from approximately
   regular periodic structures; some structural disorder is, however,
   inevitable in biological organisms. Is this disorder functional and
   subject to evolutionary selection, or is it simply an unavoidable
   outcome of biological developmental processes? Here we show that
   disordered nanostructures enable flowers to produce visual signals that
   are salient to bees. These disordered nanostructures (identified in most
   major lineages of angiosperms) have distinct anatomies but convergent
   optical properties; they all produce angle-dependent scattered light,
   predominantly at short wavelengths (ultraviolet and blue). We
   manufactured artificial flowers with nanoscale structures that possessed
   tailored levels of disorder in order to investigate how foraging
   bumblebees respond to this optical effect. We conclude that floral
   nanostructures have evolved, on multiple independent occasions, an
   effective degree of relative spatial disorder that generates a photonic
   signature that is highly salient to insect pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Central Asia is one of the important centers of bee diversity in the
   Palearctic Region. However, there is insufficient information for many
   taxa in the central Asian bee fauna. The Kyushu and Shimane Universities
   (Japan) Expeditions to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Xinjiang
   Uyghur of China were conducted in the years 2000 to 2004 and 2012 to
   2014.
   New information
   Eighty-eight species of the bee family Halictidae Thomson, 1869 are
   enumerated including new localities in central Asia. Halictus tibialis
   Walker, 1871, H. persephone Ebmer, 1976, Lasioglossum denislucum
   (Strand, 1909), L. griseolum (Morawitz, 1872), L. melanopus (Della

   1852), L. subequestre (Bluthgen, 1931), L. sublaterale (Bluthgen, 1931),
   and L. zonulum (Smith, 1848) are recorded from central Asia for the
   first time. Thirty-two species are newly recorded from Kazakhstan, 19
   spp. from Kyrgyzstan, 2 spp. from Uzbekistan, and 11 spp. from Xinjiang
   Uyghur of China. The genus Lasioglossum dominated the number of species
   and individuals in the collection. The halictid fauna mostly composed of
   western to central Asian elements in our surveyed area.}},

Abstract = {{Eusocial insect colonies are defined by extreme variation in
   reproductive activity among castes, but the ancestral conditions from
   which this variation arose are unknown. Investigating the factors that
   contribute to variation in reproductive physiology among solitary
   insects that are closely related to social species can help to fill this
   gap. We experimentally tested the role of nutrition, juvenile hormone
   (JH) and social cues on reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees
   (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi). We found that alkali bee females emerge
   from overwintering with small Dufour's glands and small ovaries,
   containing oocytes in the early stages of development. Oocyte maturation
   occurs rapidly, and is staggered between the two ovaries. Lab-reared
   females reached reproductive maturity without access to mates or nesting
   opportunities, and many had resorbed oocytes. Initial activation of
   these reproductive structures does not depend on pollen consumption,
   though dietary protein or lipids may be necessary for
   long-termreproductive activity. JH is likely to be a limiting factor in
   alkali bee reproductive activation, as females treated with JH were more
   likely to developmature oocytes and Dufour's glands. Unlike for related
   social bees, the effects of JH were not suppressed by the presence of
   older, reproductive females. These results provide valuable insight into
   the factors that influence reproductive activity in an important native
   pollinator, and those that may have been particularly influential in the
   evolution of reproductive castes.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is an important phenotypic trait that correlates with
   performance and fitness. For determinate growing insects, body size
   variation is determined by growth rate and the mechanisms that stop
   growth at the end of juvenile growth. Endocrine mechanisms regulate
   growth cessation, and their relative timing along development shapes
   phenotypic variation in body size and development time. Larval insects
   are generally hypothesized to initiate metamorphosis once they attain a
   critical weight. However, the mechanisms underlying the critical weight
   have not been resolved even for well-studied insect species. More
   importantly, critical weights may or may not be generalizable across
   species. In this study, we characterized the developmental aspects of
   size regulation in the solitary bee, Osmia lignaria. We demonstrate that
   starvation cues metamorphosis in O. lignaria and that a critical weight
   does not exist in this species. Larvae initiated pupation <24 h after
   food was absent. However, even larvae fed ad libitum eventually
   underwent metamorphosis, suggesting that some secondary mechanism
   regulates metamorphosis when provisions are not completely consumed. We
   show that metamorphosis could be induced by precocene treatment in the
   presence of food, which suggests that this decision is regulated through
   juvenile hormone signaling. Removing food at different larval masses
   produced a 10-fold difference in mass between smallest and largest
   adults. We discuss the implications of body size variation for insect
   species that are provided with a fixed quantity of provisions, including
   many bees which have economic value as pollinators.}},

   Neonicotinoid pesticides have been identified or suspected as a key

   United States populations of 26 species of hawk moths (family
   Sphingidae) that are presumed to be pollinators. We compiled over 6,600
   records from nine museum and 14 private collections that spanned a
   112-year period, and used logistic generalized linear mixed models
   (GLMMs) to examine long-term population trends. We controlled for uneven
   sampling effort by adding a covariate for list length, the number of
   species recorded during each sampling event. We found that of the 22
   species for which there was sufficient data to assess population trends,
   eight species declined and four species increased in detection
   probability (the probability of a species being recorded during each
   year while accounting for effort, climate, and spatial effects in the
   GLMMs). Of the four species with too few records to statistically
   assess, two have disappeared from parts of their ranges. None of the
   four species with diurnal adults showed a trend in detection
   probability. Two species that are pests of solanaceous crops declined,
   consistent with a seven-fold drop in the area planted in tobacco and
   tomato crops. We found some evidence linking susceptibility to
   parasitoidism by the introduced fly Compsilura concinnata (Tachinidae)
   to declines. Moths with larvae that feed on vines and trees, where
   available evidence indicates that the fly is most likely to attack, had
   a greater propensity to decline than species that use herbs and shrubs
   as larval host plants. Species that develop in the spring, before
   Compsilura populations have increased, did not decline. However,
   restricting the analysis to hawk moth records from areas outside of a
   ``refuge{''} area where Compsilura does not occur did not significantly
   increase the intensity of the declines as would be predicted if
   Compsilura was the primary cause of declines. Forests have recovered
   over the study period across most of the northeastern U.S., but this
   does not appear to have been a major factor because host plants of
   several of the declining species have increased in abundance with forest
   expansion and maturation. Climate variables used in the GLMMs were not
   consistently related to moth detection probability. Hawk moth declines
   may have ecological effects on both the plants pollinated by these
   species and vertebrate predators of the moths.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical imidacloprid belongs to the neonicotinoids insecticide
   class, widely used for insect pest control mainly for crop protection.
   However, imidacloprid is a non-selective agrochemical to the insects and
   it is able to kill the most important pollinators, the bees. The high
   toxicity of imidacloprid requires controlled release and continuous
   monitoring. For this purpose, high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) is usually employed; infrared and Raman spectroscopy, however,
   are simple and viable techniques that can be adapted to portable devices
   for field application. In this communication, state-of-the-art quantum
   level simulations were used to predict the infrared and Raman spectra of
   the most stable conformer of imidacloprid. Four molecular geometries
   were investigated in vacuum and solvated within the Density Functional
   Theory (DFT) approach employing the hybrid meta functional M06-2X and
   the hybrid functional B3LYP. The M062X/PCM model,proved to be the best
   to predict structural features, while the values of harmonic vibrational
   frequencies were predicted more accurately using the B3LYP functional.

Title = {{Modelling patterns of pollinator species richness and diversity using
   satellite image texture}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Assessing species richness and diversity on the basis of standardised
   field sampling effort represents a cost-and time-consuming method.
   Satellite remote sensing (RS) can help overcome these limitations
   because it facilitates the collection of larger amounts of spatial data
   using cost-effective techniques. RS information is hence increasingly
   analysed to model biodiversity across space and time. Here, we focus on
   image texture measures as a proxy for spatial habitat heterogeneity,
   which has been recognized as an important determinant of species
   distributions and diversity. Using bee monitoring data of four years
   (2010-2013) from six 4 x 4 km field sites across Central Germany and a
   multimodel inference approach we test the ability of texture features
   derived from Landsat-TM imagery to model local pollinator biodiversity.
   Textures were shown to reflect patterns of bee diversity and species
   richness to some extent, with the first-order entropy texture and
   terrain roughness being the most relevant indicators. However, the
   texture measurements accounted for only 3-5\% of up to 60\% of the
   variability that was explained by our final models, although the results
   are largely consistent across different species groups (bumble bees,
   solitary bees). While our findings provide indications in support of the
   applicability of satellite imagery textures for modeling patterns of bee
   biodiversity, they are inconsistent with the high predictive power of
   texture metrics reported in previous studies for avian biodiversity. We
   assume that our texture data captured mainly heterogeneity resulting
   from landscape configuration, which might be functionally less important
   for wild bees than compositional diversity of plant communities. Our
   study also highlights the substantial variability among taxa in the
   applicability of texture metrics for modelling biodiversity.}},

   likely parthenogenetic population in the Atlantic Forest around the

   Paulo. As has been previously surmised for this species, the sample
   consisted of only females, tending to support the hypothesis of
   thelytokous parthenogenesis for this population. The gynandromorph is
   largely female in outward appearance, but exhibits male secondary sexual
   traits on the left side of the apical abdominal segments. The left
   (male) antenna consists of antennomeres of different proportions to
   those of the right (female) antenna. The internal genitalia and
   associated sclerites, however, are female although some are augmented in
   their form relative to normal-type females. Comments are made on
   possible factors resulting in the development of the gynandromorph. This
   is the 16th insect order with gynandromorphism reported. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Stingless bees foraging for food improve recruitment by depositing

   Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and bioassays, we showed that
   Melipona solani foragers leave a mixture composed mostly of long chain
   hydrocarbons from their abdominal cuticle plus methyl oleate from the
   labial gland as a scent mark on rich food sites. The composition of
   hydrocarbons was highly variable among individuals and varied in
   proportions, depending on the body part. A wide ratio of compounds
   present in different body parts of the bees elicited electroantennogram
   responses from foragers and these responses were dose dependent.
   Generally, in bioassays, these bees prefer to visit previously visited
   feeders and feeders marked with extracts from any body part of
   conspecifics. The mean number of visits to a feeder was enhanced when
   synthetic methyl oleate was added. We propose that this could be a case
   of multi-source odor marking, in which hydrocarbons, found in large
   abundance, act as a signature mixture with attraction enhanced through
   deposition of methyl oleate, which may indicate a rich food source.}},

Abstract = {{Schima superba Gardn. et Champ. is a perennial, evergreen tree valued
   for its eco-protection and commercial values in China. In this study, we
   investigate the breeding system, reproductive ecology and pollination
   biology of S. superba in a seed orchard. The flowers are hermaphrodite
   and protogynous. The viability of the pollen is inactivated rapidly, and
   the stigma maintains a high receptivity within the flower lifespan.
   Flowers typically offer pollen and nectar to visitors. The flowers
   possess a typical insect pollination syndrome, and three visitors
   (Apiscerana cerana Fabricius, Protaetia brevitarsis Lewis, and Popillia
   mutans Newman) are observed on flowers during the study period. The
   visitation frequency per minute and capability of pollen removal and
   deposition of A. cerana are significantly higher than P. brevitarsis and
   P. mutans, although the pollinator efficiency is lower than those shown
   by the two beetles. Fruit set (28.27\%) and seed set (6.57\%)
   percentages resulting from open-pollination are significantly lower than
   those resulting from cross-pollination (fruit/seed set,
   43.73\%/11.66\%), and the pollen limitation index (L) was 0.34,
   suggesting that seed production is pollen-limited in the seed orchard.
   The pollen/ovule ratio (P/O) and outcrossing index (OCI) values are
   6686.67 and 4, respectively. The self-incompatibility index (ISI) was
   estimated to be 0.95. Results from hand-pollination, pollen tube growth
   experiments and the ISI value show that S. superba is late-acting
   self-incompatible. The synthetic results indicate that A. cerana is the
   most efficient pollinator of S. superba, and seed production is
   frequently limited by pollinators, fruit abortion, and pollen quality.}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Assortative mating by flowering time can cause
   temporal genetic structure in species with heritable flowering times. A
   strong temporal structure, when coupled with a seasonal shift in
   selection, may lead to adaptive temporal clines. We implemented a
   prospective and retrospective method to estimate the temporal genetic
   structure in the pollen pool of Brassica rapa.
   METHODS: The prospective method uses flowering schedules to estimate the
   seasonal shift in the pollen donors' phenotype. By examining the off
   spring generation, we can get a direct estimate of temporal genetic
   structure, i.e., a retrospective estimate. However, this estimate is
   problematic because of the phenotypic correlation of the trait of
   interest, flowering time, between dam and sire. We developed a novel
   retrospective method that isolates flowering time by holding the
   maternal contribution constant and sampled the pollen pool in eight
   open-pollinated field plots throughout the flowering season.
   KEY RESULTS: We found temporal genetic structure for flowering time in
   seven of the eight field plots. Interestingly, the direct
   (retrospective) temporal structure estimate was 35\% larger than the
   prospective estimate based on flowering schedules. Spatial clumping of
   pollen donors did not affect temporal structure, but structure
   intensified when heritability was experimentally enhanced.
   CONCLUSIONS: Temporal genetic structure, especially for flowering time,
   likely occurs in many plant populations and may be underestimated using
   a prospective method. We discuss the genome-wide consequences of
   temporal genetic structure and the potential for adaptive temporal
   clines in plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers visited by a broad assemblage of animals may nevertheless be
   considered to have a specialized pollination system if pollen deposition
   is effected mainly by a subset of these visitors. The importance of a
   particular animal group for pollination derives mainly from the relative
   rate of floral visitation and per-visit effectiveness for pollen
   deposition. We assessed the relative importance of birds and insects for
   pollination of the African shrub Syncolostemon densiflorus (Lamiaceae).
   Flower visitors were observed to evaluate their visitation rates. Virgin
   flowers were exposed to single visits by nine animal visitor groups to
   evaluate their effectiveness at depositing pollen on stigmas. We
   selectively excluded birds and larger insects from flowers to assess the
   contribution of smaller visitors to pollen deposition and seed set.
   Sunbirds and insects visited flowers at a similar frequency, but on a
   per-visit basis, sunbirds deposited more pollen on stigmas than did any
   of the insect groups, including honeybees, long-proboscid flies,
   butterflies and day-flying hawkmoths. Selective exclusion of birds and
   larger insects resulted in a large decline in pollen deposition on
   stigmas and seed production. These results show that S. densiflorus is
   pollinated mainly by sunbirds, despite its attraction of a broad
   assemblage of insect flower visitors. These findings highlight the
   importance of per-visit pollination effectiveness and selective
   exclusion for understanding the ecological importance of different
   flower visitors.}},

Abstract = {{Examining variations in pollinator effectiveness can enhance our
   understanding of how pollinators and plants interact. Pollen deposition
   and seed production after a single visit by a pollinator are often used
   to estimate pollinator effectiveness. However, seed production is not
   always directly related to pollen deposition because not all pollen
   grains that are deposited on a stigma are compatible or conspecific. In
   the field, we tested pollinator effectiveness based on pollen deposition
   and the resulting seed production after single visits by different
   pollinator groups in a gynodieocious alpine plant Cyananthus delavayi
   (Campanulaceae). Our results showed that mean pollen deposition was
   generally inconsistent with mean seed production when comparisons were
   performed among different pollinator groups and sexes. In general, the
   correlations were not significant between pollen deposition and seed
   production in both perfect and female flowers after single visits by
   halictid bees, bumble bees, and hoverflies. We suggest seed set of
   virgin flowers after single visits is a more reliable indicator of
   pollinator effectiveness than pollen deposition and would be a better
   indicator of pollinator effectiveness for future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Recent analyses suggesting that certain populations of bees may be
   declining have led to a variety of conservation efforts, many of which
   rely on public support and participation. However, little is known about
   the public's knowledge of bee diversity. We carried out a survey to
   measure public understanding of bee diversity and found that although
   99\% of respondents believed that bees are critical or important, only
   14\% were able to guess within 1000 the actual number of bee species in
   the US. Furthermore, when reviewing a selection of photographs depicting
   various insects, many respondents were unable to discern bees from
   non-bees. Our findings show that even as scientific research on bees has
   rapidly expanded, the public remains largely uninformed on the subject,
   especially with regard to the wealth of bee diversity in the US. In
   light of the fact that conservation efforts require substantial public
   support, any programs aimed at stopping or mitigating bee population
   declines will need to include outreach and education measures.}},

Abstract = {{Recent pollinator declines highlight the importance of evaluating
   economic risk of agricultural systems heavily dependent on rented honey
   bees or native pollinators. Our study analyzed variability of native
   bees and honey bees, and the risks these pose to profitability of
   Maine's wild blueberry industry. We used cross-sectional data from
   organic, low-, medium-, and high-input wild blueberry producers in 1993,
   1997-1998, 2005-2007, and from 2011 to 2015 (n = 162 fields). Data
   included native and honey bee densities (count/m(2)/min) and honey bee
   stocking densities (hives/ha). Blueberry fruit set, yield, and honey bee
   hive stocking density models were estimated. Fruit set is impacted about
   1.6 times more by native bees than honey bees on a per bee basis. Fruit
   set significantly explained blueberry yield. Honey bee stocking density
   in fields predicted honey bee foraging densities. These three models
   were used in enterprise budgets for all four systems from on-farm
   surveys of 23 conventional and 12 organic producers (2012-2013). These
   budgets formed the basis of Monte Carlo simulations of production and
   profit. Stochastic dominance of net farm income (NFI) cumulative
   distribution functions revealed that if organic yields are high enough
   (2,345 kg/ha), organic systems are economically preferable to
   conventional systems. However, if organic yields are lower (724 kg/ha),
   it is riskier with higher variability of crop yield and NFI. Although
   medium-input systems are stochastically dominant with lower NFI
   variability compared with other conventional systems, the high-input
   system breaks even with the low-input system if honey bee hive rental
   prices triple in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic plasticity and/or pollinator-mediated selection may be
   responsible for the changes in floral traits of plants when they are
   forced to live in new conditions. Although the two events could be
   independent, we hypothesized that phenotypic plasticity in floral traits
   might help to coordinate plant-pollinator interactions and enhance plant
   reproductive success in changing habitats. To test this hypothesis, we
   investigated floral traits and pollination on three natural populations
   of a lousewort (Pedicularis siphonantha) ranging at different
   elevations, as well as two downward transplanted populations in
   Shangeri-La County and Deqin County, northwest Yunnan, China. The
   results indicated that floral traits, i.e. phenology, longevity, display
   size, corolla tube length and pollen production differed significantly
   among populations. Moreover, or the two transplanted populations, floral
   traits diverged from their original populations, but converged to their
   host populations. Although the phenotypic plasticity in floral traits
   might be a rapid response to abiotic factor such as warmer environment,
   the changes in floral traits were found to be well adapted to
   pollination environment of the host population. Compared with plants of
   their original habitats in higher elevation, the transplanted
   individuals advanced flowering time, shortened flower longevity, reduced
   floral display size and pollen production, received higher visiting
   frequency and yielded more seeds. These findings suggested that
   phenotypic plasticity of floral traits might help plants adjust their
   resource allocation strategy between pre- and post-pollination stages in
   response to harsh or temperate conditions, which might correspondingly
   meet a pollinator-poor or hyphen rich environment. This would be
   beneficial for the widely-distributed species to adapt to various
   environmental changes.}},

Title = {{Comparative floral biology of Rhynchospora ciliata (Vahl) Kukenth and R.

   bracts in attracting pollinating insects}},

Abstract = {{Although Cyperaceae are considered anemophilous, some species exhibit
   features that are attractive to pollinators, such as the white
   UV-reflecting involucral bracts of Rhynchospora ciliata. But how
   effective are these conspicuous adaptations? To address this question,
   we tested the hypothesis that species such as R. ciliata are visited by
   greater numbers of pollinating insects than similar species with green
   involucral bracts, such as R. pubera. We compared the floral biology of
   both species and the number of visits to sympatric populations of each
   species, associating them with the availability of pollen and the
   pollination system. We verified that species with white involucral
   bracts are preferred, because there were more visits to R. ciliata in
   the first 2 h the flowers were open. The peak visitation in R. pubera
   was 2 h after the flowers opened, when the pollen of R. ciliata was
   exhausted. Although the involucral bracts of R. pubera are green, the
   spikelet scales and anthers are white and reflect ultraviolet light.
   Overall, flowers of R. pubera exhibit fewer white or reflective surfaces
   and are probably less conspicuous to a bee than those of R. ciliata. It
   is possible that R. pubera is a second option for visitors after the
   first 2 h of anthesis. The two different peaks in visitation minimize
   interspecific competition for pollinators, suggesting that R. ciliata
   and R. pubera together could attract more generalist pollinators and,
   instead of competing, facilitate the pollination of both species.
   Although R. pubera is autogamous and self-compatible, both wind and
   insects are important to its reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Swartzia glazioviana is a threatened legume tree species from the
   Brazilian Atlantic Forest characterized by aggregations of individuals
   and endemism to an area with extensive human occupation. It is critical
   to conduct studies on the species to conserve the remaining populations.
   Using ten nuclear microsatellite loci, we examined the genotypic and
   genetic diversity and structure, inbreeding, stand-level spatial genetic
   structure (SGS), effective population size, mating system, and pollen
   flow in three isolated remnant populations, aiming to inform
   conservation strategies. All adult individuals found in the populations
   were mapped and sampled and open-pollinated seeds were collected from
   two populations. The genotypic diversity (> 0.85) indicates that sexual
   reproduction is predominant and the short distance between ramets
   indicates that asexual reproduction occurs by root development. In
   general, populations present SGS which is explained, in part, by root
   development. The genetic differentiation among populations was greater
   between more distant populations, suggesting a gene dispersal pattern of
   isolation by distance. Pollen flow (> 27\%) indicates that populations
   are not reproductively isolated, but fertilization followed an isolation
   by distance pattern. The outcrossing rate was high ( > 0.8), but some
   mating occurred among related individuals ( > 0.1) and were correlated (
   > 0.15), indicating inbreeding and varying levels of relatedness within
   families. Inbreeding was higher in seed cohorts than adults, suggesting
   selection against inbred individuals between seed and adult stages. The
   results are discussed considering in situ conservation and strategies
   for seed collection for environmental reforestation.}},

Title = {{Nectar foragers contribute to the pollination of buzz-pollinated plant
   species}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1451-1463}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Pollination performance may depend on the type of
   floral resource (pollen or nectar) foraged by visitors. In
   buzz-pollinated plant species, the poricidal anthers release pollen
   during active pollen collection that induces flower vibrations. These
   buzz-pollinated species generally do not produce nectar. Nevertheless,
   several Ericaceae are buzz-pollinated and produce nectar. We estimated
   the relative effectiveness of visitors according to the type of resource
   collected, nectar or pollen (buzzing).
   METHODS: We compared the relative performance of pollen removal,
   transport, and deposition (effectiveness) of the main insect visitors on
   four ericaceous species: three buzz-pollinated species with different
   pore sizes, Erica tetralix, Vaccinium myrtillus, and V. vitis-idaea; and
   one non-buzz-pollinated species, Calluna vulgaris.
   KEY RESULTS: Bumblebees were the main pollinators for the three
   buzz-pollinated species, whereas hoverflies were the main pollinators
   for the nonbuzz-pollinated generalist C. vulgaris. For the studied plant
   species, we observed no difference in pollination effectiveness among
   bumblebee species. Buzzing bumblebees were the most effective visitors
   for pollination per flower visit for the two Vaccinium species, whereas
   nectar foragers were the most effective visitors for pollination of E.
   tetralix. In the case of Vaccinium myrtillus, nectar foragers
   contributed the most to pollination success because they were more
   abundant than pollen foragers.
   CONCLUSIONS: We showed that consideration of the resource collected by
   visitors and their behavior is necessary to compare their relative
   performance. The combination of visitation rate and effectiveness per
   visit reveals that nectar foragers make a substantial contribution to
   pollination of the buzz-pollinated ericaceous species.}},

Title = {{Dissecting the `bacon and eggs' phenotype: transcriptomics of
   post-anthesis colour change in Lotus}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{563-575}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Post-anthesis colour change (PACC) is widely thought
   to be an adaptation to signal floral suitability to pollinators. Lotus
   filicaulis and Lotus sessilifolius are insect-pollinated herbaceous
   legumes with flowers that open yellow, shift to orange and finally red.
   This study examines the molecular basis for floral colour change in
   these Lotus species.
   Methods Lotus filicaulis was cultivated in a glasshouse from which
   pollinating insects (bees) were excluded, and the rate of colour change
   was recorded in both unpollinated and manually pollinated flowers.
   Unpollinated flowers from both the yellow stage and the red stage were
   sampled for sequencing. The transcriptomes of L. filicaulis and L.
   sessilifolius of both colour stages were analysed for differentially
   expressed genes and enriched ontologies.
   Key Results The rate of progression through PACC doubled when L.
   filicaulis was hand-pollinated. De novo assembly of RNA-Seq reads from
   non-model Lotus species outperformed heterologous alignment of reads to
   the L. japonicus genome. Differential expression analysis suggested that
   the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is upregulated at anthesis while the
   flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is upregulated with the onset of PACC in
   L. filicaulis and L. sessilifolius.
   Conclusion Pollination significantly accelerates PACC in L. filicaulis,
   consistent with the hypothesis that PACC increases pollination
   efficiency by directing pollinators to unpollinated flowers. RNA-Seq
   results show the synchronized upregulation of the entire cyanidin
   biosynthesis pathway in the red stage of PACC in L. filicaulis and L.
   sessilifolius. The genes implicated offer the basis for further
   investigations into how gene families, transcription factors and related
   pathways are likely to be involved in PACC.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{214}},

Abstract = {{Major hydroelectric dams are among key emergent agents of habitat loss
   and fragmentation in lowland tropical forests. Orchid bees (Apidae,
   Euglossini) are one of the most important groups of specialized
   pollinators of flowering plants in Neotropical forests. Here, we
   investigate how an entire assemblage of orchid bees responded to the
   effects of forest habitat loss, isolation and forest canopy degradation
   induced by a hydroelectric reservoir of Central Brazilian Amazonia.
   Built in 1986, the Balbina Dam resulted in a vast archipelagic landscape
   containing 3546 primary forest islands of varying sizes and isolation,
   surrounded by 3129 km(2) of freshwater. Using scent traps, we sampled 34
   islands, 14 open-water matrix sites, and three mainland continuous
   forests, yielding 2870 male orchid bees representing 25 species. Local
   orchid bee species richness was affected by forest patch area but
   particularly by site isolation. Distance to forest edges, either within
   forest areas or into the open-water matrix, was the most important
   predictor of species richness and composition. Variation in matrix
   dispersal of individual species to increasingly isolated sites was a key
   determinant of community structure. Given the patterns of patch
   persistence and matrix movements of orchid bees in increasingly
   fragmented forest landscapes, we outline how forest bees respond to the
   landscape alteration induced by major hydroelectric dams. These results
   should be considered in environmental impact studies prior to the
   approval of new dams.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator communities exhibit variable responses to changing landscape
   composition. A general expectation is that a decreasing cover of
   semi-natural habitats negatively affects pollinator reproduction,
   population size and pollination services, but few studies have
   investigated the simultaneous effects of landscape complexity on
   different aspects of pollinator communities and functioning.
   In 20 agricultural landscape plots the size of an average Dutch farm, we
   studied how changing landscape complexity affected wild bee abundance,
   species richness and reproduction. To measure pollination, we placed
   potted strawberry plants as phytometers in landscapes. Landscape
   complexity was characterized as the area of semi-natural habitats. In
   addition, we estimated floral resource abundance in each landscape plot.
   We expected that i) bee species richness, reproduction and pollination
   would be positively related to area of semi-natural habitats and flower
   abundance, and that ii) species richness and reproduction would be
   positively related to pollination.
   An increase in semi-natural habitats in landscapes increased both the
   abundance of cavity-nesting bees colonizing trap nests, and the growth
   rates of experimental Bombus terrestris L. colonies, but not the species
   richness of wild bees measured by pan traps. There was only a tendency
   for higher pollination levels of strawberry plants with higher cover of
   semi-natural habitats. There was no relationship between species
   richness and bee reproduction in a landscape and the pollination
   services. Estimated flower abundance in landscape had a positive effect
   on bumblebee colony growth only and not on the other variables.
   Our results suggest that, by improving habitat quality on their farms
   through establishing more semi-natural habitats or enhancing the flower
   availability in semi-natural habitats, farmers can promote reproduction
   of a number of functionally important bee species and the pollination
   services they provide. Bee species richness, however, seems to be More
   difficult to enhance and requires more than just creating more of the
   same type of habitats or flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Floral traits have largely been attributed to phenotypic selection in
   plant-pollinator interactions. However, the strength of this link has
   rarely been ascertained with real pollinators. We conducted pollinator
   observations and estimated selection through female fitness on flowering
   phenology and floral traits between two Primula secundiflora
   populations. We quantified pollinator-mediated selection by subtracting
   estimates of selection gradients of plants receiving supplemental hand
   pollination from those of plants receiving open pollination. There was
   net directional selection for an earlier flowering start date at
   populations where the dominant pollinators were syrphid flies, and
   flowering phenology was also subjected to stabilized quadratic
   selection. However, a later flowering start date was significantly
   selected at populations where the dominant pollinators were legitimate
   (normal pollination through the corolla tube entrance) and illegitimate
   bumblebees (abnormal pollination through nectar robbing hole which
   located at the corolla tube), and flowering phenology was subjected to
   disruptive quadratic selection. Wider corolla tube entrance diameter was
   selected at both populations. Furthermore, the strength of net
   directional selection on flowering start date and corolla tube entrance
   diameter was stronger at the population where the dominant pollinators
   were syrphid flies. Pollinator-mediated selection explained most of the
   between-population variations in the net directional selection on
   flowering phenology and corolla tube entrance diameter. Our results
   suggested the important influence of pollinator-mediated selection on
   floral evolution. Variations in pollinator assemblages not only resulted
   in variation in the direction of selection but also the strength of
   selection on floral traits.}},

Title = {{Flower resource and land management drives hoverfly communities and bee
   abundance in seminatural and agricultural grasslands}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{8073-8086}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service, and appropriate management,
   particularly in agricultural systems, is essential to maintain a
   diversity of pollinator guilds. However, management recommendations
   frequently focus on maintaining plant communities, with the assumption
   that associated invertebrate populations will be sustained. We tested
   whether plant community, flower resources, and soil moisture would
   influence hoverfly (Syrphidae) abundance and species richness in
   floristically-rich seminatural and floristically impoverished
   agricultural grassland communities in Wales (U.K.) and compared these to
   two Hymenoptera genera, Bombus, and Lasioglossum. Interactions between
   environmental variables were tested using generalized linear modeling,
   and hoverfly community composition examined using canonical
   correspondence analysis. There was no difference in hoverfly abundance,
   species richness, or bee abundance, between grassland types. There was a
   positive association between hoverfly abundance, species richness, and
   flower abundance in unimproved grasslands. However, this was not evident
   in agriculturally improved grassland, possibly reflecting intrinsically
   low flower resource in these habitats, or the presence of plant species
   with low or relatively inaccessible nectar resources. There was no
   association between soil moisture content and hoverfly abundance or
   species richness. Hoverfly community composition was influenced by
   agricultural improvement and the amount of flower resource. Hoverfly
   species with semiaquatic larvae were associated with both seminatural
   and agricultural wet grasslands, possibly because of localized larval
   habitat. Despite the absence of differences in hoverfly abundance and
   species richness, distinct hoverfly communities are associated with
   marshy grasslands, agriculturally improved marshy grasslands, and
   unimproved dry grasslands, but not with improved dry grasslands.
   Grassland plant community cannot be used as a proxy for pollinator
   community. Management of grasslands should aim to maximize the
   pollinator feeding resource, as well as maintain plant communities.
   Retaining waterlogged ground may enhance the number of hoverflies with
   semiaquatic larvae.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators such as bees and hoverflies are essential components of an
   urban ecosystem, supporting and contributing to the biodiversity,
   functioning, resilience and visual amenity of green infrastructure.
   Their urban habitats also deliver health and well-being benefits to
   society, by providing important opportunities for accessing nature
   nearby to the homes of a growing majority of people living in towns and
   cities. However, many pollinator species are in decline, and the loss,
   degradation and fragmentation of natural habitats are some of the key
   drivers of this change. Urban planners and other practitioners need
   evidence to carefully prioritise where they focus their resources to
   provide and maintain a high quality, multifunctional green
   infrastructure network that supports pollinators and people. We provide
   a modelling framework to inform green infrastructure planning as a
   nature based solution with social and ecological benefits. We show how
   habitat suitability models (I-ISM) incorporating remote sensed
   vegetation data can provide important information on the influence of
   urban landcover composition and spatial configuration on species
   distributions across cities. Using Edinburgh, Scotland, as a case study
   city, we demonstrate this approach for bumble bees and hoverflies,
   providing high resolution predictive maps that identify pollinator
   habitat hotspots and pinch points across the city. By combining this
   spatial HSM output with health deprivation data, we highlight `win-win'
   opportunity areas in most need of improved green infrastructure to
   support pollinator habitat quality and connectivity, as well as societal
   health and well-being. In addition, in collaboration with municipal
   planners, local stakeholders, and partners from a local greenspace
   learning alliance, we identified opportunities for citizen engagement
   activities to encourage interest in wildlife gardening as part of a
   `pollinator pledge'. We conclude that this quantitative, spatially
   explicit and transferable approach provides a useful decision-making
   tool for targeting nature-based solutions to improve biodiversity and
   increase environmental stewardship, with the aim of providing a more
   attractive city to live, work and invest in.}},

   received a lot of attention in the literature, surface areas of animals

   area-volume (SA/V) ratios for the first time using 3D surface models
   based on a structured light scanning method for 126 species of
   pollinating insects from 4 orders (Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera,
   and Coleoptera). Water loss of 67 species was measured gravimetrically
   at very dry conditions for 2 h at 15 and 30 degrees C to demonstrate the
   applicability of the new 3D surface measurements and relevance for
   predicting the performance of insects. Quantified SA/V ratios
   significantly explained the variation in water loss across species, both
   directly or after accounting for isometric scaling (residuals of the
   SA/V approximate to mass(2/3) relationship). Small insects with a
   proportionally larger surface area had the highest water loss rates.
   Surface scans of insects to quantify allometric SA/V ratios thus provide
   a promising method to predict physiological responses, improving the

Abstract = {{Context Abandonment of extensively managed meadows is an ongoing global
   challenge in recent decades, particularly in mountain regions, and
   directly affects plant diversity. However, the extent to which plant
   diversity further affects associated insect pollinators or herbivores is
   little investigated.
   Objectives We focused on the effects of abandonment of mountain meadows
   on species richness and assemblages of bumblebees, bugs and
   grasshoppers. Specifically, we investigated the influence of vegetation
   cover, flower cover, plant richness and surrounding landscape on the
   three insect groups.
   Methods Species richness, abundance and species assemblages of
   bumblebees, bugs and grasshoppers were surveyed in one Swiss and two
   Austrian regions: three meadows which had been abandoned for 15-60
   years, and three extensively managed meadows (mown once a year, no use
   of fertilizers). We surveyed bumblebees and bugs by sweep net, and
   grasshoppers using the time-effective soundscape approach.
   Results Bumblebee species richness and abundance were significantly
   higher in managed meadows, whereas bug and grasshopper richness and
   abundance showed no differences between both management types. Managed
   and abandoned meadows harboured significantly different species
   assemblages of bugs and grasshoppers, but not of bumblebees. Increasing
   flower cover and plant richness increased bumblebee richness, but
   correlated negatively with richness of bugs. Surrounding open landscape
   positively affected bugs. Caelifera positively correlated with
   surrounding forest cover and negatively with vegetation cover.
   Vegetation cover positively affected Ensifera.
   Conclusions Abandoned and extensively managed meadows are important
   habitat types for the conservation of the three insect groups, thus
   suggesting the maintenance of both habitat types within mountain
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite close ecological interactions between plants and their
   pollinators, only some highly specialised pollinators adapt to a
   specific host plant trait by evolving a bizarre morphology. Here we
   investigated the evolution of extremely elongated forelegs in females of
   the South African bee genus Rediviva (Hymenoptera: Melittidae), in which
   long forelegs are hypothesised to be an adaptation for collecting oils
   from the extended spurs of their Diascia host flowers. We first
   reconstructed the phylogeny of the genus Rediviva using seven genes and
   inferred an origin of Rediviva at around 29 MYA (95\% HPD = 19.2-40.5),
   concurrent with the origin and radiation of the Succulent Karoo flora.
   The common ancestor of Rediviva was inferred to be a short-legged
   species that did not visit Diascia. Interestingly, all our analyses
   strongly supported at least two independent origins of long legs within
   Rediviva. Leg length was not correlated with any variable we tested
   (ecological specialisation, Diascia visitation, geographic distribution,
   pilosity type) but seems to have evolved very rapidly. Overall, our
   results indicate that foreleg length is an evolutionary highly labile,
   rapidly evolving trait that might enable Rediviva bees to respond
   quickly to changing floral resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{Angiosperm flowers have evolved a dazzling palette of colours and a rich
   bouquet of scents, principally serving to attract pollinators. Despite
   recent progress in the ecology of pollination, the sensory floral traits
   that are important for communication with pollinators (for example,
   colour and scent) have not been assessed in an unbiased, integrative
   sense within a community context. Nonetheless, floral sensory stimuli
   are known key factors that mediate flower visitation, thus affecting
   community dynamics. Here we show that flowers of the phrygana, a natural
   Mediterranean scrubland, display integrated patterns of scent
   composition and colour (as perceived by pollinators). Surprisingly, the
   data reveal predictive relationships between patterns of volatile
   composition and flower reflectance spectra. The presence of nectar is
   related to visual cues and the qualitative composition of floral aromas.
   Our results reveal a coordinated phenotypic integration consistent with
   the sensory abilities and perceptual biases of bees, suggesting
   potential facilitative effects for pollination and highlighting the
   fundamental importance of bees in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. We
   offer our unbiased approach as a starting point for more extensive,
   global investigations of the diversity of floral sensory phenotypes and
   its role in the community ecology of plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained pollinator services within coffee farms depend substantially
   on a diverse bee community. While studies have been conducted to
   understand the impacts of forest proximity and farm level management on
   pollinators, few have examined the interaction between these two spatial
   scales. We surveyed pollinator communities within 18 sites on a large
   organic farm surrounded by native forest in southern Costa Rica. We
   selected sites 0, 50 and 150 m from the forest edge within shaded and
   sparsely-shaded (sun) portions of the farm to quantify the influence of
   both shade management and distance to contiguous forest on pollinator
   communities. Contrary to similar studies, native bees dominated the
   composition of pollinators on this farm. Overall, pollinator diversity
   and activity did not differ significantly neither between the shade
   management types nor among the sites 0, 50 or 150 m from the forest
   edge. However, pollinator diversity was found to be significantly higher
   at sun sites near forest (0 m) compared with further away, whereas the
   diversity was the same for the shade sites regardless of forest
   proximity. We found that greater numbers of coffee flowers within each
   site increased bee abundance and flower visitation frequency. Bee
   abundance was greater in sites with less ground cover and bee diversity
   and visitation frequencies were higher in sites with greater amounts of
   shade canopy cover and trees in flower. Based on our results, we suggest
   including flowering shade trees that provide high levels of canopy
   cover, maintaining or re-establishing forested areas within or
   surrounding farms, and eliminating or reducing agrochemical use to
   increase native pollinator activity and diversity within coffee farms.}},

Title = {{Does competition with wind-pollinated species alter Echium
   plantagineum's attractiveness to a common pollinator Bombus terrestris?}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{1. In insect-pollinated plants, pollinator attraction is influenced by
   flowers (e.g. number, size) and their associated rewards (e.g. pollen,
   nectar). These traits can depend on plant interactions. Indeed,
   below-ground competition between plants can lead to a decrease in flower
   or reward production in insect-pollinated species.
   2. Wind-pollinated plants, in particular, which are almost never studied
   in plant pollinator networks, can alter insect-pollinated plants'
   attractiveness through competition for nutrients. The response of
   pollinators to such changes has never been investigated.
   3. A pot experiment was carried out in which an insect-pollinated
   species, Echium plantagineum, was grown in binary mixture with three
   wind-pollinated species selected to exert a panel of competitive
   interactions. Below-ground competition was controlled using dividers
   limiting interspecific root competition. Floral traits of E.
   plantugineum (i.e. flower production, floral display size, flower size
   and nectar production) were measured. For each species mixture, the
   visits (i.e. first visit, number of visits, 10-min sequences) of Bombus
   terrestris individuals released in a flight cage containing two pots
   were followed, one with and one without below-ground competition.
   4. Below-ground competition significantly affected nectar's sucrose
   concentration but did not influence flower and nectar production.
   Likewise, pollinator visits were not influenced by below-ground
   competition. Competitor identity significantly influenced flower and
   reward production of E. plantagineum, with a decrease in the presence of
   the most competitive wind-pollinated species. A tendency for faster
   flower visitation events was also detected in the presence of the least
   competitive competitor. This study raises new questions regarding the
   influence of wind-pollinated plants on plant pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Tropane alkaloids are known to play a role in plant defence.
   By blocking acetylcholine receptors, they exert insecticidal and
   deterrent effects against herbivore insects. Carbamates are an important
   class of chemical insecticides that also inhibit acetyl cholinesterase.
   The objective of this work was to synthesise a series of tropane
   alkaloids bearing a carbamate group, and to evaluate their effects
   against the pest Ascia monuste. The effects of the most active compounds
   were evaluated on the A. monuste predator Solenopsis saevissima and on
   the pollinator Tetragonisca angustula.
   RESULTS: The synthesis of carbamate-tropane alkaloids was accomplished
   in 4-5 steps from commercially available ketones. Results from bioassays
   showed that compounds 6a, 10a and 14a presented higher activities
   against second-instar larvae of A. monuste, with LD50 values of 1.01,
   3.76 and 1.92 mu g substance mg(-1) insect, and TL50 values of 7.0, 15.0
   and 5.0h respectively. These compounds were also tested for their
   selectivity in favour of S. saevissima and T. angustula. Compound 6a,
   which showed the highest activity against A. monuste, also showed lower
   toxicity against S. saevissima.
   CONCLUSION: Tropane alkaloid derivatives bearing a carbamate group show
   potential for the development of novel insecticides against A. monuste.

Abstract = {{Climate change will cause geographic range shifts for pollinators and
   major crops, with global implications for food security and rural
   livelihoods. However, little is known about the potential for coupled
   impacts of climate change on pollinators and crops. Coffee production
   exemplifies this issue, because large losses in areas suitable for
   coffee production have been projected due to climate change and because
   coffee production is dependent on bee pollination. We modeled the
   potential distributions of coffee and coffee pollinators under current
   and future climates in Latin America to understand whether future
   coffee-suitable areas will also be suitable for pollinators. Our results
   suggest that coffeesuitable areas will be reduced 73-88\% by 2050 across
   warming scenarios, a decline 46-76\% greater than estimated by global
   assessments. Mean bee richness will decline 8-18\% within future
   coffee-suitable areas, but all are predicted to contain at least 5 bee
   species, and 46-59\% of future coffee-suitable areas will contain 10 or
   more species. In our models, coffee suitability and bee richness each
   increase (i.e., positive coupling) in 10-22\% of future coffee-suitable
   areas. Diminished coffee suitability and bee richness (i.e., negative
   coupling), however, occur in 34-51\% of other areas. Finally, in 31-33\%
   of the future coffee distribution areas, bee richness decreases and
   coffee suitability increases. Assessing coupled effects of climate
   change on crop suitability and pollination can help target appropriate
   management practices, including forest conservation, shade adjustment,
   crop rotation, or status quo, in different regions.}},

Abstract = {{Production of insect-pollinated crops typically relies on both pesticide
   use and pollination, leading to a potential conflict between these two
   inputs. In this paper we combine ecological modelling with economic
   analysis to investigate the effects of pesticide use on wild and
   commercial bees, whilst allowing farmers to partly offset the negative
   effects of pesticides on bee populations by creating more on-farm bee
   habitat. Farmers have incentives to invest in creating wild bee habitat
   to increase pollination inputs due to the contribution this makes to
   yields. However, the optimal allocation of on-farm habitat strongly
   depends on the negative effects of pesticides, with a threshold-like
   behaviour at a critical level of the impairment. When this threshold is
   crossed, the population of wild bees becomes locally extinct and their
   availability to pollinate breaks down. We show that availability of
   commercial bees masks this decrease in pollination services which would
   otherwise incentivise farmers to conserve the wild pollinator
   population. Indeed, if commercial bees are available, optimum profit may
   be achieved by providing no habitat at all for wild bees, and allowing
   these wild pollinators to go extinct. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Adaptation is evolution in response to natural selection. Hence, an
   adaptation is expected to originate simultaneously with the acquisition
   of a particular selective environment. Here we test whether long legs
   evolve in oil-collecting Rediviva bees when they come under selection by
   long-spurred, oil-secreting flowers. To quantify the selective
   environment, we drew a large network of the interactions between
   Rediviva species and oil-secreting plant species. The selective
   environment of each bee species was summarized as the average spur
   length of the interacting plant species weighted by interaction
   frequency. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we calculated
   divergence in selective environment and evolutionary divergence in leg
   length between sister species (and sister clades) of Rediviva. We found
   that change in the selective environment explained 80\% of evolutionary
   change in leg length, with change in body size contributing an
   additional 6\% of uniquely explained variance. The result is one of four
   proposed steps in testing for plant-pollinator coevolution.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (PEBP) family is a highly
   conserved group of proteins found in a wide range of organism. It plays
   an important role in innate immunity of insects. Little is known on the
   expression characteristic and function of PEBP in bees. In the current
   study, we cloned the pebp gene and investigated its expression profiles
   at different developmental stages and reproductive status from
   bumblebee, Bombus lantschouensis (Vogt), which is one of the most
   abundant pollinators for wild plants and crops in Northern China. Two
   transcripts (PEBPX1 and PEBPX2) of the pebp gene were cloned for the
   first time. The transcript PEBPX2 lacked a signal peptide sequence
   compared to PEBPX1. The full-length cDNA of these two PEBP transcripts
   is 1005 bp and 915 bp, with an open reading frame of 627 bp and 549 bp,
   respectively. Transcript PEBPX2 was one order of magnitude more
   expressed than transcript PEBPX1 at most of the developmental stages and
   different reproductive status (egg-laying versus non- egg-laying
   females). Both of the PEBP transcripts were highly expressed in
   brown-eyed with light and dark pigmented cuticle pupae stages.
   Quantitative PCR and Western Blot demonstrated that PEBP was
   significantly up-regulated in egg-laying females. In summary, we suggest
   that levels of these two PEBPs could be related to the regulation of
   reproduction in bumblebees. In addition, both transcripts likely play an
   important role in the metamorphosis developmental stage of bumblebee
   pupae.}},

Title = {{Urbanization alters communities of flying arthropods in parks and
   gardens of a medium-sized city}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization transforms undeveloped landscapes into built environments,
   causing changes in communities and ecological processes. Flying
   arthropods play important roles in these processes as pollinators,
   decomposers, and predators, and can be important in structuring food
   webs. The goal of this study was to identify associations between
   urbanization and the composition of communities of flying (and floating)
   arthropods within gardens and parks in a medium-sized mesic city. We
   predicted that flying arthropod abundance and diversity would respond
   strongly to percent impervious surface and distance to city center,
   measurements of urbanization. Flying arthropods were sampled from 30
   gardens and parks along an urbanization gradient in Toledo, Ohio, during
   July and August 2016, using elevated pan traps. A variety of potential
   predictor variables were also recorded at each site. We collected a
   total of 2,369 individuals representing nine orders. We found that
   flying arthropod community composition was associated with percent
   impervious surface and canopy cover. Overall flying arthropod abundance
   was negatively associated with percent impervious surface and positively
   associated with distance to city center. Hymenoptera (bees, wasps,
   ants), Lepidoptera (moths, butterflies), and Araneae (spiders) were
   positively associated with distance to city center. Hemiptera (true
   bugs), Diptera (flieS), and Araneae were negatively associated with',
   percent impervious surface. Both distance to city center and percent
   impervious surface are metrics of urbanization, and this study shows how
   these factors influence flying arthropod communities in urban gardens
   and city parks, including significant reductions in taxa that contain
   pollinators and predators important to urban agriculture and forestry. A
   variety of environmental factors also showed significant associations
   with responses (e.g. canopy cover and soil moisture), suggesting these
   factors may underlie or modulate the urbanization effects. More research
   is needed to determine mechanisms of change.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decades, managed honeybee stocks have increased
   globally. Managed honeybees are particularly used within mass-flowering
   crops and often spill over to adjacent natural habitats after crop
   blooming. Here, we uniquely show the simultaneous impact that honeybee
   spillover has on wild plant and animal communities in flower-rich
   woodlands via changes in plant-pollinator network structure that
   translate into a direct negative effect on the reproductive success of a
   dominant wild plant. Honeybee spillover leads to a re-assembly of
   plant-pollinator interactions through increased competition with other
   pollinator species. Moreover, honeybee preference for the most abundant
   plant species reduces its seed set, driven by high honeybee visitation
   rates that prevent pollen tube growth. Our study therefore calls for an
   adequate understanding of the trade-offs between providing pollination
   services to crops and the effects that managed pollinators might have on
   wild plants and pollinators.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to estimate contribution of animal pollinators toward
   Indian agriculture, 211 crops (190 crops and 21 commodities) were
   analyzed using primary data. Production of 108 (51.2\%) crops is
   dependent on animal pollination, 59 (28.0\%) did not rely on it and for
   44 (20.9\%) information is not available. Among 108 crops, pollinator
   dependence was essential for 14 crops (6.6\%, in absence 90-100\%
   reduction in production occurs), great for 34 (16.1\%), moderate for 29
   (13.7\%) and little for 31 (14.7\%) crops. Rapeseed and mustard is the
   most pollinator dependent crop with an estimated economic value of
   pollination (EVP) of (sic) 19355.70 crores. Cotton, apple, citrus,
   guava, tomato, brinjal, chillies, okra, cumin, coriander, soybean are
   few of a large numbers of crops benefitted hugely by pollinators.
   Oilseeds greatly depend on insect pollination with 34.07\% contribution
   to yield and resultant economic value of pollination (EVP) is estimated
   at (sic) 43993.08 crores from their total economic value (EV) of (sic)
   129030.05 crores. Fruits follow with 14.82\% ((sic) 17095.45 crores)
   economic value mostly for 12 major fruits. Value of pollination from
   vegetables is (sic) 19498.20 crores (11.10\%), fibers (mainly cotton)
   (sic) 17290.66 crores (23.39\%) and condiments and spices at (sic)
   10109.43 crores (25.47\%). Huge research and information gap exists for
   these crops in India. Of the total value of Indian agriculture ((sic)
   1291369.63 crores at 2012-13 prices or USD 258.27 billion), proportion
   of animal pollinated crops is (sic) 422827.52 crores (\$ 84.57 billion),
   representing 32.74\%. Direct contribution of insect pollination to
   Indian agriculture is staggering (sic) 112615.73 crores (USD 22.52
   billion) annually, representing 8.72\%, besides spill over benefits of
   increase in quality traits, seed production, breeding efficiency, etc.
   For stagnant Indian agriculture, this ``micro concept{''} of using honey
   bees for planned pollination of crops has the potential
   ``macro-economic{''} impact.}},

Abstract = {{The plants of Malpighiaceae are diverse and produce specific floral
   resources that provide a parameter of habitat quality for oil-collecting
   bees. We studied three species of Malpighiaceae from the Brazilian
   savannah, Banisteriopsis campestris, B. malifolia and Peixotoa
   tomentosa, and investigated (I) the quantitative and qualitative
   composition of floral resources and (II) the temporal distribution of
   floral visitors according to plant phenology. We used gas chromatography
   and mass spectrometry to determine the chemical composition of floral
   oil. We also quantified pollen weight and oil volume, and registered
   floral visitors and plant phenology. The floral resources varied
   quantitatively and qualitatively among plant species. The 31 observed
   bee species showed different preferences for the plant species, which
   also were related to reproductive periods and floral resources of the
   plants. According to sequential flowering of co-occurring species of
   Malpighiaceae, we argue that the qualitative and quantitative similarity
   of floral resources (oil and pollen) and their availability for bees
   throughout the year, benefits these interactions between plants and
   bees. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{234}},
Pages = {{195-206}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We studied the breeding system and pollination biology of Cattleya
   coccinea, C. intermedia, C. purpurata and C. tigrina in native
   populations from Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. At the State level,
   the three latter species are considered under risk of extinction and
   this work is intended to be a contribution towards their conservation
   and management. To date, their pollination needs and breeding system
   remain unknown.
   Breeding system was elucidated through controlled pollinations applied
   to isolated plants. Pollination was studied in the field, by means of
   photographic and filmic records. Cattleya purpurata, C. intermedia and
   C. tigrina are pollinated by large native Apidae bees of the genera
   Bombus, Xylocopa and Epicharis that bear the pollinaria on the scutellum
   and mesonotum. In spite of their differences in colour and perianth
   size, bee-pollinated species share a number of flower features which are
   absent in C. coccinea. The latter species is pollinated by the
   hummingbird Chlorostilbon lucidus (Trochilidae). In agreement, flowers
   of C. coccinea present a set of flower features normally associated to
   ornithophily. All studied species lack rewards and deceive their
   food-seeking pollinators. All species are self-compatible but pollinator
   dependent. Fruiting success following manual self-pollination and
   cross-pollination did not differ, except in C. coccinea. However, in all
   species fruit from cross-pollinations yielded significantly higher
   numbers of viable seed. All studied species displayed low visitation
   rates, low natural fruit set (ranging from 0.5 to 14\%) and Nilsson's
   male efficiency factor of less than one, indicating that less than one
   flower was pollinated per pollinarium removed.
   All these features are consistent with those of other orchid groups
   pollinated through generalized food-deception. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Title = {{Diversity of Diptera families that pollinate Ceropegia (Apocynaceae)
   trap flowers: An update in light of new data and phylogenetic analyses}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{234}},
Pages = {{233-244}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pollination by flies (Diptera) has been important to the diversification
   and ecology of the flowering plants, but is poorly understood in
   contrast to pollination by other groups such as bees, butterflies and
   birds. Within the Apocynaceae the genera Ceropegia and Riocreuxia
   temporarily trap flies, releasing them after a fixed, species-specific
   period of time, during which pollination and/or pollen removal occurs.
   This ``trap flower{''} pollination system shows convergent evolution
   with unrelated species in other families and fascinated Stefan Vogel for
   much of his career, leading to ground-breaking work on floral function
   in Ceropegia( Apocynaceae). In this new study we extend the work of the
   latest broad analysis published by some of the authors (Ollerton et al.,
   2009 - Annals of Botany). This incorporates previously unpublished data
   from India and Africa, as well as recently published information, on the
   diversity of pollinators exploited by Ceropegia. The analyses are based
   on a more accurate phylogenetic understanding of the relationships
   between the major groups, and significantly widens the biogeographic
   scope of our understanding of fly pollination within Ceropegia.
   Information about the pollinators of 69 taxa (species, subspecies and
   natural varieties) of Ceropegia is now available. Twenty five families
   of Diptera are known to visit the flowers of Ceropegia, of which sixteen
   are confirmed as pollinators. Most taxa are pollinated by species from a
   single family. Overall, there were no major biogeographic differences in
   the types of Diptera that were used in particular regions, though some
   subtle differences were apparent. Likewise there were no differences

Abstract = {{Demand, supply and value of insect pollination for the swiss
   agricultural production For some field crops, and especially fruits and
   berries, harvested yield quantity and quality are dependent on
   pollination by insects. According to global estimates, honeybees and
   wild bees contribute equally to this ecosystem service, although there
   are no systematic studies for Switzerland. Now, for the first time, and
   with the help of data on the area and distribution of insect dependent
   crops and their yields, the direct economic value for Switzerland of
   pollination services was calculated, and shown to range between CHF 205
   and 479 million per year. In Switzerland, pollination-dependent crops
   are cultivated on approx. 5 \% of the utilised agricultural area and 14
   \% of the arable land. On a nationwide average, the potential spatial
   coverage of these crops by honeybees is relatively good. Particularly on
   the western Central Plateau and in the Valais, however, coverage is
   patchy. Whether this leads to yield losses owing to pollination
   deficits, and whether and how the targeted support of naturally
   occurring wild bees or the use of additional honeybees and managed wild
   bees contributes to a better pollination outcome, will require further
   investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Burnings and deforestation are severe disturbances to plants and may
   represent a stressful situation for plant growth, and they can also
   affect plant-pollinator interactions and the reproductive success of
   plants. In this study, we verified the variation in floral symmetry of
   Adenocalymma nodosum (Bignoniacea) in two areas, one post-fire and other
   after deforestation. We also verified the effects on plant-pollinator
   interactions and fruit set production. Results showed that A. nodosum
   flowers were more asymmetric in mowing areas than in fire areas.
   Asymmetrical flowers presented low nectar concentration and bee
   visitation rates. Although mowed environments produce fewer fruits and
   seeds than areas affected by fire, the change was not significant. Soil
   from the burnt area showed higher nutrient and organic matter
   concentration and less aluminum than that of mowed areas. Our results
   showed that A. nodosum flowers in the deforestation area are more
   asymmetric than those in the post-fire area. This result suggest that
   Cerrado plants may be less adapted to deforestation than to fire, since
   they have been facing fire events for thousand years in this biome. We
   suggest that the effects of environmental stress on the development and
   fitness of plants may provide an important breakthrough to the
   understanding of insect-plant interactions in Cerrado savanna, where
   burnings and deforestation are frequent anthropogenic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees (Hymenoptera: Apidae: Euglossini) are a diverse and
   important group of Neotropical pollinators. Numerous chemicals have been
   used in sampling orchid bees, and species-specific attraction,
   particularly of males, to these chemicals is well known. However, there
   have been few studies that have quantified differences in the species
   composition of orchid bees attracted to particular chemicals. In this
   study, we compared the abundance and species composition of orchid bees
   collected with 4 commonly used attractants: benzyl acetate, eucalyptol
   (or cineole), eugenol, and methyl salicylate. Eucalyptol collected the
   greatest abundance and species richness of orchid bees. Indicator
   species analysis revealed that 3 species, Euglossa imperialis Cockerell,
   Euglossa obtusa Dressler, and Eufriesea mexicana (Mocsary), were
   significantly associated with eucalyptol, and 1, Eulaema marcii Nemesio,
   with benzyl acetate. The multi-response permutation procedure revealed
   relatively large differences in species composition of orchid bees
   collected with eucalyptol vs. benzyl acetate and eucalyptol vs. eugenol.
   Our results showed that eucalyptol and benzyl acetate were the most
   effective and complimentary attractants, but even less effective
   attractants such as eugenol may attract novel species.}},

Abstract = {{Yellow crazy ant (Anoplolepis gracilipes (F. Smith); ``YCA{''}) is known
   for its aggressive predatory ability and ability to exert exploitation
   competition on both native and other invasive ants via floral nectar. We
   argue that YCA invasion can exert both interference and exploitation
   competition on legitimate pollinators. In pumpkin fields (Cucurbita
   maxima L.) of south India, YCA infested the flowers, particularly the
   pistillate flowers, for nectar foraging. Pumpkin is a honey bee-mediated
   cross-pollinated monoecious plant that produces disproportionately very
   few pistillate flowers. We hypothesize that YCA presence in the flowers
   can affect the visitation rate and foraging time of honey bees in the
   flowers, the fruit set in pumpkins, and can exert predatory pressure on
   the honey bees if the bees linger in ant-colonized flowers. Both YCA and
   honey bees preferred to forage on the limited pistillate flowers in the
   plants. After colonizing the flowers, YCA did not retreat for hours,
   even upon disturbance by competitors, such as honey bees. Both the
   visitation frequency and the foraging time of honey bees were
   drastically reduced in ant-colonized flowers, and none of the
   ant-colonized flowers developed into fruits, suggesting that the YCA
   exert both an ecological and evolutionary pressure on pumpkin. The ants
   preyed upon about 17\% of the honey bees that lingered in ant-colonized
   flowers, and the time the bees spent foraging predicted the fate of the
   bees. Exploitation competition exerted by the YCA on pumpkin may have
   far-reaching consequences for the pollination and productivity of this
   cash crop.}},

Abstract = {{Under climate change, shrubs encroaching into high altitude plant
   communities disrupt ecosystem processes. Yet effects of encroachment on
   pollination mutualisms are poorly understood. Here, we probe potential
   fitness impacts of interference from encroaching Salix (willows) on
   pollination quality of the alpine skypilot, Polemonium viscosum. Overlap
   in flowering time of Salix and Polemonium is a precondition for
   interference and was surveyed in four extant and 25 historic contact
   zones. Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow
   pollen on bumble bees visiting Polemonium flowers and on Polemonium
   pistils. We probed fitness effects of pollinator sharing by measuring
   the correlation between Salix pollen contamination and seed set in
   naturally pollinated Polemonium. To ascertain whether Salix interference
   occurred during or after pollination, we compared seed set under natural
   pollination, conspecific pollen addition, and Salix pollen addition. In
   current and past contact zones Polemonium and Salix overlapped in
   flowering time. After accounting for variance in flowering date due to
   latitude, Salix and Polemonium showed similar advances in flowering
   under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that sensitivity to
   temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species. Salix
   pollen is carried by bumble bees when visiting Polemonium flowers and
   accounts for up to 25\% of the grains on Polemonium pistils. Salix
   contamination correlates with reduced seed set in nature and when
   applied experimentally. Postpollination processes likely mediate these
   deleterious effects as seed set in nature was not limited by pollen
   delivery. Synthesis: As willows move higher with climate change, we
   predict that they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the
   fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for Polemonium and selecting
   for traits that reduce pollinator sharing.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of pollinator attraction is predicted to strongly
   influence both plant diversification and the extent of pollinator
   sharing between species. Sexually deceptive orchids rely on mimicry of
   species-specific sex pheromones to attract their insect pollinators.
   Given that sex pheromones tend to be conserved among related species, we
   predicted that in sexually deceptive orchids, (i) pollinator sharing is
   rare, (ii) closely related orchids use closely related pollinators and
   (iii) there is strong bias in the wasp lineages exploited by orchids. We
   focused on species that are pollinated by sexual deception of thynnine
   wasps in the distantly related genera Caladenia and Drakaea, including
   new field observations for 45 species of Caladenia. Specialization was
   extreme with most orchids using a single pollinator species.
   Unexpectedly, seven cases of pollinator sharing were found, including
   two between Caladenia and Drakaea, which exhibit strikingly different
   floral morphology. Phylogenetic analysis of pollinators using four
   nuclear sequence loci demonstrated that although orchids within major
   clades primarily use closely related pollinator species, up to 17\% of
   orchids within these clades are pollinated by a member of a
   phylogenetically distant wasp genus. Further, compared to the total
   diversity of thynnine wasps within the study region, orchids show a
   strong bias towards exploiting certain genera. Although these patterns
   may arise through conservatism in the chemical classes used in sex
   pheromones, apparent switches between wasp clades suggest unexpected
   flexibility in floral semiochemical production. Alternatively, wasp sex
   pheromones within lineages may exhibit greater chemical diversity than
   currently appreciated.}},

Title = {{Railway lines affect spatial turnover of pollinator communities in an

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Landscape composition and spatial configuration of habitat patches
   are important determinants of biodiversity in fragmented semi-natural
   habitats spread across agricultural landscapes. However, little
   attention has been paid to man-made structures that can moderate spatial
   processes affecting pollinator communities. In a large-scale study, we
   explored the importance of railway embankments for the turnover of
   pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Because species differ in
   vulnerability to landscape composition and patch configuration, we also
   accounted for body size as well as food specialization of pollinators.
   Location: Krakow area, Poland.
   Methods: We sampled pollinating insects (bees, butterflies and
   hoverflies), at 25 study sites located along railway lines in the region
   of Krakow, Poland. Control grasslands for the embankments included 19
   patches, located among crop fields, in which pollinators were sampled.
   We assessed the relationships between dissimilarity and distance for
   bee, butterfly and hoverfly trait groups on embankments and grasslands
   using Moran's Eigenvector Maps.
   Results: The dissimilarity for food-non-specialized bees on embankments
   was spatially structured: sites that were closer together were also less
   dissimilar in their community composition than more distant ones.
   Dissimilarity was also spatially aligned for large-bodied butterflies
   and hoverflies on embankments. The species dissimilarity of pollinators
   divided into trait-based groups was not spatially structured on
   grasslands.
   Main conclusion: Our study highlights the potential function of railway
   embankments as corridors for at least some pollinator populations.
   Landscape managers should include railways in green networks to improve
   spatial processes linked with the distribution and turnover of
   pollinator species in agricultural landscapes. Thus, railway embankments
   and their correct management may be a good example of man-made
   alterations in the environment that meet the demands of both
   civilization and biodiversity conservation.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of bee abundance and diversity across different spatial scales
   have received thorough research consideration. However, the impact of
   short-and long-term temporal resource availability on biodiversity has
   been less explored. This is highly relevant in tropical agricultural
   systems for pollinators, as many foraging periods of pollinators extend
   beyond flowering of any single crop species. In this study, we sought to
   understand how bee communities in tropical agroecosystems changed
   between seasons, and if short-and long-term floral resource availability
   influenced their diversity and abundance. We used a threshold analysis
   approach in order to explore this relationship at two time scales. This
   study took place in a region dominated by coffee agroecosystems in
   Southern Mexico. This was an ideal system because the landscape offers a
   range of coffee management regimes that maintain heterogeneity in floral
   resource availability spatially and temporally. We found that the bee
   community varies significantly between seasons. There were higher
   abundances of native social, solitary and managed honey bees during the
   dry season when coffee flowers. Additionally, we found that floral
   resources from groundcover, but not trees, were associated with bee
   abundance. Further, the temporal scale of the availability of these
   resources is important, whereby short-term floral resource availability
   appears particularly important in maintaining high bee abundance at
   sites with lower seasonal complementarity. We argue that in addition to
   spatial resource heterogeneity, temporal resource heterogeneity is
   critical in explaining bee community patterns, and should thus be
   considered to promote pollinator conservation.}},

Title = {{Foraging strategy predicts foraging economy in a facultative secondary
   nectar robber}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1250-1257}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In mutualistic interactions, the decision whether to cooperate or cheat
   depends on the relative costs and benefits of each strategy. In
   pollination mutualisms, secondary nectar robbing is a facultative
   behavior employed by a diverse array of nectar-feeding organisms, and is
   thought to be a form of cheating. Primary robbers create holes in floral
   tissue through which they feed on nectar, whereas secondary robbers,
   which often lack chewing mouthparts, feed on nectar through existing
   holes. Because primary robbers make nectar more readily available to
   secondary robbers, primary robbers facilitate the behaviors of secondary
   robbers. However, the net effect of facilitation on secondary robber
   fitness has not been empirically tested: it is unknown whether the
   benefit secondary robbers receive is strong enough to overcome the cost
   of competing with primary robbers for a shared resource. We conducted
   foraging experiments using the bumble bee Bombus bifarius, which can
   alternatively forage legitimately' (from the floral opening) or
   secondary-rob. We measured the relative foraging efficiencies (handling
   time per flower, flowers visited per minute, proportion of foraging bout
   spent consuming nectar) of these alternative behaviors, and tested
   whether the frequency of primary robbing and nectar standing crop in
   primary-robbed flowers of Linaria vulgaris (Plantaginaceae) affected
   foraging efficiency. Surprisingly, there was no effect of primary
   robbing frequency on the foraging efficiency of secondary-robbing B.
   bifarius. Instead, foraging strategy was a major predictor of foraging
   efficiency, with legitimate foraging being significantly more efficient
   than secondary robbing. Legitimate foraging was the more common strategy
   used by B. bifarius in our study; however, it is rarely used by B.
   bifarius foraging on L. vulgaris in nature, despite indications that it
   is more efficient. Our results suggest the need for deeper
   investigations into why bees adopt secondary robbing as a foraging
   strategy, specifically, the environmental contexts that promote the
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural field margins are often recommended as a cost-effective and
   efficient method for wild bee conservation, in response to the threat
   imposed by global pollinator declines as a result of intensive
   agricultural practices. In this study we compared margin characteristics
   and wild bee community structure from sites with landscapes of varying
   agricultural intensity in order to (i) investigate if field margins are
   valuable for wild bee conservation in all types of landscapes, and (ii)
   determine which biotic and abiotic margin characteristics best support
   wild bee abundance and community richness. Margin surveys and wild bee
   community sampling, comprising, pan traps and observations of foraging
   activity, were carried out over three years at 27 cereal field margins
   in Catalonia, Spain. Generalized `linear models indicated a strong
   inverse relationship between surrounding landscape diversity and wild
   bee abundance. The proportion of Halictidae bees (common generalists)
   increased with decreasing landscape complexity. Floral richness
   exhibited a positive association with number of foraging bees and
   morphospecies richness, and was positively correlated with the
   proportion of shrubs and trees represented in the margins. It was
   observed that wider margins held a higher proportion of perennial plants
   and a lower proportion of Halictidae bees. Our study suggests that field
   margins are more crucial in intensively farmed areas than in
   heterogeneous landscapes where foraging resources are more abundant.
   Maintaining wide margins with high flowering plant richness, comprising
   perennial and shrub species, best supports a dense and diverse bee
   community. In more diverse landscapes, conservation efforts focused on
   maintaining the quality of existing natural patches may be most
   effective.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification advocates the harnessing of regulating and
   supporting ecosystem services to promote more sustainable food
   production, and this relies on effective management of non-cropped
   habitats. Hedgerows are an important component of the landscape in many
   farming systems across the world, management of which provides a
   potential mechanism to enhance ecological intensification. Here we
   investigate the value of hedgerows in Southern England as a source of
   functionally important taxa, and how hedgerow quality and local
   landscape composition impact on their potential contribution to
   sustainable agriculture in arable landscapes. We show that hedgerows are
   a source habitat for many natural enemies which spill over into
   neighbouring fields, and that hedgerows provide a valuable forage
   resource and corridor for movement of pollinators. Hedgerow quality
   affects these benefits and continuous unbroken hedgerows, with a high
   diversity of woody species, are more valuable for the provision of
   bumblebees and Linyphiid spiders, while the presence of trees within the
   hedgerow supports Lycosid spiders. Floral resources, beyond the woody
   hedgerow species themselves, are also a key forage resource for
   hoverflies. The impact of these hedgerows on invertebrate abundance is
   moderated by local landscape, and hedgerows are a more valuable forage
   resource for pollinators in more intensely managed landscapes. Our study
   shows that in order to support abundant and a broad range of natural
   enemies and pollinators in agricultural landscapes, both hedgerows and
   local semi-natural habitats need to be protected and managed. The
   benefit of hedgerows, as a habitat for functionally important taxa
   depends on hedgerow quality and management practices such as avoiding
   gaps, high hedge species diversity and maintaining an abundant
   understory of plants, can improve their value for ecological
   intensification.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees (Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators in the Amazon
   forest. In eastern Brazilian Amazon, secondary forest and pastures are
   being replaced by oil palm plantations. Here, we tested the role of
   forest reserves and riparian corridors in maintaining orchid bees. We
   sampled bees in three different soil-type uses, comparing richness,
   abundance, and assemblage composition. Estimated richness was lowest in
   palm plantations than in forest reserves and riparian corridors on
   diversity of orchid bees. Riparian corridors had the highest abundance,
   followed by reserves, and oil palm plantations. Bee assemblage also
   varied with land cover, with the reserves having the most distinct
   composition. We also identified indicator bees for primary forest. Our
   results demonstrate riparian corridors and forest reserves can maintain
   orchid bees in oil palm landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Oblacinska' sour cherry, an autochthonous cultivar, is the most planted
   cultivar in Serbian orchards. Since fruit trees in temperate zone reward
   insects by producing nectar which `quality' affects the efficiency of
   insect pollination, the aim of this study was analyzing of sugars and
   polyphenolics in floral nectar of 16 `Oblacinska' sour cherry clones
   with different yielding potential. The contents of sugars and sugar
   alcohols were analyzed by ion chromatography, while polyphenolic profile
   was established using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry technique.
   Fourteen sugars and six sugar alcohols were detected in nectar samples
   and the most abundant were fructose, glucose, and sucrose. Eleven
   polyphenols were quantified using available standards, while another 17
   were identified according to their exact masses and characteristic
   fragmentations. Among quantified polyphenols, rutin, naringenin, and
   chrysin were the most abundant in nectar. Principal component analysis
   showed that some polyphenol components (naringin, naringenin, and rutin)
   together with sugars had high impact of spatial distribution of nectar
   samples on score plot.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},

Abstract = {{In the Neotropics, Ericaceae species occur mainly at high altitudes
   being adapted to pollination by bees or hummingbirds. These species are
   mainly self-compatible, a breeding commonly found at high altitudes.
   Agarista revoluta is an Ericaceae species that occurs in sandy coastal
   plains (restinga), a hot and dry lowland environment unusual for
   Ericaceae. This species has similar floral traits as other Ericaceae
   pollinated by bees. However, we do not know what reproductive strategies
   this plant use to deal with the extreme environment. We studied the
   floral biology, the breeding system and floral visitors of A. revoluta
   in the restinga. We found that the species is a generalist being visited
   by diurnal and nocturnal insects, and that the studied population
   presents a rare mixed breeding system, with both self-compatible and
   self-incompatible individuals. These results suggest that A. revoluta
   differs from other Ericaceae species from the Neotropics by presenting
   reproductive strategies (generalist pollination and mixed breeding
   system) that warrant their reproductive success in an unpredictable
   environment for pollination. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {{Getting More Power from Your Flowers: Multi-Functional Flower Strips
   Enhance Pollinators and Pest Control Agents in Apple Orchards}},
Journal = {{INSECTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Flower strips are commonly recommended to boost biodiversity and
   multiple ecosystem services (e.g., pollination and pest control) on
   farmland. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regards the extent
   to which they deliver on these aims. Here, we tested the efficacy of
   flower strips that targeted different subsets of beneficial arthropods
   (pollinators and natural enemies) and their ecosystem services in cider
   apple orchards. Treatments included mixes that specifically targeted:
   (1) pollinators ('concealed-nectar plants'); (2) natural enemies
   ('open-nectar plants'); or (3) both groups concurrently (i.e.,
   `multi-functional' mix). Flower strips were established in alleyways of
   four orchards and compared to control alleyways (no flowers). Pollinator
   (e.g., bees) and natural enemy (e.g., parasitoid wasps, predatory flies
   and beetles) visitation to flower strips, alongside measures of pest
   control (aphid colony densities, sentinel prey predation), and fruit
   production, were monitored in orchards over two consecutive growing
   seasons. Targeted flower strips attracted either pollinators or natural
   enemies, whereas mixed flower strips attracted both groups in similar
   abundance to targeted mixes. Natural enemy densities on apple trees were
   higher in plots containing open-nectar plants compared to other
   treatments, but effects were stronger for non-aphidophagous taxa.
   Predation of sentinel prey was enhanced in all flowering plots compared
   to controls but pest aphid densities and fruit yield were unaffected by
   flower strips. We conclude that `multi-functional' flower strips that
   contain flowering plant species with opposing floral traits can provide
   nectar and pollen for both pollinators and natural enemies, but further
   work is required to understand their potential for improving pest
   control services and yield in cider apple orchards.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion of modern agriculture has led to the loss and
   fragmentation of natural habitat, resulting in a global decline in
   biodiversity, including bees. In many countries, farmers can participate
   in cost-share programs to create natural habitat on their farms for the
   conservation of beneficial insects, such as bees. Despite their
   dependence on bee pollinators and the demonstrated commitment to
   environmental stewardship, participation in such programs by Wisconsin
   cranberry growers has been low. The objective of this study was to
   understand the barriers that prevent participation by Wisconsin
   cranberry growers in cost-share programs for on-farm conservation of
   native bees. We conducted a survey of cranberry growers (n = 250)
   regarding farming practices, pollinators, and conservation. Although
   only 10\% of growers were aware of federal pollinator cost-share
   programs, one third of them were managing habitat for pollinators
   without federal aid. Once informed of the programs, 50\% of growers
   expressed interest in participating. Fifty-seven percent of growers
   manage habitat for other wildlife, although none receive cost-share
   funding to do so. Participation in cost-share programs could benefit
   from outreach activities that promote the programs, a reduction of
   bureaucratic hurdles to participate, and technical support for growers
   on how to manage habitat for wild bees.}},

Journal = {{INSECTS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Forests provide potentially important bee habitat, but little research
   has been done on forest bee diversity and the relative effectiveness of
   bee sampling methods in this environment. Bee diversity and sampling
   methodology were studied in an Illinois, USA upland oak-hickory forest
   using elevated and ground-level pan traps, malaise traps, and vane
   traps. 854 bees and 55 bee species were collected. Elevated pan traps
   collected the greatest number of bees (473), but ground-level pan traps
   collected greater species diversity (based on Simpson's diversity index)
   than did elevated pan traps. Elevated and ground-level pan traps
   collected the greatest bee species richness, with 43 and 39 species,
   respectively. An estimated sample size increase of over 18-fold would be
   required to approach minimum asymptotic richness using ground-level pan
   traps. Among pan trap colors/elevations, elevated yellow pan traps
   collected the greatest number of bees (266) but the lowest diversity.
   Malaise traps were relatively ineffective, collecting only 17 bees. Vane
   traps collected relatively low species richness (14 species), and Chao1
   and abundance coverage estimators suggested that minimum asymptotic
   species richness was approached for that method. Bee species composition
   differed significantly between elevated pan traps, ground-level pan
   traps, and vane traps. Indicator species were significantly associated
   with each of these trap types, as well as with particular pan trap
   colors/elevations. These results indicate that Midwestern deciduous
   forests provide important bee habitat, and that the performance of
   common bee sampling methods varies substantially in this environment.}},

Abstract = {{Complex networks of species interactions are integral to the stability
   of ecological communities. The responses of these networks to extreme
   environmental fluctuations are key to understanding the evolution of
   these networks and their roles in stabilizing ecological communities.
   From 2008 to 2009 we observed the effects of extreme differences in
   annual precipitation on a network of plants and flower visiting insects
   in a xeric grassland. Significant decreases in plant and insect
   diversity in the dry year were mirrored by decreases in the number of
   network nodes and links. However, the relative density of network
   connections increased in the dry year and other important topological
   features, such as nestedness and modularity, were largely unchanged. The
   resilience of the network to node (plants or insect species) loss was
   high in both years. Though bees tend to dominate pollination communities
   in drier climes, we did not observe a shift in the relative richness of
   bee species in the dry year. Our results indicate that well-linked,
   drought-resistant plants are important to community resilience during
   ecologically challenging periods and that networks of plants and
   flowering-visiting insects may be robust to extreme climatic change, at
   least over short periods, as long as those critical, resilient hubs are
   protected. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are in global decline and agricultural pesticides are a
   potential driver of this. Recent studies have suggested that pesticides
   may significantly impact bumblebee colonies-an important and declining
   group of pollinators. Here, we show that colony-founding queens, a
   critical yet vulnerable stage of the bumblebee lifecycle, are less
   likely to initiate a colony after exposure to thiamethoxam, a
   neonicotinoid insecticide. Bombus terrestris queens were exposed to
   field-relevant levels of thiamethoxam and two natural stressors: the
   parasite Crithidia bombi and varying hibernation durations. Exposure to
   thiamethoxam caused a 26\% reduction in the proportion of queens that
   laid eggs, and advanced the timing of colony initiation, although we did
   not detect impacts of any experimental treatment on the ability of
   queens to produce adult offspring during the 14-week experimental
   period. As expected from previous studies, the hibernation duration also
   had an impact on egg laying, but there was no significant interaction
   with insecticide treatment. Modelling the impacts of a 26\% reduction in
   colony founding on population dynamics dramatically increased the
   likelihood of population extinction. This shows that neonicotinoids can
   affect this critical stage in the bumblebee lifecycle and may have
   significant impacts on population dynamics.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Studies have indicated that florivory and nectar robbing may reduce
   reproductive success of host plants. However, whether and how these
   effects might interact when plants are simultaneously attacked by both
   florivores and nectar robbers still needs further investigation.
   We used Iris bulleyana to detect the interactions among florivory,
   nectar robbing and pollination, and moreover, their effects on plant
   reproductive success. Field investigations and hand-pollination
   treatments were conducted on two experimental plots from a natural
   population, in which Experimental plot was protected from florivores and
   Control plot was not manipulated.
   The flower calyx was bitten by sawflies to consume the nectary, and
   three bumblebee species were pollinators. In addition, the short-tongued
   pollinator, Bombus friseanus, was the only robber when there was a hole
   made by a sawfly. The bumblebee had significantly shortened flower
   handling time when robbing, as compared to legitimate visits. Pollinator
   visitation and seed production decreased significantly in damaged
   flowers. However, seed production per flower after supplementary
   hand-pollination did not differ significantly between damaged and
   undamaged flowers. Compared to the Experimental plot, bumblebees visited
   fewer flowers per plant in a foraging bout in the Control plot.
   The flowers damaged by florivory allowed B. friseanus to shift to a
   nectar robber. Florivory and nectar robbing collectively decreased plant
   reproductive success by consuming nectar resources, which may reduce
   attractiveness to pollinators of the damaged flowers. However, the
   changes in pollinator behaviour might be beneficial to the plant by
   reducing the risk of geitonogamous mating.}},

Title = {{Biological Flora of the British Isles: Serratula tinctoria}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1438-1458}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Serratula tinctoria L. that are relevant to understanding its ecological
   characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the
   standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles:
   distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors,
   responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral
   and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.
   2. Serratula tinctoria is a gynodioecious perennial forb of open or
   semi-shaded habitats including grassland, heath, mire, open woodland and
   scrub and their ecotones. It is found throughout most of England and
   Wales but it is very rare in Scotland and absent from Ireland. Serratula
   tinctoria is found in Europe as far north as southern Sweden and Norway.
   It is absent from much of the Boreal biogeographical zone, including
   most of Fennoscandia and northern Poland, Russia and the Baltic States,
   and from the lowland Mediterranean zone.
   3. Serratula tinctoria occurs on soils overlying a wide variety of
   superficial deposits and sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks,
   including ultramafic rocks. The pH range of these soils is wide, ranging
   from acidic to moderately alkaline but with nutrient status classed as
   oligotrophic, or more rarely mesotrophic. In mire or fen habitats, it
   occurs in topogenous or soligenous situations with a similar soil water
   pH range. It is able to tolerate a wide spectrum of soil water-table
   conditions, ranging from very dry to flooded.
   4. Serratula tinctoria is pollinated by various insects of the orders
   Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees,
   hoverflies and butterflies. It produces phytoecdysteroids, which mimic a
   hormone that regulates insect development.
   5. The seed has a feathery pappus for wind dispersal and establishment
   is primarily from seed. However, it has strong dispersal limitation with
   slow migration rates into restored grasslands of 1 m year(-1). The
   species has a short-term persistent seed bank. Seedling recruitment is
   enhanced by disturbance that creates bare ground, increasing light flux
   and lower cover of bryophytes and litter, and reduced by higher nutrient
   availability and lack of management.
   6. Formerly the source of a yellow dye, S. tinctoria has declined in
   Britain since at least the late 19th Century primarily due to a
   combination of drainage, ploughing and agricultural improvement and,
   conversely, lack of management by cutting and grazing in its grassland,
   heath and mire habitats. There is evidence that the decline slowed or
   stabilised between the late-1980s and the mid-2000s, in part due to the
   positive impact of conservation via statutory protection on designated
   sites and wider measures delivered through agri-environment schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The discrepancy between observed flower visitors and those predicted
   based on floral phenotype has often cast doubt on the pollination
   syndrome concept. Here we show that this paradox may be alleviated by
   gaining better knowledge of the contributions of different flower
   visitors to pollination and the effects of floral traits that cannot be
   readily perceived by humans in Adenophora triphylla var. japonica. The
   blue, bell-shaped and pendant flowers of A. triphylla appear to fit a
   bee pollination syndrome. In contrast to this expectation, recent
   studies show that these flowers are frequented by nocturnal moths.
   We compared the flower visitor fauna, their visitation frequency and
   their relative contributions to seed set between day and night in two
   field populations of A. triphylla in Japan. We also determined the
   floral traits associated with temporal changes in the visitor
   assemblage, i.e. the timing of anthesis, the timing of changes in the
   sexual phase and the diel pattern of nectar production.
   While A. triphylla flowers were visited by both diurnal and nocturnal
   insects, the results from pollination experiments demonstrate that their
   primary pollinators are nocturnal settling-moths. Moreover, the flowers
   opened just after sunset, changed from staminate to pistillate phase in
   successive evenings and produced nectar only during the night, which all
   conform to the activity of nocturnal/crepuscular moths.
   Our study illustrates that the tradition of stereotyping the pollinators
   of a flower based on its appearance can be misleading and that it should
   be improved with empirical evidence of pollination performance and
   sufficient trait matching.}},

Abstract = {{Mexico has one of the highest diversities of barrel cacti species
   worldwide; however, all are threatened and require conservation
   policies. Information on their reproductive biology is crucial, but few
   studies are available. Ferocactus recurvus subsp. recurvus is a barrel
   cactus endemic to the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Valley. Our research aimed to
   characterise its floral and pollination biology. We hypothesised bee
   pollination, as suggested by its floral morphology and behaviour, and
   self-incompatibility, like most barrel cacti studied.
   Three study sites were selected in the semiarid Zapotitlan Valley,
   Mexico. We examined 190 flowers from 180 plants to determine:
   morphometry and behaviour of flowers, flower visitors and probable
   pollinators, and breeding system.
   Flowers showed diurnal anthesis, lasting 2-5 days, the stigma being
   receptive on day 2 or 3 after the start of anthesis. Flowers produced
   scarce/no nectar and main visitors were bees (Apidae), followed by flies
   ( Muscidae), ants (Formicidae), thrips (Thripidae) and hummingbirds
   (Throchilidae); however, only native bees and occasionally wasps
   contacted the stigma and anthers. Pollination experiments revealed that
   this species is self-incompatible and xenogamous. In natural conditions,
   fruit set was 60\% and cross-pollination fruit set was 100\%. Percentage
   seed germination resulting from cross-pollination was higher than in the
   control treatment.
   Our results provide ecological information for conservation programmes
   to ensure a high probability of breeding and seed production in natural
   populations of F. recurvus.}},

Abstract = {{Strawberry blossom weevil (SBW), Anthonomus rubi Herbst (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae) and European tarnished plant bug (ETB), Lygus
   rugulipennis Poppius (Hetereoptera: Miridae), cause significant damage
   to strawberry and raspberry crops. Using the SBW aggregation pheromone
   and ETB sex pheromone we optimized and tested a single trap for both
   species. A series of field experiments in crops and semi natural
   habitats in five European countries tested capture of the target pests
   and the ability to avoid captures of beneficial arthropods. A Unitrap
   containing a trapping agent of water and detergent and with a cross vane
   was more efficient at capturing both species compared to traps which
   incorporated glue as a trapping agent. Adding a green cross vane
   deterred attraction of non-pest species such as bees, but did not
   compromise catches of the target pests. The trap caught higher numbers
   of ETB and SBW if deployed at ground level and although a cross vane was
   not important for catches of ETB it was needed for significant captures
   of SBW. The potential for mass trapping SBW and ETB simultaneously in
   soft fruit crops is discussed including potential improvements to make
   this more effective and economic to deploy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

   temporal diversity in a Southern California native bee assemblage}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Despite a large number of ecological studies that document diversity
   loss resulting from anthropogenic disturbance, surprisingly few consider
   how disturbance affects temporal patterns of diversity that result from
   seasonal turnover of species. Temporal dynamics can play an important
   role in the structure and function of biological assemblages. Here, we
   investigate the temporal diversity patterns of bee faunas in Southern
   California coastal sage scrub ecosystems that have been extensively
   fragmented by urbanization. Using a two-year dataset of 235 bee species
   (n = 12,036 specimens), we compared 1-ha plots in scrub fragments and
   scrub reserves with respect to three components of temporal diversity:
   overall plot-level diversity pooled over time (temporal gamma
   diversity), diversity at discrete points in time (temporal alpha
   diversity), and seasonal turnover in assemblage composition (temporal
   beta diversity). Compared to reserves, fragments harbored bee
   assemblages with lower species richness and assemblage evenness both
   when summed across temporal samples (i.e., lower temporal gamma
   diversity) and at single points in time (i.e., lower temporal alpha
   diversity). Bee assemblages in fragments also exhibited reduced seasonal
   turnover (i.e., lower temporal beta diversity). While fragments and
   reserves did not differ in overall bee abundance, bee abundance in
   fragments peaked later in the season compared to that in reserves. Our
   results argue for an increased awareness of temporal diversity patterns,
   as information about the distinct components of temporal diversity is
   essential both for characterizing the assemblage dynamics of seasonal
   organisms and for identifying potential impacts of anthropogenic
   disturbance on ecosystem function through its effects on assemblage
   dynamics.}},

Title = {{Context-dependent medicinal effects of anabasine and infection-dependent
   toxicity in bumble bees}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Floral phytochemicals are ubiquitous in nature, and can function both as
   antimicrobials and as insecticides. Although many phytochemicals act as
   toxins and deterrents to consumers, the same chemicals may counteract
   disease and be preferred by infected individuals. The roles of nectar
   and pollen phytochemicals in pollinator ecology and conservation are
   complex, with evidence for both toxicity and medicinal effects against
   parasites. However, it remains unclear how consistent the effects of
   phytochemicals are across different parasite lineages and environmental
   conditions, and whether pollinators actively self-medicate with these
   compounds when infected.
   Approach
   Here, we test effects of the nectar alkaloid anabasine, found in
   Nicotiana, on infection intensity, dietary preference, and survival and
   performance of bumble bees (Bombus impatiens). We examined variation in
   the effects of anabasine on infection with different lineages of the
   intestinal parasite Crithidia under pollen-fed and pollen-starved
   conditions.
   Results
   We found that anabasine did not reduce infection intensity in individual
   bees infected with any of four Crithidia lineages that were tested in
   parallel, nor did anabasine reduce infection intensity in microcolonies
   of queenless workers. In addition, neither anabasine nor its isomer,
   nicotine, was preferred by infected bees in choice experiments, and
   infected bees consumed less anabasine than did uninfected bees under
   no-choice conditions. Furthermore, anabasine exacerbated the negative
   effects of infection on bee survival and microcolony performance.
   Anabasine reduced infection in only one experiment, in which bees were
   deprived of pollen and post-pupal contact with nestmates. In this
   experiment, anabasine had antiparasitic effects in bees from only two of
   four colonies, and infected bees exhibited reduced-rather than
   increased-phytochemical consumption relative to uninfected bees.
   Conclusions
   Variation in the effect of anabasine on infection suggests potential
   modulation of tritrophic interactions by both host genotype and
   environmental variables. Overall, our results demonstrate that Bombus
   impatiens prefer diets without nicotine and anabasine, and suggest that
   the medicinal effects and toxicity of anabasine may be context
   dependent. Future research should identify the specific environmental
   and genotypic factors that determine whether nectar phytochemicals have

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{One fundamental question in prey luring systems is to understand how
   visual signals are interpreted by the receiver. Predators lure prey by
   falsely imitating the signal of a model, or may exploit sensory
   preferences of the receivers, which search for rewarding signals. Crab
   spiders reflect ultraviolet (UV) light, ambush pollinators on flowers,
   and manipulate flower UV signals altering the behavior and response of
   prey. Whereas crab spiders typically depend on flowers to forage, adult
   Epicadus heterogaster departs from this standard behavior by preying on
   pollinators upon green leaves, even in the absence of flowers nearby.
   This species has a conspicuous abdomen resembling the shape of a flower,
   which may reflect UV signals similar to that of flowers, and thus
   attract pollinators. Nevertheless, no empirical evidence is available
   that E. heterogaster foraging on leaves mimics flowers, nor how this
   crab spider interacts with its prey. Field and laboratory experiments
   demonstrated that UV reflection of adult E. heterogaster is the main
   signal responsible for the attraction of pollinators. This is the first
   study to demonstrate that a crab spider attracts pollinators regardless
   of flower UV signal, which may represent an evolutionary pathway beyond
   the dependence of flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Two main mechanisms may buffer ecosystem functions despite biodiversity
   loss. First, multiple species could share similar ecological roles, thus
   providing functional redundancy. Second, species may respond differently
   to environmental change (response diversity). However, ecosystem
   function would be best protected when functionally redundant species
   also show response diversity. This linkage has not been studied
   directly, so we investigated whether native and exotic pollinator
   species with similar traits (functional redundancy) differed in
   abundance (response diversity) across an agricultural intensification
   gradient. Exotic pollinator species contributed most positive responses,
   which partially stabilized overall abundance of the pollinator
   community. However, although some functionally redundant species
   exhibited response diversity, this was not consistent across functional
   groups and aggregate abundances within each functional group were rarely
   stabilized. This shows functional redundancy and response diversity do
   not always operate in concert. Hence, despite exotic species becoming
   increasingly dominant in human-modified systems, they cannot replace the
   functional composition of native species.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},
Number = {{1860}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Yield production in flowering crops depends on both nutrient
   availability and pollination, but their relative roles and potential
   interactions are poorly understood. We measured pollination benefits to
   yield in sunflower, combining a gradient in insect pollination (0, 25,
   50, 100\%) with a continuous gradient in nitrogen (N) fertilization
   (from 0 to 150 kg N ha(-1)) in an experiment under realistic soil field
   conditions. We found that pollination benefits to yield were maximized
   at intermediate levels of N availability, bolstering yield by
   approximately 25\% compared with complete pollinator exclusion.
   Interestingly, we found little decrease in yield when insect visits were
   reduced by 50\%, indicating that the incremental contribution of
   pollination by insects to yield is greater when the baseline pollination
   service provision is very low. Our findings provide strong evidence for
   interactive, nonlinear effects of pollination and resource availability
   on seed production. Our results support ecological intensification as a
   promising strategy for sustainable management of agroecosystems. In
   particular, we found optimal level of pollination to potentially
   compensate for lower N applications.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{112-129}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is a recent addition to the field of
   nature inspired computing. The algorithm has been inspired from the
   pollination process in flowers and has been applied to a large spectra
   of optimization problems. But it has certain drawbacks which prevents
   its applications as a standard algorithm. This paper proposes new
   variants of FPA employing new mutation operators, dynamic switching and
   improved local search. A comprehensive comparison of proposed algorithms
   has been done for different population sizes for optimizing seventeen
   benchmark problems. The best variant among these is adaptive-Levy flower
   pollination algorithm (ALFPA) which has been further compared with the
   well-known algorithms like artificial bee colony (ABC), differential
   evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), bat algorithm (BA) and grey wolf
   optimizer (GWO). Numerical results show that ALFPA gives superior
   performance for standard benchmark functions. The algorithm has also
   been subjected to statistical tests and again the performance is better
   than the other algorithms. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bumblebee colony development following chronic exposure to
   field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid pesticide thiamethoxam under
   laboratory conditions}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Neonicotinoid pesticides are used in agriculture to reduce damage from
   crop pests. However, beneficial insects such as bees can come into
   contact with these pesticides when foraging in treated areas, with
   potential consequences for bee declines and pollination service
   delivery. Honeybees are typically used as a model organism to
   investigate insecticide impacts on bees, but relatively little is known
   about impacts on other taxa such as bumblebees. In this experiment, we
   chronically exposed whole mature bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) colonies
   to field-realistic levels of the neonicotinoid thiamethoxam (2.4ppb \&
   10ppb) over four weeks, and compared colony growth under laboratory
   conditions. We found no impact of insecticide exposure on colony weight
   gain, or the number or mass of sexuals produced, although colonies
   exposed to 2.4ppb produced larger males. As previous studies have
   reported pesticide effects on bumblebee colony growth, this may suggest
   that impacts on bumblebee colonies are more pronounced for colonies at
   an earlier stage in the reproductive cycle. Alternatively, it may also
   indicate that thiamethoxam differs in toxicity compared to previously
   tested neonicotinoids in terms of reproductive effects. In either case,
   assessing bumblebee colony development under field conditions is likely
   more informative for real world scenarios than tests conducted in
   laboratory conditions.}},

Title = {{An updated understanding of Texas bumble bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae)
   species presence and potential distributions in Texas, USA}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Texas is the second largest state in the United States of America, and
   the largest state in the contiguous USA at nearly 700,000 sq. km.
   Several Texas bumble bee species have shown evidence of declines in
   portions of their continental ranges, and conservation initiatives
   targeting these species will be most effective if species distributions
   are well established. To date, statewide bumble bee distributions for
   Texas have been inferred primarily from specirrien records housed in
   natural history collections. To improve upon these maps, land help
   inform conservation decisions, this research aimed to (1) update
   existing Texas bumble bee presence databases to include recent
   (2007-2016) data from citizen science repositories and targeted field
   studies, (2) triodel statewide species distributions of the most common
   bumble bee species in Texas using MaxEnt, and (3) identify conservation
   target areas for the state that are most likely to contain habitat
   suitable for multiple declining species. The resulting Texas bumble bee
   database is comprised of 3,580 records, to include previously compiled
   museum records dating from 1897, recent field survey data, and vetted
   records from citizen science repositories. These data yielded an updated
   state species list that includes 11 species, as well as species
   distribution models (SDMs) for the most common Texas bumble bee species,
   including two that have shown evidence of range-wide declines: B.
   fratemus (Smith, 1854) and B. pensylvanicus (DeGeer, 1773). Based on
   analyses of these models, we have identified conservation priority areas
   within the Texas Cross Timbers, Texas Blackland Prairies, and East
   Central Texas Plains ecoregions where suitable habitat for both B.
   fraternus and B. pensylvanicus are highly likely to co-occur.}},

Title = {{Reproductive biology and nectar secretion dynamics of Penstemon
   gentianoides (Plantaginaceae): a perennial herb with a mixed pollination
   system?}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 9}},
Abstract = {{Background. In many plant species, pollination syndromes predict the
   most effective pollinator. However, other floral visitors may also offer
   effective pollination services and promote mixed pollination systems.
   Several species of the species-rich Penstemon (Plantaginaceae) exhibit a
   suite of floral traits that suggest adaptation for pollination by both
   hymenopterans and hummingbirds. Transitions from the ancestral
   hymenopteran pollination syndrome to more derived hummingbird
   pollination syndrome may be promoted if the quantity or quality of
   visits by hummingbirds is increased and if the ancestral pollinator
   group performs less efficiently. The quantification of such shifts in
   pollination systems in the group is still limited. We aimed to
   investigate floral traits linked to this pollination syndrome in
   Penstemon gentianoides with flowers visited by bumblebees and
   hummingbirds.
   Methods. We investigated the floral biology, pollinator assemblages,
   breeding system and nectar production patterns ofP. gentianoides
   inhabiting a temperate montane forest in central Mexico. Pollination
   experiments were also conducted to assess the pollinator effectiveness
   of bumblebees and hummingbirds.
   Results. P. gentianoides flowers are protandrous, with 8-d male phase
   (staminate) flowers, followed by the similar to 1-7 d female phase
   (pistillate phase). Flowers display traits associated with hymenopteran
   pollination, including purple flowers abruptly ampliate-ventricose to a
   broad throat with anthers and stigmas included, and long lifespans.
   However, the nectar available in the morning hours was abundant and
   dilute, traits linked to flowers with a hummingbird pollination
   syndrome. Two hummingbird species made most of the visits to flowers,
   Selasphorus platycercus (30.3\% of all visits), followed by Archilochus
   colubris (11.3\%). Bumblebees (Bombus ephippiatus, B. huntii and B.
   weisi) accounted for 51.8\% of all recorded visits, but their foraging
   activity was restricted to the warmer hours. Hummingbirds made more
   foraging bouts and visited more flowers than hymenopteran species.
   Flowers experimentally pollinated by B. ephippiatus produced
   significantly more fruits than those pollinated by S. platycercus.
   However, there was no statistical difference in the number of seeds
   produced per fruit when a bumblebee or a hummingbird was the pollinator.
   Conclusions. We have shown that bumblebees and hummingbirds visit and
   pollinate P. gentianoides flowers. Despite floral traits resembling the
   hymenoptera pollination syndrome, flowers of P. gentianoides offer
   characteristic nectar rewards to flowers with a hummingbird pollination
   syndrome. Although pollination efficiency is higher among flowers
   visited by hymenoptera, the noteworthy percentage of fruit production
   and number of seeds per fruit derived from hummingbird pollination
   highlights the importance of hummingbirds as a functional group of
   pollinators that might have potential evolutionary consequences to the
   plants.}},

Title = {{Learning in two butterfly species when using flowers of the tropical
   milkweed Asclepias curassavica: No benefits for pollination}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The ability of insect visitors to learn to
   manipulate complex flowers has important consequences for foraging
   efficiency and plant fitness. We investigated learning by two butterfly
   species, Danaus erippus and Heliconius erato, as they foraged on the
   complex flowers of Asclepias curassavica, as well as the consequences
   for pollination.
   METHODS: To examine learning with respect to flower manipulation,
   butterflies were individually tested during four consecutive days under
   insectary conditions. At the end of each test, we recorded the number of
   pollinaria attached to the body of each butterfly and scored visited
   flowers for numbers of removed and inserted pollinia. We also conducted
   a field study to survey D. erippus and H. erato visiting flowers of A.
   curassavica, as well as to record numbers of pollinaria attached to the
   butterflies' bodies, and surveyed A. curassavica plants in the field to
   inspect flowers for pollinium removal and insertion.
   KEY RESULTS: Learning improves the ability of both butterfly species to
   avoid the nonrewarding flower parts and to locate nectar more
   efficiently. There were no experience effects, for either species, on
   the numbers of removed and inserted pollinia. Heliconius erato removed
   and inserted more pollinia than D. erippus. For both butterfly species,
   pollinium removal was higher than pollinium insertion.
   CONCLUSION: This study is the first to show that Danaus and Heliconius
   butterflies can learn to manipulate complex flowers, but this learning
   ability does not confer benefits to pollination in A. curassavica.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is an essential prerequisite for the production of many
   fruit and seed crops, including apple. In apple, successful
   fertilization requires pollen transfer to the stigma, pollen
   germination, and successful pollen tube growth resulting in fruit set.
   Precise selection of the most effective pollinizers for commercial
   orchards is not possible however, until these processes are more fully
   understood. The present study was undertaken to compare pollinizers in
   terms of pollen tube growth and fruit set. On trees of `Honeycrisp',
   `Fuji', and `Gala' from which bees were excluded, flowers were
   hand-pollinated using pollen collected from crabapple ('Ralph Shay' or
   Malus floribunda), `Delicious' and `Golden Delicious'. Flowers were
   harvested at one, two, three, and four days after pollination (DAP).
   Pollen source had a significant influence on pollen germination on the
   stigmatic surface, number of pollen tubes penetrating the stigma,
   distance of pollen tube growth down the style, and pollen tubes reaching
   the base of the style. In `Honeycrisp' and `Gala', ` Golden Delicious'
   pollen grew the fastest, followed by ` Delicious' and crabapple. Neither
   `Ralph Shay' nor Malus floribunda were effective pollinizers for `
   Honeycrisp' and resulted in low fruit set suggesting incompatibility may
   be involved. However, both these crabapples were effective pollinizers
   for `Fuji' and `Gala'. These results indicate that pollen source can
   have a tremendous impact on pollen tube growth and fruit set. The
   physiological basis for these effects is not clear, but implications for
   pollinizer selection are obvious.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{6507-6518}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Landscape heterogeneity in floral communities has the potential to
   modify pollinator behavior. Pollinator foraging varies with the
   diversity, abundance, and spatial configuration of floral resources.
   However, the implications of this variation for pollen transfer and
   ultimately the reproductive success of insect pollinated plants remains
   unclear, especially for species which are rare or isolated in the
   landscape. We used a landscape-scale experiment, coupled with
   microsatellite genotyping, to explore how the floral richness of
   habitats affected pollinator behavior and pollination effectiveness.
   Small arrays of the partially self-compatible plant Californian poppy
   (Eschscholzia californica) were introduced across a landscape gradient
   to simulate rare, spatially isolated populations. The effects on
   pollinator activity, outcrossing, and plant reproduction were measured.
   In florally rich habitats, we found reduced pollen movement between
   plants, leading to fewer long-distance pollination events, lower plant
   outcrossing, and a higher incidence of pollen limitation. This pattern
   indicates a potential reduction in per capita pollinator visitation, as
   suggested by the lower activity densities and richness of pollinators
   observed within florally rich habitats. In addition, seed production
   reduced by a factor of 1.8 in plants within florally rich habitats and
   progeny germination reduced by a factor of 1.2. We show this to be a
   consequence of self-fertilization within the partially self-compatible
   plant, E. californica. These findings indicate that locally rare plants
   are at a competitive disadvantage within florally rich habitats because
   neighboring plant species disrupt conspecific mating by co-opting
   pollinators. Ultimately, this Allee effect may play an important role in
   determining the long-term persistence of rarer plants in the landscape,
   both in terms of seed production and viability. Community context
   therefore requires consideration when designing and implementing
   conservation management for plants which are comparatively rare in the
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The Eurasian bumble bee Bombus terrestris Linnaeus has been used
   commercially for pollination of a large number of crop species
   worldwide. This species has become invasive in several countries where
   it has escaped into natural environments. This species has become
   naturalized in many zones of Chile and southern Argentina, and may
   potentially invade other regions and countries in South America. These
   naturalized populations of B. terrestris have been associated with rapid
   population declines of the native bee B. dahlbomii Gu,rin-M,neville. We
   report new records of the exotic bee B. terrestris in the Region de
   Arica y Parinacota in the far north of Chile, which includes portions of
   the Atacama Desert. We used species distribution models (SDMs) and
   multivariate analyses to evaluate whether these occurrences represent
   new escapes from managed colonies or natural dispersal of the species
   from its southern invaded range. These reports of B. terrestris indicate
   a northward expansion of this bee. In our analyses, these new areas of
   occurrences have environmental conditions similar to those observed in
   the species' southern invaded range, and our SDMs predict that B.
   terrestris dispersal through the Atacama is possible, although not
   likely given the occasional flower blooming in that region of Chile.
   These new occurrences in northern Chile reflect a potential for future
   invasion into other regions of South America by B. terrestris. Future
   surveys in the area should be intensified to evaluate if viable
   populations of this invasive species may become established.}},

Title = {{Influence of landscape context on the abundance of native bee

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Evidence shows that pollinator abundance has declined and, consequently,
   so has their services, which has possible negative impacts on ecosystem
   functioning. The goal of this study was to evaluate the influence of
   landscape context at multiple spatial scales on the abundance of bee
   pollinators of tomato crops in Brazil. Pollinator abundance was obtained
   from tomato crops grown in a conventional system in the Cerrado region.
   Around each tomato field circular buffers of 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 km
   radius were defined. Inside each buffer the landscapes were manually
   classified into native and non-native cover and, the proportion of
   native vegetation, the relative largest patch size, and the distance of
   the nearest native vegetation to each field were calculated. Pollinator
   species were categorized into five groups: Exomalopsis, Centris,
   Bombus/Eulaema, Halictidae, and all buzz pollinators combined (Buzzers).
   The results showed that the landscape context influenced the abundance
   of the five groups of tomato pollinators. Bees with a smaller body size,
   such as Exomalopsis spp., responded at smaller scales, while bees with a
   larger body size, such as the Centris and Bombus/Eulaema groups,
   responded at larger scales. The abundance of all pollinator groups
   increased with native vegetation cover. Most groups showed higher
   abundances in landscapes with similar-size fragments. The results
   reinforce the recommendation for maintaining natural habitats around
   crop areas, even if fragmented, for the conservation of the tomato
   pollinator assemblage. These findings are valuable for planning
   landscape management in the studied area to improve bee conservation,
   ecosystem services, and food production.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of bee populations for pollination in agricultural
   landscapes has attracted a lot of recent research interest, especially
   for crop industries undergoing expansion to meet increased production
   demands. In Canada, much growth has been occurring with commercial
   cranberry production, a field crop which is largely dependent on bee
   pollination. Wild bee pollinators could be negatively impacted by losses
   of natural habitat surrounding cranberry fields to accommodate increased
   production, but growers have little insight on how to manage their lands
   to maximize the presence of wild bees. Here, we described a 2-yr study
   where bee diversity and species composition were investigated to better
   understand the dynamic between natural habitat and cranberry fields.
   Bees were sampled using pan-traps and hand netting both within cranberry
   fields and in one of the three adjacent natural habitat types once a
   week during the crop flowering period. We found that bee community
   composition among cranberry fields did not differ based on the
   respective adjacent habitat type, but fields bordered by meadows were
   marginally less diverse than fields bordered by forest. As one would
   expect, field and natural habitat communities differed in terms of
   species composition and species richness. There was no evidence that one
   type of natural habitat was more favorable for the bees than another.
   Future agrobiodiversity studies should simultaneously examine bee
   diversity comprised in both crop fields and adjacent natural
   environments to better understand the species dynamics essential to the
   preservation of pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Speciation is typically accompanied by the formation of isolation
   barriers between lineages. Commonly, reproductive barriers are separated
   into pre- and post-zygotic mechanisms that can evolve with different
   speed. In this study, we measured the strength of different reproductive
   barriers in two closely related, sympatric orchids of the Ophrys
   insectifera group, namely Ophrys insectifera and Ophrys aymoninii to
   infer possible mechanisms of speciation. We quantified pre- and
   post-pollination barriers through observation of pollen flow, by
   performing artificial inter- and intraspecific crosses and analyzing
   scent bouquets. Additionally, we investigated differences in mycorrhizal
   fungi as a potential extrinsic factor of post-zygotic isolation. Our
   results show that floral isolation mediated by the attraction of
   different pollinators acts apparently as the sole reproductive barrier
   between the two orchid species, with later-acting intrinsic barriers
   seemingly absent. Also, the two orchids share most of their fungal
   mycorrhizal partners in sympatry, suggesting little or no importance of
   mycorrhizal symbiosis in reproductive isolation. Key traits underlying
   floral isolation were two alkenes and wax ester, present predominantly
   in the floral scent of O.aymoninii. These compounds, when applied to
   flowers of O.insectifera, triggered attraction and a copulation attempt
   of the bee pollinator of O.aymoninii and thus led to the (partial)
   breakdown of floral isolation. Based on our results, we suggest that
   adaptation to different pollinators, mediated by floral scent, underlies
   species isolation in this plant group. Pollinator switches may be
   promoted by low pollination success of individuals in dense patches of
   plants, an assumption that we also confirmed in our study.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence and extent of multiple paternity is an important
   component of variation in plant mating dynamics. However, links between
   pollinator activity and multiple paternity are generally lacking,
   especially for plant species that attract functionally diverse floral
   visitors. In this study, we separated the influence of two functionally
   distinct floral visitors (hawkmoths and solitary bees) and characterized
   their impacts on multiple paternity in a self-incompatible, annual forb,
   Oenothera harringtonii (Onagraceae). We also situated
   pollinator-mediated effects in a spatial context by linking variation in
   multiple paternity to variation in plant spatial isolation. We
   documented pronounced differences in the number of paternal sires as
   function of pollinator identity: on average, the primary pollinator
   (hawkmoths) facilitated mating with nearly twice as many pollen donors
   relative to the secondary pollinator (solitary bees). This effect was
   consistent for both isolated and nonisolated individuals, but spatial
   isolation imposed pronounced reductions on multiple paternity regardless
   of pollinator identity. Considering that pollinator abundance and pollen
   dispersal distance did not vary significantly with pollinator identity,
   we attribute variation in realized mating dynamics primarily to
   differences in pollinator morphology and behaviour as opposed to
   pollinator abundance or mating incompatibility arising from underlying

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide an essential service to natural ecosystems and
   agriculture. In tomatoes flowers, anthers are poricidal, pollen may drop
   from their pore when flowers are shaken by the wind. However, bees that
   vibrate these anthers increase pollen load on the stigma and in fruit
   production. The present study aimed to identify the pollinator richness
   of tomato flowers and investigate their morphological and functional
   traits related to the plant-pollinator interaction in plantations of
   Central Brazil. The time of anthesis, flower duration, and the number
   and viability of pollen grains and ovules were recorded. Floral visitors
   were observed and collected. Flower buds opened around 6h30 and closed
   around 18h00. They reopened on the following day at the same time in the
   morning, lasting on average 48 hours. The highest pollen availability
   occurred during the first hours of anthesis. Afterwards, the number of
   pollen grains declined, especially between 10h00 to 12h00, which is
   consistent with the pollinator visitation pattern. Forty bee species
   were found in the tomato fields, 30 of which were considered
   pollinators. We found that during the flowering period, plants offered
   an enormous amount of pollen to their visitors. These may explain the
   high richness and amount of bees that visit the tomato flowers in the
   study areas. The period of pollen availability and depletion throughout
   the day overlapped with the bees foraging period, suggesting that bees
   are highly effective in removing pollen grains from anthers. Many of
   these grains probably land on the stigma of the same flower, leading to
   self- pollination and subsequent fruit development. Native bees
   (Exomalopsis spp.) are effective pollinators of tomato flowers and are
   likely to contribute to increasing crop productivity. On the other hand,
   here tomato flowers offer large amounts of pollen resource to a high
   richness and amount of bees, showing a strong plant-pollinator
   interaction in the study agroecosystem.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator species are widely accepted as an important factor in plant
   reproductive isolation. Although mostly investigated in plants visited
   by different groups of pollinators (e.g., hummingbirds vs bees), few
   studies have examined the role of pollinators belonging to the same
   taxonomic group (e.g., only bees) on plant reproductive isolation. In
   this study, we investigate this question by evaluating pre- and
   post-zygotic mechanisms putatively involved in the reproductive
   isolation of two oil-rewarding sympatric Calceolaria species (i.e.,
   Calceolaria filicaulis and C. arachnoidea) in an Andean ecosystem of
   Chile. We estimated reproductive isolation values using a combination of
   field (pollinator visitation rates) and experimental (intra and
   interspecific manual cross-pollination and seed germination of parents
   and hybrids) evidence. The two Calceolaria species were preferentially
   visited by different oil-collecting bee species. Results from hand
   cross-pollination experiments indicate that intraspecific crossings
   produced significantly more seeds than interspecific ones.
   Notwithstanding, seed germination essays did not reveal differences
   between parental and hybrids. Taken together, these results suggest that
   pollinator species are responsible for most of the reproductive
   isolation in the two Calceolaria species studied here. This study is the
   first assessment of pollinator-mediated reproductive isolation in
   Calceolaria species and the first to document reproductive barriers in
   oil-rewarding plants.}},

Title = {{Bumble Bee Use of Post-Fire Chaparral in the Central Sierra Nevada}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees (Bombus spp.) are declining across many regions in the
   Northern Hemisphere, leading to a need for management actions that will
   protect and enhance their habitats. In the Sierra Nevada of California,
   USA, montane chaparral is prevalent across the landscape, particularly
   after forest fires, and may provide important floral resources for
   pollinators. However post-fire montane chaparral is often targeted for
   removal during reforestation efforts, to reduce competition with young
   trees. In 2015 and 2016, we conducted non-lethal bumble bee surveys
   within 2 areas in the Sierra Nevada that burned in forest fires in 2004.
   Our goals were to describe bumble bee abundance and species richness in
   a post-fire landscape, to compare results from chaparral-dominated
   upland vegetation with results from interspersed patches of riparian
   vegetation, and to identify characteristics of individual chaparral
   stands that might make some stands more valuable to bumble bees than
   others. We captured 2,494 bumble bees of 12 species, and used Bayesian
   hierarchical modeling to determine that bumble bee abundance was
   substantially greater in riparian plots (modeled capture rate (x) over
   bar = 1.10 +/- 0.31 {[}SD] bees/survey in 2015, and 2.96 +/- 0.83
   bees/survey in 2016) than in upland plots ((x) over bar = 0.47 +/- 0.07
   bees/survey in 2015, and 1.27 +/- 0.18 bees/survey in 2016), which
   comprised a mix of chaparral shrubs and associated herbaceous plants.
   Modeled species richness was also greater in riparian plots, with an
   average mean richness of 4.1 +/- 1.8 bumble bee species in riparian
   plots versus 2.3 +/- 1.3 species in upland plots across the 2 years of
   the study. Within upland and riparian areas, plots dominated by
   herbaceous vegetation had greater abundance and species richness. One
   chaparral shrub species, bearclover (Chamaebatia foliolosa), was foraged
   on preferentially over all other shrub species and over all but 1 forb
   taxon, and was associated with increased occupancy probability in the
   Vosnesensky bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii), the most abundant bumble
   bee species on our study plots. A complex of closely related herbaceous
   species in the genus Phacelia, commonly associated with upland chaparral
   in our study area, was the plant taxon most frequently used by bumble
   bees, and appeared to be particularly important during midsummer after
   bearclover flowers became scarce. Our findings suggest that post-fire
   chaparral communities are generally less intensively used by bumble bees
   than nearby riparian vegetation but may nevertheless provide important
   habitat. When chaparral removal is part of post-fire forest regeneration
   strategies, bumble bees will likely benefit from retention of a mosaic
   of upland habitat patches dominated by herbaceous vegetation and, in our
   study area, bearclover, which may provide foraging resources throughout
   the life cycle of local bumble bee colonies. Because habitat
   characteristics affected the occupancy of individual bumble bee species
   differently, managers should consider foraging preferences of target
   bumble bee species when making land management decisions. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Bee foragers respond to complex visual, olfactory, and extrasensory cues
   to optimize searches for floral rewards. Their abilities to detect and
   distinguish floral colors, shapes, volatiles, and ultraviolet signals
   and even gauge nectar availability from changes in floral humidity or
   electric fields are well studied. Bee foraging behaviors in the absence
   of floral cues, however, are rarely considered. We observed 42 species
   of wild bees visiting inconspicuous, nonflowering shrubs during early
   spring in a protected Mediterranean habitat. We determined
   experimentally that these bees were accessing sugary honeydew secretions
   from scale insects without the aid of standard cues. While honeydew use
   is known among some social Hymenoptera, its use across a diverse
   community of solitary bees is a novel observation. The widespread
   ability of native bees to locate and use unadvertised, nonfloral sugars
   suggests unappreciated sensory mechanisms and/or the existence of an
   interspecific foraging network among solitary bees that may influence
   how native bees cope with scarcity of floral resources and increasing
   environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{1. The ability of pollinating insects to discover and evade their
   predators can affect plant-pollinator mutualisms and have cascading
   ecosystem effects. Pollinators will avoid flowers with predators, but it
   is not clear how far away they will move to continue foraging. If these
   distances are relatively small, the impact of predators on the
   plant-pollinator mutualism may be lessened. The plant could continue to
   receive some pollination, and pollinators would reduce the time and
   energy needed to search for another patch.
   2. A native crab spider, Xysticus elegans, was placed on one cluster in
   a small array of Baccharis pilularis inflorescence clusters, and the
   preferred short-range foraging distances of naturally visiting
   pollinators was determined.
   3. Nearly all pollinator taxa (honey bees, wasps, other Hymenoptera, and
   non-bombyliid flies) spent less time foraging on the predator cluster.
   4. The key result of this study is that inflorescences within 90 mm of
   the crab spider were avoided by visiting honey bees and wasps, which
   spent three-and 18-fold more time, respectively, foraging on more
   distant flower clusters.
   5. Whether honey bees can use olfaction to detect spiders was then
   tested, and this study provides the first demonstration that honey bees
   will avoid crab spider odour alone at a food source.}},

Abstract = {{1 A total of 33 nests of Xylocopa augusti was studied during two
   consecutive seasons.
   2 Nesting behaviour and floral resources used by the large carpenter bee
   X. augusti Lepeletier de Saint Fargeau were studied during the brood
   production season in an urban area in Argentina.
   3 Biological information about nesting aspects inside and outside the
   nest was considered, paying particular attention to year-long activity,
   foraging flights throughout the day for nectar and pollen collection,
   nectar dehydration, oviposition, and pollen preference.
   4 In the study area, X. augusti shows an univoltine life cycle, with a
   peak of nesting between October and December, which coincides with the
   greatest blooming period of the surrounding flora.
   5 From 36 analyzed larval provision samples, 18 pollen types were
   identified, most of them belonging to ornamental trees or shrubs. Pollen
   from Eucalyptus-Myrceugenia glaucescens (Cambess.) D. Legrand and Kausel
   (Myrtaceae), Solanum sp.-Cyphomandra betacea (Cav.) Sendtn. (Solanaceae)
   and Erythrina crista-galli L. (Fabaceae) was dominant.
   6 The ability to obtain pollen from poricidal anthers such as those of
   Solanum indicate the potential of X. augusti to be an excellent managed
   pollinator and a good candidate for pollinating Solanaceae, such as
   Solanum lycopersicum `tomato' and Solanum melongena `eggplant', which
   are economically important crops in this region.}},

Abstract = {{A growing body of evidence suggests that wild bees play an important
   role in agricultural pollination. It is very difficult, however, to
   accurately quantify the contribution of wild bees relative to honeybees
   in most crop systems. We quantified the relative contribution of
   honeybees and wild bees to the pollination of an economically important,
   insect-pollinated crop (apple). We use an empirical dataset to identify
   which of three functional traits (body size, pollen load purity, and
   flower handling behavior) contribute significantly to seed set. We find
   that flower handling behavior and abundance were the only functional
   traits that significantly predict seed set. When we take into account
   flower handling behavior and abundance, wild bees contributed
   significantly more to seed set than honeybees in the apple orchards we
   surveyed. Our findings suggest that land managers may benefit from
   focusing on supporting communities of wild bees, rather than investing
   in honeybee hive rental.}},

Title = {{Exploring the interactions between resource availability and the

Abstract = {{Intensification of agriculture and associated loss of habitat
   heterogeneity is a key driver of global declines in insect pollinators.
   Pollinators utilise different habitats to meet resource requirements
   throughout their life-span and it is widely accepted that their
   conservation requires a landscape-scale approach. Information on the
   mechanisms driving insect pollinators at the landscape scale is,
   however, lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, this novel study explores
   how pollinators utilise different habitats within a landscape and how
   utilisation changes over the season. Floral resources and insect
   pollinators (i.e. bumblebee, butterflies and hoverflies) were monitored
   during peak pollinator activity periods on a wide range of agricultural
   and semi-natural habitats in an intensive grassland landscape.
   The availability of key foraging resources differed between semi-natural
   habitats and this was strongly linked to their utilisation by
   pollinators. Floral resources were most abundant and diverse in road
   verges, riparian buffer strips and open scrub. These were key habitats
   for butterflies, with road verges and buffer strips also being important
   for hoverflies and bumblebees. The relative value of semi-natural
   habitats in providing floral resources changed throughout the season.
   Pollinators appeared to respond to changes in key floral resources,
   dynamically using different semi-natural habitats to meet their
   requirements. Maintaining landscape heterogeneity and improving the
   quality of semi-natural habitats to ensure resource diversity and
   continuity is fundamental to pollinator conservation. Regionally
   targeting agri-environment spending could result in the simplification
   of agricultural landscapes with consequences on insect pollinators and
   biodiversity as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the genetics, morphology and ecology of the widely
   distributed Megachile concinna species complex (Hymenoptera:
   Megachilidae), which is composed of numerous taxa of unclear taxonomic
   status in Africa and the Palearctic. In the Western Palearctic, three
   genetically distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are found around
   the Mediterranean Sea: the western Mediterranean OTU M. pusilla, the
   eastern Mediterranean OTU M. anatolica and the predominantly Arabian OTU
   M. leucostoma. A morphological cline is present between anatolica and
   leucostoma in the Near East, despite a lack of mitochondrial
   introgression between the two; one nuclear marker suggests some gene
   flow between these OTUs. The contact zone between pusilla and leucostoma
   could not be sampled but phenotypic intergradation is also observed
   between these OTUs in northern Africa. In contrast, study of the contact
   zone between pusilla and anatolica indicates that both OTUs retain
   phenotypic and genomic integrity in sympatry over a contact zone
   spanning 1000 km. The arrangement of these three OTUs suggests a ring of
   interconnected populations around the Mediterranean Sea and sympatry
   between pusilla and anatolica at both ends of the ring in southeastern
   Europe. The latter two OTUs exhibit ecological differences, including
   phenology and host-plant preferences, which may contribute to their
   isolation. In addition, our results suggest that two OTUs, M. venusta
   and M. concinna, maintain genetic and phenotypic integrity in sympatry
   in parts of Africa; the latter is recognized as a valid species here.
   Lastly, our results indicate that two OTUs have been introduced
   independently into the New World, pusilla in North America and
   Argentina, and concinna in the Antilles.}},

Abstract = {{Red flowers are a defining character of the bird-pollination syndrome.
   Birds do not, however, innately prefer red, suggesting that rather than
   attracting birds, red flowers may serve to exclude other visitors (e.g.,
   bumblebees). Bees are sometimes considered ``blind{''} to red, but
   studies have in fact documented both blue and red preferences in various
   bee species. These mixed results may be an effect of overly simplistic
   lab settings. We hypothesized that bees might readily locate red flowers
   in a simple laboratory environment, but struggle to find the same
   flowers in a complex, foliated setting. We tested the effects of
   environmental complexity on visitation to red and blue artificial
   flowers and on the foraging rate of captive worker bumblebees (Bombus
   impatiens). Bees made significantly fewer visits to red flowers when
   foraging in a complex environment with artificial green foliage,
   suggesting that red becomes harder to locate in this context than in a
   simple, leafless environment. Bees also foraged more slowly, on average,
   in the complex environment, although the difference was apparent only
   among experienced bees. Our findings provide a possible explanation for
   previous laboratory tests finding no colour preference in bumblebees.
   This ``contextual colour-blindness{''} of bees supports the hypothesis
   that red evolved as a mechanism for plants to avoid visitation by bees,
   favouring bird pollination instead.}},

Abstract = {{The current bumblebee decline leads to inbreeding in populations that
   fosters a loss of allelic diversity and diploid male production. As
   diploid males are viable and their offspring are sterile, bumblebee
   populations can quickly fall in a vortex of extinction. In this article,
   we investigate for the first time a potential premating mechanism
   through a major chemical reproductive trait (male cephalic labial gland
   secretions) that could prevent monandrous virgin queens from mating with
   diploid males. We focus our study on the cephalic labial gland
   secretions of diploid and haploid males of Bombus terrestris (L.).
   Contrary to initial expectations, our results do not show any
   significant differentiation of cephalic labial gland secretions between
   diploid and haploid specimens. Queens seem therefore to be unable to
   avoid mating with diploid males based on their compositions of cephalic
   labial gland secretions. This suggests that the vortex of extinction of
   diploid males could not be stopped through premating avoidance based on
   the cephalic labial gland secretions but other mechanisms could avoid
   mating between diploid males and queens.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide exposure has been implicated as a contributor to insect
   pollinator declines. In social bees, which are crucial pollination
   service providers, the effect of low-level chronic exposure is typically
   non-lethal leading researchers to consider whether exposure induces
   sublethal effects on behaviour and whether such impairment can affect
   colony development. Studies under laboratory conditions can control
   levels of pesticide exposure and elucidate causative effects, but are
   often criticized for being unrealistic. In contrast, field studies can
   monitor bee responses under a more realistic pesticide exposure
   landscape; yet typically such findings are limited to correlative
   results and can lack true controls or sufficient replication. We attempt
   to bridge this gap by exposing bumblebees to known amounts of pesticides
   when colonies are placed in the field. Using 20 bumblebee colonies, we
   assess the consequences of exposure to the neonicotinoid clothianidin,
   provided in sucrose at a concentration of five parts per billion, over
   5weeks. We monitored foraging patterns and pollen collecting performance
   from 3282 bouts using either a non-invasive photographic assessment, or
   by extracting the pollen from returning foragers. We also conducted a
   full colony census at the beginning and end of the experiment. In
   contrast to studies on other neonicotinoids, showing clear impairment to
   foraging behaviours, we detected only subtle changes to patterns of
   foraging activity and pollen foraging during the course of the
   experiment. However, our colony census measures showed a more pronounced
   effect of exposure, with fewer adult workers and sexuals in treated
   colonies after 5weeks.Synthesis and applications. Pesticide-induced
   impairments on colony development and foraging could impact on the
   pollination service that bees provide. Therefore, our findings, that
   bees show subtle changes in foraging behaviour and reductions in colony
   size after exposure to a common pesticide, have important implications
   and help to inform the debate over whether the benefits of systemic
   pesticide application to flowering crops outweigh the costs. We propose
   that our methodology is an important advance to previous semi-field
   methods and should be considered when considering improvements to
   current ecotoxicological guidelines for pesticide risk assessment.

Abstract = {{Habitat loss is a major driver of bee declines worldwide, and is of key
   relevance in the tropics given high deforestation rates, but we continue
   to have a poor understanding of the impact of land-cover change on
   tropical bee communities. Orchid bees (Apidae: Euglossini) are critical
   long-distance pollinators and may be highly susceptible to forest
   fragmentation given their reliance on forest habitat. Previous studies
   on the impact of forest fragmentation on euglossines have been
   geographically limited, have largely ignored beta-diversity, and have
   not compared fragments with continuous forest. To contribute to
   addressing these gaps, we sampled male euglossine bees in 18 forest
   fragments (area range: 2.5-33 ha) and at eight locations within a large
   (3500 ha) continuous forest in the Choc biodiversity hotspot of Ecuador
   during the dry season in 2014. We assessed how euglossine abundance,
   richness, and evenness related to fragment area, isolation, and
   edge:area ratio. We also compared fragments to continuous forest, in
   terms of alpha- and beta-diversity. In fragments, a single species
   (Euglossa tridentata) comprised 78\% of captures, and we found no
   significant effect of fragment area, isolation, or edge on abundance,
   richness, or evenness among fragments. Forest fragments and continuous
   forest differed in both community composition and evenness, but not in
   abundance or species richness. Spatial turnover (beta-diversity) showed
   a non-significant trend toward changing more rapidly in continuous
   forest relative to fragments. These results underscore the conservation
   value of continuous forest for orchid bee diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable and consistent monitoring is essential for bee conservation.
   Correctly interpreting the influence of habitat characteristics on
   native bee communities is necessary to develop effective strategies for
   bee conservation and to support the provision of pollination services to
   agricultural crops or natural plant communities. Biases imposed by
   different sampling methods used to monitor bee populations can affect
   our ability to discern important habitat characteristics, but the extent
   of this bias is not well understood. We used three common sampling
   methods (blue vane traps, colored pan traps, and aerial net collection)
   to assess bee communities in fragments of Palouse Prairie in eastern
   Washington and northern Idaho. We determined differences in abundance,
   species richness, proportional representation of different genera, and
   functional trait characteristics among the three sampling techniques. We
   also evaluated differences in the relationships between bee species
   richness and diversity and two key habitat variables known to mediate
   bee populations: local plant species richness and the amount of suitable
   bee habitat in the surrounding landscape. Community metrics for bees
   collected using blue vane traps were correlated with the amount of
   suitable habitat in the landscape but not with plant species richness.
   Conversely, community metrics for bees collected using an aerial net
   were correlated with the local plant species richness but not with the
   amount of suitable habitat. Our results indicate that effective
   conservation of insect communities will require a combination of
   sampling methods to reliably discern the influence of habitat variables
   at different scales and across taxa with varying functional traits.}},

Title = {{Interactive effects of landscape-wide intensity of farming practices and

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1631-1642}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Context The local intensity of farming practices is considered as an
   important driver of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes and its
   effect on biodiversity has been shown to interact with landscape
   complexity. But the influence of landscape-wide intensity of farming
   practices on biodiversity and its combined effect with landscape
   complexity have been little explored.
   Objective In this study, we tested the interactive effect of the
   landscape-wide intensity of farming practices and landscape complexity
   on the local species richness and abundance of farmland wild bee
   communities.
   Methods We captured wild bees in 96 crop fields and explored the effect
   of landscape-wide intensity of various farming practices along a
   gradient of landscape complexity (proportion of semi-natural habitats).
   Results We found that species richness and abundance of wild bees were
   more positively influenced by landscape complexity in highly
   insecticide-sprayed landscapes than in less intensively managed
   landscapes. In contrast, we found that the positive effect of landscape
   complexity on bee species richness only occurred in landscapes with low
   nitrogen inputs.
   Conclusions Our study demonstrates the interactive effects of
   landscape-wide farming intensity and landscape complexity in shaping the
   diversity of farmland wild bee communities. We conclude that the
   management of farming intensity at the landscape-scale could mitigate
   the effects of habitat loss on wild bee decline and would help to
   maintain pollination services in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Oilseed rape (OSR; Brassica napus L.) is a major crop in temperate
   regions and provides an important source of nutrition to many of the
   yield-enhancing insect flower visitors that consume floral nectar. The
   manipulation of mechanisms that control various crop plant traits for
   the benefit of pollinators has been suggested in the bid to increase
   food security, but little is known about inherent floral trait
   expression in contemporary OSR varieties or the breeding systems used in
   OSR breeding programmes. We studied a range of floral traits in
   glasshouse-grown, certified conventional varieties of winter OSR to test
   for variation among and within breeding systems. We measured 24-h nectar
   secretion rate, amount, concentration and ratio of nectar sugars per
   flower, and sizes and number of flowers produced per plant from 24
   varieties of OSR representing open-pollinated (OP), genic male sterility
   (GMS) hybrid and cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) hybrid breeding
   systems. Sugar concentration was consistent among and within the
   breeding systems; however, GMS hybrids produced more nectar and more
   sugar per flower than CMS hybrid or OP varieties. With the exception of
   ratio of fructose/glucose in OP varieties, we found that nectar traits
   were consistent within all the breeding systems. When scaled, GMS
   hybrids produced 1.73 times more nectar resource per plant than OP
   varieties. Nectar production and amount of nectar sugar in OSR plants
   were independent of number and size of flowers. Our data show that
   floral traits of glasshouse-grown OSR differed among breeding systems,
   suggesting that manipulation and enhancement of nectar rewards for
   insect flower visitors, including pollinators, could be included in
   future OSR breeding programmes.}},

Title = {{Plant survival and keystone pollinator species in stochastic
   coextinction models: role of intrinsic dependence on animal-pollination}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Coextinction models are useful to understand community robustness to
   species loss and resilience to disturbances. We simulated pollinator
   extinctions in pollination networks by using a hybrid model that
   combined a recently developed stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for
   plant extinctions and a topological model (TCM) for animal extinctions.
   Our model accounted for variation in interaction strengths and included
   empirical estimates of plant dependence on pollinators to set seeds. The
   stochastic nature of such model allowed us determining plant survival to
   single (and multiple) extinction events, and identifying which
   pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger secondary
   extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal
   sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant
   survival was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by
   interaction strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants
   were the most sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in
   extinction cascades. We predict that the relationship between dependence
   and plant connectivity is crucial to determine network robustness to
   interaction loss. Finally, we showed that honeybees and several beetles
   were keystone species in our communities. This information is of great
   value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses facing current global
   change and to identify target species for effective conservation.}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Conservation biology can profit greatly from incorporating a
   phylogenetic perspective into analyses of patterns and drivers of
   species extinction risk. We applied such an approach to analyse patterns
   of bumblebee (Bombus) decline. We assembled a database representing
   approximately 43\% of the circa 260 globally known species, which
   included species extinction risk assessments following the International
   Union fo Conservation of Nature Red List categories and criteria, and
   information on species traits presumably associated with bumblebee
   decline. We quantified the strength of phylogenetic signal in decline,
   range size, tongue length and parasite presence. Overall, about
   one-third of the assessed bumblebees are declining and declining species
   are not randomly distributed across the Bombus phylogeny. Susceptible
   species were over-represented in the subgenus Thoracobombus (approx.
   64\%) and under-represented in the subgenus Pyrobombus (approx. 6\%).
   Phylogenetic logistic regressions revealed that species with small
   geographical ranges and those in which none of three internal parasites
   were reported (i.e. Crithidia bombi, Nosema spp. or Locustacarus
   buchneri) were particularly vulnerable. Bumblebee evolutionary history
   will be deeply eroded if most species from threatened clades,
   particularly those stemming from basal nodes, become finally extinct.
   The habitat of species with restricted distribution should be protected
   and the importance of pathogen tolerance/resistance as mechanisms to
   deal with pathogens needs urgent research.}},

Title = {{Ginger and the beetle: Evidence of primitive pollination system in a
   Himalayan endemic alpine ginger (Roscoea alpina, Zingiberaceae)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 19}},
Abstract = {{The Himalayan endemic alpine genus Roscoea, like other members of ginger
   family, exhibits the combination of floral traits that would fit
   pollination by long distant foragers such as bees, birds or flies. We
   studied the pollination biology of Roscoea alpina, observed potential
   floral visitors and determined their foraging behaviour, visitation
   frequency and pollination efficiency, to seek evidence in support of the
   pollination syndrome hypothesis. We also measured the floral spectra of
   R. alpina flowers to evaluate if signals fit with the currently known
   framework for observed floral visitors. We found that R. alpina have
   autonomous selfing and pollinator-mediated crossing, but lack apomixis.
   We observed that a beetle (Mylabris sp.), and a moth (Macroglossum
   nycteris) visit the flowers of R. alpina for pollen and nectar feeding
   respectively. Our field observations, the stigmatic pollen count and
   fruit set data indicated that the visit by the beetle was legitimate,
   while that of the moth was illegitimate. Emasculated flowers visited by
   beetles set as many fruits and seeds/fruit as autoselfed and naturally
   pollinated flowers, while emasculated flowers excluded from beetle
   visits did not set fruit and seed; indicating that a single visit of a
   beetle to the flowers of R. alpina can facilitate pollination. We found
   that flower spectral signal of R. alpina does not fit typical spectra
   previously reported for beetle or bee-visited flowers. Our results
   suggest that, to ensure reproductive success in alpine habitat, R.
   alpina has evolved autonomous selfing as a predominant mode of
   reproduction, while beetle pollination would promote genetic diversity
   of this plant species. The visitation of beetles to the flowers of R.
   alpina, despite floral signal mismatch with the classically associated
   beetle vision, suggests that a different visual processing may operate
   in this plant-pollinator interaction at high altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding and managing pollination service is hindered by taxonomic
   impediments and paucity of data, particularly in the tropics. Herein we
   apply integrative species delineation and taxonomy to test impacts of
   land use on the diversity of bee communities within Xishuangbanna
   (Yunnan, south China), a highly biodiverse tropical region which has
   undergone extensive land conversion to rubber plantation. 128
   Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) were inferred by an iterative and
   integrative approach. Bee activity differed significantly across land
   use samples, although community composition corresponded more to level
   of vegetation density, when accounting for spatial structure. Species
   diversity was high in young rubber plantations, although composition
   overlapped with other species-rich habitats (natural forest edge and
   river banks), and older plantations (> 8 years) showed very low
   diversity under all measures. Community structures were similar between
   the natural forest interior and edge, although analysis indicated
   contrasting drivers of diversity, with clustering in the interior and
   overdispersion in the forest edge. Further, phylogenetic diversity and
   derived indices were underestimated when reference data were omitted
   from analysis. The description of bee communities herein permits more
   informed choices in land management with respect to ensuring
   continuation of essential services by bees.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Workers of social insects, such as bees, ants and wasps, show some
   degree of inter-individual variability in decision-making, learning and
   memory. Whether these natural cognitive differences translate into
   distinct adaptive behavioural strategies is virtually unknown. Here we
   examined variability in the movement patterns of bumblebee foragers
   establishing routes between artificial flowers. We recorded all flower
   visitation sequences performed by 29 bees tested for 20 consecutive
   foraging bouts in three experimental arrays, each characterised by a
   unique spatial configuration of artificial flowers and three-dimensional
   landmarks. All bees started to develop efficient routes as they
   accumulated foraging experience in each array, and showed consistent
   inter-individual differences in their levels of route fidelity and
   foraging performance, as measured by travel speed and the frequency of
   revisits to flowers. While the tendency of bees to repeat the same route
   was influenced by their colony origin, foraging performance was
   correlated to body size. The largest foragers travelled faster and made
   less revisits to empty flowers. We discuss the possible adaptive value
   of such inter-individual variability within the forager caste for
   optimisation of colony-level foraging performances in social
   pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a fundamental process to produce food and maintain
   biodiversity in natural areas, since the production of seeds is related
   to its efficiency. Studies can determine the influence of reproductive
   systems on seed and seedlings quality and, consequently, on the
   structure of populations, helping the management, plant breeding and
   preservation of species. Campomanesia pubescens (DC.) O. Berg.
   (guabiroba) is a Brazilian shrub, pollinated by bees and occasionally by
   dipterans. This work aimed at evaluating the influence of pollination
   and reproductive system on seed production and germination and on the
   seedlings quality of C. pubescens. Phenology and floral biology were
   studied, and fruits from controlled pollinations were collected, in the
   Mogi Guacu Biological Reserve, Sao Paulo State. The germination of seeds
   originated from self- and cross-pollination were analyzed, as well as
   the development of seedlings up to 180 days after germination. Seeds
   from self-pollination produced seedlings with lower development than the
   ones from cross-pollination, and they were more susceptible to mortality
   in laboratory and in greenhouse.}},

   contribution to contemporary pollination biology}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{1-6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The multidisciplinary field of pollination biology was enriched
   enormously by the contributions of Stefan Vogel (1925-2015). Vogel
   revived and expanded the pollination syndrome concept and recognized the
   importance of shifts between pollination modes for angiosperm
   diversification. He made a number of key discoveries, including perfume
   and oil reward systems in flowers and pollination of these flowers by
   highly specialized bees. He also contributed greatly to our
   understanding of floral mimicry, floral integration, and floral
   adaptations for bat pollination. Many of his insights were obtained
   through his field-based research in the tropics and his close ties to
   faculty and students at various universities in South America. Vogel's
   work continues to be the inspiration for new scientific endeavours and
   this special issue of Flora about ``Patterns and mechanisms in
   plant-pollinator interactions{''} contains a collection of 22 research
   papers that serve as a tribute to his legacy. The papers cover a wide
   range of topics and taxa, but can be broadly grouped into the themes of
   plant-pollinator interactions, functional morphology, floral rewards,
   floral signals and pollination syndromes, all of which also featured
   prominently in Vogel's own work. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Title = {{Effect of mutualistic and antagonistic bees on floral resources and
   pollination of a savanna shrub}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{30-38}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Since Darwin, cheaters have been described in plant-pollinator
   mutualisms. Bignoniaceae species have a wide interaction network with
   floral visitors, and most of those interactions are established with
   cheaters. Thus, our objective was to determine which role each floral
   visitor plays in a system composed by bees and a Bignoniaceae savanna
   species. So, here we described the bees' behaviour and defined
   experimentally who are the mutualists and cheaters, we described the
   temporal sequence of interactions, quantified pollen and nectar removal,
   and checked for the potential effect of robbery damages on pollinator
   behaviour. Pollinators visited a small number of flowers, mainly in the
   early morning, while the most frequent cheaters (robbers and thieves)
   visited the flowers throughout the day, increasing visitation at
   midmorning, when pollinators had already visited the flowers. We
   considered medium-sized bees as pollinators, small bees acted only as
   cheaters, not contributing to seed production. Pollen thieves reduced
   the amount of male gametes available for pollination, while nectar
   thieves and robbers were associated with nectar depletion. We did not
   find any significant difference in the number of pollen grains deposited
   on the stigmas of flowers with and without robbery damages. In
   conclusion, when pollinators visit J. caroba flowers in the early
   morning, there might be a smaller competition pressure among visitors
   due to the greater amount of resources available, especially in recently
   opened flowers, and due to the low frequency of cheaters visits, which
   probably prevents a major negative impact of cheaters on pollination and
   plant reproduction in this species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{Differentiation in angiosperms is often linked to small changes in
   floral features including morphology, but also phenology and floral
   resources, which select different arrays of pollinators and result in
   disassortative mating. Unonopsis is a bee-pollinated genus in the mostly
   beetle-pollinated tropical family Annonaceae. We studied Unonopsis
   guatterioides,a species widespread in South American forests, from the
   Amazon to Sao Paulo. A population in Uberlandia, Minas Gerais state,
   Central Brazil was investigated for its phenology and floral biology,
   including anthesis, floral scent, pollinator behavior, floral resources,
   and breeding system. The plants in Uberlandia were bee-pollinated and
   self-compatible. Its flowers were protogynous, and their anthesis lasted
   30 h. Pistillate and staminate stage flowers mainly released
   monoterpenoids, among them 1,8-cineole and limonene. A comparison with
   the previously studied population of U. guatterioides in Amazonas state
   indicated remarkable differences between the two populations, with
   regard to flower characters, anthesis, and pollination process. There
   was a more diverse, unspecialized pollination by several small
   Halictidae and Apidae bee species in Uberlandia, while in Manaus there
   was a highly specialized pollination by perfume-collecting males of a
   single orchid bee species, Eulaema bombiformis (Apidae-Euglossini). The
   profound differences of floral biology in U. guatterioides in Uberlandia
   and Manaus indicate that these two populations eventually represent
   different species. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Patterns of phenotypic selection for oil and nectar in Monttea aphylla
   (Plantaginaceae) in a geographic mosaic of interactions with pollinators}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{47-55}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Oil-flower species are highly specialized attracting a narrow group of
   oil-collecting bees in contrast to nectar-flower species visited by a
   wide diversity of pollinators. The vast majority of the oil species lack
   nectar as a pollinator reward; this suggests that the ancestors of
   plants with oil flowers had either nectar-less flowers or faced strong
   selection against the production of nectar once oil secretion evolved.
   Monttea aphylla is one of the few species that simultaneously offers oil
   and nectar in the same flower to pollinators. In particular, we studied
   phenotypic selection in 16 populations in the Monte desert of Argentina
   that spanned the entire geographical range of the species. In each
   population, we determined the relationship between plant pollination
   success and floral rewards. Positive directional selection differentials
   were detected in three of the populations. One northern population
   favoured selection on oil production, two central or southern
   populations favoured selection on nectar production. Directional
   selection gradients were consistent with the above results and
   correlational selection was significant for one northern population
   where pollination success was favoured by an increased selection on oil
   and a decreased selection on nectar. Geographic variation in phenotypic
   selection models showed latitudinal increase in directional selection on
   nectar. Geographic variation in visitation frequencies of the specialist
   oil-collecting bee and relative abundance of other floral sources were
   related to an increase in directional selection on nectar. Thus,
   evolution of rewards appears to respond to a geographic mosaic where
   either oil or nectar are favoured in different contexts of ecologically
   specialised oil collecting bees. Although phenotypic selection was
   detectable in few and was absent in most populations, the general
   pattern was consistent with current geographic differentiation in reward
   amounts. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Floral signals and filters in a wasp- and a bee-pollinated Gomphocarpus
   species (Apocynaceae: Asclepiadeae)}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{83-91}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Floral traits may function as attractants for some flower visitors and
   also as mechanisms that filter out non-beneficial flower visitors. Our
   current understanding of floral filter mechanisms is limited as this
   particular aspect of floral function has received less attention than
   floral attractants. Here we report on a case of two closely related
   Gomphocarpus species, G. physocarpus and G. fruticosus, that are similar
   in their general floral shape and architecture but differ in their main
   pollinators, which are vespid wasps and honeybees, respectively. To
   identify the floral traits that best explain the observed pollinators we
   analysed and compared the floral scent composition, the flower colour,
   flower morphology, and nectar sugar composition of the two species.
   Furthermore, the response to floral scent was tested in behavioural
   experiments with Belanogaster and Polistes vespid wasps. The floral
   scent composition differed significantly between the plant species.
   Acetic acid was a main component in the wasp-pollinated G. physocarpus,
   which is highly unusual for a floral scent bouquet. Choice experiments
   suggest that the species-specific odour might be responsible for the
   selective attraction of either wasps or bees. Furthermore,
   wasp-pollinated G. physocarpus flowers offer relatively large amounts of
   nectar that is freely accessible to insect visitors, whereas in G.
   fruticosus the site of nectar accumulation is covered by a specific
   morphological structure that makes it difficult for short-tongued
   insects such as wasps to access the nectar. Altogether, pollinator
   specialisation in the two Gomphocarpus species seem to be due to a
   combination of floral filter mechanisms and olfactory cues that cause
   flower visitors to learn to differentiate between the two species. (C)

Abstract = {{Ranking with the great 18th and 19th century botanists, Kolreuter,
   Sprengel, and Muller, Stefan Vogel was the 20th century plant biologist
   who discovered and explored an entirely new pollination syndrome - oil
   flowers and oil-collecting bees. His work inspired us to work on oil
   flowers and their associated bees in regions he did not visit.
   Throughout our work we were continually impressed with the creativity
   and thoroughness with which he explored this novel plant-pollinator
   system. Yet, time and subsequent explorations have elaborated and
   expanded on his work. Here we summarize his contributions and bring up
   to date the story of the oil flower pollination system focusing
   primarily on oil bees. Specifically we point out: our increased
   knowledge about the numbers of plants and bees partnering in this
   syndrome, the unrealized flexibility in the system; new findings of the
   chemistry of the floral oils, the use of the oils among various
   oil-collecting bees and the chemical signals used by at least some oil
   bees for floral host recognition. We also discuss what is known of the
   pollen and nectar hosts of oil-collecting bees. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{We used comparative studies to investigate how and why floral and bee
   fragrances evolve, including courtship odors collected by male Euglossa
   mixta to form their ``tibial bouquet{''}, on Coiba Island and other
   Panama forests. Fragrances of four orchid genera, two used extensively
   by E. mixta - Coryanthes and Mormodes - and two never used, Clowesia and
   Catasetum - were also analyzed. From among 636 chemicals in 93 male
   tibiae, 66 were also found in 30 floral head-space samples of orchids,
   in which 315 total volatile compounds were detected. Geographic
   variation was noteworthy in E. mixta, but no significant difference was
   found between mainland and island populations. The aromatic benzenoids
   methyl salicylate, 2-hydroxy-6-nona-1,3-dienylbenzaldehyde (HNDB), and
   the monoterpene 1,8 cineole, nearly always occurred. Coryanthes or other
   orchids produce two of the chemicals, but no source of HNDB is known. No
   statistical evidence was found of bee preference for orchids with
   bouquets like those formed in bee hindlegs, yet Coryanthes and Mormodes
   produced the most monoterpenes and more resembled the bees, when
   compared to Catasetum and Clowesia. Coiba bee tibial bouquets averaged
   56\% as diverse as on mainland and Coiba has <50\% the euglossine
   species of nearby mainland, but lacks those most similar to E. mixta,
   both in phylogeny and tibial bouquet. Coiba's diverse rain forest should
   contain many volatiles the bees seek. Because odor collection and
   production are costly, our findings strengthen hypotheses that odors are
   used to avoid interspecific reproductive interference. Despite finding
   large differences in the same orchid species, we do not know whether
   isolation of between 107 and 104 years produced differentiation.
   Fragrances seem analogous among orchids and bees, thus may lessen
   interspecific interference or competition, and promote outcrossing or
   favor embellishments, via female choice. Such adaptive reasons for
   fragrance variation within bee or orchid populations remain largely
   untested. Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Title = {{Pollination consequences of simulated intrafloral microbial warming in
   an early-blooming herb}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{142-149}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In habitats where low ambient temperature limits entomophilous
   pollination of early-blooming plants, intrafloral warming facilitates
   pollinator visitation and enhances plant reproductive success. A novel
   mechanism for intrafloral warming was described recently for the
   early-blooming, bumblebee pollinated herb Helleborus foetidus
   (Ranunculaceae) where the warming agent was the metabolic heat
   dissipated by dense populations of the nectar-specialist yeast
   Metschnikowia reukaufii. This paper reports results of field experiments
   conducted over three consecutive years aimed at (1) ascertaining whether
   flowers of H. foetidus with warmed interiors differed in pollination
   success from flowers experiencing natural intrafloral microclimate; and
   (2) testing the hypothesis that the pollination effects of intrafloral
   warming should be stronger during the early stages of the H. foetidus
   flowering season, when inclement weather and low ambient temperatures
   often limit pollinator activity. Intrafloral warming resulted in
   increased number of pollen tubes per style and reduced probability of
   pollen limitation early in the flowering season, while these effects
   were reversed in late-season flowers. Since the number of pollen tubes
   was directly correlated with number of pollen grains on the stigma,
   fruit set and number of seeds produced by individual flowers, results of
   this study are interpreted as indicating that yeast-induced intrafloral
   warming has the potential to influence reproductive success in H.
   foetidus via effects on pollinator activity, although the nature of
   effects will vary depending on environmental conditions. Results also
   stress the importance of ambient and floral temperature for the
   pollination of early-blooming plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Abstract = {{The food-deceptive orchid Dactylorhiza sambucina is assumed to cheat its
   pollinators effectively by presenting two flower colour morphs. This
   hypothesis implies likely pollinator switches between the yellowand
   purple-flowering plant individuals. However, pollen flow within and
   between morphs has never been tested by means of pollen tracking in a
   dimorphic population under field conditions. We studied a dimorphic
   population located in the southern ``Wienerwald{''}-region to obtain
   frequencies of inter-and intra-morph pollinator switches. Pollinia were
   marked using dye powder to observe pollen flow, i.e. the spatial
   distribution of pollen, pollen export and deposition (i.e. male and
   female reproductive success) as well as the transport distances from
   donator to receptor plants. For analysing the switching behaviour of
   pollinators, we labelled yellow-and purple-flowering individuals
   morph-specifically using two different dye colours. In our study system,
   yellow-flowering plants were dominant (70\% in 2006; 67\% in 2014). We
   labelled 582 pollinia from yellow-and 239 from purple-flowering
   individuals reflecting the yellowdominance (71\%). In total, 473 marked
   pollinia were exported, of which 72.3\% originated from yellow flowers.
   We found that movements of pollinators from yellow to yellow (YY)
   flowers dominate (93 of all 155 deposits of labelled pollen) the four
   possible pollination events by far. Even given the dominance of
   yellow-flowering plants in our study population, only 70 respective
   events (out of 155) would have been expected, if switching behaviour was
   by chance. Therefore, the assumption that pollinators alternate randomly
   between colour morphs was not supported by our results. The longest
   pollen transport distance observed was 237m. Moreover, 135 manually
   conducted cross-pollinations on 47 individuals were evaluated: seed
   viability analyses indicated no differences between the four possible
   crosses. Therefore, the dominance of the yellow morph at our study site
   could be the primary result of the most frequently observed
   cross-combination (i.e. YY). (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {{Two orchids, one scent? Floral volatiles of Catasetum cernuum and

   niche}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{207-216}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important signals in
   plant-pollinator communication and thus subjected to olfactory-mediated
   selection. Occasionally, phylogenetically unrelated plant species will
   converge towards similar patterns of floral scent signalling to harness
   pollinators, representing a common adaptive pollination niche. Catasetum
   cernuum and Gongora bufonia, epiphytic orchids that are native to the
   Atlantic Forest of southeastern South America, are exclusively
   pollinated by male Eufriesea violacea orchid-bees; we hypothesised that
   the two species have converged towards similar floral scent compositions
   to effectively attract these particular fragrance-seeking floral
   visitors. The similarity of the chemical composition of floral scent
   samples obtained through headspace collection was tested using multiple
   approaches of multivariate analyses (Multiple Response Permutation
   Procedure-MRPP). According to MRPP, floral scents of C. cernuum and G.
   bufonia are significantly different. Additionally, the floral scents of
   C. cernuum and G. bufonia present (E)-beta-ocimene and (E)-epoxyocimene
   as their major compounds, respectively. (E)-beta-ocimene is a common
   constituent of floral scents from euglossine-pollinated orchids, while
   (E)-epoxyocimene is quite rare in orchids' floral scents and it is found
   in only a few other species which occur outside the distribution range
   of C. cernuum, G. bufonia and E. violacea. However, 12 out of the 34
   identified VOCs, including (E)-beta-ocimeneand (E)-epoxyocimene, are
   shared between both species. Therefore, we assume that both (E)-beta
   -ocimeneand (E)-epoxyocimene, either alone or mixed with other floral
   VOCs, play a major role in the specific association between these two
   orchids and their exclusive euglossine pollinator. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Pollinator isolation in Louisiana iris: legitimacy and pollen transfer}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{429-441}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background: Iris brevicaulis and Iris fulva can be found in sympatric
   populations in southern Louisiana. Ethological pollinator isolation is
   an important reproductive barrier, as the pollination syndromes of Iris
   brevicaulis flowers result in primarily bumblebee visits, while the
   pollination syndromes of Iris fulva primarily result in hummingbird
   visits. Other potentially important components of pollinator isolation -
   namely, `legitimacy of visitation' (i.e. whether or not a floral visitor
   physically interacts with a flower in such a way that it can pick up
   pollen from an anther or transfer pollen to a stigma) and `pollen
   transfer success' (i.e. whether or not a `legitimate' floral visitor
   successfully transfers pollen from one flower to the stigma of another)
   - have not been explored.
   Hypotheses: Hummingbirds, the primary floral visitors of I. fulva, are
   more likely to visit I fulva pollination units legitimately than they
   are the pollination units of I brevicaulis. Furthermore, hummingbirds
   are more likely to successfully transfer pollen in I. fulva
   intraspecific visitation bouts compared with either interspecific or I.
   brevicaulis intraspecific floral visits. Bumblebees, the primary floral
   visitors of I. brevicaulis, are more likely to visit I brevicaulis
   pollination units legitimately than they are those of I. fulva. In
   addition, bumblebees are more likely to successfully transfer pollen in
   I. brevicaulis intraspecific visitation bouts compared with
   interspecific or I. fulva intraspecific floral visits.
   Methods: We recorded the proportion of legitimate floral visits made by
   bumblebees and hummingbirds to both I. fulva and I. brevicaulis flowers.
   We also assayed intraspecific and interspecific pollen transfer
   effectiveness among bumblebees and hummingbirds visiting I. fulva and I.
   brevicaulis flowers using powdered fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue.
   Results: The proportion of legitimate hummingbird visits was higher in
   I. fulva flowers than in I. brevicaulis flowers, and hummingbirds were
   more effective at transferring pollen among I. fulva flowers than
   between I. fulva and I. brevicaulis flowers or among I. brevicaulis
   flowers. Conversely, the proportion of bumblebee visits that were
   legitimate was higher in I. brevicaulis than in I. fulva, and bumblebees
   were more effective at transferring pollen among I. brevicaulis flowers
   than between I. brevicaulis and I. fulva flowers or among I. fulva
   flowers. Calculations of reproductive isolation (RI) were quite high
   such that reproductive isolation due to hummingbird visitation
   legitimacy was calculated as RI = 0.892, and that due to bumblebee
   visitation legitimacy as RI= 0.557. Isolation due to hummingbird pollen
   transfer efficiency was calculated as RI= 0.747, and that of bumblebees
   as RI= 0.711.}},

Abstract = {{Restoring hedgerows, or other field edge plantings, to provide habitat
   for bees and other beneficial insects on farms is needed to sustain
   global food production in intensive agricultural systems. To date, the
   creation of hedgerows and other restored habitat areas on California
   farms remains low, in part because of a lack of information and outreach
   that addresses the benefits of field edge habitat, and growers' concerns
   about its effect on crop production and wildlife intrusion. Field
   studies in the Sacramento Valley highlighted that hedgerows can enhance
   pest control and pollination in crops, resulting in a return on
   investment within 7 to 16 years, without negatively impacting food
   safety. To encourage hedgerow and other restoration practices that
   enhance farm sustainability, increased outreach, technical guidance, and
   continued policy support for conservation programs in agriculture are
   imperative.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators often tend to visit the same flower type as the last one
   visited, even if more rewarding flower types are available. This
   behaviour is called flower constancy and was hypothesized to promote
   evolution towards specialization of pollination systems. Flower
   constancy nontrivially interacts with pollinator preference for
   different plant species, which has not yet been fully recognized. In the
   present study, we examine the independent relative influences of
   pollinator's preference and flower constancy on plant's gain from
   pollination. We formulate and analyse a general Markov transition matrix
   model of pollinator visitation and parameterize it with field data from
   a system of three plant and two pollinator species.
   Flower constancy generally had weaker effects on plant's gain than
   pollinator preferences. The adaptiveness of manipulating flower
   constancy for plants depends on which mechanism underlying flower
   constancy is assumed to be the dominant one in a given system.
   Interestingly, large areas of preference-constancy parameter space did
   not exhibit any biologically relevant selection pressure on increasing
   pollinator preference or flower constancy, that is selection towards
   specialization of pollination system. This suggests that generalized
   pollination systems may be maintained even in the absence of substantial
   temporal and spatial variation in plant pollinator spectra.}},

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Pollinator-mediated selection on flower phenotypes
   (e.g., shape, color, scent) is key to understanding the adaptive
   radiation of angiosperms, many of which have evolved specialized
   relationships with a particular guild of animal pollinators (e.g.,
   birds, bats, moths, bees). E-beta-Ocimene, a monoterpene produced by
   OCIMENE SYNTHASE (OS) in Mimulus lewisii, is a floral scent important in
   attracting the species' bumblebee pollinators. The taxa closely related
   to M. lewisii have evolved several different pollination syndromes,
   including hummingbird pollination and self pollination (autogamy). We
   are interested in how floral scent variation contributed to species
   diversification in this clade.
   METHODS: We analyzed variation in E-beta-ocimene emission within this
   Mimulus clade and explored its molecular basis through a combination of
   DNA sequencing, reverse transcriptase PCR, and enzyme functional
   analysis in vitro.
   KEY RESULTS: We found that none of the taxa, other than M. lewisii,
   emitted E-beta-ocimene from flowers. But the molecular basis underlying
   loss of E-beta-ocimene emission is unique in each taxon, including
   deletion, missense, or frameshift mutations in the OS gene, and
   potential posttranscriptional downregulation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The molecular evidence suggests that parallel
   loss-of-function in OS is the best explanation for the observed pattern
   of E-beta-ocimene emission, likely as the result of natural selection.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{650-660}},

Abstract = {{Restoration efforts often focus on plants, but additionally require the
   establishment and long-term persistence of diverse groups of nontarget
   organisms, such as bees, for important ecosystem functions and meeting
   restoration goals. We investigated long-term patterns in the response of
   bees to habitat restoration by sampling bee communities along a 26-year
   chronosequence of restored tallgrass prairie in north-central Illinois,
   U.S.A. Specifically, we examined how bee communities changed over time
   since restoration in terms of (1) abundance and richness, (2) community
   composition, and (3) the two components of beta diversity, one-to-one
   species replacement, and changes in species richness. Bee abundance and
   raw richness increased with restoration age from the low level of the
   pre-restoration (agricultural) sites to the target level of the remnant
   prairie within the first 2-3 years after restoration, and these high
   levels were maintained throughout the entire restoration chronosequence.
   Bee community composition of the youngest restored sites differed from
   that of prairie remnants, but 5-7 years post-restoration the community
   composition of restored prairie converged with that of remnants.
   Landscape context, particularly nearby wooded land, was found to affect
   abundance, rarefied richness, and community composition. Partitioning
   overall beta diversity between sites into species replacement and
   richness effects revealed that the main driver of community change over
   time was the gradual accumulation of species, rather than one-to-one
   species replacement. At the spatial and temporal scales we studied, we
   conclude that prairie restoration efforts targeting plants also
   successfully restore bee communities.}},

Pages = {{433-444}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectaries are linked with animal pollinators and floral
   specialization, characterizing some plant groups, such as the mostly
   Neotropical Vochysiaceae. The phylogeny of these plants has been revised
   based on molecular data, but their conspicuous spurs were mostly
   neglected. The appendicular or receptacular origin of these spurs has
   been discussed but without ontogenetic or anatomical study, and the
   association between spur structure and pollination systems was never
   assessed. We studied the spurs of species of four genera of Cerrado
   Vochysiaceae (tribe Vochysieae), documenting their vascularization and
   comparing their structure to previously described pollination systems.
   The spur structure was roughly similar among species, and
   vascularization confirmed their appendicular origin. Subepidermic
   secretory tissue surrounded the lumen of the spur and nectar was
   secreted through nectarostomata. Besides differences in size and cuticle
   striation, no other association between spur structure and pollination
   system was observed. However, the structure is somewhat distinct in
   Qualea parviflora, which sports a pluriseriate internal epidermis
   padding the spur lumen, which may provide protection against damage by
   the large bees that visit these relatively small flowers. The
   conservative histology and vasculature somewhat confirmed the monophyly
   of the tribe Vochysieae and the appendicular origin of the spur in the
   Cerrado Vochysiaceae.}},

Abstract = {{Herein is recognized a distinctive anatomical feature associated with
   spiracular openings of the tracheal system of mature bee larvae. This
   feature, named the flexure, connects each of the 20 spiracular atria to
   the rest of a larva's tracheal systems. It is characterized by its
   greater flexibility compared with other elements in the tracheal
   systems. It obviously is an important link in the respiratory system of
   the larva, but here it is suggested that it may have a biomechanical
   locomotive function of expediting the forward movement of the exterior
   surface of the larva by mechanically decoupling the massive internal
   alimentary tract and fat-body from the larva's exterior covering.
   Further, that flexures collapse during larval diapause strongly suggests
   that they are involved with water conservation during long periods when
   mature bee larvae are inactive.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the nesting biology of cavity nesting hymenoptera (bees and
   wasps) have stimulated many questions related to the behavior, life
   cycle, trophic niche, and sex ratio to better understanding of the life
   history of insects. Leafcutting bees are common insects, and many are
   important and efficient pollinators of crops and other plants. We
   studied the nesting biology of Megachile (Moureapis) maculata in a
   montane semi-deciduous forest in Brazil using trap nests in order to
   improve the knowledge of aspects of the natural history of this
   important pollinator group. During 27 months, 87 nests were collected
   with an average of seven brood cells per nest. Most of the nests were in
   cavities of 0.9 cm in diameter (77\%), and the number of brood cells
   ranged from 1 to 11. Absence of seasonality in nesting behavior suggests
   a multivoltine species. The total mortality rate was 26\%, with the
   cuckoo bee Coelyoxis (Acrocoelioxys) sp. being the main natural enemy
   attacking 15\% of brood cells. The sex ratio is clearly male-biased
   (1:0.42). Females and their brood cells were larger than males and their
   brood cells, which may suggest an imbalance in the energetic cost of
   each sex. The success of this bee species in colonizing trap nests makes
   it an interesting potential opportunity to use this species for
   pollination of cultivated Asteraceae plant species, like sunflower.}},

Abstract = {{Leafcutter bees collect leaf discs to encase brood cells. However, our
   understanding of their use of plants as nesting resources, which is
   critical for their conservation, is poor. We followed plants and
   observed bees cutting leaves to understand the leaf and plant traits of
   the leaf forage plants of Megachile spp. We studied whether the leaf
   size explains the cut size and the number of cuts in the leaves. The
   bees collected leaves from 59 species, 49 genera and 25 families of
   plants of various habits. Plant habit, leaf morphotype and leaf size did
   not influence leaf choice by the bees. Of the plants surveyed, 45.22\%
   had the distinguishable cutting marks. About 63\% and 98\% of the plants
   the bees used are native to the region and to the tropical southern
   hemisphere, respectively. Bees selected leaves over an extreme size
   range, and the leaf size predicted the number of cuts on a leaf.
   Comparing our results with other studies, we conclude that the
   leafcutter bees' selection of plants is adapted to the local
   environment.}},

Title = {{Conflict over non-partitioned resources may explain between-species
   differences in declines: the anthropogenic competition hypothesis}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND SOCIOBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{71}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Human alterations of habitats are causing declines in many species
   worldwide. The extent of declines varies greatly among closely related
   species, for often unknown reasons that must be understood in order to
   maintain biodiversity. An overlooked factor is that seasonally breeding
   species compete for nest sites, which are increasingly limited in many
   anthropogenically degraded environments. I used evolutionary game theory
   to predict the outcome of competition between individuals that differ in
   their competitive ability and timing of nesting. A range of species
   following evolutionarily stable strategies can co-exist when there are
   sufficient nest sites, but my model predicts that a reduction in nest
   site availability has greater impacts on late-nesting species,
   especially the stronger competitors, whereas early-nesting, stronger
   species decline only slightly. These predictions are supported by data
   on 221 bird and 43 bumblebee species worldwide. Restoration and
   provision of nest sites should be an urgent priority in conservation
   efforts. More broadly, these results indicate a new ecological principle
   of potentially widespread importance: rapid reductions in the abundance
   of resources for which species' preferences have not diversified will
   result in unprecedented conflicts that reduce the potential for species
   co-existence.
   Significance statement
   Understanding the causes of species declines is crucial to preventing
   the losses. Whilst much work on species vulnerability shows broad scale
   effects, an enduring mystery is the variation in population trends
   between closely related species. I combined evolutionary modelling with
   three global- scale long- term data sets to reveal that competition for
   scarce nest sites causes variation in declines. The impact of the loss
   of nest sites on differential declines among closely related species
   from very different taxa indicates a new ecological principle of
   widespread importance: the effect of habitat degradation on competition
   among species. A lack of differentiation of nest site preferences means
   that- now nest sites are more limited- some species may be driving
   others to extinction. This phenomenon is likely to occur for any other
   nonpartitioned resources that rapidly, on an evolutionary timescale, are
   now limiting population sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Abundance and diversity of insect pollinators are declining in many
   ecosystems worldwide. The abundance and diversity of wild and managed
   bees are related to the availability of continuous floral resources. In
   particular, in Mediterranean basin countries, the presence of wildflower
   spots enhances the establishment of social Apoidea, since coastal
   regions are usually characterized by pollen and nectar shortage in early
   spring and late summer. Anthyllis barba-jovis produces both nectar and
   pollen as important food source for bees helping them to overcome early
   spring period food shortage. We investigated flowering, seed set, and
   pollinator diversity of A. barba-jovis in arid coastal environments of
   the Mediterranean basin. Pollinator abundance reached a maximum in early
   April. Honeybees were the most common pollinators followed by bumblebees
   and solitary bees. Plants prevented from entomophilous pollination
   showed inbreeding depression with a strong decrease in seed-set. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first report on pollination ecology

Title = {{Is floral morphology a good predictor of floral visitors to Antirrhineae

Abstract = {{The association between plants and flower visitors has been historically
   proposed as a main factor driving the evolutionary change of both flower
   and pollinator phenotypes. The considerable diversity in floral
   morphology within the tribe Antirrhineae has been traditionally related
   to pollinator types. We used empirical data on the flower visitors from
   59 Antirrhineae taxa from the literature and our own field surveys,
   which provide an opportunity to test whether flower phenotypes are
   reliable predictors of visitors and pollinator niches. The degree of
   adjustment between eight key floral traits and actual visitors was
   explored by testing the predictive value of inferred pollinator
   syndromes (i.e. suites of floral traits that characterise groups of
   plant species related to pollination). Actual visitors and inferred
   pollinator niches (categorisation of visitors' association using a
   modularity algorithm) were also explored using Linear Discriminant
   Analysis (LDA). The bee pollinator niche is correctly classified for
   flowers with dull corolla colour, without nectar guides, as the most
   important predictor. Both predictive value and statistical
   classification prove useful in classifying Antirrhineae taxa and the bee
   pollinator niche, mostly as a consequence of the high proportion of
   genera and taxa with occluded corollas primarily visited by bees. Our
   predictive approach rendered a high Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of
   floral traits in the diagnosis of visitors/pollinator niches. In
   particular, a high PPV was found for bees as both visitors and forming
   pollinator niches. In addition, LDA showed that four pollinator niches
   are well defined based on floral traits. The large number of species
   visited by bees irrespective of pollinator syndromes leads us to
   hypothesise their generalist pollinator role, despite the phenotypically
   specialised flowers of Antirrhineae.}},

Abstract = {{Bee populations are decreasing worldwide. The underlying causes are
   likely determined by factors at different scales. We tested the relative
   importance of local resources and landscape connectivity on 64 bumblebee
   (Bombus impatiens) colonies in experimentally isolated and connected
   habitat fragments. We used colony mass, no. of workers, and no. of gynes
   to estimate colony performance. Landscape connectivity did not
   significantly affect colony performance, but local floral resources had
   a significantly positive effect, especially in isolated fragments. These
   results suggest that bumblebee colonies encountered sufficient floral
   resources within the local 1.4 ha habitat fragments to support colony
   growth, making long-distance foraging trips to neighboring fragments
   unnecessary. From a conservation perspective, we suggest that efforts to
   improve colony performance should prioritize boosting local floral
   resources over manipulation of large-scale landscape features.}},

   In addition, four honey bee cohorts were fed imidacloprid in the

Abstract = {{Bees foraging for floral rewards are one of our most thoroughly studied
   examples of generalist foraging ecology. Generalist bees rely
   considerably on instrumental (associative) learning to acquire routines
   that allow them to collect nectar efficiently from diverse plant
   species. Although such bees must also collect pollen from diverse
   species, few studies have examined if and how high efficiency is
   achieved. We characterized how generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens)
   foraged effectively for pollen from diverse floral resources, by
   manipulating the presence of pollen and anther cues, in a series of
   experiments using pollen-bearing live flowers, flowers of a sterile
   pollenless horticultural hybrid, and artificial flowers. We show that
   generalist bumble bees exhibit flexible and effective pollen collection
   by switching between 2 routines: ``scrabbling{''} when pollen is
   abundant and ``sonicating{''} when pollen is scarce. Efficient switching
   between these behaviors is regulated by the interplay of 2 ubiquitous
   floral cues: chemical anther cues stimulating pollen collection behavior
   and mechanical pollen cues suppressing sonication (and eliciting
   scrabbling). Flexible pollen collection behavior is functional: When
   pollen on anthers was scarce, bees collected it at a greater rate by
   sonicating than scrabbling. This mechanism of behavioral flexibility
   likely allows generalist bees to handle diverse anther morphologies
   efficiently and may have facilitated the recurrent evolution of plant
   species that conceal pollen rewards via pored floral morphology. Whereas
   effective nectar foraging relies heavily on associative learning of
   unique routines for each flower type, a weighing of 2 types of cues
   regulates the flexible pollen collection mechanism we describe.}},

Abstract = {{Human impacts are believed to be the main cause of the marked decline in
   bee populations around the world. The ongoing expansion of the urban
   landscape has created obstacles to the establishment of some bee
   species, including those that are important pollinators. However,
   Centris (Hemisiella) tarsata is frequently found in urban landscapes in
   South America and is considered a keystone species in pollination
   programmes. Despite the importance of this species, there are no
   previous studies on the genetic diversity and population structure of C.
   tarsata. In the present study, four mitochondrial genes (cytb, COI, 16S
   and 12S) were analysed in 189 individuals from 16 localities in Brazil.
   The analysis of the concatenated gene sequences (2058 bp) revealed high
   haplotype variability at each sampling site. Ninety-nine highly similar
   haplotypes were found and no differentiation among populations was
   detected. Two haplotypes were shared by most sites, whereas 77 were
   locally restricted. The star-like haplotype network and expansion tests
   indicate that C. tarsata populations underwent expansion during the late
   Pleistocene. The present results and the high potential of the species
   for dispersal lend support to this marked population expansion. Overall,
   the findings indicate that this solitary bee is potentially capable of
   maintaining high levels of genetic diversity in the urban landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between biodiversity and the stability of ecosystem
   function is a fundamental question in community ecology, and hundreds of
   experiments have shown a positive relationship between species richness
   and the stability of ecosystem function. However, these experiments have
   rarely accounted for common ecological patterns, most notably skewed
   species abundance distributions and non-random extinction risks, making
   it difficult to know whether experimental results can be scaled up to
   larger, less manipulated systems. In contrast with the prolific body of
   experimental research, few studies have examined how species richness
   affects the stability of ecosystem services at more realistic, landscape
   scales. The paucity of these studies is due in part to a lack of
   analytical methods that are suitable for the correlative structure of
   ecological data. A recently developed method, based on the Price
   equation from evolutionary biology, helps resolve this knowledge gap by
   partitioning the effect of biodiversity into three components: richness,
   composition, and abundance. Here, we build on previous work and present
   the first derivation of the Price equation suitable for analyzing
   temporal variance of ecosystem services. We applied our new derivation
   to understand the temporal variance of crop pollination services in two
   study systems (watermelon and blueberry) in the mid-Atlantic United
   States. In both systems, but especially in the watermelon system, the
   stronger driver of temporal variance of ecosystem services was
   fluctuations in the abundance of common bee species, which were present
   at nearly all sites regardless of species richness. In contrast,
   temporal variance of ecosystem services was less affected by differences
   in species richness, because lost and gained species were rare. Thus,
   the findings from our more realistic landscapes differ qualitatively
   from the findings of biodiversity-stability experiments.}},

Title = {{A perfume-collecting male oil bee? Evidences of a novel pollination
   system involving Anthurium acutifolium (Araceae) and Paratetrapedia

Journal = {{FLORA}},

Abstract = {{It has been known since Stefan Vogel's observations in 1969 that
   solitary female oil bees collect fatty floral oils from specialized
   oil-secreting plants with the aid of hairy patches on either their legs
   or abdomen, a reward used as food for their larvae and/or to line their
   brood cells. Similar adaptations are also known from male oil bees,
   although the purpose of their oil-collecting behavior has not yet been
   clarified. Here, we describe a novel pollination system involving male
   Paratetrapedia oil bees and the tropical herb Anthurium acutifolium. We
   present ultrastructural morphological details of bee and plant
   structures involved in this interaction and the composition of floral
   scents likely mediating pollinator attraction. Inflorescences of A.
   acutifolium were visited almost exclusively by male P. chocoensis oil
   bees. The bees mopped with a hairy patch of their abdominal sterna 3
   across the inflorescence surface. During this activity on both staminate
   and pistillate stage inflorescences, bees' abdomens and legs became
   loaded with pollen and contacted receptive stigmas. In contrast to what
   has been observed in other angiosperms visited for the collection of
   fatty floral oils, the inflorescences/flowers of A. acutifolium do not
   have structures specialized in oil secretion, i.e., elaiophores. These
   inflorescences, nonetheless, were strongly scented during the time
   interval they were visited by the bees. Gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses of dynamic headspace floral samples
   revealed that inflorescences of both anthetic phases emitted scent
   bouquets consisting mainly of aliphatic esters, indole and uncommmon
   terpenoids (megastigmanes). Interestingly enough, our data suggest that
   the unusual floral scent of A. acutifolium is a perfume reward collected
   by male P. chocoensis oil bees. This pollination system thus bears a
   remarkable resemblence with the interactions between perfume collecting
   male euglossine bees and their preferred flowers, discovered by Stefan
   Vogel half a century ago. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{73-82}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Plant species occupy a continuum from extreme generalization to extreme
   specialization in terms of the number and type of pollinator species
   they utilize, often irrespective of the number of available pollinator
   species. It is largely unclear what floral traits determine the level of
   specialization. Here we study interactions between co-flowering
   oil-producing Diascia species and oil-collecting Rediviva bee species at
   a site in the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa to quantify the
   level of specialization and identify the traits that mediate
   plant-pollinator interactions. Four Rediviva species, encompassing a
   two-fold difference in foreleg-length, all visited two Diascia species,
   which differed eight-fold in spur length, but the longest and
   shortest-legged bee species most frequently and preferentially visited
   long-spurred and short-spurred Diascia species, respectively. A third
   Rediviva species, with forelegs of intermediate length, visited both
   species and did not discriminate between Diascia species. Previously,
   most Diascia species were thought to share similar cues for pollinator
   attraction, however, our study shows that species-specific floral cues
   filter poorly-matching Rediviva species and enable partitioning of the
   local Rediviva assemblage by co-occurring Diascia species. Assessments
   of seed set following single visits by pollinators revealed no
   difference in per-visit effectiveness among Rediviva species, suggesting
   that morphological matching does not necessarily affect pollen
   deposition efficiency and that variation in female reproductive success
   determined by matching between flower and pollinator morphology is an
   unlikely driver of spur-length evolution in Diascia. Further, our study
   raises the intriguing possibility that the nature of reward presentation
   in the long-spurred D. `floribunda' may even counteract specialization
   for exclusive pollination by long-legged species, and, thus, the
   unidirectional evolution of spur length fundamental to the
   co-evolutionary arms races assumed to have driven the evolution of
   elongated spurs. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over the declines of pollinator populations during the last
   decade has resulted in calls from governments and international agencies
   to better monitor these organisms. Recent studies of bee diversity in
   urban environments suggest that cities may contain significant amounts
   of bee species, even greater than surrounding agricultural areas, and in
   some occasions comparable to natural habitats. We conducted a three-year
   survey of bees in the city of St. Louis, MO. Like many other
   post-industrial cities in the United States, St. Louis is considered a
   shrinking city, with many vacant lots and unoccupied structures, mostly
   in the urban core. We sampled a broad range of habitats throughout the
   growing seasons of 2013 to 2016, e.g., vacant lots, city parks,
   community gardens, and urban farms, using aerial netting. This resulted
   in over 7,700 specimens. Data from other surveys, e.g., BioBlitz, and
   personal collections was also utilized in developing the species list.
   These data were supplemented with inspections of entomological
   collections from institutions in the state and the scientific
   literature. We identified a total of 198 species of bees from five
   different families that occur in the city. Only nine of the bee species
   present in the city are non-natives. The city of St. Louis currently
   hosts nearly 45\% of the bee diversity of the state, likely making it
   one of most species-rich cities relative to its state's total bee fauna
   in the country. This represents a great natural resource that must be
   better understood, and has potential conservation implications.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that the diversity of flowering plants can
   enhance pollinator richness and visitation frequency and thereby
   increase the resilience of pollination. It is assumed that flower traits
   explain these effects, but it is still unclear which flower traits are
   responsible, and knowing that, if pollinator richness and visitation
   frequency are more driven by mass-ratio effects (mean trait values) or
   by trait diversity.
   Here, we analyse a three-year data set of pollinator observations
   collected in a European grassland plant diversity experiment (The Jena
   experiment). The data entail comprehensive flower trait measurements,
   including reward traits (nectar and pollen amount), morphological traits
   (height, symmetry, area, colour spectra) and chemical traits
   (nectar-amino acid and nectar-sugar concentration). We test if
   pollinator species richness and visitation frequency of flower
   communities depend on overall functional diversity combining all flower
   traits within a community, single trait diversities (within trait
   variation) and community-weighted means of the single traits, using
   Bayesian inference.
   Overall functional diversity did not affect pollinator species richness,
   but reduced visitation frequency. When looking at individual flower
   traits separately, we found that single trait diversity of flower
   reflectance and flower morphology were important predictors of
   pollinator visitation frequency. Moreover, independent of total flower
   abundance, community-weighted means of flower height, area, reflectance,
   nectar-sugar concentration and nectar-amino acid concentration strongly
   affected both pollinator species richness and visitation frequency.
   Our results, challenge the idea that functional diversity always
   positively affects ecosystem functions. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that
   both single trait diversity and mass-ratio effects of flower traits play
   an important role for diverse and frequent flower visits, which
   underlines the functionality of flower traits for pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Altered precipitation patterns associated with anthropogenic climate
   change are expected to have many effects on plants and insect
   pollinators, but it is unknown if effects on pollination are mediated by
   changes in water availability. We tested the hypothesis that impacts of
   climate on plant-pollinator interactions operate through changes in
   water availability, and specifically that such effects occur through
   alteration of floral attractants.
   We manipulated water availability in two naturally occurring Mertensia
   ciliata (Boraginaceae) populations using water addition, water reduction
   and control plots and measured effects on vegetative and floral traits,
   pollinator visitation and seed set.
   While most floral trait values, including corolla size and nectar,
   increased linearly with increasing water availability, in this
   bumblebee-pollinated species, pollinator visitation peaked at
   intermediate water levels. Visitation also peaked at an intermediate
   corolla length, while its relationship to corolla width varied across
   sites. Seed set, however, increased linearly with water.
   These results demonstrate the potential for changes in water
   availability to impact plant-pollinator interactions through pollinator
   responses to differences in floral attractants, and that the effects of
   water on pollinator visitation can be nonlinear. Plant responses to
   changes in resource availability may be an important mechanism by which
   climate change will affect species interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose and discuss a simple two-dimensional model
   describing the interaction between two species: a plant population that
   gets pollinated by an insect population. The plants attract the insects
   deceiving them and not delivering any reward. We are interested in
   analysing the effect of learning by the insect population due to
   unsuccessfully visiting the deceiving plants. We are especially
   interested in three elements: conditions for the simultaneous
   coexistence of both species, their extinction as a function of the
   biological cost of the deceptiveness for the pollinator, and the
   appearance of oscillations in the dynamics. We also look for conditions
   under which plants would be better off by switching to different
   strategies, in particular, we look for conditions for the existence and
   stability of the equilibria of the corresponding differential equations
   system, and the conditions for the existence of periodic solutions.}},

Abstract = {{For over a decade, our research group has studied the biology of the
   native bumblebee, Bombus atratus, to investigate the feasibility of
   using it to pollinate crops such as tomato, strawberry, blackberry and
   peppers. Traditionally, captive breeding has depended on the use of
   captured wild queens to initiate the colonies. The goal of the current
   work is to investigate conditions required to produce new queens and
   drones in captivity. In this study, 31 colonies were evaluated under
   either greenhouse or open field conditions over a 15 month period. A
   total of 1492 drones (D) and 737 gynes (G, i.e., virgin queens) were
   produced by all colonies, with 16 colonies producing both drones and
   gynes (D\&G), 11 producing only drones (D) and 4 producing neither. Some
   of the D\&G colonies had more than one sexual phase, but no colonies
   produced exclusively gynes. More drones and fewer gynes were produced
   per colony under greenhouse conditions with the highest number of drones
   produced by D\&G colonies. The numbers of immature stages per cell
   declined in colonies as increasingly more resources were allocated to
   the production of gynes and the maintenance of increased nest
   temperature.}},

   Three groups of bee cocoons were selected for each activation term:
   treated with either methoprene or acetone as vehicle control and
   untreated as controls. After the applications were finished the cocoons
   were incubated at temperature 26 degrees C. The emerged adult males and
   females were then kept in the laboratory and fed sucrose solution to

   percentage of emerged adult bees indicated that the bees treated with
   methoprene started to emerge 1-2 days earlier than bees from acetone and

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbance of habitat is considered a contributing factor
   of pollinator declines, but some disturbances such as silviculture, may
   have positive implications for pollinator communities. Silviculture is a
   key source of disturbance in the eastern USA and thus, developing a
   better understanding of its ramifications for these keystone species is
   important for effective ecosystem conservation. We sampled bees in 30
   forest openings created by group selection harvest as well as 30 sites
   in adjacent mature forest to examine the extent to which small forest
   openings support bees, to identify environmental variables influencing
   bee abundance and diversity, and to gauge their potential to augment bee
   populations in adjacent unmanaged forest. Bees were significantly more
   abundant and diverse in forest openings than in mature forest, but
   species composition did not differ. There was no relationship between
   opening size and abundance or diversity of bees in openings or adjacent
   mature forest. Both abundance and diversity were generally positively
   related to the amount of early-successional habitat on the landscape.
   Within openings, overall abundance and diversity decreased with
   vegetation height and increased with a metric representing floral
   richness and abundance. Notably, social, soft-wood-nesting, and small
   bees exhibited the opposite pattern in adjacent forest, increasing with
   vegetation height in openings and decreasing with greater floral
   richness and abundance within openings. Our results suggest that the
   creation of small forest openings helps to promote bees both in openings
   and adjacent mature forest, but this pattern is not consistent for all
   guilds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Flight of the bumble bee: Buzzes predict pollination services}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Multiple interacting factors drive recent declines in wild and managed
   bees, threatening their pollination services. Widespread and intensive
   monitoring could lead to more effective management of wild and managed
   bees. However, tracking their dynamic populations is costly. We tested
   the effectiveness of an inexpensive, noninvasive and passive acoustic
   survey technique for monitoring bumble bee behavior and pollination
   services. First, we assessed the relationship between the first harmonic
   of the flight buzz (characteristic frequency) and pollinator functional
   traits that influence pollination success using flight cage experiments
   and a literature search. We analyzed passive acoustic survey data from
   three locations on Pennsylvania Mountain, Colorado to estimate bumble
   bee activity. We developed an algorithm based on Computational Auditory
   Scene Analysis that identified and quantified the number of buzzes
   recorded in each location. We then compared visual and acoustic
   estimates of bumble bee activity. Using pollinator exclusion
   experiments, we tested the power of buzz density to predict pollination
   services at the landscape scale for two bumble bee pollinated alpine
   forbs (Trifolium dasyphyllum and T. parryi). We found that the
   characteristic frequency was correlated with traits known to affect
   pollination efficacy, explaining 30-52\% of variation in body size and
   tongue length. Buzz density was highly correlated with visual estimates
   of bumble bee density (r = 0.97), indicating that acoustic signals are
   predictive of bumble bee activity. Buzz density predicted seed set in
   two alpine forbs when bumble bees were permitted access to the flowers,
   but not when they were excluded from visiting. Our results indicate that
   acoustic signatures of flight can be deciphered to monitor bee activity
   and pollination services to bumble bee pollinated plants. We propose
   that applications of this technique could assist scientists and farmers
   in rapidly detecting and responding to bee population declines.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{Alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus) is one of Ireland's rarest tree
   species, and in Northern Ireland the species is now restricted to a
   single population in Peatlands Park, Co. Armagh numbering ca. 140 mature
   trees. Genotyping of 95\% of the trees at nine nuclear microsatellite
   loci revealed that levels of genetic diversity within this population
   were generally lower than those reported from larger populations in
   Spain. Analysis of six chloroplast microsatellite loci revealed no
   variation. The level of F-IS was significantly higher than that in the
   Spanish populations, as well as in other populations across Europe,
   potentially indicating inbreeding. Spatial autocorrelation analysis
   indicated some evidence of fine-scale genetic structuring, most likely
   due to limited seed dispersal, but the overall level of differentiation
   between subpopulations was low, indicating high levels of gene flow,
   probably due to cross-pollination by bees. Our results are consistent
   with a gradual population expansion from a limited number of
   individuals. We suggest that more immediate conservation efforts might
   be best focused on ensuring suitable habitat for the continued recovery
   of this isolated population.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticides are well known to have a number of ecological effects.
   However, it is only now becoming understood that sublethal exposures may
   have effects on nontarget insects of conservation concern through
   interactions with immunity, thus increasing detrimental impacts in the
   presence of pathogens. Pesticides and pathogens are suggested to have
   played a role in recent declines of several wild bee pollinators.
   Compromised immunity from exposure to widely used neonicotinoids has
   been demonstrated in honeybees, but further research on interactions
   between neonicotinoids and immunity in other important bees is lacking.
   In this study, adult workers of the bumblebee Bombus impatiens received
   6-day pulses of either low (0.7 ppb) or high (7 ppb) field realistic
   doses of the neonicotinoid imidacloprid prior to assaying immunity and
   survival following a nonpathogenic immune challenge. High-dose
   imidacloprid exposure reduces constitutive levels of phenoloxidase, an
   enzyme involved in melanization. Hemolymph antimicrobial activity
   initially increases in all groups following an immune challenge, but
   while heightened activity is maintained in unexposed and low
   imidacloprid dose groups, it is not maintained in the high exposure dose
   bees, even though exposure had ceased 6 days prior. Additionally,
   imidacloprid exposure followed by an immune challenge significantly
   decreased survival probability relative to control bees and those only
   immune challenged or imidacloprid exposed. A temporal lag for immune
   modulation and combinatorial effects on survival suggest that
   resource-based trade-offs may, in part, contribute to the detrimental
   interactions. These interactions could have health consequences for
   pollinators facing multiple stresses of sublethal neonicotinoid exposure
   and pathogens.}},

Title = {{Fitness-related selection on floral traits in the distylous plant
   Primula poissonii (Primulaceae)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Reproductive fitness of different floral phenotypes varies within and/or
   among populations. These variations are important to understand the
   process of natural selection and the evolution of floral traits. In this
   study, we focused on a distylous, self-incompatible species, Primula
   poissonii, to investigate fitness-related selection on floral traits.
   Our aim was to determine how traits vary as targets of natural selection
   and whether morph-specific selection occurs.
   Methods
   This study was conducted at two sites (Yushuizhai at 2700 m and Haligu
   at 3200 m) in the Lijiang Alpine Botanical Garden, northwestern Yunnan,
   southwestern China. Insects visiting flowers of P. poissonii were
   observed, captured and identified. Randomly selected plants of long-and
   short-styled morphs were labeled. Five floral/inflorescence traits were
   measured including floral display, corolla width (CW), floral tube
   length (FTL), tube opening width (TOW) and floral scape height. Fruit
   and seed set were recorded. The total number of seeds per individual
   plant (plant fitness) and seed production per capsule (flower fitness)
   were calculated. Multiple regression analyses were used to quantify
   selection gradients.
   Important Findings
   The frequencies of the two morphs did not deviate from the expected 1: 1
   ratio at both sites. Except for FTL, the four other traits did not
   differ significantly between the long-and short-styled morphs. Floral
   scape height, floral display and FTL differed between two sites. The
   selection regimes differed between two morphs and between two sites. At
   the Yushuizhai site, linear selection for shorter floral tubes was
   stronger in the short-styled morph. However, nonlinear selection on the
   floral display was stronger in the long-styled morph than selection on
   the short-styled morph. At the Haligu site, linear selection for a
   smaller corolla was stronger in the long-styled morph. A morph-specific
   nonlinear selection on CW and floral display was also detected.
   Morph-specific selections were detected through the estimation of flower
   fitness only in Haligu population. In this site, morph-specific linear
   selection was also detected for CW and floral display. Morph-specific
   nonlinear selection on traits was detected only in CW. We found that
   butterflies and sphingid moths dominated at Yushuizhai, while
   long-tongued bees dominated at Haligu. The difference in pollinator
   fauna suggested that selection on floral tubes may be due to differences
   in pollinator assemblages. Overall, variation of floral and/or
   inflorescence traits in P. poissonii was probably driven by pollinator
   selection. Selection regime differences between two morphs, in part, due
   the inter-morph divergences of sexual functions in distylous plant.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in community composition are an important, but hard to predict,
   effect of climate change. Here, we use a wild-bee study system to test
   the ability of critical thermal maxima (CTmax, a measure of heat
   tolerance) to predict community responses to urban heat-island effects
   in Raleigh, NC, USA. Among 15 focal species, CTmax ranged from 44.6 to
   51.3 degrees C, and was strongly predictive of population responses to
   urban warming across 18 study sites (r(2) = 0.44). Species with low
   CTmax declined the most. After phylogenetic correction, solitary species
   and cavity-nesting species (bumblebees) had the lowest CTmax, suggesting
   that these groups may be most sensitive to climate change. Community
   responses to urban and global warming will likely retain strong
   physiological signal, even after decades of warming during which time

Abstract = {{The efficiency of pollination depends on factors that favor the transfer
   of pollen-between flowers. The objective of this work was to evaluate
   the influence of the bees visiting flowers of Solanum lycocarpum on the
   reproductive success of plants of this species and the relationship
   between floral morphometry and bees body size. For morphometry
   comparison, 25 flowers of each morph were used. Pollination efficiency
   tests were conducted after isolation of 240 buttons. The contribution of
   the most frequent bee species to the pollen flow among individuals of S.
   lycocarpum was evaluated by counting the number of flowers and shrubs
   visited at each forage. It was verified that in the corollas of the pin
   flowers the gynoecium presents a larger diameter than in those of the
   thrum flowers. The other structures did not differ significantly. Bees
   of the species Centris scopipes and Ephicaris flava were the S. that
   contributed the most to the reproductive' success. of S. lycocarpum,
   since 90\% and 82.5\%, respectively, of the flowers visited once by them
   resulted in fruits. However, foraging by the main visitors in the
   flowers of S. lycocarpum: Centris scopipes, Ephicaris flava, Oxaea
   flavencens, Centris analis and Exoraalopis fulvofasciata favor pollen
   flow and xenogamic cross-pollination in S. lycocarpum individuals.}},

Title = {{AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFICACY AND PEAK CATCH RATES OF EMERGENCE TENTS
   FOR MEASURING BEE NESTING}},
Journal = {{APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Emergence tents are a new tool used to understand
   nesting ecology of ground nesting bee species. However, many questions
   remain about how to use tents effectively. We assessed (a) variance in
   tent capture rates over time, (b) the effects of site characteristics on
   proportion of tents capturing bees, and (c) the effect of soil
   characteristics on nest site choice.
   Methods: Emergence tents were placed out for one week in May, June, and
   August and checked daily. Soil, bee, and floral characteristics were
   recorded.
   Results: Across all sites and months the average number of tents
   capturing bees was less than 20\% during one week of sampling, but this
   varied between sites. Tent captures decreased after 48 h deployment, but
   accumulation differed seasonally, with slower accumulation of total bees
   caught in May than in June or August. Although capture rates were not
   affected by bee or floral abundance, soil moisture beneath a tent
   influenced where bees were captured.
   Discussion: Effective use of emergence tents may require adjusting the
   length of deployment depending on season and will require a minimum of
   48 h installation to help maximize efficacy. The overall low capture
   rates demonstrate the need to optimize emergence tent use.}},

Abstract = {{Luculia plants are famed ornamentals with sweetly fragrant flowers.
   Luculia yunnanensis Hu is an endemic plant from Yunnan Province, China.
   Headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was used to identify the volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) of the different flower development stages of L.
   yunnanensis for the evaluation of floral volatile polymorphism. The
   results showed that a total of 40 compounds were identified at four
   different stages. The main aroma-active compounds were 3-carene,
   alpha-cubebene, alpha-copaene, delta-cadinene, and isoledene. Floral
   scent emission had the tendency to ascend first and descend in
   succession, reaching its peak level at the initial-flowering stage. The
   richest diversity of floral volatiles was detected at the full-flowering
   stage. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that the composition
   and its relative content of floral scent differed at the whole flower
   development stage. In comparison with the other two species of Luculia
   (L. pinceana and L. gratissima), the composition and its relative
   content of floral scent were also different among the tree species.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat restoration is a key measure to counteract negative impacts on
   biodiversity from habitat loss and fragmentation. To assess success in
   restoring not only biodiversity, but also functionality of communities,
   we should take into account the re-assembly of species trait composition
   across taxa. Attaining such functional restoration would depend on the
   landscape context, vegetation structure, and time since restoration. We
   assessed how trait composition of plant and pollinator (bee and
   hoverfly) communities differ between abandoned, restored (formerly
   abandoned) or continuously grazed (intact) semi-natural pastures. In
   restored pastures, we also explored trait composition in relation to
   landscape context, vegetation structure, and pasture management history.
   Abandoned pastures differed from intact and restored pastures in trait
   composition of plant communities, and as expected, had lower abundances
   of species with traits associated with grazing adaptations. Further,
   plant trait composition in restored pastures became increasingly similar
   to that in intact pastures with increasing time since restoration. On
   the contrary, the trait composition of pollinator communities in both
   abandoned and restored pastures remained similar to intact pastures. The
   trait composition for both bees and hoverflies was influenced by flower
   abundance and, for bees, by connectivity to other intact grasslands in
   the landscape. The divergent responses across organism groups appeared
   to be mainly related to the limited dispersal ability and long
   individual life span in plants, the high mobility of pollinators, and
   the dependency of semi-natural habitat for bees. Our results,
   encompassing restoration effects on trait composition for multiple taxa
   along a gradient in both time (time since restoration) and space
   (connectivity), reveal how interacting communities of plants and
   pollinators are shaped by different trait-environmental relationships.
   Complete functional restoration of pastures needs for more detailed
   assessments of both plants dispersal in time and of resources available
   within pollinator dispersal range.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known visual attraction function of angiosperm petals,
   additional roles of these floral organs (e.g. the provision of
   landing-site platforms for pollinators) have rarely been examined. This
   is likely because most petals perform multiple functions, making it
   difficult to isolate the importance of landing sites in pollination
   success. We investigated the landing-site function of dull-coloured
   pinnately branched petals in Mitella pauciflora flowers, which are
   predominantly pollinated by fungus gnats. We conducted a field
   experiment, in which the effects of experimental petal removal on
   pollinators' approach, landing and visit duration and floral
   reproductive success were examined in naturally pollinated flowers.
   According to direct and time-lapse camera observations, petal removal
   did not influence pollinators' approach frequency or visit duration, but
   did significantly decrease their landings. Fruit set and pollen dispatch
   both significantly decreased with petal removal, indicating that petals
   promote female and male reproductive success in M.pauciflora by
   facilitating pollinator landing. This demonstrates that inconspicuous
   petals primarily have a landing-site function rather than a visual
   attraction function in M.pauciflora. Discriminating between diverse
   petal functions is a challenging problem, and new approaches are
   required to elucidate the functional features of angiosperm flowers.

Abstract = {{Generalist plant-pollinator interactions are prevalent in nature. Here,
   we untangle the role of nectar production in the visitation and pollen
   release/deposition in Miconia theizans, a nectar-rewarding plant within
   the specialised pollen-rewarding plant family Melastomataceae. We
   described the visitation rate, nectar dynamics and pollen release from
   the poricidal anthers and deposition onto stigmas during flower
   anthesis. Afterwards, we used a linear mixed model selection approach to
   understand the relationship between pollen and nectar availability and
   insect visitation rate and the relationship between visitation rate and
   reproductive success. Miconia theizans was visited by 86 insect species,
   including buzzing and non-buzzing bees, wasps, flies, hoverflies, ants,
   beetles, hemipterans, cockroaches and butterflies. The nectar produced
   explained the visitation rate, and the pollen release from the anthers
   was best explained by the visitation rate of pollinivorous species.
   However, the visitation rates could not predict pollen deposition onto
   stigmas. Nectar production may explain the high insect diversity and led
   to an increase in reproductive success, even with unpredictable pollen
   deposition, indicating the adaptive value of a generalised pollination
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Four species of western US Osmia (3 Cephalosmia) that are Asteraceae
   specialists (mesoleges) were observed using a stereotypical means of
   collecting pollen-abdominal drumming-to gather pollen from 21 flowering
   species representing nine tribes of Asteraceae. Abdominal drumming is a
   rapid dorso-ventral motion of the female's abdomen (467 pats/min) used
   to directly collect and place pollen in the bee's ventral scopa. A
   co-occurring generalist, O. lignaria, never drummed Asteraceae flowers
   for pollen, but instead used its legs to harvest pollen. Observed
   drumming by several other osmiines is noted. A different
   pollen-harvesting behavior, abdominal tapping, is described for two
   eucerine bees (Melissodes agilis and Svastra obliqua), both oligolectic
   for the Asteraceae. The behavior also involves a dorso-ventral motion,
   but they tap their distal abdominal venter against disk flowers at a
   slower tempo (304 taps/min). These females' distal sternites have
   distinctly dense and long hair brushes for acquiring pollen by this
   behavior. Brief accounts of similar abdominal pollen gathering behaviors
   by other megachilids are summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan (Leguminosae-Mimosoideae) is a
   widely-distributed tree in seasonally dry tropical forests of South
   America that was classified previously as lacking nectaries. However,
   some studies have stated that its flowers produce nectar, while others
   analyzed the composition of unifloral honey produced from A. colubrina
   flowers, raising the question about nectar production in the species. We
   studied the pollination and reproductive biology of A. colubrina var.
   cebil (Griseb.) Altschul in a natural population in the Caatinga,
   northeastern Brazil. Reproductive phenology, sexual system, floral
   biology, resource, and pollinators were investigated. We analyzed the
   breeding system through controlled pollinations for addressing its
   dependence on pollen vectors for reproduction. Anadenanthera colubrina
   flowered in the dry season, flower heads are heteromorphic, with
   staminate flowers at the base and perfect flowers at the apex of the
   inflorescence, characterizing andromonoecy. Anthesis is diurnal. We
   observed small drops of nectar at the apex of the petals of some flowers
   per inflorescence. Together with observations on flower visitor behavior
   and histochemical tests, we propose that A. colubrina produces floral
   nectar at the apex of the corolla, characterizing a substitutive nectary
   (sensu Vogel). This is the first record of substitutive nectary in the
   Mimosoideae and the first record of andromonoecy in the genus. Bees were
   the main pollinators (higher frequency), although other insects such as
   wasps, butterflies, and small beetles were also observed collecting
   nectar and/or pollen. The species is self-incompatible, thus depending
   on insect pollen vectors, mainly bees, for reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{The pump pollination mechanism is typical of basal clades within
   Papilionoideae and might be associated with less efficient pollen
   transfer systems, while the explosive tripping mechanism is considered
   more advanced and might represent the highest expression of the trend in
   pollen economy. Crotalaria pumila, C. stipularia, Desmodium incanum and
   D. subsericeum present secondary pollen presentation with pump and
   explosive pollination mechanisms, respectively. In the present study, we
   evaluate and compare (1) pollen removal, (2) pollen deposition and (3)
   pollen transfer efficiency of both mechanisms, considering single visits
   by Megachile spp., common pollinators of the four plant species in Salta
   Province, Argentina. Comparisons of visit durations are made in relation
   to the type of mechanism and rewards offered. We detected significant
   differences between both mechanisms in the proportion of pollen grains
   removed and deposited in a flower after a single visit of Megachile. We
   found that efficiency in pollen transfer was significantly higher for
   explosive mechanism (2.13 +/- 0.42 pollen grains deposited per 100
   removed) than for pump mechanism (0.33 +/- 0.17 pollen grains deposited
   per 100 removed). This is the first study that compares efficiency
   between pollination mechanisms in this group of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Exclusivity of pollinators, temporal partitioning of shared pollinators
   and divergence in pollen placement on the shared pollinators' bodies are
   mechanisms that prevent interspecific pollen flow and minimize
   competitive interactions in synchronopatric plant species. We
   investigated the floral biology, flower visitors, pollinator
   effectiveness and seasonal flower availability of two syntopic legume
   species of the genus Vigna, V. longifolia and V. luteola, in `restinga'
   vegetation of an island in southern Brazil. Our goal was to identify the
   strategies that might mitigate negative consequences of their
   synchronous flowering. Vigna longifolia and V. luteola were
   self-compatible, but depended on pollinators to set seeds. Only medium
   to large bees were able to trigger the `brush type' pollination
   mechanism. Vigna longifolia, with its asymmetrical corolla and hugging
   mechanism, showed a more restrictive pollination system, with precise
   sites of pollen deposition/removal on the bee's body, compared to V.
   luteola, with its zygomorphic corolla and cymbiform keel. There was a
   daily temporal substitution in flower visitation by the main
   pollinators. Vigna longifolia and V. luteola had overlapping flowering
   phenology but the densities of their flowers fluctuated, resulting in a
   seasonal partitioning of flower visitation. The differences in corolla
   symmetry and mainly the temporal partitioning among pollinators
   throughout the day and the flowering season proved to be important
   factors in maintaining the synchronopatry of V. longifolia and V.
   luteola.}},

Abstract = {{Visitation rates and assemblage composition of pollinators have often
   been related to environmental, ecological and phenotypic variables.
   However, the interaction between flowers and pollinators has not been
   evaluated in a biomechanical context. Floral rewards in keel flowers
   (Fabaceae, Faboideae) are concealed behind four joined petals, the
   keel-wing unit, and are accessible only if pollinators open this unit by
   exerting force on it. Force needed to open the flower is expected to
   affect the interaction with pollinators because pollinators must invest
   time and energy to open the keels. Consequently, plants with stiff
   flowers should be expected to experience diminished visitation
   frequency, particularly by weak visitors. To test this expectation of
   diminished visitation rates and of assemblage composition biased by
   pollinator strength, we measured the force needed to open the keel
   flowers of five co-occurring legume species and, using a canonical
   correspondence analysis (CCA), we tested their association with
   pollinator visitation rates and assemblage composition. We additionally
   included a size flag variable in CCA to test the effect of
   attractiveness on pollinator visits. There was no association between
   flower stiffness and visitation frequency. According to the CCA,
   pollinator assemblage compositions were associated with the force needed
   to open the keel and not flag size. As a general pattern, weak flowers
   are pollinated by an uneven assemblage of weak bees while the stiffest
   flowers are pollinated by an even assemblage of large and strong bees.
   These results supports the idea that force has an effect in controlling
   pollinator assemblage composition.}},

Abstract = {{In spring 2014 and 2016, we studied Rhodanthidium siculum in dunes south
   of Syracuse (Sicily). The females search for one of the frequently empty
   snail shells (mostly of Theba pisana), checking their size. In a
   suitable snail shell, a mixture of sand and saliva is deposited in the
   navel. A severe struggle among several males gets started. At every
   opportunity, the males try to copulate with the females. Large males
   occupy the snail shell that is used by the female to bring in pollen and
   nectar (preferably from Galactites tomentosus, Centaurea sphaerocephala,
   Glebionis coronaria and Lotus creticus). The procedure of harvesting
   lasts about 2-3 h, sometimes several hours. During this period, the
   female is visited for copulation every 2 min (initially even more
   frequently), preferentially by one large male, but small males
   occasionally mate as well. After laying one or two eggs, the female
   closes the snail shell with pieces of seashells or snail shells,
   aggregated with sand and saliva. The female transports the closed snail
   shell to a safe site. Depending on weather conditions, this may take
   several days. The maximum distance of movement observed was about 10 m.
   Finally, the completed snail shell will be buried, most often beneath a
   plant. The burial follows a certain pattern of movement. Females ensure
   higher pollination efficiency than the males due to their higher flower
   constancy.}},

Abstract = {{Males of solitary bees usually spend the night out of the nests. In the
   middle or late afternoon, they stop the patrolling behavior and move on
   to their sleeping places. Usually, they hang with the mandibles on small
   branches of the vegetation or stay inside flowers until the next day. We
   report the sleeping places of males of four Tapinotaspidini species on
   flowers of six plant species of four families. Flowers of three
   Iridaceae species were the most sought by males, especially flowers of
   Sisyrinchium scariosum which show high synchrony between anthesis and
   activity period of Lanthanomelissa discrepans males. Moreover, S.
   scariosum flowers are the most visited by females of L. discrepans which
   are the main pollinators; however, the role of the males as pollinators
   is unclear. Similar situation is evident for the interaction between
   males of Arhysoceble picta and Cuphea glutinosa (Lythraceae), where the
   males take nectar and may act as pollinators, like their females. We
   believe the plants are indirectly benefited by these interactions
   through the maintenance of the male populations of the pollinator bee
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary climatic changes impacted species' demography and
   distribution worldwide. Although response to climate change could have
   been modulated by mutualistic interactions with other species, studies
   exploring the dynamics of these interactions and their role facilitating
   species persistence during past climatic variations are scarce. In this
   work, we attempt to explore the spatial dynamic of Calceolaria polyrhiza
   and its oil-collecting bee pollinators during the last 120,000 years,
   identifying stable areas of persistence and statistically determining
   whether the distribution of pollinator-related floral ecotypes is
   associated with these shared areas of persistence. To do this, we used
   395 presence records of the interacting species and constructed species
   palaeodistribution models. Additionally, we gathered phenotypic measures
   of the plant and used decision tree and multiple regression analyses to
   link the plant phenotypic divergence with the distribution of stable
   areas. Our species distribution models suggest that past climatic
   changes affected the interaction between C. polyrhiza and both bee
   species in time and space. While the interaction between the plant and
   C. caeruleus predominated in the Andean-Patagonian forest and was
   relatively stable in space and time, that was not the case for the
   pollinator C. cineraria in the Patagonian steppe. This, along with our
   analyses of spatial phenotypic divergence, indicates that current floral
   phenotypes are the result of two historical different pollination
   regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Floral scent is a key mediator in many plant-pollinator interactions. It
   is known to vary not only among plant species, but also within species
   among populations. However, there is a big gap in our knowledge of
   whether such variability is the result of divergent selective pressures
   exerted by a variable pollinator climate or alternative scenarios (e.g.,
   genetic drift). Cypripedium calceolus is a Eurasian deceptive
   lady's-slipper orchid pollinated by bees. It is found from near sea
   level to altitudes of 2500 m. We asked whether pollinator climate and
   floral scents vary in a concerted manner among different altitudes.
   Floral scents of four populations in the Limestone Alps were collected
   by dynamic headspace and analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS). Flower visitors and pollinators (the subset of
   visitors with pollen loads) were collected and identified. Preliminary
   coupled gas chromatographic and electroantennographic measurements with
   floral scents and pollinators revealed biologically active components.
   More than 70 compounds were detected in the scent samples, mainly
   aliphatics, terpenoids, and aromatics. Although several compounds were
   found in all samples, and all samples were dominated by linalool and
   octyl acetate, scents differed among populations. Similarly, there were
   strong differences in flower visitor spectra among populations with most
   abundant flower visitors being bees and syrphid flies at low and high
   altitudes, respectively. Pollinator climate differed also among
   populations; however, independent of altitude, most pollinators were
   bees of Lasioglossum, Andrena, and Nomada. Only few syrphids acted as
   pollinators and this is the first record of flies as pollinators in C.
   calceolus. The electrophysiological tests showed that bees and syrphid
   flies sensed many of the compounds released by the flowers, among them
   linalool and octyl acetate. Overall, we found that both floral scent and
   visitor/pollinator climate differ among populations. We discuss whether
   interpopulation variation in scent is a result of pollinator-mediated
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators provide a key service to both natural and agricultural
   ecosystems. Little is reported on the pollination chemoecology of Stevia
   rebaudiana (Asteraceae), a hermaphroditic species producing
   self-incompatible florets in small corymbs. We investigated the
   chemistry of volatiles potentially involved in its pollination system.
   The VOCs emitted by the corymbs of 27 F1 open-pollinated genotypes were
   collected by solid-phase micro-extraction and analyzed by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), as well as morphometric data
   of the genotypes were recorded. Finally, we quantified the abundance of
   pollinators for each genotype. S. rebaudiana flowers were mainly visited
   by bees (Apidae and Halictidae), followed by hoverflies (Diptera:
   Syrphidae). GC-MS indicated that S. rebaudiana was characterized by a
   complex scent profile with large variability among F1 plants.
   Discriminant analysis showed that limonene, delta-elemene and
   bicyclogermacrene were the compounds explaining most of the scent
   bouquet difference between high attractive (> 40 pollinators/plant) from
   low attractive pollinator power (< 40 pollinators/plant). Limonene was
   the most representative VOC among plants that are more attractive to
   pollinators, while high emissions of delta-elemene and bicyclogermacrene
   were linked to plants that are less attractive to pollinators. S.
   rebaudiana morphometric data highlighted that, besides floral VOCs,
   corymb abundance and size, as well as plant height, may route pollinator
   visits. Overall, this study adds knowledge on floral phenology and
   pollinator ecological traits of S. rebaudiana, allowing a deeper
   understanding of its chemical ecology and pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal variation in the availability of food resources may be a
   determining factor for reproductive success and maintenance of bees, but
   the extent of these variations is poorly understood. For management and
   conservation of bees, the first step is to know the behavior and the
   food resources used. Currently, urban areas are considered refuge zones
   for bees, and understanding the availability of floral resources and the
   influence on reproductive processes is very important for management of
   bees. We used the protocols applied in phenological studies with bees
   and plant species to evaluate both throughout the year in an urbanized
   area. At the same time, we used palynology protocols to analyze the
   pollen material collected from brood cells (food and feces) of immature
   Centris analis. These protocols allowed to evaluate the availability of
   floral resources in the studied area and the plant species effectively
   used by C. analis females to feed immature larvae during the
   reproductive period. The maximum reproductive period of C. analis was
   not associated with the highest floral resources availability. However,
   there was a strong selectivity of pollen in flowers of Malpighia
   emarginata (Malpighiaceae), which represented more than 59\% of all the
   pollen grains provisioned throughout the year. This means that in the
   case of more specialized bees like C. analis, the availability of the
   preferred plants is more important than the overall floral resource
   availability in the area. Thus, to keep C. analis in the city, it is
   necessary to maintain or introduce Malpighiaceae species in the urban
   planning. On the other hand, at least 27\% of the plant species found in
   the study area are pollinated by C. analis, emphasizing the importance
   of preserving this bee.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the pollination ecology and floral visitors of the
   noxious weed Centaurea solstitialis is available for several populations
   in its invasive range, but limited information is available in its
   native range, with most studies conducted on the Greek island of Lesvos.
   Herein, we document the visitation pattern of bees and explore the
   relationship of bee body size and nectar availability in weedy
   populations of C. solstitialis from an urban environment within its
   native range in northwestern Turkey. Studies were conducted at patches
   of C. solstitialis in abandoned lots at the Uludag University near the
   city of Bursa. A total of 41 species, including honey bees, belonging to
   five families and 19 genera were recorded. Small megachilid and halictid
   bee species were the most common visitors. Average nectar standing crop
   volume per floret was low (0.003-0.117 mu L) and did not significantly
   vary throughout the day. Average bee head width significantly correlated
   with average nectar standing crop volume but did not significantly
   change throughout the day. Analyses of pollen loads as well as direct
   observations of bee foraging behavior indicate that a large number of
   bees visit C. solstitialis, primarily in search of nectar while carrying
   a large percentage of pollen grains of this plant species on their
   bodies. These results are similar to previous observations on a
   non-weedy population of C. solstitialis from the island of Lesvos.}},

Abstract = {{Many melittophilous flowers display yellow and UV-absorbing floral
   guides that resemble the most common colour of pollen and anthers. The
   yellow coloured anthers and pollen and the similarly coloured flower
   guides are described as key features of a pollen and stamen mimicry
   system. In this study, we investigated the entire angiosperm flora of
   the Alps with regard to visually displayed pollen and floral guides. All
   species were checked for the presence of pollen- and stamen-imitating
   structures using colour photographs. Most flowering plants of the Alps
   display yellow pollen and at least 28\% of the species display pollen-
   or stamen-imitating structures. The most frequent types of pollen and
   stamen imitations were (mostly yellow and UV-absorbing) colour patches
   on petals (65\% of species displaying imitations), patterns of
   inflorescences (18\%), stamen-like pistils (10\%), and staminodes (6\%),
   as well as three-dimensional structures such as convex lower lips and
   filamental hairs (< 5\%). Dichogamous and diclinous species display
   pollen- and stamen-imitating structures more often than non-dichogamous
   and non-diclinous species, respectively. The visual similarity between
   the androecium and other floral organs is attributed to mimicry, i.e.
   deception caused by the flower visitor's inability to discriminate
   between model and mimic, sensory exploitation, and signal
   standardisation among floral morphs, flowering phases, and co-flowering
   species. We critically discuss deviant pollen and stamen mimicry
   concepts and evaluate the frequent evolution of pollen-imitating
   structures in view of the conflicting use of pollen for pollination in
   flowering plants and provision of pollen for offspring in bees.}},

Abstract = {{Time series data on crop yields for two main wind-pollinated crops
   (barley and wheat) and for three crops benefitting from insect
   pollination (turnip rapeseed, caraway, and black currant), were compiled
   from official agricultural statistics. In Finland, these statistics are
   available at aggregate national level, and at the level of each of the
   15 provinces of the country. Yields of wind-pollinated crops have
   steadily increased in Finland, while yields of insect-pollinated crops
   have been highly variable. The largest crop benefitting from insect
   pollination is turnip rapeseed, which shows first a clear tendency to
   increased yields from 1980 to 1993, after which there has been a
   continuous decline in yields at the national average level. Regionally,
   the trends in turnip rapeseed yield show large variation, so that in six
   provinces of Finland, the trend has been significantly decreasing; in
   five provinces, there has been no significant trend; and in two
   provinces, there has been a significant linear increase in yields. Yield
   trends in the two other insect-pollinated crops, caraway and black
   currants, show similar trend variations. However, at the national
   average level, caraway yields show no significant trend, while black
   currant yields have increased during the past 6 years. The possible
   impact on the trends of insect-pollinated crops of three explanatory
   variables was analyzed. Significant linear correlation was found between
   the yield trends (slope of the trends) in rapeseed, and the extent of
   using neonicotinoid seed dressing in the provinces; the magnitude of
   yield decline in turnip rapeseed increased, as the use of neonicotinoid
   seed dressing increased. Similar significant linear correlation was
   found for the magnitude of yield decline in turnip rapeseed and the
   complexity of the agricultural landscape in each province; yield trend
   changed from negative to positive as the proportion of agricultural land
   of the total terrestrial land area declined from 28\% to below 10\%. The
   availability of honey bee colonies with respect to the growing area of
   crops benefitting from insect pollination also had a linear, significant
   impact on turnip rapeseed yield trends: yields tended to decline in
   provinces, where the supply of managed pollinators with respect to
   demand was low, but tended to increase in provinces, where the number of
   honey bee colonies were over 30\% of the estimated demand. As neither
   the landscape complexity (proportion of arable land of total terrestrial
   land area), nor the number of honey bee colonies for pollination have
   changed significantly over the past 10-20 years, these factors cannot
   explain the observed differences in the yield trends of the examined
   insect-pollinated crops. It appears that only the uptake of
   neonicotinoid insecticide seed dressing about 15 years ago can explain
   the crop yield declines in several provinces, and at the national level
   for turnip rapeseed, most likely via disruption of pollination services
   by wild pollinators.}},

   INTERACTIONS}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Premise of the study: To study pollination networks in a changing
   environment, we need accurate, high-throughput methods. Previous studies
   have shown that more highly resolved networks can be constructed by
   studying pollen loads taken from bees, relative to field observations.
   DNA metabarcoding potentially allows for faster and finer-scale
   taxonomic resolution of pollen compared to traditional approaches (e.g.,
   light microscopy), but has not been applied to pollination networks.
   Methods: We sampled pollen from 38 bee species collected in Florida from
   sites differing in forest management. We isolated DNA from pollen
   mixtures and sequenced rbcL and ITS2 gene regions from all mixtures in a
   single run on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We identified species from
   sequence data using comprehensive rbcL and ITS2 databases.
   Results: We successfully built a proof-of-concept quantitative
   pollination network using pollen metabarcoding.
   Discussion: Our work underscores that pollen metabarcoding is not
   quantitative but that quantitative networks can be constructed based on
   the number of interacting individuals. Due to the frequency of
   contamination and false positive reads, isolation and PCR negative
   controls should be used in every reaction. DNA metabarcoding has
   advantages in efficiency and resolution over microscopic identification
   of pollen, and we expect that it will have broad utility for future
   studies of plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-pollinator interactions are essential for successful plant
   reproduction in both natural and agricultural systems. These
   interactions are negatively impacted by recent large-scale alterations
   of the environments, particularly climate change. The responses of
   plants and pollinators to changing abiotic conditions that vary
   seasonally and geographically are often uncoordinated, potentially
   leading to the breakdown of this interaction. The complexity of the
   responses of plants and pollinators to our changing climate necessitates
   creative approaches. The six articles in this special issue directly
   address this need by providing a variety of key methods and reviews of
   current methodology. The articles include: DNA barcoding methods for use
   on pollen collected from visiting bees; methods for assessment of plant
   attraction traits (nectar and review of floral volatiles methods); a
   field sampling method for ground nesting bees; a review of using spatial
   and temporal transplants for addressing changing dynamics of
   plant-pollinator interactions; and a review of approaches used to assess
   potential shifts in phenology of plants and pollinators. Collectively,
   these articles illustrate some of the breadth of approaches needed to
   address the changing dynamics of plant-pollinator interactions.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Heteranthery is thought to reflect a division of labor, with some
   anthers serving a pollinator-feeding function and others serving a
   pollinating function. Mutualism theory predicts that each participant
   should try to maximize the benefit it receives from its partner: plants
   should allocate more pollen to pollination, and pollinators should
   collect more pollen. Accordingly, plant and pollinator may engage in a
   `tug of war' with respect to pollen from each anther type, resulting in
   incomplete division of labor. Here, we explored this idea by conducting
   a fully factorial manipulation of the availability of pollen in long and
   short anthers of staminate flowers of Solanum houstonii. We found the
   following: (1) Bumble bees (Bombus impatiens) preferred to sonicate
   (collect pollen from) short anthers over long anthers, consistent with a
   role as feeding and pollinating anthers, respectively; (2) Blocking
   short anther pores alone increased sonication of long anthers and
   resulted in collection of pollen from long anthers; (3) Blocking long
   anther pores alone did not influence sonication of short anthers; (4)
   The increase in sonication of long anthers, when short anther pores are
   blocked, was greater when pollen was available in long anthers; (5)
   Despite shifting sonication effort to long anthers, bees do not move
   their bodies closer to long anther pores where pollen could be collected
   more effectively; and (6) analysis of the growth of corbicular loads
   over time spent buzzing indicates that significant amounts of pollen are
   collected from long anthers as well as short anthers. We conclude that
   bees can flexibly increase pollen collection from pollinating anthers,
   but are constrained from fully exploiting this pollen. This results in
   checks and balances between plant and bee that may help maintain
   heteranthery.}},

Abstract = {{Using our accumulated datasets from Kenyan savanna, Mediterranean
   garigue, UK gardens and heathland, involving 76 plants from 30 families,
   we present detailed data to quantify the superiority of bees as
   pollinators of most flowering plants when compared with other flower
   visitors. Bees provided the majority of visits to study species at all
   sites, and 33 of the 76 plants received more than 90\% of their visits
   from bees. Furthermore, pollen deposition onto stigmas from single-visit
   events (SVD, a measure of pollination effectiveness) was significantly
   higher for bees than non-bees at all the four sites where a major
   proportion of the flora was sampled. Solitary bees, and also bumblebees
   in temperate habitats, were the best potential pollinators for most
   plants in this respect, and significantly out-performed honeybees. Only
   a few plants were well served by bombyliid flies, and fewer again by
   larger hoverflies, butterflies, or solitary wasps. Bees also achieved
   better matches of their visit timing to peak pollen availability
   (measured indirectly as peak SVD), and made much shorter visits to
   flowers than did non-bees, permitting a substantially greater visit
   frequency. Additionally, they deposited significantly lower levels of
   potentially deleterious heterospecific pollen on stigmas in heathland
   and Mediterranean garigue, though not in the UK garden with densely
   clustered high-diversity flowering, or in the Kenyan savanna site with
   particularly dispersed flowering patches and some specialist non-bee
   flowers. Our data provide a novel and quantified characterisation of the
   specific advantages of bees as flower visitors, and underline the need
   to conserve diverse bee communities.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mutualistic networks are key for the creation and maintenance of
   biodiversity, yet are threatened by global environmental change. Most
   simulation models assume that network structure remains static after
   species losses, despite theoretical and empirical reasons to expect
   dynamic responses. We assessed the effects of experimental single
   bumblebee species removals on the structure of entire flower visitation
   networks. We hypothesized that network structure would change following
   processes linking interspecific competition with dietary niche breadth.
   We found that single pollinator species losses impact pollination
   network structure: resource complementarity decreased, while resource
   overlap increased. Despite marginally increased connectance, fewer plant
   species were visited after species removals. These changes may have
   negative functional impacts, as complementarity is important for
   maintaining biodiversity ecological functioning relationships and
   visitation of rare plant species is critical for maintaining diverse
   plant communities.}},

Title = {{Patterns of population genetic structure and diversity across bumble bee

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{507-520}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of genetic structure and diversity are largely mediated by a
   species' ecological niche and sensitivity to climate variation. Some
   species with narrow ecological niches have been found to exhibit
   increased population differentiation, limited gene flow across
   populations, and reduced population genetic diversity. In this study, we
   examine patterns of population genetic structure and diversity of four
   bumble bee species that are broadly sympatric, but do not necessarily
   inhabit the same ecological niche in the Pacific Northwest of the United
   States. Testing for the effect of isolation by geographic distance (IBD)
   with linearized F-st and D-est found that Bombus sylvicola and B. mixtus
   exhibited significant IBD across populations. In contrast, both B.
   melanopygus and B. flavifrons, two species that are distributed across a
   broad elevation gradient, exhibited no IBD, a result further
   corroborated by Bayesian a priori population assignment tests.
   Furthermore, we discovered that B. sylvicola populations distributed on
   the Olympic Peninsula have significantly less average allelic diversity
   than populations distributed in the Cascade Mountains. Our results
   suggest that populations distributed in the Olympic Mountains represent
   a distinct genetic cluster relative to the Cascade Mountains, with B.
   sylvicola and B. mixtus likely experiencing the greatest degree of
   population genetic differentiation relative to B. flavifrons and B.
   melanopygus. While bumble bees are known to co-exist across a diversity
   of habitats, our results demonstrate that underlying population genetic
   structure and diversity may not necessarily be similar across species,
   and are largely governed by their respective niches.}},

Abstract = {{Mexico and Central America are among the most biodiverse regions on
   Earth, harboring many species with high levels of interpopulation
   morphological and genetic diversity. The mountainous topography of this
   region contains isolated sky island habitats that have the potential to
   promote speciation. This has been studied in vertebrates, yet few
   studies have examined the phylogeographic and genetic structure of
   insect species encompassing this region. Here we investigate geographic
   patterns of genetic and morphological divergence and speciation among
   widespread populations of the highly polymorphic bumble bee Bombus
   ephippiatus and its closest relative B. wilmattae. We used DNA sequences
   from a fragment of cytochrome oxidase I (COI), genotypes for twelve
   microsatellite markers, and morphometric data from wings to construct a
   well-supported inference of the divergences among these taxa. We have
   found complex patterns of genetic isolation and morphological divergence
   within B. ephippiatus across its geographic range and present evidence
   that B. ephippiatus comprises multiple independent evolutionary
   lineages. The pattern of their diversification corresponds to geographic
   and environmental isolating mechanisms, including the Mexican highlands,
   the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico, the
   Nicaraguan Depression, the patchily distributed volcanic ranges in
   Nuclear Central America and Pleistocene glacial cycles. These results
   have important implications for the development and distribution of B.
   ephippiatus as a commercial pollinator in Mexico and Central America.}},

Abstract = {{Population connectivity is an important source of information for
   planning conservation strategy. The degree of connectivity implies using
   alternative conservation prioritizations based on the appropriate
   spatial scale for management units. In species with low population
   connectivity, it is important to preserve local populations in order to
   maintain the species throughout its range. In contrast, species with
   high connectivity require extensive management aiming at preserving gene
   flow through the entire species range. Here we examine at the
   continental scale the relationship between
   inter-population/inter-individual genetic and geographical distances to
   study the isolation-by-distance (IBD) pattern within the European range
   of nine wild bee species. We then assess the suitability of multi-local
   or extensive conservation to ensure their long-term survival. Results
   based on inter-population differences show only two out of nine species
   with significant IBD. European bee populations seem quite connected when
   their IBD is compared to IBD of other phyla. However, our results based
   on inter-individual distances show that eight out of nine species
   display significant IBD. These different results are presumably a
   consequence of potential limitations of the inter-population approach.
   Therefore, we speculate that the inter-population approach could result
   in inaccurate IBD estimations. This approach should therefore be
   replaced by the inter-individual approach in order to provide strong
   supported conservation guidelines. We support multi-local conservation
   programs based on our analysis of inter-individual distances.}},

Abstract = {{During bloom of spring orchard crops, bees are the primary providers of
   pollination service. Monitoring these insects for research projects is
   often done by timed observations or by direct aerial netting, but there
   has been increasing interest in blue vane traps as an efficient passive
   approach to collecting bees. Over multiple spring seasons in Michigan
   and Pennsylvania, orchards were monitored for wild bees using timed
   netting from crop flowers and blue vane traps. This revealed a
   distinctly different community of wild bees captured using the two
   methods, suggesting that blue vane traps can complement but cannot
   replace direct aerial netting. The bee community in blue vane traps was
   generally composed of nonpollinating species, which can be of interest
   for broader biodiversity studies. In particular, blue vane traps caught
   Eucera atriventris (Smith), Eucera hamata (Bradley), Bombus fervidus
   (F.), and Agapostemon virescens (F.) that were never collected from the
   orchard crop flowers during the study period. Captures of bee species in
   nets was generally stable across the 3 yr, whereas we observed
   significant declines in the abundance of Lasioglossum pilosum (Smith)
   and Eucera spp. trapped using blue vane traps during the project,
   suggesting local overtrapping of reproductive individuals. We conclude
   that blue vane traps are a useful tool for expanding insights into bee
   communities within orchard crop systems, but they should be used with
   great caution to avoid local extirpation of these important insects.}},

Abstract = {{Among aroids (Araceae family) with bisexual flowers, the reproductive
   biology of the neotropical genus Monstera (Subfamily Monsteroideae) is
   misunderstood. Nothing is known about the reproductive phenology and the
   sparse evidence on its pollination system is equivocal, suggesting both
   bees and beetles as pollinators. In order to elucidate the pollination
   system and reproductive behavior of Monstera, we documented the floral
   cycle, spathe movement, floral visitors, and heat production of the
   inflorescence, and the flowering and fruiting phenology of M. lentii in
   a montane forest in Costa Rica. We found that M. lentii was mainly
   visited and likely pollinated by nitidulid beetles (Cychrocephalus
   confirms, Nitidulidae) from the Mystropini tribe, which were mainly
   known as palm pollinators so far. In this mutualism, the beetles use the
   floral chamber as shelter, mating place, and probably as brood site.
   Drosophilid flies also visited the inflorescences and might participate
   in a mixed-pollination system, while stingless bees are considered as
   pollen robbers. Flowering and fruiting peaks occurred during the rainy
   season. Floral development was protogynous, a mechanism likely to
   prevent self-pollination. We concluded that pollination in M. lentii
   represents a highly dependent system on biotic pollinators for
   successful fruit set which likely contributes to an out-crossed mating
   system. Our findings indicate that pollination systems of bisexual
   aroids are more diverse than previously suggested. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Volume = {{162}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although urban agriculture is growing in popularity, little is known
   about the distribution of insect pollinators across urbanized
   landscapes. We used the pollination module of InVEST (a suite of
   software models used to map and value ecosystem services), along with
   fine-scale land cover data and empirical data on bee distributions, to
   assess different scenarios of urban pollinator management in Chicago,
   Illinois (USA). Specifically, we simulated the partial conversion of
   lawn/turf-grass to floral resources in city parks only, in gardens
   managed by individual households only, and in any available turf grass
   within buffer distances of 250-1000 m of urban farms, community gardens,
   and home gardens across Chicago. We found that the output of InVEST's
   pollination model was significantly related to empirical measures of bee
   richness (explaining 46\% of the variation) but not bee abundance in
   Chicago. To increase pollination supply at urban farms and community
   gardens, our results indicate that, out of the scenarios presented here,
   the best strategy for the City of Chicago would be to concentrate floral
   resources nearby (within a 250 m buffer rather than within a 1 km
   buffer). In contrast, for home gardens, the model indicates that it may
   be better to increase floral resources throughout the city. This
   discrepancy may be due to the smaller size of home gardens and their
   more dispersed spatial arrangement throughout the city. Generally, our
   results indicate that converting turf grass to a more florally-rich land
   cover would support increased supply of pollinators and urban
   agriculture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape structure is an important determinant of biological fluxes and
   species composition, but species do not respond equally to landscape
   features or spatial extents. Evaluating ``multi-scale{''} responses of
   species to landscape structure is an important framework to be
   considered, allowing insights about habitat requirements for different
   groups. We evaluated the response of Brazilian Cerrado's bees (eusocial
   vs. solitary ones) to both the amount and isolation of remnant
   vegetation in eight nested multiple-local scales. Response variables
   included abundance, observed, and estimated species richness, and beta
   diversity (split into nestedness and turnover resultant
   dissimilarities). Eusocial species' abundance responded to landscape
   structure at narrow scales of fragment isolation (250 m of radius from
   sampling sites), while solitary species' abundance responded to broader
   scales to fragment area (2000 m). Eusocial species nestedness also
   responded to landscape features in broader scales (1500 m), especially
   to increasing fragment isolation. However, all the remaining response
   variables did not respond to any other landscape variables in any
   spatial scale considered. Such contrasting responses of the abundances
   of eusocial vs. solitary species are related to the inherent
   life-history traits of each group. Important attributes in this context
   are different requirements on food resources, population features, and
   flight abilities. Species-specific dispersal abilities may be the main
   determinants of the nested patterns found for eusocial species at 1500
   m. Considering these results, we suggest that different bee groups are
   considered separately in further landscape analyses, especially in other
   Brazilian biomes, for a better understanding of landscape effects on
   these organisms.}},

Title = {{Diversification rates in Antirrhineae (Plantaginaceae): The contribution

Journal = {{PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{39-52}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between range and diversification is an enduring
   evolutionary question. The rich angiosperm diversity stems from several
   factors including variations in geographical distribution and floral
   morphology, which tend to correlate with different pollinator preference
   in many taxa. Pollinator diversity varies among different regions, thus
   range shifts can play an important role in increasing divergence by
   predisposing clades to floral shifts. Antirrhineae is an ideal model to
   examine the effect of range shifts and pollination modes on
   diversification, because the tribe is distributed in the Old World and
   the New World with representatives exhibiting hummingbird pollination in
   the New World, and bee pollination in the Old World and the New World.
   Using ancestral reconstructions and phylogenetic modeling, this study
   investigated the effects of geographic distribution and pollination
   modes on the macroevolution of the tribe Antirrhineae. Our age-range
   correlation analysis showed young nodes had more range overlap than
   older nodes in the phylogeny, suggesting sympatric speciation as a
   contributing factor to the diversification of the tribe. We observed
   similar rates of diversification throughout time with no evident rate
   shifts within the tribe. Old World and New World lineages have similar
   speciation rates in Antirrhineae, and pollination mode did not have a
   significant effect on the diversification of the tribe. However, we
   found evidence for increased diversification rates through long-distance
   dispersal events, which occurred between the Old World and the New World
   four times throughout the evolutionary history of Antirrhineae.
   Therefore, we conclude that long-distance dispersal was a strong
   contributor to the diversity within Antirrhineae.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate species composition, diversity, richness, and monthly
   abundance of orchid bees in different types of dense rainforest in
   different altitudes, the orchid bees were collected for 11 months in
   three vegetation types: dense montane ombrophilous forest (DMOF), dense
   submontane ombrophilous forest (DSOF\_1 and DSOF\_2 in different
   altitudes), and dense lowland ombrophilous forest (DLOF). Using aromatic
   traps 1,945 males of 20 species were collected. The DMOF showed the
   highest species richness (19), and diversity (H' = 2.42), whereas the
   DSOF\_1 showed the highest abundance (775). The DLOF which is the
   largest continuous forest remnant sampled (15,300 ha), showed the lowest
   species richness (11) and diversity index (1.63), additionally presented
   the highest dominance (0,49). Euglossa cordata (Linnaeus) was the most
   abundant species in DLOF, DSOF\_1 and DMOF, while Euglossa ignita Smith
   was the most abundant species in the DSOF\_2. Abiotic factors
   (temperature and humidity) were correlated with abundance of species;
   already the altitude had correlation with dominance and diversity
   parameters. Our results demonstrate that phytophysiognomy influences the
   richness and diversity of orchid bees. The results obtained in DLOF did
   not corroborate what was expected, we attributed these results to the
   management and extractivism activities of the palm tree Attalea funifera
   Martius. Finally, our study reveals the importance of preserving
   different phytophysiognomies within the same biome to conserve orchid
   bees.}},

Title = {{The impact of crop parameters and surrounding habitats on different

Volume = {{243}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service. Pollinators, however, are in
   decline and their service is increasingly threatened. The decline is
   driven by several factors, most of which are related to agricultural
   management. However, the complexity of the landscape system, consisting
   of both cropped and non cropped areas, makes it difficult to address or
   even quantify the role of farming practices in pollinator abundance.
   Therefore, the aim of this paper is to improve our understanding of the
   relationships between pollinator abundance and their habitat use. We
   intend to identify and quantify the driving environmental factors that
   determine pollinator abundance in agricultural landscapes on the crop
   and landscape scale. These information helps us to design algorithms
   that can be used as a basis for predicting pollinator abundance on
   agricultural fields. To integrate varying environmental conditions data
   sampling was performed on farms in three different regions in Germany.
   Pollinators were classified into different groups with three aggregation
   levels. We observed crop parameters as well as landscape parameters in
   the areas surrounding fields in addition to temporal aspects.
   Generalized linear models (GLMs) were then calculated. Our results
   showed that both crop and landscape parameters affect pollinator
   abundance on agricultural fields. However, the explanatory power of the
   included parameters varied strongly among the particular pollinator
   groups and between aggregation levels. Furthermore, differentiation
   between species groups improves the explanatory power compared to models
   that are more aggregated. We also found that the temporal match between
   main activity periods of the particular pollinator groups and resource
   supply by the crop species is a key factor when analysing pollinator
   abundance. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the assessment and
   support of pollination services should be carried out with regard to
   individual pollinator groups. When studying pollinator abundance, the
   crop as well as the landscape scale should be addressed. A range of
   different habitat requirements and different activity periods of the
   pollinator groups must be covered to maintain pollination services, and
   therefore both diverse landscapes and diverse crop rotations are of
   crucial importance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns of genetic structure for some bee species suggest that gene
   flow may be limited across natural and human-created barriers and that
   local dispersal or natal site fidelity may be common. Interestingly,
   this past work has primarily focused on female bees, despite the fact
   that males may differ substantially in their dispersal processes. By
   examining genetic structure and diploidy in males, it is possible to
   gain insight into potential barriers to gene flow and drivers of
   inbreeding. In this study, we examine diploidy as well as regional and
   local spatial genetic structure using males of Bombus vosnesenskii, a
   stable bumble bee species found across western North America.
   Specifically, we investigate patterns of genetic structure in both
   island and mainland populations, across spatial scales, and over a range
   of natural and human-altered habitats. We document high levels of male
   diploidy, with significantly higher levels in mainland populations
   compared to island populations and increasing diploidy in areas with
   poor nesting habitat. Interestingly, we also find evidence of
   significant spatial genetic structure from 0 to 10 km and 0 to 5 km on
   island and mainland populations, respectively. Finally, we document low
   but significant genetic differentiation across the region (Phi(ST) =
   0.049). Overall, this work reveals the unique potential for
   biogeographic context and local habitat composition to drive male
   diploidy patterns in bumble bees.}},

Abstract = {{Orchid bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Euglossini) are important pollinators
   of many plant families in Neotropical forests, habitats that have become
   increasingly degraded and fragmented by agricultural practices. To
   understand the extent to which loss of natural habitat and isolation has
   affected the genetic diversity and diploid male production (DMP) of two
   orchid bee species, Euglossa dilemma and Euglossa viridissima, we
   collected and genotyped 1686 males at five microsatellite loci and
   tested for differences in allelic richness, heterozygosity and DMP
   across three different types of land use (natural, agricultural and
   urban) and between mainland and island populations in the Yucatan
   Peninsula of Mexico. We also investigated the impact of land use and
   geographic isolation on gene flow. Euglossa dilemma and E. viridissima
   seemed to be particularly resilient to loss of natural habitat; in
   locations with human impact, we did not find reduced genetic diversity,
   and populations generally showed very little population genetic
   structure. Only on islands did E. dilemma show significantly reduced
   genetic diversity. Even after accounting for putative null alleles, DMP
   was very low (0.2-1.3\%) across all sampling sites, including on
   islands. We therefore suggest that DMP is an insensitive measure of
   inbreeding and population decline in our two study species.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of habitat can decrease resource availability and restrict
   movement among geographic areas. Persistence in fragmented landscapes
   depends on the maintenance of connectivity among populations, without
   which genetic diversity may decrease and lead to population declines.
   Bees are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of low genetic
   diversity so it is important to understand patterns of dispersal for
   native bees living in fragmented areas. I used population genetic
   techniques to characterize patterns of genetic diversity and dispersal
   for the orchid bee Euglossa imperialis within and among forest fragments
   in southern Costa Rica, in which the furthest two fragments were 226 km
   from one another. In addition, I compared results of population genetic
   analyses conducted with all bees sampled, and results from analyses
   conducted with a reduced dataset containing only one individual per full
   sibling family from each site. For both datasets genetic diversity was
   low within forest fragments, with expected heterozygosity averaging 0.28
   for the full dataset and 0.29 for the dataset containing only one full
   sibling per site. I found no evidence that deforested areas restricted
   dispersal; pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation among forest
   fragments averaged 0.01 for the full dataset, and 0 for the dataset
   containing only one full sibling per site. Genetic distance among sites
   within forest fragments was significantly correlated to geographic
   distance for the full dataset, but there was no significant correlation
   for the dataset that contained only one individual from each full
   sibling family. This suggests that family structure can drive results of
   analyses of genetic structure, although reductions in sample sizes
   following removal of full siblings may have reduced power to detect
   genetic structure. Despite no evidence for restricted dispersal, the low
   genetic diversity found suggests that E. imperialis may be an important
   candidate for future conservation monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation and loss are important drivers of genetic
   differentiation, often leading to a decrease in genetic diversity. Yet,
   natural populations of tropical bees often show a lack of
   differentiation, even in fragmented landscapes, suggesting resilience to
   deal with unfavourable land use. It is not clear what leads to this lack
   of differentiation, but large population sizes, high rates of dispersal
   and stable demography likely play important roles. Here, we investigate
   the population genetic structure and infer the present and historic
   demography of the eusocial stingless bee Partamona bilineata from
   tropical montane cloud forests in Guatemala. We used microsatellites and
   mitochondrial DNA to test for genetic differentiation, to infer
   migration rates, and to evaluate the effects of landscape. We also used
   demographic modelling to trace population sizes over time. We found that
   six populations of P. bilineata exhibited only subtle differentiation,
   with the exception of one site at the edge of the cloud forest, which
   was clearly distinct from all others. Effective population sizes (number
   of colonies) appeared to be rather small (18 +/- 6 colonies) compared to
   the original sample size (N = 51 +/- 9), but stable over time, and
   inferred rates of gene flow were low; yet, no genetic bottleneck was
   detected. A statistical model including elevation was the best in
   explaining the observed pattern of differentiation. We find that P.
   bilineata does not exhibit strong genetic structure, making it a
   resilient species for provision of pollination services. But, at the
   same time, our data point to the potential vulnerability of this and
   similar species, as effective population sizes appear to be low and
   hence populations may be easily affected by future environmental change.
   As such, P. bilineata may be representative of many other tropical
   stingless bees, for which lack of differentiation has been invoked.}},

Abstract = {{A knowledge of the distances regularly travelled by foraging bees is
   essential to understanding the movement of pollen across landscapes, and
   has implications for the conservation of both pollinators and plants.
   Unfortunately, the movements of bees are difficult to measure directly
   at ecologically relevant scales. A common strategy for quantifying the
   foraging ranges of social bees is to sample the genotypes of foragers
   across a landscape. Individual foragers can be assigned to colonies with
   polymorphic genetic markers, and the dispersion of siblings in space can
   be used to make inference about colony locations and foraging movements.
   Several previous studies have sampled sibling genotypes at discrete
   locations (for example, at regular points along a transect), rather than
   in continuous space. Restricting the collection of bees to discrete
   locations presents a number of considerations for sampling design and
   data analysis. In this paper, we develop a spatially-explicit,
   model-based framework for the simulation and estimation of foraging
   ranges. Using these tools, we simulated experiments to characterise the
   efficacy of different sampling strategies, and provide an example with
   actual data that demonstrates the advantages of our method over an
   approach based on regression.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of habitat and chemical use associated with agriculture can cause
   population declines of wild pollinators. Less is known about the
   evolutionary consequences of interactions between species used in
   commercial agriculture and wild pollinators. Given population declines
   of many wild bee species, it is crucial to understand if commercial
   queens become established in natural areas, if wild bees visit
   agricultural fields and have the potential to interact with commercial
   bees, and if gene flow occurs between commercial and wild bees. We drew
   on a long-term data set that documents commercial bumble bee (Bombus
   impatiens) use in New England, and we conducted genetic analyses of
   foraging B. impatiens from areas with varying intensities of commercial
   bee use. In agricultural areas with a history of commercial bee use we
   also sampled bees directly from commercial hives. We found significant
   genetic differences among foraging B. impatiens and B. impatiens sampled
   directly from hives (average pairwise F'(ST) = 0.14), but not among
   samples of foraging bees from natural areas (average F'(ST) among
   foraging bees = 0.002). Furthermore, Bayesian analysis of population
   structure revealed that foraging bees caught in areas with a history of
   commercial bee use grouped with samples from natural areas. These
   results document an agricultural setting where there was no widespread
   introgression of alleles from commercial bumble bees to wild bumble
   bees, commercial bumble bees did not become established in natural
   areas, and wild bees were providing pollination services to crops.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The alfalfa leafcutting bee, Megachile rotundata (ALCB) is an
   economically important pollinator necessary for seed production of the
   critical forage crop alfalfa, Medicago sativa. The pollinator was
   accidentally introduced to North America from Europe approximately 70
   years ago, and it is primarily produced in Canada and shipped to the
   United States annually en masse for seed field pollination. We
   investigate how the large-scale commercial movement of this bee affects
   the genetic structure of populations in the North American seed growing
   system and compare the genetic diversity and structure of introduced
   North American bees with two native European populations. Using 16 newly
   developed microsatellite loci, we describe the North American population
   structure of this bee. ALCBs collected from alfalfa seed farms have a
   degree of genetic variability similar to one native European population,
   but lower than the second. Considering that the species was accidentally
   introduced into North America, we anticipated more signature of a
   founder effect. Despite the level of genetic variability, we found
   little, if any, genetic structuring across North America, other than
   that the North American populations were distinct from the European
   populations sampled. While we detected some sub-structure in North
   American populations using Bayesian methods, the structuring was without
   geographic pattern, and we propose it is the result of the intense human
   management and movement of these bees. The trade and movement of these
   bees by humans has created a nearly panmictic M. rotundata population
   across the continent, which has implications relevant to the
   preservation and conservation of other bee pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{We document a novel exotic bee for North America, Hylaeus (Hylaeus)
   communis Nylander, 1852 (Hymenoptera: Colletidae), and determine whether
   it is likely to spread widely across the continent. To evaluate the
   extent to which H. communis behaves as a generalist and would be able to
   adapt to novel North American environments, we compare the breadth of
   its climatic, floral, habitat, and nesting preferences between its
   native European range and sites where it was first discovered in
   southern Quebec, Canada. Specifically, we calculate the paired
   difference index, which approximates species generalism, from a set of
   bipartite networks linking Hylaeus Fabricius, 1793 species to their
   respective floral hosts and habitats. Results indicate that H. communis
   is the most adaptable bee of the European Hylaeus fauna and will likely
   acclimate to its new environment, being a greater generalist than an
   already widely established exotic bee, H. hyalinatus Smith, 1842. In
   southern Quebec, we find that, despite visiting a wide variety of
   flowering species, it exhibits a strong association with non-native
   plants and resides almost exclusively in urban settings. We hypothesise
   that H. communis will be able to spread widely throughout North America
   via multiple human-mediated but accidental dispersal events and by
   following the distribution of European weeds and horticultural plants.}},

   also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have
   been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to
   pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the
   influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides
   (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite
   Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of
   Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both
   neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success
   individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the
   stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early
   neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite
   effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased
   hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods,
   employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially
   vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for
   which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion
   during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly,
   it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides
   and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a
   critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations
   of these key wild pollinators.}},

   the Ismaila village, Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Pakistan, were
   observed and sampled from June to August 2012 and 2013. Nest details
   were recorded and foraging times on various floral species were
   documented, with bees preferentially nesting in dead wooden stems of
   Poplar (Populus deltoides) and Sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa). The
   dissection of nests was carried out and both nest architecture and
   nesting biology of the species were described. The importance of such

Abstract = {{Background: Mass spectrometry-guided venom peptide profiling is a
   powerful tool to explore novel substances from venomous animals in a
   highly sensitive manner. In this study, this peptide profiling approach
   is successfully applied to explore the venom peptides of a Japanese
   solitary carpenter bee, Xylocopa appendiculata (Hymenoptera: Apoidea:
   Apidae: Anthophila: Xylocopinae: Xylocopini). Although interesting
   biological effects of the crude venom of carpenter bees have been
   reported, the structure and biological function of the venom peptides
   have not been elucidated yet.
   Methods: The venom peptide profiling of the crude venom of X.
   appendiculata was performed by matrix-assisted laser
   desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy. The venom was
   purified by a reverse-phase HPLC. The purified peptides were subjected
   to the Edman degradation, MS/MS analysis, and/or molecular cloning
   methods for peptide sequencing. Biological and functional
   characterization was performed by circular dichroism analysis, liposome
   leakage assay, and antimicrobial, histamine releasing and hemolytic
   activity tests.
   Results: Three novel peptides with m/z 16508, 1939.3, and 1900.3 were
   isolated from the venom of X. appendiculata. The peptide with m/z 16508
   was characterized as a secretory phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) homolog in
   which the characteristic cysteine residues as well as the active site
   residues found in bee PLA(2)s are highly conserved. Two novel peptides
   with m/z 1939.3 and m/z 1900.3 were named as Xac-1 and Xac-2,
   respectively. These peptides are found to be amphiphilic and displayed
   antimicrobial and hemolytic activities. The potency was almost the same
   as that of mastoparan isolated from the wasp venom.
   Conclusion: We found three novel biologically active peptides in the
   venom of X. appendiculata and analyzed their molecular functions, and
   compared their sequential homology to discuss their molecular diversity.
   Highly sensitive mass analysis plays an important role in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are essential pollinators of crops and wild plants, but are
   in decline across the globe. Neonicotinoid pesticides have been
   implicated as a potential driver of these declines, but most of our
   evidence base comes from studies of a single species. There is an urgent
   need to understand whether such results can be generalized across a
   range of species. Here, we present results of a laboratory experiment
   testing the impacts of field relevant doses (1.87-5.32 ppb) of the
   neonicotinoid thiamethoxam on spring-caught wild queens of four
   bumblebee species: Bombus terrestris, B. lucorum, B. pratorum and B.
   pascuorum. Two weeks of exposure to the higher concentration of
   thiamethoxam caused a reduction in feeding in two out of four species,
   suggesting species-specific anti-feedant, repellency or toxicity
   effects. The higher level of thiamethoxam exposure resulted in a
   reduction in the average length of terminal oocytes in queens of all
   four species. In addition to providing the first evidence for general
   effects of neonicotinoids on ovary development in multiple species of
   wild bumblebee queens, the discovery of species-specific effects on
   feeding has significant implications for current practices and policy
   for pesticide risk assessment and use.}},

Title = {{Nicotine in floral nectar pharmacologically influences bumblebee
   learning of floral features}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Many plants defend themselves against herbivores by chemical deterrents
   in their tissues and the presence of such substances in floral nectar
   means that pollinators often encounter them when foraging. The effect of
   such substances on the foraging behaviour of pollinators is poorly
   understood. Using artificial flowers in tightly-controlled laboratory
   settings, we examined the effects of the alkaloid nicotine on bumblebee
   foraging performance. We found that bumblebees confronted simultaneously
   with two equally rewarded nicotine-containing and nicotine-free flower
   types are deterred only by unnaturally high nicotine concentrations.
   This deterrence disappears or even turns into attraction at lower
   nectar-relevant concentrations. The alkaloid has profound effects on
   learning in a dose-dependent manner. At a high natural dose, bees learn
   the colour of a nicotine-containing flower type more swiftly than a
   flower type with the same caloric value but without nicotine.
   Furthermore, after experiencing flowers containing nicotine in any
   tested concentration, increasing numbers of bumblebees stay more
   faithful to these flowers, even if they become a suboptimal choice in
   terms of reward. These results demonstrate that alkaloids enhance
   pollinator flower constancy, opening new perspectives in co-evolutionary
   process between plants and pollinators.}},

Abstract = {{Bumble bees are ubiquitous creatures and crucial pollinators to a vast
   assortment of crops worldwide. Bumble bee populations have been
   decreasing in recent decades, with demise of flower resources and
   pesticide exposure being two of several suggested pressures causing
   declines. Many empirical investigations have been performed on bumble
   bees and their natural history is well documented, but the understanding
   of their population dynamics over time, causes for observed declines,
   and potential benefits of management actions is poor. To provide a tool
   for projecting and testing sensitivity of growth of populations under
   contrasting and combined pressures, we propose a delay differential
   equation model that describes multi-colony bumble bee population
   dynamics. We explain the usefulness of delay equations as a natural
   modeling formulation, particularly for bumble bee modeling. We then
   introduce a particular numerical method that approximates the solution
   of the delay model. Next, we provide simulations of seasonal population
   dynamics in the absence of pressures. We conclude by describing ways in
   which resource limitation, pesticide exposure and other pressures can be
   reflected in the model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{has long been hypothesized that biotic interactions are important
   drivers of biodiversity evolution, yet such interactions have been
   relatively less studied than abiotic factors owing to the inherent
   complexity in and the number of types of such interactions. Amongst the
   most prominent of biotic interactions worldwide are those between plants
   and pollinators. In the Neotropics, the most biodiverse region on Earth,
   hummingbird and bee pollination have contributed substantially to plant
   fitness. Using comparative methods, we test the macroevolutionary
   consequences of bird and bee pollination within a species rich lineage
   of flowering plants: Ruellia. We additionally explore impacts of species
   occupancy of ever-wet rainforests vs. dry ecosystems including cerrado
   and seasonally dry tropical forests. We compared outcomes based on two
   different methods of model selection: a traditional approach that
   utilizes a series of transitive likelihood ratio tests as well as a
   weighted model averaging approach. Analyses yield evidence for increased
   net diversification rates among Neotropical Ruellia ( compared to
   Paleotropical lineages) as well as among hummingbirdadapted species. In
   contrast, we recovered no evidence of higher diversification rates among
   either bee-or non-bee-adapted lineages and no evidence for higher rates
   among wet or dry habitat lineages. Understanding fully the factors that
   have contributed to biases in biodiversity across the planet will
   ultimately depend upon incorporating knowledge of biotic interactions as
   well as connecting microevolutionary processes to macroevolutionary
   patterns.}},

Title = {{A conservation assessment of the terrestrial invertebrate fauna of
   Mkambati Nature Reserve in the Pondoland Centre of Endemism}},
Journal = {{KOEDOE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Mkambati Nature Reserve (NR) falls within the Pondoland Centre of
   Endemism, which is part of the Maputaland-Pondoland-Albany global
   biodiversity hotspot. The biodiversity status of this area is based
   largely on its flora, and the invertebrates are poorly known. The area
   is under threat from various proposed developments. We surveyed 14
   orders in three invertebrate phyla at 26 sites with two main objectives:
   (1) to assess the fauna in terms of conservation value, and, (2) to
   identify habitats and sites of conservation concern. From the survey,
   3231 samples were sent for identification and 425 species were
   identified. A minimum of 18 new species were confirmed. Mkambati NR
   shows exceptional diversity for molluscs (Gastropoda, 51 species), bees
   (Apoidea, 48 species) and true bugs (Heteroptera, 65 species). At least
   43 species collected from the Reserve are South African endemics, 31
   have a restricted distribution within South Africa and 18 are only known
   from the Reserve itself.
   Conservation implications: The authors provide the first assessment of
   the invertebrate fauna of the Mkambati NR, which indicates that it is a
   rich and important fauna. The results highlight the need to consider
   invertebrates in other biodiversity assessments in the Pondoland region.
   In terms of habitats, for both forest and grassland there was a large
   difference in the invertebrate communities at different sites, even over
   relatively short distances in grassland; shared habitat attributes
   clustered sites with more similar communities, for example, rocky ledges
   or the sea shore. All forest patches are a priority for protection.}},

Title = {{Nectar sugars and amino acids in day- and night-flowering Nicotiana
   species are more strongly shaped by pollinators' preferences than

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Floral nectar contains mainly sugars but also amino acids, organic
   acids, inorganic ions and secondary compounds to attract pollinators.
   The genus Nicotiana exhibits great diversity among species in floral
   morphology, flowering time, nectar compositions, and predominant
   pollinators. We studied nectar samples of 20 Nicotiana species, composed
   equally of day-and night-flowering plants and attracting different
   groups of pollinators (e.g. hummingbirds, moths or bats) to investigate
   whether sugars, amino acids, organic acids and inorganic ions are
   influenced by pollinator preferences. Glucose, fructose and sucrose were
   the only sugars found in the nectar of all examined species. Sugar
   concentration of the nectar of day-flowering species was 20\% higher and
   amino acid concentration was 2-3-fold higher compared to the nectar of
   night-flowering species. The sucrose-to-hexose ratio was significantly
   higher in night-flowering species and the relative share of sucrose
   based on the total sugar correlated with the flower tube length in the
   nocturnal species. Flowers of different tobacco species contained
   varying volumes of nectar which led to about 150-fold higher amounts of
   total sugar per flower in bat-or sunbird-pollinated species than in
   bee-pollinated or autogamous species. This difference was even higher
   for total amino acids per flower (up to 1000-fold). As a consequence,
   some Nicotiana species invest large amounts of organic nitrogen for
   certain pollinators. Higher concentrations of inorganic ions,
   predominantly anions, were found in nectar of night-flowering species.
   Therefore, higher anion concentrations were also associated with
   pollinator types active at night. Malate, the main organic acid, was
   present in all nectar samples but the concentration was not correlated
   with pollinator type. In conclusion, statistical analyses revealed that
   pollinator types have a stronger effect on nectar composition than
   phylogenetic relations. In this context, nectar sugars and amino acids
   are more strongly correlated with the preferences of predominant
   pollinators than organic acids and inorganic ions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents detailed comparative descriptions of the mature
   larvae and eggs of Centris (Heterocentris) bicornuta Mocsary and
   Epicharis (Epicharoides) albofasciata Smith as representatives of two
   genera that are closely related. It strongly suggests that both species,
   while developing, pass through five larval instars; because the first
   instar remains mostly pharate within the chorion, it is only as a second
   instar that it begins to consume provisions and increase in size. There
   follows an account of how each species changes in functional anatomy
   from one instar to the next and how each instar of one species compares
   with the same instar of the other.
   In response to a recently published paper (Martins and Melo, 2016),
   which suggested that the tribe Centridini may be polyphyletic because
   some taxa within Centris share features with corbiculate genera, it is
   pointed out that all corbiculate genera uniquely share an apomorphy:
   they bear small paired, elevated, finely setose, sclerotized, and
   usually pigmented apical tubercles on the thoracic segments of mature
   larvae. Such thoracic tubercles are unknown in the Centridini or
   elsewhere among bees.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{62-74}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The process of dispersal can shape ecological communities, but its
   influence is thought to be small compared to the effects of
   environmental variation or direct species interactions, particularly for
   microbial communities. Ants can influence movement patterns of insects
   and the microbes they vector, potentially affecting microbial
   establishment on plants, including in agroecosystems. Here, we examine
   how the presence of aggressive ants, which can influence floral
   visitation by bees and other pollinators, shapes the community
   composition of bacteria and fungi on coffee flowers in farms that differ
   in shade management intensity. We hypothesized that the presence of
   aggressive ants should reduce the frequency and diversity of floral
   visitors. Finally, we predicted that the effects of ants should be
   stronger in the low-shade farm, which has a less diverse community of
   floral visitors. We sampled microbial communities from nectar and
   pistils of coffee flowers near and far from nests of the aggressive ant
   Azteca sericeasur across two farms that vary in shade management and
   diversity of floral visitors. Bacterial and fungal community composition
   was characterized using Illumina sequencing of the 16S and ITS regions
   of the rRNA gene. Consistent with our expectation, Azteca presence was
   associated with a decrease in the number and diversity of visitors,
   visit duration and number of flowers visited. Azteca presence influenced
   microbial communities, but effects differed between farms. Azteca nests
   were associated with higher bacterial diversity in both farms, but the
   difference between flowers on trees with and without Azteca was greater
   in the high-shade farm. Azteca nests were associated with higher fungal
   diversity in the high-shade farm, but not the low-shade farm. In
   addition, the presence of ants was strongly associated with species
   composition of fungi and bacteria in flowers, but differentiation
   between ant and no-ant communities was greater in the low-shade farm.
   Specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were differentially
   associated with the presence of ants. We conclude that indirect
   interactions that influence dispersal may have large effects on
   microbial community composition, particularly in ephemeral microbial
   communities. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Modeling expected fecundity distributions in bee-pollinated forage
   legume polycrosses allows more accurate assessment of true inbreeding
   levels expected in breeding polycrosses. Presented is an empirically
   derived model for expected seed-parent fecundity distributions for a
   given polycross size (N). In this study, N standardized seed-parent
   fecundity frequencies \{{[}Pf(i) - (1/N)]/(1/N)\} were modeled on 169
   polycrosses in four species-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), birdsfoot
   trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum Bieb.),
   and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.)using Weibull distributions (scale
   parameter k, shape parameter lambda). On the basis of all polycrosses,
   it was determined that k could be predicted from lambda using a
   fifth-order polynomial. It was also determined that lambda estimates
   were lognormally distributed (scale parameter zeta = 0.154, shape
   parameter sigma = 0.340, r(2) = 0.991). Polycross lambda estimates were
   not correlated with polycross size (N); however, lambda estimates were
   linearly correlated with a polycross's median number of seeds per plant
   (lambda = 1.46 x 10(-4) {[}median seed per plant] + 0.934, r(2) = 0.446,
   P < 0.0001). Linear model comparisons between alfalfa and red clover
   polycrosses showed that the two species had significantly different
   linear models (P = 0.032). The relationship between lambda estimates and
   median seed per plant is hypothesized to be the result of seed
   production in stressful environments, resulting in lower median
   seed-parent fecundity and greater deviation from random mating in the
   form of larger lambda values. Polycross seed-parent fecundity lambda
   estimates were linearly related to pollen-parent fecundity lambda
   estimates (r(2) = 0.609, P = 0.022).}},

Title = {{Pollen larceny of the tropical weed Solanum torvum by a Fijian endemic

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to colonize new habitats is influenced by their
   dependence on effective pollinators. This can be very important for
   plants that require specialized pollinators, especially when they
   disperse to islands that have low pollinator diversity. One form of
   specialization involves plants that require buzz-pollination, where bees
   must vibrate poricidal anthers at frequencies that allow pollen to be
   released. Pollen larceny is a phenomenon where insects steal' pollen
   from flowers which usually results in reduced pollination, but in some
   cases there can be a small contribution to pollination. Here we report
   pollen larceny in an endemic Fijian halictine bee Homalictus fijiensis
   that steals pollen by chewing anthers of the invasive weed Solanum
   torvum, which is a pollen-only plant requiring buzz pollination. In over
   nine hours of observations at six sites where H. fijiensis visited S.
   torvum, it never attempted to locate nectaries, it never buzzed anthers,
   and instead chewed anther tips, indicating an adaptation to exploit
   nectarless flowers with poricidal anthers without buzz-pollination.
   Analyses of 30 pollen loads from H. fijiensis collected from S. torvum
   flowers indicate 27 of these contained S. torvum pollen, ranging from
   1\% to 99\% of total pollen, indicating it is a pollen vector for this
   plant. Our findings support arguments that super-generalist pollinators
   in island ecosystems can promote the spread of invasive plants, but go
   further by indicating that super-generalist strategies can extend to
   plants with highly specialized pollinator requirements.}},

Abstract = {{1 Managed honey bees play an important role in global crop pollination.
   Maximizing their potential is likely to be of increasing importance to
   the human food supply.
   2 We explored the potential of waggle dance data to determine the
   spatial ecology of honey bees sited in a crop under commercial
   pollination. Over two springs, we video recorded and then decoded 834
   waggle dances from colonies located in two apple and pear farms in Kent,
   U.K. We also obtained pollen samples from returning foragers and
   quantified the insects visiting apple and pear flowers.
   3 The vast majority (84\%) of dances were for locations outside of the
   orchards in which our colonies were located. Accounting for the distance
   of orchards and oilseed rape fields from the study colonies, the amount
   of foraging per hectare in oilseed rape fields was greater than in
   orchards.
   4 The results of the present study indicate that maximizing the
   pollination services of managed honey bee colonies requires an landscape
   level approach that takes into account farm and foraging scale, as well
   as competing floral sources. The data also suggest that oilseed rape is
   a significant competitor to apple and pear flowers for honey bee visits.}},

Abstract = {{Species-specific biochemistry, morphology, and function of the Dufour's
   gland have been investigated for social bees and some non-social bee
   families. Most of the solitary bees previously examined are
   ground-nesting bees that use Dufour's gland secretions to line brood
   chambers. This study examines the chemistry of the cuticle and Dufour's
   gland of cavity-nesting Megachile rotundata and Osmia lignaria, which
   are species managed for crop pollination. Glandular and cuticular lipid
   compositions were characterized and compared to each other and according
   to the nesting experience of adult females. Major lipid classes found
   were hydrocarbons, free fatty acids, and wax esters. Many components
   were common to the cuticle and Dufour's glands of each species, yet not
   identical in number or relative composition. Wax esters and fatty acids
   were more prevalent in Dufour's glands of M. rotundata than on cuticles.
   Wax esters were more abundant on cuticles of O. lignaria than in
   Dufour's glands. In both species, fatty acids were more prevalent in
   glands of field-collected females compared to any other sample type.
   Chemical profiles of cuticles and glands were distinct from each other,
   and, for O. lignaria, profiles of laboratory-maintained bees could be
   distinguished from those of field-collected bees. Comparison of
   percentiles of individual components of cuticular and glandular profiles
   of the same bee showed that the proportions of some cuticular components
   were predictive of the proportion of the same glandular components,
   especially for nesting females. Lastly, evidence suggested that Dufour's
   gland is the major source of nest-marking substances in M. rotundata,
   but evidence for this role in O. lignaria was less conclusive.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Ophrys flowers mimic sex pheromones of attractive females of their
   pollinators and attract males, which attempt to copulate with the flower
   and thereby pollinate it. Virgin females and orchid flowers are known to
   use the same chemical compounds in order to attract males. The
   composition of the sex pheromone and its floral analogue, however, vary
   between pollinator genera. Wasp-pollinated Ophrys species attract their
   pollinators by using polar hydroxy acids, whereas Andrena-pollinated
   species use a mixture of non-polar hydrocarbons. The phylogeny of Ophrys
   shows that its evolution was marked by episodes of rapid diversification
   coinciding with shifts to different pollinator groups: from wasps to
   Eucera and consequently to Andrena and other bees. To gain further
   insights, we studied pollinator attraction in O. leochroma in the
   context of intra- and inter-generic pollinator shifts, radiation, and
   diversification in the genus Ophrys. Our model species, O. leochroma, is
   pollinated by Eucera kullenbergi males and lies in the phylogeny between
   the wasp and Andrena-pollinated species; therefore, it is a remarkable
   point to understand pollinator shifts. We collected surface extracts of
   attractive E. kullenbergi females and labellum extracts of O. leochroma
   and analyzed them by using gas chromatography with electroantennographic
   detection (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS). We also performed field bioassays. Our results show that O.
   leochroma mimics the sex pheromone of its pollinator's female by using
   aldehydes, alcohols, fatty acids, and non-polar compounds
   (hydrocarbons). Therefore, in terms of the chemistry of pollinator
   attraction, Eucera-pollinated Ophrys species might represent an
   intermediate stage between wasp- and Andrena-pollinated orchid species.}},

Abstract = {{We compare the diversity of bees in the Chilean fauna as understood from
   traditional taxonomy-based catalogues with that currently known from DNA
   barcodes using the BIN system informed by ongoing morphology-based
   taxonomic research. While DNA barcode surveys of the Chilean bee fauna
   remain incomplete, it is clear that new species can readily be
   distinguished using this method and that morphological differentiation
   of distinct barcode clusters is sometimes very easy. We assess the
   situation in two genera in some detail. In Lonchopria Vachal one
   ``species{''} is readily separable into two BINs that are easily
   differentiated based upon male mandibular and genitalic morphology
   (characters generally used in this group) as well as female hair
   patterns. Consequently, we describe Lonchopria (Lonchopria) heberti
   Packer and Ruz, new species. For Liphanthus Reed, a large number of new
   species has been detected using DNA barcoding and considerable
   additional traditional morphological work will be required to describe
   them. When we add the number of BINs (whether identified to named
   species or not) to the number of Chilean bee species that we know have
   not been barcoded (both described and new species under study in our
   laboratories) we conclude that the bee fauna of Chile is substantially
   greater than the 436 species currently known. Spanish language abstract

Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The ability to attract pollinators is crucial to
   plants that rely on insects for pollination. We contrasted the roles of
   floral display size and flower color in attracting three bee species and
   determined the relationships between plant attractiveness ( number of
   pollinator visits) and seed set for each bee species.
   METHODS: We recorded pollinator visits to plants, measured plant traits,
   and quantified plant reproductive success. A zero-inflated Poisson
   regression model indicated plant traits associated with pollinator
   attraction. It identified traits that increased the number of bee visits
   and traits that increased the probability of a plant not receiving any
   visits. Different components of floral display size were examined and
   two models of flower color contrasted. Relationships between plant
   attractiveness and seed set were determined using regression analyses.
   KEY RESULTS: Plants with more racemes received more bee visits from all
   three bee species. Plants with few racemes were more likely not to
   receive any bee visits. The role of flower color varied with bee species
   and was influenced by the choice of the flower color model. Increasing
   bee visits increased seed set for all three bee species, with the
   steepest slope for leafcutting bees, followed by bumble bees, and
   finally honey bees.
   CONCLUSIONS: Floral display size influenced pollinator attraction more
   consistently than flower color. The same plant traits affected the
   probability of not being visited and the number of pollinator visits
   received. The impact of plant attractiveness on female reproductive
   success varied, together with pollinator effectiveness, by pollinator
   species.}},

Abstract = {{As elsewhere in the world, bumble bees play a vital role as pollinators
   in Uruguay, but knowledge on their health status is still limited.
   Between September 2012 and May 2013, 403 adult individuals of the two
   species of Bombus known for the country (Bombus atratus, Bombus
   bellicosus) were collected in six localities. We found that 177 (119 B.
   atratus, 58 B. bellicosus) were harboring one or two types of pathogens,
   parasites, or parasitoids. Identification of these natural enemies
   carried out by morphological or molecular procedures revealed the
   presence of two species of Microsporidia {[}Nosema ceranae (prevalence:
   18.2 \% in B. atratus; 44.9 \% in B. bellicosus), Tubulinosema pampeana
   (prevalence: 13 \% in B. atratus)], two species of Nematoda
   {[}Sphaerularia bombi (prevalence: 40.4 \% in B. atratus; 40 \% in B.
   bellicosus) and an unidentified Mermithidae (prevalence: 0.8 \% in B.
   bellicosus)], and one species of Diptera parasitoid (prevalence: 3.2 \%
   in B. atratus; 4.2 \% in B. bellicosus). Except N. ceranae, none of the
   other species have been previously reported in Uruguay.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and the diversity of bumblebees have been declining for
   the past decades. While some species remain abundant and widespread,
   others have experienced vast declines. We tested if diet breadth and
   exclusiveness of floral resource use affected abundance and land-use
   response of bumblebees and honeybees in heterogeneous agricultural
   landscapes. Based on an ecological niche modelling approach, we
   discovered that three of 13 species (12 Bombus spp. and A. mellifera)
   responded negatively to land use, while no species responded positively.
   Overall abundance as well as land-use response of different bee species
   was unrelated to resource use. The generalist forager B. lapidarius, the
   slightly more specialised forager B. terrestris/lucorum species complex
   and the specialist forager B. wurflenii declined most with land use.
   Moreover, we found that honeybees and two bumblebee species contained
   higher levels of nitrogen than other non-predatory Hymenoptera and
   performed almost perfect homeostasis despite variable nitrogen contents
   of floral resources. We conclude that at least common species of social
   bees have good nitrogen homeostasis capacity. Generally, our data do not
   support the notion that species with more specialised floral resource
   use are more likely to suffer from land use.}},

Abstract = {{Coevolution of efficient pollinators such as Bombus species (bumblebees)
   with the flowers they pollinate could make them spatially dependent on
   each other, thus affecting their distributions and abilities to colonize
   new areas. As Bombus species show a preference for blue-purple flowers,
   areas with a high diversity of tBombus species should correlate with a
   higher diversity of plants with blue-purple flowers. To investigate
   these relationships, we mapped flower colour distributions in the Arctic
   and tested for correlations with the richness of Bombus species and
   glaciation history. Regional occurrence and abundance of
   insect-pollinated species in the Arctic were obtained from the Panarctic
   Flora Checklist, and flower colour information for 526 species was
   retrieved from the literature, covering on average of 58\% of each
   regional flora. The number of Bombus species within each floristic
   region was approximated from published distribution maps. Our results
   support the prediction that Bombus species have preference for
   blue-purple flower colour and that (re)colonization of species with
   blue-purple flowers in heavily glaciated areas is partly constrained by
   pollinator deficiency. Plant species with white flowers showed an
   opposite trend in distribution to species with blue-purple flowers. Less
   pollinator dependency due to alternative reproduction modes may explain
   the high abundance of white-coloured flowers in Arctic regions, as
   pigment production without the benefit of pollination to offset the
   energy cost may reduce fitness under marginal arctic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Flowers are often viewed by bee pollinators against a variety of
   different backgrounds. On the Australian continent, backgrounds are very
   diverse and include surface examples of all major geological stages of
   the Earth's history, which have been present during the entire
   evolutionary period of Angiosperms. Flower signals in Australia are also
   representative of typical worldwide evolutionary spectral adaptations
   that enable successful pollination. We measured the spectral properties
   of 581 natural surfaces, including rocks, sand, green leaves, and dry
   plant materials, sampled from tropical Cairns through to the southern
   tip of mainland Australia. We modelled in a hexagon colour space, how
   interactions between background spectra and flower-like colour stimuli
   affect reliable discrimination and detection in bee pollinators. We
   calculated the extent to which a given locus would be conflated with the
   loci of a different flower-colour stimulus using empirically determined
   colour discrimination regions for bee vision. Our results reveal that
   whilst colour signals are robust in homogeneous background viewing
   conditions, there could be significant pressure on plant flowers to
   evolve saliently-different colours to overcome background spectral
   noise. We thus show that perceptual noise has a large influence on how
   colour information can be used in natural conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Plant mating systems rapidly respond to pollen limitation in changing
   environments. However, whether and how floral traits are involved in a
   mating system shift requires further investigation. A widely distributed
   and bumblebee-pollinated lousewort, Pedicularis siphonantha D. Don was
   studied. We investigated pollination systems, reproductive success, and
   floral traits in four large populations growing from 3200m to 4300m.
   Pollinator activity in low altitude populations was lower and these
   populations had a decreased fruit set and seed number per capsule
   compared to populations at high altitudes. Supplemental hand pollination
   with outcross pollen significantly increased seed production per capsule
   for plants from high altitudes but not for those from lower altitudes.
   We also found that bumblebees visited more flowers within an
   inflorescence in a single foraging bout in high altitudes compared with
   low altitudes, which caused a high possibility of geitonogamous mating.
   These differences may be pollination-dependent rather than
   inheritance-based because hand pollination on bagged flowers did not
   cause a difference in seed production across populations. Compared to
   plants from low altitudes, high-altitude plants had increased flower
   longevity, larger floral displays, higher pollen production per flower,
   and shorter corolla tubes, which were found to be well in accordance
   with changes in both pollination environment and mating system.
   Plasticity in floral traits might help plants to adjust their resource
   allocation strategies in response to their habitat, which might be
   linked with pollination environment. The variability among these
   populations might be beneficial for this widely distributed species to
   cope with environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{The pollination ecology of the Syagrus orinocensis was studied in the
   course of three consecutive yearly flowering seasons in a foothill
   forest in Casanare, Colombian Orinoco region. Syagrus orinocensis palms
   grow up to 10 m high and produce one to four bisexual, occasionally
   unisexual, inflorescences. The bisexual inflorescences bear staminate
   and pistillate flowers arranged in triads, whereas the unisexual
   inflorescences carry only staminate flowers in dyads. The inflorescences
   are protandric and open during daytime, remaining active for 26 days.
   The male phase extends for the first 15 days, which are followed by 8
   days of an inactive phase; the pistillate phase lasts up to three days.
   The inflorescences of S. orinocensis were visited by 43 species of
   insects belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera. The
   presence of anthophilous insects was primarily restricted to the male
   phase of anthesis, during which the visitors searched for pollen and
   breeding sites; those which visited inflorescences during the female

Abstract = {{1. Land-use change has profoundly impacted pollinator communities
   throughout the world. However, the processes through which it acts on
   pollinator diversity and composition are still poorly understood,
   especially in highly vulnerable island ecosystems.
   2. In this study, we investigated the distribution, abundance, richness
   and composition of flower-visiting insects to assess their response to
   land-use change in Terceira Island (Azores).
   3. Flower-visiting insects were sampled over 2 years using a
   standardised protocol along 50 transects across five different habitats
   corresponding to a land-use gradient. Insect species were classified as
   indigenous or exotics. We assessed changes across habitats using
   multiple diversity indices, species abundance distribution models (SAD)
   and species composition metrics (-diversity), along with plant species
   composition.
   4. We observed that indigenous flower-visiting insects were dominant,
   both in abundance and species richness, across the entire land-use
   gradient. Species diversity varied only slightly across the gradient.
   SADs were lognormal in all habitats, with very few truly common and rare
   flower-visiting insects and a prevalence of species of intermediate
   abundance. Species replacement was significantly higher mainly between
   the two most contrasting habitats (i.e. natural forests and intensive
   pastures) but was significantly correlated with species replacement of
   host plant species across the gradient.
   5. Our results revealed that the Azorean flower-visiting insect
   communities were highly simplified across the entire gradient with
   little difference between habitats. In the absence of strong exotic
   competitors, indigenous flower-visiting insects expand their range and
   occupy new anthropogenic habitats, also facilitating the expansion of a
   large number of exotic plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Context Wild bee populations are currently under threat, which has led
   to recent efforts to increase pollinator habitat in North America.
   Simultaneously, U.S. federal energy policies are beginning to encourage
   perennial bioenergy cropping (PBC) systems, which have the potential to
   support native bees.
   Objectives Our objective was to explore the potentially interactive
   effects of crop composition, total PBC area, and PBC patches in
   different landscape configurations.
   Methods Using a spatially-explicit modeling approach, the Lonsdorf
   model, we simulated the impacts of three perennial bioenergy crops (PBC:
   willow, switchgrass, and prairie), three scenarios with different total
   PBC area (11.7, 23.5 and 28.8\% of agricultural land converted to PBC)
   and two types of landscape configurations (PBC in clustered landscape
   patterns that represent realistic future configurations or in dispersed
   neutral landscape models) on a nest abundance index in an Illinois
   landscape.
   Results Our modeling results suggest that crop composition and PBC area
   are particularly important for bee nest abundance, whereas landscape
   configuration is associated with bee nest abundance at the local scale
   but less so at the regional scale.
   Conclusions Strategies to enhance wild bee habitat should therefore
   emphasize the crop composition and amount of PBC.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Both bird and mixed vertebrate-insect (MVI) pollination systems are very
   rare in Europe and the Mediterranean region. Because MVI can ensure
   reproduction over a wider range of environmental conditions than when
   insects are the sole pollinators, under certain circumstances such
   systems are highly advantageous to plants. Here, we investigated the
   pollination and some reproductive traits of the Tyrrhenian Scrophularia
   trifoliata, the only species of the genus possessing two showy dark
   spots inside the corolla, for which MVI pollination system had been
   inferred on the basis of limited censuses.
   We conducted field experiments to study MVI pollination and some
   reproductive traits and elucidate the role of corolla spots, analysing
   their ultraviolet pattern, histology and pigments versus the rest of the
   corolla.
   The primary pollinators were wasps and passerine birds. Corolla spots
   absorb UV light, present abundant anthocyanins and are histologically
   identical to the rest of the corolla. Control flowers had higher
   visitation frequency than flowers without spots. S.trifoliata is
   self-compatible, with efficient intrafloral protogyny and herkogamy that
   prevent self-pollination but not geitonogamy.
   We confirmed the existence of a mixed bird-insect pollination system in
   S.trifoliata. This system is found in three other Scrophularia species
   with large, showy flowers - two Mediterranean (S.grandiflora and
   S.sambucifolia) and one Macaronesian (S.calliantha). Unlike those
   species, S.trifoliata has two large spots inside the corolla. These
   likely operate as nectar guides and their dark colouration is related to
   abundant anthocyanin content.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing debate regarding the role of pesticides in the global
   decline of bee populations is increasing the demand for use of
   biopesticides, compounds generally believed to be less harmful to
   pollinators. However, there is lack of evidence justifying such
   perceptions, particularly regarding native pollinator species like
   Neotropical stingless bees. Here, we investigated whether azadirachtin,
   a neem-based biopesticide, causes significant lethal and sublethal
   effects on adult workers of the Neotropical stingless bee species
   Melipona quadrifasciata and Partamona helleri. Susceptibility to
   azadirachtin varied with several factors, including the route of
   exposure, the concentration of the biopesticide, and the bee species. We
   found that although azadirachtin did not affect worker bee mortality,
   flight, or respiration rate, it did, however, induce a significant
   antifeeding effect on the stingless bee species.}},

Abstract = {{Clusia shows high infrageneric and sometimes infraspecific diversity in
   growth form, floral morphology and pollination biology. Species offering
   floral resin as a reward to pollinating bees often show unique
   androecial structures. We investigate the stamen structure of two groups
   of Clusia with resin flowers and anthers with numerous locelli: all the
   species of section Polythecandra and Clusia nigrolineata (Clusia section
   Cordylandra). In section Polythecandra the flowers have stamens with a
   short, thick filaments and anthers with numerous locelli
   (microsporangia) without thecal organization. When bees try to remove
   resin, in most species the whole anther detaches from the rest of the
   stamen and then dehisces in the detachment zone in areas where the cells
   have thinner cell walls, a unique mechanism. Stamens of C. nigrolineata
   also have numerous locelli and a broad and short filament, but pairs of
   locelli are disposed in two parallel series and the anthers show a clear
   thecal organization. We discuss the stamen characters in relation to the
   floral biology of the species and suggest that the athecal
   multilocellate anthers of section Polythecandra evolved to minimize
   contact of pollen with the sticky floral resin. The locellate anthers of
   C. nigrolineata, on the other hand, offer a resin-pollen mixture to
   flower visitors in the same way as other species of section Cordylandra
   with normal anthers. In this case, locelli might have evolved to cope up
   with the enlargement of the anthers compared to other species of the
   section. The difference in the organization of the anthers of C.
   nigrolineata and the species of section Polythecandra indicate that
   multilocellate anthers have evolved independently in these groups.}},

Abstract = {{Data sources on species distribution and range are typically expensive
   and time consuming to build, and traditional survey techniques often
   have spatial, temporal, or scale-related gaps. Social network sites, on
   the other hand, can provide massive amounts of cost effective data that
   may potentially yield information of direct benefit to supplement and
   understand ecological phenomena. Previous research explored using social
   network site content to enhance information collected by experts or
   professional surveys in domains including species distribution and land
   cover. However, the data quality and general suitability of social
   network sites data for answering questions related to species
   distribution and range is highly variable and this aspect of its value
   to science remains underexplored.
   In this research we investigate some causes of social network site data
   unreliability and explore how to mitigate them. We filter data points
   based on our estimates of reliability and relevance. We then use the
   filtered data to infer species ranges and distributions in concert with
   Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data. Our proposed
   methodology was applied to four Australian case studies including two
   insect pollinators, and two flowering plants. The case studies were
   chosen from Australia because of its unique geographical features, large
   landmass, sparse population, and the many tourists and residents who
   travel across it taking photos and sharing them through social media. We
   show that, despite some barriers, there are instances where the social
   network site data clearly complement the existing source, making our
   technique a valuable means of making repeatable, efficient additions to
   traditional species distribution data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gentiana leucomelaena manifests dramatic flower color polymorphism, with
   both blue-and white-flowered individuals (pollinated by flies and bees)
   both within a population and on an individual plant. Previous studies of
   this species have shown that pollinator preference and flower
   temperature change as a function of flower color throughout the
   flowering season. However, few if any studies have explored the effects
   of flower color on both pollen viability (mediated by anther
   temperature) and pollinator preference on reproductive success (seed
   set) in a population or on individual plants over the course of the
   entire flowering season. Based on prior observations, we hypothesized
   that flower color affects both pollen viability (as a function of anther
   temperature) and pollen deposition (as a function of pollinator
   preference) to synergistically determine reproductive success during the
   peak of the flowering season. This hypothesis was tested by field
   observations and hand pollination experiments in a Tibetan alpine
   meadow. Generalized linear model and path analyses showed that pollen
   viability was determined by flower color, flowering season, and anther
   temperature. Anther temperature correlated positively with pollen
   viability during the peak of the early flowering season, but negatively
   affected pollen viability during the peak of the mid-to late flowering
   season. Pollen deposition was determined by flower color, flowering
   season (early, or mid-to late season), and pollen viability. Pollen
   viability and pollen deposition were affected by flower color that in
   turn affected seed set across the peak of the flowering season (i.e.,
   when the greatest number of flowers were being pollinated). Hand
   pollination experiments showed that pollen viability and pollen
   deposition directly influenced seed set. These data collectively
   indicate that the preference of pollinators for flower color and pollen
   viability changed during the flowering season in a manner that optimizes
   successful reproduction in G. leucomelaena. This study is one of a few
   that have simultaneously considered the effects of both pollen viability
   and pollen deposition on reproductive success in the same population and
   on individual plants.}},

Abstract = {{While most organisms are negatively affected by anthropogenic
   disturbance, a few species thrive in landscapes altered by humans.
   Typically, native bees are negatively impacted by anthropogenic
   environmental change, including habitat alteration and climate change.
   Here, we investigate the population structure of the eastern carpenter
   bee Xylocopa virginica, a generalist pollinator with a broad geographic
   range spanning eastern North America. Eastern carpenter bees now nest
   almost exclusively in artificial wooden structures, linking their
   geographic distribution and population structure to human activities and
   disturbance. To investigate the population structure of these bees, we
   sampled females from 16 different populations from across their range.
   Nine species-specific microsatellite loci showed that almost all
   populations are genetically distinct, but with high levels of genetic
   diversity and low levels of inbreeding overall. Broadly speaking,
   populations clustered into three distinct genetic groups: a northern
   group, a western group and a core group. The northern group had low
   effective population sizes, decreased genetic variability and the
   highest levels of inbreeding in the data set, suggesting that carpenter
   bees may be expanding their range northward. The western group was
   genetically distinct, but lacked signals of a recent range expansion.
   Climatic data showed that summer and winter temperatures explained a
   significant amount of the genetic differentiation seen among
   populations, while precipitation did not. Our results indicate that
   X.virginica may be one of the rare anthrophilic' species that thrive in
   the face of anthropogenic disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{In the generally bee-pollinated genus Lotus a group of four species have
   evolved bird-pollinated flowers. The floral changes in these species
   include altered petal orientation, shape and texture. In Lotus these
   characters are associated with dorsiventral petal identity, suggesting
   that shifts in the expression of dorsal identity genes may be involved
   in the evolution of bird pollination. Of particular interest is Lotus
   japonicus CYCLOIDEA 2 (LjCYC2), known to determine the presence of
   papillate conical cells on the dorsal petal in L.japonicus.
   Bird-pollinated species are unusual in not having papillate conical
   cells on the dorsal petal.
   Using RT-PCR at various stages of flower development, we determined the
   timing of expression in all petal types for the three putative petal
   identity genes (CYC-like genes) in different species with contrasting
   floral morphology and pollination syndromes.
   In bird-pollinated species the dorsal identity gene, LjCYC2, is not
   expressed at the floral stage when papillate conical cells are normally
   differentiating in bee-pollinated species. In contrast, in
   bee-pollinated species, LjCYC2 is expressed during conical cell
   development.
   Changes in the timing of expression of the above two genes are
   associated with modifications in petal growth and lateralisation of the
   dorsal and ventral petals in the bird-pollinated species. This study
   indicates that changes in the timing, rather than spatial distribution,
   of expression likely contribute to the modifications of petal
   micromorphology and petal size during the transition from bee to bird
   pollination in Macaronesian Lotus species.}},

   development}},
Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Native bee populations are critical sources of pollination.
   Unfortunately, native bees are declining in abundance and diversity.
   Much of this decline comes from human landuse change. While the effects
   of large-scale agriculture on native bees are relatively well
   understood, the effects of urban development are less clear.
   Understanding urbanity's effect on native bees requires consideration of
   specific characteristics of both particular bee species and their urban
   landscape. We surveyed bumble-bee (Bombus spp.) abundance and diversity
   in gardens across multiple urban centres in southeastern Michigan. There
   are significant declines in Bombus abundance and diversity associated
   with urban development when measured on scales in-line with Bombus
   flight ability. These declines are entirely driven by declines in
   females; males showed no response to urbanization. We hypothesize that
   this is owing to differing foraging strategies between the sexes, and it
   suggests reduced Bombus colony density in more urban areas. While
   urbanity reduced Bombus prevalence, results in Detroit imply that
   `shrinking cities' potentially offer unique urban paradigms that must be
   considered when studying wild bee ecology. Results show previously
   unidentified differences in the effects of urbanity on female and male
   bumble-bee populations and suggest that urban landscapes can be managed
   to support native bee conservation.}},

Volume = {{139}},

Abstract = {{There is a pressing need to better understand the factors contributing
   to declines of wild pollinators such as bumblebees. Many different
   contributors have been postulated including: loss of flower-rich
   habitats and nesting sites; monotonous diets; impacts of invasive
   pathogens; exposure to pesticides such as neonicotinoids. Past research
   has tended to investigate the impacts of these stressors in isolation,
   despite the increasing recognition that bees are simultaneously exposed
   to a combination of stressors, with potentially additive or synergistic
   effects. No studies to date have investigated the combined effects of a
   monotonous diet and exposure to pesticides. Using queenless
   micro-colonies of Bombus terrestris audax, we examined this interaction
   by providing bees with monofloral or polyfloral pollen that was either
   contaminated with field-realistic levels of thiamethoxam, a commonly
   used neonicotinoid, or not contaminated. Both treatments were found to
   have a significant effect on various parameters relating to micro-colony
   performance. Specifically, both pesticide treated micro-colonies and
   those fed monofloral pollen grew more slowly than those given polyfloral
   pollen or pollen without pesticides. The two factors appeared to act
   additively. Micro-colonies given monofloral pollens also exhibited lower
   reproductive efforts and produced smaller drones. Although further
   research is needed to examine whether similar effects are found in whole
   colonies, these findings increase our understanding of the nicely
   effects of multiple stressors associated with agricultural
   intensification on bee declines.}},

Abstract = {{Partamona seridoensis is an endemic stingless bee from the Caatinga, a
   Neotropical dry forest in northeastern Brazil. Like other stingless
   bees, this species plays an important ecological role as a pollinator.
   The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic structure
   and evolutionary history of P. seridoensis across its current geographic
   range. Workers from 84 nests from 17 localities were analyzed for COI
   and Cytb genic regions. The population structure tests (Bayesian
   phylogenetic inference, AMOVA and haplotype network) consistently
   characterized two haplogroups (northwestern and eastern), with little
   gene flow between them, generating a high differentiation between them
   as well as among the populations within each haplogroup. The Mantel test
   revealed no isolation by distance. No evidence of a potential geographic
   barrier in the present that could explain the diversification between
   the P. seridoensis haplogroups was found. However, Pleistocene climatic
   changes may explain this differentiation, since the initial time for the
   P. seridoensis lineages diversification took place during the
   mid-Pleistocene, specifically the interglacial period, when the biota is
   presumed to have been more associated with dry conditions and had more
   restricted, fragmented geographical distribution. This event may have
   driven diversification by isolating the two haplogroups. Otherwise, the
   climatic changes in the late Pleistocene must not have drastically
   affected the population dynamics of P. seridoensis, since the Bayesian
   Skyline Plot did not reveal any substantial fluctuation in effective
   population size in either haplogroup. Considering its importance and the
   fact that it is an endemic bee from a very threatened Neotropical dry
   forest, the results herein could be useful to the development of
   conservation strategies for P. seridoensis.}},

Abstract = {{Several biotic and abiotic factors may cause losses during the
   production of watermelon, Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. \& Nakai,
   but there are currently few tools available to quantify losses in the
   different components of crop production. A crop life table can be used
   to understand the factors that regulate losses during crop production to
   establish a sustainable crop management programme. The aim of this study
   was to identify the critical components and quantify the key factors
   affecting yield loss during watermelon production using a crop life
   table as a tool. In 2011 and 2012, watermelon production loss factors in
   the field were evaluated using a completely randomised experimental
   design with 12 replicates, and each replicate consisted of a 64-m(2)
   area containing 4 rows with 4 holes per row. The spacing was 2 x 2 m,
   and each hole initially contained 2 watermelon plants. The loss factors
   of physiological disturbance and insect, fungal, and bacterial attack
   were identified and quantified to develop a crop life table, and the
   primary factors regulating total watermelon yield losses were found to
   be flower abortion, abnormal fruits, and plant death caused by the
   fungus Didymella bryoniae. Watermelon yield losses are highest during
   rainy and humid seasons, and the results of this study show that pests
   and plant physiological disturbance should be jointly managed to attain
   higher watermelon crop yields. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are declining worldwide and possible underlying causes
   include disease, invasive pest species and large scale land use changes
   resulting in habitat loss and degradation. One particular cause of
   habitat degradation is the increased inflow of nutrients due to
   anthropogenic combustion processes and large scale application of
   agricultural fertilizers. This nutrient pollution has been shown to
   affect pollinators through the loss of nectar and pollen-providing plant
   species. However, it may also affect pollinators through altering the
   nectar and pollen chemical composition of plant species, hence
   influencing pollinator food quality. Here, we experimentally
   investigated the effect of nutrient enrichment on amino acid and sugar
   composition of nectar and pollen in the grassland plant Sucissa
   pratensis, and the subsequent colony size and larval mortality of the
   pollinating bumblebee Bombus terrestris. We found less of the essential
   amino acids glycine and arginine in the pollen of fertilized plants, and
   more arginine, ornithine and threonine in the pollen of control plants.
   Nectar glucose and pollen fructose levels were lower in fertilized
   plants as compared to control plants. Furthermore, bumblebee colonies
   visiting fertilized plants showed more dead larvae than colonies
   visiting control plants. Our results suggest that the fitness of
   bumblebees can be negatively affected by changes in their food quality
   following nutrient pollution. If similar patterns hold for other plant
   and pollinator species, this may have far reaching implications for the
   maintenance of pollination ecosystem services, as nutrient pollution
   continues to rise worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{The microRNA (miRNA) pathway is well established to be involved in
   host-pathogen interactions. As key insect pollinators, bees are
   suffering from widely spreading viruses, especially honeybees and
   bumblebees. In order to better understand bee-virus interaction, we
   comparatively analyzed the involvement of the bumblebee miRNA pathway
   upon infection by two different viruses. In our setup, an avirulent
   infection is induced by slow bee paralysis virus (SBPV) and a virulent
   infection is induced by Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV). Our
   results showed the increased expressions of dicer-1 and ago-1 upon SBPV
   infection. There were 17 and 12 bumblebee miRNAs differentially
   expressed upon SBPV and IAPV infections, respectively. These results may
   indicate the involvement of the host miRNA pathway in bumblebee-virus
   interaction. However, silencing of dicer-1 did not influence the genome
   copy number of SBPV. Target prediction for these differentially
   expressed miRNAs showed their possible involvement in targeting viral
   genomic RNA and in the regulation of networks in bumblebee. Our study
   opens a new insight into bee-virus interaction meditated by host miRNAs.}},

Abstract = {{Hymenoptera (sawflies, wasps, ants, and bees) are one of four
   mega-diverse insect orders, comprising more than 153,000 described and
   possibly up to one million undescribed extant species {[}1, 2]. As
   parasitoids, predators, and pollinators, Hymenoptera play a fundamental
   role in virtually all terrestrial ecosystems and are of substantial
   economic importance {[}1, 3]. To understand the diversification and key
   evolutionary transitions of Hymenoptera, most notably from phytophagy to
   parasitoidism and predation (and vice versa) and from solitary to
   eusocial life, we inferred the phylogeny and divergence times of all
   major lineages of Hymenoptera by analyzing 3,256 protein-coding genes in
   173 insect species. Our analyses suggest that extant Hymenoptera started
   to diversify around 281 million years ago (mya). The primarily
   ectophytophagous sawflies are found to be monophyletic. The species-rich
   lineages of parasitoid wasps constitute a monophyletic group as well.
   The little-known, species-poor Trigonaloidea are identified as the
   sister group of the stinging wasps (Aculeata). Finally, we located the
   evolutionary root of bees within the apoid wasp family `` Crabronidae.''
   Our results reveal that the extant sawfly diversity is largely the
   result of a previously unrecognized major radiation of phytophagous
   Hymenoptera that did not lead to wood-dwelling and parasitoidism. They
   also confirm that all primarily parasitoid wasps are descendants of a
   single endophytic parasitoid ancestor that lived around 247 mya. Our
   findings provide the basis for a natural classification of Hymenoptera
   and allow for future comparative analyses of Hymenoptera, including
   their genomes, morphology, venoms, and parasitoid and eusocial life
   styles.}},

Abstract = {{The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse
   lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described
   species and a diversity of life history traits, including
   ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees
   {[}Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps,
   ants, and some bees) {[}1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata
   are the ants, which are ecologically dominant inmost terrestrial
   ecosystems {[}2], and the bees, the most important lineage of
   angiosperm-pollinating insects {[}3]. Establishing the phylogenetic
   affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns
   of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological
   implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding
   (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny
   {[}4-11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level
   relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of
   ants and bees {[}5-7]. We used ultra-conserved element (UCE)
   phylogenomics {[}7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp
   families, gathering sequence data from >800 UCE loci and 187 samples,
   including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon
   dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several
   alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the
   phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly
   supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find
   unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps
   (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We
   also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree
   topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are no previous studies on the reproductive biology of
   the endemic and endangered cactus species Astrophytum ornatum.
   Questions: Is flowering continuous or episodic? What are the breeding
   and mating systems and what floral visitors are associated? and Does the
   reproductive success change over time?
   Study species: Astrophytum ornatum nCactaceae).
   Study site and years of study: Observations from 2010 to 2011, in the
   highest density population of A. ornatum in MetztitlAn Canyon nHgo.
   Mexico).
   Methods: Monthly surveys and monitoring of reproductive structures.
   Tracking flowers in anthesis. Controlled pollinations to determine the
   mating system and determination of the Outcrossing Index nOCI), the
   pollen /ovule ratio and breeding system.
   Results: Astrophytum ornatum produced flower buds throughout the year,
   but 89.2\% of them were aborted. Four events of ephemeral flowering
   population were presented per year. The species is self- incompatible
   and controlled pollinations indicated pollinator limitation of several
   bee species. The OCI indicates that the species is facultative
   xenogamous, and pollen/ovule ratio indicates obligate xenogamy. On
   average there were 54 seeds/fruit and individuals produced 4
   fruits/year.
   Conclusions: The continuous production of buds had rarely been reported
   for cacti. Intrapopulation bloom is one of the shortest recorded for the
   family and it produces high floral synchrony. The low number of seeds
   /fruit and flowers /individual, coupled with the narrow niche breadth of
   species and various anthropogenic factors place Astrophytum ornatum as a
   susceptible species to be extinct.}},

Abstract = {{Paroxystoglossa is a solitary, ground-nesting bee genus. It was revised
   in 1960 and currently includes nine species from Argentina, Brazil and
   Paraguay. The objectives of this contribution are to provide a
   morphological phylogeny for the group and to describe two new species:
   P. levigata n.sp. and P. mourella n.sp. Paroxystoglossa is monophyletic
   and three species groups are recognized, jocasta species group: (P.
   mourella n.sp., (P. brachycera, (P. jocasta, P. barbata))), transversa
   species group: (P. transversa, P. levigata n.sp.), and crossotos species
   group: (P. mimetica, (P. crossotos, P. seabrai, (P. andromache, P.
   spiloptera))). The crossotos and transversa species groups were
   considered as sister groups. Interestingly Paroxystoglossa species have
   very similar male genital capsules an uncommon pattern among
   Augochlorini genera. The species groups have a widely redundant
   distribution indicating replication events in southeastern South
   America. An updated, illustrated key for species identification is also

Title = {{Weak correlation of flower color and nectar-tube depth in temperate

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Nectar is one of the most common floral rewards offered to pollinators
   by plants. Depending on the plant species, nectar is offered openly or
   in tubes of various lengths restricting accessibility of this resource
   for flower visitors with short mouthparts. If attracting pollinators
   that match floral morphology increases pollination efficiency, flowers
   could profit from signaling nectar-tube depth to pollinators. Since
   flower colors are important signals in plant-pollinator communication,
   we investigated whether and which different chromatic or achromatic
   aspects of flower color might indicate nectar-tube depth or whether
   flower colors facilitate the differentiation between flowers with long
   nectar tubes by means of high chromatic uniqueness.
   Methods
   To this end, we collected flower reflectance spectra of 135 grassland
   plant species. We analyzed flower colors as raw reflectance spectra in
   principal component analysis (PCA) and in the color space of honeybees.
   Important Findings
   The correlation between flower colors and tube depths was weak. From the
   bee's point of view, blue flowers had on average deeper tubes than
   green, blue-green and UV-green flowers potentially allowing insects to
   predict tube depths based on blue color. Spectral purity did not
   correlate with nectar-tube depth, nor did the chromatic uniqueness of
   flower colors in the honeybee color space. Dominant wavelength showed a
   significant but very weak correlation with tube depth. The achromatic
   green contrast decreased with increasing tube depth as did brightness;
   thus deep tubes were less conspicuous than shallow tubes. Chromatic
   components resulting from PCA did not or only slightly correlate with
   tube depth. Our results illustrate that flower colors may have a certain
   potential to indicate tube depth, i.e. nectar accessibility, from a
   bee's perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is indispensable for the reproduction of native and
   agricultural plant species. Current data underline the fragility of
   pollinator populations, mainly bees, which are threatened by increasing
   habitat fragmentation and use of agrochemicals. In this scenario,
   traditional communities in rural areas represent an important source of
   information, acquired upon direct observation of the biology and the
   ecology of animal species in these regions. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the local environmental knowledge of students in elementary
   schools in rural areas about bees and pollination at two moments, before
   and after the use of specific educational activities. Initially 110
   students were interviewed and they mentioned a relatively low number of
   ethnospecies. After the educational activities, we noticed a marked
   increase in this number, besides the significant learning of important
   concepts. Rural school communities lack information about pollination
   and insect pollinators and the insects, pollinators or not, still
   constitute animals of negative reputation for people. We believe that a
   deeper knowledge of pollination and pollinators may improve sustainable
   activities in the region.}},

Title = {{Nectar replenishment maintains the neutral effects of nectar robbing on
   female reproductive success of Salvia przewalskii (Lamiaceae), a plant
   pollinated and robbed by bumble bees}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims It has been suggested that the dynamics of nectar
   replenishment could differ for flowers after being nectar robbed or
   visited legitimately, but further experimental work is needed to
   investigate this hypothesis. This study aimed to assess the role of
   nectar replenishment in mediating the effects of nectar robbing on
   pollinator behaviour and plant reproduction.
   Methods Plant-robber-pollinator interactions in an alpine plant, Salvia
   przewalskii, were studied. It is pollinated by long-tongued Bombus
   religiosus and short-tongued B. friseanus, but robbed by B. friseanus.
   Nectar production rates for flowers after they were either robbed or
   legitimately visited were compared, and three levels of nectar robbing
   were created to detect the effects of nectar robbing on pollinator
   behaviour and plant reproduction.
   Key Results Nectar replenishment did not differ between flowers that had
   been robbed or legitimately visited. Neither fruit set nor seed set was
   significantly affected by nectar robbing. In addition, nectar robbing
   did not significantly affect visitation rate, flowers visited within a
   plant per foraging bout, or flower handling time of the legitimate
   pollinators. However, a tendency for a decrease in relative abundance of
   the pollinator B. religiosus with an increase of nectar robbing was
   found.
   Conclusions Nectar robbing did not affect female reproductive success
   because nectar replenishment ensures that pollinators maintain their
   visiting activity to nectar-robbed flowers. Nectar replenishment might
   be a defence mechanism against nectar robbing to enhance reproductive
   fitness by maintaining attractiveness to pollinators. Further studies
   are needed to reveal the potential for interference competition among
   bumble bees foraging as robbers and legitimate visitors, and to
   investigate variation of nectar robbing in communities with different
   bumble bee species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Natural enemies and pollinators require nutritional and habitat
   resources that are often not found in conventional agricultural fields.
   The addition of flowering plants within agroecosystems may provide the
   resources necessary to support beneficial insects at the local scale. We
   hypothesized that insect pollinator and natural enemy abundance would
   increase in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) plots containing flower strips
   and that the effect would be greatest in the crop rows closest to the
   flower strips. Three flower treatments were tested: 1) buckwheat
   (Fagopyrum esculentum), 2) yellow mustard (Brassica hirta), 3) sweet
   alyssum (Lobularia maritima), and cucumbers as a control. Flowers were
   planted within a commercial cucumber field in 20-m-long strips in a
   randomized complete block design with six replications in the 2014 and
   2015 growing seasons. Some floral treatments successfully attracted more
   beneficial insects than others, but the beneficials did not disperse out
   to the cucumber plants. Cucumber yield was unaffected by flowers with
   one exception: in 2015, cucumber yield in the sweet alyssum plots were
   greater than those in plots with no flowers. Our research indicates that
   adding flowers to cucumber fields to increase services from beneficial
   insects needs to be further investigated to better understand the effect
   of factors such as relative flowering strip size.}},

Abstract = {{Nothocalais cuspidata (Pursh) Greene (Asteraceae) is a plant species of
   conservation concern in Missouri; it typically occurs as isolated
   populations in hill and sand prairies which are themselves rare and
   fragmented habitats. The present study was undertaken to understand its
   reproductive biology as a hill prairie member and the possibility of
   reduced reproductive output in this isolated habitat. Nothocalais
   cuspidata is an early spring-flowering, nonclonal, primarily
   self-incompatible perennial that exhibits a 4 wk flowering phenology
   with most florets open to cross-pollination over a 2-3 wk period. The
   attractive UV reflective florets were visited by six species of halictid
   and solitary bees. The study population did experience depressed
   reproductive output in 2014 compared to 2004, with open-pollinated
   florets producing 19.1\% fewer fruits than in 2004 along with a 37\%
   decline in population size over a 13 y period. We suggest the depressed
   fruit production experienced is likely due to the unpredictable spring
   weather associated with early flowering and sporadic pollinator
   visitation in an isolated habitat leading to large variations in
   reproductive success over time or a reduction in compatible mating types
   as the population declines.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most commonly seeded crops in Canada is canola, a cultivar of
   oilseed rape (Brassica napus). As a mass-flowering crop grown
   intensively throughout the Canadian Prairies, canola has the potential
   to influence pollinator success across tens of thousands of square
   kilometers of cropland. Bumble bees (Bombus sp.) are efficient
   pollinators of many types of native and crop plants. We measured the
   influence of this mass-flowering crop on the abundance and phenology of
   bumble bees, and on another species of social bee (a sweat bee; Halictus
   rubicundus), by continuously deploying traps at different levels of
   canola cultivation intensity, spanning the start and end of canola
   bloom. Queen bumble bees were more abundant in areas with more canola
   cover, indicating that this crop is attractive to queens. However,
   bumble bee workers were significantly fewer in these locations later in
   the season, suggesting reduced colony success. The median collection
   dates of workers of three bumble bee species were earlier near canola
   fields, suggesting a dynamic response of colonies to the increased
   floral resources. Different species experienced this shift to different
   extents. The sweat bee was not affected by canola cultivation intensity.
   Our findings suggest that mass-flowering crops such as canola are
   attractive to bumble bee queens and therefore may lead to higher rates
   of colony establishment, but also that colonies established near this
   crop may be less successful. We propose that the effect on bumble bees
   can be mitigated by spacing the crop more evenly with respect to
   alternate floral resources.}},

Abstract = {{Many pollinating insects acquire their entire nutrition from visiting
   flowers, and they must therefore be efficient both at detecting flowers
   and at recognizing familiar rewarding flower types. A crucial first step
   in recognition is the identification of edges and the segmentation of
   the visual field into areas that belong together. Honeybees and
   bumblebees acquire visual information through three types of
   photoreceptors; however, they only use a single receptor type-the one
   sensitive to longer wavelengths-for edge detection and movement
   detection. Here, we show that these long-wavelength receptors (peak
   sensitivity at similar to 544 nm, i.e., green) provide the most
   consistent signals in response to natural objects. Using our
   multispectral image database of flowering plants, we found that
   long-wavelength receptor responses had, depending on the specific
   scenario, up to four times higher signal-to-noise ratios than the short-
   and medium-wavelength receptors. The reliability of the long-wavelength
   receptors emerges from an intricate interaction between flower
   coloration and the bee's visual system. This finding highlights the
   adaptive significance of bees using only long-wavelength receptors to
   locate flowers among leaves, before using information provided by all
   three receptors to distinguish the rewarding flower species through
   trichromatic color vision.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the importance of bee conservation has grown in response
   to declines of managed honey bees and some wild bee species. Habitat
   loss has been implicated as a leading cause of declines, suggesting that
   ecological restoration is likely to play an increasing role in bee
   conservation efforts. In the midwestern United States, restoration of
   tallgrass prairie has traditionally targeted plant community objectives
   without explicit consideration for bees. However, restoration of prairie
   vegetation is likely to provide ancillary benefits to bees through
   increased foraging and nesting resources. We investigated community
   assembly of bees across a chronosequence of restored eastern tallgrass
   prairies and compared patterns to those in control and reference
   habitats (old fields and prairie remnants, respectively). We collected
   bees for 3 yr and measured diversity and abundance of in-bloom flowering
   plants, vegetation structure, ground cover, and surrounding land use as
   predictors of bee abundance and bee taxonomic and functional diversity.
   We found that site-level variables, but not site type or restoration
   age, were significant predictors of bee abundance (bloom diversity,
   P=0.004; bare ground cover, P=0.02) and bee diversity (bloom diversity,
   P=0.01). There were significant correlations between overall composition
   of bee and blooming plant communities (Mantel test, P=0.002), and both
   plant and bee assemblages in restorations were intermediate between
   those of old fields and remnant prairies. Restorations exhibited high
   bee beta diversity, i.e., restored sites' bee assemblages were
   taxonomically and functionally differentiated from each other. This
   pattern was strong in younger restorations (<20yr old), but absent from
   older restorations (>20yr), suggesting restored prairie bee communities
   become more similar to one another and more similar to remnant prairie
   bee communities over time with the arrival of more species and
   functional groups of bees. Our results indicate that old fields,
   restorations, and remnants provide habitat for diverse and abundant bee
   communities, but continued restoration of old fields will help support
   and conserve bee communities more similar to reference bee communities
   characteristic of remnant prairies.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic habitats, which are frequently occupied by otherwise
   endangered species of the open landscape, suffer from a lack of
   sustainability. Here, we analyzed one of the few sustainable
   anthropogenic habitats, roadside verges. We hypothesized that
   steppe-like habitats at upper parts of south-exposed slopes of roadside
   verges may serve as the only strongholds of threatened species ousted
   from the surrounding intensively cultivated landscape, with direct
   consequences for plant pollination and other ecosystem services. We
   examined bees and wasps alongside Highway 7 constructed 14-28 years ago
   in the northwestern Czech Republic. The sampling sites were located 4-17
   m from paved road with traffic intensity of 9523 to 38,688 vehicles x 24
   h(-1), and they consisted of steppe-like habitats with patches of bare
   soil (sand, loess and claystone) that formed and were maintained
   spontaneously. The sites were not connected to any permanent grasslands
   or forests, and they were surrounded mostly by arable fields. We found
   139 species of herbs (nine threatened) in vegetation surveys along
   transects. We identified 164 species of bees and wasps, with a dominance
   of 0.052 and a Fisher's alpha of 45.0; 32 species were threatened,
   including a second Czech record of Chrysis gribodoi spilota and four
   critically endangered species (Andrena florivaga, Halictus scabiosae,
   Sphecodes spinulosus and Nanoclavelia leucoptera). The captured
   specimens consisted of a higher number of loess specialists and other
   steppe species compared to specimens associated with other anthropogenic
   habitats that provide bare ground (sand pits and ash deposits). In
   conclusion, the formation of spontaneously maintained steppe-like
   habitats at roadside verges should be considered to be an appropriate
   tool supporting the biodiversity in the highly cultivated landscape of
   central Europe.}},

Title = {{A demographic approach to evaluating the impact of stressors on bumble

Abstract = {{1. Natural and anthropogenic stressors threaten the sustainability of
   bumble bees and evaluating their impact is essential to the stewardship
   of these valuable pollinators. Demographic modelling provides a
   framework for testing hypotheses about the impacts of stressors, but it
   has not previously been applied to bumble bees.
   2. I therefore formulated a demographic model for a bumble bee colony
   and then quantified the impact of two stressors, pesticide exposure and
   spider predation, by perturbing it with their known effects.
   3. By simulating a laboratory exposure of Bombus terrestris L. to
   dietary imidacloprid (a neonicotinoid insecticide), I tested whether the
   observed colony declinewas explained solely by a toxic effect on the
   fecundity of the foundress queen. By simulating field observations of B.
   terricola Kirby, I tested whether predation by crab spiders reduced
   colony fitness sufficiently to provide an adaptive explanation for
   avoidance behaviours seen when bumble bees encounter spiders.
   4. In B. terrestris, a dose-appropriate decrease in fecundity predicted
   the observed colony decline, which implicates this as a principal
   mechanism of toxicity. In B. terricola, doubling the rate of spider
   predation reduced a colony's production of new queens by 11\%, which
   implies that spider avoidance is highly adaptive.
   5. These analyses illustrate the utility of demographic modelling for
   quantifying the impacts of stressors on bumble bees. In the future,
   models of this type could be used to investigate a wider range of
   stressors and to produce thereby knowledge and tools useful for
   safeguarding bumble bees and the pollination services that they provide.}},

Abstract = {{Nectar mediates interactions between plants and pollinators in natural
   and agricultural systems. Specialized microorganisms are common nectar
   inhabitants, and potentially important mediators of plant-pollinator
   interactions. However, their diversity and role in mediating pollination
   services in agricultural systems are poorly characterized. Moreover,
   agrochemicals are commonly applied to minimize crop damage, but may
   present ecological consequences for non-target organisms. Assessment of
   ecological risk has tended to focus on beneficial macroorganisms such as
   pollinators, with less attention paid to microorganisms. Here, using
   culture-independent methods, we assess the impact of two widely-used
   fungicides on nectar microbial community structure in the mass-flowering
   crop almond (Prunus dulcis). We predicted that fungicide application
   would reduce fungal richness and diversity, whereas competing bacterial
   richness would increase, benefitting from negative effects on fungi. We
   found that fungicides reduced fungal richness and diversity in exposed
   flowers, but did not significantly affect bacterial richness, diversity,
   or community composition. The relative abundance of Metschnikowia OTUs,
   nectar specialists that can impact pollination, was reduced by both
   fungicides. Given growing recognition of theimportance of nectar
   microorganisms as mediators of plant-pollinator mutualisms, future
   research should consider the impact of management practiceson
   plant-associated microorganisms and consequences for pollination
   services in agricultural landscapes.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Pollinator-driven selection is thought to drive much of the
   extraordinary diversity of flowering plants. Plants that produce floral
   traits preferred by particular pollinators are more likely to receive
   conspecific pollen and to evolve further adaptations to those
   pollinators that enhance pollination and ultimately generate floral
   diversity. Two mechanisms in particular, sensory bias and learning, are
   thought to explain how pollinator preference can contribute to
   divergence and speciation in flowering plants. While the preferences of
   pollinators, such as bees, flies, and birds, are frequently implicated
   in patterns of floral trait evolution, the role of learning in
   generating reproductive isolation and trait divergence for different
   floral types within plant populations is not well understood. Floral
   color polymorphism in particular provides an excellent opportunity to
   examine how pollinator behavior and learning might maintain the
   different floral morphs. In this study we asked if bumble bees showed
   innate preferences for different color morphs of the pollen-only plant
   Solanum tridynamum, whether bees formed preferences for the morphs with
   which they had experience collecting pollen from, and the strength of
   those learned preferences. Using an absolute conditioning protocol, we
   gave bees experience collecting pollen from a color polymorphic plant
   species that offered only pollen rewards. Despite initially-na < ve bees
   showing no apparent innate bias toward human-white versus human-purple
   flower morphs, we did find evidence of a bias in learning. Specifically,
   bees learned strong preferences for purple corollas, but learned only
   weak preferences for hypochromic (human-white) corollas. We discuss how
   our results might explain patterns of floral display evolution,
   particularly as they relate to color polymorphisms. Additionally, we
   propose that the ease with which floral visual traits are learned-i.e.,
   biases in learning-can influence the evolution of floral color as a
   signal to pollinators.}},

Title = {{Herbivory-induced changes in the olfactory and visual display of flowers
   and extrafloral nectaries affect pollinator behavior}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2, SI}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Plants communicate with animals by means of multimodal displays and
   reward mutualistic partners with resources such as nectar. Floral nectar
   is a key resource for pollinators, whereas extrafloral nectaries (EFNs)
   support indirect plant defense. Animal-pollinated flowers advertise
   their rewards using modalities such as scent, color and morphology. In
   EFNs the role of olfactory and visual traits is less well understood.
   Herbivory has been shown to induce changes in the multimodal display and
   in resource related characteristics of flowers and EFNs. This may
   consequently affect the behavior of nectar consumers such as pollinators
   that occasionally feed on extrafloral nectar in addition to floral
   nectar. We tested the effect of herbivory (simulated by jasmonic acid
   treatment) on olfactory, visual and resource related floral and EFN
   traits in Vicia faba, tracked alterations in bumblebee (Bombus
   terrestris) preference and evaluated potential outcomes for plant
   reproduction. In control plants, flowers and EFNs differed in olfactory
   and visual cues and also in nectar quantity and quality and pollinators
   clearly preferred to forage on flowers. After jasmonic acid treatment
   (JA), linalool emissions of EFNs increased in a large proportion of
   plants, the visual display of EFNs became more salient and nectar
   volumes increased. In flowers of JA-treated plants we found lower
   emissions of cinnamic aldehyde and lower sugar concentration in nectar,
   however visual cues were unaffected. Potentially because of these
   phenotypic changes bumblebees no longer preferred flowers over EFNs in
   JA-treated plants. Consequently, this may negatively affect reproductive
   success in V. faba, which is highly dependent on floral visitation for
   fruit set. Our study adds another aspect to the complexity of
   plant-pollinator interactions and reveals how herbivory may interfere
   with plant-pollinator communication. Our findings emphasize that the
   foraging behavior of pollinators not only depends on floral traits, but
   is affected by the whole plants' multimodal phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{1. Pollination is a major ecosystem service in which insects,
   particularly bees, play an important role for the reproduction of most
   angiosperms. Currently, this service is considered under threat due to
   reported bee declines. Moderately urbanised areas could be important for
   pollinators and pollination; however, compared to agricultural and
   natural systems, they are poorly studied. 2. Here, we investigated the
   relative effects of local habitat quality and anthropogenic land use
   across an agricultural to urban gradient for local plant and flying
   insect communities. We quantified local flower visitor networks and
   related network architecture to these local and landscape factors using
   structural equationmodelling. Flower visitor network architecture is
   often assumed to act as a surrogate for the ecosystem service of
   pollination. To test this idea, we related network metrics to
   pollination of four experimental, insect pollinator-dependent plant
   species. 3. Overall, local land use markedly influenced plant and flying
   insect communities. Flower richness and bee richness were higher in
   urban compared to agricultural areas. Flower visitor network metrics
   (e.g. linkage density) increased with the proportion of urban area
   surrounding a site. Also, relative to agricultural areas, urban flower
   visitors were more generalised and foraged from a higher number of plant
   species, likely a consequence of higher urban flowering plant richness.
   However, urban bees also visited a lower proportion of the available
   flowering plants (higher specialisation). Surprisingly, linkage density,
   network specialisation and flower visitor generality were not related to
   pollination of our four experimental plants per se. Rather, it was the
   proportion of urban cover, flying insect abundance and bee richness that
   were positively related to pollination. 4. Our findings show strong
   effects of local land use on plant and flying insect communities and
   flower visitor interaction networks. We observed increased overall
   visitation rates and pollination services to our experimental plants in

Abstract = {{1. Field-margin diversification through conservation and restoration of
   hedgerows is becoming a prominent intervention for promoting
   biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in intensive agricultural
   landscapes. However, how increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape
   can affect ecosystem services has rarely been considered.
   2. Here, we assessed the effect of increased field-margin complexity at
   the local scale and increasing cover of hedgerows in the landscape on
   the provision of pest control, weed control and potential pollination.
   Locally, three types of field margin were compared as follows: (i)
   standard grass margin, (ii) simple hedgerow and (iii) complex hedgerow,
   along two independent gradients of hedgerow cover and arable land cover
   in the landscape. We performed an exclusion experiment to measure
   biological control of cereal aphids and assessed natural enemy and pest
   abundance in the field. We sampled plant weed communities and performed
   a phytometer experiment to test the effects of pollinators on plant
   reproductive success.
   3. At the local scale, planting a new hedgerow or improving its
   structural complexity and vegetation diversity did not enhance the
   delivery of ecosystem services in the neighbouring field.
   4. However, high cover of hedgerows in the landscape enhanced aphid
   parasitism (from 12 to 18\%) and potential pollination (visitation rate
   and seed set increased up to 70\%) irrespective of local margin quality.
   The cover of arable land in the landscape reduced the abundance of
   plant-dwelling predators and weed diversity, but did not affect the
   delivery of the investigated ecosystem services.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the key importance
   of the surrounding landscape context, rather than local factors, to the
   delivery of ecosystem services. This suggests a need for new policies
   that pay particular attention to the conservation of hedgerows at large
   scales for promoting multiple ecosystem services in agroecosystems.
   Specifically, hedgerows can serve to develop a network of ecological
   corridors that can facilitate the movement of beneficial organisms, such
   as pollinators and natural enemies in the agricultural matrix. Such
   interventions may be a `low cost-high benefit solution', since farmers
   can create or conserve high-quality habitats taking little or no land
   from crop production and without the need to change their crop
   management.}},

Abstract = {{A significant portion of world food supply depends on the action of
   pollinators, which for most crops are primarily domesticated and ``
   wild{''} bees. Over 75\% of pollinator value in the USA accrues through
   the actions of domesticated honey bees. However, the number of
   commercial honey bee colonies in the USA has been declining for seven
   decades due to parasitic arthropods, diseases, and various stresses. The
   recognition that honey bees, and the crops they service, are vulnerable
   has accelerated the search for alternative species of bees for
   pollination of selected crops. Foremost among potential alternatives are
   native solitary species such as Osmia lignaria propinqua, the ``Blue
   Orchard Bee{''} (BOB), whose use as a pollinator of almonds, cherries,
   and apples is increasing. The BOB occurs on public lands managed by the
   USDA Forest Service, and the USDI Bureau of Land Management and National
   Park Service. BOBs are targets of `` trappers{''} who place mostly
   unauthorized ``trap- nests{''} of various designs on public lands.
   Several problems result from this ``Tragedy of the Commons{''}
   situation: (1) the unsupervised removal of target bee species from their
   role in maintaining healthy ecosystems as pollinators of native plants;
   (2) the removal, as bycatch, of many nontarget species of bees and wasps
   that also employ trap-nests to rear their progeny; and (3) the shipping
   of these bees into areas where they do not occur naturally. We argue
   that unauthorized trap-nesting on public lands should be prohibited and
   offer several proposals to legalize commercial trap-nesting at a reduced
   level.}},

Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{There are two alternative hypotheses related to body size and
   competition for restricted food sources. The first one supposes that
   larger animals are superior competitors because of their increased
   feeding abilities, whereas the second one assumes superiority of smaller
   animals because of their lower food requirements. We examined the
   relationship between two unrelated species of different size, drinking
   technique, energy requirements and roles in plant pollination system, to
   reveal the features of their competitive interaction and mechanisms
   enabling their co-existence while utilising the same nectar source. We
   observed diurnal feeding behaviour of the main pollinator, the carpenter
   bee Xylocopa caffra and a nectar thief, the northern double-collared
   sunbird Cinnyris reichenowi on 19 clumps of Hypoestes aristata
   (Acanthaceae) in Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. For comparative purpose,
   we established a simplistic model of daily energy expenditure and daily
   energy intake by both visitor species assuming that they spend all
   available daytime feeding on H. aristata. We revealed the energetic
   gain-expenditure balance of the studied visitor species in relation to
   diurnal changes in nectar quality and quantity. In general, smaller
   energy requirements and related ability to utilise smaller resources
   made the main pollinator X. caffra competitively superior to the larger
   nectar thief C. reichenowi. Nevertheless, sunbirds are endowed with
   several mechanisms to reduce asymmetry in exploitative competition, such
   as the use of nectar resources in times of the day when rivals are
   inactive, aggressive attacks on carpenter bees while defending the
   nectar plants, and higher speed of nectar consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Elaiophores seems to be uncommon in Orchidaceae; however, the number of
   known species with floral oil glands has increased in recent years,
   principally in Oncidiinae. Oil rewards are used by bees of the tribes
   Centridini, Tapinotaspidini and Tetrapediini. Our aims were to identify
   the presence of elaiophores and to describe their structure in species
   of Gomesa, Grandiphyllum and Trichocentrum, and to compare our results
   with other studies of elaiophores in Oncidiinae. We selected a set of
   characters presumably associated with oil production in flowers of
   Oncidiinae, which were evaluated using a cluster analysis to identify
   different floral morphologies of the oil flowers. The correlation
   between morphological types of oil flowers and species of pollinators
   was examined. The cluster analysis distinguished two groups of species,
   one of them principally linked with pollination by bees of genus Centris
   and the other type associated to species of Paratetrapedia and
   Tetrapedia. The evaluation of these results into a phylogenetic
   framework of the Oncidiinae, adding more evidence that species of this
   subtribe with similar floral morphology associated with floral oil
   secretion arise in many independent clades, in parallel evolution with
   the oil-bee pollination.}},

Abstract = {{Morphological variation was studied in 124 accessions from 61 Passiflora
   L. species. Twenty-four quantitative descriptors selected for their high
   variation among subgenera were submitted to a principal component
   analysis. The first principal component (32\% of total variance) was
   associated with flower length and secondarily with floral cup
   constriction, the second (27\%) with flower width and bract shape, and
   the third (14\%) with peduncle branching, stem width, and leaf length,
   which relates it to the differentiation of subgenera Astrophea and
   Deidamioides. The projection of accessions in the resulting
   tridimensional space consistently separates the four subgenera, as well
   as supersection Tacsonia of subgenus Passiflora. A neighbor joining
   analysis, on a selection of 32 qualitative traits and four categorized
   quantitative variables, clustered species according to their chromosome
   number and, within subgenus Passiflora, separated supersections Tacsonia
   (pollinated by the sword-billed hummingbird) and Distephana (pollinated
   by shorter-billed hummingbirds) from all other, bee-pollinated, species.
   Thus, the morphological study allows separating the effects of genome
   evolution from those of more recent and independent coevolutions
   concerning the pollination syndromes of supersections Tacsonia and
   Distephana. Within subgenus Decaloba, diverging subclusters are
   consistent with supersections and particular sections, with the partial
   exception of supersection Decaloba. Within supersection Tacsonia,
   subclusters correspond to one or two sections, pointing to
   overclassification in the current taxonomy. Among the bee-pollinated
   species of subgenus Passiflora, only supersection Laurifolia is clearly
   validated. Most of these results are consistent with molecular
   phylogenetic studies, except for interspecific relations among
   bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, which appear particularly
   difficult to classify.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen morphology of nine species belonging to six genera of tribe
   Hemimerideae (representing the basalmost clade of Scrophulariaceae
   s.str.) was studied and illustrated with light microscopy (LM) and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pollen grains in Hemimerideae are 3-
   or 6-8-colpate or 3- or 5-8-colporate, prolate, spheroidal or
   oblate-spheroidal in shape; they are mainly medium-sized or occasionally
   small. The outline in polar view is 3-lobed, rounded-3-lobed or
   5-8-lobed; the outline in equatorial view is elliptic or orbicular.
   Exine sculpture is rough, rough-foveolate, foveolate, microreticulate,
   rugulate, rugulate-foveolate or rugulate-microreticulate. Four major
   pollen types are recognized, based on original data: 3-colpate
   (Alonsoa), 6-8-colpate (Diclis, Hemimeris), 3-colporate (Colpias) and
   5-8-colporate (Diascia, Nemesia). Within two of these pollen types, two
   subtypes can be further distinguished based on pollen size, exine
   sculpture, details of the colpi and endoapertures. Based on pollen
   morphological data presented here and in our previous studies combined
   with published molecular phylogenetic data and molecular clock
   estimates, we conclude that (1) the ancestral pollen type in
   Scrophulariaceae was 3-colporate with a rather ``primitive{''} exine
   sculpture; (2) major trends and pathways of further morphological
   evolution of pollen among the all lineages of Scrophulariaceae were
   established at the early stages of diversification of the family, about
   the time of divergence of its main lineages; and (3) the signatures of
   parallel evolution of the main morphological pollen characters, combined
   with progressive diversification of exine sculpture patterns, are
   apparent in all major lineages of the family.}},

Abstract = {{Stevia rebaudiana (Bert.) Bertoni has sporophytic self-incompatibility
   and this may lead to poor seed yield and quality, which are obstacles to
   large-scale crop establishment. This research investigated the influence
   of insect pollinators and the harvesting time on the qualitative and
   quantitative characteristics of the ripe seeds. A pot trial under open
   field conditions was established to evaluate the abundance of insect
   pollinators and three harvesting times on the production of ripe seeds,
   germination percentage, mean germination time and thousand seed weight
   (TSW) in 36 F1 open-pollinated genotypes. Large variability in the
   number of corymbs of capitula, flowering time, reproductive period and
   seed yield was observed among the genotypes. Genotypes with promising
   phenological and reproductive properties were identified. The worst
   germination percentage and TSW were recorded in the latest harvest.
   Significant linear regressions were found among the investigated
   parameters (insect number, germination percentage, TSW, seeds yield per
   plant and cycle length), confirming complex interactions on the yield
   and quality of stevia seeds. Results indicate that earlier flowering
   genotypes produced higher seed quantity, due to favourable weather
   conditions during the reproductive phase. Moreover, cross-pollination
   and the insect abundance, as Apidae and Syrphidae, play a crucial role
   for enhancing the stevia seed yield and quality.}},

Volume = {{208}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{40-47}},

Abstract = {{The benefits of citizen science to conservation, science, and
   socio-ecological systems as well as to participants themselves are
   increasingly recognized and valued, yet what motivates volunteers
   remains little studied and poorly understood. To better understand
   citizen scientists' motivations and how they benefit from their
   participation, we surveyed volunteers in the Great Pollinator Project, a
   conservation-related project in New York City. We conducted pre- and
   post-season surveys and focus group sessions to find out who the active
   volunteers were, their reasons for joining, what benefits of
   participation they experienced, as well as challenges they encountered
   collecting and submitting data. In comparison with results of several
   surveys of environmental and conservation volunteers, we found a similar
   range of motivators. However, while studies of motivations of
   environmental volunteers have indicated helping the environment as the
   strongest factor, interest in learning about bees the subject of the
   study was the top motivation of our citizen science volunteers. Helping
   or contributing to science was the second most cited motivator for
   participants in the project. Less strong were outdoor/recreation and
   social factors. We discuss some of the steps we took in response to
   participants' feedback in order to improve volunteer recruitment and
   retention. We also make additional recommendations for project design
   and research to enhance understanding of volunteer motivations, which
   will benefit volunteers themselves as well as strengthen their
   contribution to conservation outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The unique benefits of wild pollinators to the productivity of
   agricultural crops have become increasingly recognized in recent
   decades. However, declines in populations of wild pollinator species,
   largely driven by the conversion of natural habitat to agricultural land
   and broad-spectrum pesticide use often lead reductions in the provision
   of pollination services and crop production. With growing evidence that
   targeted pollinator conservation improves crop yield and/or quality,
   particularly for pollination specialist crops, efforts are increasing to
   substitute agriculturally intensive practices with those that alleviate
   some of the negative impacts of agriculture on pollinators and the
   pollination services they provide, in part through the provision of
   suitable pollinator habitat. Further, similarities between the responses
   of some pollinators and predators to habitat management suggest that
   efforts to conserve pollinators may also encourage predator densities.
   We evaluated the effects of one habitat management practice, the
   addition of cacao fruit husks to a monoculture cacao farm, on the
   provision of pollination services and the densities of two groups of
   entomophagous predators. We also evaluated the impacts of cacao fruit
   husk addition on pollen limitation, by crossing this habitat
   manipulation with pollen supplementation treatments. The addition of
   cacao fruit husks increased the number of fruits per tree and along with
   hand pollination treatments, increased final yields indicating a
   promotion of the pollination ecosystem service provided by the
   specialist pollinators, midges. We also found that cacao fruit husk
   addition increased the densities of two predator groups, spiders and
   skinks. Further, the conservation of these predators did not inhibit
   pollination through pollinator capture or deterrence. The findings show
   that, with moderate habitat management, both pollinator and predator
   conservation can be compatible goals within a highly specialized
   plant-pollinator system. The effectiveness of this habitat manipulation
   may be attributable to the increased availability of alternative habitat
   and food resources for both pollinators and predators. The results
   exemplify a win-win relationship between agricultural production and
   biological conservation, whereby agricultural practices to support vital
   pollinators and pollination services can increase production as well as
   support species conservation.}},

Title = {{Does the morphological fit between flowers and pollinators affect pollen
   deposition? An experimental test in a buzz-pollinated species with

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2706-2715}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Some pollination systems, such as buzz-pollination, are associated with
   floral morphologies that require a close physical interaction between
   floral sexual organs and insect visitors. In these systems, a
   pollinator's size relative to the flower may be an important feature
   determining whether the visitor touches both male and female sexual
   organs and thus transfers pollen between plants efficiently. To date,
   few studies have addressed whether in fact the fit between flower and
   pollinator influences pollen transfer, particularly among
   buzz-pollinated species. Here we use Solanum rostratum, a
   buzz-pollinated plant with dimorphic anthers and mirror-image flowers,
   to investigate whether the morphological fit between the pollinator's
   body and floral morphology influences pollen deposition. We hypothesized
   that when the size of the pollinator matches the separation between the
   sexual organs in a flower, more pollen should be transferred to the
   stigma than when the visitor is either too small or too big relative to
   the flower. To test this hypothesis, we exposed flowers of S.rostratum
   with varying levels of separation between sexual organs, to bumblebees
   (Bombus terrestris) of different sizes. We recorded the number of visits
   received, pollen deposition, and fruit and seed production. We found
   higher pollen deposition when bees were the same size or bigger than the
   separation between anther and stigma within a flower. We found a
   similar, but not statistically significant pattern for fruit set. In
   contrast, seed set was more likely to occur when the size of the flower
   exceeded the size of the bee, suggesting that other postpollination
   processes may be important in translating pollen receipt to seed set.
   Our results suggest that the fit between flower and pollinator
   significantly influences pollen deposition in this buzz-pollinated
   species. We speculate that in buzz-pollinated species where floral
   morphology and pollinators interact closely, variation in the visitor's
   size may determine whether it acts mainly as a pollinator or as a pollen
   thief (i.e., removing pollen rewards but contributing little to pollen
   deposition and fertilization).}},

Abstract = {{Linear areas of contrasting floral colour, or ``nectar guides{''}, are
   recognized to enhance pollinator attraction. Few studies, however, have
   investigated the role of other types of floral marking in pollinator
   behaviour. In this study, we explore the impact of petal spots and petal
   rings on bumblebee foraging dynamics. Using model flowers with discrete
   spot or bullseye ring patterns we investigate the responses of Bombus
   terrestris foragers towards rewarding and unrewarding flowers. We find
   that the presence of petal spots and rings reduce the search time of
   pollinators to locate rewarding model flowers. Only the rewarding petal
   ring phenotype, however, is readily learned and significantly increases
   the foraging efficiency of experienced bees over four foraging bouts.
   Although the rewarding spot phenotype induces random foraging over this
   time frame, employing differential conditioning with a strong aversive
   stimulus over ten foraging bouts reveal that bees have the capacity to
   correctly identify rewarding spot phenotypes with more training. Once a
   strong association between petal marking and reward is formed, bees
   continue to respond to marked phenotypes even when unrewarding,
   suggesting rewardless plants that exhibit petal marking could
   potentially exploit their pollinators. We conclude that petal marking,
   whether organised discretely in a spot or in a continuous ring around
   the centre of a flower, have a significant and complex influence on
   pollinator foraging dynamics.}},

   because they increase detectability. However, direct evidence that
   conspicuous flower and fruit colors affect the fitness of plants in
   natural populations is scarce. Here, we test the prediction that
   conspicuous signals affect pollination and dispersal success in two
   plant species. We show that the prediction only holds true for flowers
   of one species, and propose that the widely accepted selection for
   conspicuousness may be oversimplifying. Moreover, the multiple functions
   of pigments in the protection against abiotic stressors could interfere
   with their signaling role to pollinating and seed-dispersing animals.
   Indeed, we find flower and leaf colors as well as fruit and leaf colors
   to be coupled, likely due to the involvement of pigments of flowers and
   epicuticular waxes of fruits in abiotic stress responses. Lastly,
   because plant reproduction is a multi-stage process in which the
   different steps may be uncoupled, we investigated whether differential
   fitness through selection of pollinators on flower conspicuousness in
   the pollination step is transmitted to the dispersal step to affect
   dispersal success. We show that this is partially true, with pollination
   success affecting the absolute, but not the proportional, dispersal
   success, and we highlight the importance of holistic approaches to plant
   signals in reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction in many angiosperms depends on attracting animals that
   provide pollination and seed dispersal services. Flowers and fleshy
   fruits present various features that can attract animal mutualists
   through visual, olfactory, acoustic, and tactile cues and signals, and
   some of these traits may result from selection exerted by pollinators
   and seed dispersers. Plant attractants can provide information regarding
   the presence, location, and quality of the reward. However, because of
   the different functional outcomes of pollination and seed dispersal,
   pollination systems are thought to be more highly specialized than seed
   dispersal systems. Despite these interesting parallels and contrasts,
   theoretical and empirical insights in the sensory ecology of pollination
   and seed dispersal are rarely considered together. Here, we review
   extant theory and data of sensory attractants from both pollination and
   seed dispersal systems. We discuss theoretical and empirical
   similarities and differences between pollination and seed dispersal and
   offer suggestions for ways in which insights from each field may benefit
   the other in future.}},

Abstract = {{Through their preferences for floral cues, pollinators and herbivores
   can mediate selection on a variety of plant traits. Selection by
   mutualists and antagonists may not be independent from each other,
   however, as the selection on a trait through one interaction can depend
   on the presence or intensity of another interaction. Bumble bees (Bombus
   terrestris) and cabbage butterflies (Pieris brassicae) are both
   pollinators of Brassica rapa, but cabbage butterflies also use B. rapa
   as a host plant for their caterpillars. In a cage experiment we exposed
   B. rapa plants to (a) bumble bees, (b) cabbage butterflies, and (c)
   bumble bees and cabbage butterflies together and analysed the resulting
   patterns of selection. We found an association between flower visitation
   and corolla size as well as the scent compound phenylacetaldehyde for
   both bumble bees and cabbage butterflies. Additionally, oviposition by
   butterflies was associated with the same two floral signals. Whereas
   corolla size was under positive selection in all three pollinator
   treatments, selection on phenylacetaldehyde was found only in the
   ``pure{''} bumble bee treatment. Additionally, in plants exposed to both
   insect species negative correlational selection on corolla size and
   phenylacetaldehyde was found, as well as nonadditive selection on
   phenylacetaldehyde. These results demonstrate a strong overlap in the
   preferences for floral traits in pollinators and herbivores causing a
   conflict between the attraction of mutualists and the avoidance of
   antagonists. Further, our study shows that interactive effects on
   fitness by mutualists and antagonists can contribute to complex
   selection patterns.}},

Title = {{Honest signals to maintain a long-lasting relationship: floral colour
   change prevents plant-level avoidance by experienced pollinators}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{831-837}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Honest signals prevail when those signals manipulate receivers to
   benefit the senders more than deceptive signals do. Floral colour change
   (FCC), reported in hundreds of species, is a well-known example of
   honest signalling in plant-pollinator interactions. It occurs in fully
   turgid flowers, and usually correlates with a cessation of reward
   production in individual flowers. This trait has been considered a plant
   strategy that enhances distant pollinator attraction by extended
   displays, while minimizing visits to non-reproductive flowers by honest
   colour signals. 2. Here, we propose an additional, overlooked benefit of
   FCC, which emerges when we consider the spatial learning ability of
   pollinators to avoid unprofitable plants. If a plant retains rewardless
   flowers without FCC, it is difficult for pollinators to visually locate
   the rewarding flowers. Although the enhanced display initially attracts
   more pollinators, its low profitability for foraging may cause
   plant-level avoidance by them. The avoidance resulting from rewardless
   flower retention may be prevented by FCC because it helps pollinators to
   find rewarding flowers. To test this hypothesis, we observed the
   behavioural changes of bumblebees foraging in an array of artificial
   plants. 3. We found that rewardless flowers without FCC could initially
   attract bees by increasing the plant's display size, but their lack of
   reward resulted in plant-level avoidance by those bees with spatial
   memories. The FCC in rewardless flowers, in contrast, encouraged bees to
   return by helping them to find rewards on plants. Consequently, honest
   plants with FCC received more visits than those dishonest plants that
   did not display colour change. 4. Floral colour change thus can prevent
   plant-level avoidance by pollinators that use spatial memory when
   choosing plants. The spatial learning ability of pollinators may,
   therefore, be one of the keys to understanding why both colour-changing
   and non-colour-changing plant species occur among angiosperms.}},

Title = {{Semi-natural habitats mitigate the effects of temperature rise on wild
   bees}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. The effect of climate change on wild bee communities is of major
   concern since the decline of bee species could imperil the provision of
   pollination services. Additionally, habitat loss and fragmentation are
   major threats to wild bee populations, but improvements to the landscape
   structure could also improve the general conditions for wild bees.
   However, potential interactive effects of climate change and landscape
   structure on wild bee communities remain unknown.
   2. In this study, we assessed the potential of semi-natural areas to
   maintain robust communities under changing weather conditions. We used
   bee monitoring data from six 4 x 4 km field sites across Germany. Almost
   30 000 bee specimens were collected from 2010 to 2012 in 16 local
   communities per site at six sampling occasions per year. Following a
   multimodel inference approach, we identified the most important weather
   and landscape variables as well as interaction terms that affect wild
   bee species richness and total abundance.
   3. Correcting for overall phenology, we found a strong negative
   relationship between bee species richness and temperature, indicating
   that future increasing temperatures will lead to a decrease in species
   richness. However, a high proportion of semi-natural habitats can
   considerably decrease the detrimental effect of warmer temperatures on
   bee species richness and abundance.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Semi-natural areas and green
   infrastructure elements within agricultural landscapes become even more
   important under changing temperature conditions to mitigate the negative
   effects of increasing temperatures on wild bee species richness and
   total abundance. This has important implications for conservation
   decision making, suggesting that maintaining or restoring a fair amount
   of semi-natural areas could serve as a countermeasure against climate
   change for wild bees.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinator-dependent agriculture heavily relies upon a single
   pollinator-the honey bee. To diversify pollination strategies, growers
   are turning to alternatives. Densely planted reservoirs of pollen-and
   nectar-rich flowers (pollination reservoirs, hereafter ``PRs{''}) may
   improve pollination services provided by wild bees. Our focal
   agroecosystem, lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), exists
   in a simple landscape uniquely positioned to benefit from PRs. First, we
   contrast bee visitation rates and use of three types of PR. We consider
   the effects of PRs on wild bee diversity and the composition of bumble
   bee pollen loads. We contrast field-level crop pollination services
   between PRs and controls four years postestablishment. Last, we
   calculate the time to pay for PR investment. Social bees preferentially
   used clover plantings; solitary bees preferentially used wild-flower
   plantings. On average, bumble bee pollen loads in treatment fields
   contained 37\% PR pollen. PRs significantly increased visitation rates
   to the crop in year 4, and exerted a marginally significant positive
   influence on fruit set. The annualized costs of PRs were covered by the
   fourth year using the measured increase in pollination services. Our
   findings provide evidence of the positive impact of PRs on crop
   pollination services.
   Agricultura que depende de los polinizadores depende fuertemente de una
   especie-la abeja melifera. Para diversificar las estrategias de la
   polinizacion, los productores buscan alternativas. Una reserva de flores
   muy densa con una gran cantidad de polen y nectar (una reserva de
   polinizacion, en lo sucesivo la `PR') puede que mejore los servicios de
   polinizacion por parte de las abejas silvestres. El agroecosistema
   focal, el arandano bajo, (Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton), crece en un
   campo sencillo que se beneficiaria de las PRs. En primer lugar,
   contrastamos la tasa de visita de las abejas a lo largo de tres clases
   de PR. Tenemos en cuenta los efectos de las PRs sobre la diversidad de
   las abejas silvestres y la composicion de la carga de polen de los
   abejorros. Cuatro anos despues de establecimiento, contrastamos los
   servicios de polinizacion al nivel del campo entre las PRs y los grupos
   de control. Finalmente, calculamos el tiempo para realizar ganancias.
   Las abejas sociales prefirieron los cultivos del trebol; las abejas
   solitarias prefirieron los cultivos de flores silvestres. En promedio,
   en los campos de tratamiento, las cargas de polen de los abejorros
   contuvo 37\% de polen de la PR. Las PRs aumentaron significativamente
   las tasas de visita al cultivo en el ano 4, y ejercieron una influencia
   positiva y marginalmente significativa sobre el cuajado del fruto.
   Utilizando el aumento medido en los servicios de polinizacion, los
   costos anualizados de las PRs habian sido cubierto del ano 4. Nuestros
   hallazgos implican que hay un efecto positivo de las PRs sobre los
   servicios de polinizacion.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change can threaten the reproductive success of plants, both
   directly, through physiological damage during increasingly extreme
   weather events, and indirectly, through disruption of plant-pollinator
   interactions. To explore how plant-pollinator interactions are modified
   by extreme weather, we exposed faba bean (Vicia faba) plants to elevated
   temperature for 5 d during flowering, simulating a heatwave. We then
   moved the plants to flight cages with either bumblebees or no
   pollinators, or to two field sites, where plants were enclosed in mesh
   bags or pollinated by wild insect communities. We used a morphological
   marker to quantify pollen movement between experimental plants. There
   was a substantial increase in the level of outcrossing by insect
   pollinators following heat stress. Proportion outcrossed seed increased
   from 17 \% at control temperature, to 33 \% following heat stress in the
   flight cages, and from 31 \% to 80 \% at one field site, but not at the
   other (33 \% to 32 \%). Abiotic stress can dramatically shift the
   relative contributions of cross-and self-pollination to reproduction in
   an insect pollinated plant. The resulting increases in gene flow have
   broad implications for genetic diversity and functioning of ecosystems,
   and may increase resilience by accelerating the selection of more
   stress-tolerant genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change is threatening species and habitats. Altitudinal shifts
   uphill and negative population trends are commonly observed in
   altitude-related taxa. The bumblebee Bombus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758) has
   a disjoint distribution restricted to Fennoscandia and the Alps, and is
   considered threatened. We studied the ecology and distribution of B.
   alpinus in the Alps, where the endemic subspecies Bombus alpinus helleri
   Dalla Torre 1882 is found, as a case-model because of its rarity,
   habitat, and mutual dependence with the ecosystem for pollination and
   resources. We developed species distribution models including both
   climatic and habitat variables to obtain the surface suitable for this
   subspecies and quantified its protected portion. Our analyses indicate
   that this bumblebee is restricted to the upper altitudes and has a
   narrow niche mainly related to the presence of glaciers, the cool
   temperature, a low temperature variation, and a specific range of
   precipitation. A strong altitudinal shift is also taking place probably
   due to climate change. After years of no changes in altitudinal
   distribution, its lowest altitudinal limit has moved up 479 m since the
   year 1984, while its upper altitudinal limit has remained unchanged.
   Over half of the suitable area in the Alps is included within protected
   areas, but conservation has not been planned yet. However, rare species
   with narrow niche, such as B. alpinus, are highly threatened by climate
   change. Potential short-term mitigation actions are discussed, including
   exchange of males between locations and integral protection of prairies
   in the vicinity of glaciers.}},

   the need to evaluate the current status of these populations and
   understand their needs for sustainability. Farming systems can be a
   useful place to examine the presence and activity of flower-visiting

   floral resource which serves as an attractant to some species. The
   density and species richness of cotton flower-visiting insects were
   measured in five conservation and five conventional cotton fields in
   Mwachisompola, Zambia. Between the two farm types, density and species
   richness were not significantly different; however, only 33\% of the
   total observed species were found within both farm systems. We found a
   significant negative relationship between species richness and field
   size regardless of farm type. Our results suggest that cotton fields
   attract both pollinator and predatory flower-visiting insects regardless
   of management, however more work is needed to better understand the
   effects of field size and surrounding natural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Andrena are one of the most important wild bee pollinators in lowbush
   blueberry, and crop management decisions may impact their density in the
   crop field. Prune method (burning versus mowing) and crop cycle may
   influence Andrena abundance and nesting decisions, and influence
   pollination services to this pollinator dependent crop. We measured
   spring soil temperatures and counted mining bee tumuli in lowbush
   blueberry fields over two years. In the second year, wemeasured the
   influence of lowbush blueberry stem density on soil temperature. We
   recorded Andrena visitation to nearby crop fields to see if tumuli
   density corresponded with Andrena visitation rates. Burned fields
   supported higher densities of tumuli, especially in 2015. Fields managed
   on a split cycle supported higher densities of tumuli than non-split
   fields. Soil surface temperatures were higher in burned fields in 2015,
   but not in 2016. Stem density exerted a greater effect on temperature
   than pruning method in 2016, and may moderate subsoil temperature.
   Tumuli densities were not a predictor of Andrena flower visitor
   abundance. Based upon known richness and relative abundance of the
   Andrena assemblage associated with the crop, we deduced the most likely
   species of tumuli occupants. The implications of these findings are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the value of domestic gardens for
   supporting biodiversity. While it is well established that bumblebees
   exploit urban green spaces, this is the first study to explore the land
   use and floral preferences of the UK's seven most common bumblebees in
   gardens and allotments cultivated for food. A citizen science survey was
   carried out at 38 sites, between 1st June and 30th September 2013. At
   the landscape scale, bumblebee abundance and species richness was not
   significantly correlated with surrounding land use characteristics (both
   p > 0.05). Bombus pratorum was the only species to show correlations
   with surrounding land use, demonstrating a positive relationship with
   built areas and gardens and allotments, and a negative correlation with
   greenspace and agriculture. At the local site-level scale, bumblebee
   abundance was negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables
   and fruits, and positively correlated with areas cultivated for flowers,
   although neither correlation was statistically significant (p = 0.070
   and p = 0.051 respectively). Bumblebee species richness was not
   correlated with either land use (p > 0.05). All bumblebee species were
   negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruit,
   bare ground and hard paving. Several flowering plants were visited by
   all bumblebee species, although relative preferences varied between
   bumblebee species. Results emphasise the importance of including floral
   resources within garden and allotment areas cultivated for food, and the
   need for a mosaic of different flowering plants to cater for varying
   floral preferences demonstrated by bumblebee species.}},

Abstract = {{With their abundant floral resources, urban community gardens have the
   potential to play an important role in pollinator conservation. At the
   same time, the gardens themselves are dependent upon the pollination
   services provided by insects. Thus, understanding the variables that can
   increase bee richness or abundance in community gardens can contribute
   to both urban agriculture and pollinator conservation. Here we examine
   the impact of several environmental variables on bee abundance and
   diversity in urban community gardens in Sydney, Australia. We used hand
   netting and trap nests to sample bees in 27 community gardens ranging
   from inner city gardens with limited surrounding green space, to
   suburban gardens located next to national parks. We did not find strong
   support for an impact of any of our variables on bee species richness,
   abundance or diversity. We found high abundance of a recently introduced
   non-native bee: the African carder bee, Afranthidium repetitum (Schulz
   1906). The abundance of African carder bees was negatively correlated
   with the amount of surrounding green space and positively correlated
   with native bee abundance/species richness. Our results highlight the
   seemingly rapid increase in African carder bee populations in inner city
   Sydney, and we call for more research into this bee's potential
   environmental impacts. Our results also suggest that hard-to-change
   environmental factors such as garden size and distance to remnant
   forests may not have a strong influence on native bee diversity and
   abundance in highly urbanized area.}},

Title = {{Specialist nectar-yeasts decline with urbanization in Berlin}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Nectar yeasts are common inhabitants of insect-pollinated flowers but
   factors determining their distribution are not well understood. We
   studied the influence of host identity, environmental factors related to
   pollution/urbanization, and the distance to a target beehive on local
   distribution of nectar yeasts within Robinia pseudoacacia L. and Tilia
   tomentosa Moench in Berlin, Germany. Nectar samples of six individuals
   per species were collected at seven sites in a 2 km radius from each
   target beehive and plated on YM-Agar to visualise the different
   morphotypes, which were then identified by sequencing a section of the
   26S rDNA gene. Multivariate linear models were used to analyze the
   effects of all investigated factors on yeast occurrence per tree. Yeast
   distribution was mainly driven by host identity. The influence of the
   environmental factors (NO2, height of construction, soil sealing)
   strongly depended on the radius around the tree, similar to the distance
   of the sampled beehive. Incidence of specialist nectar-borne yeast
   species decreased with increasing pollution/urbanization index. Given
   that specialist yeast species gave way to generalist yeasts that have a
   reduced dependency on pollinators for between-flower dispersal, our
   results indicate that increased urbanization may restrict the movement
   of nectar-specialized yeasts, via limitations of pollinator foraging
   behavior.}},

Title = {{Temporally dependent pollinator competition and facilitation with mass
   flowering crops affects yield in co-blooming crops}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{One of the greatest challenges in sustainable agricultural production is
   managing ecosystem services, such as pollination, in ways that maximize
   crop yields. Most efforts to increase services by wild pollinators focus
   on management of natural habitats surrounding farms or non-crop habitats
   within farms. However, mass flowering crops create resource pulses that
   may be important determinants of pollinator dynamics. Mass bloom
   attracts pollinators and it is unclear how this affects the pollination
   and yields of other co-blooming crops. We investigated the effects of
   mass flowering apple on the pollinator community and yield of
   co-blooming strawberry on farms spanning a gradient in cover of apple
   orchards in the landscape. The effect of mass flowering apple on
   strawberry was dependent on the stage of apple bloom. During early and
   peak apple bloom, pollinator abundance and yield were reduced in
   landscapes with high cover of apple orchards. Following peak apple
   bloom, pollinator abundance was greater on farms with high apple cover
   and corresponded with increased yields on these farms. Spatial and
   temporal overlap between mass flowering and co-blooming crops alters the
   strength and direction of these dynamics and suggests that yields can be
   optimized by designing agricultural systems that avoid competition while
   maximizing facilitation.}},

Title = {{Exploring the evolutionary origin of floral organs of Erycina pusilla,
   an emerging orchid model system}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAR 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Thousands of flowering plant species attract pollinators
   without offering rewards, but the evolution of this deceit is poorly
   understood. Rewardless flowers of the orchid Erycina pusilla have an
   enlarged median sepal and incised median petal ('lip') to attract
   oil-collecting bees. These bees also forage on similar looking but
   rewarding Malpighiaceae flowers that have five unequally sized petals
   and gland-carrying sepals. The lip of E. pusilla has a `callus' that,
   together with winged `stelidia', mimics these glands. Different
   hypotheses exist about the evolutionary origin of the median sepal,
   callus and stelidia of orchid flowers.
   Results: The evolutionary origin of these organs was investigated using
   a combination of morphological, molecular and phylogenetic techniques to
   a developmental series of floral buds of E. pusilla. The vascular bundle
   of the median sepal indicates it is a first whorl organ but its convex
   epidermal cells reflect convergence of petaloid features. Expression of
   AGL6 EpMADS4 and APETALA3 EpMADS14 is low in the median sepal, possibly
   correlating with its petaloid appearance. A vascular bundle indicating
   second whorl derivation leads to the lip. AGL6 EpMADS5 and APETALA3
   EpMADS13 are most highly expressed in lip and callus, consistent with
   current models for lip identity. Six vascular bundles, indicating a
   stamen-derived origin, lead to the callus, stelidia and stamen. AGAMOUS
   is not expressed in the callus, consistent with its sterilization. Out
   of three copies of AGAMOUS and four copies of SEPALLATA, EpMADS22 and
   EpMADS6 are most highly expressed in the stamen. Another copy of
   AGAMOUS, EpMADS20, and the single copy of SEEDSTICK, EpMADS23, are most
   highly expressed in the stelidia, suggesting EpMADS22 may be required
   for fertile stamens.
   Conclusions: The median sepal, callus and stelidia of E. pusilla appear
   to be derived from a sepal, a stamen that gained petal identity, and
   stamens, respectively. Duplications, diversifying selection and changes
   in spatial expression of different MADS-box genes shaped these organs,
   enabling the rewardless flowers of E. pusilla to mimic an unrelated
   rewarding flower for pollinator attraction. These genetic changes are
   not incorporated in current models and urge for a rethinking of the
   evolution of deceptive flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Insect pollinators such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) are in global
   decline(1,2). A major cause of this decline is habitat loss due to
   agricultural intensification(3). A range of global and national
   initiatives aimed at restoring pollinator habitats and populations have
   been developed(4,5). However, the success of these initiatives depends
   critically upon understanding how landscape change affects key
   population-level parameters, such as survival between lifecycle
   stages(6), in target species. This knowledge is lacking for bumblebees,
   because of the difficulty of systematically finding and monitoring
   colonies in the wild. We used a combination of habitat manipulation,
   land-use and habitat surveys, molecular genetics(7) and demographic and
   spatial modelling to analyse between-year survival of family lineages in
   field populations of three bumblebee species. Here we show that the
   survival of family lineages from the summer worker to the spring queen
   stage in the following year increases significantly with the proportion
   of high-value foraging habitat, including spring floral resources,
   within 250-1,000 m of the natal colony. This provides evidence for a
   positive impact of habitat quality on survival and persistence between
   successive colony cycle stages in bumblebee populations. These findings
   also support the idea that conservation interventions that increase
   floral resources at a landscape scale and throughout the season have
   positive effects on wild pollinators in agricultural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Relationships between abiotic environment, plant functional traits, and

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{The effect-response framework states that plant functional traits link
   the abiotic environment to ecosystem functioning. One ecosystem property
   is the body size of the animals living in the system, which is assumed
   to depend on temperature or resource availability, among others. For
   primary consumers, resource availability may directly be related to
   plant traits, while for secondary consumers the relationship is
   indirect. We used plant traits to describe resource availability along
   an elevational gradient on Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Using structural
   equation models, we determined the response of plant traits to changes
   in precipitation, temperature and disturbance with and assessed whether
   abiotic conditions or community-weighted means of plant traits are
   stronger predictors of the mean size of bees, moths, frugivorous birds,
   and insectivorous birds. Traits indicating tissue density and nutrient
   content strongly responded to variations in precipitation, temperature
   and disturbance. They had direct effects on pollination and fruit
   traits. However, the average body sizes of the animal groups considered
   could only be explained by temperature and habitat structure, not by
   plant traits. Our results demonstrate a strong link between traits and

Abstract = {{Pollinator-driven diversification is thought to be a major source of
   floral variation in plants. Our knowledge of this process is, however,
   limited to indirect assessments of evolutionary changes. Here, we employ
   experimental evolution with fast cycling Brassica rapa plants to
   demonstrate adaptive evolution driven by different pollinators. Our
   study shows pollinator-driven divergent selection as well as divergent
   evolution in plant traits. Plants pollinated by bumblebees evolved
   taller size and more fragrant flowers with increased ultraviolet
   reflection. Bumblebees preferred bumblebee-pollinated plants over
   hoverfly-pollinated plants at the end of the experiment, showing that
   plants had adapted to the bumblebees' preferences. Plants with hoverfly
   pollination became shorter, had reduced emission of some floral
   volatiles, but increased fitness through augmented autonomous
   self-pollination. Our study demonstrates that changes in pollinator
   communities can have rapid consequences on the evolution of plant traits
   and mating system.}},

Title = {{Taxonomic and functional trait diversity of wild bees in different urban

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the major anthropogenic processes contributing to
   local habitat loss and extirpation of numerous species, including wild
   bees, the most widespread pollinators. Little is known about the
   mechanisms through which urbanization impacts wild bee communities, or
   the types of urban green spaces that best promote their conservation in
   cities. The main objective of this study was to describe and compare
   wild bee community diversity, structure, and dynamics in two Canadian
   cities, Montreal and Quebec City. A second objective was to compare
   functional trait diversity among three habitat types (cemeteries,
   community gardens and urban parks) within each city. Bees were collected
   using pan traps and netting on the same 46 sites, multiple times, over
   the active season in 2012 and 2013. A total of 32,237 specimens were
   identified, representing 200 species and 6 families, including two new
   continental records, Hylaeus communis Nylander (1852) and Anthidium
   florentinum (Fabricius, 1775). Despite high community evenness, we found
   significant abundance of diverse species, including exotic ones.
   Spatio-temporal analysis showed higher stability in the most urbanized
   city (Montreal) but low nestedness of species assemblages among the
   three urban habitats in both cities. Our study demonstrates that cities
   are home to diverse communities of wild bees, but in turn affect bee
   community structure and dynamics. We also found that community gardens
   harbour high levels of functional trait diversity. Urban agriculture
   therefore contributes substantially to the provision of functionally
   diverse bee communities and possibly to urban pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a bee survey in neonicotinoid-treated commercial potato
   fields using bowl and vane traps in the 2016 growing season. Traps were
   placed outside the fields, at the field edges, and 10 and 30 m into the
   fields. We collected 756 bees representing 58 species, with Lasioglossum
   spp. comprising 73\% of all captured bees. We found seven Bombus spp.,
   of which B. impatiens was the only known visitor of potato flowers in
   our region. The majority of the bees (68\%) were collected at the field
   edges and in the field margins. Blue vane traps caught almost four-times
   as many bees and collected 30\% more species compared to bowl traps. Bee
   communities did not differ across trap locations but they were different
   among trap types. We tested B. impatiens visitation to neonicotinoid
   treated and untreated potato flowers in field enclosures. The amount of
   time bees spent at flowers and the duration of visits were not
   significantly different between the two treatments. Our results
   demonstrate that a diverse assemblage of bees is associated with an
   agroecosystem dominated by potatoes despite the apparent lack of
   pollinator resources provided by the crop. We found no difference in B.
   impatiens foraging behavior on neonicotinoid-treated compared to
   untreated plants.}},

Journal = {{ECOHEALTH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1, S}},
Pages = {{S74-S83}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Reintroductions can play a key role in the conservation of endangered
   species. Parasites may impact reintroductions, both positively and
   negatively, but few case studies of how to manage parasites during
   reintroductions exist. Bumblebees are in decline at regional and global
   scales, and reintroductions can be used to re-establish extinct local
   populations. Here we report on how the risks associated with parasites
   are being managed in an ongoing reintroduction of the short-haired
   bumblebee, Bombus subterraneus, to the UK. Disease risk analysis was
   conducted and disease risk management plans constructed to design a
   capture-quarantine-release system that minimised the impacts on both the
   bumblebees and on their natural parasites. Given that bumblebee
   parasites are (i) generalists, (ii) geographically ubiquitous, and (iii)
   show evidence of local adaptation, the disease risk management plan was
   designed to limit the co-introduction of parasites from the source
   population in Sweden to the destination site in the UK. Results suggest
   that this process at best eliminated, or at least severely curtailed the
   co-introduction of parasites, and ongoing updates of the plan enabled
   minimization of impacts on natural host-parasite dynamics in the Swedish
   source population. This study suggests that methods designed for
   reintroductions of vertebrate species can be successfully applied to
   invertebrates. Future reintroductions of invertebrates where the
   parasite fauna is less well known should take advantage of
   next-generation barcoding and multiple survey years prior to the start
   of reintroductions, to develop comprehensive disease risk management
   plans.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in abundance and species richness among communities are often
   determined by interactions between biotic and abiotic factors. However,
   for communities composed of species that share a common specialization
   (such as similar foraging adaptations) it may be a key ecological factor
   involved in the common specialization that affects community variations.
   To evaluate this possibility, we characterized the guild of
   oil-collecting bees of a Neotropical savanna in Brazil and tested
   whether differences in Byrsonima abundance and availability of floral
   oil explain differences in species richness and abundance of
   oil-collecting bees of different tribes. Both the number of species and
   total abundance of Centridini species increased with the abundance of
   Byrsonima. One plausible explanation for the stronger adjustment between
   the abundance of Centridini and Byrsonima is that the abundance of these
   plants affects not only the availability of floral oil, but also of
   pollen. These findings indicate that the existence of a common
   specialization among different species does not homogenize their
   response to variations in a common explored resource.}},

Abstract = {{The bumblebee (Bombus lantschouensis Vogt) is an important pollinator of
   wild plants. Sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase (SMPD) is a hydrolase that
   plays a major role in sphingolipid metabolism reactions. We report the
   preparation and characterization of a polyclonal antibody for bumblebee
   SMPD. We then use the polyclonal antiserum to detect the SMPD protein at
   different development stages and in different tissues. Our results
   showed that a 1228bp fragment homologous with the B. terrestris SMPD
   gene was successfully amplified. The molecular weight of the fusion
   protein was about 70kDa by SDS-PAGE. An effective polyclonal antibody
   against SMPD was also obtained from mice and found to have a higher
   specificity for bumblebee SMPD. Western blotting detection showed that
   SMPD was expressed at a high level in queen ovaries, although expression
   was lower in the midgut and venom gland. SMPD expression decreased from
   the egg stage until the pbl pupal stage. We interpret our results as
   showing that the development of an effective polyclonal antiserum for
   the SMPD protein of a bumblebee, which provides a tool for exploring the
   function of the SMPD gene. In addition, the work has confirmed that SMPD
   should be considered as an important enzyme during bumblebee egg and
   larval stages.}},

Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-31}},

Abstract = {{Changes in landscape spatial structure-specifically, reductions in
   habitat area and connectivity-are thought to be a primary cause of
   pollinator declines across North America. However, the mechanisms by
   which landscape structure influences pollinator diversity are not well
   understood. Because flowering plants and pollinators are generally
   mutualistic, the impact of landscape structure on one can influence the
   diversity of the other directly or indirectly. Here, we examine the
   direct and indirect effects of landscape structure on plant and
   pollinator communities in the naturally patchy, dolomite glade
   grasslands of the Missouri Ozarks. We quantified landscape spatial
   structure and the richness of plants and flying invertebrate pollinators
   in 30 glades. Higher pollinator diversity was not directly related to
   greater landscape area and connectivity. However, we found evidence for
   an indirect relationship where better-connected landscapes support
   higher plant richness, which in turn supports greater pollinator
   diversity. Our findings highlight the importance of conserving
   extensive, well-connected natural habitat in order to maintain the plant
   diversity needed to support diverse pollinator communities.}},

Abstract = {{The pollen features of Chaerophyllum coloratum L., endemic to the
   Dinaric Alps, have been examined by both light microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy in order to contribute to a better understanding of
   the taxonomic status of the species. Flower visitors have also been
   observed and analyzed with the aim of clarifying certain pollination
   aspects of the species including flower attractiveness especially to
   honeybees, and also in order to ascertain its contribution to the bee
   pasture. The pollen grains of C. coloratum are isopolar, radially
   symmetrical and medium sized. Polar axis (P) is 26.83 +/- 1.77 mu m
   length, and equatorial diameter (E) is 9.17 +/- 0.57 mu m length. P/E
   ratio amounts 2.90 +/- 0.10 indicating a perprolate shape. In an
   equatorial view, the grains are constricted in the equatorial region
   (bone-shaped), with obtuse polar caps. In polar view, they are
   triangular with obtuse angles and furrows in the sides of the triangle
   (interangular). The grains are tricolporate with three straight
   ectocolpi arranged regularly meridionally, of mean length 14.43 +/- 2.17
   mu m, each of which has one endopore. The characteristic internal
   thickenings around the protruding, clearly visible endopores (costae) in
   the constricted equatorial region are obvious in light microscopy. The
   ornamentation is psilate, irregularly rugulate ({''}cerebroid{''}), the
   exine surface is rather undulating. With regard to the observed flower
   visitors, the following pollination types occurred: melittophily,
   myophily, sapromyophily, cantharophily, and phalaenophily, and the most
   frequent pollinator was the honeybee.}},

Title = {{How to efficiently obtain accurate estimates of flower visitation rates
   by pollinators}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{11-18}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Regional declines in insect pollinators have raised concerns about crop
   pollination. Many pollinator studies use visitation rate
   (pollinators/time) as a proxy for the quality of crop pollination.
   Visitation rate estimates are based on observation durations that vary
   significantly between studies. How observation duration relates to the
   accuracy of the visitation rate estimate is, however, unknown. We
   studied this relationship using six day-long observations (06:00 h-19:00
   h) in leek-seed production fields (totalling 78 h). We analysed beyond
   which point in time observing longer did not significantly improve the
   accuracy of the visitation rate estimate (minimum observation duration).
   We furthermore explored the relationship between the minimum observation
   duration and visitation rate, time of day and temperature. We found that
   the minimum observation duration (mean +/- SD: 24 +/- 11.9 min) was
   significantly related to visitation rate, where the observation time
   required to obtain accurate estimates decreased with increasing
   visitation rate. Minimum observation duration varied greatly between
   days and between fields but not within days. Within days, the visitation
   rates differed significantly only between the hour-intervals 06:00
   h-07:00 h (lowest visitation rate) and 09:00 h-11:00 h (highest rate).
   Minimum observation duration decreased up to around 22 degrees C beyond
   which it remained fairly stable. Surprisingly, even after three day-long
   observations on the same plant we found new pollinator species visiting
   the flowers, suggesting that species-richness estimates based on plant
   observations alone probably underestimate true species richness. Because
   especially between-day variation in visitation rate on single plants can
   be large, reliable estimates of the pollinator visitation rate during
   the plants flowering time require observations on multiple days.
   Standardising the number of pollinators rather than the time to observe
   (standardised pollinator timing approach: time to n-pollinator visits)
   may provide more consistent accurate assessments of visitation rate,
   especially for studies that use gradients in visitation rates to examine
   the contribution of pollinators to crop pollination. (C) 2017

Pages = {{19-25}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of insect species provide pollination services in natural
   and agricultural ecosystems, but in order to quantify their contribution
   it is necessary to evaluate their effectiveness. An important component
   of this is to determine their ability to transfer pollen to stigmas
   which typically requires observers to wait for insects to visit focal
   flowers (static approach); a time-consuming process not amenable to
   obtaining measures for pollinating species of low local abundance. An
   alternative method (active approach) is to detach test flowers and
   present them to the targeted flower visitor. This offers a number of
   advantages (e.g. increased speed and flexibility), but may alter insect
   behaviour. We compared pollen deposition within flowering onion crops
   using three bee (Apoidea) and three fly (Diptera) species. The two
   approaches resulted in similar numbers of pollen grains being deposited
   onto stigmas for each insect species, thereby supporting the validity of
   the active as an alternative to the static approach in our test crop.
   The ability to rapidly assess stigmatic pollen deposition of a broad
   range of insects using the active approach can greatly assist
   assessments of pollinator contribution within plant pollinator
   assemblages. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{45-55}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relative contributions of wild and managed
   pollinators, and the functional contributions made by a diverse
   pollinator community, is essential to the maintenance of yields in the
   75\% of our crops that benefit from insect pollination. We describe a
   field study and pollinator exclusion experiments conducted on two
   soft-fruit crops in a system with both wild and managed pollinators. We
   test whether fruit quality and quantity is limited by pollination, and
   whether different pollinating insects respond differently to varying
   weather conditions. Both strawberries and raspberries produced fewer
   marketable fruits when insects were excluded, demonstrating dependence
   on insect pollinators. Raspberries had a short flowering season which
   coincided with peak abundance of bees, and attracted many bees per
   flower. In contrast, strawberries had a much longer flowering season and
   appeared to be much less attractive to pollinators, so that ensuring
   adequate pollination is likely to be more challenging. The proportion of
   high-quality strawberries was positively related to pollinator
   abundance, suggesting that yield was limited by inadequate pollination
   on some farms. The relative abundance of different pollinator taxa
   visiting strawberries changed markedly through the season, demonstrating
   seasonal complementarity. Insect visitors responded differently to
   changing weather conditions suggesting that diversity can reduce the
   risk of pollination service shortfalls. For example, flies visited the
   crop flowers in poor weather and at the end of the flowering season when
   other pollinators were scarce, and so may provide a unique functional
   contribution. Understanding how differences between pollinator groups
   can enhance pollination services to crops strengthens the case for
   multiple species management. We provide evidence for the link between
   increased diversity and function in real crop systems, highlighting the
   risks of replacing all pollinators with managed alternatives. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The study of floral phenology patterns and floral visitors of palms is
   key to understanding evolutionary interactions between plants and
   insects. We studied the flowering pattern and floral visitors of
   Wettinia kalbreyeri in an Andean montane forest of Colombia. We
   monitored 100 adult palms throughout 1-year and observed an asynchronous
   flowering pattern at the population level. Collectively, those 100
   individuals developed 125 inflorescences, composed of 96 staminates, 28
   pistillates, and 1 androgynous. We classified 39 morphotypes of insect
   floral visitors, including beetles, bees, and flies. The composition and
   abundance of floral visitors between staminate and pistillate
   inflorescences were markedly different. Sap beetles - Mystrops - were
   the most abundant visitors in both pistillate and staminate
   inflorescences. We suggest that the higher production of staminate
   inflorescences compared to pistillate inflorescences and the
   availability of inflorescences throughout the year may promote a
   permanent and abundant community of floral visitors. This study suggests
   that Mystrops are associated with Wettinia species in high altitude
   forests, as it also occurs in Ceroxylum species. (C) 2017 Universidad

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{468-476}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Properties of floral nectar have been used to
   predict if a plant species is pollinated by birds. To see whether
   winter-flowering plants evolve nectar properties corresponding to bird
   pollinators, nectar properties of several Camellia species (including
   the golden-flowered tea), as well as the role of floral visitors as
   effective pollinators, were examined.
   METHODS: Potential pollinators of Camellia petelotii were identified at
   different times of day and under various weather conditions. A bird
   exclusion experiment was used to compare the pollination effectiveness
   of birds and insects. Nectar sugar components (fructose, glucose, and
   sucrose) from C. petelotii growing wild and another seven Camellia
   species and 22 additional cultivars (all in cultivation) were examined
   by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
   KEY RESULTS: The sunbird Aethopyga siparaja and honeybees were the most
   frequent floral visitors to C. petelotii. Honeybee visits were
   significantly reduced in cloudy/rainy weather. The fruit and seed set of
   flowers with birds excluded were reduced by 64\%, indicating that bird
   pollination is significant. For the wild populations of C. petelotii, a
   bagged flower could secrete 157 mu L nectar; this nectar has a low sugar
   concentration (19\%) and is sucrose-dominant (87\%). The eight Camellia
   species and 22 cultivars had an average sugar concentration of around
   30\% and a sucrose concentration of 80\%, demonstrating sucrose-dominant
   nectar in Camellia species.
   CONCLUSIONS: The nectar sugar composition of C amellia species was
   characterized by sucrose dominance. In addition, the large reduction in
   seed set when birds are excluded in the golden-flowered tea also
   supports the suggestion that these winter-flowering plants may have
   evolved with birds as significant pollinators.}},

Volume = {{240}},

Abstract = {{Wild pollinators aredeclining in abundance, diversity and richness and
   this puts the ecosystem function pollination at risk. Here, we
   investigated how land-use intensity and the three main components of
   land use used on the study sites (mowing, grazing, fertilisation) affect
   bumblebee visitation to bird's-foot trefoil, Lotus corniculatus, using a
   novel chemistry-based approach that overcomes the limitations of
   classical visitation monitoring. This approach uses the hydrocarbon
   footprints left behind by bumblebees that accumulate within the
   epicuticular wax of flowers. Along with land-use intensity, we
   investigated whether the small-scale (patch) population density and
   local abundance of L. corniculatus affected visitation. We found that
   the amount of footprints, and thus visitation, of bumblebees to L.
   corniculatus increased with land-use and grazing intensity while
   traditionally recorded visitation rates did not show such an effect. We
   further found that the patch density and local abundance of L.
   corniculatus had no effect on visitation. We conclude that bumblebee
   visitation to L. corniculatus increased with land use using the novel
   approach but emphasise that foraging decisions by bumblebees can be
   affected by many different parameters unrelated to the land-use
   intensity of a specific site. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Montana supports a diverse assemblage of bumble bees (Bombus Latreille)
   due to its size, landscape diversity, and location at the junction of
   known geographic ranges of North American species. We compiled the first
   inventory of Bombus species in Montana, using records from 25 natural
   history collections and labs engaged in bee research, collected over the
   past 125 years, as well as specimens collected specifically for this
   project during the summer of 2015. Over 12,000 records are included,
   with 28 species of Bombus now confirmed in the state. Based on
   information from nearby regions, four additional species are predicted
   to occur in Montana. Of the 28 species, Bombus bimaculatus Cresson and
   Bombus borealis Kirby are new state records. The presence of B. borealis
   was previously predicted, but the presence of B. bimaculatus in Montana
   represents a substantial extension of its previously reported range.
   Four additional `` eastern{''} bumble bee species are recorded from the
   state, and three species pairs thought to replace one another from the
   eastern to western United States are now known to be sympatric in
   Montana. Additionally, our data are consistent with reported declines in
   populations of Bombus occidentalis Greene and Bombus suckleyi Greene,
   highlighting a need for targeted surveys of these two species in
   Montana.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{233-243}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes in land use and habitat fragmentation are thought
   to be greater drivers of declines in the abundance and species richness
   of pollinating insects such as bees (Hymenoptera: Apiformes) than
   agricultural intensification and pesticide use. Yet, few studies have
   examined how habitat fragmentation by urbanization affects pollinator
   nesting dynamics. We investigated the nesting dynamics of native
   solitary bee species that inhabit fragments of Sonoran Desert in Tucson,
   AZ. Specifically, we compared floral densities, nest completion, and
   nest attack rates of cavity-nesting bees in large (> 2 ha) and small (<
   0.5 ha) fragments. In small fragments, where resource density was high,
   more nests were occupied and females responded by provisioning offspring
   more quickly than in larger fragments where resource density was low.
   However, nests in small fragments were more likely to be attacked by
   natural enemies than those in large fragments. In this desert system,
   habitat size, the most-often used metric for examination of how
   pollinators respond to habitat fragmentation, affects nesting dynamics
   and demographics through its interactions with nest-site availability,
   abundance of floral resources, and natural enemy attack. As landscape
   fragmentation increases, pollinator conservation should not only
   consider food sources but also nesting requirements and interactions
   with natural enemies.}},

Abstract = {{Invertebrates are generally regarded with apathy, distaste, and fear in
   Western society. These negative sentiments likely contribute to the
   disparity in wildlife conservation efforts, which largely favor
   vertebrate organisms. Bees represent one of the most ecologically and
   economically important invertebrate groups, yet bee diversity and
   abundance is declining worldwide, mirroring the general decline of
   invertebrate biodiversity. Developing and implementing successful
   conservation efforts requires interdisciplinary research that considers
   the ecological and social realities of today's world. To better inform
   conservation efforts related to bees, we examined adolescents'
   experiences and knowledge of, and attitudes toward, bees and
   investigated how these dimensions related to one another. A total of 794
   eighth-grade science students from the suburbs of Chicago, USA completed
   a 48-item, paper questionnaire. The results indicated that adolescents
   were only somewhat knowledgeable about bee biology and services, and
   they confused bees with other flying insects, especially those with
   black-and-yellow coloration. Adolescents regarded bees with a generally
   neutral attitude; their knowledge and attitudes were correlated in a
   positive manner. Various bee-related experiences were linked to
   adolescents' knowledge and attitudes and may have influenced bee-related
   behavior. In particular, students who engaged in gardening and lawn-care
   activities demonstrated higher levels of knowledge and more positive
   attitudes. This study provides insight into the relationships between
   experiences and knowledge of, and attitudes toward, invertebrates and
   suggests that engaging in certain outdoor activities may promote
   positive attitudes toward bees among adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal limited resource and niche overlap studies have
   been widely used to explain resource-sharing in community ecology.
   Furthermore, morphological and behavioral differences among species are
   relevant to predict how they may share niche availabilities. We
   evaluated temporal niche overlap and the ability of visitors to collect
   floral resources on three Malpighiaceae species in the Brazilian
   savannah. We hypothesized: (I) an overlap between the temporal niches
   due the similarities between their floral resources requirements and the
   temporal limitation of flowering; and (II) a differential ability of bee
   species in resource harvesting. The 31 floral visitor species exhibited
   a higher niche overlap than expected by chance, confirming our first
   hypothesis. Furthermore, according to our second hypothesis, we observed
   that floral visitors showed a different efficiency in resource
   collection, depending on bee size and behavior. We believe that this may
   be a proxy of pollination efficiency. Our discussion is based on the
   distinct specialization of oil-collecting abilities and the specific
   requirements of each bee tribe.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees collect pollen from some plants by grasping flowers and
   vibrating their flight muscles-a behavior termed buzz pollination, or
   sonication. The extent to which bees can and do alter their sonication
   has been scarcely documented. We show that bumblebees are capable of
   changing their vibration frequency. In two field studies, we found that
   relative humidity, date, and bee size are associated with sonication
   frequency and/or duration. We found that the frequency and duration of
   sonications differed on different plants. In a greenhouse study, we
   found that individual bumblebees change their sonication frequency and
   duration when collecting pollen from flowers of three different Solanum
   plants. This suggests that bees may change their sonication behavior to
   optimize pollen release from different types of flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Cleptoparasites play a key ecological role by reducing their host
   populations. In order to study the phenological patterns of the natural
   enemies of the bee Monoeca haemorrhoidalis (Smith), four emergence traps
   were installed in two nest aggregations during the activity period of
   this solitary bee species. Four species of natural enemies were sampled
   in the emergence traps: Tetraolytta gerardi (Pic), Tetraonyx
   distincticollis Pic (Meloidae), Protosiris gigas Melo (Apidae), and
   Pseudomethoca spixi (Diller) (Mutillidae). Monoeca haemorrhoidalis
   showed emergence patterns characterized by bimodal curves with two
   distinct peaks throughout its activity period in both years. Individuals
   of P. gigas started to emerge during the first peak of its host, but the
   emergence curve of this cleptoparasite was followed by a decline in
   abundance of M. haemorrhoidalis specimens in both years. The abrupt
   decline in the emergence period of M. haemorrhoidalis could be a
   temporal strategy against the attack of P. gigas since the activity
   period of this cuckoo bee occurred during the lowest number of emergent
   host individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Ecologically, the interaction between plant and pollinators is mutually
   beneficial for the survival and adaptability. It leads to a higher level
   of fitness of both interacting partners. Birds play significant roles in
   plant reproduction and the fitness of ecosystem in tropical forest. This
   study was carried out with the objective to analyze legitimate floral
   visitors of Bombax ceiba Linn. in tropical forests of Indo-Burma region
   of India in relation to pollen production and mating system. The study
   was performed at two different locations, namely Bethlehem Vengthlang
   (23 degrees 430'N latitude and 92 degrees 430'E longitude) and Tanhril
   (43 degrees 37'N latitudes and 38 degrees 39'E longitudes). Both study
   sites are located 30 km apart from each other. Analysis revealed that
   the pollination in B. ceiba was mostly carried out by the birds, and the
   flowers were visited and foraged by thirteen (13) species of birds
   belonging to five families of the order of Passeriformes. One species of
   squirrel (Funambulus sp.) was also recorded visiting the flowers of B.
   ceiba. Study on mating-system evaluation revealed that the B ceiba is an
   outcrossing tree species, requiring the services of adequate pollinators
   for successful pollination and reproductive fitness. However,
   geitonogamy was partly functional. The index of self-incompatibility
   (ISI) value exposed that the species is mostly self-incompatible. All
   the species of birds were efficient pollinators for B. ceiba in the
   present study sites. The fruit and seed sets following natural
   pollination are fairly high compared with other bird-pollinated species.
   High pollen-production capacities per flower and per tree along with the
   high visitation of bird pollinators would have promoted the maximum
   reproductive success in B. ceiba. This also depicts that the species
   does not have the problem of pollen and resource limitations in
   Indo-Burma region of North-East India. B. ceiba tree is often used in
   urban forestry, and these results can be used for a comparative study of
   natural and human-altered ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of research.Pollination syndromes are used to infer pollinators
   from floral attributes when field observations of floral visitors are
   lacking. Such inferences are often found to be incorrect or too
   generalized. To investigate the relationship between pollinators and
   observable differences in a genus of Lamiaceae with flowers that appear
   ornithophilous and entomophilous, we experimentally quantified floral
   morphology and pollinator assemblages in a phylogenetic
   perspective.Methodology.Floral morphology was examined using
   multivariate analysis of geometric morphometrics (corolla shape
   described by landmarks), linear dimensions, and nonmetric attributes for
   17 species of Prostanthera. Pollination effectiveness was determined
   through censuses of floral visitors and interactions by pollinators with
   flowers, and multivariate statistics were used to examine correspondence
   between these data and nonlandmark characters. Ancestral state
   reconstruction was performed using geometric morphometric data and a
   phylogenetic tree.Pivotal results.Three floral morphologies were
   identified in Prostanthera, each of which was associated with a unique
   pollinator assemblage and corroborated by our detailed field
   observations. A higher abundance of bees visited flowers with the
   ancestral (bee) floral type, which had a long corolla, porrect adaxial
   lobes, and long anther appendages. Visits by birds were more frequent to
   the derived bird floral type, characterized by red or green flowers with
   larger nectar volumes, longer and narrower corollas, and a reflexed
   abaxial lobe. Another derived lineage attracted a higher abundance of
   generalist flies and beetles (beetle+fly floral type). This lineage had
   flowers with a shorter corolla tube, reflexed adaxial lobes, and shorter
   anther appendages.Conclusions.When pollinator frequency was used as a
   proxy for pollinator effectiveness, the correspondence between the
   floral types and pollinator assemblages supported traditional concepts
   of bird and insect pollination syndromes. Intermediates between these
   floral types also corresponded with phylogenetic position and pollinator
   assemblage. Linear measurements of floral attributes were just as
   reliable as landmark data in predicting pollinator assemblages. By
   combining a molecular phylogeny with the above data, evidence indicated
   that the bird and beetle+fly floral types diversified from an ancestral
   bee floral type, demonstrating at least one evolutionary specialization
   for birds, as well as another shift toward a more generalized
   pollination syndrome. This combination of techniques presents a
   potential application with which to investigate the evolution of
   pollination.}},

Title = {{Effect of dengue mosquito control insecticide thermal fogging on

Abstract = {{Dengue vector control programmes are mainly focused on insecticide
   fogging/space spraying to control adult Aedes mosquito vector
   populations. Due to the diurnal habit of the vectors, spraying is
   routinely conducted during the day when many other insect species are
   also active. This study reports the simultaneous effect of fogging on
   non-target insects by direct counting of knockdown in the insect
   population. Eight fogging treatments were conducted in two sites in
   Kurunegala District of Sri Lanka. Pesguard insecticide was sprayed in
   each treatment for 8 minutes according to the standard methodology and
   the `knockdown insects' were collected on randomly spread polyethythene
   sheets (10 m(2)). A total of 3884 insects (24.3 insects per treatment
   per m(2)) belonging to 12 orders were collected and 12.44\% of them
   recovered during a 24-hr recovery period. Diptera was the most affected
   insect order (36\%) followed by Collembola (30\%) and Thysanoptera
   (17\%). Out of the 31 mosquitoes (<1\%) collected, only two (<0.1\%)
   belonged to the genus Aedes. Body length of 93\% of the affected insects
   ranged from 0.35 mm to 1.8 mm. Positive controls using the WHO standard
   cage bioassays with the mosquito Ae. albopictus (n = 417) and the
   stingless bee Trigona iridipennis (n = 122) showed 100\% initial
   knockdown, and 83.5\% mosquito and 93.5\% bee mortalities after the
   recovery period. The study shows that insecticide fogging does have a
   severe effect on non-target insects such as pollinators; therefore,
   fogging operations should be done in a controlled manner and
   indiscriminate fogging should be avoided.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1898-1908}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Modeling pollination ecosystem services requires a spatially explicit,
   process-based approach because they depend on both the behavioral
   responses of pollinators to the amount and spatial arrangement of
   habitat and on the within- and between-season dynamics of pollinator
   populations in response to land use. We describe a novel pollinator
   model predicting flower visitation rates by wild central-place foragers
   (e.g., nesting bees) in spatially explicit landscapes. The model goes
   beyond existing approaches by: (1) integrating preferential use of more
   rewarding floral and nesting resources; (2) considering population
   growth over time; (3) allowing different dispersal distances for workers
   and reproductives; (4) providing visitation rates for use in crop
   pollination models. We use the model to estimate the effect of
   establishing grassy field margins offering nesting resources and a low
   quantity of flower resources, and/or late-flowering flower strips
   offering no nesting resources but abundant flowers, on bumble bee
   populations and visitation rates to flowers in landscapes that differ in
   amounts of linear seminatural habitats and early mass-flowering crops.
   Flower strips were three times more effective in increasing pollinator
   populations and visitation rates than field margins, and this effect
   increased over time. Late-blooming flower strips increased early-season
   visitation rates, but decreased visitation rates in other late-season
   flowers. Increases in population size over time in response to flower
   strips and amounts of linear seminatural habitats reduced this apparent
   competition for pollinators. Our spatially explicit, process-based model
   generates emergent patterns reflecting empirical observations, such that
   adding flower resources may have contrasting short- and long-term
   effects due to apparent competition for pollinators and pollinator
   population size increase. It allows exploring these effects and
   comparing effect sizes in ways not possible with other existing models.
   Future applications include species comparisons, analysis of the
   sensitivity of predictions to life-history traits, as well as
   large-scale management intervention and policy assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Andean orogeny and the ecological changes that followed promoted
   diversification in plant and animal lineages since the Early Miocene.
   The angiosperm genus Caiophora (Loasaceae, subfam. Loasoideae) comprises
   around 50 species that are endemic to South America. These are
   distributed from southern Ecuador to Central Chile and Argentina. Bee
   pollination and distribution at low-intermediate elevations probably
   represent the ancestral condition in the lineage that includes Caiophora
   and its allied genera. The majority of Caiophora species grow at high
   elevations in the Andes, where some depend on vertebrate pollination.
   Previous studies did not resolve phylogenetic relationships within
   Caiophora, which precluded the dating of the origin and divergence of
   this group. We used markers of one nuclear (ITS) and one plastid region
   (trnS (GCU) -trnG (UUC) ) to solve phylogenetic relationships among 19
   Caiophora species (including different accessions). We also included 10
   species of the allied genera Blumenbachia and Loasa. Aosa rostrata and
   Xylopodia klaprothioides were used as outgroups. Phylogenetic
   reconstruction strongly supports the monophyly of Caiophora, and
   although several clades within this genus are poorly supported, our
   study yielded a better infra-generic resolution than previous studies.
   The origin of Caiophora is dated to the Early-Middle Miocene and can be
   related to the uplift of the Cordilleras Frontal and Principal and to
   Pacific marine transgressions. According to our estimations, Caiophora
   began to diversify during the Middle-Late Miocene and this unfolding
   proceeded eastwards during the Pliocene and the Pleistocene, in parallel
   to the uplift of different Andean mountain ranges.}},

Abstract = {{Climate impact models are often implemented at horizontal resolutions
   ({''}scales{''}) too coarse to be readily applied in local impact
   assessments. However, recent advancements in fine-scale modeling are
   allowing the creation of impact models that can be applied to
   landscape-scale adaptation planning. Here, we illustrate the use of
   fine-scale impact models for landscape-scale adaptation planning of
   pollination services for six sites in Central America. The strategies
   include the identification of (1) potential reservoir areas that may
   retain bee diversity and serve as a source of recolonization after
   climate shocks such as droughts; and (2) potential restoration areas,
   where improving forest cover is likely to lead to increases in
   pollinator services both in the present and in the future. Coarse-scale
   (> 1-km horizontal resolution) climatic controls on pollinator diversity
   and forest cover determine the general location of these areas in our
   six landscapes. Fine-scale (< 100-m horizontal resolution) variation in
   climatic water deficit provides an index of forest health which can help
   identify intervention strategies within these zones. All sites have
   significant areas in which protecting or restoring forest cover is
   likely to enhance pollination services. The gradient in rainfall change
   across the study sites dictates choice of adaptation strategies.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Bees are the most important diurnal pollinators of angiosperms. In
   several groups of bees a nocturnal/crepuscular habit developed, yet
   little is known about their role in pollination and whether some plants
   are adapted specifically to these bees. We used a multidisciplinary
   approach to investigate the reproductive biology and to understand the
   role of nocturnal/crepuscular bees in pollination of Campomanesia phaea
   (Myrtaceae), popularly named cambuci.
   We studied the floral biology and breeding system of C.phaea. We
   collected the floral visitors and tested the pollinators' effectiveness.
   We also determined the floral scents released at night and during
   daytime, and studied behavioural responses of crepuscular/nocturnal bees
   towards these scents.
   The flowers of cambuci were self-incompatible and had pollen as the only
   resource for flower visitors. Anthesis lasted around 14h, beginning at
   04:30h at night. The flowers released 14 volatile compounds, mainly
   aliphatic and aromatic compounds. We collected 52 species of floral
   visitors, mainly bees. Nocturnal and crepuscular bees (four species)
   were among the most frequent species and the only effective pollinators.
   In field bioassays performed at night, nocturnal/crepuscular bees were
   attracted by a synthetic scent blend consisting of the six most abundant
   compounds.
   This study describes the first scent-mediated pollination system between
   a plant and its nocturnal bee pollinators. Further, C.phaea has several
   floral traits that do not allow classification into other nocturnal
   pollination syndromes (e.g. pollinator attraction already before
   sunrise, with pollen as the only reward), instead it is a plant
   specifically adapted to nocturnal bees.}},

Abstract = {{The incredible pollination mechanisms displayed by orchid flowers has
   inspired biologists over the centuries. Based on the intriguing flower
   structures, the relationship among orchid species and their pollinators
   has been frequently regarded as very specialised.
   Given that visits on flowers pollinated by oil-collecting bees are
   regularly rare, and in Oncidiinae the flowers frequently
   attractexclusively species that act as effective pollinators, the
   comparative reproductive biology and pollinator specificity of two
   sympatric Gomesa (G.varicosa and G.montana; Oncidiinae) were
   analysedbased on records of floral morphology, production of floral
   rewards, pollinators and pollination mechanisms. Furthermore,
   experimental pollinations were carried out in order to examine the
   breeding systems.
   The results have show that in the studied population, both Gomesa are
   visited by several bee species, but these orchids present a specific
   pollination system.Pollinaria are deposited on the head of Centridini
   (G.varicosa and G.montana) and Epicharitini (G.varicosa) bees when
   landed on the central callus of the labellumto collect lipoidal
   substances produced by glandular elaiophores on lateral lobes of the
   labellum. Both species are dependent on a biotic pollen vector to set
   fruits. Gomesamontana is completely self-incompatible, while G.varicosa
   is partially self-compatible.
   Our results indicate that although the occurrence of self-sterile
   species seems to be common in Oncidiinae, in partially self-incompatible
   species, as is the case of G.varicosa, self-compatibility has been
   considered as an important factor favouring reproductive assurance in
   populations with low visitation frequencies, despite occurrence of
   inbreeding depression.}},

Title = {{Consequences of a nectar yeast for pollinator preference and performance}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Pollinators utilize floral resources that vary in colour, scent and
   reward quality. Variation in such traits, including nectar rewards, in
   addition to cues associated with their quality, can influence pollinator
   foraging decisions with consequences for pollinator reproductive
   success. Nectar is commonly subject to colonization by micro-organisms
   capable of affecting a suite of traits important for pollinator
   attraction and fitness; yet, links between microbial presence and
   changes in pollinator preference and performance remain few. Here, we
   evaluated the effects of a nectar-inhabiting micro-organism on
   pollinator foraging behaviour and reproduction using the common eastern
   bumblebee Bombus impatiens and the cosmopolitan nectar yeast
   Metschnikowia reukaufii. Using a combination of choice and no-choice
   behavioural and feeding assays, we manipulated the presence and
   viability of M.reukaufii in nectar and assessed bumblebee foraging and
   reproductive responses.Bombus impatiens workers responded positively to
   the presence of yeasts. Foragers trained to associate yeast presence
   with flower colour visited a significantly greater proportion of flowers
   inoculated with yeast when subject to a colour discrimination test.
   Moreover, foragers naive to nectar yeasts incorporated more
   yeast-inoculated flowers into initial foraging bouts when presented with
   a novel floral array. In addition, bees spent significantly longer
   foraging on yeast-inoculated flowers compared to yeast-free flowers.
   However, when we manipulated yeast presence and viability in
   microcolonies of queenless workers, we found no effect of yeast on
   components of bumblebee reproduction, such as initiation of egg laying
   and number of eggs laid. This lack of an effect of yeast persisted even
   under conditions of pollen limitation. Taken together, these results
   suggest that nectar yeasts can enhance floral signalling and alter
   pollinator foraging behaviour at individual flowers, though they may not
   directly affect pollinator performance. Thus, nectar yeasts may play a
   significant role in mediating pollinator foraging behaviour, with
   consequences for plant fitness and evolution of floral traits.}},

Title = {{Historical changes in the importance of climate and land use as

Abstract = {{AimSpecies distribution models are often used to project species
   distributions to different environmental conditions. However, most
   models do not consider whether the importance of abiotic factors may
   change over time. If they change, this has implications for the
   assessment of how abiotic changes affect species distributions. Here, we
   use spatially explicit historical data on species occurrences, climate
   and land use to test whether the importance of different climatic and
   land-use drivers as determinants of species distributions has remained
   constant over a period of >60years (1951-2014).
   LocationThe Netherlands.
   MethodsUsing species distribution models and a comprehensive
   country-wide dataset at 5x5km resolution, we modelled the distribution
   of a total of 398 pollinator species (bees, butterflies and hoverflies)
   for three periods (1951-1970, 1971-1990 and 1998-2014). We then
   evaluated whether the importance of variables related to climate
   (precipitation, temperature) and land use (landscape composition and
   habitat fragmentation) in determining pollinator distributions has
   changed over time.
   ResultsVariables related to landscape composition were highly important
   in determining pollinator distributions in all periods. Precipitation
   was generally less important than temperature, and habitat fragmentation
   less than landscape composition. Land-use variables remained equally
   important across time for all pollinator groups, except for bees where
   the importance of habitat fragmentation decreased significantly over
   time. Among climate variables, the importance of precipitation did not
   change across time for any pollinator group. However, the importance of
   temperature increased significantly in recent times for bees and
   hoverflies.
   Main conclusionsDeterminants of species distributions can change in
   their importance over time when changes in the magnitude and range of
   environmental conditions occur. Given future temperature rises, our
   results imply that species distribution models calibrated with current
   climatic conditions may not adequately predict the future importance of
   environmental factors in driving species distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Modifications of landscape structure and composition can decrease the
   availability of floral resources, resulting in the decline of many
   pollinator species, including bumblebees. These declines may have
   significant ecological consequences, because bumblebees pollinate a
   large range of plant species. Our study was carried out in heathlands,
   open semi-natural habitats that have decreased considerably due to human
   activities. We analysed how floral resources affect bumblebee
   communities throughout the colony lifetime at three scales: plot scale,
   heathland patch scale, and landscape scale. Floral density at the plot
   scale and spruce plantations at the landscape scale influenced bumblebee
   communities. The abundance of bumblebees on ericaceous species was
   higher when the landscape included a substantial proportion of
   unsuitable foraging habitat (i.e., spruce plantations). Both life
   history traits and colony life cycle stage influenced bumblebee
   responses to the availability of floral resources. Bumblebees were more
   affected by floral resources during the colony development phase than
   during the nest-foundation or mating phases. Moreover, bumblebees of
   species that form large colonies needed larger quantities of favourable
   foraging habitat, compared with small-colony bees, and their proportion
   decreased in habitats dominated by spruce plantations. In conclusion,
   the conservation of plant-bumblebee interactions will require management
   at a larger spatial scale than the restricted protected habitats.
   Moreover, at the landscape scale, both quantity of favourable foraging
   patches and their ecological continuity are important to conserve both
   small-and large-colony species.}},

   important ecologically, culturally, and economically as pollinators and

   taxonomic status of some species (e.g., M. yucatanica), and set a
   baseline on the conservation status of other species, challenging
   previous reports (e.g., M. beecheii). Our models show that 20 \% or less
   of the areas of predicted presence are under protection, with large
   proportions corresponding to low-intensity cropland, offering
   conservation alternatives in disturbed landscapes. This information will
   assist further studies on potential conservation strategies, and will

   fauna on plant species in the Brazilian Chaco to determine (1) groups of
   floral visitors and occurrence; (2) richness and abundance of fauna in
   relation to flowering flora and meteorological variables; (3) groups of
   visitors that pollinate or thieving flora; (4) distribution of
   herbaceous and woody strata throughout the year of flowering; (5)
   variation in flowering as a whole community, in the context of abiotic
   factors; and (6) the predominant plant families and species. We sampled
   eight groups of floral visitors, totalling 105 sampled species and 644
   specimens. The flies and bees were the richest groups, with bees forming
   the most abundant group. The phenology of the fauna and flora was not
   clustered and exhibited a continuous and bimodal flowering. The
   abundance and richness of floral visitors were positively related to the
   quantity of plant species and flowering, as well as rainfall. Herbaceous
   and woody strata are important for the maintenance of anthophilous fauna
   throughout the year. Plant species with the highest abundance and the
   longest flowering period presented the highest richness and/or abundance
   of floral visitors. The percentage of pollination was higher than that
   of resource theft. Bees and flies were the main groups of pollinators,
   whereas flies were the main thieves. The present survey is only a
   starting point for future studies on the networks of interactions
   between plants and their floral visitors in the Brazilian Chaco.}},

   Efficacy and environmental impact of neonicotinoid seed treatments and
   alternative measures}},
Journal = {{CROP PROTECTION}},

Abstract = {{The use of neonicotinoids in sugar beet seed treatments is widespread
   across Europe because they effectively control most harmful arthropods.
   In most European countries, neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thiamethoxam
   and imidacloprid) are used in seed treatments on almost 100\% of
   conventionally cultivated sugar beet fields. Additional foliar
   insecticide applications during the growing period with e.g. carbamates
   or pyrethroids are not conducted on most fields. Currently, the use of
   neonicotinoids in seed treatments of bee attracting crops such as
   rapeseed is banned in the European Union. The European Food Safety
   Authority will re-evaluate the risk for pollinators posed by
   neonicotinoids in seed treatments presumably by 2017. A possible total
   ban of neonicotinoids also in beet crops is likely which might increase
   the application of foliar insecticides throughout the growing period. In
   this article, the significance of neonicotinoids for the Central and
   Northern European sugar beet cultivation is reviewed and alternatives
   are considered. Current and former uses of insecticides, frequency of
   arthropod pests and their control, effects on yield and problems arising
   from resistances against insecticides are included in this review as
   well as environmental hazards. Exposure of non-target organisms to
   neonicotinoids in sugar beet seed treatments seems to be rather
   unlikely: both seed pelleting procedure and drilling technique conform
   to highest technical standards in terms of abrasion and drift of
   insecticides. The release of neonicotinoids to the environment via
   guttation or residues at harvest is low. Moreover, neonicotinoids in
   seed treatments can hardly be replaced as a control measure for the most
   damaging pest Myzus persicae Sulz. due to a lack of effective
   alternatives together with resistance of many populations against
   carbamates and pyrethroids. To control damaging seedling pests,
   tefluthrin in seed treatments often might be as effective as
   neonicotinoids, but its efficacy can be reduced under severe pest
   pressure of e.g. Atomaria linearis Steph. However, damaging arthropod
   pests do not occur in every field in every year. Thus, there is a
   potential for reducing the area treated with neonicotinoids in sugar
   beet. Monitoring systems and models to identify regions (and years) with
   a high risk of harmful pest incidences should be developed and decisions
   on the use of insecticides in seed treatments should be based on the
   probability of pest occurrence. Such situation-based pest management
   practices are needed to improve the sustainability of agricultural
   systems and to reduce the potential for harmful side effects of
   insecticides for the environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim The endangered Galapagos shrub snapdragon (Galvezia leucantha,
   Antirrhineae, Plantaginaceae) is restricted to small populations on four
   islands. In this study, we appraised results from taxonomy, genetics,
   phylogenetics, phylogeography and pollination ecology to reconstruct the
   evolutionary history of the genus Galvezia.
   Location Peru, continental Ecuador and Galapagos.
   Methods We sequenced the nuclear ribosomal ITS and two plastid regions,
   ndhF and ndhF-rpL32, to infer the origin of Galvezia and patterns of
   colonization to and across the Galapagos archipelago, based on Bayesian
   inference and statistical parsimony analyses. To investigate genetic
   diversity and differentiation within G.leucantha, we screened the genome
   of six populations and obtained 194 AFLP fingerprints. Autogamy tests
   and pollination network analyses were performed to evaluate the
   colonization potential and to investigate the structure of the
   pollinators' assemblage of Galvezia.
   Results Relationships of seven nucleotide-substitution haplotypes and 11
   nucleotide-substitution ribotypes of Galvezia revealed monophyly for the
   Galapagos species. Dating estimates indicated divergence of the insular
   Galvezia lineage in the Middle-Upper Pleistocene (0.66-0.09Ma). In
   addition, distribution of genotypes (seven haplotypes, eight ribotypes)
   across the three continental species showed geographical
   differentiation, while low differentiation and distribution of
   G.leucantha. AFLP genetic diversity is relatively high (H-T=0.109), but
   a low proportion of the total allelic variance is attributed to
   variation among subspecies/islands (H-b=0.035, hierarchical AMOVA:
   3.77\% of total variance). The endemic bee (Xylocopa darwinii) accounted
   for 87.30\% of the floral visits to G.leucantha.
   Main conclusions We inferred a single origin for an insular lineage that
   colonized the Galapagos Islands from northern Peru in the Pleistocene.
   Recent colonization of the archipelago, Pleistocene land bridges between
   islands and active gene flow promoted by X.darwinii may account for the
   low-moderate genetic differentiation of G.leucantha subspecies. An
   unusual pollination shift from ornithophily (hummingbirds on the
   continent) to entomophily (Xylocopa in the Galapagos Islands) is
   supported.}},

Title = {{Generalist social bees maximize diversity intake in plant species-rich
   and resource-abundant environments}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Numerous studies revealed a positive relationship between biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning, suggesting that biodiverse environments may
   not only enhance ecosystem processes, but also benefit individual
   ecosystem members by, for example, providing a higher diversity of
   resources. Whether and how the number of available resources affects
   resource collection and subsequently consumers (e.g., through impacting
   functions associated with resources) have, however, been little
   investigated, although a better understanding of this relationship may
   help explain why the abundance and richness of many animal species
   typically decline with decreasing plant (resource) diversity. Using a
   social bee species as model (Tetragonula carbonaria), we investigated
   how plant species richness-recorded for study sites located in different
   habitats-and associated resource abundance affected the diversity and
   functionality (here defined as nutritional content and antimicrobial
   activity) of resources (i.e., pollen, nectar, and resin) collected by a
   generalist herbivorous consumer. The diversity of both pollen and resin
   collected strongly increased with increasing plant/tree species
   richness, while resource abundance was only positively correlated with
   resin diversity. These findings suggest that bees maximize resource
   diversity intake in (resource) diverse habitats. Collecting more diverse
   resources did, however, not increase their functionality, which appeared
   to be primarily driven by the surrounding (plant) source community in
   our study. In generalist herbivores, maximizing resource diversity
   intake may therefore primarily secure collection of sufficient amounts
   of resources across the entire foraging season, but it also ensures that
   the allocated resources meet all functional needs. Decreasing available
   resource diversity may thus impact consumers primarily by reduced
   resource abundance, but also by reduced resource functionality,
   particularly when resources of high functionality (e.g., from specific
   plant species) become scarce.}},

Abstract = {{The inaccurate I-V curve generation in solar PV modeling introduces less
   efficiency and on the other hand, accurate simulation of PV
   characteristics becomes a mandatory obligation before experimental
   validation. Although many optimization methods in literature have
   attempted to extract accurate PV parameters, all of these methods do not
   guarantee their convergence to the global optimum. Hence, the authors of
   this paper have proposed a new hybrid Bee pollinator Flower Pollination
   Algorithm (BPFPA) for the PV parameter extraction problem. The PV
   parameters for both single diode and double diode are extracted and
   tested under different environmental conditions. For brevity, the
   I.(01), I-02, I-pv for double diode and I-0, I-pv, for single diode
   models are calculated analytically where the remaining parameters `R-s,
   R-p, a(1), a(2)' are optimized using BPFPA method. It is found that, the
   proposed Bee Pollinator method has all the scope to create exploration
   and exploitation in the control variable to yield a less RMSE value even
   under lower irradiated conditions. Further for performance validation,
   the parameters arrived via BPFPA method is compared with Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), Pattern Search (PS), Harmony Search (HS), Flower
   Pollination Algorithm (FPA) and Artificial Bee Swarm Optimization
   (ABSO). In addition, various outcomes of PV modeling and different
   parameters influencing the accurate PV modeling are critically analyzed.

Abstract = {{Physiological and energetic mechanisms have been proposed to constrain
   body sizes of organisms along climatic gradients; however, these provide
   contrasting predictions. While Bergmann's rule predicts increases in
   body sizes in cooler climates resulting from physiological constraints,
   energy-based community assembly rules suggest declines in the mean body
   size of species caused by increased extinction probabilities for
   large-bodied species in low-energy habitats. We tested these contrasting
   hypotheses by quantifying trait distributions in bee communities along a
   36-km elevational gradient at Mt. Kilimanjaro. Traditionally, intra- and
   interspecific trait shifts along environmental gradients have been
   investigated in isolation. However, a surge of theoretical approaches
   and studies on plants demonstrated that the explicit integration of
   trait variation among and within species can be essential for
   identifying the mechanisms that shape traits and related ecosystem
   functions along environmental gradients. We therefore studied variation
   in body size and related morphological traits at both the intra- and
   interspecific level. We found support for both physiological constraints
   and energy-based community assembly rules as drivers of trait
   distribution in bee communities along elevational gradients, which,
   however, affected different levels of biotic organization, that is the
   population and community level. While the number of bee species with
   large body sizes declined with elevation, individuals within species
   became on average larger, resulting in contrasting trends in
   morphometric parameters at the community versus population level.
   Furthermore, body size within bee communities became less variable at
   higher elevations, largely as a result of a non-random, directive loss
   of species, but paralleled by a decline in intraspecific variance,
   suggesting intensified filtering effects with increasing elevation.
   Similar patterns were found for other functional traits related to the
   foraging ecology of bees (tongue length, relative forewing length). We
   conclude that along climatic gradients both physiological and energetic
   constraints shape trait distributions of pollinators, but at different
   levels of biological organization.}},

Abstract = {{Bumblebees are valuable pollinators of numerous wild and cultivated
   plants. They can forage on variable pollen resources. As some pollen
   species lack particular nutrients or have global low nutritional
   quality, it has been suggested that bumblebees mix their pollen incomes
   to ensure a global balanced diet. The hypothesis that a mixed pollen
   diet better supports bumblebee colony development than a single pollen
   diet has been poorly explored.
   We compared the impact of mono-, di- and trifloral diets on microcolony
   development of Bombus terrestris using three pollen resources with
   different nutrient contents (Cytisus scoparius, Erica sp. and Sorbus
   aucuparia) as well as their mixes. Nine parameters (e.g. pollen
   efficacy: total weight of larvae/total weight of pollen collection) were
   used to compare the microcolony performances. Moreover, we measured the
   influence of the pollen diversity and nutritional composition on
   relevant parameters.
   We showed that microcolonies can potentially better develop on mixed
   pollen diets, but single pollen diet can also be as good as mixed pollen
   diet. Moreover, the sterol concentration appeared as a key factor to
   establish the impact of a pollen diet on the bumblebee colony
   development.
   This study reveals that diverse pollen diet does not necessary equate
   with good colony development and supports the importance of selecting
   floral resources by considering their nutrient contents for bee
   conservation management.}},
