EVOL.,"NUPHAR (NYMPHAEACEAE) COMPRISES A SMALL HOLARCTIC GROUP OF AQUATIC PERENNIALS WHOSE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY FLIES, BEES, AND BEETLES. WE STUDIED POLLINATION IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF THE TWO EUROPEAN SPECIES N. LUTEA AND N. PUMILA IN NORWAY AND IN GERMANY. FLOWERS ARE SELF-COMPATIBLE AND PROTOGYNOUS, PREVENTING AUTOMATIC SELFING, AND INSECT POLLINATION IS REQUIRED FOR SEED PRODUCTION. SYMPATRIC POPULATIONS WERE STUDIED IN VEST-AGDER COUNTY IN NORWAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER N. LUTEA AND N. PUMILA HAVE THE SAME OR DIFFERENT POLLINATORS. ALLOPATRIC POPULATIONS OF N.

RESULTS OF THE PRESENT AS WELL AS PREVIOUS STUDIES OF THE POLLINATION OF N. LUTEA AND N.

HANNAH L;DYER AG;GARCIA JE;DORIN A;BURD M,HANNAH L,PSYCHOPHYSICS OF THE HOVERFLY: CATEGORICAL OR CONTINUOUS COLOR DISCRIMINATION?,CURRENT ZOOLOGY,CURR. ZOOL.,"THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN FLIES AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS. FLIES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A COMPLEX VISUAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING 4 SPECTRAL CLASSES OF PHOTORECEPTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERCEPTION OF COLOR. OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW COLOR SIGNALS ARE PERCEIVED BY FLIES IS BASED ON DATA FOR THE BLOWFLY LUCILIA SP., WHICH AFTER BEING CONDITIONED TO REWARDED MONOCHROMATIC LIGHT STIMULI, SHOWED EVIDENCE OF A CATEGORICAL COLOR VISUAL SYSTEM. THE RESULTING OPPONENT FLY COLOR SPACE HAS 4 DISTINCT CATEGORIES, AND HAS BEEN USED TO INTERPRET HOW SOME FLY POLLINATORS MAY PERCEIVE FLOWER COLORS. HOWEVER, FORMAL PROOF THAT FLOWER FLIES (SYRPHIDAE) ONLY USE A SIMPLE, CATEGORICAL COLOR PROCESS REMAINS OUTSTANDING. IN FREE-FLYING EXPERIMENTS, WE TESTED THE HOVERFLY ERISTALIS TENAX, A BATESIAN MIMIC OF THE HONEYBEE, THAT RECEIVES ITS NUTRITION BY VISITING FLOWERS. USING A RANGE OF BROADBAND SIMILAR-DISSIMILAR COLOR STIMULI PREVIOUSLY USED TO TEST COLOR PERCEPTION IN POLLINATING HYMENOPTERAN SPECIES, WE EVALUATED IF THERE ARE STEEP CHANGES IN BEHAVIORAL CHOICES WITH CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING COLOR DIFFERENCES AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED BY CATEGORICAL COLOR PROCESSING. OUR DATA REVEALED THAT COLOR CHOICES BY THE HOVERFLY ARE MEDIATED BY A CONTINUOUS MONOTONIC FUNCTION. THUS, THESE FLIES DID NOT USE A CATEGORICAL PROCESSING, BUT SHOWED EVIDENCE OF A COLOR DISCRIMINATION FUNCTION SIMILAR TO THAT OBSERVED IN SEVERAL BEE SPECIES.

THIS SOLITARY BEE IS THE ONLY REPRESENTATIVE IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE OF THE OLD WORLD GENUS LITHURGUS, AND LIKELY A CONSPECIFIC WITH THE INDO-AUSTRALIAN SPECIES LITHURGUS ATRATUS. L. HUBERI APPEARS TO HAVE REACHED THE CONTINENT AT LEAST 100 YEARS AGO, WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED AND DESCRIBED. BECAUSE THIS SPECIES SEEMS TO BE OLIGOLECTIC ON POLLEN OF CONVOLVULACEAE FLOWERS IN SOUTH AMERICA, WE ATTEMPTED TO INTEGRATE THIS BIOTIC INTERACTION (PLANT-BEE RELATIONSHIPS) TO OUR SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL (SDM) PROCEDURES TO PREDICT ITS POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTH AMERICA. THE MODELED DISTRIBUTION OF SEVEN L. HUBERI'S HOST PLANT SPECIES DID NOT IMPROVE THE ALGORITHMS' ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS DISTRIBUTION, BUT IT PRODUCED CONSTRAINED RANGES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT OUR BIOTIC VARIABLES ARE NOT INDEPENDENT OF THE ABIOTIC VARIABLES USED (MOSTLY RELATED TO CLIMATE). WE EMPLOYED FIVE MODELING ALGORITHMS, ENVELOPE SCORE, GARP, MAHALANOBIS DISTANCE, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES, AND MAXENT, BUT ONLY THE FORMER TWO SHOWED A GOOD PERFORMANCE WHEN PREDICTING THE OCCURRENCE OF BOTH, THE HOST PLANT SPECIES AND L.

BIOL.,"A RECENT ARTICLE PRESENTS A STUDY OF POLLINATOR VISITATION BEHAVIOUR THAT IS USED TO EVALUATE THE SELECTIVE PRESSURE THAT POLLINATOR VISITATION RATE MIGHT HAVE ON THE TIMING OF THE PRODUCTION OF NONREWARDING FLOWERS. HERE WE TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE PAPER THAT THERE SHOULD BE SELECTION PRESSURE FOR NONREWARDING FLOWERS TO BE AVAILABLE EARLIER IN THE SEASON IN ORDER TO AVOID DISSIMILAR SYMPATRIC REWARDING SPECIES. CONSIDERATION OF SELECTION PRESSURE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TEMPORAL VARIATION IN TOTAL POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY, POLLINATOR LONGEVITY AND UNLEARNED RESPONSE, AND THE STABILITY OF PLANT COMMUNITIES OVER TIME, AS WELL AS THE LEARNED RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS THAT THE ORIGINAL STUDY FOCUSED ON. LEARNING ALONE WOULD NOT NECESSARILY SELECT FOR EARLY FLOWERING BY NONREWARDERS IF TEMPORAL VARIATION IN POLLINATOR NUMBERS IS STRONG OR NAIVE POLLINATORS CONSISTENTLY APPEAR THROUGHOUT THE FLOWERING SEASON. FURTHER, WE ARGUE THAT EARLY FLOWERING COULD SIMPLY BE A NATURAL COROLLARY OF LONGEVITY OF FLOWERS NEEDED TO COMBAT NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION AND LOW OVERALL VISITATION RATES BY POLLINATORS, RATHER THAN A TRAIT THAT HAS BEEN SPECIFICALLY SELECTED TO REDUCE TEMPORAL OVERLAP WITH COMPETING REWARDING SPECIES.",DECEPTION OF POLLINATORS; LONGEVITY OF FLOWERS; ORCHIDS; POLLINATION; REWARDLESS FLOWERS; TIMING OF FLOWERS,BUMBLE-BEES; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; ORCHID; DISCRIMINATION; POLLINATION; LONGEVITY; BEHAVIOR; SUCCESS; COLOR; GENE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"RUXTON, GD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GLASGOW, DIV ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, FAC BIOMED \& LIFE SCI, GLASGOW G12 8QQ, LANARK, SCOTLAND.;RUXTON, G.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS FAVOUR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF POLLEN. HOWEVER, LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS ALSO HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS, SUCH AS INCREASED GEITONOGAMY, POLLEN DISCOUNTING AND NECTAR/POLLEN ROBBER ATTRACTION. THE SIZE OF THE FLORAL DISPLAY CAN BE MEASURED AT DIFFERENT SCALES (E.G. THE FLOWER, INFLORESCENCE OR ENTIRE PLANT) AND VARIATIONS IN ONE OF THESE SCALES MAY AFFECT THE BEHAVIOUR OF FLOWER VISITORS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. MOREOVER, THE FRAGMENTATION OF NATURAL FORESTS MAY AFFECT FLOWER VISITATION RATES AND FLOWER VISITOR BEHAVIOUR. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, VIDEO RECORDINGS OF THE INFLORESCENCES OF A TREE SPECIES (TABEBUIA AUREA) FROM THE TROPICAL SAVANNAH OF CENTRAL BRAZIL WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AT THE INFLORESCENCE AND TREE SCALES ON THE VISITATION RATE OF POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS TO THE INFLORESCENCE, THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS APPROACHED PER VISIT, THE NUMBER OF VISITS PER FLOWER OF POTENTIAL POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS, AND THE INTERACTION OF THESE VARIABLES WITH THE DEGREE OF LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCE. NECTAR PRODUCTION WAS QUANTIFIED WITH RESPECT TO FLOWER AGE. ALTHOUGH LARGE BEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE POLLINATION, A GREAT DIVERSITY OF FLOWER INSECTS VISIT THE INFLORESCENCES OF T.AUREA. OTHER BEE AND HUMMINGBIRD SPECIES ARE HIGHLY ACTIVE NECTAR ROBBERS. INCREASES IN INFLORESCENCE SIZE INCREASE THE VISITATION RATE OF POLLINATORS TO INFLORESCENCES, WHEREAS INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES ON THE TREE DECREASE VISITATION RATES TO INFLORESCENCES AND FLOWERS. THIS EFFECT HAS BEEN STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH URBAN ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH TREES WITH THE LARGEST FLORAL DISPLAYS ARE OBSERVED. POLLINATING BEES (AND NECTAR ROBBERS) VISIT FEW FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE AND CONCENTRATE VISITS TO A FRACTION OF AVAILABLE FLOWERS, GENERATING AN OVERDISPERSED DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUMBER OF VISITS PER INFLORESCENCE AND PER FLOWER.

POHL NB;VAN WYK J;CAMPBELL DR,POHL NB,BUTTERFLIES SHOW FLOWER COLOUR PREFERENCES BUT NOT CONSTANCY IN FORAGING AT FOUR PLANT SPECIES,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,ECOL. ENTOMOL.,"1. THE EXTENT TO WHICH FLOWER COLOUR AND OTHER VISUAL CUES INFLUENCE BUTTERFLY FLOWER CHOICE IN THE FIELD IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY IN COMPARISON WITH CHOICES BY HYMENOPTERA. 2. USING A NOVEL APPROACH TO STUDIES OF VISITATION BEHAVIOUR BY BUTTERFLIES, FLOWER COLOUR OF FOUR ASTERACEAE SPECIES WAS PHENOTYPICALLY MANIPULATED TO DECOUPLE THE INFLUENCE OF THAT TRAIT FROM OTHERS (INCLUDING MORPHOLOGY AND NECTAR REWARDS) ON VISITATION BY LYCAENA HETERONEA, SPEYERIA MORMONIA, CERCYONIS OETUS, AND PHYCIODES CAMPESTRIS. 3. FLOWER VISITS WERE RECORDED TO EXPERIMENTAL FLOWER ARRAYS IN SUBALPINE MEADOWS TO MEASURE (I) SPONTANEOUS PREFERENCE BY BUTTERFLIES FOR PARTICULAR COLOURS AND OTHER TRAITS AND (II) FLOWER CONSTANCY (LONGER THAN EXPECTED STRINGS OF VISITS MADE TO FLOWERS OF THE SAME SPECIES), A BEHAVIOUR THAT CAN REDUCE INTERSPECIFIC GENE FLOW IN PLANTS. 4. OVER THREE FIELD SEASONS, 3558 INDIVIDUAL FLOWER VISITS IN 1386 FORAGING BOUTS WERE OBSERVED FOR FREE-FLYING BUTTERFLIES. ALL FOUR BUTTERFLY SPECIES RESPONDED TO THE PHENOTYPIC MANIPULATIONS OF FLOWER COLOUR, ALTHOUGH IN DIFFERENT WAYS. SPEYERIA MORMONIA AND L. HETERONEA ALSO EXHIBITED PREFERENCES BASED ON OTHER FLOWER TRAITS. LYCAENA HETERONEA RESPONDED TO COMBINATIONS OF TRAITS SUCH THAT THE OTHER TRAITS IT PREFERRED DEPENDED UPON THE CONTEXT OF FLOWER COLOUR. 5. NONE OF THE BUTTERFLY SPECIES EXHIBITED FLOWER CONSTANCY IN ANY OF THE ARRAYS EMPLOYED. 6. THE OBSERVED PREFERENCES SHOW THAT BUTTERFLIES, LIKE SOME OTHER POLLINATORS, ARE POTENTIALLY CAPABLE OF EXERTING SELECTION ON COLOUR AND OTHER FLORAL TRAITS. MOREOVER, THESE FLOWER PREFERENCES CAN DEPEND ON THE CONTEXT OF OTHER FLOWER TRAITS.
