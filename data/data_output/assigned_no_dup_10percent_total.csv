ANTENNIFERA (TENTERDEN) AND T. CRINITA (LESMURDIE) RESPECTIVELY. POLLEN-PISTIL INTERACTIONS WERE STUDIED USING GLASSHOUSE COLLECTIONS OF T. CRINITA AND T. MACROPHYLLA AT KPBG. THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE IN T. MACROPHYLLA VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SITES. CLIMATIC CONDITIONS INFLUENCED FLOWER OPENING AND CLOSING REGIMES DIFFERENTLY IN T. CRINITA VS. T. MACROPHYLLA. WHILE ALL THREE THELYMITRA SPECIES OPENED ON WARM, SUNNY MORNINGS AND CLOSED BY LATE AFTERNOON, T. CRINITA AT LESMURDIE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO OPEN ITS PERIANTH SEGMENTS ON COOL DAYS COMPARED TO THE CO-BLOOMING, SYMPATRIC FLOWERS OF T. MACROPHYLLA. THE FLORAL LIFESPANS OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS OF T. MACROPHYLLA AND T. CRINITA WERE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY FOLLOWING APPLICATION OF THELYMITRA POLLEN ONTO THE STIGMATIC SURFACE BUT WERE NOT REDUCED BY POLLINARIUM REMOVAL. FLOWERS OF BOTH SPECIES WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE BUT NEITHER SPECIES SELF-POLLINATED MECHANICALLY (AUTOGAMY). FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY ALSO SHOWED THAT BOTH SPECIES WERE INTER-COMPATIBLE. NATURAL RATES OF POLLINARIUM REMOVAL BY INSECTS WERE LOW IN ALL THREE SPECIES AT BOTH SITES. NATURAL RATES OF POLLEN DEPOSITION ON RECEPTIVE STIGMAS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN T. CRINITA VS. T. MACROPHYLLA BUT POLLEN DEPOSITION WAS LESS THAN 12\% IN BOTH SPECIES. OBSERVATIONS AND COLLECTIONS OF POLLINATORS WERE INFREQUENT AND POLLINARIA VECTORS WERE RESTRICTED TO A FEW POLYLECTIC, FEMALE BEES IN THE FAMILIES APIDAE, COLLETIDAE, AND HALICTIDAE. WE FOUND A LARGE NUMBER OF HYBRIDS BETWEEN T. ANTENNIFERA AND T. MACROPHYLLA AT TENTERDEN BUT FEW OBVIOUS HYBRIDS BETWEEN T. CRINITA AND T. MACROPHYLLA AT LESMURDIE. AS EXPECTED, ALL HYBRIDS SHOWED CHARACTERISTICS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THEIR TWO PUTATIVE PARENT SPECIES, INCLUDING POLLEN CONFIGURATION IN THE T. CRINITA X T. MACROPHYLLA SPECIMENS.

J. BOT.,"THE INVASION OF EXOTIC SPECIES INTO NATURAL HABITATS IS CONSIDERED TO BE A MAJOR THREAT TO BIODIVERSITY, AND MANY STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW EXOTIC PLANTS DIRECTLY AFFECT NATIVE PLANT SPECIES THROUGH COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS FOR ABIOTIC RESOURCES. HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH EXOTICS CAN HAVE POTENTIALLY GREAT ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES, VERY FEW RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF EXOTICS ON THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND THEIR MUTUALISTIC PARTNERS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS, AND NONE HAVE REPORTED ON SUCH IMPACTS IN LOGGED AND UNDISTURBED BOREAL FOREST ECOSYSTEMS. HERE WE SHOW HOW EXPERIMENTAL INTRODUCTIONS OF AN EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES (PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA BENTHAM) AFFECT POLLINATOR VISITATION AND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF A NATIVE PLANT (MELAMPYRUM PRATENSE L.) IN RECENTLY DISTURBED (I.E., LOGGED) AND IN UNDISTURBED BOREAL FOREST HABITATS. THE PRESENCE OF PHACELIA SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BUMBLE BEES ENTERING PLOTS IN BOTH HABITAT TYPES. HOWEVER, THE EXOTIC SPECIES HAD A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE VISITATION RATE TO THE NATIVE SPECIES IN BOTH HABITAT TYPES. DESPITE THIS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON POLLINATOR VISITATION, THE EXOTIC HAD NO EFFECT ON FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE NATIVE SPECIES IN ANY HABITAT.

MODULARITY) OF COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, WE SAMPLED AN INDIVIDUAL-BASED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK BY FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENTS AND FLOWER VISITS OF MARKED BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A POPULATION OF THISTLE PLANTS FOR WHICH THE IDENTITIES AND SPATIAL LOCATIONS OF STEMS WERE MAPPED IN A 50 X 50 M STUDY PLOT. THE PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK WAS DOMINATED BY PARASITIC MALE BUMBLEBEES AND HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY MODULAR STRUCTURE, WITH FOUR IDENTIFIED MODULES BEING CLEARLY SEPARATED IN SPACE. THIS INDICATED THAT INDIVIDUAL FLOWER VISITORS OPTED FOR THE FINE-SCALE DIVISION OF RESOURCES, EVEN WITHIN A LOCAL SITE. HOWEVER, SPATIAL MAPPING OF NETWORK MODULES AND MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS ALSO SHOWED AN OVERLAP IN THE DENSE CENTER OF THE PLANT PATCH. MODEL SELECTION BASED ON AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION WITH TRAITS AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES REVEALED THAT THISTLE STEMS WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF FLOWER HEADS AND MANY CLOSE NEIGHBOURS WERE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE MODULES. IN CONTRAST, TALL PLANTS AND THOSE NEAR THE PATCH CENTER WERE CRUCIAL FOR CONNECTING THE DIFFERENT MODULES TO EACH OTHER. THIS DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUAL-BASED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS ARE INFLUENCED BY BOTH THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF PLANT POPULATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL-SPECIFIC PLANT TRAITS. ADDITIONALLY, BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WITH LONG OBSERVATION TIMES WERE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN AND WITHIN MODULES. THE LATTER SUGGESTS THAT BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL SHOW LOCALLY RESTRICTED MOVEMENTS WITHIN SUB-PATCHES OF PLANT POPULATIONS EVEN IF THEY ARE OBSERVED OVER A PROLONGED TIME PERIOD.

ENTOMOL.,"IMPROVING POLLINATOR HABITAT ON FARMLANDS IS NEEDED TO FURTHER WILD BEE CONSERVATION AND TO SUSTAIN CROP POLLINATION IN LIGHT OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GLOBAL DECLINES IN POLLINATORS AND REDUCTIONS IN FLORAL RESOURCES. ONE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY GAINING MUCH ATTENTION IS THE USE OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS PLANTED ALONGSIDE CROPS TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, FARMER ADOPTION OF POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY STRATEGIES HAS BEEN MINIMAL, LIKELY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PROVIDING NON-CROP FLOWERING PLANTS FOR BEES. OVER 3 YR, ON FOUR DIVERSIFIED FARMS IN MONTANA, UNITED STATES, WE ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC PROFIT OF HARVESTING AND SELLING WILDFLOWER SEEDS COLLECTED FROM FLOWER STRIPS IMPLEMENTED FOR WILD BEE CONSERVATION, AS AN INCENTIVE FOR FARMERS TO ADOPT THIS MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. WE COMPARED THE POTENTIAL PROFITABILITY OF SELLING SMALL RETAIL SEED PACKETS VERSUS BULK WHOLESALE SEED. OUR ECONOMIC ANALYSES INDICATED THAT POTENTIAL REVENUE FROM RETAIL SEED SALES EXCEEDED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING WILDFLOWER STRIPS AFTER THE SECOND GROWING SEASON. A WHOLESALE APPROACH, IN CONTRAST, RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE NET ECONOMIC LOSSES. WE PROVIDE PROOF-OF-CONCEPT THAT, UNDER RETAIL SCENARIOS, THE SALE OF NATIVE WILDFLOWER SEEDS MAY PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC BENEFIT THAT, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, REMAINS UNEXPLORED. THE RETAIL SEED-SALES APPROACH COULD ENCOURAGE GREATER FARMER ADOPTION OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS AS A POLLINATOR-CONSERVATION STRATEGY IN AGROECOSYSTEMS.

JOHNSON SD;PETER CI;AGREN J,JOHNSON SD,THE EFFECTS OF NECTAR ADDITION ON POLLEN REMOVAL AND GEITONOGAMY IN THE NON-REWARDING ORCHID ANACAMPTIS MORIO,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,PROC. R. SOC. B-BIOL. SCI.,"IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF FLORAL REWARDS IN MANY ORCHID SPECIES CAUSES POLLINATORS TO PROBE FEWER FLOWERS ON A PLANT, AND THUS REDUCES GEITONOGAMY, I.E. SELF-POLLINATION BETWEEN FLOWERS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND REDUCED POLLEN EXPORT. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF NECTAR ADDITION ON POLLINATOR VISITATION AND POLLEN TRANSFER BY TRACKING THE FATE OF COLOUR-LABELLED POLLEN IN ANACAMPTIS MONO, A NON-REWARDING ORCHID SPECIES POLLINATED PRIMARILY BY QUEEN BUMBLE-BEES. ADDITION OF NECTAR TO SPURS OF A. MORIO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED BY BUMBLE-BEES, THE TIME SPENT ON AN INFLORESCENCE, POLLINARIUM REMOVAL AND THE PROPORTION OF REMOVED POLLEN INVOLVED IN SELF-POLLINATION THROUGH GEITONOGAMY, BUT DID NOT AFFECT POLLEN CARRYOVER (THE FRACTION OF A POLLINARIUM CARRIED OVER FROM ONE FLOWER TO THE NEXT). ONLY VISITS THAT EXCEEDED 18 S RESULTED IN GEITONOGAMY, AS THIS IS THE TIME TAKEN FOR REMOVED POLLINARIA TO BEND INTO A POSITION TO STRIKE THE STIGMA. A MUTATION FOR NECTAR PRODUCTION IN A. MORIO WOULD RESULT IN AN INITIAL 3.8-FOLD INCREASE IN POLLINARIUM REMOVAL PER VISIT, BUT ALSO INCREASE GEITONOGAMOUS SELF-POLLINATION FROM LESS THAN 10\% OF POLLEN DEPOSITIONS TO CA. 40\%. GREATER EFFICIENCY OF POLLEN EXPORT WILL FAVOUR DECEPTIVE PLANTS WHEN POLLINATORS ARE RELATIVELY COMMON AND MOST POLLINARIA ARE REMOVED FROM FLOWERS OR WHEN INBREEDING DEPRESSION IS SEVERE.

I EXAMINED POLLEN FROM MALE FLOWERS, ASPIRATED INSECTS LANDING ON FEMALE FLOWERS, AND COUNTED POLLEN GRAINS IN INSECT POLLEN LOADS. DESERT MISTLETOE'S TRICOLPATE POLLEN DIFFERED FROM A PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION BY BEING OBLATE INSTEAD OF SUBPROLATE IN EQUATORIAL VIEW.

THE SIZE OF SURVEYED ISLANDS RANGES BETWEEN 0.75 AND 41.32 HA, THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE COAST OF JAVA VARIES BETWEEN 3 AND 62 KM. METHODS FIELD WORK WAS CONDUCTED FROM FEBRUARY TO MAY 2005. BEES AND WASPS WERE CAUGHT WITH A SWEEP NET DURING SAMPLING UNITS OF 15 MIN, CONTINUING UNTIL FOUR CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES REVEALED NO NEW SPECIES. TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS QUANTIFIED BY THE ESTIMATORS CHAO 2, FIRST-ORDER JACKKNIFE AND MICHAELIS-MENTEN. THE SOFTWARE BINMATNEST WAS USED TO TEST FOR NESTEDNESS OF SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES. SIMILARITIES OF SPECIES COMPOSITION BETWEEN ISLANDS WERE QUANTIFIED BY S CIRCLE DIVIDE RENSEN'S SIMILARITY INDEX. RESULTS EIGHTY-TWO SPECIES WERE RECORDED ON THE 20 SURVEYED ISLANDS. SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINED WITH INCREASING ISOLATION OF ISLANDS FROM THE SOURCE AREA, JAVA. ALTHOUGH THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST ISLAND EXCEEDED THAT OF THE SMALLEST ISLAND BY A FACTOR OF ALMOST 60, ISLAND SIZE ONLY VERY WEAKLY AFFECTED SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEES, NO EFFECT OF ISLAND SIZE WAS FOUND FOR WASPS.

MAIN CONCLUSIONS WHILE THE SPECIES-ISOLATION RELATIONSHIP ON THE VERY SMALL ISLANDS OF KEPULAUAN SERIBU FOLLOWED THE PREDICTION OF MACARTHUR AND WILSON'S EQUILIBRIUM THEORY, THE ABSENCE OF A SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIP INDICATED A WEAK `SMALL-ISLAND EFFECT', AT LEAST IN WASPS. THE COMBINATION OF AN ONLY WEAKLY DEVELOPED PATTERN OF NESTED SPECIES SUBSETS, THE SHIFT IN SPECIES COMPOSITIONS AND THE DECLINE OF MEAN BODY SIZE WITH INCREASING ISLAND ISOLATION FROM THE SOURCE AREA INDICATES THAT BIOTIC INTERACTIONS AND DIFFERENT SPECIES TRAITS CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHAPING OF COMMUNITIES OF BEES AND WASPS WITHIN THE ARCHIPELAGO.

WE ESTIMATED THAT A MONITORING PROGRAM WITH 200250 SAMPLING LOCATIONS EACH SAMPLED TWICE OVER 5 YEARS WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT POWER TO DETECT SMALL (25\%) ANNUAL DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND IN TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND WOULD COST U.S.\$2,000,000. TO DETECT DECLINES AS SMALL AS 1\% ANNUALLY OVER THE SAME PERIOD WOULD REQUIRE >300 SAMPLING LOCATIONS.

THE NECTAR HAS TWO DISTINCT SMELLS, ONE OF HONEY, WHICH ATTRACTS BEES, AND ONE OF ROTTING MATERIAL, WHICH ATTRACTS FLIES. THE ANTHERS CONTAINED AMPLE FERTILE POLLEN, APRE-REQUISITE FOR EFFECTIVE POLLINATION, BUT ALSO FOR SOLITARY BEES, WHO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME COLLECTING POLLEN, WHICH IS MIXED WITH ASMALL AMOUNT OF NECTAR AS FOOD SUPPLY FOR THEIR YOUNG. IN THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT, SORBUST. POLLINATION WAS BY BUMBLE BEES, HONEY BEES, SOLITARY BEES, EXCEPT FOR THE SOLITARY OSMIA BEES, POSSIBLY DUE TO LACK OF NESTING STRUCTURES. 3)A LOCAL POLLINATION EXPERIMENT IN THE BONN REGION SHOWED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SEEDS PER FRUIT, AS AMEASURE OF THE POLLINATION SUCCESS, WITH MANUAL CROSS-POLLINATION. THE POLLINATION SUCCESS RATE OF THE FREE BLOOMING CONTROL FLOWERS, TO WHICH THE FLOWER VISITORS HAD FREE ACCESS, WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION.

WE TESTED BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS IN RESTORED PRAIRIE VERSUS THE DOMINANT HABITATS OF THE REGION-CROPS, FOREST REMNANTS, AND EDGES OF FIELDS AND ROADS. RESTORED PRAIRIE SUPPORTED 2X MORE SPECIES (95 OF 119 TOTAL SPECIES) AND 3X MORE BEES (72\% OF CAPTURED INDIVIDUALS) COMPARED TO THE OTHER COVER TYPES. ALL RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DIFFERENCES AMONG HABITAT TYPES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FLORAL RESOURCES IN RESTORED PRAIRIE. THIRTY PERCENT OF THE BEE SPECIES WERE UNIQUE TO PRAIRIE, CONSISTENT WITH LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL BUT BEGGING THE QUESTION OF ORIGIN GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF PRAIRIE REGIONALLY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ROAD AND FIELD EDGES MAY BE THE SOURCE, AS THESE AREAS HAD MORE FLORAL AND NESTING RESOURCES THAN FOREST OR CROP FIELDS COMBINED AND SUPPORTED 55\% OF ALL SPECIES DESPITE COVERING ONLY APPROXIMATELY 5\% OF THE SAMPLED FARMS. HABITAT SCARCITY IS NOT THE ONLY CONSTRAINT ON NATIVE BEES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, WITH INCREASING CONCERN OVER DISEASE AND CHEMICALS. HOWEVER, WE OBSERVED THAT RESTORED AREAS ON MARGINAL LANDS OF CONVENTIONAL FARMS CAN SUPPORT ABUNDANT AND SPECIES-RICH POPULATIONS OF NATIVE BEES.",CONVENTIONAL FARMS; FLOWERING RESOURCES; NATIVE POLLINATORS; NESTING RESOURCES; TALLGRASS PRAIRIE,HEDGEROW RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NESTING RESOURCES; CROP POLLINATION; HABITAT LOSS; DIVERSITY; LANDSCAPE; FOREST; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"MACDOUGALL, AS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GUELPH, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, GUELPH, ON N1G 2W1, CANADA.;PATERSON, CAITLIN, COTTENIE, KARL, MACDOUGALL, ANDREW S., UNIV GUELPH, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, GUELPH, ON N1G 2W1, CANADA.",10.1111/REC.12987,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,1061-2971,6,1291-1299,WILEY,27,2019,ISI000495415900014,63,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,13,ECOLOGY,ASMUOGUELPH.CA,JL3FF,"MACDOUGALL, AS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GUELPH, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, GUELPH, ON N1G 2W1, CANADA",ISI,none,UNIV GUELPH,UNIV GUELPH,NA,"PATERSON C, 2019, RESTOR ECOL","PATERSON C, 2019, RESTOR ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,John M

CHEM.,"HONEYBEES ARE THE STANDARD INSECT TEST SPECIES USED FOR TOXICITY TESTING OF PESTICIDES ON NONTARGET INSECTS FOR THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (U.S. EPA) UNDER THE FEDERAL INSECTICIDE FUNGICIDE AND RODENTICIDE ACT (FIERA). BUTTERFLIES ARE ANOTHER IMPORTANT INSECT ORDER AND A VALUED ECOLOGICAL RESOURCE IN POLLINATION. THE CURRENT STUDY CONDUCTED ACUTE TOXICITY TESTS WITH NALED, PERMETHRIN, AND DICHLORVOS ON FIFTH LARVAL INSTAR (CATERPILLARS) AND ADULTS OF DIFFERENT NATIVE FLORIDA, USA, BUTTERFLY SPECIES TO DETERMINE MEDIAN LETHAL DOSES (24-H LD50), BECAUSE LIMITED ACUTE TOXICITY DATA ARE AVAILABLE WITH THIS MAJOR INSECT GROUP. THORAX- AND WING-ONLY APPLICATIONS OF EACH INSECTICIDE WERE CONDUCTED. BASED ON LD50S, THORAX AND WING APPLICATION EXPOSURES WERE ACUTELY TOXIC TO BOTH CATERPILLARS AND ADULTS. PERMETHRIN WAS THE MOST ACUTELY TOXIC INSECTICIDE AFTER THORAX EXPOSURE TO FIFTH INSTARS AND ADULT BUTTERFLIES. HOWEVER, NO GENERALIZATION ON ACUTE TOXICITY (SENSITIVITY) OF THE INSECTICIDES COULD BE CONCLUDED BASED ON EXPOSURES TO FIFTH INSTARS VERSUS ADULT BUTTERFLIES OR ON THORAX VERSUS WING EXPOSURES OF ADULT BUTTERFLIES. A COMPARISON OF LD50S OF THE BUTTERFLIES FROM THIS STUDY (CATERPILLARS AND ADULTS) WITH HONEYBEE LD50S FOR THE ADULT MOSQUITO INSECTICIDES ON A MU G/ORGANISM OR MU G/G BASIS INDICATES THAT SEVERAL BUTTERFLY SPECIES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THESE INSECTICIDES THAN ARE HONEYBEES. A COMPARISON OF SPECIES SENSITIVITY DISTRIBUTIONS FOR ALL THREE INSECTICIDES SHOWS THAT PERMETHRIN HAD THE LOWEST 10TH PERCENTILE. USING A HAZARD QUOTIENT APPROACH INDICATES THAT BOTH PERMETHRIN AND NALED APPLICATIONS IN THE FIELD MAY PRESENT POTENTIAL ACUTE HAZARDS TO BUTTERFLIES, WHEREAS NO ACUTE HAZARD OF DICHLORVOS IS APPARENT IN BUTTERFLIES.

URBAN GREEN.,"URBAN SPECIES AND HABITATS PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS SUMMERTIME COOLING, RECREATION, AND POLLINATION AT A VARIETY OF SCALES. MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED HOW BIODIVERSITY RESPONDS TO URBANIZATION, BUT LITTLE WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO TRY AND CREATE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE EASILY APPLIED TO URBAN PLANNING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. URBAN PLANNING OFTEN OPERATES AT BROAD SPATIAL SCALES, TYPICALLY USING RELATIVELY SIMPLISTIC TARGETS FOR LAND-COVER MIX TO INFLUENCE BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION. WOULD MORE COMPLICATED, BUT STILL EASILY CREATED, PRESCRIPTIONS FOR URBAN VEGETATION BE BENEFICIAL? HERE WE ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF VEGETATION MEASURES (PERCENTAGE VEGETATION COVER, TREE CANOPY COVER AND VARIATION IN CANOPY HEIGHT) ACROSS FOUR TAXONOMIC GROUPS (BATS, BEES, HOVERFLIES AND BIRDS) AT MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES (100, 250, 500, 1000 M) WITHIN A MAJOR URBAN AREA (BIRMINGHAM, THE UNITED KINGDOM). WE FOUND THAT SMALL-SCALE (100-250-M RADIUS) MEASURES OF VEGETATION WERE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS FOR HOVERFLIES AND BEES, AND THAT BATS WERE SENSITIVE TO VEGETATION AT A MEDIUM SPATIAL-SCALE (250-500 M). IN CONTRAST, BIRDS RESPONDED TO VEGETATION CHARACTERISTICS AT BOTH SMALL (100 M) AND LARGE (1000 M) SCALES.

THEY HAVE PROTOGYNOUS HERMAPHRODITIC FLOWERS, WITH EXCEPTION OF UVARIOPSIS SPECIES, WHICH ARE MONOECIOUS. FUSED PETALS OF ISOLONA CAMPANULATA REMAIN APICALLY SPREADING AND OPEN DURING ANTHESIS BUT FORM A DEEP BASAL URCEOLATE TUBE AROUND THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. AT ANTHESIS THE YELLOW PENDENT FLOWERS EMIT A FRUIT-LIKE SCENT AND ATTRACTED SMALL BEETLES, THE LIKELY POLLINATORS. PIPTOSTIGMA SP. FLOWERS ALSO EMIT A FRUIT-LIKE SCENT BUT PROVIDE A CLOSED POLLINATION CHAMBER FORMED BY THE THREE INNER PETALS. SMALL STAPHYLINID BEETLES ATTRACTED DURING THE FEMALE STAGE OF ANTHESIS ARE RELEASED FROM THE FLOWERS AT THE END OF THE MALE STAGE 2-3 DAYS LATER. BOTH SPECIES HAVE DIURNAL ANTHESIS, ATTRACTING AND RELEASING THE FLOWER VISITORS DURING DAYTIME. IN CONTRAST, UVARIODENDRON CON NIVENS AND U. CALOPHYLLUM HAVE NOCTURNAL ANTHESIS WITH FLORAL THERMOGENESIS, PRODUCE SPICY, AROMATIC AND FRUITY SCENTS AND ATTRACT LARGE SCARABAEIDAE BEETLES, THE POLLINATORS, ALONG WITH MANY CURCULIONID BEETLES, WHICH WERE PRINCIPALLY PREDATORS OF THE THICK PETALS. THE VERY LARGE FLOWERS OF MONODORA TENUIFOLIA HAVE YELLOWISH PETALS WHICH ARE SPOTTED WITH DARK RED MARKINGS. TOGETHER WITH THE SWEETISH, SLIGHTLY DISAGREEABLE SCENT THE FLOWERS ATTRACT FLIES, PRINCIPALLY DUNG FLIES. THE TWO INVESTIGATED UVARIOPSIS SPECIES ARE MONOECIOUS WITH PISTILLATE AND STAMINATE FLOWERS BEING FUNCTIONAL AT THE SAME TIME. THE VIOLET RED FLOWERS OF U. BAKERIANA VISUALLY SEEM TO MIMIC THE FRUITING BODY OF CERTAIN STINKHORN FUNGI (PHALLACEAE) ALTHOUGH WITHOUT PRODUCING THEIR STRONG UNPLEASANT CARCASS STENCH. FLOWER-VISITING DUNG FLIES WERE RARE. CONVERSELY, U. CONGOLANA HAS A STRONG FUNGUS-LIKE SCENT, ITS FLOWERS ARE PRESENTED AT LITTER HEIGHT AND DUNG FLIES LIVING IN THE LITTER WERE THE FLOWER VISITORS, ALBEIT SPORADIC. THE 4-5 DAYS LASTING ANTHESIS OF BOTH UVARIOPSIS SPECIES APPEARS TO BE AN EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DIFFUSE POLLINATOR SPECTRA.

OUR AIMS WERE TO IDENTIFY THE LEGITIMATE POLLINATOR OF PETUNIA SECRETA, A RARE AND ENDEMIC SPECIES, AND TO ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF FLORAL TRAITS IN POLLINATOR ATTRACTION IN THIS PETUNIA SPECIES. TO DETERMINE THE LEGITIMATE POLLINATOR, FIELD OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED, AND ALL FLORAL VISITORS WERE RECORDED AND EVALUATED. WE ALSO MEASURED THE NECTAR VOLUME AND SUGAR CONCENTRATION. TO CHARACTERIZE MORPHOLOGICAL CUES FOR POLLINATORS, WE ASSESSED THE ULTRAVIOLET (UV)-LIGHT RESPONSE IN DETACHED FLOWERS, AND CHARACTERIZED THE FLORAL PIGMENTS AND POLLEN VOLATILE SCENTS FOR FOUR DIFFERENT PETUNIA SPECIES THAT PRESENT DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES. PETUNIA SECRETA SHARES THE MOST RECENT ANCESTOR WITH A WHITE HAWKMOTH-POLLINATED SPECIES, P. AXILLARIS, BUT PRESENTS FLAVONOLS AND ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PINK COROLLA COLOUR AND UV-LIGHT RESPONSES THAT ARE COMMON TO BEE-POLLINATED PETUNIA SPECIES. OUR STUDY SHOWED THAT A SOLITARY BEE IN THE GENUS PSEUDAGAPOSTEMON WAS THE MOST FREQUENT POLLINATOR OF P. SECRETA, AND THESE BEES COLLECT ONLY POLLEN AS A REWARD. DESPITE BEING MAINLY BEE-POLLINATED, DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF POLLINATORS VISIT P. SECRETA.

NAT.,"FORAGING IS AN ESSENTIAL PROCESS FOR MOBILE ANIMALS, AND ITS OPTIMIZATION SERVES AS A FOUNDATIONAL THEORY IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION, HOWEVER, DRIVERS OF FORAGING ARE RARELY INVESTIGATED ACROSS LANDSCAPES AND SEASONS. USING A COMMON BUMBLEBEE SPECIES FROM THE WESTERN UNITED STATES (BOMBUS VOSNESENSKII), WE ASK WHETHER SEASONAL DECREASES IN FOOD RESOURCES PROMPT CHANGES IN FORAGING BEHAVIOR AND SPACE USE. WE EMPLOY A UNIQUE INTEGRATION OF POPULATION GENETIC TOOLS AND SPATIALLY EXPLICIT FORAGING MODELS TO ESTIMATE FORAGING DISTANCES AND RATES OF PATCH VISITATION FOR WILD BUMBLEBEE COLONIES ACROSS THREE STUDY REGIONS AND TWO SEASONS. BY MAPPING THE LOCATIONS OF 669 WILD-CAUGHT INDIVIDUAL FORAGERS, WE FIND SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN COLONY-LEVEL FORAGING DISTANCES, OFTEN EXHIBITING A 60-FOLD DIFFERENCE WITHIN A STUDY REGION. OUR ANALYSIS OF VISITATION RATES INDICATES THAT FORAGERS DISPLAY A PREFERENCE FOR DESTINATION PATCHES WITH HIGH FLORAL COVER AND FORAGE SIGNIFICANTLY FARTHER FOR THESE PATCHES, BUT ONLY IN THE SUMMER, WHEN LANDSCAPE-LEVEL RESOURCES ARE LOW. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF LONG-DISTANCE FORAGING BOUTS TAKE PLACE IN THE SUMMER. BECAUSE WILD BEES ARE POLLINATORS, THEIR FORAGING DYNAMICS ARE OF URGENT CONCERN, GIVEN THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON THEIR MOVEMENT AND SERVICES.

THREE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF BEES' NECTAR-FORAGING PATTERNS ARE THE MAXIMUM DEPTH AT WHICH NECTAR IS ACCESSIBLE (DEPENDENT ON BEE TONGUE LENGTH), THE MINIMUM PROFITABLE ENERGY CONTENT PER FLOWER (DEPENDENT ON FORAGING COSTS AND HENCE ON BEE BODY MASS), AND THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD TEMPERATURE FOR FLIGHT. THESE FORM THE AXES OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL TEMPLATE, THE COMPETITION BOX. 2. THRESHOLDS OF DEPTH, COST AND TEMPERATURE CAN BE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH SPECIES OF BEE, DELIMITING DOMAINS WITHIN THE BOX COMPATIBLE WITH FORAGING BY EACH BEE SPECIES. 3. CHANGES THROUGH A DAY IN TEMPERATURE AND IN THE DEPTH AND SUGAR CONTENT OF NECTAR DEFINE THE NECTAR TRAJECTORY THROUGH THE BOX FOR A FLOWER SPECIES IN RELATION TO MICROCLIMATE AND BEE ACTIVITY. 4. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS SYSTEMATIC APPRAISAL OF THE ROLES OF ACCESSIBILITY, ENERGY CONTENT AND TEMPERATURE IN INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AMONG BEES FOR NECTAR, AND DRAWS ATTENTION TO SITUATIONS IN WHICH ADDITIONAL FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT. 5. BY SUPERIMPOSING A BEE-SPECIES-SPECIFIC TEMPLATE ON A REPRESENTATIVE NECTAR TRAJECTORY FOR A GIVEN FLOWER SPECIES IN A GIVEN SITUATION, IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE REASONED GUESSES ABOUT THE EXPECTED INTERACTIONS OF FORAGING BEE SPECIES WITH A NOVEL FLOWER SPECIES AND WITH EACH OTHER IN A NOVEL SITUATION.

ARTIFICIAL NECTAR ROBBING DID NOT INCREASE NECTAR PRODUCTION OR CONCENTRATION, DID NOT AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF LONG-BILLED HUMMINGBIRDS, AND WHEN FACED WITH ARTIFICIALLY ROBBED FLOWERS, THESE VISITORS BEHAVED AS SECONDARY NECTAR ROBBERS. THE NUMBER OF STIGMAS WITHIN A PATCH THAT RECEIVED POLLEN DYE ANALOGS AND THE AVERAGE DISTANCE TRAVELED BY THESE ANALOGS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN ROBBING TREATMENTS (ROBBED FLOWERS VERSUS UNROBBED FLOWERS), BUT THE MAXIMUM DISTANCE TRAVELED BY THESE POLLEN ANALOGS WAS HIGHER WHEN NECTAR ROBBING WAS NOT PREVENTED.

THE CASE OF A BRAZILIAN HISTORICAL CITY,NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY,NEOTROP. ENTOMOL.,"RETENTION OF HABITAT FRAGMENTS WITHIN THE URBAN MATRIX CAN PROVIDE CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY WHILE STILL PROVIDING SOCIO-ECONOMIC VALUE. EUGLOSSINI BEES ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN A COMMUNITY AS THEY ARE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS FOR ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE PLANTS AS WELL AS HUNDREDS OF ORCHID SPECIES. HOWEVER, SOME SPECIES ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS LIKE URBANIZATION. THIS STUDY PRESENTS THE ROLE OF ANTIQUE URBAN FRAGMENTS IN A HISTORICAL CITY IN BRAZIL AND COMPARES IT WITH A CONSERVATION AREA ON THE ASPECTS OF ORCHID BEE ASSEMBLAGE, SUCH AS RICHNESS, COMPOSITION, AND ABUNDANCE. FOUR FRAGMENTS INSIDE THE CITY OF OURO PRETO AND THREE INSIDE PARQUE ESTADUAL DO ITACOLOMI (PEIT) WERE SAMPLED FOR EUGLOSSINI BEES. SORENSEN SIMILARITY INDEX WAS USED TO COMPARE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THE MANTEL TEST WAS APPLIED TO VERIFY THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AN URBAN CENTER IS A BARRIER FOR THE MOBILITY OF THE INDIVIDUALS. FOURTEEN EUGLOSSINI SPECIES FROM THE REGION WERE REGISTERED. CLOSE TO 75\% OF THE SAMPLED BEES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE PEIT SAMPLING AREAS. THE FRAGMENTS PRESENTED DIFFERENCES IN EUGLOSSINI RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. A MAJORITY OF THE SAMPLED FRAGMENTS WERE DOMINATED BY THE EULAEMA CINGULATA FABRICIUS, EULAEMA NIGRITA LEPELETIER, AND EUGLOSSA SECURIGERA DRESSLER SPECIES. WE FOUND DIFFERENCES ON COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BETWEEN THE FRAGMENTS LOCALIZED IN PEIT AND THOSE LOCATED IN THE URBAN CENTER. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A POSSIBLE FLUX OF INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE SAMPLED FRAGMENTS.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS PLANT SPECIES DIFFER GREATLY IN THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THEIR FLOWERS (INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE). HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF SELECTION RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIVERSITY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. STUDIES THAT EXAMINE AMONG-SPECIES VARIATION SUGGEST THAT INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE AFFECTS POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, AND SO SHOULD INFLUENCE PLANT MATING. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF WITHIN-POPULATION ARCHITECTURAL VARIATION FOR POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR. METHODS WE MANIPULATED INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE OF DELPHINIUM GLAUCUM TO CONTRAST BUMBLEBEE RESPONSES TO NORMAL AND ONE-SIDED (SECUND) INFLORESCENCES. KEY RESULTS THE `DIMENSIONALITY' OF MANIPULATED INFLORESCENCES DID NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS THAT BEES VISITED, HOWEVER, BEES MOVED UPWARD PROPORTIONALLY MORE ON SECUND INFLORESCENCES. CONCLUSIONS THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT REALISTIC WITHIN-POPULATION VARIATION IN INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE CAN MANIPULATE POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR.

ENTOMOL.,"MEANINGFUL ECOLOGICAL STUDIES ON INSECT COMMUNITIES REQUIRE SAMPLING PROTOCOLS THAT TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION TEMPORAL FLUCTUATIONS IN ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES COMPOSITION. BEES WITH THEIR SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR NUTRITION AND NESTING ARE GOOD INDICATORS OF LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND OVERALL BIODIVERSITY, PROVIDED THE ECOLOGICAL AND SEASONAL PATTERNS THEY SHOW ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THE PRESENT TWO YEAR STUDY TRACED THE ECOLOGICAL AND SEASONAL PATTERNS ON 2 KM(2) OF A SOUTHERN SLOPE IN THE SWISS ALPS, RANGING FROM 1150 TO 1550 IN ABOVE SEA LEVEL. THE STUDY AREA CONSISTED MAINLY OF GRASSLAND UNDER DIFFERENT REGIMES, MOSTLY HAY MEADOWS AND PASTURES. BY DIRECT NETTING AT FIVE MONTHLY INTERVALS IN EACH YEAR A TOTAL OF 247 BEE SPECIES WERE RECORDED. THIS COMPREHENSIVE SAMPLING SCHEME IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE BEE FAUNAS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN EUROPE, CONSISTING OF A STATISTICALLY ESTIMATED 280 SPECIES. MOST SPECIES WERE RARE WITH 14.6\% REPRESENTED BY A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE BEE COMMUNITY SHOWED THAT THE PRIMITIVELY EUSOCIAL SPECIES WERE OVER REPRESENTED AMONG THE ABUNDANT SPECIES AND THE PARASITIC SPECIES AMONG THE RAREST. BOTH ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE SUBJECT TO MARKED SEASONAL VARIATIONS. A SUBSTANTIAL TURNOVER IN SPECIES COMPOSITION AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECOLOGICAL PATTERNS WERE OBSERVED. MORE THAN 25\% OF ALL SPECIES WERE RECORDED IN ONLY ONE OF THE TWO YEARS, IN PARTICULAR MANY OF THE PARASITIC SPECIES. SINGLETONS ACCOUNTED FOR A HIGHER PROPORTION WHEN INDIVIDUAL YEARS RATHER THAN THE POOLED DATA WERE ANALYSED.

HERE, WE DETERMINE HOW THE SPECIALIZATION OF MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS VARIES WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AND ASSESS HOW THEY RESPOND TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ALIEN HONEYBEE. WE ALSO COMPARE NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS (CONNECTANCE, SPECIALIZATION AND NESTEDNESS) BETWEEN AN INVADED LOW MOUNTAIN AND NON-INVADED HIGH MOUNTAIN NETWORK.

METHODSWE QUANTIFIED BEE-PLANT INTERACTIONS IN 42 PLOTS BETWEEN APRIL AND JULY 2013 AND CREATED VISITATION NETWORKS FOR THE LOW MOUNTAINS (BEEHIVES PRESENT) AND THE HIGH MOUNTAINS (BEEHIVES ABSENT). WE THEN COMPARED VISITATION NETWORK METRICS BETWEEN RANGE-RESTRICTED, REGIONALLY DISTRIBUTED AND WIDESPREAD PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AND ASSESSED TOPOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LOW AND HIGH MOUNTAIN NETWORKS. RESULTSRANGE-RESTRICTED BEES WERE INVOLVED IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF TOTAL INTERACTIONS THAN REGIONAL AND WIDESPREAD NATIVE BEES, BUT SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF INCREASED GENERALIZATION. IN CONTRAST, RANGE-RESTRICTED PLANTS WERE INVOLVED IN FEWER INTERACTIONS AND EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPECIALIZATION AND A HIGH DEPENDENCY ON RANGE-RESTRICTED POLLINATORS. THE INTRODUCED HONEYBEE ACTED AS A SUPER-GENERALIST AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN NETWORK-LEVEL GENERALIZATION AND NESTEDNESS. HONEYBEES EXHIBITED HIGH LEVELS OF RESOURCE OVERLAP WITH RANGE-RESTRICTED BEES AND MADE FEW VISITS TO RANGE-RESTRICTED PLANT SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONSRANGE-RESTRICTED PLANTS ARE MORE SPECIALIZED IN THEIR INTERACTIONS THAN RANGE-RESTRICTED POLLINATORS, SUGGESTING THAT THE FORCES SHAPING THE STRUCTURE OF INTERACTION NETWORK CAN VARY BETWEEN PARTNERS.

ACCORDINGLY, WE MEASURED, FOR 49 SPECIES OF PENSTEMON AND CLOSE RELATIVES, BOTH THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE FLOWERS AND VISITATION BY POLLINATORS. WE DESCRIBE THE MECHANICS OF POLLINATION FOR REPRESENTATIVE SPECIES. ORDINATIONS SHOW A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES AND HYMENOPTERAN-POLLINATED SPECIES. FLOWER COLOR IS PARTICULARLY GOOD AT SEPARATING HUMMINGBIRD- FROM HYMENOPTERAN-FLOWERS. OTHER CHARACTERS ARE ALSO CORRELATED WITH THIS DICHOTOMY. WITHIN THE HYMEN OPTERAN-POLLINATED SPECIES, THERE ARE ADDITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND THE SIZE OF THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS. FLOWERS FREQUENTED BY LARGE BEES, SUCH AS XYLOCOPA, HAVE LARGE OPEN VESTIBULES AND RELATIVELY SHORT FLORAL TUBES. FLOWERS FREQUENTED BY SMALLER BEES, SUCH AS OSMIA, HAVE LONG NARROW FLORAL TUBES. UNLIKE NECTAR-COLLECTING BEES, POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES TEND TO BE ATTRACTED TO FLOWERS OF THE HUMMINGBIRD SYNDROME. THE OVERARCHING PATTERN WAS THAT SYNDROME CHARACTERIZATIONS WERE SUCCESSFUL AT PREDICTING POLLINATION BY HUMMINGBIRDS VERSUS HYMENOPTERA, TWO TYPES OF ANIMALS THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY DIFFERENT, BUT LESS SUCCESSFUL AT PREDICTING VISITATION BY ONE KIND OF BEE VERSUS ANOTHER.",NA,FLORAL VISITORS; DALECHAMPIA BLOSSOMS; SOUTHERN AFRICA; FLY POLLINATION; SCROPHULARIACEAE; HUMMINGBIRD; SYSTEMS; FLOWERS; EVOLUTION; CONVERGENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,111,"WILSON, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE, DEPT BIOL, NORTHRIDGE, CA 91330 USA.;CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE, DEPT BIOL, NORTHRIDGE, CA 91330 USA.;UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ZOOL, TORONTO, ON M5S 3G5, CANADA.;ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;UNIV ALASKA, INST ARCTIC BIOL, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA.;UNIV PORTSMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PORTSMOUTH PO1 2DY, HANTS, ENGLAND.",10.1111/J.0030-1299.2004.12819.X,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,2,345-361,BLACKWELL MUNKSGAARD,104,2004,ISI000188848900012,84,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,60,ECOLOGY,PAUL.WILSONCSUN.EDU,772NV,"WILSON, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE, DEPT BIOL, NORTHRIDGE, CA 91330 USA",ISI,none,CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE;UNIV TORONTO;ROCKY MT BIOL LABS;UNIV ALASKA;UNIV PORTSMOUTH,CALIF STATE UNIV NORTHRIDGE,NA,"WILSON P, 2004, OIKOS","WILSON P, 2004, OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

IN CONTRAST, POLLINATOR AND FLOWERING PLANT ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY GRAZING. FLOWERING PLANT AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DID DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SHRUBSTEPPE HABITATS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT GRASSLANDS IN NORTH AMERICA, WHEN MANAGED RESPONSIBLY, CAN MAINTAIN POLLINATOR AND FLOWERING PLANT DIVERSITY UNDER GRAZING PRESSURE.

NAT.,"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS FOR MULTIHOST PATHOGEN SYSTEMS OFTEN CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS TAXONOMICALLY AND USE SPECIES-SPECIFIC PARAMETER VALUES, BUT IN SPECIES-RICH COMMUNITIES THAT APPROACH MAY REQUIRE INTRACTABLY MANY PARAMETERS. TRAIT-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS OFFER A POTENTIAL SOLUTION BUT HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR WITHIN-SPECIES TRAIT VARIATION OR BETWEEN-SPECIES TRAIT OVERLAP. HERE WE PROPOSE AND STUDY TRAIT-BASED MODELS WITH HOST AND VECTOR COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED AS TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO SPECIES IDENTITY. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH, WE DEVELOP SUSCEPTIBLE-INFECTIOUS-SUSCEPTIBLE MODELS FOR DISEASE SPREAD IN PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS WITH CONTINUOUS TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS. WE MODEL TRAIT-DEPENDENT CONTACT RATES IN TWO COMMON SCENARIOS: NESTED NETWORKS AND SPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS BASED ON TRAIT MATCHING. WE FIND THAT DISEASE SPREAD IN PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS IS IMPACTED THE MOST BY SELECTIVE POLLINATORS, UNIVERSALLY ATTRACTIVE FLOWERS, AND COSPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR PAIRS. WHEN EXTREME POLLINATOR TRAITS ARE RARE, POLLINATORS WITH COMMON TRAITS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR DISEASE SPREAD, WHEREAS WHEN EXTREME FLOWER TRAITS ARE RARE, FLOWERS WITH UNCOMMON TRAITS IMPACT DISEASE SPREAD THE MOST. GREATER NESTEDNESS AND SPECIALIZATION BOTH TYPICALLY PROMOTE DISEASE PERSISTENCE. GIVEN RECENT POLLINATOR DECLINES CAUSED IN PART BY PATHOGENS, WE DISCUSS HOW TRAIT-BASED MODELS COULD INFORM CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS SPECIATION IS OFTEN DESCRIBED AS A CONTINUOUS DYNAMIC PROCESS, EXPRESSED BY DIFFERENT MAGNITUDES OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION (RI) AMONG GROUPS IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DIVERGENCE. STUDYING INTRASPECIFIC PARTIAL RI CAN SHED LIGHT ON MECHANISMS UNDERLYING PROCESSES OF POPULATION DIVERGENCE. INTRASPECIFIC DIVERGENCE CAN BE DRIVEN BY SPATIALLY STOCHASTIC ACCUMULATION OF GENETIC DIFFERENCES FOLLOWING REDUCED GENE FLOW, RESULTING IN INCREASED RI WITH INCREASED GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE, OR BY LOCAL ADAPTATION, RESULTING IN INCREASED RI WITH ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCE. METHODS WE TESTED FOR RI AS A FUNCTION OF BOTH GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE AND ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION IN IRIS ATROPURPUREA, AN ENDEMIC ISRAELI COASTAL PLANT. WE CROSSED PLANTS IN THE NETANYA IRIS RESERVE POPULATION WITH PLANTS FROM 14 POPULATIONS ACROSS THE SPECIES' FULL DISTRIBUTION, AND CALCULATED RI AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BASED ON FRUIT SET, SEED SET AND FRACTION OF SEED VIABILITY. KEY RESULTS WE FOUND THAT TOTAL RI WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED WITH ECOLOGICAL DISTANCE. SIMILARLY, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE CROSSES, ESTIMATED WHILE CONTROLLING FOR THE DEPENDENCY OF EACH COMPONENT ON THE PREVIOUS STAGE, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WITH INCREASED ECOLOGICAL DISTANCE. CONCLUSIONS OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RISE OF POST-POLLINATION REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS IN I. ATROPURPUREA IS MORE AFFECTED BY ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN POPULATIONS THAN BY GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ECOLOGICAL DIFFERENTIATION IS PREDOMINANT OVER ISOLATION BY DISTANCE AND BY REDUCED GENE FLOW IN THIS SPECIES.

EXP.,"WITH AN ESTIMATED 6000 SPECIES WORLDWIDE, HOVERFLIES ARE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT AS ALTERNATIVE POLLINATORS TO DOMESTICATED HONEYBEES. HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALSO A USEFUL SCIENTIFIC MODEL TO STUDY MOTION VISION AND FLIGHT DYNAMICS IN A CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTING. AS THE LARVAE DEVELOP IN ORGANICALLY POLLUTED WATER, THEY ARE USEFUL MODELS FOR INVESTIGATING INVESTMENT IN MICROBIAL IMMUNITY. WHILE LARGE SCALE COMMERCIAL BREEDING FOR AGRICULTURE ALREADY OCCURS, THERE ARE NO STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS FOR MAINTAINING CAPTIVE POPULATIONS FOR SCIENTIFIC STUDIES. THIS IS IMPORTANT AS COMMERCIAL CAPTIVE BREEDING PROGRAMS FOCUSING ON MASS OUTPUT DURING PEAK POLLINATION PERIODS MAY FAIL TO PROVIDE A POPULATION THAT IS CONSISTENT, STABLE AND ROBUST THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AS IS OFTEN NEEDED FOR OTHER RESEARCH PURPOSES. THEREFORE, A METHOD TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND REFRESH A CAPTIVE RESEARCH POPULATION IS REQUIRED. HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE UTILIZATION OF AN ARTIFICIAL HIBERNATION CYCLE, IN ADDITION TO THE NUTRITIONAL AND HOUSING REQUIREMENTS, FOR LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF ERISTALIS TENAX.

INTRODUCED POLLINATORS MIGHT COMPETITIVELY DISPLACE THEIR NATIVE COUNTERPARTS, WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS THE POLLINATION OF NATIVE PLANTS, IF NATIVE AND ALIEN VISITORS DIFFER IN POLLINATOR EFFECTIVENESS. SINCE ITS INVASION IN 1994 INTO SOUTH-WEST ARGENTINA, THE INTRODUCED EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS RUDERATUS HAS CONTINUOUSLY INCREASED IN ABUNDANCE, ALONG WITH A SIMULTANEOUS DECREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF THE NATIVE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII. THE LATTER IS THE ONLY NATIVE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES OF THE TEMPERATE FORESTS OF SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE MAIN POLLINATOR OF THE ENDEMIC HERB ALSTROEMERIA AUREA. IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE ONGOING DISPLACEMENT OF THE NATIVE BY THE ALIEN BUMBLEBEE, WE COMPARED THE POLLINATOR EFFECTIVENESS (I.E., THE COMBINATION OF POLLINATOR EFFICIENCY PER VISIT AND VISITATION FREQUENCY) BETWEEN BOTH BUMBLEBEE SPECIES, AS WELL AS RELATED POLLINATOR TRAITS THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR EFFICIENCY. NATIVE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII, WHICH HAS A LARGER BODY AND SPENT MORE TIME PER FLOWER, WAS THE MORE EFFICIENT POLLINATOR COMPARED TO BOMBUS RUDERATUS, BOTH IN TERMS OF QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF POLLEN DEPOSITED PER VISIT. HOWEVER, BOMBUS RUDERATUS WAS A MUCH MORE FREQUENT FLOWER VISITOR THAN BOMBUS DAHLBOMII. AS A CONSEQUENCE, BOMBUS RUDERATUS IS NOWADAYS A MORE EFFECTIVE POLLINATOR OF A. AUREA THAN ITS NATIVE CONGENER. DESPITE THE LACK OF EVIDENCE OF AN INCREASE IN SEED SET AT THE POPULATION LEVEL, COMPARISONS WITH HISTORICAL RECORDS OF BOMBUS DAHLBOMII ABUNDANCES PRIOR TO BOMBUS RUDERATUS' INVASION SUGGEST THAT THE OVERALL POLLINATION INTENSITY OF A. AUREA MIGHT IN FACT HAVE RISEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS INVASION.

MOST OF THE DOCUMENTED EFFECTS OF EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS HAVE BEEN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES USING SINGLE PAIRS OF NATIVE AND EXOTIC PLANTS, AND HAVE FOCUSED ON DOMINANT EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES. WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW EXOTIC PLANTS ALTER INTERACTIONS IN ENTIRE COMMUNITIES OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY AT LOW TO MEDIUM INVADER DENSITIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE BEGAN TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS BY EXPERIMENTALLY REMOVING THE FLOWERS OF A SHOWY INVASIVE SHRUB, ROSA MULTIFLORA, AND EVALUATING ITS EFFECTS ON THE FREQUENCY, RICHNESS, AND COMPOSITION OF BEE VISITORS TO CO-FLOWERING NATIVE PLANTS. WE FOUND THAT WHILE R.

OCKINGER E;SMITH HG,OCKINGER E,SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS AS POPULATION SOURCES FOR POLLINATING INSECTS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,J. APPL. ECOL.,"1. IN INTENSIVELY FARMED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, MANY SPECIES ARE CONFINED TO VERY SMALL UNCULTIVATED AREAS SUCH AS FIELD MARGINS. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THESE SMALL HABITAT ELEMENTS CANNOT SUPPORT VIABLE POPULATIONS OF ALL THE SPECIES OBSERVED THERE. INSTEAD, SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN THESE SMALL HABITAT FRAGMENTS MAY, AT LEAST PARTLY, BE DEPENDENT ON DISPERSAL FROM LARGER SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND FRAGMENTS. 2. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS FOR BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLE BEES IN 12 INDEPENDENT LANDSCAPES IN A REGION OF INTENSE AGRICULTURE IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN. IN EACH LANDSCAPE WE SURVEYED ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN ONE SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND, ONE LINEAR HABITAT (UNCULTIVATED FIELD MARGIN) ADJACENT TO THIS (CALLED PROXIMATE) AND ONE SIMILAR LINEAR HABITAT (CALLED DISTANT) SITUATED AT LEAST 1000 M FROM THE SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND PATCH. 3. BOTH SPECIES RICHNESS AND DENSITY (INDIVIDUALS PER UNIT AREA) OF BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLE BEES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS THAN IN DISTANT ONES. MOREOVER, BUTTERFLY SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER FOR A GIVEN AREA IN GRASSLANDS THAN IN ANY OF THE LINEAR HABITAT TYPES. BUTTERFLY DENSITY IN GRASSLANDS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THAT IN PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS BUT WAS LOWER IN DISTANT LINEAR HABITATS. THE EFFECT OF ISOLATION ON DENSITY WAS STRONGER FOR LESS MOBILE BUTTERFLY SPECIES. FOR BUMBLE BEES THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN GRASSLANDS AND PROXIMATE LINEAR HABITATS. 4. FOR AT LEAST SOME OF THE BUTTERFLY SPECIES EVEN THESE RELATIVELY SMALL FRAGMENTS OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS ACT AS POPULATION SOURCES FROM WHICH INDIVIDUALS DISPERSE TO THE SURROUNDING HABITATS AND THEREBY CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN ADJACENT AREAS. FOR BUMBLE BEES, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT THE GRASSLANDS CONTAIN A HIGHER DENSITY OF NESTS THAN THE SURROUNDING INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED LANDSCAPE, AND THAT THE DENSITY OF FORAGING BUMBLE BEES DECREASES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE NEST. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATION. HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A THREAT AGAINST SERVICES PROVIDED BY POLLINATORS.

DIOECIOUS PLANTS ARE OFTEN POLLINATED BY WIND OR INSECTS, BUT ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO POLLINATION FAILURE SHOULD MALE AND FEMALE PLANTS BECOME SPATIALLY SEPARATED, OR SHOULD POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE DECLINE. HERE WE CHARACTERIZE THE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS OF RHUS MICHAUXII SARG (SAPINDALES: ANACARDIACEAE), AN ENDANGERED DIOECIOUS SHRUB ENDEMIC TO THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. WORKING IN THE SANDHILLS REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA, WE DETECTED A DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF ARTHROPODS VISITING R. MICHAUXII FLOWERS, INCLUDING 55 SPECIES OR MORPHOSPECIES, WITH MODERATE NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH MOST VISITORS ACQUIRED POLLEN FROM MALE FLOWERS, POLLEN LOADS WERE GREATLY REDUCED OR DILUTED ON VISITORS TO FEMALE FLOWERS, CONSPECIFIC POLLEN WAS COMPLETELY ABSENT AT ALL-FEMALE SITES. BEES IN THE GENUS MEGACHILE APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLEN VECTORS IN THIS SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THEIR ABUNDANCE AND POLLEN LOAD COMPOSITION. WE CONSTRUCTED A REGIONAL POLLEN TRANSPORT NETWORK INVOLVING 73 ARTHROPOD SPECIES AND 46 POLLEN SPECIES/MORPHOTYPES, IN WHICH R. MICHAUXII PARTICIPATED IN 10\% OF LINKS AND ATTRACTED 38\% OF INDIVIDUAL VISITORS, SUGGESTING THAT IT COMPETES SUCCESSFULLY WITH OTHER PLANTS FOR VISITATION. FINALLY, TIME-LAPSE VIDEOGRAPHY REVEALED THAT FEMALE INFLORESCENCES WERE VISITED ABOUT SIX TIMES LESS OFTEN THAN MALE INFLORESCENCES, BUT AT SIMILAR TIMES OF DAY.

MOLECULAR STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED THAT BUMBLEBEE COLONIES CAN BE ESTABLISHED MANY KILOMETERS FROM THEIR QUEENS' NATAL NEST SITE. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHEN AND HOW QUEENS DISPERSE DURING THEIR LIFESPAN. ONE POSSIBLE LIFE STAGE WHEN DISPERSAL MAY OCCUR, IS DIRECTLY AFTER EMERGING FROM HIBERNATION. HERE, HARMONIC RADAR TRACKING OF ARTIFICIALLY OVER-WINTERED BOMBUS TERRESTRIS QUEENS SHOWS THAT THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME RESTING ON THE GROUND WITH INTERMITTENT VERY SHORT FLIGHTS (DURATION AND DISTANCE). WE CORROBORATE THESE BEHAVIORS WITH OBSERVATIONS OF WILD QUEEN BEES, WHICH SHOW SIMILAR PROLONGED RESTING PERIODS BETWEEN SHORT FLIGHTS, INDICATING THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF OUR RADAR-MONITORED BEES WAS NOT DUE TO THE ATTACHMENT OF TRANSPONDERS NOR AN ARTIFACT OF THE BEES BEING COMMERCIALLY REARED.

NAVARRO L,NAVARRO L,REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND EFFECT OF NECTAR ROBBING ON FRUIT PRODUCTION IN MACLEANIA BULLATA (ERICACEAE),PLANT ECOLOGY,PLANT ECOL.,"HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED FLOWERS ARE FREQUENTLY SUBJECTED TO NECTAR ROBBING. IN THIS PAPER, I EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF NECTAR ROBBING ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS ON A HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES. AFTER STUDYING THE BASIC ASPECTS OF THE FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND REPRODUCTION OF MACLEANIA BULLATA (ERICACEAE) IN A TROPICAL MONTANE WET FOREST IN SOUTHWEST COLOMBIA, I EXAMINED THE PERCENT OF FLOWERS ROBBED AND THE EFFECT OF NECTAR ROBBERY ON FRUIT SET. THE FLOWERS OF THIS SPECIES ARE TYPICAL FOR PLANTS POLLINATED BY LONG-BILL HUMMINGBIRDS. THEY ARE PROTANDROUS AND OPEN FOR FOUR DAYS. FRUIT PRODUCTION REQUIRES A POLLINATOR VISIT, FRUIT SET FOLLOWING POLLINATOR EXCLUSION WAS ZERO. FRUIT SET FOLLOWING XENOGAMOUS POLLEN TRANSFER (36.8\%) DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THAT OF POPULATION CONTROLS (11.9\%) AND OF AUTOGAMOUS POLLEN TRANSFER (6.3\%). NECTAR VOLUME, SUGAR CONCENTRATION AND SUGAR PRODUCTION WERE MEASURED AT DAILY INTERVALS FROM BUD OPENING UNTIL THE FADING OF FLOWERS. DAILY NECTAR PRODUCTION (BOTH VOLUME AND AMOUNT OF SUGAR) VARIED CONSIDERABLY WITH FLOWER AGE. SUGAR PRODUCTION PEAKED ON THE SECOND DAY, COINCIDING WITH THE MALE PHASE. THE FREQUENCY OF NECTAR ROBBING IN THE STUDIED POPULATION WAS VERY HIGH (75\% OF EXAMINED FLOWERS) AND WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH REDUCED FRUIT SET. I DISCUSS THE PROBABILITY OF A RELATION BETWEEN REDUCED FRUIT SET ON ROBBED FLOWERS AND AN ENERGETIC INVESTMENT. ROBBING BY NON-POLLINATING VISITORS CAN SUPPOSE THE PLANT TO RE-SYNTHESIZE MORE NECTAR.

GRAY M;STANSBERRY MJ;LYNN JS;WILLIAMS CF;WHITE TE;WHITNEY KD,GRAY M,CONSISTENT SHIFTS IN POLLINATOR-RELEVANT FLORAL COLORATION ALONG ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELEVATION GRADIENTS,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1. FLORAL COLOUR IS A FUNDAMENTAL SIGNAL THAT SHAPES PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. DESPITE THEORETICAL REASONS WHY FLORAL COLOURS MIGHT SHIFT IN REPRESENTATION ALONG BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC GRADIENTS, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED COMMUNITY-LEVEL SHIFTS IN COLOUR, AND EVEN FEWER SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN DETECTED. 2. WE EXAMINED FLORAL COLOUR ON SIX REPLICATED TRANSECTS SPANNING 1,300 M IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO, USA. ALONG THESE TRANSECTS, THERE IS A HYPOTHESIZED SHIFT FROM BEE-DOMINATED TO FLY-DOMINATED POLLINATION WITH INCREASING ELEVATION. THE REFLECTANCE OF FLOWERS OF 110 FORB AND SHRUB SPECIES WAS MEASURED USING A SPECTROPHOTOMETER, AND WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THREE COMPONENTS OF COLOUR (HUE, SATURATION AND BRIGHTNESS) IN RELEVANT POLLINATOR VISUAL SPACES. PERCENT COVER DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 67 SITES AND USED TO OBTAIN COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN (CWM) ESTIMATES OF FLORAL COLOUR. 3. WE FOUND STRONG PATTERNS OF ELEVATIONAL CHANGE IN FLORAL COLOUR. REFLECTANCE CWM OF SHORTER WAVELENGTHS (UVB THROUGH HUMAN BLUE, 300-500 NM) GENERALLY DECREASED LINEARLY WITH ELEVATION, WHILE REFLECTANCE CWM OF LONGER WAVELENGTHS (HUMAN GREEN THROUGH RED, 500-700 NM) SHOWED HUMP-SHAPED PATTERNS WITH HIGHEST REFLECTANCE AT INTERMEDIATE ELEVATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO POLLINATORS, SATURATION CWM INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ELEVATION IN BOTH BEE AND FLY VISUAL SPACES, WHILE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST CWM SHOWED A HUMP-SHAPED PATTERN IN BEE SPACE AND A DECLINE WITH ELEVATION IN FLY VISUAL SPACE. FOR HUE, COVER OF SPECIES PERCEIVED AS BEE-BLUE DECLINED WITH ELEVATION, WHILE COVER OF BEE-UV-GREEN SPECIES SHOWED A HUMP-SHAPED PATTERN. IN COMPARISON, WE DETECTED NO ELEVATIONAL SHIFTS IN FLORAL HUES AS PERCEIVED BY FLIES. 4. SYNTHESIS. HUE PATTERNS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BEE POLLINATORS HAVE SHAPED THE GEOGRAPHY OF FLORAL COLOUR. THE ROLES OF FLY POLLINATORS AND OF ABIOTIC DRIVERS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO INFER, ALTHOUGH THE DROP IN FLORAL BRIGHTNESS AT HIGH ELEVATIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREDICTIONS THAT LOW TEMPERATURES AND MORE INTENSE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION SHOULD FAVOUR INCREASED PIGMENT CONCENTRATIONS THERE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT FLORAL COLOUR CAN BE DYNAMIC YET PREDICTABLE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, A PATTERN THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO TEASE APART THE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY DRIVERS OF THIS IMPORTANT PLANT TRAIT.",BEE VISION; ECOLOGICAL FILTERING; FLY VISION; NATURAL SELECTION; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; SIGNALLING; ULTRAVIOLET,FLOWER-COLOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISCRIMINATION; BUMBLEBEES; SIGNALS; BEES; FLY; PREFERENCES; HERBIVORES; EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA.;GRAY, MICHELLE, STANSBERRY, MARCUS J., LYNN, JOSHUA S., WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., WHITNEY, KENNETH D., ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;LYNN, JOSHUA S., WHITNEY, KENNETH D., UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA.;WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., IDAHO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, POCATELLO, ID 83209 USA.;WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., IDAHO MUSEUM NAT HIST, RAY J DAVIS HERBARIUM, POCATELLO, ID USA.;WHITE, THOMAS E., UNIV SYDNEY, SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.",10.1111/1365-2745.12948,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGYNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1257965],"DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 1257965",0022-0477,5,1910-1924,WILEY,106,2018,ISI000452178600013,65,"PLANT SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",25,"PLANT SCIENCES, ECOLOGY",WHITNEYKUNM.EDU,HD0DT,"WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA",ISI,none,ROCKY MT BIOL LABS;UNIV NEW MEXICO;IDAHO STATE UNIV;UNIV SYDNEY,ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,NA,"GRAY M, 2018, J ECOL","GRAY M, 2018, J ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,John M

AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE, BEE COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED BY HABITAT COMPOSITION, ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USE, AND FRAGMENTATION. HOWEVER, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON LOCAL-SCALE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF BEE COMMUNITIES WITHIN HABITATS THAT ARE UNIFORM AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. WE STUDIED A BEE COMMUNITY ALONG WITH FLORAL AND NESTING RESOURCES OVER A 32 KM(2) AREA OF UNINTERRUPTED MEDITERRANEAN SCRUBLAND. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE (I) TO ANALYZE FLORAL AND NESTING RESOURCE COMPOSITION AT THE HABITAT SCALE. WE ASK WHETHER THESE RESOURCES FOLLOW A GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN ACROSS THE SCRUBLAND AT BEE-FORAGING RELEVANT DISTANCES, (II) TO ANALYZE THE DISTRIBUTION OF BEE COMPOSITION ACROSS THE SCRUBLAND. BEES BEING HIGHLY MOBILE ORGANISMS, WE ASK WHETHER BEE COMPOSITION SHOWS A HOMOGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OR ELSE VARIES SPATIALLY. IF SO, WE ASK WHETHER THIS VARIATION IS IRREGULAR OR FOLLOWS A GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN AND WHETHER BEES RESPOND PRIMARILY TO FLOWER OR TO NESTING RESOURCES, AND (III) TO ESTABLISH WHETHER BODY SIZE INFLUENCES THE RESPONSE TO LOCAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND ULTIMATELY SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION. WE OBTAINED 6580 SPECIMENS BELONGING TO 98 SPECIES. DESPITE BEE MOBILITY AND THE ABSENCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS, OUR BEE COMMUNITY SHOWS A CLEAR GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN. THIS PATTERN IS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTION OF SMALL (<55 MG) SPECIES (WITH PRESUMED SMALLER FORAGING RANGES), AND IS MOSTLY EXPLAINED BY FLOWER RESOURCES RATHER THAN NESTING SUBSTRATES. EVEN THEN, A LARGE PROPORTION (54.8\%) OF SPATIAL VARIABILITY REMAINS UNEXPLAINED BY FLOWER OR NESTING RESOURCES. WE CONCLUDE THAT BEE COMMUNITIES ARE STRONGLY CONDITIONED BY LOCAL EFFECTS AND MAY EXHIBIT SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY PATTERNS AT A SCALE AS LOW AS 500-1000 M IN PATCHES OF HOMOGENEOUS HABITAT.

HORTIC.,"IN JAPAN, HONEY BEES, BUMBLEBEES, AND FLIES ARE USED IN STRAWBERRY PRODUCTION TO PRODUCE NORMALLY SHAPED FRUITS. THESE INSECTS MAY DETERMINE THE INBREEDING OR OUTBREEDING OF STRAWBERRY FLOWERS. WHOLE-GENOME DNA OF THE STRAWBERRY CULTIVAR `SHIZUTAKARA' SHOWED NO AMPLIFICATION OF DNA FRAGMENTS WHEN PCR WAS PERFORMED WITH A F3H CAPS DNA MARKER. HOWEVER, IN OTHER ORDINARY STRAWBERRY CULTIVARS, AMPLIFICATION OF DNA FRAGMENTS WAS OBSERVED ON PCR WITH THE F3H. THUS, GROWING ONE PLANT OF `SHIZUTAKARA' WITH OTHER CULTIVARS AND A SINGLE INSECT SPECIES, HARVESTING `SHIZUTAKARA' FRUIT, AND PERFORMING DNA ANALYSIS OF THE SEEDS COULD SHOW WHETHER THE SEED RESULTED FROM INBREEDING OR OUTBREEDING, AS THE DNA FRAGMENTS WOULD BE AMPLIFIED FROM OUTBRED BUT NOT FROM INBRED SEED. ON THIS BASIS, DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION MODE AMONG THESE THREE POLLINATORS WERE ANALYZED. DNA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT DNA FRAGMENTS COULD NOT BE DETECTED IN SEEDS OBTAINED BY FLY POLLINATION IN THE GREENHOUSE. FLIES APPEARED TO PROMOTE INBREEDING. FOR HONEY BEES AND BUMBLE BEE, AMPLIFIED DNA FRAGMENTS COULD BE DETECTED. SOME SEEDS POLLINATED BY HONEY BEES AND BUMBLE BEE APPEARED TO BE OF OUTBRED ORIGIN.

TO INVESTIGATE THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION FURTHER. I MANIPULATED THE LEVELS OF AGGREGATION IN LINEAR PLANT ARRAYS AND EXAMINED BOTH THE EFFECT ON THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BUMBLEBEE POLLINATORS AND THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES FOR POLLEN DISPERSAL AND GENE FLOW. I STUDIED POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS AMONG PLANTS OF OIL-SEED RAPE (BRASSICA NAPUS CV. WESTAR) THAT WERE ARRANGED IN ROWS THAT EACH CONTAINED 50 PLANTS. IN EACH EXPERIMENT ONE ROW OF PLANTS WAS SPACED AT UNIFORM INTERVALS AND THE REMAINING ROWS CONTAINED AGGREGATED PLANT DISTRIBUTIONS. EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AT TWO SCALES, SHORT ROWS (10 M) AND LONG ROWS (20 M). THE PLANTS WERE VISITED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY WORKER CASTE INDIVIDUALS OF BOMBUS LAPIDARIUS. BUMBLEBEES WERE FOLLOWED OVER SUCCESSIVE VISITS WITHIN A ROW AND THE LOCATION OF EACH VISITED PLANT AND THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED THERE WAS RECORDED. WITHIN EACH ROW, I EXAMINED THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS OF BUMBLEBEE BEHAVIOUR: THE MEAN NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED PER PLANT VISIT, THE MEAN INTERPLANT FLIGHT DISTANCE, AND THE MEAN DIRECTIONALITY (PROPORTION OF MOVES IN AN INDIVIDUAL'S FAVOURED DIRECTION). THE COLLECTIVE MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLEBEES WITHIN EACH ROW WERE CHARACTERISED BY THE RATE OF CHANGE OF THE BEES' MEAN SQUARED DISTANCE FROM AN ORIGINAL LOCATION. THE SPATIAL DISPERSION OF POLLEN FROM A PATERNAL PLANT WAS ESTIMATED IN EACH ROW BY COMBINING A QUANTITATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUMBLEBEE MOVEMENTS IN TERMS OF DISPLACEMENT FROM A PATERNAL PLANT WITH A MODEL OF POLLEN DEPOSITION. BUMBLEBEES WERE OBSERVED TO VISIT MANY PLANTS SUCCESSIVELY WITHIN A ROW AND MOVEMENTS BETWEEN ROWS WERE INFREQUENT. IN BOTH LONG AND SHORT ROWS, THREE COMPONENTS OF BUMBLEBEE MOVEMENT BEHAVIOUR WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIED BY THE LEVEL OF PLANT AGGREGATION. WITH INCREASING PLANT AGGREGATION, BUMBLEBEES EXHIBITED A DECREASE IN DIRECTIONALITY AND IN THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED PER PLANT VISIT AND THEY EXHIBITED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PLANTS BY-PASSED DURING INTERPLANT FLIGHTS. DESPITE THE EFFECTS OF PLANT AGGREGATION ON THE COMPONENTS OF BUMBLEBEE BEHAVIOUR, THE BUMBLEBEES' COLLECTIVE RATE OF MOVEMENT AWAY FROM AN ORIGIN WITHIN A ROW WAS UNRELATED TO THE LEVEL OF PLANT AGGREGATION. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FINDING THAT PLANT AGGREGATION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT EITHER THE ESTIMATES OF MEAN POLLEN DISPERSAL DISTANCES MEASURED IN METRES OR A PLANT'S EXPECTED NUMBER OF FEMALE MATES. THE MODIFICATIONS TO BUMBLEBEE BEHAVIOUR THAT WERE CAUSED BY DIFFERENTIAL AGGREGATION AMONG ROWS APPARENTLY COMBINED, FORTUITOUSLY, TO BUFFER THE SPATIAL EXTENT OF POLLEN DISPERSAL. CONSEQUENTLY, MY RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH MANASSE'S FINDING THAT POLLINATOR-MEDIATED GENE FLOW WAS UNRELATED TO PLANT SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY AT THESE SCALES.

BOT.,"VARIOUS FACTORS KNOWN TO AFFECT FRUIT SET IN SELF-INCOMPATIBLE PLANTS WERE STUDIED IN 11 POPULATIONS OF CENTAUREA SCABIOSA. THE IMPORTANCE OF GENETIC VARIATION WAS ESTIMATED USING ISOZYMES. A LOW OVERALL GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG POPULATIONS SUGGESTED HIGH LEVELS OF EITHER CURRENT OR HISTORICAL GENE FLOW. LARGE VARIATION IN FRUIT SET WAS FOUND AMONG POPULATIONS, AMONG PLANTS WITHIN POPULATIONS, AND AMONG FLOWER HEADS WITHIN PLANTS. MOST OF THIS VARIATION WAS EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES AMONG FLOWER HEADS WITHIN PLANTS. WITHIN THE RANGE IN POPULATION SIZE STUDIED, THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT PLANTS GROWING IN THE SMALLER POPULATIONS HAD LOWER FRUIT SET THAN PLANTS IN LARGER ONES. A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN GENETIC VARIATION AND POPULATION REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WAS FOUND. POLLINATOR VISITATION RATE WAS VERY HIGH AND DOMINATED BY BUMBLEBEES. IT WAS RENDERED UNLIKELY THAT REPRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY. IT WAS EVEN SUGGESTED THAT A VERY HIGH VISITATION RATE MIGHT HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON FRUIT SET IN SOME POPULATIONS DUE TO AN INCREASED PROPORTION OF GEITONOGAMOUS POLLINATION RESULTING IN STIGMA CLOGGING WITH NON-COMPATIBLE POLLEN.

LIFE HISTORY TRAITS, SUCH AS OVERWINTERING LIFE STAGE, SEX, AND BODY SIZE MAY INFLUENCE SOLITARY BEE RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY MEDIATING THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESSES SPANNING FALL, WINTER, AND SPRING. YET, MOST STUDIES ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON SOLITARY BEES HAVE FOCUSED ON MANAGED SPECIES AND HAVE ISOLATED THE EFFECTS OF WINTER TEMPERATURE. HERE, WE REARED MALE AND FEMALE INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING EIGHT CAVITY-NESTING SOLITARY BEE SPECIES THAT OVERWINTER EITHER AS ADULTS (I.E., OSMIA SPP.) OR PREPUPAE (I.E., MEGACHILE SPP.). EIGHT REARING TREATMENTS WERE USED, IN WHICH WE MANIPULATED FALL AND SPRING TEMPERATURE, FALL DURATION, AND THE TIMING OF SPRING ONSET. WE MEASURED PRE-EMERGENCE MORTALITY, PRE-EMERGENCE WEIGHT LOSS, EMERGENCE TIMING, AND POST-EMERGENCE LIFESPAN. WE FOUND THAT OSMIA SPP. RESPONDED PRIMARILY TO THE TIMING OF SPRING ONSET, WHEREAS MEGACHILE SPP. RESPONDED PRIMARILY TO SPRING TEMPERATURE. EARLY-SPRING ONSET INCREASED BOTH PRE-EMERGENCE MORTALITY AND PRE-EMERGENCE WEIGHT LOSS AND REDUCED POST-EMERGENCE LIFESPAN IN OSMIA SPP. IN ADDITION, TREATMENTS CAUSED UNEQUAL SHIFTS IN THE TIMING OF EMERGENCE BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE OSMIA SPP. BY CONTRAST, WARMER SPRING TEMPERATURE DECREASED WEIGHT LOSS, AND INCREASED LIFESPAN IN MEGACHILE SPP. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT OSMIA SPP. MAY BE MORE VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE COMPARED TO MEGACHILE SPP., AND THAT CLIMATE CHANGE MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POPULATION-LEVEL SEX-RATIOS AND MATING SUCCESS IN SPECIES OF OSMIA.

ENTOMOL.,"BUMBLE BEES (GENUS BOMBUS) ARE GLOBALLY IMPORTANT INSECT POLLINATORS, AND SEVERAL SPECIES HAVE EXPERIENCED MARKED DECLINES IN RECENT YEARS. BOTH NUTRITIONAL LIMITATION AND PATHOGENS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE DECLINES. WHILE EACH OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE INDIVIDUALLY IMPORTANT, THERE MAY ALSO BE SYNERGISMS WHERE NUTRITIONAL STRESS COULD DECREASE PATHOGEN RESISTANCE. UNDERSTANDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BUMBLE BEES, THEIR PARASITES, AND FOOD AVAILABILITY MAY PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSES OF DECLINES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE COMBINED IMPACTS OF POLLEN AND NECTAR LIMITATION ON CRITHIDIA, A COMMON GUT PARASITE IN BOMBUS IMPATIENS CRESSON. INDIVIDUAL WORKER BEES WERE INOCULATED WITH CRITHIDIA AND THEN ASSIGNED IN A FACTORIAL DESIGN TO TWO LEVELS OF POLLEN AVAILABILITY (POLLEN OR NO POLLEN) AND TWO NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS (HIGH [30\%] OR LOW [15\%] SUCROSE). WE FOUND THAT LACK OF POLLEN AND LOW NECTAR SUGAR BOTH REDUCED CRITHIDIA CELL COUNTS, WITH THE MOST DRAMATIC EFFECT FROM LACK OF POLLEN. BOTH POLLEN AVAILABILITY AND NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION WERE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR BEE SURVIVAL. THE PROPORTION OF BEES THAT DIED AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF INFECTION WAS SIMILAR TO 25\% LOWER IN BEES WITH ACCESS TO POLLEN AND HIGH NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION THAN ANY OTHER TREATMENT.

EVOL.,"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, FOR EXAMPLE, LOSS OF SEMINATURAL VEGETATION AND PESTICIDE USE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BEE COMMUNITY. THESE FACTORS MAY IMPACT THE BEE COMMUNITY DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE SCALES. THE SCALE DEPENDENCY IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, THE SCALE-DEPENDENT RESPONSE OF THE BEE COMMUNITY TO DRIVERS OF ITS DECLINE IS RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED, ESPECIALLY IN THE TROPICS WHERE THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IS OFTEN HETEROGENEOUS. THIS STUDY LOOKED AT EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ON BEE DIVERSITY AT PATCH AND LANDSCAPE SCALES IN A TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. WILD BEES WERE SAMPLED USING 12 PERMANENT PAN TRAP STATIONS. PATCH AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEASURED WITHIN A 100 M (PATCH SCALE) AND A 500 M (LANDSCAPE SCALE) RADIUS OF PAN TRAP STATIONS. INFORMATION ON PESTICIDE INPUT WAS OBTAINED FROM FARMER SURVEYS. DATA ON VEGETATION COVER, PRODUCTIVITY, AND PERCENTAGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND FALLOW LAND (FL) WERE COLLECTED USING SATELLITE IMAGERY. INTENSIVE AREAS IN A BEE-SITE NETWORK WERE LESS SPECIALIZED IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO ATTRACT RARE BEE SPECIES WHILE THE LESS INTENSIVE AREAS, WHICH SUPPORTED MORE RARE SPECIES, WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO DISTURBANCE. A COMBINATION OF PATCH QUALITY AND DIVERSITY AS WELL AS PESTICIDE USE REGULATES SPECIES DIVERSITY AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE (500 M), WHEREAS PESTICIDE QUANTITY DROVE DIVERSITY AT THE PATCH SCALE (100 M). AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, SPECIALIZATION OF EACH SITE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES FOR BEES INCREASED WITH INCREASING PATCH DIVERSITY AND FL WHILE AT THE PATCH SCALE SPECIALIZATION DECLINED WITH INCREASED PESTICIDE USE. BEE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS RESPONDED DIFFERENTIALLY TO LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS PESTICIDE USE. WOOD NESTING BEES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF PESTICIDES USED BUT OTHER BEE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO PESTICIDES. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS: DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECT WILD BEE DIVERSITY AT THE SCALE OF LANDSCAPE AND PATCH IN HETEROGENEOUS TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS.

CONTRARY TO PREDICTIONS, RARE PLANTS WERE ACTUALLY AT AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF BEES ATTRACTED PER PLANT.

BUMBLEBEES ARE THE ONLY VISITORS OF B. ALPINA, THEY COLLECT POLLEN AND NECTAR. FLOWER PHENOLOGIES OF SEVERAL BUMBLEBEE VISITED SPECIES AND THEIR NECTAR STANDING CROPS WERE MEASURED. FLOWERING OF BARTSIA STARTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ASTRAGALUS FRIGIDUS WHILE PEDICULARIS LAPPONICA WAS NEARLY OUT OF FLOWER. EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF BARTSIA RECEIVED FEWER VISITS THAN LATER BLOOMING ONES. THE LARGE VOLUMES OF NECTAR WITH A HIGH SUGAR CONCENTRATION IN EARLY FLOWERS INDICATE THAT BUMBLEBEES NEGLECT OR FAIL TO DISCOVER EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF BARTSIA. EARLY IN THE SEASON SEVEN BUMBLEBEES SPECIES VISITED BARTSIA BUT LATER ON BOMBUS PASCUORUM WAS DOMINANT. THIS SPECIES WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT VISITOR OF ASTRAGALUS. A RATHER LOW PERCENTAGE OF THE POLLEN LOADS CONTAINED ONLY BARTSIA POLLEN, 27-28\%, DURING EARLY AND PEAK FLOWERING OF BARTSIA. CORBICULAR LOADS OF B. PASCUORUM, THE MOST FREQUENT VISITOR OF BARTSIA, OFTEN CONTAINED BARTSIA BUT ALSO CONTAINED ASTRAGAHUS POLLEN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ERICACEAE POLLEN (PROBABLY OF ANDROMEDA POLIFOLIA). THE LARGE VARIATION IN COMPOSITION OF CORBICULAR LOADS INDICATED THAT BUMBLEBEES WERE NOT FAITHFUL TO BARTSIA ONLY AND THAT SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES WERE VISITED BY THE SAME INDIVIDUALS. BUMBLEBEE VISITATION OF BARTSIA AND PEDICULARIS DURING A SINGLE TRIP MAY RESULT IN HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITION WHICH MAY LOWER SEED SET IN BARTSIA. BUMBLEBEE VISITATION OF BARTSIA AND ASTRAGALUS DURING A SINGLE TRIP MAY NOT RESULT IN HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITION ON BARTSIA FLOWERS DUE TO THE DEPOSITION OF BARTSIA POLLEN ON THE DORSAL AND ASTRAGALUS POLLEN ON THE VENTRAL SIDE OF THE BODY OF BUMBLEBEES. LOW SEED SET OF EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF B. ALPINA WAS PROBABLY DUE TO LOW VISITATION RATES BY BUMBLEBEES. IN ADDITION, SEED SET OF EARLY FLOWERS MAY BE LOW DUE TO HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITIONS BUT THIS ALSO MAY OCCUR LATER IN THE SEASON IF THE COMPOSITION OF CORBICULAR LOADS IS CONSIDERED.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS FOR BIODIVERSITY LOSS IN RECENT DECADES. POLLINATORS, WHICH SERVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN POLLINATING CROPS AS WELL AS WILD PLANTS, HAVE SHOWN A DECLINE IN SPECIES RICHNESS. FLOWER STRIPS CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT POLLINATORS IN AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS, HOWEVER THE QUESTION REMAINS AS TO HOW THEIR DESIGN CAN BE OPTIMIZED IN ORDER TO BEST BENEFIT POLLINATORS. INCREASING PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR POLLINATORS, AND IT IS OFTEN SUGGESTED THAT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS ARE DRIVING THIS RELATIONSHIP. THEREFORE, INCREASING PLANT FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY COULD BE A TOOL TO SUPPORT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. AS EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE ON THIS RELATIONSHIP IS SCARCE, WE DEVELOPED A FIELD STUDY WITH EXPERIMENTAL SOWN FLOWER STRIPS WITH FOUR FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY LEVELS, BASED ON MULTIPLE FLOWER TRAITS AND WITH EQUAL PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. WE MONITORED VEGETATION DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS THE FLOWER-VISITING POLLINATOR COMMUNITY AND THEIR INTERACTION NETWORKS WITH FLOWERS. WE WERE ABLE TO CREATE A FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY GRADIENT WHILE CONTROLLING FOR PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AND EVENNESS. HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS AND EVENNESS WERE NOT INFLUENCED BY FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, AND INCREASING FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY EVEN RESULTED IN LOWER FLOWER VISITATION RATES. NETWORK STABILITY METRICS SHOWED NO EFFECT OR NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY.

NATURALIST,"DESERT ALMOND, PRUNUS FASCICULATA (ROSACEAE), IS A MOJAVE DESERT SHRUB THAT PRIMARILY PRODUCES MALE AND FEMALE FLOWERS ON DIFFERENT PLANTS. I INVESTIGATED THE PLANT'S POLLINATION BY EXAMINING POLLEN LOADS ON INSECTS ASPIRATED FROM FEMALE FLOWERS ON 3 DIOECIOUS SHRUBS, GROWING NEAR MALE-FLOWERING SHRUBS, AT ONE LOCALITY IN SOUTHERN NEVADA DURING MARCH 2014. POLLEN LOADS WERE ANALYZED ON 9 SPECIES OF DIPTERA IN BOMBYLIIDAE, SYRPHIDAE, CALLIPHORIDAE, AND TACHINIDAE AND 4 SPECIES OF HYMENOPTERA IN ANDRENIDAE (ALL FEMALE ANDRENA). ALL BUT 4 OF THE 65 FLIES AND 38 BEES ASPIRATED CARRIED P. FASCICULATA POLLEN GRAINS, RECOGNIZED BY THEIR TRICOLPATE SHAPE IN POLAR VIEW AND OBLATE SHAPE IN EQUATORIAL VIEW. TWO SPECIES OF SYRPHID FLIES IN COPESTYLUM WERE FREQUENTLY ASPIRATED AND CARRIED HIGH P. FASCICULATA POLLEN LOADS AND MODERATE PROPORTIONS OF CONSPECIFIC POLLEN. HIGH CONSPECIFIC POLLEN LOADS ON THE TACHINID CHAETOGAEDIA ALSO INDICATED POTENTIAL FOR POLLINATING P. FASCICULATA. THREE OF THE 4 SPECIES OF ANDRENA BEES CARRIED LARGE AMOUNTS OF P. FASCICULATA POLLEN. CONSPECIFIC POLLEN ALSO COMPRISED MOST OF THE POLLEN LOAD ON ANDRENA BEES, SUGGESTING HIGH FLOWER CONSTANCIES TO THE PLANT. POLLINATORS OF P. FASCICULATA WOULD VARY OVER THE PLANT'S RANGE, AND LIKELY BETWEEN YEARS, BECAUSE OF THE LOCALIZED POPULATIONS OR NARROW LARVAL DIETS OF MANY OF THE INSECTS COLLECTED FROM FLOWERS.

(LABIATAE),EVOLUTION,EVOLUTION,"I ADDRESS HOW FLORAL COMPLEXITY INFLUENCES GEITONOGAMOUS SELF-POLLINATION THROUGH MANIPULATION OF POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR IN SALVIA NIPPONICA. THE PIVOTING STAMENS OF S. NIPPONICA HINDER NECTAR-COLLECTING BUMBLEBEES FROM CRAWLING INTO FLOWERS, INCREASING THE PROBING TIME PER FLOWER. I PREDICTED THAT LONGER PROBING TIMES WOULD REDUCE THE RELATIVE COST OF MOVING BETWEEN PLANTS, CAUSING BEES TO LEAVE PLANTS EARLIER. TO TEST THIS PREDICTION, I SIMPLIFIED S. NIPPONICA FLOWERS BY REMOVING THE STAMENS FROM ALL OPEN FLOWERS WITHIN A 75-M(2) QUADRAT. BUMBLEBEES PROBED THESE FLOWERS MORE QUICKLY THAN INTACT FLOWERS, BUT THE STAMEN REMOVAL AFFECTED NEITHER THE FREQUENCY OF FLOWER REVISITATION NOR THE FLIGHT DISTANCE BETWEEN PLANTS. IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN THE PROBING TIME PER FLOWER, BEES PROBED MORE FLOWERS ON THESE PLANTS. THEREFORE, IN S. NIPPONICA, FLORAL COMPLEXITY REDUCES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GEITONOGAMOUS SELF-POLLINATION. STAMEN REMOVAL ALSO INCREASED BEE VISITATION PER FLOWER, SUGGESTING THAT THIS SORT OF COMPLEXITY DETERS VISITATION.

WHEN THE AMOUNT OF TOMATO POLLEN WAS SUFFICIENT, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION EFFICIENCY BETWEEN THE STINGLESS BEE AND THE BUMBLEBEE, HOWEVER, THE RATES OF FORAGED FLOWERS, THE RATE OF FRUIT SET AND THE YIELDS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE STINGLESS BEE COMPARED WITH THE BUMBLEBEE WHEN FERTILE TOMATO POLLEN DECREASED MARKEDLY DURING THE HOTTEST PERIOD OF THE SUMMER. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE RATE OF FLOWERS FORAGED BY BUMBLEBEES DID NOT DECREASE, BUT THE RATES OF FRUIT SET, THE SEED NUMBER AND THE YIELDS OF TOMATO FRUITS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN COMPARISON WITH THE OTHER PERIODS. IT IS KNOWN THAT TOMATO POLLEN PRODUCTION IS INHIBITED AT HIGH TEMPERATURES, THUS, WE CONSIDER THAT THE HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE GREENHOUSE (AVERAGE DAILY TEMPERATURE HIGHER THAN 28 DEGREES C) CAUSED THE EXTREME DECREASE IN POLLEN PRODUCTION.

HOWEVER, DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE PHYLOGENETIC TREE IN THESE ANALYSES WERE WEAKLY SUPPORTED, AND INTEGRATING INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT PLANT GENOMES IS CLEARLY NECESSARY IN ORCHIDS, WHERE RETICULATE EVOLUTION EVENTS ARE PUTATIVELY COMMON.

AM.,"ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES IN LAND USE AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ARE THOUGHT TO BE GREATER DRIVERS OF DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATING INSECTS SUCH AS BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APIFORMES) THAN AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND PESTICIDE USE. YET, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW HABITAT FRAGMENTATION BY URBANIZATION AFFECTS POLLINATOR NESTING DYNAMICS. WE INVESTIGATED THE NESTING DYNAMICS OF NATIVE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES THAT INHABIT FRAGMENTS OF SONORAN DESERT IN TUCSON, AZ. SPECIFICALLY, WE COMPARED FLORAL DENSITIES, NEST COMPLETION, AND NEST ATTACK RATES OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES IN LARGE (> 2 HA) AND SMALL (< 0.5 HA) FRAGMENTS. IN SMALL FRAGMENTS, WHERE RESOURCE DENSITY WAS HIGH, MORE NESTS WERE OCCUPIED AND FEMALES RESPONDED BY PROVISIONING OFFSPRING MORE QUICKLY THAN IN LARGER FRAGMENTS WHERE RESOURCE DENSITY WAS LOW. HOWEVER, NESTS IN SMALL FRAGMENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE ATTACKED BY NATURAL ENEMIES THAN THOSE IN LARGE FRAGMENTS. IN THIS DESERT SYSTEM, HABITAT SIZE, THE MOST-OFTEN USED METRIC FOR EXAMINATION OF HOW POLLINATORS RESPOND TO HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, AFFECTS NESTING DYNAMICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS THROUGH ITS INTERACTIONS WITH NEST-SITE AVAILABILITY, ABUNDANCE OF FLORAL RESOURCES, AND NATURAL ENEMY ATTACK.

THIS WAS THE CASE EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR THE FACT THAT FRUIT TREES WERE GENERALLY SMALLER IN MORE CONTAMINATED AREAS. FRUIT-EATING BIRDS LIKE THRUSHES AND WARBLERS THAT ARE KNOWN SEED DISPERSERS WERE LESS NUMEROUS IN AREAS WITH LOWER FRUIT ABUNDANCE, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION, PROVIDING A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RADIATION, POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, FRUIT ABUNDANCE AND ABUNDANCE OF FRUGIVORES. GIVEN THAT THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER HAPPENED 25 YEARS AGO, ONE WOULD PREDICT REDUCED LOCAL RECRUITMENT OF FRUIT TREES IF FRUIT SET HAS BEEN PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED DURING THAT PERIOD, INDEED, LOCAL RECRUITMENT WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF RADIATION AND POSITIVELY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL OF FRUIT SET. THE PATTERNS AT THE LEVEL OF TREES WERE REPLICATED AT THE LEVEL OF VILLAGES ACROSS THE STUDY SITE.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS MOST NEOTROPICAL SPECIES OF MALPIGHIACEAE PRODUCE FLORAL FATTY OILS IN CALYX GLANDS TO ATTRACT POLLINATING OIL-COLLECTING BEES, WHICH DEPEND ON THIS RESOURCE FOR REPRODUCTION. THIS SPECIALIZED TYPE OF POLLINATION SYSTEM TENDS TO BE LOST IN MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION (E.G. AFRICA) OF NEOTROPICAL OIL-COLLECTING BEES. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY, CHEMICAL ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF AN OIL FLOWER SPECIES, PTERANDRA PYROIDEA (MALPIGHIACEAE) FROM THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO. POPULATIONS OF THIS SPECIES CONSIST OF PLANTS WITH OIL-SECRETING (GLANDULAR) FLOWERS, PLANTS WITH NON-OIL-SECRETING FLOWERS (EGLANDULAR) OR A MIX OF BOTH PLANT TYPES. THIS STUDY SPECIFICALLY AIMS TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF EGLANDULAR MORPHS IN THIS SPECIES. METHODS DATA ON POLLINATORS WERE RECORDED BY IN SITU OBSERVATIONS. BREEDING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED BY ISOLATING INFLORESCENCES AND BY ENZYMATIC REACTIONS. FLORAL RESOURCES, POLLEN AND FLORAL OILS OFFERED BY THIS SPECIES WERE ANALYSED BY STAINING AND A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS. KEY RESULTS EGLANDULAR FLOWERS OF P. PYROIDEA DO NOT ACT AS MIMICS OF THEIR OIL-PRODUCING CONSPECIFICS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS. INSTEAD, BOTH OIL-PRODUCING AND OIL-FREE FLOWERS DEPEND ON POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES FOR REPRODUCTION, AND THEIR MAIN POLLINATORS ARE BUMBLE-BEES. FLORAL OILS PRODUCED BY GLANDULAR FLOWERS ARE LESS COMPLEX THAN THOSE DESCRIBED IN CLOSELY RELATED GENERA. CONCLUSIONS EGLANDULAR FLOWERS REPRESENT A SHIFT IN THE POLLINATION SYSTEM IN WHICH OIL IS BEING LOST AND POLLEN IS BECOMING THE MAIN REWARD OF P. PYROIDEA FLOWERS. POLLINATION SHIFTS OF THIS KIND HAVE HITHERTO NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED EMPIRICALLY WITHIN NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE AND THIS SPECIES EXHIBITS AN UNUSUAL TRANSITION FROM A SPECIALIZED TOWARDS A GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM IN AN AREA CONSIDERED THE HOTSPOT OF OIL-COLLECTING BEE DIVERSITY IN THE NEOTROPICS.

GEN.,"OVER THE PAST DECADES, THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON BEE HEALTH HAVE GAINED A LOT OF ATTENTION DUE TO THE VALUE OF BEES AS POLLINATORS. SULFOXAFLOR IS A RECENTLY DEVELOPED SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDE IN THE NEW SULFOXIMINE CLASS OF INSECTICIDES AND HAS SHOWN HIGH EFFICIENCY AGAINST A WIDE RANGE OF PEST INSECTS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS THEREFORE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF SULFOXAFLOR ON THE BUFF-TAILED OR LARGE EARTH BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS), KNOWN AS AN IMPORTANT GENERALIST POLLINATOR OF WILD PLANTS AND MANY AGRICULTURAL CROPS WORLDWIDE. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, A LABORATORY BIOASSAY WITH QUEENLESS BUMBLEBEE MICROCOLONIES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AND USED TO ASSESS FOR BOTH TOXICITY AND EFFECTS ON FORAGING BEHAVIOUR IN B. TERRESTRIS FOR NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES (IMIDACLOPRID AND THIAMETHOXAM), WAS SPECIFICALLY EMPLOYED. HERE, MICROCOLONIES OF B. TERRESTRIS WORKERS, WITH OR WITHOUT THE NEED TO FORAGE FOR FOOD, WERE EXPOSED TO SUGAR WATER SUPPLEMENTED WITH FIELD-REALISTIC CONCENTRATIONS OF SULFOXAFLOR (STARTING FROM 15 MU G/ML TO 5 AND 1 MU G/ML) VIA ORAL EXPOSURE DURING 15 DAYS. IN ADDITION TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BUMBLEBEE WORKER SURVIVAL, THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO HIGHER TOXICITY CAUSED BY SULFOXAFLOR WHEN THE BUMBLEBEES HAD TO FORAGE FOR THEIR FOOD COMPARED TO WHEN THEY DID NOT HAVE TO FORAGE. THESE RESULTS COULD GUIDE FUTURE STUDIES IN THIS CONTEXT AND COULD BE USED IN DEBATES ON INSECTICIDES AND/OR RISK ASSESSMENT OF PESTICIDES WITH POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON BEHAVIOUR IN BUMBLEBEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS IN GENERAL.",SULFOXIMINE; ORAL EXPOSURE; INSECTICIDE; SIDE EFFECTS; POLLINATOR,COMPATIBILITY; POLLINATORS; PESTICIDES; MODE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"TANING, CNT, SMAGGHE, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, FAC BIOSCI ENGN, DEPT PLANTS \& CROPS, COUPURE LINKS 653, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.;TANING, CLAUVIS NJI TIZI, VANOMMESLAEGHE, ADINDA, SMAGGHE, GUY, UNIV GHENT, FAC BIOSCI ENGN, DEPT PLANTS \& CROPS, COUPURE LINKS 653, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM.",10.1127/ENTOMOLOGIA/2019/0784,"NAEGELE U OBERMILLER, SCIENCE PUBLISHERS, JOHANNESSTRASSE 3A, D 70176 STUTTGART, GERMANY",NA,BELGIAN SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE (BELSPO)BELGIAN FEDERAL SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE [BR/132/A1/BELBEES]; SPECIAL RESEARCH FUND OF GHENT UNIVERSITY (BOF-UGENT),WE THANK THE SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM THE BELGIAN SCIENCE POLICY OFFICE (BELSPO; GRANT BR/132/A1/BELBEES) AND THE SPECIAL RESEARCH FUND OF GHENT UNIVERSITY (BOF-UGENT).,0171-8177,2,151-155,E SCHWEIZERBARTSCHE VERLAGSBUCHHANDLUNG,39,2019,ISI000494279500009,28,ENTOMOLOGY,11,ENTOMOLOGY,TIZICLAUVIS.TANINGNJIUGENT.BE GUY.SMAGGHEUGENT.BE,JJ6QI,"TANING, CNT, SMAGGHE, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GHENT, FAC BIOSCI ENGN, DEPT PLANTS \& CROPS, COUPURE LINKS 653, B-9000 GHENT, BELGIUM",ISI,none,UNIV GHENT,UNIV GHENT,NA,"TANING CNT, 2019, ENTOMOL GEN","TANING CNT, 2019, ENTOMOL GEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

KANS. ENTOMOL. SOC.,"MEASURING SHIFTING PATTERNS OF OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE AMONG MEMBERS OF POLLINATOR GUILDS IS CRITICAL FOR STUDIES OF THEIR ECOLOGY, CONSERVATION AND CONTRIBUTION TO HOST POLLINATION. THE CONSTITUTION OF FLORAL BEE GUILDS IS NOT READILY INTERPRETED FROM PASSIVE SAMPLING OF BEE COMMUNITIES (E.G., PAN OR MALAISE TRAPS). NET COLLECTING AT FLOWERS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATES BEE AND FLOWERING SPECIES, BUT DO SAMPLING BIASES OF INDIVIDUAL NET COLLECTORS OBSCURE REAL SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS IN FLORAL GUILDS OF BEES, OR GENERATE SPURIOUS DIFFERENCES WHERE NO CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED? THE DIVERSE GUILD OF BEES FORAGING AT 1-HA PLOTS OF CREOSOTE BUSH (LARREA TRIDENTATA) WAS SYSTEMATICALLY NET SAMPLED BY PRACTICED COLLECTORS ALONG RANDOMIZED BELT TRANSECTS ACROSS THE CHIHUAHUAN, SONORAN AND MOJAVE DESERTS. THESE GUILD SAMPLES WERE COMPARED BY HORN'S INDEX OF SIMILARITY, EVALUATING THE MAGNITUDE OF COLLECTOR BIASES CONTRASTED WITH GEOGRAPHICAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY IN GUILD COMPOSITION. SIMULTANEOUS SAMPLES TAKEN BY SEVERAL COLLECTORS WERE ALWAYS MORE SIMILAR THAN THOSE BY THE SAME COLLECTOR IN SEQUENTIAL YEARS AT A SITE (0.86 VS. 0.54) OR CONCURRENTLY AT NEIGHBORING SITES (0.84 VS. 0.61). POOLING COLLECTORS' SITE SAMPLES DID NOT ALTER SPATIOTEMPORAL ESTIMATES OF GUILD SIMILARITY. REPEATED SEASONAL SAMPLES BY THREE COLLECTORS AT ONE SITE WERE VERY SIMILAR FOR ANY GIVEN DAY (0.90) WITH THE MORE EXPERIENCED PAIR BEING PARTICULARLY CONSISTENT AND SIMILAR (0.96 +/- 0.01). SEASONAL CHANGES OF THE GUILD WERE READILY DETECTED AND QUANTIFIED. THUS, AERIAL NET SAMPLING PROVIDED RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF THE LARREA BEE GUILDS ONCE THE SAMPLING PROTOCOL HAD BEEN PRACTICED. WE RECOMMEND SYSTEMATIC AERIAL NET COLLECTING OF POLLINATORS AT COUNTED FLORAL HOST PLANTS TO QUICKLY AND RELIABLY CHARACTERIZE POLLINATOR GUILDS QUANTITATIVELY. SYSTEMATIC NET SAMPLING OF BEES TAKEN AT A SEQUENCE OF RANDOMLY CHOSEN INDIVIDUALS OF A GIVEN FLOWERING SPECIES OFFERS A RELIABLE AND REPLICABLE MEANS OF EFFICIENTLY QUANTIFYING VARIABILITY AND CHANGE IN SUCH FLORAL GUILDS OF BEES.

ECOL.,"SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS ARE RICH IN BIODIVERSITY AND THUS IMPORTANT HABITATS FOR CONSERVATION, YET THEY ARE EXPERIENCING RAPID DECLINES DUE TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND ABANDONMENT. PROMOTING A MORE DIVERSE MAMMALIAN HERBIVORE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING LARGE AND MEGAHERBIVORES, MAY RESULT IN POSITIVE CASCADE EFFECTS FOR BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. THEREFORE, REINTRODUCING AN ECOLOGICALLY FUNCTIONAL SUBSTITUTE OF AN EXTINCT LARGE HERBIVORE COULD MITIGATE CURRENT BIODIVERSITY DECLINES AND FOSTER SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND CONSERVATION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE SET UP A 3-YEAR REWILDING EXPERIMENT WHERE 12 FERAL HORSES WERE INTRODUCED IN THREE 10-HECTARE ENCLOSURE REPLICATES (FOUR HORSES PER ENCLOSURE). WE USED COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN PLANT FUNCTIONAL TRAITS TO ELUCIDATE PLANT COMMUNITY CHANGES INDUCED BY GRAZING THROUGH TIME. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THIS EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT ON INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS AND ON POLLINATOR HABITAT USE. THE GRASSLAND COMMUNITY EXERTED A MIXED TOLERANCE/AVOIDANCE RESPONSE TO GRAZING. THIS RESULTED IN PLANT FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITIONAL CHANGES WHICH FAVOURED PROSTRATE PLANT SPECIES WITH HIGHER SPECIFIC LEAF AREA, CHARACTERISTIC OF RUDERAL COMMUNITIES. PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER IN GRAZED COMPARED TO UNGRAZED AREAS. BUTTERFLY AND BUMBLEBEE HABITAT USE, AS WELL AS FEEDING AND RESTING ACTIVITIES WERE ALSO HIGHER IN GRAZED AREAS. MOREOVER, THE NUMBER OF POLLINATORS INCREASED WITH PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS.SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT, TO ENHANCE THE DIVERSITY OF A GIVEN HERBIVORE COMMUNITY WITH ECOLOGICAL REPLACEMENTS OF EXTINCT WILD HORSES CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF GRASSLANDS. IT CAN ALSO MITIGATE PLANT SPECIES DECLINES, IN PARTICULAR BEE-DEPENDENT PLANTS, AND BOOST POLLINATOR HABITAT USE. NOVEL MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO REVERSE THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF LAND ABANDONMENT IN EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THUS, REWILDING INTERVENTIONS WITH LARGE MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES MAY OFFSET CURRENT BIODIVERSITY DECLINES BY MAINTAINING IMPORTANT FUNCTIONAL LINKS BETWEEN PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IN GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS.

APPL. ECOL.,"AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO BIODIVERSITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASED LAND-USE INTENSITY, DECREASED LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND REDUCED HABITAT DIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE (GAMMA DIVERSITY), THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIFICATION HAVE BEEN ASSESSED PRIMARILY BY SPECIES RICHNESS AT A LOCAL SCALE (ALPHA DIVERSITY). THIS IGNORES SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES (BETA DIVERSITY), WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THIS STUDY, MEASURES OF LAND-USE INTENSITY, LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND HABITAT DIVERSITY WERE RELATED TO GAMMA, ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY OF WILD BEES (APOIDEA), CARABID BEETLES (CARABIDAE), HOVERFLIES (SYRPHIDAE), TRUE BUGS (HETEROPTERA) AND SPIDERS (ARANEAE) WITHIN 16 LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN 24 TEMPERATE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE TOTAL LANDSCAPE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL GROUPS WAS MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY INCREASED PROXIMITY OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. BEES ALSO DECREASED IN LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH INTENSITY OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT, DEMONSTRATING ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF BOTH FACTORS. SEPARATING TOTAL SPECIES DIVERSITY INTO COMPONENTS, THE DECREASE IN TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF ALL INVESTIGATED GROUPS DECREASED WITH INCREASING LAND-USE INTENSITY AND, IN THE CASE OF SPIDERS, DECREASING PROXIMITY OF THE SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. THE EFFECT OF INCREASED HABITAT DIVERSITY APPEARED TO BE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS BUT CAUSED A SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY TOWARDS THE LATTER. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL CHANGE OPERATE AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL AND THAT EXAMINING SPECIES DIVERSITY AT A LOCAL LEVEL FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. THE COINCIDENCE OF PATTERNS OF BETA DIVERSITY WITH THOSE OF GAMMA DIVERSITY EMPHASIZES THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF RESTORATION PROGRAMMES AIMING TO RESTORE SUSTAINABLE COUNTRYSIDE DIVERSITY.

CRESSWELL JE;HOYLE M,CRESSWELL JE,A MATHEMATICAL METHOD FOR ESTIMATING PATTERNS OF FLOWER-TO-FLOWER GENE DISPERSAL FROM A SIMPLE FIELD EXPERIMENT,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"1. POLLINATION IS A PRINCIPAL MEANS OF GENE DISPERSAL IN ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS. THEORETICALLY, GENE DISPERSAL CAN BE PREDICTED FROM POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PATTERNS OF FLOWER-TO-FLOWER GENE DISPERSAL, OR PATERNITY SHADOW, BUT QUANTIFYING THE PATERNITY SHADOW UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS IS PROBLEMATIC. 2. WE DEVELOPED A MATHEMATICAL METHOD TO QUANTIFY THE PATERNITY SHADOW FROM A SIMPLE FIELD EXPERIMENT BY INITIALLY STATING THE PROBLEM IN MATRIX ALGEBRA, THEN USING A LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION TO FIND THE PATERNITY SHADOW THAT BEST EXPLAINED THE OBSERVED SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF GENE DISPERSAL, GIVEN THE OBSERVED POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS. 3. WE APPLIED THE METHOD TO DATA ON THE DISPERSION OF A MARKER GENE ALONG ROWS OF OILSEED RAPE (BRASSICA NAPUS) POLLINATED BY BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) AND THEREBY PRODUCED THE FIRST FIELD-BASED PATERNITY SHADOW. WHEN COUPLED WITH OBSERVED MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLE BEES, THIS PATERNITY SHADOW EXPLAINED VIRTUALLY ALL (R(2)=90\%) OF THE DISPERSION OF THE MARKER GENE. 4.

ECOL.,"BACKGROUND: INDIVIDUAL BEES EXHIBIT COMPLEX MOVEMENT PATTERNS TO EFFICIENTLY EXPLOIT SMALL AREAS WITHIN LARGER PLANT POPULATIONS. HOW SUCH INDIVIDUAL SPATIAL BEHAVIOURS SCALE UP TO THE COLLECTIVE LEVEL, WHEN SEVERAL FORAGERS VISIT A COMMON AREA, HAS REMAINED CHALLENGING TO INVESTIGATE, BOTH BECAUSE OF THE LOW RESOLUTION OF FIELD MOVEMENT DATA AND THE LIMITED POWER OF THE STATISTICAL DESCRIPTORS TO ANALYSE THEM. TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES WE VIDEO RECORDED ALL FLOWER VISITS (N=6205), AND EVERY INTERACTION ON FLOWERS (N=628), INVOLVING FORAGERS FROM A BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) COLONY IN A LARGE OUTDOOR FLIGHT CAGE (880 M(2)), CONTAINING TEN ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS, COLLECTED ON FIVE CONSECUTIVE DAYS, AND ANALYSED BEE MOVEMENTS USING NETWORKS STATISTICS. RESULTS: BEE-FLOWER VISITATION NETWORKS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MODULAR THAN EXPECTED BY CHANCE, INDICATING THAT FORAGERS MINIMIZED OVERLAPS IN THEIR PATTERNS OF FLOWER VISITS. RESOURCE PARTITIONING EMERGED FROM DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING EXPERIENCE AMONG BEES, AND FROM OUTCOMES OF THEIR INTERACTIONS ON FLOWERS. LESS EXPERIENCED FORAGERS SHOWED LOWER ACTIVITY AND WERE MORE FAITHFUL TO SOME FLOWERS, WHEREAS MORE EXPERIENCED FORAGERS EXPLORED THE FLOWER ARRAY MORE EXTENSIVELY. FURTHERMORE, BEES AVOIDED RETURNING TO FLOWERS FROM WHICH THEY HAD RECENTLY BEEN DISPLACED BY A NESTMATE, SUGGESTING THAT BEES INTEGRATE MEMORIES OF PAST INTERACTIONS INTO THEIR FORAGING DECISIONS. CONCLUSION: OUR OBSERVATIONS, UNDER HIGH LEVELS OF COMPETITION IN A FLIGHT CAGE, SUGGEST THAT THE CONTINUOUS TURNOVER OF FORAGERS OBSERVED IN COLONIES CAN LED TO EFFICIENT RESOURCE PARTITIONING AMONG BEES IN NATURAL CONDITIONS.",BIPARTITE NETWORKS; BUMBLE BEES; MODULARITY; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; RESOURCE PARTITIONING; SOCIAL INTERACTIONS,INFLORESCENCE SIZE; NECTAR PRODUCTION; BEES; OPTIMIZATION; POLLINATORS; MODULARITY; VISITORS; BEHAVIOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"PASQUARETTA, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PAUL SABATIER, CTR INTEGRAT BIOL CBI, RES CTR ANIM COGNIT CRCA, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.;PASQUARETTA, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PAUL SABATIER, CNRS, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.;PASQUARETTA, CRISTIAN, JEANSON, RAPHAEL, LIHOREAU, MATHIEU, UNIV PAUL SABATIER, CTR INTEGRAT BIOL CBI, RES CTR ANIM COGNIT CRCA, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.;PASQUARETTA, CRISTIAN, JEANSON, RAPHAEL, LIHOREAU, MATHIEU, UNIV PAUL SABATIER, CNRS, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.;PANSANEL, JEROME, CNRS, INST PLURIDISCIPLINAIRE HUBERT CURIEN, STRASBOURG, FRANCE.;RAINE, NIGEL E., ROYAL HOLLOWAY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL SCI, EGHAM TW20 0EX, SURREY, ENGLAND.;RAINE, NIGEL E., UNIV GUELPH, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, GUELPH, ON N1G 2W1, CANADA.;CHITTKA, LARS, QUEEN MARY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL \& CHEM SCI, DEPT BIOL \& EXPT PSYCHOL, MILE END RD, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND.;CHITTKA, LARS, INST ADV STUDY, WISSENSCH KOLLEG, WALLOTSTR 19, D-14193 BERLIN, GERMANY.",10.1186/S40462-019-0150-Z,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",4,WELLCOME TRUSTWELLCOME TRUST; BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCILBIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBSRC); ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCILENGINEERING \& PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) [BB/F52765X/1]; EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCILEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC); FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF TOULOUSE (IDEX UNITI); W.

BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: NECTAR IS THE MOST COMMON REWARD PROVIDED BY ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERS. DIVERSITY IN POSITION AND STRUCTURE OF FLORAL NECTARIES SUGGESTS THAT FLORAL NECTAR PRODUCTION EVOLVED REPEATEDLY, BUT THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGINS ARE NOT WELL KNOWN. FLOWERS OF THE GENUS MACARANGA (EUPHORBIACEAE) ARE APETALOUS AND LACK FLORAL NECTAR. NEVERTHELESS, MANY MACARANGA SPECIES POSSESS DISK-SHAPED NECTARIES ON THEIR LEAVES, SOUGHT BY ANTS THAT DEFEND PLANTS FROM HERBIVORY. IN SOME MACARANGA SPECIES, SIMILAR GLANDS ALSO OCCUR ON THE BRACTEOLES-MODIFIED LEAVES SUBTENDING THE FLOWERS. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THESE GLANDS ON THE BRACTEOLES OF M. SINENSIS ARE INVOLVED IN POLLINATION. METHODS: FLOWER VISITORS WERE CAPTURED, AND BODY POLLEN WAS EXAMINED. THE BEHAVIOR OF FLOWER VISITORS ON INFLORESCENCES WAS ALSO OBSERVED. SUGAR COMPOSITION OF THE NECTAR FROM BRACTEOLES AND LEAVES WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED USING HIGH-PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. KEY RESULTS: VARIOUS BEES AND FLIES WITH BODY POLLEN VISITED BOTH MALE AND FEMALE INFLORESCENCES, FEEDING ON NECTAR FROM THE BRACTEOLES AND TOUCHING ANTHERS AND STIGMAS IN THE PROCESS. SUGAR COMPOSITION OF NECTAR FROM THE BRACTEOLES AND THE LEAVES DID NOT DIFFER. CONCLUSIONS: MACARANGA SINENSIS WAS POLLINATED BY INSECTS FORAGING ON THE DISK-SHAPED NECTARIES ON BRACTEOLES. THE SIMILAR APPEARANCE, POSITION, AND SUGAR COMPOSITION OF NECTAR SUGGEST THAT DISK-SHAPED NECTARIES ON BRACTEOLES AND LEAVES ARE HOMOLOGOUS AND THAT NECTARIES ON LEAVES WERE RECRUITED TO INFLORESCENCES TO SERVE FLORAL FUNCTION IN M.

A NEW INFLORESCENCE BALL FORMED EACH YEAR WITH DEVELOPING FRUITS THAT WERE INITIATED THE PREVIOUS YEAR, THUS REPRODUCTION IS A CONTINUOUS CYCLE. THE TOTAL POLLEN PRODUCTION WITHIN A TREE RANGED BETWEEN 4.0X10(7) AND 9.3X10(7). ANTHESIS PEAKED BETWEEN 08:00 AND 10:00. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION ON ANTHESIS (F=243.8, P=3.01). A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF LATERAL SHOOTS AND TOTAL INFLORESCENCE SHOWED THAT THE INFLORESCENCE PRODUCTION IN C.

CONSERV.,"ACROSS N.W. EUROPE INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT HAS INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY TO THE DETRIMENT OF FLORAL RESOURCES VITAL FOR INSECT POLLINATORS LIKE BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES. WHILE THE CREATION OF WILDFLOWER HABITATS HAS BEEN WIDELY USED TO RE-ESTABLISH SUCH RESOURCES INTO ARABLE ECOSYSTEMS (E.G. SOWN INTO FIELD MARGINS), COMPARABLE LOW COST METHODS FOR ENHANCING FLORISTIC DIVERSITY IN PRODUCTION GRASSLANDS ARE LACKING. WE INVESTIGATED HOW SIMPLE AND CHEEP SEED MIXTURES BASED AROUND THREE PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (GRASSES, LEGUMES AND NON-LEGUMINOUS FORBS) COULD BE USED TO ENHANCE FLOWERING RESOURCES TO BENEFIT INSECT POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES OVER A FOUR YEAR PERIOD. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS WAS CORRELATED WITH THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF LEGUME AND NON-LEGUME FORB FLOWERS. WHILE THE FLOWERING RESOURCES PROVIDED BY AGRICULTURAL CULTIVARS OF LEGUMES DECLINED RAPIDLY ONCE SOWN, THE INCLUSION OF A FORB COMPONENT WITHIN SEED MIXTURES WAS EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING THE LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE OF THESE RESOURCES. AS A RESULT THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF INSECT POLLINATORS OVER THE FOUR YEARS SHOWED GREATER STABILITY WHERE FORBS WERE ALSO SOWN. SWARD MANAGEMENT ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN THE PERSISTENCE OF FLORAL RESOURCES, WITH GRAZING MORE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN LEGUME COVER THAN CUTTING. IN CONCLUSION, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT LOW COST SEED MIXTURES CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE FLORISTIC DIVERSITY TO BENEFIT POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH THE CONTINUED VALUE OF THESE GRASSLANDS OVER TIME IS DEPENDENT ON COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN SOWN LEGUMES AND FORBS. AS PERMANENT GRASSLAND COVERS C. 40\% OF THE UK THE ENHANCEMENT OF THEIR FLORISTIC DIVERSITY HAS A HUGE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT INSECT POLLINATORS. THE TYPE OF LAND SHARING APPROACHES SUGGESTED HERE MAINTAIN MODEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND SO MAY BE THE MOST LIKELY TO ACHIEVE BENEFIT TO POLLINATORS THROUGH WIDE-SCALE FARMER UPTAKE.

HYMENOPT. RES.,"OSMIA PILICORNIS IS DISTRIBUTED FROM WESTERN TEMPERATE EUROPE TO WESTERN SIBERIA, WHERE IT EXCLUSIVELY OCCURS IN OPEN-STRUCTURED, MESOPHILOUS AND MAINLY DECIDUOUS WOODLAND BELOW 1000 M A.S.L. IN CENTRAL EUROPE, ITS PEAK ACTIVITY RANGES FROM THE LAST THIRD OF MARCH TO THE FIRST THIRD OF JUNE. DUE TO ITS RARITY AND ITS LOW POPULATION DENSITIES OVER MOST OF ITS RANGE, THE BIOLOGY OF O. PILICORNIS WAS ONLY FRAGMENTARILY KNOWN. THE DISCOVERY OF SIX NESTS IN THE COURSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY REVEALED THAT FEMALES OF O. PILICORNIS HAVE A UNIQUE NESTING BEHAVIOUR AMONG THE OSMIINE BEES: THEY GNAW THEIR NESTS IN DEAD WOOD WITH THE AID OF THEIR STRONG MANDIBLES, WHICH HAVE A PECULIAR CHISEL-LIKE SHAPE HYPOTHESIZED TO BE AN ADAPTATION TO THE SPECIES' SPECIALIZED NESTING BEHAVIOUR. ALL SIX NESTS WERE IN DEAD FALLEN BRANCHES OF DIFFERENT TREE AND SHRUB SPECIES AND OF VARYING WOOD HARDNESS. THE NESTING BRANCHES HAD A DIAMETER OF 1.5-6.1 CM, LAY ON SUN-EXPOSED GROUND AND WERE LARGELY HIDDEN UNDER VEGETATION. THE NESTS CONTAINED ONE TO THREE LINEARLY ARRANGED BROOD CELLS. BOTH CELL PARTITIONS AND NEST PLUG WERE BUILT FROM CHEWED LEAVES HARVESTED FROM FRAGARIA VESCA. OSMIA PILICORNIS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEW HOST OF THE CHRYSIDID WASP CHRYSURA HIRSUTA, AND THE ICHNEUMONID WASP HOPLOCRYPTUS CONFECTOR DEVELOPED IN ITS NESTS. MICROSCOPICAL ANALYSIS OF SCOPAL POLLEN LOADS OF COLLECTED FEMALES REVEALED THAT POLLEN IS MAINLY COLLECTED FROM THREE PLANT TAXA, I.E. PULMONARIA (BORAGINACEAE), FABACEAE (E.G. LATHYRUS, VICIA) AND LAMIACEAE (E.G. AJUGA, GLECHOMA). ON FLOWERS OF PULMONARIA, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLEN HOST OVER MOST OF THE SPECIES' RANGE, THE FEMALES USE SPECIALIZED BRISTLES ON THEIR PROBOSCIS TO BRUSH POLLEN OUT OF THE NARROW COROLLA TUBE, THEY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXPLOIT POLLEN-RICH FLOWERS IN THE EARLY RED STAGE AND THEY OFTEN STEAL POLLEN FROM STILL CLOSED FLOWERS BY FORCEFULLY OPENING BUDS. ON THEIR SEARCH FOR FEMALES, MALES OF O. PILICORNIS PATROL FLOWERS OF PULMONARIA IN A RAPID FLIGHT REGULARLY INTERRUPTED BY SHORT RESTING PERIODS ON THE GROUND. FEMALES ARE GRASPED FOR COPULATION BOTH DURING FLOWER VISITS AND IN FLIGHT BETWEEN THE FLOWERS. THE WIDE SPECTRUM OF SEMI-OPEN MESOPHILOUS WOODLAND TYPES COLONIZED BY O. PILICORNIS SUGGESTS THAT DEAD FALLEN BRANCHES AND A RICH SPRING FLORA IN COMBINATION WITH A RATHER WARM BUT NOT XERIC MICROCLIMATE ARE THE ONLY REQUISITES NEEDED BY THE SPECIES. AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WOODLAND HABITATS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY O. PILICORNIS IN CENTRAL EUROPE OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO HUMAN FOREST USE, THE RECENT DECLINE OF O. PILICORNIS IN MANY REGIONS OF EUROPE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY CHANGES IN WOODLAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES LEADING TO CLOSED AND DARK FORESTS NOT SUITABLE AS HABITATS FOR THIS SPECIALIZED BEE SPECIES.",APIFORMES; CHRYSURA HIRSUTA; DEAD WOOD; HOPLOCRYPTUS CONFECTOR; PULMONARIA; NESTING BEHAVIOUR; OPEN-STRUCTURED WOODLAND,FLORAL COLOR-CHANGE; MORPHOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS; POLLEN; APOIDEA; BORAGINACEAE; FLOWERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"MULLER, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;PROSI, RAINER, LERCHENSTR 81, D-74564 CRAILSHEIM, GERMANY.;WIESBAUER, HEINZ, KAUNITZGASSE 33-14, A-1060 VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;MUELLER, ANDREAS, SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",10.3897/JHR.52.10441,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",NA,NA,NA,1070-9428,NA,1-36,PENSOFT PUBL,52,2016,ISI000387755500001,80,ENTOMOLOGY,7,ENTOMOLOGY,ANDREAS.MUELLERUSYS.ETHZ.CH,EB9YY,"MULLER, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",ISI,none,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,NOTDECLARED,NA,"PROSI R, 2016, J HYMENOPT RES","PROSI R, 2016, J HYMENOPT RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jon Koch

HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONAL HETEROGENEITY OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT HABITAT PATCHES CAN PROVIDE TO SPECIES, HAS RARELY BEEN STUDIED. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE-SCALE NEST AVAILABILITY PROVIDED BY PERMANENT GRASSLANDS ON WILD BEE COMMUNITIES. WILD BEES WERE SAMPLED IN 43 CEREAL FIELDS IN SOUTH-WESTERN FRANCE DIFFERING IN THE SURROUNDING PROPORTION OF PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. USING REMOTE SENSING TOOLS, WE MEASURED TWO PARAMETERS OF GRASSLAND STRUCTURE KNOWN TO LOCALLY INFLUENCE BEE NEST DENSITY (SLOPE AND PROPORTION OF SPARSE VEGETATION). WE FOUND THAT MEAN SLOPE OF SURROUNDING GRASSLANDS WAS THE FACTOR THAT MOST POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BEE RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE AND TRAIT DISTRIBUTION IN BEE COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT MEAN SLOPE OF SURROUNDING GRASSLANDS HAD A BETTER PREDICTIVE POWER OF BEE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE THAN THE PROPORTION OF PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. GROUND-NESTING SPECIES, SPECIES WITH HIGH DISPERSAL CAPACITIES AND SPECIES WITH A GENERALIST DIET WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF SLOPED GROUND IN THE SURROUNDING PERMANENT GRASSLANDS. ONLY BEE SPECIES WITH SPECIALIZED FLOWER REQUIREMENTS RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE PROPORTION OF SPARSE VEGETATION IN GRASSLANDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LANDSCAPE-SCALE AVAILABILITY OF NESTING RESOURCES PROVIDED BY GRASSLANDS AFFECTS BEE COMMUNITIES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES AND CAN HELP SUSTAIN FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE BEE ASSEMBLAGES.

HOWEVER, THE FLORAL FEATURES IN THE SPECIES OF THE GROUP HAVE RARELY BEEN STUDIED, HINDERING THE UNDERSTANDING OF FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF PARTICULAR FLORAL ATTRIBUTES IN RELATION TO THE BIOLOGY. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THE FLORAL BIOLOGY AND POLLINATION OF ANGOSTURA BRACTEATA AND CONCHOCARPUS MACROPHYLLUS (GALIPEINAE), WHICH ARE CO-FLOWERING AND SYMPATRIC SPECIES OCCURRING IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST OF SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. BOTH SPECIES HAVE TUBULAR, NECTAR-REWARDING, MONOSYMMETRIC FLOWERS, WITH TWO FERTILE STAMENS ON THE POSTERIOR SIDE OF THE FLOWER AND FIVE ANTERIOR STAMINODES. C. MACROPHYLLUS IS MOST FREQUENTLY POLLINATED BY BUTTERFLIES AND LESS FREQUENTLY POLLINATED BY MEDIUM-SIZED BEES. A. BRACTEATA IS ALSO FREQUENTLY POLLINATED BY BUTTERFLIES, SHARED, IN PART WITH C MACROPHYLLUS, AND LESS FREQUENTLY POLLINATED BY SETTLING MOTHS AND BY HUMMINGBIRDS. SINCE WE FOUND THAT BUTTERFLIES TRANSFER THE POLLEN GRAINS OF C MACROPHYLLUS AND A. BRACTEATA THROUGH DIFFERENT BODY PARTS, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN MIXTURE OCCURS, DESPITE POLLINATOR SHARING. ALTHOUGH FUNCTIONALLY GENERALIZED, MOST FLORAL FEATURES INDICATE SPECIALIZATION FOR POLLINATION BY LEPIDOPTERANS IN BOTH SPECIES. SO, THE RELATED FLORAL ATTRIBUTES CONSIST OF A LONG AND NARROW FLORAL TUBE, AS WELL AS DELICATE LANDING PLATFORMS, AND NECTARIES THAT PRODUCE MINUTE QUANTITIES OF DILUTE NECTAR, AMONG OTHERS. FUNCTIONAL STAMINODES PRESENTING POLLEN SECONDARILY IN THE VENTRAL REGION OF THE FLOWER IN A. BRACTEATA ARE HEREIN REPORTED FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR RUTACEAE, WHICH RESULTS IN A WIDER SPATIAL PRESENTATION OF POLLEN AND MAY ALSO INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF STERNOTRIBIC POLLINATION. IN C. MACROPHYLLUS, THE STAMINODES BEAR POLLEN-COLLECTING HAIRS, WHICH MAY AVOID SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION OR SERVE TO SCRAPE POLLEN FROM THE TONGUES OF POLLINATORS.

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION INFLUENCES GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS, ESPECIALLY ACROSS A NARROW GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. HERE, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT FLORAL SIZE VARIATION IN THE JAPANESE HERB PRUNELLA VULGARIS L. (LAMIACEAE) IS AFFECTED BY GEOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT POLLINATOR SIZES REFLECTING DIFFERENT POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES. TO EVALUATE THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE POSED TWO QUESTIONS. (1) IS THERE A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN FLORAL LENGTH AND THE PROBOSCIS LENGTH OF POLLINATORS (BUMBLEBEES) ACROSS ALTITUDE IN A MOUNTAIN RANGE? (2) DOES THE FLOWER-POLLINATOR SIZE MATCH INFLUENCE FEMALE AND MALE PLANT FITNESS? WE FOUND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE ASSEMBLAGE OF POLLINATORS OF P.VULGARIS ALONG AN ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT, AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE MEAN POLLINATOR PROBOSCIS LENGTH ALSO CHANGED ALTITUDINALLY. THE FLORAL COROLLA LENGTH OF P.VULGARIS ALSO VARIED ALONG AN ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT, AND THIS VARIATION STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH THE LOCAL POLLINATOR SIZE BUT DID NOT CORRELATE WITH ALTITUDE ITSELF. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT THE SIZE MATCH BETWEEN THE FLORAL COROLLA LENGTH AND BEE PROBOSCIS LENGTH AFFECTED FEMALE AND MALE PLANT FITNESS AND THE OPTIMAL SIZE MATCH (ASSOCIATED WITH PEAK FITNESS) WAS SIMILAR FOR THE FEMALE AND MALE FITNESS.

PESTICIDES AND PATHOGENS ARE SUGGESTED TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN RECENT DECLINES OF SEVERAL WILD BEE POLLINATORS. COMPROMISED IMMUNITY FROM EXPOSURE TO WIDELY USED NEONICOTINOIDS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN HONEYBEES, BUT FURTHER RESEARCH ON INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NEONICOTINOIDS AND IMMUNITY IN OTHER IMPORTANT BEES IS LACKING. IN THIS STUDY, ADULT WORKERS OF THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS IMPATIENS RECEIVED 6-DAY PULSES OF EITHER LOW (0.7 PPB) OR HIGH (7 PPB) FIELD REALISTIC DOSES OF THE NEONICOTINOID IMIDACLOPRID PRIOR TO ASSAYING IMMUNITY AND SURVIVAL FOLLOWING A NONPATHOGENIC IMMUNE CHALLENGE. HIGH-DOSE IMIDACLOPRID EXPOSURE REDUCES CONSTITUTIVE LEVELS OF PHENOLOXIDASE, AN ENZYME INVOLVED IN MELANIZATION. HEMOLYMPH ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY INITIALLY INCREASES IN ALL GROUPS FOLLOWING AN IMMUNE CHALLENGE, BUT WHILE HEIGHTENED ACTIVITY IS MAINTAINED IN UNEXPOSED AND LOW IMIDACLOPRID DOSE GROUPS, IT IS NOT MAINTAINED IN THE HIGH EXPOSURE DOSE BEES, EVEN THOUGH EXPOSURE HAD CEASED 6 DAYS PRIOR. ADDITIONALLY, IMIDACLOPRID EXPOSURE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMUNE CHALLENGE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED SURVIVAL PROBABILITY RELATIVE TO CONTROL BEES AND THOSE ONLY IMMUNE CHALLENGED OR IMIDACLOPRID EXPOSED. A TEMPORAL LAG FOR IMMUNE MODULATION AND COMBINATORIAL EFFECTS ON SURVIVAL SUGGEST THAT RESOURCE-BASED TRADE-OFFS MAY, IN PART, CONTRIBUTE TO THE DETRIMENTAL INTERACTIONS.

VARIOUS MEASURES OF BRACT SIZE, HOWEVER, POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH THE NUMBER OF OPEN FLOWERS ON THE INFLORESCENCE, AND WITH THEIR NECTAR REWARDS.

DECREASING HABITAT QUALITY AND QUANTITY CAUSED BY FRAGMENTATION MAY LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND TO A REDUCTION IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANT SPECIES. WE CONDUCTED A 6-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SMALL-SCALE FRAGMENTATION ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE SELF-COMPATIBLE BETONICA OFFICINALIS. WE EXAMINED THE ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS, THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES AND THE PERFORMANCE, OUTCROSSING RATE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY OF B. OFFICINALIS AFTER 2 AND 6 YEARS IN EXPERIMENTALLY FRAGMENTED NUTRIENT-POOR, CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND IN THE NORTHERN SWISS JURA MOUNTAINS. FRAGMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZE (2.25 AND 20.25 M(2)) WERE ISOLATED BY A 5-M-WIDE STRIP OF FREQUENTLY MOWN VEGETATION. CONTROL PLOTS OF CORRESPONDING SIZE WERE SITUATED IN ADJACENT UNDISTURBED GRASSLAND. EXPERIMENTAL GRASSLAND FRAGMENTATION ALTERED THE COMPOSITION OF B. OFFICINALIS POLLINATORS AND REDUCED THEIR FLOWER VISITATION RATE. FURTHERMORE, THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES WAS CHANGED IN THE FRAGMENTS. AFTER 6 YEARS OF FRAGMENTATION SEED WEIGHT WAS HIGHER IN FRAGMENTS THAN IN CONTROL PLOTS. HOWEVER, THE DENSITIES OF B. OFFICINALIS ROSETTES AND INFLORESCENCES, PLANT HEIGHT AND INFLORESCENCE LENGTH WERE NOT AFFECTED BY FRAGMENTATION. THE OUTCROSSING FREQUENCY OF B. OFFICINALIS GROWING IN FRAGMENTS WAS REDUCED BY 15\% AFTER 2 YEARS AND BY 33\% AFTER 6 YEARS OF EXPERIMENTAL FRAGMENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE GENETIC DIVERSITY IN SEEDLINGS EMERGING IN FRAGMENTS AFTER 6 YEARS.

IN PLANTS, SELECTION TOWARDS EARLY FLOWERING IS COMMONLY OBSERVED. POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION IS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE A PERVASIVE EVOLUTIONARY FORCE ACTING DIRECTIONALLY ON FLOWERING TIME. HOWEVER, POLLINATOR-MEDIATED MECHANISMS HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN REALISTIC FIELD CONDITIONS, ESPECIALLY IN PERENNIAL PLANTS VISITED BY A DIVERSITY OF GENERALIST INSECT POLLINATORS. WE EXAMINED POLLINATOR VISITATION IN EIGHT ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA POPULATIONS IN WESTERN MINNESOTA, USA, TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL FOR POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION. ECHINACEA IS A COMMON PRAIRIE PERENNIAL THAT PERSISTS IN ISOLATED REMNANT POPULATIONS. ECHINACEA IS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND IS POLLINATED BY A DIVERSITY OF GENERALIST SOLITARY BEES. A PREVIOUS STUDY FOUND THAT EARLY FLOWERING ECHINACEA PLANTS HAVE HIGHER SEED SET AND THEIR REPRODUCTION IS LESS POLLEN-LIMITED THAN LATE FLOWERING PLANTS. TWELVE TIMES THROUGHOUT A FLOWERING SEASON, WE QUANTIFIED POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. IN THREE SITES, WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE QUALITY OF POLLINATOR VISITS BY EXAMINING THE COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS' POLLEN LOADS BROUGHT TO ECHINACEA PLANTS. WE FOUND THAT THREE ASPECTS OF POLLINATION DRAMATICALLY DECREASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE FLOWERING SEASON. 1) POLLINATORS VISITED EARLY FLOWERING PLANTS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN LATE FLOWERING PLANTS. 2) THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY WAS ALSO LESS DIVERSE LATE IN THE FLOWERING SEASON AND BECAME DOMINATED BY A SINGLE SPECIES OF SMALL BEE, AUGOCHLORELLA AURATA. 3) POLLINATORS VISITING ECHINACEA LATE IN THE SEASON CARRIED PROPORTIONALLY LESS CONSPECIFIC POLLEN COMPARED TO POLLINATORS VISITING ECHINACEA EARLY IN THE FLOWERING SEASON.

IN PREVIOUS STUDIES WITH THE MONTANE PLANT IPOMOPSIS AGGREGATA, WE DOCUMENTED POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION ON SEVERAL ASPECTS OF FLORAL FORM, INCLUDING FLOWER WIDTH. THIS CHARACTER VARIES CONTINUOUSLY WITHIN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF I. AGGREGATA, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH WIDER FLOWERS EXPORT MORE POLLEN PER FLOWER TO SURROUNDING PLANTS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT THIS COMPONENT OF PHENOTYPIC SELECTION IS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PER-VISIT EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMMINGBIRDS, THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATOR IN OUR STUDY POPULATIONS. HERE WE INVESTIGATE MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENTIAL VISIT EFFECTIVENESS IN GREATER DETAIL. FIRST, COUNTS OF POLLEN IN UNVISITED FLOWERS SHOWED THAT POLLEN PRODUCTION ITSELF INCREASES WITH WIDTH. IN AVIARY EXPERIMENTS, HUMMINGBIRDS ALSO REMOVED A GREATER PROPORTION OF AVAILABLE POLLEN AS WIDTH INCREASED. WE NEXT VIDEOTAPED VISITS TO FLOWERS THAT VARIED IN WIDTH EITHER NATURALLY, OR BY EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT, AND FOUND THAT HUMMINGBIRDS INSERTED THEIR BILLS MORE DEEPLY INTO WIDER FLOWERS. FINALLY, WE DIRECTLY MANIPULATED HOW DEEPLY BIRDS COULD INSERT THEIR BILLS, AND FOUND THAT MORE POLLEN WAS REMOVED AFTER DEEP INSERTION. THUS, SEVERAL MECHANISMS APPEAR TO UNDERLIE SELECTION ON COROLLA WIDTH VIA VISIT EFFECTIVENESS IN POLLEN EXPORT. ONE INVOLVES A PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION WITH POLLEN PRODUCTION, THIS UNDERSCORES THE VALUE OF EXPERIMENTS FOR UNTANGLING INDIRECT FROM DIRECT SELECTION.

IN THIS ARTICLE WE SHOW THAT N. CLAVIPES SPIN SILKS OF VARYING SPECTRAL PROPERTIES IN RESPONSE TO BOTH THE INTENSITY AND SPECTRAL COMPOSITION OF ITS LIGHT ENVIRONMENT. IN BRIGHT LIGHT CHARACTERIZED BY BROAD IRRADIANCE SPECTRA, N. CLAVIPES PRODUCE A COMPLEX OF YELLOW PIGMENTS THAT ABSORB LIGHT OF WAVELENGTHS LESS THAN 500 NM, MAKING THEIR WEBS APPEAR GOLDEN. IN DIM LIGHT AND WHERE WAVELENGTHS LESS THAN 500 NM HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED, N. CLAVIPES PRODUCE PIGMENTS THAT REFLECT LIGHT BETWEEN 400 AND 500 NM, MAKING THEIR WEBS APPEAR WHITE. BECAUSE YELLOW SERVES AS A SUPERSTIMULUS ATTRACTING BOTH HERBIVOROUS AND POLLINATING INSECTS, YELLOW SILKS MAY ATTRACT PREY TO SPIDER WEBS. BY TRAINING TRIGONA FLUVIVENTRIS, A STINGLESS BEE COMMONLY FED ON BY N. CLAVIPES, TO FORAGE AT AN ARTIFICIAL FEEDING SITE, WE FOUND THAT SILK COLOR AFFECTS INSECT RESPONSE IN TWO WAYS.

THE EMERGENCE OF CLEPTOPARASITISM AND SPECIATION IN THIS INSULAR SITUATION ARE DISCUSSED. THE CLEPTOPARASITISM OF THIS NEW SUBGENUS PARACHILALICTUS N. SUBG.

HERE WE STUDIED THE RELEVANCE OF FLORAL SCENT AND VISUAL DISPLAY OF A NIGHT BLOOMING, PUTATIVELY HAWKMOTH-POLLINATED PLANT OENOTHERA ACAULIS (ONAGRACEAE) IN THE ATTRACTION OF NON-NATIVE COCKROACHES BLATTA ORIENTALIS (BLATTODEA: BLATTIDAE), WHICH FUNCTION AS FACULTATIVE FLORAL LARCENISTS IN COASTAL HABITATS OF CENTRAL CHILE. WE EXPERIMENTALLY DECOUPLED VISUAL (COROLLA) AND OLFACTORY (FRAGRANCE) STIMULI BY PRESENTING PAPER COROLLAS AND GREEN MESH BAGS, WITH OR WITHOUT A FRESHLY-PICKED NATURAL FLOWER INSIDE. WE THEN CONTRASTED THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES OF ROACHES IN THESE TREATMENTS WITH THOSE TO THE NATURAL COMBINATION OF TRAITS IN ACTUAL FLOWERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTROL TREATMENTS, MEASURING THE ROACHES' FREQUENCY OF FIRST VISITS, MEAN AND TOTAL RESIDENCE TIME SPENT IN EACH TREATMENT. THE ROACHES PRIMARILY USED OLFACTORY CUES WHEN APPROACHING O. ACAULIS FLOWERS AT TWO BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SPATIAL SCALES. IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF CONSPECIFIC ROACHES HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON RECRUITMENT TO THE EXPERIMENTAL ARENA, INCREASING THE STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES AMONG TREATMENTS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST A PRIMACY OF FLORAL FRAGRANCE OVER VISUAL STIMULI IN THE FORAGING RESPONSES OF B. ORIENTALIS. OLFACTORY CUES WERE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE ROACHES, AND THE VISUAL CUES PRESENTED IN OUR MANIPULATIONS ONLY MARGINALLY INCREASED THEIR ATTRACTION WITHIN A 20 CM DIAMETER OF THE STIMULUS. THE FULL SPECTRUM OF FLORAL VISITATION BEHAVIOR WAS NOT ELICITED BY THE ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS, SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TACTILE OR CONTACT CHEMOSENSORY STIMULI NOT PROVIDED BY PAPER. ALTHOUGH THE NITROGENOUS SCENT COMPOUNDS THAT WE FOUND IN O. ACAULIS FLOWERS ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FOUND IN HAWKMOTH-POLLINATED FLOWERS, THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THESE COMPOUNDS TO A NON-NATIVE, FACULTATIVE FLOWER-VISITING INSECT INDICATES THAT THEY DO NOT FUNCTION AS POLLINATOR-SPECIFIC SIGNALS FOR HAWKMOTH ATTRACTION [CURRENT ZOOLOGY 57 (2): 162-174, 2011].",FLOWER FRAGRANCE; COROLLA VISUAL DISPLAY; LARCENISTS; NIGHT-BLOOMING PLANTS,MANDUCA-SEXTA; VISUAL CUES; PERIPLANETA-AMERICANA; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; OLFACTORY CUES; BUMBLE BEES; PLANT; BEHAVIOR; SCENT; COLOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"VILLAGRA, CA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CHILE, IEB, SANTIAGO, CHILE.;VERGARA, RODRIGO C., TORRES-ARANEDA, ALEJANDRA, ARROYO, MARY T.

FOR EFFICIENT CONSERVATION OF RARE SPECIES, KNOWLEDGE ON REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY AND POLLINATORS IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE. IN OUR STUDY WE FOCUSED ON UEBELMANNIA BUININGII DONALD, A MICROENDEMIC CACTUS FROM THE SERRA NEGRA STATE PARK, MINAS GERAIS STATE, BRAZIL. DURING FOUR FIELD EXPEDITIONS TO THREE LOCALITIES OF THE SPECIES BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND SEPTEMBER 2013, WE MEASURED FLOWERS, DETECTED NECTAR-GUIDES AND OSMOPHORES AND PERFORMED POLLEN VIABILITY TESTS. WE STUDIED THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM OF THE SPECIES USING MANUAL SELF- AND CROSS-POLLINATION TESTS AND OBSERVED POLLINATORS. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE FLOWERING PERIOD TAKES PLACE DURING THE DRY SEASON, BETWEEN APRIL AND OCTOBER, AND THAT THE DIURNAL FLOWERS OPEN BETWEEN 7:00 A.M. AND 5 P.M. THE FLOWERS ARE SHORTLY TUBULAR WITH YELLOW PERIANTH-SEGMENTS. WE FOUND NEITHER NECTAR NOR NECTAR-GUIDES, AND OSMOPHORES APPEARED AS GLANDS WITHIN THE FLOWER TUBE. WHEREAS POLLEN VIABILITY WAS 90.25\%, MANUAL CROSS-POLLINATION TESTS HAVE SHOWN CROSS-POLLINATION WITH GAMETOPHYTIC INCOMPATIBILITY.

THIS WORK PRESENTS, FOR THE FIRST TIME, DATA ON THE OCCURRENCE AND FREQUENCY OF PLANT SEXUAL SYSTEMS FOR CAATINGA COMMUNITIES, AND A REVIEW OF THE BREEDING SYSTEM STUDIES OF CAATINGA SPECIES. METHODS THE SEXUAL SYSTEMS OF 147 SPECIES FROM 34 FAMILIES AND 91 GENERA OCCURRING IN THREE CAATINGA AREAS IN NORTH-EASTERN BRAZIL WERE ANALYSED AND COMPARED WITH WORLDWIDE STUDIES FOCUSING ON REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF DIFFERENT TROPICAL COMMUNITIES. KEY RESULTS THE FREQUENCY OF HERMAPHRODITE SPECIES WAS 83(.)0\% (122 SPECIES), SEVEN OF THESE (OR 4(.)8\% OF THE TOTAL) BEING HETEROSTYLOUS. MONOECY OCCURRED IN 9(.)5\% (14) OF THE SPECIES, AND ANDROMONOECY IN 4(.)8\% (SEVEN). ONLY 2(.)7\% (FOUR) OF THE SPECIES WERE DIOECIOUS. A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HERMAPHRODITE SPECIES WAS EXPECTED AND HAS BEEN REPORTED FOR OTHER TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS. WITH RESPECT TO THE BREEDING SYSTEM STUDIES WITH SPECIES OF THE CAATINGA, THE AUTHORS' DATA FOR 21 SPECIES AND AN ADDITIONAL 18 SPECIES STUDIED BY OTHERS (N=39) REVEALED A HIGH PERCENTAGE (61(.)5\%) OF OBLIGATORY SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY. AGAMOSPERMY WAS NOT RECORDED AMONG THE CAATINGA STUDIED SPECIES. CONCLUSIONS THE PLANT SEXUAL SYSTEMS IN THE CAATINGA, DESPITE THE SEMI-ARID CLIMATE, ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER TROPICAL DRY AND WET FOREST COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH HIGH RAINFALL LEVELS, EXCEPT FOR THE MUCH LOWER PERCENTAGE OF DIOECIOUS SPECIES.

THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AT LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE SCALES ON BEES IN CENTRAL HUNGARY. BEES WERE SAMPLED IN WINTER CEREAL FIELDS THAT VARIED IN THE AMOUNT OF APPLIED FERTILIZER AND INSECTICIDE USE. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED TOTAL, SMALL AND LARGE BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE, STABILITY OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE (COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION, CV), THE NITROGEN CONTENT OF FERTILIZERS, THE NUMBER OF INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS, WITHIN-FIELD LOCATION, SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF SEMI-NATURAL AREAS IN A 500-M RADIUS CIRCLE AROUND THE FIELDS UNDER STUDY. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF FERTILIZER DECREASED TOTAL AND SMALL BEE ABUNDANCE AND INCREASED THE CV OF TOTAL BEE ABUNDANCE. INSECTICIDE USE HAD A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TOTAL AND SMALL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ON LARGE BEE ABUNDANCE. THE PERCENTAGE OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN A 500-M RADIUS DID NOT INFLUENCE BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. THE RESULTS OBTAINED CONFIRMS THAT THE INTENSIFICATION OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT POSES A THREAT TO BEE DIVERSITY, AND THUS MAY REDUCE POLLINATION SERVICES.

SECOND, WE TESTED IF TRAITS RELATED TO MOBILITY AND DIET BREADTH COULD EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED EVENNESS PATTERNS. WE FOUND A CLEAR NEGATIVE EFFECT OF AREA AND A WEAKER, BUT POSITIVE EFFECT OF CONNECTIVITY ON EVENNESS. COMMUNITIES IN SMALL HABITAT FRAGMENTS WERE MAINLY COMPOSED OF MOBILE AND GENERALIST SPECIES. THE HIGHER EVENNESS IN SMALL FRAGMENTS COULD THEREBY BE GENERATED BY HIGHLY MOBILE SPECIES THAT MAINTAIN LOCAL POPULATIONS WITH FREQUENT INTER-FRAGMENT MOVEMENTS. TRAIT ANALYSIS SUGGESTED AN INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF DISPERSAL OVER LOCAL RECRUITMENT, AS WE MOVE FROM LARGE TO SMALL FRAGMENTS AND FROM LESS TO MORE CONNECTED FRAGMENTS. SPECIES RICHNESS AND EVENNESS WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED INDICATING THAT THE TWO VARIABLES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO HABITAT AREA AND CONNECTIVITY, ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE OBSERVED PATTERNS ARE DIFFICULT TO ISOLATE.

EVOL.,"WE RELATE NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION WITH FLORAL VISITORS IN SAMPLES FROM TWO BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FROM ARGENTINA: CHACO (99 SPP. FROM ITS SOUTHERN REGION) AND PATAGONIA (48 SPP. FROM ITS CENTRAL REGION), USING OUR OWN DATA PUBLISHED IN EARLIER PAPERS. THE VARIABLES TO BE COMPARED WERE SUGAR RATIO AND SUCROSE PERCENTAGE. DIFFERENCES IN THE SUGAR COMPOSITION WERE OBSERVED WHEN COMPARING BOTH REGIONS. BEE- AND BUTTERFLY-VISITED PATAGONIAN SPECIES SHOWED LOWER SUCROSE PERCENTAGES AND SUGAR RATIOS THAN CHAQUEAN SPECIES, I.E., A CONVERGENCE IN SUGAR COMPOSITION WAS NOT VERIFIED. MOTH-VISITED SPECIES SHOWED A WIDE RANGE OF SUCROSE PROPORTIONS AND SUGAR RATIOS IN BOTH REGIONS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM. AS THE DIFFERENCES FOUND IN SUGAR RATIO BETWEEN CHACO AND PATAGONIA, ACCORDING TO THE PREDOMINANT POLLINATOR GUILDS, MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED BY THE SAMPLE SIZE, WE SEARCHED FOR SIMILARITIES IN SUGAR RATIOS BETWEEN PLANTS WITH THE SAME VISITOR TYPE IN A COMPARATIVE WAY, COMPARING OUR DATA POOLED TOGETHER AGAINST DATA BY BAKER AND BAKER'S (1983A). OUR DATA DO NOT AGREE WITH THEIRS, I.E., NO TRENDS CAN BE DRAWN FOR BEES, MOTHS, AND BUTTERFLIES SUGAR PREFERENCES. THE EXCEPTIONS WERE THE HUMMINGBIRD-VISITED SPECIES THAT SHOWED A SIMILAR PATTERN IN BOTH CASES, I.E., THERE IS A CONVERGENCE AMONG PLANTS OFFERING NECTAR WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF SUCROSE. TO EVALUATE WHETHER CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES WITHIN A FAMILY HAVE SIMILAR NECTAR COMPOSITION AND FLOWER VISITORS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR REGION, SUGAR PROPORTIONS WERE COMPARED IN SEVERAL FAMILIES. HEXOSE NECTARS WERE PREDOMINANT IN ASTERACEAE, FABACEAE, SOLANACEAE, AND VERBENACEAE, WHILE SUCROSE NECTARS PREVAILED IN BROMELIACEAE AND ONAGRACEAE.

THE DEFENCE OF SOCIAL INSECTS MIGHT OCCUR AT DIFFERENT LEVELS, THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE GROUP. INDIVIDUAL DEFENCE OCCURS IN PART VIA THE INNATE IMMUNE SYSTEM RESULTING IN THE EXPRESSION OF ANTIMICROBIAL SUBSTANCES.

GILLESPIE SD;ADLER LS,GILLESPIE SD,INDIRECT EFFECTS ON MUTUALISMS: PARASITISM OF BUMBLE BEES AND POLLINATION SERVICE TO PLANTS,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"RESEARCHERS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF MUTUALISMS IN STRUCTURING COMMUNITIES AND VIEW POSITIVE INTERACTIONS IN A COMMUNITY CONTEXT RATHER THAN AS SIMPLE PAIRWISE INTERACTIONS. INDIRECT EFFECTS, SUCH AS THOSE THAT PREDATORS HAVE ON LOWER TROPHIC LEVELS, ARE A KEY PROCESS IN COMMUNITY ECOLOGY. HOWEVER, SUCH TOP-DOWN INDIRECT EFFECTS HAVE RARELY BEEN EXTENDED TO MUTUALISMS. ANTAGONISTS OF ONE MUTUALIST HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SECOND MUTUALIST THROUGH NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THEIR PARTNER, AND THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH EFFECTS SHOULD VARY WITH MUTUALISM STRENGTH. BUMBLE BEES ARE ECOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS THAT ARE AN IDEAL SYSTEM TO DETERMINE IF SUCH INDIRECT EFFECTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MUTUALISMS. BUMBLE BEES ARE ATTACKED BY AN ARRAY OF PARASITES AND PREDATORS, AND THEY INTERACT WITH A RANGE OF PLANTS THAT VARY IN THEIR DEPENDENCE ON BUMBLE BEES FOR REPRODUCTION. WE TESTED WHETHER VARIATION IN PARASITISM RATES BY NOSEMA BOMBI, CRITHIDIA BOMBI, AND CONOPID FLIES CORRELATED WITH REPRODUCTION OF GREENHOUSE-RAISED PLANTS PLACED IN THE FIELD. AT MULTIPLE SITES OVER TWO YEARS, WE STUDIED FOUR PLANT SPECIES THAT VARIED IN RELIANCE ON BUMBLE BEES AS POLLINATORS.

ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION IS AN APPROACH TO MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW ANIMAL COMMUNITIES AND PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS RESPOND TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF LAND-USE LEGACIES AND RESTORATION. WE INVESTIGATED HOW RESTORATION AND AGRICULTURAL HISTORY AFFECT BEE (HYMENOPTERA: APOIDEA: ANTHOPHILA) COMMUNITIES AND POLLINATION FUNCTION. IN 27 PAIRED REMNANT (NO HISTORY OF AGRICULTURE) AND POST-AGRICULTURAL LONGLEAF PINE (PINUS PALUSTRIS MILL.) WOODLANDS, WE ESTABLISHED 4-10 1-HA PLOTS (126 TOTAL) AND EXPERIMENTALLY RESTORED HALF OF THEM, WHILE THE OTHER HALF WERE LEFT AS UNRESTORED CONTROLS. RESTORATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CANOPY THINNING WHICH REINSTATES OPEN SAVANNA-LIKE CONDITIONS. WE COLLECTED BEES IN EACH PLOT USING A COMBINATION OF BOWL TRAPPING AND STANDARDIZED NETTING TRANSECTS. THINNING INCREASED BEE ABUNDANCE BY 169\% AND BEE RICHNESS BY 110\%, BUT AGRICULTURAL LAND USE HAD NO EFFECT ON THESE VARIABLES. BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS AFFECTED BY RESTORATION AND WAS MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. TO MEASURE POLLINATION FUNCTION, WE CONDUCTED A SENTINEL PLANT EXPERIMENT IN WHICH POTTED BLACK MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA L.) PLANTS WERE PLACED OUT IN A SUBSET OF THESE SITES (N=10) AND EITHER BAGGED TO EXCLUDE POLLINATORS OR LEFT OPEN FOR POLLINATOR ACCESS. THEN, WE MEASURED FRUIT AND SEED SET OF SENTINEL PLANTS TO COMPARE POLLINATION FUNCTION AMONG THE RESTORATION AND LAND-USE HISTORY TREATMENTS. SEED SET AND FRUIT SET OF SENTINEL PLANTS WERE HIGHER IN OPEN THAN BAGGED PLANTS, INDICATING THAT THIS MODEL SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY MEASURED POLLINATION, BUT WE FOUND NO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION BASED ON RESTORATION OR AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES MAY SHOW CLEAR RESPONSES TO RESTORATION THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF PRIOR LAND-USE IMPACTS, THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION FUNCTION AFTER RESTORATION.",AGRICULTURAL HISTORY; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LAND-USE LEGACY; LONGLEAF PINE SAVANNA,AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE; USE HISTORY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SOIL PROPERTIES; USE LEGACIES; FOREST; HYMENOPTERA; ECOSYSTEM; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"BRELAND, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, 612 WILSON RD,ROOM 368, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;BRELAND, SABRIE, TURLEY, NASH E., BRUDVIG, LARS A., MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, 612 WILSON RD,ROOM 368, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;TURLEY, NASH E., ISAACS, RUFUS, BRUDVIG, LARS A., MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, PROGRAM ECOL EVOLUTIONARY BIOL \& BEHAV, 293 FARM LANE, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;GIBBS, JASON, ISAACS, RUFUS, MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, 578 WILSON RD,ROOM 202 CIPS, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;TURLEY, NASH E., UNIV CENT FLORIDA, DEPT BIOL, BIOL, 4110 LIBRA DR,BLDG 20,ROOM 312, ORLANDO, FL 32816 USA.;GIBBS, JASON, UNIV MANITOBA, DEPT ENTOMOL, ROOM 213,ENTOMOL BLDG, WINNIPEG, MB R3T 2N2, CANADA.",10.1002/ECS2.2435,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",E02435,"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FOREST SERVICE, SAVANNAH RIVERUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE [DE-EM0003622]; DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, AIKEN, SCUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE)","WE THANK JOHN BLAKE, LINDSEY KEMMERLING, JOE LEDVINA, STEPHEN MCCANN, JOHN ORROCK, ED OLSON, AND EMMA YORK FOR ASSISTANCE WITH CREATING AND MAINTAINING THIS EXPERIMENT AND COLLECTING DATA.

FOR EXAMPLE, IT IS LARGELY UNKNOWN WHETHER SUCH POLLINATION CAN LEAD TO ADAPTIVE FLORAL DIVERGENCE AND TO WHAT DEGREE POLLINATORS WITH DIFFERENT EFFECTIVENESS DETERMINE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF COMBINED BUMBLEBEE- AND HOVERFLY-POLLINATION (GENERALIZED POLLINATION) IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE OF EACH INDIVIDUAL POLLINATOR SPECIES (SPECIALIZED POLLINATION), USING FAST-CYCLING BRASSICA RAPA PLANTS DURING SEVEN GENERATIONS OF EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION. BUMBLEBEES WERE TWICE AS EFFICIENT AS HOVERFLIES IN POLLINATING B. RAPA FLOWERS, BUT PHENOTYPIC SELECTION AND EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN PLANTS WITH GENERALIZED POLLINATION WAS DIFFERENT FROM BOTH BUMBLEBEE- AND HOVERFLY-POLLINATED PLANTS FOR SEVERAL TRAITS. AFTER SEVEN GENERATIONS EVOLUTION, PLANTS WITH GENERALIZED POLLINATION RESEMBLED BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PLANTS IN HAVING LITTLE SPONTANEOUS SELFING AND TALL SIZE, BUT WERE MORE SIMILAR TO HOVERFLY-POLLINATED PLANTS IN HAVING LOW FLORAL SCENT EMISSION.

THIS XENOGAMOUS SPECIES IS MAINLY POLLINATED BY CENTRIS AND EUGLOSSA BEES (APIDAE) SEEKING NECTAR, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO FLY LONG DISTANCES. THE FLOWERS FAVOUR THESE BEES BY HAVING: (1) A CLOSED ENTRANCE IN NEWLY OPENED FLOWERS WHICH PROVIDES ACCESS ONLY TO STRONG BEES CAPABLE OF DEFORMING THE FLOWER TUBE, AND (2) A NECTAR CHAMBER THAT IS ACCESSIBLE ONLY TO LONG-TONGUED BEES. ONLY FIRST-DAY FLOWERS WITH YELLOW NECTAR GUIDES PRODUCE NECTAR. POLLINATORS PREFER THESE FLOWERS OVER SECOND- AND THIRD-DAY FLOWERS WITH ORANGE AND RED NECTAR GUIDES, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EVALUATION OF RESTORATION MEASURES IS AN IMPORTANT TASK OF CONSERVATION BIOLOGY. INLAND SAND DUNES AND DRY, OLIGOTROPHIC GRASSLANDS HAVE BECOME RARE HABITAT TYPES IN LARGE PARTS OF CENTRAL EUROPE AND THEIR RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT IS OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE FOR THE PRESERVATION OF MANY ENDANGERED PLANT AND INSECT SPECIES. WITHIN SUCH HABITATS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO RESTORE KEY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS POLLINATION NETWORKS. AS WILD BEES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS IN MANY ECOSYSTEMS, THEY REPRESENT A SUITABLE KEY GROUP TO EVALUATE RESTORATION MEASURES. FURTHERMORE, THE RECENT DECLINE OF MANY BEE SPECIES AND THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES ARE CURRENTLY TOPICS OF STRONG SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. 2. WE STUDIED THE SUCCESSION OF BEE COMMUNITIES IN RESPONSE TO RESTORATION MEASURES OF SAND DUNES AND SAND GRASSLANDS AND COMPARED THESE COMMUNITIES WITH THOSE OF OLD SAND DUNE COMPLEXES. 3. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WILD BEES RESPOND RAPIDLY TO RESTORATION MEASURES INDICATED BY A HIGH SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE. THE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE OF BEES AT RESTORATION SITES CONVERGED ONLY SLIGHTLY TO THOSE OF THE TARGET SITES. A HIGHER SIMILARITY WAS FOUND BETWEEN BEE COMMUNITIES AT THE RESTORATION SITES (SAND DUNES AND GRASSLANDS), INDICATING THAT THEIR CLOSE PROXIMITY WAS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF SPECIES OVERLAP. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF ENTOMOPHILOUS PLANT SPECIES AND MOISTURE HAD A STRONG INFLUENCE ON WILD BEE SPECIES COMPOSITION. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE RESTORATION OF INLAND SAND DUNE COMPLEXES PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLONIZATION BY A DIVERSE WILD BEE COMMUNITY.

THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL CONDITIONS AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AT MULTIPLE SCALES ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN AGRI-NATURAL LANDS IN CHAPADA DIAMANTINA, BAHIA, BRAZIL. POLLINATORS WERE COLLECTED IN 27 SAMPLING UNITS DISTRIBUTED ORTHOGONALLY ALONG A GRADIENT OF PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURE AND LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY. THE AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION WAS USED TO SELECT MODELS THAT BEST FIT THE METRICS FOR NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS, COMPARING FOUR HYPOTHESES REPRESENTED BY A SET OF A PRIORI CANDIDATE MODELS WITH SPECIFIC COMBINATIONS OF THE PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURE, THE AVERAGE SHAPE OF THE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS, THE DIVERSITY OF THE LANDSCAPE AND THE STRUCTURE OF LOCAL VEGETATION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A REDUCTION OF HABITAT QUALITY AND LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY CAN CAUSE SPECIES LOSS AND DECREASE OF NETWORKS NESTEDNESS. THESE STRUCTURAL CHANGES CAN REDUCE ROBUSTNESS AND RESILIENCE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS WHAT COMPROMISES THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PLANTS, THE MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY AND THE POLLINATION SERVICE STABILITY.

SCI.,"PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY AND/OR POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHANGES IN FLORAL TRAITS OF PLANTS WHEN THEY ARE FORCED TO LIVE IN NEW CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TWO EVENTS COULD BE INDEPENDENT, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IN FLORAL TRAITS MIGHT HELP TO COORDINATE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND ENHANCE PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN CHANGING HABITATS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE INVESTIGATED FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION ON THREE NATURAL POPULATIONS OF A LOUSEWORT (PEDICULARIS SIPHONANTHA) RANGING AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS, AS WELL AS TWO DOWNWARD TRANSPLANTED POPULATIONS IN SHANGERI-LA COUNTY AND DEQIN COUNTY, NORTHWEST YUNNAN, CHINA.

CRAB SPIDERS REFLECT ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LIGHT, AMBUSH POLLINATORS ON FLOWERS, AND MANIPULATE FLOWER UV SIGNALS ALTERING THE BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE OF PREY. WHEREAS CRAB SPIDERS TYPICALLY DEPEND ON FLOWERS TO FORAGE, ADULT EPICADUS HETEROGASTER DEPARTS FROM THIS STANDARD BEHAVIOR BY PREYING ON POLLINATORS UPON GREEN LEAVES, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF FLOWERS NEARBY.

GOTTSBERGER G,GOTTSBERGER G,EVOLUTIONARY STEPS IN THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ANNONACEAE,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FRUTICULTURA,REV. BRAS. FRUTIC.,"FLOWERS OF ANNONACEAE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY FLESHY PETALS, MANY STAMENS WITH HARD CONNECTIVE SHIELDS AND NUMEROUS CARPELS WITH SESSILE STIGMAS OFTEN COVERED BY STICKY SECRETIONS. THE PETALS OF MANY REPRESENTATIVES DURING ANTHESIS FORM A CLOSED POLLINATION CHAMBER. PROTOGYNOUS DICHOGAMY WITH STRONG SCENT EMISSIONS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PISTILLATE STAGE IS A CHARACTER OF NEARLY ALL SPECIES. SCENT EMISSIONS CAN BE ENHANCED BY THERMOGENESIS. THE PREVAILING REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IN THE FAMILY SEEMS TO BE SELF-COMPATIBILITY. THE BASAL GENUS ANAXAGOREA BESIDES EXHIBITING SEVERAL ANCESTRAL MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS HAS ALSO MANY CHARACTERS WHICH REAPPEAR IN OTHER GENERA. STRONG FRUIT-LIKE SCENTS CONSISTING OF FRUIT-ESTERS AND ALCOHOLS MAINLY ATTRACT SMALL FRUIT-BEETLES (GENUS COLOPTERUS, NITIDULIDAE) AS POLLINATORS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER BEETLES (CURCULIONIDAE, CHRYSOMELIDAE) AND FRUIT-FLIES (DROSOPHILIDAE), WHICH THEMSELVES GNAW ON THE THICK PETALS OR THEIR LARVAE ARE PETAL OR OVULE PREDATORS. THE FLOWERS AND THE THICK PETALS ARE THUS A FLORAL BROOD SUBSTRATE FOR THE VISITORS AND THE THICK PETALS OF ANAXAGOREA HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED AS AN ANTIPREDATOR STRUCTURE. ANOTHER FUNCTION OF THE CLOSED THICK PETALS IS THE PRODUCTION OF HEAT BY ACCUMULATED STARCH, WHICH ENHANCES SCENT EMISSION AND PROVIDES A WARM SHELTER FOR THE ATTRACTED BEETLES. INSIGHT INTO FLORAL CHARACTERS AND FLORAL ECOLOGY OF ANAXAGOREA, THE SISTER GROUP OF THE REST OF THE ANNONACEAE, IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING FUNCTIONAL EVOLUTION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE. AS BEETLE POLLINATION (CANTHAROPHILY) IS PLESIOMORPHIC IN ANAXAGOREA AND IN ANNONACEAE, CHARACTERS ASSOCIATED WITH BEETLE POLLINATION APPEAR IMPRINTED IN MEMBERS OF THE WHOLE FAMILY. POLLINATION BY BEETLES (CANTHAROPHILY) IS THE PREDOMINANT MODE OF THE MAJORITY OF SPECIES WORLDWIDE. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF DIURNAL REPRESENTATIVES (E.G., GUATTERIA, DUGUETIA, ANNONA) WHICH FUNCTION ON THE BASIS OF FRUIT-IMITATING FLOWERS ATTRACTING MAINLY FRUIT-INHABITING NITIDULID BEETLES, AS WELL AS NOCTURNAL SPECIES (E.G., LARGE-FLOWERED ANNONA AND DUGUETIA SPECIES), WHICH ADDITIONALLY TO MOST OF THE DIURNAL SPECIES EXHIBIT STRONG FLOWER WARMING AND PROVIDE VERY THICK PETAL TISSUES FOR THE VORACIOUS DYNASTID SCARAB BEETLES (DYNASTINAE, SCARABAEIDAE). FURTHER EXAMPLES WILL SHOW THAT A FEW ANNONACEAE HAVE ADAPTED IN THEIR POLLINATION ALSO TO THRIPS, FLIES, COCKROACHES AND EVEN BEES. ALTHOUGH THIS NON-BEETLE POLLINATED SPECIES HAVE ADAPTED IN FLOWER STRUCTURE AND SCENT COMPOUNDS TO THEIR RESPECTIVE INSECTS, THEY STILL RETAIN SOME OF THE SPECIALIZED CANTHAROPHILOUS CHARACTERS OF THEIR ANCESTORS.",FLORAL BIOLOGY; POLLINATION; CANTHAROPHILY; DICHOGAMY,BREEDING SYSTEM; DIPTEROCARP FOREST; BEETLE POLLINATION; NITIDULID BEETLES; FLORAL SCENT; MODE; BEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"GOTTSBERGER, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ULM, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY.;UNIV ULM, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY.",10.1590/S0100-29452014000500004,"VIA ACESSO PROF PAULO DONATO CASTELLANE, S-N, JABOTICABAL SP, 14884-900, BRAZIL",NA,NA,NA,0100-2945,1,32-43,SOC BRASILEIRA FRUTICULTURA,36,2014,ISI000335009400004,46,AGRICULTURE,45,HORTICULTURE,GERHARD.GOTTSBERGERUNI-ULM.DE,AF9BG,"GOTTSBERGER, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ULM, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY",ISI,none,UNIV ULM,UNIV ULM,NA,"GOTTSBERGER G, 2014, REV BRAS FRUTIC","GOTTSBERGER G, 2014, REV BRAS FRUTIC",NA,NA,NA,NA,Ana M

WE STUDIED POSSIBLE BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE FORMATION OF FLOWER SIZE PREFERENCES IN BUMBLEBEES, USING A TWO-PHASE LABORATORY EXPERIMENT. EXPERIMENTALLY NAIVE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.) FORAGED ON ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS THAT BORE EITHER A LARGE (3.8 CM DIAMETER) OR A SMALL (2.7 CM. DIAMETER) DISPLAY OF A UNIFORM COLOR. ONLY FLOWERS OF ONE DISPLAY SIZE CONTAINED NECTAR REWARDS. WE CHANGED THE DISPLAY COLOR AND THE LOCATIONS OF LARGE AND SMALL FLOWERS IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENTAL PHASE. WE RECORDED THE BEES' CHOICES IN BOTH PHASES. ALMOST HALF OF THE BEES (41 \%) MADE THEIR FIRST VISIT TO A SMALL FLOWER. THE BEES LEARNED TO ASSOCIATE DISPLAY SIZE WITH FOOD REWARD, AND CHOSE REWARDING FLOWERS WITH > 85\% ACCURACY BY THE END OF EACH EXPERIMENTAL PHASE. SOME LEARNING OCCURRED WITHIN THE BEES' FIRST THREE FLOWER VISITS. LEARNING OF THE SIZE-REWARD ASSOCIATION WAS EQUALLY GOOD FOR LARGE AND SMALL DISPLAYS IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL PHASE, BUT BETTER FOR SMALL DISPLAYS IN THE SECOND PHASE. FORMATION OF SIZE-REWARD ASSOCIATIONS FOLLOWED A SIMILAR COURSE IN BOTH PHASES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE BEES DID NOT APPLY THEIR EXPERIENCE FROM THE FIRST LEARNING PHASE TO THE NEW SITUATION OF THE SECOND PHASE. RATHER, THEY TREATED EACH PHASE OF THE EXPERIMENT AS AN INDEPENDENT LEARNING TASK. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING IS INVOLVED IN THE FORMATION OF PREFERENCES FOR LARGE DISPLAYS BY BEES.

WHILE POLICY DIRECTIVES ARE FOCUSED ON RENEWABLE FUEL PRODUCTION, BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE LAND-USE CHANGES REQUIRED TO MEET PRODUCTION TARGETS. USING DATA FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS, WE DEVELOPED EMPIRICAL MODELS FOR PREDICTING ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF FLOWER-VISITING BEES BASED ON LAND COVER. WE USED THESE MODELS TO EXPLORE HOW BEES MIGHT RESPOND UNDER TWO CONTRASTING BIOENERGY SCENARIOS: ANNUAL BIOENERGY CROP PRODUCTION AND PERENNIAL GRASSLAND BIOENERGY PRODUCTION. IN THE TWO SCENARIOS, 600,000 HA OF MARGINAL ANNUAL CROP LAND OR MARGINAL GRASSLAND WERE CONVERTED TO PERENNIAL GRASSLAND OR ANNUAL ROW CROP BIOENERGY PRODUCTION, RESPECTIVELY. MODEL PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT EXPANSION OF ANNUAL BIOENERGY CROP PRODUCTION AT THIS SCALE WILL REDUCE BEE ABUNDANCE BY 0 TO 71\%, AND BEE DIVERSITY BY 0 TO 28\%, DEPENDING ON LOCATION. IN CONTRAST, CONVERTING ANNUAL CROPS ON MARGINAL SOIL TO PERENNIAL GRASSLANDS COULD INCREASE BEE ABUNDANCE FROM 0 TO 600\% AND INCREASE BEE DIVERSITY BETWEEN 0 AND 53\%. OUR ANALYSIS OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION SUGGESTED A SIMILAR PATTERN, WITH BEE COMMUNITIES BECOMING LESS DIVERSE UNDER ANNUAL BIOENERGY CROP PRODUCTION, WHEREAS BEE COMPOSITION TRANSITIONED TOWARDS A MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITY DOMINATED BY WILD BEES UNDER PERENNIAL BIOENERGY CROP PRODUCTION.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN NECTAR CHEMISTRY UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS HAS BEEN ONLY RARELY EXPLORED, YET IT IS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION MIGHT ACT ON NECTAR TRAITS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION IN FIELD AND GLASSHOUSE PLANTS OF THE BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PERENNIAL HERBS AQUILEGIA VULGARIS SUBSP. VULGARIS AND AQUILEGIA PYRENAICA SUBSP. CAZORLENSIS (RANUNCULACEAE). THE AIMS OF THE STUDY ARE TO ASSESS THE GENERALITY OF EXTREME INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION RECENTLY REPORTED FOR OTHER SPECIES IN THE FIELD, AND GAINING INSIGHT ON THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. METHODS THE PROPORTIONS OF GLUCOSE, FRUCTOSE AND SUCROSE IN SINGLE-NECTARY NECTAR SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM FIELD AND GLASSHOUSE PLANTS WERE DETERMINED USING HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. A HIERARCHICAL VARIANCE PARTITION WAS USED TO DISSECT TOTAL VARIANCE INTO COMPONENTS DUE TO VARIATION AMONG PLANTS, FLOWERS WITHIN PLANTS, AND NECTARIES WITHIN FLOWERS. KEY RESULTS NECTAR OF THE TWO SPECIES WAS MOSTLY SUCROSE-DOMINATED, BUT COMPOSITION VARIED WIDELY IN THE FIELD, RANGING FROM SUCROSE-ONLY TO FRUCTOSE-DOMINATED. MOST INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIANCE WAS DUE TO DIFFERENCES AMONG NECTARIES OF THE SAME FLOWER, AND FLOWERS OF THE SAME PLANT. THE HIGH INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN SUGAR COMPOSITION EXHIBITED BY FIELD PLANTS VANISHED IN THE GLASSHOUSE, WHERE NECTAR COMPOSITION EMERGED AS A REMARKABLY CONSTANT FEATURE ACROSS PLANTS, FLOWERS AND NECTARIES. CONCLUSIONS IN ADDITION TO CORROBORATING THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES DOCUMENTING EXTREME INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION IN THE FIELD, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SUCH VARIATION MAY ULTIMATELY BE CAUSED BY BIOTIC FACTORS OPERATING ON THE NECTAR IN THE FIELD BUT NOT IN THE GLASSHOUSE.

WE USED THE POLLINATION MODULE OF INVEST (A SUITE OF SOFTWARE MODELS USED TO MAP AND VALUE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES), ALONG WITH FINE-SCALE LAND COVER DATA AND EMPIRICAL DATA ON BEE DISTRIBUTIONS, TO ASSESS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF URBAN POLLINATOR MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (USA). SPECIFICALLY, WE SIMULATED THE PARTIAL CONVERSION OF LAWN/TURF-GRASS TO FLORAL RESOURCES IN CITY PARKS ONLY, IN GARDENS MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS ONLY, AND IN ANY AVAILABLE TURF GRASS WITHIN BUFFER DISTANCES OF 250-1000 M OF URBAN FARMS, COMMUNITY GARDENS, AND HOME GARDENS ACROSS CHICAGO. WE FOUND THAT THE OUTPUT OF INVEST'S POLLINATION MODEL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO EMPIRICAL MEASURES OF BEE RICHNESS (EXPLAINING 46\% OF THE VARIATION) BUT NOT BEE ABUNDANCE IN CHICAGO. TO INCREASE POLLINATION SUPPLY AT URBAN FARMS AND COMMUNITY GARDENS, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT, OUT OF THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED HERE, THE BEST STRATEGY FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO WOULD BE TO CONCENTRATE FLORAL RESOURCES NEARBY (WITHIN A 250 M BUFFER RATHER THAN WITHIN A 1 KM BUFFER). IN CONTRAST, FOR HOME GARDENS, THE MODEL INDICATES THAT IT MAY BE BETTER TO INCREASE FLORAL RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE CITY. THIS DISCREPANCY MAY BE DUE TO THE SMALLER SIZE OF HOME GARDENS AND THEIR MORE DISPERSED SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY. GENERALLY, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT CONVERTING TURF GRASS TO A MORE FLORALLY-RICH LAND COVER WOULD SUPPORT INCREASED SUPPLY OF POLLINATORS AND URBAN AGRICULTURE. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.

CONSERV.,"HABITAT LOSS FROM URBAN DEVELOPMENT THREATENS NATIVE PLANT POPULATIONS IN MANY REGIONS OF THE WORLD. IN ADDITION TO DIRECT PLANT MORTALITY, URBAN INTENSIFICATION POTENTIALLY IMPACTS POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND IN TURN DISRUPTS THE POLLINATION MUTUALISMS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE VIABILITY OF NATIVE PLANT POPULATIONS. WE PLACED STANDARDIZED FLOWERING PLANT ARRAYS INTO WOODLANDS ALONG A GRADIENT OF INCREASING URBAN LAND USE TO SIMULTANEOUSLY QUANTIFY LANDSCAPE-SCALE AND LOCAL-SCALE EFFECTS ON POLLINATORS AND ON REPRODUCTION OF TWO SPRING EPHEMERAL WILDFLOWERS (CLAYTONIA VIRGINICA AND POLEMONIUM REPTANS) IN WOODLAND FRAGMENTS IN THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION OF NORTH AMERICA. GREATER POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND ASSOCIATED DIVERSITY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEGREE OF POLLEN LIMITATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT POLLINATOR POPULATIONS ARE CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFUL POLLINATION OF THESE PLANT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LANDSCAPE-SCALE HABITAT LOSS DID NOT REDUCE POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE OR DIVERSITY. HABITAT LOSS AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE THEREFORE DOES NOT APPEAR TO DRIVE CHANGES IN POLLINATION IN THIS WOODLAND SYSTEM. RATHER, LOCAL-SCALE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS WERE MORE IMPORTANT, WITH POLLINATORS BEING MORE ABUNDANT IN BRIGHTER WOODLAND PATCHES FOR ONE PLANT SPECIES, AND IN LARGER PATCHES FOR THE OTHER SPECIES. BECAUSE WE FOUND ABUNDANT POLLINATORS AND ADEQUATE POLLINATION EVEN IN ISOLATED, URBAN WOODLAND FRAGMENTS, OUR RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BOTH PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IN URBAN LANDSCAPES.

BRANDT K;GLEMNITZ M;SCHROEDER B,BRANDT K,THE IMPACT OF CROP PARAMETERS AND SURROUNDING HABITATS ON DIFFERENT POLLINATOR GROUP ABUNDANCE ON AGRICULTURAL FIELDS,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT,AGRIC. ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"POLLINATION IS A KEY ECOSYSTEM SERVICE. POLLINATORS, HOWEVER, ARE IN DECLINE AND THEIR SERVICE IS INCREASINGLY THREATENED. THE DECLINE IS DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS, MOST OF WHICH ARE RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LANDSCAPE SYSTEM, CONSISTING OF BOTH CROPPED AND NON CROPPED AREAS, MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS OR EVEN QUANTIFY THE ROLE OF FARMING PRACTICES IN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND THEIR HABITAT USE. WE INTEND TO IDENTIFY AND QUANTIFY THE DRIVING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT DETERMINE POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ON THE CROP AND LANDSCAPE SCALE. THESE INFORMATION HELPS US TO DESIGN ALGORITHMS THAT CAN BE USED AS A BASIS FOR PREDICTING POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE ON AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. TO INTEGRATE VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS DATA SAMPLING WAS PERFORMED ON FARMS IN THREE DIFFERENT REGIONS IN GERMANY. POLLINATORS WERE CLASSIFIED INTO DIFFERENT GROUPS WITH THREE AGGREGATION LEVELS. WE OBSERVED CROP PARAMETERS AS WELL AS LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS IN THE AREAS SURROUNDING FIELDS IN ADDITION TO TEMPORAL ASPECTS. GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS (GLMS) WERE THEN CALCULATED. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH CROP AND LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS AFFECT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE ON AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. HOWEVER, THE EXPLANATORY POWER OF THE INCLUDED PARAMETERS VARIED STRONGLY AMONG THE PARTICULAR POLLINATOR GROUPS AND BETWEEN AGGREGATION LEVELS. FURTHERMORE, DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN SPECIES GROUPS IMPROVES THE EXPLANATORY POWER COMPARED TO MODELS THAT ARE MORE AGGREGATED. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE TEMPORAL MATCH BETWEEN MAIN ACTIVITY PERIODS OF THE PARTICULAR POLLINATOR GROUPS AND RESOURCE SUPPLY BY THE CROP SPECIES IS A KEY FACTOR WHEN ANALYSING POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE. IN CONCLUSION, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ASSESSMENT AND SUPPORT OF POLLINATION SERVICES SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT WITH REGARD TO INDIVIDUAL POLLINATOR GROUPS. WHEN STUDYING POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, THE CROP AS WELL AS THE LANDSCAPE SCALE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. A RANGE OF DIFFERENT HABITAT REQUIREMENTS AND DIFFERENT ACTIVITY PERIODS OF THE POLLINATOR GROUPS MUST BE COVERED TO MAINTAIN POLLINATION SERVICES, AND THEREFORE BOTH DIVERSE LANDSCAPES AND DIVERSE CROP ROTATIONS ARE OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE.

VIS. EXP.,"ALL ORGANISMS INHABIT A WORLD FULL OF SENSORY STIMULI THAT DETERMINE THEIR BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. OLFACTION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN INSECTS, WHICH USE THEIR OLFACTORY SYSTEMS TO RESPOND TO, AND DISCRIMINATE AMONGST, COMPLEX ODOR STIMULI. THESE ODORS ELICIT BEHAVIORS THAT MEDIATE PROCESSES SUCH AS REPRODUCTION AND HABITAT SELECTION(1-3). ADDITIONALLY, CHEMICAL SENSING BY INSECTS MEDIATES BEHAVIORS THAT ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FOR AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN HEALTH, INCLUDING POLLINATION(4-6), HERBIVORY OF FOOD CROPS(7), AND TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE(8,9). IDENTIFICATION OF OLFACTORY SIGNALS AND THEIR ROLE IN INSECT BEHAVIOR IS THUS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BOTH ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND HUMAN FOOD RESOURCES AND WELL-BEING. TO DATE, THE IDENTIFICATION OF VOLATILES THAT DRIVE INSECT BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND OFTEN TEDIOUS. CURRENT TECHNIQUES INCLUDE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-COUPLED ELECTROANTENNOGRAM RECORDING (GC-EAG), AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-COUPLED SINGLE SENSILLUM RECORDINGS (GC-SSR)(10-12). THESE TECHNIQUES PROVED TO BE VITAL IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A METHOD THAT USES GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO MULTI-CHANNEL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS (TERMED `GCMR') FROM NEURONS IN THE ANTENNAL LOBE (AL, THE INSECT'S PRIMARY OLFACTORY CENTER)(13,14). THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US TO PROBE HOW ODOR INFORMATION IS REPRESENTED IN THE INSECT BRAIN. MOREOVER, BECAUSE NEURAL RESPONSES TO ODORS AT THIS LEVEL OF OLFACTORY PROCESSING ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE OWING TO THE DEGREE OF CONVERGENCE OF THE ANTENNA'S RECEPTOR NEURONS INTO AL NEURONS, AL RECORDINGS WILL ALLOW THE DETECTION OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OF NATURAL ODORS EFFICIENTLY AND WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY. HERE WE DESCRIBE GCMR AND GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ITS USE. SEVERAL GENERAL STEPS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DETECTION OF BIOACTIVE VOLATILES AND INSECT RESPONSE. VOLATILES FIRST NEED TO BE COLLECTED FROM SOURCES OF INTEREST (IN THIS EXAMPLE WE USE FLOWERS FROM THE GENUS MIMULUS (PHYRMACEAE)) AND CHARACTERIZED AS NEEDED USING STANDARD GC-MS TECHNIQUES(14-16). INSECTS ARE PREPARED FOR STUDY USING MINIMAL DISSECTION, AFTER WHICH A RECORDING ELECTRODE IS INSERTED INTO THE ANTENNAL LOBE AND MULTI-CHANNEL NEURAL RECORDING BEGINS. POST-PROCESSING OF THE NEURAL DATA THEN REVEALS WHICH PARTICULAR ODORANTS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT NEURAL RESPONSES BY THE INSECT NERVOUS SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE EXAMPLE WE PRESENT HERE IS SPECIFIC TO POLLINATION STUDIES, GCMR CAN BE EXPANDED TO A WIDE RANGE OF STUDY ORGANISMS AND VOLATILE SOURCES. FOR INSTANCE, THIS METHOD CAN BE USED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ODORANTS ATTRACTING OR REPELLING VECTOR INSECTS AND CROP PESTS. MOREOVER, GCMR CAN ALSO BE USED TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTANTS FOR BENEFICIAL INSECTS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS.

FLOWER DENSITY AND RICHNESS WERE GREATER IN TILLED ORGANIC FIELDS THAN IN NO-TILL CONVENTIONAL FIELDS, AND FORB COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DIFFERED BETWEEN FARMING SYSTEMS. WE OBSERVED HIGH BEE DIVERSITY (109 TAXA) IN THIS HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED LANDSCAPE, AND BEE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN SYSTEMS. COMPARED WITH TILLED ORGANIC FIELDS, BEE-FLOWER INTERACTIONS IN NO-TILL CONVENTIONAL FIELDS WERE POORLY CONNECTED, SUGGESTING THESE SYSTEMS MAINTAIN RELATIVELY IMPOVERISHED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS.

THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF SPECIES AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL TRAITS MAY PROVIDE MECHANISTIC LINKS BETWEEN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH LINKS MAY BE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING DECREASES IN A STEP-WISE MANNER FROM REGIONAL CONDITIONS THROUGH LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY TO LOCAL HABITAT CONDITIONS. WE SAMPLED THE WILD BEE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES IN POWER-LINE STRIPS TRANSECTING FORESTS IN SOUTH-EASTERN NORWAY. WE USED ALTITUDE, LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY SURROUNDING SITES AND PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION, TOGETHER WITH TOTAL PLANT COVER AS PROXIES FOR REGIONAL, LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES DECREASED WITH ALTITUDE. THE REDUCTION IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYLOGENETIC CLUSTERING OF WILD BEE INDIVIDUALS. FURTHERMORE, REGIONAL FILTERS FOLLOWED BY LOCAL FILTERS BEST EXPLAINED THE STRUCTURE OF THE FUNCTIONAL SPECIES COMPOSITION.

FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITIONAL TURNOVER BETWEEN SITES WAS HIGHER IN THE NORTHERN REGION THAN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STUDY REGION.

THE PRESENT STUDY ON NESTING BIOLOGY OF CERATINA PROPINQUA AND CERATINA SIMILLIMA WAS CARRIED OUT TO GENERATE INFORMATION ABOUT NESTING SHELTERS AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THESE BEES FOR THEIR CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. SURVEYS AT WEEKLY INTERVALS WERE CONDUCTED FROM AUGUST, 2011 TO JUNE, 2012 IN THE PROBABLE NESTING SITES. THE NEST MAKING PERIOD FOR C. PROPINQUA AND C.

(FABACEAE) AND IN OPEN END BRANCHES OF CAESALPINIA PULCHERRIMA (L.) (FABACEAE), WHILE C. SIMILLIMA FEMALES USED ONLY CAESALPINIA AS ITS NESTING SHELTER. THE COMPLETE NEST OF C. PROPINQUA CONTAINED A SERIES OF BROOD CELLS WHICH WERE FREQUENTLY SEPARATED BY EMPTY CELLS (THE OLDEST CELL BELOW) WHILE C. SIMILLIMA NESTS WERE OBSERVED WITHOUT EMPTY CELLS.

WE USED EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS IN TWO POPULATIONS TO DETERMINE THE FLORAL PREFERENCES AND THE FITNESS EFFECTS OF LOW-EFFICIENCY ( OR ``UGLY) POLLINATORS ON CAMPANULA AMERICANA. THESE UGLY POLLINATORS (HALICTID BEES) PREFERENTIALLY VISITED FLOWERS WITH POLLEN OVER FLOWERS THAT HAD HAD THEIR POLLEN REMOVED. C.

SCI.,"THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED (GM) CROPS HAS PRECIPITATED THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND REGULATION OF POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED WE PRESENT A MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO PREDICT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUTCROSSING BETWEEN PROGENITOR POPULATIONS OF OILSEED RAPE. THE MODEL COMBINES THE PROCESSES OF POLLEN DISPERSAL AND POLLINATION, RESULTING FROM WIND AND INSECT ACTIVITY. IT INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF POST-POLLINATION REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES BY RELATING THE NUMBER OF PROGENY TO BOTH POLLEN DEPOSITION AND COMPETITION AT THE STIGMA. PREDICTIONS COMPARE WELL WITH A RANGE OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT-SIZED GM SOURCE CROPS (I.E. 0.0064-0.8 HA) AND NON-GM TARGET CROPS WITH DIFFERENT FERTILITIES (I.E. SELF-FERTILE TO 80\% MALE-STERILE). FOR THESE COMPARISONS, WE REPRESENT THE VARIATION CAUSED BY WIND AND INSECT EXPOSURE AS A CONSTRAINED SET OF RANDOM FUNCTIONS AND LIMIT THE RANGE OF INSECT TRANSPORT TO TYPICAL PLANT-SCALE DISTANCES. IN ADDITION, THE MODEL IS USED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIVE SENSITIVITY TO THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE GENE FLOW. TARGET-CROP FERTILITY AND SOURCE-CROP SIZE ARE SHOWN TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING BACKGROUND POLLEN AND THE NATURAL RANGE OF INSECT ACTIVITY. THE CONCEPT OF ISOLATION DISTANCE TO REGULATE GENE FLOW IS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR SELF-FERTILE TARGET CROPS, BUT IS INEFFECTIVE FOR MALE-STERILE TARGET CROPS WITH LOW BACKGROUND POLLEN.",WIND DISPERSAL; INSECT DISPERSAL; POLLINATION; OUTCROSSING; RISK ASSESSMENT; GENETICALLY MODIFIED PLANTS,BRASSICA-NAPUS L; HERBICIDE-RESISTANCE; PLANT-POPULATIONS; CORN POLLEN; DISPERSAL; CROPS; FIELD; DEPOSITION; BUMBLEBEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,40,"WALKLATE, PJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), SILSOE RES INST, WREST PK, BEDFORD MK45 4HS, ENGLAND.;SILSOE RES INST, BEDFORD MK45 4HS, ENGLAND.;CAMBRIDGE ENVIRONM RES CONSULTANTS LTD, CAMBRIDGE CB2 1SJ, ENGLAND.;NATL INST AGR BOT, CAMBRIDGE CB3 0LE, ENGLAND.",10.1098/RSPB.2003.2578,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,0962-8452,1538,441-449,ROYAL SOC,271,2004,ISI000189299600001,34,"LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",12,"BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",WALKLATEBBSRC.AC.UK,779LV,"WALKLATE, PJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), SILSOE RES INST, WREST PK, BEDFORD MK45 4HS, ENGLAND",ISI,none,SILSOE RES INST;CAMBRIDGE ENVIRONM RES CONSULTANTS LTD;NATL INST AGR BOT,SILSOE RES INST,NA,"WALKLATE PJ, 2004, PROC R SOC B-BIOL SCI","WALKLATE PJ, 2004, PROC R SOC B-BIOL SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

WE EXPECTED ANIMALS TO UTILIZE FLORAL CUES IN TARGETING PLANTS TO ATTACK SO FOR THREE FIELD SEASONS WE EXAMINED FLORIVORY IN FOUR SYMPATRIC IPOMOEA SPECIES THAT DIFFERED IN THEIR POLLINATION SYNDROME (FLOWER COLOR AND SHAPE) AS WELL AS THEIR GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN (NATIVE VS.

THERE WAS NO OVERALL DIFFERENCE IN DAMAGE LEVELS TO FLOWERS OF THE BEE OR HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED PLANTS. HOWEVER, FLORIVORES EXHIBITED A STRONG PREFERENCE FOR THE NATIVE, BUMBLE BEE-POLLINATED L CORDATOTRILOBA RELATIVE TO THE REMAINING THREE NON-NATIVE IPOMOEA SPECIES. THE NON-NATIVE, HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED I. HEDERIFOLIA AND I. QUAMOCLIT CONSISTENTLY EXPERIENCED THE LOWEST FLORIVORY RATES. THERE WERE REPRODUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES TO FLORIVORY AS DAMAGED FLOWERS HAD REDUCED FRUIT SET. SEED SET WAS NOT INFLUENCED BY COROLLA DAMAGE, BUT WAS REDUCED WHEN FLOWERS SUFFERED DAMAGE TO REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY SUGGEST THAT FLOWER-EATING INSECTS ARE NOT FOCUSING IN ON TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES, BUT ARE PREFERENTIALLY VISITING THE NATIVE IPOMOEA SPECIES, AND THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESSFUL INVASION OF INTRODUCED IPOMOEA PLANTS THAT SUFFER REDUCED DAMAGE LEVELS.",NA,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; RAPHANUS-RAPHANISTRUM; POLLEN AVAILABILITY; ALPINE WILDFLOWER; ISOMERIS-ARBOREA; FEEDING INSECTS; SEED PRODUCTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"SOWELL, DR (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV VIRGINIA, DEPT BIOL, POB 400328, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22904 USA.;SOWELL, DEXTER R., WOLFE, LORNE M., GEORGIA SO UNIV, DEPT BIOL, STATESBORO, GA 30460 USA.",10.1674/0003-0031-163.1.173,"UNIV NOTRE DAME, BOX 369, ROOM 295 GLSC, NOTRE DAME, IN 46556 USA",NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-0349553]; GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY, GRADUATE COLLEGE; GEORGIA SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE","THE AUTHORS THANK C.

HAND-POLLINATIONS WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THEIR BREEDING SYSTEM. WE FOUND TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERIGONAL NECTARIES LOCATED EITHER IN THE SPUR (HABENARIA GOURLIEANA, H. HIERONYMI, HABENARIINAE), OR IN THE BASAL LATERAL PARTS OF THE LABELLUM (BEADLEA DUTRAEI, PELEXIA BONARIENSIS, STENORRHYNCHOS ORCHIOIDES, SPIRANTHINAE). THE SPUR OF HABENARIA IS A NONVASCULARISED AND NONSTRUCTURAL NECTARY. THE INNER EPIDERMIS BEARS ONE-CELLED LONG PAPILLAE. IN BUD STAGE, THE PAPILLAE ARE FILLED WITH STARCH GRAINS, BUT WHEN THE FLOWER OPENS AND NECTAR SECRETION STARTS, THEY SHOW NO STARCH GRAINS. THIS FACT MAY INDICATE THAT STARCH IS A SOURCE FOR SOME OF THE SECRETED NECTAR. IN THE REMAINDER GENERA, THE LATERAL BASAL PARTS OF THE LABELLUM ARE SECRETORY. THE TWO GLANDS ARE LOCATED IN THE ADAXIAL BASAL LATERAL FACES OF THE THESE NECTARIES ARE STRUCTURAL AND NONVASCULARISED. STENORRHYNCHOS PRODUCES ABUNDANT, CONCENTRATED NECTAR(40-50\%).

THUS, THE POLLINATOR DEPENDENCY OF FABA BEAN YIELD WAS 16\% AT CONTROL TEMPERATURES (18-26 DEGREES C) AND EXTREME STRESS (34 DEGREES C), BUT WAS 53\% FOLLOWING INTERMEDIATE HEAT STRESS AT 30 DEGREES C. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT THE POLLINATOR DEPENDENCY OF CROPS CAN BE MODIFIED BY HEAT STRESS, AND SUGGEST THAT INSECT POLLINATION MAY BECOME MORE IMPORTANT IN CROP PRODUCTION AS THE PROBABILITY OF HEAT WAVES INCREASES.

EVOL.,"FORAGING BEHAVIOR IS A CRITICAL ADAPTATION BY INSECTS TO OBTAIN APPROPRIATE NUTRIENTS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND FITNESS. BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) FORM ANNUAL COLONIES WHICH MUST RAPIDLY INCREASE THEIR WORKER POPULATIONS TO SUPPORT REARING REPRODUCTIVE INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THE END OF THE SEASON. THEREFORE, COLONY GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION SHOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF POLLEN RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. OUR PREVIOUS RESEARCH FOUND THAT B.IMPATIENS FORAGING PREFERENCES TO DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES WERE SHAPED BY POLLEN PROTEIN:LIPID NUTRITIONAL RATIOS (P:L), WITH FORAGERS PREFERRING POLLEN SPECIES WITH A SIMILAR TO 5:1 P:L RATIO. IN THIS STUDY, WE PLACED B.IMPATIENS COLONIES IN THREE DIFFERENT HABITATS (FOREST, FOREST EDGE, AND VALLEY) TO DETERMINE WHETHER POLLEN NUTRITIONAL QUALITY COLLECTED BY THE COLONIES DIFFERED BETWEEN AREAS THAT MAY DIFFER IN RESOURCE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. WE FOUND THAT HABITAT DID NOT INFLUENCE THE COLLECTED POLLEN NUTRITIONAL QUALITY, WITH COLONIES IN ALL THREE HABITATS COLLECTING POLLEN AVERAGING A 4:1 P:L RATIO. FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY OF THE POLLEN COLLECTED BY COLONIES THAT SUCCESSFULLY REARED REPRODUCTIVES AND THOSE THAT DID NOT. WE FOUND HOWEVER, THAT NUTRITIONAL INTAKE, CALCULATED AS THE COLONY-LEVEL INTAKE RATE OF NUTRIENT QUANTITIES (PROTEIN, LIPID, AND SUGAR), WAS STRONGLY RELATED TO COLONY GROWTH AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT B.IMPATIENS COLONY PERFORMANCE IS A FUNCTION OF THE ABUNDANCE OF NUTRITIONALLY APPROPRIATE FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. BECAUSE WE DID NOT COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATE THE NUTRITION PROVIDED BY THE PLANT COMMUNITIES IN EACH HABITAT, IT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED HOW B.IMPATIENS POLYLECTIC FORAGING STRATEGIES HELPS THEM SELECT AMONG THE AVAILABLE POLLEN NUTRITIONAL LANDSCAPE IN A VARIETY OF PLANT COMMUNITIES TO OBTAIN A BALANCE OF KEY MACRONUTRIENTS.",COLONY DEVELOPMENT; COLONY REPRODUCTION; FORAGING PREFERENCES; NUTRITIONAL ECOLOGY; POLLEN QUALITY; POLLINATION,LAND-USE; FORAGING DISTANCES; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; TERRESTRIS; FOOD; QUALITY; DECLINES; INFORMATION; PREFERENCES; HYMENOPTERA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"VAUDO, AD (REPRINT AUTHOR), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, CTR POLLINATOR RES, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.;VAUDO, ANTHONY D., FARRELL, LIAM M., PATCH, HARLAND M., GROZINGER, CHRISTINA M., TOOKER, JOHN F., PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, CTR POLLINATOR RES, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.",10.1002/ECE3.4115,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTUREUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE [2014-02219]; NORTH AMERICA POLLINATOR PROTECTION CAMPAIGN,"NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 2014-02219; NORTH AMERICA POLLINATOR PROTECTION CAMPAIGN, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: BEE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROJECT GRANT",2045-7758,11,5765-5776,WILEY,8,2018,ISI000435776600048,67,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",35,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",ADV124PSU.EDU,GK0DI,"VAUDO, AD (REPRINT AUTHOR), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, CTR POLLINATOR RES, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA",ISI,none,PENN STATE UNIV,PENN STATE UNIV,NA,"VAUDO AD, 2018, ECOL EVOL","VAUDO AD, 2018, ECOL EVOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

AS PART OF A LARGER STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN LAND USE ON FEN GRASSLAND VEGETATION, FACTORS INFLUENCING THE SEED SET OF A SHORT-LIVED, ENDANGERED WETLAND PLANT, PEDICULARIS PALUSTRIS, WERE STUDIED. WE CONDUCTED FIELD POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS IN ONE LARGE AND ONE SMALL POPULATION. TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF POLLEN SOURCE ON SEED SET, INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS OF CAGED PLANTS WERE LEFT UNPOLLINATED OR WERE POLLINATED WITH POLLEN FROM THE SAME FLOWER, THE SAME POPULATION OR ANOTHER POPULATION. TO STUDY POLLEN LIMITATION AND FLOWER DISPLAY, WHOLE PLANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO POLLINATOR EXCLOSURE, HAND POLLINATION OR NATURAL POLLINATION. SELF-COMPATIBILITY WAS HIGH, BUT DIFFERED BETWEEN POPULATIONS (61\% AND 97\% OF SEED SET AFTER CROSS-POLLINATION WITHIN POPULATIONS). CROSS-POLLINATION BETWEEN POPULATIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER SEED NUMBER PER CAPSULE. POLLINATOR EXCLOSURE RESULTED IN A VERY LOW SEED SET (<15\% OF NATURAL SEED SET), DESPITE HIGH SELF-COMPATIBILITY. THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATIONS FOR HIGH SELF-COMPATIBILITY IN COMBINATION WITH LOW AUTOFERTILITY ARE GEITONOGAMY AS REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE, SELECTIVE NEUTRALITY OF SELF-COMPATIBILITY AND PHYLOGENETIC CONSTRAINTS. BECAUSE OF LOW AUTOFERTILITY, THE SEED SET IN P. PALUSTRIS DEPENDS ON POLLINATORS. IN THE STUDY POPULATIONS, NATURAL POLLINATION WAS CLEARLY SUFFICIENT FOR MAXIMUM SEED PRODUCTION PER PLANT, BUT SEED SET PER CAPSULE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY POLLEN-LIMITED IN THE SMALLER POPULATION. PLANTS IN THIS POPULATION ALSO HAD A HIGHER MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF SIMULTANEOUSLY OPEN FLOWERS THAN THOSE OF THE LARGE POPULATION (31\% VS. 13\%), WHILE FLOWER LONGEVITY WAS GENERALLY EXTENDED WITHOUT POLLINATION. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT P PALUSTRIS MAY INFLUENCE POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR AND THEREFORE THE RISK OF POLLEN LIMITATION BY FLOWER DISPLAY. P.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS ABOLBODA (XYRIDACEAE) BELONGS TO THE POALES, A PREDOMINANTLY WIND-POLLINATED ORDER WHOSE PHYLOGENY HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED IN RECENT YEARS. THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ABOLBODA PULCHELLA AND A. POARCHON WAS STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE MAIN POLLINATION SYSTEM OF THESE SPECIES, PROVIDING THE FIRST EXPERIMENTAL DATA ON REPRODUCTION IN THE XYRIDACEAE. METHODS A FIELD STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, INCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND BIOLOGY OF THE FLOWERS, INSECT VISITS AND POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR. EXPERIMENTAL POLLINATION TREATMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS AGAMOSPERMY, SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION AND SELF-COMPATIBILITY. POLLINATION SUCCESS WAS DETERMINED BY POLLEN TUBE GROWTH, AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WAS ASSESSED BY FRUIT-AND SEED-SET. KEY RESULTS ABOLBODA PULCHELLA AND A. POARCHON WERE POLLINATED BY APIDAE, MEGACHILIDAE AND HALICTIDAE BEES. THE FLORAL RESOURCES WERE POLLEN AND NECTAR THAT WAS PRODUCED BY STYLAR APPENDAGES, AN UNCOMMOM NECTARY TYPE FOR MONOCOTYLEDONS. THE SPECIES WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE, AND POLLEN TUBE GROWTH FROM SELF-POLLEN WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF CROSS-POLLEN.

BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN ALL THREE LAND USE TYPES, AS DID PHYLOGENETIC COMPOSITION.

BIOL.,"FLORAL TRAITS SUCH AS COLOR AND SIZE ARE HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED IN LILIES, BUT THEIR ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE REMAINS UNCERTAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE COMPARED POLLINATION PROCESSES BETWEEN LILIUM JAPONICUM VAR. ABEANUM AND VAR. JAPONICUM TO CLARIFY HOW THE TWO VARIETIES ARE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT POLLINATORS. LILIUM JAPONICUM VAR. JAPONICUM IS KNOWN TO BE POLLINATED BY MOTHS, AND WE HYPOTHESIZED FROM ITS FLOWER TRAITS THAT VAR. ABEANUM IS POLLINATED BY DIURNAL INSECTS. USING WATERPROOF DIGITAL CAMERAS SET TO A RECORDING INTERVAL OF 1030 S, WE RECORDED FLOWER VISITORS FOR 79 FLOWERS OF VAR. JAPONICUM AND 46 FLOWERS OF VAR. ABEANUM OVER 24-H PERIODS. WE ALSO RECORDED THE NUMBER OF VERSATILE (T-SHAPED) AND RIGID (I-SHAPED) ANTHERS PER FLOWER. FOR VAR. ABEANUM, WE OBSERVED FLOWERS AT 05.00 AND 17.00 HOURS TO DETERMINE FLOWER OPENING TIME AND MEASURED THE INTENSITY OF FLORAL SCENT USING A METAL-OXIDE SEMI-CONDUCTOR ODOR SENSOR. BOTH DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL INSECTS VISITED FLOWERS OF THE TWO VARIETIES, BUT VISITATION OF DIURNAL INSECTS WAS MORE FREQUENT IN VAR. ABEANUM. ANTHERS OF VAR. ABEANUM ARE USUALLY RIGID, AS IN MANY BEE-POLLINATED FLOWERS, WHEREAS THOSE OF VAR. JAPONICUM ARE MOSTLY VERSATILE. ALTHOUGH FLOWERS OF VAR.

FOR. ENTOMOL.,"THE DECLINE OF BUMBLEBEES IN EUROPE HAS BEEN LINKED PRIMARILY TO AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, ALTHOUGH CLIMATE CHANGE ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DISRUPT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS, PARTLY THROUGH AN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF EXTREME SHORT-TERM WEATHER EVENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN FEW ATTEMPTS TO USE TIME-SERIES MODELS TO DETERMINE METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES AFFECTING FORAGER ACTIVITY AT HOURLY TIME PERIODS OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. TIME-SERIES MODELS REQUIRE LARGE DATASETS TO BE RELIABLE. WE DESCRIBE THE USE OF INFRARED DETECTORS AT NEST ENTRANCES TO RECORD FORAGER EXITS/RETURNS FROM 36 CAPTIVE COLONIES OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS AUDAX ON A MIXED FARM IN NORTHERN ENGLAND, RECORDING OVER A 78-DAY PERIOD. OVER 1.73MILLION INDIVIDUAL RECORDS OF FORAGER ACTIVITY WERE OBTAINED. THESE WERE AGGREGATED INTO 1872 HOURLY BLOCKS AND ANALYZED WITH AUTOREGRESSIVE TIME-SERIES MODELS THAT USED NINE METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. FORAGER ACTIVITY WAS POSITIVELY LINKED TO AIR TEMPERATURE AND SOLAR ELEVATION, AND NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH RAINFALL, HUMIDITY AND WIND-SPEED. THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED VARIABILITY IN METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE RESULTS. THE TIME-SERIES MODELS THAT WE DESCRIBE WILL BE USEFUL IN FUTURE ANALYSES OF THE LARGE DATASETS OF FORAGING BEHAVIOUR THAT ARE BECOMING AVAILABLE THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS RADIO-FREQUENCY IDENTIFICATION AND VIDEO TRACKING.",BOMBUS; FORAGING BEHAVIOUR; METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS; TIME-SERIES MODELS,POLLINATOR DECLINES; BEES; NECTAR; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; FLOWERS; WEATHER; RHYTHMS; CROPS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"SANDERSON, RA (REPRINT AUTHOR), NEWCASTLE UNIV, SCH BIOL, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.;SANDERSON, ROY A., GOFFE, LOUIS A., NEWCASTLE UNIV, SCH BIOL, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.;LEIFERT, CARLO, NEWCASTLE UNIV, SCH AGR FOOD \& RURAL DEV, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.",10.1111/AFE.12102,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,LEVERHULME TRUSTLEVERHULME TRUST,"NAFFERTON FARM IS MANAGED BY MR WILLIAM TAYLOR ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, FOOD AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT.

ECOL.,"IN MILKWEEDS (ASCLEPIADACEAE) POLLEN IS PRODUCED IN PAIRED PACKAGES (POLLINIA) AND POLLINATION OCCURS WHEN A POLLINIUM IS INSERTED BY A POLLINATOR INTO A STIGMATIC CHAMBER. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THIS MODE OF POLLEN DELIVERY RESULTS IN PREDOMINANTLY LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN DISPERSAL. THIS ASSERTION WAS TESTED FOR ASCLEPIAS SYRIACA L. A PLANT WHOSE POLLINIA HAD BEEN LABELLED WITH C-14 WAS PLACED WITHIN A LARGE POPULATION OF MILKWEEDS AND A SINGLE SUBJECT UMBEL WAS EXPOSED TO HONEY-BEE POLLINATORS FOR 5 DAYS. HAND POLLINATIONS INVOLVING ANOTHER UMBEL ON THIS PLANT VERIFIED THAT LABELLED POLLINIA DISPERSED TO FLOWERS WITHIN THE UMBEL (GEITONOGAMY), OR TO FLOWERS ON OTHER PLANTS, COULD BE DETECTED BY SCINTILLATION COUNTS. THE LABELLED PLANT WAS AT THE CENTRE OF A 6 X 6 M STUDY PLOT. OF THE 38 INSERTIONS ON THE LABELLED UMBEL, 14 (37\%) WERE FROM THE LABELLED UMBEL ITSELF (GEITONOGAMY). THIRTY LABELLED POLLINIA WERE DETECTED IN UMBELS ON NEIGHBOURING PLANTS WITHIN THE STUDY PLOT. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT FEW LABELLED POLLINIA WERE INSERTED INTO FLOWERS OUTSIDE OF THE STUDY PLOT, ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL CANNOT BE EXCLUDED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT MUCH OF THE POLLEN DISPERSAL WAS SHORT DISTANCE. THIS MAKES POLLEN DISPERSAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THIS SPECIES SIMILAR TO THOSE OF NON-MILKWEED SPECIES.

BOT.,"CENTER DOT BACKGROUND AND AIMS THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY OF TWO SPECIES OF VELLOZIA (VELLOZIACEAE) WITH RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION IN HIGH-ALTITUDE QUARTZITIC FIELDS IN SOUTH-EASTERN BRAZIL WERE STUDIED. VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES IS SHORT, GROWS ON PEBBLY OR SANDY SOIL, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA IS ARBORESCENT, GROWS ON ROCK OUTCROPS, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS. BOTH ARE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND HAVE A SHORT, MASSIVE FLOWERING STRATEGY. THE STUDY AIMED TO ASSOCIATE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE WITH THEIR MICROHABITAT DISTRIBUTION AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY. CENTER DOT METHODS LEAVES FROM 106 AND 139 PLANTS OF V. EPIDENDROIDES AND V. LEPTOPETALA, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLECTED FROM FIVE PATCHES OF EACH SPECIES AND PREPARED FOR ELECTROPHORETIC ANALYSES. CENTER DOT KEY RESULTS FIVE ENZYME SYSTEMS COULD BE RELIABLY SCORED FOR BOTH SPECIES. VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES SHOWED 100 \% OF THE LOCI POLYMORPHIC FOR ALMOST ALL PATCHES. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ALLELES PER LOCUS RANGED BETWEEN 2.2 AND 2.4 AMONG PATCHES. THE WRIGHT'S FIXATION INDEX (F) FOR THIS SPECIES WAS 0.226. A SIGNIFICANT THETA(P) VALUE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE GENETIC DIVERGENCE AMONG PATCHES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA PRESENTED 47.5 \% OF POLYMORPHIC LOCI. ALL LEVELS OF P, A, A(P) AND OF HETEROZYGOSITIES WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF V. EPIDENDROIDES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA SHOWED HIGH INBREEDING WITHIN PATCHES. CENTER DOT CONCLUSIONS THE RELATIVELY HIGH VALUES OF GENETIC DIVERSITY INDICES FOUND FOR V. EPIDENDROIDES MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS LARGE AND WIDESPREAD POPULATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOW VALUES OF GENETIC DIVERSITY FOUND FOR V. LEPTOPETALA MAY BE RELATED TO PHYSICAL ISOLATION ON OUTCROPS AND INTENSIVE FORAGING BY TERRITORIAL HUMMINGBIRDS, WHICH MAY HINDER GENE FLOW AMONG PATCHES, AGGRAVATED BY THE VERY RESTRICTED SEED DISPERSAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GENUS, THAT FACILITATES SIBLING MATING.

ENVIRON.,"THE IMPORTANCE OF ROTATIONAL FALLOWS FOR POLLINATING INSECTS IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED FARMLAND WAS STUDIED IN A THREE-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT. THE FOCUS WAS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT METHOD (UNDERSOWING OR SEED MIXTURE SOWN POST-TILLAGE), SEED MIXTURE (COMPETITIVE FESTUCA PRATENSIS-PHLEUM PRATENSE-TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE OR LESS COMPETITIVE AGROSTIS CAPILLARIS-FESTUCA OVINA MIXTURE) AND DURATION (1 OR 2 YEARS) OF THE FALLOW. THE SEED MIXTURE AND DURATION AFFECTED THE POLLINATORS MORE THAN THE METHOD OF ESTABLISHMENT. POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER IN FALLOWS SOWN WITH LESS COMPETITIVE THAN WITH COMPETITIVE GRASSES AND IT INCREASED IN THE SECOND YEAR. STUBBLE FIELDS REACHED AS HIGH POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS ALREADY DURING THE FIRST YEAR AS FALLOWS WITH LESS COMPETITIVE GRASSES DID IN THE SECOND YEAR. POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHEST IN THOSE TREATMENTS IN WHICH SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWERING PLANTS WAS HIGHEST. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BENEFITS OF ROTATIONAL FALLOWS FOR POLLINATORS INCREASE WHEN THEY ARE ESTABLISHED AS STUBBLE OR USING SEEDS OF LESS COMPETITIVE GRASSES AND WHEN THE FIELD IS FALLOWED FOR (AT LEAST) TWO SUMMERS.

HOWEVER, METHODS THAT CAN GENERATE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT PREDICTIONS AND MAPS OF THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BASED ON EMPIRICAL DATA ARE STILL SCARCE. 2. HERE WE PROPOSE A GENERIC STATISTICAL MODEL TO DERIVE KERNEL FUNCTIONS TO CHARACTERIZE THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY MOBILE AGENTS. THE MODEL IS SIMILAR IN SPIRIT TO A GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL, AND USES DATA OF LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ASSESSED AT TARGET SITES TO ESTIMATE PARAMETERS OF THE KERNEL. THE APPROACH IS TESTED IN A SIMULATION STUDY AND ILLUSTRATED BY AN EMPIRICAL CASE STUDY ON PARASITISM RATES OF THE DIAMONDBACK MOTH PLUTELLA XYLOSTELLA. 3. THE SIMULATION STUDY SHOWS THAT THE SCALE PARAMETER OF THE EXPONENTIAL POWER KERNEL CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH LIMITED BIAS, WHEREAS ESTIMATION OF THE SHAPE PARAMETER IS DIFFICULT. FOR THE CASE STUDY THE MODEL PROVIDES BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ESTIMATES FOR THE KERNEL ASSOCIATED WITH PARASITISM OF P. XYLOSTELLA. THESE ESTIMATES CAN BE USED TO GENERATE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE MAPS FOR EXISTING OR PLANNED LANDSCAPES. THE CASE STUDY REVEALS THAT PREDICTIONS CAN BE SENSITIVE TO THE PARAMETER VALUES FOR THE WIDTH AND SHAPE OF THE KERNEL, AND TO THE LINK FUNCTION USED IN THE STATISTICAL MODEL. 4. IN THE LAST TWO DECADES NUMEROUS EMPIRICAL STUDIES ASSESSED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AT TARGET SITES AND RELATED THESE TO THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE.

IN THIS PAPER WE DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC MODEL TO INVESTIGATE UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN FORAGING EFFICIENCY AND TRAVEL COSTS CAN ALLOW TWO CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING SPECIES TO COEXIST IN SPITE OF CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP IN RESOURCE USE. ONE SPECIES (FLYER) HAS A HIGH BASAL METABOLIC RATE, BUT A LOW RELATIVE COST OF TRAVELLING SUCH THAT IT CAN USE PATCHES AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM ITS CENTRAL PLACE WHILE THE MINIMUM PATCH QUALITY IT CAN ECONOMICALLY USE IS HIGH. THE OTHER SPECIES (FORAGER), BY CONTRAST, HAS A LOWER BASAL METABOLIC RATE, BUT HIGHER RELATIVE COST OF TRAVELLING, AND CAN THEREFORE BE A MORE EFFICIENT FORAGER AND ABLE TO USE FORAGING PATCHES OF LOW QUALITY, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT TOO FAR FROM THE NEST. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COEXISTENCE OF THESE TWO SPECIES CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE, WITH THE FLYER OUTCOMPETING THE FORAGER IN STRUCTURALLY SIMPLE, COARSE-GRAINED, LANDSCAPES WITH ABUNDANT HIGH-QUALITY FORAGE AND THE FORAGER OUTCOMPETING THE FLYER IN FINE-GRAINED HIGHLY DIVERSE LANDSCAPES.

NAT.,"STUDIES OF POLLINATION BIOLOGY ARE LARGELY DIURNALLY BIASED, ESPECIALLY IN PLANT SPECIES WHOSE FLOWERS CONFORM TO DIURNAL POLLINATION SYNDROMES. THOUGH THESE SYNDROMES CAN BE USEFUL IN GENERATING HYPOTHESES REGARDING A SPECIES' PRIMARY POLLINATORS, THEY MAY ALSO LEAD TO INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATION TO FRUIT SET IN LYONIA LUCIDA, AN ERICACEOUS SHRUB OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES WHOSE FLORAL FORM SUGGESTS POLLINATION BY BUMBLE BEES. FLORAL VISITATION TO L. LUCIDA AND POLLEN LOADS OF VISITORS WERE QUANTIFIED IN A POPULATION OF THE SPECIES IN CENTRAL FLORIDA (U.S.A.), AND THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATION TESTED. MATING SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS OF L. LUCIDA WERE ALSO EXAMINED. RESULTS SHOW L. LUCIDA FLOWERS ARE VISITED MAINLY BY NOCTURNAL MOTHS, WHO ARE CAPABLE OF CARRYING LARGE POLLEN LOADS, AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATION IS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF FRUIT SET. IN ADDITION L. LUCIDA AT THE STUDY SITE SHOWS SEVERE BARRIERS TO SELFING AND STRONG POLLEN LIMITATION.

THE FUNGAL PATHOGEN NOSEMA BOMBI WAS RECENTLY FOUND TO BE WIDESPREAD IN DECLINING SPECIES OF NORTH AMERICAN BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS), WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTING AN EXOTIC INTRODUCTION FROM EUROPE. THIS INTERPRETATION HAS BEEN HAMPERED BY A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF GLOBAL GENETIC VARIATION, GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN, AND CHANGING PREVALENCE PATTERNS OF N. BOMBI IN DECLINING NORTH AMERICAN POPULATIONS. THUS, THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL EMERGENCE OF N. BOMBI AND ITS POTENTIAL ROLE IN BUMBLE BEE DECLINE REMAIN SPECULATIVE. WE ANALYZE NOSEMA PREVALENCE AND GENETIC VARIATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE FROM 1980, BEFORE AN ALLEGED INTRODUCTION IN THE EARLY 1990S, TO 2011, EXTRACTING NOSEMA DNA FROM BOMBUS NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTION SPECIMENS FROM ACROSS THIS TIME PERIOD. NOSEMA BOMBI PREVALENCE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM LOW DETECTABLE FREQUENCY IN THE 1980S TO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FREQUENCY IN THE MID-TO LATE-1990S, CORRESPONDING TO A PERIOD OF REPORTED MASSIVE INFECTIOUS OUTBREAK OF N. BOMBI IN COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEE REARING STOCKS IN NORTH AMERICA. DESPITE THE INCREASED FREQUENCY, WE FIND NO CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF AN EXOTIC N.

AS WITH HERBIVORE-PLANT INTERACTIONS, TOXIC REWARDS MAY IMPACT GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST FORAGERS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. 2. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE TOXIC PLANT ACONITUM SEPTENTRIONALE (RANUNCULACEAE). THIS PLANT IS VISITED BY SPECIALIST AND GENERALIST BUMBLEBEES. ALKALOID CONCENTRATIONS AND PROFILES FOR THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A. SEPTENTRIONALE WERE ANALYSED TO DETECT A POTENTIAL CHEMICAL TOXICITY OF FLORAL REWARDS. IN THE SAME WAY, SEQUESTRATION OF ALKALOIDS WAS TESTED ON A POLLEN SPECIALIST SPECIES BOMBUS CONSOBRINUS AND A GENERALIST SPECIES BOMBUS WURFLENII. 3. A LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-QUADRUPOLE TIME-OF-FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO DISCRIMINATE 16 MAJOR COMPOUNDS IN THE PLANT. THESE ALKALOIDS WERE PRESENT IN ALL PARTS OF THE PLANT, BUT IN DIFFERENT RATIOS. THE CONCENTRATION WAS HIGH IN THE ROOTS BUT ALSO IN POLLEN, PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF CHEMICAL PROTECTION OF THIS REWARD. BY CONTRAST, NECTAR HAD THE LOWEST CONCENTRATION OF ALKALOIDS. ONLY SIX ALKALOIDS WERE DETECTED IN B. CONSOBRINUS TISSUES, AT TRACE LEVELS. FOR THE GENERALIST BUMBLEBEE B. WURFLENII, NO TRACES OF ALKALOIDS WERE DETECTED. 4. LAPPACONITINE WAS THE MAJOR ALKALOID COMPOUND IN POLLEN, NECTAR AND B. CONSOBRINUS TISSUES. LOW ACCUMULATION OF ALKALOIDS IN B.

BEEF CATTLE FEED YARDS USE LARGE QUANTITIES OF VETERINARY PHARMACEUTICALS TO PROMOTE CATTLE GROWTH AND HEALTH, ALONG WITH INSECTICIDES TO CONTROL INSECT PESTS, WHEREAS ROW CROP-BASED AGRICULTURE RELIES ON HERBICIDES, FUNGICIDES, AND INSECTICIDES TO INCREASE YIELDS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE OCCURRENCE OF AGROCHEMICALS BEYOND FEED YARD AND ROW CROP AGRICULTURE BOUNDARIES IN UNCULTIVATED, MARGINAL AREAS, RAISING CONCERN THAT MIGRATORY POLLINATORS AND POLLINATORS INDIGENOUS TO THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS FREQUENTING THESE REMAINING HABITAT CORRIDORS MAY BECOME EXPOSED TO TOXIC AGROCHEMICALS. LARVAE OF THE PAINTED LADY BUTTERFLY (VANESSA CARDUI) WERE USED TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL TOXICITY OF AGROCHEMICALS USED ON FEED YARDS AND IN ROW CROP AGRICULTURE AMONG POLLINATORS. MOXIDECTIN, AN ANTIPARASITICIDE USED ON BEEF CATTLE FEED YARDS, WAS DETERMINED TO BE EXTREMELY TOXIC TO V. CARDUI LARVAE, WITH A LETHAL DOSE AT WHICH 50\% OF LARVAE DIED OF 2.1 +/- 0.1 NG/G.

HOWEVER, MOXIDECTIN WAS THE ONLY CHEMICAL THAT PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT TOXIC EFFECTS AT ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS.

BAKER (IRIS: IRIDACEAE) GROW THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AND HAVE LARGE AND DARK-COLOURED FLOWERS BUT NO NECTAR REWARD AVAILABLE TO FLOWER VISITORS. CONSEQUENTLY, NO REWARD-COLLECTING POLLINATORS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED VISITING THE FLOWERS DURING DAYTIME. THE ONLY VISITORS ARE SOLITARY MALE BEES (EUCERA SPP.: APIDAE) THAT ENTER THE FLOWERS AT DUSK AND STAY THERE OVERNIGHT. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE MATING SYSTEM OF ONCOCYCLUS IRISES, AND THE ROLE OF NIGHT-SHELTERING MALE BEES IN THEIR POLLINATION SYSTEM. POLLEN VIABILITY IN I. HAYNEI ON MT. GILBOA WAS VERY HIGH (> 90\%) THROUGHOUT ALL FLORAL LIFE STAGES. STIGMAS WERE RECEPTIVE IN BUDS AND IN OPEN FLOWERS, BUT NOT IN OLDER ONES. SELF-POLLINATION YIELDED NO FRUITS IN THREE SPECIES, CONFIRMING COMPLETE SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN ONCOCYCLUS IRISES. ON AVERAGE, 1.9 FLOWERS WERE VISITED BY EACH MALE BEE BEFORE IT SETTLED FOR THE NIGHT IN THE LAST ONE. MOREOVER, IRIS POLLEN WAS PRESENT ON THE DORSAL SIDE OF 38.8\% OF MALES CAUGHT SHELTERING IN FLOWER MODELS MOUNTED NEAR AN I. ATROFUSCA POPULATION, INDICATING THAT POLLEN IS TRANSFERRED BETWEEN FLOWERS BY NIGHT-SHELTERING SOLITARY MALE BEES.

J. PLANT SCI.,"PREMISE OF RESEARCH. SELECTION ON FLORAL TRAITS BY POLLINATORS IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE DIVERSIFICATION OF FLORAL PHENOTYPES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF SPECIES BOUNDARIES IN SYMPATRY. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY FEW STUDIES HAVE TESTED THE GENERALITY OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS IN NATURAL SYSTEMS, AND FEWER STILL HAVE EXAMINED MULTIPLE PHENOTYPES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO POLLINATORS. METHODOLOGY. WE CREATED F-2 HYBRIDS BETWEEN TWO SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF DIOECIOUS SILENE TO SEGREGATE GROUPS OF FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS FROM THEIR ASSOCIATED POLLINATION SYNDROMES. ARRAYS OF HYBRID FEMALE PLANTS WERE PLACED AMONG NATURAL FIELD POPULATIONS, WHERE WE OBSERVED NATIVE POLLINATORS (DIURNAL AND CREPUSCULAR) IN ORDER TO ADDRESS WHICH INDIVIDUAL TRAITS OR GROUPS OF TRAITS INFLUENCED POLLINATOR VISITATION, SEED SET, OR PREDATION. POLLINATOR VISITS INCLUDED BEES, BEE FLIES, BUTTERFLIES, AND MOTHS, INCLUDING THE MUTUALIST NURSERY POLLINATOR/SEED PREDATOR HADENA BICRURIS. PIVOTAL RESULTS. REGARDLESS OF TIME OF DAY, LARGE FLOWERS AND TALL PLANTS HAD HIGHER VISITATION RATES. HOWEVER, LARGE FLOWERS AND TALL PLANTS WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO BE PREYED ON BY H. BICRURIS. IN ALL TREATMENTS, POLLINATORS SHOWED NO PREFERENCES FOR FLOWER COLOR, DESPITE THE HYPOTHESIZED GENERAL IMPORTANCE OF COLOR FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. CONCLUSIONS.

WE USED SENTINEL PLANTS OF BRASSICA RAPA TO EXAMINE HOW THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMUNITY NETWORK INFLUENCES PLANT REPRODUCTION. DIPTERA WAS THE MOST COMMON ORDER OF FLOWER VISITORS AT EVERY SITE. SYRPHIDAE VISITS WERE THE STRONGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE NUMBER OF FERTILIZED PODS, WHILE VISITS BY SYRPHIDAE, HYMENOPTERA AND LEPIDOPTERA HAD THE STRONGEST EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PER POD. SENTINEL POTS AT FOREST SITES WERE VISITED BY MORE UNIQUE SPECIES (I.E. SPECIES WITH HIGHER D') THAN SITES IN OTHER LAND USES, AND DAIRY SITES HAD MORE VISITORS THAT WERE COMMON ACROSS THE NETWORK.

THE INSECT-LIKE FLOWERS OF THE OPHRYS ORCHIDS ARE ADAPTED TO SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE POLLINATION THROUGH PSEUDOCOPULATION, PROVIDING CHEMICAL, VISUAL, AND TACTILE STIMULI FOR MALE INSECTS. ALTHOUGH THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE ODOR BOUQUET OF SEVERAL SPECIES HAS LONG BEEN IDENTIFIED, THE PRECISE SITE OF FRAGRANCE PRODUCTION IN THE LABELLUM REMAINS UNKNOWN FOR MOST SPECIES, AND LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE VISUAL AND TACTILE SIGNALS PROVIDED BY THE LABELLUM FOR POLLINATORS. HERE, THE OCCURRENCE OF AN OSMOPHORE IS INVESTIGATED AND THE LABELLUM MICROMORPHOLOGY IS CHARACTERIZED IN DETAIL FOR OPHRYS BOMBYLIFLORA AND OPHRYS TENTHREDINIFERA, TWO CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES POLLINATED BY EUCERA BEES.

THIS VARIABILITY MAY BE A BY-PRODUCT OF THE FORAGING ACTIVITY OF INSECT POLLINATORS. ALTERNATIVELY, PLANTS MAY BE SELECTED TO PRODUCE HIGHLY VARIABLE REWARDS TO REDUCE CONSECUTIVE VISITATION BY RISK-AVERSE POLLINATORS, THUS DIMINISHING WITHIN-PLANT POLLEN TRANSFER. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE ROLES OF POLLINATOR CONTROL VS. PLANT CONTROL OVER NECTAR VARIABILITY IN THE BEE-POLLINATED SHRUB ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS L. (LAMIACEAE). WE SAMPLED NECTAR PRODUCTION, STANDING CROP AND POLLINATOR VISITS IN THREE SHRUBS OF ONE POPULATION OVER 17 DAYS DURING ONE BLOOMING SEASON. NECTAR PRODUCTION RATES WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE (CV=1.48), AND INCREASED AFTER RAINY DAYS. NECTAR STANDING CROPS WERE EVEN MORE VARIABLE (CV=2.16), DECREASED WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURES, AND INCREASED WITH TIME SINCE THE LAST RAIN. POLLINATOR VISIT RATES DECREASED WITH VARIABILITY IN NECTAR STANDING CROPS, INCREASED WITH FLOWER NUMBER PER SHRUB, AND WERE UNAFFECTED BY VARIABILITY IN NECTAR PRODUCTION RATES. REPEATED SAMPLING OF MARKED FLOWERS REVEALED NO CORRELATION BETWEEN THEIR NECTAR STANDING CROPS AND PRODUCTION RATES. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ROLE OF REWARD VARIANCE IN REDUCING POLLINATOR VISITS, BUT SUGGEST THAT PLANTS ARE NOT IN COMPLETE CONTROL OF THIS VARIABILITY. RATHER, PLANT-GENERATED VARIABILITY CAN BE MODIFIED BY INTENSIVE FORAGING ACTIVITY OF POLLINATORS.

J. ADV. MANUF. TECHNOL.,"PROCESS PLANNING (PP) HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS DESIGN AND OPERATIONS. VOLUME DECOMPOSITION AND MACHINABLE VOLUMES (MVS) OR MACHINING FEATURES DETERMINATION IS THE CORE ACTIVITY IN PROCESS PLANNING. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES EXTRACTION OF ELEMENTARY VOLUMES (EVS), MERGING OR CLUSTERING EVS TO CONSTRUCT FEASIBLE MVS AND FINALLY SELECTING AN OPTIMAL COMBINATION OF MVS. DEVELOPMENT OF MVS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY, SO THAT BETTER SOLUTION IS OBTAINED BY BETTER DEVELOPED MVS.

THESE VARIATIONS REPRESENT THE RAW MATERIAL THAT NATURAL SELECTION CAN MAGNIFY, EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERGENCE AND DIVERSIFICATION. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES FLORAL VARIABILITY IN ROSMARINUS OFFICINALIS. A MEDITERRANEAN SHRUB. METHODS NINE POPULATIONS WERE SELECTED IN THREE MAJOR SOUTHERN SPANISH HABITATS (COAST, LOWLAND AND MOUNTAINS) ALONG AN ELEVATION GRADIENT. FLOWER SAMPLES FROM RANDOMLY CHOSEN PLANTS WERE COLLECTED FROM EACH POPULATION, AND A TOTAL OF 641 FLOWERS FROM 237 SHRUBS WERE WEIGHED WHILE STILL FRESH TO THE NEAREST 0.1 MG. LEAVES FROM THE SAME PLANTS WERE ALSO MEASURED. VARIATIONS AMONG HABITATS, SITES AND PLANTS WERE EXPLORED WITH GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANOVA. LEAF-FLOWER COVARIATION WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. KEY RESULTS MOST (58\%) MASS IN FLOWERS WAS ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE COROLLA, WHOSE LINEAR DIMENSIONS CORRELATED DIRECTLY WITH FLOWER MASS. AVERAGED OVER PLANTS, THE MASS OF A FLOWER VARIED BETWEEN 12 MG AND 38 MG. HABITAT, SITE (WITHIN HABITAT) AND SHRUB IDENTITY HAD SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON MASS VARIANCE. FLOWERS FROM THE COAST WERE THE SMALLEST (17 MG) AND THOSE FROM THE MOUNTAINS THE LARGEST (25 MG ON AVERAGE). A PATTERN OF CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING FLOWER SIZE WITH ELEVATION EMERGED WHICH WAS LARGELY UNCOUPLED FROM THE GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN OF LEAF SIZE VARIATION. CONCLUSIONS AS REGARDS FLOWER SIZE, A GREAT POTENTIAL TO LOCAL DIFFERENTIATION EXISTS IN ROSMARINUS. OBSERVED DIVERGENCES ACCORD WITH A REGIME OF LARGE-BODIED POLLINATOR SELECTION IN THE MOUNTAINS, BUT ALSO WITH RESOURCE-COST HYPOTHESES ON FLORAL EVOLUTION THAT POSTULATE THAT REDUCED COROLLAS ARE ADVANTAGEOUS UNDER PREVAILINGLY STRESSFUL CONDITIONS.

J. BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: IN INDIA AND ELSEWHERE, TRANSGENIC BT EGGPLANT (SOLANUM MELONGENA) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO REDUCE INSECT HERBIVORE DAMAGE, BUT PUBLISHED STUDIES OF THE POTENTIAL FOR POLLEN-MEDIATED, CROP-TO-WILD GENE FLOW ARE SCANT. THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR RISK ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS IN SITU CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR WILD GERMPLASM. METHODS: IN 2010-2014, WE SURVEYED 23 POPULATIONS OF WILD/WEEDY EGGPLANT (SOLANUM INSANUM, KNOWN AS WILD BRINJAL), CARRIED OUT HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS, AND OBSERVED POLLINATORS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR CROP-TO-WILD GENE FLOW IN SOUTHERN INDIA. KEY RESULTS: WILD BRINJAL IS A SPINY, LOW-GROWING PERENNIAL COMMONLY FOUND IN DISTURBED SITES SUCH AS ROADSIDES, WASTELANDS, AND SPARSELY VEGETATED AREAS NEAR VILLAGES AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. FOURTEEN OF THE 23 WILD POPULATIONS IN OUR STUDY OCCURRED WITHIN 0.5 KM OF CULTIVATED BRINJAL AND AT LEAST NINE FLOWERED IN SYNCHRONY WITH THE CROP. HAND CROSSES BETWEEN WILD AND CULTIVATED BRINJAL RESULTED IN SEED SET AND VIABLE F-1 PROGENY. WILD BRINJAL FLOWERS THAT WERE BAGGED TO EXCLUDE POLLINATORS DID NOT SET FRUIT, AND FRUIT SET FROM MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION WAS LOW. THE EXSERTED STIGMAS OF WILD BRINJAL ARE LIKELY TO PROMOTE OUTCROSSING. THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS APPEARED TO BE BEES (AMEGILLA, XYLOCOPA, NOMIA, AND HETEROTRIGONA SPP.), WHICH ALSO WERE OBSERVED FORAGING FOR POLLEN ON CROP BRINJAL. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HYBRIDIZATION IS POSSIBLE BETWEEN CULTIVATED AND WILD BRINJAL IN SOUTHERN INDIA. THUS, AS PART OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS, WE ASSUME THAT TRANSGENES FROM THE CROP COULD SPREAD TO WILD BRINJAL POPULATIONS THAT OCCUR NEARBY.",BRINJAL; CROP-WILD HYBRIDIZATION; FLOWERING TIMES; GENETIC RESOURCES; INDIA; POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS; SEED SET; SOLANUM INSANUM; TRANSGENIC; WILD EGGPLANT; WILD GERMPLASM,GENE FLOW; BT BRINJAL; TRANSGENE; INCANUM; INTROGRESSION; RESISTANCE; HERBIVORY; FECUNDITY; RELATIVES; ESCAPE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,17,"SNOW, AA (REPRINT AUTHOR), OHIO STATE UNIV, DEPT EVOLUT ECOL \& ORGANISMAL BIOL, 318 W 12TH AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.;DAVIDAR, PRIYA, RAJKUMAR, MUTHU, PONDICHERRY UNIV, DEPT ECOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, PONDICHERRY 605014, INDIA.;SNOW, ALLISON A., MUTEGI, EVANS, OHIO STATE UNIV, DEPT EVOLUT ECOL \& ORGANISMAL BIOL, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA.;PASQUET, REMY, IRD, UR 072, LEGS, F-91198 GIF SUR YVETTE, FRANCE.;PASQUET, REMY, UNIV PARIS 11, F-91400 ORSAY, FRANCE.;DAUNAY, MARIE-CHRISTINE, INRA, UNITE GENET \& AMELIORAT FRUITS \& LEGUMES, UR1052, F-84143 MONTFAVET, FRANCE.",10.3732/AJB.1400404,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,LILLIAN GOLDMAN CHARITABLE TRUST,"THE AUTHORS THANK THE LILLIAN GOLDMAN CHARITABLE TRUST FOR FUNDING THIS RESEARCH; H.

ENTOMOL.,"RECENT DECLINES IN MANAGED AND FERAL HONEY BEE POPULATIONS HAVE GREATLY INCREASED INTEREST IN THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF WILD POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURAL POLLINATION. PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO L.) HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO BE SERVED BY WILD POLLINATORS BECAUSE OF A RELIABLE AND WIDESPREAD GROUP OF BEE SPECIES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR FLOWERS, INCLUDING BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.), AND, IN THE AMERICAS, TWO GENERA OF SPECIALIST GROUND NESTING BEES (PEPONAPIS AND XENOGLOSSA). WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL KEY FAT-M MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ON BEE ABUNDANCE IN PUMPKIN ON 20 FARMS IN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND DURING SUMMER 2006. WE EVALUATED BEE ABUNDANCE WITH RESPECT TO TILLAGE, IRRIGATION PRACTICES, SOIL PROPERTIES, NATURAL HABITAT (FOREST AND GRASSLAND), FLOWERING CROP, AND DISTURBED AREAS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINED NEST SITE PREFERENCE (WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF CROP AREAS) OF PEPONAPIS PRUINOSA (SAY) AT ONE FARM AND IN A LARGE SCREENHOUSE. WE FOUND P. PRUINOSA NESTING PREFERENTIALLY WITHIN CROP AREAS AND NEAR THE VINES AND LEAVES OF THEIR HOST PLANT. ALTHOUGH THESE BEES TYPICALLY PLACE SOME OF THEIR BROOD CELLS WITHIN TILLAGE DEPTH, WE DID NOT FIND A TILLAGE EFFECT ON THEIR ABUNDANCE AT FLOWERS. WE FOUND A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SOIL CLAY CONTENT (R-2=0.24, P=0.03) AND A POSITIVE EFFECT OF IRRIGATION (F-1,F- 15=12.2, P < 0.001) ON P. PRUINOSA ABUNDANCE.

FURTHERMORE, THE AVAILABLE STUDIES GENERALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF NECTAR ROBBING ON FEMALE FITNESS, DISREGARDING THE MALE COMPONENT. HERE WE MEASURED THE EFFECTS OF THE NECTAR-ROBBING BUMBLEBEES ON MALE (MEASURED AS POLLEN ANALOGUE FLOW DISTANCE) AND FEMALE (MEASURED AS SEED PRODUCTION) REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE INSECT-DEPENDENT POLYGALA VAYREDAE, A NARROW ENDEMIC SPECIES FROM THE PRE-PYRENEES (SPAIN). INTENSE NECTAR ROBBING BY BUMBLEBEES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NECTAR AVAILABLE TO LEGITIMATE POLLINATORS IN THE STUDIED POPULATION, AND THIS REDUCTION AFFECTED BOTH MALE AND FEMALE FITNESS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN FLUORESCENT DYE DISPERSION BETWEEN ROBBED AND NON-ROBBED FLOWERS WITHIN THE POPULATION. FLUORESCENT DYES FROM NON-ROBBED FLOWERS WERE DISPERSED TO LARGER DISTANCES AND OVER A LARGER NUMBER OF FLOWERS WHEN COMPARED WITH ROBBED ONES. MOREOVER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN BOTH FRUIT SET AND SEED OVULE RATIOS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WITH NON-ROBBED FLOWERS PRESENTING HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, NO EFFECT ON SEED WEIGHT WAS DETECTED AMONG TREATMENTS. THE DATA OBTAINED SUGGEST THAT IN THIS SPECIES, NECTAR ROBBING HAS IMPORTANT INDIRECT AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON PLANT FECUNDITY, THROUGH BOTH MALE AND FEMALE FUNCTIONS, DUE TO A MODIFICATION IN THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF LEGITIMATE VISITORS.",BUMBLEBEES; FEMALE FITNESS; FORAGING BEHAVIOUR; MALE FITNESS; NECTAR ROBBER; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS,IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA POLEMONIACEAE; MACLEANIA-BULLATA ERICACEAE; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; FLUORESCENT DYE; BUMBLE BEES; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; SEED PRODUCTION; FLORAL NECTAR; POLLEN; BEHAVIOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,25,"CASTRO, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, FAC SCI, DEPT BOT, BENATSKA 2, CZ-12801 PRAGUE 2, CZECH REPUBLIC.;CASTRO, SILVIA, SILVEIRA, PAULO, UNIV AVEIRO, CESAM, P-3810193 AVEIRO, PORTUGAL.;CASTRO, SILVIA, SILVEIRA, PAULO, UNIV AVEIRO, DEPT BIOL, P-3810193 AVEIRO, PORTUGAL.;CASTRO, SILVIA, NAVARRO, LUIS, UNIV VIGO, FAC BIOL, DEPT PLANT BIOL \& SOIL SCI, VIGO 36200, SPAIN.",10.1007/S11258-008-9424-Z,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYPORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY [FCT/BD/10901/2002]; XUNTA DE GALICIAXUNTA DE GALICIA [PGIDT04PXIC31003PN]; SPANISH DGICYTSPANISH GOVERNMENT [CGL2006-13847-CO2-02],"THE AUTHORS THANK THE DEPARTAMENTO DE MEDI AMBIENT OF GENERALITAT DE CATALUNA AND THE CONSORSI D'ALTA GARROTXA FOR ALLOWING THIS RESEARCH AND THE PARC NATURAL DE LA ZONA VOLCANICA DE LA GARROTXA FOR ALL THE ASSISTANCE.

INSECT BEHAV.,"BUMBLEBEES DEMONSTRATE AN EXTENSIVE CAPACITY FOR LEARNING COMPLEX MOTOR SKILLS TO MAXIMISE EXPLOITATION OF FLORAL REWARDS. THIS ABILITY IS WELL STUDIED IN NECTAR COLLECTION BUT ITS ROLE IN POLLEN FORAGING IS LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD. FLORAL SONICATION IS USED BY BEES TO EXTRACT POLLEN FROM SOME PLANT SPECIES WITH ANTHERS WHICH MUST BE VIBRATED (BUZZED) TO RELEASE POLLEN. POLLEN REMOVAL IS DETERMINED BY SONICATION CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE, AND THUS THE ABILITY TO OPTIMISE SONICATION SHOULD ALLOW BEES TO MAXIMISE THE POLLEN COLLECTION. WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF THE BUFF-TAILED BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) TO MODIFY THE FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE OF THEIR BUZZES WITH INCREASING EXPERIENCE MANIPULATING FLOWERS OF THE BUZZ-POLLINATED PLANT SOLANUM ROSTRATUM. WE ANALYSED FLIGHT AND FEEDING VIBRATIONS GENERATED BY NA < VE WORKERS ACROSS FEEDING BOUTS. FEEDING BUZZES WERE OF A HIGHER FREQUENCY AND A LOWER AMPLITUDE THAN FLIGHT BUZZES. BOTH FLIGHT AND FEEDING BUZZES HAD REDUCED AMPLITUDES WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF FORAGING TRIPS. HOWEVER, THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR FEEDING BUZZES WAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEIR FLIGHT BUZZES AS BUMBLEBEE WORKERS GAINED EXPERIENCE MANIPULATING FLOWERS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BUMBLEBEES ARE ABLE TO MODIFY THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THEIR BUZZES WITH EXPERIENCE MANIPULATING BUZZ-POLLINATED FLOWERS.

LANDIS DA,LANDIS DA,DESIGNING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES FOR BIODIVERSITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,BASIC APPL. ECOL.,"SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED TO FEED AND FUEL A GROWING HUMAN POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT MODEL OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION WHICH PRODUCES HIGH YIELDS HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY, ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION, AND CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. A KEY CONSEQUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION IS LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION, WHERE ONCE HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES CONTAIN INCREASINGLY FEWER CROP AND NON-CROP HABITATS. LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION EXACERBATES BIODIVERSITY LOSSES WHICH LEADS TO REDUCTIONS IN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ON WHICH AGRICULTURE DEPENDS. IN RECENT DECADES, CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON MITIGATING THESE NEGATIVE IMPACTS, PRIMARILY VIA MANAGEMENT OF HABITATS TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY AND ENHANCE SERVICES AT THE LOCAL SCALE. WHILE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS INTERACT, MODIFYING OVERALL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IS SELDOM CONSIDERED DUE TO LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS. I PROPOSE THAT THE LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DUE TO LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY A CONCERTED EFFORT TO FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. DESIGNING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES WILL REQUIRE THAT SCIENTISTS WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE MIX OF DESIRED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, EVALUATE CURRENT LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THOSE GOALS, AND IMPLEMENT TARGETED MODIFICATIONS TO ACHIEVE THEM. I EVALUATE THE CURRENT STATUS OF LANDSCAPE DESIGN, RANGING FROM FUNDAMENTAL ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO RESULTING GUIDELINES AND SOCIOECONOMIC TOOLS. WHILE RESEARCH GAPS REMAIN, THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR ECOLOGISTS TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, STAKEHOLDERS, AND POLICYMAKERS IN EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY TO FOSTER AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN FOR SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT BIODIVERSITY SERVICES.

THE SCALE AT WHICH CROP-VISITING BEES USE RESOURCES IN THE LANDSCAPE CAN VARY REGIONALLY, AND HAS NOT BEEN CHARACTERIZED IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF SEMINATURAL LAND COVER ON WILD BEE VISITATION FREQUENCY TO CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS L.) AND ON WILD BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ON 10 ORGANIC FARMS IN INDIANA. WE ESTIMATED THE SPATIAL SCALE AT WHICH THE EFFECTS OF LAND COVER WERE STRONGEST, AND ALSO EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF NONLANDSCAPE FACTORS ON WILD BEES. THE VISITATION FREQUENCY OF WILD BEES TO CUCUMBER WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF SEMINATURAL LAND IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, AND THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS STRONGEST WITHIN 250 M OF THE CUCUMBER PATCH. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF WILD CUCUMBER VISITORS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY LAND COVER AT ANY SPATIAL SCALE, NOR BY ANY OF THE NONLANDSCAPE FACTORS WE CONSIDERED. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT WILD, CROP VISITING BEES BENEFIT FROM SEMINATURAL AREAS IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, AND BENEFIT MOST STRONGLY FROM SEMINATURAL AREAS WITHIN 250 M OF THE CROP FIELD.

WILD BEES PROVIDE POLLINATION SERVICES TO WILD AND CROP PLANTS, AND RESPONSE DIVERSITY MIGHT INSURE THIS FUNCTION AGAINST CHANGING CLIMATE. TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BEE SPECIES DIFFER IN THEIR RESPONSE TO INCREASING WINTER TEMPERATURE, WE STORED COCOONS OF NINE BEE SPECIES AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES DURING THE WINTER (1.5-9.5 A DEGREES C). BEE SPECIES DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THEIR RESPONSES (WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT AT EMERGENCE AND EMERGENCE DATE). THE DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE DURING THE WINTER EXPLAINED SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES. BEE SPECIES OVERWINTERING AS ADULTS GENERALLY SHOWED DECREASED WEIGHT AND EARLIER EMERGENCE WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE, WHEREAS BEE SPECIES OVERWINTERING IN PRE-IMAGINAL STAGES SHOWED WEAKER OR EVEN OPPOSITE RESPONSES. THIS MEANS THAT WINTER WARMING WILL LIKELY AFFECT SOME BEE SPECIES NEGATIVELY BY INCREASING ENERGY EXPENDITURE, WHILE OTHERS ARE LESS SENSITIVE PRESUMABLY DUE TO DIFFERENT PHYSIOLOGY. LIKEWISE, SPECIES PHENOLOGIES WILL RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO WINTER WARMING, POTENTIALLY AFFECTING PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS.

MANAGE.,"SOME OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE TAXA FOR FORESTRY ARE INTERSPECIFIC F-1 HYBRIDS GROWN AS EXOTICS IN THE TROPICS AND SUBTROPICS. ATTRIBUTES OF RESILIENCE, ADAPTABILITY AND VIGOUR WHICH ENGENDER THE HYBRIDS FOR WOOD PRODUCTION, MAY ALSO EXACERBATE THE RISK THEY PRESENT FROM GENE FLOW TO NATIVE SPECIES GENE POOLS OR TO LOCAL ECOLOGIES AS WEEDS. TO DETERMINE THE BIOLOGICAL AND GENETIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE EXTENT OF HYBRIDISATION, WE EXAMINE THE DISTRIBUTION AND GENEALOGY OF WILDLINGS SURROUNDING PLANTINGS OF LOCALLY-EXOTIC CORYMBIA TORELLIANA (SECTION CADAGERIA) NEAR NATIVE C. HENRYI (SECTION MACULATAE) IN NORTHERN NEW SOUTH WALES. OUR STUDY SHOWED PRE-MATING AND PRE- AND POST-ZYGOTIC BARRIERS WERE INCOMPLETE, WITH IN SITU GENERATION AND NATURAL ESTABLISHMENT OF BOTH F-1 HYBRIDS (N=3) AND ADVANCED GENERATION HYBRIDS UNDER THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS BORDERING NATIVE FOREST. AS HYBRIDS WERE LOCATED ON ALLUVIAL FLATS EXPOSED TO FROST, THEY ALSO LIKELY HAVE AN EXTENDED ECOLOGICAL RANGE RELATIVE TO NATIVE C. HENRYI. DESPITE THE LIKELY GENERATION OF LARGE VIABLE SEED CROPS ON F-1 TREES AT THE SITE OVER MANY YEARS, ESTABLISHMENT SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL OF ADVANCED GENERATION HYBRIDS MAY BE LOW, AS ONLY 5 IMMATURE AND NO MATURE ADVANCED GENERATION HYBRIDS WERE IDENTIFIED. PROPAGATION AND GENETIC ANALYSIS OF A SEED CROP FROM ONE F-1 WILDLING SHOWED EARLY SURVIVAL AND VIGOUR OF SEEDLINGS IN CULTIVATION WAS HIGH, AND THAT AT LEAST FOR SOME F-1 IN SOME SEASONS, BACKCROSSING TO THE RECURRENT NATIVE C HENRYI PARENT IS FAVOURED (60\%), WHEREAS SELFING (10\%) AND CROSSING WITH OTHER F-1 (30\%) WAS LESS FREQUENT. TRANSPORT OF SEED BY STINGLESS BEES PROBABLY ACCOUNTED FOR LONG DISTANCE DISPERSAL FROM C TORELLIANA, BUT THIS MECHANISM DOES NOT APPEAR TO SUPPLEMENT GRAVITY-DISPERSAL OF SEED FROM THE F-1. COUPLED WITH OTHER EVIDENCE FROM STUDIES OF BEE BEHAVIOUR, CONTROLLED POLLINATION IN CORYMBIA SP., AND LONG-TERM FITNESS IN SECOND GENERATION EUCALYPT HYBRIDS, WE ANTICIPATE GENE FLOW VIA POLLEN RATHER THAN SEED WILL BE THE GREATER CHALLENGE FOR MANAGING THE RISK OF INTROGRESSION OF C. TORELLIANA ANCESTRY INTO NATIVE SPECIES FROM THE PLANTED F-1 HYBRID. IF LARGE SOURCES OF F-1 POLLEN BECOME AVAILABLE TO COMPETE WITH NATIVE POLLEN, GENE FLOW WILL PROBABLY BE FREQUENT AND HYBRIDS MAY ESTABLISH IN DISTURBED CONDITIONS AND IN HABITATS BEYOND THE ECOLOGICAL RANGE OF THEIR NATIVE PARENT.

BEE-FRIENDLY PEST MANAGEMENT, IMPROVING NATIVE BEE HABITATS WITHIN AGRO-FOREST ECOSYSTEMS AND FOSTERING THE HUSBANDRY OF NATIVE BEE SPECIES ARE THREE WIDELY RECOGNIZED STRATEGIES TO CONSERVE THE LOCAL POLLINATING FAUNA. WE ATTEMPTED AT ELICITING FARMERS' VALUATION OF THESE MEASURES AND THAT OF THEIR POTENTIAL EFFECT ON LOCAL NATIVE BEES, BY CONDUCTING A CHOICE EXPERIMENT WITH 198 LONGAN (DIMOCARPUS LONGAN) FARMERS. THE RESULTS OF A MIXED LOGIT MODEL INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY IN FARMERS' PREFERENCES, PART OF WHICH WAS EXPLAINED BY THE RESPONDENTS' ATTITUDE TOWARDS NATIVE BEES, AMONG OTHER IDIOSYNCRATIC VARIABLES SUCH AS GENDER. WE ALSO DETERMINED A GENERALLY POSITIVE WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR THE ABOVE MENTIONED CONSERVATION MEASURES, WHICH IMPLEMENTED TOGETHER WERE VALUED AT APPROX.

THE FORMER TWO GENERA HAVE BEEN SEPARATED PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF CHARACTERS PERTAINING TO ANTHER MORPHOLOGY. COMBINED MOLECULAR AND MORPHOLOGICAL PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE GENERIC LIMITS, RECONSTRUCT PATTERNS OF MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTER EVOLUTION, AND IDENTIFY CLADES WITHIN THE TRIBE. METHODOLOGY. TO TEST THE MONOPHYLY OF BLAKEA AND TOPOBEA, WE ANALYZED 111 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS, NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER REGION, THE ACCD-PSAI AND ATPB-RBCL SPACER REGIONS, AND TRNL-TRNF NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE DATA, USING MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND PARSIMONY IN INDIVIDUAL AND VARIOUSLY COMBINED DATA SETS COMPRISING UP TO 3955 CHARACTERS AND 135 TERMINALS. PIVOTAL RESULTS. CHALYBEA AND HUILAEA WERE RECOVERED AS A CLADE SISTER TO THE CLADE OF BLAKEA AND TOPOBEA. NEITHER OF THE LATTER TWO GENERA WAS RESOLVED AS BEING MONOPHYLETIC IN ANY ANALYSIS, NOR DOES ANTHER MORPHOLOGY SUPPORT THEIR SEPARATION.

EVIDENCE FROM TRANSCRIPTOMIC, METABOLOMIC AND LIPIDOMIC STUDIES POINTS TO A SYSTEM-WIDE LOSS OF HOMEOSTASIS AT LOW TEMPERATURE THAT CAN BE COUNTERBALANCED BY REPAIR MECHANISMS UNDER FTR. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF FTR, HERE WE DISCUSS HOW MANY AREAS STILL LACK CLARITY, SUCH AS THE PRECISE ROLE(S) OF HEAT SHOCK PROTEINS, COMPATIBLE SOLUTES OR THE IDENTIFICATION OF REGULATORS AND KEY PLAYERS INVOLVED IN THE OBSERVED HOMEOSTATIC RESPONSES. FTR CAN BE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL IN APPLIED SETTINGS, SUCH AS FOR MODEL INSECTS USED IN RESEARCH, INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT AND POLLINATION SERVICES. WE ALSO EXPLAIN HOW THE APPLICATION OF FTR TECHNIQUES IN LARGE-SCALE FACILITIES MAY REQUIRE OVERCOMING SOME LOGISTICAL AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS. FTR DEFINITIVELY ENHANCES SURVIVAL AT LOW TEMPERATURE IN INSECTS, BUT BEFORE IT CAN BE WIDELY USED, WE SUGGEST THAT THE POSSIBLE FITNESS AND ENERGY COSTS OF FTR MUST BE EXPLORED MORE THOROUGHLY. ALTHOUGH FTR IS NOT ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT, SIMILAR PROCESSES MAY OPERATE IN SETTINGS WHERE TEMPERATURES FLUCTUATE NATURALLY.",COLD STORAGE; PHYSIOLOGICAL REPAIR; FLUCTUATING TEMPERATURE; RECOVERY,ROTUNDATA HYMENOPTERA-MEGACHILIDAE; ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE; APHIDIUS-COLEMANI HYMENOPTERA; HIGH-TEMPERATURE PULSE; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; SOLITARY BEE; ALPHITOBIUS-DIAPERINUS; PARASITIC WASP; PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES; UP-REGULATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"COLINET, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV RENNES, CNRS, ECOBIO UMR 6553, 263 AVE GEN LECLERC, F-35042 RENNES, FRANCE.;COLINET, HERVE, UNIV RENNES, CNRS, ECOBIO UMR 6553, 263 AVE GEN LECLERC, F-35042 RENNES, FRANCE.;RINEHART, JOSEPH P., YOCUM, GEORGE D., USDA ARS, RED RIVER VALLEY AGR RES CTR, BIOSCI RES LAB, 1605 ALBRECHT BLVD, FARGO, ND 58102 USA.;GREENLEE, KENDRA J., NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, POB 6050,DEPT 2715, FARGO, ND 58108 USA.",10.1242/JEB.164806,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",NA,SUZUKILL PROJECT (AGENCE NATIONALE DE LA RECHERCHE) [ANR-15-CE21-0017-01]; SUZUKILL PROJECT (AUSTRIAN SCIENCE FUND) [FWF-I2604-B25],THIS REVIEW WAS SUPPORTED BY SUZUKILL PROJECT (AGENCE NATIONALE DE LA RECHERCHE: ANR-15-CE21-0017-01 AND AUSTRIAN SCIENCE FUND: FWF-I2604-B25).,0022-0949,14,NA,COMPANY BIOLOGISTS LTD,221,2018,ISI000440579100007,99,LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS,20,BIOLOGY,HERVE.COLINETUNIV-RENNES1.FR,GP1MB,"COLINET, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV RENNES, CNRS, ECOBIO UMR 6553, 263 AVE GEN LECLERC, F-35042 RENNES, FRANCE",ISI,none,UNIV RENNES;RED RIVER VALLEY AGR RES CTR;NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIV,UNIV RENNES,NA,"COLINET H, 2018, J EXP BIOL","COLINET H, 2018, J EXP BIOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jon Koch

INFORM.,"DATA SOURCES ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND RANGE ARE TYPICALLY EXPENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING TO BUILD, AND TRADITIONAL SURVEY TECHNIQUES OFTEN HAVE SPATIAL, TEMPORAL, OR SCALE-RELATED GAPS. SOCIAL NETWORK SITES, ON THE OTHER HAND, CAN PROVIDE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF COST EFFECTIVE DATA THAT MAY POTENTIALLY YIELD INFORMATION OF DIRECT BENEFIT TO SUPPLEMENT AND UNDERSTAND ECOLOGICAL PHENOMENA. PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXPLORED USING SOCIAL NETWORK SITE CONTENT TO ENHANCE INFORMATION COLLECTED BY EXPERTS OR PROFESSIONAL SURVEYS IN DOMAINS INCLUDING SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND LAND COVER. HOWEVER, THE DATA QUALITY AND GENERAL SUITABILITY OF SOCIAL NETWORK SITES DATA FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS RELATED TO SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND RANGE IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND THIS ASPECT OF ITS VALUE TO SCIENCE REMAINS UNDEREXPLORED. IN THIS RESEARCH WE INVESTIGATE SOME CAUSES OF SOCIAL NETWORK SITE DATA UNRELIABILITY AND EXPLORE HOW TO MITIGATE THEM. WE FILTER DATA POINTS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF RELIABILITY AND RELEVANCE. WE THEN USE THE FILTERED DATA TO INFER SPECIES RANGES AND DISTRIBUTIONS IN CONCERT WITH GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY INFORMATION FACILITY (GBIF) DATA. OUR PROPOSED METHODOLOGY WAS APPLIED TO FOUR AUSTRALIAN CASE STUDIES INCLUDING TWO INSECT POLLINATORS, AND TWO FLOWERING PLANTS. THE CASE STUDIES WERE CHOSEN FROM AUSTRALIA BECAUSE OF ITS UNIQUE GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES, LARGE LANDMASS, SPARSE POPULATION, AND THE MANY TOURISTS AND RESIDENTS WHO TRAVEL ACROSS IT TAKING PHOTOS AND SHARING THEM THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. WE SHOW THAT, DESPITE SOME BARRIERS, THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE SOCIAL NETWORK SITE DATA CLEARLY COMPLEMENT THE EXISTING SOURCE, MAKING OUR TECHNIQUE A VALUABLE MEANS OF MAKING REPEATABLE, EFFICIENT ADDITIONS TO TRADITIONAL SPECIES DISTRIBUTION DATA.

IN THE FOUR STUDIED SITES, A TOTAL OF 185 ARTIFICIAL NESTS WERE OFFERED MONTHLY AND 34 OF THEM WERE OCCUPIED BY BEES. SIX SPECIES OF BEES, DISTRIBUTED IN FIVE GENERA (CENTRIS, MESOCHEIRA, EUGLOSSA, MEGACHILE AND COELIOXYS) OCCUPIED THE 34 TRAP-NESTS, BUT OF THIS TOTAL NESTS, 24 PRESENTED EMERGENCE OF INDIVIDUALS. IN THE REST OF THE NESTS THERE WAS MORTALITY OF THE OCCUPANTS. CONSIDERING THE TOTAL OF NESTS WITH EMERGENCE, IT WAS OBTAINED 139 INDIVIDUALS: 131 BEES (28 KLEPTOPARASITE BEES) AND 8 COLEOPTERANS. IN 34 BEE NESTS OBTAINED, THERE WERE CONSTRUCTED 162 BROOD CELLS, THE NUMBER OF CELLS PER TRAP-NEST VARIED FROM 1 TO 13 BROOD CELLS AND THE LENGTH OF THESE NESTS VARIED FROM 2.4 TO 14CM.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS THE ARCHETYPICAL DOUBLE SIGMOID-SHAPED GROWTH CURVE OF THE SWEET CHERRY DRUPE (PRUNUS AVIUM) DOES NOT ADDRESS CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT FROM ECO-DORMANCY TO ANTHESIS AND HAS NOT BEEN CORRELATED TO REPRODUCTIVE BUD DEVELOPMENT. ACCURATE REPRESENTATION OF THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF POST-ANTHESIS OVARIES IS CONFOUNDED BY ANTHESIS TIMING, FRUITING-DENSITY AND THE PRESENCE OF UNFERTILIZED AND DEFECTIVE OVARIES WHOSE GROWTH DIFFERS FROM THOSE THAT PERSIST TO MATURATION. THESE FACTORS WERE ADDRESSED TO ASSESS PRE-ANTHESIS AND FULL-SEASON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THREE SWEET CHERRY CULTIVARS, `CHELAN', `BING' AND `SWEETHEART', DIFFERING PRIMARILY IN SEASONAL DURATION AND FRUIT SIZE. METHODS VOLUME WAS CALCULATED FROM PHOTOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE BUDS, OVARIES AND PITS AT ALL PHASES OF DEVELOPMENT. A POPULATION OF UNFERTILIZED OVARIES WAS PRODUCED USING BEE-EXCLUSION NETTING TO ENABLE A STATISTICAL COMPARISON WITH AN OPEN POLLINATED POPULATION TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN SIZE AND SHAPE BETWEEN SUCCESSFUL AND FAILING FRUIT GROWTH. ANTHESIS TIMING AND FRUITING-DENSITY WERE MANIPULATED BY FLORAL EXTINCTION AT THE SPUR AND WHOLE-TREE SCALES. DEVELOPMENTAL TIME INDICES WERE ANALYSED USING POLYNOMIAL CURVE FITTING OF LOG-TRANSFORMED DATA SUPPORTED BY RICHARDS AND LOGISTIC FUNCTIONS OF ASYMPTOTIC GROWTH OF THE PIT AND MATURING FRUIT, RESPECTIVELY. KEY RESULTS PRE-ANTHESISGROWTH BEGAN AT THE COMPLETION OF ECO-DORMANCY. A SLIGHT DECLINE IN RELATIVE GROWTH RATE (RGR) WAS OBSERVED DURING BUD SCALE SEPARATION APPROX. -16 D FROM ANTHESIS (DFA) BEFORE RESUMPTION OF EXPONENTIAL GROWTH TO A MAXIMUM ABOUT 14 DFA. AFTER ANTHESIS, REDUCED GROWTH OF UNFERTILIZED OR DEFECTIVE OVARIES WAS PARTLY DISCRIMINATED FROM SUCCESSFUL FRUIT AT 5 DFA AND COMPLETELY AT 25 DFA. TIME INDICES OF RGR INFLECTIONS WERE SIMILAR AMONG CULTIVARS WHEN ADJUSTED FOR ANTHESIS DATE ALONE, UNTIL THE END OF PIT GROWTH. ASYMPTOTIC GROWTH OF THE PIT UNDERPINNED THE DECLINING GROWTH RATE OF FRUIT AT THE END OF THE FIRST EXPONENTIAL GROWTH PHASE. DURATION OF THE SUBSEQUENT EXPANSIVE GROWTH PHASE ACCOUNTED FOR GENOTYPIC DIFFERENCES IN SEASONAL DURATION AND FINAL SIZE. PIT SIZE AND FINAL FRUIT SIZE WERE INVERSELY RELATED TO FRUITING-DENSITY.

BUT THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT, SIZE AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FLOWER FIELDS REMAIN UNCLEAR. WE STUDIED FIVE POLLINATOR GROUPS (HONEY BEES, BUMBLE BEES, OTHER WILD BEES, HOVER FLIES AND OTHER FLIES) IN THREE TYPES OF AES FLOWER FIELDS DIFFERING IN AGE, SIZE, AND LOCAL MANAGEMENT ALONG A SNH GRADIENT. WE USED CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS AS CONTROL SITES. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED DISTANCE DECAY FUNCTIONS OF FLOWER VISITATION RATES IN ADJACENT OILSEED RAPE (OSR) FIELDS. YOUNG FLOWER FIELDS IN THE FIRST YEAR AFTER ESTABLISHMENT CHARACTERISED WITH HIGH FLOWER COVER WERE VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR POLLINATORS, HOWEVER POLLINATORS TENDED TO REMAIN IN THESE FIELDS WHEN THEY WERE LARGE (> 1.5 HA). HIGH AMOUNTS OF SNH IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE ENHANCED THE VALUE OF SMALL FLOWER FIELDS AS STARTING POINTS FOR POLLINATORS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT MOVEMENT INTO CROPS. DISTANCE DECAY OF POLLINATORS WAS REDUCED IN THE PRESENCE OF HIGH AMOUNTS OF SNH IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING SMALLER SOWN FLOWER FIELDS IN LANDSCAPES WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF SNH AND LARGER FLOWER FIELDS IN LANDSCAPES WITH LOW AMOUNTS OF SNH.

ECOL.,"CHANGES IN FLOWER-VISITING INSECT POPULATIONS OR COMMUNITIES THAT RESULT FROM HUMAN IMPACTS CAN BE DOCUMENTED BY MEASURING SPATIAL OR TEMPORAL TRENDS, OR BY COMPARING ABUNDANCE OR SPECIES COMPOSITION BEFORE AND AFTER DISTURBANCE. THE LEVEL OF NATURALLY OCCURRING VARIATION IN POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OVER SPACE AND TIME WILL DICTATE THE SAMPLING EFFORT REQUIRED TO DETECT HUMAN-INDUCED CHANGES. WE COMPILED A SET OF EXISTING SURVEYS OF THE BEE FAUNAS OF NATURAL COMMUNITIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO EXAMINE PATTERNS OF ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. WE FOCUSED ON A SUBSET OF THESE STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE VARIATION IN BEE COMMUNITIES AMONG DIFFERENT SITES AND WITHIN SITES OVER DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. WE USED EXAMPLES FROM OUR COMPILATION AND OTHER PUBLISHED STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE SAMPLING APPROACHES THAT MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF FUTURE SAMPLING EFFORTS. EXISTING STUDIES SUGGEST THAT BEE FAUNAS ARE LOCALLY DIVERSE, HIGHLY VARIABLE IN SPACE AND TIME, AND OFTEN RICH IN RARE SPECIES. ALL OF THESE ATTRIBUTES INDICATE THAT INTENSE SAMPLING AMONG SITES AND YEARS WILL BE REQUIRED TO DIFFERENTIATE CHANGES DUE TO SPECIFIC IMPACTS FROM THE NATURAL DYNAMICS OF POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. GIVEN THE LIMITS ON TIME AND FUNDING FOR STUDYING BEES, APPROACHES THAT MAXIMIZE INFORMATION FOR EFFORT MUST BE SOUGHT FOR FUTURE STUDIES.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"COFFEE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TROPICAL CROPS ON EARTH, CONSIDERING BOTH ITS GROSS PRODUCTION VALUE AND THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT DEPEND ON IT FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS. COFFEE ALSO GROWS WITHIN SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST BIODIVERSE HABITATS, IN AREAS PREDICTED TO EXPERIENCE SEVERE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. LIKE MANY OTHER CROPS, COFFEE BENEFITS FROM SEVERAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES (ES) THAT PROVIDE IMPORTANT INPUTS OR CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION. GIVEN COFFEE'S STRONG INTERACTIONS WITH CONSERVATION, LIVELIHOODS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLES OF BIODIVERSITY-REGULATED ES TO COFFEE AND HOW THEY ARE LIKELY TO CHANGE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATES. HERE WE REVIEW THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON THE PROVISION OF TWO ESSENTIAL AND INTERACTING ES THAT REGULATE COFFEE PRODUCTION: CONTROL OF A BEETLE PEST BY BIRDS AND POLLINATION BY BEES. STUDIES SHOW THAT BIRD AND BEE COMMUNITIES PROVIDE PEST CONTROL AND POLLINATION SERVICES THAT IMPROVE COFFEE QUANTITY AND QUALITY, BENEFITING COFFEE FARMERS WHOSE LIVELIHOODS DEPEND ON THIS CROP. THE LITERATURE ALSO SHOWS THAT A VARIETY OF PLOT, FARM, AND LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT RESOURCES FOR BEES AND BIRDS CAN ENHANCE THESE ES. WE ALSO EVALUATE HOW THESE ES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS MAY CHANGE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ESTIMATED LIKELY CLIMATE IMPACTS ON COFFEE PER SE, BUT FEW HAVE INVESTIGATED CLIMATE VULNERABILITY OF POLLINATION AND PEST CONTROL ES. EVEN LESS STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE ES. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE IS INCOMPLETE, MANAGING COFFEE FARMS AS DIVERSIFIED AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS COULD IMPROVE CLIMATE RESILIENCE OF COFFEE CROPPING AND COMMUNITIES OF BIRDS AND BEES, AND THEREFORE HELP FARMING FAMILIES ADAPT TO THEIR CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. BASED ON OUR REVIEW, WE IDENTIFY SIX CRITICAL RESEARCH PRIORITIES IN THIS ACTIVE AREA OF STUDY.

SEASONAL ADAPTATIONS ENABLING THE BRIDGING OF PERIODIC CHALLENGING ABIOTIC CONDITIONS ARE TAXONOMICALLY WIDESPREAD. HOWEVER, SENSITIVITY TO OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES CAN BE HEIGHTENED DURING THESE PERIODS. 2. SEVERAL TEMPERATE INSECTS WITH OVER-WINTERING STRATEGIES PLAY KEY ECOSYSTEM AND ECONOMIC ROLES, INCLUDING WILD BEE POLLINATORS. FOR EXAMPLE, HIBERNATION SURVIVAL IN TEMPERATE BUMBLEBEES IS CRUCIAL, AS ONLY NEW QUEENS OF FUTURE SOCIAL COLONIES OVER-WINTER. THESE BEES ARE ALSO FACED WITH OTHER ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC STRESSORS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN LINKED TO RECENT POLLINATOR DECLINES, SUCH AS EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AND PARASITES. 3. USING A FULLY CROSSED EXPERIMENT, THE INFLUENCE OF DIETARY EXPOSURE TO NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES (THIAMETHOXAM AND CLOTHIANIDIN) AND/OR THE PREVALENT BUMBLEBEE PARASITE CRITHIDIA BOMBI ON HIBERNATION SURVIVAL AND HIBERNATION WEIGHT CHANGE OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS BUMBLEBEE QUEENS WAS INVESTIGATED. 4. BOTH NEONICOTINOID AND C. BOMBI EXPOSURES REDUCED HIBERNATION SUCCESS INDIVIDUALLY, BUT NO ADDITIVE OR SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS BETWEEN THE STRESSORS WERE FOUND. FURTHER, EFFECTS WERE ASYNCHRONOUS, WITH EARLY NEONICOTINOID EFFECTS ON HIBERNATION MORTALITY OVERRIDING LATER PARASITE EFFECTS UNDER COMBINED EXPOSURES. NEONICOTINOID EXPOSURE ALSO INCREASED HIBERNATION WEIGHT LOSS OF SURVIVING QUEENS. 5. DIAPAUSE PERIODS, EMPLOYED BY NUMEROUS TEMPERATE ORGANISMS, ARE LIKELY TO BE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSES, BESIDES THE SEASONAL CHALLENGE FOR WHICH THESE PERIODS ARE AN ADAPTATION. THUS, DIAPAUSE REQUIRES INCLUSION DURING THE CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPACTS OF SUCH STRESSES. ACCORDINGLY, IT IS DEMONSTRATED HERE THAT NATURALLY RELEVANT EXPOSURES OF PESTICIDES AND PARASITES HAVE IMPORTANT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON BUMBLEBEES DURING A CRITICAL HIBERNATION PERIOD, WITH POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR POPULATIONS OF THESE KEY WILD POLLINATORS.",DIAPAUSE; HYMENOPTERA; MULTIPLE STRESSES; POLLINATOR HEALTH; TRYPANOSOME; VIRULENCE,PESTICIDE EXPOSURE; CRITHIDIA-BOMBI; HOST; BEES; VIRULENCE; TRENDS; FIELD; EVOLUTIONARY; INSECTICIDES; REPRODUCTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"SADD, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), ILLINOIS STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, CAMPUS BOX 4120, NORMAL, IL 61790 USA.;FAUSER, ALINE, NEUMANN, PETER, UNIV BERN, VETSUISSE FAC, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;FAUSER, ALINE, NEUMANN, PETER, UNIV BERN, FAC MED, INST BEE HLTH, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;FAUSER, ALINE, SANDROCK, CHRISTOPH, NEUMANN, PETER, AGROSCOPE, SWISS BEE RES CTR, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;SADD, BEN M., ILLINOIS STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, CAMPUS BOX 4120, NORMAL, IL 61790 USA.;FAUSER, ALINE, SMITHERS VISCIENT, 108 WOODFIELD DR, HARROGATE HG14LS, ENGLAND.;SANDROCK, CHRISTOPH, FIBL, DEPT LIVESTOCK SCI, ACKERSTR 113, CH-5070 FRICK, SWITZERLAND.",10.1111/EEN.12385,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,EUROPEAN UNIONEUROPEAN UNION (EU) [244090 (CP-FP) STEP]; RICOLA FOUNDATION-NATURE AND CULTURE,"RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY EUROPEAN UNION FRAMEWORK 7 [GRANT AGREEMENT NO. 244090 (CP-FP) STEP (STATUS AND TRENDS IN EUROPEAN POLLINATORS)], AND BY THE RICOLA FOUNDATION-NATURE AND CULTURE, BOTH GRANTED TO PN.

WE INVESTIGATED HOW FIRE AFFECTS RESOURCE STRUCTURE AND HOW THAT VARIATION INFLUENCES FLORAL POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES BY COMPARING BURN VERSUS CONTROL TREATMENTS IN A SOUTHEASTERN USA OLD-FIELD SYSTEM.

WHEN THE DENSITY OF V.

THE SHORT-TUBED P. TSEKOUENSIS AND P. ROYLEI WERE FOUND EXCLUSIVELY BY BOMBUS FRISEANUS WORKERS STANDING ON THE LOWER LIPS OF THE COROLLA AND VIBRATING POLLEN FROM ANTHERS CONCEALED WITHIN THE GALEA. THE POLLEN DEPOSITED ON THE DORSAL SIDE OF THE HEAD-THORAX OF THE WORKERS WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE STIGMA OF ANOTHER PLANT BY THE INSECTS NOTOTRIBICALLY. THE LONG-TUBED SPECIES WERE POLLINATED BY BOMUS RUFOFASCIATUS WORKERS HANGING INVERTED FROM THE COROLLA AND BUZZING POLLEN, THE STIGMA CONTACTED POLLEN ON THE VENTRAL SIDE OF THE POLLINATOR'S THORAX.

IN BOTH CASES, POLLEN LIMITATION (A DECREASE IN THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMPATIBLE REPRODUCTIVE POLLEN) CAN OCCUR, DRIVING THE PLANT MATING SYSTEM TO AUTOGAMY AS A MECHANISM OF REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE. WE ASSESSED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES AND MATING SYSTEMS IN A GROUP OF SYMPATRIC CONGENERIC PLANTS. WE ATTEMPTED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (I) HOW SIMILAR ARE POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES AMONG SYMPATRIC CACTUS SPECIES? (II) WHICH MATING SYSTEMS DO SYMPATRIC CACTUS SPECIES USE? METHODS: WE STUDIED SYMPATRIC ERIOSYCE TAXA THAT INHABIT A THREATENED COASTAL STRIP IN A MEDITERRANEAN-TYPE ECOSYSTEM IN CENTRAL CHILE. WE PERFORMED FIELD OBSERVATIONS ON FOUR TAXA AND CHARACTERIZED POLLINATORS DURING THE YEARS 2016 AND 2017. WE ESTIMATED DIFFERENCES IN THE POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES USING THE BRAY-CURTIS INDEX. TO ELUCIDATE THE MATING SYSTEMS, WE CONDUCTED HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS USING THREE TREATMENTS: MANUAL CROSS-POLLINATION, AUTOMATIC SELF-POLLINATION, AND CONTROL (UNMANIPULATED INDIVIDUALS). WE TESTED DIFFERENCES IN SEED PRODUCTION FOR STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE USING KRUSKAL-WALLIS ANALYSIS. RESULTS: ERIOSYCE SUBGIBBOSA SHOWED A DISTINCTIVE POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE AMONG THE SYMPATRIC SPECIES THAT WE STUDIED (SIMILARITY RANGED FROM 0\% TO 8\%), IT WAS VISITED BY SMALL BEES AND WAS THE ONLY SPECIES THAT WAS VISITED BY THE GIANT HUMMINGBIRD PATAGONA GIGAS. POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN E. CHILENSIS (YEAR 2016=4 SPECIES, 2017=8) AND E. CHILENSIS VAR. ALBIDIFLORA (2016=7, 2017=4), HOWEVER, THOSE OF E. CURVISPINA VAR. MUTABILIS (2016=7, 2017=6) WERE LESS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SPECIES. E. CURVISPINA VAR. MUTABILIS SHOWED THE HIGHEST INTERANNUAL VARIATION IN ITS POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE (18\% SIMILARITY). REPRODUCTION IN E. SUBGIBBOSA LARGELY DEPENDS ON POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH IT SHOWED SOME DEGREE OF AUTOGAMY. AUTONOMOUS POLLINATION WAS UNFEASIBLE IN E. CHILENSIS, WHICH DEPENDED ON FLOWER VISITORS FOR ITS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. BOTH E. CHILENSIS VAR. ALBIDIFLORA AND E. CURVISPINA VAR. MUTABILIS SHOWED SOME DEGREE OF AUTOGAMY. DISCUSSION: WE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES BETWEEN E. SUBGIBBOSA AND THE REMAINING ERIOSYCE TAXA, WHICH DEPEND ON HYMENOPTERANS FOR POLLEN TRANSFER. POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES SHOWED CONSIDERABLE INTERANNUAL VARIATION, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF E. SUBGIBBOSA (ORNITHOPHILOUS SYNDROME) AND E. CURVISPINA VAR. MUTABILIS (MELITOPHILOUS SYNDROME). AUTOGAMOUS REPRODUCTION IN THESE TAXA MAY ACT AS A REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE MECHANISM WHEN POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY IS UNPREDICTABLE.

ALTHOUGH SUCH SELECTION TRADE-OFFS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED SELECTION MEDIATED BY POLLINATORS AND SEED PREDATORS ACROSS A GEOGRAPHIC MOSAIC OF ENVIRONMENTS AND FLORAL VARIATION. METHODS FLORAL TRAITS WERE INVESTIGATED IN 14 POPULATIONS OF THE BUMBLE-BEE-POLLINATED HERB, PEDICULARIS REX, IN WHICH TUBULAR FLOWERS ARE SUBTENDED BY CUPULAR BRACTS HOLDING RAIN WATER. TO STUDY POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING SELECTION ON FLORAL TRAITS GENERATED BY POLLINATORS AND FLORIVORES, STIGMATIC POLLEN LOADS, INITIAL SEED SET, PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION AND FINAL VIABLE SEED PRODUCTION WERE MEASURED IN 12-14 POPULATIONS IN THE FIELD. KEY RESULTS GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL (GLM) ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE POLLEN LOAD ON STIGMAS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE EXSERTION OF THE COROLLA BEYOND THE CUPULAR BRACTS AND SIZE OF THE LOWER COROLLA LIP, BUT SO TOO WAS THE RATE OF SEED PREDATION, CREATING CONFLICTING SELECTION ON BOTH FLORAL TRAITS.

THE PAPILLATE STIGMA IS OF THE WET TYPE AND IS RECEPTIVE FROM 1100-1300H. THE STYLE IS HOLLOW THROUGHOUT ITS LENGTH. NECTAR AND POLLEN ARE THE MAJOR FLORAL REWARDS FOR POLLINATORS. THE MAJOR POLLINATORS ARE CERATINA SP. WHICH CARRY TEAK POLLEN ON MOST PARTS OF THEIR BODIES, ESPECIALLY THE SPECIALIZED HAIR STRUCTURES (SCOPAL BRUSHES) ON THE TIBIA. THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLLINATION PERIOD IN TERMS OF FLOWERS POLLINATED AND POLLEN PER FLOWER IS BETWEEN 0900 AND 1300H. AT 1300H THE NUMBER OF POLLEN PER FLOWER IS THE HIGHEST, RANGING FROM 1-36 (AVERAGE 7). POLLEN TUBES GROW VERY FAST. WITHIN 2 H AFTER POLLINATION 8\% OF THE POLLEN TUBES HAVE REACHED THE MICROPYLAR END OF THE OVULE AND POLLEN TUBES FIRST ENTER THE EMBRYO SAC AT 8 H. ONLY ONE TO TWO POLLEN TUBES ENTER THE MICROPYLES OF A FLOWER. ALTHOUGH 78\% OF FLOWERS WERE POLLINATED IN OPEN-POLLINATION, THE LOW FRUIT SET (3.5\%) SUGGESTS THAT THERE ARE FACTORS OTHER THAN POLLINATION LIMITING FRUIT SET.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY T. SPINIPES TO A BROCCOLI (BRASSICA OLERACEA L. VAR. ITALICA, BRASSICACEAE) GROWING ON AN ORGANIC FARM. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PLANTS (72.5 \%) PRESENTED DAMAGED INFLORESCENCES, WHILE 39\% OF ALL OF THE INFLORESCENCES SUFFERED SOME DEGREE OF INJURY. THE ACTIVITIES OF T. SPINIPES CAUSED SCARIFICATIONS ON THE STEMS OF THE INFLORESCENCES, AND THESE TYPICALLY EVOLVED TO EPIDERMAL CICATRICES UP TO 10 MM WIDE. IN SOME CASES, THE LESIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY DEEP TO CAUSE PARTIAL DESTRUCTION OF THE VASCULAR TISSUES, AND THIS LEAD TO THINNER (< 5 MM DIAMETER) FLORAL STEMS THAT MAY COLLAPSE. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT CONCERNING THE ATTACK OF BROCCOLI PLANTS BY T. SPINIPES.

INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE AND RESTORE POLLINATOR HABITAT ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR. HOWEVER, TO MOST EFFECTIVELY CONSERVE POLLINATORS, WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH HABITATS LIMIT THEIR SURVIVAL AND FITNESS AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. OUR STUDY EXAMINED PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS OF THE COMMON EASTERN BUMBLE BEE, BOMBUS IMPATIENS (CRESSON), IN FOUR COMMON LANDSCAPES FOR BEES (NATURAL, SUBURBAN, CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE, AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE). IN THE SUMMERS OF 2016 AND 2017, 64 BUMBLE BEE COLONIES PER YEAR WERE DEPLOYED ACROSS 16 SITES (4 SITES IN EACH LANDSCAPE TYPE IN EACH YEAR) AND THEIR GROWTH (WEIGHT AND BEE ABUNDANCE), FITNESS (CASTE PRODUCTION), AND SURVIVAL WERE MONITORED WEEKLY. COLONIES IN SUBURBAN SITES IN 2016, BUT NOT 2017, WERE LIGHTER, PRODUCED FEWER WORKER AND DRONE CELLS, AND EXPERIENCED QUEEN DEATH MORE QUICKLY THAN COLONIES IN NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS OF COLONIES IN NATURAL, ORGANIC AGRICULTURAL, AND CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES IN BOTH YEARS WERE SIMILAR. ADDITIONALLY, ACROSS ALL LANDSCAPE TYPES, THE PROPORTION OF DEVELOPED LAND AND IMPERVIOUS SURFACE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH COLONY PERFORMANCE IN 2016. THUS, OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES ARE SUBOPTIMAL FOR B. IMPATIENS COMPARED TO NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, AND THAT THIS EFFECT DIFFERS ACROSS YEARS, POTENTIALLY DUE TO CLIMACTIC DIFFERENCES. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCED PERFORMANCE OF BUMBLE BEE COLONIES IN SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES, ESPECIALLY REGARDING FLORAL RESOURCES AND PESTICIDE AND PATHOGEN STRESS.

VIBRATIONS GENERATED BY BEES GRASPING THE APICES OF THE COROLLA TUBES MUST BE TRANSFERRED VIA SHORT BROAD FILAMENTS TO THE ANTHERS. THE ANTHERS DO NOT HAVE PORES BUT EACH DEHISCES FROM THE APEX BY A SLIT THAT ELONGATES OVER THE TIME THE FLOWERS TAKE TO SENESCE (UP TO 10 DAYS). THIS MAY LIMIT SELF-FERTILISATION AS THE STIGMA IS RECEPTIVE AS SOON AS IT APPEARS FROM BETWEEN THE VERY SHORT COROLLA LOBES, SO LITTLE POLLEN IS RELEASED AT FIRST BUT LATER THIS WOULD INCREASE AS THE SLIT ELONGATES. VISITATION BY POLLINATORS HAS RARELY BEEN SEEN BUT SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS OF NATIVE BEES (LEIOPROCTUS AND LASIOGLOSSUM) WORKING THE FLOWERS ARE PRESENTED. THE BEES VISIT THE NECTARLESS FLOWERS OF CONOSTEPHIUM ONLY FOR POLLEN AND MUST FORAGE AT OTHER KINDS OF FLOWERS TO OBTAIN NECTAR. POLLEN TUBES OCCURRED IN THE STIGMAS OF MOST OLDER FLOWERS OF C.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS BIRD-POLLINATED (ORNIITHOPHILOUS) SALVIA SPECIES (SAGES) TRANSFER POLLEN EITHER BY MEANS OF A STAMINAL LEVER MECHANISM OR BY IMMOVABLE STAMENS. AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TWO MODES WITHIN THE GENUS IS NOT KNOWN, WE PRESENT A SURVEY OF ALL ORNITHOPHILOUS SAGES. THE MAIN FOCUS IS GIVEN TO FLORAL DIVERSITY ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONAL LEVER MORPHOLOGY. THEREBY THE HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED THAT, DUE TO A POLLINATOR SHIFT FROM BEES TO BIRDS, THE LEVER MECHANISM BECAME UNNECESSARY. METHODS TO GET A GENERAL IDEA ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF POLLEN TRANSFER MECHANISMS, 186 ORNITHOPHILOUS SALVIA SPECIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE STAMEN AND THE NEED FOR A LEVER MOVEMENT. TO TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE STAMINAL LEVERS AND THE FITTING BETWEEN FLOWERS AND BIRDS THE PROCESS OF POLLEN TRANSFER WAS EXAMINED BY POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS AND TESTED BY INSERTING MUSEUM SKINS AND METAL RODS INTO FRESH FLOWERS. KEY RESULTS THE DIVERSITY OF POLLEN TRANSFER MECHANISMS IS REPRESENTED BY EIGHT CASE STUDIES ILLUSTRATING THREE MAIN GROUPS. IN GROUP I (APPROX. 50 \%) THE STAMINAL LEVER MECHANISM IS NECESSARY TO OPEN ACCESS TO NECTAR AND TO ENABLE THE TRANSFER OF POLLEN THAT IS HIDDEN IN THE UPPER LIP. IN GROUP II (APPROX. 34 \%) POLLEN IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE AND THE LEVER MECHANISM IS REDUCED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES. IN GROUP III (APPROX. 4 \%) THE LEVER WORKS AS IN GROUP 1, BUT POLLEN IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE AS IN II. THE REMAINING APPROX. 13 \% ARE NOT CLEARLY CLASSIFIED. CONCLUSIONS IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DIVERSE MODES OF REDUCTION IS THE NECESSITY TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN NECTAR AND POLLEN, THEREBY ENSURING POLLEN DEPOSITION ON THE BIRD'S FEATHERED HEAD. THIS IS ACHIEVED SEVERAL TIMES IN PARALLEL BY COROLLA ELONGATION AND/OR EXPOSURE OF THE POLLEN-SACS.

NAT.,"ONE FLORAL CHARACTERISTIC ASSOCIATED WITH BAT POLLINATION (CHIROPTEROPHILY) IS COPIOUS POLLEN PRODUCTION, A PATTERN WE CONFIRMED IN A LOCAL COMPARISON OF HUMMINGBIRD- AND BAT-ADAPTED FLOWERS FROM A CLOUD FOREST SITE IN ECUADOR. PREVIOUS AUTHORS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WASTEFUL POLLEN TRANSFER BY BATS ACCOUNTED FOR THE PATTERN. HERE WE PROPOSE AND TEST A NEW HYPOTHESIS: BATS SELECT FOR INCREASED POLLEN PRODUCTION BECAUSE THEY CAN EFFICIENTLY TRANSFER LARGER AMOUNTS OF POLLEN, WHICH LEADS TO A MORE LINEAR MALE FITNESS GAIN CURVE FOR BAT-POLLINATED PLANTS. FLIGHT CAGE EXPERIMENTS WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS AND FLOWERS OF APHELANDRA ACANTHUS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THIS HYPOTHESIS, IN BOTH INSTANCES, THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN DELIVERED TO STIGMAS BY BIRDS IS NOT RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMOVED FROM ANTHERS ON THE PREVIOUS VISIT, WHILE THE SAME FUNCTION FOR BATS INCREASES LINEARLY.

SIGRIST MR;SAZIMA M,SIGRIST MR,POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF TWELVE SPECIES OF NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE: STIGMA MORPHOLOGY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE BREEDING SYSTEM,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS THIS STUDY ON REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY EXAMINES THE STIGMATIC MORPHOLOGY OF 12 BRAZILIAN MALPIGHIACEAE SPECIES WITH REGARD TO THEIR POLLINATION AND BREEDING SYSTEM. METHODS THE SPECIES WERE STUDIED IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF A SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST FRAGMENT. STYLE TIPS WERE PROCESSED FOR OBSERVATION BY SEM AND POLLEN-TUBE GROWTH WAS ANALYZED UNDER FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY. THE BREEDING SYSTEM WAS INVESTIGATED BY ISOLATING FLOWERS WITHIN WATERPROOF BAGS. FLORAL VISITORS WERE RECORDED THROUGH NOTES AND PHOTOGRAPHS. KEY RESULTS FLOWERS ARE YELLOW, PINK OR WHITE, PROTOGYNOUS, HERKOGAMOUS AND SOMETIMES LACK OIL GLANDS. WHILE BANISTERIOPSIS PUBIPETALA HAS FUNCTIONAL FEMALE FLOWERS (WITH INDEHISCENT ANTHERS), I I SPECIES PRESENT HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS. STIGMAS OF THESE SPECIES MAY BE TERMINAL, WITH A SLIGHTLY CONCAVE SURFACE, OR INTERNAL, CONSISTING OF A CIRCULAR CAVITY WITH A LARGE ORIFICE, AND ARE COVERED WITH A THIN, IMPERMEABLE CUTICLE THAT PREVENTS POLLEN FROM ADHERING, HYDRATING, OR GERMINATING. MALPIGHIACEAE HAVE A SPECIAL TYPE OF `WET' STIGMA, WHERE A SECRETION ACCUMULATES UNDER THE CUTICLE AND IS RELEASED BY MECHANICAL MEANS-MAINLY RUPTURE BY POLLINATORS. EVEN THOUGH SIX SPECIES SHOW A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SELF-COMPATIBILITY, FOUR OF THEM PRESENT A FORM OF LATE-ACTING SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY, AND THE INDIVIDUAL OF B. PUBIPETALA IS AGAMOSPERMOUS. SPECIES OF CENTRIS, EPICHARIS AND MONOECA BEES POLLINATE THESE FLOWERS, MAINLY COLLECTING OIL. SOME EPICHARIS AND MONOECA SPECIES COLLECTED POLLEN BY VIBRATION. PARATETRAPEDIA AND TETRAPEDIA BEES ARE POLLEN AND OIL THIEVES. CONCLUSIONS THE MALPIGUIACEAE SPECIES STUDIED ARE POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT, AS SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION IS LIMITED BY HERKOGAMY, PROTOGYNY AND THE STIGMATIC CUTICLE. BOTH THE OIL- AND POLLEN-COLLECTING BEHAVIOURS OF THE POLLINATORS FAVOUR THE RUPTURE OF THE STIGMATIC CUTICLE AND THE DEPOSITION OF POLLEN ON OR INSIDE THE STIGMAS. AS FRUIT-SET RATES IN NATURAL CONDITIONS ARE LOW, POPULATION FRAGMENTATION MAY HAVE LIMITED THE SEXUAL REPRODUCTION OF THESE SPECIES.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"THE EVOLUTION OF. ORAL ZYGOMORPHY IS AN IMPORTANT INNOVATION IN FLOWERING PLANTS AND IS THOUGHT TO ARISE PRINCIPALLY FROM SPECIALIZATION ON VARIOUS INSECT POLLINATORS. FLORAL MORPHOLOGY OF NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE IS DISTINCTIVE AND HIGHLY CONSERVED, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO SYMMETRY, AND IS THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY SELECTION BY ITS OIL-BEE POLLINATORS. WE SOUGHT TO CHARACTERIZE THE GENETIC BASIS OF. ORAL ZYGOMORPHY IN MALPIGHIACEAE BY INVESTIGATING CYCLOIDEA2-LIKE (CYC2-LIKE) GENES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR ESTABLISHING SYMMETRY IN DIVERSE CORE EUDICOTS. WE IDENTIFIED TWO COPIES OF CYC2-LIKE GENES IN MALPIGHIACEAE, WHICH RESULTED FROM A GENE DUPLICATION IN THE COMMON ANCESTOR OF THE FAMILY. A LIKELY ROLE FOR THESE LOCI IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF. ORAL ZYGOMORPHY IN MALPIGHIACEAE IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE CONSERVED PATTERN OF DORSAL GENE EXPRESSION IN TWO DISTANTLY RELATED NEOTROPICAL SPECIES, BYRSONIMA CRASSIFOLIA AND JANUSIA GUARANITICA. FURTHER EVIDENCE FOR THIS FUNCTION IS OBSERVED IN A MALPIGHIACEAE SPECIES THAT HAS MOVED TO THE PALEOTROPICS AND EXPERIENCED COINCIDENT SHIFTS IN POLLINATORS,. ORAL SYMMETRY, AND CYC2-LIKE GENE EXPRESSION. THE DORSAL EXPRESSION PATTERN OBSERVED IN MALPIGHIACEAE CONTRASTS DRAMATICALLY WITH THEIR ACTINOMORPHIC-FLOWERED RELATIVES, CENTROPLACACEAE (BHESA PANICULATA) AND ELATINACEAE (BERGIA TEXANA). IN PARTICULAR, B. TEXANA EXHIBITS A PREVIOUSLY UNDESCRIBED PATTERN OF UNIFORM CYC2 EXPRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT CYC2 EXPRESSION AMONG THE ACTINOMORPHIC ANCESTORS OF ZYGOMORPHIC LINEAGES MAY BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

THUS, OUR AIM WAS TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY OF IN VITRO PRODUCTION OF STINGLESS BEE QUEENS BY OFFERING A LARGE QUANTITY OF FOOD TO THE LARVAE. OUR METHODOLOGY CONSISTED OF DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF LARVAL FOOD NEEDED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUEENS, COLLECTING AND STORING THE LARVAL FOOD, AND FEEDING THE FOOD TO THE LARVAE IN ACRYLIC PLATES. WE FOUND THAT THE TOTAL AVERAGE AMOUNT OF LARVAL FOOD IN A WORKER BEE CELL OF E VARIA IS APPROXIMATELY 26.70 +/- 3.55 MU L. WE OBSERVED THAT AFTER THE CONSUMPTION OF EXTRA AMOUNTS OF FOOD (25, 30, 35 AND 40 MU L) THE LARVAE DIFFERENTIATE INTO QUEENS (N=98). THEREFORE, THE AVERAGE TOTAL VOLUME OF FOOD NEEDED FOR THE DIFFERENTIATION OF A YOUNG LARVA OF F. VARIA QUEEN IS APPROXIMATELY 61.70 +/- 5.00 MU L. IN OTHER WORDS, THE LARVAE DESTINED TO BECOME QUEENS EAT 2.31 TIMES MORE FOOD THAN THE ONES DESTINED TO BECOME WORKERS. WE USED THE SPECIES FRIESEOMELITTA VARIA AS A MODEL, HOWEVER THE METHODOLOGY CAN BE REPRODUCED FOR ALL SPECIES OF STINGLESS BEES WHOSE MECHANISM OF CASTE DIFFERENTIATION DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF FOOD INGESTED BY THE LARVAE.

KEASAR T;MOTRO U;SHMIDA A,KEASAR T,TEMPORAL REWARD VARIABILITY PROMOTES SAMPLING OF A NEW FLOWER TYPE BY BUMBLEBEES,ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR,ANIM. BEHAV.,"FORAGING BUMBLEBEES FOCUS MAINLY ON ONE FLOWER SPECIES (THEIR `MAJOR'), AND OCCASIONALLY VISIT OTHER FLOWERS ('MINORS') THAT ARE LESS REWARDING. MINORING ALLOWS TRACKING OF POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BECOME MORE PROFITABLE WITH TIME. THIS IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE AN ADAPTIVE BENEFIT UNDER UNSTABLE FORAGING CONDITIONS, BUT TO REDUCE FORAGING EFFICIENCY WHEN RESOURCES ARE STEADY. WE TESTED HOW PREDICTABILITY OF FOOD SOURCES AFFECTS MINORING AND FORAGING SUCCESS, USING BOMBUS TERRESTRIS WORKERS THAT FED ON SUCROSE SOLUTION IN ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS. BEES EXPOSED TO THREE COLOUR-DISTINCT FLOWER TYPES WITH FLUCTUATING FOOD REWARDS PERFORMED MORE MINORING (VISITS TO A FOURTH, NONREWARDING FLOWER TYPE) THAN BEES THAT ENCOUNTERED A STABLE REWARD SCHEDULE. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS MOSTLY DUE TO A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF FLOWER TYPE SHIFTS IN THE FLUCTUATING-REWARD TREATMENT. FLOWERS OF THE HIGHEST-REWARDING TYPE WERE VISITED LESS FREQUENTLY IN THE FLUCTUATING-REWARD THAN IN THE STABLE-REWARD TREATMENT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE FLUCTUATING-REWARD SCHEDULE LIMITED THE BEES' ABILITY TO TRACK THE MOST PROFITABLE FLOWER TYPE. INTERVALS BETWEEN SUCCESSIVE VISITS WERE LONGER IN THE FLUCTUATING-REWARD THAN IN THE STABLE-REWARD TREATMENT, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE FLUCTUATING SCHEDULE REQUIRED TIME-CONSUMING NEURAL PROCESSING. AS EXPECTED, THE NUMBER OF MINORING VISITS CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH THE NUMBER OF COLOUR SHIFTS AND WITH FORAGING SUCCESS IN THE STABLE-REWARD TREATMENT. IN THE FLUCTUATING-REWARD TREATMENT, ON THE OTHER HAND, SUCROSE INTAKE RATES WERE INDEPENDENT OF MINORING AND COLOUR SHIFT FREQUENCIES. WE SUGGEST THAT NOVELTY SEEKING BY FORAGERS CAN EVOLVE WHEN FOOD SOURCES OFFER FLUCTUATING REWARDS, WHICH REDUCE FORAGING SUCCESS BUT ALSO THE COST OF EXPLORING NEW RESOURCES.

APPL.,"HUMAN ACTIVITY CAUSES ABRUPT CHANGES IN RESOURCE AVAILABILITY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE. IN ORDER TO PERSIST IN HUMAN-ALTERED LANDSCAPES ORGANISMS NEED TO SHIFT THEIR HABITAT USE ACCORDINGLY. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH WHOLE COMMUNITIES PERSIST IN HUMAN-ALTERED LANDSCAPES, INCLUDING THE ROLE OF COMPLEMENTARY HABITAT USE. WE DEFINE COMPLEMENTARY HABITAT USE AS THE USE OF DIFFERENT HABITATS AT DIFFERENT TIMES BY THE SAME GROUP OF SPECIES DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ACTIVITY PERIOD. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT COMPLEMENTARY HABITAT USE IS A MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH NATIVE BEE SPECIES PERSIST IN HUMAN-ALTERED LANDSCAPES. TO TEST THIS IDEA, WE STUDIED WILD BEE COMMUNITIES IN AGRO-NATURAL LANDSCAPES AND EXPLORED THEIR COMMUNITY-LEVEL PATTERNS OF HABITAT AND RESOURCE USE OVER SPACE AND TIME. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN SIX AGRO-NATURAL LANDSCAPES IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES, EACH CONTAINING THREE MAIN BEE HABITAT TYPES (NATURAL HABITAT, AGRICULTURAL FIELDS, AND OLD FIELDS). EACH OF THE THREE HABITATS EXHIBITED A UNIQUE SEASONAL PATTERN IN AMOUNT, DIVERSITY, AND COMPOSITION OF FLORAL RESOURCES, AND TOGETHER THEY CREATED PHENOLOGICAL COMPLEMENTARITY IN FORAGING RESOURCES FOR BEES. INDIVIDUAL BEE SPECIES AS WELL AS THE BEE COMMUNITY RESPONDED TO THESE SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS IN FLORAL AVAILABILITY AND EXHIBITED A PARALLEL PATTERN OF COMPLEMENTARY HABITAT USE. THE MAJORITY OF WILD BEE SPECIES, INCLUDING ALL THE MAIN CROP VISITORS, USED FALLOW AREAS WITHIN CROPS EARLY IN THE SEASON, SHIFTED TO CROPS IN MID-SEASON, AND USED OLD-FIELD HABITATS LATER IN THE SEASON. THE NATURAL-FOREST HABITAT SUPPORTED VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF BEES, MOSTLY VISITORS OF NON-CROP PLANTS. OLD FIELDS ARE THUS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE IN THESE ARABLE LANDSCAPES FOR MAINTAINING CROP POLLINATION SERVICES.

HABITAT REQUIREMENTS OF SOLITARY BEES INCLUDE NESTING SITES, FOOD RESOURCES AND NESTING MATERIAL. WE USED TRANSLOCATION EXPERIMENTS TO ESTABLISH FORAGING DISTANCES AND MEASURED FORAGING TRIP DURATION TO ANALYSE HOW SOLITARY BEES COPE WITH THE DISTANCE BETWEEN NESTING SITES AND SUITABLE FOOD PLANTS IN DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES. 2. MAXIMUM FORAGING DISTANCE BETWEEN NESTING SITE AND FOOD PATCH WAS 150-600 M FOR THE 16 BEE SPECIES EXAMINED. FORAGING DISTANCE WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH BODY LENGTH. MEAN FORAGING TRIP DURATION, MEASURED FOR SEVEN BEE SPECIES, RANGED FROM 6 TO 28 MIN AND WAS ALSO CORRELATED WITH BODY LENGTH. IN A STUDY OF THE POLYLECTIC SPECIES OSMIA RUFA, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FORAGING TRIP DURATION WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES. LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS SHOWED THAT THE OLIGOLECTIC MEGACHILE LAPPONICA NESTED IN TRAP NESTS WITH A PROBABILITY OF 50\% IF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TRAP NEST AND FOOD PATCH WAS LESS THAN 250 M. THE OLIGOLECTIC CHELOSTOMA RAPUNCULI UTILIZED TRAP NESTS WHEN THE DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FOOD PATCH WAS LESS THAN 300 M. 3. THESE EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT SOLITARY BEES HAVE A RATHER SMALL FORAGING RANGE SO LOCAL HABITAT STRUCTURE APPEARS TO BE OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN LARGE-SCALE LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. ALL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUSTAINING VIABLE POPULATIONS MUST BE WITHIN THIS RANGE.

MAHORO S,MAHORO S,EFFECTS OF FLOWER AND SEED PREDATORS AND POLLINATORS ON FRUIT PRODUCTION IN TWO SEQUENTIALLY FLOWERING CONGENERS,PLANT ECOLOGY,PLANT ECOL.,"ENTOMOPHILOUS SPECIES THAT BLOOM IN EARLY SPRING ARE MORE FREQUENTLY CONFRONTED WITH SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LOW FRUIT SET THAN SPECIES THAT BLOOM LATER. ON THE OTHER HAND, EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES MAY BENEFIT BY ESCAPING THE PEAK OF FLOWER AND/OR SEED PREDATOR ACTIVITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE IMPLICATED UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE INACTIVITY OF POLLINATOR AND PREDATOR INSECTS EARLY IN SPRING AS CAUSES OF SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LIGHT PREDATION IN EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES NOT ONLY IN FLOWERING SCHEDULE, BUT ALSO IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS AND BREEDING SYSTEMS, COULD INDUCE VARIATIONS IN FRUIT SET AND INTENSITY OF PREDATION AMONG SPECIES. COMPARING TWO SPECIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVING INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS WITHIN SPECIES COULD HELP DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THESE INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES. FOR FOUR YEARS, I FOLLOWED THE FATE OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS, FROM BUD TO FRUIT, IN TWO VACCINIUM SPECIES THAT BLOOM SUCCESSIVELY IN SPRING AND SHARE POLLINATORS AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS. MY PREDICTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES, V. HIRTUM, WOULD NOT EASILY GAIN POLLINATOR SERVICES BECAUSE OF LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, AND ITS FRUIT SET WOULD BE LOW IN COMPARISON WITH THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES, V. SMALLII, (2) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES WOULD AVOID ATTACKS BY FLOWER AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS VIA PHENOLOGICAL ESCAPE FROM THE PREDATORS' ACTIVITY PEAK. HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED BOTH SPECIES HAD INCOMPLETE SELF-COMPATIBILITY, WITH BUMBLEBEES REQUIRED FOR POLLINATION. AS PREDICTED, ONLY THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SEEMED TO SUFFER FROM POLLEN LIMITATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS SUGGESTED THAT POLLEN LIMITATION RESULTED NOT ONLY FROM POLLINATOR LIMITATION EARLY IN SPRING, BUT ALSO FROM GEITONOGAMY AND REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES. MOTH AND FLY LARVAE CONSUMED FLOWERS AND FRUIT, WHILE THE PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATOR WAS A WEEVIL (MECYSMODERES SP.). FAR FROM ESCAPING FLOWER AND SEED PREDATION, THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SUFFERED MORE SEVERE INSECT ATTACKS THAN THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES IN TWO YEARS OUT OF FOUR.

THIS STUDY TESTED HOW FIVE LOCAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES (BARE GROUND, NATIVE BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS, HOMESTEAD GARDENS, SHELTERBELTS, AND CONTROL AREAS OF PASTURE) AFFECT LOCAL POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES ON CANTERBURY FARMS. WE ALSO COMPARED TWO SAMPLING METHODS (FLOWER VISITATION TO NATIVE POTTED PLANTS VS STICKY TRAPS) TO DETERMINE IF THE SAMPLING METHOD AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF LANDSCAPE-FEATURE COMPARISONS. WE RECORDED 928 POLLINATORS OF 17 TAXA ON THE POTTED PLANTS AND 791 POLLINATORS OF 16 TAXA ON THE STICKY TRAPS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCES BETWEEN THE LANDSCAPE FEATURES AND THE CONTROL AREAS. BOTH SAMPLING METHODS RECORDED FEWER POLLINATORS OVERALL AT SHELTERBELTS AND BARE GROUND SITES THAN CONTROL SITES, ALTHOUGH MORNING-EVENING FLY WAS MORE COMMON AT BARE GROUND SITES. HOWEVER, THE METHODS GAVE CONTRASTING RESULTS FOR BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS AND GARDENS: THE FLOWER METHOD RECORDED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLLINATORS IN BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS AND GARDENS THAN IT DID AT CONTROL SITES, WHEREAS THE STICKY TRAP METHOD RECORDED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER.

MILLER R;OWENS SJ;RORSLETT B,MILLER R,PLANTS AND COLOUR: FLOWERS AND POLLINATION,OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY,OPT. LASER TECHNOL.,"WHILE THERE IS A RANGE OF COLOURS FOUND IN PLANTS THE PREDOMINANT COLOUR IS GREEN. PIGMENTS IN PLANTS HAVE SEVERAL ROLES E.G. PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND SIGNALLING. IF COLOUR IS TO BE USED AS A SIGNAL THEN IT MUST STAND OUT FROM GREEN. HOWEVER, ONE SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THERE ARE ALSO COLOURED COMPOUNDS WHERE WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF COLOUR IN THEIR FUNCTIONS THEY MAY HAVE ROLES IN, FOR EXAMPLE, DEFENCE OR HEAT EXCHANGE. IN THIS PAPER, WE WILL DESCRIBE THE BASIC CHEMISTRY OF THE MAJOR PIGMENTS FOUND IN PLANTS AND ESPECIALLY FLORAL PIGMENTS. WE WILL THEN DISCUSS THEIR LOCATIONS IN PARTS OF THE FLOWER (SUCH AS SEPALS, PETALS, POLLEN AND NECTAR), THE CELLS IN WHICH THEY ARE FOUND AND THEIR SUB-CELLULAR LOCATIONS. FLORAL PIGMENTS HAVE A LARGE ROLE TO PLAY IN POLLINATION OF FLOWERS BY ANIMALS. THEY CAN AND ARE MODIFIED IN MANY WAYS DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FLOWERS IN NATURE, FOR EXAMPLE, AT EMERGENCE AND POST-POLLINATION. THERE ARE A RANGE OF BIOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS OF COLOUR CHANGE BOTH WITHIN FLOWERS AND IN ISOLATED PIGMENTS. SOME OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING COLOUR ARE TEMPERATURE, CO-PIGMENTS, PH, METALS, SUGARS, ANTHOCYANIN STACKING AND CELL SHAPE. THERE IS A RENEWED INTEREST IN ANALYSING FLORAL PIGMENTS AND HOW THEY ARE MODIFIED PARTLY BECAUSE OF ADVANCES IN RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGIES, BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF POLLINATORS AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE TO BIODIVERSITY AND FOR EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES. THERE IS CONTINUED STRONG INTEREST FROM THE HORTICULTURAL INDUSTRY FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COLOURS E.G. THE BLUE ROSE AND FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL DYES. FUNDING IN THIS AREA MAY IMPACT FUTURE RESEARCH IN A POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL WAY BUT IT MUST NOT DEFLECT US FROM SCIENCE-BASED CONSERVATION. CROWN COPYRIGHT (C) 2009 PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER LTD.

ENTOMOL.,"DIFFERENT RESOURCE USE STRATEGIES MANIFEST AS DIFFERENCES IN THE REALIZED NICHES OF SPECIES. NICHE SEGREGATION MAY INVOLVE SEVERAL DIMENSIONS OF THE NICHE, SUCH AS DIET, SPACE, AND TIME. WE MEASURED THE LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY AND COMPLEMENTARITY OF A BEE-PLANT INTERACTION NETWORK IN AN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. BECAUSE FLOWER RESOURCE DIVERSITY IS HIGH AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ASSOCIATED WITH FLOWERING PHENOLOGY VARIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT TROPHIC OVERLAP IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE LOW (I.E., HIGH NICHE COMPLEMENTARITY). IN CONTRAST, WE EXPECTED A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS AND EXPLOITATION COMPETITION TO CREATE HIGH TEMPORAL OVERLAP, LEADING TO HIGH REDUNDANCY IN THE TIME OF USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. DIETARY OVERLAP WAS LOW (NOIH = 0.18): NICHES OF 88\% OF SPECIES PAIRS HAD LESS THAN 30\% OVERLAP. IN CONTRAST, TEMPORAL OVERLAP WAS INTERMEDIATE (NOIH=0.49): NICHES OF 65\% OF SPECIES PAIRS HAD 30\% TO 60\% OVERLAP. NETWORK ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT BEES SEPARATED THEIR DIETARY NICHES AND HAD INTERMEDIATE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIALIZATION (H-2'AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND= 0.46). IN TERMS OF THEIR TEMPORAL NICHES (H-2'AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND= 0.12), BEES WERE GENERALISTS, WITH HIGH TEMPORAL REDUNDANCY. TEMPERATURE WAS NOT A KEY FACTOR IN THE DETERMINATION OF NICHE OVERLAP, SUGGESTING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DO NOT LIKELY HAVE A PRIMARY ROLE IN DETERMINING HIGH REDUNDANCY IN THE TEMPORAL USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. RATHER, TEMPORAL OVERLAP IS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF NECTAR PRODUCTION BY FLOWERS.

DOMINANCE DOES NOT VARY WITH INDIVIDUAL BODY SIZE, BUT RATHER WITH FORAGING GROUP SIZE. SPECIES THAT RECRUIT LARGER NUMBERS OF NESTMATES (SCAPTOTRIGONA AFF. DEPILIS, TRIGONA HYALINATA, TRIGONA SPINIPES) DOMINATED BOTH NUMERICALLY (HIGH LOCAL ABUNDANCE) AND BEHAVIORALLY (CONTROLLING FEEDERS). REMOVAL OF GROUP-FORAGING SPECIES INCREASED FEEDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOLITARY FORAGERS (FRIESEOMELITTA VARIA, MELIPONA QUADRIFASCIATA AND NANNOTRIGONA TESTACEICORNIS). TRIGONA HYALINATA ALWAYS DOMINATED UNDER UNRESTRICTED CONDITIONS. WHEN THIS SPECIES WAS REMOVED, T. SPINIPES OR S. AFF. DEPILIS CONTROLLED FEEDERS AND LIMITED VISITATION BY SOLITARY-FORAGING SPECIES.

AREAS J.,"MANY FEDERAL, STATE, AND TRIBAL AGENCIES, AS WELL AS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE RECENTLY INCREASED EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW NATURAL AREAS CAN BE MANAGED TO ENHANCE NATIVE POLLINATORS AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. HOWEVER, MANAGING THIS IMPORTANT GROUP MUST BE BALANCED WITH OTHER SERVICES THAT NATURAL AREAS PROVIDE INCLUDING HUNTING, TIMBER PRODUCTION, AND LIVESTOCK GRAZING. SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HABITATS USED BY LARGE UNGULATES (E.G., CATTLE (BOS TAURUS), ELK (CERVUS ELAPHUS), MULE DEER (ODOCOILEUS HEMIONUS)) IN WAYS THAT ALSO ENHANCE POLLINATORS. ONE KEY GAP IS UNDERSTANDING THE DEGREE TO WHICH DIETS OF MAMMALIAN HERBIVORES OVERLAP WITH FLORAL RESOURCES USED BY BEES, AND HOW THIS OVERLAP VARIES SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY. INVERTEBRATE POLLINATORS, INCLUDING BEES, RELY ON FLOWERING FORBS AND SHRUBS FOR NECTAR AND POLLEN. UNGULATES ALSO FEED ON FLOWERING PLANTS, ALTHOUGH PREFERENCES VARY BY UNGULATE SPECIES, VEGETATION COMMUNITY, AND SEASON. HERE WE REVIEW EXISTING LITERATURE ON UNGULATE DIETS RELATIVE TO FLOWERING PLANTS AND COMPARE THIS INFORMATION WITH FLOWER PREFERENCES OF BEES, DRAWING ON STUDIES OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY AT THE STARKEY EXPERIMENTAL FOREST AND RANGE IN NORTHEASTERN OREGON. OUR REVIEW CAN INFORM MANAGERS ABOUT THE POTENTIAL DIETARY OVERLAP BETWEEN UNGULATES AND NATIVE BEES AND AID PLANNING EFFORTS AIMED AT BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION OF POLLINATORS.

BALDOCK KCR;MEMMOTT J;RUIZ-GUAJARDO JC;ROZE D;STONE GN,BALDOCK KCR,DAILY TEMPORAL STRUCTURE IN AFRICAN SAVANNA FLOWER VISITATION NETWORKS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR NETWORK SAMPLING,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"ECOLOGICAL INTERACTION NETWORKS ARE A VALUABLE APPROACH TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. HIGHLY STRUCTURED DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS ARE A FEATURE OF THE BIOLOGY OF MANY FLOWER VISITORS, PARTICULARLY PROVISIONING FEMALE BEES, WHICH OFTEN VISIT DIFFERENT FLORAL SOURCES AT DIFFERENT TIMES. SUCH TEMPORAL STRUCTURE IMPLIES THAT PRESENCE/ABSENCE AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF SPECIFIC FLOWER-VISITOR INTERACTIONS (LINKS) IN INTERACTION NETWORKS MAY BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE DAILY TIMING OF DATA COLLECTION. FURTHER, RELATIVE TIMING OF INTERACTIONS IS CENTRAL TO THEIR POSSIBLE ROLE IN COMPETITION OR FACILITATION OF SEED SET AMONG COFLOWERING PLANTS SHARING POLLINATORS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO STUDY HAS EXAMINED THE NETWORK IMPACTS OF DAILY TEMPORAL VARIATION IN VISITOR ACTIVITY AT A COMMUNITY SCALE. HERE WE USE TEMPORALLY STRUCTURED SAMPLING TO EXAMINE THE CONSEQUENCES OF DAILY ACTIVITY PATTERNS UPON NETWORK PROPERTIES USING FULLY QUANTIFIED FLOWER-VISITOR INTERACTION DATA FOR A KENYAN SAVANNA HABITAT. INTERACTIONS WERE SAMPLED AT FOUR SEQUENTIAL THREE-HOUR TIME INTERVALS BETWEEN 06:00 AND 18:00, ACROSS MULTIPLE SEASONAL TIME POINTS FOR TWO SAMPLING SITES. IN ALL DATA SETS THE RICHNESS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF LINKS DEPENDED CRITICALLY ON WHEN DURING THE DAY VISITATION WAS OBSERVED. PERMUTATION-BASED NULL MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT TEMPORAL STRUCTURE ACROSS DAILY TIME INTERVALS AT THREE OF THE FOUR SEASONAL TIME POINTS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PATTERNS IN BEE ACTIVITY. THIS SENSITIVITY OF NETWORK STRUCTURE SHOWS THE NEED TO CONSIDER DAILY TIME IN NETWORK SAMPLING DESIGN, BOTH TO MAXIMIZE THE PROBABILITY OF SAMPLING LINKS RELEVANT TO PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND TO FACILITATE APPROPRIATE INTERPRETATION OF INTERSPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS. OUR DATA ALSO SUGGEST THAT DAILY STRUCTURING AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL COULD REDUCE INDIRECT COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS WHEN COFLOWERING PLANTS SHARE POLLINATORS, AS IS COMMONLY OBSERVED DURING FLOWERING IN HIGHLY SEASONAL HABITATS.",AFRICA; COMPETITION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS; FACILITATION; KENYA; MUTUALISM; POLLINATION; SAVANNA; TEMPORAL STRUCTURE; VISITATION WEBS,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BEE ANTHOPHORA-PLUMIPES; SOLITARY BEE; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; ACACIA COMMUNITY; BODY-SIZE; RESTORATION; BONFERRONI; MUTUALISMS; BEHAVIOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,32,"STONE, GN (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV EDINBURGH, INST EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, KINGS BLDG,W MAINS RD, EDINBURGH EH9 3JT, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND.;BALDOCK, KATHERINE C.

SCI.,"IN THE FACE OF GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY DECLINES DRIVEN BY AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, LOCAL DIVERSIFICATION PRACTICES ARE BROADLY PROMOTED TO SUPPORT FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY AND MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THE CREATION OF FLOWER-RICH HABITATS ON FARMLAND HAS BEEN SUBSIDIZED IN BOTH THE USA AND EU TO SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY AND PROMOTE DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. YET, THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT IN WHICH LOCAL DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES ARE IMPLEMENTED WILL INFLUENCE THEIR SUCCESS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EMPIRICALLY EVALUATED THIS THEORY OR ASSESSED THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SIMULTANEOUSLY. HERE, WE EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF CREATING FLOWER-RICH HABITATS IN FIELD MARGINS ON POLLINATION, PEST CONTROL, AND CROP YIELD OVER 3 YEARS USING A PAIRED DESIGN ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT.

APPL.,"RESOURCES (ENERGY EXPENSES) THAT CAN BE DEVOTED TO PROGENY ARE ALWAYS LIMITED. OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION THEORY PREDICTS THAT PARENTS SHOULD ALLOCATE RESOURCES TO THEIR OFFSPRING IN PORTIONS THAT MAXIMISE THEIR OWN FITNESS RETURNS PER UNIT INVESTED, NOT THE FITNESS OF THE OFFSPRING. FEMALES OF SOLITARY, NEST-CONSTRUCTING BEES CONTROL THE KEY FEATURES OF OFFSPRING FITNESS BY DETERMINING BOTH BODY SIZE AND SEX OF EACH INDIVIDUAL. THEREFORE THE SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHIC RED MASON BEE, OSMIA BICORNIS (L.) [= OSMIA RUFA (L.)] (HYMENOPTERA: MEGACHILIDAE), CONSTITUTES A SUITABLE MODEL SYSTEM TO TEST OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION THEORY. BODY SIZE RANGE WAS ANALYSED BY FOOD STOCK MANIPULATION AND HEDGED AGAINST POSSIBLE ASSOCIATED ALLOMETRIC DIVERGENCES OF FLIGHT PARAMETERS. IN HARMONY WITH THE CENTRAL PREDICTION OF THE THEORY, O.BICORNIS FEMALES ORDINARILY PROVISIONED OFFSPRING WITH FOOD THAT DID NOT ENABLE MAXIMAL BODY SIZE, BUT ENSURED SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT TO ADULTHOOD. ON AVERAGE, ONLY THREE-QUARTERS OF THE ACTUALLY REQUIRED FOOD TO GROWTH TO FULL BODY SIZE WAS SUPPLIED. ALTHOUGH FEMALES FUNDAMENTALLY BALANCED SIZE VS. NUMBER OF OFFSPRING ACCORDING TO THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION THEORY, THE VARIABILITY IN BODY SIZE WAS VERY HIGH AND THE MEAN BODY MASS OF BOTH SEXES DIFFERED IN THE FIELD BETWEEN YEARS. THESE FLUCTUATIONS IN BODY SIZE OVER SPACE AND TIME INDICATE THAT VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS ARE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN THE ACTUAL RESOURCE ASSESSMENT DECISION IN ADDITION TO THE CORE PARENTAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY. AS A PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION, THE SEX-SPECIFIC CRITICAL WEIGHT OF LARVAE TO INDUCE METAMORPHOSIS IS ORDINARILY NOT REACHED AT FIELD CONDITIONS. INSTEAD, METAMORPHOSIS IS INDUCED BY A BAIL-OUT PROCESS WHEN LARVAE RUN OUT OF THE FOOD PROVISIONED BY THEIR MOTHER.",PARENTAL INVESTMENT; MINIMUM ESSENTIAL INVESTMENT; SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM; BAIL-OUT INDUCTION OF METAMORPHOSIS; POLLINATOR; OSMIA RUFA; MEGACHILIDAE; HYMENOPTERA,RED MASON BEE; SEX-ALLOCATION; MEGACHILE APICALIS; NATURAL-SELECTION; VERTICAL FORCE; FEMALE SIZE; EGG SIZE; HYMENOPTERA; RUFA; FLIGHT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"SEIDELMANN, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), M LUTHER UNIV, DEPT ANIM PHYSIOL, INST BIOL ZOOL, HOHER WEG 8, D-06099 HALLE, SAALE, GERMANY.;SEIDELMANN, KARSTEN, M LUTHER UNIV, DEPT ANIM PHYSIOL, INST BIOL ZOOL, HOHER WEG 8, D-06099 HALLE, SAALE, GERMANY.",10.1111/EEA.12711,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,0013-8703,9,790-799,WILEY,166,2018,ISI000447802500008,57,ENTOMOLOGY,10,ENTOMOLOGY,KARSTEN.SEIDELMANNZOOLOGIE.UNI-HALLE.DE,GX5PS,"SEIDELMANN, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), M LUTHER UNIV, DEPT ANIM PHYSIOL, INST BIOL ZOOL, HOHER WEG 8, D-06099 HALLE, SAALE, GERMANY",ISI,none,M LUTHER UNIV,M LUTHER UNIV,NA,"SEIDELMANN K, 2018, ENTOMOL EXP APPL","SEIDELMANN K, 2018, ENTOMOL EXP APPL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

ALTHOUGH RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE COULD HAVE BEEN MODULATED BY MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER SPECIES, STUDIES EXPLORING THE DYNAMICS OF THESE INTERACTIONS AND THEIR ROLE FACILITATING SPECIES PERSISTENCE DURING PAST CLIMATIC VARIATIONS ARE SCARCE.

IN A TWO-YEAR FIELD TRIAL, THE OUTCROSSING FREQUENCIES AND DISTRIBUTION FROM PLOTS WITH DIFFERENT RATIOS OF TRANSGENIC PLANTS (100\%, 1.0\% AND 0.1\%) CONTAINING THE PAT-GENE FOR RESISTANCE TOWARDS THE BROAD-RANGE HERBICIDE GLUFOSINATE-AMMONIUM WERE DETERMINED IN SURROUNDING ACCEPTOR PLOTS WITHIN A DISTANCE OF 3-11 M. RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED OUTCROSSING WITH ISOLATED POLLINATION EVENTS BECAME APPARENT, AND AN AVERAGE GENE FLOW OF 0.28\%, 0.01\% AND 0.0065\% WAS DETECTED FOR 100\%, 1.0\% AND 0.1\% TRANSGENIC DONOR PLOTS, RESPECTIVELY. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUTCROSSING WERE FOUND FOR DISTANCE, BUT NOT FOR THE PREVAILING WIND DIRECTION. THE RANDOM DISTRIBUTION IN COMBINATION WITH THE BEHAVIOUR OF HONEY-BEES AND BUMBLE-BEES GIVES STRONG EVIDENCE THAT INSECTS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR SHORT DISTANCE GENE DISPERSAL. A CURVE FIT ASSUMING AN EXPONENTIAL DECLINE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL OUT CROSSING DATA AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE AND WAS APPLIED TO THE ACTUAL EU LABELLING THRESHOLD. THE CONTAMINATION LIMIT OF 0.9\% IN FOOD AND FEED COULD BE KEPT WITHOUT CULTIVATION DISTANCES TO THE TRANSGENIC SOURCE.

IN O. SPHEGODES, VISITS BY POLLINATORS ARE RARE. BECAUSE OF THIS LOW FREQUENCY OF POLLINATION, ONE WOULD EXPECT THE EVOLUTION OF STRATEGIES THAT INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT MALES WILL VISIT MORE THAN ONE FLOWER ON THE SAME PLANT, THIS WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF POLLINATION EVENTS ON A PLANT AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PRODUCED. USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS) ANALYSES, WE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN 100 COMPOUNDS IN THE ODOR BOUQUETS OF LABELLUM EXTRACTS FROM O. SPHEGODES, 24 COMPOUNDS WERE FOUND TO BE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE IN MALE OLFACTORY RECEPTORS BASED ON GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY WITH ELECTROANTENNOGRAPHIC DETECTION (GC-EAD). GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY (GC) ANALYSES OF ODORS FROM INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS SHOWED LESS INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN THE ODOR BOUQUETS OF THE BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS AS COMPARED TO NONACTIVE COMPOUNDS. THIS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A HIGHER SELECTIVE PRESSURE ON THE POLLINATOR-ATTRACTING COMMUNICATION SIGNAL. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND A CHARACTERISTIC VARIATION IN THE GC-EAD ACTIVE ESTERS AND ALDEHYDES AMONG FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT STEM POSITIONS WITHIN AN INFLORESCENCE AND IN THE N-ALKANES AND N-ALKENES AMONG PLANTS FROM DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. IN OUR BEHAVIORAL FIELD TESTS, WE SHOWED THAT MALE BEES LEARN THE ODOR BOUQUETS OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS DURING MATING ATTEMPTS AND RECOGNIZE THEM IN LATER ENCOUNTERS. BEES THEREBY AVOID TRYING TO MATE WITH FLOWERS THEY HAVE VISITED PREVIOUSLY, BUT DO NOT AVOID OTHER FLOWERS EITHER OF A DIFFERENT OR THE SAME PLANT. BY VARYING THE RELATIVE PROPORTIONS OF SATURATED ESTERS AND ALDEHYDES BETWEEN FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT STEM POSITIONS, WE DEMONSTRATED THAT A PLANT MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LEARNING ABILITIES OF THE POLLINATORS AND INFLUENCE FLOWER VISITATION BEHAVIOR. SIXTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF THE MALES THAT VISITED ONE FLOWER IN AN INFLORESCENCE RETURNED TO VISIT A SECOND FLOWER OF THE SAME INFLORESCENCE. HOWEVER, GEITONOGAMY IS PREVENTED AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF CROSS-FERTILIZATION IS ENHANCED BY THE TIME REQUIRED FOR THE POLLINIUM DEPOSITED ON THE POLLINATOR TO COMPLETE ITS BENDING MOVEMENT, WHICH IS NECESSARY FOR POLLINATION TO OCCUR. CROSS-FERTILIZATION IS FURTHERMORE ENHANCED BY THE HIGH DEGREE OF ODOR VARIATION BETWEEN PLANTS.

HOW THESE TRAITS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF PLANT SPECIES IN INTERACTION WITH POLLINATORS HAS RARELY BEEN INVESTIGATED. WE SAMPLED 870 VEGETATION PLOTS IN THE WESTERN SWISS ALPS AND CLASSIFIED THE PLANT SPECIES INTO SEVEN BLOSSOM TYPES ACCORDING TO THEIR FLORAL MORPHOLOGY (WIND, DISK, FUNNEL, TUBE, BILABIATE, HEAD OR BRUSH). WE INVESTIGATED THE ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES OF PLOTS WITH FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FD) LOWER THAN EXPECTED BY CHANCE ALONE TO DETECT POTENTIAL POLLINATION FILTERING AND RELATED THE PROPORTIONS OF THE SEVEN BLOSSOM TYPES TO A COMBINATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTORS. FROM THESE RESULTS, WE INFERRED THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THE POLLINATOR ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANT SPECIES. THE VEGETATION PLOTS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FD OF BLOSSOM TYPES THAN EXPECTED BY CHANCE WERE FOUND AT HIGHER ALTITUDES, AND THE PROPORTIONS OF BLOSSOM TYPES WERE STRONGLY PATTERNED ALONG THE SAME GRADIENT. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT A BIOTIC FILTERING EFFECT ON PLANT SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES THROUGH POLLINATION: DISK BLOSSOMS BECAME DOMINANT AT HIGHER ALTITUDES, RESULTING IN A LOWER FD. IN HARSH CONDITIONS AT HIGH ALTITUDES, POLLINATORS USUALLY DECREASE IN ACTIVITY, AND THE OPENNESS OF THE DISK BLOSSOM GRANTS ACCESS TO ANY AVAILABLE POLLINATOR. INVERSELY, BILABIATE BLOSSOMS, WHICH ARE MOSTLY POLLINATED BY BEES, WERE MORE ABUNDANT AT LOWER ELEVATIONS, WHICH ARE CHARACTERISED BY GREATER ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BEES. GENERALISATION THROUGH OPENNESS OF THE BLOSSOM COULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS AT HIGH ELEVATIONS, WHILE SPECIALISATION COULD BE A SUCCESSFUL ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY AT LOWER ELEVATIONS.

IF THE SPECIES SUFFERS FROM INBREEDING DEPRESSION OR IS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, THE NUMBER OF SEEDS MATURED PER FRUIT MAY BE LIMITED BY THE LACK OF OUTCROSSING BY UNRELATED POLLEN. WE TESTED FOR DISTANCE-RELATED GENETIC STRUCTURE BY HAND-POLLINATING PLANTS AT INCREASING DISTANCES AND MEASURING FRUIT SET (BERRIES/POLLINATED FLOWERS) AND SEED NUMBER PER FRUIT IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF BILBERRY (VACCINIUM MYRTILLUS L.)

BAGGING OF THE FLOWER BUDS WITHOUT NATURAL (POLLINATION BY INSECTS) OR HAND-POLLINATION YIELDED ALMOST NO FRUIT OR SEED, SUGGESTING THAT THE SPECIES ARE OBLIGATELY INSECT POLLINATED. SELF-POLLINATION LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SEED NUMBER PER FRUIT AND INCREASED SEED ABORTION COMPARED WITH CROSS-POLLINATION. MOREOVER, SEED NUMBER INCREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POLLEN DONOR AND POLLEN RECIPIENT. FLIGHT DISTANCES OF BUMBLEBEES WERE ESTIMATED FOR BILBERRY BY MONITORING BETWEEN-FLOWER AND, FOR LINGONBERRY, BETWEEN-INFLORESCENCE FLIGHT DISTANCES. ABOUT 90\% OF ALL FLIGHTS WERE AT DISTANCES OF LESS THAN 1 M. AT THIS DISTANCE, WE OBSERVED LESS THAN THE MAXIMUM SEED NUMBER PER FRUIT IN HAND-POLLINATIONS IN BOTH STUDY SPECIES.

BIOL.,"THE ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN FLORAL DIVERGENCE HAS LONG ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS. ALTHOUGH ABUNDANT STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE EFFECT OF POLLINATORS ON FLOWER-SHAPE VARIATION AND PLANT SPECIATION, THE INFLUENCE OF POLLINATORS ON PLANT SPECIES DIFFERENTIATION DURING RAPID RADIATIONS AND THE SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES OF SHIFTS AMONG SIMILAR POLLINATORS ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. HERE, WE EVALUATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN POLLINATORS AND FLORAL MORPHOLOGY IN A CLOSELY RELATED AND RECENTLY DIVERSIFYING CLADE OF LINARIA SPECIES (SECT. SUPINAE SUBSECT. SUPINAE). OUR APPROACH COMBINED POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS, FUNCTIONAL FLORAL MORPHOMETRIC MEASURES AND PHYLOGENETIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSES. THE FAUNA VISITING LINARIA SPECIES WAS DETERMINED BY EXTENSIVE SURVEYS AND CATEGORIZED BY A MODULARITY ALGORITHM, AND THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF FLOWERS WERE ANALYSED BY MEANS OF STANDARD AND GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRIC MEASURES. STANDARD MEASURES FAILED TO FIND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE SIZES OF REPRESENTATIVE POLLINATORS AND FLOWERS. HOWEVER, DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION ANALYSES OF GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRIC DATA REVEALED THAT POLLINATION NICHES ARE FINER PREDICTORS OF FLOWER MORPHOLOGIES IN LINARIA IF COMPARED WITH PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS. SPECIES WITH THE MOST RESTRICTIVE FLOWERS DISPLAYED THE MOST SLENDER SPURS AND WERE POLLINATED BY BEES WITH LARGER PROBOSCIDES. THESE RESTRICTIVE FLOWER SHAPES LIKELY APPEARED MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF THE STUDY GROUP. WE SHOW THAT FLORAL VARIATION CAN BE DRIVEN BY SHIFTS BETWEEN POLLINATORS THAT HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY INCLUDED IN A SINGLE FUNCTIONAL GROUP, AND DISCUSS THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH TRANSITIONS FOR PLANT SPECIES DIFFERENTIATION DURING RAPID RADIATIONS.",DISCRIMINANT FUNCTION ANALYSIS; EVOLUTIONARY RADIATION; FLOWER SHAPE; GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS; LINARIA; LONG-TONGUED BEES; NECTAR SPURS; POLLINATION NICHES,NECTAR SPURS; DIVERSIFICATION RATES; POLLINATOR SHIFTS; AQUILEGIA-FORMOSA; GENERALIST PLANT; FLOWER SHAPE; GENE FLOW; EVOLUTION; COROLLA; PREFERENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"BLANCO-PASTOR, JL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GOTHENBURG, DEPT BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, BOX 461, S-40530 GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.;BLANCO-PASTOR, J.

INSECT CONSERV.,"THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS GLOBAL DECLINES IN DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES, BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER POLLINATING INSECTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INCREASING ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES ON FARMLAND IS TO SOW SIMPLE, LOW COST MIXTURES OF DICOTYLEDONS RICH IN POLLEN AND NECTAR, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE UK AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTION FOR BUTTERFLIES ARE UNKNOWN. SIMILARLY, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON HOW TO MANAGE THIS HABITAT TO MAXIMISE THE PROVISION OF POLLEN AND NECTAR RESOURCES WHILST PROTECTING BREEDING HABITAT FOR BUTTERFLIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVISE MIXTURES AND CUTTING MANAGEMENT REGIMES WHICH ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SEED MIXTURE, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF CUTTING, AND REMOVAL OF CUT MATERIAL ON VEGETATION COMPOSITION, FLOWER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND POLLINATORS (THE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLEBEES, INCLUDING MALES AND QUEENS, ATTRACTED TO THE MIXTURES). WE RECOMMEND THAT NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE REFINED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE BEST PERFORMING SPECIES TO PROVIDE MID- AND LATE-SEASON FORAGE RESOURCES (TRIFOLIUM SPP., LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND CENTAUREA NIGRA), AND THE REMOVAL OF COMPETITIVE GRASS SPECIES. SUMMER CUTTING IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, WITH REMOVAL OF HERBAGE WHERE POSSIBLE, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO HALF THE PATCH TO EXTEND THE FLOWERING SEASON, AND MINIMISE DAMAGE TO BUTTERFLY BREEDING HABITAT. THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE TYPICAL AUTUMN CUT TO THE WHOLE PATCH. EVEN WITH BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, SUCH NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR 3-4 YEARS AND THIS SHOULD BE RECOGNISED IN POLICIES AIMED AT ENHANCING POLLINATOR POPULATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.",POLLINATION; BUMBLEBEES; BUTTERFLIES; HABITAT RESTORATION; FIELD MARGINS; WILDFLOWERS; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; POLLINATION SERVICES; FIELD MARGINS; CONSERVATION; SOWN; AGRICULTURE; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; EFFICACY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,56,"PYWELL, RF (REPRINT AUTHOR), NERC CTR ECOL \& HYDROL, WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB, OXON, ENGLAND.;PYWELL, R.

WE STUDIED THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF MANFREDA VIRGINICA TO MEASURE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF NOCTURNAL AND DIURNAL VISITORS TO SEED SET, AND TEST TO WHAT EXTENT FLORAL CHARACTERS AND VISITATION RATES PREDICT CONTRIBUTION TO SEED SET. THE PATTERN OF NECTAR AND POLLEN PRODUCTION INDICATED THAT M. VIRGINICA IS ADAPTED PRIMARILY TO NOCTURNAL POLLINATION. OUR OBSERVATIONS OF NATURAL POPULATIONS OF M. VIRGINICA DURING TWO FIELD SEASONS INDICATED NOCTURNAL VISITORS CONSISTED OF MEDIUM SIZED MOTHS AND LARGER HAWKMOTHS. THE PRIMARY DIURNAL VISITORS WERE LARGE BEES. THE RESULTS OF EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT DIURNAL POLLINATION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SEED SET THAN NOCTURNAL AND OPEN POLLINATION DESPITE THE FREQUENCY OF DIURNAL VISITS.

EVOL.,"WILDFLOWER STRIPS (WFS) ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. TO DATE, IT IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD HOW WFS PROMOTE FLOWER VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES IN NEARBY INSECT-POLLINATED CROPS. WE THEREFORE ASK WHETHER WFS ENHANCE POLLINATION SERVICE IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS, AND HOW SUCH AN EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE DISTANCE FROM WFS. OVER 2 YEARS, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIMENTALLY SOWN WFS COMPARED TO GRASSY STRIPS ON POLLINATION SERVICES IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA ANANASSA) CROPS ACROSS A TOTAL OF 19 STUDY SITES. MOREOVER, WE EXAMINED FLOWER VISITATION, SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSECT POLLINATOR TAXA AT DIFFERENT WITHIN-FIELD LOCATIONS VARYING IN DISTANCE TO WFS. WE FOUND INCREASED POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE EDGE OF WFS COMPARED TO LOCALLY REDUCED POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE CENTER, WHICH RESULTED IN NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SEED SET BETWEEN WFS AND CONTROL FIELDS. TOTAL FLOWER VISITS AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS WERE HIGHER IN WFS THAN IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY FIELDS. MOREOVER, WILD BEE VISITATION WAS ENHANCED IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS NEAR WFS COMPARED TO FIELD CENTERS, AND INTERMEDIATE AT FIELD EDGES NEAR GRASSY STRIPS. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT DIVERSE WFS CAN INCREASE WILD BEE VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD EDGES OF ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS, BUT THAT OVERALL VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES DO NOT INCREASE. MOREOVER, OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT MAJOR POLLINATOR TAXA EXHIBIT DISTINCT RESPONSES, RESULTING IN A SHIFT OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE TO WFS WITH DIRECT EFFECTS ON CROP POLLINATION. OUR RESULTS THAT WFS ENHANCE RATHER THAN REDUCE CROP POLLINATION SERVICES NEAR WFS SHOULD DISTRACT POSSIBLE CONCERNS BY FARMERS THAT WFS MAY LOCALLY ABSORB RATHER THAN EXPORT CROP POLLINATORS.

WE COMPARED THE FORAGE FLORAL DIVERSITY OF THREE TYPES OF LOWLAND MEADOWS (MOLINIA MEADOWS, TALL HERB FRINGE MEADOWS, AND HAY MEADOWS) LOCATED IN SOUTH EASTERN POLAND. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES WAS 125, INCLUDING 84 SPECIES (67.2\%) CLASSIFIED AS PLANTS VISITED BY INSECTS. THE RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF FORAGE FLORA DIFFERED BETWEEN THE TYPES OF MEADOW. THE MOLINIA MEADOWS AND HAY MEADOWS WERE PREFERRED BY POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS OF POLLINATORS CAN RESPOND TO THE VARIABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN A DIFFERENT WAY. MOLINIA MEADOWS ARE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR THE ABUNDANCE OF BOMBUS SPP., SOLITARY BEES, AND FLIES. THE RDA ORDINATION MODEL DEMONSTRATED THAT THE FLORAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PLANT SPECIES ABUNDANCE, PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS, AND FLORAL ATTRIBUTES (SIZE, SHAPE, PHENOLOGY) WERE ALL IMPORTANT FOR THE ABUNDANCE OF INSECT VISITORS IN THE MOSAIC OF MEADOWS. THE CLUSTER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MOST PLANT SPECIES WERE VISITED BY SIMILAR GROUPS OF INSECTS, HOWEVER, THEIR PROPORTION DIFFERED CONSIDERABLY.

URBAN PLAN.,"MOST STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE EFFECTS OF URBAN LAND USE ON POLLINATORS HAVE COMPARED URBAN SITES WITH ONE TYPE OF RURAL SITE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL HABITATS OR INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IN RURAL AREAS. THE POSITION OF URBAN AREAS WITHIN THAT CONTINUUM IN TERMS OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN THIS WORK, WE STUDIED BEE AND HOVERFLY COMMUNITIES (ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND SPECIES COMPOSITION) IN THREE SITE TYPES ALONG TWO RIVER SYSTEMS CROSSING URBAN AREAS, RURAL AREAS DOMINATED BY AGRICULTURE (TERMED RURAL-AGRICULTURAL) AND RURAL AREAS WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF SEMI-NATURAL LAND USE (TERMED RURAL-NATURAL). POLLINATORS WERE CAUGHT IN AUGUST 2011. ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WERE HIGHEST IN RURAL-NATURAL SITES FOR BOTH TAXONOMIC GROUPS. OUR DATA ALSO INDICATE THAT HOVERFLIES AND BEES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE SURROUNDING LAND USE, WITH BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN RURAL-AGRICULTURAL SITES BUT NOT IN URBAN SITES, AND HOVERFLY ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN URBAN SITES BUT NOT IN RURAL-AGRICULTURAL SITES. THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN THE RESPONSE OF POLLINATORS POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INCORPORATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF RURAL LAND USE AND CLEARLY DEFINING THE RURAL END OF AN URBAN RURAL GRADIENT IN GETTING A CLEAR VIEW ON HOW URBAN LAND USE AFFECTS A SPECIFIC POLLINATOR GROUP. YEAR-ROUND SAMPLING OF THESE POLLINATORS WOULD, HOWEVER, PROBABLY ENABLE A MORE ACCURATE VIEW ON THESE RESPONSES. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V.

AS A MASS-FLOWERING CROP, OILSEED RAPE HAS RECEIVED MUCH FOCUS IN TERMS OF ITS POLLINATION REQUIREMENTS BUT DESPITE A THREEFOLD INCREASE IN AREA OF CULTIVATION OF THIS CROP IN IRELAND OVER THE PAST 5 YEARS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS POLLINATION HERE. WE SURVEYED THE FLOWER VISITING INSECTS FOUND IN COMMERCIAL WINTER OILSEED RAPE FIELDS AND EVALUATED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT POLLINATOR GROUPS, INVESTIGATED THE CONTRIBUTION OF INSECT POLLINATION TO OILSEED RAPE SEED PRODUCTION, AND ESTIMATED THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF INSECT POLLINATION TO THE CROP AT A NATIONAL LEVEL. OUR DATA SHOWED THAT WINTER OILSEED RAPE IS VISITED BY A WIDE VARIETY OF INSECT SPECIES, INCLUDING THE HONEYBEE, BUMBLEBEES, SOLITARY BEES, AND HOVERFLIES. THE HONEYBEE, ERISTALIS HOVERFLIES AND BUMBLEBEES (ESPECIALLY BOMBUS SENSU STRICTO AND B. LAPIDARIUS) WERE THE BEST POLLINATORS OF WINTER OILSEED RAPE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS THEY CARRY, VISITATION RATES PER FLOWER AND THEIR RELATIVE ABUNDANCE PER FIELD. EXCLUSION OF POLLINATORS RESULTED IN A 27 \% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PRODUCED, AND A 30 \% DECREASE IN SEED WEIGHT PER POD IN WINTER CROPS, WITH COMPARABLE VALUES FROM A SPRING OILSEED RAPE FIELD ALSO. THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF INSECT POLLINATION TO WINTER OILSEED RAPE WAS ESTIMATED AS A,NOT SIGN2.6 MILLION PER ANNUM, WHILE THE CONTRIBUTION TO SPRING OILSEED RAPE WAS A,NOT SIGN1.3 MILLION, RESULTING IN AN OVERALL VALUE OF A,NOT SIGN3.9 MILLION PER ANNUM.

NAT.,"SYNCHRONOUS MAST SEEDING IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS COMMON IN PLANT POPULATIONS. RECENT THEORETICAL MODELS SHOW THAT SYNCHRONOUS MAST SEEDING COULD BE A CONSEQUENCE OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND STORAGE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL PLANTS, COUPLED BY POLLEN LIMITATION IN LOW-FLOWERING YEARS. WE USED LONG-TERM POPULATION AND WEATHER DATA TO PARAMETERIZE MODELS OF FLOWERING BASED ON STORED RESOURCES AND POLLEN LIMITATION IN ASTRAGALUS SCAPHOIDES, A BEE-POLLINATED PLANT THAT FLOWERS IN ALTERNATE YEARS. WE USED THESE MODELS TO TEST WHETHER INTERNAL RESOURCE DYNAMICS COULD EXPLAIN MAST SEEDING IN A. SCAPHOIDES AND, IF SO, WHETHER SYNCHRONY WAS CAUSED BY POLLEN LIMITATION AND/OR FLUCTUATIONS IN PRECIPITATION. WE COMPARED PREDICTIONS OF MODELS THAT INCLUDED ALL COMBINATIONS OF THREE FACTORS: CONSTANT VERSUS PRECIPITATION-DEPENDENT RESOURCE GAIN, UNIFORM VERSUS HETEROGENEOUS RESOURCE GAIN (AMONG INDIVIDUAL PLANTS), AND RESOURCE-DEPENDENT VERSUS RESOURCE- AND POLLEN-LIMITED FRUIT SET. POLLEN LIMITATION AND HETEROGENEOUS RESOURCE GAIN WERE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN ALTERNATE-YEAR FLOWERING, BUT PRECIPITATION INCREASED THE QUANTITATIVE MATCH BETWEEN MODEL PREDICTIONS AND FLOWERING DYNAMICS. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE IMPORTANCE OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT POLLEN LIMITATION AS AN ULTIMATE AND PROXIMATE CAUSE OF MAST SEEDING IN A. SCAPHOIDES.

SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND BURNETS WAS MEASURED ON ALL SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS AT 16 FARMS IN A FOREST-DOMINATED AREA OF 50 KM(2) IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, USING SYSTEMATIC TRANSECT WALKS IN APRIL TO SEPTEMBER 2003 (ONLY BUTTERFLIES AND BURNETS) AND 2005. SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES AND BUTTERFLIES WAS INTERCORRELATED, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND. SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES INCREASED WITH THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECT OF THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS STRONGLY POSITIVELY RELATED WITH THE DENSITY OF THE PLANT KNAUTIA ARVENSIS AND NEGATIVELY RELATED WITH THE PROPORTION OF GRAZED GRASSLAND. THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR FOR SOLITARY BEES AND BUTTERFLIES. THE NUMBER OF RED-LISTED SOLITARY BEES WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF MEADOWS WITH LATE HARVEST (AFTER MID-JULY) AND DECREASED WITH INCREASED FARM ISOLATION. THE NUMBER OF BURNET SPECIES (ALL RED-LISTED) WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO VEGETATION HEIGHT, FLOWER DENSITY AND THE PROPORTION OF MEADOWS WITH LATE HARVEST ON A FARM. AREAS WITH A HIGH DENSITY OF K.

APPL. ECOL.,"DOMESTIC GARDENS TYPICALLY CONSIST OF A MIXTURE OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE PLANTS WHICH SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS. MANY GARDENERS WISH TO ENCOURAGE BIODIVERSITY BY CHOOSING APPROPRIATE PLANT TAXA. THE VALUE OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE PLANTS IN SUPPORTING ANIMAL BIODIVERSITY IS, HOWEVER, LARGELY UNKNOWN. THE RELATIVE VALUE OF NATIVE AND NON-NATIVE GARDEN PLANTS TO INVERTEBRATES WAS INVESTIGATED IN A REPLICATED FIELD EXPERIMENT. PLOTS (DELIBERATELY AKIN TO GARDEN BORDERS) WERE PLANTED WITH ONE OF THREE TREATMENTS, REPRESENTING ASSEMBLAGES OF PLANTS BASED ON ORIGIN (NATIVE, NEAR-NATIVE AND EXOTIC). INVERTEBRATES AND RESOURCE MEASUREMENTS WERE RECORDED OVER FOURYEARS. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE ABUNDANCE OF FLOWER-VISITING AERIAL INSECTS (POLLINATORS') ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE PLANT ASSEMBLAGES. FOR ALL POLLINATOR GROUPS ON ALL TREATMENTS, GREATER FLORAL RESOURCE RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN VISITS. THERE WAS, HOWEVER, A GREATER ABUNDANCE OF TOTAL POLLINATORS RECORDED ON NATIVE AND NEAR-NATIVE TREATMENTS COMPARED WITH THE EXOTIC PLOTS. SHORT-TONGUED BUMBLEBEES FOLLOWED THE SAME PATTERN WHILST MORE HOVERFLIES WERE RECORDED ON THE NATIVE TREATMENT THAN THE OTHER TREATMENTS, AND MORE HONEYBEES ON THE NEAR-NATIVE TREATMENT. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATMENTS IN ABUNDANCE OF LONG-TONGUED BUMBLEBEES OR SOLITARY BEES. THE LACK OF DIFFERENCE IN SOLITARY BEE ABUNDANCE BETWEEN TREATMENTS WAS PROBABLY DUE TO A THIRD OF INDIVIDUALS FROM THIS GROUP BEING RECORDED ON ONE EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES. THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITORS CORRESPONDED TO THE PEAK FLOWERING PERIOD OF THE TREATMENTS, THAT IS THERE WERE FEWER FLOWER VISITORS TO THE EXOTIC TREATMENT COMPARED WITH THE OTHER TREATMENTS IN EARLY SUMMER BUT RELATIVELY MORE LATER IN THE SEASON.SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS EXPERIMENT HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT UTILIZING PLANTS FROM ONLY A SINGLE REGION OF ORIGIN (I.E. NATIVENESS) MAY NOT BE AN OPTIMAL STRATEGY FOR RESOURCE PROVISION FOR POLLINATING INSECTS IN GARDENS. GARDENS CAN BE ENHANCED AS A HABITAT BY PLANTING A VARIETY OF FLOWERING PLANTS, BIASED TOWARDS NATIVE AND NEAR-NATIVE SPECIES BUT WITH A SELECTION OF EXOTICS TO EXTEND THE FLOWERING SEASON AND POTENTIALLY PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR SPECIALIST GROUPS.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE POLLEN HARVESTING PATTERN AND TO DETERMINE THE REPRODUCTIVE RATE IN SPECIALIZED ANDRENID BEES. WE MEASURED THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REQUIRED TO PRODUCE ONE BROOD-CELL, THE POLLEN HARVESTING RATE AND COMPARED OUR RESULTS WITH DATA FOR OTHER SPECIALIZED ANDRENID BEE SPECIES. POLLEN-FORAGING TRIPS WERE REGISTERED AND THE ACTIVITY EVENTS (ENTERING, LEAVING OR DIGGING) RECORDED AT THE NESTS. THE MEAN NUMBER OF POLLEN-FORAGING TRIPS PER DAY WAS 5.3 AND AN AVERAGE BEE NEST WAS ACTIVE (AND OPEN) 88 MIN DAY(-1). THE BEES WERE HIGHLY EFFICIENT IN HARVESTING POLLEN AND SPENT ON AVERAGE 10.7 MIN TO COMPLETE ONE POLLEN-FORAGING TRIP. MOST POLLEN-FORAGING TRIPS (77\%) WERE COMPLETED IN LESS THAN 15 MIN. THE DURATION OF POLLEN-FORAGING TRIPS INCREASED OVER THE DAY, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE POLLEN BECAME MORE COSTLY TO HARVEST. BASED ON POLLEN COUNTS (POLLEN LOADS ON BEES AND POLLEN PROVISIONS) AN AVERAGE BEE REQUIRED 3.85 FORAGING TRIPS TO COMPLETE ONE BROOD CELL AND ONE BEE MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH 1.37 BROOD CELLS IN ONE DAY WITH SUITABLE WEATHER. IN THE LITERATURE WE FOUND DATA ON AN ADDITIONAL 19 SPECIALIZED ANDRENID BEE SPECIES.

ENTOMOL.,"THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND ONE OR MORE REARING METHODS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO RELEASE OSMIA LIGNARIA SAY POPULATIONS FROM NATAL NESTS TO POLLINATE FEBRUARY-FLOWERING ALMONDS, PRUNUS AMYGDALUS BATSCH, IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY. WE EXPOSED THREE PHENOLOGICALLY DISTINCT O. LIGNARIA POPULATIONS (EARLY-, MID-, AND LATE-FLYING) TO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE TREATMENTS THROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND WINTERING FOR A TOTAL OF NINE REARING TREATMENTS. THESE TREATMENTS COMBINED THREE APPROACHES TO OBTAIN EARLY LEE EMERGENCE: (1) EXPOSING BEES TO WARMER OR FLUCTUATING TEMPERATURES, OR BOTH, DURING DEVELOPMENT, (2) EXPOSING BEES TO WARMER WINTERING TEMPERATURES: AND (3) USING EARLY-FLYING LEE POPULATIONS FROM CENTRAL VALLEY CALIFORNIA LATITUDES. EXTENDED PERIODS OF HIGH PREWINTERING TEMPERATURES RESULTED IN APPARENT FAT BOD, CONSUMPTION OF PREWINTERING ADULTS AND REDUCTIONS IN SPRINGTIME ADULT LONGEVITY. IN GENERAL, TEMPERATURE TREATMENTS THAT PROMOTED RAPID IMMATURE DEVELOPMENT, AND THUS LONGER WINTERING PERIODS, RESULTED IN EARLIER SPRING EMERGENCE PATTERNS OF BEES WELL TIMED WITH BLOOM PERIOD OF ALMONDS. WARMER WINTERING PERIODS ALSO RESULTED IN EARLIER EMERGENCE. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING GOOD ICE-BLOOM SYNCHRONY, SEVERAL TREATMENTS ALSO YIELDED VIGOROUS EMERGING POPULATIONS, RAPID ESTABLISHMENT AND NESTING, AND POPULATION INCREASES.

MODEL.,"ABIOTIC FEATURES AND BIOGEOGRAPHY HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED AS INFLUENCING FACTORS FOR LARGE-SCALE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ROLE OF INTERACTIONS. AIMING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES AND FLORAL MORPHOLOGY SHAPE THE LARGE-SCALE SPATIAL PATTERN OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTION AND HOW THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE INTERACTIONS, WE ANALYZED THE OIL-COLLECTING CENTRIS BEE SPECIES AND THE FLORAL OIL PRODUCING PLANTS IN SOUTH AMERICA. WE SURVEYED THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE TO BUILD A MATRIX OF INTERACTIONS AND INTERNET DATA PROVIDERS FOR A DATASET OF OCCURRENCE POINTS OF CENTRIS BEE SPECIES AND OIL PLANTS WITH WHICH THE BEES HAVE BEEN OBSERVED. WE GROUPED THE INTERACTING BEE-PLANT SPECIES ACCORDING TO THE TWO TYPES OF FLORAL OIL PRODUCING GLAND (EPITHELIAL AND TRICHOMATIC ELAIOPHORES) AND PERFORMED A CLUSTER ANALYSIS USING THE AVERAGES OF CLIMATIC AND TOPOGRAPHIC VARIABLES TO DETERMINE THE CLIMATE SIMILARITY AMONG THE OCCURRENCE AREAS OF EACH GROUP OF BEE-PLANT INTERACTING SPECIES. WE ESTIMATE THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE CLIMATIC CONDITIONS IN THE OCCURRENCE AREAS OF THE CLUSTERS. WE IDENTIFIED A DISTRIBUTIONAL PATTERN OF PLANT-BEE INTERACTIONS THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH ABIOTIC FACTORS, ESPECIALLY PRECIPITATION, IN THE OCCURRENCE AREAS. AREAS WITH HIGHER PRECIPITATION PRESENTED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SPECIES, ALSO, THE BEE SPECIES WERE ASSOCIATED TO PLANTS WITH EPITHELIAL ELAIOPHORE AND THE INTERACTIONS WERE MORE GENERALIZED (MANY PARTNERS). IN THE AREAS WITH LOWER PRECIPITATION, WE FOUND FEW SPECIES, THE INTERACTIVE PLANT SPECIES INCLUDE THE BOTANICAL FAMILIES THAT HAVE FLOWERS WITH TRICHOMATIC ELAIOPHORES AND THE INTERACTIONS WERE MORE SPECIALIZED (FEW PARTNERS). IN ADDITION, IN THESE LATTER AREAS CENTRIS AND THEIR INTERACTING PLANT ARE PHYLOGENETICALLY RELATED. THE DISTRIBUTIONAL PATTERN OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CENTRIS BEES AND FLORAL OIL PRODUCING PLANTS IN SOUTH AMERICA IS RELATED TO CURRENT ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, MAINLY PRECIPITATION, BUT ALSO TO PAST EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY.

PLANTS FLOWERING IN DISTINCT HABITATS LIKE GRASSLANDS AND FORESTS PRESENT THEIR FLOWERS IN VERY DIFFERENT LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS AND AGAINST DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. SINCE MOST ANGIOSPERMS DEPEND ON OR PROFIT FROM POLLINATION BY ANIMALS, PLANTS MAY EXHIBIT FLOWER COLOURS THAT ARE MOST CONSPICUOUS WHEN SEEN IN THE PREDOMINANT ILLUMINATION OR AGAINST THE PREDOMINANT BACKGROUND COLOUR OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT. TO COMPARE FLOWER COLOURS OF DIFFERENT HABITATS, WE COLLECTED FLOWER REFLECTANCE SPECTRA OF 239 HERBS FROM FOREST AND GRASSLAND SITES IN THREE GERMAN REGIONS. WE COMPARED CHROMATIC AND ACHROMATIC COMPONENTS OF FLOWER COLOURS FROM THE HONEYBEE'S POINT OF VIEW AS WELL AS IN PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) TO EXCLUDE THE BIAS OF PARTICULAR VISUAL SYSTEMS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FLOWER COLOURS DO NOT DIFFER BETWEEN CLOSED FOREST AND OPEN GRASSLAND HABITATS IN ANY CHROMATIC OR ACHROMATIC ASPECT BOTH FROM THE BEE'S PERSPECTIVE AND WITHOUT ANY MODEL BIAS (PCA). THUS, ALTHOUGH THE COLOURS OF LIGHTS AND BACKGROUNDS ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN BOTH TYPES OF HABITATS, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE OF AN ADAPTATION OF FLOWER COLOURS TO THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF BEES.

ECOL.,"BUMBLEBEES ARE MAJOR POLLINATORS OF CROPS AND WILDFLOWERS IN NORTHERN TEMPERATE REGIONS. KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR ECOLOGY IS VITAL FOR THE DESIGN OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION STRATEGIES BUT KEY ASPECTS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HERE WE EMPLOYED MICROSATELLITE MARKERS TO ESTIMATE AND COMPARE FORAGING RANGE AND NEST DENSITY AMONG FOUR UK SPECIES: BOMBUS TERRESTRIS, BOMBUS PASCUORUM, BOMBUS LAPIDARIUS, AND BOMBUS PRATORUM. WORKERS WERE SAMPLED ALONG A 1.5-KM LINEAR TRANSECT ACROSS ARABLE FARMLAND. EIGHT OR NINE POLYMORPHIC MICROSATELLITE MARKERS WERE THEN USED TO IDENTIFY PUTATIVE SISTERS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES, MINIMUM ESTIMATED MAXIMUM FORAGING RANGE WAS GREATEST FOR B. TERRESTRIS (758 M) AND LEAST FOR B. PASCUORUM (449 M). THE ESTIMATE FOR B.

WE RECORDED PLANT SPECIES DIVERSITY, FLORAL DENSITY, POLLINATOR SPECIES AND FLORAL VISITS AT 89 FLOWERING PATCHES WITHIN THE URBAN MATRIX, AND USED TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE AS A FOCAL PLANT SPECIES.

EXTENT OF GREEN AREA WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH VISITS BY ALL SPECIES, BY BEES, AND BY BOMBUS PASCUORUM, BUT NEGATIVELY WITH BEES EXCLUDING THE MAIN VISITOR. THE CORRELATION INCREASED WITH SCALE FOR ALL FOUR VARIABLES, AND THE STRONGEST CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND FOR B. PASCUORUM.

(EUPHORBIACEAE) TO RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORY OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN POLLINATION SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS WERE TREATED AS A HYPOTHESIS AND TESTED FOR CIRCULARITY PROBLEMS AND ROBUSTNESS IN THE FACE OF CHANGES IN THE DATA SET. THE HISTORICAL HYPOTHESIS WAS USED TO MAKE SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS ABOUT DETAILS OF POLLINATION ECOLOGY AND REWARD BIOCHEMISTRY, THE PREDICTIONS WERE SUPPORTED BY INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS. I CONCLUDE THAT POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN DALECHAMPIA HAVE BEEN EVOLUTIONARILY LABILE, RELATIVE TO MOST MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES, WITH REPEATED PARALLELISMS AND REVERSALS. TRANSITIONS AMONG THE THREE POLLINATION SYSTEMS EVOLVED BY DALECHAMPIA (POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING BEES, FRAGRANCE-COLLECTING MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES, AND POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES) HAVE BEEN FACILITATED BY BIOCHEMICAL EXAPTATION (PREADAPTATION). POLLINATION BY MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES IS RELATIVELY RARE IN THE GENUS BUT HAS ORIGINATED INDEPENDENTLY THREE TO FOUR TIMES. IN CONTRAST, POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING FEMALE BEES IS VERY COMMON, BUT HAS ORIGINATED ONLY ONCE. EIGHTY-SIX TO 97\% OF TRANSITIONS BETWEEN POLLINATION SYSTEMS INVOLVED AN INTERMEDIATE PHASE DURING WHICH BOTH OLD AND NEW POLLINATORS WERE EFFECTIVE, BUT 3 TO 14\% OF TRANSITIONS MAY HAVE BEEN `'INSTANTANEOUS,'' LACKING THE INTERMEDIATE PHASE. CLADES OF SPECIES SECRETING RESIN REWARDS ARE ABOUT 10 TIMES AS SPECIES RICH AS CLADES OF SPECIES SECRETING FRAGRANCE REWARDS, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT DIFFERENT EXTINCTION RATES MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE. RELATIVELY ALLOGAMOUS (CROSS-POLLINATING) SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED FROM MORE AUTOGAMOUS (SELF-POLLINATING) SPECIES UP TO 13 TIMES, AND AUTOGAMOUS SPECIES HAVE EVOLVED FROM MORE ALLOGAMOUS ONES UP TO 11 TIMES.

MATSUM. \& NAKAI] USING THE DOMINANT GENE SP (SPOTTED LEAVES AND FRUIT) AS A MARKER. THE EXPERIMENT CONSISTED OF TWO STUDIES AND WAS A SPLIT PLOT IN A RANDOMIZED COMPLETE BLOCK DESIGN WITH 3 YEARS (2009 TO 2011) AND FOUR LOCATIONS (CLINTON, KINSTON, OXFORD, LEWISTON, NC).

ASKERLUND P;ALMERS E,ASKERLUND P,FOREST GARDENS - NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR URBAN CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS,URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING,URBAN FOR. URBAN GREEN.,"THIS CASE STUDY EXPLORES A LEARNING SITUATION IN A FOREST GARDEN IN SWEDEN. A FOREST GARDEN IS AN EDIBLE POLYCULTURE LANDSCAPE WITH DIFFERENT LAYERS OF MOSTLY PERENNIAL VEGETATION. THE FOREST GARDEN IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE THE YIELD OF USEFUL PLANTS WHILE MINIMIZING THE INPUT OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES, INCLUDING HUMAN LABOUR. FOREST GARDENS MAY OFFER LEARNING SITUATIONS THAT CONTEXTUALIZE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND RELATIONS BETWEEN ORGANISMS AS WELL AS SITUATIONS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR EVALUATIVE DEVELOPMENT (KELLER T, 2002), I.E. THE DEVELOPMENT OF VALUES, BELIEFS AND MORAL PERSPECTIVES IN CHILDREN. TWENTY-SEVEN SEVEN TO EIGHT YEAR OLD PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE FOLLOWED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF A THREE YEAR PROJECT IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATED IN DEVELOPING A FOREST GARDEN. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE CHILDREN REASON WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT ORGANISMS' DEPENDENCE ON AND RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER, THEMSELVES INCLUDED. SPECIFICALLY: HOW DO THE CHILDREN DESCRIBE THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OTHER ORGANISMS IN THE FOREST GARDEN? WHAT VALUES OF NATURE ARE EXPRESSED BY THE CHILDREN, AND IN RELATION TO WHICH SITUATIONS IN THE FOREST GARDEN? DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THE FORM OF FIELD NOTES, AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS AND PHOTOS FROM THE CHILDREN'S VISITS TO THE FOREST GARDEN. THE PHOTOS WERE USED FOR STIMULATED RECALL IN FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A COMBINATION OF QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS (PATTON, 2002) AND SEMI-QUANTITATIVE METHODS. THE CHILDREN IN THE STUDY PRESENTED A UNIDIRECTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE ORGANISMS, ESPECIALLY THE INSECTS, IN THE FOREST GARDEN. RATHER THAN ASKING WHAT THESE ORGANISMS CAN DO FOR ME/US, THEY POSE THE QUESTION: WHAT CAN I/WE DO FOR THE BUGS/PLANTS/ BEES? THE HUMANISTIC VALUES, EXPRESSED BY THE CHILDREN AS A WILLINGNESS TO HELP OTHER ORGANISMS (MOSTLY INSECTS) ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPLICIT AIMS OF THE FORMER CURRICULUM FOR BIOLOGY TO ``PROMOTE CARE AND RESPECT FOR NATURE. WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THESE HUMANISTIC VALUES ARE NO LONGER EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM. IT IS STRIKING THAT THE ANTHROPOCENTRIC ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PERSPECTIVE (INTRODUCED IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM FROM GRADE 4), IS SO RARE IN THE DATA. THE CHILDREN SELDOM MENTIONED THE BENEFITS FOR HUMANS FROM INSECT POLLINATION, EVEN THOUGH THIS RELATIONSHIP IS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PEDAGOGUES TOGETHER WITH HUMANISTIC VALUES. IN OBSERVATIONS, THE CHILDREN SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF CURIOSITY FOR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT (NATURALISTIC VALUE) AS WELL AS JOY AND ENTHUSIASM ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FOREST GARDEN. AESTHETIC VALUES WERE EXPRESSED IN RELATION TO FLOWERS, CONES, BERRIES, A SNAIL'S SHELL ETC. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT FOREST GARDENS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE PLACES WHERE CHILDREN CAN CONNECT EMOTIONALLY AND COGNITIVELY TO OTHER ORGANISMS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER GMBH.

THE ALLODAPINE BEE, BRAUNSAPIS PUANGENSIS (COCKERELL) (XYLOCOPINAE: ALLODAPINI), WAS INTRODUCED TO FIJI BETWEEN 1965 AND 2003, MOST LIKELY FROM INDIA. UNTIL VERY RECENTLY, LITTLE WAS KNOWN ABOUT ITS DISPERSAL ABILITY AND SUBSEQUENT GEOGRAPHICAL SPREAD ACROSS FIJI. OUR STUDY GREATLY INCREASES THE GEOGRAPHICAL RECORDS OF B.PUANGENSIS ACROSS VITI LEVU, FIJI'S LARGEST ISLAND, AS WELL AS SURROUNDING ISLANDS INCLUDING VANUA LEVU, TAVEUNI AND MANA ISLAND. WE FOUND THAT B.PUANGENSIS IS PRESENT THROUGHOUT ALL MAJOR REGIONS OF VITI LEVU, AND IT APPEARS TO BE HIGHLY VAGILE. IN FIJI, WE ONLY FOUND B.PUANGENSIS FORAGING ON INTRODUCED PLANT SPECIES, BUT NESTING IN BOTH NATIVE AND INTRODUCED PLANT SPECIES. INCREASED POLLINATION OF WEEDY EXOTIC PLANTS BY THIS BEE COULD INCREASE THEIR ABUNDANCE IN FIJI.

EVOL.,"BODY SIZE IS AN INTEGRAL FUNCTIONAL TRAIT THAT UNDERLIES POLLINATION-RELATED ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES, YET IT IS OFTEN IMPRACTICAL TO MEASURE DIRECTLY. ALLOMETRIC SCALING LAWS HAVE BEEN USED TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, MOST EXISTING MODELS RELY UPON SMALL SAMPLE SIZES, GEOGRAPHICALLY RESTRICTED SAMPLING AND HAVE LIMITED APPLICABILITY FOR NON-BEE TAXA. ALLOMETRIC MODELS THAT CONSIDER BIOGEOGRAPHY, PHYLOGENETIC RELATEDNESS, AND INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION ARE URGENTLY REQUIRED TO ENSURE GREATER ACCURACY. WE MEASURED BODY SIZE AS DRY WEIGHT AND INTERTEGULAR DISTANCE (ITD) OF 391 BEE SPECIES (4,035 SPECIMENS) AND 103 HOVERFLY SPECIES (399 SPECIMENS) ACROSS FOUR BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: AUSTRALIA, EUROPE, NORTH AMERICA, AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE UPDATED EXISTING MODELS WITHIN A BAYESIAN MIXED-MODEL FRAMEWORK TO TEST THE POWER OF ITD TO PREDICT INTERSPECIFIC VARIATION IN POLLINATOR DRY WEIGHT IN INTERACTION WITH DIFFERENT CO-VARIATES: PHYLOGENY OR TAXONOMY, SEXUAL DIMORPHISM, AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGION. IN ADDITION, WE USED ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION TO ASSESS INTRASPECIFIC DRY WEIGHT ITD RELATIONSHIPS FOR TEN BEES AND FIVE HOVERFLY SPECIES. INCLUDING CO-VARIATES LED TO MORE ROBUST INTERSPECIFIC BODY SIZE PREDICTIONS FOR BOTH BEES AND HOVERFLIES RELATIVE TO MODELS WITH THE ITD ALONE. IN CONTRAST, AT THE INTRASPECIFIC LEVEL, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ITD IS AN INCONSISTENT PREDICTOR OF BODY SIZE FOR BEES AND HOVERFLIES. THE USE OF ALLOMETRIC SCALING LAWS TO ESTIMATE BODY SIZE IS MORE SUITABLE FOR INTERSPECIFIC COMPARATIVE ANALYSES THAN ASSESSING INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION.

BOT.,"IN THE UK, THE FLOWERS OF FRUIT-BEARING HEDGEROW PLANTS PROVIDE A SUCCESSION OF POLLEN AND NECTAR FOR FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR. THE FRUITS OF HEDGEROW PLANTS ARE A SOURCE OF WINTER FOOD FOR FRUGIVOROUS BIRDS ON FARMLAND. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER RECENT DECLINES IN POLLINATOR POPULATIONS ARE LIKELY TO THREATEN FRUIT-SET AND HENCE FOOD SUPPLY FOR BIRDS. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF FIVE COMMON HEDGEROW PLANTS: BLACKTHORN (PRUNUS SPINOSA), HAWTHORN (CRATAEGUS MONOGYNA), DOG ROSE (ROSA CANINA), BRAMBLE (RUBUS FRUTICOSUS) AND IVY (HEDERA HELIX). THE REQUIREMENT FOR INSECT POLLINATION WAS INVESTIGATED INITIALLY BY EXCLUDING INSECTS FROM FLOWERS BY USING MESH BAGS AND COMPARING IMMATURE AND MATURE FRUIT-SET WITH THOSE OF OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS. THOSE PLANTS THAT SHOWED A REQUIREMENT FOR INSECT POLLINATION WERE THEN TESTED TO COMPARE FRUIT-SET UNDER TWO ADDITIONAL POLLINATION SERVICE SCENARIOS: (1) REDUCED POLLINATION, WITH INSECTS EXCLUDED FROM FLOWERS BAGGED FOR PART OF THE FLOWERING PERIOD, AND (2) SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION, WITH FLOWERS HAND CROSS-POLLINATED TO TEST FOR POLLEN LIMITATION. THE PROPORTIONS OF FLOWERS SETTING FRUIT IN BLACKTHORN, HAWTHORN AND IVY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN INSECTS WERE EXCLUDED FROM FLOWERS BY USING MESH BAGS, WHEREAS FRUIT-SET IN BRAMBLE AND DOG ROSE WERE UNAFFECTED. RESTRICTING THE EXPOSURE OF FLOWERS TO POLLINATORS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FRUIT-SET. HOWEVER, BLACKTHORN AND HAWTHORN WERE FOUND TO BE POLLEN-LIMITED, SUGGESTING THAT THE POLLINATION SERVICE WAS INADEQUATE IN THE STUDY AREA.

HERE, WE USED AN AUTOMATED REWARD AND MONITORING SYSTEM TO EVALUATE MODIFICATION IN A COMMON POLLEN-EXTRACTION ROUTINE, FLORAL SONICATION. THROUGH A SERIES OF LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE BUMBLEBEE, BOMBUS IMPATIENS, WE EXAMINED WHETHER VARIATION IN SONICATION FREQUENCY AND ACCELERATION IS DUE TO INSTRUMENTAL LEARNING BASED ON REWARDS, A FIXED BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO REWARDS, AND/OR A MECHANICAL CONSTRAINT. WE FIRST INVESTIGATED WHETHER BEES COULD LEARN TO ADJUST THEIR SONICATION FREQUENCY IN RESPONSE TO POLLEN REWARDS GIVEN ONLY FOR SPECIFIED FREQUENCY RANGES AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF INSTRUMENTAL LEARNING. HOWEVER, WE FOUND THAT ABSENCE VERSUS RECEIPT OF A POLLEN REWARD DID LEAD TO A PREDICTABLE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE, WHICH DEPENDED ON BEE SIZE. FINALLY, WE FOUND SOME EVIDENCE OF MECHANICAL CONSTRAINTS, IN THAT FLOWER MASS AFFECTED SONICATION ACCELERATION (BUT NOT FREQUENCY) THROUGH AN INTERACTION WITH BEE SIZE. IN GENERAL, LARGER BEES SHOWED MORE FLEXIBILITY IN SONICATION FREQUENCY AND ACCELERATION, POTENTIALLY REFLECTING A SIZE-BASED CONSTRAINT ON THE RANGE OVER WHICH SMALLER BEES CAN MODIFY FREQUENCY AND ACCELERATION.

WE USED DRIED ANTS PINNED TO INFLORESCENCES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANT PRESENCE AND ANT IDENTITY ON POTENTIAL POLLINATORS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF TREEHOPPERS INCREASES ANT ABUNDANCE ON FLOWERS AND DISRUPTS POLLINATION BY OIL-COLLECTING BEES, DECREASING THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF FLORAL VISITS AND REDUCING FRUIT AND SEED SET. TREEHOPPER HERBIVORY HAS NO DIRECT EFFECT ON FRUIT OR SEED PRODUCTION, WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF TREEHOPPER DENSITY. PINNED ANTS PROMOTE AVOIDANCE BY FLORAL VISITORS, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VISITS. ANT IDENTITY MEDIATES VISITATION DECISIONS, WITH ECTATOMMA BRUNNEUM CAUSING GREATER AVOIDANCE BY FLORAL VISITORS THAN CAMPONOTUS RUFIPES. FIELD VIDEOS SHOW THAT POLLINATING BEES ARE HARASSED BY ANTS NEAR FLOWERS, PROMPTING AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR BY THE BEES.

HERE WE REPORT AN EXPERIMENT USING THE PLANT ANTIRRHINUM MAJUS AND THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS TO INVESTIGATE HOW PRIOR LEARNING EXPERIENCE MAY AFFECT POLLINATOR PREFERENCES BETWEEN FLORAL TYPES WHEN THESE ARE PRESENTED TOGETHER. WE TRAINED NAIVE BUMBLEBEES TO FORAGE FREELY ON FLOWERING INDIVIDUALS OF EITHER A. MAJUS PSEUDOMAJUS (MAGENTA FLOWERS) OR A. MAJUS STRIATUM (YELLOW FLOWERS) IN A FLIGHT CAGE. WE THEN USED A Y-MAZE DEVICE TO EXPOSE TRAINED BUMBLEBEES TO A DUAL CHOICE BETWEEN THE FLORAL TYPES. WE TESTED THE INFLUENCE OF TRAINING ON THEIR CHOICE, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PLANT SIGNALS AVAILABLE (VISUAL SIGNALS, OLFACTORY SIGNALS, OR BOTH). BUMBLEBEES HAD NO INNATE PREFERENCE FOR EITHER SUBSPECIES. BUMBLEBEES TRAINED ON THE YELLOW-FLOWERED SUBSPECIES LATER PREFERRED THE YELLOW TYPE, EVEN WHEN ONLY VISUAL OR ONLY OLFACTORY SIGNALS WERE AVAILABLE, AND THEIR PREFERENCE WAS NOT REINFORCED WHEN BOTH SIGNAL TYPES WERE AVAILABLE. IN CONTRAST, BUMBLEBEES TRAINED ON THE MAGENTA-FLOWERED SUBSPECIES SHOWED NO FURTHER PREFERENCE BETWEEN FLORAL TYPES AND TOOK SLIGHTLY MORE TIME TO MAKE THEIR CHOICE.

WE, THEREFORE, HYPOTHESIZED THAT, FOR PLANT SPECIES WITH A GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM, CHANGES IN FLORAL ORIENTATION WOULD AFFECT THE COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS AND THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION TO POLLINATION. GERANIUM REFRACTUM, AN ALPINE PLANT WITH DOWNWARD FLORAL ORIENTATION WAS USED IN THIS STUDY. WE CREATED UPWARD-FACING FLOWERS BY ALTERING THE FLOWER ANGLE. WE COMPARED THE POLLINATOR DIVERSITY, POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS, AND POLLINATOR IMPORTANCE, AS WELL AS FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BETWEEN FLOWERS WITH DOWNWARD- AND UPWARD-FACING ORIENTATION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE UPWARD-FACING FLOWERS WERE VISITED BY A WIDER SPECTRUM OF POLLINATORS (CLASSIFIED INTO FUNCTIONAL GROUPS), WITH HIGHER POLLINATOR DIVERSITY THAN NATURAL FLOWERS. MOREOVER, DUE TO INFLUENCES ON VISITATION NUMBER AND POLLEN REMOVAL, THE POLLINATOR IMPORTANCE EXHIBITED BY THE MAIN POLLINATOR GROUPS DIFFERED BETWEEN FLOWER TYPES. COMPARED WITH NATURAL FLOWERS, THE POLLINATION CONTRIBUTION OF PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS (I.E., BUMBLEBEES) DECREASED IN UPWARD-FACING FLOWERS AND OTHER INFREQUENT POLLINATORS, SUCH AS SOLITARY BEES AND MUSCOID FLIES, REMOVED MORE POLLEN. CONSEQUENTLY, STIGMATIC POLLEN LOADS WERE LOWER IN UPWARD- THAN IN DOWNWARD-FACING FLOWERS. THESE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT FLORAL ORIENTATION MAY AFFECT THE LEVEL OF GENERALIZATION OF A POLLINATION SYSTEM AND THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DIVERSE POLLINATORS.

UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENTS DEFINING THESE COMMUNITIES IS ESSENTIAL IF CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. WE EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES IN A DYNAMIC MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPE, COMPRISING A MOSAIC OF POST-FIRE REGENERATING HABITATS, AND WHICH IS A RECOGNIZED GLOBAL HOTSPOT FOR BEE DIVERSITY. EACH COMMUNITY WAS CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGHLY SKEWED SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION, WITH A FEW DOMINANT AND MANY RARE BEE SPECIES, AND WAS CONSISTENT WITH A LOG SERIES MODEL INDICATING THAT A FEW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS GOVERN THE COMMUNITY. FLORAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF FORAGE RESOURCES PRESENT, AND THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCALITY ORGANIZED BEE COMMUNITIES AT VARIOUS LEVELS: (1) THE OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THE BEE COMMUNITY (116 SPECIES), AS REVEALED THROUGH ORDINATION, WAS DEPENDENT UPON NECTAR RESOURCE DIVERSITY (DEFINED AS THE VARIETY OF NECTAR VOLUME-CONCENTRATION COMBINATIONS AVAILABLE), THE RATIO OF POLLEN TO NECTAR ENERGY, FLORAL DIVERSITY, FLORAL ABUNDANCE, AND POST-FIRE AGE. (2) BEE DIVERSITY, MEASURED AS SPECIES RICHNESS, WAS CLOSELY LINKED TO FLORAL DIVERSITY (ESPECIALLY OF ANNUALS), NECTAR RESOURCE DIVERSITY, AND POST-FIRE AGE OF THE HABITAT. (3) THE ABUNDANCE OF THE MOST COMMON SPECIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO POST-FIRE AGE, GRAZING INTENSITY, AND NESTING SUBSTRATE AVAILABILITY.

J. BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: DIVERSIFICATION OF FLORAL TRAITS IN ANGIOSPERMS IS OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO HAVE BEEN DRIVEN BY ADAPTATIONS TO POLLINATORS. NEVERTHELESS, PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES ON THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS ARE STILL LIMITED. WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL TRAIT CHANGES AND POLLINATOR SHIFTS IN BORNEAN GINGERS (ZINGIBERACEAE). THESE PLANTS HAVE STRONGLY ZYGOMORPHIC FLOWERS POLLINATED BY SPIDERHUNTER BIRDS, BEES OF THE GENUS AMEGILLA, AND HALICTID BEES. METHODS: WE IDENTIFIED POLLINATION SYSTEMS THROUGH FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND RECORDED PETAL COLOR, QUANTITY OF FLORAL REWARDS, AND SEVEN MEASURES OF FLOWER MORPHOLOGY IN 28 GINGER SPECIES. PHYLOGENETIC TREES WERE CONSTRUCTED FROM NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES OF THE MATK AND ITS REGIONS. WE EXAMINED THE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE EVOLUTION OF POLLINATION SYSTEMS AND FLORAL TRAITS USING PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS. KEY RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN PINK COLOR AND SPIDERHUNTER POLLINATION, ORANGE AND AMEGILLA POLLINATION, AND YELLOW AND WHITE AND HALICTID POLLINATION. SUGAR PRODUCTION WAS HIGHER IN SPIDERHUNTER-POLLINATED SPECIES AND LOWER IN HALICTID-POLLINATED. MEANWHILE, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION ONLY FOR A SUBSET OF THE FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS MEASURED. FLORAL TUBE LENGTH, WHICH IS OFTEN THOUGHT TO EVOLVE TO MATCH THE LENGTHS OF POLLINATOR PROBING APPARATUSES, DID NOT SHOW ANY CORRELATION. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN THE STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATION AMONG POLLINATION SYSTEMS AND FLORAL TRAITS. LACK OF SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION IN SOME TRAITS COULD PARTLY BE EXPLAINED BY FLORAL FUNCTIONS OTHER THAN POLLINATION, SUCH AS ADAPTATIONS TO PREVENT HERBIVORE DAMAGE TO THE OVULES.

WE FOUND THAT THE INSECT DIVERSITY DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE OTCS, WITH DECREASES OF DIPTERAN INSECTS AND BEES. WE CONCLUDED THAT CHANGES OF P/O RATIO IN THE STUDIED PLANT SPECIES MIGHT RESULT FROM POLLINATION FAILURE, WHICH MIGHT BE THE RESULTS OF MISMATCH BETWEEN FLOWERING TIME AND POLLINATOR ACTIVITIES.

SARGENT RD;OTTO SP,SARGENT RD,A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF POLLINATION MODE AND THE EVOLUTION OF DICHOGAMY IN ANGIOSPERMS,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,EVOL. ECOL. RES.,"DICHOGAMY, THE TEMPORAL SEPARATION OF MALE AND FEMALE FUNCTION, IS WIDESPREAD AMONG ANGIOSPERMS, YET ITS CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. TWO FORMS OF DICHOGAMY EXIST: PROTANDRY, IN WHICH POLLEN DISPERSAL PRECEDES STIGMA RECEPTIVITY, AND PROTOGYNY, IN WHICH THE REVERSE OCCURS. SPECIES-LEVEL COMPARATIVE STUDIES SHOW THAT PROTANDROUS SPECIES TEND TO BE POLLINATED BY BEES OR FLIES, WHEREAS PROTOGYNOUS SPECIES TEND TO BE WIND-OR BEETLE-POLLINATED. THIS SUGGESTS A FUNCTIONAL ROLE FOR POLLINATORS IN THE EVOLUTION OF DICHOGAMY. WE MAPPED DICHOGAMY AND POLLINATION CHARACTERS ONTO A PHYLOGENY OF ANGIOSPERM SPECIES. USING THE PROGRAM DISCRETE, TWO MODELS OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE (ONE ALLOWING ONLY FOR INDEPENDENT EVOLUTION AND THE OTHER ALLOWING CORRELATED EVOLUTION OF THE TWO TRAITS) WERE FIT TO THE PHYLOGENY TO TEST FOR CORRELATIONS. LOG-LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS AND MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS SUPPORT A CORRELATED MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE TYPE OF DICHOGAMY AND THE FORM OF POLLINATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CORRELATIONS ARE ROBUST TO PHYLOGENETIC CORRECTION. HOWEVER, POLLINATION MODE WAS NOT FOUND TO AFFECT TRANSITIONS BETWEEN PROTANDRY AND PROTOGYNY. RATHER, AN EXAMINATION OF TRANSITION RATES REVEALED THAT THE RATE OF TRANSITIONS BETWEEN BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC POLLINATION DEPENDS ON WHETHER A SPECIES IS PROTANDROUS OR PROTOGYNOUS. ADDITIONALLY, WE FOUND MORE SUPPORT FOR A ROLE OF POLLINATION IN THE EVOLUTION OF PROTOGYNY FROM NON-PROTOGYNY THAN IN THE EVOLUTION OF PROTANDRY FROM NON-PROTANDRY.

J. ECOL.,"RECENT ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE IS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH AVERAGE SHIFTS TOWARD EARLIER SEASONAL TIMING OF ACTIVITY (PHENOLOGY) IN TEMPERATE-ZONE SPECIES. SHIFTS IN PHENOLOGY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS, TO THE DETRIMENT OF ONE OR MORE INTERACTING SPECIES. RECENT MODELS PREDICT THAT DETRIMENTAL PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH MAY INCREASINGLY OCCUR BETWEEN PLANTS AND THEIR POLLINATORS. ONE WAY TO TEST THIS PREDICTION IS TO EXAMINE DATA FROM ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCE LARGE ANNUAL WEATHER FLUCTUATIONS. TAKING THIS APPROACH, WE ANALYZED INTERACTIONS OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD AMONG 132 PLANT SPECIES AND 665 POLLINATING INSECT SPECIES WITHIN A MEDITERRANEAN COMMUNITY. FOR EACH PLANT SPECIES WE RECORDED ONSET AND DURATION OF FLOWERING AND NUMBER OF POLLINATOR SPECIES. FLOWERING ONSET VARIED AMONG YEARS, AND A YEAR OF EARLIER FLOWERING OF A SPECIES TENDED TO BE A YEAR OF FEWER SPECIES POLLINATING ITS FLOWERS. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS ATTRIBUTABLE PRINCIPALLY TO EARLY-FLOWERING SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT SHIFTS TOWARD EARLIER PHENOLOGY DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE MAY REDUCE POLLINATION SERVICES DUE TO PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH. EARLIER FLOWERING ONSET OF A SPECIES ALSO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PROLONGED FLOWERING DURATION, BUT IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT THIS WILL COUNTERBALANCE ANY NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LOWER POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. AMONG PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT LIFE HISTORIES, ANNUALS WERE MORE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY FLOWERING POLLINATOR MISMATCHES THAN PERENNIALS. SPECIALIZED PLANT SPECIES (THOSE ATTRACTING A SMALLER NUMBER OF POLLINATOR SPECIES) DID NOT EXPERIENCE DISPROPORTIONATE INTERANNUAL FLUCTUATIONS IN PHENOLOGY. THUS THEY DO NOT APPEAR TO BE FACED WITH DISPROPORTIONATE FLUCTUATIONS IN POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS, CONTRARY TO THE EXPECTATION THAT SPECIALISTS ARE AT GREATEST RISK OF LOSING MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

J. BIOL.,"POLLINATORS PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE TO NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND AGRICULTURE. IN TOMATOES FLOWERS, ANTHERS ARE PORICIDAL, POLLEN MAY DROP FROM THEIR PORE WHEN FLOWERS ARE SHAKEN BY THE WIND. HOWEVER, BEES THAT VIBRATE THESE ANTHERS INCREASE POLLEN LOAD ON THE STIGMA AND IN FRUIT PRODUCTION. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE POLLINATOR RICHNESS OF TOMATO FLOWERS AND INVESTIGATE THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL TRAITS RELATED TO THE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION IN PLANTATIONS OF CENTRAL BRAZIL. THE TIME OF ANTHESIS, FLOWER DURATION, AND THE NUMBER AND VIABILITY OF POLLEN GRAINS AND OVULES WERE RECORDED. FLORAL VISITORS WERE OBSERVED AND COLLECTED. FLOWER BUDS OPENED AROUND 6H30 AND CLOSED AROUND 18H00. THEY REOPENED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AT THE SAME TIME IN THE MORNING, LASTING ON AVERAGE 48 HOURS. THE HIGHEST POLLEN AVAILABILITY OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF ANTHESIS. AFTERWARDS, THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DECLINED, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN 10H00 TO 12H00, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POLLINATOR VISITATION PATTERN. FORTY BEE SPECIES WERE FOUND IN THE TOMATO FIELDS, 30 OF WHICH WERE CONSIDERED POLLINATORS. WE FOUND THAT DURING THE FLOWERING PERIOD, PLANTS OFFERED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POLLEN TO THEIR VISITORS. THESE MAY EXPLAIN THE HIGH RICHNESS AND AMOUNT OF BEES THAT VISIT THE TOMATO FLOWERS IN THE STUDY AREAS. THE PERIOD OF POLLEN AVAILABILITY AND DEPLETION THROUGHOUT THE DAY OVERLAPPED WITH THE BEES FORAGING PERIOD, SUGGESTING THAT BEES ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN REMOVING POLLEN GRAINS FROM ANTHERS. MANY OF THESE GRAINS PROBABLY LAND ON THE STIGMA OF THE SAME FLOWER, LEADING TO SELF- POLLINATION AND SUBSEQUENT FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. NATIVE BEES (EXOMALOPSIS SPP.) ARE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS OF TOMATO FLOWERS AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE TO INCREASING CROP PRODUCTIVITY.

ECOL.,"INCREASING CULTIVATION OF OILSEED RAPE MAY HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR POLLINATORS AND WILD PLANT POLLINATION. BY PROVIDING POLLINATING INSECTS WITH POLLEN AND NECTAR, OILSEED RAPE BENEFITS SHORT-TONGUED, GENERALIST INSECT SPECIES. LONG-TONGUED BUMBLE BEE SPECIES, SPECIALIZED TO OTHER FLOWER TYPES, MAY INSTEAD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED COMPETITION FROM THE GENERALISTS (E.G. DUE TO NECTAR-ROBBING OF LONG-TUBED FLOWERS) AFTER OILSEED RAPE FLOWERING HAS CEASED. WE EXPECTED THAT THE INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF SHORT-TONGUED POLLINATORS AND REDUCED ABUNDANCE OF LONG-TONGUED BUMBLE BEES IN LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE WOULD IMPACT THE POLLINATION OF LATER FLOWERING WILD PLANT SPECIES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECTED CONTRASTING EFFECTS ON PLANTS POLLINATED BY SHORT-TONGUED POLLINATORS AND THOSE POLLINATED BY LONG-TONGUED BUMBLE BEES. WE PREDICTED THAT SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, WHICH PROVIDE INSECTS WITH ALTERNATIVE FLORAL RESOURCES, WOULD REDUCE BOTH NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE EFFECTS ON POLLINATION BY MITIGATING COMPETITION BETWEEN POLLINATORS. IN 16 SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, SURROUNDED BY AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, WITH A VARIATION IN BOTH THE PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE AND THE PROPORTION OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND WITHIN 1 KM, WE STUDIED REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT IN TWO SPECIES OF POTTED PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT POLLINATION STRATEGIES: THE WOODLAND STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA VESCA) AND RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE). THE FIRST SPECIES IS MAINLY POLLINATED BY SHORT-TONGUED POLLINATORS, E.G. HOVERFLIES AND SOLITARY BEES, AND THE LATTER BY LONG-TONGUED BUMBLE BEES. BOTH SPECIES FLOWERED AFTER OILSEED RAPE. STRAWBERRY WEIGHT WAS HIGHER IN LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE, BUT ONLY IN LANDSCAPES WITH A LOW PROPORTION OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND. THE PROPORTION OF DEVELOPED ACHENES WAS ALSO POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE, BUT ONLY DURING THE LATEST FLOWERING PERIOD. IN CONTRAST, RED CLOVER SEED SET WAS UNRELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE. WHEREAS THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE TWO STRAWBERRY MEASUREMENTS CALLS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT OILSEED RAPE CAN AFFECT LATER FLOWERING PLANTS AND THAT THE IMPACT DIFFERS AMONG SPECIES.

POLLEN PLACED ON A POLLINATOR'S BODY CAN BE PICKED UP BY CONSPECIFIC STIGMAS OR IT CAN BE COLLECTED BY THE POLLINATOR AS FOOD. HYPOTHETICALLY, ONE SOLUTION IS FOR POLLEN TO BE PLACED ON `SAFE SITES' ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY, SITES WHERE THE POLLINATOR CANNOT EASILY REMOVE IT, LEAVING THE POLLEN FOR STIGMAS. WE COMPARED 14 SITES ON THE BUMBLEBEE BODY IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY OF THE BEE TO GROOM OFF FLUORESCENT POWER, A DUST THAT MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS ANALOGOUS TO POLLEN. THE SAFEST SITES WERE ALONG THE MIDLINE OF THE DORSAL THORAX, THE DORSAL ABDOMEN, AND THE VENTRAL ABDOMEN. NEXT, WE COUNTED HOW MUCH POLLEN IS BORNE ON THE 14 SITES BY BEES VISITING ONE NECTARIFEROUS AND THREE NECTARLESS PEDICULARIS SPECIES. IN THE FOUR SPECIES, ONLY 7, 26, 28, AND 30\% OF POLLEN FOUND ON THE BEES WERE ON SAFE SITES.

WHEN FLOWERS OF A PREFERRED FORAGE PLANT DECLINE IN AN AREA, SITE-FIDELITY MAY CAUSE INDIVIDUAL FLOWER FEEDERS TO STAY IN AN AREA AND SWITCH PLANT SPECIES RATHER THAN SEARCH FOR PREFERRED PLANTS IN A NEW LOCATION. A NEWLY BLOOMING PLANT SPECIES MAY QUICKLY INHERIT A SET OF VISITORS FROM A PRIOR PLANT SPECIES, AND THEREFORE EXPERIENCE HIGHER POLLINATION SUCCESS THAN IT WOULD IN AN AREA WHERE THE FIRST SPECIES NEVER BLOOMED. TO TEST THIS, WE MANIPULATED THE PLACEMENT AND TIMING OF TWO PLANT SPECIES, DELPHINIUM BARBEYI AND LATER-BLOOMING GENTIANA PARRYI. WE RECORDED THE RESPONSES OF INDIVIDUALLY MARKED BUMBLE BEE POLLINATORS. ABOUT 63\% OF MARKED INDIVIDUALS RETURNED REPEATEDLY TO THE SAME AREAS TO FORAGE ON DELPHINIUM. WHEN DELPHINIUM WAS EXPERIMENTALLY TAKEN OUT OF BLOOM, MOST OF THOSE SITE-FAITHFUL INDIVIDUALS (78\%) STAYED AND SWITCHED TO GENTIANA. CONSEQUENTLY, GENTIANA FLOWERS RECEIVED MORE VISITS IN AREAS WHERE DELPHINIUM HAD PREVIOUSLY FLOWERED, COMPARED TO AREAS WHERE DELPHINIUM WAS STILL FLOWERING OR NEVER OCCURRED. GENTIANA STIGMAS RECEIVED MORE POLLEN IN AREAS WHERE DELPHINIUM DISAPPEARED THAN WHERE IT NEVER BLOOMED, INDICATING THAT DELPHINIUM INCREASES THE POLLINATION OF GENTIANA WHEN THEY ARE SEPARATED IN TIME. OVERALL, WE SHOW THAT INDIVIDUAL BUMBLE BEES ARE OFTEN SITE-FAITHFUL, CAUSING ONE PLANT SPECIES TO INCREASE THE POLLINATION OF ANOTHER EVEN WHEN SEPARATED IN TIME, WHICH IS A NOVEL MECHANISM OF POLLINATION FACILITATION.",ASSOCIATIONAL EFFECTS; BOMBUS; FACILITATION; FLORAL RESOURCE; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; MAGNET SPECIES EFFECT; PHENOLOGY; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION; POLLINATION; RESOURCE DEPLETION; SEQUENTIAL MUTUALISM; SITE FIDELITY,INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER; BUMBLE BEES; RUFOUS HUMMINGBIRDS; COMPETITION; VISITATION; RANUNCULACEAE; HYMENOPTERA; MOVEMENTS; EVOLUTION; RESPONSES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"OGILVIE, JE (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, 25 HARBORD ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 3G5, CANADA.;OGILVIE, JE (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, POB 519, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;OGILVIE, JE (REPRINT AUTHOR), FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.;OGILVIE, JANE E., THOMSON, JAMES D., UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, 25 HARBORD ST, TORONTO, ON M5S 3G5, CANADA.;OGILVIE, JANE E., THOMSON, JAMES D., ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, POB 519, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;OGILVIE, JANE E., FLORIDA STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, TALLAHASSEE, FL 32306 USA.",10.1890/15-0903.1,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA DISCOVERY GRANTNATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA; SIGMA XI GRANT-IN-AID OF RESEARCH AWARD; BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA GRADUATE RESEARCH AWARD,"WE THANK THE RMBL FOR FIELD SUPPORT, ESPECIALLY JENNIE REITHEL AND BILLY BARR; DANIELA BRUCKMAN, GRETEL CLARKE, BRETT HARRIS, ELAINE LUO, AND ZACHARY TEITEL FOR FIELD ASSISTANCE; GIORGIA BARDINI, JEFF CHEN, GRETEL CLARKE, MIMI DRAGULEASA, KAREEM JARRAH, TED KIM, AND KATE VOGEL FOR DATA PROCESSING OR LAB ASSISTANCE; THE FREDERICKSON LAB FOR MICROSCOPE USE; JESSICA FORREST, BEN GILBERT, RANDY MITCHELL, DAVE MOELLER, ALI PARKER, NEAL WILLIAMS, THE INOUYE AND UNDERWOOD LABS, AND ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR MANUSCRIPT COMMENTS; AND NATHAN HASS FOR HELP WITH FIG. 1 DESIGN.

BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: MANY STUDIES ASSUME CLIMATIC FACTORS ARE PARAMOUNT IN DETERMINING SPECIES' DISTRIBUTIONS, HOWEVER, BIOTIC INTERACTIONS MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE. FOR EXAMPLE, POLLINATORS MAY LIMIT SPECIES' RANGES IF FLORAL ABUNDANCE OR FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS IS REDUCED AT RANGE MARGINS, THUS CAUSING LOWER POLLINATOR VISITATION AND REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT. METHODS: TO TEST IF POLLINATORS INFLUENCE THE A LTITUDINA I DISTRIBUTION OF ERYTHRONIUM MONTANUM (LILIACEAE) AT MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, WE ASKED WHETHER (1) SEED PRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES RELIES ON POLLINATORS, (2) SEED PRODUCTION AND POLLEN LIMITATION IS GREATEST AT RANGE LIMITS, AND (3) POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES (EITHER OVERALL OR BY INDIVIDUAL TAXONOMIC GROUPS) REFLECT PATTERNS OF SEED PRODUCTION AND POLLEN LIMITATION. RESULTS: FROM THIS THREE-YEAR STUDY, WE ESTABLISHED THAT THIS PLANT DOES RELY ON POLLINATORS FOR FRUIT SET AND WE FOUND THAT POLLEN LIMITATION TRENDED TOWARD BEING HIGHER AT THE UPPER RANGE LIMIT IN SOME YEARS, BUT NOT CONSISTENTLY YEAR TO YEAR. INSECT VISITATION RATES DID NOT MIRROR SPATIAL PATTERNS OF POLLEN LIMITATION, BUT ANNUALLY VARIABLE POLLINATOR COMPOSITION SUGGESTED DIFFERENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SOME POLLINATOR TAXONOMIC GROUPS (SPECIFICALLY, BUMBLEBEES MAY BE BETTER POLLINATORS THAN SYRPHID FLIES). CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE POLLINATORS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN WILDFLOWER, PLANT -POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS DO NOT OBVIOUSLY DRIVE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES.

THEIR PUTATIVE HYBRID PRODUCED SLIGHTLY LOWER LEVELS OF 2-PHENYLETHANOL COMPARED WITH T. MACROPHYLLA AND FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY SESQUITERPENOIDS ASSOCIATED WITH T. CRINITA. HOWEVER, THE HYBRID PRODUCED HIGHER VOLUMES OF THE MONOTERPENE LINALOOL THAN EITHER PARENT SPECIES. THE FRAGRANCE OF O. LAXUS CONTAINED 2-PHENYLETHANOL BUT LACKED THE SESQUITERPENOIDS. WE ALSO MEASURED PERIANTH AREA AND SYMMETRY AS WELL AS THE LENGTH AND WIDTH OF CONTRASTINGLY PIGMENTED FLORAL CENTRES FOR EACH TAXON. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FLORAL AREA AND SYMMETRY WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE PUTATIVE HYBRID, THE TWO PARENT SPECIES, AND O. LAXUS. IN CONTRAST, THE FLORAL REWARD CENTRE AREA (TUFT OF STAMENS) IN O.

WANG J;KANG M;GAO P;HUANG H,WANG J,CONTEMPORARY POLLEN FLOW AND MATING PATTERNS OF A SUBTROPICAL CANOPY TREE EURYCORYMBUS CAVALERIEI IN A FRAGMENTED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,FOR. ECOL. MANAGE.,"CHINA'S SUBTROPICAL FORESTS HAVE EXPERIENCED SEVERE DEFORESTATION AND MOST NATIVE FORESTS HAVE BEEN FRAGMENTED INTO AN ARCHIPELAGO-LIKE LANDSCAPE. THE GENETIC EFFECT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE LEVEL OF GENE FLOW WITHIN AND AMONG POPULATION FRAGMENTS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, EURYCORYMBUS CAVALERIEI, A CANOPY TREE FOUND THROUGHOUT SUBTROPICAL CHINA, WAS SELECTED AS A REPRESENTATIVE INSECT-POLLINATED PLANT SPECIES TO ASSESS GENETIC CONSEQUENCE OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION. CONTEMPORARY POLLEN DISPERSAL AND MATING PATTERNS WERE ESTIMATED IN TWO PHYSICALLY ISOLATED STANDS OF E. CAVALERIEI WITHIN FRAGMENTED FORESTS USING SIX HIGHLY POLYMORPHIC MICROSATELLITE LOCI. WE FOUND HIGH GENETIC DIVERSITY (H-E=0.670-0.754) IN BOTH ADULTS AND OFFSPRING IN THE FRAGMENTED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, SUGGESTING THAT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DID NOT NECESSARILY ERODE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF E. CAVALERIEI. ALTHOUGH SUBSTANTIAL POLLEN TRAVELLED LESS THAN 100 M, PATERNITY ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF LONG-DISTANCE POLLINATION EVENTS OCCURRED, WITH THE AVERAGE POLLEN DISPERSAL DISTANCE BEING 1107M AND 325M FOR THE TWO STANDS, RESPECTIVELY. EXTENSIVE POLLEN IMMIGRATION (39.3-42.6\%) INDICATED THAT THERE WAS EFFECTIVE GENETIC CONNECTIVITY AMONG E. CAVALERIEI STANDS IN THE FRAGMENTED FORESTS. TWOGENER ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EXPONENTIAL POWER MODEL WAS THE BEST-FITTING DISPERSAL CURVE WITH A FAT-TAILED (B < 1) DISPERSAL FEATURE. THE RESULTS FROM A MULTILOCUS MATING SYSTEM ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT A SMALL AMOUNT OF BIPARENTAL INBREEDING AND SOME CORRELATED MATING EVENTS OCCURRED IN THE FRAGMENTED FORESTS, WHICH WERE SIMILAR TO OUR PARALLEL FINDINGS IN THE CONTINUOUS FORESTS OF E. CAVALERIEI. ESTIMATES OF POLLEN POOL STRUCTURE (PHI(FT)=0.128-0.174) INDICATED LARGE GENETIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLLEN CLOUDS ACCEPTED BY MATERNAL TREES. THE NUMBER OF EFFECTIVE POLLEN DONORS (N-EP) IN E. CAVALERIEI, ESTIMATED USING BOTH MLTR (N-EP = 4.2-5.3) AND TWOGENER (N-EP =2.9-3.9) MODELS, WAS EQUIVALENT TO THE NUMBER OF EFFECTIVE POLLEN DONORS DETECTED IN CONTINUOUS FORESTS OF E. CAVALERIEI. THE POLLEN DISPERSAL AND MATING PATTERNS DETECTED HERE INDICATED THAT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DID NOT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON POLLEN MOVEMENT IN E. CAVALERIEI, POSSIBLY DUE TO ITS GENERALIST POLLINATION SYSTEM AND THE RESILIENT FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF ITS POLLINATORS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. THE LONG DISTANCES OF POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW BETWEEN PATCHES HIGHLIGHT THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF REMNANT FOREST FRAGMENTS IN MAINTAINING GENETIC CONNECTIVITY AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE IN SUBTROPICAL CHINA.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT POLLINATORS ON THE RATE OF SEED SET IN THREE SOYBEAN CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILE (CMS) LINES, JLCMS9A, JLCMS82A, AND JLCMS89A. THE FOLLOWING FIVE TREATMENTS WERE APPLIED UNDER NET ROOM ISOLATION-CONDITIONS: (I) INSECTICIDE APPLICATION AND RELEASE OF ALFALFA LEAFCUTTER BEES (MEGA-CHILE ROTUNDATA) DURING FLOWERING, (II) INSECTICIDE APPLICATION IN THE ABSENCE OF LEAFCUTTER BEES, (III) RELEASE OF ALFALFA LEAFCUTTER BEES DURING FLOWERING WITHOUT INSECTICIDE APPLICATION, (IV) THE ABSENCE OF INSECTICIDE OR ALFALFA LEAFCUTTER BEES DURING FLOWERING, (V) PLANTS WITHOUT A NET COVER AND PESTICIDE APPLICATION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE RATE OF POD PRODUCTION AND SEED SET DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN CMS LINES AND BETWEEN TREATMENTS. ALFALFA LEAFCUTTER BEES WERE AN EFFECTIVE POLLINATOR AS EVIDENCED BY INCREASES IN POD-BEARING RATE AND SEED-SET RATE RESPECTIVELY FROM 21.35 TO 53.22\% AND FROM 19.91 TO 58.77\% IN THE THREE CMS LINES. THE THREE CMS LINES ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SEED SET, WITH JLCMS82A EXHIBITING THE HIGHEST RATE IN ALL FIVE TREATMENTS, FOLLOWED BY JLCMS9A AND THEN JLCMS89A. THESE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THRIPS (SERICOTHRIPS VARIABILIS) MIGHT HAVE SOME EFFECT ON SOYBEAN POLLINATION, BUT DID NOT ELICIT A MAJOR INFLUENCE BASED ON THE LOW INCREASES IN SEED PRODUCTION.

FLOWER VISITATION BY BEES IS AN IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL PROCESS THAT IS RELATED TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHETHER RESPONSES OF BEE COMMUNITIES TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY CHANGE AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES. WE STUDIED DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWER-VISITING BEES IN RELATION TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, PROVIDED BY COFFEE, IN TRADITIONAL AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS ON A FIELD, SHRUB, AND BRANCH SCALE. ON A FIELD SCALE, MEAN BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB INCREASED WITH DECREASING PROPORTION OF FLOWERING COFFEE SHRUBS PER SITE, SHOWING A DILUTION EFFECT. CONVERSELY, ON SHRUB AND BRANCH SCALES BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB, OR SHRUB PART, INCREASED WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES, SHOWING A CONCENTRATION EFFECT. ADDITIONALLY, BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB WAS HIGHER ON THOSE THAT WERE ONLY PARTLY, RATHER THAN TOTALLY SURROUNDED BY OTHER FLOWERING COFFEE SHRUBS. SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWER-VISITING BEES WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY HIGH RESOURCE AVAILABILITY ON A SHRUB AND A BRANCH SCALE, EXPRESSED BY A HIGH NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES, BUT AT THE FIELD SCALE THE PROPORTION OF FLOWERING SHRUBS PER SITE DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SPECIES RICHNESS. OUR RESULTS SHOW CONTRASTING RESPONSES OF THE COMMUNITY OF FLOWER-VISITING BEES TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, DEPENDING ON THE SPATIAL SCALE CONSIDERED. WE CONCLUDE THAT PATTERNS OF FLOWER-VISITING BEE COMMUNITIES OF ONLY ONE SPATIAL SCALE CAN NOT BE GENERALIZED, SINCE THE NUMBER OF POLLINATORS MAY BE LIMITED ON A FIELD SCALE, BUT NOT ON SMALLER SCALES.",NA,SPECIES-DIVERSITY; TEMPORAL DIMENSIONS; REGIONAL PATTERNS; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; SEED SET; POLLINATION; FOREST; RICHNESS; DENSITY; BIODIVERSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,58,"VEDDELER, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GOTTINGEN, WALDWEG 26, DE-37073 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.;UNIV GOTTINGEN, DE-37073 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.",10.1111/J.0030-1299.2006.14111.X,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,3,594-601,WILEY,112,2006,ISI000234800800012,51,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,32,ECOLOGY,DVEDDELGWDG.DE,005CS,"VEDDELER, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GOTTINGEN, WALDWEG 26, DE-37073 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY",ISI,none,UNIV GOTTINGEN,UNIV GOTTINGEN,NA,"VEDDELER D, 2006, OIKOS","VEDDELER D, 2006, OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jon Koch
LAVERTY TM,LAVERTY TM,COSTS TO FORAGING BUMBLE BEES OF SWITCHING PLANT-SPECIES,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,CAN. J. ZOOL.-REV. CAN. ZOOL.,"MANY POLLINATORS TEND TO MOVE BETWEEN FLOWERS OF THE SAME SPECIES OF PLANT EVEN WHEN FLOWERS OF OTHER SPECIES ARE AVAILABLE. REASONS FOR THIS BEHAVIOUR (KNOWN AS FLOWER CONSTANCY) ARE UNCLEAR. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION (PROPOSED BY DARWIN) IS THAT FLOWER HANDLING METHODS LEARNED ON ONE PLANT SPECIES INTERFERE WITH PREVIOUSLY LEARNED HANDLING METHODS OF OTHER PLANT SPECIES. DARWIN'S HYPOTHESIS WAS TESTED BY MEASURING THE CONSTANCY OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS FERVIDUS) FORAGING IN THE FIELD AND LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF INTERFERENCE (INCREASED HANDLING TIMES AND FLOWER HANDLING ERRORS) WHEN BEES SWITCHED AMONG FOUR SPECIES WITH RELATIVELY SIMPLE FLOWERS (PRUNELLA VULGARIS, TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE, T. HYBRIDUM, AND VICIA CRACCA) AND TWO SPECIES WITH MORE COMPLEX FLOWERS (ACONITUM NAPELLUS AND IMPATIENS CAPENSIS). BEES FORAGING ON SIMPLE FLOWERS SHOWED NO TENDENCY TOWARDS FLOWER CONSTANCY, AND SWITCHING BETWEEN SPECIES DID NOT INCREASE HANDLING TIMES OR HANDLING ERRORS. FORAGERS DISPLAYED STRONG CONSTANCY WHEN VISITING THE SPECIES WITH MORE COMPLEX FLOWERS AND THERE WAS ALSO SOME EVIDENCE OF INCREASED HANDLING TIMES AND ERROR FREQUENCIES FOLLOWING SWITCHES. HOWEVER, THE TIME COSTS OF SWITCHING WERE SMALL (ABOUT 1 S OVER THE FIRST FLOWER VISIT AFTER A SWITCH) AND ARE UNLIKELY TO ACCOUNT FOR FLOWER CONSTANCY BY BUMBLE BEES FORAGING UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS.",NA,FLOWER CONSTANCY; PIERIS-RAPAE; CHOICE; MORPHOLOGY; TIME,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,56,"LAVERTY, TM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT ZOOL,ECOL \& EVOLUT GRP,LONDON N6A 5B7,ON,CANADA.",10.1139/Z94-007,"RESEARCH JOURNALS, MONTREAL RD, OTTAWA ON K1A 0R6, CANADA",NA,NA,NA,0008-4301,1,43-47,NATL RESEARCH COUNCIL CANADA,72,1994,ISIA1994NK85100007,21,ZOOLOGY,41,ZOOLOGY,NA,NK851,"LAVERTY, TM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,DEPT ZOOL,ECOL \& EVOLUT GRP,LONDON N6A 5B7,ON,CANADA",ISI,none,NA,UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO,NA,"LAVERTY TM, 1994, CAN J ZOOL -REV CAN ZOOL","LAVERTY TM, 1994, CAN J ZOOL -REV CAN ZOOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

THE TRIAL CONSISTED OF TWO IDENTICAL STRIPS (9 M X 45 M) ALONG THE FOREST GROUND-LEVEL DISCRETE VEGETATION HAVING HERBACEOUS DIVERSITY. THE DESIGN WAS A `V', TRUNCATED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE ZONE, WITHOUT ANY VEGETATION, BETWEEN THE TWO STRIPS VARIED FROM 4.5 TO 18 M IN WIDTH. A NEST OF M. PANAMICA COLONY WAS PLACED AT 12 M FROM THE TOP OF THE `V'. THREE EQUAL SECTORS (135 M(2)) WERE IDENTIFIED IN EACH STRIP.

THEN, MARKED AND UNMARKED BEES WERE COUNTED ON THE DONOR AND RECIPIENT STRIPS. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE FORAGING AREA IN A GIVEN STRIP IS ABOUT 405 M(2) AND THAT A MEAN PROPORTION OF 3.45\% OF MARKED BEES/TOTAL NUMBER OF BEES IN COLONY WAS RECOVERED IN THE RECIPIENT STRIP.

HUMAN ACTIVITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREST FRAGMENTATION TEND ALSO TO CHANGE THE INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REMNANT PATCHES, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THE CREATION OF GAPS BY SELECTIVE LOGGING. WHILE EDGES AND GAPS CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE COMPARABLE CHANGES IN THE MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE FOREST, THEIR EFFECTS ON FOREST-DWELLING SPECIES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECT OF FOREST EDGES AND ANTHROPOGENIC GAPS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE EPIPHYTIC PLANT (MITRARIA COCCINEA), MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MUTUALISTS (POLLINATORS) AND ANTAGONISTS (FLOWER LARCENISTS). MITRARIA COCCINEA'S FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY HUMMINGBIRDS AND ROBBED BY THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII. EDGES AND GAPS HAD COMPARABLE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON FLOWER PRODUCTION AND FRUIT SET, HOWEVER, NECTAR ROBBING WAS UP TO SEVENFOLD HIGHER IN PATCHES WITH NUMEROUS GAPS AND RESULTED IN LOWER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRUIT SET AND TOTAL FRUIT CROP).

ECOL.,"1. POLLINATOR VISITATION PATTERNS IN RELATION TO VARIATION IN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE MAY BE MODIFIED BOTH QUANTITATIVELY AND QUALITATIVELY BY LOCAL PLANT DENSITY. IN THIS STUDY FOUR MEASURES OF POLLINATOR RESPONSE BY BOMBUS SPP. (PLANT VISITATION RATE, BOUT LENGTH, PROPORTION OF FLOWERS VISITED, FLOWER VISITATION RATE) WERE INVESTIGATED UNDER TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT PLANT DENSITIES IN TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS IN A NATURAL POPULATION OF DIGITALIS PURPUREA L. 2. PLANT VISITATION RATE INCREASED WITH FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE IN BOTH YEARS, AND WAS HIGHER IN DENSE PATCHES COMPARED WITH SPARSE ONES IN 1999. BOUT LENGTHS INCREASED WITH DISPLAY SIZE IN 1999, AND BOUTS WERE LONGER IN SPARSE PATCHES. HOWEVER, THE ACTUAL RATE OF INCREASE WITH DISPLAY SIZE WAS INDEPENDENT OF PLANT DENSITY FOR BOTH RESPONSE MEASURES. 3. THE PROPORTION OF FLOWERS VISITED DECREASED WITH FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE IN BOTH YEARS, AND IN 1999 THE DECLINE WAS FASTER IN HIGH-DENSITY PATCHES. AS A RESULT, THE PROPORTION VISITED WAS HIGHER IN DENSE PATCHES FOR THE SMALLEST DISPLAY SIZES, AND HIGHER IN SPARSE PATCHES FOR LARGER DISPLAY SIZES. 4.

ABE T,ABE T,THREATENED POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN NATIVE FLORA OF THE OGASAWARA (BONIN) ISLANDS,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS VARIOUS ALIEN SPECIES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO THE OGASAWARA ISLANDS (JAPAN). A SURVEY WAS MADE INVESTIGATING WHETHER THE NATIVE POLLINATION SYSTEMS FIT AN `ISLAND SYNDROME' (BIASING THE FLORA TO DIOECY, WITH SUBDUED, INCONSPICUOUS FLOWERS) AND WHETHER ALIEN SPECIES HAVE DISRUPTED THE NATIVE POLLINATION NETWORK. METHODS FLOWER VISITORS AND FLORAL TRAITS WERE DETERMINED IN THE FIELD (12 ISLANDS) AND FROM THE LITERATURE. ASSOCIATIONS AMONG FLORAL TRAITS SUCH AS SEXUAL EXPRESSION, FLOWER COLOUR AND FLOWER SHAPE WERE TESTED. KEY RESULTS AMONG THE 269 NATIVE FLOWERING PLANTS, 74.7\% ARE HERMAPHRODITIC, 13.0\% ARE DIOECIOUS AND 7.1\% ARE MONOECIOUS. CLASSIFICATION BY FLOWER COLOUR REVEALED THAT 36.0\% WERE WHITE, 21.6\% GREEN AND 13.8\% YELLOW. WOODY SPECIES (TREES AND SHRUBS) COMPRISED 36.5\% OF THE FLORA AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DIOECY AND WHITE FLOWERS. SOLITARY, ENDEMIC SMALL BEES WERE THE DOMINANT FLOWER VISITORS AND VISITED 66.7\% OF THE OBSERVED SPECIES ON SATELLITE ISLANDS WHERE THE NATIVE POLLINATION NETWORKS ARE PRESERVED. IN CONTRAST TO THE SITUATION ON THE SATELLITE ISLANDS, INTRODUCED HONEYBEES WERE THE MOST DOMINANT POLLINATOR (VISITING 60.1\% OF OBSERVED SPECIES) ON THE TWO MAIN ISLANDS, CHICHI-JIMA AND HAHA-JIMA, AND HAD SPREAD TO SATELLITE ISLANDS NEAR CHICHI-JIMA ISLAND. CONCLUSIONS THE ISLAND SYNDROME FOR POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN THE OGASAWARA ISLANDS WAS EVIDENT IN A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF DIOECIOUS SPECIES, THE SUBDUED COLOUR OF THE NATIVE FLORA AND SOLITARY FLOWER VISITORS ON SATELLITE ISLANDS. THE SHAPE AND COLOUR ADAPTATIONS OF SEVERAL FLOWERS SUGGESTED NATIVE POLLINATION NICHES FOR LONG-PROBOSCIS MOTHS AND CARPENTER BEES.

ECOL.,"WHAT RULES DETERMINE WHETHER BUMBLE BEES CONTINUE EXPLOITING PLANTS OF THE SPECIES JUST VISITED OR SWITCH TO ANOTHER SPECIES? TO TACKLE THIS QUESTION, WE RECORDED HANDLING TIMES AND FLIGHT TIMES FROM BEES FORAGING IN A NATURAL MEADOW CONTAINING FIVE PLANT SPECIES. INTER- AND INTRA-SPECIFIC PLANT DISTANCES WERE QUANTIFIED. THE BEE-SUBJECTIVE COLORS OF THE FIVE SPECIES WERE DETERMINED, TWO OF THESE SPECIES HAD SIMILAR COLORS AND STRUCTURES, WHILE THREE SPECIES WERE DISTINCT FROM ALL OTHERS. THE FOLLOWING RULES WERE IDENTIFIED: (1) THE DECISION TO SWITCH SPECIES WAS CORRELATED WITH PREVIOUS FLOWER HANDLING TIME, WHICH WE ASSUME IS A FUNCTION OF THE REWARD AMOUNT RECEIVED AT THE FLOWER. AFTER SHORT HANDLING TIMES, THE PROBABILITY OF SWITCHING TO ANOTHER SPECIES INCREASED, WHEREAS IT DECREASED AFTER LONG HANDLING TIMES. THIS DIFFERENCE BECAME EVEN GREATER IF THE BEE BAD HAD A RUN OF SEVERAL SHORT OR SEVERAL LONG HANDLING TIMES. (2) CONSTANT FLIGHTS (THOSE BETWEEN FLOWERS OF THE SAME SPECIES) AND TRANSITION FLIGHTS (THOSE BETWEEN FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT SPECIES) FOLLOWED STEREOTYPED TEMPORAL PATTERNS INDEPENDENT OF THE DISTANCES BETWEEN FLOWERS. CONSTANT FLIGHTS WITHIN FIVE PLANT SPECIES CONSISTENTLY HAD MEDIAN DURATIONS OF ABOUT 2 SECONDS, WHEREAS MEDIAN TRANSITION TIMES BETWEEN SPECIES TOOK 3-6 SECONDS. (3) THIS TEMPORAL RULE BROKE DOWN, HOWEVER, IF THE FLOWERS OF TWO CASE TRANSITION FLIGHTS HAD EQUAL DYNAMICS AS CONSTANT FLIGHTS. (4) BEES SWITCHED MORE FREQUENTLY FROM RARE THAN FROM COMMON SPECIES BUT EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY BETWEEN SIMILAR SPECIES. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE BEES' CHOICES WERE DETERMINED BY A SET OF RULES THAT GUIDED THEM TO STAY WITH THE CURRENT PLANT SPECIES AS LONG AS FLOWERS WERE REWARDING AND AVAILABLE WITHIN CLOSE DISTANCE BUT TO SWITCH TO ANOTHER SPECIES IF FLOWERS OFFERED LOW REWARDS ENCOUNTERED AT CLOSE RANGE.",BUMBLE BEES; BOMBUS; FLOWER COLOR; FLOWER CONSTANCY; FORAGING; POLLINATION ECOLOGY; SWITCHING,FLOWER CONSTANCY; DELPHINIUM-NELSONII; COLOR-VISION; POLLINATORS; HONEYBEES; BEHAVIOR; CHOICE; MEMORY; HYMENOPTERA; INSECTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,159,"FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST NEUROBIOL,D-14195 BERLIN,GERMANY.",10.1093/BEHECO/8.3.239,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513",NA,NA,NA,1045-2249,3,239-249,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,8,1997,ISIA1997XB63800002,54,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",117,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",NA,XB638,"FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST NEUROBIOL,D-14195 BERLIN,GERMANY",ISI,none,FREE UNIV BERLIN,FREE UNIV BERLIN,NA,"CHITTKA L, 1997, BEHAV ECOL","CHITTKA L, 1997, BEHAV ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Ana M

OUR GOAL WAS TO ASSESS HOW SUBURBANIZATION AFFECTED PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS IN GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, INCLUDING INTERACTIONS WITH MUTUALISTS (POLLINATION) AND ANTAGONISTS (NECTAR ROBBING AND FLORIVORY). BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS MEASURED IN MULTIPLE REPLICATE SITES, WE THEN DEVELOPED PREDICTIONS FOR HOW THESE DIFFERENCES WOULD AFFECT PATTERNS OF NATURAL SELECTION, AND WE EXPLORED THE PATTERNS USING MEASUREMENTS OF FLORAL AND DEFENSIVE TRAITS IN THE FIELD AND IN A COMMON GARDEN. WE FOUND THAT GELSEMIUM GROWING IN SUBURBAN SITES EXPERIENCED MORE ROBBING AND FLORIVORY AS WELL AS MORE HETEROSPECIFIC BUT NOT CONSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER. FLORAL TRAITS, PARTICULARLY COROLLA LENGTH AND WIDTH, INFLUENCED THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PLANTS TO PARTICULAR INTERACTORS.

FEMALES OF MOST BEES AND WASPS SHOW EXTENSIVE PARENTAL CARE. THUS, THEY ARE IDEAL ORGANISMS TO STUDY THE EXPENDITURE FOR OFFSPRING PRODUCTION AND THE RESULTING COSTS OF REPRODUCTION. WE EXAMINED PARENTAL BEHAVIOUR IN THE SOLITARY BEE OSMIA RUFF (LINNE 1758) (HYMENOPTERA MEGACHILIDAE) BY USE OF A NEW METHOD THAT ALLOWS OBSERVATION OF WITHIN NEST BEHAVIOUR AND QUANTIFICATION OF MOST ASPECTS OF NEST CONSTRUCTION AND PROVISIONING. THE METHOD DOES NOT CAUSE DISTURBANCE OF PROVISIONING FEMALES AND DOES NOT INCREASE IMMATURE MORTALITY. TO CHARACTERISE MATERNAL EXPENDITURE WE RECORDED THE NUMBER OF FORAGING TRIPS AND THE TIME SPENT FOR ONE BROOD CELL, THE DURATION OF SINGLE FORAGING TRIPS TO GATHER PROVISIONS AND LOAM (FOR BROOD CELL PARTITIONS), AND THE AMOUNT OF PROVISIONS AND LOAM GATHERED PER TRIP. WE PREDICTED THAT, DUE TO THE LARGE EXPENDITURE FOR PROVISIONING, FEMALES WOULD LOOSE WEIGHT IN THE COURSE OF THE FLIGHT SEASON. ALTERNATIVELY, A WEIGHT LOSS COULD BE CAUSED BY DECREASING AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND A SHORTAGE OF FOOD RESOURCES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FEMALE O. RUFA LOST MASS TOWARDS THE END OF THE FLIGHT SEASON. THOUGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES HAD SOME EFFECT, THE HIGH EXPENDITURE FOR REPRODUCTION WERE PROBABLY THE MAJOR CAUSE OF THE WEIGHT LOSS. THE WEIGHT LOSS WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE RATE OF BROOD CELL CONSTRUCTION BUT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PRONOUNCED IN SMALLER FEMALES.

ENTOMOL.,"PERENNIAL VETCH (VICIA UNIJUGA) IS A WILD PLANT FOUND IN PARTS OF EAST ASIA AND POTENTIALLY VALUABLE AS A FORAGE SPECIES FOR MORE EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS. INFORMATION ON ITS REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM AND POLLINATION BIOLOGY IS NEEDED FOR PROGRESS IN DOMESTICATION OF THE SPECIES. WE CHARACTERIZED THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM OF PERENNIAL VETCH AS FACULTATIVE XENOGAMY (I.E. IT IS LARGELY CROSS-POLLINATED BY INSECTS BUT IS ALSO SELF-COMPATIBLE AND CAN SELFPOLLINATE). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P > 0.05) IN THE FRUIT SET RATIO BETWEEN INSECT CROSS-POLLINATION AND ARTIFICIAL CROSS-POLLINATION AT THE SEED MATURATION STAGE, BUT NATURAL SELF-POLLINATION WAS INEFFICIENT. IN OUR STUDY CONDUCTED ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU, EIGHT INSECT SPECIES (ESPECIALLY CERTAIN BUMBLE BEES) ARE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL POLLINATORS, AND FOUR OTHER INSECT SPECIES BELONGING TO THE LEPIDOPTERA AND DIPTERA VISITED FLOWERS BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO BE POLLINATORS. THE FLOWER VISITATION RATE OF WILD BUMBLE BEES WAS 1.6-3.3 TIMES HIGHER THAN DOMESTIC HONEYBEES, WITH BOMBUS LEPIDUS HAVING THE HIGHEST VISITATION RATE OF 15.7 FLORETS/MIN. THE DIURNAL FLORET OPENING RHYTHM OF PERENNIAL VETCH WAS SYNCHRONIZED WITH DIURNAL ACTIVITY OF POTENTIAL POLLINATORS. OPTIMAL POLLINATION OF PERENNIAL VETCH WOULD LIKELY BE ACHIEVED USING WILD BEES, AS THEY HAVE BEHAVIOUR CHARACTERISTICS AND FLOWER TRIPPING ABILITY NECESSARY, AND ARE PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS TO BE EFFICIENT POLLINATORS OF THIS CROP. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH SUFFICIENCY OF POLLINATION, THERE REMAINS A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH LOW FRUIT SET WHICH REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION FROM A PLANT BIOLOGY PERSPECTIVE.",ALPINE HABITATS; BREEDING SYSTEM; POD SET; POLLINATION ACTIVITY; VICIA UNIJUGA; WILD BUMBLE BEES,POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; SEED ABORTION; HONEYBEES; POPULATION; DIVERSITY; BEHAVIOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"NAN, ZB (REPRINT AUTHOR), LANZHOU UNIV, COLL PASTORAL AGR SCI \& TECHNOL, POB 61, LANZHOU 730020, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SHEN, Z. -W., NAN, Z. -B., WANG, Y. -R., LANZHOU UNIV, COLL PASTORAL AGR SCI \& TECHNOL, LANZHOU 730020, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MATTHEW, C., MASSEY UNIV, INST AGR \& ENVIRONM PN433, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND.",10.1111/JEN.12217,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA [2007CB108902],"THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM) (2007CB108902).

THIS REWARD IS PRODUCED BY GLANDULAR SURFACES OF SPECIFIC FLORAL WHORLS CALLED ELAIOPHORES. UNLIKE TRICHOME ELAIOPHORES, SUCH AS THOSE OF PLANTAGINACEAE, KRAMERIA SPECIES BEAR LATERAL PETALS MODIFIED INTO EPITHELIAL ELAIOPHORE, CONVERGENTLY SIMILAR TO OIL-SECRETING MALPIGHIACEAE CALYX. KRAMERIACEAE IS AN OIL-OFFERING MONOTYPIC GROUP OF EIGHTEEN SPECIES WITH LITTLE INFORMATION ON THEIR POLLINATION BIOLOGY AND INTERACTIONS WITH OIL-COLLECTING BEES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND DESCRIBE THE FLORAL BIOLOGY OF KRAMERIA TOMENTOSA, A WIDESPREAD SPECIES THAT OCCURS MAINLY IN OPEN VEGETATION HABITATS OF NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL. WE LISTED ITS FLOWER VISITORS, SURVEYED THROUGHOUT FOUR YEARS, AND RECORDED THEIR VISITS BY SEASON. THE POLLINATION TREATMENTS SHOWED THAT K. TOMENTOSA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE, HOWEVER, ITS FLOWERS DEPEND ON POLLINATORS TO SET FRUITS. TWENTY-ONE APIDAE VISITED THE FLOWERS, INCLUDING THE OIL-BEE CENTRIS HYPTIDIS SPECIALIZED ON TRICHOME ELAIOPHORES AND STINGLESS-BEES WHICH FORAGED FOR POLLEN. CENTRIS NITENS AND TRIGONA FULVIVENTRIS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT VISITORS. K. TOMENTOSA FLOWERS RECEIVED RELATIVELY FEW OIL VISITS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND ON SOME DAYS NO FLOWER VISITORS WERE SEEN ON ITS FLOWERS. NEVERTHELESS, THIS DID NOT REFLECT ON A LOW NATURAL FRUIT SET. C. HYPTIDIS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ANGELONIA (PLANTAGINACEAE) TRICHOME ELAIOPHORES MAINLY DUE TO ITS LONG FORELEGS AND THEIR SPECIALIZED OIL-COLLECTING APPARATUS. NONETHELESS, IT EXPLOITED THE K. TOMENTOSA EPITHELIAL ELAIOPHORES IN AN AREA WITH NO PLANTAGINACEAE SPECIES. WE PRESUME THAT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE OIL-COLLECTING APPARATUS AND THE ELAIOPHORE TYPE IS NOT ENOUGH TO PREDICT RELATIONSHIPS IN OIL-SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONCLUDE THAT THE DIVERSITY OF BEE VISITORS SUGGESTS THAT POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MAINTENANCE OF K. TOMENTOSA POLLINATION. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER GMBH.

MUTUALISM THEORY PREDICTS THAT EACH PARTICIPANT SHOULD TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFIT IT RECEIVES FROM ITS PARTNER: PLANTS SHOULD ALLOCATE MORE POLLEN TO POLLINATION, AND POLLINATORS SHOULD COLLECT MORE POLLEN. ACCORDINGLY, PLANT AND POLLINATOR MAY ENGAGE IN A `TUG OF WAR' WITH RESPECT TO POLLEN FROM EACH ANTHER TYPE, RESULTING IN INCOMPLETE DIVISION OF LABOR. HERE, WE EXPLORED THIS IDEA BY CONDUCTING A FULLY FACTORIAL MANIPULATION OF THE AVAILABILITY OF POLLEN IN LONG AND SHORT ANTHERS OF STAMINATE FLOWERS OF SOLANUM HOUSTONII. WE FOUND THE FOLLOWING: (1) BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS) PREFERRED TO SONICATE (COLLECT POLLEN FROM) SHORT ANTHERS OVER LONG ANTHERS, CONSISTENT WITH A ROLE AS FEEDING AND POLLINATING ANTHERS, RESPECTIVELY, (2) BLOCKING SHORT ANTHER PORES ALONE INCREASED SONICATION OF LONG ANTHERS AND RESULTED IN COLLECTION OF POLLEN FROM LONG ANTHERS, (3) BLOCKING LONG ANTHER PORES ALONE DID NOT INFLUENCE SONICATION OF SHORT ANTHERS, (4) THE INCREASE IN SONICATION OF LONG ANTHERS, WHEN SHORT ANTHER PORES ARE BLOCKED, WAS GREATER WHEN POLLEN WAS AVAILABLE IN LONG ANTHERS, (5) DESPITE SHIFTING SONICATION EFFORT TO LONG ANTHERS, BEES DO NOT MOVE THEIR BODIES CLOSER TO LONG ANTHER PORES WHERE POLLEN COULD BE COLLECTED MORE EFFECTIVELY, AND (6) ANALYSIS OF THE GROWTH OF CORBICULAR LOADS OVER TIME SPENT BUZZING INDICATES THAT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF POLLEN ARE COLLECTED FROM LONG ANTHERS AS WELL AS SHORT ANTHERS.

AUGOCHLOROPSIS SP1 WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES AND VISITED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES AT EACH SEASON. IN THE INTERACTION NETWORK, PLANTS WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE WERE DISTINCT BETWEEN THE SEASONS. THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS WAS HIGHER IN THE DRY SEASON COMPARED TO THE WET SEASON AND CONNECTANCE WAS SIMILAR, NESTEDNESS HOWEVER VARIED BETWEEN THE SEASONS. THE COMPOSITION OF PLANT AND BEES SPECIES WAS DISTINCT BETWEEN THE SEASONS, AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM, MAINLY DUE TO THE ALTERATION IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PLANT SPECIES AND THE CHANGE IN THE CHOICE OF THE BEES FOR THE FLORAL RESOURCES BETWEEN THE SEASONS.",FLORAL VISITORS; SEASONALITY; SEMIDECIDUAL FOREST; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS,POLLINATION; AREA; HYMENOPTERA; NETWORKS; APIDAE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; OUTCROPS; DOMAIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"MARQUES, MF (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL NORTE FLUMINENSE, CTR BIOCIENCIAS \& BIOTECNOL, LAB CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS, AVE ALBERTO LAMEGO 2000,PARQUE CALIFORNIA, BR-28013602 CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, RJ, BRAZIL.;MARQUES, M.

BECAUSE AN IMPORTANT CAUSE OF SUCCESSFUL INVASION OF A SPECIES MAY DEPEND ON A POTENTIALLY ADVANTAGEOUS PHENOTYPE, WE STUDIED MORPHOLOGIES RELATED TO FLIGHT PERFORMANCE (FLIGHT MUSCLE RATIO (FMR), WING LOADING (WL), EXCESS POWER INDEX (EPI, WHICH INTEGRATES FMR AND WL) AND WING ASPECT RATIO (AR)) IN THE QUEENS OF THE TWO SPECIES. PREVIOUS EMPIRICAL STUDIES SHOWED THAT GREATER FMR, AR AND EPI, AND LOWER WL INCREASE FLIGHT-PERFORMANCE. IN THE PATAGONIAN CHILEAN FJORD WHERE THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT, B. DAHLBOMII WAS 40\% HEAVIER THAN B. TERRESTRIS, A DIFFERENCE THEORETICALLY ALLOWING THE QUEENS OF THE NATIVE SPECIES TO TAKE OFF WITH HEAVIER LOADS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE TWO SPECIES HAVE VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL FMRS. HOWEVER, FMR NEGATIVELY DEPENDED ON BODY MASS AT THE INTRA-SPECIFIC LEVEL. THE TOTAL WING AREA WAS 35\% GREATER IN B. DAHLBOMII, BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN FOREWING LENGTH WAS ONLY OF 16\%. ONCE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THE EFFECT OF BODY SIZE, WL, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN B. TERRESTRIS. AR INCREASED WITH BODY MASS AND DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN SPECIES. EPI WAS WEAKLY BUT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN B. TERRESTRIS.

DATA WERE RETRIEVED FROM PREVIOUS FIELD STUDIES IN WHICH BOTH METHODOLOGIES WERE EMPLOYED SIMULTANEOUSLY. WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH METHOD IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF SPECIES COLLECTED AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BEE SPECIES THROUGH PAIRED T TEST AND PERMUTATIONAL MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, RESPECTIVELY.

TO ANALYZE SUCH EFFECTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE THREE KEY PLAYERS: LANDSCAPES, POLLINATORS AND A PLANT. WE INVESTIGATED EFFECTS OF FOREST LOSS ON AN INSECT-POLLINATED PLANT THROUGH LANDSCAPES IN FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS TO POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND PLANT POPULATIONS. THEN WE QUESTIONED IF ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES DECREASE AS FOREST LOSS INCREASES, AND THIS IN TURN LEADS TO A DECREASE IN REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF AN INSECT-POLLINATED PLANT. WE MADE A STUDY WITH 12 POPULATIONS OF THE BEE POLLINATED HERB, ERYTHRONIUM AMERICANUM, IN A LANDSCAPE CHARACTERIZED BY SCATTERED FRAGMENTS OF DECIDUOUS FOREST WITHIN INTENSIVELY MANAGED AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. WE ALSO SAMPLED BEES AS THE POTENTIAL POLLINATORS BY PAN TRAPS. WE QUANTIFIED THE STUDY LANDSCAPES USING THE AMOUNT OF FOREST COVER AND THE LENGTH OF FOREST EDGE WITHIN EACH OF THE SIX RADII (250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250 AND 1,500 M). REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL COLLECTED BEES WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO ONLY THE FOREST COVER AT THE RADIUS OF 750 M. WE ALSO FOUND THE POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE SEED SET OF E. AMERICANUM WHEN THE FOREST COVER AT THE SAME RADIUS AND ABUNDANCE OF ALL COLLECTED BEES WERE USED AS THE PREDICTOR VARIABLES.

CONSERV.,"GROWING CONCERN ABOUT WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATOR POPULATIONS HAS LED TO EFFORTS TO CREATE FLORAL HABITAT TO PROMOTE BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURAL LANDS WHERE THEY MAKE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO CROP POLLINATION. THESE ACTIONS ALL REQUIRE PRACTITIONERS TO DETERMINE WHAT MIXTURE OF PLANT SPECIES TO SELECT TO BEST SUPPORT DIVERSE AND FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS. LIKE IN THE SELECTION OF AREAS FOR NATURE RESERVES, PLANT CHOICES MUST BALANCE FUNCTION AGAINST DIFFERENCES IN COST. TO DATE, PLANT MIXES HAVE BEEN COMPILED USING EXPERT OPINION BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES, BUT RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS HAVE CALLED FOR A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO OPTIMIZE MIXTURES. WE APPLIED A DECISION ANALYTIC APPROACH TO SELECT BEST FLOWERING MIXES TO MEET TWO SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES AT THE LEAST COST: MAXIMIZING TOTAL BEE RICHNESS OR MAXIMIZING CROP POLLINATING BEES. THE MODEL IDENTIFIED BEST PLANT MIXES FOR EACH OBJECTIVE ACROSS A RANGE OF BUDGETS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATION IN COSTS AMONG PLANT SPECIES ALLOWED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE MIXES WITH LITTLE LOSS IN ACHIEVING THE TARGET OBJECTIVE. INCLUDING MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES SIMULTANEOUSLY REVEALED THE POWER OF THE APPROACH TO MEET COMPLEX GOALS. THE RESULTING MIX SUPPORTED OVER 96\% OF THE BEE SPECIES FOR BOTH GOALS AT NO DIFFERENCE IN COST.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN HOW EFFECTIVELY WILD POLLINATORS MAINTAIN POLLINATION SERVICES IN SMALL, URBAN GARDENS WITH DIVERSE FLORAL RESOURCES. WE USED A `MOBILE GARDEN' EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, WHEREBY POTTED PLANTS OF CUCUMBER, EGGPLANT, AND PURPLE CONEFLOWER WERE BROUGHT TO 30 RESIDENTIAL YARDS IN CHICAGO, IL, USA, TO ENABLE DIRECT ASSESSMENT OF POLLINATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY WILD POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. WE MEASURED FRUIT AND SEED SET AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF WITHIN-YARD CHARACTERISTICS AND ADJACENT FLORAL RESOURCES ON PLANT POLLINATION. INCREASED POLLINATOR VISITATION AND TAXONOMIC RICHNESS GENERALLY LED TO INCREASES IN FRUIT AND SEED SET FOR ALL FOCAL PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, FRUIT AND SEED SET WERE CORRELATED ACROSS THE THREE SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT POLLINATION SERVICES VARY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN WAYS THAT ARE CONSISTENT AMONG DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES. PLANT SPECIES VARIED IN TERMS OF WHICH POLLINATOR GROUPS PROVIDED THE MOST VISITS AND BENEFIT FOR POLLINATION. CUCUMBER POLLINATION WAS LINKED TO VISITATION BY SMALL SWEAT BEES (LASIOGLOSSUM SPP.), WHEREAS EGGPLANT POLLINATION WAS LINKED TO VISITS BY BUMBLE BEES.

BIOL.,"LANDING IS AN IMPORTANT BUT UNDERSTUDIED BEHAVIOR THAT FLYING ANIMALS MUST PERFORM CONSTANTLY. IN STILL AIR, INSECTS DECELERATE SMOOTHLY PRIOR TO LANDING BY EMPLOYING THE RELATIVELY SIMPLE STRATEGY OF MAINTAINING A CONSTANT RATE OF IMAGE EXPANSION DURING THEIR APPROACH. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER INSECTS EMPLOY THIS STRATEGY WHEN FACED WITH CHALLENGING FLIGHT ENVIRONMENTS. HERE, WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF WIND ON BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS) LANDING ON FLOWERS. WE FIND THAT BEES' APPROACH PATHS TO FLOWERS SHIFT FROM MULTIDIRECTIONAL IN STILL AIR TO UNIDIRECTIONAL IN WIND, REGARDLESS OF FLOWER ORIENTATION. IN ADDITION, BEES LANDING IN A 3.5 M S(-1) HEADWIND DO NOT DECELERATE SMOOTHLY, BUT RATHER MAINTAIN A HIGH FLIGHT SPEED UNTIL CONTACT, RESULTING IN HIGHER PEAK DECELERATIONS UPON IMPACT.

EVOL. BIOL.,"THE MECHANISM OF POLLINATOR ATTRACTION IS PREDICTED TO STRONGLY INFLUENCE BOTH PLANT DIVERSIFICATION AND THE EXTENT OF POLLINATOR SHARING BETWEEN SPECIES. SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS RELY ON MIMICRY OF SPECIES-SPECIFIC SEX PHEROMONES TO ATTRACT THEIR INSECT POLLINATORS. GIVEN THAT SEX PHEROMONES TEND TO BE CONSERVED AMONG RELATED SPECIES, WE PREDICTED THAT IN SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS, (I) POLLINATOR SHARING IS RARE, (II) CLOSELY RELATED ORCHIDS USE CLOSELY RELATED POLLINATORS AND (III) THERE IS STRONG BIAS IN THE WASP LINEAGES EXPLOITED BY ORCHIDS. WE FOCUSED ON SPECIES THAT ARE POLLINATED BY SEXUAL DECEPTION OF THYNNINE WASPS IN THE DISTANTLY RELATED GENERA CALADENIA AND DRAKAEA, INCLUDING NEW FIELD OBSERVATIONS FOR 45 SPECIES OF CALADENIA. SPECIALIZATION WAS EXTREME WITH MOST ORCHIDS USING A SINGLE POLLINATOR SPECIES. UNEXPECTEDLY, SEVEN CASES OF POLLINATOR SHARING WERE FOUND, INCLUDING TWO BETWEEN CALADENIA AND DRAKAEA, WHICH EXHIBIT STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF POLLINATORS USING FOUR NUCLEAR SEQUENCE LOCI DEMONSTRATED THAT ALTHOUGH ORCHIDS WITHIN MAJOR CLADES PRIMARILY USE CLOSELY RELATED POLLINATOR SPECIES, UP TO 17\% OF ORCHIDS WITHIN THESE CLADES ARE POLLINATED BY A MEMBER OF A PHYLOGENETICALLY DISTANT WASP GENUS. FURTHER, COMPARED TO THE TOTAL DIVERSITY OF THYNNINE WASPS WITHIN THE STUDY REGION, ORCHIDS SHOW A STRONG BIAS TOWARDS EXPLOITING CERTAIN GENERA.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HERE, WE REPORT THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL USE OF MICRO RADIO TELEMETRY TO TRACK FLIGHT DISTANCES AND SPACE USE OF BUMBLEBEES. USING GROUND SURVEYS AND CESSNA OVERFLIGHTS IN A CENTRAL EUROPEAN RURAL LANDSCAPE MOSAIC WE OBTAINED MAXIMUM FLIGHT DISTANCES OF 2.5 KM, 1.9 KM AND 1.3 KM FOR BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (WORKERS), BOMBUS RUDERATUS (WORKER), AND BOMBUS HORTORUM (YOUNG QUEENS), RESPECTIVELY. BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS USED LARGE AREAS (0.25-43.53 HA) WITHIN ONE OR A FEW DAYS. HABITAT ANALYSES OF ONE B. HORTORUM QUEEN AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE INDICATED THAT GARDENS WITHIN VILLAGES WERE USED MORE OFTEN THAN EXPECTED FROM HABITAT AVAILABILITY. DETAILED MOVEMENT TRAJECTORIES OF THIS INDIVIDUAL REVEALED THAT PROMINENT LANDSCAPE STRUCTURES (E. G. TREES) AND FLOWER PATCHES WERE REPEATEDLY VISITED. HOWEVER, WE ALSO OBSERVED LONG (I.E. >45 MIN) RESTING PERIODS BETWEEN FLIGHTS (B. HORTORUM) AND DIFFERENCES IN FLOWER-HANDLING BETWEEN BUMBLEBEES WITH AND WITHOUT TRANSMITTERS (B. TERRESTRIS) SUGGESTING THAT THE CURRENT WEIGHT OF TRANSMITTERS (200 MG) MAY STILL IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT ENERGETIC COSTS ON THE INSECTS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SPATIO-TEMPORAL MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLEBEES CAN NOW BE TRACKED WITH TELEMETRY METHODS. OUR MEASURED FLIGHT DISTANCES EXCEED MANY PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF BUMBLEBEE FORAGING RANGES AND SUGGEST THAT TRAVELLING LONG DISTANCES TO FOOD RESOURCES MAY BE COMMON. HOWEVER, EVEN THE SMALLEST CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TRANSMITTERS STILL APPEAR TO COMPROMISE FLOWER HANDLING PERFORMANCE AND CAUSE AN INCREASE IN RESTING BEHAVIOR OF BEES.

APIC. RES.,"A COMMUNITY STUDY OF BEES VISITING FLOWERS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS WAS MADE IN THE SUBTROPICAL ARAUCARIA FOREST REGION OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL. BEES OF 79 SPECIES, REPRESENTING ABOUT 40\% OF THE TAXA OCCURRING AT THE STUDY SITE, WERE COLLECTED ON 19 SPECIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS OF THE FAMILIES MELASTOMATACEAE AND SOLANACEAE. THE MAJORITY OF FLOWER VISITORS WERE ABLE TO BUZZ (SONICATE) TO RELEASE POLLEN. BUZZING IS THOUGHT TO BE THE ONLY MODE OF POLLEN COLLECTION THAT RESULTS IN POLLINATION. NO OLIGOLECTIC BEE-PLANT RELATION BASED ON BUZZ POLLINATION WAS DETECTED. MOST BEES WERE NOT SPECIALIZED TO FORAGE ON PLANTS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS. ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF VISITORS AT SPECIFIC FLOWERS, THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF BUZZ POLLINATORS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED, THESE WERE BUMBLE BEES, STINGLESS BEES OF THE GENUS MELIPONA AND HALICTID BEES. THE POLLEN SOURCES MAINLY EXPLOITED BY THEM DIFFER IN FLOWER STRUCTURE, FLOWERING SYNDROME AND FOREST STRATUM. THEREFORE, THE STRUCTURE OF THE BEE COMMUNITY SEEMS TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE LOCAL VEGETATION. THE EXTENT TO WHICH BEES OF A SPECIES SHOW PREFERENCE FOR PORICIDAL FLOWERS, HOWEVER, IS MORE DEPENDENT ON HABITAT THAN ON PLANT TAXA.

CONSERV.,"MANY BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS) SPECIES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, WHILE A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES REMAIN ABUNDANT. HERE WE EXAMINE WHICH FACTORS RENDER SOME BRITISH BUMBLEBEE SPECIES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE THAN OTHERS. WE PRESENT FORAGE DATA ON WORKERS OF 15 BUMBLEBEE SPECIES GATHERED FROM 172 ONE HOUR SEARCHES CONDUCTED AT SITES IN SOUTHERN UK, THE HEBRICES (WESTERN SCOTLAND) AND IN NEW ZEALAND (TO WHICH UK BUMBLEBEES WERE INTRODUCED). WE ALSO REVIEW DATA ON DISTRIBUTION, PHENOLOGY AND TONGUE LENGTH OF THESE SPECIES. OVERALL, FABACEAE APPEAR TO BE THE MAJOR POLLEN SOURCE FOR MOST BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. IN PARTICULAR, LONG-TONGUED, LATE EMERGING SPECIES SUCH AS BOMBUS RUDERATUS, BOMBUS HUMILIS AND BOMBUS SUBTERRANEUS SPECIALIZE HEAVILY IN GATHERING POLLEN FROM FABACEAE, AND THIS GROUP OF BUMBLEBEE SPECIES HAVE ALL DECLINED. SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO AT THE EDGE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE IN THE UK, WHICH MAY HAVE RENDERED THEM MORE SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE DECLINE OF MANY BUMBLEBEE SPECIES IS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE LARGELY TO THE LOSS OF UNIMPROVED FLOWER-RICH GRASSLANDS, A HABITAT RICH IN FABACEAE. THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES THAT REMAIN ABUNDANT ARE MOSTLY SHORT-TONGUED SPECIES THAT EMERGE EARLY IN THE SEASON AND HAVE LESS SPECIALIZED DIETS: THESE SPECIES ARE VERY COMMON IN SUBURBAN GARDENS WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE BROAD RANGE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. A THIRD GROUP OF BUMBLEBEES ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH ERICACEAE IN MOORLAND AND HEATHLAND HABITATS, AND HAVE PROBABLY ALWAYS HAD RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTIONS. A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES ARE NOT SO EASILY CATEGORISED. BOMBUS SOROEENSIS AND B. RUDERARIUS ARE NOT DIETARY SPECIALISTS, NOR ARE THEY CLOSE TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE, BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY HAVE DECLINED.

FROM AFROMONTANE RAINFORESTS",BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY,BIOL. J. LINNEAN SOC.,"COFFEA ARABICA, THE WILD ANCESTOR OF ALL COMMERCIAL ARABICA COFFEE CULTIVARS WORLDWIDE, IS ENDEMIC TO THE MONTANE RAINFORESTS OF ETHIOPIA. THESE FORESTS, WHICH HARBOUR THE MOST IMPORTANT C. ARABICA GENE POOL, ARE THREATENED BY INCREASING ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE, POTENTIALLY ALTERING THE MATING PATTERNS, POLLEN DISPERSAL AND MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN C. ARABICA UNDERSTOREY POPULATIONS. WE GENOTYPED 376 ADULT COFFEE SHRUBS AND 418 PROGENIES FROM THREE NATURAL UNMANAGED, AND THREE HIGHLY MANAGED COFFEE POPULATIONS, USING 24 MICROSATELLITE MARKERS. MATING SYSTEM ANALYSIS OF C. ARABICA YIELDED AN OVERALL MULTILOCUS OUTCROSSING RATE OF 76\%, WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT C. ARABICA IS A PREDOMINANTLY SELFING SPECIES. IN HIGHLY MANAGED COFFEE POPULATIONS, PATERNITY COULD BE ASSIGNED TO 78\% OF THE PROGENIES, WHEREAS IN THE UNMANAGED NATURAL COFFEE POPULATIONS, ONLY 57\% OF THE PROGENIES COULD BE ASSIGNED TO A FATHER, INDICATING REDUCED LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN DISPERSAL IN MANAGED FORESTS. FURTHERMORE, THE FRACTION OF SELFED PROGENIES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MANAGED (23\%) THAN UNMANAGED (10\%) COFFEE FORESTS. FINALLY, THE LACK OF SPATIAL GENETIC STRUCTURE IN ALL STUDIED POPULATIONS SUGGESTS HIGH SEED DISPERSAL IN UNMANAGED POPULATIONS, AND INTENSE BERRY HARVESTING AND COFFEE PLANTING IN THE MANAGED POPULATIONS. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT IN SITU CONSERVATION OF THE WILD GENE POOL OF C. ARABICA MUST FOCUS ON LIMITING INTENSIFICATION OF COFFEE FOREST MANAGEMENT, AS DECREASED POLLEN DISPERSAL AND INCREASED SELFING IN C.

EISEN K;CASE AL;CARUSO CM,EISEN K,VARIATION IN POLLEN-DISPENSING SCHEDULES OF LOBELIA SIPHILITICA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,INT. J. PLANT SCI.,"PREMISE OF RESEARCH.MANY MECHANISMS HAVE EVOLVED THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN EXPORTED AND THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT RECEIVE THIS POLLEN. ONE SUCH MECHANISM IS POLLEN PRESENTATION, WHERE PLANTS REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN AVAILABLE TO A POLLINATOR DURING A SINGLE VISIT. PRESENTING EITHER A CONSTANT PROPORTION OR AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF AVAILABLE POLLEN SHOULD MAXIMIZE MALE FITNESS IN MOST POLLINATOR ENVIRONMENTS. BUT FOR CONSTANT OR INCREASING POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULES TO EVOLVE, VARIATION IN THESE SCHEDULES MUST HAVE A HERITABLE COMPONENT.METHODOLOGY.WE MEASURED POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULES OF LOBELIA SIPHILITICA BY SIMULATING A SEQUENCE OF 16 BEE VISITS TO FLOWERS PRODUCED BY PROGENY OF 10 OPEN-POLLINATED MATERNAL FAMILIES. A COMPONENT OF THE POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULE (THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AT THE END OF THE VISITATION SEQUENCE) WAS MEASURED FOR PLANTS FROM ALL OF THE FAMILIES. THE COMPLETE POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULE WAS MEASURED FOR PLANTS FROM FOUR OF THE 10 FAMILIES.PIVOTAL RESULTS.LOBELIA SIPHILITICA FLOWERS DISPENSED A MEAN OF 8.76\% 1.37\% OF AVAILABLE POLLEN IN THE FIRST SIMULATED VISIT, WHICH IS LOW RELATIVE TO FLOWERS OF 31 OTHER SPECIES. THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE POLLEN DISPENSED DECLINED ACROSS SIMULATED VISITS. THE REPEATABILITY, WHICH PLACES AN UPPER LIMIT ON THE HERITABILITY, WAS 0.29 FOR THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AFTER THE SIMULATED VISITS.CONCLUSIONS.LOBELIA SIPHILITICA FLOWERS DISPENSED A DECLINING PROPORTION OF THEIR AVAILABLE POLLEN, WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTION THAT CONSTANT OR INCREASING PROPORTIONAL POLLINATION SCHEDULES SHOULD EVOLVE. HOWEVER, THE REPEATABILITY FOR THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AFTER THE SIMULATED VISITS WAS LOW RELATIVE TO THE HERITABILITY FOR OTHER FLORAL TRAITS IN L.

EVOL.,"DISTANCE AND DISCRETE GEOGRAPHIC BARRIERS PLAY A ROLE IN ISOLATING POPULATIONS, AS SEED AND POLLEN DISPERSAL BECOME LIMITED. NEARBY POPULATIONS WITHOUT ANY GEOGRAPHIC BARRIER BETWEEN THEM MAY ALSO SUFFER FROM ECOLOGICAL ISOLATION DRIVEN BY HABITAT HETEROGENEITY, WHICH MAY PROMOTE DIVERGENCE BY LOCAL ADAPTATION AND DRIFT. LIKEWISE, ELEVATION GRADIENTS MAY INFLUENCE THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY OF POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE MARGINALLY DISTRIBUTED. BATHYSA AUSTRALIS (RUBIACEAE) IS A WIDESPREAD TREE ALONG THE ELEVATION GRADIENT OF THE SERRA DO MAR, SE BRAZIL. THIS SELF-COMPATIBLE SPECIES IS POLLINATED BY BEES AND WASPS AND HAS AUTOCHORIC SEEDS, SUGGESTING RESTRICTED GENE DISPERSAL. WE INVESTIGATED THE DISTRIBUTION OF GENETIC DIVERSITY IN SIX B.AUSTRALIS POPULATIONS AT TWO EXTREME SITES ALONG AN ELEVATION GRADIENT: A LOWLAND SITE (80-216M) AND AN UPLAND SITE (1010-1100M.A.S.L.). NINE MICROSATELLITE LOCI WERE USED TO TEST FOR GENETIC STRUCTURE AND TO VERIFY DIFFERENCES IN GENETIC DIVERSITY BETWEEN SITES. WE FOUND A MARKED GENETIC STRUCTURE ON A SCALE AS SMALL AS 6KM (F-ST=0.21), AND TWO DISTINCT CLUSTERS WERE IDENTIFIED, EACH CORRESPONDING TO A SITE. ALTHOUGH B.AUSTRALIS IS CONTINUOUSLY DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE ELEVATION GRADIENT, WE HAVE NOT OBSERVED A GENE FLOW BETWEEN THE EXTREME POPULATIONS. THIS MIGHT BE RELATED TO B.AUSTRALIS BIOLOGICAL FEATURES AND CREATES A POTENTIAL SCENARIO FOR ADAPTATION TO THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS IMPOSED BY THE ELEVATION GRADIENT. WE FAILED TO FIND AN ISOLATION-BY-DISTANCE PATTERN, ALTHOUGH ON THE FINE SCALE, ALL POPULATIONS SHOWED SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION UNTIL SIMILAR TO 10-20M. ELEVATION DIFFERENCE WAS A RELEVANT FACTOR THOUGH, BUT WE NEED FURTHER SAMPLING EFFORT TO CHECK ITS CORRELATION WITH GENETIC DISTANCE.

URBAN GARDENS ARE IMPORTANT ANTHROPOGENIC HABITATS BUT IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER, WHEN AND WHY SPILLOVER OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS OCCURS BETWEEN GARDENS AND AGRICULTURAL HABITATS. WE USED TRAP NESTS FOR HYMENOPTERA TO MONTHLY MONITOR BEE AND WASP ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN 12 GARDENS AND 12 RAPESEED FIELDS. HALF OF THE GARDENS AND RAPESEED FIELDS WERE LOCATED IN THE URBAN-RURAL INTERFACE AND BORDERED EACH OTHER (A GARDEN PAIRED WITH A RAPESEED FIELD) AND THE OTHER HALF WERE ISOLATED IN THE RURAL LANDSCAPE (ISOLATED RAPESEED FIELDS) AND IN THE URBAN CITY CENTRE (ISOLATED GARDENS). IN GENERAL, GARDENS IN THE URBAN-RURAL INTERFACE COMPRISED THE HIGHEST RICHNESS OF BEES AND WASPS. THE ABUNDANCE OF BEES BUT NOT OF WASPS WAS HIGHEST IN PAIRED HABITATS AND PEAKED AT FULL RAPESEED BLOOMING, INDICATING THAT MASS-FLOWERING RAPESEED OFFERS FORAGING RESOURCES FOR BEES NESTING IN ADJACENT GARDENS. THUS, BEES NEST AND INCREASE THEIR POPULATIONS IN BOTH AREAS, BENEFITING FROM THE MASS-FLOWERING RESOURCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL HABITAT AS WELL AS THE NESTING RESOURCES FROM GARDENS, SUGGESTING SPILLOVER OF BEES BUT NOT OF WASPS BETWEEN PAIRED GARDENS AND RAPESEED FIELDS. OUR STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE VALUE OF GARDENS IN THE URBAN-RURAL INTERFACE FOR THE BIODIVERSITY OF FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT INSECTS.

THE FLOWER OPENS AT ANY TIME OF THE DAY, AND THE ANTHERS OF OUTER STAMENS DEHISCE AFTER ABOUT ONE DAY AND THOSE OF THE INNER STAMENS AFTER TWO DAYS. THE STIGMATA ON THE SEMICARPOUS (NEARLY APOCARPOUS) PISTIL, WHICH ARE ALREADY RECEPTIVE WHEN THE FLOWER OPENS, ARE SITUATED IN THE CENTER OF THE FLOWER AND MOVE GRADUALLY OUTWARDS TO TOUCH THE ANTHERS OF OUTER STAMENS ABOUT FIVE DAYS AFTER ANTHESIS. THE BREEDING EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT THE STIGMATA ARE RECEPTIVE AT LEAST FOR FIVE DAYS, AND MANY SEEDS ARE PRODUCED THROUGH AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION. THAT MEANS THE NEARLY APOCARPOUS PISTIL, WHICH IS IN A PRIMITIVE CONDITION, IS ADAPTED TO THE AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION. THE SELFING RATE INCLUDING INSECT-MEDIATED SELF-POLLINATION IS VERY HIGH, AND THIS SEXUAL-REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM SEEMS FAVORABLE TO THE SAPROPHYTIC PLANT WHICH IS PROBABLY SEVERELY LIMITED IN ITS RESOURCES.

BUMBLE BEE POLLINATORS VISITED DONOR INDIVIDUALS HOMOZYGOUS FOR MARKER ALLELES AT AN ISOZYME ((GOT-2) ENCODING LOCUS AND THEN WERE PRESENTED WITH ARRAYS OF RECIPIENT PLANTS LACKING THE MARKER ALLELES. FOUR ASPECTS OF MALE FITNESS WERE ESTIMATED FOR EACH DONOR: THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DISPERSED TO FLOWERS OF THE FIRST RECIPIENT VISITED, THE NUMBER OF OFFSPRING SIRED ON THAT RECIPIENT, THE PROPORTION OF OFFSPRING SIRED IN THE FULL ARRAY, AND THE PROPORTION OF MATES IN THE ARRAY BEARING SEEDS OF THE DONOR. POLLEN REMOVAL WAS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY THE NUMBER OF BEE VISITS TO DONOR FLOWERS. THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMOVED IN TURN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS REACHING FLOWERS OF THE FIRST RECIPIENT. HOWEVER, BECAUSE SEED PRODUCTION DECELERATES WITH STIGMA POLLEN LOAD, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLLEN EXPORT AND PATERNAL SUCCESS AT THIS PROXIMATE SCALE SHOWED DIMINISHING RETURNS.

JENNERSTEN O;NILSSON SG,JENNERSTEN O,INSECT FLOWER VISITATION FREQUENCY AND SEED PRODUCTION IN RELATION TO PATCH SIZE OF VISCARIA-VULGARIS (CARYOPHYLLACEAE),OIKOS,OIKOS,"WE EXAMINED FREQUENCY OF POLLINATOR VISITS, SEED SET, AND SEED PREDATION IN RELATION TO PLANT PATCH SIZE OF THE PERENNIAL CARYOPHYLLACEOUS HERB VISCARIA VULGARIS IN TWO AREAS IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN. THE DALSLAND AREA HAD APPROXIMATELY TEN TIMES MORE VISCARIA PLANTS PER UNIT AREA THAN THE SMALAND AREA. LONG-TONGUED BUMBLEBEES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT LEPIDOPTERA WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS IN BOTH AREAS. HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES WITH SHORT PROBOSCIDES WERE MAINLY NECTAR ROBBERS AND/OR POLLEN COLLECTORS. INSECT VISITATION PER VISCARIA PLANT AND PATCH SIZE WERE EITHER UNRELATED OR NEGATIVELY CORRELATED. HOWEVER, BUMBLEBEE VISITATION WAS TWICE AS HIGH IN THE DALSLAND AREA COMPARED TO SMALAND, WHILE NO SUCH DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN LEPIDOPTERA. DESPITE SIMILAR VISITATION RATES AND SIMILAR POTENTIALS FOR SEED SET, NATURAL SEED SET INCREASED WITH PATCH SIZE. THUS, A POLLINATOR MAY, ON AVERAGE, DEPOSIT MORE VISCARIA POLLEN PER FLOWER VISIT IN LARGE PATCHES THAN IN SMALL PATCHES. FRUIT SET, I.E. THE PROPORTION OF FLOWERS SETTING FRUITS, WAS HIGHER DURING WET YEARS THAN DURING DRY YEARS AND DIFFERED WITH PLANT SIZE IN FOUR OUT OF FIVE YEARS, SUGGESTING RESOURCE LIMITATION. FRUIT SET THEREFORE IS NOT A RELIABLE MEASUREMENT OF POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS SPECIES. SEED-FEEDING INSECT LARVAE WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN LARGE PATCHES AND CONSUMED MORE THAN 60\% OF SEED CAPSULES IN THE LARGEST PATCHES. WE CONCLUDE THAT VISCARIA PLANTS IN LARGE PATCHES PRODUCE MORE SEEDS BUT ALSO SUFFER INCREASED RISK OF BEING ATTACKED BY SEED-EATING INSECTS OR INFECTED BY DISEASE.",NA,USTILAGO-VIOLACEA; POLLINATION; DISPERSAL; POLLEN; PLANTS; REPRODUCTION; COMPETITION; BUMBLEBEES; INFECTION; SET,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,96,"UPPSALA UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN.;LUND UNIV,DEPT ECOL,S-22362 LUND,SWEDEN.",10.2307/3544841,"35 NORRE SOGADE, PO BOX 2148, DK-1016 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,2,283-292,MUNKSGAARD INT PUBL LTD,68,1993,ISIA1993MJ66600012,31,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,53,ECOLOGY,NA,MJ666,"UPPSALA UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,S-75236 UPPSALA,SWEDEN",ISI,none,UPPSALA UNIV;LUND UNIV,UPPSALA UNIV,NA,"JENNERSTEN O, 1993, OIKOS","JENNERSTEN O, 1993, OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,Ana M
