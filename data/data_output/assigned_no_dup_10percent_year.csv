STAPF IS A SMALL BUSH WITH A LONG FLOWERING PERIOD IN WINTER. HUNDREDS OF SMALL FLOWERS OPEN AT ONE TIME. ITS BREEDING SYSTEM IS HIGHLY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, WITH AN INDEX OF SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY OF 0 - 0.1. THE SITE OF ARREST OF SELF-INCOMPATIBLE TUBES IS NEAR THE MICROPYLE. IN WILD POPULATIONS THE NATURAL SEED SET VARIES BETWEEN 9 AND 13\%. POLLINATION IS NOT A FACTOR LIMITING SEED SET IN THESE FLOWERS SINCE EVERY STIGMA EXAMINED FROM WILD POPULATIONS CARRIED SOME GERMINATED POLLEN GRAINS. THE LOW LEVEL OF SEED PRODUCTION IS BECAUSE MOST POLLINATIONS ARE PROBABLY INEFFECTIVE SELFS WHICH OCCUR WHEN POLLEN EXUDES FROM PORES IN THE ANTHERS DIRECTLY OVER THE STIGMA, AIR CURRENTS AND RAIN SPLASHING PROBABLY ACCENTUATE THE EFFECT. SELF-POLLINATION IS FACILITATED BY THE LONG PERIOD OF STIGMA RECEPTIVITY WHICH OCCURS FOR 12 DAYS COMMENCING 2 DAYS AFTER ANTHESIS. EACH FLOWER CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 60 000 POLLEN GRAINS THAT ARE VIABLE FOR UP TO 15 DAYS. THE POLLEN-OVULE RATIO IS HIGH, UP TO 32 000. MOST POLLEN IS SHED 3 DAYS AFTER ANTHESIS, BUT THIS DEPENDS ON TEMPERATURE, RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND PROBABLY THE WATER POTENTIAL OF FLOWERS. THE FLOWERS ARE VISITED BY FEW FLYING INSECTS DURING MOST OF THE FLOWERING SEASON. IN WARM WEATHER NEAR THE END OF FLOWERING A WIDE RANGE OF INSECTS VISIT THE FLOWERS.

FOR ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS, RESTRICTING REMOVAL IN FAVOR OF USING ALL AVAILABLE POLLINATORS SHOULD GENERALLY PROMOTE POLLEN DISPERSAL, SO THAT STAMINAL CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD LIMIT POLLEN REMOVAL BY INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE INFLUENCES OF ANTHER POSITION ON POLLEN REMOVAL FROM PONTEDERIA CORDATA, A TRISTYLOUS PLANT WITH ANTHERS AT THREE DISTINCT POSITIONS: EXSERTED FROM THE FLOWER (LONG-LEVEL ANTHERS), AT THE MOUTH OF THE FLARING TUBULAR PERIANTH (MID-LEVEL ANTHERS), AND NEAR THE PERIANTH BASE (SHORT-LEVEL ANTHERS). TO MEASURE POLLEN REMOVAL, WE PRESENTED UNVISITED FLOWERS TO FREELY FORAGING BEES AND COUNTED THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS LEFT IN FLOWERS AFTER 1-4 VISITS. THE POLLINATORS INCLUDED TWO GENERALIST BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS AND B. VAGANS: APIDAE) AND MELISSODES APICATA (ANTHOPHORIDAE), A SPECIALIST WITH MORPHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS FOR COLLECTING POLLEN FROM P. CORDATA. ANALYSIS OF POLLEN REMOVAL INCORPORATED THE EFFECTS OF BEE SPECIES, ANTHER POSITION, POLLEN SIZE, FLOWER LENGTH, AND THE NUMBER AND CUMULATIVE DURATION OF BEE VISITS. ANTHER POSITION AND BEE SPECIES SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED POLLEN REMOVAL, ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEE SPECIES WERE NOT RELATED TO POLLINATOR SPECIALIZATION. LONG-LEVEL ANTHERS DEHISCED EARLY, LOST AN AVERAGE OF 39\% OF THEIR POLLEN DURING THEIR FIRST VISIT, AND DID NOT CONSISTENTLY CONTACT SMALL POLLINATORS, SUCH AS M. APICATA. SHORT-LEVEL ANTHERS RESTRICTED POLLEN REMOVAL MORE (28\% LOST) THAN LONG-LEVEL ANTHERS, BUT DEHISCED MORE SLOWLY AND WERE SUBJECT TO UNPREDICTABLE POLLEN REMOVAL. MID-LEVEL ANTHERS COMBINE THE ADVANTAGES OF MORE EXSERTED AND INSERTED POSITIONS WITHOUT SUFFERING THE CORRESPONDING DISADVANTAGES AS THEY RESTRICTED REMOVAL (24\% LOST), DEHISCED RELATIVELY EARLY, AND SEEMED TO CONSISTENTLY CONTACT ALL POLLINATORS. THE OVERALL BENEFITS OF POSITIONING ANTHERS WITHIN THE PERIANTH MOUTH, THE POSITION OCCUPIED BY MID-LEVEL ANTHERS IN P.

THE FRAGRANCE-COLLECTING ACTIVITY FOLLOWS A DIEL CYCLE THAT MAY BE INFLUENCED BY VARIATION IN THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT. TO ASCERTAIN THE DEGREE OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT ON THE ACTIVITY OF THESE TROPICAL BEES, WE USED EUGLOSSA CARCASSES AS TEMPERATURE SENSORS TO MEASURE OPERATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURES (T(E)) OF BEES IN FOREST OPENINGS (FULL SUNLIGHT) AND IN THE FOREST UNDERSTORY (SHADE). WE RELATED ACTIVITY LEVELS OF BEES ON FRAGRANCE BAITS IN BOTH LOCATIONS TO MEASURED T(E), OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES, AND TIME OF DAY. SHADE T(E) HAD THE STRONGEST (ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANT) DIRECT EFFECT ON EUGLOSSA AND EULAEMA ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE EARLY MORNING. OPERATIVE TEMPERATURE IN THE SUN APPARENTLY HAD NO DIRECT EFFECTS ON ACTIVITY OF BOTH GENERA AT ANY TIME OF DAY. FROM MID-MORNING TO LATE AFTERNOON, ONLY TIME OF DAY (OR AN UNMEASURED VARIABLE CORRELATED WITH IT) HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EUGLOSSA ACTIVITY LEVELS, THE RELATIONSHIP WAS POSITIVE NEAR MIDDAY AND NEGATIVE IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON.

NEERL.,"PHENOLOGY AND INSECT VISITATION OF EARLY FLOWERS OF BARTSIA ALPINA, A PERENNIAL HERB, IN A SUBALPINE POPULATION IN NORTHERN SWEDEN, WERE INVESTIGATED TO FIND CAUSES FOR LOW SEED SET IN EARLY FLOWERS. BUMBLEBEES ARE THE ONLY VISITORS OF B. ALPINA, THEY COLLECT POLLEN AND NECTAR. FLOWER PHENOLOGIES OF SEVERAL BUMBLEBEE VISITED SPECIES AND THEIR NECTAR STANDING CROPS WERE MEASURED. FLOWERING OF BARTSIA STARTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH ASTRAGALUS FRIGIDUS WHILE PEDICULARIS LAPPONICA WAS NEARLY OUT OF FLOWER. EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF BARTSIA RECEIVED FEWER VISITS THAN LATER BLOOMING ONES. THE LARGE VOLUMES OF NECTAR WITH A HIGH SUGAR CONCENTRATION IN EARLY FLOWERS INDICATE THAT BUMBLEBEES NEGLECT OR FAIL TO DISCOVER EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF BARTSIA. EARLY IN THE SEASON SEVEN BUMBLEBEES SPECIES VISITED BARTSIA BUT LATER ON BOMBUS PASCUORUM WAS DOMINANT. THIS SPECIES WAS ALSO AN IMPORTANT VISITOR OF ASTRAGALUS. A RATHER LOW PERCENTAGE OF THE POLLEN LOADS CONTAINED ONLY BARTSIA POLLEN, 27-28\%, DURING EARLY AND PEAK FLOWERING OF BARTSIA. CORBICULAR LOADS OF B. PASCUORUM, THE MOST FREQUENT VISITOR OF BARTSIA, OFTEN CONTAINED BARTSIA BUT ALSO CONTAINED ASTRAGAHUS POLLEN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ERICACEAE POLLEN (PROBABLY OF ANDROMEDA POLIFOLIA). THE LARGE VARIATION IN COMPOSITION OF CORBICULAR LOADS INDICATED THAT BUMBLEBEES WERE NOT FAITHFUL TO BARTSIA ONLY AND THAT SEVERAL PLANT SPECIES WERE VISITED BY THE SAME INDIVIDUALS. BUMBLEBEE VISITATION OF BARTSIA AND PEDICULARIS DURING A SINGLE TRIP MAY RESULT IN HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITION WHICH MAY LOWER SEED SET IN BARTSIA. BUMBLEBEE VISITATION OF BARTSIA AND ASTRAGALUS DURING A SINGLE TRIP MAY NOT RESULT IN HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITION ON BARTSIA FLOWERS DUE TO THE DEPOSITION OF BARTSIA POLLEN ON THE DORSAL AND ASTRAGALUS POLLEN ON THE VENTRAL SIDE OF THE BODY OF BUMBLEBEES. LOW SEED SET OF EARLY BLOOMING FLOWERS OF B. ALPINA WAS PROBABLY DUE TO LOW VISITATION RATES BY BUMBLEBEES. IN ADDITION, SEED SET OF EARLY FLOWERS MAY BE LOW DUE TO HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITIONS BUT THIS ALSO MAY OCCUR LATER IN THE SEASON IF THE COMPOSITION OF CORBICULAR LOADS IS CONSIDERED.

WE CONSIDERED WHETHER THIS SECOND FORM OF COMPETITION MIGHT OCCUR AMONG POLLEN GRAINS OF WILD RADISH IN TWO EXPERIMENTS. IN THE FIRST, INTERFERENCE LIKELY OCCURRED BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN GERMINATION WAS LESS IN MIXED-DONOR THAN IN SINGLE-DONOR POLLINATIONS. THIS RESULT WAS DUPLICATED IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT, WHICH ALSO SHOWED THAT INTERFERENCE OCCURRED ONLY WHEN POLLEN GRAINS FROM DIFFERENT DONORS WERE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER.

THE TWO SPECIES OF FLIES, PROSOECA PERINGUEYI AND P. SP. NO., ARE ACTIVE IN THE LATE WINTER AND SPRING, HAVE LARGE BODIES, MOUTHPARTS 20-50 MM LONG, AND FORAGE FOR NECTAR WHILE HOVERING. PLANTS POLLINATED BY THESE TWO FLIES SHARE A SUITE OF CONVERGENT FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING A STRAIGHT OR SLIGHTLY CURVED FLORAL TUBE AT LEAST 20 MM AND UP TO 70 MM LONG, RELATIVELY SHORT PETALS OR TEPALS COLORED PREDOMINANTLY DARK BLUE- OR RED-PURPLE WITH PALE NECTAR GUIDES, AND ANTHERS AND STIGMAS EXSERTED FROM THE TUBE AND USUALLY UNILATERAL IN ORIENTATION. WITH ONE EXCEPTION, THE FLOWERS OF ALL SPECIES SECRETE LARGE AMOUNTS OF NECTAR OF RELATIVELY CONSTANT TOTAL SUGAR CONCENTRATION, MOSTLY 24-29\%, AND HIGH SUCROSE:HEXOSE RATIO. MOST MEMBERS OF THE GUILD HAVE ODORLESS FLOWERS. THE LONG FLORAL TUBE MAKES NECTAR UNAVAILABLE TO MOST INSECTS.

THE TWO PROSOECA SPECIES HAVE MOUTHPARTS LONG ENOUGH TO FORAGE EFFECTIVELY ON THESE LONG-TUBED FLOWERS, AND THEY ARE ALSO EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS BECAUSE POLLEN ADHERES TO THEIR BODIES AND IS TRANSPORTED FROM FLOWER TO FLOWER. THE FLIES VISIT A WIDE RANGE OF PLANTS BUT ARE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS ONLY OF THOSE WITH TUBE LENGTHS GREATER THAT THEIR PROBOSCIS LENGTHS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FOUR MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE SITES OF POLLEN DEPOSITION ON THE INSECTS' BODIES: WHEN TWO OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE GUILD CO-OCCUR, EACH SPECIES TYPICALLY UTILIZES A DIFFERENT POLLEN DEPOSITION SITE.

LIZARDS ACT AS TRUE POLLINATORS OF THE PLANT, MOVING LARGE QUANTITIES OF POLLEN WITHIN AND AMONG SHRUBS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT POLLINATION BY LIZARDS HAS BEEN EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATED. VARIATION IN THE QUANTITATIVE COMPONENT OF POLLINATION (FREQUENCY OF VISITS X FLOWER VISITATION RATE) BY THE TWO GROUPS OF POLLINATORS (LIZARDS AND INSECTS) IS DOCUMENTED AT BOTH SPATIAL (WITHIN A PLANT POPULATION) AND TEMPORAL SCALES (THROUGHOUT THE FLOWERING SEASON AND BETWEEN SEASONS). VARIATION IN LIZARD DENSITY ON A SMALL SPATIAL SCALE (WITHIN C.:,200 M), PRESUMABLY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN VEGETATION COVER, STRONGLY AFFECTED THEIR FREQUENCY OF FLOWER VISITATION. INSECTS WERE RATHER SCARCE, MAINLY BECAUSE THE PLANT FLOWERS AT A TIME (MID-MARCH) WHEN TEMPERATURES ARE STILL LOW. AT THE SITE WHERE LIZARDS WERE ABUNDANT, THEIR FREQUENCY OF FLOWER VISITS WAS MORE THAN 3 TIMES THAT OF INSECTS, THEY STAYED ON THE SHRUBS ABOUT 3 TIMES LONGER AND VISITED ABOUT 8 TIMES MORE CYATHIA PER MINUTE THAN DID INSECTS. FRUIT AND SEED SET WERE GREATER AT THIS SITE, AND THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIFFERENT FREQUENCY OF FLOWER VISITS BY LIZARDS, AS SHRUBS ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE AND PRODUCE SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF CYATHIA IN THE TWO SITES COMPARED. BOTH, LIZARDS AND INSECTS WENT MORE FREQUENTLY TO PLANTS WITH LARGE FLOWER CROPS. HOWEVER, FLOWER CROP WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SEED VIABILITY.

MALES WITH LARGER FLOWERS THEREFORE, MAY HAVE HIGHER FITNESS NOT BECAUSE POLLEN REMOVAL IS MORE COMPLETE, BUT BECAUSE POLLEN IS REMOVED MORE RAPIDLY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO PREEMPT OVULES. IN FEMALES, POLLEN DEPOSITION INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE 3 DAYS BUT NOT 6 DAYS AFTER FLOWERS OPENED. AT BOTH TIMES, DEPOSITION EXCEEDED OVULE PRODUCTION BY FOUR-FOLD OR MORE, AND FOR 2 YEARS SEED PRODUCTION WAS NOT LIMITED BY POLLEN. FLOWER SIZE HAD NO EFFECT ON SEED PRODUCTION PER PLANT AND WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PERCENT SEED SET, IMPLYING A TRADEOFF BETWEEN ALLOCATION TO ATTRACTION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THIS INDICATES THAT LARGER FLOWER SIZE IN FEMALES IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE FITNESS. IN BOTH SEXES, GAMETE PRODUCTION WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FLOWER SIZE. IN MALES, GREATER POLLEN PRODUCTION WOULD INCREASE THE ADVANTAGE OF LARGE FLOWERS, BUT IN FEMALES MORE OVULES MAY REPRESENT A RESOURCE COST. SELECTION TO INCREASE FLOWER SIZE AND NUMBER IN W.

NECTAR VOLUME AND SUGAR CONCENTRATION WERE STUDIED IN RELATION TO TIME OF DAY, FLOWER SEX, FLOWER AGE, AND FLOWERING STAGE. NECTAR AMOUNT IN ALL SPECIES STUDIED (EXCEPT S. DIOICA) INCREASED IN THE AFTERNOON OR IN THE EVENING UNTIL MIDNIGHT (OR UNTIL THE EARLY MORNING IN S. NUTANS). AFTER MIDNIGHT AND UNTIL MIDDAY, NECTAR VOLUME IN NON-VISITED FLOWERS (EXCEPT S.

DIOICA FLOWERS INCREASED CONSTANTLY WITH FLOWER AGE, INDICATING A STABLE NECTAR SECRETION RATE, POSSIBLY FAVOURING BOTH DAY- AND NIGHT-ACTIVE FLOWER VISITORS. EVEN AT THE TIME OF HIGHEST NECTAR SECRETION, ALL SPECIES STUDIED PRESENTED SEVERAL NECTARLESS FLOWERS. SUCROSE DOMINANCE IN THE NECTAR OF THE NOCTURNAL SPECIES S.

CONDITIONS FAVORING SUCH MUTUALISMS ARE POORLY KNOWN BUT LIKELY INCLUDE PLANTS AND POLLINATORS WHOSE LIFE CYCLES ARE SYNCHRONIZED. IN THIS PAPER, WE DESCRIBE A NEW POLLINATING SEED-CONSUMER MUTUALISM BETWEEN A SONORAN DESERT CACTUS, LOPHOCEREUS SCHOTTII (SENITA CACTUS), AND A PYRALID MOTH, UPIGA VIRESCENS (SENITA MOTH). WE COMPARE THIS MUTUALISM WITH THE YUCCA MUTUALISM IN TERMS OF LIFE HISTORY TRAITS, ACTIVE POLLINATION, AND SELECTIVE ABORTION. SENITA CACTUS FLOWERS WERE POLLINATED NEARLY EXCLUSIVELY BY NOCTURNAL SENITA MOTHS, BUT A FEW HALICTID BEES ALSO POLLINATED FLOWERS. ONLY 40\% OF FLOWERS SET FRUIT DURING THE YEARS OF STUDY, APPARENTLY DUE TO RESOURCE LIMITATION. ALL PHASES OF THE SENITA MOTH'S LIFE HISTORY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SENITA CACTUS. DURING FLOWER VISITATION, FEMALE SENITA MOTHS COLLECTED POLLEN, ACTIVELY POLLINATED FLOWERS, AND OVIPOSITED ONE EGG. AFTER FLOWERS CLOSED, EMERGING LARVAE BORED INTO THE TOPS OF DEVELOPING FRUIT, WHERE THEY CONSUMED SEEDS AND FRUIT TISSUE. HOWEVER, NOT ALL SEEDS/FRUIT WERE CONSUMED BY LARVAE BECAUSE ONLY 20\% OF EGGS PRODUCED LARVAE THAT SURVIVED TO BE SEED/FRUIT CONSUMERS. SENITA CACTUS AND SENITA MOTH INTERACTIONS WERE MUTUALISTIC. MOTHS RECEIVED FOOD RESOURCES (SEEDS, FRUIT) FOR THEIR PROGENY, AND CACTI HAD A 4.8 BENEFIT-TO-COST RATIO, ONLY 21\% OF DEVELOPING FRUIT WERE DESTROYED BY LARVAE. LIFE HISTORY TRAITS IMPORTANT TO THIS MUTUALISM INCLUDED LOW SURVIVAL OF SENITA MOTH EGGS/LARVAE, SEVERAL MOTH GENERATIONS PER FLOWERING SEASON, HOST SPECIFICITY OF SENITA MOTHS, ACTIVE POLLINATION, OVIPOSITION INTO FLOWERS, AND LIMITED SEED/FRUIT CONSUMPTION. ACTIVE POLLINATION BY SENITA MOTHS IN THE PRESENCE OF CO-POLLINATORS SUPPORTS THE PREDICTION THAT ACTIVE POLLINATION CAN EVOLVE DURING A PERIOD OF COEXISTENCE WITH CO-POL LINATORS.

THE FREQUENCY OF VISITS BY A. MANGKAMENSIS TO THIS ORCHID WAS RATHER LOW. POLLINATING BEES NORMALLY SAMPLED ONLY TH, LOWERMOST FLOWERS IN AN INFLORESCENCE, STAYING FOR 1-3 SECONDS. THIS SPECIES IS ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY LOW POLLINATION, LOW FRUIT SET (1-22\%) AND A VERY STRIKING DECREASE IN FRUIT PRODUCTION FROM BOTTOM TO TOP OF THE INFLORESCENCE. ALL OF THESE INDICATE THAT THE ORCHID MAY RELY ON DECEPTION TO ATTRACT VISITORS. AJUGA FORRESTII DIELS (LABIATAE) APPEARS TO BE THE MAIN OR EXCLUSIVE SUBSIDIARY NECTAR SOURCE FOR A.

SARG., THREE NATURAL POPULATIONS IN GUIZHOU, HUNAN AND ZHEJIANG PROVINCES OF CHINA WERE RESPECTIVELY CHOSEN FOR THE FIELD WORK THROUGHOUT THE FLORESCENCE. THE ROLE OF WIND-POLLINATION IN THIS SPECIES COULD BE IGNORED AS THE POLLEN QUANTITY DECREASED RAPIDLY WITH THE INCREASING DISTANCE. IN SPITE OF MORPHOLOGICAL PROTOGYNY, POLLEN VIABILITY AND THE LIFE-SPAN OF RECEPTIVE STIGMAS OVERLAPED MORE THAN 24 H. ANATOMICALLY, ANTHER SAC HAS FOUR LOCULES WITH UNEQUALLY THICKENED ENDOTHECIUM WHICH MAY AFFECT ANTHER TO DEHISCE. THERE WERE MANY SECRETORY CELLS (AND GROUPS OF FLUORESCENT CELLS) AT THE BASE OF PETALS AND STYLES, BUT PAS REACTION INDICATED THAT POLYHEXOSE WAS MOSTLY CONCENTRATED IN THE CELLS AROUND THE VASCULAR BUNDLE OF PETALS. FLUORESCENT CELLS AND FLOWER FRAGRANCE WERE REGARDED AS ATTRACTANTS, NECTAR AND POLLEN AS REWARDS TO VISITORS. THE FLORAL SYNDROME SEEMS TO BE ADAPTIVE TO INSECT POLLINATION. DURING 1994 TO 1996, A TOTAL NUMBER OF THIRTY-NINE SPECIES OF INSECTS INCLUDING BEES, FLIES AND BEETLES WERE RECOGNIZED AS THE FLOWER VISITORS. AMONG WHICH ONLY FOUR WERE PRESENT IN ALL THE THREE POPULATIONS. THE VISITING FREQUENCY VARIED DISTINCTLY FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES AND AMONG POPULATIONS. WHILE BEES WERE OBSERVED AS THE MOST FREQUENT VISITORS IN THE POPULATION IN GUIZHOU PROVINCE, THEY WERE SUBSTITUTED BY FLIES IN THE OTHER TWO POPULATIONS IN HUNAN AND ZHEJIANG PROVINCE AND BECAME OCCASIONAL VISITORS THEMSELVES. THE BEETLES, DESPITE OF THEIR FREQUENT ACTIVITY IN FLOWERS, PLAYED A MUCH LESS IMPORTANT ROLE IN CROSS-POLLINATION. COMPARING THE MEAN POLLEN NUMBERS DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS PER VISIT, IT WAS FOUND THAT BEES WERE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLIES IN POLLINATION. SEM EXAMINATION OF INSECT BODY ALSO SUPPORTED THIS POINT. MOREOVER, THE VISITING FREQUENCY WAS ALSO OBSERVED TO BE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF FLOWER BLOSSOM. VISITORS PREFERRED TO VISIT THOSE FLOWERS IN EARLY ANTHESIS.

PORTALIS FOLLOW A BET-HEDGING EMERGENCE PATTERN, SUCH THAT ONLY APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE LARVAE PUPATE UNDER OPTIMAL CONDITIONS. SECOND, EMERGENCE IS CONDITION DEPENDENT SUCH THAT LARVAE WITH A LOW AVERAGE BODY WEIGHT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO EMERGE THAN ARE LARVAE WITH A HIGH AVERAGE BODY WEIGHT UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS. FINALLY, LARVAL EMERGENCE IS INDUCED BY EXPOSURE TO HIGH HUMIDITY (RAINFALL). THE PARALLELS BETWEEN BEE LARVAE AND ANGIOSPERM SEEDS IN ARID ENVIRONMENTS ARE STRIKING. IN BOTH CASES THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF BET HEDGING, EMERGENCE (OR GERMINATION) IS DEPENDENT ON LARVAL (OR SEED) CONDITION AND RAINFALL TRIGGERS EMERGENCE (OR GERMINATION).

SCI.,"THE FLOWERS OF HELICTERES ISORA ARE LARGE, BISEXUAL AND ZYGOMORPHIC WITH ROBUST COROLLA. THE ELONGATED STAMINAL COLUMN IS ADNATE TO THE GYNOPHORE AND THE TEN ANTHERS ARE GROUPED AT THE TIP OF THIS COLUMN. THE OVARY WITH A SHORT STYLE ENDING IN A SIMPLE STIGMA PROJECTS BEYOND THE ANTHERS AND STAYS IN AN ERECT POSITION. THE FLOWERS OPEN DAILY AT 0300-0330 H AND ARE VISITED BY BIRDS AND INSECTS DURING DAYTIME. THE FLOWERS CHARACTERISTICALLY CHANGE THEIR COLOUR, BEING BLUISH-GREY ON DAY ONE (D(1)), CHANGING TO LIGHT RED ON DAY TWO (D(2)) AND DARK RED ON DAY THREE (D(3)). BIRDS COLLECT NECTAR MORE FREQUENTLY FROM D(2) AND D(3) FLOWERS. BEES COLLECT NECTAR AND POLLEN MOSTLY FROM D(1) FLOWERS. THE FLOWERS ARE NOT APOMICTIC, BUT COMPATIBLE FOR AUTO-, GEITONO- AND XENOGAMY. THE BEES CERATINA AND TRIGONA MEDIATE AUTOGAMY AND GEITONOGAMY BY REMAINING MOSTLY ON THE SAME FLOWER WHILE PSEUDAPIS AND AMEGILLA PROMOTE XENOGAMY BY THEIR FREQUENT INTER-TREE MOVEMENT. THE BIRDS QUAKER BABBLER ALCIPPE POIOICEPHALA AND INDIAN MYNA ACRIDOTHERES TRISTIS LARGELY PROMOTE XENOGAMY BECAUSE STIGMA RECEPTIVITY CONTINUES UP TO THE SECOND DAY OF FLOWER LIFE. SINCE THE TWO BIRD SPECIES IMPLICATED IN POLLINATION ARE NOT ENTIRELY NECTARIVOROUS, TOTAL DEPENDENCE ON THEM FOR POLLINATION MAY NOT BE AN IDEAL STRATEGY, AND RECEIVING POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES MAY HELP IN THE REPRODUCTION OF H. ISORA. FLORAL DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE RED-VENTED BULBUL, PYCNONOTUS CAFER AND BY THE BLISTER BEETLE AND THE INSECT LARVAE IS DETRIMENTAL TO H. ISORA REPRODUCTION.

J. ECOL.,"IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, LINARIA VULGARIS (COMMON YELLOW TOADFLAX) SUFFERS FROM HIGH RATES OF NECTAR ROBBERY BY BUMBLEBEES. IN A WILD POPULATION OF L. VULGARIS WE FOUND THAT 96 \% OF OPEN FLOWERS WERE ROBBED. FIVE SPECIES OF BUMBLEBEE WERE OBSERVED FORAGING ON THESE FLOWERS, ALTHOUGH SHORT-TONGUED SPECIES (BAMBUS LAPIDARIUS, B. LUCORUM AND B, TERRESTRIS) ROBBED NECTAR WHILST LONGER-TONGUED ONES BEHAVED AS LEGITIMATE POLLINATORS (B. HORTORUM AND B. PASCUORUM). NECTAR REWARDS WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE, ON AVERAGE THERE WAS LESS NECTAR IN ROBBED THAN IN UNROBBED FLOWERS, BUT THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE PROPORTION OF FLOWERS CONTAINING NO NECTAR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOR ROBBED FLOWERS COMPARED WITH UNROBBED FLOWERS. SECONDARY ROBBERS AND LEGITIMATE POLLINATORS HAD SIMILAR HANDLING TIMES ON FLOWERS AND, ASSUMING THEY SELECT FLOWERS AT RANDOM TO FORAGE ON, RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME NECTAR PROFIT PER MINUTE, LARGELY BECAUSE MOST FLOWERS HAD BEEN ROBBED. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF SEEDS IN PODS OF ROBBED FLOWERS AND IN PODS OF FLOWERS THAT WERE ARTIFICIALLY PROTECTED AGAINST ROBBING. HOWEVER, MORE OF THE ROBBED DOWERS SET AT LEAST SOME SEED THAN THE UNROBBED FLOWERS, POSSIBLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION. WE SUGGEST THAT NECTAR ROBBING HAS LITTLE EFFECT ON PLANT FECUNDITY BECAUSE LEGITIMATE FORAGERS ARE PRESENT IN THE POPULATION, AND THAT SEED PREDATION AND SEED ABORTION AFTER FERTILIZATION MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN LIMITING SEED PRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES.

RESEARCHERS FROM VARIOUS FIELDS OF BIOLOGICAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED PHENOMENA WHICH THEY RELATED TO ELECTROSTATIC FORCES. THE THEORY OF ELECTROSTATICALLY MEDIATED POLLEN TRANSFER BETWEEN INSECT POLLINATORS AND THE FLOWERS THEY VISIT IS DESCRIBED, INCLUDING RECENT STUDIES WHICH CONFIRMED THAT THE ACCUMULATED CHARGES ON AIRBORNE HONEY BEES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR NON-CONTACT POLLEN DETACHMENT BY ELECTROSTATIC FORCES (I.E., ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION). THE MOST IMPORTANT MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES IN FLOWER ADAPTIVENESS TO ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION WERE DETERMINED BY MEANS OF TWO THEORETICAL MODELS OF A FLOWER EXPOSED TO AN APPROACHING CHARGED CLOUD OF POLLEN, THEY ARE STYLE LENGTH AND FLOWER OPENING.

INDICATOR PLANTS FOR NESTING SITES OF THE NATIVE LEAFCUTTER BEE MEGACHILE WHEELERI MITCHELL WERE CHARACTERIZED WITHIN A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL DUNES PRESERVE. NESTING WAS RESTRICTED TO THE POA-LATHYRUS PLANT COMMUNITY. SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS WERE DETECTED BETWEEN BEE NESTS AND AIRA PRAECOX L., A. CARYOPHYLLEA L., SOLIDAGO SPATHULATA DC., JUNCUS LESUEURII BOLANDER, AND MOSSES, NEGATIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH CARER OBNUPTA L. BAILEY AND LATHYRUS LITTORALIS (NUTTALL) ENDLICHER. NEST DENSITY AND TOTAL PLANT COVER WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED. NESTS WERE GENERALLY NOT CONSTRUCTED NEAR THE BEE'S HOST PLANTS. MOST NESTING OCCURRED IN A ZONE TRANSITIONAL BETWEEN MESIC LOWLANDS AND XERIC HIGHER ELEVATIONS. NATURAL SUCCESSIONAL CHANGE WAS INCREASING NESTING HABITAT, BUT CLIMAX SHORE PINE-SPRUCE FOREST SHOULD EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE NESTING HABITAT IN THE LONG TERM IF SUCCESSION IS NOT DISTURBED. THE INTRODUCED PLANTS LUPINUS ARBOREUS SIMS AND AMMOPHILA ARENARIA L. MAY ELIMINATE NEST HABITAT, BUT AIRA PRAECOX L. AND A. CARYOPHYLLEA L. MAY ENHANCE IT.

GOULSON D,GOULSON D,WHY DO POLLINATORS VISIT PROPORTIONALLY FEWER FLOWERS IN LARGE PATCHES?,OIKOS,OIKOS,"POLLINATORS COLLECT RESOURCES THAT ARE PATCHY., SINCE FLOWERS ARE USUALLY AGGREGATED ON SEVERAL SPATIAL SCALES. EMPIRICAL STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THAT POLLINATORS ALMOST INVARIABLY VISIT A SMALLER PROPORTION OF BOWERS AS PATCH SIZE INCREASES. THIS HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY EXPLAINED. HERE I PRESENT DATA ON THE PAYOFF CURVE ACHIEVED BY BUMBLEBEES, BOMBUS LAPIDARIUS, WHEN VISITING PATCHES CONTAINING DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF INFLORESCENCES, AND USE THE MARGINAL VALUE THEOREM TO PREDICT THE OPTIMUM DURATION OF STAY WITHIN PATCHES. THE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT VISITING A DECLINING PROPORTION OF INFLORESCENCES AS PATCH SIZE INCREASES IS AN OPTIMAL STRATEGY, IF WE ASSUME THAT BEES ARE ATTEMPTING TO MAXIMISE THEIR RATE OF REWARD ACQUISITION. I ARGUE THAT THIS OCCURS BECAUSE STARCHING FOR THE REMAINING UNVISITED INFLORESCENCES IS EASIER IN A SMALL PATCH. ON LARGE PATCHES, BEES VISITED MORE INFLORESCENCES PER PATCH THAN PREDICTED (ALTHOUGH STILL VISITING A DECLINING PROPORTION).

THE GRASSLANDS GREATLY DIFFERED IN THE NUMBER OF HONEY BEE COLONIES WITHIN A RADIUS OF 2 KM AND WERE SURROUNDED BY AGRICULTURAL HABITATS. THE NUMBER OF FLOWER-VISITING HONEY BEES ON BOTH POTTED MUSTARD PLANTS AND SMALL GRASSLAND PATCHES DECLINED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST APIARY AND WAS ALMOST ZERO AT A DISTANCE OF 1.5-2.0 KM.

HERE WE EXAMINED THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF A. LYCOCTONUM. WE INVESTIGATED POLLINATOR COMMUNITY AND FREQUENCY IN FOUR POPULATIONS AT TWO ALTITUDES OVER TWO YEARS. WE FOUND THAT FLOWERS WERE MORE OFTEN VISITED AT LOW ELEVATION THAN AT HIGH ELEVATION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FLOWERS LIVED LONGER AT HIGH ELEVATION THAN AT LOW ELEVATION, AND PLANTS AT HIGH ELEVATION HAD MORE FLOWERS THAN AT LOW ELEVATION, THE OVERALL CHANCE OF A PLANT BEING VISITED MAY BE GREATER AT HIGH ELEVATION. BREEDING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT AT LEAST SOME POPULATIONS OF A. LYCOCTONUM WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE AND ALSO WERE NOT COMPLETELY PROTANDROUS. THUS SELFING, ESPECIALLY BY GEITONOGAMOUS POLLEN, WILL BE COMMON IF POLLINATORS OFTEN VISIT SEVERAL BOWERS WITHIN A PLANT, AS WE FOUND TO BE TRUE FOR THE MAIN POLLINATOR (BUMBLEBEES) OF A.

HUSBAND BC;SCHEMSKE DW,HUSBAND BC,ECOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION BETWEEN DIPLOID AND TETRAPLOID CHAMERION ANGUSTIFOLIUM,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1 THEORETICAL MODELS INDICATE THAT COEXISTENCE OF DIPLOID AND POLYPLOID INDIVIDUALS IN SYMPATRIC POPULATIONS IS UNLIKELY WHEN MATING IS RANDOM AMONG CYTOTYPES AND HYBRIDS ARE INVIABLE. HOWEVER, COEXISTENCE MAY BE FACILITATED BY PREZYGOTIC ISOLATING MECHANISMS THAT REDUCE INTERCYTOTYPE MATING AND INCREASE ASSORTATIVE MATING. 2 WE EXAMINED THE ECOLOGICAL FACTORS REGULATING INTERCYTOTYPE MATING IN CHAMERION (FORMERLY EPILOBIUM) ANGUSTIFOLIUM BY MEASURING FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, FLOWERING SYNCHRONY AND INSECT FORAGING PREFERENCES IN A MIXED POPULATION WITHIN A DIPLOID-TETRAPLOID CONTACT ZONE. WE ALSO CALCULATED THE MINIMUM RATE OF BETWEEN-CYTOTYPE MATING FROM ESTIMATES OF THE FREQUENCY OF TRIPLOID OFFSPRING. 3 DIPLOIDS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER AND NARROWER PETALS AS WELL AS SHORTER STYLES THAN TETRAPLOIDS. INFLORESCENCES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY TALLER IN TETRAPLOIDS THAN DIPLOIDS, BUT THE MEAN NUMBER OF OPEN FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE DID NOT DIFFER. DIPLOID AND TETRAPLOID FLOWERING PERIODS OVERLAPPED BY 51\%, WITH DIPLOID STEMS FLOWERING EARLIER. 4 IN A PLOT OF 20 DIPLOID AND 28 TETRAPLOID STEMS THAT WERE FLOWERING SIMULTANEOUSLY, ONLY 26\% OF ALL BEE FLIGHTS WERE BETWEEN FLOWERS ON DIFFERENT STEMS.

THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF FLOWERING ASYNCHRONY AND INSECT FORAGING REDUCED THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERCYTOTYPE MATING FROM 49\% EXPECTED IF MATING IS RANDOM TO ABOUT 2\% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF POLLINATOR FLIGHTS. 5 A COMPUTER SIMULATION INDICATED THAT THE DEFICIENCY OF POLLINATOR FLIGHTS BETWEEN CYTOTYPES WAS DUE LARGELY TO THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF CYTOTYPES AND LIMITED POLLINATOR FLIGHT DISTANCES WITHIN THE OBSERVATION PLOT.

WE ALSO TESTED ITS ABILITY TO POLLINATE FLOWERS ON THE TREE FROM THE DISTAL TO THE PROXIMAL PART OF THE BRANCHES. WE FOUND THAT WHEN INDIVIDUAL BRANCHES WERE POLLINATED, FRUITLET SET WAS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXPECTED DEPOSITION RATE OF POLLEN GRAINS ON THE STIGMA: ELECTROSTATIC + OPEN POLLINATION > NON-ELECTROSTATIC + OPEN POLLINATION > OPEN POLLINATION > ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION > NON-ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION > SPONTANEOUS SELF POLLINATION. FRUIT SET RESULTS SHOWED THE SAME PATTERN BUT WERE NOT AS PRECISE. ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION OF INDIVIDUAL TREES RESULTED IN AN INSIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN POLLEN GERMINABILITY ON THE STIGMA. THE HIGHEST GERMINABILITY WAS ON THE DISTAL PART OF THE BRANCH AND THE LOWEST WAS ON THE PROXIMAL PART OF THE BRANCH, IN ALL POLLINATION TREATMENTS. ELECTROSTATIC POLLINATION INCREASED YIELD AS COMPARED WITH NON-ELECTROSTATIC AND OPEN POLLINATION. NUT WEIGHT, HOWEVER, DECREASED SLIGHTLY WITH INCREASED YIELD.

MONOGR.,"WE STUDIED VARIATION IN FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, FRUIT AND SEED SET, AND THE ABUNDANCE OF THE POLLINATORS OF FOUR SPECIES OF NIGHT-BLOOMING SONORAN DESERT COLUMNAR CACTI FOR UP TO EIGHT YEARS AT ONE SITE IN MEXICO AND ONE YEAR AT ONE SITE IN ARIZONA. WE DETERMINED HOW SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AFFECTS THE EVOLUTION OF GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS. WE CONDUCTED POLLINATOR EXCLUSION AND HAND POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS TO DOCUMENT ANNUAL VARIABILITY IN POLLINATOR RELIABILITY AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER POLLINATION SYSTEMS WERE REDUNDANT (DIFFERENT SPECIES ARE PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY SUBSTITUTABLE) OR COMPLEMENTARY (DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE AN ADDITIVE EFFECT ON FRUIT SET). THE CACTI WE STUDIED INCLUDED THREE SPECIES WITH GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS INVOLVING BATS, BIRDS, AND BEES (CARDON, PACHYCEREUS PRINGLEI, SAGUARO, CARNEGIEA GIGANTEA, AND ORGAN PIPE, STENOCEREUS THURBERI) AND ONE SPECIALIZED MOTH-POLLINATED SPECIES (SENITA, LOPHOCEREUS SCHOTTII). WE PREDICTED THAT THE MIGRATORY LESSER LONG-NOSED BAT, LEPTONYCTERIS CURASOAE, IS A LESS RELIABLE POLLINATOR THAN BIRDS AND BEES, AND THAT CACTI WITH GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS HAVE MORE VARIABLE FLOWERING PHENOLOGIES THAN THE SPECIALIZED SPECIES. ANNUAL TIME OF PEAK FLOWERING AND MEAN SIZE OF FLOWER CROPS WERE RELATIVELY INVARIANT IN SAGUARO AND ORGAN PIPE. TIME OF PEAK FLOWERING IN CARDON VARIED BY AS MUCH AS SIX WEEKS, AND MEAN FLOWER CROP SIZE VARIED THREEFOLD OVER SIX YEARS. IN SENITA, PEAK FLOWERING VARIED BY AS MUCH AS 5-8 WK AMONG YEARS. PEAK NUMBERS OF THE NECTAR BAT L. CURASOAE VARIED AMONG YEARS, AND BAT DENSITY (0.9/HA) WAS AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER THAN THAT OF CACTUS-VISITING BIRDS AT BOTH STUDY SITES. THE ABUNDANCE OF MIGRATORY HUMMINGBIRDS WAS ALSO HIGHLY VARIABLE AMONG YEARS. POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS INDICATED THAT BATS WERE MAJOR POLLINATORS OF CARDON, WHEREAS DIURNAL VISITORS ACCOUNTED FOR MOST FRUIT SET IN SAGUARO (EXCEPT IN 1995 WHEN BATS WERE MOST IMPORTANT) AND ORGAN PIPE AT OUR MEXICAN SITE, HONEYBEES ACCOUNTED FOR 64-87\% OF DIURNAL FRUIT SET IN THESE SPECIES. ANNUAL VARIATION IN THE CONTRIBUTION TO FRUIT SET BY BATS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF DIURNAL POLLINATORS IN SAGUARO AND ORGAN PIPE, BUT NOT IN CARDON. THERE WAS LITTLE GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF NOCTURNAL VS. DIURNAL POLLINATORS IN SAGUARO AND SENITA, BUT BATS WERE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT FOR FRUIT SET IN ORGAN PIPE IN ARIZONA THAN IN MEXICO. WE GENERALLY DETECTED NO EFFECT OF DIFFERENT POLLINATORS ON NUMBER OF SEEDS PER FRUIT IN ANY SPECIES. ANNUAL VARIATION IN FRUIT SET WAS LOWEST IN SAGUARO, THE SPECIES WITH THE MOST DIURNAL POLLINATION SYSTEM, AND HIGHEST IN ORGAN PIPE, THE SPECIES WITH THE MOST GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM. FRUIT SET WAS STRONGLY POLLEN LIMITED ONLY IN FEMALES OF CARDON (A TRIOECIOUS SPECIES) AND IN ORGAN PIPE (AT BOTH SITES). THE ``MISSING POLLINATORS IN BOTH SPECIES ARE LIKELY LEPTONYCTERIS BATS. THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS OF SAGUARO AND CARDON WERE PARTIALLY REDUNDANT, WHEREAS THAT OF ORGAN PIPE WAS COMPLEMENTARY. THE FOUR SPECIES OF CACTUS THAT WE STUDIED OCCUR AT THE NORTHERN GEOGRAPHIC LIMITS OF MEXICAN COLUMNAR CACTI WHERE MANY VERTEBRATE POLLINATORS ARE SEASONAL MIGRANTS. IN THE SONORAN DESERT, VARIATION IN RAINFALL AND SPRING TEMPERATURES AFFECTS TIMING OF FLOWERING AND THE EXTENT OF COMPETITION BETWEEN CACTI FOR POLLINATOR VISITS AND CAUSES THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICULAR POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY LEPTONYETERIS BATS, FOR FRUIT SET TO VARY ANNUALLY. UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS, SELECTION HAS FAVORED GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS (AS SEEN IN ORGAN PIPE) OR SHIFTS FROM RELIANCE PRIMARILY ON NOCTURNAL POLLINATORS (AS SEEN IN CARDON) TO RELIANCE PRIMARILY ON DIURNAL POLLINATORS (AS SEEN IN SAGUARO).

IN THEORY, TEMPORAL SEX RATIO ASSOCIATED WITH DICHOGAMY MAY AFFECT POLLINATION, PROMOTING THE EVOLUTION OF SEXUAL SPECIALIZATION IN PLANTS WHEN POLLINATOR VISITATION DOES NOT LIMIT SEED OUTPUT. ALSTROEMERIA AUREA, A PERENNIAL HERB NATIVE TO THE TEMPERATE FORESTS OF SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA, BEARS STRONGLY PROTANDROUS FLOWERS. OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, I ASSESSED THE INFLUENCE OF SEASONAL CHANGES IN FLOWER SEX RATIO AND POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE ON THE POLLINATION DYNAMICS OF THIS PLANT SPECIES. WORKERS OF BOMBUS DAHLBOMII ACCOUNTED FOR >90\% OF ALL VISITS TO A. AUREA FLOWERS AND WERE THE MOST EFFICIENT POLLINATORS ON A PER-VISIT BASIS. AS THE SEASON PROGRESSED, POLLEN LOADS CARRIED BY BUMBLE BEES DECREASED BY ALMOST ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, AND THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN DEPOSITED PER VISIT DECREASED AS WELL FROM >40 TO <4 POLLEN GRAINS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE FLOWERING SEASON. AS FLOWERING PATCHES BECAME MORE FEMALE, THE NUMBER OF MALE-PHASE FLOWERS VISITED UNINTERRUPTEDLY DURING EACH BUMBLE BEE FORAGING BOUT DECREASED, WHILE THE NUMBER OF SEQUENTIAL VISITS TO FEMALE-PHASE AOWERS INCREASED. A LABORATORY EXPERIMENT OF MANIPULATING DRIED BUMBLE BEES SHOWED THAT THE NUMBER OF MALE- AND FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS VISITED IN UNINTERRUPTED SEQUENCE STRONGLY INFLUENCES THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN DEPOSITED ON A FLOWER'S STIGMA. POLLEN DEPOSITION IN THIS EXPERIMENT CLOSELY MIMICKED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEX RATIO AND THE OBSERVED SEASONAL DECLINE IN PER-VISIT POLLEN DEPOSITION IN THE FIELD. BECAUSE OVERALL RATE OF BUMBLE BEE VISITATION INCREASED MONOTONICALLY OVER THE FLOWERING SEASON, TOTAL POLLEN RECEIPT PER FLOWER ALSO INCREASED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE SEASON. NEVERTHELESS, POLLEN DEPOSITION DECREASED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE SEASON WHEN VISITATION RATES SATURATED POLLEN REMOVAL, AND LOW POLLEN AVAILABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASINGLY FEMALE-BIASED SEX RATIO APPARENTLY BECAME THE LIMITING FACTOR IN POLLEN TRANSFER. DESPITE PRONOUNCED SEASONAL CHANGES IN POLLINATOR AND POLLINATION LEVELS, COMPARISONS OF SEED OUTPUT BETWEEN OPEN- AND HAND-POLLINATED FLOWERS SHOWED NO EVIDENCE THAT SEED PRODUCTION WAS EVER LIMITED BY TOTAL POLLEN RECEIPT. BECAUSE FLOWER SEX RATIO INFLUENCED POLLINATOR VISITATION AND POLLINATION PATTERNS, AND POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY DID NOT LIMIT SEED OUTPUT, PROTANDRY SHOULD FAVOR THE EVOLUTION OF FEMALE AND MALE SPECIALISTS FLOWERING AT THE TAILS OF THE FLOWERING SEASON. NEITHER UNISEXUALITY NOR ANY OTHER FORM OF SEXUAL POLYMORPHISM IS FOUND IN A. AUREA, HOWEVER. LIKEWISE, I FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT PLANTS MIGHT BE COMPENSATING FOR A SEASONAL SHIFT IN SEX RATIO THROUGH DIFFERENTIAL ALLOCATION INTO POLLEN AND OVULE PRODUCTION WITHIN FLOWERS OR TO RELATIVE DURATION OF MALE AND FEMALE SEXUAL PHASES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A SEASONAL SHIFT IN OPERATIONAL SEX RATIO WITHIN A DICHOGAMOUS SPECIES CAN PROFOUNDLY AFFECT POLLINATION WITHOUT NECESSARILY DRIVING THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL POLYMORPHISM.",ALSTROEMERIA AUREA; BUMBLE BEES; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; POLLINATION DYNAMICS; POLLINATION EFFICIENCY; PROTANDRY; SEED OUTPUT; SEX RATIO,ALSTROEMERIA-AUREA ALSTROEMERIACEAE; FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; FLORAL MORPHOLOGY; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION; HERMAPHRODITIC PLANTS; GERANIUM-MACULATUM; SHOOT DEFOLIATION; PISTILLATE PHASES; POLLEN LIMITATION; RAPHANUS-SATIVUS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,61,"AIZEN, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL COMAHUE, LAB ECOTONO, CTR REG BARILOCHE, UNIDAD POSTAL UNIV, RA-8400 SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE, RIO NEGRO, ARGENTINA.;UNIV NACL COMAHUE, LAB ECOTONO, CTR REG BARILOCHE, UNIDAD POSTAL UNIV, RA-8400 SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE, RIO NEGRO, ARGENTINA.",NA,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,1,127-144,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,82,2001,ISI000166488200011,76,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,51,ECOLOGY,NA,393UN,"AIZEN, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL COMAHUE, LAB ECOTONO, CTR REG BARILOCHE, UNIDAD POSTAL UNIV, RA-8400 SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE, RIO NEGRO, ARGENTINA",ISI,none,UNIV NACL COMAHUE,UNIV NACL COMAHUE,NA,"AIZEN MA, 2001, ECOLOGY","AIZEN MA, 2001, ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,John M

THIS INFORMATION IS RELATED TO WHETHER THE EGGS ARE INTRODUCED INTO BROOD CHAMBERS THAT ARE STILL OPEN AND BEING PROVISIONED BY THE HOST FEMALE OR WHETHER THE CHAMBERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN CLOSED BY THE HOST FEMALES. THE LINEAGES, ALL IN THE APIDAE, ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) KELITA (NOMADINAE: BRACHYNOMADINI), (2) ISEPEOLUS AND MELECTOIDES (APINAE: ISEPEOLINI), (3) LEIOPODUS (APINAE: PROTEPEOLINI), (4) RHATHYMUS (APINAE: RHATHYMINI), (5) MESOPLIA AND EPICLOPUS (APINAE: ERICROCIDINI), AND (6) EXAERETE (APINAE: EUGLOSSINI).

ALSO DISCUSSED IS WHETHER THE LARGE NUMBER OF MATURE OOCYTES CARRIED BY CLEPTOPARASITES MIGHT RESULT, IN PART, FROM THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED FOR CHORION DEPOSITION AFTER THE OOCYTES REACH MATURITY. THE TABLE SHOWS NOT ONLY THAT THE MATURE OOCYTES/EGGS OF CLEPTOPARASITIC BEES IN GENERAL TEND TO BE SMALLER THAN THOSE OF SOLITARY BEES, BUT THAT THE MATURE OOCYTES/EGGS OF THOSE CLEPTOPARASITES THAT HIDE THEIR EGGS IN OPEN HOST BROOD CELLS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN THOSE THAT INTRODUCE THEIR EGGS INTO CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY THE HOST.

THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE WINGED MALES, LIKE ERGATOID MALES, REPRESENT MATING COMPETITION. WHY SHOULD ERGATOID MALES TOLERATE THEIR WINGED RIVALS? WE DEVELOPED A MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION. OUR MODEL FOCUSES ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS LIKELY TO INFLUENCE WHETHER ERGATOID MALES ARE TOLERANT OF WINGED MALES: ERGATOID MALE-WINGED MALE RELATEDNESS, NUMBER OF VIRGIN QUEENS, NUMBER OF WINGED MALES, AND THE NUMBER OF EJACULATES A WINGED MALE HAS (WINGED MALES ARE SPERM LIMITED, WHEREAS ERGATOID MALES HAVE LIFELONG SPERMATOGENESIS).

ACACIAS THAT SECRETE NECTAR ATTRACT FAR MORE SPECIES-RICH ASSEMBLAGES OF FLOWER VISITORS, ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE ARE PROBABLY NOT IMPORTANT AS POLLINATORS. MOST ACACIAS IN THE SUBGENUS PHYLLODINEAE HAVE LONG-LIVED PROTOGYNOUS FLOWERS, WITHOUT CLEAR DAILY PATTERNS IN REWARD PROVISION AND VISITATION.

POLLINATORS TYPICALLY VISIT MORE FLOWERS ON PLANTS WITH LARGER FLORAL DISPLAYS, WHICH SHOULD PRESENT SUCH ATTRACTIVE PLANTS WITH SIGNIFICANT POLLEN TRANSPORT LOSSES. 2. MANY-FLOWERED PLANTS WITH HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS MIGHT REDUCE THE COSTS OF ATTRACTIVENESS BY ENCOURAGING FEWER SEQUENTIAL FLOWER VISITS BY POLLINATORS. ONE MECHANISM THAT ACCOMPLISHES THIS IS TO PRODUCE VARIABLE NECTAR REWARDS, WHICH WILL CAUSE RISK-AVERSE FORAGERS TO LEAVE THE PLANT AFTER VISITING FEWER FLOWERS. 3. WE TEST THE PREDICTION THAT WITHIN-PLANT VARIABILITY IN NECTAR PRODUCTION RATE INCREASES WITH THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF OPEN FLOWERS ON A PLANT.

SCI.,"THE DEVELOPMENT OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED (GM) CROPS HAS PRECIPITATED THE NEED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AND REGULATION OF POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW. IN RESPONSE TO THIS NEED WE PRESENT A MATHEMATICAL MODEL TO PREDICT THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUTCROSSING BETWEEN PROGENITOR POPULATIONS OF OILSEED RAPE. THE MODEL COMBINES THE PROCESSES OF POLLEN DISPERSAL AND POLLINATION, RESULTING FROM WIND AND INSECT ACTIVITY. IT INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF POST-POLLINATION REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES BY RELATING THE NUMBER OF PROGENY TO BOTH POLLEN DEPOSITION AND COMPETITION AT THE STIGMA. PREDICTIONS COMPARE WELL WITH A RANGE OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS FOR DIFFERENT-SIZED GM SOURCE CROPS (I.E. 0.0064-0.8 HA) AND NON-GM TARGET CROPS WITH DIFFERENT FERTILITIES (I.E. SELF-FERTILE TO 80\% MALE-STERILE). FOR THESE COMPARISONS, WE REPRESENT THE VARIATION CAUSED BY WIND AND INSECT EXPOSURE AS A CONSTRAINED SET OF RANDOM FUNCTIONS AND LIMIT THE RANGE OF INSECT TRANSPORT TO TYPICAL PLANT-SCALE DISTANCES. IN ADDITION, THE MODEL IS USED TO EXAMINE THE RELATIVE SENSITIVITY TO THE FACTORS THAT DETERMINE GENE FLOW. TARGET-CROP FERTILITY AND SOURCE-CROP SIZE ARE SHOWN TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING BACKGROUND POLLEN AND THE NATURAL RANGE OF INSECT ACTIVITY.

ARNESON LC;TEPEDINO VJ;SMITH SL,ARNESON LC,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH A NATIVE SPECIALIST BEE,NORTHWEST SCIENCE,NORTHWEST SCI.,"BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW, A FIRE-FOLLOWING MALLOW ENDEMIC TO THE MODOC PLATEAU OF NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN OREGON, HAS RECENTLY BEEN DESIGNATED A SENSITIVE SPECIES. MANAGEMENT CONSERVATION DECISIONS FOR SUCH RARE SPECIES ARE STRENGTHENED BY INFORMATION ON NATURAL HISTORY, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PLANT. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO DESCRIBE ASPECTS OF ITS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SEVERAL OCCURRENCES OF DIFFERENT BURN AGE AND SIZE, TO DETERMINE ITS NEED FOR POLLINATORS IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTION, AND TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT FLOWER-VISITORS. REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRUITS/FLOWER, SEEDS/FRUIT) FOR BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS OCCURRENCES, AND WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AGE OR SIZE OF BURN. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FRUITS/FLOWER AND SITE ELEVATION, AND WITH DISTANCE TO NEAREST BURN. THERE WAS NO PHENOLOGICAL PATTERN TO FRUIT OR SEED PRODUCTION, NOR WERE CLUMPED PLANTS MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE FRUITS OR SEEDS THAN ISOLATED PLANTS. FLOWERS DID NOT SET FRUIT OR PRODUCE SEEDS WITHOUT POLLINATOR VISITATION. THE MOST ABUNDANT FLOWER-VISITOR IN MOST OCCURRENCES WAS DIADASIA NITIDIFRONS, A NATIVE SOLITARY BEE THAT VISITS ONLY FLOWERS OF PLANTS IN THE MALLOW FAMILY.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS POLLINATION THROUGH SEXUAL MIMICRY, ALSO KNOWN AS PSEUDOCOPULATION, HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO OCCUR ILL SOME GENERA OF THE NEOTROPICAL ORCHID SUBTRIBE MAXILLARIINAE. HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED SO FAR ONLY FOR TRIGONIDIUM OBTUSUM. THIS STUDY REPORTS AND ILLUSTRATES POLLINATION THROUGH SEXUAL MIMICRY IN MORMOLYCA RINGENS. METHODS A TOTAL OF 70 H WERE DEDICATED TO THE OBSERVATION OF FLOWERS AND POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, WHICH WAS PHOTOGRAPHICALLY RECORDED. FLOWER FEATURES INVOLVED IN POLLINATOR ATTRACTION WERE STUDIED USING A STEREO-MICROSCOPE AND BY SEM ANALYSES. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON THE PLANT BREEDING SYSTEM WERE MADE BY MANUALLY SELF-POLLINATING FLOWERS. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE FRAGRANCE VOLATILES WAS DETERMINED BY GC/MS ANALYSIS. KEY RESULTS THE FLOWER FEATURES OF M. RINGENS PARALLEL THOSE OF OTHER PSUEDOCOPULATORY FLOWERS. THE LABELLUM SHAPE AND INDUMENT ARE REMINISCENT OF ALL INSECT. SEXUALLY EXCITED DRONES OF NANNOTRIGONA TESTACEICORNIS AND SCAPTOTRIGONA SP. (BOTH IN THE APIDAE: MELIPONINI) ATTEMPT COPULATION WITH THE LABELLUM AND POLLINATE THE FLOWER IN THE PROCESS. IN BOTH BEE SPECIES, THE POLLINARIUM IS ATTACHED TO THE SCUTELLUM. POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR MAY PROMOTE SOME DEGREE OF SELF-POLLINATION, BUT PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT M. RINGENS FLOWERS ARE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE. FLOWERS ARE PRODUCED ALL THE YEAR ROUND, WHICH TIES IN WITH THE PRODUCTION OF BEE MALES SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR. THE PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS OF M.

MOST STUDIES USE SEED OR FRUIT PRODUCTION AS AN INDICATION OF PLANT FITNESS, BUT THE IMPACT OF HERBIVORY ON MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IS USUALLY IGNORED. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT PLANTS COMPENSATE FOR RESOURCES LOST TO HERBIVORY BY SHIFTING THE ALLOCATION FROM SEED PRODUCTION TO POLLEN PRODUCTION AND EXPORT, OR VICE VERSA. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF HERBIVORY BY HELIX ASPERSA ON BOTH MALE AND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS OF A MONOECIOUS PLANT, CUCUMIS SATIVUS. THE EFFECTS OF HERBIVORY ON THE RELATIVE ALLOCATION TO MALE AND FEMALE FLOWERS WERE ASSESSED THROUGH MEASUREMENTS OF THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF FLOWERS OF BOTH SEXES, AND THE AMOUNT OF POLLINATOR VISITATION. WE PERFORMED TWO GLASSHOUSE EXPERIMENTS, THE FIRST LOOKED AT THE IMPACT OF THREE LEVELS OF PRE-FLOWERING HERBIVORY, AND THE SECOND LOOKED AT FOUR LEVELS OF HERBIVORY AFTER THE PLANTS HAD STARTED TO FLOWER. WE FOUND THAT HERBIVORY DURING THE FLOWERING PHASE LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PLANTS WITHOUT MALE FLOWERS. AS A CONSEQUENCE THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS POLLEN EXPORT FROM THIS POPULATION, AS ESTIMATED BY MOVEMENT OF A POLLEN ANALOG. THE SIZE OF FEMALE FLOWERS WAS REDUCED BY SEVERE HERBIVORY, BUT THERE WAS NO AFFECT ON POLLEN RECEIPT BY THE FEMALE FLOWERS OF DAMAGED PLANTS.

CONSERV.,"MANY BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS) SPECIES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, WHILE A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES REMAIN ABUNDANT. HERE WE EXAMINE WHICH FACTORS RENDER SOME BRITISH BUMBLEBEE SPECIES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE THAN OTHERS. WE PRESENT FORAGE DATA ON WORKERS OF 15 BUMBLEBEE SPECIES GATHERED FROM 172 ONE HOUR SEARCHES CONDUCTED AT SITES IN SOUTHERN UK, THE HEBRICES (WESTERN SCOTLAND) AND IN NEW ZEALAND (TO WHICH UK BUMBLEBEES WERE INTRODUCED). WE ALSO REVIEW DATA ON DISTRIBUTION, PHENOLOGY AND TONGUE LENGTH OF THESE SPECIES. OVERALL, FABACEAE APPEAR TO BE THE MAJOR POLLEN SOURCE FOR MOST BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. IN PARTICULAR, LONG-TONGUED, LATE EMERGING SPECIES SUCH AS BOMBUS RUDERATUS, BOMBUS HUMILIS AND BOMBUS SUBTERRANEUS SPECIALIZE HEAVILY IN GATHERING POLLEN FROM FABACEAE, AND THIS GROUP OF BUMBLEBEE SPECIES HAVE ALL DECLINED. SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO AT THE EDGE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE IN THE UK, WHICH MAY HAVE RENDERED THEM MORE SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE DECLINE OF MANY BUMBLEBEE SPECIES IS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE LARGELY TO THE LOSS OF UNIMPROVED FLOWER-RICH GRASSLANDS, A HABITAT RICH IN FABACEAE. THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES THAT REMAIN ABUNDANT ARE MOSTLY SHORT-TONGUED SPECIES THAT EMERGE EARLY IN THE SEASON AND HAVE LESS SPECIALIZED DIETS: THESE SPECIES ARE VERY COMMON IN SUBURBAN GARDENS WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE BROAD RANGE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. A THIRD GROUP OF BUMBLEBEES ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH ERICACEAE IN MOORLAND AND HEATHLAND HABITATS, AND HAVE PROBABLY ALWAYS HAD RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTIONS. A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES ARE NOT SO EASILY CATEGORISED. BOMBUS SOROEENSIS AND B. RUDERARIUS ARE NOT DIETARY SPECIALISTS, NOR ARE THEY CLOSE TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE, BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY HAVE DECLINED.

THE ZINGIBERACEAE IS A LARGE FAMILY OF ANIMAL-POLLINATED PANTROPICAL MONOCOTYLEDONS WITH MORE THAN 1500 SPECIES IN CA. 50 GENERA. THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF SEXUAL VARIATIONS OCCURRING IN THE GINGER FAMILY, SUCH AS GYNODIOECY, ANDROMONOECY, FLEXISTYLY, PROTANDRY AND SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY. MAJOR POLLINATORS INCLUDE BEES, HAWKMOTH, BUTTERFLY AND BIRDS, AND DIFFERENT POLLINATORS CORRESPOND WITH DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF FLOWERS. AMONG THE RELATIVELY FEW STUDIES ON THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY, MEMBERS OF THIS FAMILY DISPLAY SOME UNIQUE POLLINATION MECHANISMS AND BREEDING SYSTEMS.

WE ANALYSED THE SCOPAL POLLEN LOADS OF 409 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING 25 OF THE 30 SPECIES OF DIADASIA THAT OCCUR IN NORTH AMERICA. EACH DIADASIA SPECIES SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OF FIVE PLANT FAMILIES. HOWEVER, THE 25 SPECIES VARIED IN THEIR LEVEL OF HOST SPECIFICITY: THE AVERAGE PERCENTAGE BY VOLUME OF THE PREFERRED HOST IN POLLEN LOADS RANGED FROM > 99\% TO < 75\%. IN 17 OF THE 25 SPECIES, ALL OR MOST INDIVIDUALS EXAMINED CONTAINED PURE LOADS OF ONE HOST TAXON, WHILE IN EIGHT SPECIES INDIVIDUALS WERE LESS SPECIALIZED AND CARRIED MIXTURES OF SEVERAL UNRELATED HOST TAXA. MAPPING THESE HOST PREFERENCES ONTO A PHYLOGENETIC TREE INDICATED THAT MALVACEAE IS THE MOST LIKELY ANCESTRAL HOST FOR THE GENUS, AND USE OF OTHER HOSTS CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A SINGLE SWITCH TO EACH OF THE OTHER FOUR HOST-PLANT FAMILIES. THUS, MOST SPECIATION EVENTS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A HOST SWITCH, THIS PATTERN DOES NOT SUPPORT HOST SWITCHING AS A NICHE PARTITIONING STRATEGY TO AVOID COMPETITION.

BOT.,"NUMEROUS AUSTRALIAN TERRESTRIAL ORCHID SPECIES IN THE GENUS DIURIS MAY BE POLLINATED BY FOOD SOURCE MIMICRY. IN OUR FIELD STUDIES, DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF ORCHID-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS WERE RARE, BUT NATIVE BEES WERE FREQUENTLY CAPTURED CARRYING ORCHID POLLINARIA, OR POLLINARIA REMNANTS. SOMETIMES, POLLINARIA REMNANTS WERE MINIMAL AND INCLUDED ONLY THE VISCIDIUM, A STICKY PAD THAT WAS OFTEN HIGHLY PERSISTENT. CONFIRMATION OF SUCH TISSUE AS BEING OF ORCHID SOURCE, AND ATTRIBUTING THEM TO A PARTICULAR SPECIES CAN AID POLLINATION STUDIES. DNA-BASED METHODS THAT MAY IDENTIFY MORE OR LESS INTACT ORCHID POLLINARIA ARE AVAILABLE, BUT EXTREMELY SMALL AND DEGRADED SAMPLES CAN POSE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN AFLP PROTOCOL FOR SUCH DIFFICULT SAMPLES THAT OFFERS SOME SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER DIRECT PCR-BASED ANALYSIS.

SCI.,"RECENT DEVELOPMENTS OF NEW FAMILIES OF PESTICIDES AND GROWING AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WILD POLLINATORS FOR CROP POLLINATION HAVE STIMULATED INTEREST IN POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF NOVEL PESTICIDES ON WILD BEES. YET PESTICIDE TOXICITY STUDIES ON WILD BEES REMAIN RARE, AND FEW STUDIES HAVE INCLUDED LONG-TERM MONITORING OF BUMBLE BEE COLONIES OR TESTING OF FORAGING ABILITY AFTER PESTICIDE EXPOSURE. LARVAL BEES FEEDING ON EXOGENOUS POLLEN AND EXPOSED TO PESTICIDES DURING DEVELOPMENT MAY RESULT IN LETHAL OR SUBLETHAL EFFECTS DURING THE ADULT STAGE. WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF A NATURALLY DERIVED BIOPESTICIDE, SPINOSAD, ON HUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS IMPATIENS CRESSON) COLONY HEALTH, INCLUDING ADULT MORTALITY, BROOD DEVELOPMENT, WEIGHTS OF EMERGING BEES AND FORAGING EFFICIENCY OF ADULTS THAT UNDERWENT LARVAL DEVELOPMENT DURING EXPOSURE TO SPINOSAD. WE MONITORED COLONIES FROM AN EARLY STAGE, OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD, AND FED SPINOSAD TO COLONIES IN POLLEN AT FOUR LEVELS: CONTROL, 0.2, 0.8 AND 8.0 MG KG(-1), DURING WEEKS 2 THROUGH 5 OF THE EXPERIMENT. AT CONCENTRATIONS THAT BEES WOULD LIKELY ENCOUNTER IN POLLEN IN THE WILD (0.2-0.8 MG KG(-1)) WE DETECTED MINIMAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS TO HUMBLE BEE COLONIES. BROOD AND ADULT MORTALITY WAS HIGH AT S. 0 MG KG-1 SPINOSAD, ABOUT TWICE THE LEVEL THAT BEES WOULD BE EXPOSED TO IN A `WORST CASE' FIELD SCENARIO, RESULTING IN COLONY DEATH TWO TO FOUR WEEKS AFTER INITIAL PESTICIDE EXPOSURE. AT MORE REALISTIC CONCENTRATIONS THERE WERE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS. ADULT WORKER BEES EXPOSED TO SPINOSAD DURING LARVAL DEVELOPMENT AT 0.8 MG KG(-1) WERE SLOWER FORAGERS ON ARTIFICIAL COMPLEX FLOWER ARRAYS THAN BEES FROM LOW OR NO SPINOSAD TREATED COLONIES.

LEBANESE ONCOCYCLUS IRISES SHOWED A BIMODAL POLLINATION SYSTEM WITH (1) DIURNAL VISITS AT LOW RATES BUT WITH POTENTIALLY LARGE POLLEN TRANSFERS BY XYLOCOPA BEES, EXHIBITING A FORAGING-LIKE BEHAVIOUR, PRINCIPALLY DURING WARM PERIODS OF THE DAY AND (2) SHELTERING, ESPECIALLY EUCERA MALE BEES, DURING NIGHT AND DAY WHEN THE WEATHER IS CHANGEABLE.

IT ALSO VARIED DEPENDING ON THE EXPOSURE OF FLORAL TUNNELS. VISITATION RATES OF BOTH DAY-VISITING XYLOCOPA AND NIGHT-SHELTERING EUCERA WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE OF THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER CLUMP.

APPL.,"MANY SERVICES GENERATED BY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SUPPORT FOR HUMAN WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE SERVICES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE SUCH AS FOREST FRAGMENTATION ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE PRESENT SPATIAL MODELING OF THE GENERATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE WHERE FOREST HABITAT PATCHES, PROTECTED BY LOCAL TABOOS, ARE LOCATED IN A MATRIX OF CULTIVATED LAND IN SOUTHERN MADAGASCAR. TWO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DEPENDENT ON THE FOREST HABITATS WERE ADDRESSED: (1) CROP POLLINATION SERVICES BY WILD AND SEMIDOMESTICATED BEES (APOIDEA), ESSENTIAL FOR LOCAL CROP PRODUCTION OF, FOR EXAMPLE, BEANS, AND (2) SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA). WE STUDIED THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO A PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO OF SUCCESSIVE DESTRUCTION OF THE SMALLEST HABITAT PATCHES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT, IN SPITE OF THE FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE, THE FRACTION OF THE LANDSCAPE PRESENTLY COVERED BY BOTH CROP POLLINATION AND SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES IS SURPRISINGLY HIGH. IT SEEMS THAT THE TABOO SYSTEM, THOUGH INDIRECTLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY, CONTRIBUTES TO UPHOLDING THE GENERATION OF THESE SERVICES BY PROTECTING THE FOREST PATCHES. BOTH SERVICES ARE, HOWEVER, PREDICTED TO BE VERY VULNERABLE TO THE SUCCESSIVE REMOVAL OF SMALL PATCHES. FOR CROP POLLINATION, THE RATE OF DECREASE IN COVER WAS SIGNIFICANT EVEN WHEN ONLY THE SMALLEST HABITAT PATCHES WERE REMOVED. THE CAPACITY FOR SEED DISPERSAL ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE DISPLAYED SEVERAL THRESHOLDS WITH HABITAT PATCH REMOVAL. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CAPACITY FOR SEED DISPERSAL ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND CROP POLLINATION COVER IN SOUTHERN ANDROY, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE REMAINING FOREST PATCHES IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN THEIR SIZE. WE ARGUE THAT IN HEAVILY FRAGMENTED PRODUCTION LANDSCAPES, SMALL FOREST PATCHES SHOULD INCREASINGLY BE VIEWED AS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AND ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE ONGOING PROCESS OF TRIPLING THE AREA OF PROTECTED HABITATS IN MADAGASCAR.",FOREST FRAGMENTATION; GRAPH; HABITAT LOSS; POLLINATION; SEED DISPERSAL; SMALL HABITATS; SOUTHERN MADAGASCAR,BEZA-MAHAFALY-RESERVE; LEMURS LEMUR-CATTA; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; POLLEN LIMITATION; TROPICAL FOREST; LIFE-HISTORY; NATIVE BEES; SEED SET; CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,134,"BODIN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.",10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0440:TVOSSL]2.0.CO;2,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,1051-0761,2,440-451,WILEY,16,2006,ISI000237052200002,83,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,106,"ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",ORJANSYSTEM.ECOLOGY.SU.SE,036DW,"BODIN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN",ISI,none,STOCKHOLM UNIV,STOCKHOLM UNIV,NA,"BODIN O, 2006, ECOL APPL","BODIN O, 2006, ECOL APPL",NA,NA,NA,NA,John M

DIFFERENCES IN ANTHER-WALL QUALITIES (MULTI-LAYERED AND RIGID V. SINGLE-LAYERED AND FLEXIBLE) WERE CORRELATED WITH SHIFTS BETWEEN VIBRATORY AND PNEUMATIC MECHANISMS. THE SPECIES PRESENTED DIFFERENT EXPLOITATION MECHANISMS FOR BEES TO OBTAIN THEIR POLLEN.

FLOWER VISITATION BY BEES IS AN IMPORTANT ECOLOGICAL PROCESS THAT IS RELATED TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT WHETHER RESPONSES OF BEE COMMUNITIES TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY CHANGE AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES. WE STUDIED DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWER-VISITING BEES IN RELATION TO FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, PROVIDED BY COFFEE, IN TRADITIONAL AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS ON A FIELD, SHRUB, AND BRANCH SCALE. ON A FIELD SCALE, MEAN BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB INCREASED WITH DECREASING PROPORTION OF FLOWERING COFFEE SHRUBS PER SITE, SHOWING A DILUTION EFFECT. CONVERSELY, ON SHRUB AND BRANCH SCALES BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB, OR SHRUB PART, INCREASED WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES, SHOWING A CONCENTRATION EFFECT. ADDITIONALLY, BEE DENSITY PER SHRUB WAS HIGHER ON THOSE THAT WERE ONLY PARTLY, RATHER THAN TOTALLY SURROUNDED BY OTHER FLOWERING COFFEE SHRUBS.

LINNEAN SOC.,"THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF CHANGNIENIA AMOENA, AN ENDANGERED TERRESTRIAL ORCHID, WAS INVESTIGATED AT TWO SITES IN THE SHENNONGJIA MOUNTAINS, HUBEI, CENTRAL CHINA. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ORCHID IS EXCLUSIVELY POLLINATED BY BUMBLEBEES. IN LONGMENHE, BOMBUS (DIVERSOBOMBUS) TRIFASCIATUS IS THE PRIMARY EFFECTIVE POLLINATOR, WHEREAS B. (TRICORNIBOMBUS) IMITATOR IS THE ONLY POLLINATOR IN GUANMENSHAN. THESE TWO BUMBLEBEES CAN BE TREATED AS A FUNCTIONAL GROUP BECAUSE THEY CARRY POLLINARIA ON THE SAME POSITION ON THEIR BODIES AND HAVE SIMILAR POLLINATING BEHAVIOURS. THE MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS OF THE FLOWER ADAPT PRECISELY TO THE POLLINATORS. VISITATION BY BUMBLEBEES IS MAINLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FLOWERING PERIOD OF C. AMOENA. POLLINARIUM REMOVAL AND POLLINIA DEPOSITION TAKE PLACE WHEN BUMBLEBEES WITHDRAW FROM THE FLOWER. CROSSING EXPERIMENTS SHOW THAT C. AMOENA IS A SELF-COMPATIBLE AND OUTCROSSING SPECIES. FRUIT SET IN THIS SPECIES IS LOW AND MAY RESULT FROM LIMITED POLLINATORS BECAUSE 87.5\% OF INDIVIDUALS SET FRUITS UNDER HAND-POLLINATION, BUT ONLY 6-12\% OF INDIVIDUALS SET FRUITS UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSERVE THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY TOGETHER WITH THE PLANTS WHEN CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT FOR THIS ENDANGERED SPECIES IS UNDERTAKEN.

LINNEAN SOC.,"PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE PRESENCE OF A REWARD ON AVERAGE DOUBLES REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN ORCHIDS BY CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASING THE FREQUENCY OF POLLINATOR VISITATIONS. WE EXAMINED WHETHER SUCH REWARD-INDUCED INCREASES HAVE A DOWNSTREAM EFFECT ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF AMBUSH PREDATORS CONCEALED IN ORCHID INFLORESCENCES, EXTENDING OBSERVATIONS BEGUN AT DOWNE BY CHARLES DARWIN. SPECIFICALLY, WE STUDIED THREE ORCHID-RICH SITES IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, IN ORDER TO COMPARE THE OCCURRENCE OF CRAB SPIDERS ON THREE COEXISTING SPECIES OF TERRESTRIAL ORCHIDS: THE NECTARIFEROUS GYMNADENIA CONOPSEA VERSUS THE NECTAR-LESS DACTYLORHIZA FUCHSII AND ANACAMPTIS PYRAMIDALIS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN REWARDING AND NON-REWARDING INFLORESCENCES AT RISBOROUGH, WHEREAS AT ASTON CLINTON THE NECTAR-LESS SPECIES SUPPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CRAB SPIDERS, ALBEIT MAINLY IN RELATIVELY SHORT GRASS. COMPARISON OF THE TWO NON-REWARDING SPECIES PRESENT AT DOWNE APPROXIMATED A SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE BY THE SPIDERS FOR ANACAMPTIS, WHICH MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE REWARDING GYMNADENIA. THE PRESENCE OF A FLORAL REWARD DOES NOT RESULT IN A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF CRAB SPIDERS. WE SPECULATE THAT CONCEALMENT QUALITY OF THE INFLORESCENCE, THE NATURE OF THE DOMINANT POLLINATOR(S), AND/OR EASE OF MOVEMENT OF SPIDERS BETWEEN INFLORESCENCES MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FREQUENCY OF VISITS BY POTENTIAL PREY, PARTICULARLY WHEN NO OTHER FORM OF CONCEALMENT IS READILY AVAILABLE.

ECOL.,"MUTUALISTS AND ANTAGONISTS MAY PLACE CONFLICTING SELECTION PRESSURES ON PLANT TRAITS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL TRAITS IS TYPICALLY STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF ATTRACTING POLLINATORS, BUT TRAITS MAY INCUR FITNESS COSTS IF THEY ARE ALSO ATTRACTIVE TO ANTAGONISTS. STRIPED CUCUMBER BEETLES (ACALYMMA VITTATUM) FEED ON CUCURBITS AND ARE ATTRACTED TO SEVERAL VOLATILES EMITTED BY CUCURBITA BLOSSOMS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF THESE VOLATILES ON POLLINATOR ATTRACTION IS UNKNOWN. OUR GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER POLLINATORS WERE ATTRACTED TO THE SAME OR DIFFERENT FLORAL VOLATILES AS HERBIVOROUS CUCUMBER BEETLES. WE TESTED THREE VOLATILES PREVIOUSLY FOUND TO ATTRACT CUCUMBER BEETLES IN A FACTORIAL DESIGN TO DETERMINE ATTRACTION OF SQUASH BEES (PEPONAPIS PRUINOSA), THE SPECIALIST POLLINATORS OF CUCURBITA SPECIES, AS WELL AS THE SPECIALIST HERBIVORE A. VITTATUM. WE FOUND THAT 1,2,4-TRIMETHOXYBENZENE WAS ATTRACTIVE TO BOTH THE POLLINATOR AND THE HERBIVORE, INDOLE WAS ATTRACTIVE ONLY TO THE HERBIVORE, AND (E)-CINNAMALDEHYDE WAS ATTRACTIVE ONLY TO THE POLLINATOR. THERE WERE NO INTERACTIONS AMONG VOLATILES ON ATTRACTION OF SQUASH BEES OR CUCUMBER BEETLES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REDUCED INDOLE EMISSION COULD BENEFIT PLANTS BY REDUCING HERBIVORE ATTRACTION WITHOUT LOSS OF POLLINATION, AND THAT 1,2,4-TRIMETHOXYBENZENE MIGHT BE UNDER CONFLICTING SELECTION PRESSURE FROM MUTUALISTS AND ANTAGONISTS. BY EXAMINING THE ATTRACTION OF BOTH MUTUALISTS AND ANTAGONISTS TO CUCURBITA FLORAL VOLATILES, WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME COMPOUNDS TO INFLUENCE ONLY ONE TYPE OF INTERACTION, WHILE OTHERS MAY AFFECT BOTH INTERACTIONS AND POSSIBLY RESULT IN TRADEOFFS.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION IS A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS TO OUTCROSS WHILE ENSURING SEED PRODUCTION IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE A NEW MECHANISM OF DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION FACILITATED BY WIND-DRIVEN COROLLA ABSCISSION IN INCARVILLEA SINENSIS VAR. SINENSIS. METHODS FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE PROCESS OF DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION WERE SURVEYED. EXPERIMENTS DEALING WITH POLLINATOR AND WIND EXCLUSION, POLLINATION MANIPULATIONS, AND POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE FIELD. KEY RESULTS DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION OCCURS WHEN THE ABSCISING COROLLA DRIVEN BY WIND DRAGS THE ADHERENT EPIPETALOUS STAMENS, THUS LEADING TO CONTACT OF ANTHERS WITH STIGMA IN LATE ANTHESIS. THERE IS NO DICHOGAMY AND SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN THIS SPECIES. THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF ABSCISED COROLLA UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS AS COMPARED WITH THAT IN WIND-EXCLUDING TENTS INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF WIND IN COROLLA ABSCISSION. WHEN POLLINATORS WERE EXCLUDED, COROLLA ABSCISSION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED ON THE STIGMA AND, AS A RESULT, THE FRUIT AND SEED SET. ONLY HALF OF THE FLOWERS IN PLOTS WERE VISITED BY POLLINATORS, AND THE FRUIT SET OF EMASCULATED FLOWERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF UNTREATED FLOWERS IN OPEN POLLINATION. THIS SPECIES HAS A SENSITIVE STIGMA, AND ITS TWO OPEN STIGMATIC LOBES CLOSED SOON AFTER BEING TOUCHED BY A POLLINATOR, BUT ALWAYS REOPENED IF NO OR ONLY LITTLE POLLEN WAS DEPOSITED. CONCLUSIONS THIS DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION, WHICH INVOLVED THE MOVEMENT OF FLORAL PARTS, THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE WIND AND SENSITIVE STIGMA, IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT REPORTED PREVIOUSLY. THIS MECHANISM PROVIDES REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE FOR THIS SPECIES. THE SENSITIVE STIGMA CONTRIBUTES TO ENSURING SEED PRODUCTION AND REDUCING THE INTERFERENCE OF SELFING WITH OUTCROSSING.

APPL.,"WITHIN MOSAIC LANDSCAPES, MANY ORGANISMS DEPEND ON ATTRIBUTES OF THE ENVIRONMENT THAT OPERATE OVER SCALES RANGING FROM A SINGLE HABITAT PATCH TO THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE. ONE SUCH ATTRIBUTE IS RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION. ORGANISMS' RELIANCE ON RESOURCES FROM WITHIN A LOCAL PATCH VS. THOSE FOUND AMONG HABITATS THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE WILL DEPEND ON LOCAL HABITAT QUALITY, PATCH QUALITY, AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION. THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE AMONG COMPLEMENTARY HABITAT TYPES TO OBTAIN VARIOUS RESOURCES MAY BE A CRITICAL MECHANISM UNDERLYING THE DYNAMICS OF ANIMAL POPULATIONS AND ULTIMATELY THE LEVEL OF BIODIVERSITY AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL SCALES. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS THAT LOCAL HABITAT TYPE AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION HAD ON OFFSPRING PRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL OF THE SOLITARY BEE OSMIA LIGNARIA IN AN AGRI-NATURAL LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA (USA). FEMALE BEES WERE PLACED ON FARMS THAT DID NOT USE PESTICIDES (ORGANIC FARMS), ON FARMS THAT DID USE PESTICIDES (CONVENTIONAL FARMS), OR IN SEMINATURAL RIPARIAN HABITATS. WE IDENTIFIED POLLENS COLLECTED BY BEES NESTING IN DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES AND MATCHED THESE TO POLLENS OF FLOWERING PLANTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE. THESE DATA ENABLED US TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES AND HABITAT TYPES IN PROVIDING FOOD FOR OFFSPRING, AND HOW THIS IMPORTANCE CHANGED WITH LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL NESTING-SITE CHARACTERISTICS. WE FOUND THAT INCREASING ISOLATION FROM NATURAL HABITAT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED OFFSPRING PRODUCTION AND SURVIVAL FOR BEES NESTING AT CONVENTIONAL FARMS, HAD WEAKER EFFECTS ON BEES IN PATCHES OF SEMINATURAL HABITAT, AND HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THOSE AT ORGANIC FARM SITES. POLLEN SAMPLED FROM NESTS SHOWED THAT FEMALES NESTING IN BOTH FARM AND SEMINATURAL HABITATS RELIED ON POLLEN FROM PRINCIPALLY NATIVE PLANT SPECIES GROWING IN SEMINATURAL HABITAT. THUS CONNECTIVITY AMONG HABITATS WAS CRITICAL FOR OFFSPRING PRODUCTION. FEMALES NESTING ON ORGANIC FARMS WERE BUFFERED TO ISOLATION EFFECTS BY SWITCHING TO. ORAL RESOURCES GROWING AT THE FARM SITE WHEN SEMINATURAL AREAS WERE TOO DISTANT. OVERALL LOCAL HABITAT CONDITIONS (FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES) CAN HELP BOLSTER POLLINATORS, BUT MAINTAINING FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY AMONG HABITATS WILL LIKELY BE CRITICAL FOR PERSISTENCE OF POLLINATOR POPULATIONS AS NATURAL HABITATS ARE INCREASINGLY FRAGMENTED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES.",AGRO-ECOSYSTEM; CONNECTIVITY; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE CHANGE; NATIVE BEES; OSMIA LIGNARIA; REPRODUCTION; RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION,OSMIA-LIGNARIA-PROPINQUA; TROPICAL FOREST FRAGMENTS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SEX-RATIO; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; CROP POLLINATION; BIRD POPULATIONS; FORAGING RANGE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,179,"WILLIAMS, NM (REPRINT AUTHOR), BRYN MAWR COLL, DEPT BIOL, 101 N MERION AVE, ROSEMONT, PA 19010 USA.;PRINCETON UNIV, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, PRINCETON, NJ 08544 USA.",10.1890/06-0269,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",NA,NA,NA,1051-0761,3,910-921,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,17,2007,ISI000245744500023,80,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,215,"ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",NWILLIAMSBRYNMAWR.EDU,157TS,"WILLIAMS, NM (REPRINT AUTHOR), BRYN MAWR COLL, DEPT BIOL, 101 N MERION AVE, ROSEMONT, PA 19010 USA",ISI,none,PRINCETON UNIV,BRYN MAWR COLL,NA,"WILLIAMS NM, 2007, ECOL APPL","WILLIAMS NM, 2007, ECOL APPL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jon Koch

AT THREE EXPERIMENTAL SITES LOCATED BETWEEN 1750 M AND 2350 M ASL IN THE HOHE TAUERN NATIONAL PARK, AUSTRIA, FLOWER VISITATION BEHAVIOR OF BUTTERFLIES WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN SPRING AND LATE SUMMER. THE QUESTION ADDRESSED WAS: DO BUTTERFLIES SEARCH RANDOMLY AMONG AVAILABLE FLOWERS, OR DO THEY PREFER CERTAIN COLOR TYPES OR HIGHLY REWARDING FLOWERS. IN PARTICULAR, THE HYPOTHESIS TO BE TESTED WAS THAT RED NON-UV-REFLECTING FLOWERS, WHICH ARE ASSUMED TO BE PARTICULARLY ADAPTED TO BUTTERFLY VISION, ARE VISITED DISPROPORTIONATELY COMPARED TO OTHER FLOWER COLORS. DIFFERENCES IN THE PROPORTION OF INFLORESCENCES OF A PARTICULAR COLOR VISITED BY BUTTERFLIES COULD NOT BE SIMPLY ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN FREQUENCY OR TO DIFFERENCES IN NECTAR STANDING CROP. FOR INSTANCE, RED NON-UV-REFLECTING INFLORESCENCES WHICH WERE PREVALENT (BETWEEN 20-50\% OF ALL INFLORESCENCES) EXHIBITED THE HIGHEST NECTAR STANDING CROP PER INFLORESCENCE. HOWEVER, BUTTERFLIES DID NOT FREQUENT RED INFLORESCENCES OVER OTHER DIFFERENTLY COLORED AND LESS REWARDING INFLORESCENCES. IN FACT, IN SPRING AND LATE SUMMER BUTTERFLIES VISITED RED INFLORESCENCES LESS FREQUENTLY THAN EXPECTED FROM RANDOM VISITATION. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE SPECIES LEVEL, ONLY TWO OF THE 6 SPECIES, WHICH WERE SELECTED FOR INDIVIDUAL ANALYSIS, SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR RED FLOWERS (EREBIA NIVALIS AND PIERIS RAPAE). ONE SPECIES, COLIAS PALAENO, RESTRICTED 94\% OF ALL OBSERVED VISITS TO YELLOW UV-REFLECTING INFLORESCENCES WHICH WERE RARE AND EXHIBITED A LOW NECTAR STANDING CROP PER INFLORESCENCE, IN CONTRAST, BOLORIA PALES VISITED INFLORESCENCES IN ACCORDANCE TO THEIR FREQUENCY.

EXPERIENCED BEES WITH PRIOR ACCESS TO FLOWERS ACHIEVED HIGHER RATES OF NECTAR INTAKE THAN DID LATER ARRIVALS BECAUSE THEY TRAVELED FASTER BETWEEN FLOWERS AND RETURNED TO FLOWERS AT MORE REGULAR INTERVALS. THESE BEHAVIORAL SKILLS IMPROVED FORAGING PERFORMANCE IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS IN 2 WAYS: NECTAR THAT ACCUMULATED IN FLOWERS COULD BE HARVESTED BEFORE ITS REPLENISHMENT RATE SLOWED DOWN, AND NECTAR COULD BE TAKEN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A COMPETITOR.

JACARANDA OXYPHYLLA, WHOSE FLOWERS POSSESS A CONSPICUOUS GLANDULAR STAMINODE, IS A ZOOPHILOUS CERRADO SPECIES. HERE, THE COMPOSITION OF THE SECRETION OF THE GLANDULAR TRICHOME AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE STAMINODE ON THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF J. OXYPHYLLA WERE STUDIED. METHODS THE FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, POLLEN VIABILITY, STIGMA RECEPTIVITY, NECTAR VOLUME AND NECTAR CONCENTRATION WERE STUDIED. COMPATIBILITY SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED AND FLORAL VISITORS WERE OBSERVED AND IDENTIFIED. EXPERIMENTS COMPARING THE EFFECT OF STAMINODE PRESENCE AND ABSENCE ON POLLEN REMOVAL AND POLLEN DEPOSITION EFFICIENCY WERE CONDUCTED IN OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS. HISTOCHEMISTRY, THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY (TLC) AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO FLAME IONIZATION DETECTION (GC-FID) ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE MAIN CHEMICAL COMPONENTS OF THE STAMINODE'S GLANDULAR TRICHOME SECRETION. KEY RESULTS FLOWER ANTHESIS LASTED 2 D AND, DESPITE THE LOW FREQUENCY OF FLOWER VISITATION, POLLINATION SEEMED TO BE EFFECTED MAINLY BY MEDIUM-SIZED EULAEMA NIGRITA AND BOMBUS MORIO BEES, BY THE SMALL BEE EXOMALOPSIS FULVOFASCIATA AND OCCASIONALLY BY HUMMINGBIRDS. SMALL BEES BELONGING TO THE GENERA CERATINA, AUGOCHLORA AND TRIGONA WERE FREQUENT VISITORS, COLLECTING POLLEN. JACARANDA OXYPHYLLA IS PREDOMINANTLY ALLOGAMOUS. STAMINODE REMOVAL RESULTED IN FEWER POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS BUT DID NOT AFFECT TOTAL POLLEN REMOVAL. THE SECRETION OF CAPITATE GLANDULAR TRICHOME OCCURS CONTINUALLY, THE MAIN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS DETECTED HISTOCHEMICALLY WERE PHENOLIC AND TERPENOID (ESSENTIAL OILS AND RESINS).

BIOL.,"PEPINO MOSAIC VIRUS (PEPMV) HAS BECOME AN IMPORTANT VIRAL DISEASE OF GREENHOUSE TOMATOES WORLDWIDE. THE ABILITY OF BUMBLE-BEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS), USED FOR POLLINATION, TO ACQUIRE AND TRANSMIT PEPMV WAS INVESTIGATED, AND THE PREVALENCE OF PEPMV IN PLANTS AND BUMBLE-BEES IN COMMERCIAL TOMATO GREENHOUSES WAS DETERMINED. PEPMV INFECTION IN PLANTS WAS DETERMINED USING ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY, WHILE IN BUMBLE-BEES DIRECT REAL-TIME PCR WAS USED. IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT, THE BUMBLE-BEES WERE EXPOSED FOR 14 DAYS TO PEPMV-INFECTED PLANTS. AFTER 14 DAYS, ALMOST ALL BUMBLE-BEES WERE PEPMV POSITIVE BOTH IN THE HIVE (78.5 +/- 17.5\%) AND IN THE FLOWERS (96.3 +/- 3.6\%). IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, BUMBLE-BEES WERE RELEASED INTO A GREENHOUSE WITH BOTH PEPMV-INFECTED SOURCE PLANTS AND HEALTHY NON-INFECTED TARGET PLANTS FOR 14 DAYS. AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT, 61.0 +/- 19.5\% OF THE BEES COLLECTED FROM THE HIVE AND 83.3 +/- 16.7\% OF THE BEES SAMPLED FROM THE FLOWERS WERE PEPMV POSITIVE. BUMBLE-BEES TRANSMITTED PEPMV FROM THE INFECTED TO THE HEALTHY NON-INFECTED TOMATO PLANTS. TWO WEEKS AFTER BUMBLE-BEE RELEASE, THE VIRUS WAS DETECTED IN LEAF, FRUIT AND FLOWER SAMPLES OF FORMERLY HEALTHY PLANTS. AFTER 6 WEEKS, THE PERCENTAGE OF PEPMV POSITIVE SAMPLES FROM THE TARGET PLANTS INCREASED TO 52.8 +/- 2.8\% OF THE LEAVES AND 80.6 +/- 8.4\% OF THE FRUITS. IN THE CONTROL GREENHOUSE WITHOUT BUMBLE-BEES, THE TARGET PLANTS DID NOT BECOME INFECTED. BASED ON THE INFECTION LEVELS IN FLOWERS, FRUITS AND LEAVES, THE PEPMV INFECTION OCCURRED POSSIBLY FIRST IN THE POLLINATED FLOWERS, AND THEN SPREAD FROM THE FRUIT THAT DEVELOPED FROM THE FLOWERS TO OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT. IN COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSES WHERE PEPMV WAS PRESENT, 92-100\% OF THE PLANTS AND 88-100\% OF THE BUMBLE-BEES WERE PEPMV POSITIVE.

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS VARIATION AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS GOVERNING MORPH RATIOS. WE ESTIMATED MORPH RATIOS IN 124 POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE RANGE OF N. TRIANDRUS AND MEASURED 13 MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS IN 35-78 POPULATIONS. SAMPLING OF MORPH RATIOS CONDUCTED OVER 2-10-YR INTERVALS DEMONSTRATED STRONG TEMPORAL STABILITY. VARIATION IN FLORAL AND VEGETATIVE TRAITS ENABLED STATISTICAL PREDICTION OF MORPH-FREQUENCY VARIATION AMONG POPULATIONS. LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE WERE CORRELATED WITH PLANT AND FLOWER SIZE, WITH LARGER FLOWERS IN NORTHERN POPULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUMBLEBEE VISITATION AND STYLAR DIMORPHISM. FLOWERS OF THE L- AND M-MORPHS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE S-MORPH IN SEVERAL SIZE-RELATED CHARACTERS, UNLIKE OTHER TRISTYLOUS SPECIES. THIS PATTERN AND THE SIMILARITY IN ANTHER POSITIONS OF THE L- AND M-MORPHS SUGGEST THAT THE M-MORPH OF N. TRIANDRUS ORIGINATED THROUGH GENETIC MODIFIERS THAT SHORTENED STYLES OF THE L-MORPH.

BIOL.,"MANY MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THYMELAEACEAE ARE HIGHLY PRAISED AND ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FRAGRANT SCENT, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THEIR SECONDARY METABOLITES. TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL ROLE THAT SECONDARY METABOLITES PLAY IN POLLINATION, WE STUDIED THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS OF FIVE DIPLOMORPHA SPECIES IN JAPAN BY INVESTIGATING THEIR FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND FLOWER-VISITING INSECT FAUNA. WE ALSO ANALYZED THE COMPOSITION AND TEMPORAL EMISSION PATTERN OF FLORAL VOLATILES IN ONE OF THE SPECIES TO DETERMINE IF THERE WERE ANY CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBSERVED FLOWER VISITORS. IN DIPLOMORPHA, ANTHESIS BEGAN AT DUSK AND VARIOUS NOCTURNAL MOTHS WERE FOUND VISITING THE FLOWERS, OFTEN CARRYING NUMEROUS POLLEN GRAINS ON THEIR PROBOSCISES. HOWEVER, NO HAWKMOTHS WERE OBSERVED VISITING DIPLOMORPHA FLOWERS. DIURNAL INSECTS VISITED THE FLOWERS LESS OFTEN, AND MOST OF THEM HAD SHORT MOUTHPARTS AND DID NOT EFFECTIVELY CONTACT THE STIGMA. THE FLORAL SCENT OF DIPLOMORPHA SIKOKIANA WAS RELEASED ONLY AT NIGHT WHEN THE MOTHS WERE ACTIVE AND CONSISTED MAINLY OF MONOTERPENES AND BENZENOIDS, WITH A SMALL AMOUNT OF A SESQUITERPENE. THE PRESENT STUDY IS THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE POLLINATION SYSTEM OF DIPLOMORPHA AND SUGGESTS THAT THESE PLANTS EXHIBIT A RANGE OF FLORAL FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATION BY NOCTURNAL MOTHS.

TEMPERATE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES REQUIRE DISTINCT AND APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT TO PREVENT FURTHER IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE FLORA AND FAUNA. THIS IS ESPECIALLY URGENT FOR POLLINATING INSECTS THAT PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. OUR AIM WAS TO EXAMINE HOW SPECIES RICHNESS OF THREE IMPORTANT GROUPS OF POLLINATING INSECTS, SOLITARY BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND BURNET MOTHS ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENT FARM CHARACTERISTICS, AND IF THERE ARE ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE THREE GROUPS. A FURTHER AIM WAS TO TEST IF RED-LISTED SPECIES ARE RELATED TO ANY FARM CHARACTERISTICS. SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND BURNETS WAS MEASURED ON ALL SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS AT 16 FARMS IN A FOREST-DOMINATED AREA OF 50 KM(2) IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, USING SYSTEMATIC TRANSECT WALKS IN APRIL TO SEPTEMBER 2003 (ONLY BUTTERFLIES AND BURNETS) AND 2005. SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES AND BUTTERFLIES WAS INTERCORRELATED, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND. SPECIES RICHNESS OF SOLITARY BEES INCREASED WITH THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECT OF THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS STRONGLY POSITIVELY RELATED WITH THE DENSITY OF THE PLANT KNAUTIA ARVENSIS AND NEGATIVELY RELATED WITH THE PROPORTION OF GRAZED GRASSLAND. THE RESULTS WERE SIMILAR FOR SOLITARY BEES AND BUTTERFLIES. THE NUMBER OF RED-LISTED SOLITARY BEES WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF MEADOWS WITH LATE HARVEST (AFTER MID-JULY) AND DECREASED WITH INCREASED FARM ISOLATION.

FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF BUMBLEBEES AS POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS GENERATED THE NEED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AGAINST THESE INSECTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF TWO COMMERCIAL TRICHODERMA-BASED BIOFUNGICIDES AGAINST THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. THE TWO COMMERCIAL COMPOUNDS TESTED WERE BINAB-TF-WP AND BINAB-TF-WP-KONC, BOTH OF WHICH CONTAIN COMBINATIONS OF TRICHODERMA HARZIANUM ATCC20476 AND DICHODERMA POLYSPORUM ATCC20475. THE BUMBLEBEES WERE EXPOSED TO THE BIOCONTROL AGENTS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN THE FIELD (MFRC), AND THEN EXPOSED VIA THREE POTENTIAL ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: DERMAL CONTACT, ORALLY VIA THE DRINKING OF TREATED SUGAR WATER, AND VIA TREATED POLLEN. THE TREATMENTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH RECORDING WORKER MORTALITY (LETHAL EFFECTS) AND ANY EFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DRONES (SUBLETHAL EFFECTS). THE LABORATORY TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS DID NOT CAUSE WORKER MORTALITY OR ADVERSELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE TRICHODERMA-BASED PRODUCTS COULD SURVIVE OR GROW ON THE BODIES OF THE ADULT WORKERS. IN NO CASE WAS SURVIVAL OR GROWTH OF THE BIOFUNGICIDE OBSERVED ON THE WORKERS. WHEN THE EFFECTS OF THESE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED AGAINST BUMBLEBEE LARVAE (THIRD AND FOURTH INSTARS), NO ENTOMOPATHOGENIC EFFECTS WERE FOUND.

WE EXAMINED THE HABITAT AND FLOWER RESOURCE OCCUPANCY BY THE INVASIVE INTRODUCED BUMBLE BEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS AND THREE DOMINANT NATIVE BUMBLE BEES IN CENTRAL HOKKAIDO, NORTHERN JAPAN, IN RELATION TO A LANDSCAPE FACTOR (FOREST COVER RATIO) AND FLOWER MORPHOLOGY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROBOSCIS LENGTH OF BEES. THREE YEARS OF MONITORING THE INVASIVE BOUNDARY OF B.

THIS HABITAT PARTITIONING LIKELY FOLLOWED THE DISPLACEMENT OF THE NATIVES BY THE INVADER IN OPEN AGRICULTURAL LANDS. IN FORESTED AREAS, THE NATIVE SPECIES PARTITIONED FLOWER RESOURCES ON THE BASIS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROBOSCIS LENGTH AND THE LENGTHS OF THE COROLLA TUBES OF FLOWERS. HOWEVER, IN OPEN AGRICULTURAL AREAS, BOTH THE LONG- AND SHORT-TUBED FLOWERS WERE PRIMARILY VISITED BY THE EXOTIC SHORT-TONGUED B.

THE INVASION OF B. TERRESTRIS INTO OPEN NATURAL VEGETATION, IN ADDITION TO OPEN AGRICULTURAL AREAS, HAS RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED IN HOKKAIDO. EVEN THOUGH THE EXOTIC AND DOMINANT NATIVE BUMBLE BEES PARTITION THEIR HABITAT ACCORDING TO LANDSCAPE FACTORS, THE INVASIVE BEE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER THE OVERALL INTERACTIONS WITHIN PLANT-POLLINATOR SYSTEMS IN THE REGIONS OF OPEN VEGETATION ON HOKKAIDO ISLAND.

TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL OF FLORAL HOMEOTIC MUTANTS, WE ESTABLISHED AS A MODEL SYSTEM STAMENOID PETALS (SPE), A NATURAL VARIANT OF CAPSELLA BURSA-PASTORIS (BRASSICACEAE). IN THE FLOWERS OF SPE PLANTS, PETALS ARE TRANSFORMED INTO STAMENS, WHEREAS ALL OTHER FLORAL ORGANS ARE UNAFFECTED. IN CONTRAST WITH MOST OTHER HOMEOTIC MUTANTS, THE SPE VARIANT OCCURS IN RELATIVELY STABLE POPULATIONS IN THE WILD. IN ORDER TO DETERMINE HOW THE PROFOUND CHANGE IN FLORAL ARCHITECTURE INFLUENCES PLANT PERFORMANCE IN THE WILD, WE PERFORMED COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENTS RUNNING OVER 3 YEARS. HERE, WE SHOW THAT SPE AND WILD-TYPE PLANTS ATTRACT THE SAME ASSEMBLAGE OF FLORAL VISITORS: MAINLY HOVERFLIES, WILD BEES AND THRIPS. HOWEVER, FLORAL VISITATION IS ABOUT TWICE AS FREQUENT IN WILD-TYPE PLANTS AS IN SPE PLANTS. NEVERTHELESS, THE NUMBERS OF SEEDS PER FRUIT WERE ABOUT THE SAME IN BOTH VARIANTS. WILD-TYPE PLANTS PRODUCED MORE FLOWERS, FRUITS AND SEEDS PER PLANT THAN SPE PLANTS, WHEREAS THE GERMINATION CAPACITY OF SPE SEEDS WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE WILD-TYPE. DETERMINATION OF VOLATILE COMPOSITION REVEALED MONOTERPENES AND 3,4-DIMETHYLBENZALDEHYDE, WHICH WERE DETECTED ONLY IN WILD-TYPE FLOWERS, PRESUMABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE PRODUCED ONLY BY PETALS. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT THE SIMILAR FITNESS OF SPE AND WILD-TYPE C. BURSA-PASTORIS IN THE FIELD RESULTS FROM COMPLEX COMPENSATION BETWEEN PLANT ARCHITECTURE AND GERMINATION CAPACITY.

BOT.,"SPATIAL VARIATION IN POLLINATOR COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE IS A WELL-RECOGNIZED PHENOMENON. HOWEVER, A WEAKNESS OF MANY STUDIES CLAIMING SPECIFICITY OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IS THAT THEY ARE OFTEN RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE LOCALITY. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE POLLINATOR EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT FLOWER VISITORS TO THE TERRESTRIAL ORCHID EULOPHIA ALTA AT THREE DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AND TO ANALYSE WHETHER DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION EFFECT THIS PLANT'S REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. NATURAL POLLINATION WAS OBSERVED IN VIVO, AND MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENTS WERE USED TO STUDY THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY AND BREEDING SYSTEM OF E. ALTA AT THREE SITES NEAR MANAUS, BRAZIL. TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, NECTAR COMPOSITION AND SECRETION PATTERNS WERE ALSO STUDIED, FLORAL SCENT COMPOSITION WAS ANALYSED AND A BIOASSAY WAS CONDUCTED. FLOWER VISITORS, POLLINATOR COMPOSITION, POLLINIA TRANSFER EFFICIENCY OF PARTICULAR POLLINATOR SPECIES AND NATURAL FRUIT SET DIFFERED AMONG THE INVESTIGATED POPULATIONS OF E. ALTA. FLOWERS WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE, PARTIALLY AUTOGAMOUS AND EFFECTIVELY POLLINATED BY FIVE BEE SPECIES (FOUR CENTRIS SPECIES AND XYLOCOPA MUSCARIA). VISITING INSECTS APPEARED TO IMBIBE SMALL AMOUNTS OF HEXOSE-RICH NECTAR. NECTAR SUGAR CONTENT WAS HIGHEST ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER FLOWER OPENING. FLORAL FRAGRANCE ANALYSES REVEALED 42 COMPOUNDS, OF WHICH MONOTERPENES AND BENZENOIDS PREDOMINATED. A BIOASSAY USING FLORAL PARTS REVEALED THAT ONLY FLORAL TISSUE FROM THE LABELLUM CHAMBER AND LABELLUM TIP WAS ATTRACTIVE TO FLOWER VISITORS. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE THREE POPULATIONS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY ABSOLUTE ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS ALONE.

MONOGR.,"THE CONCEPT OF SELECTION MOSAIC IS CENTRAL TO THE GEOGRAPHIC MOSAIC THEORY OF COEVOLUTION. MOST INFORMATION ON COEVOLVING INTERACTIONS, HOWEVER, COMES FROM SPECIALIZED ORGANISMS. IN CONTRAST, AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECT OF GEOGRAPHICALLY VARYING EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS ON THE EVOLUTION OF GENERALIST ORGANISMS IS LACKING, ALTHOUGH THESE KINDS OF ORGANISMS ARE THE MOST FREQUENT IN NATURE. IN FLOWERING PLANTS, POLLINATORS AND HERBIVORES ARE IMPORTANT SELECTIVE AGENTS. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER A GEOGRAPHIC SELECTION MOSAIC FOR. ORAL TRAITS IN A GENERALIST PLANT, ERYSIMUM MEDIOHISPANICUM (BRASSICACEAE), CAN BE MEDIATED BY THE INTERPLAY OF MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTING ORGANISMS. IN EIGHT POPULATIONS WE QUANTIFIED THE SELECTION EXERTED BY THESE ORGANISMS ON SEVERAL PLANT TRAITS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL VARIATION IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE. IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, THE MAIN POLLINATORS BELONGED TO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (BEEFLIES, LARGE BEES, SMALL BEES, AND BEETLES). DAMAGE BY UNGULATES ALSO VARIED AMONG POPULATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE FOUND THAT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WERE UNDER DIFFERENT SELECTIVE REGIMES, AND THE TRAITS AFFECTED BY SELECTION DEPENDED ON THE LOCAL INTERACTION INTENSITY WITH POLLINATORS AND MAMMAL HERBIVORES. SOME TRAITS, SUCH AS FLOWER NUMBER AND STALK HEIGHT, WERE SELECTED SIMILARLY IN MOST POPULATIONS. OTHER TRAITS, SUCH AS COROLLA DIAMETER AND TUBE LENGTH, WERE SELECTED ONLY IN SOME POPULATIONS. FINALLY, WE FOUND DIVERGENT SELECTION FOR SOME TRAITS, SUCH AS COROLLA TUBE WIDTH AND COROLLA SHAPE, WHICH WERE SELECTED IN CONTRASTING DIRECTIONS IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES. THIS SPATIAL VARIATION IN SELECTIVE SCENARIOS RESULTS IN POPULATIONS WITH STRONG SELECTIVE REGIMES (HOT SPOTS) INTERMINGLED WITH POPULATIONS WITH WEAK SELECTIVE REGIMES (COLD SPOTS). FOUR IMPORTANT OUTCOMES EMERGE FROM THE E. MEDIOHISPANICUM SELECTION MOSAIC. (1) INTERACTIONS WITH GENERALIST ORGANISMS MAY PRODUCE STRONG SELECTION. (2) SPATIAL CHANGES IN MAIN POLLINATORS RESULT IN DIVERGENT SELECTION ACROSS POPULATIONS. (3) GEOGRAPHIC MOSAICS DEPEND ON A BALANCE BETWEEN MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION. (4) SELECTION MOSAICS OPERATE AT FAIRLY SMALL SPATIAL SCALES.

APPL. ECOL.,"P>1. MANAGEMENT OF LOWLAND MESOTROPHIC GRASSLANDS IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE OFTEN MAKES USE OF INORGANIC FERTILIZERS, HIGH STOCKING DENSITIES AND SILAGE-BASED FORAGE SYSTEMS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY. THE IMPACT OF THESE PRACTICES HAS RESULTED IN A SIMPLIFICATION OF THE PLANT COMMUNITY COMBINED WITH WIDE-SCALE DECLINES IN THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF GRASSLAND INVERTEBRATES. WE AIM TO IDENTIFY HOW FIELD MARGIN MANAGEMENT CAN BE USED TO PROMOTE INVERTEBRATE DIVERSITY ACROSS A SUITE OF FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE TAXA (BEETLES, PLANTHOPPERS, TRUE BUGS, BUTTERFLIES, BUMBLEBEES AND SPIDERS). 2. USING AN INFORMATION THEORETIC APPROACH WE IDENTIFY THE IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT (CATTLE GRAZING, CUTTING AND INORGANIC FERTILIZER) AND PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION (FORB SPECIES RICHNESS, GRASS SPECIES RICHNESS AND SWARD ARCHITECTURE) ON INVERTEBRATE SPECIES RICHNESS AND BODY SIZE. AS MANY OF THESE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE COMMON TO GRASSLAND SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, UNDERSTANDING INVERTEBRATE RESPONSES TO THEM IS IMPORTANT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF BIODIVERSITY. 3. SWARD ARCHITECTURE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE PRIMARY FACTOR PROMOTING INCREASED SPECIES RICHNESS OF BOTH PREDATORY AND PHYTOPHAGOUS TROPHIC LEVELS, AS WELL AS BEING POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH MEAN BODY SIZE. IN ALL CASES PHYTOPHAGOUS INVERTEBRATE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH MEASURES OF PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. 4. THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES APPEAR TO BE COMPARATIVELY WEAK, SUGGESTING THAT THEIR IMPACTS ARE INDIRECT AND MEDIATED THOUGH THE CONTINUOUS MEASURES OF PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, SUCH AS SWARD ARCHITECTURE OR PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. BY PARTITIONING FIELD MARGINS FROM THE REMAINDER OF THE FIELD, ECONOMICALLY VIABLE INTENSIVE GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT CAN BE COMBINED WITH EXTENSIVE MANAGEMENT AIMED AT PROMOTING NATIVE BIODIVERSITY. THE ABSENCE OF INORGANIC FERTILIZER, COMBINED WITH A REDUCTION IN THE INTENSITY OF BOTH CUTTING AND GRAZING REGIMES, PROMOTES FLORAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND SWARD ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXITY.

WE ASKED WHETHER SUCH FOOTPRINT HYDROCARBONS ARE RETAINED ON FLOWERS FOR SUFFICIENTLY LONG PERIODS OF TIME SO AS TO REFLECT BEE VISITATION IN POLLINATION STUDIES. IN LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, FLOWER COROLLAE (PRIMULA VERIS, DIGITALIS GRANDIFLORA) VISITED BY BOMBUS TERRESTRIS WORKERS RETAINED BEE-DERIVED NONACOSENES (C(29)H(58)) IN NEAR-UNCHANGED QUANTITIES FOR 24 HOURS, BOTH AT 15 AND 25A DEGREES C.

DISTRIB.,"THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE PROBABILITY OF SUITABLE HABITATS IN THE USA FOR TWO ADVENTIVE ORCHID BEE SPECIES (EULAEMA POLYCHROMA (MOCSARY) AND EUGLOSSA VIRIDISSIMA FRIESE), ONE OF WHICH HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF ITS ASSOCIATED ORCHID HOSTS. NORTH AND CENTRAL AMERICA, NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. USING POSITIVE OCCURRENCE DATA WITHIN THE NATIVE RANGE OF BOTH ORCHID BEE SPECIES, MAXENT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING WAS EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE THE PROBABILITY OF SUITABLE HABITATS IN THE USA. THE POWER OF PREDICTABILITY FOR THE MODEL WAS TESTED USING PARTITIONS OF THE DATA. OUR RESULTS SHOW THE ABSENCE OF SUITABLE HABITAT IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA FOR E. POLYCHROMA TO MAINTAIN POPULATIONS THERE, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING THE NORTHERNMOST LIMIT FOR THE SPECIES AT AROUND 29 DEGREES N IN NORTH-WESTERN MEXICO. SUITABLE HABITAT WAS FOUND FOR E. VIRIDISSIMA IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT SOUTHERN FLORIDA. THIS SPECIES IS PREDICTED TO SPREAD TO OCCUPY ROUGHLY THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELLING IS USEFUL FOR EVALUATING RECORDS OF SPECIES OCCURRENCE OUTSIDE OF THEIR NATIVE RANGE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ISOLATED RECORD OF A MALE OF E. POLYCHROMA FROM SOUTHERN ARIZONA SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ESTABLISHED POPULATION IN THE ABSENCE OF FURTHER MALES AND FEMALES FROM THE SAME REGION. CONVERSELY, E. VIRIDISSIMA HAS SUCCESSFULLY BECOME ESTABLISHED IN SOUTH-EASTERN FLORIDA AFTER A SEEMINGLY ACCIDENTAL INTRODUCTION FIRST NOTICED IN THE SUMMER OF 2003. WE DISCUSS THE NATURALIZATION OF E.

BROSI BJ,BROSI BJ,THE COMPLEX RESPONSES OF SOCIAL STINGLESS BEES (APIDAE: MELIPONINI) TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,FOR. ECOL. MANAGE.,"DESPITE CONCERN OVER A PUTATIVE ``GLOBAL POLLINATION CRISIS, WE STILL HAVE AN INCOMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BEE COMMUNITIES RESPOND TO LAND-USE CHANGE. I STUDIED THE RESPONSES OF SOCIAL STINGLESS (OR ``MELIPONINE) BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE: MELIPONINI) TO SURROUNDING FOREST COVER AND FLORAL RESOURCES IN 35 SITES IN A LARGELY DEFORESTED LANDSCAPE IN COSTA RICA OVER THREE YEARS. SAMPLING BEES WITH A STANDARDIZED NETTING PROTOCOL. I RECORDED A DIVERSE FAUNA OF MELIPONINES, COMPRISED OF 20 SPECIES AND NINE GENERA. I FOUND THAT MELIPONINE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO FOREST COVER, BUT NOT FLORAL RESOURCE VARIABLES (BLOOMING PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE). THE EFFECT OF FOREST ON MELIPONINE ABUNDANCE, BUT NOT DIVERSITY, DISAPPEARED WHEN THE MOST COMMON MELIPONINE SPECIES, TRIGONA FULVIVENTRIS (WHICH COMPRISED SIMILAR TO 45\% OF SAMPLED INDIVIDUALS), WAS EXCLUDED FROM ANALYSES. MELIPONINE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, BY CONTRAST, WAS RELATED MOST STRONGLY TO PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS, ONLY WEAKLY TO FOREST COVER, AND NOT RELATED TO BLOOMING PLANT ABUNDANCE. THIS WORK DIFFERS FROM PAST WORK IN THE SAME LANDSCAPE, WHICH DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF CHANGES IN SPECIES RICHNESS OR ABUNDANCE OF MELIPONINES AND FOREST-RELATED VARIABLES (DISTANCE TO FOREST OR FOREST FRAGMENT SIZE), BUT DID FIND SHIFTS TOWARD MELIPONINE-DOMINATED COMMUNITIES NEAR FORESTS, ESPECIALLY LARGER ONES. THE LARGER TRUE SAMPLE SIZE (I.E. NUMBER OF SAMPLE SITES) OF THE PRESENT WORK LIKELY IMPROVED THE STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT THESE RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE MELIPONINES ARE FOREST DEPENDENT, I RECORDED SOME SPECIES IN THE SMALLEST FOREST FRAGMENTS IN THE LANDSCAPE, AND AS A GROUP THEY RESPOND STRONGLY TO OVERALL FOREST COVER IN THE LANDSCAPE (I.E. INCLUDING BOTH SMALL AND LARGE PATCHES OF FOREST) BOTH OF THESE OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT ARGUMENTS FOR PRESERVING EVEN SMALL FRAGMENTS OF FOREST IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. GIVEN THE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MELIPONINE BEES, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR LONG-TERM CONSERVATION NEEDS IN THE CHANGING TROPICAL LANDSCAPES OF THE WORLD.

OHASHI K;THOMSON JD,OHASHI K,"TRAPLINE FORAGING BY POLLINATORS: ITS ONTOGENY, ECONOMICS AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANTS",ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"TRAPLINE FORAGING (REPEATED SEQUENTIAL VISITS TO A SERIES OF FEEDING LOCATIONS) HAS BEEN OFTEN OBSERVED IN POLLINATORS COLLECTING NECTAR OR POLLEN FROM FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH FIELD STUDIES ON BUMBLE-BEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS HAVE CLARIFIED FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THIS BEHAVIOUR, TRAPLINE FORAGING STILL POSES SEVERAL DIFFICULT QUESTIONS FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF BOTH ANIMALS AND PLANTS. THESE QUESTIONS INCLUDE WHETHER AND HOW TRAPLINING IMPROVES FORAGING PERFORMANCE, HOW ANIMALS DEVELOP TRAPLINES WITH ACCUMULATING FORAGING EXPERIENCE, AND HOW TRAPLINING AFFECTS POLLEN FLOW OR PLANT REPRODUCTION. FIRST, WE REVIEW OUR PREVIOUS WORK PERFORMED BY USING COMPUTER SIMULATIONS AND INDOOR FLIGHT-CAGE EXPERIMENTS WITH BUMBLE-BEES FORAGING FROM ARRAYS OF AUTOMATED FEEDERS. OUR FINDINGS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (1) TRAPLINING BENEFITS FORAGERS THAT ARE COMPETING FOR RESOURCES THAT REPLENISH IN A DECELERATING WAY, (2) TRAPLINING IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOUR THAT DEVELOPS OVER A PERIOD OF HOURS AND (3) THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TRAPLINES COULD BE HAMPERED BY SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF PLANTS SUCH AS ZIGZAGS. SECOND, USING A SIMULATION MODEL LINKING POLLINATOR MOVEMENT AND POLLEN TRANSFER, WE CONSIDER HOW SERVICE BY POLLINATORS WITH DIFFERENT FORAGING PATTERNS (SEARCHERS OR TRAPLINERS) WOULD AFFECT POLLEN FLOW. TRAPLINING INCREASES MATING DISTANCE AND MATE DIVERSITY, AND REDUCES `ITEROGAMY' (SELF-POLLINATION CAUSED BY RETURN VISITS) AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. FURTHERMORE, INCREASED VISITATION RATES CAN HAVE OPPOSITE EFFECTS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF A PLANT, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE VISITORS ARE TRAPLINING OR SEARCHING. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF TRAPLINING FOR PLANTS IN THE LIGHT OF NEW EXPERIMENTAL WORK AND MODELLING. WE SUGGEST THAT TRAPLINE FORAGING BY POLLINATORS INCREASES VARIATION AMONG PLANT POPULATIONS IN GENETIC DIVERSITY, INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF FLORAL TRAITS TO PLANT FITNESS, WHICH SHOULD IN TURN AFFECT THE RATES AND DIRECTIONS OF FLORAL EVOLUTION. MORE THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF SUCH A NEGLECTED SIDE OF POLLINATION.",ARTIFICIAL FLOWER; BOMBUS; COMPETITION; FLORAL EVOLUTION; FORAGING EXPERIENCE; ITEROGAMY; MODEL; POLLEN FLOW; POLLINATOR MOVEMENT; RENEWING RESOURCE; SPATIAL MEMORY; TRAPLINE FORAGING,FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; PROPORTIONALLY FEWER FLOWERS; BUMBLE-BEES; POLLEN CARRYOVER; GENE FLOW; NECTAR AVAILABILITY; MOVEMENT PATTERNS; SPATIAL MEMORY; EMPTY FLOWERS; HUMMINGBIRDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,66,"OHASHI, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058572, JAPAN.;OHASHI, KAZUHARU, UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058572, JAPAN.;THOMSON, JAMES D., UNIV TORONTO, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TORONTO, ON M5S 3GS, CANADA.",10.1093/AOB/MCP088,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,0305-7364,9,1365-1378,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,103,2009,ISI000266497800002,79,PLANT SCIENCES,61,PLANT SCIENCES,KOHASHIIES.LIFE.TSUKUBA.AC.JP,451VA,"OHASHI, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058572, JAPAN",ISI,none,UNIV TSUKUBA;UNIV TORONTO,UNIV TSUKUBA,NA,"OHASHI K, 2009, ANN BOT","OHASHI K, 2009, ANN BOT",NA,NA,NA,NA,John M

TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS UNIQUE PROCESS OF POLLEN TRANSFER, COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN GABON. DURING A TOTAL STAY OF 11 MONTHS, 31 SPECIES OF MARANTACEAE WERE INVESTIGATED AT DIFFERENT SITES IN GABON. THE STUDY INCLUDED ANALYSES OF FLORAL DIVERSITY, OBSERVATIONS ON THE POLLINATOR SPECTRUM AS WELL AS ECOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS (E.G. NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION AND VOLUME). ANALYSES REVEAL FIVE FLOWER TYPES BASED ON FLOWER SIZE AND PIGMENTATION, SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE FLORAL TUBE AND PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF NECTAR GUIDES AND CONSPICUOUS OUTER STAMINODES. EACH TYPE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL POLLINATOR GROUP LEADING TO THE DESCRIPTION OF DISTINCT POLLINATION SYNDROMES. THE `SMALL (HORIZONTAL)' FLOWERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY POLLINATED BY SMALL BEES (THRINCHOSTOMA SPP., ALLODAPULA ORNATICEPS), THE `LARGE (HORIZONTAL)' AND `MEDIUM-SIZED (HORIZONTAL)' FLOWERS BY MEDIUM-SIZED BEES (AMEGILLA VIVIDA, THRINCHOSTOMA BICOMETES), THE `LOCKED (HORIZONTAL)' FLOWERS BY LARGE BEES (XYLOCOPA NIGRITA, X.

THE TRAPS WERE INSPECTED ONCE A MONTH WITH AN OTOSCOPE. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN NESTS WERE OBTAINED AT ESTACAO ECOLOGICA DE PAULO DE FARIA, PAULO DE FARIA (EEPF). THESE INCLUDED NINE SPECIES BELONGING TO FIVE GENERA AND TWO FAMILIES. AT SANTA CECILIA FARM (SCF), 12 SPECIES BELONGING TO SEVEN GENERA AND THREE FAMILIES BUILT 392 NESTS. NATURAL ENEMIES REARED FROM NESTS OF BOTH AREAS INCLUDED HYMENOPTERA, DIPTERA AND COLEOPTERA. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN THE AREAS BUT THE COMMUNITIES DIFFERED CONSIDERABLY IN SPECIES COMPOSITION. THE HIGHER DIVERSITY FOUND AT EEPF WAS DUE TO MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THE SPECIES. NO DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE NUMBERS OF NESTS BUILT IN EACH YEAR IN EACH AREA. ALTHOUGH THE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS LOWER IN THE COOL/DRY SEASON OF BOTH YEARS AT SCF, AND IN THE FIRST YEAR AT EEPF, THE NESTING FREQUENCIES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN SEASONS FOR BOTH THE OVERALL COMMUNITY BUT FOR EACH OF THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. NO ANNUAL FLUCTUATION IN THE FREQUENCIES OF NESTING WAS OBSERVED.

THUS, A CENTRAL IMPLICATION OF THE POLLINATION SYNDROME CONCEPT, THAT. ORAL TRAIT EVOLUTION OCCURS PRIMARILY VIA SPECIALIZED INTERACTIONS OF PLANTS WITH THEIR POLLINATORS, HAS BEEN QUESTIONED. HOWEVER, BROAD SURVEYS MAY NOT DISTINGUISH WHETHER FLOWER VISITORS ARE ACTUAL POLLEN VECTORS AND HENCE LACK POWER TO ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SYNDROME TRAITS AND THE POLLINATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR EVOLUTION. HERE WE ADDRESS WHETHER THE. ORAL TRAITS OF THREE CLOSELY RELATED HERMAPHRODITIC SILENE SPP. NATIVE TO EASTERN NORTH AMERICA (S. CAROLINIANA, S. VIRGINICA, AND S. STELLATA) CORRESPOND TO PREDICTED SPECIALIZED POLLINATION BASED ON. ORAL DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE SPECIES AND THE CONGRUENCE OF THESE. ORAL FEATURES WITH RECOGNIZED POLLINATION SYNDROMES. A NOCTURNAL/DIURNAL POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL THREE SILENE SPP. HAVE DIURNAL POLLINATORS, AND ONLY S. STELLATA HAS NOCTURNAL POLLINATORS. MULTIYEAR STUDIES OF VISITATION RATES DEMONSTRATED THAT LARGE BEES, HUMMINGBIRDS, AND NOCTURNAL MOTHS WERE THE MOST FREQUENT POLLINATORS OF S. CAROLINIANA, S. VIRGINICA, AND S. STELLATA, RESPECTIVELY. ESTIMATES OF POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED AND REMOVED PER VISIT GENERALLY CORROBORATED THE VISITATION RATE RESULTS FOR ALL THREE SPECIES. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVELY INFREQUENT DIURNAL HAWKMOTH POLLINATORS OF S. CAROLINIANA WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AND MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE MOST FREQUENT LARGE BEE VISITORS. POLLINATOR IMPORTANCE (VISITATION 3 DEPOSITION) OF EACH OF THE ANIMAL VISITORS TO EACH SPECIES WAS ESTIMATED AND DEMONSTRATED THAT IN MOST YEARS LARGE BEES AND NOCTURNAL MOTHS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF S. CAROLINIANA AND S. STELLATA, RESPECTIVELY. BY QUANTIFYING COMPREHENSIVE ASPECTS OF THE POLLINATION PROCESS WE DETERMINED THAT S. VIRGINICA AND S. STELLATA WERE SPECIALIZED ON HUMMINGBIRDS AND NOCTURNAL MOTHS, RESPECTIVELY, AND S. CAROLINIANA WAS THE LEAST SPECIALIZED WITH DIURNAL HAWKMOTH AND LARGE BEE POLLINATORS. COMPARED ACROSS THE SILENE SPECIES, DIVERGENT. ORAL CHARACTER STATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH INCREASING THE ATTRACTION AND/OR POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE MAJOR POLLINATORS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THE POLLINATORS ARE PAST AND/OR CONTEMPORARY SELECTIVE AGENTS FOR.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"WE DESCRIBE A REPRODUCTIVE AND POPULATION DYNAMIC STUDY OF THE TOTAL POPULATION OF A CRITICALLY ENDANGERED PLANT OVER 10 YEARS, DURING WHICH PART OF THE POPULATION WAS PROTECTED FROM THE MAIN THREAT, FERAL UNGULATES. LINUM CRATERICOLA (LINACEAE) WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1966 AT TWO SITES ON FLOREANA ISLAND, GALAPAGOS. IT HAS SINCE DISAPPEARED FROM ONE SITE AND SURVIVES IN THREE GROUPS OF PLANTS AT THE OTHER, WHERE IT HAS BEEN THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION BY INTRODUCED UNGULATES AND INVASIVE PLANTS. POPULATION SIZE, AND GROWTH RATE AND MORTALITY OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS, HAVE BEEN MONITORED SINCE 1997. THE POPULATION APPEARS HIGHLY RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN THREAT LEVELS: THE THREE PLANT GROUPS INCREASED RAPIDLY FOLLOWING PROTECTION BY FENCING AND UNGULATE CONTROL, BUT TEMPORARILY DECLINED WHEN FERAL GOAT PRESSURE INCREASED AND DURING DRY PERIODS. NATURAL FACTORS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO POPULATION LIMITATION INCLUDE DRY YEARS, GRAZING BY NATIVE SNAILS AND COMPETITION FROM NATIVE VASCULAR PLANTS AND CRYPTOGAMS. LINUM CRATERICOLA HAS A SINGLE FLOWERING PERIOD PER YEAR AND PRODUCES ABUNDANT SEED WITH 28\% GERMINATION AFTER SCARIFICATION, BUT WITH NO OBVIOUS ADAPTATIONS FOR LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL. POTENTIAL POLLINATORS INCLUDED THE BUTTERFLY LEPTOTES PARRHASIOIDES, THE HOVERFLY TOXOMERUS CROCKERI AND THE CARPENTER BEE XYLOCOPA DARWINII, ALL ENDEMIC TO GALAPAGOS. THE CONTINUED SURVIVAL OF L.

ECOL.,"ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY REASONS TO EXPECT DISTINCT POLLINATOR TYPES TO DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT A PLANT'S REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, FEW STUDIES HAVE DIRECTLY EXAMINED THIS QUESTION. HERE, WE CONTRAST THE IMPACT OF TWO KINDS OF POLLINATORS ON REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS VIA MALE AND FEMALE FUNCTIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE, AQUILEGIA COERULEA. WE SET UP POLLINATOR EXCLUSION TREATMENTS IN EACH OF THREE PATCHES WHERE AQUILEGIA PLANTS WERE VISITED BY EITHER DAY POLLINATORS (MAJORITY BUMBLE BEES), BY EVENING POLLINATORS (HAWKMOTHS), OR BY BOTH (CONTROL). DAY POLLINATORS COLLECTED POLLEN AND GROOMED, WHEREAS EVENING POLLINATORS COLLECTED NECTAR BUT DID NOT GROOM. MATERNAL PARENTS, POTENTIAL FATHERS AND PROGENY ARRAYS WERE GENOTYPED AT FIVE MICROSATELLITE LOCI. WE ESTIMATED FEMALE OUTCROSSING RATE AND COUNTED SEEDS TO MEASURE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND USED PATERNITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. OUR RESULTS DOCUMENT THAT BUMBLE BEES FREQUENTLY MOVED POLLEN AMONG PATCHES OF PLANTS AND THAT, UNLIKE HAWKMOTHS, POLLEN MOVED BY BUMBLE BEES SIRED MORE OUTCROSSED SEEDS WHEN IT REMAINED WITHIN A PATCH AS OPPOSED TO MOVING BETWEEN PATCHES. POLLINATOR TYPE DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECTED THE OUTCROSSING RATE BUT NOT SEED SET, THE NUMBER OF OUTCROSSED SEEDS OR OVERALL MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. MULTIPLE VISITS TO A PLANT AND MORE FREQUENT VISITS BY BUMBLE BEES COULD HELP TO EXPLAIN THE LACK OF IMPACT OF POLLINATOR TYPE ON OVERALL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THE INCREASE IN SELFING RATE WITH HAWKMOTHS LIKELY RESULTED FROM THE ABUNDANT POLLEN AVAILABLE IN EXPERIMENTAL FLOWERS.

PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO L.) HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO BE SERVED BY WILD POLLINATORS BECAUSE OF A RELIABLE AND WIDESPREAD GROUP OF BEE SPECIES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR FLOWERS, INCLUDING BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.), AND, IN THE AMERICAS, TWO GENERA OF SPECIALIST GROUND NESTING BEES (PEPONAPIS AND XENOGLOSSA). WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL KEY FAT-M MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ON BEE ABUNDANCE IN PUMPKIN ON 20 FARMS IN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND DURING SUMMER 2006. WE EVALUATED BEE ABUNDANCE WITH RESPECT TO TILLAGE, IRRIGATION PRACTICES, SOIL PROPERTIES, NATURAL HABITAT (FOREST AND GRASSLAND), FLOWERING CROP, AND DISTURBED AREAS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINED NEST SITE PREFERENCE (WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF CROP AREAS) OF PEPONAPIS PRUINOSA (SAY) AT ONE FARM AND IN A LARGE SCREENHOUSE. WE FOUND P. PRUINOSA NESTING PREFERENTIALLY WITHIN CROP AREAS AND NEAR THE VINES AND LEAVES OF THEIR HOST PLANT. ALTHOUGH THESE BEES TYPICALLY PLACE SOME OF THEIR BROOD CELLS WITHIN TILLAGE DEPTH, WE DID NOT FIND A TILLAGE EFFECT ON THEIR ABUNDANCE AT FLOWERS. WE FOUND A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SOIL CLAY CONTENT (R-2=0.24, P=0.03) AND A POSITIVE EFFECT OF IRRIGATION (F-1,F- 15=12.2, P < 0.001) ON P. PRUINOSA ABUNDANCE.

THE PRESENCE OF THESE SPECIES IN NEW ZEALAND PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY THEIR ECOLOGY IN A CONTRASTING ENVIRONMENT. FORAGE VISITS MADE BY BUMBLEBEES IN NEW ZEALAND WERE RECORDED ACROSS A SEASON.

DECREASING HABITAT QUALITY AND QUANTITY CAUSED BY FRAGMENTATION MAY LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND TO A REDUCTION IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IN PLANT SPECIES. WE CONDUCTED A 6-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SMALL-SCALE FRAGMENTATION ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND GENETIC DIVERSITY IN THE SELF-COMPATIBLE BETONICA OFFICINALIS. WE EXAMINED THE ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS, THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES AND THE PERFORMANCE, OUTCROSSING RATE AND GENETIC DIVERSITY OF B. OFFICINALIS AFTER 2 AND 6 YEARS IN EXPERIMENTALLY FRAGMENTED NUTRIENT-POOR, CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND IN THE NORTHERN SWISS JURA MOUNTAINS. FRAGMENTS OF DIFFERENT SIZE (2.25 AND 20.25 M(2)) WERE ISOLATED BY A 5-M-WIDE STRIP OF FREQUENTLY MOWN VEGETATION. CONTROL PLOTS OF CORRESPONDING SIZE WERE SITUATED IN ADJACENT UNDISTURBED GRASSLAND. EXPERIMENTAL GRASSLAND FRAGMENTATION ALTERED THE COMPOSITION OF B. OFFICINALIS POLLINATORS AND REDUCED THEIR FLOWER VISITATION RATE. FURTHERMORE, THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES WAS CHANGED IN THE FRAGMENTS. AFTER 6 YEARS OF FRAGMENTATION SEED WEIGHT WAS HIGHER IN FRAGMENTS THAN IN CONTROL PLOTS. HOWEVER, THE DENSITIES OF B. OFFICINALIS ROSETTES AND INFLORESCENCES, PLANT HEIGHT AND INFLORESCENCE LENGTH WERE NOT AFFECTED BY FRAGMENTATION. THE OUTCROSSING FREQUENCY OF B. OFFICINALIS GROWING IN FRAGMENTS WAS REDUCED BY 15\% AFTER 2 YEARS AND BY 33\% AFTER 6 YEARS OF EXPERIMENTAL FRAGMENTATION. THIS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE GENETIC DIVERSITY IN SEEDLINGS EMERGING IN FRAGMENTS AFTER 6 YEARS. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT SMALL-SCALE HABITAT FRAGMENTATION CAN DISTURB THE INTERACTION BETWEEN B. OFFICINALIS AND POLLINATORS RESULTING IN A REDUCED OUTCROSSING FREQUENCY AND GENETIC DIVERSITY IN PLANTS GROWING IN FRAGMENTS. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE TO FRAGMENTATION WAS CONSIDERABLY DELAYED.

RANDS SA;WHITNEY HM,RANDS SA,EFFECTS OF POLLINATOR DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES ON FIELD MARGIN VISITATIONS IN THE MIDST OF AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES: A MODELLING APPROACH,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,ECOL. MODEL.,"MANAGED FIELD MARGINS OFFER A MEANS OF REDUCING THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES WITHIN INTENSIVELY MANAGED ENVIRONMENTS. BY PROVIDING REFUGE FOR WILD PLANTS AND THE POLLINATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, FIELD MARGINS CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ENHANCING THE POLLINATION SERVICES WITHIN THE MONOCULTURE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE MONOCULTURE ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR NEED TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. IT IS KNOWN THAT POLLINATORS MAY SHOW DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES SUCH AS NEOPHOBIA (AN AVOIDANCE OF UNFAMILIAR ITEMS) WHEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOWER ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN THEIR ENVIRONMENT, AND THE DOMINANCE OF MONOCULTURE CROPS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT MAY CONSEQUENTLY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS UPON THE PREFERENCES SHOWN BY POLLINATORS LIVING IN THE FIELD MARGINS WITHIN THEM. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE HOW POLLINATOR PREFERENCES FOR WILD FLOWERS ARE AFFECTED BY MONOCULTURES, WE MODELLED THE EFFECTS OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES, FLOWER DENSITIES, AND THE GEOMETRY OF FIELD MARGINS WITHIN A MONOCULTURE LANDSCAPE USING NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. THIS WAS DONE BY CONSIDERING HOW THE PLACEMENT OF POLLINATOR NESTS WITHIN A SIMPLE, SPATIALLY EXPLICIT LANDSCAPE CONSISTING OF FIELDS OF MONOCULTURE CROPS SEPARATED BY MARGINS CONTAINING WILD FLOWERS AFFECTED THE RATIO OF WILD AND MONOCULTURE CROPS EXPERIENCED BY THE POLLINATOR, GIVEN THAT IT COULD ONLY FORAGE WITHIN A LIMITED DISTANCE FROM ITS NEST. INCREASING FIELD MARGIN WIDTH AND DECREASING MONOCULTURE FIELD WIDTH BOTH LED TO AN INCREASE IN POLLINATORS VISITING WILD FLOWERS (WHICH LEVELLED OFF AS WIDTH INCREASED). THE SIZE OF THE MONOCULTURE FIELDS HAD LITTLE ADDITIONAL EFFECT ONCE THEY HAD PASSED AN INTERMEDIATE WIDTH. INCREASING WILD FLOWER DENSITY WITHIN THE MARGINS LED TO A SHIFT AWAY FROM PREFERRING MONOCULTURES. WHEN WILD FLOWERS WERE AT LOW DENSITIES COMPARED TO THE MONOCULTURE, EVEN THE ADDITION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF EXTRA WILD FLOWERS HAD A LARGE EFFECT IN SHIFTING FORAGING PREFERENCES AWAY FROM THE MONOCULTURE. THE DISTANCE WHICH POLLINATORS NORMALLY FORAGE OVER ONLY HAS AN EFFECT UPON PREFERENCES FOR WILD FLOWERS WHEN THE TRAVEL DISTANCE IS SMALL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF MARGIN DESIGN MIGHT BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE SPECIES WHICH DO NOT TRAVEL FAR. INNATE PREFERENCES FOR DENSITY-DEPENDENCE AND PARTICULAR CROP TYPES MAY ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON PREFERENCE BEHAVIOUR. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH RESOURCES ARE PRESENTED TO INDIGENOUS POLLINATORS MAY BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN INFLUENCING WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO FORAGE WITHIN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. CAREFUL MARGIN DESIGN, AS WELL AS INCREASING THE DENSITY OF WILD FLOWERS (SUCH AS BY ENHANCING THE WILD SEED BANK WITHIN THE MARGINS), MAY LEAD TO OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION WITHIN INTENSIVELY FARMED MONOCULTURES.

SCI.,"BACKGROUND: THIS PROJECT ASSESSED THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS OF DIFFERENT CLASSICAL AND NOVEL ACARICIDES AGAINST AN IMPORTANT NON-TARGET AND BENEFICIAL INSECT FOR THE POLLINATION OF WILD FLOWERS AND CULTIVATED CROPS, THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L). TWENTY-THREE ACARICIDES USED COMMERCIALLY IN THE CONTROL OF PHYTOPHAGOUS MITES (ACARI) WERE TESTED IN GREENHOUSES AND/OR THE OPEN FIELD. SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDED ACUTE MORTALITY AND ALSO SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON NEST REPRODUCTION. THE DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS WERE ADMINISTERED IN THE LABORATORY VIA THREE DIFFERENT WORST-CASE FIELD SCENARIO ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: DERMAL CONTACT AND ORALLY VIA THE DRINKING OF TREATED SUGAR WATER AND VIA TREATED POLLEN. THE COMPOUNDS WERE TESTED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM FIELD RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATION (MFRC), AND, WHEN STRONG LETHAL EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED, A DOSE-RESPONSE ASSAY WITH A DILUTION SERIES OF THE MFRC WAS UNDERTAKEN TO CALCULATE LC50 VALUES. RESULTS: FROM THE DIFFERENT ACARICIDE CLASSES, SEVERAL CHEMISTRIES CAUSED HIGH LEVELS OF ACUTE TOXICITY IN BUMBLEBEE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY BIFENTHRIN AND ABAMECTIN WHICH RESULTED IN 100\% MORTALITY BY CONTACT. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL ACARICIDES TESTED WERE FOUND TO HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON DRONE PRODUCTION. FOR ORAL EXPOSURES VIA TREATED SUGAR WATER, THE DOSE-RESPONSE ASSAY SHOWED THE LC50 VALUES FOR ABAMECTIN, BIFENAZATE, BIFENTHRIN AND ETOXAZOLE TO BE 1/15 MFRC (1.17 MG AL L-1), 1/10 MFRC (9.6 MG AL L-1), 1/83 MFRC (0.36 MG AL L-1) AND 1/13 MFRC (4.4 MG AL L-1) RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING THAT THEIR USE SHOULD BE CAREFULLY EVALUATED. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOST OF THE ACARICIDES TESTED ARE COMPATIBLE WITH BUMBLEBEES, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF ABAMECTIN, BIFENAZATE, BIFENTHRIN AND ETOXAZOLE. HOWEVER, THE RISKS ALSO DEPENDED ON THE TYPE OF TREATMENT. AS A RESULT, THE SUGAR WATER TREATMENT SEEMS TO PRESENT THE WORST-CASE SITUATION OF EXPOSURE, INDICATING THAT THIS APPROACH IS SUITABLE FOR DETERMINING THE HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES AGAINST BUMBLEBEES. FINALLY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT FUTURE TIER TESTING UNDER MORE FIELD-RELATED CONDITIONS IS REQUIRED FOR A FINAL DECISION OF THEIR RISKS.

APPL. ECOL.,"1. WE HAVE LITTLE IDEA HOW LANDSCAPE-SCALE FACTORS INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF WILD BUMBLEBEE NESTS OVER TIME. HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME WE USE MOLECULAR MARKERS TO ESTIMATE WITHIN-SEASON CHANGES IN THE NUMBERS OF NESTS. 2. WORKERS OF TWO BUMBLEBEE SPECIES WERE SAMPLED IN AN ARABLE LANDSCAPE IN LATE MAY-JUNE AND LATE JULY-AUGUST, AND THE NUMBERS OF NESTS REPRESENTED IN EACH SAMPLE WERE ESTIMATED. WE COMPARE THE METHODS AVAILABLE TO ESTIMATE NEST NUMBER FROM SUCH SAMPLES AND CONCLUDE THAT METHODS WHICH ALLOW FOR HETEROGENEITY IN THE PROBABILITY OF CAPTURE OF NESTS PROVIDE THE BEST FIT TO OUR DATA. CHANGES IN NUMBERS OF NESTS AT THE TWO TIME POINTS WERE USED TO INFER NEST SURVIVAL. 3. THE TWO BEE SPECIES APPEARED TO DIFFER MARKEDLY IN SURVIVAL OVER TIME, WITH ESTIMATES OF 45\% OF NESTS SURVIVING FOR BOMBUS LAPIDARIUS AND 91\% FOR B. PASCUORUM. HOWEVER, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT THE FORAGING RANGE OF B. PASCUORUM MAY BE GREATER IN LATE SEASON, WHICH WOULD LEAD US TO OVERESTIMATE NEST SURVIVAL IN THIS SPECIES. DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL MAY ALSO REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN PHENOLOGY BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIES. 4. THE LAND USE CLASS WHICH HAD THE MOST CONSISTENT EFFECTS ON NEST NUMBER AND SURVIVAL WAS GARDENS, FOR B. LAPIDARIUS, THE AREA OF GARDENS WITHIN A 750 AND 1000 MRADIUS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED NEST SURVIVAL, WHILE FOR B. PASCUORUM, THE NUMBER OF NESTS IN LATE SAMPLES WAS HIGHER AT SITES WITH MORE GARDENS WITHIN A 500 AND 750-M RADIUS. FOR B. PASCUORUM, THE AREA OF GRASSLAND WITHIN A 250 AND 500-MRADIUS ALSO POSITIVELY INFLUENCED NEST NUMBER IN LATE SAMPLES, PROBABLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE PREFERRED NESTING HABITAT FOR THIS SPECIES. 5. THE IMPORTANCE OF GARDENS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES WHICH SUGGEST THAT THEY NOW PROVIDE A STRONGHOLD FOR BUMBLEBEES IN AN OTHERWISE IMPOVERISHED AGRICULTURAL ENVIRONMENT, FURTHERMORE, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF GARDENS ON BUMBLEBEE POPULATIONS CAN SPILL OVER AT LEAST 1 KM INTO SURROUNDING FARMLAND. 6.

HOWEVER, CURRENTLY THE STUDIES ARE CLUMPED BOTH TAXONOMICALLY (MAINLY PACHYCEREEAE SPECIES) AND GEOGRAPHICALLY (MAINLY IN THE TEHUACAN VALLEY AND THE SONORAN DESERT). THIS CLUMPING LIMITS THE POSSIBILITY OF GENERALISING THE PATTERN TO OTHER REGIONS OR CACTUS TRIBES. ONLY FOUR OF THE 36 CHIROPTEROPHILOUS CACTI IN PILOSOCEREUS HAVE BEEN STUDIED. DESPITE THE TROPICAL DISTRIBUTION OF TWO PILOSOCEREUS SPECIES, BEES ACCOUNT FOR 40-100\% OF THEIR FRUIT SET. WE EXAMINED HOW SPECIALISED IS THE POLLINATION SYSTEM OF P. LEUCOCEPHALUS IN EASTERN MEXICO. AS WE STUDIED TROPICAL POPULATIONS, WE EXPECTED A BAT-SPECIALISED POLLINATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES OF PILOSOCEREUS SUGGEST THAT A GENERALISED POLLINATION SYSTEM IS ALSO POSSIBLE. WE FOUND THAT THIS CACTUS IS MAINLY BAT-POLLINATED (BATS ACCOUNT FOR 33-65\% OF FRUIT SET), ALTHOUGH TO A LESSER DEGREE, DIURNAL VISITORS ALSO CAUSED SOME FRUIT SET (7-15\%). DIURNAL VISITORS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN POPULATIONS CONTAINING HONEYBEE HIVES. P. LEUCOCEPHALUS IS PARTIALLY SELF-COMPATIBLE (14-18\% OF FRUCTIFICATION) BUT UNABLE TO SET FRUIT WITHOUT VISITORS. DESPITE THE VARIATION IN POLLINATION SYSTEM, P. LEUCOCEPHALUS SHOWS MORE AFFINITY WITH OTHER COLUMNAR CACTI FROM TROPICAL REGIONS THAN WITH THOSE FROM EXTRATROPICAL REGIONS.

INSECTICIDAL BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS (BT) COTTON IS PLANTED ON MILLIONS OF HECTARES ANNUALLY AND IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF TRANSGENE FLOW. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: HERE WE MONITORED 15 NON-BT COTTON (GOSSYPIUM HIRSUTUM, L.) SEED PRODUCTION FIELDS (SOME TRANSGENIC FOR HERBICIDE RESISTANCE, SOME NOT) FOR GENE FLOW OF THE BT COTTON CRY1AC TRANSGENE. WE INVESTIGATED SEED-MEDIATED GENE FLOW, WHICH YIELDS ADVENTITIOUS BT COTTON PLANTS, AND POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW, WHICH GENERATES OUTCROSSED SEEDS. A SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF NEARBY BT AND NON-BT COTTON FIELDS AT VARIOUS SPATIAL SCALES, ALONG WITH THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND ADVENTITIOUS BT PLANTS IN FIELDS, ON POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW. ADVENTITIOUS BT COTTON PLANTS, RESULTING FROM SEED BAGS AND PLANTING ERROR, COMPRISED OVER 15\% OF PLANTS SAMPLED FROM THE EDGES OF THREE SEED PRODUCTION FIELDS. IN CONTRAST, POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW AFFECTED LESS THAN 1\% OF THE SEED SAMPLED FROM FIELD EDGES. VARIATION IN OUTCROSSING WAS BETTER EXPLAINED BY THE AREA OF BT COTTON FIELDS WITHIN 750 M OF THE SEED PRODUCTION FIELDS THAN BY THE AREA OF BT COTTON WITHIN LARGER OR SMALLER SPATIAL SCALES. VARIATION IN OUTCROSSING WAS ALSO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF HONEY BEES. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: A COMPARISON OF STATISTICAL METHODS SHOWED THAT OUR SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT ANALYSIS WAS MORE POWERFUL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF SURROUNDING FIELDS THAN CUSTOMARY MODELS BASED ON DISTANCE. GIVEN THE LOW RATES OF POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW OBSERVED IN THIS STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT CAREFUL PLANTING AND SCREENING OF SEEDS COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN FIELD SPACING FOR LIMITING GENE FLOW.",NA,GENE FLOW; BRASSICA-NAPUS; CONTAMINATION; RESISTANCE; MAIZE; POLLINATION; DISPERSAL; REFUGES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,39,"HEUBERGER, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ENTOMOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.;HEUBERGER, SHANNON, ELLERS-KIRK, CHRISTA, TABASHNIK, BRUCE E., CARRIERE, YVES, UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ENTOMOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0014128,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",E14128,WESTERN REGION SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (WSARE) [GW07-004]; ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY [FP 916819]; COTTON FOUNDATION; COTTON INC.; NATIONAL COTTON COUNCIL; MONSANTO; DOW AGROSCIENCES,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY WESTERN REGION SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (WSARE) GRADUATE STUDENT FELLOW'S GRANT IN SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE, GRANT NUMBER GW07-004 (HTTP://WSARE.USU.EDU/) AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) SCIENCE TO ACHIEVE RESULTS (STAR) FELLOWSHIP, NUMBER FP 916819 (HTTP://WWW.EPA.GOV/NCER/FELLOW/).

WE EXAMINED HOW PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PLANT DIVERSITY, NESTING SUITABILITY, CANOPY COVER, LAND USE, AND FIRE HISTORY AFFECTED BEE DISTRIBUTION ACROSS AN OPEN-FOREST GRADIENT IN NORTHWEST INDIANA, USA, A GRADIENT SIMILAR TO THE HISTORIC MIDWEST UNITED STATES LANDSCAPE MOSAIC. WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THE OTHER PREDICTORS, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. BEE ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CANOPY COVER AND POSITIVELY TO RECENT FIRE FREQUENCY, BEE RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF POTENTIAL NESTING RESOURCES, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS, SOIL CHARACTERISTICS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO NESTING SUITABILITY, AND CANOPY COVER. THUS, BEE ABUNDANCE WAS PREDICTED BY A DIFFERENT SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN WAS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS PREDICTED, IN LARGE PART, BY A COMBINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. DIFFERENCES IN BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION ALONG THE WOODY VEGETATION GRADIENT WERE CORRELATED WITH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF OLIGOLECTIC, OR DIET SPECIALIST, BEES. BECAUSE OLIGOLEGES WERE RARER THAN DIET GENERALISTS AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN HABITATS, THEIR POPULATIONS MAY BE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY DEGRADATION OF OPEN HABITATS. MORE HABITAT-SPECIALIST BEES WERE DOCUMENTED FOR OPEN AND FOREST/SCRUB HABITATS THAN FOR SAVANNA/WOODLAND HABITATS, CONSISTENT WITH BEES RESPONDING TO HABITATS OF INTERMEDIATE WOODY VEGETATION DENSITY, SUCH AS SAVANNAS, AS ECOTONES RATHER THAN AS DISTINCT HABITAT TYPES. SIMILARITY OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, SIMILARITY OF BEE ABUNDANCE, AND SIMILARITY OF BEE RICHNESS BETWEEN SITES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PROXIMITY OF SITES TO EACH OTHER. NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SPECIES COMPOSITION IN SPECIES-POOR SITES WAS NOT MERELY A SUBSET OF SPECIES COMPOSITION AT RICHER SITES. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT PROXIMITY OR NESTEDNESS EFFECTS SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS AT A SMALL SPATIAL SCALE STRONGLY INFLUENCE BEES' USE OF SITES.

UNDERSTANDING HOW FORAGING DECISIONS TAKE PLACE AT THE LOCAL SCALE IS RELEVANT BECAUSE THEY MAY DIRECTLY AFFECT THE FITNESS OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW LOCAL DIVERSITY AND DENSITY AFFECT THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF MOST POLLINATOR GROUPS. 2. BY INTRODUCING TWO POTTED PLANT SPECIES (SALVIA FARINACAE AND TAGETES BONANZA) INTO TWO POPULATIONS OF TARAXACUM OFFICINALE, WE INVESTIGATED HOW PLANT IDENTITY, THE MIXTURES OF THESE PLANT SPECIES, AND TOTAL PLANT DENSITY AFFECTED THE ATTRACTION TO AND THE FORAGING WITHIN A PATCH FOR SIX POLLINATOR GROUPS. 3. THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PREFERRED PLANT SPECIES, AND SECONDLY BY PATCH DIVERSITY AND DENSITY. IN GENERAL, DENSE PATCHES AND THOSE CONTAINING THE THREE-SPECIES MIXTURE WERE PREFERRED BY ALL INSECT GROUPS FOR ARRIVAL, ALTHOUGH MUSCOID AND HOVER FLIES RESPONDED LESS TO LOCAL FLORAL COMPOSITION THAN BEES. LOCAL DIVERSITY AND DENSITY HAD, HOWEVER, A WEAKER EFFECT ON FORAGING BEHAVIOUR WITHIN PATCHES. SITE DEPENDENCE IN RESPONSE TO FLORAL TREATMENTS COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SITES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE AND TARAXACUM DENSITY. 4.

SEEMANNIA SYLVATICA IS AN HERB THAT OCCURS IN DENSE POPULATIONS IN THE RIVERBEDS AT SERRA DA BODOQUENA. GOALS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO REPORT THE FLORAL BIOLOGY (ON THE FIRST FIVE DAYS OF ANTHESIS), AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND THE POLLINATORS OF S. SYLVATICA. DATA COLLECTION WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE 2005 TO JULY 2006 THROUGH MONTHLY FIELD TRIPS, LASTING FOR FIVE DAYS. DATA ON FLORAL BIOLOGY, BREEDING SYSTEM AND ON THE FLORAL VISITORS WERE TAKEN FROM INDIVIDUALS LOCATED ALONG A TRACK 2500 M LONG, IN RIPARIAN FOREST OF SALOBRINHA RIVER. FLOWERS OF S. SYLVATICA ARE TUBULAR, RED, WITH NO PERCEPTIVE ODOR AND LASTED MORE THAN FIVE DAYS (CA. 10 - 20 DAYS IN INDIVIDUALS TRANSFERRED TO AN URBAN GARDEN AND KEPT IN VASES). SEEMANIA SYLVATICA IS PROTANDROUS, AND THE MALE PHASE OCCURRED BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE FOURTH DAYS OF ANTHESIS, WHILE THE FEMALE ONE STARTED IN THE FIFTH DAY. MEAN NECTAR VOLUME SECRETED WAS 4.77 +/- 3.2 MU L, WITH A SIGNIFICATIVE VARIATION AMONG FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT AGES. OTHERWISE, NECTAR CONCENTRATION AVERAGE WAS 9.71 +/- 4.41\%, AND DID NOT VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY IN FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT AGES. THE FLOWERS OF S. SYLVATICA WERE POLLINATED MAINLY BY THE HUMMINGBIRDS PHAETHOMIS PRETREI AND THALURANIA FURCATA, AND PIERCED BY THE BEE CERATINA CLITORIS. THE BUTTERFLY PARIDES ANCHISES ORBYGNIANUS WAS CONSIDERED AN OCCASIONAL POLLINATOR OF THESE FLOWERS. SEEMANNIA SYLVATICA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE, SINCE FRUIT SET OCCURRED ON THE EXPERIMENTS OF SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION, MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION, CROSS-POLLINATION AND OPEN POLLINATION (CONTROL). THE PROTANDRY, COUPLED WITH THE PATTERN OF NECTAR PRODUCTION, CHARACTERIZED BY LOW VOLUME AND SOLUTE CONCENTRATION, WHICH INDUCES THE POLLINATORS TO VISIT DIFFERENT FLOWERS IN A GIVEN CIRCUIT FORAGING, ACT MAXIMIZING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CROSS-POLLINATION IN S.,SYLVATICA. MOREOVER, THE HIGH PROPORTION OF FRUIT SET BY AUTOGAMY IS AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY CONSIDERING THAT S. SYLVATICA IS VISITED BY FEW SPECIES, BEING POLLINATED MAINLY BY P. PRETREI.

QUEENS EXHIBITED LESS FREQUENT FLOWER VISITS, LONGER FLIGHT DISTANCES BETWEEN INFLORESCENCES, AND A SMALLER NUMBER OF SEQUENTIAL INFLORESCENCE VISITS WITHIN PATCHES THAN DID WORKER BEES. FLOWERING IN EARLY-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS OCCURRED IN JUNE, WHEN ONLY OVERWINTERED QUEENS WERE AVAILABLE, WHILE FLOWERING IN LATE-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS OCCURRED FROM LATE JULY TO AUGUST, WHEN FREQUENT VISITS BY WORKERS WERE COMMON. THE FRUIT TO FLOWER RATIO PER INFLORESCENCE WAS LOWER IN EARLY-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS DUE TO QUANTITATIVE POLLEN LIMITATION, WHILE THE SEED TO OVULE RATIO PER FRUIT WAS LOWER IN LATE-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE GEITONOGAMOUS POLLINATION BY WORKERS WAS COMMON LATER IN THE SEASON, WHICH RESULTED IN A HIGH ABORTION RATE OF SELF-POLLINATED SEEDS, THAT IS, QUALITATIVE POLLEN LIMITATION.

SCI. U. S. A.,"COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY MODELS, USUALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR FOOD WEBS, ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES ARE FORMED. HOWEVER, MODELS FOR MUTUALISTIC COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY ARE STILL NEEDED, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE COMMUNITIES ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES THAT AFFECT THEIR BIODIVERSITY. HERE, WE PRESENT A UNIQUE NETWORK MODEL THAT SIMULATES THE COLONIZATION AND EXTINCTION PROCESS OF MUTUALISTIC COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. WE GENERATE REGIONAL SOURCE POOLS OF SPECIES INTERACTION NETWORKS ON THE BASIS OF STATISTICAL PROPERTIES REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE. WE DEVELOP A DYNAMIC SYNCHRONOUS BOOLEAN FRAMEWORK TO SIMULATE, WITH FEW FREE PARAMETERS, THE DYNAMICS OF NEW MUTUALISTIC COMMUNITY FORMATION FROM THE REGIONAL SOURCE POOL. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS US TO DETERMINISTICALLY MAP OUT EVERY POSSIBLE TRAJECTORY OF COMMUNITY FORMATION. THIS LEVEL OF DETAIL IS RARELY OBSERVED IN OTHER ANALYTIC APPROACHES AND ALLOWS FOR THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF COMMUNITY FORMATION. AS FOR FOOD WEB ASSEMBLY, WE FIND THAT THE NUMBER OF STABLE COMMUNITIES IS QUITE LOW, AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOURCE POOL INFLUENCES THE ABUNDANCE AND NATURE OF COMMUNITY OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, IN CONTRAST TO FOOD WEB ASSEMBLY, STABLE MUTUALISTIC COMMUNITIES FORM RAPIDLY. SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN SPECIES PRESENCE/ABSENCE (SELF-SIMILAR LIMIT CYCLES) ARE THE MOST COMMON COMMUNITY OUTCOME.

CONSERV.,"PERIODIC WILDFIRE DEFINES PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND DYNAMICS IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S SEMI-ARID BIOMES, WHOSE CLIMATES AND FLORAS ALSO FAVOR WILD BEE DIVERSITY. INVASIVE FLAMMABLE GRASSES, DEFORESTATION, HISTORICAL FIRE SUPPRESSION AND HUMAN IGNITION ARE INCREASING FIRE FREQUENCY AND INTENSIFYING ITS SEVERITY, AS WELL AS INTRODUCING FIRE TO PREVIOUSLY FIREPROOF BIOMES. IN MANY OF THESE HABITATS, BEES ARE KEY POLLINATORS. MANY, OFTEN MOST OF THE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES AND INDIVIDUALS IN THESE BIOMES NEST UNDERGROUND (SO-CALLED ``MINING BEES). TO EVALUATE THEIR SUSCEPTIBILITY TO FIRE, WE TESTED HEAT TOLERANCES OF BEES' FOUR LIFE STAGES USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN THAT MIMICKED HEAT CONDUCTION DYNAMICS OF NATURAL SOILS. ALL LIFE STAGES SURVIVED HEATING OF UP TO 45 DEGREES C FOR 27 MIN, BUT NONE SURVIVED HEATING AT 54 DEGREES C FOR 9 MIN, THE PUPAL STAGE SURVIVED BEST. AT NEAR-LETHAL TEMPERATURES, MORE PROLONGED HEATING CAUSED MORE MORTALITY. THESE DATA WERE RELATED TO PUBLISHED STUDIES OF HEAT PENETRATION DEPTHS IN SOIL DURING FIRE AND AN EXHAUSTIVE COMPILATION OF PUBLISHED NESTING DEPTHS REPORTED FOR MINING BEES. WE CONCLUDE THAT A SMALL FRACTION (9\%) OF THE SHALLOWEST-NESTING MINING BEE SPECIES IS LIKELY TO DIE FROM SOIL HEATING BY WILDFIRE. AMONG THESE, GROUND-NESTING MEGACHILIDS (OSMIA, MEGACHILE) WILL BE MOST VULNERABLE, OWING TO THEIR SHALLOW HORIZONTAL NESTS. BECAUSE MINING BEES PREVAIL IN MOST BIOMES OF THE TEMPERATE ZONE, ANY VEGETATION REHABILITATION EFFORTS SHOULD THEREFORE EXPECT THAT BEE COMMUNITIES WILL LARGELY SURVIVE THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE, AND THEREFORE WILL NEED POLLEN AND NECTAR RESOURCES IN THE YEAR(S) AFTER FIRE.

EVOL.,"THE PLACEMENT OF THE ROOT NODE IN A PHYLOGENY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO CHARACTERIZING EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS. THE ROOT NODE OF BEE PHYLOGENY REMAINS UNCLEAR DESPITE CONSIDERABLE PREVIOUS ATTENTION. IN ORDER TO TEST ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES FOR THE LOCATION OF THE ROOT NODE IN BEES, WE USED THE F1 AND F2 PARALOGS OF ELONGATION FACTOR 1-ALPHA (EF-1 ALPHA) TO COMPARE THE TREE TOPOLOGIES THAT RESULT WHEN USING OUTGROUP VERSUS PARALOGOUS ROOTING. FIFTY-TWO TAXA REPRESENTING EACH OF THE SEVEN BEE FAMILIES WERE SEQUENCED FOR BOTH COPIES OF EF-1 ALPHA. TWO DATASETS WERE ANALYZED. IN THE FIRST (THE ``CONCATENATED DATASET), THE F1 AND F2 COPIES FOR EACH SPECIES WERE CONCATENATED AND THE TREE WAS ROOTED USING APPROPRIATE OUTGROUPS (SPHECID AND CRABRONID WASPS). IN THE SECOND DATASET (THE ``DUPLICATED DATASET), THE F1 AND F2 COPIES WERE ALIGNED TO EACH ANOTHER AND EACH COPY FOR ALL TAXA WERE TREATED AS SEPARATE TERMINALS. IN THIS DATASET, THE ROOT WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE F1 AND F2 COPIES (E.G., PARALOG ROOTING). BAYESIAN ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OUTGROUP ROOTING APPROACH OUTPERFORMS PARALOG ROOTING, RECOVERING DEEPER CLADES AND SHOWING STRONGER SUPPORT FOR GROUPS WELL ESTABLISHED BY BOTH MORPHOLOGICAL AND OTHER MOLECULAR DATA. SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO COPIES WERE COMPARED AT THE AMINO ACID LEVEL, BUT LITTLE EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO SUGGEST THAT ONE COPY IS MORE FUNCTIONALLY CONSERVED.

INSECT CONSERV.,"THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS GLOBAL DECLINES IN DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES, BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER POLLINATING INSECTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INCREASING ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES ON FARMLAND IS TO SOW SIMPLE, LOW COST MIXTURES OF DICOTYLEDONS RICH IN POLLEN AND NECTAR, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE UK AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTION FOR BUTTERFLIES ARE UNKNOWN. SIMILARLY, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON HOW TO MANAGE THIS HABITAT TO MAXIMISE THE PROVISION OF POLLEN AND NECTAR RESOURCES WHILST PROTECTING BREEDING HABITAT FOR BUTTERFLIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVISE MIXTURES AND CUTTING MANAGEMENT REGIMES WHICH ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SEED MIXTURE, TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF CUTTING, AND REMOVAL OF CUT MATERIAL ON VEGETATION COMPOSITION, FLOWER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND POLLINATORS (THE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF BUTTERFLIES AND BUMBLEBEES, INCLUDING MALES AND QUEENS, ATTRACTED TO THE MIXTURES). WE RECOMMEND THAT NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE REFINED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE BEST PERFORMING SPECIES TO PROVIDE MID- AND LATE-SEASON FORAGE RESOURCES (TRIFOLIUM SPP., LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND CENTAUREA NIGRA), AND THE REMOVAL OF COMPETITIVE GRASS SPECIES. SUMMER CUTTING IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, WITH REMOVAL OF HERBAGE WHERE POSSIBLE, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO HALF THE PATCH TO EXTEND THE FLOWERING SEASON, AND MINIMISE DAMAGE TO BUTTERFLY BREEDING HABITAT. THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE TYPICAL AUTUMN CUT TO THE WHOLE PATCH. EVEN WITH BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, SUCH NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE ONLY EFFECTIVE FOR 3-4 YEARS AND THIS SHOULD BE RECOGNISED IN POLICIES AIMED AT ENHANCING POLLINATOR POPULATIONS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.",POLLINATION; BUMBLEBEES; BUTTERFLIES; HABITAT RESTORATION; FIELD MARGINS; WILDFLOWERS; AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; POLLINATION SERVICES; FIELD MARGINS; CONSERVATION; SOWN; AGRICULTURE; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; EFFICACY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,56,"PYWELL, RF (REPRINT AUTHOR), NERC CTR ECOL \& HYDROL, WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB, OXON, ENGLAND.;PYWELL, R.

RES.,"CHANGES IN BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY WERE STUDIED ALONG A FOREST REGENERATION GRADIENT IN SEVEN SITES IN BUYANGU NATURE RESERVE, KAKAMEGA FOREST, KENYA. AT EACH SITE, 12 BELT TRANSECTS OF 100 M LENGTH AND 2 M WIDTH WERE ESTABLISHED. THE SELECTED SITES RANGED FROM RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED PRIMARY TO LATE SECONDARY FORESTS, BUSH LANDS AND THE SURROUNDING FARMING AREAS. A TOTAL OF 4,485 INDIVIDUALS WERE IDENTIFIED OUT OF 234 SPECIES OF BEE IN FOUR FAMILIES. A RENYI DIVERSITY INDEX WAS USED TO ANALYSE BEE DIVERSITY. ONE-WAY MEASURES OF ANOVA WERE CALCULATED FOR BEE DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS, WITH STUDY SITES AND YEAR AS INDEPENDENT FACTORS. THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS AND BEE DIVERSITY WERE RECORDED IN THE OPEN AREAS FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY FORESTS WHILE EVENNESS WAS HIGHER IN FORESTED SITES. THERE WAS A GENERAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN SITES IN BEE SPECIES COMPOSITION, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THOSE OF ALMOST SIMILAR VEGETATION STRUCTURE. THIS SIMILARITY WAS SUSPECTED TO HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN PROMOTING CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE OF BEES IN TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS MOST NEOTROPICAL SPECIES OF MALPIGHIACEAE PRODUCE FLORAL FATTY OILS IN CALYX GLANDS TO ATTRACT POLLINATING OIL-COLLECTING BEES, WHICH DEPEND ON THIS RESOURCE FOR REPRODUCTION. THIS SPECIALIZED TYPE OF POLLINATION SYSTEM TENDS TO BE LOST IN MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION (E.G. AFRICA) OF NEOTROPICAL OIL-COLLECTING BEES. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY, CHEMICAL ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF AN OIL FLOWER SPECIES, PTERANDRA PYROIDEA (MALPIGHIACEAE) FROM THE BRAZILIAN CERRADO. POPULATIONS OF THIS SPECIES CONSIST OF PLANTS WITH OIL-SECRETING (GLANDULAR) FLOWERS, PLANTS WITH NON-OIL-SECRETING FLOWERS (EGLANDULAR) OR A MIX OF BOTH PLANT TYPES. THIS STUDY SPECIFICALLY AIMS TO CLARIFY THE ROLE OF EGLANDULAR MORPHS IN THIS SPECIES. METHODS DATA ON POLLINATORS WERE RECORDED BY IN SITU OBSERVATIONS. BREEDING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED BY ISOLATING INFLORESCENCES AND BY ENZYMATIC REACTIONS. FLORAL RESOURCES, POLLEN AND FLORAL OILS OFFERED BY THIS SPECIES WERE ANALYSED BY STAINING AND A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS. KEY RESULTS EGLANDULAR FLOWERS OF P. PYROIDEA DO NOT ACT AS MIMICS OF THEIR OIL-PRODUCING CONSPECIFICS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS. INSTEAD, BOTH OIL-PRODUCING AND OIL-FREE FLOWERS DEPEND ON POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES FOR REPRODUCTION, AND THEIR MAIN POLLINATORS ARE BUMBLE-BEES. FLORAL OILS PRODUCED BY GLANDULAR FLOWERS ARE LESS COMPLEX THAN THOSE DESCRIBED IN CLOSELY RELATED GENERA. CONCLUSIONS EGLANDULAR FLOWERS REPRESENT A SHIFT IN THE POLLINATION SYSTEM IN WHICH OIL IS BEING LOST AND POLLEN IS BECOMING THE MAIN REWARD OF P. PYROIDEA FLOWERS. POLLINATION SHIFTS OF THIS KIND HAVE HITHERTO NOT BEEN DEMONSTRATED EMPIRICALLY WITHIN NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE AND THIS SPECIES EXHIBITS AN UNUSUAL TRANSITION FROM A SPECIALIZED TOWARDS A GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM IN AN AREA CONSIDERED THE HOTSPOT OF OIL-COLLECTING BEE DIVERSITY IN THE NEOTROPICS.

GONG YB;HUANG SQ,GONG YB,TEMPORAL STABILITY OF POLLINATOR PREFERENCE IN AN ALPINE PLANT COMMUNITY AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL TRAITS,OECOLOGIA,OECOLOGIA,"A TRADITIONAL VIEW OF DIVERSE FLORAL TRAITS IS THAT THEY REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING PREFERENCES OF POLLINATORS. THE ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL TRAITS HAS BEEN QUESTIONED RECENTLY BY BROAD COMMUNITY SURVEYS, ESPECIALLY STUDIES CONCERNING VARIATION IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES AND VISITATION FREQUENCY, WHICH SUGGEST A DIMINISHED ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN FLORAL EVOLUTION. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SIX CATEGORIES OF FLORAL TRAITS OF 29 SPECIES AND 10 POLLINATOR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS IN AN ALPINE MEADOW IN THE HENGDUAN MOUNTAINS OF CHINA, OVER THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. SIMPSON'S DIVERSITY INDEX WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF POLLINATOR GENERALIZATION OF EACH PLANT SPECIES BY CONSIDERING BOTH POLLINATOR GROUPS AND THEIR RELATIVE VISITATION FREQUENCIES. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES INDICATED THAT EIGHT OF THE TEN POLLINATOR GROUPS SHOWED CONSTANT PREFERENCES FOR AT LEAST TWO FLORAL TRAITS, LEADING TO A RELATIVELY STABLE LEVEL OF ECOLOGICAL GENERALIZATION FOR MOST FLORAL TRAITS (TWO OUT OF THREE CATEGORIES), DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE LEVEL OF GENERALIZATION OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY VARIED ACROSS YEARS. SHAPE PREFERENCES OF BUTTERFLIES, HONEYBEES AND BEEFLIES VARIED SUCH THAT OPEN FLOWERS EXHIBITED A LOWER LEVEL OF ECOLOGICAL GENERALIZATION IN 2007 THAN CLOSED FLOWERS, IN CONTRAST WITH THE OTHER 2 YEARS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT TEMPORALLY STABILIZED PREFERENCES OF DIVERSE POLLINATORS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE EVOLUTION OF SPECIALIZED VERSUS GENERALIZED FLORAL TRAITS, HOWEVER, THEIR ROLE MAY BE MODERATED BY VARIATION IN COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, INCLUDING BOTH THE COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS.",FLORAL TRAITS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; ECOLOGICAL GENERALIZATION LEVEL; GENERALIZATION AND SPECIALIZATION; VISITATION FREQUENCY,SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION; SILENE-VIRGINICA; SPECIALIZATION; SYSTEMS; FLOWER; SELECTION; NETWORK; POLLEN; SYMMETRY; VISITORS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,18,"HUANG, SQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, COLL LIFE SCI, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.;GONG, YAN-BING, HUANG, SHUANG-QUAN, WUHAN UNIV, COLL LIFE SCI, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1007/S00442-011-1910-7,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [30770135, 31030016]","WE THANK LABORATORY MEMBERS JI-FAN SUN, XIAO-XIN TANG, YANG LU, YUN-YUN MAO, CHANG-QIU LIU, QIANG FANG, CAI WEI, AND HUAN-LE LIU FOR THEIR HELP IN THE FIELD STUDY, ZHEN-DONG FANG, QIN XU, ZONG-LING MA AND ZI-QUAN PU FROM SHANGRI-LA ALPINE BOTANICAL GARDEN FOR THEIR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT, LAWRENCE D.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS THE PRESENCE OF CO-FLOWERING SPECIES CAN ALTER POLLINATOR FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND, IN TURN, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE FOCAL SPECIES. SUCH INTERACTIONS WERE INVESTIGATED BETWEEN A FOCAL SPECIES, PEDICULARIS MONBEIGIANA, AND A CO-FLOWERING SPECIES, VICIA DICHROANTHA, WHICH WAS MEDIATED BY BEHAVIOUR ALTERATION OF THE SHARED BUMBLE-BEE POLLINATOR. METHODS FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AND FLORAL COLOUR CHANGE OF P. MONBEIGIANA WERE COMPARED BETWEEN PURE (P. MONBEIGIANA ONLY) AND MIXED (P. MONBEIGIANA AND V. DICHROANTHA) PLOTS IN TWO POPULATIONS. POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES, INTERSPECIFIC FLORAL SWITCHING AND SUCCESSIVE WITHIN-PLANT POLLINATOR VISITS WERE RECORDED. IN ADDITION, SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION AT PLANT LEVEL WAS PERFORMED, AND THE FRUIT SET AND SEED SET WERE ANALYSED IN PURE AND MIXED PLOTS WITH DIFFERENT DENSITIES OF P. MONBEIGIANA. KEY RESULTS POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES WERE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER IN MIXED PLOTS THAN IN PURE PLOTS. THE HIGHER POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES WERE RECORDED IN BOTH LOW-AND HIGH-DENSITY PLOTS. IN PARTICULAR, SUCCESSIVE FLOWER VISITS WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL PLANT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN MIXED PLOTS. SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FRUIT SET AND SEED SET OF INDIVIDUALS IN PURE PLOTS, WHILE IT ONLY MARGINALLY INCREASED SEED SET PER FRUIT OF PLANTS IN MIXED PLOTS. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENCE OF V. DICHROANTHA CAN FACILITATE POLLINATION AND INCREASE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF P. MONBEIGIANA VIA BOTH QUANTITY (MITIGATING POLLINATOR LIMITATION) AND QUALITY (REDUCING GEITONOGAMY) EFFECTS.

TESTS OF ODT HAVE HOWEVER SO FAR MAINLY BEEN RESTRICTED TO LABORATORY SETTINGS. BY VIDEO SURVEILLANCE, WE GATHERED A LARGE DATA SET OF MORE THAN 2000 FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF CRAB SPIDER (MISUMENA VATIA) ENCOUNTERS WITH POTENTIAL PREY. WE THEN TESTED WHETHER THE COMPLEX ODT OR TWO SIMPLER MODELS (PREY IDENTITY AND PREY TRAITS) BEST EXPLAIN FORAGING DECISIONS. INSECT PREY WERE KILLED WITH AN AVERAGE CHANCE OF 3.5\% WHEN ALIGHTING ON AN INFLORESCENCE HARBORING A SPIDER. SPIDERS REFUSED TO ATTACK SUITABLE PREY IN 46-79\% OF ENCOUNTERS WHEN PREY WAS IN ATTACK RANGE, INDICATING AN OVER-ABUNDANCE OF PREY RELATIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE SPIDERS. REDUCTION OF OPPORTUNITIES TO CAPTURE PREY ALONG THE PREY CAPTURE SEQUENCE DIFFERED AMONG POLLINATOR GROUPS, WITH SYRPHIDS AND SOLITARY BEES SHOWING STRONG AVOIDANCE OF SPIDERS EARLY IN THE SEQUENCE AND BUMBLEBEES RESISTING THE FINAL STRIKE. SIMPLE PREY TRAITS EXPLAINED FORAGING DECISIONS BETTER THAN ODT, WHICH WAS NOT SUPPORTED. IN THE ABSENCE OF FOOD LIMITATION, OPTIMALITY DECISIONS MAY BE LESS STRINGENT. THE OVER-ABUNDANCE OF PREY INDICATES THAT, IN CONTRAST TO CURRENT THEORY, PREY ENCOUNTER RATES ARE NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR DRIVING PREDATOR FORAGING DECISIONS. OUR RESULTS ARE HIGHLY COHERENT WITH THOSE OBTAINED IN EARLIER FIELD STUDIES ON PATCH LEAVING STRATEGIES AND PREDATOR-PREY ENCOUNTERS.

THE PRESENT WORK EXAMINED THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS CAUSED BY NECTAR-ROBBING ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF SPARATTOSPERMA LEUCANTHUM. DIFFERENT MANIPULATIONS OF THE FLOWERS WERE TESTED TO DETERMINE IF FRUIT PRODUCTION WAS INFLUENCED BY THE PERFORATIONS MADE IN THE FLORAL TISSUES (DIRECT DAMAGE), AND IF THERE WERE CHANGES IN VISITATION FREQUENCIES OR IN THE BEHAVIORS OF EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS (INDIRECT DAMAGE). PERFORATIONS MADE BY NECTAR ROBBERS DID NOT LOWER THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE PLANT SPECIES STUDIED. THE BEE TRIGONA SPINIPES WAS THE MOST FREQUENT VISITOR AND CAUSED THE LARGEST PERFORATIONS IN THE CALYX AND COROLLA OF S. LEUCANTHUM. ADDITIONALLY, WE NOTED THE OCCURRENCE OF POLLEN THEFT BY THIS SAME BEE IN FLOWERS THAT HAD BEEN PROTECTED AGAINST NECTAR-ROBBING. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IF S. LEUCANTHUM HAD DEVELOPED A MECHANISM OF RESISTANCE TO ROBBERY BY T SPINIPES IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE EXPERIENCED EVEN LOWER POLLINATION LEVELS AS A RESULT OF REDUCTIONS IN THE QUANTITIES OF POLLEN AVAILABLE FOR TRANSFER BY EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF INCREASING INTENSITY OF URBAN LAND USE ON POLLINATOR DIVERSITY, FLOWER VISITATION RATES AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN DIGITALIS PURPUREA. TO THIS END, WE SET UP EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS OF D. PURPUREA IN THREE URBAN-RURAL GRADIENTS AND CONTRASTED THESE AGAINST TWO LARGE, NATURAL POPULATIONS. IN THE EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS WE QUANTIFIED THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS PER 20 MIN AND APPLIED SUPPLEMENTAL HAND-POLLINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF POLLEN LIMITATION ON FRUIT-LEVEL SEED SET. WE FOUND NO IMPACT OF URBANIZATION INTENSITY ON POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AT ALL LOCATIONS STUDIED, AND ALSO THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL POPULATIONS. REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS APPEARED, HOWEVER, POLLEN LIMITED IN ALL SITES, EVEN IN THE LARGE AND OPTIMAL REFERENCE POPULATIONS.

MODEL.,"A SUBSTANTIAL HONEYBEE DECLINE IS BEING OBSERVED WORLDWIDE. AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND LOSS OF WILD FLORAL RESOURCES RANK AMONG THE MAIN FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECLINE. LANDSCAPE ENHANCEMENT OF FLORAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEME INTENDED TO PROVIDE HONEYBEES WITH COMPENSATORY FOOD SOURCES IN INTENSIVE AGROSYSTEMS. FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY HAS RARELY BEEN EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A MODELING TOOL TO DELINEATE THE LANDSCAPE AREAS LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY OF FLORAL ENHANCEMENT SCHEMES. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROXIMITY OF SOME LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS USED BY HONEYBEES, EITHER AS FORAGING HABITAT OR AS VISUAL LANDMARK FOR ORIENTATION, MAY PARTLY DETERMINE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY. WE INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE USING RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS (RSFS), I.E. MODELS THAT AIM TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCE OF FORAGING HONEYBEES AT FLORAL PATCHES AS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENCE OF KEYSTONE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS IN THEIR PROXIMITY. HOWEVER, DECIDING WHICH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PROXIMITY OR NOT IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF SUBJECTIVITY. THE NOVELTY OF OUR APPROACH RESIDES IN ITS USE OF A DISTANCE-WEIGHTING FUNCTION TO EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR THE SPATIAL LOCATION OF SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. IN THAT RESPECT, A DISTANCE FUNCTION SHOULD BE SCALED ON MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF FORAGING ORGANISMS. HEREIN, WE INFERRED MOVEMENT PATTERNS FROM THE AUTOCORRELATIVE PROPERTIES OF HONEYBEE FORAGING ACTIVITY. THIS MODELING APPROACH WAS DEVELOPED ON PHACELIA (PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA) FIELD MARGIN STRIPS, A TYPICAL ``HONEYBEE-FRIENDLY FLORAL SCHEME. A FORAGING SURVEY CONDUCTED ON 170 PHACELIA PLOTS (2 M X 2 M) FROM 17 PHACELIA STRIPS, ALL POSITIONED WITHIN THE FORAGING RANGE OF AN EXPERIMENTAL APIARY, REVEALED THAT (I) THE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY IS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND FOREST EDGES, BUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALTERNATIVE FLORAL RESOURCES, AND THAT (II) WEIGHTING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS BY INCORPORATING A DISTANCE FUNCTION INTO MODELS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER.

VAR. OLEIFERA) IS AN IMPORTANT OILSEED CROP WHOSE CULTIVATION AREA HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ESTONIA. IT IS PREDOMINANTLY AUTOGAMOUS BUT CROSS-POLLINATION CAN HAVE SEVERAL POSITIVE EFFECTS, INCLUDING HIGHER SEED YIELD. WE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF FERTILIZATION WITH DIFFERENT FOLIAR MICROFERTILIZERS ON THE FLOWER DENSITY AND POLLEN AND NECTAR PRODUCTION OF SPRING OILSEED RAPE AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF FLOWER VISITING BEES - HONEY BEES, BUMBLE BEES AND SOLITARY BEES. FIELD EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2004 AND 2005. THE FIELD CONSISTED OF 32 PLOTS (10 M(2) EACH): CONTROL PLOTS (NO MINERAL FERTILIZERS USED), PLOTS FERTILIZED WITH THE COMPLEX FERTILIZER OPTICROP (NPK 21-08-12 + S + MG + B + CA) ALONE AND PLOTS TREATED WITH OPTICROP AND ONE OF THE SIX FOLIAR MICROFERTILIZERS (MN, S, CU, B, MG, MO). THERE WERE FOUR REPLICATES OF EACH TREATMENT. FLOWER VISITING BEES WERE COUNTED TWICE A WEEK ON SUNNY DAYS. FLOWERS WERE COUNTED AT THE SAME TIME ON AN AREA OF 1 M(2) ON EACH PLOT. NECTAR PRODUCTION BY THE FLOWERS WAS MEASURED IN THE FIELD BY INSERTING A 1 MU L CAPILLARY INTO THE COROLLA TUBE OF FLOWERS ISOLATED FOR 24 H. POLLEN GRAINS WERE COUNTED FROM PREVIOUSLY ISOLATED FLOWERS AFTER DISSOLVING THE FLOWER TISSUES. THE DENSITY OF FLOWER VISITING BEES (HONEY BEES, BUMBLE BEES AND SOLITARY BEES) ON SPRING OILSEED RAPE DEPENDED MAINLY ON FLOWER DENSITY. FERTILIZATION INCREASED NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS BUT ALSO THE AMOUNT OF NECTAR AND POLLEN PER FLOWER. ADDITIONAL FOLIAR FERTILIZATION HAD NO EFFECT EITHER ON THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS OR THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN GRAINS PER FLOWER. NECTAR PRODUCTION PER FLOWER SEEMED TO BE INHIBITED BY ADDITIONAL MANGANESE. THEREFORE, TO SECURE HIGHER NUMBER OF POLLINATORS FOR ACHIEVING HIGHER SEED YIELD AND OTHER BENEFITS DERIVING FROM CROSS-POLLINATION, SPRING OILSEED RAPE SHOULD BE GIVEN PROPER COMPLEX FERTILIZATION.

APIC. SCI.,"OSMIA RUFA AS A POLYLECTIC INSECT IS USED IN THE POLLINATION OF NUMEROUS PLANTS. THE USEFULNESS OF THIS INSECT FOR PLANT BREEDERS IS CONSIDERABLY LIMITED BECAUSE OF THE SHORT FLIGHT PERIODS OF THE INSECTS IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. IN ORDER TO BREAK THIS LIMITATION, THE WINTERING PERIOD OF THE INSECTS IN COCOONS IS ELONGATED. THE TEMPERATURE IS MAINTAINED AT 4 DEGREES C UP TO THE TIME OF PLANT BLOOMING. THIS TREATMENT DOES SHORTENS THE LIFETIME OF THE INSECTS WHICH MAY BE THE RESULT OF OXIDATIVE STRESS. SUCH RESULTS LED TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE SELECTED COMPONENTS OF ANTIOXIDATIVE SYSTEM. THESE COMPONENTS ARC: TOTAL ANTIOXIDATIVE STATUS, CONTENT OF GLUTATHIONE AND ACTIVITY OF PEROXIDASE AND GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE IN O. RUFA EMERGED IN SPRING, ACCORDING TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK, AND EMERGED IN SUMMER - AFTER ELONGATED DIAPAUSE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT DIAPAUSE ELONGATION UNPROFITABLY INFLUENCED THE ANTIOXIDATIVE SYSTEM OF A BEE. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TOTAL ANTIOXIDATIVE STATUS, AND ACTIVITY OF BOTH ANTIOIXIDATIVE ENZYMES - PEROXIDASE AND GLUTATHIONE S-TRANSFERASE, WAS NOTED. THE CHANGES IN THE GLUTATHIONE LEVEL IN TURN, WERE INSIGNIFICANT. IN OUR OPINION, THE LOWER EFFICIENCY OF ANTIOXIDATIVE SYSTEMS OF THE RED MASON BEE EMERGED IN SUMMER, MAY LIMIT THEIR RESPONSE ABILITY TO ENDO- AND EXOGENOUS FACTORS INFLUENCING OXIDATIVE STRESS.

THE MOBILITY OF POLLINATING ANIMALS IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR IMPORTANCE BUT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE INFLUENCES POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS. LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND EMBANKMENTS ARE CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND ARE IMPORTANT ARTIFICIAL HABITATS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEBATE AS TO THE FUNCTION OF THESE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AS CORRIDORS BETWEEN LARGER EXPANSES OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT SEPARATED BY URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL HABITATS. FEW STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY STUDIED INSECT FLIGHT RESPONSES TO LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. BY OBSERVING BUMBLEBEE FLIGHT BEHAVIOUR ALONG HEDGEROWS AND, BY CREATING A MEDIUM-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL ARRAY OF FLOWER PATCHES USING AN ARTIFICIAL LINEAR FEATURE, WE EXAMINED WHETHER SUCH STRUCTURES CAN ELICIT AN ORIENTED FLIGHT RESPONSE ALONG THEM AND THEREFORE FACILITATE INSECT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE. WE FOUND THAT BOTH HEDGEROWS AND ARTIFICIAL LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES CAN INFLUENCE THE FLIGHT DIRECTIONS OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.

THE OIL-COLLECTING BEE CENTRIS NITIDA, WHICH HAS RECENTLY NATURALIZED IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA, HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A NOVEL PARTICIPANT IN AN ENDEMIC SPECIALIZED MUTUALISM BETWEEN BYRSONIMA LUCIDA, A THREATENED NATIVE OIL PLANT, AND CENTRIS ERRANS, ITS SOLE NATIVE POLLINATOR. IN THIS STUDY, WE DETERMINED THE IMPACTS OF THIS NOVEL POLLINATOR ON B. LUCIDA BY ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF ITS POLLEN LIMITATIONS IN SITES WITH AND WITHOUT THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE, AS WELL AS IN NATURAL AND GARDEN SETTINGS. WE ALSO COMPARED THE KEY PROCESSES OF POLLINATION FOR BOTH OF THE CENTRIS BEE SPECIES. THE DEGREES OF POLLEN LIMITATION SUSTAINED BY B. LUCIDA WERE SIMILAR AMONG SITES WITH OR WITHOUT THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE, AND AMONG NATURAL OR GARDEN SITES. THE NATIVE OIL BEE'S VISITATION RATES (NO. OF VISITS/MINUTE/FLOWER) TO B. LUCIDA PLANTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT SITES WHERE THE INTRODUCED OIL BEES WERE PRESENT. THE NATIVE OIL BEE HAD A LOWER FORAGING RATE (NO. OF FLOWERS VISITED/MINUTE) AND WAS A LESS EFFICIENT POLLINATOR THAN THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE. THERE HAS BEEN NO OBSERVED NEGATIVE IMPACT TO EITHER THE NATIVE OIL PLANT OR BEE, THE INTRODUCED BEE IS ABSENT IN MOST NATURAL AREAS, AND IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE BEE MAY ARRIVE NATURALLY GIVEN THE TREND IN GLOBAL WARMING.

TOTAL ENVIRON.,"AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINING THE HUMAN POPULATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY CAN DIRECTLY DISRUPT ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING. ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT (ERA) AIMS TO ESTIMATE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR PARTS. CURRENT ERA PRACTICES, HOWEVER, INCORPORATE VERY LITTLE ECOLOGY AND BASE THE RISK ESTIMATES ON THE RESULTS OF STANDARD TESTS WITH SEVERAL STANDARD SPECIES. THE MAIN OBSTACLES FOR A MORE ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ERA ARE THE LACK OF CLEAR PROTECTION GOALS AND THE INHERENT COMPLEXITY OF ECOSYSTEMS THAT IS HARD TO APPROACH EMPIRICALLY. IN THIS PAPER, WE ARGUE THAT THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES FRAMEWORK OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEFINE CLEAR AND ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT PROTECTION GOALS. AT THE SAME TIME, ECOLOGICAL MODELS PROVIDE THE TOOLS TO ADDRESS ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY TO THE DEGREE NEEDED TO LINK MEASUREMENT ENDPOINTS AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, AND TO QUANTIFY SERVICE PROVISION AND POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES. WE FOCUS ON THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES RELEVANT FOR AGROECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING, INCLUDING POLLINATION, BIOCONTROL AND EUTROPHICATION EFFECTS AND PRESENT MODELING STUDIES RELEVANT FOR QUANTIFICATION OF EACH OF THE SERVICES. THE CHALLENGES OF THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES APPROACH ARE DISCUSSED AS WELL AS THE LIMITATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL MODELS IN THE CONTEXT OF ERA. A BROAD, MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DIALOG IS NECESSARY TO AID THE DEFINITION OF PROTECTION GOALS IN TERMS OF SERVICES DELIVERED BY ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR PARTS. THE NEED TO CAPTURE SPATIO-TEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS AMONG SERVICE PROVIDERS POSE CHALLENGES FOR ECOLOGICAL MODELS AS A BASIS FOR DECISION MAKING. HOWEVER, WE ARGUE THAT BOTH FIELDS ARE ADVANCING QUICKLY AND CAN PROVE VERY VALUABLE IN ACHIEVING MORE ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT ERA. (C)11 ELSEVIER B.V.

WILD RED RASPBERRY () AND BEES BENEFITTED MOST FROM THE CREATION OF CANOPY GAPS. THE COMBINATION OF INCREASED LIGHT, WARM, BARE SOILS, AND ABUNDANT NECTAR-RICH RASPBERRY FLOWERS PROBABLY CREATED IDEAL HABITAT FOR SOIL-NESTING BEES, FACTORS WHICH ARE RELATIVELY ABSENT FROM UNHARVESTED STANDS. BY CONTRAST, BEFORE LEAF-OUT, SPRING EPHEMERALS AND HIGH LIGHT-LEVELS WERE UNIVERSAL AND POLLINATORS WERE EVEN ACROSS TREATMENTS. MORE POLLINATORS WERE CAUGHT IN CANOPY GAPS THAN IN FORESTED AREAS, AND THE PROPORTION OF FERTILIZED OVULES OF SPRING BEAUTY () WAS HIGHER IN GAPS THAN IN THE FOREST, SUGGESTING THAT POLLINATORS PREFER FORAGING IN GAPS, EVEN IN SPRING.

NOVIT.,"HEREIN WE REPORT ON THE NESTING BIOLOGY OF GROUND-NESTING TRACHUSA (HETERANTHIDIUM) LARREAE (COCKERELL) FROM NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA, AN OLIGOLEGE OF CREOSOTE BUSH, LARREA TRIDENTATA (DC.) COVILLE (ZYGOPHYLLACEAE). NESTS ARE SINGLE, SLANTING, OPEN BURROWS AT THE LOWER END OF WHICH ARE HORIZONTAL CELLS LINED WITH RESIN COLLECTED FROM CREOSOTE BUSH, ALSO THE SOURCE OF THE ORANGE, MEALY-MOIST PROVISIONS. EGGS ARE PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF THE PROVISIONS, AND THE FIRST THREE INSTARS REMAIN IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE EGGS FROM WHICH THEY HATCHED. THE FOURTH INSTAR SEPARATES ITS BODY FROM THE PROVISIONS, AND ONLY THE FIFTH (FINAL LARVAL) INSTAR MOVES AROUND THE BROOD CHAMBER WHILE CONSUMING REMAINING PROVISIONS AND DEFECATING PRIOR TO COCOON SPINNING. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT MIDDORSAL BODY TUBERCLES AND AN INTEGUMENTAL BODY VESTITURE OF SHORT SETAE AND SETIFORM SPICULES RESTRICTED TO THIS INSTAR ARE ADAPTATIONS ENABLING THE MOVEMENT OF THE FIFTH INSTAR NOT ONLY OF THIS SPECIES BUT POSSIBLY THOSE OF OTHER MEGACHILINAE, ALL OF WHICH HAVE A BODY VESTITURE AND PRESUMABLY MIDDORSAL BODY TUBERCLES. THE COCOON IS SPUN AFTER MOST OF THE FECES ARE VOIDED. LIKE COCOONS OF MANY OTHER MEGACHILIDAE, IT BEARS A PRONOUNCED NIPPLE AT ITS ANTERIOR END. FROM ITS CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS BY COMPARISON WITH COCOONS OF OTHER BEE TAXA, THE NIPPLE SEEMS TO SERVE A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS: IT ENABLES EXCHANGE BETWEEN THE INTERIOR AIR OF THE COCOON AND THE EXTERNAL AMBIENT AIR, IT SCREENS OUT PARASITES AND PREDATORS FROM ATTACKING THE COCOON INHABITANT, AND IT PROBABLY REGULATES CELL HUMIDITY. EGGS ARE BRIEFLY CHARACTERIZED, AND THREE FEMALES EACH WERE FOUND TO HAVE THREE OVARIOLES PER OVARY AND TO CARRY A SINGLE MATURE OOCYTE, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS MEDIUM IN IWATA AND SAKAGAMI'S CLASSIFICATION OF EGG/MATURE OOCYTE SIZE RELATIVE TO BODY SIZE OF FEMALE.

HARGREAVES AL;HARDER LD;JOHNSON SD,HARGREAVES AL,FLORAL TRAITS MEDIATE THE VULNERABILITY OF ALOES TO POLLEN THEFT AND INEFFICIENT POLLINATION BY BEES,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS GLOBALLY, BUT ARE ALSO THE MOST COMMON POLLEN THIEVES AND CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PLANT REPRODUCTION. THE POLLINATION EFFICIENCY OF POLLEN COLLECTORS DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR VISITS TO FEMALE(-PHASE) FLOWERS, CONTACT WITH STIGMAS AND DEPOSITION OF POLLEN OF SUFFICIENT QUANTITY AND QUALITY TO FERTILIZE OVULES. HERE WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THESE COMPONENTS, AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT FLORAL AND INFLORESCENCE CHARACTERISTICS MEDIATE THE POLLINATION ROLE OF POLLEN COLLECTION BY BEES. FOR TEN ALOE SPECIES THAT DIFFER EXTENSIVELY IN FLORAL AND INFLORESCENCE TRAITS, WE EXPERIMENTALLY EXCLUDED POTENTIAL BIRD POLLINATORS TO QUANTIFY THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INSECT VISITORS TO POLLEN REMOVAL, POLLEN DEPOSITION AND SEED PRODUCTION. WE MEASURED COROLLA WIDTH AND DEPTH TO DETERMINE NECTAR ACCESSIBILITY, AND THE PHENOLOGY OF ANTHER DEHISCENCE AND STIGMA RECEPTIVITY TO QUANTIFY HERKOGAMY AND DICHOGAMY. FURTHER, WE COMPILED ALL PUBLISHED BIRD-EXCLUSION STUDIES OF ALOES, AND COMPARED INSECT POLLINATION SUCCESS WITH FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. SPECIES VARIED FROM EXCLUSIVELY INSECT POLLINATED, TO EXCLUSIVELY BIRD POLLINATED BUT SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE POLLEN THEFT BY INSECTS. NECTAR INACCESSIBILITY AND STRONG DICHOGAMY INHIBITED POLLINATION BY POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES BY DISCOURAGING VISITS TO FEMALE-PHASE (I.E. POLLENLESS) FLOWERS. FOR SPECIES WITH LARGE INFLORESCENCES OF POLLEN-RICH FLOWERS, POLLEN COLLECTORS SUCCESSFULLY DEPOSITED POLLEN, BUT OF SUCH LOW QUALITY (PROBABLY SELF-POLLEN) THAT THEY MADE ALMOST NO CONTRIBUTION TO SEED SET. INDEED, CONSIDERING ALL PUBLISHED BIRD-EXCLUSION STUDIES (17 SPECIES IN TOTAL), INSECT POLLINATION EFFICIENCY VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH FLORAL SHAPE.

HOWEVER, POLLINATION WEBS TYPICALLY TREAT ALL INTERACTIONS AS EQUAL, AND WE CONTEND THAT THIS METHOD MAY PROVIDE MISLEADING RESULTS. USING EMPIRICAL AND THEORETICAL DATA, WE PRESENT THE CASE STUDY OF A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE HERB IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS VISITED BY A POLLINATOR CANNOT BE USED AS A SURROGATE FOR THE TOTAL EFFECT OF A POLLINATOR ON A PLANT DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN PER-VISIT EFFECTIVENESS AT PRODUCING SEEDS. IN SELF-INCOMPATIBLE SPECIES, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INTERACTION FREQUENCY AND PER-INTERACTION EFFECT MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY NEGATIVE AS MORE FLOWERS PER PLANT ARE VISITED DUE TO GEITONOGAMOUS POLLEN TRANSFER. WE FOUND THAT POLLINATORS MAKING LONGER BOUTS (I.E. VISITING MORE FLOWERS PER PLANT VISIT) HAD AN OVERALL HIGHER POLLINATION SUCCESS PER BOUT. HOWEVER, PER-INTERACTION EFFECTS TENDED TO DECREASE AS THE BOUT PROGRESSED, PARTICULARLY FOR POLLINATORS THAT CAUSE HIGHER POLLEN DEPOSITION. SINCE THE SAME INTERACTION FREQUENCY MAY RESULT FROM DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS OF NUMBER OF BOUTS (PLANT VISITS) AND BOUT LENGTH (FLOWERS VISITED/BOUT), POLLINATORS MAKING REPEATEDLY SHORTER BOUTS MAY CONTRIBUTE MORE TO PLANT REPRODUCTION FOR THE SAME NUMBER OF FLOWERS VISITED. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS OF DIFFERENT INSECT TYPES MAY BE OVERRIDDEN BY THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS, EVEN IF THE SAME POLLINATORS CONSISTENTLY INTERACT MORE FREQUENTLY. WE DISCUSS TWO PREDICTIONS REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF USING INTERACTION FREQUENCY AS A SURROGATE FOR PLANT SEED PRODUCTION (AS A MEASURE OF TOTAL EFFECT), DEPENDING ON THE DEGREE OF SELF-COMPATIBILITY, PLANT SIZE AND FLORAL DISPLAY.

BEHAV.,"FLORAL SIGNALS ARE TYPICALLY EMITTED ACROSS MULTIPLE SENSORY MODALITIES, ALTHOUGH WHY THEY ARE MULTIMODAL IS UNCLEAR. ONE POSSIBLE EXPLANATION IS THAT MULTIMODAL SIGNALLING ENSURES THAT AT LEAST ONE SIGNAL COMPONENT WILL BE TRANSMITTED EFFECTIVELY UNDER VARYING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS (THE `EFFICACY BACKUP' HYPOTHESIS). FOR EXAMPLE, BY TRANSMITTING BOTH COMPONENT A AND B, A SIGNALLER CAN COMMUNICATE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WHERE TRANSMISSION OF COMPONENT A IS REDUCED, COMPONENT B `BACKS UP' A. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE DETERMINED WHETHER A FLORAL SCENT COULD BACK UP A FLORAL COLOUR SIGNAL WHEN LIGHT LEVELS WERE LOW. WE TRAINED NECTAR-FORAGING BUMBLEBEES TO DISCRIMINATE REWARDING AND UNREWARDING TARGETS THAT DIFFERED IN COLOUR, SCENT, OR BOTH COLOUR AND SCENT, AND THEN PRESENTED THE TARGETS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ILLUMINATION. WE MEASURED BEES' ACCURACY AT DISTINGUISHING THE TWO TARGETS AND THEIR RATE OF VISITS TO THE TRAINED TARGET. PERFORMANCE ON BOTH MEASURES DECLINED UNDER LOW LIGHT WHEN TARGETS WERE UNSCENTED. THE PRESENCE OF SCENT REDUCED THE LOSS OF ACCURACY UNDER LOW LIGHT, SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY BACKUP HYPOTHESIS, BUT THIS EFFECT DEPENDED UPON THE COLOUR OF THE PREVIOUSLY REWARDED TARGET. IN CONTRAST, THE PRESENCE OF SCENT DID NOT AFFECT THE OVERALL RATE OF CORRECT VISITS UNDER LOW LIGHT (CORRECT VISITS/FORAGING TIME). A BACKUP MECHANISM THAT MAINTAINS ACCURACY, BUT NOT RATE OF NECTAR COLLECTION, DOES NOT NECESSARILY BENEFIT THE POLLINATOR. HOWEVER, IT MOST LIKELY BENEFITS THE PLANT THROUGH REDUCED POLLEN WASTAGE. IN SHORT, MULTIMODAL FLORAL SIGNALS MAY BENEFIT THE PLANT BY IMPROVING POLLEN TRANSFER, WHILE NOT BENEFITING THE POLLINATOR. (C) 2012 THE ASSOCIATION FOR THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR.

PETERS VE;CARROLL CR,PETERS VE,TEMPORAL VARIATION IN COFFEE FLOWERING MAY INFLUENCE THE EFFECTS OF BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE ON COFFEE PRODUCTION,AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS,AGROFOR. SYST.,"ACCURATELY ESTIMATING THE CONTRIBUTION OF POLLINATORS TO PRODUCTION IN CROP SPECIES IS IMPORTANT BUT COULD BE CHALLENGING FOR SPECIES THAT ARE WIDELY CULTIVATED. ONE FACTOR THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE POLLINATOR-PRODUCTION RELATIONSHIP ACROSS REGIONS IS PHENOLOGY, OR THE TIMING OF RECURRING BIOLOGICAL EVENTS, BECAUSE CROP PHENOLOGY CAN BE PROXIMATELY CONTROLLED BY CLIMATIC VARIABLES AND PHENOLOGY CAN AFFECT PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. FOR THE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CROP, COFFEE (), AT LEAST THREE ASPECTS OF FLOWERING PHENOLOGY (ONSET, DENSITY AND FREQUENCY) ARE INFLUENCED BY PRECIPITATION, WHICH VARIES ACROSS COFFEE'S CULTIVATED RANGE. OF THESE ASPECTS OF FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, FLOWER DENSITY MAY PARTICULARLY IMPACT PRODUCTION IN COFFEE BECAUSE HIGH-DENSITY FLOWERING CAN SEVERELY LIMIT OUTCROSSING WHICH IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO HIGH YIELDS AND LARGER, HIGH QUALITY BEANS. WE STUDIED THE COFFEE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION OVER 3 YEARS AND ACROSS TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF COFFEE BLOOMS: (1) LOW-DENSITY, SYNCHRONOUS FLOWERING AND (2) HIGH-DENSITY, SYNCHRONOUS (MASS) FLOWERING. BEE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS SIMILAR FOR FOUR OUT OF FIVE FLOWERING PERIODS (9.8 +/- A 2.7 95\% CI), BUT NEARLY TRIPLED DURING ONE HIGH-DENSITY FLOWERING PERIOD (26 +/- A 8.6 95\% CI). DURING LOW-DENSITY FLOWERING COFFEE FRUIT SET RATES WERE VARIED, BUT WHEN COFFEE FLOWERED AT HIGH-DENSITY, INITIAL FRUIT SET RATES REMAINED CLOSE TO 60\% (THE RATE OBTAINED FROM MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION OF COFFEE FLOWERS IN POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS).

WE ASSESSED THE FREQUENCY OF VISIT TO DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES AND THE ACTIVITY TIME OF CARPENTER BEES IN AN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM. SIX SPECIES OF CARPENTER BEES WERE COLLECTED VISITING FLOWERS. AMONG THE 48 INTERACTIONS THAT WERE THEORETICALLY POSSIBLE IN THE INTERACTION NETWORK, ONLY 19 WERE RECORDED (CONNECTANCE=39.58\%). THE TEMPORAL OVERLAP BETWEEN PAIRS OF SPECIES MEASURED BY THE SHANNON INDEX (0 TO 0.648) WAS LOWER THAN DIETARY OVERLAP (0 TO 0.967). THE NETWORK ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWED THAT BEES SEPARATED THEIR NICHES MORE STRONGLY IN THE TEMPORAL DIMENSION (E=0.72, P < 0.001) THAN IN THE DIETARY DIMENSION (E=0.55, P < 0.001). THE LEVELS OF DIETARY AND TEMPORAL OVERLAP WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER, AS WELL AS THE TIME OF HIGHEST FREQUENCY OF VISIT COINCIDED WITH THE TIME OF AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES BY THE MOST IMPORTANT PLANTS (MORINGA OLEIFERA, PASSIFLORA EDULIS, AND SOLANUM PALINACANTHUM).

NAGY L,NAGY L,BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: SILENE SUECICA,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1. THIS ACCOUNT PRESENTS INFORMATION ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE BIOLOGY OF SILENE SUECICA (LODD.) GREUTER \& BURDET (LYCHNIS ALPINA L.) THAT ARE RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING ITS ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOUR. THE MAIN TOPICS ARE PRESENTED WITHIN THE STANDARD FRAMEWORK OF THE BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT, COMMUNITIES, RESPONSES TO BIOTIC FACTORS, RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENT, STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY, PHENOLOGY, FLORAL AND SEED CHARACTERS, HERBIVORES AND DISEASE, HISTORY AND CONSERVATION. 2. SILENE SUECICA IS NATIVE TO THE BRITISH FLORA, BEING FOUND IN JUST TWO CONFIRMED LOCALITIES (ONE IN NORTH-WEST ENGLAND AND THE OTHER IN SCOTLAND) ON OPEN FELL-FIELD AND ROCKY OUTCROP HABITATS. IT OCCURS ON ACID TO NEUTRAL SOIL IN BRITAIN AND ELSEWHERE ITS CIRCUM-ARCTIC RANGE. IT OFTEN INDICATES ELEVATED CONCENTRATIONS OF COPPER OR OTHER HEAVY METALS, WHOSE PRESENCE IN THE SOIL RESTRICTS THE GROWTH OF OTHER SPECIES, THEREFORE, S. SUECICA IS PERCEIVED AS A STRESS-TOLERANT, COMPETITION-AVOIDING SPECIES. NONETHELESS, IT ALSO GROWS IN MORE OR LESS CLOSED ALPINE GRASSLAND IN EUROPE, IN NORTH AMERICA AND GREENLAND, IT IS KNOWN FROM TUNDRA, ROCKY BARRENS, GULLEYS AND RIVER OUTWASHES, GRASSY SLOPES AND SEA CLIFFS. 3. SILENE SUECICA IS A (SEMI-)ROSETTE PLANT WITH A STRONG TAPROOT, WITH NO CAPACITY FOR VEGETATIVE SPREAD. THE MAIN PERENNATING ORGAN IS THE SLIGHTLY LIGNIFIED ROOTSTOCK/TAPROOT. THE ROSETTE HAS WINTER-GREEN LEAVES, AFTER FLOWERING THE ROSETTE LEAVES DIE, BUT NEW LATERAL ROSETTES MAY BE PRODUCED IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE LONGEVITY OF THE SPECIES IS BETWEEN 3 AND 10 YEARS, WITH THE TIME OF FIRST FLOWERING DEPENDING ON ROSETTE SIZE. PLANTS THAT HAVE FLOWERED MAY DIE (SEMELPAROUS INDIVIDUALS), BUT SOME ARE ITEROPAROUS AND FLOWER AGAIN ON LATERAL SHOOTS. 4. SILENE SUECICA PRODUCES PROTANDROUS HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS, BUT SELF-POLLINATION MAY OCCUR. IN SCOTLAND ABOUT 10\% OF ALL PLANTS FLOWER IN ANY YEAR. POLLINATION IS BY A RANGE OF INSECTS, INCLUDING FLIES AND BEES. CAPSULES PRODUCE UP TO 80 SEEDS (MEAN=30). 5. SILENE SUECICA HAS PROBABLY NOT DECLINED IN THE BRITISH ISLES AND, IN FACT, A SLIGHT POPULATION EXPANSION IN PERMANENT PLOTS WAS OBSERVED IN SCOTLAND IN THE EARLY 1990S. NONETHELESS, IT REMAINS CLASSED AS VULNERABLE TO EXTINCTION BECAUSE OF ITS RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION. BOTH OF ITS BRITISH LOCATIONS ARE PROTECTED AS SSSI AND SAC (NATURA 2000) WITHIN NATIONAL PARKS.

THEORETICALLY, THE CUES DESERT SPECIES USE TO CONTINUE DIAPAUSE THROUGH DROUGHT SHOULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE AVAILABILITY OF CRITICAL RESOURCES, BUT THE UNPREDICTABILITY AND INFREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF CLIMATE EXTREMES AND REDUCED INSECT ACTIVITY DURING SUCH EVENTS MAKE EMPIRICAL TESTS OF THIS PREDICTION DIFFICULT. AN INTENSIVE STUDY OF A DIVERSE BEE-PLANT COMMUNITY THROUGH A DROUGHT EVENT FOUND THAT BEE SPECIALISTS OF A DROUGHT-SENSITIVE HOST PLANT WERE ABSENT IN THE DROUGHT YEAR IN CONTRAST TO GENERALIST BEES AND TO SPECIALIST BEES OF A DROUGHT-INSENSITIVE HOST PLANT. DIFFERENT RESPONSES OF BEE SPECIES TO DROUGHT INDICATE THAT THE DIAPAUSE CUES USED BY BEE SPECIES ALLOW THEM TO RELIABLY PREDICT HOST AVAILABILITY. SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE BEE COMMUNITY IN DROUGHT SHIFTED TOWARDS MOSTLY GENERALIST SPECIES.

BOT.,"A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF ORCHID SPECIES ASSIGNED TO SUBTRIBE ONCIDIINAE PRODUCE FLORAL OIL AS A FOOD REWARD THAT ATTRACTS SPECIALIZED BEE POLLINATORS. THIS OIL IS PRODUCED EITHER BY GLABROUS GLANDS (EPITHELIAL ELAIOPHORES) OR BY TUFTS OF SECRETORY HAIRS (TRICHOMAL ELAIOPHORES). ALTHOUGH THE STRUCTURE OF EPITHELIAL ELAIOPHORES IN THE ONCIDIINAE HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED, TRICHOMAL ELAIOPHORES ARE LESS COMMON AND HAVE NOT RECEIVED AS MUCH ATTENTION. ONLY TRICHOMAL ELAIOPHORES OCCUR IN THE GENUS LOCKHARTIA, AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND STRUCTURE ARE SURVEYED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME. FLOWERS OF 16 SPECIES OF LOCKHARTIA WERE STUDIED. THE LOCATION OF FLORAL ELAIOPHORES WAS DETERMINED HISTOCHEMICALLY AND THEIR ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION AND MODE OF OIL SECRETION WAS INVESTIGATED BY MEANS OF LIGHT MICROSCOPY, SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY. ALL SPECIES OF LOCKHARTIA INVESTIGATED HAVE TRICHOMAL ELAIOPHORES ON THE ADAXIAL SURFACE OF THE LABELLUM. HISTOCHEMICAL TESTS REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF LIPOIDAL SUBSTANCES WITHIN THE LABELLAR TRICHOMES. HOWEVER, THE DEGREE OF OIL PRODUCTION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF TRICHOMES DIFFERED BETWEEN THE THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF SPECIES FOUND WITHIN THE GENUS. ALL TRICHOMES WERE UNICELLULAR AND, IN SOME SPECIES, OF TWO DISTINCT SIZES, THE LARGER BEING EITHER CAPITATE OR APICALLY BRANCHED. THE TRICHOMAL CUTICLE WAS LAMELLATE, AND OFTEN APPEARED DISTENDED DUE TO THE SUBCUTICULAR ACCUMULATION OF OIL. THE LABELLAR TRICHOMES OF THE THREE SPECIES EXAMINED USING TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY CONTAINED DENSE, INTENSELY STAINING CYTOPLASM WITH APICALLY LOCATED VACUOLES. OIL-LADEN SECRETORY VESICLES FUSED WITH THE PLASMALEMMA AND DISCHARGED THEIR CONTENTS.

DIFFERENT LIFE MODES SHOULD PROMOTE A LOW FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE AMONG POLLINATORS, WHILE OPPORTUNISTIC NECTAR FEEDING WOULD LEAD TO REDUCED AND UNPREDICTABLE POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS (PE) COMPARED TO MORE SPECIALIZED NECTARIVORES. DISSECTING THE QUANTITY (QNC) AND QUALITY (QLC) COMPONENTS OF PE, WE STUDIED THE OPPORTUNISTIC BIRD-LIZARD POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE OF ISOPLEXIS CANARIENSIS FROM THE CANARY ISLANDS TO EXPERIMENTALLY EVALUATE THESE POTENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS. BIRDS AND LIZARDS SHOWED DIFFERENT POSITIONS IN THE PE LANDSCAPE, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR LOW FUNCTIONAL EQUIVALENCE. BIRDS WERE MORE EFFICIENT THAN LIZARDS DUE TO HIGHER VISITATION FREQUENCY (QNC). ADULT LIZARDS DIFFERED FROM JUVENILES IN EFFECTING A HIGHER PRODUCTION OF VIABLE SEEDS (QLC). THE DISPARATE LIFE MODES OF BIRDS AND LIZARDS RESULTED IN AMPLE INTRA- AND INTER-SPECIFIC PE VARIANCE. THE MAIN SOURCES OF PE VARIANCE WERE VISITATION FREQUENCY (BOTH LIZARDS AND BIRDS), NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED (LIZARDS) AND PROPORTION OF VIABLE SEEDS RESULTING FROM A SINGLE VISIT (BIRDS). THE NON-COINCIDENT LOCATIONS OF BIRDS AND LIZARDS ON THE PE LANDSCAPE INDICATE POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS FOR EFFECTIVENESS. VARIATIONS IN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE CAN RESULT IN MAJOR EFFECTIVENESS SHIFTS ONLY IF QLC IS RELATIVELY HIGH, WHILE CHANGES IN QLC WOULD INCREASE PE SUBSTANTIALLY ONLY AT HIGH QNC.

WE CHECKED POTENTIAL NESTING SITES BY SEARCHING FOR NESTS FROM OCTOBER 2009 UNTIL APRIL 2010. WE COLLECTED SIX WORKER BEES FROM EACH DETECTED NEST TO IDENTIFY SPECIES, AND ESTIMATED DIVERSITY AND ANALYZED THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF THE NESTS USING THE SHANNON-WIENER AND NEAREST NEIGHBOR INDEX, RESPECTIVELY. WE FOUND FIFTY NESTS BELONGING TO SEVEN SPECIES, WITH NANNOTRIGONA TESTACEICORNIS BEING THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES (44\%). THE DENSITY OF NESTS WAS 2.17 NESTS/HA, THE SHANNON-WIENER DIVERSITY INDEX WAS H'=1.58 AND THE CLUMPED DISTRIBUTION WAS THE DETECTED DISPERSAL PATTERN.

JOHNSON KA,JOHNSON KA,ARE THERE POLLINATION SYNDROMES IN THE AUSTRALIAN EPACRIDS (ERICACEAE: STYPHELIOIDEAE)? A NOVEL STATISTICAL METHOD TO IDENTIFY KEY FLORAL TRAITS PER SYNDROME,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS CONVERGENT FLORAL TRAITS HYPOTHESIZED AS ATTRACTING PARTICULAR POLLINATORS ARE KNOWN AS POLLINATION SYNDROMES. FLORAL DIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN EPACRID FLORA MAY BE ADAPTED TO POLLINATOR TYPE. CURRENTLY THERE ARE EMPIRICAL DATA ON THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS FOR 87 SPECIES (APPROX. 15 \% OF AUSTRALIAN EPACRIDS). THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO TEST FOR POLLINATION SYNDROMES AND THEIR IMPORTANT MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS IN AN ICONIC ELEMENT OF THE AUSTRALIAN FLORA. METHODS DATA ON EPACRID-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS WERE OBTAINED FROM PUBLISHED LITERATURE AND FIELD OBSERVATION. A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH WAS USED TO TEST WHETHER EPACRID FLORAL ATTRIBUTES RELATED TO POLLINATOR PROFILES. STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION WAS THEN USED TO RANK FLORAL ATTRIBUTES ACCORDING TO THEIR PREDICTIVE VALUE. DATA SETS EXCLUDING MIXED POLLINATION SYSTEMS WERE USED TO TEST THE PREDICTIVE POWER OF STATISTICAL CLASSIFICATION TO IDENTIFY POLLINATION MODELS. KEY RESULTS FLORAL ATTRIBUTES ARE CORRELATED WITH BIRD, FLY AND BEE POLLINATION. USING FLORAL ATTRIBUTES IDENTIFIED AS CORRELATING WITH POLLINATOR TYPE, BIRD POLLINATION IS CLASSIFIED WITH 86 \% ACCURACY, RED FLOWERS BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR. FLY AND BEE POLLINATION ARE CLASSIFIED WITH 78 AND 69 \% ACCURACY, BUT HAVE A LACK OF INDIVIDUALLY IMPORTANT FLORAL PREDICTORS. EXCLUDING MIXED POLLINATION SYSTEMS IMPROVED THE ACCURACY OF THE PREDICTION OF BOTH BEE AND FLY POLLINATION SYSTEMS. CONCLUSIONS ALTHOUGH MOST EPACRIDS HAVE GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS, A CORRELATION BETWEEN BIRD POLLINATION AND RED, LONG-TUBED EPACRIDS IS FOUND.

ECON. ENTOMOL.,"THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE, MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA F., IS USED EXTENSIVELY TO POLLINATE ALFALFA FOR SEED PRODUCTION IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA. HOWEVER, IT USUALLY IS NOT POSSIBLE TO SUSTAIN BEE POPULATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN THE MANAGED POLLINATION SYSTEM, VARIABLE MICROENVIRONMENTS ARE EXPERIENCED BY DEVELOPING M. ROTUNDATA DURING THE NESTING SEASON THAT MAY INFLUENCE BEE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. IN THIS STUDY, BEE CELLS WERE PRODUCED IN A SMALL ALFALFA FIELD AND COLLECTED FROM DOMICILES ACCORDING TO NESTING BOARDS AND DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF BOARDS. EXAMINATION OF CELLS SHOWED THAT THE PRODUCTION OF LIVE OVERWINTERING PREPUPAE, DISEASED LARVAE, OTHER DEAD EGGS AND LARVAE, AND CELLS ATTACKED BY NATURAL ENEMIES VARIED ACCORDING TO BOARD ORIENTATIONS AND POSITIONS, AND PORTIONS OF THE BOARDS. NORTHEAST-FACING BOARD SAMPLES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HEAVIER AND HAD MORE POLLEN BALLS AND CHALKBROOD COMPARED WITH SOUTHWEST-FACING BOARDS. LOWER BOARDS IN STACKS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHALKBROOD THAN UPPER BOARDS. OUTER PORTIONS OF BOARDS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIVE PREPUPAE AND LESS CHALKBROOD THAN MIDDLE AND INNER PORTIONS, AND OUTER AND MIDDLE PORTIONS HAD LESS SUMMER-EMERGING BEES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS COULD BE ALTERED BY CHANGING THE ORIENTATION OF BOARDS WITHIN DOMICILES OR CHANGING THE DESIGNS OF DOMICILES. TO ACCURATELY ASSESS THE QUALITY OF BEE POPULATIONS MANAGED IN THE COMMERCIAL LOOSE CELL SYSTEM, A SAMPLE OF BEES SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM A POOLED SAMPLE FROM ALL BOARDS IN EACH DOMICILE. EACH DOMICILE SAMPLE SHOULD THEN BE EVALUATED ACCORDING TO ITS PROPORTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE WHOLE FIELD'S PROGENY PRODUCTION (E.G., BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME).",MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA; MEGACHILIDAE; ALFALFA; POLLINATION; REPRODUCTION,ROTUNDATA FAB HYM; TEMPERATURE; AVAILABILITY; POPULATION; EMERGENCE; MORTALITY; FIELDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"PITTS-SINGER, TL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UTAH STATE UNIV, USDA ARS, POLLINATING INSECTS RES UNIT, 1410 N 800 E, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.;UTAH STATE UNIV, USDA ARS, POLLINATING INSECTS RES UNIT, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",10.1603/EC12237,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,NA,NA,0022-0493,2,543-551,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,106,2013,ISI000317576600005,27,ENTOMOLOGY,18,ENTOMOLOGY,THERESA.PITTS-SINGERARS.USDA.GOV,125XY,"PITTS-SINGER, TL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UTAH STATE UNIV, USDA ARS, POLLINATING INSECTS RES UNIT, 1410 N 800 E, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA",ISI,none,UTAH STATE UNIV,UTAH STATE UNIV,NA,"PITTS-SINGER TL, 2013, J ECON ENTOMOL","PITTS-SINGER TL, 2013, J ECON ENTOMOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

BIOL.,"SUCCESSFUL CROSS-FERTILIZATION IN PLANT SPECIES THAT RELY ON ANIMAL POLLINATORS DEPENDS NOT JUST ON THE NUMBER OF POLLINATOR VISITS, BUT ALSO ON THESE VISITS' DURATION. FURTHERMORE, IN NON-DECEPTIVE POLLINATION, A VISIT'S DURATION DEPENDS ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE REWARD PROVIDED TO THE POLLINATOR. ACCORDINGLY, PLANTS THAT RELY ON BIOTIC POLLINATION HAVE TO PARTITION THEIR INVESTMENT IN CROSS-FERTILIZATION ASSURANCE BETWEEN ATTRACTING POLLINATOR VISITS - ADVERTISEMENT, AND REWARDING VISITORS TO ASSURE THAT THE VISIT IS OF PRODUCTIVE DURATION. HERE WE ANALYZE THESE PROCESSES BY A COMBINATION OF OPTIMALITY METHODS AND GAME THEORETICAL MODELING. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE OPTIMALITY IN SUCH ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES DEPENDS ON THE TYPES OF REWARD OFFERED TO THE POLLINATORS. MORE PRECISELY, WE SHOW THAT PLANTS THAT OFFER BOTH FOOD REWARD AND MATING RENDEZVOUS TO POLLINATORS WILL EVOLVE TO ALLOCATE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF THEIR CROSS-FERTILIZATION ASSURANCE BUDGET TO ADVERTISEMENT THAN PLANTS THAT OFFER ONLY FOOD REWARD.

PROCESSES,"THE PROXIMAL REASONS AND ULTIMAL CONSEQUENCES OF DECISIONS MADE DURING FORAGING BY BREEDING INDIVIDUALS ARE WIDELY STUDIED IN NUMEROUS AVIAN SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THESE DECISIONS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED IN MIGRATORY BIRDS BECAUSE THEY SPEND MORE TIME AND ENERGY FORAGING THAN ON THE ACTUAL JOURNEY ITSELF. THE PEAK FLOWERING AND POLLINATION PERIOD OF CROPS IN SOUTHERN ISRAEL, WHEN LARGE NUMBERS OF HIVES ARE TRANSPORTED TO THE REGION, COINCIDE WITH THE PEAK MIGRATION OF BEE-EATERS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT BEE-EATERS CUE ON CONSPECIFICS WHILE FORAGING AT A STOPOVER SITE, REACT TO PERCEIVED DANGER AT A GIVEN FORAGING PATCH, AND THAT THE DEGREE OF RISK TAKEN BY AN INDIVIDUAL WAS A FUNCTION OF BODY CONDITION AND SEX. BEE-EATERS WERE CAUGHT ON 44 DIFFERENT MORNINGS IN SPRING 2004, 2005, AND 2009. A SEX-DEPENDENT TRAPPING WAS NOTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FEMALES WERE CAUGHT IN THE FIRST BOUT. THE SEX RATIO REMAINED SIGNIFICANTLY MALE BIASED IN BOUTS 3-8. BIRDS CAUGHT IN THE FIRST BOUT WERE HEAVIER IN COMPARISON TO THOSE CAUGHT IN THE SECOND BOUT, AND THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN SEX AND BOUTS. FROM THE SECOND BOUT ONWARDS BOTH SEXES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BODY MASS, BY 1.05 G/BOUT ON AVERAGE (+/- 0.6 SD), HOWEVER WING LENGTHS REMAINED SIMILAR FOR BOTH SEXES. WE CONCLUDE THAT MIGRANT BEE-EATERS CUE ON CONSPECIFICS TO EVALUATE PREDATION RISKS WHEN SOCIALLY FORAGING AT A LOCALIZED FOOD PATCH AND MALES, WHO WE ASSUME TO BE TIME-MINIMIZERS, ARE MORE LIKELY TO FORAGE AT A NOVEL SITE AND ONCE DANGER OF FORAGING IS PERCEIVED ONLY HIGH ENERGY DEMAND INDIVIDUALS WILL ATTEMPT TO HUNT.

MOREOVER, SPECIES' RESPONSES TO LAND-USE CHANGE MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR LIFE HISTORY TRAITS SUCH AS DISPERSAL ABILITY, TROPHIC LEVEL, OR SOCIALITY. WE ASSESSED SPECIES RICHNESS AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS OF WILD BEES IN 32 CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS IN CENTRAL GERMANY THAT DIFFER IN SIZE, CONNECTIVITY, RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. DECLINING HABITAT AREA AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, REDUCED DIVERSITY OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE WERE THE KEY FACTORS NEGATIVELY INFLUENCING SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THE COMMUNITY-WIDE ANALYSIS, SMALL BODY SIZE AND SOLITARY REPRODUCTION WERE TRAITS THAT MADE SPECIES PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO HABITAT LOSS. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, CLEPTOPARASITIC SPECIES WERE NOT MORE AFFECTED BY REDUCED HABITAT AREA AND LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY THAN NEST-BUILDING SPECIES. WE PERFORMED FURTHER DETAILED TRAIT ANALYSES WITHIN THE FAMILY HALICTIDAE TO PREVENT POSSIBLE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS DUE TO TRAIT CORRELATIONS ACROSS FAMILIES. HERE, SOCIAL AS OPPOSED TO SOLITARY SPECIES WERE MORE AFFECTED BY HABITAT LOSS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE OPPOSITE PATTERN OBSERVED FOR ALL SOCIAL BEES WAS MAINLY CAUSED BY LARGE-SIZED SOCIAL BUMBLEBEE SPECIES WITH HIGH MOBILITY AND LARGE FORAGING DISTANCES.

WE EXAMINED THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE INTERACTION NETWORKS TO SPECIES LOSS, A PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO RESULTING FROM FOREST FRAGMENTATION. THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATION SYNDROME (FLOWER SIZE) ON NETWORK ROBUSTNESS WAS ALSO EXAMINED. PASSIFLORA ALATA, P. MALACOPHYLLA AND P. SUBEROSA WERE POLLINATED BY BEES OF DIFFERENT CORPORAL SIZES. P.

THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF THE NETWORKS WE DIFFERENTIATE THE STRUCTURES OF THE FLOWER-VISITOR NETWORK WITH THE `TRUE' PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK. THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE FLOWER-VISITOR NETWORK TO ANIMAL LOSS WAS GENERALLY HIGH, BUT IT DECLINED WHEN ONLY TRUE POLLINATORS WERE INCLUDED IN THE NETWORK. THE SEQUENTIAL LOSS OF PLANTS FROM THE FLOWER-VISITOR NETWORK RESULTED IN LOW ROBUSTNESS: THE LOSS OF KEY PLANTS COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CASCADING EFFECTS ON THE ANIMALS FEEDING ON THEM WITHIN THE FOREST FRAGMENT.

IN THIS CONTEXT, TESTS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE INSECTICIDE CHLORANTRANILIPROLE (CORAGEN (R)) AS A MODEL COMPOUND ACTIVE ON THE RYANODINE RECEPTOR OF INSECTS. RESULTS CHRONIC ORAL EXPOSURE VIA POLLEN INDUCED LETHARGIC BEHAVIOUR IN B. TERRESTRIS WORKERS AND THEIR OFFSPRING (DRONES). INDEED, IN NESTS EXPOSED TO 0.4MGL-1, REPRESENTING 1/100 OF THE CONCENTRATION RECOMMENDED FOR USE IN THE FIELD, WORKERS AND DRONES DID NOT TAKE THEIR DEFENSIVE POSITION UPON STIMULATION AND THEY WERE LESS ACTIVE THAN NON-EXPOSED INSECTS. THE DIFFERENT RISK ASSESSMENT TESTS USED HERE DEMONSTRATED THAT CONTACT AND POLLEN EXPOSURE HAD NO EFFECT ON BUMBLEBEE WORKER SURVIVAL, WHEREAS ORAL EXPOSURE VIA SUGAR WATER CAUSED BOTH ACUTE (72H LC50=13MGL-1) AND CHRONIC (7WEEK LC50=7MGL-1) TOXICITY.

MUSSAENDA SHIKOKIANA MAKINO CONSISTED OF ONE FLORAL MORPH ONLY IN THE POPULATIONS STUDIED IN SOUTHERN CHINA. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT ILLUMINATING THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FLORAL MONOMORPHISM IN M. SHIKOKIANA, AND ELUCIDATING THE MECHANISM BEHIND THE EVOLUTION OF MONOMORPHISM FROM DISTYLY. WE EXAMINED FLORAL MORPHOLOGY IN FIVE NATURAL POPULATIONS ACROSS THE SPECIES' DISTRIBUTION RANGE. EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLORAL BIOLOGY, POLLINATING FAUNA, AND BREEDING SYSTEM WERE CARRIED OUT IN TWO TO FOUR NATURAL POPULATIONS. WE ALSO SCREENED ALLOZYME MARKERS TO ESTIMATE THE DEGREE OF OUTCROSSING. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT M. SHIKOKIANA WAS A SELF-COMPATIBLE, PARTIALLY AUTOGAMOUS SPECIES AND POLLINATORS WERE REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE SEED SET. ANTHERS DEHISCED AND POLLEN SHOWED THE HIGHEST VIABILITY 8-12H BEFORE FLOWER OPENING, AND STIGMAS WERE RECEPTIVE IN BUD, RESULTING IN BUD-SELFING. POLLEN VIABILITY DECREASED SHARPLY AFTER FLOWER OPENING, WHEREAS STIGMA RECEPTIVITY LASTED TO THE THIRD DAY. POLLINATORS INCLUDING BEES, BUTTERFLIES, AND HAWKMOTHS VISITED THE FLOWERS OF M. SHIKOKIANA FREQUENTLY AT THE STUDY SITES. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG POLLEN TUBE GROWTH RATES IN SELFING AND OUTCROSSING, POLLEN TUBES REACHED OVULES WITHIN 16H IN ALL TREATMENTS, INDICATING LACK OF TYPICAL SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY OR CRYPTIC SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY.

TO FILL THIS GAP, WE COMPARED THE PATTERNS OF POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE INVASIVE HERB ECHIUM VULGARE (BORAGINACEAE) BETWEEN MONOSPECIFIC PATCHES (ONLY E. VULGARE) AND MIXED PATCHES (SYMPATRY WITH NATIVE HERBS SCHIZANTHUS HOOKERI AND STACHYS ALBICAULIS) IN CENTRAL CHILE. USING SAMPLE QUADRATS OF 1 M X 2 M, WE QUANTIFIED THE RICHNESS, DIVERSITY AND VISITATION RATE OF FLOWER VISITORS IN 15-MIN OBSERVATION INTERVALS. WE CONDUCTED AN ASSAY TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE PATCH TYPES (MONOSPECIFIC AND MIXED) AND THE ISOLATION OF FLOWERS TO VISITORS ON BOTH THE FRUIT SET AND SEED/OVULE RATIO. WE SHOWED THAT NATIVE PLANTS FAVOURED THE RICHNESS OF VISITORS OF E. VULGARE, HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT LEAD TO INCREASES IN VISITATION RATE. THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF E. VULGARE DID NOT SHOW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTRASTED PATCHES, HOWEVER, THE ISOLATION OF VISITORS DECREASED THE FRUIT SET, ALTHOUGH SEED PRODUCTION WAS MAINTAINED IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS, PRESUMABLY BY AN AUTOGAMOUS MECHANISM. COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH FOCUS, WE ASSESSED CHANGES IN POLLINATION VARIABLES AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT IN TWO COFLOWERING NATIVE PLANTS THAT OCCUR WITH E. VULGARE, S. HOOKERI AND S. ALBICAULIS. DESPITE THE FACT THAT OUR CORRELATIONAL STUDY DID NOT ALLOW US TO DISSECT THE EFFECTS OF MIXED PATCHES AND RELATIVE PLANT ABUNDANCES ON VARIABLES MEASURED FOR NATIVES, WE OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN POLLINATOR RICHNESS IN MIXED PATCHES FOR THE TWO PLANTS STUDIED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A POTENTIAL FACILITATION FOR VISITOR RICHNESS OF THE EXOTIC PLANT IN COEXISTENCE WITH NATIVE PLANTS, ALTHOUGH THIS FACILITATION DOES NOT RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE VISIT RATE OR ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF ANY OF THE STUDIED SPECIES.

THE PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK WAS DOMINATED BY PARASITIC MALE BUMBLEBEES AND HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY MODULAR STRUCTURE, WITH FOUR IDENTIFIED MODULES BEING CLEARLY SEPARATED IN SPACE. THIS INDICATED THAT INDIVIDUAL FLOWER VISITORS OPTED FOR THE FINE-SCALE DIVISION OF RESOURCES, EVEN WITHIN A LOCAL SITE. HOWEVER, SPATIAL MAPPING OF NETWORK MODULES AND MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS ALSO SHOWED AN OVERLAP IN THE DENSE CENTER OF THE PLANT PATCH. MODEL SELECTION BASED ON AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION WITH TRAITS AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES REVEALED THAT THISTLE STEMS WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF FLOWER HEADS AND MANY CLOSE NEIGHBOURS WERE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE MODULES. IN CONTRAST, TALL PLANTS AND THOSE NEAR THE PATCH CENTER WERE CRUCIAL FOR CONNECTING THE DIFFERENT MODULES TO EACH OTHER. THIS DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUAL-BASED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS ARE INFLUENCED BY BOTH THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF PLANT POPULATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL-SPECIFIC PLANT TRAITS. ADDITIONALLY, BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WITH LONG OBSERVATION TIMES WERE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN AND WITHIN MODULES.

HERE, WE USE A DYNAMIC NETWORK MODEL TO TEST A VARIETY OF TRANSLOCATION STRATEGIES FOR RESTORING A COMMUNITY AFTER IT EXPERIENCES THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS SPECIES. WE CONSIDER THE REINTRODUCTION OF EXTIRPATED SPECIES, BOTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ORIGINAL LOSS AND AFTER THE COMMUNITY HAS REEQUILIBRATED, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF OTHER NATIVE SPECIES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ABSENT FROM THE COMMUNITY. WE FIND THAT REINTRODUCING MULTIPLE HIGHLY INTERACTING GENERALIST SPECIES BEST RESTORES SPECIES RICHNESS FOR LIGHTLY DISTURBED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, FOR COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN BIODIVERSITY, INTRODUCING GENERALIST SPECIES THAT ARE NOT ORIGINALLY PRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY MAY MOST EFFECTIVELY RESTORE SPECIES RICHNESS, ALTHOUGH IN THESE CASES THE RESULTANT COMMUNITY OFTEN SHARES FEW SPECIES WITH THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY.

REPEAT SAMPLING OF AN UNUSUALLY SPECIALISED, SPECIES-RICH BEE COMMUNITY WAS DONE IN THE NORTH-WESTERN CHIHUAHUAN DESERT, NORTH AMERICA AT SITES IN FIVE HABITATS (RIPARIAN, MESQUITE FOREST, ABANDONED FIELD, GRASSLAND, AND DESERT SCRUB) THAT EITHER HAD BEEN INTENSELY GRAZED BY CATTLE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR NOT BEEN GRAZED FOR 22+ YEARS. SPECIES DENSITY AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BEES DID NOT CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO GRAZING, ABUNDANCE AND PROPORTION OF SINGLETON SPECIES (THOSE REPRESENTED BY ONE SPECIMEN) DID. IN ALL HABITATS, OTHER THAN THE RIPARIAN, THERE WAS LOWER OVERALL ABUNDANCE AND A GREATER PROPORTION OF SINGLETON SPECIES AT SITES THAT HAD BEEN RECENTLY GRAZED THAN AT SITES THAT HAD NOT BEEN GRAZED SINCE 1979. THE PROPORTION OF SINGLETONS WAS GREATER IN RECENTLY GRAZED THAN IN LONG-TERM UNGRAZED AREAS, BUT POLLEN-SPECIALIST SPECIES DID NOT RESPOND MORE STRONGLY THAN POLLEN GENERALISTS. THE SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN BEE ABUNDANCE AND RARITY WAS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN FLORAL RESOURCES.

BUZZ POLLINATION IS A UNIQUE FORAGING BEHAVIOR IN WHICH BEES VIBRATE THE ANTHERS OF FLOWERS TO EJECT POLLEN WHICH IS THEN COLLECTED AND USED AS FOOD. THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BUZZING PROPERTIES AND POLLEN RELEASE ARE WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT IT IS LESS CLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT BUZZING VIBRATIONS VARY AMONG SPECIES, EVEN THOUGH SUCH INFORMATION IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BEES AND BUZZ-POLLINATED PLANTS. OUR GOALS IN THIS STUDY WERE (1) TO EXAMINE WHETHER POLLINATION BUZZES DIFFER FROM THOSE PRODUCED DURING DEFENSE, (2) TO EVALUATE THE SIMILARITY OF BUZZES BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.), AND (3) TO DETERMINE IF BODY SIZE AFFECTS THE EXPRESSION OF BUZZING PROPERTIES. WE FOUND THAT RELATIVE PEAK AMPLITUDE, PEAK FREQUENCY, AND DURATION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN SPECIES, BUT ONLY RELATIVE PEAK AMPLITUDE DIFFERED BETWEEN POLLINATION AND DEFENSIVE BUZZES. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES AND BUZZ TYPE FOR PEAK FREQUENCY AND DURATION, REVEALING THAT SPECIES DIFFERED IN THEIR PATTERNS OF EXPRESSION IN THESE BUZZ PROPERTIES DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT. THE ONLY PARAMETER AFFECTED BY BODY SIZE WAS DURATION, WITH LARGER BEES PRODUCING SHORTER BUZZES. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH POLLINATION AND DEFENSIVE BUZZES DIFFER IN SOME PROPERTIES, VARIABILITY IN BUZZ STRUCTURE ALSO EXHIBITS A MARKED SPECIES-SPECIFIC COMPONENT.

SCI.,"ANIMAL POLLINATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF MANY WILD AND CROP PLANTS. LOSS AND ISOLATION OF (SEMI-) NATURAL HABITATS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES CAN CAUSE DECLINES OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AND ENDANGER POLLINATION SERVICES. WE INVESTIGATED THE INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF THESE DRIVERS ON POLLINATION OF YOUNG CHERRY TREES IN A LANDSCAPE-SCALE EXPERIMENT. WE INCLUDED (I) ISOLATION OF STUDY TREES FROM OTHER CHERRY TREES (UP TO 350 M), (II) THE AMOUNT OF CHERRY TREES IN THE LANDSCAPE, (III) THE ISOLATION FROM OTHER WOODY HABITATS (UP TO 200 M) AND (IV) THE AMOUNT OF WOODY HABITATS PROVIDING NESTING AND FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS. AT THE LOCAL SCALE, WE CONSIDERED EFFECTS OF (V) CHERRY FLOWER DENSITY AND (VI) HETEROSPECIFIC FLOWER DENSITY. POLLINATORS VISITED FLOWERS MORE OFTEN IN LANDSCAPES WITH HIGH AMOUNT OF WOODY HABITAT AND AT SITES WITH LOWER ISOLATION FROM THE NEXT CHERRY TREE. FRUIT SET WAS REDUCED BY ISOLATION FROM THE NEXT CHERRY TREE AND BY A HIGH LOCAL DENSITY OF HETEROSPECIFIC FLOWERS BUT DID NOT DIRECTLY DEPEND ON POLLINATOR VISITATION. THESE RESULTS REVEAL THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING THE PLANT'S NEED FOR CONSPECIFIC POLLEN AND ITS POLLEN COMPETITION WITH CO-FLOWERING SPECIES RATHER THAN FOCUSING ONLY ON POLLINATORS' HABITAT REQUIREMENTS AND FLOWER VISITATION.

BOT.,"FLORAL POLYMORPHISM IS FREQUENTLY ATTRIBUTED TO POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION. MULTIPLE STUDIES, HOWEVER, HAVE REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-POLLINATING VISITORS IN FLORAL EVOLUTION. USING THE POLYMORPHIC ANNUAL DAISY URSINIA CALENDULIFLORA, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT INSECT VISITORS, AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FITNESS, IN THE MAINTENANCE OF FLORAL POLYMORPHISM. THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF A DISCRETE FLORAL POLYMORPHISM WAS CHARACTERIZED BASED ON THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF ANTHOCYANIN FLORET SPOTS IN U. CALENDULIFLORA. A 3-YEAR OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS THEN CONDUCTED IN POLYMORPHIC POPULATIONS TO INVESTIGATE DIFFERENCES IN VISITATION RATES OF DOMINANT VISITORS TO FLORAL MORPHS. EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO EXPLORE THE FLORAL PREFERENCE OF MALE AND FEMALE MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS (THE DOMINANT INSECT VISITOR) AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS. NEXT, FLORAL DAMAGE BY ANTAGONISTIC FLORIVORES AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE TWO FLORAL MORPHS WERE SURVEYED IN MULTIPLE POPULATIONS AND YEARS. FLORAL POLYMORPHISM IN U. CALENDULIFLORA WAS STRUCTURED SPATIALLY, AS WERE INSECT VISITATION PATTERNS. MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS MALES WERE THE DOMINANT VISITORS AND EXHIBITED STRONG PREFERENCE FOR THE SPOTTED MORPH IN NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS. WHILE THIS MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL FITNESS BENEFITS FOR THE SPOTTED MORPH, FEMALE FITNESS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHS. HOWEVER, AS M. CAPENSIS MALES ARE VERY EFFICIENT AT EXPORTING U. CALENDULIFLORA POLLEN, THEIR PREFERENCE MAY LIKELY INCREASE THE REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS OF THE SPOTTED MORPH THROUGH MALE FITNESS COMPONENTS. THE SPOTTED MORPH, HOWEVER, ALSO SUFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COSTS DUE TO OVULE PREDATION BY FLORIVORES THAN THE SPOTLESS MORPH. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLINATORS AND FLORIVORES MAY POTENTIALLY EXERT ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF FLORAL POLYMORPHISM ACROSS THE RANGE OF U. CALENDULIFLORA. THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF SELECTION IMPOSED BY EACH AGENT IS POTENTIALLY DETERMINED BY INSECT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE AT EACH SITE, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY CONTEXT IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL PHENOTYPES.",ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION; BEE FLIES; COMMUNITY CONTEXT; FLORAL POLYMORPHISM; FLORIVORY; MONKEY BEETLES; OVULE PREDATION; POLLEN EXPORT; POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; URSINIA CALENDULIFLORA; MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS,FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM; IPOMOEA-PURPUREA; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; HERBIVORES; PLANT; VISITATION; PIGMENTATION; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,23,"DE JAGER, ML (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STELLENBOSCH, DEPT BOT \& ZOOL, PRIVATE BAG X1, ZA-7602 MATIELAND, SOUTH AFRICA.;DE JAGER, MARINUS L., ELLIS, ALLAN G., UNIV STELLENBOSCH, DEPT BOT \& ZOOL, ZA-7602 MATIELAND, SOUTH AFRICA.",10.1093/AOB/MCT189,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION - SOUTH AFRICA [SUR2008051300005]; STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK C.

PREVIOUSLY, WE OBSERVED FEMALES COLLECTING THREE PLANT RESOURCES: NECTAR, POLLEN, AND LEAVES. WE HYPOTHESIZED WHICH PLANTS WOULD BE USED FOR NECTAR AND WHICH FOR POLLEN BASED ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FLORAL DISPLAY AND OBSERVATIONS OF INSECT BEHAVIOR. TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE ISOLATED AND IDENTIFIED POLLEN OCCURRING IN COCOONS FROM NEST CELLS. WE OBSERVED 412 INTERACTIONS BETWEEN M. ALLENI INDIVIDUALS AND THE FLOWERS OF 26 PLANT SPECIES IN 14 FAMILIES. FIFTEEN POLLEN SPECIES WERE IDENTIFIED FROM 15 DISSECTED COCOONS, CELLS AVERAGED 5.5 POLLEN SPECIES +/- 1.7 SD. TWO-THIRDS OF THE COCOONS CONTAINED POLLEN FROM THREE SPECIES (CORCHORUS HIRSUTUS, JACQUEMONTIA CAYENSIS, AND LANTANA INVOLUCRATA), AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE POLLEN SPECIES WERE FOUND IN AT LEAST TWENTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF THE CELLS. WE FOUND POLLEN FROM EIGHT OF THE HYPOTHESIZED SOURCES, BUT ALSO POLLEN FROM FOUR SPECIES HYPOTHESIZED TO PROVIDE ONLY NECTAR, AND FROM THREE SPECIES NOT PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED AS FLORAL RESOURCES. LEAVES OF AT LEAST FOUR SPECIES WERE USED FOR NEST CELL CONSTRUCTION. FEMALES SEARCHING FOR SUITABLE NESTS FLEW OVER THE GROUND, OFTEN SEARCHING IN CAVITIES UNDER ROCKS OR ASPHALT.

CHACOFF NP;ASCHERO V,CHACOFF NP,FREQUENCY OF VISITS BY ANTS AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS OF CONDALIA MICROPHYLLA CAV.,JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS,J. ARID. ENVIRON.,"THE EFFECT OF A POLLINATOR SPECIES ON A PLANT DEPENDS ON THEIR INTERACTION FREQUENCY AND THE POLLINATOR'S EFFECTIVENESS. THE ROLE OF ANTS AS POLLINATORS IS HIGHLY VARIABLE, IN SOME CASES THEY ACT AS TRUE POLLINATORS AND IN OTHERS AS ANTAGONISTS DAMAGING FLOWERS, ROBBING NECTAR OR DISRUPTING POLLINATION. POLLINATOR VISITATION FREQUENCY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR DETERMINING THEIR IMPACT ON PLANTS. ANTS ARE COMMONLY SEEN AS VISITORS OF THE DESERT SHRUB CONDALIA MICROPHYLLA, BUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY WE ASSESS THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ROLE OF ANTS AND OTHER WINGED FLOWER VISITORS AS POLLINATORS OF C. MICROPHYLLA BY EXPERIMENTALLY QUANTIFYING THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO FRUIT PRODUCTION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE MONTE DESERT OF VILLAVICENCIO NATURE RESERVE, MENDOZA, ARGENTINA. A DIVERSE ASSEMBLAGE OF INSECTS VISITED FLOWERS OF C. MICROPHYLLA, INCLUDING BEES, ANTS, FLIES, BEETLES AND VESPIDS. ANTS (CAMPONOTUS MUS AND CAMPONOTUS PUNCTULATUS) ACCOUNTED FOR A HIGH PROPORTION OF INTERACTIONS. FRUIT SET RESULTED MOSTLY FROM POLLINATION BY WINGED INSECTS, WHILE FLOWERS VISITED BY ANTS DID NOT SET FRUITS.

URBAN PLAN.,"MOST STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE EFFECTS OF URBAN LAND USE ON POLLINATORS HAVE COMPARED URBAN SITES WITH ONE TYPE OF RURAL SITE. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LOT OF VARIATION IN THE AMOUNT OF NATURAL HABITATS OR INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE IN RURAL AREAS. THE POSITION OF URBAN AREAS WITHIN THAT CONTINUUM IN TERMS OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN THIS WORK, WE STUDIED BEE AND HOVERFLY COMMUNITIES (ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY, AND SPECIES COMPOSITION) IN THREE SITE TYPES ALONG TWO RIVER SYSTEMS CROSSING URBAN AREAS, RURAL AREAS DOMINATED BY AGRICULTURE (TERMED RURAL-AGRICULTURAL) AND RURAL AREAS WITH HIGH AMOUNTS OF SEMI-NATURAL LAND USE (TERMED RURAL-NATURAL). POLLINATORS WERE CAUGHT IN AUGUST 2011. ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WERE HIGHEST IN RURAL-NATURAL SITES FOR BOTH TAXONOMIC GROUPS. OUR DATA ALSO INDICATE THAT HOVERFLIES AND BEES RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO THE SURROUNDING LAND USE, WITH BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN RURAL-AGRICULTURAL SITES BUT NOT IN URBAN SITES, AND HOVERFLY ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ONLY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN URBAN SITES BUT NOT IN RURAL-AGRICULTURAL SITES. THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN THE RESPONSE OF POLLINATORS POINT OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INCORPORATING DIFFERENT TYPES OF RURAL LAND USE AND CLEARLY DEFINING THE RURAL END OF AN URBAN RURAL GRADIENT IN GETTING A CLEAR VIEW ON HOW URBAN LAND USE AFFECTS A SPECIFIC POLLINATOR GROUP.

ECOL.,"1. FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY (FD) OF POLLINATORS CAN INCREASE PLANT REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT AND THE STABILITY OF PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. YET, IN TIMES OF WORLD-WIDE POLLINATOR DECLINES, EFFECTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE ON POLLINATOR FD REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. LOSS OF NATURAL HABITAT AND EXOTIC PLANT INVASIONS ARE TWO MAJOR DRIVERS OF GLOBAL CHANGE THAT PARTICULARLY THREATEN POLLINATOR DIVERSITY. 2. IN A SUBTROPICAL SOUTH AFRICAN LANDSCAPE, WE INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN THE FD OF FLOWER VISITOR ASSEMBLAGES ON NATIVE AND EXOTIC PLANTS ALONG GRADIENTS OF NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF EXOTIC PLANTS. WE USED A DATA SET OF 1434 FLOWER VISITOR INDIVIDUALS SAMPLED ON 131 FOCAL PLANTS AND CALCULATED THE FD IN THREE FLOWER VISITOR TRAITS THAT ARE STRONGLY RELATED TO PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR INTERACTIONS AND POLLINATION PROCESSES: PROBOSCIS LENGTH, PROBOSCIS DIAMETER AND BODY LENGTH. 3. MULTIVARIATE FD OF FLOWER VISITORS DECREASED WITH BOTH INCREASING NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND RELATIVE EXOTIC ABUNDANCE. IMPORTANTLY, CHANGES IN FD WENT BEYOND THOSE IN FLOWER VISITOR RICHNESS. FURTHERMORE, FLOWER VISITOR RICHNESS WAS NOT RELATED TO EITHER NATURAL HABITAT LOSS OR RELATIVE EXOTIC ABUNDANCE. LOSS IN MULTIVARIATE FD SEEMED TO BE MEDIATED BY COMPLEMENTARY REDUCTIONS OF FD IN PROBOSCIS LENGTH WITH NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND OF FD IN BODY LENGTH WITH BOTH GLOBAL CHANGE DRIVERS. CORRESPONDINGLY, WE RECORDED LOWER ABUNDANCES OF LONG-TONGUED FLOWER VISITORS WITH NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND REDUCED VARIANCE IN BODY SIZE WITH BOTH DRIVERS. IN CONTRAST, FD IN PROBOSCIS DIAMETER WAS UNAFFECTED BY EITHER DRIVER. ALL EFFECTS OF THE TWO GLOBAL CHANGE DRIVERS WERE NON-INTERACTIVE. 4. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT BOTH NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND EXOTIC PLANTS NEGATIVELY AFFECT FLOWER VISITOR FD, WHICH MAY IMPERIL POLLINATION OF SPECIALIZED PLANT SPECIES IN DEGRADED HABITATS. IN CONTRAST, FLOWER VISITOR RICHNESS MAY NOT COVER ALL FACETS OF FLOWER VISITOR FD THAT ARE RELEVANT TO POLLINATION PROCESSES. DISTINCT RESPONSES OF VISITOR TRAITS TO THE TWO DRIVERS SUGGEST LIMITED OPTIONS TO INFER RELATIONS OF ONE TRAIT TO ANOTHER. FINALLY, ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF NATURAL HABITAT LOSS AND EXOTIC PLANT INVASIONS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE DRIVERS OF GLOBAL CHANGE WHEN INVESTIGATING ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES AT A COMMUNITY SCALE.",AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING; ECOSYSTEM PROCESS; GLOBAL CHANGE; PLANT INVASION; PLANT REPRODUCTION; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SPECIALIZATION,POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; TRAITS; BEES; BIODIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; SIZE; CONSEQUENCES; CONSTRAINTS; MECHANISMS; MUTUALISMS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"GRASS, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MARBURG, KARL VON FRISCH STR 8, D-35032 MARBURG, GERMANY.;GRASS, INGO, BERENS, DANA G., FARWIG, NINA, UNIV MARBURG, D-35032 MARBURG, GERMANY.",10.1111/1365-2435.12285,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,ROBERT BOSCH STIFTUNG,"WE THANK EZEMVELO KZN WILDLIFE FOR WORK PERMISSION WITHIN ORIBI GORGE NATURE RESERVE (PERMIT NO OP 4355/2011) AND ALL SOUTH AFRICAN FARMERS WHO GRANTED US ACCESS TO THEIR LAND.

FORT H,FORT H,QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS OF POLLINATORS' ABUNDANCES FROM QUALITATIVE DATA ON THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH PLANTS AND EVIDENCES OF EMERGENT NEUTRALITY,OIKOS,OIKOS,"MAKING QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES IS CRUCIAL FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. IN THE CASE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS, DESPITE THE GREAT PROGRESS IN DESCRIBING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND THEIR POLLINATORS, THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS IS STILL LACKING. HERE, IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE POLLINATOR SPECIES ABUNDANCES AND THEIR NICHE DISTRIBUTION, I PROPOSE A GENERAL METHOD TO TRANSFORM A PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK INTO A COMPETITION MODEL BETWEEN POLLINATOR SPECIES. COMPETITION MATRICES WERE OBTAINED FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES' CALCULATIONS, USING QUALITATIVE INTERACTION MATRICES COMPILED FOR A SET OF 38 PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS. THIS METHOD IS ABLE TO MAKE ACCURATE QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS FOR MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS SPANNING A BROAD GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PREDICTED BIODIVERSITY METRICS FOR POLLINATORS - SPECIES RELATIVE ABUNDANCES, SHANNON EQUITABILITY AND GINI-SIMPSON INDICES - AGREE QUITE WELL WITH THOSE INFERRED FROM EMPIRICAL COUNTS OF VISITS OF POLLINATORS TO PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, THIS METHOD ALLOWS BUILDING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL NICHE AXIS FOR POLLINATORS IN WHICH CLUSTERS OF GENERALISTS ARE SEPARATED BY SPECIALISTS THUS RENDERING SUPPORT TO THE THEORY OF EMERGENT NEUTRALITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION BETWEEN POLLINATOR SPECIES IS A CONTROVERSIAL AND UNRESOLVED ISSUE, CONSIDERABLE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE HAS ACCRUED THAT COMPETITION BETWEEN INSECTS DOES OCCUR, BUT A CLEAR MEASURE OF ITS IMPACT ON THEIR SPECIES ABUNDANCES IS STILL LACKING. I CONTRIBUTED TO FILL THIS GAP BY QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION BETWEEN POLLINATORS.

FLOWERING PHENOLOGIES AND FLOWER VISITORS WERE OBSERVED OR COLLECTED FROM 2008 TO 2011. THE POLLEN VIABILITY, STIGMA RECEPTIVITY AND POLLINATION EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT VISITORS WERE DETECTED AND TESTED. THE FLORESCENCE LASTED FOR 6-9D IN A SINGLE FLOWER FROM MID-MAY TO LATE JUNE. A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF FLOWER DAMAGE PROMOTED EARLY ANTHER DEHISCENCE. FLOWERS STARTED DISSEMINATING POLLEN AT 1-2 D AFTER FLOWERING, AND LASTED FOR 5-6 D. POLLEN VIABILITY COULD BE PRESERVED FOR MORE THAN 10 D AT NORMAL TEMPERATURE. HIGH SEED RATE FROM THE STIGMA WAS OBSERVED AT 1 D BEFORE FLOWERING TO 3D AFTER FLOWERING, AND THE DISSEMINATION HYSTERESIS WAS DEFINED AS PROTOGYNY. THE P/O RATIOS WERE 6,124 TO 9,713:1, SUGGESTING THAT THE LARGER QUANTITY OF POLLEN TO INCREASED THE SEED SETTING RATE. THREE SPECIES OF BEES, EIGHT SPECIES OF BEETLES, SEVEN SPECIES OF SYRPHID FLIES, FOUR SPECIES OF ANTS, AND THREE SPECIES OF BUTTERFLIES WERE OBSERVED ON THE FLOWERS. P DELAVAYI REWARDED TO THE VISITORS BY RELEASING FRAGRANCE, PROVIDING POLLEN AND NECTAR. ON THE BODIES OF THE VISITORS UNDER STEREOMICROSCOPE AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM), MUCH POLLEN FROM THE PLANTS OF SIMILAR FLOWERING PERIOD INNER COMMUNITY WERE FOUND WHICH INDICATED THAT THESE INCOMPATIBLE VISITORS WERE NOT SPECIES-SPECIFIC POLLINATORS. THE BAGGING EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT P DELAVAYI WAS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND NO APOMIXES. ANEMOPHILY ONLY PLAYED A MINOR ROLE IN THE FERTILIZATION. A FEW SEEDS WITH POOR PLUMPNESS CAN BE PRODUCED BY GEITONOGAMY. SEED SETTING RATE OF ARTIFICIAL XENOGAMY WAS HIGHER THAN NATURAL POLLINATION. ARTIFICIAL CONTROL OF THE VISITORS' SPECIES SHOWED BEES BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS. BEETLES AND ANTS PARTICIPATED IN POLLINATION TO SOME EXTENT AND WERE UNSTABLE.

BUMBLE BEE BEHAVIOR, RESOURCE OVERLAP BETWEEN CASTES, AND PLANT-BUMBLE BEE NETWORKS CHANGE WITH ALTITUDE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TIGHTENING TEMPORAL CONSTRAINTS ON FLOWERING AND COLONY GROWTH IN ALPINE HABITATS. INDIVIDUAL BEES WERE MORE LIKELY TO COLLECT POLLEN FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES AT HIGH ALTITUDE. BETWEEN-CASTE FORAGING NICHE OVERLAP INCREASED WITH ALTITUDE. SIMILARLY, ALPINE FORAGER NETWORKS WERE MORE HIGHLY NESTED THAN EITHER SUBALPINE OR MONTANE NETWORKS DUE TO INCREASED ASYMMETRIC SPECIALIZATION. HOWEVER, INTERSPECIFIC RESOURCE PARTITIONING SHOWED A MORE COMPLEX SPATIAL PATTERN WITH LOW NICHE OVERLAP AT INTERMEDIATE ALTITUDE (SUBALPINE) COMPARED TO MONTANE (DISTURBED) AND ALPINE (UNPRODUCTIVE) SITES. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SPATIAL VARIATION IN INTERSPECIFIC RESOURCE PARTITIONING IS DRIVEN BY A SHIFT IN THE BEHAVIOR OF LONG-TONGUED BUMBLE BEES.

INDIC.,"CONSERVATION OF POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE IT CONTRIBUTES TO MAINTAINING A DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF PLANT SPECIES IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. THE PRESENCE OF SEMI-NATURAL AREAS FAVORABLE TO POLLINATION IS A KEY FACTOR FOR ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE OF SUSTAINABILITY. SOWING MIXTURES OF DICOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS THAT ARE RICH IN POLLEN AND NECTAR AS FLOWER STRIPS ALONG FIELD MARGINS IS AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS AND TO SUPPORT THEIR FORAGING ACTIVITY ON ARABLE LAND. THE ENHANCEMENT OF AGROECOSYSTEMS REQUIRES OPERATIONAL METHODS THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF EXISTING AND SOWN SEMI-NATURAL AREAS ON POLLINATION. WE DEVELOPED HERE A NEW PREDICTIVE INDICATOR THAT CAN BE USED AT THE FIELD MARGIN AND FLORAL LEVELS, WHICH PREDICTS THE POLLINATION VALUE OF FLORAL DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF FIELD MARGINS ON ARABLE LAND. WE BASED THE PREDICTIVE INDICATOR ON DECISION TREES USING ``IF-THEN LINGUISTIC RULES BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF SUFFICIENT QUANTITATIVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION. THIS APPROACH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO USE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION. WE ASSOCIATED FUZZY SUBSETS TO THE DECISION TREES AND THE CLASSES OF VARIABLES IN ORDER TO AVOID THE KNIFE-EDGE EFFECT OF CLASS LIMITS. AT THE SPECIES LEVEL, THE INDICATOR DEPENDS ON THREE CRITERIA: (I) VISUAL ATTRACTIVENESS IN TERMS OF FLOWER SIZE, COLOR AND UV REFLECTION, (II) FLOWER ACCESSIBILITY ACCORDING TO THE BOTANICAL FAMILY, THE SYMMETRY AND THE SHAPE OF THE FLOWER, AND (III) THE REWARD LINKED TO POLLEN AND NECTAR QUANTITY AND QUALITY. AN AGGREGATION PROCEDURE ALLOWS US TO OBTAIN A VALUE AT THE FIELD MARGIN LEVEL FOR EACH MONTH AS A FUNCTION OF THE FLOWERING PERIOD AND POLLINATION ACTIVITY. EXAMPLES OF CALCULATIONS FOR HONEYBEES, WILD BEES, BUMBLEBEES AND HOVERFLIES ARE SHOWN. THE EVALUATION OF THE PREDICTIVE QUALITY YIELDED SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND THE INDICATOR VALUE. THE LEVEL OF CORRELATION IS SATISFYING FOR THIS TYPE OF INDICATOR, WHICH MIGHT BE FURTHER IMPROVED WITH ADDITIONAL DATA ON PLANT TRAITS.

HORTIC.,"LOQUAT(ERIOBOTRYAJAPONICA LINDL.), A MEMBER OF THE ROSACEAE, CARRIES THE RNASE-DEPENDENT GAMETOPHYTIC SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY (GSI) FERTILIZATION SYSTEM. HOWEVER, SOME CULTIVARS, INCLUDING THE ISRAELI `YEHUDA' AND `AKKO 1', ARE SELF-COMPATIBLE (SC). SINCE SC CULTIVARS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON POLLEN DONORS, THEY ARE USUALLY PLANTED IN `SOLID BLOCKS'. NEVERTHELESS, IN SOME SC ROSACEAE SPECIES, SUCH AS APRICOT, CHERRY AND ALMOND, ENHANCED SELF- OR CROSS-POLLINATION INCREASES FRUIT SET. TO DETERMINE WHETHER ENHANCED POLLINATION CAN IMPROVE `YEHUDA' AND `AKKO 1' FRUIT SET AND FRUIT SIZE RELATIVE TO SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION, THE IMPACT OF INTRODUCING HONEY BEET AND THE EFFECT OF CROSS-POLLINATION WERE EXAMINED. WE FOUND THAT HONEY BEES ARE HIGHLY ATTRACTED TO `YEHUDA' AND `AKKO 1' FLOWERS, AND FRUIT SIZE IN BOTH CULTIVARS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PER FRUIT. IN A NET-CAGED TREE EXPERIMENT, FRUIT SET OF `YEHUDA' AND `AKKO 1' BENEFITED FROM THE PRESENCE OF HONEY BEES. HOWEVER, FRUIT SET WAS ALSO RELATIVELY HIGH FOR THE CAGED TREES WITHOUT HONEY BEES WHICH UNDERWENT SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION, AND COMMERCIAL FRUIT THINNING WAS REQUIRED FOR ALL TREATMENTS. FOR BOTH CULTIVARS, SEED SET AFTER SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION WAS THE SAME AS FOR SELF-POLLINATION IN THE PRESENCE OF HONEY BEES. THE IMPACT OF CROSS-POLLINATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT CULTIVARS MODERATELY INCREASED `YEHUDA' FRUIT SET AND `AKKO 1' SEED SET. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION MEETS THE POLLINATION REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SC LOQUAT CULTIVARS `YEHUDA' AND `AKKO 1', AND THAT THE PRESENCE OF POLLEN DONORS AND/OR HONEY BEES CONFERS A MINOR COMMERCIAL ADVANTAGE.

EVOL.,"MOST PAPILIONOIDEAE SPECIES EXHIBIT SPECIALIZED FLOWERS WITH THE STANDARD PETAL PLACED IN THE UPPER POSITION AND THE KEEL AND SURROUNDING WINGS ACTING AS THE LANDING PLATFORM FOR BEE VISITORS. FOR SOME GROUPS, HOWEVER, FLOWERS BECAME RESUPINATE SO THAT BEES LAND AT THE STANDARD PETAL. IN THIS UPSIDE-DOWN MORPHOLOGY, THE POLLEN IS DEPOSITED ONTO THE DORSAL SIDE OF VISITORS, INSTEAD OF THE VENTRAL SIDE AS IN MOST KEEL FLOWERS. TO UNDERSTAND HOW THESE INVERTED KEEL FLOWERS WORK AND THEIR DIFFERENCES FROM NORMAL KEEL FLOWERS, WE STUDIED THE RESUPINATE SPECIES CANAVALIA BRASILIENSIS, CENTROSEMA PASCUORUM AND CLITORIA FAIRCHILDIANA, AND COMPARED WITH THE NORMAL KEEL LATHYRUS PUBESCENS, CROTALARIA MICANS AND DIOCLEA VIOLACEA. BOTH THE BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGY OF BEE VISITORS WERE OBSERVED AND COMPARED TO THE FLOWER MORPHOLOGY. WE OBSERVED THAT MOST FEATURES OF THE MECHANISM EXHIBITED BY INVERTED KEEL FLOWER ARE FOUND AT KEEL FLOWERS, EXCEPT FOR THREE KEY INNOVATIONS: A THICKENING AT WINGS' MARGIN IN CONTACT WITH THE VISITORS' BODY, TIGHTER INTERLOCKING BETWEEN PETALS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE VEXILLUM STRUCTURE. MOST VISITORS ARE ADAPTED TO FLOWER CHARACTERISTICS IN THEIR MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR, ALTHOUGH SOME ACT AS THIEVES DUE TO SOME OF THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES, SUCH AS MOUTHPART LENGTH. IN SPITE OF THEIR DIFFERENCES, BEES BEHAVE ALMOST IN THE SAME WAY WHEN VISITING BOTH NORMAL AND INVERTED KEEL MORPHOLOGIES. COMPARED TO KEEL FLOWERS, INVERTED KEEL FLOWERS EVOLVED TOWARD MORE RESTRICTIVE STRUCTURES THAT REQUIRE LARGE-BODIED BEES TO OPERATE THEM.

THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF SPECIES AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL TRAITS MAY PROVIDE MECHANISTIC LINKS BETWEEN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH LINKS MAY BE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING DECREASES IN A STEP-WISE MANNER FROM REGIONAL CONDITIONS THROUGH LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY TO LOCAL HABITAT CONDITIONS. WE SAMPLED THE WILD BEE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES IN POWER-LINE STRIPS TRANSECTING FORESTS IN SOUTH-EASTERN NORWAY. WE USED ALTITUDE, LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY SURROUNDING SITES AND PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION, TOGETHER WITH TOTAL PLANT COVER AS PROXIES FOR REGIONAL, LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES DECREASED WITH ALTITUDE. THE REDUCTION IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYLOGENETIC CLUSTERING OF WILD BEE INDIVIDUALS. FURTHERMORE, REGIONAL FILTERS FOLLOWED BY LOCAL FILTERS BEST EXPLAINED THE STRUCTURE OF THE FUNCTIONAL SPECIES COMPOSITION. SITES AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND SITES WITH ERICACEAE-DOMINATED PLANT COMMUNITIES TENDED TO HAVE LARGER BEES AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF SOCIAL AND SPRING-EMERGING BEES. WHEN BOMBUS SPECIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANALYSIS, THE PROPORTION OF POLLEN SPECIALISTS INCREASED WITH THE DOMINANCE OF ERICACEAE. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITIONAL TURNOVER BETWEEN SITES WAS HIGHER IN THE NORTHERN REGION THAN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STUDY REGION. ALTOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REGIONAL FILTERS DRIVE THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN TRAIT-GROUPS WHEREAS LOCAL FILTERS HAVE MORE DESCRETE SORTING EFFECTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MODEL OF MULTI-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS PROVIDES A GOOD CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR COMMUNITY ECOLOGY.

ECOL.,"AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED ACROSS EUROPE, AIMING TO MITIGATE EFFECTS OF HABITAT LOSS IN AGROECOSYSTEMS FOR A RANGE OF DECLINING SPECIES. THESE INCLUDE POLLINATING INSECTS SUCH AS BUMBLEBEES, FOR WHICH POSITIVE EFFECTS OF AES ON ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS HAVE BEEN SHOWN. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF AES ON REPRODUCTION OF TARGET SPECIES, AT EITHER LOCAL OR LANDSCAPE SCALES, WE CONDUCTED A LARGE-SCALE STUDY ACROSS LANDSCAPES EXHIBITING A GRADIENT OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A TARGETED FLOWER MIXTURE, SOWN IN PATCHES OF THREE DIFFERENT SIZES, ON AN INDEX OF THE TOTAL BIOMASS OF BUMBLEBEE SEXUALS (MALES AND QUEENS) ON REPLICATED TRANSECTS WITHIN EACH LANDSCAPE. WE USED THIS INDEX (MQ) AS A MEASURE OF BUMBLEBEE REPRODUCTION. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR FLORAL DENSITY ON TRANSECTS, WE FOUND THAT MQ WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON SOWN FLOWER PATCHES THAN ON CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED CONTROL PATCHES AT LOCAL SCALES THROUGHOUT THE THREE-YEAR STUDY. WHILE SOWN FLOWER PATCHES DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE MQ IN SURROUNDING LANDSCAPES, MQ WAS HIGHER IN LANDSCAPES SURROUNDING LARGER (I HA) THAN SMALLER (0.25 HA) SOWN PATCHES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WHILE RESPONSES OF DIFFERENT BEE SPECIES MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE PLANT SPECIES SOWN, TARGETED FLOWER MIXTURES CAN ENHANCE BUMBLEBEE REPRODUCTION BY PROVIDING LOCALLY ATTRACTIVE FORAGE RESOURCES TO BUMBLEBEES OF ALL CASTES AND SEXES FROM NESTS WITHIN FORAGING DISTANCE. IF ESTABLISHED AT LARGE ENOUGH SCALES, SOWN FLOWER PATCHES MAY LEAD TO A DETECTABLE SPILL-OVER OF REPRODUCTIVES INTO SURROUNDING LANDSCAPES. FURTHERMORE, EFFECTS OF SOWN PATCHES ON MQ WERE MODERATED BY LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, THE STRONGEST POSITIVE RESPONSES BEING DETECTED AT SITES WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS OF ARABLE LAND.

IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATED THE LEVEL OF GENETIC DIVERSITY OF SEVEN DECLINING BOMBUS SPECIES AND FOUR MORE STABLE SPECIES WITH THE USE OF MICROSATELLITE LOCI. HERETO WE GENOTYPED A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS. SPECIMENS WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN 1918 AND 1926, IN 6 PROVINCES OF THE NETHERLANDS WHICH ALLOWED US TO MAKE INTERSPECIFIC COMPARISONS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY. FOR THE STABLE SPECIES B. PASCUORUM, WE ALSO SELECTED POPULATIONS FROM TWO ADDITIONAL TIME PERIODS: 1949-1955 AND 1975-1990. THE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND POPULATION STRUCTURE IN B. PASCUORUM REMAINED CONSTANT OVER THE THREE TIME PERIODS. HOWEVER, POPULATIONS OF DECLINING BUMBLEBEE SPECIES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER GENETIC DIVERSITY THAN CO-OCCURRING STABLE SPECIES BEFORE THEIR MAJOR DECLINES. THIS HISTORICAL DIFFERENCE INDICATES THAT THE REPEATEDLY OBSERVED REDUCED GENETIC DIVERSITY IN RECENT POPULATIONS OF DECLINING BUMBLEBEE SPECIES IS NOT CAUSED SOLELY BY THE DECLINE ITSELF.

TO TEST WHETHER PLANTS ARE LIMITED BY POLLEN AVAILABILITY, INFLORESCENCES IN 78 COMMERCIAL LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY FIELDS DURING THREE YEARS WERE HAND-POLLINATED EITHER WITH SUPPLEMENTAL OUTCROSS POLLEN, OR MARKED AND LEFT AS CONTROLS (OPEN-POLLINATION). MAXIMUM FRUIT SET WITH SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION WAS IN THE RANGE 50-65\%, WHEREAS WITH OPEN-POLLINATION, IT WAS SLIGHTLY, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, IN THE RANGE OF 47-57\%, SUGGESTING THAT POLLEN LIMITATION CAN AFFECT FRUIT SET. IN A TWO-YEAR EXPERIMENT, WE AUGMENTED NATIVE POLLINATORS WITH INTRODUCED HONEY BEES, BUMBLE BEES, AND LEAF CUTTER BEES AND ALL COMBINATIONS IN 48 FIELDS. STIGMATIC POLLEN LOADS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE TOTAL NUMBERS OF MANAGED BEES IN A FIELD IN 2010 BUT NOT 2011. THE PRESENCE OF LEAF CUTTER BEES HAD A SMALL BUT POSITIVE EFFECT ON SEED SET IN 2010, AND HONEY BEES HAD A SMALL BUT NEGATIVE INFLUENCE ON SEED SET IN 2011. THERE WAS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN FRUIT SET REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF SUPPLEMENTALLY POLLINATED AND OPEN-POLLINATED PLANTS, SUGGESTING THAT PLANT HEALTH OR PLANT RESOURCES INFLUENCE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. TEMPERATURE VARIATION AMONG REGIONAL GROUPINGS OF FIELDS WAS MINIMAL AND IS UNLIKELY TO HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR DIFFERENCES AMONG FIELDS IN FRUIT SET. WE PROPOSE SEVERAL REASONS WHY, DESPITE POLLEN-LIMITATION OF FRUIT AND SEED SET OF BLUEBERRY PLANTS, AUGMENTATION OF THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY OF LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE REPRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE POLLINATOR-MEDIATED TRANSFER OF SELF-POLLEN FOLLOWED BY SUBSEQUENT FRUIT ABORTION DUE TO INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND RESOURCE LIMITATION FOR FRUIT MATURATION.

SCI. POLLUT. RES.,"LARGE-SCALE USE OF THE PERSISTENT AND POTENT NEONICOTINOID AND FIPRONIL INSECTICIDES HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT RISKS TO ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS PROVIDED BY A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES AND ENVIRONMENTS AFFECTED BY THESE INSECTICIDES. THE CONCEPT OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IS WIDELY USED IN DECISION MAKING IN THE CONTEXT OF VALUING THE SERVICE POTENTIALS, BENEFITS, AND USE VALUES THAT WELL-FUNCTIONING ECOSYSTEMS PROVIDE TO HUMANS AND THE BIOSPHERE AND, AS AN ENDPOINT (VALUE TO BE PROTECTED), IN ECOLOGICAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF CHEMICALS. NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES ARE FREQUENTLY DETECTED IN SOIL AND WATER AND ARE ALSO FOUND IN AIR, AS DUST PARTICLES DURING SOWING OF CROPS AND AEROSOLS DURING SPRAYING. THESE ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA PROVIDE ESSENTIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY, BUT ARE KNOWN TO BE THREATENED BY LONG-TERM OR REPEATED CONTAMINATION BY NEONICOTINOIDS AND FIPRONIL. WE REVIEW THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THESE INSECTICIDES ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING SOIL AND FRESHWATER FUNCTIONS, FISHERIES, BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL, AND POLLINATION SERVICES. EMPIRICAL STUDIES EXAMINING THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF NEONICOTINOIDS AND FIPRONIL TO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES HAVE FOCUSED LARGELY ON THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO BENEFICIAL INSECT SPECIES (HONEYBEES) AND THE IMPACT ON POLLINATION SERVICE OF FOOD CROPS. HOWEVER, HERE WE DOCUMENT BROADER EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEMFUNCTIONS REGULATING SOIL AND WATER QUALITY, PEST CONTROL, POLLINATION, ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE, AND COMMUNITY DIVERSITY. IN PARTICULAR, MICROBES, INVERTEBRATES, AND FISH PLAY CRITICAL ROLES AS DECOMPOSERS, POLLINATORS, CONSUMERS, AND PREDATORS, WHICH COLLECTIVELY MAINTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY. SEVERAL EXAMPLES IN THIS REVIEW DEMONSTRATE EVIDENCE OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF SYSTEMIC INSECTICIDES ON DECOMPOSITION, NUTRIENT CYCLING, SOIL RESPIRATION, AND / INVERTEBRATE POPULATIONS VALUED BY HUMANS. INVERTEBRATES, PARTICULARLY EARTHWORMS THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR SOIL PROCESSES, WILD AND DOMESTIC INSECT POLLINATORS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT FOR PLANT AND CROP PRODUCTION, AND SEVERAL FRESHWATER TAXA WHICH ARE INVOLVED IN AQUATIC NUTRIENT CYCLING, WERE ALL FOUND TO BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO LETHAL AND SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF NEONICOTINOIDS AND/ OR FIPRONIL AT ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS. BY CONTRAST, MOST MICROBES AND FISH DO NOT APPEAR TO BE AS SENSITIVE UNDER NORMAL EXPOSURE SCENARIOS, THOUGH THE EFFECTS ON FISH MAY BE IMPORTANT IN CERTAIN REALMS SUCH AS COMBINED FISH-RICE FARMING SYSTEMS AND THROUGH FOOD CHAIN EFFECTS. WE HIGHLIGHT THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL CONCERNS AROUND AGRICULTURE AND AQUACULTURE PRODUCTION AND THE ROLE THESE INSECTICIDES MAY HAVE IN THREATENING FOOD SECURITY.

BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: ULTRAVIOLET (UV) FLORAL PATTERNS ARE COMMON IN ANGIOSPERMS AND MEDIATE POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, EFFICIENCY, AND CONSTANCY. UV PATTERNS MAY VARY WITHIN SPECIES, YET ARE CRYPTIC TO HUMAN OBSERVERS. THUS, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXPLICITLY DESCRIBED THE DISTRIBUTION OR ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN UV FLORAL PATTERNING. HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND PATTERN OF INHERITANCE OF A UV POLYMORPHISM IN THE MODEL PLANT SPECIES MIMULUS GUTTATUS (PHRYMACEAE). WE THEN TEST WHETHER NATURALLY OCCURRING UV PHENOTYPES INFLUENCE POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS. METHODS: WE DOCUMENT UV PATTERNS IN 18 ANNUAL AND 19 PERENNIAL POPULATIONS AND TEST WHETHER UV PATTERN IS ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY. TO EXAMINE THE PATTERN OF INHERITANCE, WE CONDUCTED CROSSES WITHIN AND BETWEEN UV PHENOTYPES. FINALLY, WE TESTED WHETHER BEE POLLINATORS DISCRIMINATE AMONG NATURALLY OCCURRING UV PHENOTYPES IN TWO SETTINGS: WILD BEE COMMUNITIES AND CAPTIVE BOMBUS IMPATIENS. KEY RESULTS: WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS, PERENNIAL POPULATIONS EXHIBIT A SMALL BULLS-EYE PATTERN, WHEREAS A BILATERALLY SYMMETRIC RUNWAY PATTERN OCCURS MAINLY IN ANNUAL POPULATIONS. INHERITANCE OF UV PATTERNING IS CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE-LOCUS MENDELIAN MODEL IN WHICH THE RUNWAY PHENOTYPE IS DOMINANT. BEE POLLINATORS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST UNFAMILIAR UV PATTERNS IN BOTH NATURAL AND CONTROLLED SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DESCRIBE A WIDESPREAD UV POLYMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY DIVERGENCE WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS. UV PATTERN INFLUENCES POLLINATOR VISITATION AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS BETWEEN LIFE HISTORY ECOTYPES.

EVOL.,"BEES ARE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS, AND BEE DIVERSITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATION, A VALUABLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE. HIGHER FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO HIGHER CROP YIELD. BEES SIMULTANEOUSLY REPRESENT A MEGA-DIVERSE TAXON THAT IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO SAMPLE THOROUGHLY AND AN IMPORTANT GROUP TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE OF POLLINATION SERVICES. WE SAMPLED BEES VISITING APPLE BLOSSOMS IN 28 ORCHARDS OVER 6YEARS. WE USED SPECIES RAREFACTION ANALYSES TO TEST FOR THE COMPLETENESS OF SAMPLING AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPECIES RICHNESS AND SAMPLING EFFORT, ORCHARD SIZE, AND PERCENT AGRICULTURE IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. WE PERFORMED MORE THAN 190H OF SAMPLING, COLLECTING 11,219 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING 104 SPECIES. DESPITE THE SAMPLING INTENSITY, WE CAPTURED <75\% OF EXPECTED SPECIES RICHNESS AT MORE THAN HALF OF THE SITES. FOR MOST OF THESE, THE VARIATION IN BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BETWEEN YEARS WAS GREATER THAN AMONG SITES. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS INFLUENCED BY PERCENT AGRICULTURE, ORCHARD SIZE, AND SAMPLING EFFORT, BUT WE FOUND NO FACTORS EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSERVED AND EXPECTED SPECIES RICHNESS. COMPETITION BETWEEN HONEYBEES AND WILD BEES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A FACTOR, AS WE FOUND NO CORRELATION BETWEEN HONEYBEE AND WILD BEE ABUNDANCE. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT THE POLLINATOR FAUNA OF AGROECOSYSTEMS CAN BE DIVERSE AND CHALLENGING TO THOROUGHLY SAMPLE.

APPL.,"LIMITED RESOURCES AND TAXONOMIC EXPERTISE IN BIODIVERSITY SURVEYS OFTEN LEAD TO THE APPLICATION OF THE HIGHER TAXA APPROACH (HTA), I.E., THE IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIMENS TO GENUS OR HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVELS RATHER THAN TO SPECIES. THE RELIABILITY OF THE HTA VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG STUDIES, YET THE FACTORS UNDERLYING THIS VARIABILITY HAVE RARELY BEEN INVESTIGATED. BEES ARE AN IDEAL MODEL TAXON FOR TESTING THE HTA BECAUSE THEY ARE HIGHLY DIVERSE, CHALLENGING TO IDENTIFY, AND THERE IS WIDESPREAD INTEREST IN THEIR ROLE AS NATIVE POLLINATORS, DRIVING DEMAND FOR EFFICIENT DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT TOOLS. USING EXTENSIVE BEE DATA SETS COLLECTED ACROSS THREE BIOMES AND VARIOUS HABITATS, WE ASSESSED THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA IN REFLECTING BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION PATTERNS AT LOCAL SCALES, FACTORS AFFECTING THIS PERFORMANCE, AND WAYS TO IMPROVE IT. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA VARIED CONSIDERABLY AMONG BIOMES, TAXONOMIC LEVELS (GENERA AND SUBFAMILIES), AND DIVERSITY MEASURES (SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION), GENUS AND SUBFAMILY RICHNESS ACCOUNTED FOR 55-77\% AND 32-61\% OF THE VARIATION IN SPECIES RICHNESS, RESPECTIVELY, GENUS AND SUBFAMILY COMPOSITION ACCOUNTED FOR 28-87\% AND 26-80\% OF THE VARIATION IN SPECIES COMPOSITION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NUMBER OF SPECIES PER HIGHER TAXON WAS A MAIN FACTOR INFLUENCING THIS PERFORMANCE (ACCOUNTING FOR 63\% OF THE VARIATION), WHILE THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF TAXONOMICALLY RELATED SPECIES HAD NO SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA. FURTHER SUBDIVIDING GENERA BY BODY SIZE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA AND INCREASED ITS ACCURACY IN REPRESENTATION OF COMPOSITIONAL PATTERNS BY, 16\%. OUR RESULTS HAVE SEVERAL PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. THE CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY FOUND IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA IN REPRESENTING LOCAL-SCALE RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION PATTERNS OF BEE SPECIES DICTATES CAUTION IN IMPLEMENTING THIS TOOL IN BEE SURVEYS. WHEN POSSIBLE, AN A PRIORI EVALUATION OF THE EXPECTED PERFORMANCE OF THE HTA SHOULD BE DONE, FOCUSING ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN HIGHER TAXONOMIC LEVELS AND THE SPECIES : HIGHER TAXA RATIO. INTEGRATING MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS BODY SIZE) THAT CONSISTENTLY SUBDIVIDE GENERA WILL IMPROVE THE HTA'S PERFORMANCE.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT THE GLOBAL DECLINE OF INSECT POLLINATORS WILL ADVERSELY INFLUENCE THE STABILITY OF POLLINATION IN AGRICULTURAL AND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS. BY ENHANCING HABITAT HETEROGENEITY AND ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY, RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE INSECT POLLINATORS IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES. INSECT POLLINATORS AND FLOWERING PLANTS WERE INVESTIGATED ON A RANGE OF RIPARIAN MARGINS, AND THEIR ADJACENT GRASSLAND FIELDS, TO DETERMINE THE MAIN PHYSICAL AND BOTANICAL ATTRIBUTES DRIVING POLLINATOR DIVERSITY. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY WERE FENCED OR NOT, RIPARIAN MARGINS HAD RICHER PLANT ASSEMBLAGES AND SUPPORTED MORE POLLINATORS THAN GRASSLAND FIELDS. WHILE THE ERECTION OF FENCES DID NOT ENHANCE THE RICHNESS OR DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS, FENCED RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS SUPPORTED MORE EVEN AND DIVERSE ASSEMBLAGES OF BUMBLEBEES AND A GREATER NUMBER OF BUTTERFLIES THAN UNFENCED RIPARIAN MARGINS. MORE BUMBLEBEES AND BUTTERFLIES WERE RECORDED IN WIDE BUFFER STRIPS (I.E. OVER 5 M WIDE) THAN IN UNFENCED MARGINS OR NARROW BUFFER STRIPS (I.E. <= 3.5 M WIDE) AND BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES IN WIDE BUFFER STRIPS WERE RICHER AND MORE DIVERSE. THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLORAL RESOURCES AND THE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEE AND BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES. POLLINATORS ONLY FORAGED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF THE FLOWER SPECIES PRESENT AND IMPACTS OF FENCING AND BUFFER STRIP WIDTH COULD NOT SOLELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE AREA AND/OR SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWERS. FENCED RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS, PARTICULARLY WHEN OVER 5 M WIDE, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR INSECT POLLINATORS IN INTENSIVELY GRAZED SYSTEMS. MANAGEMENT TO ENHANCE FLORISTIC DIVERSITY (TO PROVIDE A MORE CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF POLLEN AND NECTAR) AND TUSSOCK FORMING GRASSES (TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR POLLINATORS AND NESTING LOCATIONS FOR BUMBLEBEES) COULD FURTHER INCREASE THEIR VALUE TO INSECT POLLINATORS. IN GRASSLAND SYSTEMS, RESTRICTED GRAZING IS EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THAN MOWING. IT IS, HOWEVER, IMPORTANT THAT GRAZING MANAGEMENT DOES NOT UNDULY INTERFERE WITH OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DERIVED FROM RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS (E.G. DIFFUSE POLLUTION MITIGATION). WIDESPREAD FENCING OF WATERCOURSES AT THE CATCHMENT LEVEL COULD RESULT IN THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THESE INHERENTLY DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX HABITATS. BUFFER STRIPS SHOULD THEREFORE BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO OPTIMISE BENEFITS SUCH AS ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY AND DIFFUSE POLLUTION MITIGATION. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

EVOL.,"WILD BEES PROVIDE A FREE AND POTENTIALLY DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE TO FARMERS GROWING POLLINATION-DEPENDENT CROPS. WHILE MANY CROPS BENEFIT FROM INSECT POLLINATION, SOFT FRUIT CROPS, INCLUDING STRAWBERRIES ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THIS ECOSYSTEM SERVICE TO PRODUCE VIABLE FRUIT. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF INTENSIVE FARMING PRACTICES AND DECLINING POLLINATOR POPULATIONS, FARMERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO COMMERCIALLY REARED BEES TO ENSURE THAT CROPS ARE ADEQUATELY POLLINATED THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. WILDFLOWER STRIPS ARE A COMMONLY USED MEASURE AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF WILD POLLINATORS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT COMMERCIAL CROPS MAY ALSO BENEFIT FROM THE PRESENCE OF NONCROP FLOWERS, HOWEVER, THE EFFICACY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF SOWING FLOWER STRIPS FOR CROPS REMAIN RELATIVELY UNSTUDIED. IN A STUDY SYSTEM THAT UTILIZES BOTH WILD AND COMMERCIAL POLLINATORS, WE TEST WHETHER WILDFLOWER STRIPS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO ADJACENT COMMERCIAL STRAWBERRY CROPS BY POLLINATING INSECTS. WE QUANTIFIED THIS BY EXPERIMENTALLY SOWING WILDFLOWER STRIPS APPROXIMATELY 20 METERS AWAY FROM THE CROP AND RECORDING THE NUMBER OF POLLINATOR VISITS TO CROPS WITH, AND WITHOUT, FLOWER STRIPS. BETWEEN JUNE AND AUGUST 2013, WE WALKED 292 CROP TRANSECTS AT SIX FARMS IN SCOTLAND, RECORDING A TOTAL OF 2826 POLLINATORS.

HOWEVER, THE IDENTITY, LIFE HISTORY TRAITS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITIES OF MAIN CROP POLLINATOR SPECIES HAVE RECEIVED LIMITED ATTENTION. THESE ARE CRUCIAL FOR PREDICTING POLLINATION SERVICES OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES AND FOR DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ENHANCE CROP POLLINATORS. WE SAMPLED WILD BEES IN THREE CROP SYSTEMS (ALMOND, CONFECTION SUNFLOWER, AND SEED WATERMELON) IN A MOSAIC ISRAELI MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPE. BEES WERE SAMPLED IN FIELD/ORCHARD EDGES AND INTERIORS, AND IN SEMINATURAL SCRUB SURROUNDING THE FIELDS/ORCHARDS. WE ALSO ANALYZED LAND COVER AT 50-2500 M RADII AROUND FIELDS/ORCHARDS. WE USED THIS DATA TO DISTINGUISH CROP FROM NON-CROP POLLINATORS BASED ON A SET OF LIFE HISTORY TRAITS (NESTING, LECTY, SOCIALITY, BODY SIZE) LINKED TO HABITAT PREFERENCE AND CROP VISITATION. BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASED FROM THE SURROUNDING SEMINATURAL HABITAT TO THE FIELD/ORCHARD INTERIOR, ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SEMINATURAL HABITAT-FIELD EDGE ECOTONE. THUS, ALTHOUGH RICH BEE COMMUNITIES WERE FOUND NEAR FIELDS, ONLY SMALL FRACTIONS CROSSED THE ECOTONE AND VISITED CROP FLOWERS IN SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS. THE BEE ASSEMBLAGE IN AGRICULTURAL FIELDS/ORCHARDS AND ON CROP FLOWERS WAS DOMINATED BY GROUND-NESTING BEES OF THE TRIBE HALICTINI, WHICH TEND TO NEST WITHIN FIELDS. BEES' HABITAT PREFERENCES WERE DETERMINED MAINLY BY NESTING GUILD, WHEREAS CROP VISITATION WAS DETERMINED MAINLY BY SOCIALITY. LECTY AND BODY SIZE ALSO AFFECTED BOTH MEASURES. THE PERCENTAGE OF SURROUNDING SEMINATURAL HABITAT AT 250-2500 M RADII HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON WILD BEE DIVERSITY IN FIELD EDGES, FOR ALL BEE GUILDS, WHILE AT 50-100 M RADII, ONLY ABOVEGROUND NESTERS WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED. IN SUM, WE FOUND THAT CROP AND NON-CROP POLLINATORS ARE DISTINGUISHED BY BEHAVIORAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS. HENCE, ANALYSIS OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF BEE COMMUNITIES CAN HELP ASSESS THE POLLINATION SERVICES THEY ARE LIKELY TO PROVIDE (WHEN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SINGLE-VISIT POLLINATION EFFICIENCY).

THE PRESENCE OF BOTH WHITE AND BRIGHT PURPLE FLOWERS ON THE SAME PLANT IN THE NEW ZEALAND ALPINE ANNUAL CREEPING EYEBRIGHT (EUPHRASIA DYERIWETTST.) PROVIDES AN IDEAL OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FLOWER COLOUR IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE COLOURED FLOWERS ARE RARE. THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG FLOWER AGE, GENDER PHASE, REWARD AVAILABILITY AND PETAL COLOUR WERE ASSESSED IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF E.DYERI. THE EFFECT OF POLLINATION ON FLOWER COLOUR WAS TESTED USING HAND POLLINATION OF BAGGED FLOWERS. DIRECT OBSERVATIONS AND VIDEOS OF FLOWERS WERE USED TO ASSESS PATTERNS OF FLOWER VISITATION BY NATIVE AND INTRODUCED POLLINATORS. UNPOLLINATED WHITE E.DYERI FLOWERS CHANGED FROM WHITE TO PURPLE WITHIN 6 DAYS. HOWEVER, POLLINATION OF WHITE FLOWERS TRIGGERED A SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER COLOUR CHANGE, TYPICALLY WITHIN 1-2 DAYS. WHITE FLOWERS HAD RECEPTIVE STIGMAS, LARGE AMOUNTS OF LIPID-RICH POLLEN AND SMALL AMOUNTS OF NECTAR, WHEREAS STIGMAS OF PURPLE FLOWERS ARE NOT RECEPTIVE AND FLOWERS DID NOT PROVIDE POLLEN OR NECTAR REWARDS. FLOWERS WERE MAINLY VISITED BY NATIVE SYRPHID FLIES. BOTH NATIVE SYRPHIDS AND INTRODUCED BOMBUS BEES SHOWED A MARKED AVOIDANCE OF PURPLE FLOWERS, TENDING TO PREFERENTIALLY VISIT WHITE FLOWERS.

A LONGITUDINAL GREENHOUSE STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF POLLEN IN THE INFECTION PROCESS OF ALFALFA FLORETS BY B. CINEREA. THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATION (POLLINATED VS UNPOLLINATED) AND INOCULATION METHOD (DRY VS AQUEOUS SUSPENSION) ON FLORET AND POLLEN INFECTION WAS TESTED. FLORETS WERE HARVESTED AT 0, 24, 48 AND 94H AFTER INOCULATION. POLLINATED FLORETS THAT WERE DRY INOCULATED HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER LEVELS OF INFECTION (84\%) THAN SIMILARLY INOCULATED UNPOLLINATED FLORETS (38\%, P<0.001), HOWEVER NO POLLEN INFECTION WAS OBSERVED. IN CONTRAST, 90\% OF SUSPENSION-INOCULATED FLORETS WERE INFECTED AND A SMALL (<1\%) BUT SIGNIFICANT (P<0.0001) LEVEL OF INFECTED POLLEN WAS OBSERVED IN THESE SAMPLES.

APPL.,"LAND-USE DRIVEN HABITAT MODIFICATION IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND IMPOVERISHMENT OF INTERACTION DIVERSITY. THIS MAY AFFECT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS POLLINATION AND BIOLOGICAL CONTROL. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF LOCAL (NESTING ENVIRONMENT: FARMS VS. TREE STANDS) AND LANDSCAPE (FOREST-CROPLAND GRADIENT) FACTORS ON THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF A CAVITY-NESTING BEE-WASP (CNBW) COMMUNITY, THEIR NESTS ASSOCIATES (HENCEFORTH PARASITOIDS), AND THEIR INTERACTIONS. WE SET UP 24 NEST-TRAPPING STATIONS IN A FRAGMENTED, EXTENSIVELY FARMED AREA OF SIMILAR TO 100 KM(2). WE OBTAINED 2035 NESTS CONTAINING 7572 BROOD CELLS REPRESENTING 17 BEE AND 18 WASP SPECIES, ATTACKED BY 20 PARASITOID SPECIES. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION, AS WELL AS NETWORK STRUCTURE, WERE MUCH MORE DEPENDENT ON LOCAL THAN ON LANDSCAPE FACTORS. HOST ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS WERE HIGHER IN FARMS. IN ADDITION, HOST ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO CROPLAND COVER. WE ALSO FOUND HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NESTING ENVIRONMENTS IN HOST COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE PARASITOID COMMUNITY WERE CONDITIONED BY THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF THE HOST COMMUNITY. NETWORK STRUCTURE WAS AFFECTED BY NESTING ENVIRONMENT BUT NOT BY LANDSCAPE FACTORS. INTERACTIONS TENDED TO BE MORE DIVERSE IN FARMS. THIS RESULT WAS MOSTLY EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN NETWORK SIZE (GREATER IN FARMS). HOWEVER, GENERALITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN FARMS EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR NETWORK SIZE, INDICATING THAT DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES' INTERACTION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED TO DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BETWEEN THE TWO NESTING ENVIRONMENTS ARE ALSO AFFECTING NETWORK STRUCTURE. IN CONCLUSION, OPEN HABITATS ASSOCIATED WITH EXTENSIVELY FARMED EXPLOITATIONS FAVOR LOCAL CNBW DIVERSITY (ESPECIALLY BEES) AND RESULT IN MORE COMPLEX HOST-PARASITOID INTERACTION NETWORKS IN COMPARISON TO FORESTED AREAS. THE CONSERVATION VALUE OF THIS KIND OF OPEN HABITAT IS IMPORTANT IN VIEW OF THE PROGRESSIVE ABANDONMENT OF EXTENSIVELY CULTIVATED FARMLAND TAKING PLACE IN EUROPE AT THE EXPENSE OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND REFORESTATION.",CROP-FOREST GRADIENT; ECOSYSTEMS SERVICES; EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURE; EXTENSIVE FARMING; HOST-PARASITOID FOOD WEB; POLLINATORS; TRAP-NESTING BEES AND WASPS,TRAP-NESTING BEES; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; CONTEXT AFFECTS; FOOD WEBS; BODY-SIZE; DIVERSITY; WASPS; BIODIVERSITY; POLLINATORS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"OSORIO, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CREAF CTR ECOL RES \& FORESTRY APPLICAT, BARCELONA 08193, SPAIN.;OSORIO, SERGIO, ARNAN, XAVIER, BOSCH, JORDI, CREAF CTR ECOL RES \& FORESTRY APPLICAT, BARCELONA 08193, SPAIN.;ARNAN, XAVIER, TECH UNIV DARMSTADT, FAC BIOL, D-64287 DARMSTADT, GERMANY.",10.1890/14-2476.1,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"CIUTAT D'OLOT GRANT; SPANISH MICINNSPANISH GOVERNMENT [CICYT CGL2009-12646, CSD2008-0040]; GENERALITAT DE CATALUNYAGENERALITAT DE CATALUNYA [2012 FI SO080484]","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE FARMERS WHO ALLOWED US TO WORK IN THEIR PROPERTIES, AND TO SEVERAL SPECIALISTS (L.

BIOGEOGR.,"AIMINEQUALITY BETWEEN RATES OF FORWARD AND BACKWARD DISPERSAL IS ONE MECHANISM THAT WILL PRODUCE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN BIOTIC COMPOSITION. ANY SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL AFFECT ECOSYSTEM ASSEMBLY. THUS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY UNEQUAL DISPERSAL RATES MIGHT OCCUR. RECENT STUDIES HAVE INDICATED STRONG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORWARD AND BACKWARD DISPERSAL IN TWO MAJOR BEE GROUPS, HYLAEINAE AND ALLODAPINI. HERE, WE USE A THIRD BEE GROUP, TRIBE CERATININI, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS MIGHT BE A MORE GENERAL PHENOMENON. LOCATIONWORLDWIDE. METHODSCERATININI IS GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED (EXCEPTING ANTARCTICA) AND CONTAINS THE SINGLE GENUS CERATINA AND 21 SUBGENERA, MOST OF WHICH ARE ENDEMIC TO CONTINENTS. WE EXAMINED THE PHYLOGENY OF CERATININI USING SEQUENCE DATA FROM THREE GENES AND 99 SPECIES, AND INFERRED ANCESTRAL DISTRIBUTIONS USING BAYESIAN AND MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD APPROACHES. RESULTSWE SHOW THAT THE TRIBE CERATININI HAD AN AFRICAN ORIGIN IN THE EARLY EOCENE. THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY FOUR DISPERSALS OUT OF AFRICA IN THE EOCENE AND EARLY OLIGOCENE AND THREE FURTHER DISPERSALS BETWEEN THE MIOCENE AND THE PRESENT. THERE HAS BEEN NO BACK-DISPERSAL OF CERATININI TO AFRICA. THE LACK OF BACK-DISPERSAL CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY SPECIES ABUNDANCE IN NON-AFRICAN REGIONS, AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO BACK-DISPERSAL SEEM UNLIKELY. MAIN CONCLUSIONSOUR RESULTS ARE SIMILAR TO FINDINGS FOR TWO OTHER MAJOR BEE GROUPS AND INDICATE THAT BACK-DISPERSAL IS VERY RARE. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT PHYSICAL BARRIERS CAN EXPLAIN THESE PATTERNS. HOWEVER, DISPERSAL PATTERNS MIGHT BE EXPLAINED BY ASSEMBLY RULES SUCH AS NICHE PRE-EMPTION OR BY REDUCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR ESCAPING INTO ENEMY-FREE SPACE.

ALUMINIUM IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT OF RECENT TIMES AND WE SPECULATED THAT IT COULD BE A FACTOR IN POLLINATOR DECLINE. HEREIN WE HAVE MEASURED THE CONTENT OF ALUMINIUM IN BUMBLEBEE PUPAE TAKEN FROM NATURALLY FORAGING COLONIES IN THE UK. INDIVIDUAL PUPAE WERE ACID-DIGESTED IN A MICROWAVE OVEN AND THEIR ALUMINIUM CONTENT DETERMINED USING TRANSVERSELY HEATED GRAPHITE FURNACE ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRY.

MEAN ALUMINIUM CONTENT WAS SHOWN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE PREDICTOR OF AVERAGE PUPAL WEIGHT IN COLONIES.

MANAGE.,"WE INVESTIGATED THE RATE OF POLLEN-MEDIATED FLOW AND REALIZED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AT INCREASING DISTANCES FROM THE SOURCE, ACROSS FRAGMENTED CLONAL STANDS OF HYBRID EUCALYPTS IN BRAZIL BY PARENTAGE ANALYSIS OF GROWN OUT SEEDLINGS USING GENETIC DATA AT 15 MICROSATELLITE MARKERS. TWO STUDY AREAS WERE EMPLOYED: A POLLEN DONOR AREA COMPOSED OF A CLONAL STAND OF A SINGLE POLLEN DONOR CLONE (PD) AND A POLLEN SINK (PS) AREA COMPOSED OF A MIXED CLONAL STAND OF TWO OTHER CLONES (PSI AND PS2). IN THE POLLEN SINK AREA FOUR PLOTS WITH 30 TREES EACH, LOCATED AT 25, 200, 400 AND 550 M FROM THE PD WERE ESTABLISHED AS SINK ISLANDS. BEFORE FLOWERING, THE ENTIRE CLONAL STANDS OF CLONES PSI AND PS2, WITH EXCEPTION OF THE SINK ISLANDS WERE CLEAR CUT. SEEDS WERE HARVESTED FROM FIVE RANDOMLY SAMPLED TREES IN EACH SINK ISLAND AND THE PATERNITY OF 15 SEEDLINGS PER TREE, 75 SEEDLINGS PER ISLAND TOTALING A SAMPLE OF 300 SEEDLINGS, WAS DETERMINED WITH PD AS THE ALLEGED FATHER. THE SELF-POLLINATION RATE IN THE SINK ISLANDS VARIED FROM ZERO TO 24\%. PATERNITY ASSIGNMENT TO THE PD WAS HIGHEST IN THE ISLAND AT 25 M (17.3\%) AND RAPIDLY DECREASED TO 4.0\% AT 200 M AND 2.7\% AT 550 M, SUGGESTING A PATTERN OF ISOLATION BY DISTANCE, WHILE REVEALING A LARGE POLLEN CONTRIBUTION FROM UNACCOUNTED SOURCES ACROSS ALL ISLANDS. OUR RESULTS IN A FRAGMENTED CLONAL SITE AGREE WITH PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF GENERAL POLLEN MOVEMENT IN EUCALYPT SEED ORCHARDS, SHOWING THAT POLLINATION WILL TAKE PLACE BY AND LARGE AT RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCES OF LESS THAN 200 M, CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED RANGE OF FLIGHT OF POLLINATOR BEES. NEVERTHELESS THE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OBSERVED ALSO INDICATES THAT LOW LEVELS OF POLLINATION SUCCESS ARE TO BE EXPECTED OVER LONGER DISTANCES. OUR DATA PROVIDE USEFUL GUIDELINES REGARDING THE DISTANCE AT WHICH SEED ORCHARDS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AWAY FROM POTENTIALLY LARGE POLLEN PRESSURE OF CLONAL STANDS TO MINIMIZE UNWANTED POLLEN INTROGRESSION. FURTHERMORE, OUR RESULTS ON DISPERSAL RATE AND DISTANCE OF POLLEN HAVE DIRECT IMPLICATIONS ON GENE CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES AND MODELING STUDIES, AS POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW IS ONE OF THE KEY DETERMINANTS OF THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND BIOSAFETY IMPACTS OF PROSPECTIVE TRANSGENIC EUCALYPTS.

ENTOMOL.,"1. CHANGES TO PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AFTER INVASION ARE WELL DOCUMENTED BUT HOW THESE SHIFTS DIRECTLY AFFECT HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS IS STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ONE POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT FACTOR IS THE CHANGE IN NUTRITIONAL AVAILABILITY AFTER AN INVASION. SHIFTS IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY COULD AFFECT THE NUTRIENT INTAKE OF ORGANISMS THAT LIVE IN INVADED HABITATS, CAUSING REDUCED FECUNDITY AND SURVIVAL. 2. THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERACTION AMONG NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, SELECTION, AND DIET ON NUTRIENT INTAKE OF A NATIVE BUMBLE BEE WERE EXAMINED. NO NUTRITIONAL DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN EXOTIC AND NATIVE POLLEN OR COLLECTED AND NON-COLLECTED POLLEN IN PROTEIN OR AMINO ACID CONTENT, SUGGESTING THAT DIFFERENCES IN NUTRIENT INTAKE FROM RANDOM ARE BASED ON SELECTION. 3. NUTRIENT INTAKE WAS SIMULATED WHEN POLLEN WAS SELECTED RANDOMLY ACROSS ALL AVAILABLE PLANT SPECIES AND WHEN SELECTION WAS RESTRICTED TO NATIVE PLANTS ONLY OR EXOTIC PLANTS ONLY USING A PERMUTATION MODEL AND COMPARED WITH OBSERVED COLLECTION. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLEN COLLECTION IS NON-RANDOM AND THAT SELECTING ONLY NATIVE OR EXOTIC PLANTS CANNOT PROVIDE THE PROTEIN OR AMINO ACID INTAKE OBSERVED. 4. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY THE RESPONSES OF NATIVE BEES TO EXOTIC PLANTS ARE SO VARIABLE.

WE PRESENT THE FIRST MOLECULAR-BASED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN ANTHIDIINI USING MODEL-BASED METHODS AND A LARGE, MULTI-LOCUS DATASET (FIVE NUCLEAR GENES, 5081 BASE PAIRS), AS WELL AS A COMBINED ANALYSIS USING OUR MOLECULAR DATASET IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED MORPHOLOGICAL MATRIX. WE DISCUSS THE EVOLUTION OF NESTING BEHAVIOR IN ANTHIDIINI AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NESTING MATERIAL AND FEMALE MANDIBULAR MORPHOLOGY. FOLLOWING AN EXAMINATION OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS HISTORICALLY USED TO RECOGNIZE ANTHIDIINE GENERA, WE RECOMMEND THE USE OF A MOLECULAR-BASED PHYLOGENETIC BACKBONE TO DEFINE TAXONOMIC GROUPS PRIOR TO THE ASSIGNMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS FOR THESE GROUPS.

SCI. POLLUT. RES.,"PESTICIDES HAVE BECOME AN INSEPARABLE ELEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. WHILE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF PESTICIDES ON NON-TARGET ORGANISMS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS, HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION, LESS CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE MICROORGANISMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. SPECIALIST YEASTS AND BACTERIA ARE KNOWN TO COMMONLY INHABIT FLORAL NECTAR AND CHANGE ITS CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN NUMEROUS WAYS, POSSIBLY INFLUENCING POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE IN VITRO SUSCEPTIBILITY OF NECTAR YEASTS METSCHNIKOWIA GRUESSI, METSCHNIKOWIA REUKAUFII, AND CANDIDA BOMBI TO SIX WIDELY USED AGRICULTURAL FUNGICIDES (PROTHIOCONAZOLE, TEBUCONAZOLE, AZOXYSTROBIN, FENAMIDONE, BOSCALID, AND FLUOPYRAM). NEXT, A COMMERCIAL ANTIFUNGAL MIXTURE CONTAINING TEBUCONAZOLE AND TRIFLOXYSTROBIN WAS APPLIED TO NATURAL POPULATIONS OF THE PLANT LINARIA VULGARIS AND THE OCCURRENCE, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY OF NECTAR-INHABITING YEASTS AND BACTERIA WAS COMPARED BETWEEN TREATED AND UNTREATED PLANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PROTHIOCONAZOLE AND TEBUCONAZOLE WERE HIGHLY TOXIC TO NECTAR YEASTS, INHIBITING THEIR GROWTH AT CONCENTRATIONS VARYING BETWEEN 0.06 AND 0.5 MG/L. AZOXYSTROBIN, FENAMIDONE, BOSCALID, AND FLUOPYRAM ON THE OTHER HAND EXHIBITED CONSIDERABLY LOWER TOXICITY, INHIBITING YEAST GROWTH AT CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 1 AND 32 MG/L OR IN MANY CASES NOT INHIBITING MICROBIAL GROWTH AT ALL. THE APPLICATION OF THE ANTIFUNGAL MIXTURE IN NATURAL PLANT POPULATIONS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF YEASTS IN INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS, BUT THIS DID NOT TRANSLATE INTO NOTICEABLE CHANGES IN BACTERIAL INCIDENCE AND ABUNDANCE. YEAST AND BACTERIAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND DISTRIBUTION DID NOT ALSO DIFFER BETWEEN TREATED AND UNTREATED PLANTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE APPLICATION OF FUNGICIDES MAY HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF NECTAR YEASTS IN FLORAL NECTAR.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PLANT POLLINATOR INTERPLAY (PPI), IN FLOWERING CROPS SUCH AS LEGUMES LIES IN A COMBINATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATION FOR THE PRODUCTION SERVICE AND BREEDING STRATEGIES, PLUS THE INCREASING URGENCY IN MITIGATING THE DECLINE OF POLLINATORS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSERVATION MEASURES. TO REALIZE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF THE PPI, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH IS REQUIRED. THIS ARTICLE ASSEMBLES AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM OF GENEBANK MANAGERS, GENETICISTS, PLANT BREEDERS, EXPERTS ON ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE AND AGRO-ECOLOGY, AND COMPRISES SEVERAL SECTIONS. THE CONTRIBUTIONS IN THESE SECTIONS OUTLINE BOTH THE STATE OF THE ART OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD AND THE NOVEL ASPECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND ENCOMPASS A RANGE OF REVIEWS, OPINIONS AND PERSPECTIVES. THE FIRST THREE SECTIONS EXPLORE THE ROLE OF PPI IN LEGUME BREEDING STRATEGIES. PPI BASED APPROACHES TO CROP IMPROVEMENT CAN MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ADAPT AND RE-DESIGN BREEDING STRATEGIES TO MEET BOTH GOALS OF: (1) OPTIMAL PRODUCTIVITY, BASED ON AN EFFICIENT USE OF POLLINATORS, AND (2) BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION.

AREAS J.,"HEALTHY PLANT COMMUNITIES OF THE AMERICAN SAGEBRUSH STEPPE CONSIST OF MOSTLY WIND-POLLINATED SHRUBS AND GRASSES INTERSPERSED WITH A DIVERSE MIX OF MOSTLY SPRING-BLOOMING, HERBACEOUS PERENNIAL WILDFLOWERS. NATIVE, NONSOCIAL BEES ARE THEIR COMMON FLORAL VISITORS, BUT THEIR FLORAL ASSOCIATIONS AND ABUNDANCES ARE POORLY KNOWN. EXTRAPOLATING FROM THE FEW AVAILABLE POLLINATION STUDIES, BEES ARE THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS NEEDED FOR SEED PRODUCTION. BEES, THEREFORE, WILL UNDERPIN THE SUCCESS OF AMBITIOUS SEEDING EFFORTS TO RESTORE NATIVE FORBS TO IMPOVERISHED SAGEBRUSH STEPPE COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING VAST WILDFIRES. THIS STUDY QUANTITATIVELY CHARACTERIZED THE FLORAL GUILDS OF 17 PREVALENT WILDFLOWER SPECIES OF THE GREAT BASIN THAT ARE, OR COULD BE, AVAILABLE FOR RESTORATION SEED MIXES. MORE THAN 3800 BEES REPRESENTING >170 SPECIES WERE SAMPLED FROM >35,000 PLANTS. SPECIES OF OSMIA, ANDRENA, BOMBUS, EUCERA, HALICTUS, AND LASIOGLOSSUM BEES PREVAILED.

SOCIOBIOL.,"THE PROGRESSION FROM SOLITARY LIVING TO CASTE-BASED SOCIALITY IS COMMONLY REGARDED AS A MAJOR EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITION. HOWEVER, IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN THAT IN SOME TAXA, SOCIALITY MAY BE PLASTIC AND DEPENDENT ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. IF SOCIALITY CAN BE ENVIRONMENTALLY DRIVEN, THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO HOW PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL INFLUENCE FEATURES OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE OF MACROEVOLUTIONARY PROPORTIONS. DEPENDING ON THE TIME AVAILABLE IN SPRING DURING WHICH A FOUNDRESS CAN PRODUCE WORKER OFFSPRING, THE SWEAT BEE HALICTUS RUBICUNDUS IS EITHER SOCIAL OR SOLITARY. WE ANALYSED DETAILED FORAGING DATA IN RELATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS FOR GREAT BRITAIN TO ASSESS WHEN AND WHERE SWITCHES FROM A SOLITARY TO SOCIAL LIFESTYLE MAY BE EXPECTED. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WORKER NUMBERS SHOULD INCREASE THROUGHOUT GREAT BRITAIN UNDER PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS, AND IMPORTANTLY, THAT SOCIALITY SHOULD APPEAR IN NORTHERN AREAS WHERE IT HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN OBSERVED. THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT IN SOCIAL ORGANISATION DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD LEAD TO A BIGGER WORKFORCE BEING AVAILABLE FOR SUMMER POLLINATION AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS MITIGATING THE CURRENT POLLINATOR CRISIS. THE SWEAT BEE HALICTUS RUBICUNDUS IS SOCIALLY POLYMORPHIC, EXPRESSING BOTH SOLITARY AND SOCIAL FORMS, AND IS SOCIALLY PLASTIC, CAPABLE OF TRANSITIONING FROM SOLITARY TO SOCIAL FORMS, DEPENDING ON LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HERE, WE ANALYSE DETAILED FORAGING DATA IN RELATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS FOR GREAT BRITAIN TO SHOW THAT WORKER NUMBERS AND SOCIALITY BOTH INCREASE UNDER PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS. ESPECIALLY DRAMATIC WILL BE THE APPEARANCE OF SOCIAL H. RUBICUNDUS NESTS IN THE NORTH OF BRITAIN, WHERE PREVIOUSLY ONLY SOLITARY FORMS ARE FOUND.

EVOL.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS - APIOS PRICEANA IS A RARE FLOWERING PLANT THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THIS PLANT AND ONLY A FEW INSECT FLOWER VISITORS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FURTHER DOCUMENT THE INSECT FLOWER VISITORS OF A. PRICEANA IN NORTH ALABAMA. METHODS - CAMERAS AND OBSERVERS RECORDED FLOWER VISITORS DURING THE 2014 BLOOMING SEASON OF A LARGE NORTH ALABAMA POPULATION OF A. PRICEANA. KEY RESULTS - ALTHOUGH FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF INSECTS WERE DOCUMENTED ON FLOWERS OF A. PRICEANA, MOST PERFORMED A SINGLE OR VERY FEW VISITS. BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.), TWO SPECIES OF MEGACHILIDAE (MEGACHILE SCULPTURALIS AND MEGACHILE CAMPANULAE), AND THE HUMMINGBIRD CLEARWING (HEMARIS THYSBE) WERE THE MOST COMMON VISITORS. INTERESTINGLY, THE GIANT RESIN BEE, M. SCULPTURALIS, IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN INVASIVE SPECIES BUT IN THIS CASE MAY BE POLLINATING A NATIVE AND FEDERALLY THREATENED PLANT. CONCLUSION - ALTHOUGH A.

ENTOMOL.,"URBAN GARDENS MAY PRESERVE BIODIVERSITY AS URBAN POPULATION DENSITIES INCREASE, BUT THIS STRONGLY DEPENDS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GARDENS AND THE LANDSCAPES IN WHICH THEY ARE EMBEDDED. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS ARE IMPORTANT CORRELATES OF BEE (HYMENOPTERA: APIFORMES) ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN URBAN COMMUNITY GARDENS. WE WORKED IN 19 GARDENS IN THE CALIFORNIA CENTRAL COAST AND SAMPLED BEES WITH AERIAL NETS AND PAN TRAPS. WE MEASURED LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS (I.E., VEGETATION AND GROUND COVER) AND USED THE USGS NATIONAL LAND COVER DATABASE TO CLASSIFY THE LANDSCAPE SURROUNDING OUR GARDEN STUDY SITES AT 2 KM SCALES. WE CLASSIFIED BEES ACCORDING TO NESTING TYPE (I.E., CAVITY, GROUND) AND BODY SIZE AND DETERMINED WHICH LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS CORRELATE WITH BEE COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS. WE FOUND 55 BEE SPECIES. ONE LANDSCAPE AND SEVERAL LOCAL FACTORS CORRELATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS FOR ALL BEES, CAVITY-NESTING BEES, GROUND-NESTING BEES, AND DIFFERENT SIZED BEES. GENERALLY, BEES WERE MORE ABUNDANT AND SPECIES RICH IN BIGGER GARDENS, IN GARDENS WITH HIGHER FLORAL ABUNDANCE, LESS MULCH COVER, MORE BARE GROUND, AND WITH MORE GRASS. MEDIUM BEES WERE LESS ABUNDANT IN SITES SURROUNDED BY MORE MEDIUM INTENSITY DEVELOPED LAND WITHIN 2 KM. THE FACT THAT LOCAL FACTORS WERE GENERALLY MORE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS INDICATES A POTENTIAL FOR GARDENERS TO PROMOTE BEE CONSERVATION BY ALTERING LOCAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.

ARMIGERA LURES WERE EMPLOYED IN A PARALLEL STUDY INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF LURE AND TRAP COLOR ON BYCATCH. OVER 2,600 COCCINELLIDAE REPRESENTING SEVEN SPECIES, NEARLY 6,400 BEES IN 57 SPECIES, AND >9,000 NONTARGET MOTHS IN 17 GENERA WERE CAPTURED ACROSS 180 TRAPS AND SEVEN TEMPORAL SAMPLING EVENTS. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF LURE AND COLOR WERE OBSERVED FOR MULTIPLE TAXA. IN GENERAL, NONTARGET INSECTS WERE ATTRACTED TO THE H.

OUADFEL S;TALEB-AHMED A,OUADFEL S,SOCIAL SPIDERS OPTIMIZATION AND FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM FOR MULTILEVEL IMAGE THRESHOLDING: A PERFORMANCE STUDY,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS,EXPERT SYST. APPL.,"IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF TWO NEW NATURE-INSPIRED METAHEURISTICS NAMELY THE FLOWER POLLINATION (FP) AND THE SOCIAL SPIDERS OPTIMIZATION (SSO) ALGORITHMS TO SOLVE THE IMAGE SEGMENTATION PROBLEM VIA MULTILEVEL THRESHOLDING. THE FP ALGORITHM IS INSPIRED FROM THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESS OF FLOWER POLLINATION. IT RELIES ON TWO BASIC MECHANISMS TO GENERATE NEW SOLUTIONS. THE FIRST ONE IS THE GLOBAL POLLINATION MODELED IN TERMS OF A LEVY DISTRIBUTION WHILE THE SECOND ONE IS THE LOCAL POLLINATION THAT IS BASED ON RANDOM SELECTION OF LOCAL SOLUTIONS. FOR ITS PART, THE SSO ALGORITHM MIMICS DIFFERENT NATURAL COOPERATIVE BEHAVIORS OF A SPIDER COLONY. IT CONSIDERS MALE AND FEMALE SEARCH AGENTS SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT EVOLUTIONARY OPERATORS. IN THE TWO PROPOSED ALGORITHMS, CANDIDATE SOLUTIONS ARE FIRSTLY GENERATED USING THE IMAGE HISTOGRAM. THEN, THEY ARE EVOLVED ACCORDING TO THE DYNAMICS OF THEIR CORRESPONDING OPERATORS. DURING THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS ARE EVALUATED USING THE BETWEEN-CLASS VARIANCE OR KAPUR'S METHOD. THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF THE TWO PROPOSED APPROACHES HAS BEEN ASSESSED USING A VARIETY OF BENCHMARK IMAGES AND COMPARED AGAINST TWO OTHER NATURE INSPIRED ALGORITHMS FROM THE LITERATURE NAMELY PSO AND BAT ALGORITHMS. RESULTS HAVE BEEN ANALYZED BOTH QUALITATIVELY AND QUANTITATIVELY BASED ON THE FITNESS VALUES OF OBTAINED BEST SOLUTIONS AND TWO POPULAR PERFORMANCE MEASURES NAMELY PSNR AND SSIM INDICES AS WELL. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THAT BOTH SSO AND FP ALGORITHMS OUTPERFORM PSO AND BAT ALGORITHMS WHILE EXHIBITING EQUAL PERFORMANCE FOR SMALL NUMBERS OF THRESHOLDS. FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF THRESHOLDS, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE PERFORMANCE OF FP ALGORITHM DECREASES AS IT IS OFTEN TRAPPED IN LOCAL MINIMA. IN CONTRARY, THE SSO ALGORITHM PROVIDES A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION AND HAS SHOWN TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND THE MOST STABLE FOR ALL IMAGES EVEN WITH THE INCREASE OF THE THRESHOLD NUMBER. THESE PROMISING RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SSO ALGORITHM CAN BE EFFECTIVELY CONSIDERED AS AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE FOR THE MULTILEVEL IMAGE THRESHOLDING PROBLEM. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER LTD.

EVOL.,"INCREASING HUMAN LAND USE FOR AGRICULTURE AND HOUSING LEADS TO THE LOSS OF NATURAL HABITAT AND TO WIDESPREAD DECLINES IN WILD BEES. BEE FORAGING DYNAMICS AND FITNESS DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, BUT HOW PRECISELY LANDSCAPE RELATED RESOURCE DIFFERENCES AFFECT BEE FORAGING PATTERNS REMAINS UNCLEAR. TO INVESTIGATE HOW LANDSCAPE AND ITS INTERACTION WITH SEASON AND WEATHER DRIVE FORAGING AND RESOURCE INTAKE IN SOCIAL BEES, WE EXPERIMENTALLY COMPARED FORAGING ACTIVITY, THE ALLOCATION OF FORAGERS TO DIFFERENT RESOURCES (POLLEN, NECTAR, AND RESIN) AND OVERALL RESOURCE INTAKE IN THE AUSTRALIAN STINGLESS BEE TETRAGONULA CARBONARIA (APIDAE, MELIPONINI). BEE COLONIES WERE MONITORED IN DIFFERENT SEASONS OVER TWO YEARS. WE COMPARED FORAGING PATTERNS AND RESOURCE INTAKE BETWEEN THE BEES' NATURAL HABITAT (FORESTS) AND TWO LANDSCAPES DIFFERENTLY ALTERED BY HUMANS (SUBURBAN GARDENS AND AGRICULTURAL MACADAMIA PLANTATIONS). WE FOUND FORAGING ACTIVITY AS WELL AS POLLEN AND NECTAR FORAGER NUMBERS TO BE HIGHEST IN SUBURBAN GARDENS, INTERMEDIATE IN FORESTS AND LOW IN PLANTATIONS. FORAGING PATTERNS FURTHER DIFFERED BETWEEN SEASONS, BUT SEASONAL VARIATIONS STRONGLY DIFFERED BETWEEN LANDSCAPES. SUGAR AND POLLEN INTAKE WAS LOW IN PLANTATIONS, BUT CONTRARY WITH OUR PREDICTIONS, IT WAS EVEN HIGHER IN GARDENS THAN IN FORESTS. IN CONTRAST, RESIN INTAKE WAS SIMILAR ACROSS LANDSCAPES. CONSEQUENTLY, DIFFERENCES IN RESOURCE AVAILABILITY BETWEEN NATURAL AND ALTERED LANDSCAPES STRONGLY AFFECT FORAGING PATTERNS AND THUS RESOURCE INTAKE IN SOCIAL BEES. WHILE AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES LARGELY REDUCE FORAGING SUCCESS, SUBURBAN GARDENS CAN INCREASE RESOURCE INTAKE WELL ABOVE RATES FOUND IN NATURAL HABITATS OF BEES, INDICATING THAT HUMAN ACTIVITIES CAN BOTH DECREASE AND INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES IN A LANDSCAPE AND THUS REDUCE OR ENHANCE BEE FITNESS.",ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES; CLIMATE FACTORS; MELIPONINES; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; URBANIZATION,STINGLESS BEES; HONEY-BEES; OFFSPRING PRODUCTION; POLLINATOR DECLINES; INSECT POLLINATORS; MACADAMIA FLOWERS; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; WILD POLLINATORS; FLORAL RESOURCES; FLIGHT ACTIVITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,31,"LEONHARDT, SD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WURZBURG, DEPT ANIM ECOL \& TROP BIOL, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., LEUPHANA UNIV, INST ECOL, D-21335 LUNEBURG, GERMANY.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., WALLACE, HELEN, UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, FAC SCI HLTH EDUC \& ENGN, MAROOCHYDORE 4558, AUSTRALIA.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., LEONHARDT, SARA D., UNIV WURZBURG, DEPT ANIM ECOL \& TROP BIOL, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;HEARD, TIM A., CSIRO ECOSYST SCI, BRISBANE, QLD 4001, AUSTRALIA.;KLEIN, ALEXANDRA-MARIA, UNIV FREIBURG, CHAIR NAT NAT CONSERVAT \& LANDSCAPE ECOL, D-79085 FREIBURG, GERMANY.",10.1002/ECE3.1941,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE AGENCY (DAAD)DEUTSCHER AKADEMISCHER AUSTAUSCH DIENST (DAAD); GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG)GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [LE 2750/1-1]; DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [LE 2750/1-1],"BFK RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE AGENCY (DAAD).

HOWEVER, MANAGING THIS IMPORTANT GROUP MUST BE BALANCED WITH OTHER SERVICES THAT NATURAL AREAS PROVIDE INCLUDING HUNTING, TIMBER PRODUCTION, AND LIVESTOCK GRAZING. SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE GAPS EXIST ABOUT HOW TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HABITATS USED BY LARGE UNGULATES (E.G., CATTLE (BOS TAURUS), ELK (CERVUS ELAPHUS), MULE DEER (ODOCOILEUS HEMIONUS)) IN WAYS THAT ALSO ENHANCE POLLINATORS.

INCREASING NUMBERS OF SPECIES ARE THREATENED BY OVEREXPLOITATION AND THEIR RECOVERY MIGHT BE POOR DUE TO LOW REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND POOR REGENERATION RATES. ONE OF THE FIRST STEPS IN DEVELOPING ANY CONSERVATION POLICY SHOULD BE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF SPECIES THAT ARE THREATENED BY OVEREXPLOITATION. THIS WORK AIMED TO STUDY THE FLOWERING BIOLOGY, POLLINATION AND BREEDING SYSTEM OF V. DONIANA, A MULTIPURPOSE THREATENED AFRICAN TREE, AS ONE STEP IN ASSESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCCESSFUL CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. TO THIS END, WE STUDIED (1) TRAITS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN POLLINATOR ATTRACTION LIKE FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, FLOWER NUMBERS AND MORPHOLOGY, AND FLORAL REWARDS, (2) ABUNDANCE, DIVERSITY AND EFFICIENCY OF FLOWER VISITORS, (3) BREEDING SYSTEM, THROUGH CONTROLLED HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING EXCLUSION OF POLLINATORS AND POLLEN FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, AND (4) OPTIMAL CONDITIONS FOR SEED GERMINATION. THE FLOWERING PHENOLOGY WAS ASYNCHRONOUS AMONG INFLORESCENCES, TREES AND SITES. THE FLOWERS PRODUCED A LARGE QUANTITY OF POLLEN AND NECTAR WITH HIGH SUGAR CONTENT. FLOWERS ATTRACTED DIVERSE AND ABUNDANT VISITORS, COUNTING BOTH INSECTS AND BIRDS, AND EFFICIENT POLLINATORS INCLUDED SEVERAL HYMENOPTERA SPECIES. WE DETECTED NO SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION, INDICATING A TOTAL DEPENDENCE ON POLLEN VECTORS. VITEX DONIANA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE AND NO INBREEDING DEPRESSION OCCURRED IN THE FIRST DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES. AFTER EXTRACTION OF THE SEED FROM THE FRUIT, SEED GERMINATION DID NOT REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR CONDITIONS OR PRE-TREATMENTS AND THE SEEDS SHOWED HIGH GERMINATION RATES.

SPECIES WITH LONGER STYLES GENERALLY RECEIVED MORE HP PER STIGMA. THE POLLEN TUBE STUDY SHOWED THAT POLLEN FROM SHORT-STYLED SPECIES COULD NOT GROW THE FULL LENGTH OF THE STYLE OF LONG-STYLED SPECIES. POLLEN FROM LONG-STYLED SPECIES COULD GROW THROUGH THE SHORT STYLE OF P.DENSISPICA, BUT P.DENSISPICA RARELY RECEIVED HP IN NATURE. FLOWER CONSTANCY IS A KEY PRE-POLLINATION BARRIER TO HPT BETWEEN CO-FLOWERING PEDICULARIS SPECIES.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS PLANT SPECIES DIFFER GREATLY IN THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS OF THEIR FLOWERS (INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE). HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF SELECTION RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIVERSITY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. STUDIES THAT EXAMINE AMONG-SPECIES VARIATION SUGGEST THAT INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE AFFECTS POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, AND SO SHOULD INFLUENCE PLANT MATING. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF WITHIN-POPULATION ARCHITECTURAL VARIATION FOR POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR. METHODS WE MANIPULATED INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE OF DELPHINIUM GLAUCUM TO CONTRAST BUMBLEBEE RESPONSES TO NORMAL AND ONE-SIDED (SECUND) INFLORESCENCES. KEY RESULTS THE `DIMENSIONALITY' OF MANIPULATED INFLORESCENCES DID NOT AFFECT THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS THAT BEES VISITED, HOWEVER, BEES MOVED UPWARD PROPORTIONALLY MORE ON SECUND INFLORESCENCES. CONCLUSIONS THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT REALISTIC WITHIN-POPULATION VARIATION IN INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE CAN MANIPULATE POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR.

SCI.,"IN A MODERN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE THE ASSURANCE OF FOOD RESOURCES IS A KEY ISSUE IN THE MAINTAINCE AND CONTROL OF FOOD NICHE FOR POLLINATORS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE EVALUATED BEE FORAGE FLORA COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY WITHIN RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS LOCATED IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, SE POLAND. WE ALSO ANALYSED THE ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS THAT USE FOOD RESOURCES ALONG RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS AND RECOGNIZED INSECT VISITORS PREFERENCE FOR SELECTED PLANT SPECIES. RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS REPRESENT VALUABLE REFUGE AREAS FOR BEE FORAGE FLORA (307 SPECIES, I.E. 76.1\% OF TOTAL FLORA) AND POLLINATORS (IN TOTAL 4172 INSECT VISITS FROM 9 TAXONOMIC GROUPS). HOWEVER, THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BEE FORAGE FLORA SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERED BETWEEN TYPES OF THE RAILWAY DISTINGUISHED BY TRAFFIC VOLUME. THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF BEE FORAGE FLORA IS NOTED ALONG THE RAILWAY WITH INTERMEDIATE TRAFFIC VOLUME. APPROX. 25\% AND 40\% LESS BEE FORAGE SPECIES WAS IDENTIFIED ALONG RAILWAYS WITH LOW AND HIGH TRAFFIC VOLUME. LIKEWISE, BEE FORAGE FLORA DIFFERED CONSIDERABLY BETWEEN MICROHABITAT TYPES, I.E. TOP VS. SLOPE VS. BOTTOM OF THE EMBANKMENT. PROVIDING SUPPORT (E.G. MOWING) SEEMS TO BE AN IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT TYPE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE NATIVE BEE FORAGE FLORA PARTICULARLY ON RAILWAY EMBANKMENTS ALONG LOW AND HIGH TRAFFIC VOLUME TRACKS. SUCH ACTIVITY IS CRUCIAL TO COUNTERACT THE SPREAD OF AGGRESSIVE NON-FORAGE SPECIES (E.G. CALAMAGROSTIS EPIGEJOS, ARTEMISIA VULGARIS, PHRAGMITES COMMUNIS) AND INVASIVE SPECIES (E.G.

CHANGE BIOL.,"FIRE HAS A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF MANY ECOSYSTEMS GLOBALLY. PYRODIVERSITY, THE DIVERSITY OF FIRES WITHIN A REGION (WHERE DIVERSITY IS BASED ON FIRE CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS EXTENT, SEVERITY, AND FREQUENCY), HAS BEEN HYPOTHESIZED TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY, BUT CHANGING CLIMATE AND LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HAVE ERODED PYRODIVERSITY. TO ASSESS WHETHER CHANGES IN PYRODIVERSITY WILL HAVE IMPACTS ON ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, WE MUST FIRST UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT ENABLE PYRODIVERSITY TO SUSTAIN BIODIVERSITY, AND HOW SUCH CHANGES MIGHT INTERACT WITH OTHER DISTURBANCES SUCH AS DROUGHT. FOCUSING ON PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES IN MIXED-CONIFER FOREST WITH FREQUENT FIRE IN YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, CALIFORNIA, WE EXAMINE HOW PYRODIVERSITY, COMBINED WITH DROUGHT INTENSITY, INFLUENCES THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE FIND THAT PYRODIVERSITY IS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE RICHNESS OF THE POLLINATORS, FLOWERING PLANTS, AND PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. ON AVERAGE, A 5\% INCREASE IN PYRODIVERSITY LED TO THE GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY ONE POLLINATOR AND ONE FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES AND NEARLY TWO INTERACTIONS. WE ALSO FIND THAT A DIVERSITY OF FIRE CHARACTERISTICS CONTRIBUTES TO THE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY (-DIVERSITY) OF PLANT AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. LASTLY, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT FIRE DIVERSITY BUFFERS POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF DROUGHT-INDUCED FLORAL RESOURCE SCARCITY. FIRE DIVERSITY IS THUS IMPORTANT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF FLOWERING PLANT AND POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND PREDICTED SHIFTS IN FIRE REGIMES TO INCLUDE LESS PYRODIVERSITY COMPOUNDED WITH INCREASING DROUGHT OCCURRENCE WILL NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE THE RICHNESS OF THESE COMMUNITIES IN THIS AND OTHER FORESTED ECOSYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, LOWER HETEROGENEITY OF FIRE SEVERITY MAY ACT TO REDUCE SPATIAL TURNOVER OF PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES.

WHITNEY HM;REED A;RANDS SA;CHITTKA L;GLOVER BJ,WHITNEY HM,FLOWER IRIDESCENCE INCREASES OBJECT DETECTION IN THE INSECT VISUAL SYSTEM WITHOUT COMPROMISING OBJECT IDENTITY,CURRENT BIOLOGY,CURR. BIOL.,"IRIDESCENCE IS A FORM OF STRUCTURAL COLORATION, PRODUCED BY A RANGE OF STRUCTURES, IN WHICH HUE IS DEPENDENT ON VIEWING ANGLE [1-4]. ONE OF THESE STRUCTURES, THE DIFFRACTION GRATING, IS FOUND BOTH IN ANIMALS (FOR EXAMPLE, BEETLES [2]) AND IN PLANTS (ON THE PETALS OF SOME ANIMAL POLLINATED FLOWERS [5]). THE BEHAVIORAL IMPACTS OF FLORAL IRIDESCENCE AND ITS POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE ARE UNKNOWN [6-9]. ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERS ARE DESCRIBED AS ``SENSORY BILLBOARDS'' [10], WITH MANY FLORAL FEATURES CONTRIBUTING TO A CONSPICUOUS DISPLAY THAT FILTERS PROSPECTIVE POLLINATORS. YET FLORAL IRIDESCENCE IS MORE SUBTLE TO THE HUMAN EYE THAN THAT OF MANY ANIMAL DISPLAYS BECAUSE THE FLORAL DIFFRACTION GRATING IS NOT PERFECTLY REGULAR [5-9]. THIS PRESENTS A PUZZLE: IF THE FUNCTION OF PETALS IS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS, THEN FLOWERS MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO OPTIMIZE IRIDESCENCE TO INCREASE SHOWINESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, POLLINATORS MEMORIZE FLORAL COLORS AS CONSISTENT ADVERTISEMENTS OF REWARD QUALITY, AND IRIDESCENCE MIGHT CORRUPT FLOWER COLOR IDENTITY. HERE WE TESTED THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FLOWER DETECTABILITY AND RECOGNITION, REQUIRING BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) TO IDENTIFY ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS THAT VARIED IN PIGMENTATION AND DEGREE OF IRIDESCENCE. WE FIND THAT IRIDESCENCE DOES INCREASE TARGET DETECTABILITY BUT THAT ``PERFECT'' IRIDESCENCE (PRODUCED BY AN ARTIFICIAL DIFFRACTION GRATING) CORRUPTS TARGET IDENTITY AND BEES MAKE MANY MISTAKES. HOWEVER, ``IMPERFECT'' FLORAL IRIDESCENCE DOES NOT LEAD TO MISTAKEN TARGET IDENTITY, WHILE STILL BENEFITTING FLOWER DETECTABILITY. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT SIMILAR TRADE-OFFS MIGHT BE FOUND IN THE MANY NATURALLY ``IMPERFECT'' IRIDESCENCE-PRODUCING STRUCTURES FOUND IN ANIMAL-ANIMAL, AS WELL AS OTHER PLANT-ANIMAL, INTERACTIONS.",NA,BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT CUE; FLORAL IRIDESCENCE; COLOR DISCRIMINATION; STRUCTURAL COLOR; BUMBLEBEES; BEETLES; POLLINATORS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,21,"WHITNEY, HM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BRISTOL, SCH BIOL SCI, LIFE SCI BLDG,TYNDALL AVE, BRISTOL BS8 1TQ, AVON, ENGLAND.;GLOVER, BJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT PLANT SCI, DOWNING ST, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA, ENGLAND.;WHITNEY, HEATHER M., RANDS, SEAN A., UNIV BRISTOL, SCH BIOL SCI, LIFE SCI BLDG,TYNDALL AVE, BRISTOL BS8 1TQ, AVON, ENGLAND.;REED, ALISON, GLOVER, BEVERLEY J., UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT PLANT SCI, DOWNING ST, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA, ENGLAND.;CHITTKA, LARS, QUEEN MARY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL \& CHEM SCI, DEPT EXPT \& BIOL PSYCHOL, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND.",10.1016/J.CUB.2016.01.026,"600 TECHNOLOGY SQUARE, 5TH FLOOR, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",NA,"ERCEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC) [260920, 339347]; BBSRCBIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBSRC); ROYAL SOCIETY WOLFSON RESEARCH MERIT AWARDROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON","WE THANK DIVYKRITI CHOPRA, MATTHEW DORLING, LUCY SANDBACH, AND JAMES PHILPOTT FOR ASSISTANCE WITH EXPERIMENTS AND EDWIGE MOYROUD FOR HELPFUL DISCUSSIONS.

RES.,"POLLINATORS SUCH AS BEES AND HOVERFLIES ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AN URBAN ECOSYSTEM, SUPPORTING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BIODIVERSITY, FUNCTIONING, RESILIENCE AND VISUAL AMENITY OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THEIR URBAN HABITATS ALSO DELIVER HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BENEFITS TO SOCIETY, BY PROVIDING IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCESSING NATURE NEARBY TO THE HOMES OF A GROWING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVING IN TOWNS AND CITIES. HOWEVER, MANY POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE IN DECLINE, AND THE LOSS, DEGRADATION AND FRAGMENTATION OF NATURAL HABITATS ARE SOME OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF THIS CHANGE. URBAN PLANNERS AND OTHER PRACTITIONERS NEED EVIDENCE TO CAREFULLY PRIORITISE WHERE THEY FOCUS THEIR RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY, MULTIFUNCTIONAL GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK THAT SUPPORTS POLLINATORS AND PEOPLE. WE PROVIDE A MODELLING FRAMEWORK TO INFORM GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AS A NATURE BASED SOLUTION WITH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS. WE SHOW HOW HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS (I-ISM) INCORPORATING REMOTE SENSED VEGETATION DATA CAN PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THE INFLUENCE OF URBAN LANDCOVER COMPOSITION AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS CITIES. USING EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND, AS A CASE STUDY CITY, WE DEMONSTRATE THIS APPROACH FOR BUMBLE BEES AND HOVERFLIES, PROVIDING HIGH RESOLUTION PREDICTIVE MAPS THAT IDENTIFY POLLINATOR HABITAT HOTSPOTS AND PINCH POINTS ACROSS THE CITY.

IN APPLE, SUCCESSFUL FERTILIZATION REQUIRES POLLEN TRANSFER TO THE STIGMA, POLLEN GERMINATION, AND SUCCESSFUL POLLEN TUBE GROWTH RESULTING IN FRUIT SET. PRECISE SELECTION OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLLINIZERS FOR COMMERCIAL ORCHARDS IS NOT POSSIBLE HOWEVER, UNTIL THESE PROCESSES ARE MORE FULLY UNDERSTOOD. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO COMPARE POLLINIZERS IN TERMS OF POLLEN TUBE GROWTH AND FRUIT SET. ON TREES OF `HONEYCRISP', `FUJI', AND `GALA' FROM WHICH BEES WERE EXCLUDED, FLOWERS WERE HAND-POLLINATED USING POLLEN COLLECTED FROM CRABAPPLE ('RALPH SHAY' OR MALUS FLORIBUNDA), `DELICIOUS' AND `GOLDEN DELICIOUS'. FLOWERS WERE HARVESTED AT ONE, TWO, THREE, AND FOUR DAYS AFTER POLLINATION (DAP). POLLEN SOURCE HAD A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON POLLEN GERMINATION ON THE STIGMATIC SURFACE, NUMBER OF POLLEN TUBES PENETRATING THE STIGMA, DISTANCE OF POLLEN TUBE GROWTH DOWN THE STYLE, AND POLLEN TUBES REACHING THE BASE OF THE STYLE.

ECOL.,"RESTORATION EFFORTS OFTEN FOCUS ON PLANTS, BUT ADDITIONALLY REQUIRE THE ESTABLISHMENT AND LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE OF DIVERSE GROUPS OF NONTARGET ORGANISMS, SUCH AS BEES, FOR IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND MEETING RESTORATION GOALS. WE INVESTIGATED LONG-TERM PATTERNS IN THE RESPONSE OF BEES TO HABITAT RESTORATION BY SAMPLING BEE COMMUNITIES ALONG A 26-YEAR CHRONOSEQUENCE OF RESTORED TALLGRASS PRAIRIE IN NORTH-CENTRAL ILLINOIS, U.S.A. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINED HOW BEE COMMUNITIES CHANGED OVER TIME SINCE RESTORATION IN TERMS OF (1) ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS, (2) COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, AND (3) THE TWO COMPONENTS OF BETA DIVERSITY, ONE-TO-ONE SPECIES REPLACEMENT, AND CHANGES IN SPECIES RICHNESS. BEE ABUNDANCE AND RAW RICHNESS INCREASED WITH RESTORATION AGE FROM THE LOW LEVEL OF THE PRE-RESTORATION (AGRICULTURAL) SITES TO THE TARGET LEVEL OF THE REMNANT PRAIRIE WITHIN THE FIRST 2-3 YEARS AFTER RESTORATION, AND THESE HIGH LEVELS WERE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RESTORATION CHRONOSEQUENCE. BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF THE YOUNGEST RESTORED SITES DIFFERED FROM THAT OF PRAIRIE REMNANTS, BUT 5-7 YEARS POST-RESTORATION THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF RESTORED PRAIRIE CONVERGED WITH THAT OF REMNANTS. LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, PARTICULARLY NEARBY WOODED LAND, WAS FOUND TO AFFECT ABUNDANCE, RAREFIED RICHNESS, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. PARTITIONING OVERALL BETA DIVERSITY BETWEEN SITES INTO SPECIES REPLACEMENT AND RICHNESS EFFECTS REVEALED THAT THE MAIN DRIVER OF COMMUNITY CHANGE OVER TIME WAS THE GRADUAL ACCUMULATION OF SPECIES, RATHER THAN ONE-TO-ONE SPECIES REPLACEMENT.

BIOGEOGR.,"AIMSPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS ARE OFTEN USED TO PROJECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, MOST MODELS DO NOT CONSIDER WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF ABIOTIC FACTORS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. IF THEY CHANGE, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF HOW ABIOTIC CHANGES AFFECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS. HERE, WE USE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT HISTORICAL DATA ON SPECIES OCCURRENCES, CLIMATE AND LAND USE TO TEST WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT CLIMATIC AND LAND-USE DRIVERS AS DETERMINANTS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT OVER A PERIOD OF >60YEARS (1951-2014). LOCATIONTHE NETHERLANDS. METHODSUSING SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY-WIDE DATASET AT 5X5KM RESOLUTION, WE MODELLED THE DISTRIBUTION OF A TOTAL OF 398 POLLINATOR SPECIES (BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES) FOR THREE PERIODS (1951-1970, 1971-1990 AND 1998-2014). WE THEN EVALUATED WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABLES RELATED TO CLIMATE (PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE) AND LAND USE (LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION) IN DETERMINING POLLINATOR DISTRIBUTIONS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. RESULTSVARIABLES RELATED TO LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION WERE HIGHLY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING POLLINATOR DISTRIBUTIONS IN ALL PERIODS. PRECIPITATION WAS GENERALLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN TEMPERATURE, AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION LESS THAN LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION. LAND-USE VARIABLES REMAINED EQUALLY IMPORTANT ACROSS TIME FOR ALL POLLINATOR GROUPS, EXCEPT FOR BEES WHERE THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME. AMONG CLIMATE VARIABLES, THE IMPORTANCE OF PRECIPITATION DID NOT CHANGE ACROSS TIME FOR ANY POLLINATOR GROUP. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPERATURE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT TIMES FOR BEES AND HOVERFLIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONSDETERMINANTS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS CAN CHANGE IN THEIR IMPORTANCE OVER TIME WHEN CHANGES IN THE MAGNITUDE AND RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OCCUR.

WE ALSO SITUATED POLLINATOR-MEDIATED EFFECTS IN A SPATIAL CONTEXT BY LINKING VARIATION IN MULTIPLE PATERNITY TO VARIATION IN PLANT SPATIAL ISOLATION. WE DOCUMENTED PRONOUNCED DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBER OF PATERNAL SIRES AS FUNCTION OF POLLINATOR IDENTITY: ON AVERAGE, THE PRIMARY POLLINATOR (HAWKMOTHS) FACILITATED MATING WITH NEARLY TWICE AS MANY POLLEN DONORS RELATIVE TO THE SECONDARY POLLINATOR (SOLITARY BEES). THIS EFFECT WAS CONSISTENT FOR BOTH ISOLATED AND NONISOLATED INDIVIDUALS, BUT SPATIAL ISOLATION IMPOSED PRONOUNCED REDUCTIONS ON MULTIPLE PATERNITY REGARDLESS OF POLLINATOR IDENTITY. CONSIDERING THAT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND POLLEN DISPERSAL DISTANCE DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH POLLINATOR IDENTITY, WE ATTRIBUTE VARIATION IN REALIZED MATING DYNAMICS PRIMARILY TO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR AS OPPOSED TO POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE OR MATING INCOMPATIBILITY ARISING FROM UNDERLYING SPATIAL GENETIC STRUCTURE. OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT FUNCTIONALLY DISTINCT POLLINATORS CAN HAVE STRONGLY DIVERGENT EFFECTS ON POLYANDRY IN PLANTS AND FURTHER SUGGEST THAT BOTH POLLINATOR IDENTITY AND SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY HAVE IMPORTANT ROLES IN PLANT MATING DYNAMICS.",HAWKMOTH; HYLES; MULTIPLE PATERNITY; OENOTHERA; POLLINATION; SOLITARY BEE,OENOTHERA-HARRINGTONII ONAGRACEAE; MIMULUS-RINGENS PHRYMACEAE; RAPHANUS-SATIVUS; POLLEN DISPERSAL; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; FLOWERING PLANTS; WILD RADISH; SEED SET; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; NATURAL-POPULATIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"RHODES, MK, SKOGEN, KA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHICAGO BOT GARDEN, DIV PLANT SCI \& CONSERVAT, 1000 LAKE COOK RD, GLENCOE, IL 60022 USA.;RHODES, MK (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORTHWESTERN UNIV, PROGRAM PLANT BIOL \& CONSERVAT, 2205 TECH DR,OT HOGAN HALL,ROOM 2-144, EVANSTON, IL 60208 USA.;RHODES, MK (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, POB 210088, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.;RHODES, MATTHEW K., FANT, JEREMIE B., SKOGEN, KRISSA A., CHICAGO BOT GARDEN, DIV PLANT SCI \& CONSERVAT, 1000 LAKE COOK RD, GLENCOE, IL 60022 USA.;RHODES, MATTHEW K., NORTHWESTERN UNIV, PROGRAM PLANT BIOL \& CONSERVAT, 2205 TECH DR,OT HOGAN HALL,ROOM 2-144, EVANSTON, IL 60208 USA.;RHODES, MATTHEW K., UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, POB 210088, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",10.1111/MEC.14115,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,COLORADO NATIVE PLANT SOCIETY; NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY; SIGMA XI; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB 1342873]; CHICAGO BOTANIC GARDEN DIVISION OF PLANT SCIENCE AND CONSERVATION,"WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE SKOGEN-FANT LABORATORY GROUP, R.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR TO WHICH CONCEPT OF SPECIALIZATION THIS ASSUMPTION IS RELATED, IF TO THAT OF PHENOTYPIC SPECIALIZATION OR OF FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS WORK WAS TO VERIFY IF POLLINATORS OF FIVE WIDESPREAD FOOD-DECEPTIVE ORCHID SPECIES (ANACAMPTIS MORIO (L.) R.M. BATEMAN, PRIDGEON \& M.W. CHASE, ANACAMPTIS PYRAMIDALIS (L.)

WE ADDRESSED THE QUESTION BY DEFINING TARGET ORCHIDS PHENOTYPIC SPECIALIZATION ON THE BASIS OF THEIR FLORAL TRAITS, AND WE COMPARED THE EXPECTED GUILDS OF POLLINATORS WITH THE OBSERVED ONES. TARGET ORCHID POLLINATORS WERE COLLECTED BY CONDUCTING A META-ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE AND ADDING UNPUBLISHED FIELD OBSERVATIONS, CARRIED OUT IN TEMPERATE DRY GRASSLANDS IN NE ITALY. POLLINATOR SPECIES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY GROUPED INTO GUILDS AND DIFFERENCES IN THE GUILD SPECTRA AMONG ORCHID SPECIES GROUPED ACCORDING TO THEIR PHENOTYPE WERE TESTED. IN CONTRADICTION TO EXPECTATIONS DERIVED FROM THE PHENOTYPIC POINT OF VIEW, FOOD-DECEPTIVE ORCHID SPECIES WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHLY FUNCTIONALLY GENERALIZED FOR POLLINATORS, AND NO DIFFERENCES IN THE POLLINATOR GUILD SPECTRA COULD BE REVEALED AMONG ORCHID GROUPS.

INSECT CONSERV.,"HABITAT LOSS IS A MAJOR DRIVER OF BEE DECLINES WORLDWIDE, AND IS OF KEY RELEVANCE IN THE TROPICS GIVEN HIGH DEFORESTATION RATES, BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF LAND-COVER CHANGE ON TROPICAL BEE COMMUNITIES. ORCHID BEES (APIDAE: EUGLOSSINI) ARE CRITICAL LONG-DISTANCE POLLINATORS AND MAY BE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION GIVEN THEIR RELIANCE ON FOREST HABITAT. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF FOREST FRAGMENTATION ON EUGLOSSINES HAVE BEEN GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED, HAVE LARGELY IGNORED BETA-DIVERSITY, AND HAVE NOT COMPARED FRAGMENTS WITH CONTINUOUS FOREST. TO CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING THESE GAPS, WE SAMPLED MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES IN 18 FOREST FRAGMENTS (AREA RANGE: 2.5-33 HA) AND AT EIGHT LOCATIONS WITHIN A LARGE (3500 HA) CONTINUOUS FOREST IN THE CHOC BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT OF ECUADOR DURING THE DRY SEASON IN 2014. WE ASSESSED HOW EUGLOSSINE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, AND EVENNESS RELATED TO FRAGMENT AREA, ISOLATION, AND EDGE:AREA RATIO. WE ALSO COMPARED FRAGMENTS TO CONTINUOUS FOREST, IN TERMS OF ALPHA- AND BETA-DIVERSITY. IN FRAGMENTS, A SINGLE SPECIES (EUGLOSSA TRIDENTATA) COMPRISED 78\% OF CAPTURES, AND WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF FRAGMENT AREA, ISOLATION, OR EDGE ON ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, OR EVENNESS AMONG FRAGMENTS. FOREST FRAGMENTS AND CONTINUOUS FOREST DIFFERED IN BOTH COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND EVENNESS, BUT NOT IN ABUNDANCE OR SPECIES RICHNESS. SPATIAL TURNOVER (BETA-DIVERSITY) SHOWED A NON-SIGNIFICANT TREND TOWARD CHANGING MORE RAPIDLY IN CONTINUOUS FOREST RELATIVE TO FRAGMENTS.

ALTHOUGH MANY PHYTOCHEMICALS ACT AS TOXINS AND DETERRENTS TO CONSUMERS, THE SAME CHEMICALS MAY COUNTERACT DISEASE AND BE PREFERRED BY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. THE ROLES OF NECTAR AND POLLEN PHYTOCHEMICALS IN POLLINATOR ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION ARE COMPLEX, WITH EVIDENCE FOR BOTH TOXICITY AND MEDICINAL EFFECTS AGAINST PARASITES. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW CONSISTENT THE EFFECTS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS ARE ACROSS DIFFERENT PARASITE LINEAGES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND WHETHER POLLINATORS ACTIVELY SELF-MEDICATE WITH THESE COMPOUNDS WHEN INFECTED. APPROACH HERE, WE TEST EFFECTS OF THE NECTAR ALKALOID ANABASINE, FOUND IN NICOTIANA, ON INFECTION INTENSITY, DIETARY PREFERENCE, AND SURVIVAL AND PERFORMANCE OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS). WE EXAMINED VARIATION IN THE EFFECTS OF ANABASINE ON INFECTION WITH DIFFERENT LINEAGES OF THE INTESTINAL PARASITE CRITHIDIA UNDER POLLEN-FED AND POLLEN-STARVED CONDITIONS. RESULTS WE FOUND THAT ANABASINE DID NOT REDUCE INFECTION INTENSITY IN INDIVIDUAL BEES INFECTED WITH ANY OF FOUR CRITHIDIA LINEAGES THAT WERE TESTED IN PARALLEL, NOR DID ANABASINE REDUCE INFECTION INTENSITY IN MICROCOLONIES OF QUEENLESS WORKERS. IN ADDITION, NEITHER ANABASINE NOR ITS ISOMER, NICOTINE, WAS PREFERRED BY INFECTED BEES IN CHOICE EXPERIMENTS, AND INFECTED BEES CONSUMED LESS ANABASINE THAN DID UNINFECTED BEES UNDER NO-CHOICE CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANABASINE EXACERBATED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INFECTION ON BEE SURVIVAL AND MICROCOLONY PERFORMANCE. ANABASINE REDUCED INFECTION IN ONLY ONE EXPERIMENT, IN WHICH BEES WERE DEPRIVED OF POLLEN AND POST-PUPAL CONTACT WITH NESTMATES. IN THIS EXPERIMENT, ANABASINE HAD ANTIPARASITIC EFFECTS IN BEES FROM ONLY TWO OF FOUR COLONIES, AND INFECTED BEES EXHIBITED REDUCED-RATHER THAN INCREASED-PHYTOCHEMICAL CONSUMPTION RELATIVE TO UNINFECTED BEES. CONCLUSIONS VARIATION IN THE EFFECT OF ANABASINE ON INFECTION SUGGESTS POTENTIAL MODULATION OF TRITROPHIC INTERACTIONS BY BOTH HOST GENOTYPE AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BOMBUS IMPATIENS PREFER DIETS WITHOUT NICOTINE AND ANABASINE, AND SUGGEST THAT THE MEDICINAL EFFECTS AND TOXICITY OF ANABASINE MAY BE CONTEXT DEPENDENT.

POPULATIONS OF THIS SPECIES ARE HIGHLY THREATENED IN LARGE PARTS OF ITS RANGE DUE TO OVEREXPLOITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION. IN THE LIGHT OF CLIMATIC CHANGES, SAFEGUARDING THE GENETIC DIVERSITY OF THE SPECIES IS CRUCIAL TO FOSTER ADAPTATION AND TO SUPPORT ITS LONG-TERM SURVIVAL. GENETIC INSIGHT IS ALSO RELEVANT TO GUIDE SUSTAINABLE HARVESTING. THIS PAPER HAS THE OBJECTIVE TO REVIEW INFORMATION ON THE SPECIES' GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY, GENETIC CHARACTERISTICS AND EXISTING CONSERVATION PRACTICES, AND TO IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS TO ORIENTATE FUTURE CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH FOCUS. THE LITERATURE REVIEW REVEALED THAT THE SPECIES IS MAINLY OUTCROSSED AND IS POLLINATED BY A DIVERSITY OF VECTORS, INCLUDING BATS THAT ALLOW LONG-POLLEN DISPERSAL. WHEN BATS ARE ABSENT, POLLINATION IS MAINLY CARRIED OUT BY HONEY BEES AND STINGLESS BEES AND IN SUCH CASE POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW IS RELATIVELY RESTRICTED.

SIGNALING THEORY MAKES THE GENERAL PREDICTION THAT CONSPICUOUS SIGNALS WILL BE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY INCREASE DETECTABILITY. HOWEVER, DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT CONSPICUOUS FLOWER AND FRUIT COLORS AFFECT THE FITNESS OF PLANTS IN NATURAL POPULATIONS IS SCARCE. HERE, WE TEST THE PREDICTION THAT CONSPICUOUS SIGNALS AFFECT POLLINATION AND DISPERSAL SUCCESS IN TWO PLANT SPECIES. WE SHOW THAT THE PREDICTION ONLY HOLDS TRUE FOR FLOWERS OF ONE SPECIES, AND PROPOSE THAT THE WIDELY ACCEPTED SELECTION FOR CONSPICUOUSNESS MAY BE OVERSIMPLIFYING. MOREOVER, THE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS OF PIGMENTS IN THE PROTECTION AGAINST ABIOTIC STRESSORS COULD INTERFERE WITH THEIR SIGNALING ROLE TO POLLINATING AND SEED-DISPERSING ANIMALS. INDEED, WE FIND FLOWER AND LEAF COLORS AS WELL AS FRUIT AND LEAF COLORS TO BE COUPLED, LIKELY DUE TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF PIGMENTS OF FLOWERS AND EPICUTICULAR WAXES OF FRUITS IN ABIOTIC STRESS RESPONSES. LASTLY, BECAUSE PLANT REPRODUCTION IS A MULTI-STAGE PROCESS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENT STEPS MAY BE UNCOUPLED, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER DIFFERENTIAL FITNESS THROUGH SELECTION OF POLLINATORS ON FLOWER CONSPICUOUSNESS IN THE POLLINATION STEP IS TRANSMITTED TO THE DISPERSAL STEP TO AFFECT DISPERSAL SUCCESS.

ENVIRON.,"COMPLEX NETWORKS OF SPECIES INTERACTIONS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE STABILITY OF ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES. THE RESPONSES OF THESE NETWORKS TO EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL FLUCTUATIONS ARE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION OF THESE NETWORKS AND THEIR ROLES IN STABILIZING ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES. FROM 2008 TO 2009 WE OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF EXTREME DIFFERENCES IN ANNUAL PRECIPITATION ON A NETWORK OF PLANTS AND FLOWER VISITING INSECTS IN A XERIC GRASSLAND. SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PLANT AND INSECT DIVERSITY IN THE DRY YEAR WERE MIRRORED BY DECREASES IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORK NODES AND LINKS. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE DENSITY OF NETWORK CONNECTIONS INCREASED IN THE DRY YEAR AND OTHER IMPORTANT TOPOLOGICAL FEATURES, SUCH AS NESTEDNESS AND MODULARITY, WERE LARGELY UNCHANGED. THE RESILIENCE OF THE NETWORK TO NODE (PLANTS OR INSECT SPECIES) LOSS WAS HIGH IN BOTH YEARS. THOUGH BEES TEND TO DOMINATE POLLINATION COMMUNITIES IN DRIER CLIMES, WE DID NOT OBSERVE A SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE RICHNESS OF BEE SPECIES IN THE DRY YEAR. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT WELL-LINKED, DROUGHT-RESISTANT PLANTS ARE IMPORTANT TO COMMUNITY RESILIENCE DURING ECOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING PERIODS AND THAT NETWORKS OF PLANTS AND FLOWERING-VISITING INSECTS MAY BE ROBUST TO EXTREME CLIMATIC CHANGE, AT LEAST OVER SHORT PERIODS, AS LONG AS THOSE CRITICAL, RESILIENT HUBS ARE PROTECTED.

ECOL.,"UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS, AND THE FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY A DIVERSE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY, IS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF YIELDS IN THE 75\% OF OUR CROPS THAT BENEFIT FROM INSECT POLLINATION. WE DESCRIBE A FIELD STUDY AND POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON TWO SOFT-FRUIT CROPS IN A SYSTEM WITH BOTH WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS. WE TEST WHETHER FRUIT QUALITY AND QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY POLLINATION, AND WHETHER DIFFERENT POLLINATING INSECTS RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO VARYING WEATHER CONDITIONS. BOTH STRAWBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES PRODUCED FEWER MARKETABLE FRUITS WHEN INSECTS WERE EXCLUDED, DEMONSTRATING DEPENDENCE ON INSECT POLLINATORS. RASPBERRIES HAD A SHORT FLOWERING SEASON WHICH COINCIDED WITH PEAK ABUNDANCE OF BEES, AND ATTRACTED MANY BEES PER FLOWER. IN CONTRAST, STRAWBERRIES HAD A MUCH LONGER FLOWERING SEASON AND APPEARED TO BE MUCH LESS ATTRACTIVE TO POLLINATORS, SO THAT ENSURING ADEQUATE POLLINATION IS LIKELY TO BE MORE CHALLENGING. THE PROPORTION OF HIGH-QUALITY STRAWBERRIES WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, SUGGESTING THAT YIELD WAS LIMITED BY INADEQUATE POLLINATION ON SOME FARMS. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF DIFFERENT POLLINATOR TAXA VISITING STRAWBERRIES CHANGED MARKEDLY THROUGH THE SEASON, DEMONSTRATING SEASONAL COMPLEMENTARITY. INSECT VISITORS RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS SUGGESTING THAT DIVERSITY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF POLLINATION SERVICE SHORTFALLS. FOR EXAMPLE, FLIES VISITED THE CROP FLOWERS IN POOR WEATHER AND AT THE END OF THE FLOWERING SEASON WHEN OTHER POLLINATORS WERE SCARCE, AND SO MAY PROVIDE A UNIQUE FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTION. UNDERSTANDING HOW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLLINATOR GROUPS CAN ENHANCE POLLINATION SERVICES TO CROPS STRENGTHENS THE CASE FOR MULTIPLE SPECIES MANAGEMENT. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE LINK BETWEEN INCREASED DIVERSITY AND FUNCTION IN REAL CROP SYSTEMS, HIGHLIGHTING THE RISKS OF REPLACING ALL POLLINATORS WITH MANAGED ALTERNATIVES.

DIVERS.,"1. LAND-USE CHANGE HAS PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. HOWEVER, THE PROCESSES THROUGH WHICH IT ACTS ON POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY IN HIGHLY VULNERABLE ISLAND ECOSYSTEMS. 2. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE DISTRIBUTION, ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION OF FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS TO ASSESS THEIR RESPONSE TO LAND-USE CHANGE IN TERCEIRA ISLAND (AZORES). 3. FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS WERE SAMPLED OVER 2 YEARS USING A STANDARDISED PROTOCOL ALONG 50 TRANSECTS ACROSS FIVE DIFFERENT HABITATS CORRESPONDING TO A LAND-USE GRADIENT. INSECT SPECIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS INDIGENOUS OR EXOTICS. WE ASSESSED CHANGES ACROSS HABITATS USING MULTIPLE DIVERSITY INDICES, SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SAD) AND SPECIES COMPOSITION METRICS (-DIVERSITY), ALONG WITH PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION. 4. WE OBSERVED THAT INDIGENOUS FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS WERE DOMINANT, BOTH IN ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, ACROSS THE ENTIRE LAND-USE GRADIENT. SPECIES DIVERSITY VARIED ONLY SLIGHTLY ACROSS THE GRADIENT. SADS WERE LOGNORMAL IN ALL HABITATS, WITH VERY FEW TRULY COMMON AND RARE FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS AND A PREVALENCE OF SPECIES OF INTERMEDIATE ABUNDANCE. SPECIES REPLACEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MAINLY BETWEEN THE TWO MOST CONTRASTING HABITATS (I.E. NATURAL FORESTS AND INTENSIVE PASTURES) BUT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH SPECIES REPLACEMENT OF HOST PLANT SPECIES ACROSS THE GRADIENT. 5. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE AZOREAN FLOWER-VISITING INSECT COMMUNITIES WERE HIGHLY SIMPLIFIED ACROSS THE ENTIRE GRADIENT WITH LITTLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HABITATS. IN THE ABSENCE OF STRONG EXOTIC COMPETITORS, INDIGENOUS FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS EXPAND THEIR RANGE AND OCCUPY NEW ANTHROPOGENIC HABITATS, ALSO FACILITATING THE EXPANSION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES.",BETA DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY; EXOTIC SPECIES; FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS; LAND-USE CHANGE; NATIVE SPECIES; OCEANIC ISLANDS; POLLINATOR NETWORKS; SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTION,SPECIES ABUNDANCE DISTRIBUTIONS; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; NATIVE BEES; DIVERSITY; RICHNESS; EXTINCTION; BIODIVERSITY; LANDSCAPES; RESPONSES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"PICANCO, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), AZOREAN BIODIVERS GRP, CE3C, PT-9700042 ANGRA DO HEROISMO, ACORES, PORTUGAL.;PICANCO, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ACORES, DEPT CIENCIAS \& ENGN AMBIENTE, PT-9700042 ANGRA DO HEROISMO, ACORES, PORTUGAL.;PICANCO, ANA, RIGAL, FRANCOIS, MATTHEWS, THOMAS J., CARDOSO, PEDRO, BORGES, PAULO A.

AN EXPERIMENTAL TEST IN A BUZZ-POLLINATED SPECIES WITH ANTHER DIMORPHISM,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ECOL. EVOL.,"SOME POLLINATION SYSTEMS, SUCH AS BUZZ-POLLINATION, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FLORAL MORPHOLOGIES THAT REQUIRE A CLOSE PHYSICAL INTERACTION BETWEEN FLORAL SEXUAL ORGANS AND INSECT VISITORS. IN THESE SYSTEMS, A POLLINATOR'S SIZE RELATIVE TO THE FLOWER MAY BE AN IMPORTANT FEATURE DETERMINING WHETHER THE VISITOR TOUCHES BOTH MALE AND FEMALE SEXUAL ORGANS AND THUS TRANSFERS POLLEN BETWEEN PLANTS EFFICIENTLY. TO DATE, FEW STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED WHETHER IN FACT THE FIT BETWEEN FLOWER AND POLLINATOR INFLUENCES POLLEN TRANSFER, PARTICULARLY AMONG BUZZ-POLLINATED SPECIES. HERE WE USE SOLANUM ROSTRATUM, A BUZZ-POLLINATED PLANT WITH DIMORPHIC ANTHERS AND MIRROR-IMAGE FLOWERS, TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE MORPHOLOGICAL FIT BETWEEN THE POLLINATOR'S BODY AND FLORAL MORPHOLOGY INFLUENCES POLLEN DEPOSITION. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT WHEN THE SIZE OF THE POLLINATOR MATCHES THE SEPARATION BETWEEN THE SEXUAL ORGANS IN A FLOWER, MORE POLLEN SHOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE STIGMA THAN WHEN THE VISITOR IS EITHER TOO SMALL OR TOO BIG RELATIVE TO THE FLOWER. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE EXPOSED FLOWERS OF S.ROSTRATUM WITH VARYING LEVELS OF SEPARATION BETWEEN SEXUAL ORGANS, TO BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) OF DIFFERENT SIZES. WE RECORDED THE NUMBER OF VISITS RECEIVED, POLLEN DEPOSITION, AND FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTION. WE FOUND HIGHER POLLEN DEPOSITION WHEN BEES WERE THE SAME SIZE OR BIGGER THAN THE SEPARATION BETWEEN ANTHER AND STIGMA WITHIN A FLOWER. WE FOUND A SIMILAR, BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PATTERN FOR FRUIT SET. IN CONTRAST, SEED SET WAS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR WHEN THE SIZE OF THE FLOWER EXCEEDED THE SIZE OF THE BEE, SUGGESTING THAT OTHER POSTPOLLINATION PROCESSES MAY BE IMPORTANT IN TRANSLATING POLLEN RECEIPT TO SEED SET. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FIT BETWEEN FLOWER AND POLLINATOR SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES POLLEN DEPOSITION IN THIS BUZZ-POLLINATED SPECIES. WE SPECULATE THAT IN BUZZ-POLLINATED SPECIES WHERE FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATORS INTERACT CLOSELY, VARIATION IN THE VISITOR'S SIZE MAY DETERMINE WHETHER IT ACTS MAINLY AS A POLLINATOR OR AS A POLLEN THIEF (I.E., REMOVING POLLEN REWARDS BUT CONTRIBUTING LITTLE TO POLLEN DEPOSITION AND FERTILIZATION).",BOMBUS TERRESTRIS; HERKOGAMY; POLLEN DEPOSITION; POLLINATOR SIZE; SOLANUM ROSTRATUM,SOLANUM-ROSTRATUM; POPULATIONS; FRUIT; PLANT; HERB; SIZE; INTERFERENCE; HETERANTHERY; ECOLOGY; BIOLOGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"SOLIS-MONTERO, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STIRLING, BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, SCH NAT SCI, STIRLING, SCOTLAND.;SOLIS-MONTERO, LISLIE, VALLEJO-MARIN, MARIO, UNIV STIRLING, BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, SCH NAT SCI, STIRLING, SCOTLAND.;SOLIS-MONTERO, LISLIE, COLEGIO FRONTERA ECOSUR, CONACYT, UNIDAD TAPACHULA, TAPACHULA, CHIAPAS, MEXICO.",10.1002/ECE3.2897,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING; ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDONROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON [RG2010R1],"UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING; ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: RG2010R1",2045-7758,8,2706-2715,WILEY,7,2017,ISI000399737500023,47,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",28,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",LSOLISMAIL.ECOSUR.MX,ES7NS,"SOLIS-MONTERO, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STIRLING, BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, SCH NAT SCI, STIRLING, SCOTLAND",ISI,none,UNIV STIRLING,UNIV STIRLING,NA,"SOLIS-MONTERO L, 2017, ECOL EVOL","SOLIS-MONTERO L, 2017, ECOL EVOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,Janean S

FOR MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF BEES, THE FIRST STEP IS TO KNOW THE BEHAVIOR AND THE FOOD RESOURCES USED. CURRENTLY, URBAN AREAS ARE CONSIDERED REFUGE ZONES FOR BEES, AND UNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES AND THE INFLUENCE ON REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR MANAGEMENT OF BEES. WE USED THE PROTOCOLS APPLIED IN PHENOLOGICAL STUDIES WITH BEES AND PLANT SPECIES TO EVALUATE BOTH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR IN AN URBANIZED AREA. AT THE SAME TIME, WE USED PALYNOLOGY PROTOCOLS TO ANALYZE THE POLLEN MATERIAL COLLECTED FROM BROOD CELLS (FOOD AND FECES) OF IMMATURE CENTRIS ANALIS. THESE PROTOCOLS ALLOWED TO EVALUATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE STUDIED AREA AND THE PLANT SPECIES EFFECTIVELY USED BY C. ANALIS FEMALES TO FEED IMMATURE LARVAE DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD. THE MAXIMUM REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD OF C. ANALIS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHEST FLORAL RESOURCES AVAILABILITY. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A STRONG SELECTIVITY OF POLLEN IN FLOWERS OF MALPIGHIA EMARGINATA (MALPIGHIACEAE), WHICH REPRESENTED MORE THAN 59\% OF ALL THE POLLEN GRAINS PROVISIONED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THIS MEANS THAT IN THE CASE OF MORE SPECIALIZED BEES LIKE C. ANALIS, THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PREFERRED PLANTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE OVERALL FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN THE AREA.

ENVIRON.,"POLLINATION IS FREQUENTLY IDENTIFIED AS AN IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICE TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. IN CONTRAST, ECOSYSTEM DISSERVICES ARE RARELY CONSIDERED. THIS STUDY EXPLORES POLLINATOR SERVICE VERSUS DISSERVICE IN LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY (VACCINIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM) PRODUCTION. THIS CROP IS HIGHLY MANAGED, REQUIRES INSECT POLLINATION, AND HAS A RELATIVELY LONG BLOOM, WHEN COMBINED, THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY CAUSE A PORTION OF EARLY SEASON POLLINATION TO RESULT IN PREMATURE RIPENING AND LOSS. TO TEST THIS, WE EXPOSED EARLY AND LATE FLOWERING CLONES TO EARLY SEASON (WILD) POLLINATION ONLY OR LATE SEASON (WILD AND MANAGED) POLLINATION ONLY. CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS OF DISSERVICE, PRE-HARVEST LOSS, SHATTER, AND SUGAR CONTENT WERE CONSISTENT ACROSS TREATMENTS, EVEN THOUGH EARLY SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS EXHIBITED HEAVIER BERRIES. REMARKABLY, EARLY SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS PRODUCED OVER 70\% OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF LATE SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EARLY SEASON POLLINATION BY WILD POLLINATORS DOES NOT PRESENT AN ECOSYSTEM DISSERVICE TO LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY PRODUCTION. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.

EVEN THOUGH, THERE ARE DIFFERENT OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES USED FOR PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF SOLAR PV, STILL THE BEST OPTIMIZED RESULTS ARE NOT ACHIEVED TO DATE. IN THIS PAPER, WIND DRIVEN OPTIMIZATION (WDO) TECHNIQUE IS PROPOSED AS THE NEW METHOD FOR IDENTIFYING THE PARAMETERS OF SOLAR PV. THE ACCURACY AND CONVERGENCE TIME OF THE PROPOSED METHOD IS COMPARED WITH RESULTS OF PATTERN SEARCH (PS), GENETIC ALGORITHM (GA), AND SIMULATED ANNEALING (SA) FOR SINGLE DIODE AND DOUBLE DIODE MODELS OF SOLAR PV. FURTHERMORE, FOR PERFORMANCE VALIDATION, THE PARAMETERS OBTAINED THROUGH WDO ARE COMPARED WITH HYBRID BEE POLLINATOR FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM (BPFPA), FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM (FPA), GENERALIZED OPPOSITIONAL TEACHING LEARNING BASED OPTIMIZATION (GOTLBO), ARTIFICIAL BEE SWARM OPTIMIZATION (ABSO), AND HARMONY SEARCH (HS). THE OBTAINED RESULTS CLEARLY REVEAL THAT WDO ALGORITHM CAN PROVIDE ACCURATE OPTIMIZED VALUES WITH LESS NUMBER OF ITERATIONS AT DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.

THESE REPORTS OF B. TERRESTRIS INDICATE A NORTHWARD EXPANSION OF THIS BEE. IN OUR ANALYSES, THESE NEW AREAS OF OCCURRENCES HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE OBSERVED IN THE SPECIES' SOUTHERN INVADED RANGE, AND OUR SDMS PREDICT THAT B.

THIS IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF POLLINATOR DECLINES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED THE EFFECTS OF DIETARY RESTRICTIONS ON POLLINATOR FITNESS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF RESTRICTING POLLEN AND NECTAR SUPPLY ON BUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) COLONY GROWTH, ADULT SIZE AND NUMBER. COLONIES REQUIRED UP TO 6 G POLLEN/1 G PROTEIN AND 50 G SUGAR TO ESTABLISH A COLONY OF 5 WORKERS, AND CONSUMED IN EXCESS OF 176 G POLLEN/31 G PROTEIN AND 1,186 G SUGAR IN THEIR LIFETIME. REGARDLESS OF RESTRICTIONS ON POLLEN OR NECTAR AVAILABILITY, COLONIES CONSUMED A RATIO OF 1 G PROTEIN TO SIMILAR TO 43 G SUGAR, THOUGH FREE-FLYING COLONIES REQUIRE PROPORTIONALLY MORE SUGAR TO FUEL FORAGING. FOOD-LIMITED COLONIES FROM AN EARLY STAGE GREW LITTLE WITH ANYTHING LESS THAN AD-LIB NECTAR, WHILE MORE-ESTABLISHED COLONIES INCREASED IN WEIGHT EVEN WITH LOW LEVELS OF NECTAR SUGGESTING A SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES IN EARLY SPRING MAY BE MOST DAMAGING TO BUMBLE BEE COLONIES. DIETARY RESTRICTION REDUCED THE NUMBER OF REPRODUCTIVES PRODUCED, BUT HAD VARIABLE EFFECTS ON THE SIZE OF WORKERS AND MALES.

GENET.,"SWARTZIA GLAZIOVIANA IS A THREATENED LEGUME TREE SPECIES FROM THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST CHARACTERIZED BY AGGREGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ENDEMISM TO AN AREA WITH EXTENSIVE HUMAN OCCUPATION. IT IS CRITICAL TO CONDUCT STUDIES ON THE SPECIES TO CONSERVE THE REMAINING POPULATIONS. USING TEN NUCLEAR MICROSATELLITE LOCI, WE EXAMINED THE GENOTYPIC AND GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE, INBREEDING, STAND-LEVEL SPATIAL GENETIC STRUCTURE (SGS), EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE, MATING SYSTEM, AND POLLEN FLOW IN THREE ISOLATED REMNANT POPULATIONS, AIMING TO INFORM CONSERVATION STRATEGIES. ALL ADULT INDIVIDUALS FOUND IN THE POPULATIONS WERE MAPPED AND SAMPLED AND OPEN-POLLINATED SEEDS WERE COLLECTED FROM TWO POPULATIONS. THE GENOTYPIC DIVERSITY (> 0.85) INDICATES THAT SEXUAL REPRODUCTION IS PREDOMINANT AND THE SHORT DISTANCE BETWEEN RAMETS INDICATES THAT ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION OCCURS BY ROOT DEVELOPMENT. IN GENERAL, POPULATIONS PRESENT SGS WHICH IS EXPLAINED, IN PART, BY ROOT DEVELOPMENT. THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG POPULATIONS WAS GREATER BETWEEN MORE DISTANT POPULATIONS, SUGGESTING A GENE DISPERSAL PATTERN OF ISOLATION BY DISTANCE. POLLEN FLOW (> 27\%) INDICATES THAT POPULATIONS ARE NOT REPRODUCTIVELY ISOLATED, BUT FERTILIZATION FOLLOWED AN ISOLATION BY DISTANCE PATTERN. THE OUTCROSSING RATE WAS HIGH ( > 0.8), BUT SOME MATING OCCURRED AMONG RELATED INDIVIDUALS ( > 0.1) AND WERE CORRELATED ( > 0.15), INDICATING INBREEDING AND VARYING LEVELS OF RELATEDNESS WITHIN FAMILIES. INBREEDING WAS HIGHER IN SEED COHORTS THAN ADULTS, SUGGESTING SELECTION AGAINST INBRED INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN SEED AND ADULT STAGES.

THE FLORAL CHANGES IN THESE SPECIES INCLUDE ALTERED PETAL ORIENTATION, SHAPE AND TEXTURE. IN LOTUS THESE CHARACTERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DORSIVENTRAL PETAL IDENTITY, SUGGESTING THAT SHIFTS IN THE EXPRESSION OF DORSAL IDENTITY GENES MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE EVOLUTION OF BIRD POLLINATION. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS LOTUS JAPONICUS CYCLOIDEA 2 (LJCYC2), KNOWN TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ON THE DORSAL PETAL IN L.JAPONICUS. BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES ARE UNUSUAL IN NOT HAVING PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ON THE DORSAL PETAL. USING RT-PCR AT VARIOUS STAGES OF FLOWER DEVELOPMENT, WE DETERMINED THE TIMING OF EXPRESSION IN ALL PETAL TYPES FOR THE THREE PUTATIVE PETAL IDENTITY GENES (CYC-LIKE GENES) IN DIFFERENT SPECIES WITH CONTRASTING FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATION SYNDROMES. IN BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES THE DORSAL IDENTITY GENE, LJCYC2, IS NOT EXPRESSED AT THE FLORAL STAGE WHEN PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ARE NORMALLY DIFFERENTIATING IN BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES. IN CONTRAST, IN BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES, LJCYC2 IS EXPRESSED DURING CONICAL CELL DEVELOPMENT. CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPRESSION OF THE ABOVE TWO GENES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MODIFICATIONS IN PETAL GROWTH AND LATERALISATION OF THE DORSAL AND VENTRAL PETALS IN THE BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES. THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT CHANGES IN THE TIMING, RATHER THAN SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION, OF EXPRESSION LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE MODIFICATIONS OF PETAL MICROMORPHOLOGY AND PETAL SIZE DURING THE TRANSITION FROM BEE TO BIRD POLLINATION IN MACARONESIAN LOTUS SPECIES.",CANARY ISLANDS; CYCLOIDEA; ORNITHOPHILY; PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS; PETAL IDENTITY; POLLINATION SHIFT,ANTIRRHINUM-MAJUS; FLOWER ELEMENT; TCP GENES; JAPONICUS; EVOLUTION; SHAPE; GESNERIACEAE; PHYLOGENY; MICROMORPHOLOGY; PIGMENTATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"OJEDA, DI (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LIBRE BRUXELLES, DEPT EVOLUTIONARY BIOL \& ECOL, AVE FD ROOSEVELT 50, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;OJEDA, D.

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN URBANIZATION AND THE COMPOSITION OF COMMUNITIES OF FLYING (AND FLOATING) ARTHROPODS WITHIN GARDENS AND PARKS IN A MEDIUM-SIZED MESIC CITY. WE PREDICTED THAT FLYING ARTHROPOD ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WOULD RESPOND STRONGLY TO PERCENT IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND DISTANCE TO CITY CENTER, MEASUREMENTS OF URBANIZATION. FLYING ARTHROPODS WERE SAMPLED FROM 30 GARDENS AND PARKS ALONG AN URBANIZATION GRADIENT IN TOLEDO, OHIO, DURING JULY AND AUGUST 2016, USING ELEVATED PAN TRAPS. A VARIETY OF POTENTIAL PREDICTOR VARIABLES WERE ALSO RECORDED AT EACH SITE. WE COLLECTED A TOTAL OF 2,369 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING NINE ORDERS. WE FOUND THAT FLYING ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCENT IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND CANOPY COVER. OVERALL FLYING ARTHROPOD ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PERCENT IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH DISTANCE TO CITY CENTER. HYMENOPTERA (BEES, WASPS, ANTS), LEPIDOPTERA (MOTHS, BUTTERFLIES), AND ARANEAE (SPIDERS) WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH DISTANCE TO CITY CENTER. HEMIPTERA (TRUE BUGS), DIPTERA (FLIES), AND ARANEAE WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH', PERCENT IMPERVIOUS SURFACE. BOTH DISTANCE TO CITY CENTER AND PERCENT IMPERVIOUS SURFACE ARE METRICS OF URBANIZATION, AND THIS STUDY SHOWS HOW THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE FLYING ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN URBAN GARDENS AND CITY PARKS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN TAXA THAT CONTAIN POLLINATORS AND PREDATORS IMPORTANT TO URBAN AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY.

GENET.,"A KNOWLEDGE OF THE DISTANCES REGULARLY TRAVELLED BY FORAGING BEES IS ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MOVEMENT OF POLLEN ACROSS LANDSCAPES, AND HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BOTH POLLINATORS AND PLANTS. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MOVEMENTS OF BEES ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE DIRECTLY AT ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SCALES. A COMMON STRATEGY FOR QUANTIFYING THE FORAGING RANGES OF SOCIAL BEES IS TO SAMPLE THE GENOTYPES OF FORAGERS ACROSS A LANDSCAPE. INDIVIDUAL FORAGERS CAN BE ASSIGNED TO COLONIES WITH POLYMORPHIC GENETIC MARKERS, AND THE DISPERSION OF SIBLINGS IN SPACE CAN BE USED TO MAKE INFERENCE ABOUT COLONY LOCATIONS AND FORAGING MOVEMENTS. SEVERAL PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SAMPLED SIBLING GENOTYPES AT DISCRETE LOCATIONS (FOR EXAMPLE, AT REGULAR POINTS ALONG A TRANSECT), RATHER THAN IN CONTINUOUS SPACE. RESTRICTING THE COLLECTION OF BEES TO DISCRETE LOCATIONS PRESENTS A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR SAMPLING DESIGN AND DATA ANALYSIS. IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A SPATIALLY-EXPLICIT, MODEL-BASED FRAMEWORK FOR THE SIMULATION AND ESTIMATION OF FORAGING RANGES.

WE MODELED THE POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF COFFEE AND COFFEE POLLINATORS UNDER CURRENT AND FUTURE CLIMATES IN LATIN AMERICA TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER FUTURE COFFEE-SUITABLE AREAS WILL ALSO BE SUITABLE FOR POLLINATORS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COFFEESUITABLE AREAS WILL BE REDUCED 73-88\% BY 2050 ACROSS WARMING SCENARIOS, A DECLINE 46-76\% GREATER THAN ESTIMATED BY GLOBAL ASSESSMENTS.

WIDESPREAD AND INTENSIVE MONITORING COULD LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF WILD AND MANAGED BEES. HOWEVER, TRACKING THEIR DYNAMIC POPULATIONS IS COSTLY. WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN INEXPENSIVE, NONINVASIVE AND PASSIVE ACOUSTIC SURVEY TECHNIQUE FOR MONITORING BUMBLE BEE BEHAVIOR AND POLLINATION SERVICES. FIRST, WE ASSESSED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FIRST HARMONIC OF THE FLIGHT BUZZ (CHARACTERISTIC FREQUENCY) AND POLLINATOR FUNCTIONAL TRAITS THAT INFLUENCE POLLINATION SUCCESS USING FLIGHT CAGE EXPERIMENTS AND A LITERATURE SEARCH. WE ANALYZED PASSIVE ACOUSTIC SURVEY DATA FROM THREE LOCATIONS ON PENNSYLVANIA MOUNTAIN, COLORADO TO ESTIMATE BUMBLE BEE ACTIVITY. WE DEVELOPED AN ALGORITHM BASED ON COMPUTATIONAL AUDITORY SCENE ANALYSIS THAT IDENTIFIED AND QUANTIFIED THE NUMBER OF BUZZES RECORDED IN EACH LOCATION. WE THEN COMPARED VISUAL AND ACOUSTIC ESTIMATES OF BUMBLE BEE ACTIVITY. USING POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS, WE TESTED THE POWER OF BUZZ DENSITY TO PREDICT POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE FOR TWO BUMBLE BEE POLLINATED ALPINE FORBS (TRIFOLIUM DASYPHYLLUM AND T. PARRYI). WE FOUND THAT THE CHARACTERISTIC FREQUENCY WAS CORRELATED WITH TRAITS KNOWN TO AFFECT POLLINATION EFFICACY, EXPLAINING 30-52\% OF VARIATION IN BODY SIZE AND TONGUE LENGTH. BUZZ DENSITY WAS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH VISUAL ESTIMATES OF BUMBLE BEE DENSITY (R=0.97), INDICATING THAT ACOUSTIC SIGNALS ARE PREDICTIVE OF BUMBLE BEE ACTIVITY. BUZZ DENSITY PREDICTED SEED SET IN TWO ALPINE FORBS WHEN BUMBLE BEES WERE PERMITTED ACCESS TO THE FLOWERS, BUT NOT WHEN THEY WERE EXCLUDED FROM VISITING. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ACOUSTIC SIGNATURES OF FLIGHT CAN BE DECIPHERED TO MONITOR BEE ACTIVITY AND POLLINATION SERVICES TO BUMBLE BEE POLLINATED PLANTS.

NAT. HIST.,"THE STUDY OF NESTING BIOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL ASPECT FOR BOTH CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT, BUT DESPITE THIS, ONLY A FEW OF THE OVER 20,000 DESCRIBED BEE SPECIES HAVE HAD THEIR NESTING BIOLOGY STUDIED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYSE THE NESTING BIOLOGY AND DYNAMIC OF AN AGGREGATION OF THE CAVITY-NESTING BEE SPECIES CENTRIS ANALIS DURING ONE GENERATION. TWENTY-EIGHT FEMALES WERE MARKED AND HAD THEIR NESTING ACTIVITIES DOCUMENTED, 64 NESTS WERE SAMPLED, AND 113 INDIVIDUALS EMERGED FROM THESE NESTS. AN ASYMMETRY IN THE SEX ALLOCATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THIS SPECIES, AND THE SEX RATIO WAS MALE-BIASED IN THE FIRST NESTS BUILT. NONETHELESS, CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE, THE FEMALES SHOWED DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, WITH SOME OF THEM PRODUCING MORE DAUGHTERS, OTHER FEMALES PRODUCING MORE SONS, AND STILL OTHERS PRODUCING AN EQUAL PROPORTION. THE PRODUCTIVITY PER FEMALE WAS LOW COMPARED TO THAT OF OTHER SOLITARY BEE SPECIES, AND THE FEMALES DISPLAYED AN AGGRESSIVE USURPATION BEHAVIOUR AGAINST CONSPECIFIC FEMALES AND PERFORMED AN INTRASPECIFIC PARASITISM. AS THE SUBSTRATE USED TO NEST IS A LIMITING FACTOR FOR THIS SPECIES, THE USURPATION BEHAVIOUR MAY BE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY THAT COULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF NESTING. A FEW MALES USED THE NESTING SITE AS A RESTING PLACE AND THE FIDELITY OBSERVED TO THIS LOCALE WAS HIGH.

MANY ASPECTS OF HOW THESE DISPLAYS BENEFIT FORAGING EFFICIENCY ARE STILL UNEXPLORED, PARTICULARLY THOSE SURROUNDING MULTIMODAL SIGNALS AND THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE DISPLAY COMPONENTS. WE COMPARE THE NECTAR DISCOVERY TIMES OF FORAGER BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) WHEN PRESENTED WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITH UNIMODAL OR COMPOUND DISPLAYS OF VISUAL AND/OR OLFACTORY STIMULI, POSITIONED IN EITHER RADIATING OR NON-RADIATING ARRANGEMENTS. WE FOUND THAT THE ADDITION OF INDIVIDUAL DISPLAY COMPONENTS FROM EITHER MODALITY REDUCES NECTAR DISCOVERY TIME BUT THERE WAS NO TIME BENEFIT TO BIMODAL DISPLAYS OVER UNIMODAL DISPLAYS OR ANY BENEFIT TO RADIATING STIMULI ARRANGEMENTS OVER NON-RADIATING ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, PREFERENCE TESTS REVEALED A TIME ADVANTAGE TO RADIATING UNIMODAL VISUAL PATTERNS OVER NON-RADIATING UNIMODAL VISUAL PATTERNS WHEN BOTH TYPES WERE DISPLAYED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BENEFITS OF MULTIMODAL STIMULI ARRANGEMENTS TO POLLINATORS ARE UNRELATED TO BENEFITS IN NECTAR DISCOVERY TIME.

ENTOMOL.,"LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IS AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF BIOLOGICAL FLUXES AND SPECIES COMPOSITION, BUT SPECIES DO NOT RESPOND EQUALLY TO LANDSCAPE FEATURES OR SPATIAL EXTENTS. EVALUATING ``MULTI-SCALE RESPONSES OF SPECIES TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK TO BE CONSIDERED, ALLOWING INSIGHTS ABOUT HABITAT REQUIREMENTS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS. WE EVALUATED THE RESPONSE OF BRAZILIAN CERRADO'S BEES (EUSOCIAL VS. SOLITARY ONES) TO BOTH THE AMOUNT AND ISOLATION OF REMNANT VEGETATION IN EIGHT NESTED MULTIPLE-LOCAL SCALES. RESPONSE VARIABLES INCLUDED ABUNDANCE, OBSERVED, AND ESTIMATED SPECIES RICHNESS, AND BETA DIVERSITY (SPLIT INTO NESTEDNESS AND TURNOVER RESULTANT DISSIMILARITIES). EUSOCIAL SPECIES' ABUNDANCE RESPONDED TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AT NARROW SCALES OF FRAGMENT ISOLATION (250 M OF RADIUS FROM SAMPLING SITES), WHILE SOLITARY SPECIES' ABUNDANCE RESPONDED TO BROADER SCALES TO FRAGMENT AREA (2000 M). EUSOCIAL SPECIES NESTEDNESS ALSO RESPONDED TO LANDSCAPE FEATURES IN BROADER SCALES (1500 M), ESPECIALLY TO INCREASING FRAGMENT ISOLATION. HOWEVER, ALL THE REMAINING RESPONSE VARIABLES DID NOT RESPOND TO ANY OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES IN ANY SPATIAL SCALE CONSIDERED. SUCH CONTRASTING RESPONSES OF THE ABUNDANCES OF EUSOCIAL VS. SOLITARY SPECIES ARE RELATED TO THE INHERENT LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF EACH GROUP. IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES IN THIS CONTEXT ARE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS ON FOOD RESOURCES, POPULATION FEATURES, AND FLIGHT ABILITIES. SPECIES-SPECIFIC DISPERSAL ABILITIES MAY BE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF THE NESTED PATTERNS FOUND FOR EUSOCIAL SPECIES AT 1500 M.

APPL. ECOL.,"1. GLOBALLY, CONVERSION OF NATURAL HABITAT TO AGRICULTURAL LAND IS A PRIMARY DRIVER OF DECLINES IN CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, INCLUDING POLLINATION. HOWEVER, EXOTIC SPECIES ARE OFTEN WELL-ADAPTED TO HUMAN-MODIFIED ENVIRONMENTS AND COULD COMPENSATE FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT ARE LOST WHEN NATIVE SPECIES DECLINE. 2. WE MEASURED POLLINATION SERVICES (POLLEN DELIVERY TO STIGMA) PROVIDED BY WILD INSECTS TO A MASS FLOWERING CROP, PAK CHOI BRASSICA RAPA AT 12 SITES ACROSS A GRADIENT OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL LAND USE (AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION) IN NEW ZEALAND. 3. WE FOUND THAT POLLINATION SERVICES INCREASED AS THE PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INCREASED, POLLINATION FROM EXOTIC SPECIES EXCEEDED THE LOSS OF POLLINATION FROM NATIVE SPECIES. HOWEVER, POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERY BECAME INCREASINGLY DOMINATED BY A FEW EXOTIC FLY SPECIES THAT WERE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, COMPARED TO NATIVE SPECIES, WHICH HAD MORE CONSTRAINED - ACTIVITY PATTERNS. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE CONTINUED SUFFICIENT CROP POLLINATION IS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE DIVERSE NATURAL HABITATS ON OR AROUND FARMS, AS SPECIES-RICH POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES ARE RELATIVELY RESILIENT TO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT WHERE HUMAN-DRIVEN DISTURBANCE HAS CAUSED LOSS OF NATIVE POLLINATOR SPECIES, EXOTIC POLLINATORS CAN MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT POLLINATION. THEREFORE, IN AREAS WHERE NATIVE SPECIES LOSS CANNOT EASILY BE REVERSED, DECISIONS ABOUT PESTICIDE USE AND HABITAT PROVISION THAT FOSTER POPULATIONS OF BENEFICIAL EXOTIC SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERY, AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.

TOTAL ENVIRON.,"GEOPROPOLIS, A DIFFERENT TYPE OF PROPOLIS, PRESENTS A MIXTURE OF RESIN AND EXUDATES, CONTAINING WAX, SILT, AND SAND PARTICLES. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF RESEARCH INTEREST FOR ITS PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES, ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE, AND LIKELY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING. THE DETERMINATION OF TOXIC METALS IN HIVE PRODUCTS HAS BEEN REPORTED AS AN EFFICIENT TOOL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING. AS THE HONEY PRODUCTION IS NOW COMMON IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE CONCENTRATION OF TOXIC METALS IN THE MELIPONA SCUTELLARIS GEOPROPOLIS OF THE METROPOLITAN REGION OF SALVADOR, BAHIA. GEOPROPOLIS AND SOIL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM SEVEN IMPORTANT BEEHIVES BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND JULY 2016. AFTER EPA 3050B ACID DIGESTION PROCEDURE, METALS WERE DETERMINED BY ICP OES. AS THE GEOPROPOLIS IS PARTIALLY MADE FROM SOIL, THE VALUES OF CR AND FE WERE EXTREMELY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE VALUES REPORTED IN PROPOLIS, WAX, AND HONEY FOUND IN OTHER WORLDWIDE STUDIES. IT GIVES DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS TO THIS PRODUCT DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF THE HIVE AND CHARACTERIZES IT AS AN EFFICIENT INTEGRATING INDICATOR OF SOIL POLLUTION. USING THE ENRICHMENT FACTOR, WE DETERMINED THAT THE SOILS AROUND THE MELIPONARY ARE NOT OR ONLY SLIGHTLY POLLUTED BY CU, CR, NI, PB AND ZN. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A SHIFT IN THE PARTICLE SIZE OF GEOPROPOLIS, BEING LOAMIER AND LESS SANDY THAN THE SURROUNDING SOIL. IN SUCH CASE, A HIGHER METAL CONTENT COULD BE EXPECTED, THOUGH NO METAL ENRICHMENT IN THE GEOPROPOLIS WAS FOUND, EVEN A DECREASE IN ZINC, POSSIBLY DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF METALS BY BEES, WAS NOTED. NEVERTHELESS, THE RESULTS ON THE PROPORTIONS OF LITHOGENIC METAL AND ANTHROPOGENIC METAL INDICATE THAT SOME METALS HAVE AN EXTERNAL ORIGIN (ABOUT 20\% FOR NI AND CU).

THE STUDY DESIGN COMPRISED FOUR GROUPS OF SIX COLONIES EACH FED WITH UNCONTAMINATED SUGAR SYRUP ('C0'), OR SYRUP SPIKED WITH 10 MU G L-1 CLOTHIANIDIN ('C10'), 50 MU G L-1 CLOTHIANIDIN ('C50') OR 200 MU G L(-1 )CLOTHIANIDIN ('C200'). C10 REPRESENTED A RESIDUE CONCENTRATION THAT MAY EXCEPTIONALLY OCCUR AND THEREFORE A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, THE HIGHER DIETARY CONCENTRATIONS EXCEED AND DO NOT REFLECT FIELDREALISTIC LEVELS. A SUBSTANTIAL LOAD OF 8 MITES OF VARROA DESTRUCTOR PER TEN GRAM BEES IN AUTUMN WAS ADJUSTED. THE COLONIES WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR 328 DAYS. THE AMOUNT OF BROOD AND THE STRENGTH OF EACH COLONY WERE REGULARLY ASSESSED. COLONY HEALTH, BEE MORTALITY, OVERWINTERING SUCCESS, HIVE WEIGHTS, AND LEVELS OF IN-HIVE RESIDUES WERE DETERMINED. VARROOSIS TURNED OUT TO BE THE SIGNIFICANT KEY FACTOR FOR THE ENDPOINT COLONY STRENGTH. CLOTHIANIDIN DID NOT HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON C0, C10 AND C50 COLONIES.

ECOL.,"THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS OF PLANT PHENOLOGY AND POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE ACROSS SEASONS SHOULD INFLUENCE THE STRUCTURE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION NETWORKS. NEVERTHELESS, SUCH DYNAMICS ARE SELDOM CONSIDERED, ESPECIALLY FOR DIVERSE TROPICAL NETWORKS. HERE, WE EVALUATED THE TEMPORAL VARIATION OF FOUR PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS IN TWO SEASONAL ECOSYSTEMS IN CENTRAL BRAZIL (CERRADO AND PANTANAL). DATA WERE GATHERED ON A MONTHLY BASIS OVER 1YEAR FOR EACH NETWORK. WE CHARACTERIZED SEASONAL AND TEMPORAL SHIFTS IN PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS, USING TEMPORALLY DISCRETE NETWORKS. WE PREDICTED THAT THE GREATER FLORAL AVAILABILITY IN THE RAINY SEASON WOULD ALLOW FOR FINER PARTITIONING OF THE FLORAL NICHE BY THE POLLINATORS, I.E. HIGHER SPECIALIZATION PATTERNS AS PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED ACROSS LARGE SPATIAL GRADIENTS. FINALLY, WE ALSO EVALUATED HOW SAMPLING RESTRICTED TO PEAK FLOWERING PERIOD MAY AFFECT THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NETWORKS. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, WE FOUND THAT DRY SEASON NETWORKS, ALTHOUGH CHARACTERIZED BY LOWER FLORAL RESOURCE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE, SHOWED HIGHER LEVELS OF NETWORK-WIDE INTERACTION PARTITIONING (COMPLEMENTARY SPECIALIZATION AND MODULARITY). FOR NESTEDNESS, THOUGH, THIS BETWEEN-SEASONS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT CONSISTENT. REDUCED RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN THE DRY SEASON MAY PROMOTE HIGHER INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION AMONG POLLINATORS LEADING TO REDUCED NICHE OVERLAP, THUS EXPLAINING THE INCREASE IN SPECIALIZATION. THERE WERE NO CONSISTENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEASONS IN SPECIES-LEVEL INDICES, INDICATING THAT HIGHER NETWORK LEVEL SPECIALIZATION IS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY ONLY SEEN WHEN CONSIDERING THE ENTIRE NETWORK. HOWEVER, BEES PRESENTED HIGHER VALUES OF SPECIALIZATION AND SPECIES STRENGTH IN RELATION TO OTHER GROUPS SUCH AS FLIES AND WASPS, SUGGESTING THAT SOME PLANT SPECIES FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BEES ARE USED ONLY BY THIS GROUP. OUR STUDY ALSO INDICATES THAT TARGETED DATA COLLECTION DURING PEAK FLOWERING GENERATES HIGHER ESTIMATES OF NETWORK SPECIALIZATION, POSSIBLY BECAUSE SPECIES ACTIVITY SPANS LONGER PERIODS THAN THE TARGETED TIME FRAME.

NEONICOTINOIDS ARE THE MOST WIDELY USED INSECTICIDES GLOBALLY(3), BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE OF NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON IMPORTANT POLLINATORS(4-9) AND OTHER NON-TARGET ORGANISMS(10) HAS LED TO LEGISLATIVE REASSESSMENT AND CREATED DEMAND FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTS. SULFOXIMINE-BASED INSECTICIDES ARE THE MOST LIKELY SUCCESSOR(11), AND ARE EITHER LICENSED FOR USE OR UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR LICENSING IN SEVERAL WORLDWIDE MARKETS(3), INCLUDING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION(12), WHERE CERTAIN NEONICOTINOIDS (IMIDACLOPRID, CLOTHIANIDIN AND THIAMETHOXAM) ARE NOW BANNED FROM AGRICULTURAL USE OUTSIDE OF PERMANENT GREENHOUSE STRUCTURES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PRE-EMPTIVELY EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS OF SULFOXIMINE-BASED PESTICIDES ON POLLINATORS(11), BECAUSE SUCH EFFECTS ARE RARELY DETECTED BY STANDARD ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS, BUT CAN HAVE MAJOR IMPACTS AT LARGER ECOLOGICAL SCALES(13-15). HERE WE SHOW THAT CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO THE SULFOXIMINE-BASED INSECTICIDE SULFOXAFLOR, AT DOSAGES CONSISTENT WITH POTENTIAL POST-SPRAY FIELD EXPOSURE, HAS SEVERE SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS ON BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) COLONIES. FIELD-BASED COLONIES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO SULFOXAFLOR DURING THE EARLY GROWTH PHASE PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER WORKERS THAN UNEXPOSED CONTROLS, AND ULTIMATELY PRODUCED FEWER REPRODUCTIVE OFFSPRING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LIFE-HISTORY TRAJECTORIES OF TREATED AND CONTROL COLONIES FIRST BECAME APPARENT WHEN INDIVIDUALS EXPOSED AS LARVAE BEGAN TO EMERGE, SUGGESTING THAT DIRECT OR INDIRECT EFFECTS ON A SMALL COHORT MAY HAVE CUMULATIVE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR COLONY FITNESS.

SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER NUMBERS OF BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BLOOMING A. TRIDENTATA DURING AUTUMN (410/TRAP) THAN NON-BLOOMING PLANTS IN THE SPRING (181.3/TRAP) OR SUMMER (85.1/TRAP). PARASITOID WASPS AND PREDATORY TRUE BUGS WERE MOST ABUNDANT DURING THE AUTUMN, BUT LADYBEETLES, LACEWINGS, SPIDERS, BEES, AND PREDATORY THRIPS WERE MOST COMMON DURING SPRING. THE ASSOCIATION OF HIGH NUMBERS OF PREDATORS, PARASITOIDS, AND POLLINATORS WITH A. TRIDENTATA DURING BLOOMING AND NON-BLOOMING PERIODS INDICATES THAT THIS PLANT IS AN IMPORTANT RESERVOIR OF BENEFICIAL ARTHROPODS IN THE SAGEBRUSH STEPPE OF CENTRAL WASHINGTON.

EFFECTIVE INTEGRATED CROP POLLINATION (ICP) INVOLVES ADAPTABLE, TARGETED AND COST-EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CROP POLLINATION AND ENCOURAGES THE USE OF BOTH WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS WHERE APPROPRIATE. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE HOW THE ADDITION OF HONEYBEE HIVES AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY OF INSECTS VISITING OILSEED RAPE, AND IF HIVE NUMBER AND LOCATION AFFECT POLLINATOR FORAGING AND OILSEED RAPE POLLINATION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTIVE ICP. WE FOUND THAT INTRODUCING HIVES INCREASED OVERALL FLOWER VISITOR NUMBERS AND ALTERED THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY, WHICH BECAME DOMINATED BY HONEYBEES. FURTHERMORE A GREATER NUMBER OF HIVES DID NOT INCREASE BEE NUMBERS SIGNIFICANTLY BUT DID RESULT IN HONEYBEES FORAGING FURTHER INTO FIELDS. THE TIMING OF SURVEYS AND PROXIMITY TO THE FIELD EDGE INFLUENCED DIFFERENT POLLINATORS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND REPRESENTS AN EXAMPLE OF SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COMPLEMENTARITY. FOR EXAMPLE DIPTERAN FLOWER VISITOR NUMBERS DECLINED AWAY FROM THE FIELD EDGE WHEREAS HONEYBEES PEAKED AT INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES INTO THE FIELD. FURTHERMORE, NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF SURVEY ROUND ON WILD BEES OVERALL WAS OBSERVED BUT HONEYBEE NUMBERS WERE RELATIVELY LOWER DURING PEAK FLOWERING AND DIPTERAN ABUNDANCE WAS GREATER IN LATER SURVEY ROUNDS. THUS COMBINING DIVERSE WILD POLLINATORS AND MANAGED SPECIES FOR CROP POLLINATION BUFFERS SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN FLOWER VISITATION.

PARVIFLORUM AND PUBESCENS AND COMPARED THE INSECTS BETWEEN TWO ALLOPATRIC POPULATIONS IN MISSOURI. IN ALL CASES, INSECTS MOST LIKELY TO CARRY THE POLLEN MASSES OF THIS ORCHID WERE SMALL-TO MEDIUM-SIZED BEES (6.75 MM LENGTH, 2.28 MM WIDTH, 1.82 MM DEPTH) NATIVE TO THE CENTRAL REGION OF THE USA. THE DOMINANT CARRIERS OF POLLEN MASSES WERE POLYLECTIC FEMALES IN THE FAMILY HALICTIDAE. WE FOUND THAT 40 BEE SPECIES VISITED THE FLOWERS OF BOTH VARIETIES, ALTHOUGH FLORAL DIMENSIONS OF C. PARVIFLORUM VAR. PUBESCENS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THOSE OF VAR. PARVIFLORUM. CYPRIPEDIUM PARVIFLORUM VAR. PARVIFLORUM BLOOMED EARLIER THAN VAR. PUBESCENS. WE OBSERVED BEES TAKING REFUGE IN FLOWERS OF C. PARVIFLORUM VAR. PUBESCENS ON COLD, OVERCAST DAYS. THE TWO ISOLATED POPULATIONS OF VAR. PUBESCENS SHARED EIGHT SPECIES OF POLLEN VECTORS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT C. PARVIFLORUM EXPLOITS A DIVERSE RANGE OF BEES BASED ON ITS LOCAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS. THERE IS OVERLAP BETWEEN BEE SPECIES SHARED BY BOTH VARIETIES AND OVERLAP BETWEEN FLOWERING PERIODS. HOWEVER, BASED ON FLORAL MORPHOMETRICS, EVIDENCE DID NOT SUGGEST INTERGRADATION BETWEEN THE TWO SYMPATRIC VARIANTS. INTRASPECIFIC ISOLATION IN C.

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE BREEDING SYSTEM, INSECT VISITATIONS AND THE ROLE OF INSECT VISITORS IN THE POLLINATION OF FIVE SPECIES OF OENOTHERA SUBSECT. OENOTHERA. FIELD EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT AUTONOMOUS SELFING OCCURS AT BUD STAGE, PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF THE FLOWER. CONTROL FLOWERS SHOWED SIMILAR SEED SET TO HAND-POLLINATED FLOWERS, WHEREAS EMASCULATED FLOWERS AND THOSE SUBJECT TO OPEN POLLINATION SET FEWER SEED. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE INVESTIGATED OENOTHERA EXHIBIT A GREAT CAPACITY FOR AUTONOMOUS SELFING AND THAT SELFING IS SELECTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE. ALTHOUGH FLOWERS WERE VISITED MOSTLY BY NOCTURNAL LEPIDOPTERANS, THESE INSECTS DID NOT PRECIPITATE POLLINATION AND ARE THUS CONSIDERED NECTAR THIEVES. CONVERSELY, ANALYSIS OF POLLEN LOADS AND BEHAVIOR DURING FORAGING BY DIURNAL INSECT VISITORS REVEALED THAT HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES ARE THE PROBABLE POLLINATORS.

DUE TO WILLOW'S EARLY-SEASON BLOOM PERIOD, A TIME WHEN NATURAL FORAGE FOR BEES CAN BE LIMITED, BIOMASS PLANTINGS OFFER A POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE EXPERIENCING RECENT DECLINES. TO ASSESS WHICH WILLOW CULTIVARS AND SEX MAY PROVIDE THE MOST BENEFIT TO POLLINATORS, WE CONDUCTED A COMMON-GARDEN EXPERIMENT (NORTHEAST U.S.) COMPARING BEE (HYMENOPTERA: ANTHOPHILA) VISITATION AMONG SEVEN PEDIGREES AND BOTH SEXES OF SHORT ROTATION COPPICE WILLOW.

ATTRACTION OF BEES TO THE FLOWERS THROUGH THE REWARD OF NECTAR IS ESSENTIAL FOR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THIS ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE CROP. IN THIS STUDY, THE SEX-DEPENDENT VARIATION IN COMPOSITION OF MALE AND FEMALE NECTAR AND THE NECTARIES WERE DEFINED USING A COMBINATION OF GC-MS BASED METABOLOMICS AND LC-MS/MS BASED PROTEOMICS.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION HAS REDUCED BIODIVERSITY AND LEADS TO FUNDAMENTAL TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN FOOD PRODUCTION AND CONSERVATION. CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO FOOD PRODUCTION ARE THUS NO LONGER SUITABLE. IN THE PRESENT WORK, WE DISCUSS THE INFLUENCE OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT VARIABLES ON COFFEE YIELD AND CROP POLLINATION SERVICES. WE USED 34 COFFEE FARMS (15 WITH LOW IMPACT AND 19 WITH HIGH IMPACT MANAGEMENT) LOCATED IN CHAPADA DIAMANTINA, BAHIA, BRAZIL. WE ANALYSED THE FLORAL VISITOR PATTERNS AND YIELD AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH LANDSCAPE AND MANAGEMENT CONTEXT OVER TWO YEARS. USING A GLM ANALYSIS, WE FOUND THAT FARMS CLOSE TO NATURAL AREAS AND WITH LOW MANAGEMENT INTENSITY HAVE HIGHER POTENTIAL TO REDUCE YIELD GAPS AND MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY.

WE USED HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING OF 164 POLLEN SAMPLES EXTRACTED FROM THE BROOD CELLS OF SIX COMMON CAVITY-NESTING SOLITARY BEE SPECIES (OSMIA BICORNIS, OSMIA CAERULESCENS, MEGACHILE VERSICOLOR, MEGACHILE LIGNISECA, MEGACHILE CENTUNCULARIS AND HYLAEUS CONFUSUS) WHICH ARE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE UK AND EUROPE. WE DOCUMENTED THEIR POLLEN USE ACROSS 19 FARMS IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, UK, REVEALING THEIR FORAGE PLANTS AND EXAMINING THE STRUCTURE OF THEIR POLLEN TRANSPORT NETWORKS. OF THE 32 PLANT SPECIES INCLUDED CURRENTLY IN SOWN WILDFLOWER MIXES, 15 WERE RECORDED AS PRESENT WITHIN CLOSE FORAGING RANGE OF THE BEES ON THE STUDY FARMS, BUT ONLY RANUNCULUS ACRIS L.

WAS THE MOST COMMONLY FOUND OF THE 23 PLANT SPECIES IDENTIFIED IN THE POLLEN SAMPLES, SUGGESTING THAT, IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A NESTING RESOURCE FOR MEGACHILE LEAFCUTTER BEES, IT MAY BE AN IMPORTANT FORAGE PLANT FOR THESE SPECIES. HIGHER LEVELS OF CONNECTANCE AND NESTEDNESS WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF POLLEN TRANSPORT NETWORKS ON FARMS WITH ABUNDANT FLORAL RESOURCES, WHICH MAY INCREASE RESILIENCE TO SPECIES LOSS. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT PLANT SPECIES PROMOTED CURRENTLY BY AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES ARE NOT OPTIMAL FOR SOLITARY BEE FORAGING.

IN THIS STUDY, WE USED A DATASET COMPRISING ALMOST 7000 HIGHLY TAXONOMICALLY RESOLVED RECORDS OF TALLGRASS PRAIRIE FORBS AND FLOWER VISITING INSECTS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ROLES OF SITE-SCALE FORB COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE COMPOSITION AND CONFIGURATION OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPES, IN STRUCTURING FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITIES. WE EXAMINED THE WHOLE FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITY AND THREE FOCAL SUBGROUPS-BEES (THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS WORLDWIDE), BUTTERFLIES (OFTEN LESS EFFICIENT POLLINATORS, BUT POTENTIALLY USEFUL AS INDICATOR TAXA) AND SYRPHID/BOMBYLIID FLIES (WHICH, AS NON-BEE TAXA, ARE OFTEN OVERLOOKED). AT THE SITE-SCALE, THE COMPOSITION OF THE ENTIRE FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH FORB COMPOSITION, BUT ONLY BEES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY, POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH FORB ALPHA-DIVERSITY. BEE, BUTTERFLY, AND FLY DIVERSITY EXHIBITED TAXON-SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND CONFIGURATION. BUTTERFLY RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE COMBINED EXTENT OF WARM-SEASON GRASSLANDS AND WOODLANDS, WHEREAS BEES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXTENT OF WARM-SEASON GRASSLANDS, ONLY. BEE AND FLY DIVERSITY WAS HIGHER IN LANDSCAPES WITH GREATER GRASSLAND EDGE DENSITY, INDICATING THAT HABITAT HETEROGENEITY MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR THESE TAXA.

HERE, WE TEST FOR POLLINATION BY MIMICRY IN DIURIS (ORCHIDACEAE), A GENUS HYPOTHESIZED TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS VIA MIMICRY OF A RANGE OF CO-OCCURRING PEA PLANTS (FABOIDEAE). OBSERVATIONS OF POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR WERE MADE FOR DIURIS BRUMALIS USING ARRAYS OF ORCHID FLOWERS. AN ANALYSIS OF FLORAL TRAITS IN THE CO-FLOWERING COMMUNITY AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO TEST IF DI. BRUMALIS AND THE PEA PLANTS SHOWED STRONG SIMILARITY AND WERE LIKELY TO BE PERCEIVED AS THE SAME BY BEES. POLLEN REMOVAL AND FRUIT-SET WERE RECORDED AT 18 SITES OVER TWO YEARS TO TEST IF FITNESS OF DI. BRUMALIS INCREASED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF THE MODEL SPECIES. DIURIS BRUMALIS SHARES THE POLLINATOR SPECIES TRICHOCOCOLLETES CAPILLOSUS AND T. LEUCOGENYS (HYMENOPTERA: COLLETIDAE) WITH CO-FLOWERING FABOIDEAE FROM THE GENUS DAVIESIA. ON DI. BRUMALIS, TRICHOCOLLETES EXHIBITED THE SAME STEREOTYPED FOOD-FORAGING AND MATE-PATROLLING BEHAVIOUR THAT THEY EXHIBIT ON DAVIESIA.

WE ANALYSED THE TEMPORAL, SPATIAL AND ECOLOGICAL PATTERNS OF THE DIVERSIFICATION OF CUCURBITA, AN AMERICAN GENUS OF WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE. WE CONDUCTED A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS BASED ON SIX CHLOROPLAST REGIONS (5907 BP) TO ESTIMATE DIVERSIFICATION RATES AND DATES OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN TAXA. THIS IS THE FIRST PHYLOGENETIC STUDY TO INCLUDE C. RADICANS, A WILD SPECIES THAT IS ENDEMIC TO THE TRANS MEXICAN VOLCANIC BELT. WE PERFORMED ANALYSIS OF ANCESTRAL AREA RECONSTRUCTION AND PALEORECONSTRUCTIONS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS TO UNDERSTAND SHIFTS IN WILD SPECIES RANGES. WE USED PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (MANOVA) TO EVALUATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENTIATION AMONG TAXA WITHIN EACH GLADE. THE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES SHOWED GOOD SUPPORT FOR AT LEAST SIX INDEPENDENT DOMESTICATION EVENTS IN CUCURBITA. THE GENUS CUCURBITA SHOWED A TIME OF DIVERGENCE OF 11.24 MA (6.88-17 MA 95\% HDP), AND THE DATES OF DIVERGENCE BETWEEN TAXA WITHIN EACH GROUP RANGED FROM 0.35 TO 6.58 MA, BEING THE DIVERGENCE BETWEEN C. LUNDELHANA AND C. OKEECHOBEENSIS SUBSP. MARTINEZII THE MOST RECENT. THE DIVERSIFICATION RATE OF THE GENUS WAS CONSTANT THROUGH TIME. THE DIVERSIFICATION OF MOST WILD TAXA OCCURRED DURING THE PLEISTOCENE, AND ITS DATE OF DIVERGENCE IS CONCORDANT WITH THE DATES OF DIVERGENCE REPORTED FOR SPECIALIZED BEES OF THE GENERA XENOGLOSSA AND PEPONAPIS, SUGGESTING A PROCESS OF COEVOLUTION BETWEEN CUCURBITA AND THEIR MAIN POLLINATORS THAT SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.

LANDFILL RESTORATION AND THE CREATION OF FORAGING AND NESTING HABITAT RESULTED IN RAPID AND PERSISTENT OCCUPATION BY BEES, SUGGESTING THAT EFFORTS TO RESTORE BEE COMMUNITIES CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN A SOURCE OF COLONISTS EXISTS NEARBY. 4. BASED ON EARLIER STUDIES, WE PREDICTED THAT IN RESTORED SITES THERE WOULD BE AN INITIAL RAPID INCREASE IN BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, FOLLOWED BY A DECLINE TO A STABLE INTERMEDIATE LEVEL. THIS PREDICTION WAS SUPPORTED AS BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN RESTORED SITES INCREASED UNTIL 2006/2007 AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED. 5. IN CONTROL SITES, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OVER TIME, DESPITE A LACK OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE. POSSIBLE CONTRIBUTORS ARE CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS, ESPECIALLY SEVERE DROUGHTS, PLANT COMMUNITY SUCCESSION RESULTING IN LOSS OF BARE GROUND FOR NESTING SITES, AND INCREASING SUBURBANISATION OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE.",ABUNDANCE; ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE; BEE COMMUNITY RESTORATION; DEMOGRAPHIC VARIATION; LONG-TERM STUDY; SPECIES RICHNESS,HALICTUS-LIGATUS HYMENOPTERA; SOUTHERN ONTARIO; RESTORATION; DIVERSITY; APOIDEA; ABUNDANCE; PATTERNS; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; FAUNA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ONUFERKO, TM (REPRINT AUTHOR), YORK UNIV, DEPT BIOL, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;RICHARDS, MH (REPRINT AUTHOR), BROCK UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, ST CATHARINES, ON, CANADA.;ONUFERKO, TM, RICHARDS, MH (REPRINT AUTHOR), 4700 KEELE ST, N YORK, ON M3J 1P3, CANADA.;ONUFERKO, THOMAS M., YORK UNIV, DEPT BIOL, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;SKANDALIS, DIMITRI A., UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA, DEPT ZOOL, VANCOUVER, BC, CANADA.;CORDERO, RODRIGO LEON, UNIV GUELPH, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, GUELPH, ON, CANADA.;RICHARDS, MIRIAM H., BROCK UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, ST CATHARINES, ON, CANADA.",10.1111/ICAD.12261,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NSERC DISCOVERY GRANTSNATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA; NSERC-CANPOLIN STRATEGIC NETWORK; BROCK UNIVERSITY GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS,"WE THANK THE MANY UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS AND FIELD ASSISTANTS WHO HELPED TO COLLECT BEES AND CREATE THE DATABASE, ESPECIALLY JESSI DE HAAN AND MARK FRAMPTON.

ENVIRON.,"INSECT POLLINATORS APPEAR TO BE EXPERIENCING WORLDWIDE DECLINES, A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN CORRELATED BOTH WITH EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL PESTICIDES AND DISEASE PREVALENCE. THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE STRONG AND OFTEN INTERACTING NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON MULTIPLE POLLINATOR SPECIES IN LABORATORY BASED STUDIES, HOWEVER THEIR INTERACTIONS IN THE FIELD ARE LESS CLEAR. TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE LINK BETWEEN PESTICIDE USE ON POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES, AND HOW THIS MIGHT IMPACT ON DISEASE TRANSMISSION, WE TOOK TWO COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES. FIRST, WE UNDERTOOK A SERIES OF POLLINATOR SURVEYS TO ASSESS THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF POLLINATOR GROUPS ACROSS BRITISH AGRICULTURAL FIELD SITES SUBJECT TO VARYING LEVELS OF PESTICIDE USE. WE THEN SCREENED THE OFFSPRING OF TWO TAXA OF TUBE NESTING SOLITARY BEES (OSMIABICOMIS AND MEGACHILE SPP.) FOR THREE PARASITE GROUPS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATORS. WE FOUND LOWER POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, GROUP RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY ACROSS AGRICULTURAL SITES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PESTICIDE USE. SPECIFICALLY, THERE WERE FEWER HONEY BEES, HOVERFLIES, SOLITARY BEES AND WASPS. SURPRISINGLY, WE FOUND A LOWER PREVALENCE OF ALL THREE PARASITE GROUPS IN O. BICOMIS OFFSPRING REARED IN SITES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PESTICIDE USE COMPARED TO LOWER PESTICIDE USE. WE ALSO FOUND A LOWER PREVALENCE OF ASCOSPHAERA BUT A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF MICROSPORIDIA IN MEGACHILE OFFSPRING REARED IN SITES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PESTICIDE USE COMPARED TO LOWER PESTICIDE USE. TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AGRICULTURAL SITES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PESTICIDE USE MAY BE AFFECTING POLLINATORS INDIRECTLY BY DISRUPTING COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND INFLUENCING DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND VECTORING OPPORTUNITIES.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ADAPTED FORAGE TYPES (SPECIES OR MIXTURES) AFFECTED INSECT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE IN PASTURES. FORAGING INSECTS WERE COLLECTED USING BEE BOWLS AND COMPARED AMONG OWB ALONE, OWB MIXED WITH ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA L.), ALFALFA, AND A NATIVE GRASS MIX. TWENTYONE FAMILIES FROM FOUR ORDERS OF INSECTS WERE RECOVERED OVER 3 YR. SWEAT BEE (HYMENOPTERA: HALICTIDAE) WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY, WITH 59\% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INSECTS COLLECTED.

ALL THREE CONDITIONS HAVE ELEMENTS OF TROPICAL DRY FOREST AND ARC IN THE ``SIERRA DE QUILA FLORA AND FAUNA PROTECTION AREA AND ITS INFLUENCE ZONE. SAMPLING WAS CARRIED OUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR (THREE DAYS PER MONTH) FOR EACH LAND-USE CONDITION.

A TOTAL OF 14,054 INDIVIDUALS FROM 160 SPECIES WERE REGISTERED. A RAREFACTION ANALYSIS, SHOWED THAT THE PRESERVED AREAS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY. BETA DIVERSITY ANALYSIS REVEALED A SPECIES TURNOVER OF NEARLY 32\% AMONG EACH PAIR OF CONDITIONS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE CHANGES IN LAND-USE NEGATIVELY AFFECT RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY AND CAUSES MAJOR CHANGES IN SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE BEE COMMUNITY.

FEEDING OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED UNDER SEMI-NATURAL CONDITIONS WERE COMBINED WITH MICRO-MORPHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION USING LM, SEM AND MICRO CT TECHNIQUES. THE MORPHOMETRIC COMPARISON SHOWED THAT ONLY THE COMPONENTS OF THE MOUTHPARTS THAT FORM THE FOOD TUBE DIFFER IN LENGTH, WHILE THE PROXIMAL COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROBOSCIS MOVEMENTS, ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE. THIS STUDY REPRESENTS THE FIRST DOCUMENTATION OF LAPPING BEHAVIOUR IN EUGLOSSINI. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT EUGLOSSA BEES USE A LAPPING-SUCKING MODE OF FEEDING TO TAKE UP SMALL AMOUNTS OF FLUID, AND A PURELY SUCTORIAL TECHNIQUE FOR LARGER FLUID QUANTITIES. THE MOUTHPART MOVEMENTS ARE LARGELY SIMILAR TO THAT IN OTHER LONG-TONGUED BEES, EXCEPT THAT THE POST-MENTUM IN EUGLOSSA CAN BE EXTENDED, GREATLY ENHANCING THE PROTRACTION OF THE GLOSSA.

SCI. POLLUT. RES.,"LOSS OF SUITABLE SEMINATURAL HABITATS AND HOMOGENIZATION OF CROP TYPES HAVE LED TO THE POPULATION DECLINE OF POLLINATING INSECTS IN FARMLAND. AS THESE INSECTS SUPPORT CROP PRODUCTION, MANY PRACTICAL EFFORTS AIM TO SUSTAIN POLLINATOR DIVERSITY WHICH IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED AND HOMOGENEOUS FARMLAND. HOWEVER, THERE ARE ONGOING CHANGES OF THE FARMLAND TOWARD ITS MULTIFUNCTIONALITY THAT INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, WIND FARM DEVELOPMENT. WINDMILLS ARE OFTEN BUILT WITHIN CROPS, THUS, WE EXAMINED IF THE NONCROPPED AREA AROUND WINDMILLS CAN BE VALUABLE HABITATS FOR WILD PLANTS AND POLLINATING INSECTS: BEES, BUTTERFLIES, AND FLIES. SPECIES RICHNESS, ABUNDANCES, AND SPECIES DIVERSITY INDEX OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AROUND WINDMILLS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOUND IN GRASSLAND PATCHES (A TYPICAL HABITAT FOR THESE INSECTS) AND HIGHER THAN IN THE ADJACENT CROPS. POLLINATOR DIVERSITY INDEX AND SPECIES RICHNESS AT WINDMILLS INCREASED WITH THE DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST GRASSLAND PATCH AND WINDMILL. THE POPULATION SIZES OF POLLINATING INSECTS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PLANT DIVERSITY. PARTICULAR GROUPS OF POLLINATORS SHOWED SPECIFIC HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS: BEES OCCURRED MOSTLY AT WINDMILLS, BUTTERFLIES WERE HIGHLY ASSOCIATED WITH GRASSLANDS, WHILE FLIES OCCURRED IN A SIMILAR NUMBER AT WINDMILL AND ON GRASSLANDS. SINCE WINDMILLS ARE FREQUENTLY BUILT WITHIN EXTENSIVE HOMOGENEOUS FIELDS, THUS, THEY INTRODUCE POLLINATION SERVICES INTO THE INTERIOR OF CROPPED AREAS, CONTRARY TO FIELD MARGINS, ROAD VERGES, OR SEMINATURAL GRASSLANDS. THUS, ALTHOUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF WIND FARMS HAS VARIOUS NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES, THEY CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY THE INCREASE OF THE LOCAL POPULATION SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF WILD PLANTS AND POLLINATING INSECTS AT WINDMILLS.",AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE; BIODIVERSITY; MARGINAL HABITAT; POLLINATOR DECLINE; WEED; WIND FARM,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; LIMESTONE QUARRIES; BEES HYMENOPTERA; WIND TURBINES; DIVERSITY; HABITAT; IMPACTS; RESTORATION; COMMUNITIES; DECLINES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"PUSTKOWIAK, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), POLISH ACAD SCI, INST NAT CONSERVAT, MICKIEWICZA 33, PL-31120 KRAKOW, POLAND.;PUSTKOWIAK, SYLWIA, SKORKA, PIOTR, POLISH ACAD SCI, INST NAT CONSERVAT, MICKIEWICZA 33, PL-31120 KRAKOW, POLAND.;BANASZAK-CIBICKA, WERONIKA, TRYJANOWSKI, PIOTR, POZNAN UNIV LIFE SCI, INST ZOOL, POZNAN, POLAND.;MIELCZAREK, LUKASZ EMIL, AGR UNIV KRAKOW, DEPT POMOL \& APICULTURE, KRAKOW, POLAND.",10.1007/S11356-017-0864-7,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",NA,"INSTITUTE OF NATURE CONSERVATION, POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (KRAKOW, POLAND); INSTITUTE OF BOTANY, POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (KRAKOW, POLAND)","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE INSTITUTE OF NATURE CONSERVATION, POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (KRAKOW, POLAND) THROUGH THE INSTITUTE'S STATUTORY FUNDS AND THROUGH GRANT FUNDING FOR PHD STUDENTS AND YOUNG SCIENTISTS GIVEN FROM THE INSTITUTE OF BOTANY, POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES (KRAKOW, POLAND).",0944-1344,7,6273-6284,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,25,2018,ISI000426571000018,72,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,24,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,SYLWIA.PUSTKOWIAKGMAIL.COM BANASZAKUP.POZNAN.PL LUKASZINSECTS.PL PIOTR.TRYJANOWSKIGMAIL.COM SKORASPGMAIL.COM,FY1KN,"PUSTKOWIAK, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), POLISH ACAD SCI, INST NAT CONSERVAT, MICKIEWICZA 33, PL-31120 KRAKOW, POLAND",ISI,none,INST NAT CONSERVAT;POZNAN UNIV LIFE SCI;AGR UNIV KRAKOW,INST NAT CONSERVAT,NA,"PUSTKOWIAK S, 2018, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT RES","PUSTKOWIAK S, 2018, ENVIRON SCI POLLUT RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,Jon Koch

AT THE REDSTONE ARSENAL POPULATION, ALABAMA, WE STUDIED ITS BREEDING SYSTEM, DETERMINED MAJOR FLORAL VISITORS AND THEIR POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS, AND EXPLORED POLLEN LIMITATION OF FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTION. FRUIT INITIATION WAS LOW (3.9\%) FOR CROSS-POLLINATED FLOWERS BUT ONLY MARGINALLY GREATER THAN FOR SELF-POLLINATED OR NONPOLLINATED FLOWERS (NONE INITIATED A FRUIT). MOST FLORAL VISITS (97\%) WERE BY BEES WITH 43\% OF VISITS BY LARGE BEES (> 1.5 CM IN LENGTH) AND 51\% BY MEDIUM BEES (1-1.5 CM IN LENGTH). KEEL PETALS OF A. PRICEANA FLOWERS ENCLOSE THE STYLE AND STAMENS: FLOWERS MUST BE ``TRIPPED'' FOR POLLINATION TO OCCUR. LARGE AND MEDIUM BEES WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN TRIPPING FLOWERS, WHEREAS SMALL BEES (< 1 CM IN LENGTH) DID NOT TRIP FLOWERS. SUCCESS OF LARGE AND MEDIUM BEE SPECIES (SEVERAL BOMBUS SPECIES AND MEGACHILE SCULPTURALIS SMITH) IN INITIATING LEGUMES AFTER A SINGLE FLORAL VISIT RANGED FROM 17-35\% BUT DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG SPECIES.

LINDH M;RIPA J;JOHANSSON J,LINDH M,EVOLUTION OF REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY IN ANNUAL SOCIAL INSECTS COMPETING FOR FLORAL RESOURCES,EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH,EVOL. ECOL. RES.,"QUESTION: HOW DOES REPRODUCTIVE TIMING IN ANNUAL SOCIAL INSECTS EVOLVE UNDER INTRASPECIFIC EXPLOITATION COMPETITION AND IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT? THE LATTER INCLUDES SHIFTS IN RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, MORTALITY, SEASON LENGTH, AND RESOURCE PEAK TIMING, FACTORS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. BACKGROUND: CLIMATE AND LAND USE ARE CHANGING. EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY MUST LEARN TO PREDICT HOW ORGANISMS ARE AFFECTED BY, AND MIGHT ADAPT TO, SUCH CHANGES. CLASSIC THEORY PREDICTS HOW THE TIMING OF REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS WITH AN ANNUAL LIFE-CYCLE (INCLUDING MANY PLANTS AND SOCIAL INSECTS) OPTIMALLY BALANCES THEIR PHASES OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION WITH SEASONAL RESOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS. BUT THEORY HAS YET TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INTERACTIONS WITHIN OR BETWEEN SPECIES. METHOD: WE USE INVASION ANALYSIS TO CALCULATE THE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE REPRODUCTION TIME BY EXTENDING A CLASSIC MODEL OF ANNUAL SOCIAL INSECTS (SUCH AS BUMBLEBEES) TO INCLUDE COMPETITION FOR SEASONALLY VARIABLE RESOURCES. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF (COLONY) PRODUCTION: VEGETATIVE (WORKERS) AND REPRODUCTIVE (QUEENS). THE INITIAL WORKER DENSITY IN THE LANDSCAPE DEPENDS ON THE DENSITY OF THE SURVIVING QUEENS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR. REPRODUCTION TIME IS APPROXIMATED AS A SUDDEN (BANG-BANG) SWITCH FROM VEGETATIVE TO REPRODUCTIVE PRODUCTION DURING THE SEASON. WE COMPARE THE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGY (ESS) WITH THE CLASSICAL OPTIMIZATION RESULT WITHOUT COMPETITION. WE ALSO COMPARE IT WITH THE STRATEGY THAT MAXIMIZES POPULATION SIZE UNDER RESOURCE COMPETITION. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: UNDER RESOURCE COMPETITION, THE ESS REPRODUCTION TIME OCCURS EARLIER THAN THE OPTIMUM PREDICTED BY CLASSIC THEORY. BUT THE ESS IS LATER THAN THE STRATEGY THAT MAXIMIZES POPULATION SIZE. THUS PHENOLOGICAL ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IS LIKELY TO REDUCE POPULATION SIZES. BOTH THE ESS AND THE OPTIMAL REPRODUCTIVE TIME CHANGE MORE SLOWLY THAN DO SHIFTS IN SEASONAL RESOURCE PEAKS. HENCE A GROWING ASYNCHRONY BETWEEN PEAK FLOWERING TIMES AND THE TIMING OF BUMBLEBEE REPRODUCTION - OFTEN INTERPRETED AS A PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH - MAY ACTUALLY BE AN ADAPTIVE RESPONSE OF POLLINATORS IN THIS SYSTEM.",ADAPTIVE DYNAMICS; ANNUAL SOCIAL INSECT; BUMBLEBEE; CLIMATE CHANGE; PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY; RESOURCE COMPETITION,NA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"LINDH, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT PHYS GEOG, SE-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;LINDH, MAGNUS, STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT PHYS GEOG, SE-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;RIPA, JORGEN, JOHANSSON, JACOB, LUND UNIV, DEPT BIOL, LUND, SWEDEN.;JOHANSSON, JACOB, IMPERIAL COLL LONDON, DEPT LIFE SCI, SILWOOD PK, LONDON, ENGLAND.",NA,"UNIV ARIZONA, 321 BIOSCIENCES WEST, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA",NA,"SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL FORMASSWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCILSWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL FORMAS [2015-839, 2016-00998]; SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL (VR GRANT)SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL [2012-03620]; SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCILSWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL [2015-00302]; MARIE SKLODOWSKA CURIE ACTIONS [INCA 600398]; BECC (BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE)","THE AUTHORS THANK RICHARD GILL, EVA KISDI, AND DANIEL BOLNICK FOR HELPFUL DISCUSSIONS AND INPUT.

HONEYDEW-PRODUCING TREEHOPPERS FREQUENTLY OCCUR ON INFLORESCENCES, POTENTIALLY ENHANCING ANT-MEDIATED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON POLLINATION SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF ANT-ATTENDED, HONEYDEW-PRODUCING INSECTS ON PLANT REPRODUCTION REMAINS UNCERTAIN. WE RECORDED THE ABUNDANCE OF TREEHOPPERS AND ANTS ON BYRSONIMA INTERMEDIA (MALPIGHIACEAE), AND MONITORED FLORAL VISITORS IN A BRAZILIAN CERRADO SAVANNA. WE MANIPULATED THE PRESENCE OF ANTS AND ANT-TREEHOPPER ASSOCIATIONS ON INFLORESCENCES TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECT ON POLLINATION AND FRUIT FORMATION. WE USED DRIED ANTS PINNED TO INFLORESCENCES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANT PRESENCE AND ANT IDENTITY ON POTENTIAL POLLINATORS. RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PRESENCE OF TREEHOPPERS INCREASES ANT ABUNDANCE ON FLOWERS AND DISRUPTS POLLINATION BY OIL-COLLECTING BEES, DECREASING THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF FLORAL VISITS AND REDUCING FRUIT AND SEED SET. TREEHOPPER HERBIVORY HAS NO DIRECT EFFECT ON FRUIT OR SEED PRODUCTION, WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF TREEHOPPER DENSITY. PINNED ANTS PROMOTE AVOIDANCE BY FLORAL VISITORS, REDUCING THE NUMBER OF VISITS. ANT IDENTITY MEDIATES VISITATION DECISIONS, WITH ECTATOMMA BRUNNEUM CAUSING GREATER AVOIDANCE BY FLORAL VISITORS THAN CAMPONOTUS RUFIPES.

FURTHERMORE, THE NAD4 GENE END WITH A SINGLE T IN ALL THREE ANDRENA SPECIES. ALL TRNAS COULD BE FOLDED INTO CLOVER-LEAF SECONDARY STRUCTURE EXCEPT FOR TRNS1, WITH THE DIHYDROURACIL (DHU) ARM FORMING A SIMPLE LOOP. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ON 17 ANDRENA MITOGENOMES.

MOST ESTIMATES HAVE, MOREOVER, BEEN PERFORMED AT PLANT SCALE, A SCALE THAT IS NOT RELEVANT FOR FARMERS WHO CALCULATE AT THE FIELD SCALE. IN THIS FOUR-YEAR STUDY, WE QUANTIFIED THE CONTRIBUTION OF INSECT POLLINATION TO SUNFLOWER YIELD AT FIELD AND PLANT SCALES IN WORKING FARM FIELDS DISTRIBUTED ALONG A GRADIENT OF POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE. POLLINATORS WERE FOUND TO INCREASE FIELD YIELD UP TO 40\% (I.E. 0.7 T/HA) AND BY 31.3\% AT PLANT SCALE, THE MAGNITUDE OF EFFECT ON YIELD BEING THEREFORE SIMILAR AT BOTH SCALES. THE POLLINATORS INCREASED THE YIELD BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FERTILIZED SEEDS PER PLANT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE UNIT MASS OF THE SEEDS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN NUMBER OF SEEDS AND UNIT MASS. AMONG POLLINATORS, HONEYBEES WERE THE MAIN TAXON IMPACTING SUNFLOWER YIELD. SUNFLOWER PLANT DENSITY WAS A STRONG DETERMINANT OF YIELD, WITH HIGHER NUMBERS ATTRACTING INCREASED NUMBERS OF HONEYBEES. USING POLLINATOR AND WIND EXCLUSION, WE FINALLY QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SELF-POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 40\%), INSECT POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 35\%) AND WIND POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 20\%). OUR RESULTS SHOW, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF THE KEY ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN SUNFLOWER PRODUCTION AT FIELD SCALE IN REAL FARMING CONDITIONS, AND UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.

CONSERV.,"CLIMATE CHANGE IS A KEY THREAT TO POLLINATION NETWORKS AND HAS ALREADY CAUSED SHIFTS IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND PHENOLOGY OF MANY BEE SPECIES. PREDICTIONS BASED ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS FORECAST THAT MOST BEE SPECIES WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE AS CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRESSES, THE FEW EXCEPTIONS TO THIS BEING COMMON, WIDESPREAD SPECIES WITH LARGE DISPERSAL CAPABILITIES. MOST OF THE BEES STUDIED SO FAR ARE TEMPERATE OR TROPICAL SPECIES BUT MANY ECOSYSTEMS ARE PREDICTED TO EXPERIENCE INCREASED ARIDIFICATION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. THEREFORE, WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO RESPOND. HERE WE PRESENT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS FOR THE ARID-ADAPTED AUSTRALIAN SMALL CARPENTER BEE, CERATINA AUSTRALENSIS PERKINS, 1912 (APIDAE: XYLOCOPINAE) UNDER INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) CLIMATE CHANGE CONDITIONS PREDICTED FOR 2070 (REPRESENTATIVE CARBON PATHWAY 8.5). WE APPLIED MAXIMUM ENTROPY, GENERALIZED LINEAR MODELS, GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODELS AND RANDOM FOREST METHODS. OVERALL, OUR MODELS PREDICT THAT THIS BEE WILL HAVE AN INCREASED AREA OF SUITABLE HABITAT AS CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRESSES, INCLUDING AN INCREASED RANGE WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS. HOWEVER, ITS POTENTIAL RANGE WILL SHIFT FURTHER INTO COASTAL AREAS, THAT ARE HIGHLY HUMAN POPULATED AND URBANISED. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WILD BEE TAXA MAY BE ABLE TO COPE WITH THE PREDICTED SCALE OF FUTURE ARIDIFICATION UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. FINALLY, THIS SPECIES IS PREDICTED TO INCREASE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR CITY PLANNING, SUITABLE HABITATS AND GREEN SPACES TO SUPPORT WILD BEE SPECIES.

MORTALITY IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA. BEE DEATHS HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED, WITH INADEQUATE EVIDENCE, TO TOXICITY FROM MANNOSE IN NECTAR OR STARVATION DUE TO LOW NECTAR IN LATE BLOOMING LINDEN. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED BOTH FACTORS VIA UNTARGETED METABOLOMIC ANALYSES OF NECTAR FROM FIVE T. CORDATA TREES BENEATH WHICH CRAWLING/DEAD BUMBLE BEES (B. VOSNESENSKII) WERE OBSERVED, AND OF THORACIC MUSCLE OF 28 HEALTHY FORAGING AND 29 CRAWLING BEES COLLECTED FROM LINDEN TREES ON COOL MORNINGS (< 30 DEGREES C). NECTAR CONTAINED THE PYRIDINE ALKALOID TRIGONELLINE, A WEAK ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR, BUT NO MANNOSE.

MICHAUD KM;IRWIN RE;BARBER NA;ADLER LS,MICHAUD KM,PREINFECTION EFFECTS OF NECTAR SECONDARY COMPOUNDS ON A BUMBLE BEE GUT PATHOGEN,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,ENVIRON. ENTOMOL.,"BUMBLE BEE POLLINATORS CAN BE EXPOSED TO PATHOGENS WHEN FORAGING ON FLOWERS PREVIOUSLY VISITED BY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. INFECTIOUS CELLS MAY BE DEPOSITED IN FLORAL NECTAR, PROVIDING A SITE FOR PATHOGENS TO INTERACT WITH NECTAR SECONDARY COMPOUNDS PRIOR TO INFECTING BEES. SOME NECTAR SECONDARY COMPOUNDS CAN REDUCE PATHOGEN COUNTS IN INFECTED BUMBLE BEES, BUT WE KNOW LESS ABOUT HOW EXPOSURE TO THESE COMPOUNDS DIRECTLY AFFECTS PATHOGENS PRIOR TO BEING INGESTED BY THEIR HOST. WE EXPOSED THE TRYPANOSOMATID GUT PATHOGEN, CRITHIDIA BOMBI (LIPA \& TRIGGIANI 1988) (TRYPANOSOMATIDA:TRYPANOSOMATIDAE), TO SIX DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS FOUND IN NECTAR (AUCUBIN, CATALPOL, NICOTINE, THYMOL, ANABASINE, AND CITRIC ACID) FOR 1-H PRIOR TO INGESTION BY BOMBUS IMPATIENS (CRESSON 1863) (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE) WORKERS THAT WERE THEN REARED FOR 1 WK ON A CONTROL DIET. ALL OF THESE COMPOUNDS EXCEPT CITRIC ACID REDUCE PATHOGEN LEVELS WHEN CONSUMED IN HOSTS AFTER INFECTION, AND CITRIC ACID IS A COMMON PRESERVATIVE FOUND IN CITRUS FRUITS AND SOME HONEYS. WE FOUND THAT BOTH CITRIC ACID AND AUCUBIN REDUCED CRITHIDIA CELL COUNTS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. HOWEVER, CATALPOL, NICOTINE, THYMOL, AND ANABASINE DID NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON CRITHIDIA LEVELS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CRITHIDIA EXPOSURE IN SOME FLORAL NECTARS MAY REDUCE CELL VIABILITY, RESULTING IN A LOWER RISK TO VISITING POLLINATORS, BUT THIS EFFECT MAY NOT BE WIDESPREAD ACROSS ALL FLOWERING SPECIES.",BEE DISEASE; FLORAL TRAITS; POLLINATOR DECLINE; SECONDARY METABOLITES,DECLINE; SPECIFICITY; MICROBIOTA; TOLERANCE; VIRULENCE; IMPACTS; ACID,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"MICHAUD, KM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MASSACHUSETTS, DEPT BIOL, AMHERST, MA 01003 USA.;MICHAUD, KM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT \& MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.;MICHAUD, KRISTEN M., ADLER, LYNN S., UNIV MASSACHUSETTS, DEPT BIOL, AMHERST, MA 01003 USA.;IRWIN, REBECCA E., NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT APPL ECOL, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.;BARBER, NICHOLAS A., SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA.;BARBER, NICHOLAS A., SAN DIEGO STATE UNIV, ECOL PROGRAM AREA, SAN DIEGO, CA 92182 USA.;MICHAUD, KRISTEN M., UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA, DEPT ECOL EVOLUT \& MARINE BIOL, SANTA BARBARA, CA 93106 USA.",10.1093/EE/NVZ018,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,"NATIONAL RESEARCH INITIATIVE (NRI) ARTHROPOD AND NEMATODE BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OF THE USDA COOPERATIVE STATE RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND EXTENSION SERVICE (CSREES) GRANT [USDA-AFRI 2013-02536]; [NSF-DEB-1258096]","WE THANK BIOBEST FOR GENEROUS DONATION OF BUMBLE BEE COLONIES, AND A.

BAUR A;STRANGE JP;KOCH JB,BAUR A,"FORAGING ECONOMICS OF THE HUNT BUMBLE BEE, A VIABLE POLLINATOR FOR COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,ENVIRON. ENTOMOL.,"GLOBALLY, THERE ARE ONLY FIVE BUMBLE BEE (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE, BOMBUS) SPECIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZED FOR AGRICULTURE. THE HUNT BUMBLE BEE, BOMBUS HUNTII GREEN, 1860, HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A SUITABLE POLLINATOR OF CROPS AND HAS A BROAD DISTRIBUTION IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA, MAKING IT A VIABLE CANDIDATE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. IN THIS STUDY, OUR GOAL WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE FORAGING DYNAMICS OF B. HUNTII FEMALE WORKERS UNDER OPEN FIELD CONDITIONS. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, WE MONITORED THREE B. HUNTII COLONIES OVER AN 8-WK PERIOD IN THE SUMMER OF 2012 IN NORTHERN UTAH. USING MARKED BEES, WE STUDIED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORAGING DURATION/OFFLOADING AND POLLEN/NONVISIBLE POLLEN COLLECTION. IN TOTAL, WE OBSERVED 921 FORAGING EVENTS ACROSS ALL THREE COLONIES. OF OUR OBSERVATIONS, 82\% (N=756) WERE FORAGING EVENTS THAT INCLUDED BOTH A DEPARTURE AND ARRIVAL TIME OBSERVATION. AVERAGE DURATION OF POLLEN AND NONPOLLEN (I.E., NECTAR) TRIPS ACROSS FORAGERS IS 41.86 +/- 5.65 MIN (+/- SE) AND 32.18 +/- 5.89 MIN, RESPECTIVELY. WORKERS SPENT A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TIME OFFLOADING POLLEN IN THE NEST AFTER A FORAGING TRIP RELATIVE TO WORKERS WITHOUT POLLEN PRESENT ON THEIR CORBICULA. POLLEN FORAGING RATE INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY, LIKELY DUE TO THE TIME IT TAKES TO LEARN HOW TO FORAGE ON A DIVERSE ARRAY OF FLOWER MORPHOLOGIES. OUR STUDY PROVIDES DATA ON HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR B.

ECOL.,"POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONSTRAIN FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WITHIN PLANT POPULATIONS, YET POPULATIONS WITH HIGH COLOR VARIATION (AT LEAST IN HUMAN VISUAL SPACE) ARE COMMON IN NATURE. TO EXPLORE THIS PARADOX, WE COLLECTED FLORAL REFLECTANCE SPECTRA FOR 34 POPULATIONS OF 14 PUTATIVELY BEE-POLLINATED PLANT SPECIES OF NORTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, USA, AND TRANSLATED THEM INTO THREE DIFFERENT ANIMAL VISUAL SPACES. WE ASKED, (1) IS INTRAPOPULATION VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOR CONSTRAINED TO BE LOWER THAN THE DISCRIMINATION THRESHOLD OF THE PUTATIVE DOMINANT POLLINATORS? AND, (2) IS PERCEIVED INTRAPOPULATION VARIATION IN FLOWERS HIGHER FOR NON-POLLINATING ANIMALS THAN IT IS FOR THE PRESUMED DOMINANT POLLINATOR GROUP? WE FOUND EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH SOME POLLINATOR-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS ON FLORAL COLOR IN OUR SPECIES, WITH THE MAJORITY (70.6\%) OF POPULATIONS HAVING>95\% OF FLOWER-FLOWER OR FLOWER-CENTROID COMPARISONS (WHERE THE CENTROID REPRESENTS THE MEAN PHENOTYPE) ESTIMATED TO BE VISUALLY INDISCRIMINABLE TO BEES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT PERCEIVED FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FOR TWO NON-POLLINATING GROUPS-BIRDS AND HUMANS-THAN FOR BEES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A LARGE PORTION OF HUMAN-PERCEIVED FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WITHIN POPULATIONS PERSISTS BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVELY INVISIBLE TO POLLINATORS.

APPL.,"POLLINATION IS A KEY COMPONENT IN AGRICULTURAL FOOD PRODUCTION AND ECOSYSTEM MAINTENANCE, WITH PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AN IMPORTANT RESEARCH THEME IN ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES. NATURAL HISTORY COLLECTIONS PROVIDE UNIQUE ACCESS TO SAMPLES COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PLANT ORIGINS OF POLLEN TRAPPED ON THE BODIES OF POLLINATORS IN THESE COLLECTIONS PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO HISTORIC PLANT COMMUNITIES AND POLLINATORS' PREFERRED FLORAL TAXA. IN THIS STUDY, POLLEN WAS SAMPLED FROM MEGACHILE VENUSTA SMITH BEES FROM THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF INSECTS, SOUTH AFRICA, SPANNING 93 YEARS. THREE BARCODE REGIONS, THE INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER 1 AND 2 (ITS1 AND ITS2) AND RIBULOSE-1,5-BIPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE (RBCL), WERE SEQUENCED FROM MIXED POLLEN SAMPLES USING A NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING APPROACH (MISEQ, ILLUMINA). SEQUENCED READS WERE COMPARED TO SEQUENCE REFERENCE DATABASES THAT WERE GENERATED BY EXTRACTING SEQUENCE AND TAXONOMIC DATA FROM GENBANK. ITS1 AND ITS2 WERE AMPLIFIED SUCCESSFULLY ACROSS ALL (OR MOST) SAMPLES, WHILE RBCL PERFORMED INCONSISTENTLY. AGE OF SAMPLE HAD NO IMPACT ON SEQUENCING SUCCESS. PLANT CLASSIFICATION WAS MORE INFORMATIVE USING ITS2 THAN ITS1 BARCODE DATA. THIS STUDY ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE REFERENCE DATABASES AS LIMITED LOCAL PLANT SEQUENCE REPRESENTATION IN REFERENCE DATABASES RESULTED IN HIGHER-LEVEL TAXON CLASSIFICATIONS BEING MORE CONFIDENTLY INTERPRETED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SMALL, INSECT-CARRIED POLLEN SAMPLES FROM HISTORIC BEE SPECIMENS COLLECTED FROM AS EARLY AS 1914 CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN POLLEN METABARCODES. DNA METABARCODING OF MIXED ORIGIN POLLEN SAMPLES PROVIDED A FASTER, MORE ACCURATE METHOD OF DETERMINING POLLEN PROVENANCE, WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EXPERT PALYNOLOGISTS. THE USE OF HISTORIC COLLECTIONS TO SAMPLE POLLEN DIRECTLY FROM POLLINATORS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL VALUE TO THESE COLLECTIONS.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION HAVE REDUCED FLOWERING PLANT ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WORLDWIDE, WITH SUBSEQUENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON POLLINATORS. TO MITIGATE THESE EFFECTS, RESEARCH AND CONSERVATION HAVE FOCUSED ON INCORPORATING FLOWERING PLANTS INTO AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES THROUGH ON-FARM NATURAL AREAS OR FLOWERING CROPS. HOWEVER, WHILE COVER CROPS PROVIDE NUMEROUS AGROECOSYSTEM SERVICES, THEY HAVE RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION FOR THEIR ROLE IN PROVIDING FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE VALUE OF COVER CROPS FOR PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL SUMMER FLORAL RESOURCES FOR BOTH MANAGED AND WILD BEES IN THE NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS OF THE UNITED STATES, WHERE A LARGE PROPORTION OF HONEY BEE COLONIES SPEND THE SUMMER. SPECIFICALLY, USING AN EXPERIMENTAL RANDOMIZED PLOT DESIGN, WE COMPARED FLORAL RESOURCES AND BEE VISITATION RATES ACROSS 1, 2, 3, AND 6-SPECIES COVER CROP MIXES AS WELL A 6-SPECIES ANNUAL NATIVE WILDFLOWER MIX. WE FOUND THAT COVER CROP TREATMENTS INCLUDING BUCKWHEAT PROVIDED THE HIGHEST SUMMER-LONG FLORAL COVER, HIGHER THAN THE ANNUAL NATIVE WILDFLOWER MIX IN WHICH ONLY TWO OF SIX SPECIES BLOOMED, AND THAT TOTAL BEE VISITATION RATES INCREASED WITH HIGHER FLORAL COVER. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT BEES WERE ATTRACTED TO DIFFERENT TREATMENTS, HONEY BEES AND BUMBLE BEES WERE MOST ATTRACTED TO MIXES CONTAINING PHACELIA, WHILE LARGE-BODIED SOLITARY BEES WERE MORE ATTRACTED TO MIXES INCLUDING CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER AND TO THE WILDFLOWER MIX, ILLUSTRATING THAT THE OPTIMAL PLANTINGS FOR ATTRACTING SOCIAL OR MANAGED BEES MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ATTRACTING SOLITARY WILD BEES. ADDITIONALLY, WHILE SIMILAR NUMBERS OF BEE SPECIES VISITED THE THREE MAIN PLANTS IN OUR TREATMENTS (BUCKWHEAT, PHACELIA, AND CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER) MORE RARE SPECIES VISITED CULTIVATED SUNFLOWER WHILE MORE COMMON BEES VISITED BUCKWHEAT AND PHACELIA. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE VALUE OF ANNUAL COVER CROPS FOR PROVIDING POLLINATOR RESOURCES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, PARTICULARLY ON ROTATED LAND WHERE PERENNIAL FLOWER PLANTINGS ARE LESS FEASIBLE, BUT ILLUSTRATE TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN ATTRACTING A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMON GENERALIST OR MANAGED BEES VERSUS ATTRACTING FEWER INDIVIDUALS BUT SPECIES OF POTENTIAL CONSERVATION CONCERN.",HONEY BEE; NATIVE BEE; POLLINATOR PLANTING; PLANT DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; WILDFLOWERS,LAND-USE CHANGE; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; WILDFLOWER STRIPS; SPECIES RICHNESS; WEED SUPPRESSION; ABUNDANCE; INCREASE; SCALE; BIODIVERSITY; RESTORATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"MALLINGER, RE (REPRINT AUTHOR), ARS, USDA, RED RIVER VALLEY AGR RES CTR, 605 ALBRECHT BLVD N, FARGO, ND 58102 USA.;MALLINGER, RE (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ENTOMOL \& NEMATOL, 1881 NAT AREA DR, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.;MALLINGER, RACHEL E., PRASIFKA, JARRAD R., ARS, USDA, RED RIVER VALLEY AGR RES CTR, 605 ALBRECHT BLVD N, FARGO, ND 58102 USA.;FRANCO, JOSE G., ARS, USDA, NORTHERN GREAT PLAINS RES LAB, 1701 10THAVE SW, MANDAN, ND 58554 USA.;PRISCHMANN-VOLDSETH, DEIRDRE A., NORTH DAKOTA STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, 1300 ALBRECHT BLVD,202 HULTZ HALL, FARGO, ND 58102 USA.;MALLINGER, RACHEL E., UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT ENTOMOL \& NEMATOL, 1881 NAT AREA DR, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.",10.1016/J.AGEE.2018.12.006,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,USDA-ARS LONG-TERM AGROECOSYSTEM RESEARCH (LTAR) NETWORK,"THE AUTHORS THANK ZOE PORTLAS, LISA BROWN, JAMIE MILLER -DUNBAR, HOLLY JOHNSON, ANDREW CARRLSON, DELMER SCHLENKER, KYRA SULLIVAN, AND TARA HELFRICH FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN MAINTAINING PLOTS AND COLLECTING DATA.

DURING THESE PERIODS, FAILURE TO STORE ADEQUATE NUTRIENTS CAN HAVE PERSISTENT EFFECTS ON FITNESS. HERE, WE EXAMINED A CRITICAL BUT UNDER-STUDIED NUTRIENT STORAGE PERIOD IN QUEEN BUMBLE BEES: THE FIRST DAYS OF ADULT LIFE, WHICH ARE FOLLOWED BY A DIAPAUSE PERIOD TYPICALLY COINCIDING WITH WINTER. WE EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED AVAILABILITY OF POLLEN (THE PRIMARY DIETARY SOURCE OF LIPIDS AND PROTEIN) AND THE SUGAR CONCENTRATION OF ARTIFICIAL NECTAR (THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF CARBOHYDRATES) FOR LABORATORY-REARED QUEENS DURING THIS PERIOD AND EXAMINED THREE NUTRITIONAL PHENOMENA: (I) DIET IMPACTS ON NUTRITIONAL STATUS, (II) THE TIMESCALE UPON WHICH NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION OCCURS AND (III) THE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF NUTRIENT SEQUESTRATION, SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO SURVIVAL ACROSS THE LIFE CYCLE. WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT POLLEN AND NECTAR STARVATION NEGATIVELY IMPACT LIPID STORAGE, WHEREAS NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION IMPACTS STORED CARBOHYDRATES. THE MAJORITY OF NUTRIENTS WERE STORED DURING THE FIRST SIMILAR TO 3 DAYS OF ADULT LIFE. NUTRIENTS DERIVED FROM POLLEN DURING THIS PERIOD APPEAR TO BE MORE CRITICAL FOR SURVIVING EARLIER LIFE STAGES, WHEREAS NUTRIENTS SEQUESTERED FROM NECTAR BECOME MORE IMPORTANT FOR SURVIVING THE DIAPAUSE AND POST-DIAPAUSE PERIODS. NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF A POOR DIET DURING EARLY LIFE PERSISTED IN OUR EXPERIMENT, EVEN WHEN POLLEN AND A RELATIVELY HIGH (50\%) NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION WERE PROVIDED POST-DIAPAUSE. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, WE POSIT THAT THE NUTRITIONAL ENVIRONMENT DURING THE EARLY ADULT LIFE OF QUEENS HAS BOTH IMMEDIATE AND PERSISTENT IMPACTS ON FITNESS. THESE FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF EXAMINING EFFECTS OF STAGE-SPECIFIC NUTRITIONAL LIMITATIONS ON PHYSIOLOGY AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS IN THIS SOCIAL INSECT GROUP.

IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF BUMBLE BEE HABITAT SUITABILITY (HS) IN THE PHILIPPINES ACROSS PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED AREAS. MAXIMUM ENTROPY SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) OF B. FLAVESCENS AND B.

RES. LETT.,"THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE STATUS AND TRENDS OF ANIMAL POLLINATORS WORLDWIDE. POLLINATORS PROVIDE A KEY SERVICE TO BOTH WILD PLANTS AND CROPS BY MEDIATING THEIR REPRODUCTION, SO POLLINATOR CONSERVATION IS OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE TO CONSERVATION AND TO FOOD PRODUCTION. UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXTENT OF POLLINATOR DECLINES IS CONSTRAINED BY THE PAUCITY OF ACCESSIBLE DATA, WHICH LEADS TO GEOGRAPHICALLY- AND TAXONOMICALLY-BIASED ASSESSMENTS. IN ADDITION, LAND CONVERSION TO AGRICULTURE AND INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT ARE TWO OF THE MAIN THREATS TO POLLINATORS. THIS IS PARADOXICAL, AS CROP PRODUCTION DEPENDS ON POLLINATORS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVITY. THERE IS A NEED TO RECONCILE CONSERVATION AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVISION IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. THESE CHALLENGES REQUIRE COORDINATED TRANSDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES. SPECIFICALLY, WE NEED BETTER RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES TO (I) DESCRIBE POLLINATOR DECLINE PATTERNS WORLDWIDE, (II) MONITOR CURRENT POLLINATOR TRENDS, AND (III) UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENHANCE POLLINATOR NUMBERS AND POLLINATION IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. THIS CAN BE ACHIEVED, FIRST, BY REDOUBLING THE EFFORTS TO MAKE HISTORICAL DATA ON SPECIES OCCURRENCES, INTERACTIONS AND TRAITS OPENLY AVAILABLE AND EASY TO INTEGRATE ACROSS DATABASES. SECOND, BY EMPOWERING CITIZEN SCIENCE TO MONITOR KEY POLLINATOR SPECIES IN A COORDINATED WAY AND STANDARDIZING, CONSOLIDATING AND INTEGRATING LONG TERM COLLECTION PROTOCOLS BOTH IN NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL AREAS. FINALLY, THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP MULTI-ACTOR, LOCALISED RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURES ALLOWING INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGICAL APPROACHES IN AGRICULTURE. WE ILLUSTRATE HOW DECENTRALIZED INFRASTRUCTURES CAN ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF CO-PRODUCING RESEARCH AND INTEGRATING DATA COLLECTION ACROSS SCIENTISTS, MANAGERS, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, FARMERS AND DISCIPLINES.

POLLINATOR VISITATION SURVEYS AND MANIPULATIVE HAND-POLLINATION TREATMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND SUBSEQUENT SEED PRODUCTION. WE USED AN EXPERIMENTAL SEED BURIAL TO EXAMINE THE BREAKDOWN OF THE WOODY ENDOCARP AND CHANGES TO GERMINATION OVER TIME. SEED GERMINATION RESPONSE UNDER SIMULATED LOCAL SEASONAL CONDITIONS WAS ALSO EXAMINED. PERSOONIA PAUCIFLORA WAS FOUND TO BE PREDOMINANTLY POLLINATED BY NATIVE BEES, AND CROSS-POLLINATED FLOWERS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MATURE FRUIT (18 +/- 3\%) THAN SELF-POLLINATION TREATMENTS (2-3\%). THE AVERAGE STRENGTH OF P. PAUCIFLORA PYRENES BURIED IN SOIL SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED OVER TWO YEARS, FROM 413.3 +/- 14.6 N TO 130.8 +/- 11.8 N.

DEV.,"THE PHARYNGEAL PLATE IS A MORPHOLOGICAL COMPLEX WITH EXTENSIVE ANATOMICAL VARIATION AMONG BEES AND, THEREFORE, POTENTIAL AS A SOURCE OF PHYLOGENETIC INFORMATION. THE PHARYNGEAL PLATE OF BEES IS DIVIDED INTO FOUR MORPHOLOGICALLY DISTINCT REGIONS: SITOPHORE, HYPOPHARYNGEAL LOBE, PHARYNGEAL RODS, AND MEDIAN ORAL PLATE. IN THIS WORK WE ILLUSTRATE AND DOCUMENT IN DETAIL FOR THE FIRST TIME THE PHARYNGEAL PLATE OF 43 BEE SPECIES, PROVIDING DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION AND CONTRASTING THESE FINDINGS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF APOID WASPS (CRABRONIDAE AND SPHECIDAE). WE EVALUATE AND DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL OF THIS STRUCTURE AS A RICH SOURCE OF MORPHOLOGICAL INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF BEE PHYLOGENY AND ANY RESEARCH POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY COMPARATIVE MORPHOLOGICAL DATA. THE SHAPE OF THE HYPOPHARYNGEAL LOBE IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AMONG SUPRAGENERIC TAXA OF BEES AND CAN BE READILY EMPLOYED TO CHARACTERISE TAXA AT VARIOUS LEVELS. WE ARGUE THAT THE GLOBAL PATTERNS IN THE VARIATION OF THE PHARYNGEAL PLATE CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR PHYLOGENETIC INFERENCE WITHIN BEES AND CONSTRUCTED AND CODED 10 CHARACTERS THAT ENCOMPASS THE MOST NOTICEABLE MORPHOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES DISCUSSED HEREIN.

BEES FORAGING ON THE POLLEN OF THE TWO PLANTS HAVE SHAPED THE DISTINCT PROTEOME ARSENALS IN THE ANTENNA AND BRAIN TO DRIVE OLFACTORY AND BRAIN FUNCTION. IN ANTENNAE, BEES FORAGING ON PEAR (PA) POLLEN PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH PROTEIN METABOLISM WERE INDUCED TO SYNTHESIZE NEW PROTEINS FOR MODULATION OF SYNAPTIC STRUCTURES VIA STABILIZING AND CONSOLIDATING SPECIFIC MEMORY TRACES. WHEREAS, BEES FORAGING ON RAPESEED (BA) POLLEN PATHWAYS IMPLICATED IN ENERGY METABOLISM WERE ACTIVATED TO PROVIDE METABOLIC FUELS CRITICAL FOR NEURAL ACTIVITY. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE DISTINCT BIOCHEMICAL ROUTE IS FUNCTIONALLY ENHANCED TO CONSOLIDATE THE DIVERGENT OLFACTION IN PA AND BA. IN BRAIN, ALTHOUGH THE UNIQUELY INDUCED PATHWAYS IN BEES FORGING ON BOTH PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO CEMENT SELECTIVE ROLES IN LEARNING AND MEMORY, POLLEN FORAGING PREFERENCE IN BEES IS MAINLY DRIVED BY OLFACTION. FURTHERMORE, BOTH PLANTS HAVE SHAPED DIFFERENT REPERTOIRES OF SIGNAL ODORS AND FOOD REWARDS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS.

THE JUVENILE HORMONE, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HORMONES IN THE POST-EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT OF INSECTS, ATTRACTS THE MOST ATTENTION IN THE CONTEXT OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION. ALLATOREGULATORY NEUROPEPTIDES (ALLATOTROPIN, ALLATOSTATIN-A AND ALLATOSTATIN-C) ARE KNOWN TO REGULATE JUVENILE HORMONE SYNTHESIS AND RELEASE IN INSECTS. IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE TRANSITIONS OF JUVENILE HORMONE SYNTHESIS INVOLVED IN EUSOCIAL EVOLUTION, THE SUBSTITUTIONS OF AMINO ACID RESIDUES AND THE COMPLEXITY OF POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS IN ALLATOREGULATORY NEURO-PEPTIDE RECEPTORS WERE CHARACTERIZED. BOTH ALLATOTROPIN AND ALLATOSTATIN RECEPTORS ARE IDENTIFIED IN ALL EXAMINED BEE SPECIES REGARDLESS IF THEY ARE SOLITARY OR EUSOCIAL.

PREVIOUS WORK SUGGESTED THAT POPULATIONS ARE WELL ADAPTED TO THE LOCAL RELIABILITY OF POLLINATION BY APID AND MEGACHILID BEES. WE TESTED WHETHER VARIATION IN THE INTENSITY OF PREDISPERSAL SEED PREDATION BY SEED WEEVILS IN THE GENUS NANOBARIS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE OBSERVED VARIATION IN BLOSSOM TRAITS. METHODS WE STUDIED SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT AND THE PROBABILITY OF SEED PREDATION WITHIN THREE FOCAL POPULATIONS. THEN WE ASSESSED AMONG-POPULATION COVARIATION OF PREDATION RATE, POLLINATION RELIABILITY, MATING SYSTEM, AND BLOSSOM TRAITS ACROSS 20 POPULATIONS. KEY RESULTS THE PROBABILITY OF SEED PREDATION WAS LARGELY UNRELATED TO VARIATION IN FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT BOTH WITHIN FOCAL POPULATIONS AND AMONG THE LARGER SAMPLE OF POPULATIONS. THE RATE OF SEED PREDATION WAS ONLY WEAKLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATE OF CROSS-POLLINATION (ALLOGAMY) IN EACH POPULATION BUT TENDED TO BE PROPORTIONALLY GREATER IN POPULATIONS EXPERIENCING LESS RELIABLE POLLINATION. CONCLUSIONS THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE INTENSITY OF ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS HAVE HAD ONLY MINOR MODIFYING EFFECTS ON THE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORIES OF FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT IN PLANT POPULATIONS IN THIS SYSTEM.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"BOTH WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS SIGNIFICANTLY CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION BY PROVIDING POLLINATION SERVICES TO CROPS. COLONIES OF COMMERCIALLY-REARED HONEY BEES AND BUMBLEBEES ARE TWO OF THE LARGEST GROUPS OF MANAGED POLLINATORS. BUMBLEBEES IN PARTICULAR ARE INCREASINGLY USED ON SOFT FRUIT CROPS, SUCH AS STRAWBERRY, AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CROP GLOBALLY. DESPITE THE USE OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES IN STRAWBERRY CROPS, THERE IS LITTLE QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY PROVIDE A BENEFIT TO FARMERS. GIVEN THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT COMMERCIAL COLONIES CAN HAVE ON WILD BEE POPULATIONS, IT IS VITAL THAT THE BENEFITS OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES ARE QUANTIFIED, SO REASONED MANAGEMENT DECISIONS CAN BE MADE THAT PROVIDE MAXIMUM BENEFIT TO BOTH FARMERS AND WILD BEES. IN THIS STUDY, COMMERCIAL COLONIES OF THE UK NATIVE SUBSPECIES BOMBUS TERRESTRIS AUDAX WERE PLACED INTO JUNE-BEARER (FLOWERING MARCH-APRIL, VARIETIES `MALLING CENTENARY' AND `FLAIR') AND EVERBEARER (FLOWERING MAY-JUNE) STRAWBERRY POLYTUNNELS ON A SOFT-FRUIT FARM IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ENGLAND, AND OPENED AND CLOSED AT WEEKLY INTERVALS. THE FLOWER-VISITING ASSEMBLAGE INSIDE POLYTUNNELS WAS QUANTIFIED, AND FRUIT WAS HARVESTED AND QUALITY ASSESSED. IN THE JUNE-BEARER VARIETY MALLING CENTENARY, THE PRESENCE OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF HIGH COMMERCIAL GRADE FRUIT BY 25\%. IN CONTRAST, NO BENEFIT OF COMMERCIAL BEES ON POLLINATION OR FRUIT QUALITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE JUNE-BEARER VARIETY FLAIR AND THE EVERBEARER CROP. THE INCREASE IN QUALITY OF FRUIT IN THE MALLING CENTENARY CROP MAY BE DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER B. TERRESTRIS AUDAX FLOWER VISITATION RATES SEEN IN THIS CROP IN COMBINATION WITH VARIETAL DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION DEPENDENCY. THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS BY WILD POLLINATORS WAS NOT A WELL-SUPPORTED PREDICTOR OF STRAWBERRY QUALITY, THUS THE BENEFIT THEY PROVIDE IN THIS SYSTEM REMAINS TO BE ELUCIDATED. THE RESULTS PRESENTED HERE SUGGEST THAT COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES CAN GREATLY INCREASE THE QUALITY AND SUBSEQUENT VALUE OF A STRAWBERRY CROP, WHEN DEPLOYED ON A SUITABLE VARIETY AT A TIME WHEN WILD POLLINATOR NUMBERS ARE LOW. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS ALSO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY THAT COMMERCIAL COLONIES DO NOT ALWAYS PROVIDE THE BENEFITS TO STRAWBERRY CROPS THAT THEY ARE THOUGHT TO. FOR GROWERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEE USE, FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED INTO THE EFFECT OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLEBEES ON THE MAJOR STRAWBERRY VARIETIES, IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND SEASONS.

ENVIRON.,"IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATING INSECTS COMMERCIAL STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA X ANANASSA) YIELDS WOULD FALL BY APPROXIMATELY 45\%, WHILE DAMAGE FROM APHIDS IS ESTIMATED TO COST GROWERS AT LEAST 1\% OF ANNUAL YIELDS IN THE UK ALONE. THIS COMBINED EFFECT COULD RESULT IN LOSSES OF OVER 100 MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE UK ECONOMY. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER INCORPORATING FLORAL RESOURCES WITHIN COMMERCIAL POLYTHENE-CLAD TUNNELS COULD IMPROVE POLLINATION SERVICES AND APHID CONTROL AND, HENCE, STRAWBERRY FRUIT QUALITY. IN A RANDOMISED BLOCK EXPERIMENT (USING 3 X 6 M PLOTS), CORIANDER (CORIANDRUM SATIVUM) FIELD FORGET-ME-NOT (MYOSOTIS ARVENSIS) AND CORN MINT (MENTHA ARVENSIS) PLANTS WERE INSERTED IN ROWS OF COMMERCIALLY-GROWN STRAWBERRIES. THEIR EFFECT ON NUMBERS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING FLOWER VISITORS, APHIDS AND APHID PREDATORS WAS COMPARED. COUNTS OF FLOWER VISITORS, INCLUDING VISITORS TO SOWN FLOWER SPECIES, WERE HIGHER IN CORIANDER AND MINT PLOTS. HOWEVER STRAWBERRY FLOWERS RECEIVED MORE INSECT VISITS IN CONTROL PLOTS. FRUIT FROM FORGET-ME-NOT PLOTS WERE LOWER IN SUGAR THAN FRUIT FROM CONTROLS, WHILE FRUIT FROM MINT PLOTS HAD FEWER FERTILISED SEEDS THAN FRUIT FROM CONTROL PLOTS. STRAWBERRIES FROM CORIANDER PLOTS DID NOT DIFFER FROM CONTROL FRUIT ON ANY FRUIT QUALITY MEASURES. CRUCIALLY, PROPORTIONS OF MARKETABLE FRUIT DID NOT DIFFER ACROSS TREATMENTS. APHID NUMBERS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN TREATMENTS EVEN THOUGH CORIANDER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBERS OF LACEWING EGGS LAID ON APHID-INFESTED STRAWBERRY PLANTS IN CORIANDER PLOTS. HENCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROPORTIONS OF MARKETABLE FRUITS WITH INTERCROPPING, THE BENEFITS RECEIVED WERE LIMITED.

ECOL.,"EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF ANNUAL EUSOCIAL INSECTS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES REPORT CONTRASTING FINDINGS WITH REGARD TO COLONY RESPONSES TO MASS-FLOWERING OF CROPS SUCH AS OILSEED RAPE. IN PARTICULAR, TOTAL SEXUAL PRODUCTION IS OFTEN UNAFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS, WHEREAS WORKER NUMBER RESPONDS WITH A PROMINENT INCREASE. TO RESOLVE THESE CONFLICTING OBSERVATIONS, WE MODEL-USING AN ESTABLISHED APPROACH-THE EXPECTED CHANGE IN WORKER AND SEXUAL NUMBERS IN RESPONSE TO AN INCREASED WORKER PRODUCTIVITY INDUCED BY MASS-FLOWERING EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE SEASON. WE FIND THAT THE PREDICTED RESPONSE PATTERN IS MAINLY SHAPED BY THE DEGREE TO WHICH INDIVIDUAL WORKER PRODUCTIVITY IS REDUCED BY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF WORKERS IN THE COLONY. DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND COLONY CHARACTERISTICS RESULT IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF INTERFERENCE OF WORKERS, FOR EXAMPLE, DURING FORAGING OR NEST CONSTRUCTION. REDUCTION IN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTIVITY IS LOW, WHEN WORKER INTERFERENCE IS NEGLIGIBLE (WEAK LIMITATION) AND HIGH WHEN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF WORKERS SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASES PER-CAPITA EFFICIENCY (STRONG LIMITATION). FOR WEAK LIMITATION, ANY MASS-FLOWERING EVENT THAT ENDS BEFORE THE PRODUCTION OF SEXUALS STARTS HAS A STRONG MULTIPLICATIVE IMPACT ON BOTH WORKER AND SEXUAL NUMBERS. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT IS QUITE INDEPENDENT OF THE PRECISE TIMING OF SUCH AN EVENT. AFTER THE ONSET OF SEXUAL PRODUCTION, MASS-FLOWERING HAS A WEAKER EFFECT, AS THE ADDED RESOURCE SUPPLY IS ONLY LINEARLY TRANSFERRED INTO PRODUCTION OF ADDITIONAL SEXUALS. FOR COLONIES UNDER STRONG LIMITATION, THE PREDICTED IMPACT OF MASS-FLOWERING EVENTS IS GENERALLY WEAKER, ESPECIALLY ON THE PRODUCTION OF SEXUALS, AND THE TIMING OF MASS-FLOWERING EVENTS BECOMES MORE INFLUENTIAL: PRODUCTION OF SEXUALS PROFITS MORE FROM LATE THAN FROM EARLY MASS-FLOWERING EVENTS. CONSEQUENTLY, EARLY MASS-FLOWERING EVENTS ARE PREDICTED TO HAVE A PROMINENT EFFECT ON WORKER NUMBERS BUT A NEGLIGIBLE ONE ON THE OUTPUT OF SEXUALS. THE MODEL PRESENTED PROVIDES A MECHANISTIC EXPLANATION OF WHY INCREASED WORKER ABUNDANCES DO NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO INCREASED PRODUCTION OF SEXUALS.

MOST STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING FOCUS ON SPECIES RICHNESS, PREDOMINANTLY WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF PRODUCTIVITY-RELATED FUNCTIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE IS LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW OTHER BIODIVERSITY MEASURES, SUCH AS SPECIES EVENNESS (THE DISTRIBUTION OF ABUNDANCE AMONG SPECIES), AFFECT COMPLEX MULTITROPHIC FUNCTIONS SUCH AS POLLINATION. WE EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF SPECIES EVENNESS ON THE ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION OF POLLINATION USING A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT WITH SELECTED PLANTS AND INSECTS IN FLIGHT CAGES. WE MANIPULATED THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF PLANT AND POLLINATOR SPECIES, WHILE HOLDING SPECIES RICHNESS, COMPOSITION, DOMINANCE ORDER, AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE CONSTANT. THEN, WE TESTED HOW NUMERICAL SPECIES EVENNESS AFFECTED NETWORK STRUCTURE AND CONSEQUENTLY, SEED PRODUCTION, IN OUR ARTIFICIAL COMMUNITIES. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION, NUMERICAL DOMINANCE IN PLANT COMMUNITIES INCREASED COMPLEMENTARITY IN POLLINATOR USE (REDUCED POLLINATOR SHARING) AMONG PLANT SPECIES. AS PREDICTED BY THEORY, THIS INCREASED COMPLEMENTARITY RESULTED IN HIGHER SEED PRODUCTION FOR THE MOST DOMINANT AND RARE PLANT SPECIES IN OUR CAGES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT IN A CONTROLLED EXPERIENTIAL SETTING, NUMERICAL SPECIES EVENNESS CAN ALTER IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS AND PLANT REPRODUCTION, IRRESPECTIVE OF SPECIES RICHNESS, COMPOSITION, AND TOTAL ABUNDANCE.

TRAIT-BASED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL MODELS OFFER A POTENTIAL SOLUTION BUT HAVE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR WITHIN-SPECIES TRAIT VARIATION OR BETWEEN-SPECIES TRAIT OVERLAP. HERE WE PROPOSE AND STUDY TRAIT-BASED MODELS WITH HOST AND VECTOR COMMUNITIES REPRESENTED AS TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS WITHOUT REGARD TO SPECIES IDENTITY. TO ILLUSTRATE THIS APPROACH, WE DEVELOP SUSCEPTIBLE-INFECTIOUS-SUSCEPTIBLE MODELS FOR DISEASE SPREAD IN PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS WITH CONTINUOUS TRAIT DISTRIBUTIONS. WE MODEL TRAIT-DEPENDENT CONTACT RATES IN TWO COMMON SCENARIOS: NESTED NETWORKS AND SPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS BASED ON TRAIT MATCHING. WE FIND THAT DISEASE SPREAD IN PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS IS IMPACTED THE MOST BY SELECTIVE POLLINATORS, UNIVERSALLY ATTRACTIVE FLOWERS, AND COSPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR PAIRS. WHEN EXTREME POLLINATOR TRAITS ARE RARE, POLLINATORS WITH COMMON TRAITS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR DISEASE SPREAD, WHEREAS WHEN EXTREME FLOWER TRAITS ARE RARE, FLOWERS WITH UNCOMMON TRAITS IMPACT DISEASE SPREAD THE MOST.

A MONETARY AND A NON-MONETARY APPROACHES WERE COMBINED TO EVALUATE THE POLLINATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY TWO BRAZILIAN PROTECTED AREAS (PAS) IN NORTHERN (SERRA DA BOCAINA, PARA) AND SOUTHEASTERN REGION (MATA DO JAMBREIRO, MINAS GERAIS) WITHIN THE AMAZON FOREST AND ATLANTIC FOREST BIOMES, RESPECTIVELY. THE MONETARY VALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS BASED ON THE ROLE OF POLLINATION FOR CROP PRODUCTION IN THE MUNICIPALITIES SURROUNDING THE PAS, AND THE NON-MONETARY INVOLVED ESTIMATING THE AREAS WITH WIDER RANGE OF RESOURCES FOR SUSTAINING POLLINATORS. IN SERRA DA BOCAINA, THE TOTAL ANNUAL MONETARY VALUE OF THE POLLINATION SERVICES PERFORMED BY BEE SPECIES WAS ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY 564,000 DOLLARS AND IN MATA DO JAMBREIRO, 246,000 DOLLARS, BOTH FOR 2016. THE NON-MONETARY VALUATION HIGHLIGHTED THE PAS AND THEIR SURROUNDING AREAS WITH DENSER PLANT COVERAGE. THE METHODS USED IN THIS STUDY ALLOWED US TO EVALUATE AND INTEGRATE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INFORMATION: BEE DIVERSITY DATA, THE SPATIAL DATA OF THE PAS AND THEIR SURROUNDINGS, AND THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION OF THE NEIGHBOURING MUNICIPALITIES. THE RESULTS CAN BE APPLIED IN MANAGEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY STUDIES AIMING TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PAS AND THEIR VALUE AND IMPORTANCE FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.

ALTHOUGH POLLINATORS OFTEN FORAGE AT DIFFERENT SITES IN RESPONSE TO SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN FLORAL RESOURCES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR FORAGING BETWEEN URBAN AND NEARBY NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. WE MONITORED THE FORAGING PATTERNS OF BUMBLEBEES IN OPEN AND FOREST HABITATS IN TWO AREAS WITH AND WITHOUT URBAN GARDENS WITH RESPECT TO FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN EACH HABITAT. FLORAL RICHNESS IN THE FOREST HABITAT DECREASED AS THE SEASON PROGRESSED, WITH A PEAK IN LATE SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER, WHEREAS FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE OPEN HABITAT INCREASED LATE IN THE SEASON. THUS, FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE OPEN HABITAT COULD COMPENSATE FOR SEASONAL DECLINES IN FOREST FLORAL RESOURCES. IN THE URBAN AREA, WHICH CONTAINED GREEN GARDENS, FLORAL RICHNESS IN THE OPEN HABITAT WAS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT IN THE FOREST HABITAT. THIS RESULTED IN A RELATIVELY HIGH DENSITY OF BUMBLEBEES IN THE OPEN HABITAT IN THE URBAN AREA COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE NATURAL AREA, WHICH LACKED GREEN GARDENS. VISITATION FREQUENCY OF BUMBLEBEES TO FOREST FLOWERS DECREASED AS THE FLORAL RICHNESS OF THE OPEN HABITAT INCREASED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH URBAN GARDENS ARE IMPORTANT FORAGING SITES FOR POLLINATORS, THE HIGH ATTRACTIVENESS OF GARDEN FLOWERS REDUCES POLLINATOR VISITS TO WILDFLOWERS IN NEARBY FORESTS.

NEONICOTINOIDS ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS INCREASE, REPRESENTING BETWEEN 61 TO NEARLY 99 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL TOXICITY LOADING IN 2014. THE CROPS MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCREASE IN AITL ARE CORN AND SOYBEANS, WITH PARTICULARLY LARGE INCREASES IN RELATIVE SOYBEAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO AITL BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014. ORAL EXPOSURES ARE OF POTENTIALLY GREATER CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE RELATIVELY HIGHER TOXICITY (LOW LD(50)S) AND GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF EXPOSURE FROM RESIDUES IN POLLEN, NECTAR, GUTTATION WATER, AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MEDIA. USING AITL TO ASSESS ORAL TOXICITY BY CLASS OF PESTICIDE, THE NEONICOTINOIDS ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY 92 PERCENT OF TOTAL AITL FROM 1992 TO 2014. CHLORPYRIFOS, THE FIFTH MOST WIDELY USED INSECTICIDE DURING THIS TIME CONTRIBUTED JUST 1.4 PERCENT OF TOTAL AITL BASED ON ORAL LD(50)S. ALTHOUGH WE USE SOME SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS, OUR SCREENING ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES AN INCREASE IN PESTICIDE TOXICITY LOADING OVER THE PAST 26 YEARS, WHICH POTENTIALLY THREATENS THE HEALTH OF HONEY BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO DECLINES IN BENEFICIAL INSECT POPULATIONS AS WELL AS INSECTIVOROUS BIRDS AND OTHER INSECT CONSUMERS.",NA,NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; SEED TREATMENTS; TREATED SEEDS; SOYBEAN APHID; HONEY-BEES; EXPOSURE; CONTAMINATION; POLLINATORS; MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"DIBARTOLOMEIS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), TOXICOL RES INT, HAIKU, HI 96708 USA.;DIBARTOLOMEIS, MICHAEL, KEGLEY, SUSAN, TOXICOL RES INT, HAIKU, HI 96708 USA.;RADFORD, ROSEMARIE, PESTICIDE RES INST INC, SANTA ROSA, CA USA.;MINEAU, PIERRE, CARLETON UNIV, DEPT BIOL, OTTAWA, ON, CANADA.;KLEIN, KENDRA, FRIENDS EARTH US, BERKELEY, CA USA.",10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0220029,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",E0220029,FRIENDS OF THE EARTH U.S. (FOE),"THIS STUDY WAS FUNDED BY FRIENDS OF THE EARTH U.S. (FOE).

NOOTEN SS;REHAN SM,NOOTEN SS,AGRICULTURAL LAND USE YIELDS REDUCED FORAGING EFFICIENCY AND UNVIABLE OFFSPRING IN THE WILD BEE CERATINA CALCARATA,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,ECOL. ENTOMOL.,"1. AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION GENERALLY LEADS TO LARGE-SCALE HABITAT CHANGES MARKED BY DECREASING AVAILABILITY OF NESTING SITES AND FLOWER RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW SUCH CHANGES IMPACT WILD BEE MATERNAL BODY SIZE AND FORAGING EFFORT AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHETHER THERE IS A SUBSEQUENT EFFECT ON THEIR OFFSPRING. 2. NESTS WERE COLLECTED FROM THE COMMON EASTERN NORTH AMERICAN STEM NESTING BEE, CERATINA CALCARATA, ACROSS THREE LAND MANAGEMENT TYPES: (I) INTENSELY MANAGED CONVENTIONAL FARMS, (II) MODERATELY DISTURBED ORGANIC FARMLAND, AND (III) LEAST MANAGED ROADSIDES. THE STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF LAND USE TYPES ON BODY SIZE AND WING WEAR (A PROXY FOR FORAGING EFFORT) OF MATERNAL BEES, AND ON THEIR OFFSPRING IN TERMS OF CLUTCH SIZE, SURVIVAL, SEX RATIO AND BODY SIZE. 3. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT MORE BROOD REACHED PUPAL STAGES FROM NESTS COLLECTED IN CONVENTIONAL FARMLANDS. THIS WAS DUE TO THE TOTAL LACK OF PARASITES, POSSIBLY BECAUSE THE HOST DENSITY IS BELOW THE THRESHOLD THAT CAN SUPPORT A BROOD PARASITE POPULATION IN INTENSIVELY FARMED LANDSCAPES. A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL BEE SIZE AND CLUTCH SIZE WAS ONLY FOUND IN LEAST MANAGED ROADSIDES, WHILE, IN BOTH FARM TYPES, BODY SIZES FOR DAUGHTERS AND SONS WERE SMALLER, BARELY REACHING THE PREDICTED OVERWINTERING THRESHOLD. 4. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIFIED AGRICULTURAL LAND USE WILL BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN BEE OFFSPRING, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO DECREASED FITNESS FOR SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS.
