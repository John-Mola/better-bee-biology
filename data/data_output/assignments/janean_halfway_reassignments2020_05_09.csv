PETANIDOU T;VOKOU D,PETANIDOU T,POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF LABIATAE IN A PHRYGANIC (EAST MEDITERRANEAN) ECOSYSTEM,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,AM. J. BOT.,"THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A PHRYGANIC (EAST MEDITERRANEAN) ECOSYSTEM AT DAPHNI, NEAR ATHENS, GREECE. THE LABIATAE, REPRESENTED BY TEN SPECIES BELONGING TO NINE GENERA, DOMINATE IN THIS ECOSYSTEM TYPE. THEY FLOWER FROM FEBRUARY TO JULY. BOTH FLOWERING TIME AND NECTAR QUANTITY ARE RELATED TO THE SPECIES ABILITY TO TOLERATE INTENSE WATER STRESS. LABIATAE ARE VISITED BY 201 INSECT SPECIES. OF THESE, 43 ARE EXCLUSIVELY SUPPORTED BY THE FAMILY AND 37 ARE MONOTROPOUS. SOLITARY BEES (MAINLY ANTHOPHORIDAE, MEGACHILIDAE, HALICTIDAE) CONSTITUTE 47.3\% OF POLLINATORS. THE FAMILY IS IMPORTANT IN HOSTING SPECIALIZED BEES (15 SPECIES) IN PHRYGANA, PARTICULARLY LATE IN THE FLOWERING SEASON. LABIATAE SPECIES FORM TWO EQUALLY REPRESENTED GROUPS IN THIS SYSTEM, NAMELY, THE LATE WINTER-EARLY SPRING (EARLY) FLOWERING, VISITED BY RELATIVELY FEW POLLINATOR SPECIES, AND THE LATE SPRING-SUMMER (LATE) FLOWERING SPECIES, VISITED BY NUMEROUS POLLINATORS. THIS TEMPORAL DISTINCTION IS ACCOMPANIED BY DIFFERENT POLLINATION PROFILES THAT INCLUDE DURATION OF ANTHESIS, REWARD TO POLLINATORS, FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS, AND FLOWER CHARACTER DIFFERENTIATION. ALL OF THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE MAXIMIZED IN THE EARLY FLOWERING PERIOD. THIS STRATEGY SUGGESTS A MECHANISM FOR RESOURCE PARTITIONING AT A TIME WHEN THE POLLINATOR RESOURCE IS LIMITED AND COMPETITION FOR THE SERVICES OF POLLINATORS IS EXPECTED TO BE INTENSE. CONTRARY TO THE CURRENT THEORY CONCERNING CORNUCOPIAN SPECIES, THE COPIOUSLY REWARDING FLOWERS OF LABIATAE IN PHRYGANA ARE NOT THOSE ABUNDANTLY SERVICED BY POLLINATORS.",NA,BEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,41,"ARISTOTELIAN UNIV SALONIKA,SCH BIOL,DEPT ECOL,UPB 119,GR-54006 SALONIKA,GREECE.",10.2307/2445509,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210",NA,NA,0002-9122,8,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,80,1993,ISIA1993LU94500006,29,PLANT SCIENCES,28,PLANT SCIENCES,NA,LU945,"ARISTOTELIAN UNIV SALONIKA,SCH BIOL,DEPT ECOL,UPB 119,GR-54006 SALONIKA,GREECE",ISI,none,ARISTOTELIAN UNIV SALONIKA,ARISTOTELIAN UNIV SALONIKA,NA,"PETANIDOU T, 1993, AM J BOT","PETANIDOU T, 1993, AM J BOT",NA,NA,NA,ana

THE ANSWER HINGES ON CHARACTERIZING THE VALUE OF NATURE, A TRICKY BUSINESS FROM BIOPHYSICAL, SOCIOECONOMIC, AND ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES. ALTHOUGH THE SOCIETAL BENEFITS OF NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS ARE CLEARLY IMMENSE,THEY REMAIN LARGELY UNQUANTIFIED FOR ALL BUT A FEW SERVICES. HERE, WE ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF TROPICAL FOREST IN SUPPLYING POLLINATION SERVICES TO AGRICULTURE. WE FOCUS ON COFFEE BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE EXPORT COMMODITIES AND IS GROWN IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S MOST BIODIVERSE REGIONS. USING POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS ALONG REPLICATED DISTANCE GRADIENTS, WE FOUND THAT FOREST-BASED POLLINATORS INCREASED COFFEE YIELDS BY 20\% WITHIN APPROXIMATE TO1 KM OF FOREST. POLLINATION ALSO IMPROVED COFFEE QUALITY NEAR FOREST BY REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF ``PEABERRIES (I.E., SMALL MISSHAPEN SEEDS) BY 27\%.

BOT.,"THE POLLINATORS OF 29 GINGER SPECIES REPRESENTING 11 GENERA IN RELATION TO CERTAIN FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A MIXED-DIPTEROCARP FOREST IN BORNEO WERE INVESTIGATED. AMONG THE 29 SPECIES STUDIED, EIGHT WERE POLLINATED BY SPIDERHUNTERS (NECTARINIIDAE), 11 BY MEDIUM-SIZED AMEGILLA BEES (ANTHOPHORIDAE), AND TEN BY SMALL HALICTID BEES. THESE POLLINATION GUILDS FOUND IN GINGERS IN SARAWAK ARE COMPARABLE TO THE POLLINATION GUILDS OF NEOTROPICAL ZINGIBERALES, I.E., HUMMINGBIRD, AND EUGLOSSINE-BEE-POLLINATED GUILDS. CANONICAL DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATION GUILDS AND SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. MOST SPECIES IN THE THREE GUILDS WERE SEPARATED ON THE PLOT BY THE FIRST AND SECOND CANONICAL VARIABLES. SPIDERHUNTER-POLLINATED FLOWERS HAD LONGER FLORAL TUBES, WHILE AMEGILLA-POLLINATED FLOWERS HAD WIDER LIPS THAN THE OTHERS, WHICH FUNCTION AS A PLATFORM FOR THE POLLINATORS. PISTILS AND STAMENS OF HALICTID-POLLINATED FLOWERS WERE SMALLER THAN THE OTHERS. THE FACT THAT GINGERS WITH DIVERSE MORPHOLOGIES IN A FOREST WITH HIGH SPECIES DIVERSITY WERE GROUPED INTO ONLY THREE POLLINATION GUILDS AND THAT THE POLLINATORS THEMSELVES SHOWED LOW SPECIES DIVERSITY SUGGESTS THAT MANY SPECIES OF RARE UNDERSTORY PLANTS HAVE EVOLVED WITHOUT SEGREGATING POLLINATORS IN EACH POLLINATION GUILD.",BEE; COEVOLUTION; COSTACEAE; FLORAL MORPHOLOGY; POLLINATION GUILD; SARAWAK; SPIDERHUNTER; ZINGIBERACEAE,HERMAPHRODITIC PLANT; EUGLOSSINE BEES; SELECTION; BIOLOGY; FOREST; COMPONENTS; ECOLOGY; TRAITS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,50,"SAKAI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, CTR ECOL RES, SAKYO, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.;KYOTO UNIV, CTR ECOL RES, SAKYO, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.;KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH HUMAN \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, SAKYO, KYOTO 6068501, JAPAN.",10.2307/2656573,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA",NA,NA,0002-9122,5,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,86,1999,ISI000080411600005,41,PLANT SCIENCES,14,PLANT SCIENCES,NA,198FG,"SAKAI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, CTR ECOL RES, SAKYO, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN",ISI,none,KYOTO UNIV;KYOTO UNIV,KYOTO UNIV,NA,"SAKAI S, 1999, AM J BOT","SAKAI S, 1999, AM J BOT",NA,NA,NA,john m

IN CONTRAST, OUR ANALYSIS OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION (FAO) [11] DATA REVEALS THAT THE GLOBAL POPULATION OF MANAGED HONEY-BEE HIVES HAS INCREASED SIMILAR TO 45\% DURING THE LAST HALF CENTURY AND SUGGESTS THAT ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION, RATHER THAN BIOLOGICAL FACTORS, DRIVES BOTH THE DYNAMICS OF THE GLOBAL MANAGED HONEY-BEE POPULATION AND INCREASING DEMANDS FOR AGRICULTURAL POLLINATION SERVICES [12]. NEVERTHELESS, AVAILABLE DATA ALSO REVEAL A MUCH MORE RAPID (>300\%) INCREASE IN THE FRACTION OF AGRICULTURE THAT DEPENDS ON ANIMAL POLLINATION DURING THE LAST HALF CENTURY, WHICH MAY BE STRESSING GLOBAL POLLINATION CAPACITY. ALTHOUGH THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE ACCELERATING INCREASE OF THE POLLINATOR DEPENDENCE OF COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE SEEMS TO BE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AND NOT BIOLOGICAL, THE RAPID EXPANSION OF CULTIVATION OF MANY POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT CROPS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRIGGER FUTURE POLLINATION PROBLEMS FOR BOTH THESE CROPS AND NATIVE SPECIES IN NEIGHBORING AREAS.

SMITHSON A;MACNAIR MR,SMITHSON A,NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION BY POLLINATORS ON ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITHOUT REWARDS,EVOLUTION,EVOLUTION,"MANY SPECIES OF NONMODEL DECEPTIVELY POLLINATED ORCHIDS ARE POLYMORPHIC FOR COROLLA COLOR THESE SPECIES ARE POLLINATED BY NAIVE INSECTS SEARCHING FOR NECTAR, AND ARE NOT MIMICS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF INSECT POLLINATORS DURING THE AVOIDANCE LEARNING PROCESS RESULTS IN THESE STABLE COROLLA COLOR POLYMORPHISMS, FOR THIS TO OCCUR POLLINATORS MUST INDUCE NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION ON COROLLA COLOR. THEREFORE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR RESULTS IN A PREFERENCE FOR RARE COLOR MORPHS OF DECEPTIVE SPECIES WAS TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY. BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) FORAGED IN THE LABORATORY ON ARRAYS OF ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITH DIFFERENT COROLLA COLOR MORPHS. MORPHS WERE VARIED IN FREQUENCY, AND BUMBLEBEE PREFERENCES WERE RECORDED ON ARRAYS WHERE MORPHS DID AND DID NOT CONTAIN SUCROSE SOLUTION REWARDS. BUMBLEBEES PREFERRED THE MOST COMMON COLOR MORPH WHEN FLOWERS CONTAINED SUCROSE SOLUTION REWARDS, BUT OVERVISITED RARE MORPHS WHEN SAMPLING DOWERS THAT CONTAINED NO REWARDS. BUMBLEBEES ALSO TENDED TO MOVE BETWEEN UNLIKE COLOR MORPHS WHEN THESE WERE UNREWARDING, SUGGESTING THAT A PROBABILISTIC SAMPLING STRATEGY WAS ADOPTED. THUS EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR COULD RESULT IN A SELECTIVE ADVANTAGE FOR RARE COLOR MORPHS OF PLANT SPECIES THAT ARE POLLINATED BY DECEPTION WITHOUT MIMICRY, WHICH WOULD INDUCE NEGATIVE FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION ON COROLLA COLOR. THE OBSERVED POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR COULD ALLOW STABLE COROLLA COLOR POLYMORPHISMS TO BE MAINTAINED BY SELECTION IN NONMODEL DECEPTIVELY POLLINATED SPECIES.",BOMBUS TERRESTRIS; DECEPTIVE POLLINATION; DISASSORTATIVE MATING; ORCHIDS; SAMPLING BEHAVIOR,BUMBLE BEES; NATURAL-SELECTION; SEARCH IMAGE; COLOR; ORCHIDACEAE; PREDATORS; POLYMORPHISM; POPULATIONS; PATTERNS; MIMICRY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,104,"SMITHSON, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV EXETER, DEPT BIOL SCI, HATHERLY LABS, PRINCE WALES RD, EXETER EX4 4PS, DEVON, ENGLAND.",10.1111/J.1558-5646.1997.TB03655.X,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,0014-3820,3,WILEY,51,1997,ISIA1997XM06500006,49,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, GENETICS \& HEREDITY",63,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, GENETICS \& HEREDITY",NA,XM065,"SMITHSON, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV EXETER, DEPT BIOL SCI, HATHERLY LABS, PRINCE WALES RD, EXETER EX4 4PS, DEVON, ENGLAND",ISI,none,NA,UNIV EXETER,NA,"SMITHSON A, 1997, EVOLUTION","SMITHSON A, 1997, EVOLUTION",NA,NA,NA,tien l

RES.,"THE DECLINE OF BEES HAS RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING THEIR CONSERVATION AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO BEE-POLLINATED WILD FLOWERS AND CROPS. ALTHOUGH THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION IS A HOTSPOT FOR BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, THEIR STATUS REMAINS POORLY STUDIED. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE, AND UNBIASED SAMPLING METHODS THAT GIVE GOOD BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ESTIMATES. THIS STUDY AIMS: (A) TO ASSESS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS IN TWO COMMON MEDITERRANEAN HABITAT TYPES: SEMI-NATURAL SCRUB (PHRYGANA) AND MANAGED OLIVE GROVES, (B) TO COMPARE SPECIES RICHNESS IN THOSE SYSTEMS TO THAT OF OTHER BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, AND (C) TO ASSESS WHETHER SIX DIFFERENT SAMPLING METHODS (PAN TRAPS, VARIABLE AND STANDARDIZED TRANSECT WALKS, OBSERVATION PLOTS AND TRAP NESTS), PREVIOUSLY TESTED IN OTHER EUROPEAN BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ARE SUITABLE IN MEDITERRANEAN COMMUNITIES. EIGHT STUDY SITES, FOUR PER HABITAT TYPE, WERE SELECTED ON THE ISLAND OF LESVOS, GREECE. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OBSERVED WAS HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER HABITAT TYPES WORLDWIDE FOR WHICH COMPARABLE DATA EXIST. PAN TRAPS COLLECTED THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ACROSS ALL METHODS AT THE SCALE OF A STUDY SITE. VARIABLE AND STANDARDIZED TRANSECT WALKS DETECTED THE HIGHEST TOTAL RICHNESS OVER ALL EIGHT STUDY SITES. TRAP NESTS AND OBSERVATION PLOTS DETECTED ONLY A LIMITED FRACTION OF THE BEE SPECIES RICHNESS. TO ASSESS THE TOTAL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS IN BEE DIVERSITY HOTSPOTS, SUCH AS THE STUDIED HABITATS, WE SUGGEST A COMBINATION OF TRANSECT WALKS CONDUCTED BY TRAINED BEE COLLECTORS AND PAN TRAP SAMPLING.",HYMENOPTERA; APOIDEA; SAMPLING METHODS; PAN TRAPS; TRANSECT WALKS; ABUNDANCE-BASED COVERAGE ESTIMATOR (ACE); SUBUNIT-BASED RAREFACTION CURVES; OLIVE GROVES; PHRYGANA; MEDITERRANEAN SCRUB; BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOT,PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE; PAN TRAP; HYMENOPTERA; DIVERSITY; APIFORMES; GREECE; ABUNDANCE; SERVICES; LAND,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,60,"NIELSEN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV OSLO, CTR ECOL END EVOLUTIONARY SYNTH CEES, DEPT BIOL, POB 1066, N-0316 OSLO, NORWAY.;NIELSEN, ANDERS, MESSINGER, OLIVIA, VAITIS, MICHALIS, TSCHEULIN, THOMAS, LAMBORN, ELLEN, PETANIDOU, THEODORA, UNIV AEGEAN, DEPT GEOG, LAB BIOGEOG \& ECOL, MITILINI 81100, LESVOS, GREECE.;NIELSEN, ANDERS, NORWEGIAN UNIV LIFE SCI, DEPT ECOL \& NAT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, N-1432 AS, NORWAY.;STEFFAN-DEWENTER, INGOLF, WESTPHAL, CATRIN, UNIV BAYREUTH, DEPT ANIM ECOL 1, D-95447 BAYREUTH, GERMANY.;WESTPHAL, CATRIN, UNIV GOTTINGEN, DEPT CROP SCI, D-37073 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.;MESSINGER, OLIVIA, SO ILLINOIS UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, CARBONDALE, IL 62966 USA.;POTTS, SIMON G., ROBERTS, STUART P.
