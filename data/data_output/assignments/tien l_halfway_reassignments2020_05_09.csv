CONSERV.,"THE REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF BOMBUS MUSCORUM WAS STUDIED IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF CENTRAL GERMANY, ONE OF TWO REMAINING AREAS WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF THIS NATIONALLY ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE LAND HESSE. TO DETERMINE THE LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS THAT FACILITATE THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM, GRID-BASED OBSERVATION RECORDS WERE ANALYSED IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT AT A REGIONAL SCALE. A SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE NUMBER OF TREES ON THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM AND A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE ONE OF THE PROPORTION OF ARABLE LAND, STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SPECIES' PREFERENCE FOR OPEN LANDSCAPES. YET, APART FROM OPEN LANDSCAPES ADDITIONAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES WERE SHOWN TO BE IMPORTANT. A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE EFFECT OF DITCHES IN THE FINAL MODEL REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LANDSCAPE ELEMENT FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM. THIS FINDING WAS ADDITIONALLY SUPPORTED BY RECORDINGS OF NEST-SEARCHING QUEENS, NESTS, AND FLOWER VISITS ALONG DITHES. THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CLOVER AND FALLOW LAND INDICATE THE SPECIES' NEED FOR SUITABLE FOOD RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. BECAUSE B. MUSCORUM EXHIBITS SMALL FORAGING RANGES, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS THAT PROVIDE NESTING SITES, FORAGING HABITATS AND UNDISTURBED HIBERNATION STRUCTURES ARE NEXT TO EACH OTHER. THE LOW NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS OF B. MUSCORUM RECORDED INDICATE THAT THE SUPPLY OF THESE HABITAT ELEMENTS MAY HAVE REACHED A CRITICAL THRESHOLD IN THE STUDY REGION.",DISTRIBUTION; ENDANGERED POLLINATORS; FLORAL RESOURCES; FORAGING BEHAVIOUR; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS,FIELD MARGINS; HABITAT; HYMENOPTERA; APIDAE; BEES; SCALE; EUROPE; CONSERVATION; POLLINATION; PASCUORUM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,24,"DIEKOTTER, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, GEOBOT INST, ZURICHBERGSTR 38, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, GEOBOT INST, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;UNIV GIESSEN, DEPT GEN \& SPECIAL ZOOL ANIM ECOL, GIESSEN, GERMANY.;UNIV MARBURG, DEPT BIOL, MARBURG, GERMANY.",10.1007/S10531-004-2932-9,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,0960-3115,1,SPRINGER,15,2006,ISI000236032000007,52,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",63,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",TIM.DIEKOETTERENV.ETHZ.CH,022CJ,"DIEKOTTER, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, GEOBOT INST, ZURICHBERGSTR 38, CH-8044 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",ISI,none,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL;UNIV GIESSEN;UNIV MARBURG,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,NA,"DIEKOTTER T, 2006, BIODIVERS CONSERV","DIEKOTTER T, 2006, BIODIVERS CONSERV",NA,NA,NA,ana

ONLY TWO SPECIES OF BUMBLEBEES, BOMBUS ALPINUS AND B. HYPERBOREUS, ARE COMMON AT THE SITE. BOMBUS HYPERBOREUS IS AN OBLIGATE NEST PARASITE ON B. ALPINUS, THE LATTER SPECIES IS FOUR TIMES MORE ABUNDANT THAN THE FORMER. THE NUMBER OF CAPTURES ON ANY GIVEN DAY WAS VERY LOW.

THE EXPERIMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT IN CAGES, ONCE WITH BUMBLEBEES AS POLLINATORS AND ONCE WITHOUT.

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SERAPIAS SPECIES HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IS BASED ON PRE-POLLINATION BARRIERS, THAT SECRETORY CELLS AND TRICHOMES ARE TYPICALLY DISTRIBUTED ON THE FLORAL LABELLUM AND THAT FLOWERS PRODUCE ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS. IN THIS STUDY WE COMPARE THE FLORAL SCENT COMPOSITION OF FOUR WIDESPREAD, CO-OCCURRING SERAPIAS SPECIES, NAMELY SERAPIAS LINGUA, SERAPIAS PARVIFLORA, SERAPIAS VOMERACEA AND SERAPIAS CORDIGERA.

OUR FINDINGS HELP TO CLARIFY THAT THE SYMPATRIC SERAPIAS SPECIES HAVE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FLORAL SCENT SIGNATURES THAT MAY ACCOUNT FOR THEIR RELEVANT ROLE AS PRE-POLLINATION BARRIERS.

CARVELL C,CARVELL C,HABITAT USE AND CONSERVATION OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.) UNDER DIFFERENT GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT REGIMES,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BIOL. CONSERV.,"DECLINES IN (LIE NATURAL POPULATIONS OF SEVERAL BUMBLEBEE SPECIES ACROSS BRITAIN AND EUROPE ARE AN INCREASING CAUSE FOR CONCERN. IN THIS STUDY THE HABITAT USE OF BUMBLEBEES WAS INVESTIGATED ON SALISBURY PLAIN TRAINING AREA, THE LARGEST REMAINING AREA OF UNIMPROVED CHALK GRASSLAND IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE. HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND FORAGING ACTIVITY OF BUMBLEBEES INCLUDED THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES (PARTICULARLY OF FAVOURED FORAGE PLANTS SUCH AS TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE), VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND HEIGHT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT DIFFERENT BOMBUS SPECIES RESPOND TO THESE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS DEPENDING ON THEIR SPECIFIC FORAGING AND NESTING REQUIREMENTS, THE CASE OF BOMBUS HUMILIS BEING ESPECIALLY RELEVANT. THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF THEIR SUITABILITY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BUMBLEBEE HABITATS. CATTLE GRAZING WAS SHOWN TO BE PREFERABLE TO BOTH SHEEP GRAZING AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY MANAGEMENT, ALTHOUGH THE TIMING AND INTENSITY OF SUCH GRAZING WAS IMPORTANT. SMALL-SCALE DISTURBANCES CAUSED BY VEHICLE ACTIVITY WERE ALSO OF VALUE IN PRODUCING LOCALLY ABUNDANT FORAGE RESOURCES IN LESS INTENSIVELY MANAGED GRASSLANDS. (C) 2001 ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD.

BAYESIAN ANALYSES OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL COX1 REGION AND THE MICROSATELLITE LOCI DEMONSTRATED THAT M. YUCATANICA FORM TWO CLADES CORRESPONDING TO THE MEXICAN AND GUATEMALAN POPULATIONS.

ECOL.,"CHANGES IN FLOWER-VISITING INSECT POPULATIONS OR COMMUNITIES THAT RESULT FROM HUMAN IMPACTS CAN BE DOCUMENTED BY MEASURING SPATIAL OR TEMPORAL TRENDS, OR BY COMPARING ABUNDANCE OR SPECIES COMPOSITION BEFORE AND AFTER DISTURBANCE. THE LEVEL OF NATURALLY OCCURRING VARIATION IN POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OVER SPACE AND TIME WILL DICTATE THE SAMPLING EFFORT REQUIRED TO DETECT HUMAN-INDUCED CHANGES. WE COMPILED A SET OF EXISTING SURVEYS OF THE BEE FAUNAS OF NATURAL COMMUNITIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO EXAMINE PATTERNS OF ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. WE FOCUSED ON A SUBSET OF THESE STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE VARIATION IN BEE COMMUNITIES AMONG DIFFERENT SITES AND WITHIN SITES OVER DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. WE USED EXAMPLES FROM OUR COMPILATION AND OTHER PUBLISHED STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE SAMPLING APPROACHES THAT MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF FUTURE SAMPLING EFFORTS. EXISTING STUDIES SUGGEST THAT BEE FAUNAS ARE LOCALLY DIVERSE, HIGHLY VARIABLE IN SPACE AND TIME, AND OFTEN RICH IN RARE SPECIES. ALL OF THESE ATTRIBUTES INDICATE THAT INTENSE SAMPLING AMONG SITES AND YEARS WILL BE REQUIRED TO DIFFERENTIATE CHANGES DUE TO SPECIFIC IMPACTS FROM THE NATURAL DYNAMICS OF POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES. GIVEN THE LIMITS ON TIME AND FUNDING FOR STUDYING BEES, APPROACHES THAT MAXIMIZE INFORMATION FOR EFFORT MUST BE SOUGHT FOR FUTURE STUDIES. RELIABLE INFORMATION ON POPULATION AND COMMUNITY CHANGES MAY BE GLEANED FROM EXAMINING ``FUNCTIONAL GROUPS RATHER THAN ENTIRE FAUNAS. REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY, STANDARDIZED SAMPLING PROTOCOLS USING REPLICATED DESIGNS WILL INCREASE THE VALUE OF DATA.
