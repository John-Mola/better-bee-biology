WHEN POLLINATORS WERE RARE, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUMBER OF BEES PRESENT AND NUMBER OF MATURE SEEDS PRODUCED, AND SUPPLEMENTAL HAND CROSS-POLLINATION (XENOGAMY) DID IMPROVE SEED SET IN GENTIANA NEWBERRYI GRAY. WHEN POLLINATORS WERE ABUNDANT, SUPPLEMENTAL HAND CROSS-POLLINATION DID NOT INCREASE SEED SET. SELF-FERTILIZED SEEDS (AUTOGAMY) GERMINATED AT THE SAME RATE AS CROSS-POLLINATED SEEDS.

HARDER LD;WILSON WG,HARDER LD,THEORETICAL CONSEQUENCES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS FOR POLLEN DISPERSAL BY ANIMALS,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"POLLINATION GOVERNS A PLANT'S MATING OPTIONS BY ESTABLISHING THE DIVERSITY AND INTENSITY OF MALE-GAMETE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PLANTS. FOR ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS, THE PATTERN OF POLLEN DISPERSAL ARISES FROM THE POLLINATOR'S INTERACTIONS WITH FLORAL ORGANS DURING EACH FLOWER VISIT AND WITH THE POLLEN IT CARRIES DURING TRANSPORT. THESE INTERACTIONS TYPICALLY CAUSE SOME PORTIONS OF A FLOWER'S POLLEN TO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT TRANSPORT CONDITIONS THAN OTHER PORTIONS. WE MODEL THREE CLASSES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECTS ON POLLEN DISPERSAL. TWO CLASSES OCCUR WHEN THE POLLEN CARRIED BY INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS BECOMES SPATIALLY STRUCTURED. ``HORIZONTAL STRUCTURE ARISES WHEN AREAS OF A POLLINATOR'S BODY DIFFER IN THEIR FREQUENCY OR INTENSITY OF CONTACT WITH ANTHERS AND/OR STIGMAS. ALTERNATIVELY, ``VERTICAL STRUCTURE DEVELOPS WHEN POLLINATORS DO NOT DISTURB THEIR POLLEN LOAD, CAUSING POLLEN TO ACCUMULATE ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY IN LAYERS, SO THAT MUCH POLLEN IS TEMPORARILY INACCESSIBLE TO STIGMAS. THE THIRD CLASS OF HETEROGENEITY OCCURS WHEN THE POLLINATORS THAT VISIT A FLOWER DIFFER CONSISTENTLY WITH RESPECT TO POLLEN TRANSFER FROM POLLINATOR TO STIGMAS. THESE CLASSES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT PRODUCE SIMILAR MEAN PATTERNS OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, WHICH DIFFER FROM THAT EXPECTED IF TRANSPORTED POLLEN ACTS AS A HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION. IN PARTICULAR, NEAR AND FAR RECIPIENT FLOWERS RECEIVE PROPORTIONATELY MORE OF THE DONOR POLLEN REACHING STIGMAS THAN PREDICTED FOR A SINGLE POPULATION. REANALYSIS OF DATA IN THE LITERATURE ILLUSTRATES THAT PREDICTIONS BASED ON HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OBSERVED DISPERSAL PATTERNS THAN PREDICTIONS OF THE TRADITIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF POLLEN DISPERSAL. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT STOCHASTIC VARIATION BETWEEN FLOWERS IN POLLEN DONATION AND RECEIPT DOES NOT AFFECT THE ARITHMETIC MEAN PATTERN OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, ALTHOUGH IT DOES REDUCE THE GEOMETRIC MEAN. ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS PRODUCE SIMILAR MEAN PATTERNS OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, THE INFLUENCES OF SPECIFIC FLORAL AND POLLINATOR CHARACTERISTICS ON DISPERSAL CAN DEPEND ON THE TYPE(S) OF HETEROGENEITY INVOLVED. IN PARTICULAR, PISTIL CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD AFFECT DISPERSAL INDEPENDENTLY OF STAMEN CHARACTERISTICS WHEN HORIZONTAL HETEROGENEITY GOVERNS TRANSPORT DYNAMICS, BUT NOT WHEN POLLEN ACCUMULATES IN LAYERS. THIS RELATION IS LIKELY REFLECTED IN MANY ASPECTS OF FLORAL DIVERGENCE AMONG RELATED TAXA POLLINATED BY DIFFERENT VECTORS AND CONVERGENT DESIGN AMONG UNRELATED TAXA SERVED BY SIMILAR VECTORS.",ANIMAL POLLINATION; FLOWER DESIGN; POLLEN CARRYOVER; POLLEN DEPOSITION; POLLEN LAYERING; POLLEN REMOVAL; POLLINATION; POLLINATOR GROOMING; STOCHASTIC VARIATION,TRISTYLOUS-PONTEDERIA-CORDATA; BUMBLE BEES; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; POLLINATED PLANTS; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; SEXUAL SELECTION; WILD RADISH; MATE CHOICE; CARRYOVER; REMOVAL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,61,"HARDER, LD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALGARY, DEPT BIOL SCI, 2500 UNIV DR 1 NW, CALGARY, AB T2N 1N4, CANADA.;UNIV CALGARY, DEPT BIOL SCI, CALGARY, AB T2N 1N4, CANADA.;DUKE UNIV, DEPT ZOOL, DURHAM, NC 27708 USA.",10.2307/176517,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,0012-9658,8,WILEY,79,1998,ISI000077501000016,65,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,26,ECOLOGY,HARDERACS.UCALGARY.CA,148JF,"HARDER, LD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALGARY, DEPT BIOL SCI, 2500 UNIV DR 1 NW, CALGARY, AB T2N 1N4, CANADA",ISI,none,UNIV CALGARY;DUKE UNIV,UNIV CALGARY,NA,"HARDER LD, 1998, ECOLOGY","HARDER LD, 1998, ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,byron

IN AN INTENSIVELY FARMED AREA OF NORTHEAST ITALY WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER ISOLATED ORGANIC FARMS, IN A CONVENTIONALLY FARMED LANDSCAPE, PROVIDED LOCAL BENEFITS FOR INSECT POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION SERVICES. WE QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT (I.E. THE FARM SYSTEM), LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT (PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND) AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM. WE COMPARED SIX ORGANIC AND SIX CONVENTIONAL VINE FIELDS. THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH SITE AT RADII OF 200, 500, 1000 AND 2000 M. THE ORGANIC FIELDS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE CONVENTIONAL IN THEIR FLORAL RESOURCES OR PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, VISITATION RATES TO, AND POLLINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL POTTED PLANTS. NONE OF THESE FACTORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE FARMING SYSTEM. THE ABUNDANCE OF VISITS TO THE POTTED PLANTS IN THE CONVENTIONAL FIELDS TENDED TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. THE PROPORTION FRUIT SET, WEIGHT OF SEEDS PER PLANT AND SEED WEIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC FIELDS WERE ALL NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. IN VINE FIELDS THE IMPACT OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE WAS STRONGER THAN THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT. ENHANCEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY THROUGH ORGANIC FARMING SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE UBIQUITOUS, AS POTENTIAL BENEFITS MAY BE OFFSET BY THE CROP TYPE, ORGANIC-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIREMENTS IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE.

YOKOI T;FUJISAKI K,YOKOI T,RECOGNITION OF SCENT MARKS IN SOLITARY BEES TO AVOID PREVIOUSLY VISITED FLOWERS,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,ECOL. RES.,"KNOWING HOW FLORAL VISITORS FORAGE EFFICIENTLY AMONG FLOWERS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. WHEN BEES SEARCH FOR REWARDING FLOWERS, THEY USE SEVERAL VISUAL CUES TO DETECT THE AVAILABLE FLORAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THESE CUES, BEES CAN RECOGNIZE SCENT MARKS, WHICH ARE OLFACTORY CUES LEFT ON FLOWERS FORAGED BY PREVIOUS VISITORS. THIS BEHAVIOR IS WELL KNOWN IN SOCIAL BEES, SUCH AS HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES. ALTHOUGH SOLITARY BEES DO NOT NEED TO GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH FLOWERS WERE FORAGED TO CONSPECIFICS, SEVERAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE HAVE INDICATED THE USE OF SCENT MARKS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE BEHAVIOR IS WIDELY USED IN MANY DIFFERENT BEE SPECIES. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER FOUR DIFFERENT SOLITARY BEES, COLLETES PATELLATUS (COLLETIDAE), ANDRENA PROSTOMIAS (ANDRENIDAE), OSMIA ORIENTALIS (MEGACHILIDAE), AND TETRALONIA MITSUKURII (APIDAE), CAN RECOGNIZE FLOWERS THAT HAVE BEEN FORAGED PREVIOUSLY BY VISITORS WITHIN 3 MIN. ALL FOUR BEES SHOWED REJECTION RESPONSES TO FLOWERS FORAGED BY CONSPECIFICS. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT RESPONSES TO FORAGED FLOWERS VARIED AMONG BEE SPECIES. THE TENDENCY OF A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII TO REJECT THE FORAGED FLOWERS WAS PRONOUNCED, WHILE IN C. PATELLATUS AND O. ORIENTALIS IT WAS WEAK. IN BOTH A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII, THE REJECTION RATE OF FLOWERS FORAGED BY CONSPECIFICS DECREASED AS THE TIME LAG AFTER THE LAST VISIT INCREASED. BOTH BEES VISITED THE FLOWERS FROM WHICH POLLEN OR NECTAR HAD BEEN ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED. WE SUGGEST THAT A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII WOULD RECOGNIZE SCENT MARKS LEFT BY PREVIOUS VISITORS, WHILE THE OTHER TWO BEES WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THEM SO STRONGLY. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE DECISION TO USE SCENT MARKS IS DEPENDENT EITHER ON THE RICHNESS OF RESOURCES OR ON THE COMPLEXITY OF FLORAL STRUCTURE.",FLORAL RESOURCES; FORAGING STRATEGIES; SCENT MARKS; SOLITARY BEES; REJECTION RESPONSES,FORAGING BUMBLEBEES; FOOD SOURCES; NECTAR; CUES; HONEYBEES; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; RESPONSES; IDENTITY; SIGNALS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,14,"YOKOI, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH AGR, LAB INSECT ECOL, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.;YOKOI, TOMOYUKI, FUJISAKI, KENJI, KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH AGR, LAB INSECT ECOL, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.",10.1007/S11284-008-0551-8,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA","MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY OF JAPANMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO DAVE GOULSON, SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING, AND PABLO J.

THIS SPECIES FLOWERS FROM JANUARY TO JUNE, WITH A PEAK IN THE MID-WET SEASON (MARCH), AND FRUITS DURING THE DRY SEASON (MAY-SEPTEMBER). MEDIAN DISTANCES BETWEEN SYNCHRONIZED FLOWERING TREES WERE 600 TO 1000 M DEPENDING ON THE TIME OF THE FLOWERING SEASON. THE NUMBER OF SYNCHRONOUS FLOWERING TREES AT EACH OBSERVATION DATE IN THE 400-HA PLOT WAS 14 OR 17.5 PER 1 D, 13 (BOTH) PER 15 D, AND THREE OR 13 PER 30 D, DEPENDING UPON WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WAS USED TO EVALUATE SYNCHRONY. FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FLOWERING TREES OVERLAPPED IN FLOWERING WITH SIX TO SEVEN OTHER FLOWERING TREES GROWING WITHIN A RADIUS OF 1000 M DURING MOST OF THE ANNUAL FLOWERING PERIOD. OUTCROSSING RATES WERE 100 \% AND THE RELATIVELY LONG DISTANCES BETWEEN TREES IN FLOWER AT THE SAME TIME, SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS SPECIES IS POLLINATED BY POLLINATORS TRAVELLING DISTANCES AS FAR AS 1000 M.",AMAZONIAN TREES; COURATARI MULTIFLORA; LECYTHIDACEAE; RARITY; REPRODUCTIVE PHENOLOGY,RAIN-FOREST; EUGLOSSINE BEES; COSTA-RICA; FRUIT-SET; SYSTEM; DISPERSAL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"LEPSCH-CUNHA, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), INST PESQUITAS AMAZONIA, INPA, BIOL DYNAM FOREST FRAGMENTS PROJECT, CP 478, BR-69011970 MANAUS, AMAZONAS, BRAZIL.;INST PESQUITAS AMAZONIA, INPA, BIOL DYNAM FOREST FRAGMENTS PROJECT, BR-69011970 MANAUS, AMAZONAS, BRAZIL.",10.1017/S0266467499000693,"40 WEST 20TH STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",NA,NA,0266-4674,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,15,1999,ISI000079635000006,65,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,4,ECOLOGY,NA,184VT,"LEPSCH-CUNHA, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), INST PESQUITAS AMAZONIA, INPA, BIOL DYNAM FOREST FRAGMENTS PROJECT, CP 478, BR-69011970 MANAUS, AMAZONAS, BRAZIL",ISI,none,INST PESQUITAS AMAZONIA,LEPSCH-CUNHA,NA,"LEPSCH-CUNHA N, 1999, J TROP ECOL","LEPSCH-CUNHA N, 1999, J TROP ECOL",NA,NA,NA,kiera n
MORANDIN LA;LAVERTY TM;GEGEAR RJ;KEVAN PG,MORANDIN LA,EFFECT OF GREENHOUSE POLYETHELENE COVERING ON ACTIVITY LEVEL AND PHOTO-RESPONSE OF BUMBLE BEES,CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST,CAN. ENTOMOL.,"WE CONDUCTED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS ASSESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSE POLYETHYLENE COVERINGS AND BUMBLE BEE, BOMBUS IMPATIENS CRESSON (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE), ACTIVITY AND LOSS FROM VENTILATION SYSTEMS. BEE ACTIVITY WAS MEASURED IN FOUR SMALL GREENHOUSES, EACH WITH A DIFFERENT POLYETHYLENE COVERING. BEE ACTIVITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING PHOTODIODE TUNNELS MOUNTED IN THE HIVE ENTRANCES. CONTRARY TO COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENTS. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN BEE ACTIVITY BASED ON COVERING TYPE. THERE WAS A POSITIVE LINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEMPERATURE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GREENHOUSES AND BEE ACTIVITY. THE POTENTIAL FOR BEE LOSS THROUGH OPEN VENTILATION SYSTEMS FOR FIVE COVERING TYPES WAS QUANTIFIED USING A Y-MAZE DECISION BOX. BEES WERE MORE ATTRACTED TO DIRECT LIGHT THAN TO LIGHT TRANSMITTED THROUGH ULTRAVIOLET (UV) BLOCKING COVERINGS, WHEREAS BEES WERE EQUALLY ATTRACTED TO DIRECT LIGHT AS THEY WERE TO UV-TRANSMITTING COVERINGS. THESE EXPERIMENTS SUGGEST THAT GREENHOUSES WITH UV-TRANSMITTING PLASTICS MAY RESULT IN LESS BEE LOSS THROUGH VENTILATION SYSTEMS.",NA,HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"MORANDIN, LA (REPRINT AUTHOR), SIMON FRASER UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, BURNABY, BC V5A 1S6, CANADA.;UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO, DEPT ZOOL, LONDON, ON N6A 5B7, CANADA.;UNIV GUELPH, GUELPH, ON N1G 2W1, CANADA.",10.4039/ENT134539-4,"393 WINSTON AVE, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K2A 1Y8, CANADA",NA,NA,0008-347X,4,ENTOMOL SOC CANADA,134,2002,ISI000177799200009,26,ENTOMOLOGY,12,ENTOMOLOGY,NA,590CD,"MORANDIN, LA (REPRINT AUTHOR), SIMON FRASER UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, BURNABY, BC V5A 1S6, CANADA",ISI,none,UNIV WESTERN ONTARIO;UNIV GUELPH,SIMON FRASER UNIV,NA,"MORANDIN LA, 2002, CAN ENTOMOL","MORANDIN LA, 2002, CAN ENTOMOL",NA,NA,NA,tien l

SOC.,"MOST OF THE FLOWER-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS ARE BASED ON REWARDS AS POLLEN AND NECTAR. OUR GROUP HOWEVER, HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF UNUSUAL REWARDS LIKE FLORAL RESINS AND FLORAL OILS. WE ARE NOW REPORTING THE CHEMISTRY OF THE FLORALOILS OF ONCIDIUM PUBES WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF DIACYLGLYCEROLS AND TRIACYLGLYCEROLS POSSESSING ONE OR TWO ACETYL RESIDUES AND ONE LONG CHAIN FATTY ACID. THE SUBSTITUTION PATTERN OF SOME OF THE DIACYLGLYCEROLS WAS INFERRED TO BE 1, 3 BASED ON SPECTROSCOPIC ANALYSES AND COMPARISON WITH 3 DIFFERENT SYNTHETIC COMPOUNDS OBTAINED FROM D-MANNITOL, OLEIC ACID AND ACETIC ACID. THE FATTY ACID RESIDUES POSSESS DOUBLE BOND AND/OR ACETOXY GROUP AS FUNCTIONAL GROUPS. FINALLY OUR RESULTS PROVIDED CHEMICAL EVIDENCES THAT POLLINATION OF ONCIDIUM PUBES IS NOT BASED UPON AN ATTRACTION-DECEPTION SYSTEM BUT ON FLORAL LIPIDS AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS EVER BEEN MENTIONED IN THE LITERATURE.",ORCHIDACEAE; ONCIDIUM PUBES; FLORAL LIPIDS; (BETA-ACETOXY-OCTADECANOYL)-ACETYL-GLYCEROL AND (BETA-ACETOXY-EICOSENOYL)-ACETYL-GLYCEROL,BEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,31,"REIS, MG (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, INST QUIM, CP 6154, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL.;UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, INST QUIM, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL.;UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, INST BIOL, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL.",10.1590/S0103-50532000000600008,"CAIXA POSTAL 26037, 05599-970 SAO PAULO, BRAZIL",NA,NA,0103-5053,6,SOC BRASILEIRA QUIMICA,11,2000,ISI000165580400008,38,CHEMISTRY,7,"CHEMISTRY, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",NA,378JC,"REIS, MG (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS, INST QUIM, CP 6154, BR-13083970 CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL",ISI,none,UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS;UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,UNIV ESTADUAL CAMPINAS,NA,"REIS MG, 2000, J BRAZ CHEM SOC","REIS MG, 2000, J BRAZ CHEM SOC",NA,NA,NA,tien l
