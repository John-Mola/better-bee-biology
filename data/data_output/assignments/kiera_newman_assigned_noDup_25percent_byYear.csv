MIXTURES OF PROTOPLASTS THUS MODIFIED WERE TREATED WITH CA2+ AND POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL TO OBTAIN HETEROLOGOUS FUSION PRODUCTS. AMONG THE FUSION PRODUCTS WERE SOME TOMATO PLANTS THAT WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE ORIGINAL CULTIVARS WITH RESPECT TO MORPHOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND CHROMOSOME NUMBER (2N=24) BUT EXHIBITED VARIOUS DEGREES OF MALE STERILITY (MS): COMPLETE LACK OR MALFORMATION OF ANTHERS, SHRUNKEN POLLEN, AND NORMAL-LOOKING STAINABLE POLLEN THAT COULD NOT GERMINATE.

ESCULENTUM CERASIFORME, WAS INHERITED MATERNALLY OVER SEVERAL GENERATIONS AND IS, THEREFORE, CYTOPLASMICALLY DETERMINED MS (CMS). ANALYSIS OF MITOCHONDRIAL DNA REVEALED THAT THE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME OF THE CMS HYBRIDS DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL ELEMENTS OF THE MITOCHONDRIAL DNA OF EITHER PARENT BUT INCLUDES SEQUENCES OF A RECOMBINATIONAL NATURE NOT PRESENT IN EITHER PARENT. THE CMS HYBRIDS, THEREFORE, POSSESS A TRUE HYBRID MITOCHONDRIAL GENOME. THE SAME PROCEDURE APPLIED TO FUSION OF TOMATO WITH SOLANUM LYCOPERSICOIDES AND NICOTIANA TABACUM CELLS DID NOT PRODUCE CMS PHENOTYPES. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD OVER OTHERS FOR GENERATING MS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (I) ONLY ONE STEP IS REQUIRED, (II) THE NUCLEAR GENOTYPE OF THE CULTIVAR IS UNAFFECTED, (III) THE PROSPECT THAT CYTOPLASMIC DETERMINATION ALLOWS GENERATION OF 100\% CMS PROGENIES.

BIOSCI.,"THE BEE GUILD REPRESENTS DIRECT PRIMARY COSTS OF ANGIOSPERM REPRODUCTION. TROPICAL FLOWER VISITORS TAKE AN AMOUNT COMPARABLE TO HERBIVORES, EXCEEDING 3\% OF NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION ENERGY. THEREFORE HERBIVORY AND ABOVEGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION HAVE BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. COMPARING POLLINATORS TO OTHER HERBIVORES, HARVEST IN MATURE FOREST BY TROPICAL BEES IS GREATER THAN LEAFCUTTER ANTS, GAME ANIMALS, FRUGIVORES, VERTEBRATE FOLIVORES, INSECT DEFOLIATORS EXCLUDING ANTS, FLOWER-FEEDING BIRDS AND BATS, BUT NOT SOIL ORGANISMS. THE RATIO OF TOTAL ABOVEGROUND NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION TO INVESTMENT IN POLLEN, NECTAR AND RESIN USED BY POLLINATORS SUGGESTS WIND POLLINATION IS SEVERAL TIMES MORE EFFICIENT IN TEMPERATE FORESTS THAN IS ANIMAL POLLINATION IN NEOTROPICAL MOIST FOREST. ANIMAL POLLINATION MAY, BE FAVOUR,ED BY HABITAT MOSAICS AND AN UNPREDICTABLE OR SPARSE DISPERSION OF CONSPECIFICS-CONSEQUENCES OF FLUCTUATING ABIOTIC AND BIOTIC ENVIRONMENTS.

(EUPHORBIACEAE) TO RECONSTRUCT THE HISTORY OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN POLLINATION SYSTEMS. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS WERE TREATED AS A HYPOTHESIS AND TESTED FOR CIRCULARITY PROBLEMS AND ROBUSTNESS IN THE FACE OF CHANGES IN THE DATA SET. THE HISTORICAL HYPOTHESIS WAS USED TO MAKE SPECIFIC PREDICTIONS ABOUT DETAILS OF POLLINATION ECOLOGY AND REWARD BIOCHEMISTRY, THE PREDICTIONS WERE SUPPORTED BY INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS. I CONCLUDE THAT POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN DALECHAMPIA HAVE BEEN EVOLUTIONARILY LABILE, RELATIVE TO MOST MORPHOLOGICAL FEATURES, WITH REPEATED PARALLELISMS AND REVERSALS. TRANSITIONS AMONG THE THREE POLLINATION SYSTEMS EVOLVED BY DALECHAMPIA (POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING BEES, FRAGRANCE-COLLECTING MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES, AND POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES) HAVE BEEN FACILITATED BY BIOCHEMICAL EXAPTATION (PREADAPTATION). POLLINATION BY MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES IS RELATIVELY RARE IN THE GENUS BUT HAS ORIGINATED INDEPENDENTLY THREE TO FOUR TIMES. IN CONTRAST, POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING FEMALE BEES IS VERY COMMON, BUT HAS ORIGINATED ONLY ONCE. EIGHTY-SIX TO 97\% OF TRANSITIONS BETWEEN POLLINATION SYSTEMS INVOLVED AN INTERMEDIATE PHASE DURING WHICH BOTH OLD AND NEW POLLINATORS WERE EFFECTIVE, BUT 3 TO 14\% OF TRANSITIONS MAY HAVE BEEN `'INSTANTANEOUS,'' LACKING THE INTERMEDIATE PHASE. CLADES OF SPECIES SECRETING RESIN REWARDS ARE ABOUT 10 TIMES AS SPECIES RICH AS CLADES OF SPECIES SECRETING FRAGRANCE REWARDS, CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT DIFFERENT EXTINCTION RATES MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DIFFERENCE.

LINNEAN SOC.,"SELECTION ON FLOWERS HAS OFTEN BEEN VIEWED AS BEING PARTICULARLY STRICT, CONSTANT, AND RESPONSIBLE FOR SPECIES DIFFERENCES. IMPATIENS PALLIDA AND I. CAPENSIS FLOWERS FIT SNUGLY AROUND BEES, LEADING ONE TO EXPECT A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATION SUCCESS. MY STUDIES ON THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMOVED FROM ANDROECIA AND DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS IN SINGLE VISITS BY BUMBLEBEES DID NOT CONFIRM THIS SUPPOSITION. TRIMMING OFF PARTS OF THE FLORAL VESTIBULE WITH SCISSORS AND GLUING IN PLEATS HAD VERY LITTLE EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN THAT BEES MOVED. IN RECIPROCAL TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS, FLOWERS FROM DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SOMETIMES DIFFERED IN THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN MOVED, BUT WHEN THE TWO SPECIES WERE COMPARED IN SYMPATRY, POLLEN REMOVAL AND DEPOSITION DIFFERED HARDLY AT ALL. A COMPARISON OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLLEN MOVEMENT AND FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AMONG 15 POPULATIONS SHOWED THAT, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS GREAT HETEROGENEITY IN THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN MOVED, THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES WERE INDEPENDENT OF FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. NONE OF THIS SUPPORTS A BELIEF IN STRONG SELECTION THAT FINE-TUNES THE MECHANICAL FIT BETWEEN BEE AND NEWER, SELECTION FOR VISITATION SUCCESS BASED ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR MAY HAVE A MUCH STRONGER INFLUENCE ON FLORAL CHARACTERS.

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN NATURAL VARIATION IN ATTRACTIVE TRAITS AND NATURAL VARIATION IN VISITATION TO WHOLE PLANTS. HERE WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF FLOWER NUMBER AND SIZE ON VISITATION TO WILD RADISH BY TWO TAXA OF POLLINATORS OVER 3 YEARS, USING A COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE REGRESSION AND EXPERIMENTAL REDUCTIONS IN BOTH TRAITS. WE FOUND STRONG, CONSISTENT EVIDENCE THAT INCREASES IN BOTH FLOWER NUMBER AND SIZE CAUSE INCREASED VISITATION BY SYRPHID FLIES. THE RESULTS FOR SMALL BEES WERE HARDER TO INTERPRET, BECAUSE THE MULTIPLE REGRESSION AND EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION RESULTS DID NOT AGREE. IT IS LIKELY THAT INCREASED FLOWER SIZE CAUSES A WEAK INCREASE IN SMALL-BEE VISITATION, BUT STRONG RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLOWER NUMBER AND SMALL-BEE VISITATION SEEN IN 2 YEARS OF OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES WERE NOT CORROBORATED BY EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION OF THIS TRAIT. SMALL BEES MAY ACTUALLY HAVE RESPONDED TO AN UNMEASURED TRAIT CORRELATED WITH FLOWER NUMBER, OR LOWER SMALL-BEE ABUNDANCES WHEN THE FLOWER NUMBER MANIPULATION WAS CONDUCTED MAY HAVE REDUCED OUR ABILITY TO DETECT A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP.

HOWEVER, WHEN POLLEN ARRIVES ON STIGMAS, THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH RACES FOR ACCESS TO OVULES (EXPLOITATION COMPETITION) AND INTERFERENCE WITH THE GERMINATION AND GROWTH OF POLLEN FROM OTHER DONORS (INTERFERENCE COMPETITION). WE CONSIDERED WHETHER THIS SECOND FORM OF COMPETITION MIGHT OCCUR AMONG POLLEN GRAINS OF WILD RADISH IN TWO EXPERIMENTS. IN THE FIRST, INTERFERENCE LIKELY OCCURRED BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN GERMINATION WAS LESS IN MIXED-DONOR THAN IN SINGLE-DONOR POLLINATIONS. THIS RESULT WAS DUPLICATED IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT, WHICH ALSO SHOWED THAT INTERFERENCE OCCURRED ONLY WHEN POLLEN GRAINS FROM DIFFERENT DONORS WERE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER. IN ADDITION, IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERFERENCE AFFECTED THE FREQUENCY OF SEEDS SIRED BY DIFFERENT POLLEN DONORS.

BOT.,"CROP-WEED HYBRIDIZATION CAN POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF WILD POPULATIONS. MANY CROPS ARE KNOWN TO HYBRIDIZE WITH WILD RELATIVES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT THE LONG-TERM PERSISTENCE OF CROP GENES IN THE WILD. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED ONE FACTOR IN THE HYBRIDIZATION PROCESS IN RADISH: DIFFERENTIAL POLLINATOR VISITATION TO WILD RADISH (RAPHANUS RAPHANISTRUM) VS. CROP-WILD F-1 HYBRIDS (R. SATIVUS X R. RAPHANISTRUM). WILD GENOTYPES HAD YELLOW FLOWERS, A RECESSIVE SINGLE-LOCUS TRAIL, WHEREAS HYBRIDS ALWAYS HAD WHITE OR PALE PINK FLOWERS. IN EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN, TOTAL POLLINATOR VISITATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BIASED TOWARD WILD PLANTS WHEN THE FREQUENCIES OF WILD AND HYBRID PLANTS WERE EQUAL. SYRPHID FLIES, THE MOST FREQUENT VISITORS, PREFERRED WILD PLANTS WHILE BUMBLE BEES SHOWED NO PREFERENCE. THIS PATTERN WAS ALSO OBSERVED WHEN HYBRID PLANTS WERE OVERREPRESENTED IN THE ARRAY (12 HYBRID:2 WILD). IN CONTRAST, WHEN HYBRID PLANTS WERE RARE (2 HYBRID:12 WILD), NEITHER MORPH WAS PREFERRED BY ANY POLLINATOR GROUP. LATER IN THE SUMMER, POLLINATORS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN A LARGE EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN WITH NEARLY EQUAL FREQUENCIES OF WILD AND HYBRID PLANTS. CABBAGE BUTTERFLIES (PIERIS RAPAE) STRONGLY OVERVISITED WILD PLANTS, WHILE BUMBLE BEES SHOWED A SLIGHT PREFERENCE FOR HYBRIDS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT F-1 HYBRIDS MAY NOT BE AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH REGARD TO POLLINATOR VISITS WHEN THEY OCCUR AT LOW FREQUENCIES OR WHEN BUMBLE BEES ARE FREQUENT FLOWER VISITORS.

MISCELLANEOUS CASES",FLORA,FLORA,"IN THE PRESENT, FINAL PART OF A SERIES OF CONTRIBUTIONS ON NECTARIES, FURTHER, MISCELLANEOUS CASE HISTORIES ARE PRESENTED BECAUSE OF THEIR HISTOLOGICAL OR ECOLOGICAL INTEREST. IN THE SPECIAL SECTION, EXTRAFLORAL AND FLORAL NECTARIES OF MEMBERS OF SIX FAMILIES ARE TREATED. A GENERAL SURVEY CONCLUDES THE PAPER. EXTRANUPTIAL GLANDS ATTRACTING ANT GUARDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLOWERS OF BECIUM AND OCIMUM (LAMIACEAE), THEY REPRESENT NOVEL CASES IN A FAMILY HITHERTO BELIEVED TO LACK THIS KIND OF ORGANS. THE GLANDS DEVELOP IN AN UNUSUAL WAY BY TRANSFORMATION OF ABSCISSION SCARS OF FLORAL BRACTS. THE FIVE FLORAL BUT EXTRANUPTIAL GLANDS ON THE CALYX OF SIPHOCAMPYLUS BETULIFOLIUS (LOBELIACEAE), WITH A SIMILAR FUNCTION, ARE UNUSUAL IN SHARING THE SAME HISTOLOGICAL STRUCTURE AND DRAINAGE VIA STOMATAL SAP-HOLES WITH THE CLOSELY ADJOINING NUPTIAL NECTARY, A DISK. THREE CASE HISTORIES REFER TO ZOOPHILOUS UNISEXUAL FLOWERS WITH ONLY ONE OF THE FUNCTIONAL SEXUAL MORPHS REWARDING WITH NECTAR. IN PACHYSANDRA AND SARCOCOCCA (MONOECIOUS BUXACEAE) THE MALE FLOWERS ARE NECTARIFEROUS. THE NECTARLESS PISTILLATE FLOWERS ARE INADVERTENTLY POLLINATED BY BEES WHILE THESE EXPLOIT THE STAMINATE FLOWERS. TWO OTHER INSTANCES, ALTHOUGH HETEROGENEOUS IN DETAIL, EXHIBIT THE REVERSE SITUATION IN THAT ONLY THE PISTILLATE FLOWERS YIELD NECTAR: THE MALE CAPITULA OF THE DIOECIOUS COMPOSITE HEREROTHALAMUS ALIENUS ARE GIRDLED BY FEMALE-STERILE RAY FLORETS WITH COPIOUS NECTAR, BEES TAKING IT BECOME DUSTED WITH POLLEN WHEN THEY MOVE OVER THE DRY STAMINATE DISK FLORETS. THEY MAY SUBSEQUENTLY POLLINATE THE FEMALE HEADS, WHICH ENTIRELY CONSIST OF NECTARIFEROUS PISTILLATE RAY FLORETS. IN THE HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED BEGONIA FERRUGINEA IT IS ALSO THE PISTILLATE FLOWERS THAT CONTAIN A PRESUMABLY NECTAREOUS FLUID, WHILE THE DRY STAMINATE ONES FALLACIOUSLY ATTRACT THE VISITORS BY MIMICKING THE PISTILLATE FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH BASICALLY EPIGYNOUS, THE PROTANDROUS REVOLVER FLOWERS OF THE LITTLE-KNOWN GENUS PENTAPHRAGMA (PENTAPHRAGMATACEAE) HAVE MAINTAINED THE SUBBASAL POSITION OF THEIR FIVE SEPARATE NECTARIES ON THE OVARY WALL, THE NECTAR BEING ACCESSIBLE TO BEES VIA FIVE RECEPTACULAR CHANNELS. IN THE CONCLUDING CHAPTER, POSSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY PATHWAYS LEADING TO FLORAL NECTARIES, PARTICULARLY FLORAL DISKS, ARE DISCUSSED. HYDATHODES OF VEGETATIVE PROVENANCE RATHER THAN EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES ARE LIKELY PRECURSORS OF MOST FLORAL NECTARIES. DEVELOPMENTAL MODULES COMPRISING A SINGLE STOMATAL SAP-HOLE OR GROUPS OF THEM, ASSOCIATED WITH PERISTOMATAL GLAND CELLS, MAY HAVE AGGREGATED IN FLOWERS TO FORM DISKS. SEPARATE NECTARIFEROUS SCALES AS FOUND IN FLOWERS OF THE CUCURBITACEAE, CRASSULACEAE AND THE GERANIALES ALSO REVEAL SIMILARITIES WITH THE RESPECTIVE LEAF HYDATHODES. THE ORGANOPHYLESIS OF THE SINGLE SCALE SEATED IN THE AXIAL SPUR OF PELARGONIUM IS DETAILED AS AN EXAMPLE. A CLUSTERED DISTRIBUTION OF STOMATAL SAP-HOLES ON DISKS CAN BE PARTLY INTERPRETED AS REVEALING THEIR ORIGIN FROM MERISTIC HYDATHODAL MODULES.

SCI.,"EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS HAVE LONG HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DIVERSITY OF FLOWER COLOURS WE SEE IS IN PART A STRATEGY TO PROMOTE MEMORIZATION BY POLLINATORS, POLLINATOR CONSTANCY AND THEREFORE, A DIRECTED AND EFFICIENT POLLEN TRANSFER BETWEEN PLANTS. HOWEVER, THIS HYPOTHESIS HAS NEVER BEEN TESTED AGAINST A BIOLOGICALLY REALISTIC NULL MODEL, NOR WERE COLOURS ASSESSED IN THE WAY POLLINATORS SEE THEM. OUR INTENT HERE IS TO FILL THESE GAPS. THROUGHOUT ONE YEAR, WE SAMPLED FLORAL SPECIES COMPOSITIONS AT FIVE ECOLOGICALLY DISTINCT SITES NEAR BERLIN, GERMANY. BEE-SUBJECTIVE COLOURS WERE QUANTIFIED FOR ALL 168 SPECIES. A MODEL OF COLOUR VISION WAS USED TO PREDICT HOW SIMILAR THE COLOURS OF SYMPATRIC AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BLOOMING FLOWERS WERE FOR BEES. WE THEN COMPARED FLOWER COLOUR DIFFERENCES IN THE REAL HABITATS WITH THOSE OF RANDOM PLANT COMMUNITIES. WE DID NOT FIND PRONOUNCED DEVIATIONS FROM CHANCE WHEN WE CONSIDERED COMMON PLANTS. WHEN WE EXAMINED RARE PLANTS, HOWEVER, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE IN TWO OF THE FIVE PLANT COMMUNITIES.

ECOL.,"WILD RELATIVES OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS CAN ACQUIRE TRANSGENIC TRAITS SUCH AS HERBICIDE RESISTANCE VIA SPONTANEOUS CROP-WILD HYBRIDIZATION. IN AGRICULTURAL WEEDS, RESISTANCE TO HERBICIDES IS OFTEN A BENEFICIAL TRAIT, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT POSSIBLE COSTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE PERSISTENCE OF THIS TRAIT WHEN HERBICIDES ARE NOT USED. WE TESTED FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSGENIC RESISTANCE TO GLUFOSINATE WHEN INTROGRESSED INTO WEEDY BRASSICA RAPA. CROSSES WERE MADE BETWEEN TRANSGENIC B. NAPUS AND WILD B. RAPA FROM DENMARK. F-1 PROGENY WERE BACKCROSSED TO B. RAPA AND BC1 PLANTS WERE SELECTED FOR CHROMOSOME NUMBERS SIMILAR TO B. RAPA. FURTHER BACKCROSSING RESULTED IN A BC2 GENERATION THAT WAS HEMIZYGOUS FOR HERBICIDE RESISTANCE. WE QUANTIFIED THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF 457 BC3 PROGENY REPRESENTING SIX FULL-SIB FAMILIES RAISED IN GROWTH ROOMS (PLANTS WERE POLLINATED BY CAPTIVE BUMBLEBEES). POLLEN FERTILITY AND SEED PRODUCTION OF BC3 PLANTS WERE AS GREAT AS THOSE OF B. RAPA RAISED IN THE SAME GROWTH ROOMS. SEGREGATION FOR HERBICIDE RESISTANCE IN BC3 PLANTS WAS 1:1 OVERALL, BUT THE FREQUENCY OF RESISTANT PROGENY WAS LOWER THAN EXPECTED IN ONE FAMILY AND HIGHER THAN EXPECTED IN ANOTHER. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TRANSGENIC AND NONTRANSGENIC PLANTS IN SURVIVAL OR THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PER PLANT, INDICATING THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSGENE ARE PROBABLY NEGLIGIBLE.

THE LEVEL OF NATURALLY OCCURRING VARIATION IN POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES OVER SPACE AND TIME WILL DICTATE THE SAMPLING EFFORT REQUIRED TO DETECT HUMAN-INDUCED CHANGES. WE COMPILED A SET OF EXISTING SURVEYS OF THE BEE FAUNAS OF NATURAL COMMUNITIES FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO EXAMINE PATTERNS OF ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. WE FOCUSED ON A SUBSET OF THESE STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE VARIATION IN BEE COMMUNITIES AMONG DIFFERENT SITES AND WITHIN SITES OVER DIFFERENT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. WE USED EXAMPLES FROM OUR COMPILATION AND OTHER PUBLISHED STUDIES TO ILLUSTRATE SAMPLING APPROACHES THAT MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF FUTURE SAMPLING EFFORTS. EXISTING STUDIES SUGGEST THAT BEE FAUNAS ARE LOCALLY DIVERSE, HIGHLY VARIABLE IN SPACE AND TIME, AND OFTEN RICH IN RARE SPECIES. ALL OF THESE ATTRIBUTES INDICATE THAT INTENSE SAMPLING AMONG SITES AND YEARS WILL BE REQUIRED TO DIFFERENTIATE CHANGES DUE TO SPECIFIC IMPACTS FROM THE NATURAL DYNAMICS OF POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES.

ECOL. MANAGE.,"NESTING HABITS OF HIGHLY SOCIAL STINGLESS BEES (MELIPONINI) WERE STUDIED IN LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FORESTS IN SABAH, BORNEO. A TOTAL OF 275 NESTS OF 12 SPECIES OF BEES WERE LOCATED. ALL NESTS WERE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING (91.5\%) OR DEAD (8.5\%) TREES, EITHER WITHIN PRE-FORMED CAVITIES IN THE TRUNK (CAVITY NESTS) OR SITUATED IN OR UNDER THE TREE BASE (BASE NESTS). SPECIES OF BEES DIFFERED IN NESTING HABIT. THE MAJORITY OF SPECIES (SEVEN) WERE CAVITY NESTERS, BUT THE MAJORITY OF NESTS (81\%) WERE BASE NESTS. NESTS WERE OFTEN AGGREGATED (MEAN OF 1.94 NESTS/NEST TREE), WITH UP TO EIGHT COLONIES AND THREE SPECIES IN A SINGLE TREE. NEST TREES WERE MOSTLY LARGE TO VERY LARGE (86.1\% ABOVE 60 CM DBH) COMMERCIAL TIMBER TREES, 47.3\% OF NEST TREES WERE DIPTEROCARPS. ACCORDING TO VISUAL INSPECTION NEST TREES WERE OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER EXPECTED TIMBER QUALITY THEN RANDOMLY CHOSEN CONTROL TREES. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INFORMATION ON TREE SPECIES, SIZE AND EXPECTED TIMBER QUALITY, WE ESTIMATED THAT 34.0 OR 42.6\% OF NEST TREES WERE POTENTIAL HARVEST TREES, DEPENDING ON HARVESTING REGULATIONS (REDUCED IMPACT LOGGING (RIL) VERSUS CONVENTIONAL). LOWER PERCENTAGES UNDER RIL GUIDELINES WERE MOSTLY DUE TO SIZE RESTRICTIONS THAT PROTECT VERY LARGE TREES (>120 CM DBH). HARVESTING IS LIKELY TO KILL BEE COLONIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESPECTIVE TREE. THEREFORE, AND BECAUSE MELIPONINE COLONIES ARE LONG-LIVED AND HAVE LOW FECUNDITY, DIRECT IMPACT FROM LOGGING MAY HAVE LASTING EFFECTS ON BEE POPULATIONS. HARVESTING GUIDELINES THAT RETAIN HIGH PROPORTIONS OF LARGE AND HOLLOW TREES SHOULD BE PROMOTED IN ORDER TO PRESERVE MELIPONINE POLLINATION IN SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT.

THE PATHOGEN CAN SPREAD BY VARIOUS MEANS, INCLUDING ON INFECTED ALFALFA SEEDS AND DEBRIS, THROUGH CONTACT BETWEEN ROOTS, ON FARM IMPLEMENTS, AND THROUGH AIR AND WATER. RECENT STUDIES IN CANADA REVEAL THAT V. ALBO-ATRUM CAN ALSO BE SPREAD BY INSECT PESTS, PREDATORS, AND POLLINATORS, AS WELL AS ALFALFA POLLEN. CERTAIN INSECTS, SUCH AS THE PEA APHID (ACYRTHOSIPHON PISUM), ALFALFA WEEVIL (HYPERA POSTICA), MIGRATORY GRASSHOPPER (MELANOPLUS SANGUINIPES), TWO-STRIPED GRASSHOPPER (MELANOPLUS BIVITTATUS), AND ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE (MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA) CAN SERVE AS VECTORS FOR EFFECTIVE TRANSMISSION OF THE PATHOGEN. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT OF INSECT VECTORS SHOULD BE A PART OF THE STRATEGY FOR CONTROL OF THIS DISEASE. BREEDING FOR DISEASE RESISTANCE IS THUS FAR THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR CONTROL OF VERTICILLIUM WILT OF ALFALFA.

HOWEVER, 75\% FROM ALL RECORDED SPECIES WERE INFREQUENT, AND DOMESTIC BEES MADE CA. 94\% OF ALL VISITS. ONE HALICTID BEE, ONE SPHECID WASP, ONE MYZINID WASP, FOUR SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUTTERFLIES AND A HAWKMOTH COMPLETED THE SET OF RELATIVELY FREQUENT INSECT VISITORS. POLLEN AND STIGMA WERE PRESENTED IN THE SAME PLACE WITHIN THE FLOWER, BUT INTERFERENCE WAS PREVENTED BY A MOVEMENT-ASSISTED, COMPLETE DICHOGAMY MECHANISM IN WHICH THE BENDING ABILITY OF THE GYNOPHORE PLAYED A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE.

MANY-FLOWERED PLANTS WITH HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS MIGHT REDUCE THE COSTS OF ATTRACTIVENESS BY ENCOURAGING FEWER SEQUENTIAL FLOWER VISITS BY POLLINATORS.

COATING THE SEEDS OF THE CULTIVATED PLANTS WITH FIPRONIL HAS PROVEN ITS EFFECTIVENESS AGAINST AGRIOTES POPULATIONS. IN THE CASE OF SUNFLOWER OR EVEN CORN, THE POSSIBLE ROOT UPTAKE OF THIS INSECTICIDE MAY LEAD TO A TOXIC EFFECT AGAINST POLLINATORS SUCH AS HONEYBEES. IN THE PRESENT REPORT, THE UPTAKE AND TRANSPORT OF FIPRONIL INSIDE THE SUNFLOWER SEEDLING WAS STUDIED IN THE LABORATORY. IN A FIRST STUDY, SUNFLOWER WAS CULTIVATED ON AN AQUEOUS MEDIUM CONTAINING FIPRONIL. AN INTENSE ROOT UPTAKE OF FIPRONIL OCCURRED, LEADING TO A TRANSPORT INTO LEAVES DEPENDING UPON TRANSPIRATION. IN A SECOND STUDY, PLANTS WERE CULTIVATED ON A SOIL IN WHICH FIPRONIL WAS UNIFORMLY DISTRIBUTED.

CONSERV.,"WE ASSESSED NATIONAL SCALE CHANGES IN THE FORAGE PLANTS OF BUMBLEBEES IN BRITAIN, AS A MEANS OF PROVIDING QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE FOR THE LIKELY PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF DECLINES IN BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. WE QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE VALUE OF NATIVE AND LONG-ESTABLISHED PLANT SPECIES AS FORAGE (NECTAR AND POLLEN) RESOURCES FOR BUMBLEBEES BY COLLATING VISITATION DATA FROM 14 FIELD SITES ACROSS BRITAIN. TWENTIETH CENTURY CHANGES IN RANGE AND FREQUENCY OF THESE FORAGE PLANTS WERE ASSESSED USING DATA FROM THE NEW ATLAS OF THE BRITISH AND IRISH FLORA (1930-1969 TO 1987-1999) AND THE COUNTRYSIDE SURVEYS OF BRITAIN (1978-1998). FORAGE PLANTS DECLINED IN BOTH LARGE-SCALE RANGE AND LOCAL-SCALE FREQUENCY BETWEEN THE TWO SURVEY PERIODS. THESE CHANGES WERE OF GREATER MAGNITUDE THAN CHANGES IN OTHER NATIVE PLANT SPECIES, REFLECTING SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN QUALITY OF FORAGING HABITATS FOR BEES AS WELL AS A GENERAL DECLINE IN INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS. SEVENTY-SIX PERCENT OF FORAGE PLANTS DECLINED IN FREQUENCY WITHIN 1-KM SQUARES, INCLUDING THOSE (E.G. TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE) OF PARTICULAR VALUE FOR THREATENED BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. WE CONSIDER HOW OUR FINDINGS RELATE TO OTHER RECORDED CHANGES IN THE BRITISH FLORA, HOW THEY MAY HELP TO EXPLAIN DECLINES IN BUMBLEBEES AND HOW THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A CONSERVATION STRATEGY.

RECENT THEORY SUGGESTS THAT A DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN POLLINATOR VISITS TO PATCHES OF PLANTS AS HETEROSPECIFIC PLANT DENSITY INCREASES (I.E. IF VISITATION IS A SIGMOID FUNCTION OF PATCH DENSITY) CAN RESCUE SPARSE POPULATIONS OF A FOCAL PLANT SPECIES FROM REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OR POPULATION DECLINE. A FIELD EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE SHAPE OF THE POLLINATOR VISITATION RESPONSE TO PATCHES OF DIFFERING DENSITY OF THE COMMON WEED BRASSICA RAPA. BOTH THE AGGREGATIVE AND FUNCTIONAL RESPONSE FOR THE ENTIRE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY WERE SATURATING RATHER THAN SIGMOID, INDICATING THAT POLLINATOR RESPONSE DOES NOT ACCELERATE WHEN DENSITY INCREASES. THE RESULTS FOR THE ENTIRE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY WERE CONSISTENT AMONG TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL REPLICATES. AGGREGATIVE RESPONSE CURVES FOR SPECIFIC POLLINATOR TAXA WERE EITHER LINEAR (BOMBYLIID FLIES) OR SATURATING (SYRPHID FLIES, SOLITARY BEES, AND LEPIDOPTERA). FUNCTIONAL RESPONSES FOR THESE TAXA WERE SATURATING (SYRPHID FLIES AND SOLITARY BEES) OR FLAT (BOMBYLIID FLIES AND LEPIDOPTERA).

TO THIS END, WE ANALYSED SNAPDRAGON FLOWERS (ANTIRRHINUM MAJUS), INCLUDING THE MIXTA AND NIVEA MUTANTS, IN CONTROLLED LABORATORY CONDITIONS USING PSYCHOPHYSICAL TESTS WITH BUMBLEBEES. THE MIXTA LOCUS CONTROLS PETAL EPIDERMAL CELL SHAPE, AND THUS THE PATH THAT INCIDENT LIGHT TAKES WITHIN THE PIGMENT-CONTAINING CELLS. THE EFFECT IS THAT MIXTA MUTANT FLOWERS ARE PINK IN COMPARISON TO THE WILD TYPE PURPLE FLOWERS, AND MUTANTS LACK THE SPARKLING SHEEN OF WILD TYPE FLOWERS THAT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE TO HUMAN OBSERVERS. DESPITE THEIR FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPEARANCE TO HUMANS, AND EVEN THOUGH BEES COULD DISCRIMINATE THE FLOWERS, INEXPERIENCED BEES EXHIBITED NO PREFERENCE FOR EITHER TYPE, AND THE FLOWERS DID NOT DIFFER IN THEIR DETECTABILITY IN A Y-MAZE-EITHER WHEN THE FLOWERS APPEARED IN FRONT OF A HOMOGENEOUS OR A DAPPLED BACKGROUND. EQUALLY COUNTERINTUITIVE EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR THE NON-PIGMENTED, UV REFLECTING NIVEA MUTANT: EVEN THOUGH THE OVERALL REFLECTANCE INTENSITY AND UV SIGNAL OF NIVEA FLOWERS IS SEVERAL TIMES THAT OF WILD TYPE FLOWERS, THEIR DETECTABILITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED RELATIVE TO WILD TYPE FLOWERS. IN ADDITION, NAIVE FORAGERS PREFERRED WILD TYPE FLOWERS OVER NIVEA MUTANTS, EVEN THOUGH THESE GENERATED A STRONGER SIGNAL IN ALL RECEPTOR TYPES.

A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED POLLINATORS TO BE IMPORTANT SELECTIVE AGENTS DRIVING THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWER SIZE AND CORRELATED TRAITS ON A LARGE SCALE. IN THIS PAPER, WE STUDIED VARIATIONS OF REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS IN SELF-INCOMPATIBLE TROLLIUS RANUNCULOIDES (RANUNCULACEAE) AMONG LOCAL HABITATS AT ALPINE MEADOW. THE RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS OF FLORAL SIZE, SEED MASS PER FRUIT AND SEX ALLOCATION (MALE/FEMALE MASS RATIO) BETWEEN DIFFERENT HABITATS, WHERE FLORAL SIZE AND SEED MASS WAS NOT EXPLAINED FULLY BY VARIATION OF PLANT SIZE AMONG HABITATS. IT SUGGESTED THAT OTHER FACTORS UNRELATED TO PLANT SIZE MIGHT ALSO INFLUENCE FLORAL VARIATION. HOWEVER, IN OUR MANIPULATED EXPERIMENT, IT SHOWED NO EFFECTS OF MANIPULATED FLORAL SIZE NOT ONLY ON VISIT RATE OF EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS (BEES AND FLIES) BUT ALSO ON FEMALE SUCCESS (SEED SET, SEED MASS PER FRUIT), IRRESPECTIVE OF FLOWER DENSITY. CONSEQUENTLY, WE COULD NOT CONCLUDE THAT THE VARIATION OF FLORAL SIZE IN T. RANUNCULOIDES WAS DUE TO PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, OR NATURAL SELECTION. BUT IF SELECTION OCCURRED, IT SHOULD NOT BE MEDIATED BY POLLINATORS. IT WAS LIKELY THAT VARIATION OF SEX ALLOCATION BETWEEN HABITATS LEAD TO CHANGES OF FLOWER OR COROLLA SIZE, BECAUSE PLANT INVESTED MUCH LESS TO MALE FUNCTION (FEMALE-BIASED SEX ALLOCATION AND LARGER SINGLE SEED MASS) IN SHADE HABITAT (BOTTOM OF BUSH) THAN OTHER EXPOSED HABITATS, TO GAIN HIGHER FITNESS.

HOWEVER POLLINATION REQUIREMENTS OF MANY CULTIVATED PLANTS REMAIN UNKNOWN. CITRUS IS COMPLEX IN TERMS OF POLLINATION NEEDS BECAUSE OF GREAT VARIATION IN BREEDING SYSTEMS AMONG AND WITHIN SPECIES, AND EVEN AMONG AND WITHIN CULTIVARS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE POLLINATOR DEPENDENCE OF THREE CULTIVERS OF GRAPEFRUIT (CITRUS PARADISI MACF.) PLANTED IN NORTHWESTERN ARGENTINA. BAGGED FLOWERING BRANCHES WERE ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT POLLINATION TREATMENTS: EMASCULATION, SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION, HAND SELF-POLLINATION, AND HAND CROSS-POLLINATION, AND THE RESULTS COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS. WE COUNTED THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS AND POLLEN TUBES IN THE STYLE, FRUIT SET, AND SEED PRO- DUCTION. WE ALSO ASSESSED DIFFERENCES IN GERMI- NATION RATES OF SELF- VS. CROSS-POLLEN GRAINS. WE FOUND THAT HAND AND OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS SET ABOUT SIX TIMES MORE FRUIT THAN EMASCULATED AND BAGGED (INSECT EXCLUDED) FLOWERS. IN ADDITION, CROSS-POLLEN PERFORMED BETTER IN TERMS OF GRAIN GERMINATION AND TUBE GROWTH THAN SELFPOLLEN.

POL.-HORTORUM CULTUS,"THE PAPER PRESENTS LITERATURE DATA ON THE FLOWERING BIOLOGY OF EGGPLANT AND THE INFLUENCE OF FLOWER HETEROSTYLY ON YIELDING. FLOWERS WITH LONG-STYLED PISTOL ARE THE MAJORITY AMONG ALL FLOWERS ON A PLANT (60\%). NUMBER OF FLOWERS WITH MEDIUM AND SHORT STYLE IS LOWER (10-15\% AND 22-30\%, RESPECTIVELY). EGGPLANTS SET FRUITS FROM FLOWERS WITH LONG STYLE IN 49-100\% AND WITH MEDIUM STYLE IN 46-85\%. THESE FLOWER'S STIGMATA HAVE WELL DEVELOPED NODULES AND WELL - PERMISSIBLE TISSUES RICH IN POLYSACCHARIDES, PROTEINS STYLED FLOWERS HAVE SMALL STIGMATA WITH UNDERDEVELOPED NODULES AND, DUE TO WORSE ABSORPTION, THEY ARE NOT POLLINATED AND DO NOT SET FRUITS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE COMPLEXITY OF MANY FACTORS THAT MAKE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO SELF-POLLINATE THE EGGPLANT'S FLOWERS, THE EFFICIENCY OF THREE PROCEDURES INTENSIFYING THE FRUIT BUDDING HAS BEEN PRESENTED: BUNCH VIBRATING, FLOWER HARMONIZATION, AND NATURAL POLLINATING BY BUMBLEBEES. MANY AUTHORS' STUDIES CONFIRM THAT FLOWER BUNCH VIBRATING HAS NOT CAUSED SUFFICIENT POLLEN SETTING ON STOMATA AND HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT FOR GOOD EGGPLANT FLOWER POLLINATION.

J. PLANT SCI.,"BOTH THE NUMBER AND THE DENSITY OF FLOWERING PLANTS IN A POPULATION CAN BE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND BEHAVIOR. WE REPORT THE JOINT EFFECTS OF POPULATION SIZE AND DENSITY ON POLLINATOR VISITATION AND POLLINATION SUCCESS FOR LUPINUS PERENNIS (FABACEAE). FOCUSING ON FIVE PAIRS OF POPULATIONS, WE MATCHED ONE SMALL POPULATION (125-800 FLOWERING PLANTS) WITH ONE DISTINCTLY LARGER POPULATION (1000-3000 FLOWERING PLANTS). IN THESE PAIRS, POPULATION SIZE DID NOT AFFECT POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES OR POLLINATION SUCCESS. ALL MEASURES OF POLLINATION SUCCESS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH DENSITY. ONLY BEE BEHAVIOR (NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED PER INFLORESCENCE) EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION OF SIZE AND DENSITY. TESTING WHETHER POPULATION SIZES SMALLER THAN THOSE IN THE PAIRED POPULATIONS MIGHT AFFECT POLLINATION, WE GATHERED POLLEN TUBE SAMPLES FROM 14 UNPAIRED POPULATIONS (16-215 FLOWERING PLANTS). COMBINING THESE DATA WITH THOSE FROM THE PAIRED POPULATIONS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN POLLINATION FOR SMALLER POPULATIONS, INDICATING THAT EFFECTS OF POPULATION SIZE MAY BE DETECTABLE ONLY WHEN POPULATIONS SMALLER THAN A FEW HUNDRED PLANTS ARE SAMPLED. WE FOUND THAT EFFECTS OF DENSITY ARE CONSISTENT AND MUCH STRONGER THAN THOSE OF POPULATION SIZE.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"FORAGING RANGE, AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF BEE ECOLOGY, IS OF CONSIDERABLE INTEREST FOR INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS BECAUSE IT DETERMINES THE POTENTIAL FOR OUTCROSSING AMONG INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN FLOW IS DIFFICUIT TO ASSESS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE PLANT ALSO RELIES ON SELF-POLLINATION. POLLEN MOVEMENT CAN BE ESTIMATED INDIRECTLY THROUGH POPULATION GENETIC DATA, BUT COMPLEMENTARY DATA ON POLLINATOR FLIGHT DISTANCES IS NECESSARY TO VALIDATE SUCH ESTIMATES. BY USING RADIO-TRACKING OF COWPEA POLLINATOR RETURN FLIGHTS, WE FOUND THAT CARPENTER BEES VISITING COWPEA FLOWERS CAN FORAGE UP TO 6 KM FROM THEIR NEST. FORAGING DISTANCES WERE FOUND TO BE SHORTER THAN THE MAXIMUM FLIGHT RANGE, ESPECIALLY UNDER ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR POOR REWARD LEVELS. FROM COMPLETE FLIGHT RECORDS IN WHICH BEES VISITED WILD AND DOMESTICATED POPULATIONS, WE CONCLUDE THAT BEES CAN MEDIATE GENE FLOW AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, ALLOW TRANSGENE (GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIAL) ESCAPE OVER SEVERAL KILOMETERS.

HYVONEN T;HUUSELA-VEISTOLA E,HYVONEN T,ARABLE WEEDS AS INDICATORS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSITY - A CASE STUDY FROM FINLAND,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BIOL. CONSERV.,"THE STUDY AIMED AT DEVELOPING AN AGRO-BIODIVERSITY INDICATOR BASED ON TROPHIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN 25 COMMON ARABLE WEEDS AND INDIVIDUAL GROUPS OF FARMLAND BIRDS, POLLINATORS (WILD BEES), PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS AND INSECT PESTS. EACH WEED SPECIES WAS WEIGHTED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF REPORTED LINKAGES WITH EACH ANIMAL GROUP. FOUR BIODIVERSITY INDICES BASED ON THESE WEIGHTS WERE CONSTRUCTED AND APPLIED TO EXPLORING THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF LONG-TERM CHANGES IN WEED POPULATIONS IN FINLAND. DATA WERE USED FROM WEED SURVEYS OF FINNISH SPRING CEREAL FIELDS CONDUCTED IN THE 1960S, 1980S AND 1990S. THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF WEED SPECIES VARIED ACCORDING TO ANIMAL GROUPS. ANNUAL WEED SPECIES ABLE TO PRODUCE NUMEROUS SEEDS WERE IMPORTANT FOR THE FARMLAND BIRDS AND SOME PERENNIAL WEED SPECIES WERE IMPORTANT FOR THE POLLINATORS. THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LINKAGES WAS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN WEED SPECIES AND PHYTOPHAGOUS INSECTS. THE NUMBER OF HARMFUL PEST SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD-LEAVED WEEDS WAS LOW FOR ALL SPECIES. THE GENERAL PATTERN OF CHANGES IN VALUES OF INDICES OVER RECENT DECADES WAS SIMILAR: THERE WAS A MARKED DECLINE IN THE VALUES BETWEEN THE 1960S AND THE 1980S, AND A SLIGHT INCREASE BETWEEN THE 1980S AND THE 1990S. THESE CHANGES WERE REGARDED AS BEING A CONSEQUENCE OF CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY OF AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. THE SLOWEST RECOVERY OF THE VALUES WAS FOR POLLINATORS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF CHANGES IN THE INTENSITY OF AGRICULTURE CAN BE EXPLORED WITH THE AID OF A BIODIVERSITY INDICATOR BASED ON SPECIES INTERACTIONS. OWING TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE IMPORTANCE OF WEED SPECIES FOR DIFFERENT ANIMAL GROUPS, MAINTAINING WEED SPECIES RICHNESS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR THE HIGHER TROPHIC LEVELS IN FARMLAND.

THIRTY PERCENT OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN PLECTRANTHUS SPECIES HAVE COROLLA TUBES THAT ARE BENT TO SOME DEGREE. POLLINATION OF THE FOLLOWING FOUR LABIATE SPECIES WITH SIGMOID COROLLAS WAS STUDIED IN DETAIL: PLECTRANTHUS PETIOLARIS, P. LAXIFLORUS, P. CALYCINUS AND PYCNOSTACHYS URTICIFOLIA. THE POLLINATION OF THREE OTHER SPECIES WAS INVESTIGATED TO A LESSER DEGREE: PLECTRANTHUS SPICATUS, P. REHMANNII AND AEOLLANTHUS PARVIFOLIUS. BEE POLLINATION IS CONFIRMED FOR P. LAXIFLORUS AND PY. URTICIFOLIA AND IS RECORDED HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN P. PETIOLARIS AND P. CALYCINUS. A NEW GROUP OF FLORAL VISITORS COMPRISING NEMESTRINID FLIES OF THE GENUS PROSOECA WITH MODERATELY LONG PROBOSCIDS IS RECORDED FOR P. LAXIFLORUS AND P.

HERE, EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS IN A LIVING FOSSIL PLANT NELUMBO NUCIFERA (NELUMBONACEAE) WERE EXAMINED TO TEST WHETHER BEETLES ARE MAJOR POLLINATORS AS PREDICTED BY ITS POLLINATION SYNDROME. POLLINATORS OF N. NUCIFERA WERE INVESTIGATED IN 11 WILD POPULATIONS AND ONE CULTIVATED POPULATION, AND POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE POLLINATING ROLE OF TWO MAJOR POLLINATORS (BEES AND BEETLES) IN THREE POPULATIONS. LOTUS FLOWERS ARE PROTOGYNOUS, BOWL SHAPED AND WITHOUT NECTAR. THE FRAGRANT FLOWERS CAN BE SELF-HEATING DURING ANTHESIS AND PRODUCE AROUND 1 MILLION POLLEN GRAINS PER FLOWER.

WE INVESTIGATED THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY OSMIA CORNIFRONS RADOSZKOWSKI, IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEIR USE INSTEAD OF HONEYBEES. O. CORNIFRONS SHOWED STRONG FLOWER CONSTANCY FOR 4-8 MIN DURING ONE POLLEN-NECTAR FORAGING TRIP, AS OBSERVED IN HONEYBEES. HOWEVER, THE BEES SEEMED TO FORAGE FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOWERS, E.G. FROM A RED TO A WHITE PETAL COLOR, DURING THEIR 16-22 POLLEN-NECTAR FORAGING TRIPS BASED ON THE S-RNASE ALLELE AND SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT (SSR) ANALYSES OF POLLEN LOAVES MADE DURING THOSE TRIPS. AFTER ONE POLLEN-NECTAR FORAGING TRIP, THE BEES BRUSHED THEIR ABDOMEN WITH THEIR HIND LEGS AT A NESTER TUBE, BUT CA. 10\% OF POLLEN WAS NOT BRUSHED FROM THEIR BODIES. THE REMAINING POLLEN ON THE BODY RETAINED THE ABILITY FOR THE FERTILIZATION OF APPLE FOR 12 DAYS, SUGGESTING THAT THE POLLEN ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY FROM A POLLINIZER COULD BE USED FOR THE FERTILIZATION OF A COMMERCIAL CULTIVAR VISITED ON THEIR NEXT FORAGING TRIP.

MONOGR.,"THE CONCEPT OF SELECTION MOSAIC IS CENTRAL TO THE GEOGRAPHIC MOSAIC THEORY OF COEVOLUTION. MOST INFORMATION ON COEVOLVING INTERACTIONS, HOWEVER, COMES FROM SPECIALIZED ORGANISMS. IN CONTRAST, AN ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECT OF GEOGRAPHICALLY VARYING EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS ON THE EVOLUTION OF GENERALIST ORGANISMS IS LACKING, ALTHOUGH THESE KINDS OF ORGANISMS ARE THE MOST FREQUENT IN NATURE. IN FLOWERING PLANTS, POLLINATORS AND HERBIVORES ARE IMPORTANT SELECTIVE AGENTS. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE WHETHER A GEOGRAPHIC SELECTION MOSAIC FOR. ORAL TRAITS IN A GENERALIST PLANT, ERYSIMUM MEDIOHISPANICUM (BRASSICACEAE), CAN BE MEDIATED BY THE INTERPLAY OF MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTING ORGANISMS. IN EIGHT POPULATIONS WE QUANTIFIED THE SELECTION EXERTED BY THESE ORGANISMS ON SEVERAL PLANT TRAITS. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT SPATIAL VARIATION IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE. IN DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, THE MAIN POLLINATORS BELONGED TO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (BEEFLIES, LARGE BEES, SMALL BEES, AND BEETLES). DAMAGE BY UNGULATES ALSO VARIED AMONG POPULATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, WE FOUND THAT DIFFERENT POPULATIONS WERE UNDER DIFFERENT SELECTIVE REGIMES, AND THE TRAITS AFFECTED BY SELECTION DEPENDED ON THE LOCAL INTERACTION INTENSITY WITH POLLINATORS AND MAMMAL HERBIVORES. SOME TRAITS, SUCH AS FLOWER NUMBER AND STALK HEIGHT, WERE SELECTED SIMILARLY IN MOST POPULATIONS. OTHER TRAITS, SUCH AS COROLLA DIAMETER AND TUBE LENGTH, WERE SELECTED ONLY IN SOME POPULATIONS. FINALLY, WE FOUND DIVERGENT SELECTION FOR SOME TRAITS, SUCH AS COROLLA TUBE WIDTH AND COROLLA SHAPE, WHICH WERE SELECTED IN CONTRASTING DIRECTIONS IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES. THIS SPATIAL VARIATION IN SELECTIVE SCENARIOS RESULTS IN POPULATIONS WITH STRONG SELECTIVE REGIMES (HOT SPOTS) INTERMINGLED WITH POPULATIONS WITH WEAK SELECTIVE REGIMES (COLD SPOTS). FOUR IMPORTANT OUTCOMES EMERGE FROM THE E. MEDIOHISPANICUM SELECTION MOSAIC. (1) INTERACTIONS WITH GENERALIST ORGANISMS MAY PRODUCE STRONG SELECTION. (2) SPATIAL CHANGES IN MAIN POLLINATORS RESULT IN DIVERGENT SELECTION ACROSS POPULATIONS. (3) GEOGRAPHIC MOSAICS DEPEND ON A BALANCE BETWEEN MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION. (4) SELECTION MOSAICS OPERATE AT FAIRLY SMALL SPATIAL SCALES.

INCREASING POLLEN-LOAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FRUIT PER PLANT IN THE FOUR MELON CULTIVARS OVER TWO GROWING SEASONS, AND IN TWO NON-PARTHENOCARPIC CUCUMBERS, BUT HAD NO EFFECT ON ALL FOUR SQUASH CULTIVARS. IN MOST CASES, INCREASING POLLEN-LOAD INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FULLY-DEVELOPED SEEDS, DECREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF EMPTY SEEDS, AND TENDED TO DECREASE MEAN SEED WEIGHTS. ON AVERAGE, MELONS PRODUCED 2.2 FRUITS PER PLANT IN THE WINTER, AND ONLY 0.9 FRUITS PER PLANT IN THE AUTUMN. IN CONTRAST, MELONS PRODUCED 275 FULLY-DEVELOPED SEEDS PER FRUIT IN THE AUTUMN, BUT ONLY 57 SEEDS IN THE WINTER. MEAN MELON SEED WEIGHT WAS HIGHER IN AUTUMN, AND THE SUM OF ALL SEED YIELD COMPONENT EFFECTS RESULTED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SEED YIELD PER PLANT IN THE AUTUMN. GERMINABILITY OF MELON SEEDS FROM THE AUTUMN SEASON, AND OF SQUASH SEEDS FROM THE WINTER SEASON, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY POLLEN-LOAD TREATMENT. THESE DATA ARE CONTRARY TO THE THEORY THAT MICROGAMETOPHYTE COMPETITION HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THE VIGOUR OF THE PROGENY. THE LOWER GERMINABILITY OF MELON SEEDS OBTAINED BY PASSIVE POLLINATION (I.E., SELF-POLLINATION IN COVERED FLOWERS) MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT POLLINATION WITHOUT INSECT OR HUMAN INTERFERENCE YIELDED ONLY A FEW SEEDS PER FRUIT, AND, UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE MAY BE A SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE FOR SLOW AND DISTRIBUTED GERMINATION.",NA,CUCURBITA-PEPO; POLLINATION INTENSITY; ZUCCHINI SQUASH; HONEY-BEE; SET; COMPETITION; PERFORMANCE; POPULATION; NUMBER; VIGOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"NERSON, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), AGR RES ORG, DEPT VEGETABLE CROPS, NEWE YAAR RES CTR, POB 1021, IL-30095 RAMAT YISHAY, ISRAEL.;AGR RES ORG, DEPT VEGETABLE CROPS, NEWE YAAR RES CTR, IL-30095 RAMAT YISHAY, ISRAEL.",10.1080/14620316.2009.11512566,"INVICTA PRESS, ASHFORD TN24 8HH, KENT, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,1462-0316,5,560-566,HEADLEY BROTHERS LTD,84,2009,ISI000272389600017,21,AGRICULTURE,27,HORTICULTURE,HNERSONVOLCANI.AGRI.GOV.IL,527TO,"NERSON, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), AGR RES ORG, DEPT VEGETABLE CROPS, NEWE YAAR RES CTR, POB 1021, IL-30095 RAMAT YISHAY, ISRAEL",ISI,none,NEWE YAAR RES CTR,NEWE YAAR RES CTR,NA,"NERSON H, 2009, J HORTICULT SCI BIOTECHNOL","NERSON H, 2009, J HORTICULT SCI BIOTECHNOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

BY INTRODUCING TWO POTTED PLANT SPECIES (SALVIA FARINACAE AND TAGETES BONANZA) INTO TWO POPULATIONS OF TARAXACUM OFFICINALE, WE INVESTIGATED HOW PLANT IDENTITY, THE MIXTURES OF THESE PLANT SPECIES, AND TOTAL PLANT DENSITY AFFECTED THE ATTRACTION TO AND THE FORAGING WITHIN A PATCH FOR SIX POLLINATOR GROUPS. 3. THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY OF THE PREFERRED PLANT SPECIES, AND SECONDLY BY PATCH DIVERSITY AND DENSITY. IN GENERAL, DENSE PATCHES AND THOSE CONTAINING THE THREE-SPECIES MIXTURE WERE PREFERRED BY ALL INSECT GROUPS FOR ARRIVAL, ALTHOUGH MUSCOID AND HOVER FLIES RESPONDED LESS TO LOCAL FLORAL COMPOSITION THAN BEES. LOCAL DIVERSITY AND DENSITY HAD, HOWEVER, A WEAKER EFFECT ON FORAGING BEHAVIOUR WITHIN PATCHES. SITE DEPENDENCE IN RESPONSE TO FLORAL TREATMENTS COULD BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SITES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE AND TARAXACUM DENSITY. 4.

BIOL.,"THE SURFACE OF SOME INSECT EYES CONSISTS OF ARRAYS OF CUTICULAR PROTUBERANCES, WHICH ARE 50-300. NM IN DIAMETER, AND ARE TERMED CORNEAL NIPPLES OR OMMATIDIA GRATINGS. THEY WERE WIDELY REPORTED TO REDUCE THE REFLECTANCE FOR NORMALLY INCIDENT LIGHT, CONTRIBUTING TO CAMOUFLAGE BY REDUCING GLARE TO PREDATORS, WHILE FURTHERMORE ENHANCING THE INTAKE OF LIGHT, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR NOCTURNAL INSECTS. OUR PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST A THIRD FUNCTION: IN CONTRAST TO THE REST OF THE BODY, OMMATIDIA OF VARIOUS INSECTS REMAIN CLEAN, EVEN IN A HEAVY CONTAMINATED ENVIRONMENT. IN ORDER TO PROVE SUCH AN ANTI-CONTAMINATION HYPOTHESIS OF THESE STRUCTURES, WE MEASURED THE ADHESIVE PROPERTIES OF POLYMER MOULDS OF INSECT OMMATIDIA, AND COMPARED THESE DATA WITH CONTROL SURFACES HAVING THE SAME CURVATURE RADII BUT LACKING SUCH A NANOSTRUCTURE. A SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM) STUDY AND FORCE MEASUREMENTS USING AN ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE (AFM) ON THE EYE SURFACES OF THREE DIFFERENT INSECT SPECIES, DRAGONFLY AESHNA MIXTA (ODONATA), MOTH LAOTHOE POPULI (LEPIDOPTERA) AND FLY VOLUCELLA PELLUCENS (DIPTERA), WERE UNDERTAKEN. WE REVEALED THAT ADHESION IS GREATLY REDUCED BY CORNEAL GRATING IN L. POPULI AND V. PELLUCENS WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR SMOOTH CONTROLS. THE SMOOTH CORNEA OF A. MIXTA SHOWED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE TO ITS CONTROL. WE ASSUME THAT THIS ANTI-ADHESIVE PHENOMENON IS DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE REAL CONTACT AREA BETWEEN CONTAMINATING PARTICLES AND THE EYE'S SURFACE. SUCH A COMBINATION OF THREE FUNCTIONS IN ONE NANOSTRUCTURE CAN BE INTERESTING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRIAL MULTIFUNCTIONAL SURFACES CAPABLE OF ENHANCING LIGHT HARVESTING WHILE REDUCING LIGHT REFLECTION AND ADHESION.",ANTI-ADHESION; ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY (AFM); CONTACT AREA; OMMATIDIA GRATINGS; CORNEAL NIPPLES; INSECTS; JKR MODEL; SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE (SEM),SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; BEES APOIDEA; COMPOUND EYE; ADHESION; MOVEMENTS; CONTACT; ENERGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,30,"PEISKER, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHRISTIAN ALBRECHT UNIV KIEL, DEPT FUNCT MORPHOL \& BIOMECH, BOT GARTEN 1-9, D-24098 KIEL, GERMANY.;PEISKER, HENRIK, CHRISTIAN ALBRECHT UNIV KIEL, DEPT FUNCT MORPHOL \& BIOMECH, D-24098 KIEL, GERMANY.;MAX PLANCK INST MET RES, EVOLUTIONARY BIOMAT GRP, D-70569 STUTTGART, GERMANY.",10.1242/JEB.043661,"BIDDER BUILDING, STATION RD, HISTON, CAMBRIDGE CB24 9LF, ENGLAND",NA,GERMAN SCIENCE FOUNDATION DFGGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [GO 995/4-1]; ECEUROPEAN COMMISSION JOINT RESEARCH CENTREEUROPEAN COMMUNITY (EC) [ERAS-CT-2003-980409],"SINCERE THANKS TO CHRISTIAN LOBBE (JPK INSTRUMENTS, BERLIN, GERMANY) FOR HIS PERMANENT SUPPORT AND HELP IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP.

PLANT SCI.,"IN MANY INSECT-POLLINATED ANGIOSPERMS, STAMENS ARE GROWN WITH ANTHERS COHERED, WHICH MIGHT AFFECT POLLINATION PROCESSES, BUT THE ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS FUSION OF ANTHERS REMAINS UNEXPLORED. WE STUDIED THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND POLLINATION PROCESS OF DIDYNAMOUS CAMPSIS GRANDIFLORA (BIGNONIACEAE), WITH ANTHER FUSION IN PAIRS. POLLEN REMOVAL AND DEPOSITION WERE STUDIED IN THE FIELD FOR NATURALLY FUSED VERSUS EXPERIMENTALLY SEPARATED ANTHERS. CAMPSIS GRANDIFLORA FLOWERS WERE PROTANDROUS, WITH A LOW POLLEN : OVULE RATIO, WERE MOSTLY OUTCROSSED, AND WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE, WITH POLLINATORS NEEDED. THE MAIN POLLINATORS WERE POLLEN-COLLECTING HALICTID BEES AND NECTAR-FEEDING VESPID WASPS. HALICTID BEES SCOOPED POLLEN ON LONG ANTHERS FOR A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER TIME PERIOD AND REMOVED TWICE AS MUCH POLLEN FROM FUSED ANTHERS THAN FROM SEPARATED ANTHERS. VESPID WASPS CONTACTED FUSED SHORT ANTHERS MORE FREQUENTLY AND MORE PRECISELY AND REMOVED NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH POLLEN THAN WHEN CONTACTING SEPARATED SHORT ANTHERS. POLLEN DEPOSITION ON STIGMAS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY MANIPULATION OF EITHER PAIR OF ANTHERS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANTHER FUSION CAN PROMOTE POLLEN REMOVAL EFFICIENCY BY AGGREGATING ANTHERS AT A SIMILAR POSITION, INCREASING THE POLLINATOR'S CONTACT PROBABILITY AND PRECISION WITH ANTHERS AND EXTENDING THE VISIT DURATION OF THE POLLINATOR. THE MAINTENANCE OF DIDYNAMOUS STAMENS MAY REFLECT FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE FUSED ANTHERS IN TWO DISTINCT HEIGHTS BECAUSE THEY CAN INTERACT WITH POLLINATORS OF DIFFERENT BEHAVIORS AND SIZES.",ANTHER FUSION; BREEDING SYSTEM; CAMPSIS GRANDIFLORA; DIDYNAMOUS STAMENS; POLLEN : OVULE RATIO; STIGMA CLOSURE,ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS; FLORAL EVOLUTION; OVULE RATIOS; BIGNONIACEAE; DISPERSAL; MECHANISM; RADICANS; SUCCESS; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"REN, MX (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, WUHAN BOT GARDEN, KEY LAB AQUAT BOT \& WATERSHED ECOL, WUHAN 430074, PEOPLES R CHINA.;REN, MING-XUN, TANG, JING-YU, CHINESE ACAD SCI, WUHAN BOT GARDEN, KEY LAB AQUAT BOT \& WATERSHED ECOL, WUHAN 430074, PEOPLES R CHINA.;REN, MING-XUN, BEIJING NORMAL UNIV, MOE KEY LAB BIODIVERS SCI \& ECOL ENGN, BEIJING 100875, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1086/650157,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [30700089, 30970459]; MOE KEY LABORATORY FOR BIODIVERSITY SCIENCE AND ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING [K0801]","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO PROFESSOR HUAN-LI XU FOR INSECT IDENTIFICATION AND THANK PROFESSOR SPENCER C.

HERE, WE CONDUCTED A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF FLORAL CORRELATES OF HETERANTHERY - THE MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION OF ANTHERS WITHIN FLOWERS - AMONG ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES TO IDENTIFY TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION. WE PERFORMED A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF CORRELATED EVOLUTION BETWEEN HETERANTHERY AND SEVERAL FLORAL TRAITS COMMONLY REPORTED FROM HETERANTHEROUS TAXA. IN ADDITION, WE QUANTIFIED THE EFFECT OF PHYLOGENETIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE OBSERVED PATTERNS OF CORRELATED EVOLUTION BY COMPARING TREES IN WHICH POLYTOMOUS BRANCHES WERE RANDOMLY RESOLVED. HETERANTHERY IS REPORTED FROM 12 ANGIOSPERM ORDERS AND IS PHYLOGENETICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABSENCE OF FLORAL NECTARIES, BUZZ-POLLINATION AND ENANTIOSTYLY (MIRROR-IMAGE FLOWERS). THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE ROBUST TO PARTICULARITIES OF THE UNDERLYING PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESIS. HETERANTHERY HAS PROBABLY EVOLVED AS A RESULT OF POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION AND APPEARS TO FUNCTION TO REDUCE THE CONFLICT OF RELYING ON POLLEN BOTH AS FOOD TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS AND AS THE AGENT OF MALE GAMETE TRANSFER.

MORRIS WF;VAZQUEZ DP;CHACOFF NP,MORRIS WF,BENEFIT AND COST CURVES FOR TYPICAL POLLINATION MUTUALISMS,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"MUTUALISMS PROVIDE BENEFITS TO INTERACTING SPECIES, BUT THEY ALSO INVOLVE COSTS. IF COSTS COME TO EXCEED BENEFITS AS POPULATION DENSITY OR THE FREQUENCY OF ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN SPECIES INCREASES, THE INTERACTION WILL NO LONGER BE MUTUALISTIC. THUS CURVES THAT REPRESENT BENEFITS AND COSTS AS FUNCTIONS OF INTERACTION FREQUENCY ARE IMPORTANT TOOLS FOR PREDICTING WHEN A MUTUALISM WILL TIP OVER INTO ANTAGONISM. CURRENTLY, MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT BENEFIT AND COST CURVES IN POLLINATION MUTUALISMS COMES FROM HIGHLY SPECIALIZED POLLINATING SEED-CONSUMER MUTUALISMS, SUCH AS THE YUCCA MOTH-YUCCA INTERACTION. THERE, BENEFITS TO FEMALE REPRODUCTION SATURATE AS THE NUMBER OF VISITS TO A FLOWER INCREASES (BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN NEEDED TO FERTILIZE ALL THE FLOWER'S OVULES IS FINITE), BUT COSTS CONTINUE TO INCREASE (BECAUSE POLLINATOR OFFSPRING CONSUME DEVELOPING SEEDS), LEADING TO A PEAK IN SEED PRODUCTION AT AN INTERMEDIATE NUMBER OF VISITS. BUT FOR MOST PLANT-POLLINATOR MUTUALISMS, COSTS TO THE PLANT ARE MORE SUBTLE THAN CONSUMPTION OF SEEDS, AND HOW SUCH COSTS SCALE WITH INTERACTION FREQUENCY REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, WE PRESENT REASONABLE BENEFIT AND COST CURVES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TYPICAL POLLINATOR-PLANT INTERACTIONS, AND WE SHOW HOW THEY CAN RESULT IN A WIDE DIVERSITY OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN NET BENEFIT (BENEFIT MINUS COST) AND INTERACTION FREQUENCY. WE THEN USE MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD METHODS TO FIT NET-BENEFIT CURVES TO MEASURES OF FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS FOR THREE TYPICAL POLLINATION MUTUALISMS FROM TWO CONTINENTS, AND FOR EACH SYSTEM WE CHOSE THE MOST PARSIMONIOUS MODEL USING INFORMATION-CRITERION STATISTICS.

BIOGEOGR.,"AIM TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF ISOLATION AND SIZE OF SMALL TROPICAL ISLANDS ON SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES OF BEES (SUPERFAMILY APOIDEA) AND WASPS (SUPERFAMILY VESPOIDEA). LOCATION TWENTY ISLANDS IN THE KEPULAUAN SERIBU ARCHIPELAGO OFF THE COAST OF WEST JAVA, INDONESIA. THE SIZE OF SURVEYED ISLANDS RANGES BETWEEN 0.75 AND 41.32 HA, THEIR DISTANCE FROM THE COAST OF JAVA VARIES BETWEEN 3 AND 62 KM. METHODS FIELD WORK WAS CONDUCTED FROM FEBRUARY TO MAY 2005. BEES AND WASPS WERE CAUGHT WITH A SWEEP NET DURING SAMPLING UNITS OF 15 MIN, CONTINUING UNTIL FOUR CONSECUTIVE SAMPLES REVEALED NO NEW SPECIES. TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS WAS QUANTIFIED BY THE ESTIMATORS CHAO 2, FIRST-ORDER JACKKNIFE AND MICHAELIS-MENTEN. THE SOFTWARE BINMATNEST WAS USED TO TEST FOR NESTEDNESS OF SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES. SIMILARITIES OF SPECIES COMPOSITION BETWEEN ISLANDS WERE QUANTIFIED BY S CIRCLE DIVIDE RENSEN'S SIMILARITY INDEX. RESULTS EIGHTY-TWO SPECIES WERE RECORDED ON THE 20 SURVEYED ISLANDS. SPECIES RICHNESS DECLINED WITH INCREASING ISOLATION OF ISLANDS FROM THE SOURCE AREA, JAVA. ALTHOUGH THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST ISLAND EXCEEDED THAT OF THE SMALLEST ISLAND BY A FACTOR OF ALMOST 60, ISLAND SIZE ONLY VERY WEAKLY AFFECTED SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEES, NO EFFECT OF ISLAND SIZE WAS FOUND FOR WASPS. MEAN BODY SIZE OF SPECIES DECREASED WITH INCREASING ISLAND ISOLATION. NESTEDNESS OF ISLAND FAUNAS WAS ONLY WEAKLY DEVELOPED. SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BOTH SUPERFAMILIES WAS AFFECTED BY ISLAND ISOLATION, BUT NOT BY ISLAND SIZE. MAIN CONCLUSIONS WHILE THE SPECIES-ISOLATION RELATIONSHIP ON THE VERY SMALL ISLANDS OF KEPULAUAN SERIBU FOLLOWED THE PREDICTION OF MACARTHUR AND WILSON'S EQUILIBRIUM THEORY, THE ABSENCE OF A SPECIES-AREA RELATIONSHIP INDICATED A WEAK `SMALL-ISLAND EFFECT', AT LEAST IN WASPS. THE COMBINATION OF AN ONLY WEAKLY DEVELOPED PATTERN OF NESTED SPECIES SUBSETS, THE SHIFT IN SPECIES COMPOSITIONS AND THE DECLINE OF MEAN BODY SIZE WITH INCREASING ISLAND ISOLATION FROM THE SOURCE AREA INDICATES THAT BIOTIC INTERACTIONS AND DIFFERENT SPECIES TRAITS CONTRIBUTE TO THE SHAPING OF COMMUNITIES OF BEES AND WASPS WITHIN THE ARCHIPELAGO.

ENTOMOL. RES.,"THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES ENSURES THE DELIVERY OF POLLINATION SERVICES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM DIVERSITY. AS PREVIOUS STUDIES CARRIED OUT IN CENTRAL EUROPE AND THE US HAVE SHOWN, BEE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE IS INFLUENCED BY THE STRUCTURE AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. COMPARABLE STUDIES HAVE SO FAR NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES THE INFLUENCE OF MEDITERRANEAN LANDSCAPE CONTEXT ON THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES. TO DO THIS, WE SAMPLED BEES IN 13 SITES IN OLIVE GROVES ON LESVOS ISLAND, GREECE. BEES WERE ASSIGNED TO FIVE CATEGORIES CONSISTING OF THREE BODY SIZE GROUPS (SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE BEES), THE SINGLE MOST ABUNDANT BEE SPECIES (LASIOGLOSSUM MARGINATUM) AND ALL SPECIES COMBINED. THE INFLUENCE OF THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT ON BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS WAS ASSESSED AT FIVE RADII (250, 500, 750, 1000 AND 1250 M) FROM THE CENTRE OF EACH SITE. WE FOUND THAT THE ABUNDANCE WITHIN BEE GROUPS WAS INFLUENCED DIFFERENTLY BY DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS AND LAND COVERS, WHEREAS SPECIES RICHNESS WAS UNAFFECTED. GENERALLY, SMALLER BEES' ABUNDANCE WAS IMPACTED BY LANDSCAPE PARAMETERS AT SMALLER SCALES AND LARGER BEES AT LARGER SCALES. THE LAND COVER THAT INFLUENCED BEE ABUNDANCE POSITIVELY WAS OLIVE GROVE, WHILE PHRYGANA, CONIFER FOREST, BROAD-LEAVED FOREST, CULTIVATED LAND, ROCK, URBAN AREAS AND SEA HAD MOSTLY NEGATIVE OR NO IMPACT.

FLOWERING INVASIVE PLANT SPECIES THAT ARE VISITED BY NATIVE INSECTS AND OVERLAP WITH NATIVE PLANT SPECIES IN THEIR POLLINATORS MAY FACILITATE OR DISRUPT NATIVE FLOWER VISITATION AND FERTILISATION BY FORMING LARGE, DENSE POPULATIONS WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF FLOWERS AND COPIOUS REWARDS. WE INVESTIGATED THE DIRECTION OF SUCH A PROPOSED EFFECT FOR THE ALIEN INVASIVE RHODODENDRON PONTICUM IN IRISH HABITATS. FLOWER VISITATION, CONSPECIFIC AND ALIEN POLLEN DEPOSITION, FRUIT AND SEED SET WERE MEASURED IN A SELF-COMPATIBLE NATIVE FOCAL PLANT, DIGITALIS PURPUREA, AND COMPARED BETWEEN FIELD SITES THAT CONTAINED DIFFERENT RELATIVE ABUNDANCES OF R. PONTICUM. FLOWER VISITATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AT HIGHER ALIEN RELATIVE PLANT ABUNDANCES THAN AT LOWER ABUNDANCES OR IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ALIEN. NATIVE FLOWERS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CONSPECIFIC POLLEN DEPOSITION WITH INCREASING ALIEN ABUNDANCE. HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER WAS VERY LOW IN ALL FIELD SITES BUT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING RELATIVE R. PONTICUM ABUNDANCE. HOWEVER, LOWER FLOWER VISITATION AND LOWER CONSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER DID NOT ALTER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF D. PURPUREA. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT INDIRECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ALIEN AND NATIVE PLANTS FOR POLLINATION CAN BE MODIFIED BY POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (SUCH AS RELATIVE ABUNDANCE) IN A SIMILAR WAY AS INTERACTIONS AMONG NATIVE PLANT SPECIES. IN D. PURPUREA, ONLY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTION WERE AFFECTED BY HIGH ALIEN ABUNDANCES WHICH IS PROBABLY A RESULT OF HIGH RESILIENCE DUE TO A SELF-COMPATIBLE BREEDING SYSTEM.

HUMAN ACTIVITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREST FRAGMENTATION TEND ALSO TO CHANGE THE INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REMNANT PATCHES, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THE CREATION OF GAPS BY SELECTIVE LOGGING. WHILE EDGES AND GAPS CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE COMPARABLE CHANGES IN THE MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE FOREST, THEIR EFFECTS ON FOREST-DWELLING SPECIES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECT OF FOREST EDGES AND ANTHROPOGENIC GAPS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE EPIPHYTIC PLANT (MITRARIA COCCINEA), MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MUTUALISTS (POLLINATORS) AND ANTAGONISTS (FLOWER LARCENISTS). MITRARIA COCCINEA'S FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY HUMMINGBIRDS AND ROBBED BY THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII. EDGES AND GAPS HAD COMPARABLE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON FLOWER PRODUCTION AND FRUIT SET, HOWEVER, NECTAR ROBBING WAS UP TO SEVENFOLD HIGHER IN PATCHES WITH NUMEROUS GAPS AND RESULTED IN LOWER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRUIT SET AND TOTAL FRUIT CROP). FOREST FRAGMENTATION STUDIES SHOULD THEREFORE AVOID TREATING FOREST REMNANTS AS HOMOGENEOUS UNITS (I.E. FOCUSING EXCLUSIVELY ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND CONNECTIVITY), WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INTERNAL HETEROGENEITY CAUSED BY ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES (E.G.

MICROCOLONIES SHOWED A DOSE-DEPENDENT DECLINE IN FECUNDITY, WITH ENVIRONMENTALLY REALISTIC DOSAGES IN THE RANGE OF 1 MU G L-1 CAPABLE OF REDUCING BROOD PRODUCTION BY ONE THIRD. IN CONTRAST, OVARY DEVELOPMENT WAS UNIMPAIRED BY DIETARY IMIDACLOPRID EXCEPT AT THE HIGHEST DOSAGE. IMIDACLOPRID REDUCED FEEDING ON BOTH SYRUP AND POLLEN BUT, AFTER CONTROLLING STATISTICALLY FOR DOSAGE, MICROCOLONIES THAT CONSUMED MORE SYRUP AND POLLEN PRODUCED MORE BROOD.

MOST STUDIES ON BEES HAVE DEFINED HABITAT FRAGMENTS AS REMNANT PATCHES OF FLORAL HOSTS OR FORESTS, OVERLOOKING THE NESTING NEEDS OF BEES. THEIR CONCLUSION IS THAT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION IS BROADLY DELETERIOUS, HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONTRASTING RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE. INSIGHTFUL STUDIES ON HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND BEES SHOULD CONSIDER FRAGMENTATION, ALTERATION AND LOSS OF NESTING HABITATS-NOT JUST PATCHES OF FORAGE PLANTS -, AS WELL AS THE PERMEABILITY OF THE SURROUNDING MATRIX TO INTERPATCH MOVEMENT. HERE WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF FRAGMENTATION CAUSED BY URBANIZATION ON STINGLESS BEE SPECIES' COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS, AS WELL AS THE PERMEABILITY OF THE SURROUNDING MATRIX. WE COLLECTED BEES FROM FLOWERING PLANTS AND RECORDED PHYTOSOCIOLOGICAL VARIABLES OF FIVE FOREST REMNANTS (RANGING FROM 64 HA TO 900 HA) IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. LARGE FRAGMENTS DID NOT CONTAIN MORE SPECIES PER UNIT AREA THAN SMALLER ONES, IN FACT, WE FOUND MORE SPECIES IN SMALL FRAGMENTS, MOST OF WHICH WERE GENERALIST BEES. THE PRESENCE OF MORE HABITAT GENERALIST STINGLESS BEE SPECIES WAS ALSO CORRELATED TO THE STRUCTURE OF VEGETATION IN THESE FRAGMENTS. IN CONCLUSION, THE QUALITY OF THE HABITAT WITHIN A FRAGMENT (STRUCTURE OF VEGETATION) AS WELL AS THE QUALITY OF THE MATRIX HAS A DIRECT RELATION TO THE BEE SPECIES COMPOSITION. THIS CAN BE SEEN IN THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRUCTURAL DIVERSITY OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND AGE OF THE FRAGMENTS. THE MATRIX THAT HOLDS THE MOST RECENT FRAGMENTS, PROBABLY DUE TO THE SPRAWL OF THE CITY, IS MORE HETEROGENEOUS THAN THE ONE WITH THE OLDEST FRAGMENTS. THE MOST HETEROGENEOUS MATRICES HAVE A CERTAIN BALANCE BETWEEN THE TREES, BUILDINGS AND BARE SOIL OR HERBACEOUS VEGETATION COVERAGE, MAKING THE ARRAY LESS IMPERMEABLE TO BEES.",NA,HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; SPECIES RICHNESS; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; NESTING HYMENOPTERA; CONSERVATION; RESPONSES; ECOLOGY; MATRIX; URBANIZATION; CONSEQUENCES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"ANTONINI, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED OURO PRETO, DEPT BIODIVERSIDADE EVOLUCAO \& MEIO AMBIENTE, BR-35400000 OURO PRETO, MG, BRAZIL.",10.1007/S11252-012-0281-0,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,NA,1083-8155,3,527-541,SPRINGER,16,2013,ISI000323220800009,53,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, URBAN STUDIES",85,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, URBAN STUDIES",ANTONINI.YGMAIL.COM,202MK,"ANTONINI, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED OURO PRETO, DEPT BIODIVERSIDADE EVOLUCAO \& MEIO AMBIENTE, BR-35400000 OURO PRETO, MG, BRAZIL",ISI,none,NA,UNIV FED OURO PRETO,NA,"ANTONINI Y, 2013, URBAN ECOSYST","ANTONINI Y, 2013, URBAN ECOSYST",NA,NA,NA,NA

NECTAR IS PRODUCED IN THE FLORAL TRICHOMATOUS NECTARIES LOCATED ON A PROJECTION OF THE ADAXIAL, BASAL PART OF THE SEPALS. THERE WERE TWO TYPES OF NON-GLANDULAR HAIRS ON THE SEPALS, THE FIRST ONE TO PREVENT THE NECTAR FROM FLOWING OUT BEYOND THE SEPAL AND THE OTHER TYPE TO PROTECT THE NECTARY ITSELF. THE CLAVATE SECRETORY TRICHOMES, FORMING DENSE CLUSTERS, ARE COMPOSED OF A BASE, STALK, AND MULTICELLULAR HEAD. THE SECRETORY CELLS OF THE TRICHOME HEAD CONTAIN A THICK CYTOPLASM AND A LARGE NUCLEUS, THEY ARE ALSO CHARACTERIZED BY A LOW DEGREE OF VACUOLATION. NECTAR ACCUMULATES AT THE TIP OF THE TRICHOME IN THE SPACE FORMED BETWEEN THE CELL WALL OF THE HEAD CELLS AND THE CUTICLE.

ENTOMOL.,"WITH GROWING CONCERN SURROUNDING GLOBAL POLLINATOR DECLINES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION IMPACT POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. EUGLOSSINE BEES ARE TROPICAL FOREST-DEPENDENT POLLINATORS RESPONSIBLE FOR POLLINATION OF BOTH ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT CROPS AND WILD PLANT SPECIES. A GROWING BODY OF WORK HAS FOCUSED ON THE EFFECT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON EUGLOSSINE BEES, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THESE BEES ARE IMPACTED BY AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. COFFEE CULTIVATION IS WIDESPREAD IN THE TROPICS, AND ITS MANAGEMENT IS CONDUCTED ALONG A GRADIENT OF INTENSITY, WHICH RANGES FROM MONOCULTURE (I.E., NO SHADE, HIGH INPUTS) TO POLYCULTURE (SHADE OVERSTORY RETAINED, FEWER INPUTS). WE USED A LANDSCAPE IN SOCONUSCO, CHIAPAS, MEXICO, THAT ALLOWED FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN MONOCULTURE AND POLYCULTURE COFFEE FARMS, WHILE HOLDING DISTANCE TO NATIVE HABITAT, AS WELL AS NATIVE HABITAT QUALITY, CONSTANT. WE FOUND THAT HABITAT MANAGEMENT INFLUENCED ABUNDANCE, ESTIMATED RICHNESS, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF EUGLOSSINE BEES. THE POLYCULTURE COFFEE FARM BOASTS A MORE SIMILAR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION TO THE FOREST THAN TO THE MONOCULTURE COFFEE FARM. IN ADDITION, THE POLYCULTURE FARM HAD ALMOST DOUBLE THE EUGLOSSINE ABUNDANCE COMPARED WITH THE MONOCULTURE FARM.

THIS WAS A FOLLOW-UP SURVEY CONDUCTED APPROXIMATELY ONE DECADE AFTER THE FIRST STUDY, BY HEARD AND DOLLIN IN 1998/99. IT SHOWED THAT THE AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY HAD GROWN OVER THE PAST TEN OR SO YEARS BUT IS STILL UNDERDEVELOPED. THERE WAS A 2.5-FOLD INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BEE KEEPERS AND A 3.5 FOLD INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DOMESTICATED COLONIES. SEVENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF BEE KEEPERS WERE HOBBYISTS, 54\% OF WHOM OWNED ONLY ONE COLONY. MOST COLONIES WERE KEPT IN SUBURBAN AREAS. TWO SPECIES, TETRAGONULA CARBONARIA AND AUSTROPLEBEIA AUSTRALIS, DOMINATED THE RELATIVELY SHORT LIST OF SPECIES KEPT. THERE WAS A HIGH DEMAND FOR AUSTRALIAN STINGLESS BEE COLONIES AND THEIR HONEY, BUT WITH LESS THAN 250 BEE KEEPERS CURRENTLY PROPAGATING COLONIES, AND MANY OF THEM ON A SMALL SCALE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO MEET THIS DEMAND.

CHEM. ECOL.,"PLANT SECONDARY METABOLITES (PSMS), SUCH AS ALKALOIDS, ARE OFTEN FOUND IN MANY PARTS OF A PLANT, INCLUDING FLOWERS, PROVIDING PROTECTION TO THE PLANT FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF HERBIVORES OR MICROBES. PSMS ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE FLORAL NECTAR OF MANY SPECIES, BUT TYPICALLY AT LOWER CONCENTRATIONS THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PLANT. NECTAR ROBBERS OFTEN DAMAGE FLORAL TISSUE TO ACCESS THE NECTAR. BY DOING SO, THESE NECTAR ROBBERS MAY INITIATE AN INCREASE OF PSMS IN THE FLORAL NECTAR. IT IS OFTEN ASSUMED THAT IT TAKES AT LEAST A FEW HOURS BEFORE THE PLANT DEMONSTRATES AN INCREASE IN PSMS. HERE, WE ADDRESSED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER PSMS IN THE FLORAL TISSUE ARE IMMEDIATELY BEING RELEASED INTO THE FLORAL NECTAR FOLLOWING NECTAR ROBBING. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH QUESTION, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF NECTAR ROBBING BY THE PALESTINE SUNBIRD (NECTARINIA OSEA) ON THE CONCENTRATION OF NECTAR ALKALOIDS, NICOTINE AND ANABASINE, IN TREE TOBACCO (NICOTIANA GLAUCA). WE FOUND THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF ANABASINE, BUT NOT NICOTINE, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN FLORAL NECTAR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING SIMULATED NECTAR ROBBING. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT NECTAR ROBBERS COULD BE INGESTING GREATER AMOUNTS OF PSMS THAN THEY WOULD IF THEY VISIT FLOWERS LEGITIMATELY.

KUDO G,KUDO G,VULNERABILITY OF PHENOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY BETWEEN PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IN AN ALPINE ECOSYSTEM,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,ECOL. RES.,"THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND ABUNDANCE OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) WAS INVESTIGATED USING 2 YEARS OF PHENOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED IN AN ALPINE REGION OF NORTHERN JAPAN. ABUNDANCE OF BOMBUS SPECIES WAS OBSERVED ALONG A FIXED TRANSECT THROUGHOUT THE FLOWERING SEASON. THE NUMBER OF FLOWERING SPECIES WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS AT THE COMMUNITY SCALE. IN THE YEAR WITH TYPICAL WEATHER, THE FIRST FLOWERING PEAK CORRESPONDED TO THE EMERGENCE TIME OF QUEEN BEES FROM HIBERNATION, WHILE THE SECOND FLOWERING PEAK CORRESPONDED TO THE ACTIVE PERIOD OF WORKER BEES. IN THE YEAR WITH AN UNUSUALLY WARM SPRING, HOWEVER, PHENOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY BETWEEN PLANTS AND BEES WAS DISRUPTED. ESTIMATED EMERGENCE OF QUEEN BEES WAS 10 DAYS EARLIER THAN THE FIRST FLOWERING DATE OWING TO EARLIER SOIL THAWING AND WARMING. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT WORKER EMERGENCE WAS DELAYED, INDICATING SLOWER COLONY DEVELOPMENT. THE FLOWERING SEASON FINISHED 2 WEEKS EARLIER IN THE WARM-SPRING YEAR IN RESPONSE TO EARLIER SNOWMELT. A COMMON RESIDENT SPECIES IN THE ALPINE ENVIRONMENT, B. HYPOCRITA SAPPOROENSIS, FLEXIBLY RESPONDED TO THE YEARLY FLUCTUATION OF FLOWERING. IN CONTRAST, POPULATION DYNAMICS OF OTHER BOMBUS SPECIES WERE OUT OF SYNCHRONY WITH THE FLOWERING: THEIR FREQUENCIES WERE HIGHEST AT THE END OF THE FLOWERING SEASON IN THE WARM-SPRING YEAR. THEREFORE, PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH BETWEEN FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS IS EVIDENT DURING WARM YEARS, WHICH MAY BECOME MORE PREVALENT IN A WARMER CLIMATE.

THE PRESENT STUDY ON REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF PITTOSPORUM DASYCAULON, A RARE MEDICINAL TREE, WAS CONDUCTED IN THE SHOLA FORESTS OF VAGHAMON HILLS, ONE OF THE FOOT HILLS OF SOUTHERN WESTERN GHATS OF INDIA FROM 2008-2011. RESULTS: THE PLANT FLOWERS PROFUSELY DURING FEBRUARY TO APRIL. INFLORESCENCE IS A RACEME AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE VARIES FROM 96-217. THE FLOWERS ARE COMPARATIVELY SMALL, HERMAPHRODITE, SHORT PEDICELLATE, COMPLETE, ZYGOMORPHIC, PENTAMEROUS, POLYPETALOUS, HYPOGYNOUS AND LIGHT CREAM IN COLOUR WITH AN AVERAGE LENGTH OF 1.14 CM. ANTHESIS STARTED AT 08.30 H AND THE FLOWERS WERE COMPLETELY OPENED AT APPROXIMATELY 09.30 H FOLLOWED BY ANTHER DESHISCENCE AT 10.00-11.30 H. THE POLLEN GRAINS WERE TRIZONOCOLPATE WITH 45 +/- 5.6 MU M IN SIZE. ACETOCARMINE STAINING SHOWED 66 +/- 6\% FERTILE POLLEN AT THE TIME OF ANTHER DEHISCENCE. THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS IN AN ANTHER IS 5246 +/- 845 AND PER FLOWER IS 26230 +/- 1021. THE STIGMA IS WET, NON-PAPILLATE, CAPITATE AND CONTAINS A THIN FILM OF EXUDATES UNDER THE LIGHT MICROSCOPE. THE SUPERIOR OVARY IS DENSELY COVERED WITH PAPILLATE HAIRS AND CONTAINING 3-8 OVULES. THE IMPORTANT FLORAL VISITORS INCLUDE BEES AND BUTTERFLIES. THE PLANT IS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND AN OUT CROSSER.

SPECIFICALLY, INVASION MAY ALTER ABUNDANCE AND COMPOSITION OF LOCAL FLORAL RESOURCES, AFFECTING POLLINATOR VISITATION AND ULTIMATELY CAUSING SEEDSET OF NATIVES IN MORE-INVADED AND LESS-INVADED FLORAL NEIGHBORHOODS TO DIFFER. SUCH POLLINATOR-MEDIATED EFFECTS OF EXOTIC PLANTS ON NATIVES ARE COMMON, BUT NATIVE AND EXOTIC PLANTS OFTEN SHARE MULTIPLE POLLINATORS, WHICH MAY DIFFER IN THEIR RESPONSES TO ALTERED FLORAL NEIGHBORHOODS. WE QUANTIFIED POLLINATOR-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THREE COMMON FORBS OF WESTERN WASHINGTON PRAIRIES (NATIVE MICROSERIS LACINIATA AND ERIOPHYLLUM LANATUM AND EUROPEAN HYPOCHAERIS RADICATA) IN THREE FLORAL NEIGHBORHOODS: 1) HIGH NATIVE AND LOW EXOTIC FLORAL DENSITY, 2) HIGH EXOTIC FLORAL DENSITY AND LOW NATIVE DENSITY, AND 3) EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED LOW EXOTIC FLORAL DENSITY. POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES VARIED BY FLORAL NEIGHBORHOOD, PLANT SPECIES IDENTITY, AND THEIR INTERACTION FOR ALL THREE PLANT SPECIES. SIMILARLY, POLLINATOR FUNCTIONAL GROUPS (EUSOCIAL BEES, SOLITARY BEES, AND SYRPHID FLIES) CONTRIBUTED DIFFERING PROPORTIONS OF TOTAL VISITATION TO EACH SPECIES DEPENDING UPON NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT. CONSEQUENTLY, IN EXOTIC NEIGHBORHOODS H. RADICATA COMPETED WITH NATIVE M. LACINIATA, REDUCING SEED SET, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY FACILITATING VISITATION AND SEED SET FOR NATIVE E. LANATUM. SEED SET OF H.

JACQUEMYN H;BRYS R;HUTCHINGS MJ,JACQUEMYN H,BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1. THIS ACCOUNT PRESENTS INFORMATION ON ALL ASPECTS OF THE BIOLOGY OF EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS (L.) CRANTZ THAT ARE RELEVANT TO UNDERSTANDING ITS ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEHAVIOUR. THE MAIN TOPICS ARE PRESENTED WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE BIOLOGICAL FLORA OF THE BRITISH ISLES: DISTRIBUTION, HABITAT, COMMUNITIES, RESPONSES TO BIOTIC FACTORS, RESPONSES TO ENVIRONMENT, STRUCTURE AND PHYSIOLOGY, PHENOLOGY, FLORAL AND SEED CHARACTERISTICS, HERBIVORES AND DISEASE, HISTORY, AND CONSERVATION. 2. EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS IS NATIVE TO BRITAIN, BEING WIDELY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT ENGLAND AND WALES, BUT IS LESS COMMON IN THE NORTH. ALTHOUGH ABSENT FROM MOST OF SCOTLAND, IT OCCURS AS FAR NORTH AS PERTHSHIRE. IT IS WIDELY DISTRIBUTED IN IRELAND. THE SPECIES EXTENDS THROUGHOUT MOST OF EUROPE, OCCURRING AS FAR EAST AS MONGOLIA AND THE NORTH OF TURKEY, BUT IT IS ABSENT FROM THE SOUTHERN MEDITERRANEAN REGION. 3. EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS GROWS MAINLY IN FULL SUNLIGHT, RARELY UNDER SHADE, AND ON CALCAREOUS, BUT NUTRIENT-POOR, MOIST TO WET SUBSTRATES. IT FAVOURS FLUSHED OR SEASONALLY INUNDATED AREAS IN WHICH THE INTENSITY OF COMPETITION FROM OTHER VEGETATION IS LOW. IT IS MOST COMMONLY FOUND IN WET DUNE SLACKS, CALCAREOUS FENS AND ON PEAT, BUT IT ALSO OCCURS ON SANDY SUBSTRATES OVERLYING HEAVY CLAY OR LOAMY SOILS. OCCASIONALLY, IT CAN ALSO BE FOUND NEAR THE TOP OF SLOPES IN CHALK DOWNLAND. 4. EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS MULTIPLIES BOTH BY VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION AND SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION INVOLVES THE PRODUCTION OF REGULARLY BRANCHED RHIZOMES. IT FLOWERS IN BRITAIN FROM THE END OF JUNE UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER. THE FLOWERS PRODUCE NECTAR, WHICH IS OFTEN COLONIZED BY BACTERIA AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BY YEASTS. THE SPECIES IS POLLINATED BY A WIDE RANGE OF INSECTS, INCLUDING HONEYBEES, FLIES, WASPS, BEETLES, BUMBLEBEES AND ANTS, BUT IS ALSO CAPABLE OF LIMITED SPONTANEOUS AUTOGAMY. THE MOST EFFICIENT POLLINATORS ARE SMALL BEES AND SOLITARY WASPS. FRUIT PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY HIGH (>80\% OF THE FLOWERS PRODUCE CAPSULES). 5. EPIPACTIS PALUSTRIS IS VULNERABLE TO CHANGES IN SOIL WATER LEVEL AND TO SUBSTRATE NUTRIENT ENRICHMENT. IT HAS SUFFERED A STRONG DECLINE IN ITS DISTRIBUTION RANGE IN BRITAIN, WITH MOST LOSSES OF LOCAL POPULATIONS OCCURRING BEFORE 1930. HABITAT DESTRUCTION AND DRAINAGE OF MARSHES AND FENS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST COMMON CAUSES FOR THE DECLINE OF THE SPECIES. RESTORATION OF OLD WET DUNE SLACKS BY TOPSOIL REMOVAL AND ADDITION OF HAY FROM NEIGHBOURING VEGETATION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ENCOURAGING COLONIZATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF POPULATIONS OF THE SPECIES WITHIN A FEW YEARS. CESSATION OF DRAINING OF MIRES MAY ALSO PROMOTE THE LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF POPULATIONS OF THE SPECIES.",CONSERVATION; DISPERSAL; DUNE SLACKS; EPIPACTIS; GERMINATION; MYCORRHIZA; ORCHIDACEAE; POLLINATION; SEED CHARACTERISTICS,ORCHIDACEAE; VEGETATION; NECTAR; RESTORATION; NETHERLANDS; GERMINATION; POLLINATION; DIVERSITY; FEN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"JACQUEMYN, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN, ARENBERGPK 31, B-3001 HEVERLEE, BELGIUM.;JACQUEMYN, HANS, KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN, B-3001 HEVERLEE, BELGIUM.;BRYS, REIN, RES INST NAT \& FOREST, B-1070 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;HUTCHINGS, MICHAEL J., UNIV SUSSEX, SCH LIFE SCI, BRIGHTON BN1 9QG, E SUSSEX, ENGLAND.",10.1111/1365-2745.12287,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC)EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC) [260601-MYCASOR],"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK TONY DAVY AND FOUR REFEREES FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS ON PREVIOUS DRAFTS OF THIS MANUSCRIPT.

HEGLAND SJ,HEGLAND SJ,FLORAL NEIGHBOURHOOD EFFECTS ON POLLINATION SUCCESS IN RED CLOVER ARE SCALE-DEPENDENT,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS ARE HIGHLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ITS DIRECT LINK TO PLANT FITNESS AND BECAUSE SUCH INTERACTIONS INVOLVE SPECIES AT DIFFERENT TROPHIC LEVELS. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF COMPETITIVE AND FACILITATIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG PLANTS FOR POLLINATION IS OF LARGE IMPORTANCE TO GOVERN CONSERVATION OF SPECIES AND MANAGEMENT OF CROP PRODUCTION. STILL WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE SCALE DEPENDENCY OF PLANT-PLANT INTERACTIONS FOR POLLINATOR VISITATION WHICH IS CENTRAL TO BOTH BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY. HERE, I TESTED WHETHER PLANT-PLANT INTERACTIONS FOR BUMBLEBEE VISITATION AND SUBSEQUENT REPRODUCTION WERE SCALE-DEPENDENT BY STUDYING THE ECOLOGICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE) AND ITS FLORAL NEIGHBOURHOOD. I EXPECTED THAT HIGH FLORAL DENSITIES AT SMALL SCALE COULD TRIGGER FACILITATIVE INTERACTIONS DUE TO CONCENTRATION EFFECTS OF POLLINATORS. THIS WAS EXPECTED TO CHANGE INTO COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS WHEN FLORAL DENSITIES BECAME HIGHER AT COARSER SCALES BECAUSE OF DILUTION EFFECTS. I ALSO EXPECTED THAT INCREASED BUMBLEBEE VISITATION WOULD INCREASE FRUIT PRODUCTION IN RED CLOVER. THE INTERACTION FOR POLLINATION SUCCESS IN RED CLOVER APPEARED TO BE SCALE-DEPENDENT IN THE LANDSCAPE UNDER STUDY. AT PLOT SCALE, THE BUMBLEBEE VISITATION RATE TO RED CLOVER INFLORESCENCES INCREASED WITH BOTH INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC FLORAL DENSITY, INDICATING FACILITATIVE INTERACTION FOR POLLINATOR VISITATION AMONG RED CLOVER FLOWERS AND ITS NEAREST FLORAL NEIGHBOURHOOD. INCREASED VISITATION OF BUMBLEBEES LED TO SUBSEQUENT INCREASED FRUIT SET, BUT THERE WAS A SATURATING EFFECT AS FRUIT SET DID NOT INCREASE WHEN VISITATION RATES EXCEEDED A CERTAIN LEVEL. AS THE FLORAL NEIGHBOURHOOD BECAME DENSER AT A COARSER SCALE, THE INTERACTIONS FOR POLLINATOR VISITATION CHANGED TOWARDS COMPETITION. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT KEY ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES SUCH AS PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS MAY INDEED BE SCALE-DEPENDENT AND THAT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF COMPETITION AND FACILITATION AMONG PLANTS FOR ATTRACTING POLLINATORS MAY CHANGE WITH SCALE. THE DENSITY OF THE FLORAL NEIGHBOURHOOD OF A FOCAL SPECIES (E.G. KEY-, RARE-, CROP SPECIES) MAY THUS BE OF LARGE IMPORTANCE FOR ITS POLLINATION AND FRUIT PRODUCTION. MY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INCREASING FLORAL DENSITIES AT FINE SCALES MAY HAVE FACILITATIVE EFFECTS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION TO RED CLOVER, WHEREAS POLLINATORS MAY BE DRAWN AWAY WHEN FLORAL RESOURCES BECOME DENSER AT COARSER SCALE.",LANDSCAPE; REPRODUCTION; FRUIT SET; POLLEN LIMITATION; VISITATION RATE; TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE; CROP; MAGNET SPECIES; POLLINATION; BUMBLEBEES,WILD BEE POLLINATORS; SEED-SET; PLANT COMMUNITY; FRUIT-SET; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; POPULATION-DENSITY; BUMBLE BEES; DIVERSITY; FACILITATION; VISITATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,28,"HEGLAND, SJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN RED DEER CTR, N-6914 SVANOYBUKT, NORWAY.;HEGLAND, STEIN J., NORWEGIAN RED DEER CTR, N-6914 SVANOYBUKT, NORWAY.;HEGLAND, STEIN J., UNIV COLL SOGN \& FJORDANE, FAC SCI, N-5801 SOGNDAL, NORWAY.",10.1111/1365-2435.12223,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,0269-8463,3,561-568,WILEY,28,2014,ISI000335954900003,50,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,139,ECOLOGY,STEIN.JOAR.HEGLANDHISF.NO,AH2MF,"HEGLAND, SJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN RED DEER CTR, N-6914 SVANOYBUKT, NORWAY",ISI,none,NORWEGIAN RED DEER CTR;UNIV COLL SOGN AND FJORDANE,NORWEGIAN RED DEER CTR,NA,"HEGLAND SJ, 2014, FUNCT ECOL","HEGLAND SJ, 2014, FUNCT ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

HOW AND WHY THIS POLLINATION SYSTEM HAS EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY ON MULTIPLE CONTINENTS REMAINS UNKNOWN, ALTHOUGH PREADAPTATION IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT. UNDERSTANDING THE CHEMISTRY OF SEXUAL DECEPTION IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP TOWARDS SOLVING THIS MYSTERY. THE COMBINATION OF GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-ELECTROANTENNOGRAPHIC DETECTION (GC-EAD), GC-MS, SYNTHESIS AND FIELD BIOASSAYS ALLOWED US TO IDENTIFY THE VOLATILES INVOLVED IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE ORCHID DRAKAEA GLYPTODON AND ITS SEXUALLY ATTRACTED MALE THYNNINE WASP POLLINATOR, ZASPILOTHYNNUS TRILOBATUS. THREE ALKYLPYRAZINES AND ONE NOVEL HYDROXYMETHYL PYRAZINE WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE SEX PHEROMONE OF Z. TRILOBATUS AND ARE ALSO USED BY D. GLYPTODON FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION.

WITH ONE EXCEPTION, OUR CHEMICAL SURVEY FAILED TO DETECT PYRAZINES IN RELATED GENERA. COLLECTIVELY, NO EVIDENCE FOR PREADAPTATION WAS FOUND. THE CHEMISTRY OF SEXUAL DECEPTION IS MORE DIVERSE THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN.

THEIR RESEMBLANCE TO A FLOWER HAS GIVEN RISE TO THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY ARE FLOWER MIMICS. HOWEVER, FLORAL MIMICRY AS A PREDATORY STRATEGY, AND IN PARTICULAR, HOW PREDATORY FLORAL MIMICRY FUNCTIONS AT A MECHANISTIC LEVEL IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TWO MAIN MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE THOUGHT TO MAKE ORCHID MANTISES APPEAR SIMILAR TO FLOWERS AND THUS ATTRACTIVE TO POLLINATORS: (1) THEIR FLOWER-LIKE' WHITE COLOURATION AND (2) THEIR PETAL-SHAPED' EXPANSIONS OF EXOSKELETON ON THEIR MID-FEMUR AND HIND FEMUR (FEMORAL LOBES). I INVESTIGATED THE CONTRIBUTION OF THESE COLOUR AND SHAPE CHARACTERISTICS TO POLLINATOR ATTRACTION USING ARTIFICIAL ORCHID MANTIS MODELS. MODELS WITH THE FLOWER-LIKE' WHITE COLOURATION OF THE ORCHID MANTIS HAD HIGHER RATES OF POLLINATOR INSPECTION THAN BROWN MODELS. MANIPULATING OVERALL BODY SHAPE BY REMOVING OR CHANGING THE ORIENTATION OF THE PETAL-SHAPED' FEMORAL LOBES DID NOT AFFECT THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF MODELS. AS CERTAIN FLOWER-LIKE CHARACTERISTICS (SYMMETRY AND PETALS) DID NOT AFFECT THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF MODELS, POLLINATORS MAY NOT NECESSARILY COGNITIVELY MISCLASSIFY ORCHID MANTISES AS FLOWERS. RATHER, MANTISES MAY BE EXPLOITING SENSORY BIASES OF THEIR POLLINATOR PREY, AND THEIR UV-ABSORBING WHITE COLOURATION MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO LURE POLLINATORS.

ENTOMOL.,"NATIVE PLANTS ATTRACTIVE TO BENEFICIAL INSECTS MAY IMPROVE THE VALUE OF BUFFER STRIPS BY INCREASING BIODIVERSITY AND ENHANCING THE DELIVERY OF INSECT-DERIVED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. IN A 2-YR FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE MEASURED THE RESPONSE OF INSECT COMMUNITIES ACROSS NINE BUFFERS THAT VARIED IN PLANT DIVERSITY. WE CONSTRUCTED BUFFERS WITH PLANTS COMMONLY FOUND IN BUFFERS OF USDA-CERTIFIED ORGANIC FARMS IN IOWA (TYPICALLY A SINGLE SPECIES), RECOMMENDED FOR PRAIRIE RECONSTRUCTION, OR RECOMMENDED FOR ATTRACTING BENEFICIAL INSECTS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS WILL BE 1) GREATEST IN BUFFERS COMPOSED OF DIVERSE PLANT COMMUNITIES WITH CONTINUOUS AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES, 2) INTERMEDIATE IN BUFFERS WITH REDUCED SPECIES RICHNESS AND AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES, AND 3) LOWEST IN BUFFERS COMPOSED OF A SINGLE SPECIES. WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF BENEFICIAL INSECTS WITH PLANT COMMUNITY DIVERSITY AND THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS. MORE BENEFICIAL INSECTS WERE COLLECTED IN BUFFERS COMPOSED OF SPECIES SELECTED FOR THEIR ATTRACTIVENESS TO BENEFICIAL INSECTS THAN A COMMUNITY RECOMMENDED FOR PRAIRIE RESTORATION.

SYDENHAM MAK;MOE SR;TOTLAND O;ELDEGARD K,SYDENHAM MAK,DOES MULTI-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL AND PHYLOGENETIC COMPOSITION OF WILD BEE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES?,ECOGRAPHY,ECOGRAPHY,"A CENTRAL GOAL IN ECOLOGY IS TO DEVELOP THEORIES THAT EXPLAIN THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES. THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF SPECIES AND THEIR FUNCTIONAL TRAITS MAY PROVIDE MECHANISTIC LINKS BETWEEN COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SUCH LINKS MAY BE HIERARCHICALLY STRUCTURED SUCH THAT THE STRENGTH OF ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERING DECREASES IN A STEP-WISE MANNER FROM REGIONAL CONDITIONS THROUGH LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY TO LOCAL HABITAT CONDITIONS. WE SAMPLED THE WILD BEE SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES IN POWER-LINE STRIPS TRANSECTING FORESTS IN SOUTH-EASTERN NORWAY. WE USED ALTITUDE, LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY SURROUNDING SITES AND PLANT SPECIES COMPOSITION, TOGETHER WITH TOTAL PLANT COVER AS PROXIES FOR REGIONAL, LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES DECREASED WITH ALTITUDE. THE REDUCTION IN SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY A PHYLOGENETIC CLUSTERING OF WILD BEE INDIVIDUALS. FURTHERMORE, REGIONAL FILTERS FOLLOWED BY LOCAL FILTERS BEST EXPLAINED THE STRUCTURE OF THE FUNCTIONAL SPECIES COMPOSITION. SITES AT HIGH ALTITUDES AND SITES WITH ERICACEAE-DOMINATED PLANT COMMUNITIES TENDED TO HAVE LARGER BEES AND A HIGHER PROPORTION OF SOCIAL AND SPRING-EMERGING BEES. WHEN BOMBUS SPECIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANALYSIS, THE PROPORTION OF POLLEN SPECIALISTS INCREASED WITH THE DOMINANCE OF ERICACEAE. FURTHERMORE, WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE TAXONOMIC, PHYLOGENETIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITIONAL TURNOVER BETWEEN SITES WAS HIGHER IN THE NORTHERN REGION THAN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STUDY REGION. ALTOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REGIONAL FILTERS DRIVE THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN TRAIT-GROUPS WHEREAS LOCAL FILTERS HAVE MORE DESCRETE SORTING EFFECTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MODEL OF MULTI-LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL FILTERS PROVIDES A GOOD CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR COMMUNITY ECOLOGY. WE SUGGEST THAT FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BIOGEOGRAPHICAL HISTORY OF SPECIES AND THEIR CURRENT DISTRIBUTION, AND ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES DO INDEED COMPETE MORE INTENSELY THAN DISTANTLY RELATED SPECIES.",NA,COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES; FORAGING RANGES; SOLITARY BEES; DIVERSITY; TRAITS; EVOLUTION; HYMENOPTERA; SCALE; DIVERSIFICATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"SYDENHAM, MAK (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN UNIV LIFE SCI, DEPT ECOL \& NAT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, POB 5003, NO-1432 AS, NORWAY.;SYDENHAM, MARKUS ARNE KJAER, MOE, STEIN R., TOTLAND, ORJAN, ELDEGARD, KATRINE, NORWEGIAN UNIV LIFE SCI, DEPT ECOL \& NAT RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NO-1432 AS, NORWAY.",10.1111/ECOG.00938,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,STATNETT,"WE WISH TO THANK DAG SLETTEBO, ARE ENDAL ROGNES, ADRIAN RASMUSSEN, HAKON CELIUS, LISBETH NORDTILLER, TORBJORN KORNSTAD, MORTEN MELAND, MARTE LILLEENG, RONNY STEEN AND JOHN GUNNAR DOKK FOR FIELD AND LABORATORY ASSISTANCE.

HERE, THE IMPACT OF THREE REDUCED-RISK INSECTICIDES - AZADIRACHTIN, SPINOSAD AND CHLORANTRANILIPROLE - WAS ASSESSED IN TWO SPECIES OF STINGLESS BEES, PARTAMONA HELLERI AND SCAPTOTRIGONA XANTHOTRICA, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT NATIVE POLLINATORS IN NEOTROPICAL AMERICA. THE NEONICOTINOID IMIDACLOPRID WAS USED AS A POSITIVE CONTROL. SPINOSAD EXHIBITED HIGH ORAL AND CONTACT TOXICITIES IN ADULT WORKERS OF BOTH SPECIES AT THE RECOMMENDED LABEL RATES, WITH MEDIAN SURVIVAL TIMES (LT(50)S) RANGING FROM 1 TO 4 H, WHEREAS THESE ESTIMATES WERE BELOW 15 MIN FOR IMIDACLOPRID. AZADIRACHTIN AND CHLORANTRANILIPROLE EXHIBITED LOW TOXICITY AT THE RECOMMENDED LABEL RATES, WITH NEGLIGIBLE MORTALITY THAT DID NOT ALLOW LT50 ESTIMATION. SUBLETHAL BEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENTS OF THESE TWO INSECTICIDES INDICATED THAT NEITHER ONE OF THEM AFFECTED THE OVERALL GROUP ACTIVITY OF WORKERS OF THE TWO SPECIES.

PLANT RES.,"LARGER INFLORESCENCES IN REWARD-PRODUCING PLANTS CAN BENEFIT PLANTS BY INCREASING BOTH POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND THE DURATION OF VISITS BY INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, ULTIMATELY, INFLORESCENCE SIZE IS DETERMINED BY THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE BENEFITS OF LARGE INFLORESCENCES AND THE INCREASED COST OF GEITONOGAMY. AT PRESENT, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INFLORESCENCE SIZE AND FECUNDITY IN DECEPTIVE PLANTS. GIVEN THAT POLLINATORS ARE LIKELY TO LEAVE INFLORESCENCES LACKING REWARDS QUICKLY, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT LONGER POLLINATOR VISITS AND THE RISK OF GEITONOGAMY WOULD BE STRONG SELECTIVE PRESSURES IN THESE SPECIES, WHICH INDICATES THAT POLLINATOR ATTRACTION MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR INFLUENCING THEIR INFLORESCENCE SIZE. HERE WE EXAMINED THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF THE DECEPTIVE ORCHID CEPHALANTHERA FALCATA IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF INFLORESCENCE SIZE ON THE FRUIT SET OF THIS NON-REWARDING SPECIES. FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF THE FLORAL VISITORS SHOWED THAT C. FALCATA IS POLLINATED BY THE ANDRENID BEE ANDRENA ABURANA, WHILST POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS ORCHID SPECIES IS NEITHER AUTOGAMOUS NOR APOGAMOUS, BUT IS STRONGLY POLLINATOR DEPENDENT. THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF FIELD OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THAT FRUIT SET WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE THAT THE NECTARLESS ORCHID C. FALCATA BENEFITS FROM PRODUCING LARGER INFLORESCENCES THAT ATTRACT A GREATER NUMBER OF INNATE POLLINATORS.

BIOL.,"ICONIC EXAMPLES OF INSECT POLLINATION HAVE EMPHASIZED NARROWLY SPECIALIZED POLLINATOR MUTUALISMS SUCH AS FIGS AND FIG WASPS [1] AND YUCCAS AND YUCCA MOTHS [2]. HOWEVER, RECENT ATTENTION BY POLLINATION ECOLOGISTS HAS FOCUSED ON THE BROAD SPECTRA OF POLLINATED PLANTS BY GENERALIST POLLINATORS SUCH AS BEES. BEES HAVE GREAT IMPACT FOR FORMULATING HYPOTHESES REGARDING SPECIALIZATION VERSUS GENERALIZATION IN POLLINATION MUTUALISMS [3, 4]. WE REPORT THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF SIX NORTHERN EUROPEAN SPECIES OF AN EXTINCT TRIBE OF POLLEN-BASKET-BEARING APINE BEES, ELECTRAPINI, OF EARLY-MIDDLE EOCENE AGE, EXAMINED FROM TWO DEPOSITS OF 48 AND 44 MILLION YEARS IN AGE [5]. THESE BEES EXHIBIT A PATTERN OF GENERALIZED, INCIDENTAL POLLEN OCCURRING RANDOMLY ON THEIR HEADS, THORACES, AND ABDOMENS, OBTAINED FROM DIVERSE, NECTAR-BEARING PLANTS. BY CONTRAST, A MORE RESTRICTED SUITE OF POLLEN WAS ACQUIRED FOR METATIBIAL POLLEN BASKETS (CORBICULAE) OF THE SAME BEE TAXA FROM A TAXONOMICALLY MUCH NARROWER SUITE OF ARBORESCENT, EVERGREEN HOSTS WITH UNIFORM FLOWER STRUCTURE. THE STEREOTYPED PLANT SOURCES OF THE SPECIALIST STRATEGY OF POLLEN COLLECTION CONSISTED OF PENTAMEROUS, RADIALLY SYMMETRICAL FLOWERS WITH A CONSPICUOUS GYNOECIUM SURROUNDED BY PROMINENT NECTAR REWARD, ORGANIZED IN STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR COMPOUND INFLORESCENCES. POLLEN SPECIALIZATION IN BEES OCCURS NOT FOR EFFICIENT POLLINATION BUT RATHER IN THE CORBICULATE ELECTRAPINI AS FOOD FOR BEE LARVAE (BROOD) AND INVOLVES PACKING CORBICULAE WITH MOISTENED POLLEN THAT RAPIDLY LOSES VIABILITY WITH AGE.

BIOL.,"BACKGROUND: MAJOR FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY OF A LINEAGE CAN BE RECOGNIZED BY CHARACTERIZING THE EXTENT AND MODE OF TRAIT EVOLUTION BETWEEN RELATED SPECIES. HERE, WE COMPARED THE EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND CLIMATIC PREFERENCES IN A CLADE COMPOSED OF THE GENERA CODONANTHOPSIS, CODONANTHE AND NEMATANTHUS (GESNERIACEAE). TO TEST THE MODE AND SPECIFIC COMPONENTS THAT LEAD TO PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY IN THIS GROUP, WE PERFORMED A BAYESIAN PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF COMBINED NUCLEAR AND PLASTID DNA SEQUENCES AND MODELED THE EVOLUTION OF QUANTITATIVE TRAITS RELATED TO FLOWER SHAPE AND SIZE AND TO CLIMATIC PREFERENCES. WE PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO DISPLAY GRAPHICALLY THE COMPLEX DYNAMICS OF TRAIT EVOLUTION ALONG A PHYLOGENETIC TREE USING A WIDE RANGE OF EVOLUTIONARY SCENARIOS. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED HETEROGENEOUS TRAIT EVOLUTION. FLORAL SHAPES DISPLACED INTO SEPARATE REGIMES SELECTED BY THE DIFFERENT POLLINATOR TYPES (HUMMINGBIRDS VERSUS INSECTS), WHILE FLORAL SIZE UNDERWENT A CLADE-SPECIFIC EVOLUTION. RATES OF EVOLUTION WERE HIGHER FOR THE CLADE THAT IS HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATED AND EXPERIENCED FLOWER RESUPINATION, COMPARED WITH SPECIES POLLINATED BY BEES, SUGGESTING A RELEVANT ROLE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN LOWLAND RAINFOREST.

ECOL.,"POLLINATION FAILURE HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO BE AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF PLANT SPECIES' RANGE LIMITS IF POLLINATOR ACTIVITY DECLINES ALONG AN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT, DIRECTLY LIMITING PLANT POPULATIONS, OR IF PLANT POPULATIONS DECLINE ALONG AN ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY FAIL TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT VISITATION. BOTH MECHANISMS PREDICT REDUCED POLLINATOR VISITATION, INCREASED POLLEN LIMITATION AND DECREASED SEED PRODUCTION TOWARDS RANGE LIMITS, AND THE FIRST ADDITIONALLY PREDICTS DECLINING POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE INDEPENDENT OF ANY PARTICULAR PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER, MANY SELF-COMPATIBLE SPECIES HAVE SOME CAPACITY FOR AUTONOMOUS SELF-FERTILIZATION, WHICH MAY BUFFER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS FROM DECLINING POLLINATOR VISITATION IF INBREEDING DEPRESSION IS MILD. THUS POLLINATOR-MEDIATED LIMITS MAY ALSO PREDICT SELECTION FOR REDUCED RELIANCE ON POLLINATORS TOWARDS RANGE LIMITS. WE TESTED THESE PREDICTIONS TOWARDS THE HIGH-ELEVATION LIMIT OF THE SELF-COMPATIBLE, BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS)-POLLINATED RHINANTHUS MINOR, ALONG TWO ELEVATION TRANSECTS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF ALBERTA, CANADA.BOMBUS ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHEST AT MID- (RANGE-CENTRE) AND HIGH-ELEVATION (RANGE LIMIT) SITES, SO DECLINING POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE IS UNLIKELY TO IMPOSE HIGH-ELEVATION LIMITS FOR BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED SPECIES IN THIS AREA. FLOWERS PER PLANT AND PER M(2) DECLINED AT UPPER RANGE LIMITS, POTENTIALLY RENDERING EDGE POPULATIONS LESS ATTRACTIVE. HOWEVER, VISITATION RATE DID NOT DECLINE TOWARDS THE RANGE LIMIT AT EITHER TRANSECT. STIGMATIC POLLEN RECEIPT DECLINED WITH INCREASING ELEVATION, BUT SEED SET DID NOT, NOR DID OUTCROSS POLLEN SUPPLEMENTATION INCREASE SEED SET AT ANY SITE. INVESTMENT IN FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS (COROLLA AREA/OVARY AREA) INCREASED TOWARDS RANGE LIMITS, BUT CAPACITY FOR HIGH-QUALITY AUTONOMOUS SEED SET AND ADULT INBREEDING COEFFICIENTS INFERRED FROM GENETIC MARKERS WERE UNIFORMLY HIGH, SUGGESTING FREQUENT SELF-FERTILIZATION AND WEAK INBREEDING DEPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE RANGE.SYNTHESIS. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR POLLINATION FAILURE TOWARDS THE UPPER RANGE LIMIT OF R.MINOR. MOREOVER, UNLIKE SOME SPECIES WITH A CAPACITY FOR AUTOGAMY, AUTONOMOUS SELFING MAKES A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO R.MINOR'S MATING SYSTEM AND DEMOGRAPHY, AND LIKELY BUFFERS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS FROM STOCHASTICITY IN POLLINATION. CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS DESPITE HIGH AUTONOMOUS SELFING SUGGESTS SOME EVOLUTIONARY BENEFIT TO POLLINATOR-MEDIATED OUTCROSSING, RATHER THAN ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS VIA INCREASING SEED QUANTITY OR QUALITY.

CURRENTLY, EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND REFERENCE COLLECTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO IDENTIFY POLLEN ORIGIN THROUGH LIGHT MICROSCOPY. POLLEN IDENTIFICATION THROUGH MOLECULAR SEQUENCING AND DNA BARCODING HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH, BUT THE ASSESSMENT OF MIXED POLLEN SAMPLES ORIGINATING FROM MULTIPLE PLANT SPECIES IS STILL A TEDIOUS AND ERROR-PRONE TASK. NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO AVOID THIS HINDRANCE. IN THIS STUDY WE ASSESSED MIXED POLLEN PROBES THROUGH NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING OF AMPLICONS FROM THE HIGHLY VARIABLE, SPECIES-SPECIFIC INTERNAL TRANSCRIBED SPACER 2 REGION OF NUCLEAR RIBOSOMAL DNA. FURTHER, WE DEVELOPED A BIOINFORMATIC WORKFLOW TO ANALYSE THESE HIGH-THROUGHPUT DATA WITH A NEWLY CREATED REFERENCE DATABASE. TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, WE COMPARED RESULTS FROM CLASSICAL IDENTIFICATION BASED ON LIGHT MICROSCOPY FROM THE SAME SAMPLES WITH OUR SEQUENCING RESULTS. WE ASSESSED IN TOTAL 16 MIXED POLLEN SAMPLES, 14 ORIGINATED FROM HONEYBEE COLONIES AND TWO FROM SOLITARY BEE NESTS. THE SEQUENCING TECHNIQUE RESULTED IN HIGHER TAXON RICHNESS (DEEPER ASSIGNMENTS AND MORE IDENTIFIED TAXA) COMPARED TO LIGHT MICROSCOPY. ABUNDANCE ESTIMATIONS FROM SEQUENCING DATA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH COUNTED ABUNDANCES THROUGH LIGHT MICROSCOPY.

A NUMBER OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO HALT AND REVERSE THESE DECLINES, PREDOMINANTLY REVOLVING AROUND THE PROVISION OF ADDITIONAL FORAGE PLANTS. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT THESE SCHEMES CAN ATTRACT SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS OF FORAGING BUMBLEBEES, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THEY ACTUALLY INCREASE BUMBLEBEE POPULATIONS. WE USED STANDARDIZED TRANSECT WALKS AND MOLECULAR TECHNIQUES TO COMPARE THE SIZE OF BUMBLEBEE POPULATIONS BETWEEN HIGHER LEVEL STEWARDSHIP (HLS) FARMS IMPLEMENTING POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY SCHEMES AND ENTRY LEVEL STEWARDSHIP (ELS) CONTROL FARMS. BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCE ON THE TRANSECT WALKS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON HLS FARMS THAN ELS FARMS. MOLECULAR ANALYSIS SUGGESTED MAXIMUM FORAGING RANGES OF 566M FOR BOMBUS HORTORUM, 714M FOR B. LAPIDARIUS, 363M FOR B. PASCUORUM AND 799M FOR B.TERRESTRIS. SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN MAXIMUM FORAGING RANGE WERE FOUND WITHIN BUMBLEBEE SPECIES BETWEEN FARM TYPES. ACCOUNTING FOR FORAGING RANGE DIFFERENCES, B.HORTORUM (47 VS 13 NESTS/KM(2)) AND B.LAPIDARIUS (45 VS 22 NESTS/KM(2)) WERE FOUND TO NEST AT SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DENSITIES ON HLS FARMS THAN ELS FARMS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FARM TYPE FOR B.TERRESTRIS (88 VS 38 NESTS/KM(2)) AND B.PASCUORUM (32 VS 39 NESTS/KM(2)).

ECON. ENTOMOL.,"THE ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT BEE DECLINE HAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON HONEY BEES AND NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES, WHILE NATIVE POLLINATORS SUCH AS NEOTROPICAL STINGLESS BEES AND AGROCHEMICALS SUCH AS OTHER INSECTICIDE GROUPS, PESTICIDES IN GENERAL, AND FERTILIZERS-ESPECIALLY LEAF FERTILIZERS-REMAIN NEGLECTED AS POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTORS TO POLLINATION DECLINE. IN AN EFFORT TO EXPLORE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE ASSESSED THE LETHAL AND SUBLETHAL BEHAVIORAL IMPACT OF HEAVY METAL-CONTAINING LEAF FERTILIZERS IN A NATIVE POLLINATOR OF ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE IN THE NEOTROPICS: THE STINGLESS BEE FRIESELLA SCHROTTKYI (FRIESE). TWO LEAF FERTILIZERS-COPPER SULFATE (24\% CU) AND A MICRONUTRIENT MIX (ARRANK L: 5\% S, 5\% ZN, 3\% MN, 0.6\% CU, 0.5\% B, AND 0.06\% MO)-WERE USED IN ORAL AND CONTACT EXPOSURE BIOASSAYS. THE BIOPESTICIDE SPINOSAD AND WATER WERE USED AS POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CONTROLS, RESPECTIVELY. COPPER SULFATE COMPROMISED THE SURVIVAL OF STINGLESS BEE WORKERS, PARTICULARLY WITH ORAL EXPOSURE, ALTHOUGH LESS THAN SPINOSAD UNDER CONTACT EXPOSURE. SUBLETHAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH LEAF FERTILIZERS AT THEIR FIELD RATES ALSO CAUSED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN EXPOSED WORKERS. COPPER SULFATE ENHANCED FLIGHT TAKE-OFF ON STINGLESS BEE WORKERS, UNLIKE WORKERS EXPOSED TO THE MICRONUTRIENT MIX. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF LEAF FERTILIZERS ON THE OVERALL ACTIVITY AND WALKING BEHAVIOR OF WORKER BEES. NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED FOR THE RESPIRATION RATE OF WORKER BEES UNDER CONTACT EXPOSURE, BUT WORKERS ORALLY EXPOSED TO THE MICRONUTRIENT MIX EXHIBITED A REDUCED RESPIRATION RATE.

WE COMPARED A DISTINCTIVE GROUP OF CREAM-GREEN MACQUARIE ISLAND FLOWERS TO THE FLORA OF LIKELY SOURCE POOLS OF IMMIGRANTS AND TO A CONTINENTAL FLORA FROM A HIGH LATITUDE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. WE USED BOTH DIPTERAN AND HYMENOPTERAN COLOUR MODELS AND PHYLOGENETICALLY INFORMED ANALYSES TO EXPLORE THE CHROMATIC COMPONENT OF COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY. THE SPECIES WITH CREAM-GREEN FLOWERS ARE VERY RESTRICTED IN COLOUR SPACE MODELS OF BOTH FLY VISION AND BEE VISION AND REPRESENT A DISTINCT GROUP THAT PLAYS A VERY MINOR ROLE IN OTHER COMMUNITIES.

INSECT CONSERV.,"LIVESTOCK GRAZING IS A WIDESPREAD GRASSLAND DISTURBANCE AND CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT BIODIVERSITY. POLLINATORS CONSTITUTE A VITAL COMPONENT OF GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEMS, BUT THE IMPACT OF GRAZING ON POLLINATOR DIVERSITY HAS SELDOM BEEN EVALUATED IN NORTH AMERICA. WE ASSESSED VEGETATION STRUCTURE, AND POLLINATOR AND FLOWERING PLANT ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN FOUR PAIRS OF SPRING-GRAZED/UNGRAZED SITES IN SOUTH-CENTRAL BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED WHETHER POLLINATOR OR FLORAL COMMUNITIES DIFFERED BETWEEN THE TWO THREATENED SHRUBSTEPPE HABITAT TYPES WE SAMPLED-ANTELOPE-BRUSH AND BIG SAGEBRUSH SHRUBSTEPPE. PAN-TRAPPING SURVEYS CAPTURED 5907 BEES, FLIES, BEETLES, WASPS AND BUTTERFLIES CONSTITUTING 253 SPECIES. WE FOUND THAT THE PERCENT COVER OF SHRUBS AND BARE SOIL INCREASED WITH GRAZING, WHILE THE HEIGHT OF GRASSES AND FORBS DECREASED. IN CONTRAST, POLLINATOR AND FLOWERING PLANT ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY GRAZING. FLOWERING PLANT AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION DID DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SHRUBSTEPPE HABITATS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT GRASSLANDS IN NORTH AMERICA, WHEN MANAGED RESPONSIBLY, CAN MAINTAIN POLLINATOR AND FLOWERING PLANT DIVERSITY UNDER GRAZING PRESSURE.

BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) ARE IMPORTANT WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS. THERE IS INCREASED INTEREST IN INCORPORATING DATA ON BUMBLE BEES INTO RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR PESTICIDES, BUT STANDARDIZED METHODS FOR ASSESSING HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES IN SEMI FIELD AND FIELD SETTINGS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR BUMBLE BEES. DURING SEMI-FIELD STUDIES, COLONIES ARE CAGED WITH PESTICIDE-TREATED FLOWERING SURROGATE PLANTS, WHICH MUST BE ATTRACTIVE TO FORAGERS TO ENSURE COLONY EXPOSURE TO THE TEST COMPOUND, LAND MUST PRODUCE AN AMPLE NECTAR AND POLLEN TO SUSTAIN COLONIES DURING TESTING. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHICH PLANT(S) ARE SUITABLE FOR USE IN SEMI-FIELD STUDIES WITH BUMBLE BEES. MATERIALS AND METHODS. WE COMPARED B.

ECOL.,"THE POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN LANDSCAPE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT AND WILD POLLINATOR RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE IN AGROECOSYSTEMS HAS BEEN WELL STUDIED. HOWEVER, WE LACK A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF LOCAL SCALE FLORAL RESOURCE AND NEST PROVISIONING FOR WILD BEES NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLLINATOR CONSERVATION PRACTICES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO USE A SPATIALLY INTERACTIVE LANDSCAPE POLLINATION MODEL (HEREAFTER, THE LONSDORF MODEL) TO REPRESENT FIELD SCALE SPATIAL PATTERNS OF WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS WITHIN A HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPE IN THE MID-ATLANTIC USA. WE PARAMETERIZED THE LONSDORF MODEL WITH HIGH RESOLUTION AERIAL IMAGERY AND INSIGHT FROM A PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED FLORISTIC STUDY. TO TEST THE LONSDORF MODEL PREDICTIONS, FIELD STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED TO MEASURE WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN APPLE ORCHARDS AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE FROM A FOREST EDGE. FIELD MEASUREMENTS INDICATED APPLE POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM THE FOREST EDGE. THE LONSDORF MODEL POLLINATION SERVICE SCORE WAS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN RESOURCE PROVISIONING IN ORCHARD AND NON-CROP AREAS, AND INCLUDING RESOURCE RICH FOREST AND FOREST EDGE HABITATS IN THE MODEL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED POLLINATION SERVICE ESTIMATES. WE DEMONSTRATED A NOVEL APPLICATION OF THE LONSDORF MODEL AT A FIELD SCALE TO PREDICT TRENDS IN POLLINATION SERVICE PROVISIONING AS A FACTOR OF LOCAL HABITAT FEATURES. WITH SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED INPUTS, THE LONSDORF MODEL IS A PROMISING TOOL TO QUANTIFY FIELD SCALE POLLINATION SERVICE DEFICITS, GUIDING MORE COST EFFECTIVE HABITAT SUPPLEMENTATION AND OTHER CONSERVATION EFFORTS.",FOREST EDGE; LONSDORF MODEL; MALUS DOMESTICA; POLLINATION; SPATIAL MODELING; WILD BEES,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; POLLINATION SERVICES; NATIVE BEES; CROP POLLINATION; DEPENDENT CROP; FRUIT-SET; MANAGEMENT; CONSERVATION; RESTORATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"KAMMERER, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT SCI, 116 ASI BLDG, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.;KAMMERER, MELANIE A., MORTENSEN, DAVID A., PENN STATE UNIV, INTERCOLLEGE GRAD DEGREE PROGRAM ECOL, 116 ASI BLDG, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.;KAMMERER, MELANIE A., MORTENSEN, DAVID A., PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT SCI, 116 ASI BLDG, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.;BIDDINGER, DAVID J., PENN STATE UNIV, FRUIT RES \& EXTENS CTR, 290 UNIV DR, BIGLERVILLE, PA 17307 USA.;BIDDINGER, DAVID J., RAJOTTE, EDWIN G., PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, 501 ASI BLDG, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA.;JOSHI, NEELENDRA K., UNIV ARKANSAS, DEPT ENTOMOL, 319 AG BLDG, FAYETTEVILLE, AR 72701 USA.",10.1007/S10980-016-0416-4,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE SPECIALTY CROPS RESEARCH INITIATIVE (USDA-SCRI) [PEN04398]; USDA-SCRI COORDINATED AGRICULTURAL PROJECT [MICL05063]; STATE HORTICULTURAL ASSOCIATION OF PENNSYLVANIA,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK AMANDA RITZ, DR.

ALTHOUGH SEED FOR THESE MIXTURES IS OFTEN WILD-SOURCED, FOR SPECIES WHERE AGRICULTURAL CULTIVARS ARE AVAILABLE, FOR EXAMPLE RED CLOVER (TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE), CULTIVARS CAN ALSO BE INCLUDED. PREVIOUS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PLANT GENETIC BACKGROUND CAN HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON PLANT-ARTHROPOD INTERACTIONS AND THEREFORE THE PROVENANCE AND GENETIC BACKGROUND OF THE PLANTS INCLUDED IN WILDFLOWER MIXES COULD IMPACT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. WE TESTED THE PERFORMANCE OF FIVE INDIVIDUAL T. PRATENSE CULTIVARS AGAINST TWO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE WILD-SOURCED T.

THE MAIN BUMBLEBEE OBSERVED INTERACTING WITH T. PRATENSE WAS BOMBUS PASCUORUM AND WE FOUND NO DIFFERENCE IN THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER OF B. PASCUORUM VISITING THE CULTIVARS OR WILD POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, WE FOUND VARIATION AMONG CULTIVARS AND BETWEEN WILD POPULATIONS IN THEIR ABILITY TO ATTRACT BUMBLEBEES, WHICH SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THEIR RELATIVE INVESTMENT IN DIFFERENT FLORAL TRAITS. THERE WAS A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOMASS AND NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES PRODUCED BY THE WILD POPULATIONS OF T. PRATENSE, WHICH WAS NOT APPARENT FOR THE CULTIVARS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ARTIFICIAL SELECTION ON THE CULTIVARS HAS CHANGED THE G-MATRIX OF CORRELATED TRAITS. WE SHOW THAT AGRICULTURAL CULTIVARS OF T.

YET, DESPITE IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAP EFFICACY, COLLECTION OF NONTARGET SPECIES (BYCATCH) PLAGUES MANY INSECT PEST SURVEYS. BYCATCH CAN INFLUENCE SURVEY EFFECTIVENESS BY REDUCING THE AVAILABLE SPACE FOR TARGET SPECIES AND INCREASING TRAP SCREENING TIME, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THOUSANDS OF INSECTS ARE CAPTURED AS BYCATCH IN A GIVEN SEASON. ADDITIONALLY, BYCATCH MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT LOCAL NONTARGET INSECT POPULATIONS, INCLUDING BENEFICIAL PREDATORS AND POLLINATORS. HERE, WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF PHEROMONE LURES ON BYCATCH RATES OF COCCINELLIDAE (COLEOPTERA), APOIDEA (HYMENOPTERA), AND NONTARGET LEPIDOPTERA.

VIRUS INFECTION INDUCES CHANGES IN PLANT VOLATILE EMISSION PROFILES, AND THIS CAN MAKE PLANTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO INSECT HERBIVORES, SUCH AS APHIDS, THAT ACT AS VIRAL VECTORS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF VIRUS-INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN VOLATILE PRODUCTION AFFECT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. WE FOUND THAT VOLATILES EMITTED BY CUCUMBER MOSAIC VIRUS (CMV)-INFECTED TOMATO (SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM) AND ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA PLANTS ALTERED THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS). VIRUS-INDUCED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN BLENDS OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS EMITTED BY TOMATO PLANTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-COUPLED MASS SPECTROMETRY. EXPERIMENTS WITH A CMV MUTANT UNABLE TO EXPRESS THE 2B RNA SILENCING SUPPRESSOR PROTEIN AND WITH ARABIDOPSIS SILENCING MUTANTS IMPLICATE MICRORNAS IN REGULATING EMISSION OF POLLINATOR-PERCEIVABLE VOLATILES. IN TOMATO, CMV INFECTION MADE PLANTS EMIT VOLATILES ATTRACTIVE TO BUMBLEBEES. BUMBLEBEES POLLINATE TOMATO BY `BUZZING' (SONICATING) THE FLOWERS, WHICH RELEASES POLLEN AND ENHANCES SELF-FERTILIZATION AND SEED PRODUCTION AS WELL AS POLLEN EXPORT. WITHOUT BUZZ-POLLINATION, CMV INFECTION DECREASED SEED YIELD, BUT WHEN FLOWERS OF MOCK-INOCULATED AND CMV-INFECTED PLANTS WERE BUZZ-POLLINATED, THE INCREASED SEED YIELD FOR CMV-INFECTED PLANTS WAS SIMILAR TO THAT FOR MOCK-INOCULATED PLANTS. INCREASED POLLINATOR PREFERENCE CAN POTENTIALLY INCREASE PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN TWO WAYS: I) AS FEMALE PARENTS, BY INCREASING THE PROBABILITY THAT OVULES ARE FERTILIZED, II) AS MALE PARENTS, BY INCREASING POLLEN EXPORT.

HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTIONS BY POLLINATORS OTHER THAN BEES HAVE BEEN LITTLE EXPLORED DESPITE THEIR POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO CROP PRODUCTION AND STABILITY IN THE FACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. NON-BEE POLLINATORS INCLUDE FLIES, BEETLES, MOTHS, BUTTERFLIES, WASPS, ANTS, BIRDS, AND BATS, AMONG OTHERS. HERE WE FOCUS ON NON-BEE INSECTS AND SYNTHESIZE 39 FIELD STUDIES FROM FIVE CONTINENTS THAT DIRECTLY MEASURED THE CROP POLLINATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY NON-BEES, HONEY BEES, AND OTHER BEES TO COMPARE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THESE TAXA. NON-BEES PERFORMED 25-50\% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS. ALTHOUGH NON-BEES WERE LESS EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS THAN BEES PER FLOWER VISIT, THEY MADE MORE VISITS, THUS THESE TWO FACTORS COMPENSATED FOR EACH OTHER, RESULTING IN POLLINATION SERVICES RENDERED BY NON-BEES THAT WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE PROVIDED BY BEES. IN THE SUBSET OF STUDIES THAT MEASURED FRUIT SET, FRUIT SET INCREASED WITH NON-BEE INSECT VISITS INDEPENDENTLY OF BEE VISITATION RATES, INDICATING THAT NON-BEE INSECTS PROVIDE A UNIQUE BENEFIT THAT IS NOT PROVIDED BY BEES. WE ALSO SHOW THAT NON-BEE INSECTS ARE NOT AS RELIANT AS BEES ON THE PRESENCE OF REMNANT NATURAL OR SEMINATURAL HABITAT IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. THESE RESULTS STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT NON-BEE INSECT POLLINATORS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN GLOBAL CROP PRODUCTION AND RESPOND DIFFERENTLY THAN BEES TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE, PROBABLY MAKING THEIR CROP POLLINATION SERVICES MORE ROBUST TO CHANGES IN LAND USE.

HOWEVER, PAST FUNCTIONAL STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED LARGELY ON SEED PRODUCTION, ALTHOUGH USEFUL, THIS FOCUS ON SEED SET DOES NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING SPECIES-SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW. HERE WE QUANTIFY POLLEN DISPERSAL FOR INDIVIDUAL POLLINATOR SPECIES ACROSS MORE THAN 690 HA OF TROPICAL FOREST. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXAMINE VISITATION, SEED PRODUCTION, AND POLLEN-DISPERSAL ABILITY FOR THE ENTIRE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY OF A COMMON TROPICAL TREE USING A SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL-BASED POLLINATOR-EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS FOLLOWED BY MOLECULAR-BASED FRACTIONAL PATERNITY ANALYSES. WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATOR BODY SIZE, PLANT SIZE (AS A PROXY OF FLORAL DISPLAY), LOCAL PLANT DENSITY, AND LOCAL PLANT KINSHIP ON SEED PRODUCTION AND POLLEN-DISPERSAL DISTANCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT WHILE LARGE-BODIED POLLINATORS SET MORE SEEDS PER VISIT, SMALL-BODIED BEES VISITED FLOWERS MORE FREQUENTLY AND WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN 49\% OF ALL LONG-DISTANCE (BEYOND 1 KM) POLLEN-DISPERSAL EVENTS. THUS, DESPITE THEIR SIZE, SMALL-BODIED BEES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN FACILITATING LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW. WE ALSO FOUND THAT BOTH PLANT SIZE AND LOCAL PLANT KINSHIP NEGATIVELY IMPACT POLLEN DISPERSAL AND SEED PRODUCTION. BY INCORPORATING GENETIC AND TRAIT-BASED DATA INTO THE QUANTIFICATION OF POLLINATION SERVICES, WE HIGHLIGHT THE DIVERSITY IN ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION MEDIATED BY POLLINATORS, THE INFLUENTIAL ROLE THAT PLANT AND POPULATION ATTRIBUTES PLAY IN DRIVING SERVICE PROVISION, AND THE UNEXPECTED IMPORTANCE OF SMALL-BODIED POLLINATORS IN THE RECRUITMENT OF PLANT GENETIC DIVERSITY.",BEES; BODY SIZE; ECOLOGICAL SERVICES; POLLINATION; POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW,CROP POLLINATION SERVICES; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; TROPICAL TREE; RAIN-FOREST; POLLEN DISPERSAL; FORAGING RANGES; SEED DISPERSAL; SOIL CARBON; BUMBLE BEES; BODY-SIZE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"JHA, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TEXAS AUSTIN, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, AUSTIN, TX 78712 USA.;CASTILLA, ANTONIO R., POPE, NATHANIEL S., O'CONNELL, MEGAN, RODRIGUEZ, MAR-A F., TREVINO, LAUREL, JHA, SHALENE, UNIV TEXAS AUSTIN, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, AUSTIN, TX 78712 USA.;SANTOS, ALONSO, UNIV PANAMA, FAC CIENCIAS NAT EXACTAS \& TECNOL, ESCUELA BIOL, DEPT ZOOL,MUSEO INVERTEBRADOS GB FAIRCHILD, PANAMA CITY 082400021, PANAMA.",10.1073/PNAS.1619271114,"2101 CONSTITUTION AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20418 USA",NA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF); NSF GRADUATE RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPSNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF),"WE THANK J.

LINNEAN SOC.,"POLLINATORS OFTEN TEND TO VISIT THE SAME FLOWER TYPE AS THE LAST ONE VISITED, EVEN IF MORE REWARDING FLOWER TYPES ARE AVAILABLE. THIS BEHAVIOUR IS CALLED FLOWER CONSTANCY AND WAS HYPOTHESIZED TO PROMOTE EVOLUTION TOWARDS SPECIALIZATION OF POLLINATION SYSTEMS. FLOWER CONSTANCY NONTRIVIALLY INTERACTS WITH POLLINATOR PREFERENCE FOR DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES, WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY RECOGNIZED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE EXAMINE THE INDEPENDENT RELATIVE INFLUENCES OF POLLINATOR'S PREFERENCE AND FLOWER CONSTANCY ON PLANT'S GAIN FROM POLLINATION. WE FORMULATE AND ANALYSE A GENERAL MARKOV TRANSITION MATRIX MODEL OF POLLINATOR VISITATION AND PARAMETERIZE IT WITH FIELD DATA FROM A SYSTEM OF THREE PLANT AND TWO POLLINATOR SPECIES. FLOWER CONSTANCY GENERALLY HAD WEAKER EFFECTS ON PLANT'S GAIN THAN POLLINATOR PREFERENCES. THE ADAPTIVENESS OF MANIPULATING FLOWER CONSTANCY FOR PLANTS DEPENDS ON WHICH MECHANISM UNDERLYING FLOWER CONSTANCY IS ASSUMED TO BE THE DOMINANT ONE IN A GIVEN SYSTEM. INTERESTINGLY, LARGE AREAS OF PREFERENCE-CONSTANCY PARAMETER SPACE DID NOT EXHIBIT ANY BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT SELECTION PRESSURE ON INCREASING POLLINATOR PREFERENCE OR FLOWER CONSTANCY, THAT IS SELECTION TOWARDS SPECIALIZATION OF POLLINATION SYSTEM.

BOT.,"ALTHOUGH HETEROSTYLY FREQUENTLY OCCURS IN RUBIACEAE, THERE ARE CASES OF DISTYLOUS SPECIES WITH POPULATIONS THAT HAVE VARIATIONS IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE TYPICALLY DISTYLOUS GENUS PALICOUREA, P. CROCEA SHOWED A PIN-MONOMORPHISM. CONSIDERING THIS, THE QUESTIONS ADDRESSED IN THE PRESENT STUDY WERE: (1) ARE THERE OTHER PIN-MONOMORPHIC PALICOUREA CROCEA POPULATIONS? (2) HOW IMPORTANT ARE FLOWER VISITORS TO THE POLLINATION OF THIS SPECIES? (3) WHAT IS THE COMPATIBILITY SYSTEM IN P. CROCEA? IN ADDITION, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT P. CROCEA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE AND AUTOGAMOUS THAT CAN BE A RESULT OF A VARIATION IN THE DISTYLOUS PATTERN. TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS, WE VERIFIED THE POSITION OF ANTHERS AND STIGMAS IN FLOWERS OF OTHER POPULATIONS OF PALICOUREA CROCEA USING VOUCHER SPECIMENS. FURTHERMORE, WE MADE FOCAL OBSERVATIONS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF FLOWER VISITORS AND WE MADE FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO VERIFY THE COMPATIBILITY SYSTEM IN P. CROCEA. AMONG SEVEN FLOWER VISITORS SPECIES OBSERVED-FOUR BEES, ONE WASP, ONE BUTTERFLY AND ONE HUMMINGBIRD-THE LATTER WAS CONSIDERED THE MAIN POLLINATOR DUE TO ITS HIGH FREQUENCY OF VISITS AT ALL TIMES ANALYZED. HOWEVER, THE SMALL SIZE OF THE POPULATION IN THE STUDY AREA, THE TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR OF HUMMINGBIRDS, AND THE ACTIVITY OF NECTAR ROBBERS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A LOW POLLEN FLOW. IN THIS SITUATION, TRAITS AS SELF-COMPATIBILITY AND AUTOGAMY OBSERVED IN PALICOUREA CROCEA ARE BENEFICIAL, SINCE THEY MAINTAIN SPECIES FERTILITY. THIS COULD REPRESENT A NEW EVOLUTIONARY PATH FOR THE REPRODUCTION OF THIS POPULATION, DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF P.

THE FIRST ONE SUPPOSES THAT LARGER ANIMALS ARE SUPERIOR COMPETITORS BECAUSE OF THEIR INCREASED FEEDING ABILITIES, WHEREAS THE SECOND ONE ASSUMES SUPERIORITY OF SMALLER ANIMALS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOWER FOOD REQUIREMENTS. WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO UNRELATED SPECIES OF DIFFERENT SIZE, DRINKING TECHNIQUE, ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND ROLES IN PLANT POLLINATION SYSTEM, TO REVEAL THE FEATURES OF THEIR COMPETITIVE INTERACTION AND MECHANISMS ENABLING THEIR CO-EXISTENCE WHILE UTILISING THE SAME NECTAR SOURCE. WE OBSERVED DIURNAL FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF THE MAIN POLLINATOR, THE CARPENTER BEE XYLOCOPA CAFFRA AND A NECTAR THIEF, THE NORTHERN DOUBLE-COLLARED SUNBIRD CINNYRIS REICHENOWI ON 19 CLUMPS OF HYPOESTES ARISTATA (ACANTHACEAE) IN BAMENDA HIGHLANDS, CAMEROON. FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSE, WE ESTABLISHED A SIMPLISTIC MODEL OF DAILY ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND DAILY ENERGY INTAKE BY BOTH VISITOR SPECIES ASSUMING THAT THEY SPEND ALL AVAILABLE DAYTIME FEEDING ON H. ARISTATA. WE REVEALED THE ENERGETIC GAIN-EXPENDITURE BALANCE OF THE STUDIED VISITOR SPECIES IN RELATION TO DIURNAL CHANGES IN NECTAR QUALITY AND QUANTITY. IN GENERAL, SMALLER ENERGY REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED ABILITY TO UTILISE SMALLER RESOURCES MADE THE MAIN POLLINATOR X. CAFFRA COMPETITIVELY SUPERIOR TO THE LARGER NECTAR THIEF C. REICHENOWI. NEVERTHELESS, SUNBIRDS ARE ENDOWED WITH SEVERAL MECHANISMS TO REDUCE ASYMMETRY IN EXPLOITATIVE COMPETITION, SUCH AS THE USE OF NECTAR RESOURCES IN TIMES OF THE DAY WHEN RIVALS ARE INACTIVE, AGGRESSIVE ATTACKS ON CARPENTER BEES WHILE DEFENDING THE NECTAR PLANTS, AND HIGHER SPEED OF NECTAR CONSUMPTION.",AFRICA; CARPENTER BEE; CINNYRIS; HYPOESTES; SUNBIRD; XYLOCOPA,ROBBING BUMBLE BEES; INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; BAMENDA HIGHLANDS; SEXUAL-DIMORPHISM; CARPENTER BEES; FOOD SELECTION; HUMMINGBIRDS; MECHANISMS; EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"PADYSAKOVA, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBL, INST ENTOMOL, BRANISOVSKA 31, CR-37005 CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PADYSAKOVA, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA, DEPT ZOOL, FAC SCI, BRANISOVSKA 31, CESKE BUDEJOVICE 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PADYSAKOVA, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, FAC SCI, DEPT ECOL, VINICNA 7, CR-12844 PRAGUE 2, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PADYSAKOVA, ELISKA, ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBL, INST ENTOMOL, BRANISOVSKA 31, CR-37005 CESKE BUDEJOVICE, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PADYSAKOVA, ELISKA, OKROUHLIK, JAN, UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA, DEPT ZOOL, FAC SCI, BRANISOVSKA 31, CESKE BUDEJOVICE 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PADYSAKOVA, ELISKA, BARTOS, MICHAEL, JANECEK, STEPAN, CHARLES UNIV PRAGUE, FAC SCI, DEPT ECOL, VINICNA 7, CR-12844 PRAGUE 2, CZECH REPUBLIC.;BROWN, MARK, UNIV KWAZULU NATAL, SCH LIFE SCI, DURBAN, SOUTH AFRICA.;BARTOS, MICHAEL, JANECEK, STEPAN, ACAD SCI CZECH REPUBL, INST BOT, DUKELSKA 135, CS-37982 TREBON, CZECH REPUBLIC.",10.1007/S00442-017-3817-4,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,"PROJECTS OF CZECH SCIENCE FOUNDATION [16-11164Y]; GRANT AGENCY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH BOHEMIA [136/2010/P, 156/2013/P]; PROGRAMME OF SUPPORT OF PROMISING HUMAN RESOURCES [L200961552]; CZECH ACADEMY OF SCIENCESCZECH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES; [RVO: 60077344]; [67985939]","WE THANK TO ERNEST VUNAN AMOHLON FOR HIS HELP AND KIND RECEPTION IN BIG BABANKI VILLAGE, AND TO BENJAMIN VUBANGSI, THE LOCAL CHIEF OF KEDJOM-KEKU COMMUNITY, FOR PROVIDING US THE PERMISSION AND ACCESS TO STUDY AREA.

ECOL.,"EXOTIC SPECIES OFTEN CAUSE SEVERE ALTERATIONS IN NATIVE COMMUNITIES DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY UTILIZE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF RESOURCES. IN FLOWER-VISITOR INTERACTIONS, THE BREADTH OF RESOURCE USE BY NATIVE AND EXOTIC ANIMALS AS WELL AS THE PARTITIONING OF RESOURCES AMONG THEM IS OFTEN ESTIMATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF (SHARED) PLANT SPECIES USED AS RESOURCES. HOWEVER, WHETHER A FLOWER VISITOR IS ABLE TO EXPLOIT PLANT RESOURCES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE DELIMITED BY FUNCTIONAL FLORAL TRAITS SUCH AS MORPHOLOGICAL BARRIERS OR ATTRACTIVE OR REPELLENT CHEMICAL CUES. EACH OF THE ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT TRAITS CAN BE VIEWED AS A DIMENSION OF A HUTCHINSONIAN N-DIMENSIONAL HYPERVOLUME, WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE RANGE OF PHENOTYPES EXPLOITABLE BY A SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE QUANTIFIED THE SIZES AND OVERLAPS OF N-DIMENSIONAL HYPERVOLUMES DEFINED BY FLORAL TRAITS THAT ARE EXPLOITED BY NATIVE AND EXOTIC FLOWER VISITORS (AFTERWARDS REFERRED TO AS EXPLOITED SPACE, ES). IN THE HEAVILY INVADED HAWAII VOLCANOES NATIONAL PARK, USA, WE PHENOTYPED 40 NATIVE AND EXOTIC PLANT SPECIES AND RECORDED FLOWER-VISITOR INTERACTIONS. TO QUANTIFY THE SIZE AND OVERLAP OF ES, WE APPLIED DYNAMIC RANGE BOXES. ON AVERAGE, EXOTIC FLOWER VISITORS WERE MORE GENERALIZED IN RESOURCE USE (LARGER ES) THAN NATIVES ONES, WHICH IS ADDITIONALLY INDICATED BY THE ABSENCE OF NATIVE FLOWER VISITORS ON EXOTIC FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES. IN PARTICULAR, ES BASED ON FLORAL SCENT EMISSION WAS LARGER FOR EXOTIC FLOWER VISITORS COMPARED TO NATIVE ONES. THE UNEVENLY EXPANDED ES OF NATIVE AND EXOTIC ANIMALS LED TO AN ASYMMETRIC OVERLAP OF FLORAL ES WHERE EXOTIC FLOWER VISITORS SHARED ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THEIR ES WITH NATIVES BUT OCCUPIED A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE ES OF NATIVES. THE ASYMMETRY IN RESOURCE USE OF NATIVE AND EXOTIC FLOWER VISITORS SUGGESTS A POTENTIAL ADVANTAGE IN RESOURCE EXPLOITATION OF THE LATTER, POTENTIALLY EXPLAINING THEIR SUCCESS IN HAWAIIAN ECOSYSTEMS. PREDICTED RANGE EXPANSION OF EXOTIC PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES MAY FURTHER INCREASE THE COMPETITION FOR AND REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES FOR NATIVE ANIMALS. THIS MAY LEAD TO FURTHER DECLINES OF NATIVE SPECIES AND INCREASING THREATS FOR HAWAIIAN ECOSYSTEMS.

TYPICALLY, NATIVE BEES ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE, INCLUDING HABITAT ALTERATION AND CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THE EASTERN CARPENTER BEE XYLOCOPA VIRGINICA, A GENERALIST POLLINATOR WITH A BROAD GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SPANNING EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. EASTERN CARPENTER BEES NOW NEST ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IN ARTIFICIAL WOODEN STRUCTURES, LINKING THEIR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATION STRUCTURE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES AND DISTURBANCE. TO INVESTIGATE THE POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THESE BEES, WE SAMPLED FEMALES FROM 16 DIFFERENT POPULATIONS FROM ACROSS THEIR RANGE. NINE SPECIES-SPECIFIC MICROSATELLITE LOCI SHOWED THAT ALMOST ALL POPULATIONS ARE GENETICALLY DISTINCT, BUT WITH HIGH LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND LOW LEVELS OF INBREEDING OVERALL. BROADLY SPEAKING, POPULATIONS CLUSTERED INTO THREE DISTINCT GENETIC GROUPS: A NORTHERN GROUP, A WESTERN GROUP AND A CORE GROUP. THE NORTHERN GROUP HAD LOW EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZES, DECREASED GENETIC VARIABILITY AND THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF INBREEDING IN THE DATA SET, SUGGESTING THAT CARPENTER BEES MAY BE EXPANDING THEIR RANGE NORTHWARD. THE WESTERN GROUP WAS GENETICALLY DISTINCT, BUT LACKED SIGNALS OF A RECENT RANGE EXPANSION. CLIMATIC DATA SHOWED THAT SUMMER AND WINTER TEMPERATURES EXPLAINED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION SEEN AMONG POPULATIONS, WHILE PRECIPITATION DID NOT.

ENVIRON.,"UNDERSTANDING HOW CLIMATE CHANGE MAY AFFECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION HELPS PREDICT HOW ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS POLLINATION, COULD BE IMPAIRED IN THE FUTURE. WE EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF FIVE NATIVE BEE SPECIES AND ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF BEE DISTRIBUTION SHIFTS ON TOMATO CROPS IN BRAZIL. ENSEMBLE FORECASTING WAS IMPLEMENTED THROUGH FIVE ALGORITHMS IN TWO CARBON EMISSION SCENARIOS TO PREDICT RANGE SHIFTS FOR FIVE TOMATO-VISITING BEE SPECIES FOR THE YEAR 2100. WE THEN CALCULATED THE TOTAL TOMATO CROP AREA IN THE CELLS WITH AT LEAST 50\% BEE SUITABILITY, FOR EACH BEE SPECIES, IN EACH SCENARIO. RESULTS SHOWED THAT ALL SPECIES WILL UNDERGO A REDUCTION IN SUITABLE AREAS IN BOTH SCENARIOS. BOMBUS MONO HAD THE GREATEST AREA REDUCTION IN 2100 UNDER THE OPTIMISTIC AND PESSIMISTIC SCENARIOS: NEAR 38\% AND 71\%, RESPECTIVELY. CENTRIS TARSATA HAD THE SMALLER AREA REDUCTION UNDER THE SAME SCENARIOS: 8.5\% AND 19.5\% RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGH AGREEMENT BETWEEN TOMATO CROPS AND BEE DISTRIBUTION OBSERVED IN THE PRESENT WILL ALSO BE REDUCED IN BOTH SCENARIOS FOR ALL SPECIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE PESSIMISTIC SCENARIO. B. MONO HAD THE HIGHEST REDUCTION IN RANGE DUE TO HABITAT SUITABILITY AND WILL BE RESTRICTED TO SOME PARTS OF SOUTHEASTERN AND SOUTHERN BRAZIL. OVER 60\% OF THE TOMATO CROP AREA PRESENTLY WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION OF B. MONO WILL BECOME CLIMATICALLY UNSUITABLE IN THE PESSIMISTIC EMISSION SCENARIO. THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT THE PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT SEVERAL SPECIES ASSOCIATED WITH TOMATO CROPS IN BRAZIL BY THE YEAR 2100. THIS IS TROUBLING, AS IT COULD RESULT IN TOMATO PRODUCTION LOSSES, WHICH WOULD BRING ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL LOSSES TO THE TOMATO-PRODUCING REGIONS WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR POLLINATOR CONSERVATION.

RES.,"BACKGROUND: IRIS BREVICAULIS AND IRIS FULVA CAN BE FOUND IN SYMPATRIC POPULATIONS IN SOUTHERN LOUISIANA. ETHOLOGICAL POLLINATOR ISOLATION IS AN IMPORTANT REPRODUCTIVE BARRIER, AS THE POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF IRIS BREVICAULIS FLOWERS RESULT IN PRIMARILY BUMBLEBEE VISITS, WHILE THE POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF IRIS FULVA PRIMARILY RESULT IN HUMMINGBIRD VISITS. OTHER POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF POLLINATOR ISOLATION - NAMELY, `LEGITIMACY OF VISITATION' (I.E. WHETHER OR NOT A FLORAL VISITOR PHYSICALLY INTERACTS WITH A FLOWER IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN PICK UP POLLEN FROM AN ANTHER OR TRANSFER POLLEN TO A STIGMA) AND `POLLEN TRANSFER SUCCESS' (I.E. WHETHER OR NOT A `LEGITIMATE' FLORAL VISITOR SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFERS POLLEN FROM ONE FLOWER TO THE STIGMA OF ANOTHER) - HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED. HYPOTHESES: HUMMINGBIRDS, THE PRIMARY FLORAL VISITORS OF I. FULVA, ARE MORE LIKELY TO VISIT I FULVA POLLINATION UNITS LEGITIMATELY THAN THEY ARE THE POLLINATION UNITS OF I BREVICAULIS. FURTHERMORE, HUMMINGBIRDS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER POLLEN IN I. FULVA INTRASPECIFIC VISITATION BOUTS COMPARED WITH EITHER INTERSPECIFIC OR I. BREVICAULIS INTRASPECIFIC FLORAL VISITS. BUMBLEBEES, THE PRIMARY FLORAL VISITORS OF I. BREVICAULIS, ARE MORE LIKELY TO VISIT I BREVICAULIS POLLINATION UNITS LEGITIMATELY THAN THEY ARE THOSE OF I. FULVA. IN ADDITION, BUMBLEBEES ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSFER POLLEN IN I. BREVICAULIS INTRASPECIFIC VISITATION BOUTS COMPARED WITH INTERSPECIFIC OR I. FULVA INTRASPECIFIC FLORAL VISITS. METHODS: WE RECORDED THE PROPORTION OF LEGITIMATE FLORAL VISITS MADE BY BUMBLEBEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS TO BOTH I. FULVA AND I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS. WE ALSO ASSAYED INTRASPECIFIC AND INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER EFFECTIVENESS AMONG BUMBLEBEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS VISITING I. FULVA AND I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS USING POWDERED FLUORESCENT DYE AS A POLLEN ANALOGUE. RESULTS: THE PROPORTION OF LEGITIMATE HUMMINGBIRD VISITS WAS HIGHER IN I. FULVA FLOWERS THAN IN I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS, AND HUMMINGBIRDS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AT TRANSFERRING POLLEN AMONG I. FULVA FLOWERS THAN BETWEEN I. FULVA AND I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS OR AMONG I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS. CONVERSELY, THE PROPORTION OF BUMBLEBEE VISITS THAT WERE LEGITIMATE WAS HIGHER IN I. BREVICAULIS THAN IN I. FULVA, AND BUMBLEBEES WERE MORE EFFECTIVE AT TRANSFERRING POLLEN AMONG I. BREVICAULIS FLOWERS THAN BETWEEN I. BREVICAULIS AND I. FULVA FLOWERS OR AMONG I. FULVA FLOWERS. CALCULATIONS OF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION (RI) WERE QUITE HIGH SUCH THAT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION DUE TO HUMMINGBIRD VISITATION LEGITIMACY WAS CALCULATED AS RI=0.892, AND THAT DUE TO BUMBLEBEE VISITATION LEGITIMACY AS RI= 0.557.

FORBES SJ;NORTHFIELD TD,FORBES SJ,INCREASED POLLINATOR HABITAT ENHANCES CACAO FRUIT SET AND PREDATOR CONSERVATION,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,ECOL. APPL.,"THE UNIQUE BENEFITS OF WILD POLLINATORS TO THE PRODUCTIVITY OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED IN RECENT DECADES. HOWEVER, DECLINES IN POPULATIONS OF WILD POLLINATOR SPECIES, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE CONVERSION OF NATURAL HABITAT TO AGRICULTURAL LAND AND BROAD-SPECTRUM PESTICIDE USE OFTEN LEAD REDUCTIONS IN THE PROVISION OF POLLINATION SERVICES AND CROP PRODUCTION. WITH GROWING EVIDENCE THAT TARGETED POLLINATOR CONSERVATION IMPROVES CROP YIELD AND/OR QUALITY, PARTICULARLY FOR POLLINATION SPECIALIST CROPS, EFFORTS ARE INCREASING TO SUBSTITUTE AGRICULTURALLY INTENSIVE PRACTICES WITH THOSE THAT ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURE ON POLLINATORS AND THE POLLINATION SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, IN PART THROUGH THE PROVISION OF SUITABLE POLLINATOR HABITAT. FURTHER, SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE RESPONSES OF SOME POLLINATORS AND PREDATORS TO HABITAT MANAGEMENT SUGGEST THAT EFFORTS TO CONSERVE POLLINATORS MAY ALSO ENCOURAGE PREDATOR DENSITIES. WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF ONE HABITAT MANAGEMENT PRACTICE, THE ADDITION OF CACAO FRUIT HUSKS TO A MONOCULTURE CACAO FARM, ON THE PROVISION OF POLLINATION SERVICES AND THE DENSITIES OF TWO GROUPS OF ENTOMOPHAGOUS PREDATORS. WE ALSO EVALUATED THE IMPACTS OF CACAO FRUIT HUSK ADDITION ON POLLEN LIMITATION, BY CROSSING THIS HABITAT MANIPULATION WITH POLLEN SUPPLEMENTATION TREATMENTS. THE ADDITION OF CACAO FRUIT HUSKS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FRUITS PER TREE AND ALONG WITH HAND POLLINATION TREATMENTS, INCREASED FINAL YIELDS INDICATING A PROMOTION OF THE POLLINATION ECOSYSTEM SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE SPECIALIST POLLINATORS, MIDGES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT CACAO FRUIT HUSK ADDITION INCREASED THE DENSITIES OF TWO PREDATOR GROUPS, SPIDERS AND SKINKS. FURTHER, THE CONSERVATION OF THESE PREDATORS DID NOT INHIBIT POLLINATION THROUGH POLLINATOR CAPTURE OR DETERRENCE. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT, WITH MODERATE HABITAT MANAGEMENT, BOTH POLLINATOR AND PREDATOR CONSERVATION CAN BE COMPATIBLE GOALS WITHIN A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR SYSTEM. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS HABITAT MANIPULATION MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HABITAT AND FOOD RESOURCES FOR BOTH POLLINATORS AND PREDATORS. THE RESULTS EXEMPLIFY A WIN-WIN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION, WHEREBY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES TO SUPPORT VITAL POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION SERVICES CAN INCREASE PRODUCTION AS WELL AS SUPPORT SPECIES CONSERVATION.",AGRICULTURE; BIODIVERSITY; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HABITAT MANAGEMENT; NATURAL PREDATORS; POLLINATION; THEOBROMA CACAO; WILD POLLINATORS,ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CROP POLLINATION; AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES; FLOWERING PLANTS; BEE COMMUNITIES; PEST-MANAGEMENT; BREEDING SITES; COCOA FLOWERS; TRADE-OFFS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,12,"FORBES, SJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV, CTR TROP ENVIRONM \& SUSTAINABIL SCI, COLL SCI \& ENGN, POB 6811, CAIRNS, QLD 4870, AUSTRALIA.;FORBES, SAMANTHA J., NORTHFIELD, TOBIN D., JAMES COOK UNIV, CTR TROP ENVIRONM \& SUSTAINABIL SCI, COLL SCI \& ENGN, POB 6811, CAIRNS, QLD 4870, AUSTRALIA.",10.1002/EAP.1491,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY THROUGH A COWAN GRANT TRUST SCHOLARSHIP,"WE THANK THE PUGLISI FAMILY AND DAINTREE ESTATES FOR ACCESS TO THE STUDY SITE AND NECESSARY FACILITIES AND JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY FOR FUNDING THROUGH A COWAN GRANT TRUST SCHOLARSHIP TO S.

VENOM. ANIM. TOXINS TROP. DIS.,"BACKGROUND: MASS SPECTROMETRY-GUIDED VENOM PEPTIDE PROFILING IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO EXPLORE NOVEL SUBSTANCES FROM VENOMOUS ANIMALS IN A HIGHLY SENSITIVE MANNER. IN THIS STUDY, THIS PEPTIDE PROFILING APPROACH IS SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED TO EXPLORE THE VENOM PEPTIDES OF A JAPANESE SOLITARY CARPENTER BEE, XYLOCOPA APPENDICULATA (HYMENOPTERA: APOIDEA: APIDAE: ANTHOPHILA: XYLOCOPINAE: XYLOCOPINI). ALTHOUGH INTERESTING BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE CRUDE VENOM OF CARPENTER BEES HAVE BEEN REPORTED, THE STRUCTURE AND BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION OF THE VENOM PEPTIDES HAVE NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED YET. METHODS: THE VENOM PEPTIDE PROFILING OF THE CRUDE VENOM OF X. APPENDICULATA WAS PERFORMED BY MATRIX-ASSISTED LASER DESORPTION/IONIZATION-TIME OF FLIGHT MASS SPECTROSCOPY. THE VENOM WAS PURIFIED BY A REVERSE-PHASE HPLC. THE PURIFIED PEPTIDES WERE SUBJECTED TO THE EDMAN DEGRADATION, MS/MS ANALYSIS, AND/OR MOLECULAR CLONING METHODS FOR PEPTIDE SEQUENCING. BIOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION WAS PERFORMED BY CIRCULAR DICHROISM ANALYSIS, LIPOSOME LEAKAGE ASSAY, AND ANTIMICROBIAL, HISTAMINE RELEASING AND HEMOLYTIC ACTIVITY TESTS. RESULTS: THREE NOVEL PEPTIDES WITH M/Z 16508, 1939.3, AND 1900.3 WERE ISOLATED FROM THE VENOM OF X. APPENDICULATA. THE PEPTIDE WITH M/Z 16508 WAS CHARACTERIZED AS A SECRETORY PHOSPHOLIPASE A(2) (PLA(2)) HOMOLOG IN WHICH THE CHARACTERISTIC CYSTEINE RESIDUES AS WELL AS THE ACTIVE SITE RESIDUES FOUND IN BEE PLA(2)S ARE HIGHLY CONSERVED. TWO NOVEL PEPTIDES WITH M/Z 1939.3 AND M/Z 1900.3 WERE NAMED AS XAC-1 AND XAC-2, RESPECTIVELY. THESE PEPTIDES ARE FOUND TO BE AMPHIPHILIC AND DISPLAYED ANTIMICROBIAL AND HEMOLYTIC ACTIVITIES. THE POTENCY WAS ALMOST THE SAME AS THAT OF MASTOPARAN ISOLATED FROM THE WASP VENOM. CONCLUSION: WE FOUND THREE NOVEL BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE PEPTIDES IN THE VENOM OF X.

THESE ACTIONS ALL REQUIRE PRACTITIONERS TO DETERMINE WHAT MIXTURE OF PLANT SPECIES TO SELECT TO BEST SUPPORT DIVERSE AND FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS. LIKE IN THE SELECTION OF AREAS FOR NATURE RESERVES, PLANT CHOICES MUST BALANCE FUNCTION AGAINST DIFFERENCES IN COST. TO DATE, PLANT MIXES HAVE BEEN COMPILED USING EXPERT OPINION BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES, BUT RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS HAVE CALLED FOR A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO OPTIMIZE MIXTURES. WE APPLIED A DECISION ANALYTIC APPROACH TO SELECT BEST FLOWERING MIXES TO MEET TWO SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES AT THE LEAST COST: MAXIMIZING TOTAL BEE RICHNESS OR MAXIMIZING CROP POLLINATING BEES. THE MODEL IDENTIFIED BEST PLANT MIXES FOR EACH OBJECTIVE ACROSS A RANGE OF BUDGETS. ACCOUNTING FOR THE VARIATION IN COSTS AMONG PLANT SPECIES ALLOWED FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COST EFFECTIVE MIXES WITH LITTLE LOSS IN ACHIEVING THE TARGET OBJECTIVE. INCLUDING MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES SIMULTANEOUSLY REVEALED THE POWER OF THE APPROACH TO MEET COMPLEX GOALS. THE RESULTING MIX SUPPORTED OVER 96\% OF THE BEE SPECIES FOR BOTH GOALS AT NO DIFFERENCE IN COST.

WE ALSO EXPLORED POLLEN STRUCTURE, GERMINATION AND STIGMA RECEPTIVITY. SEPAL GROWTH WAS INITIALLY RAPID AND GRADUALLY SLOWED DOWN AS GROWTH OF THE INNER WHORLS ACCELERATED. HETERANTHERY AROSE EARLY DURING FLOWER DEVELOPMENT AND WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY MORPHOLOGICAL OR HISTOCHEMICAL DIFFERENCES IN POLLEN GRAINS, SUGGESTING THAT STAMEN DIFFERENTIATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE ` DIVISION-OF-LABOUR' HYPOTHESIS WAS IN NO WAY ASSOCIATED WITH POLLEN DIFFERENCES. THE STIGMA WAS RECEPTIVE AND POLLEN GRAINS FROM BOTH ANTHER MORPHS WERE VIABLE BEFORE ANTHESIS.

LOCATIONSOUTHEAST REGION OF BRAZIL. METHODSWE CLASSIFIED TREE SPECIES FOUND IN A TOTAL OF 40 FOREST SITES (18 PRIMARY, 11 RESTORED, 11 SECONDARY) ACCORDING TO POLLINATION MODE, BASED ON THE LITERATURE. WE CALCULATED AND COMPARED FUNCTIONAL DISSIMILARITY DISTANCES, AMOUNTS OF SPECIES AND ACCUMULATED ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATION MODES, AND FUNCTIONAL INDICES OF RICHNESS AND EVENNESS BETWEEN FOREST TYPES. RESULTSFUNCTIONAL DISSIMILARITY DISTANCES WERE MUCH SMALLER THAN SPECIES DISSIMILARITY DISTANCES WITHIN FOREST TYPES (MEAN <20\%, >80\%, RESPECTIVELY), INDICATING A SMALL VARIATION IN POLLINATION MODES BETWEEN SITES. FUNCTIONAL INDICES OF RICHNESS AND EVENNESS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN FOREST TYPES. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND IN THE SPECIES AND ABUNDANCE PROPORTIONS OF SEVERAL POLLINATION MODES. PRIMARY FORESTS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY THE PREDOMINANCE OF GENERALIZED INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES, FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY PROPORTIONS OF BEE, WIND AND MOTH POLLINATION, OTHER POLLINATION MODES WERE UNDERREPRESENTED. IN RESTORED FORESTS, REDUCTIONS WERE FOUND IN GENERALIZED INSECT, MOTH, WIND, FLY, POLLEN-CONSUMING INSECT AND VERY-SMALL INSECT POLLINATION, WHEREAS THE SPECIES POLLINATED BY BEES AND BATS MORE THAN DOUBLED. SMALLER CHANGES WERE FOUND AMONG SECONDARY FORESTS, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN MOTH, FLY AND FIG-WASP POLLINATION, WHEREAS THERE WERE INCREMENTAL CHANGES IN BEE, BEETLE, BIG ANIMAL AND SMALL INSECT POLLINATION. CONCLUSIONSOUR RESULTS INDICATE A RATHER STABLE ASSEMBLAGE OF POLLINATION MODES AND ALSO HIGH ECOLOGICAL REDUNDANCY AMONG TREES REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIES REPLACEMENT AT THE REGIONAL SCALE. MAJOR CHANGES AMONG RESTORED FORESTS ARE PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO LARGER DISTURBANCE EFFECTS AND/OR RESTORATION PRACTICES CONDUCTED IN THESE SITES. IN CONTRAST, SMALLER CHANGES AMONG SECONDARY FORESTS COULD BE IN RESPONSE TO SMALLER DISTURBANCE EFFECTS AND NATURAL SELECTION PROCESSES, AND ALSO SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT HIGHLY RESILIENT DEGRADED AREAS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECUPERATE THEIR FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY THROUGH NATURAL REGENERATION ALONE.

EVOL.,"WILDFLOWER STRIPS (WFS) ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO COUNTERACT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. TO DATE, IT IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD HOW WFS PROMOTE FLOWER VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES IN NEARBY INSECT-POLLINATED CROPS. WE THEREFORE ASK WHETHER WFS ENHANCE POLLINATION SERVICE IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS, AND HOW SUCH AN EFFECT DEPENDS ON THE DISTANCE FROM WFS. OVER 2 YEARS, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF EXPERIMENTALLY SOWN WFS COMPARED TO GRASSY STRIPS ON POLLINATION SERVICES IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA ANANASSA) CROPS ACROSS A TOTAL OF 19 STUDY SITES. MOREOVER, WE EXAMINED FLOWER VISITATION, SPECIES RICHNESS AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT INSECT POLLINATOR TAXA AT DIFFERENT WITHIN-FIELD LOCATIONS VARYING IN DISTANCE TO WFS. WE FOUND INCREASED POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE EDGE OF WFS COMPARED TO LOCALLY REDUCED POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE CENTER, WHICH RESULTED IN NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SEED SET BETWEEN WFS AND CONTROL FIELDS. TOTAL FLOWER VISITS AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS WERE HIGHER IN WFS THAN IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY FIELDS. MOREOVER, WILD BEE VISITATION WAS ENHANCED IN ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS NEAR WFS COMPARED TO FIELD CENTERS, AND INTERMEDIATE AT FIELD EDGES NEAR GRASSY STRIPS. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT DIVERSE WFS CAN INCREASE WILD BEE VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD EDGES OF ADJACENT STRAWBERRY CROPS, BUT THAT OVERALL VISITATION AND POLLINATION SERVICES DO NOT INCREASE. MOREOVER, OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT MAJOR POLLINATOR TAXA EXHIBIT DISTINCT RESPONSES, RESULTING IN A SHIFT OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AS A FUNCTION OF DISTANCE TO WFS WITH DIRECT EFFECTS ON CROP POLLINATION. OUR RESULTS THAT WFS ENHANCE RATHER THAN REDUCE CROP POLLINATION SERVICES NEAR WFS SHOULD DISTRACT POSSIBLE CONCERNS BY FARMERS THAT WFS MAY LOCALLY ABSORB RATHER THAN EXPORT CROP POLLINATORS.

MORPHOLOGICAL CONVERGENCES OF FLOWER TRAITS HAVE ALLOWED FLOWERS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR ATTRACTION TO POLLINATOR AGENTS LEADING TO THE CONCEPT OF POLLINATION SYNDROMES. DUE TO HABITAT HETEROGENEITY, LOW WATER RETENTION AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN THE SOIL, AS WELL AS BROAD ALTITUDINAL RANGE OF THE SYSTEM, PLANTS OFTEN SHOW RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTIONS IN RUPESTRIAN GRASSLANDS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE FLORAL BIOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE ASPECTS OF COLLAEA CIPOENSIS, A SHRUB RESTRICTED TO SMALL PATCHES ALONGSIDE WATERCOURSES IN RUPESTRIAN GRASSLANDS OF SERRA DO CIPO, BRAZIL. SPECIFICALLY, WEEXAMINED THE DEPENDENCE ON POLLINATORS TO SET FRUITS AND THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF FLORAL VISITORS (I.E. POLLINATORS, NECTAR-ROBBERS, NECTAR-THIEVES, AND FLORIVORES). COLLAEA CIPOENSIS IS A STRICTLY XENOGAMOUS SPECIES AND TWO HUMMINGBIRDS (COLIBRI SERRIROSTRIS AND EUPETOMENA MACROURA) ARE ITS POTENTIAL POLLINATORS. ALTHOUGH C. SERRIROSTRIS ALSO BEHAVES AS ILLEGITIMATE VISITOR, IT REPRESENTS 90\% OF LEGITIMATE VISITS, THUS BEING THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATOR. HOWEVER, THE MOST COMMON FLOWER VISITORS ARE TWO IMPORTANT NECTAR-ROBBERS, THE BEE TRIGONA SPINIPES AND THE SYRPHID TOXOMERUS MUSICUS. THE SPECIES IS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND POLLEN-LIMITED, AS HAND-POLLINATION INCREASED FRUIT PRODUCTION MORE THAN 50\%. STILL, HAND-POLLINATION SET ONLY 20\% OF FRUITS AND 48\% OF SEEDS. OVERALL, THE DEPENDENCE ON CROSS-POLLINATION, THE STRESSFUL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND THE HIGH FLORAL VISITATION RATES BY ILLEGITIMATE VISITORS MAY LIMIT REPRODUCTION OF THIS SPECIES, LEADING TO A FITNESS REDUCTION.

ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION IS AN APPROACH TO MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW ANIMAL COMMUNITIES AND PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS RESPOND TO THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF LAND-USE LEGACIES AND RESTORATION. WE INVESTIGATED HOW RESTORATION AND AGRICULTURAL HISTORY AFFECT BEE (HYMENOPTERA: APOIDEA: ANTHOPHILA) COMMUNITIES AND POLLINATION FUNCTION. IN 27 PAIRED REMNANT (NO HISTORY OF AGRICULTURE) AND POST-AGRICULTURAL LONGLEAF PINE (PINUS PALUSTRIS MILL.) WOODLANDS, WE ESTABLISHED 4-10 1-HA PLOTS (126 TOTAL) AND EXPERIMENTALLY RESTORED HALF OF THEM, WHILE THE OTHER HALF WERE LEFT AS UNRESTORED CONTROLS. RESTORATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH CANOPY THINNING WHICH REINSTATES OPEN SAVANNA-LIKE CONDITIONS. WE COLLECTED BEES IN EACH PLOT USING A COMBINATION OF BOWL TRAPPING AND STANDARDIZED NETTING TRANSECTS. THINNING INCREASED BEE ABUNDANCE BY 169\% AND BEE RICHNESS BY 110\%, BUT AGRICULTURAL LAND USE HAD NO EFFECT ON THESE VARIABLES. BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS AFFECTED BY RESTORATION AND WAS MARGINALLY AFFECTED BY AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. TO MEASURE POLLINATION FUNCTION, WE CONDUCTED A SENTINEL PLANT EXPERIMENT IN WHICH POTTED BLACK MUSTARD (BRASSICA NIGRA L.) PLANTS WERE PLACED OUT IN A SUBSET OF THESE SITES (N=10) AND EITHER BAGGED TO EXCLUDE POLLINATORS OR LEFT OPEN FOR POLLINATOR ACCESS. THEN, WE MEASURED FRUIT AND SEED SET OF SENTINEL PLANTS TO COMPARE POLLINATION FUNCTION AMONG THE RESTORATION AND LAND-USE HISTORY TREATMENTS. SEED SET AND FRUIT SET OF SENTINEL PLANTS WERE HIGHER IN OPEN THAN BAGGED PLANTS, INDICATING THAT THIS MODEL SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY MEASURED POLLINATION, BUT WE FOUND NO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION BASED ON RESTORATION OR AGRICULTURAL HISTORY. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ALTHOUGH POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES MAY SHOW CLEAR RESPONSES TO RESTORATION THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF PRIOR LAND-USE IMPACTS, THIS DOES NOT NECESSARILY TRANSLATE INTO DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATION FUNCTION AFTER RESTORATION.",AGRICULTURAL HISTORY; COMMUNITY ECOLOGY; ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LAND-USE LEGACY; LONGLEAF PINE SAVANNA,AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE; USE HISTORY; PLANT-COMMUNITIES; SOIL PROPERTIES; USE LEGACIES; FOREST; HYMENOPTERA; ECOSYSTEM; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"BRELAND, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, 612 WILSON RD,ROOM 368, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;BRELAND, SABRIE, TURLEY, NASH E., BRUDVIG, LARS A., MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT PLANT BIOL, 612 WILSON RD,ROOM 368, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;TURLEY, NASH E., ISAACS, RUFUS, BRUDVIG, LARS A., MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, PROGRAM ECOL EVOLUTIONARY BIOL \& BEHAV, 293 FARM LANE, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;GIBBS, JASON, ISAACS, RUFUS, MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, 578 WILSON RD,ROOM 202 CIPS, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;TURLEY, NASH E., UNIV CENT FLORIDA, DEPT BIOL, BIOL, 4110 LIBRA DR,BLDG 20,ROOM 312, ORLANDO, FL 32816 USA.;GIBBS, JASON, UNIV MANITOBA, DEPT ENTOMOL, ROOM 213,ENTOMOL BLDG, WINNIPEG, MB R3T 2N2, CANADA.",10.1002/ECS2.2435,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",E02435,"DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, FOREST SERVICE, SAVANNAH RIVERUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)UNITED STATES FOREST SERVICE [DE-EM0003622]; DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY, AIKEN, SCUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY (DOE)","WE THANK JOHN BLAKE, LINDSEY KEMMERLING, JOE LEDVINA, STEPHEN MCCANN, JOHN ORROCK, ED OLSON, AND EMMA YORK FOR ASSISTANCE WITH CREATING AND MAINTAINING THIS EXPERIMENT AND COLLECTING DATA.

GENERAL THEORY PREDICTING WHICH FACTORS DRIVE SPECIES INVASION SUCCESS AND SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS ON NATIVE ECOSYSTEMS IS PARTICULARLY LACKING. WE ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM USING A CONSUMER-RESOURCE MODEL OF ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR AND POPULATION DYNAMICS TO EVALUATE THE INVASION SUCCESS OF ALIEN POLLINATORS INTO PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS AND THEIR IMPACT ON NATIVE SPECIES. WE INTRODUCE POLLINATOR SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT FORAGING TRAITS INTO NETWORK MODELS WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SPECIES RICHNESS, CONNECTANCE, AND NESTEDNESS. AMONG 31 FACTORS TESTED, INCLUDING NETWORK AND ALIEN PROPERTIES, WE FIND THAT ALIENS WITH HIGH FORAGING EFFICIENCY ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INVADERS. NETWORKS EXHIBITING HIGH ALIEN-NATIVE DIET OVERLAP, FRACTION OF ALIEN-VISITED PLANT SPECIES, MOST-GENERALIST PLANT CONNECTIVITY, AND NUMBER OF SPECIALIST POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE THE MOST IMPACTED BY INVADERS.

RESEARCH ON SUCH PROCESSES, AS WELL AS EXPANDING USE OF GENE-MANIPULATION AND GENE EXPRESSION TECHNOLOGIES, REQUIRES A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THESE BEES DEVELOP. DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH OFTEN USES TIME-STAGING OF PUPAE, HOWEVER DRAMATIC SIZE DIFFERENCES IN THESE BEES CAN GENERATE VARIATION IN DEVELOPMENTAL TIMING. TO STUDY DEVELOPMENTAL MECHANISMS IN BUMBLE BEES, APPROPRIATE STAGING OF DEVELOPING BEES USING MORPHOLOGY IS NECESSARY. IN THIS STUDY, WE DESCRIBE MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES ACROSS DEVELOPMENT IN SEVERAL BUMBLE BEE SPECIES AND USE THIS TO ESTABLISH MORPHOLOGY-BASED STAGING CRITERIA, ESTABLISHING 20 DISTINCT ILLUSTRATED STAGES. THESE CRITERIA, DEFINED LARGELY BY EYE AND CUTICLE PIGMENTATION PATTERNS, ARE GENERALIZABLE ACROSS MEMBERS OF THE SUBGENUS PYROBOMBUS, AND CAN BE USED AS A FRAMEWORK FOR STUDY OF OTHER BUMBLE BEE SUBGENERA.

DISTRIB.,"AIMRANGE-RESTRICTED SPECIES ARE OF HIGH CONSERVATION CONCERN, AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY INTERACT WITH MORE WIDESPREAD SPECIES HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THEIR PERSISTENCE. HERE, WE DETERMINE HOW THE SPECIALIZATION OF MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS VARIES WITH RESPECT TO THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE SIZE OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AND ASSESS HOW THEY RESPOND TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ALIEN HONEYBEE. WE ALSO COMPARE NETWORK CHARACTERISTICS (CONNECTANCE, SPECIALIZATION AND NESTEDNESS) BETWEEN AN INVADED LOW MOUNTAIN AND NON-INVADED HIGH MOUNTAIN NETWORK. LOCATIONST KATHERINE PROTECTORATE, SOUTH SINAI, EGYPT. METHODSWE QUANTIFIED BEE-PLANT INTERACTIONS IN 42 PLOTS BETWEEN APRIL AND JULY 2013 AND CREATED VISITATION NETWORKS FOR THE LOW MOUNTAINS (BEEHIVES PRESENT) AND THE HIGH MOUNTAINS (BEEHIVES ABSENT). WE THEN COMPARED VISITATION NETWORK METRICS BETWEEN RANGE-RESTRICTED, REGIONALLY DISTRIBUTED AND WIDESPREAD PLANTS AND POLLINATORS AND ASSESSED TOPOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE LOW AND HIGH MOUNTAIN NETWORKS. RESULTSRANGE-RESTRICTED BEES WERE INVOLVED IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF TOTAL INTERACTIONS THAN REGIONAL AND WIDESPREAD NATIVE BEES, BUT SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF INCREASED GENERALIZATION. IN CONTRAST, RANGE-RESTRICTED PLANTS WERE INVOLVED IN FEWER INTERACTIONS AND EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SPECIALIZATION AND A HIGH DEPENDENCY ON RANGE-RESTRICTED POLLINATORS. THE INTRODUCED HONEYBEE ACTED AS A SUPER-GENERALIST AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN NETWORK-LEVEL GENERALIZATION AND NESTEDNESS. HONEYBEES EXHIBITED HIGH LEVELS OF RESOURCE OVERLAP WITH RANGE-RESTRICTED BEES AND MADE FEW VISITS TO RANGE-RESTRICTED PLANT SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONSRANGE-RESTRICTED PLANTS ARE MORE SPECIALIZED IN THEIR INTERACTIONS THAN RANGE-RESTRICTED POLLINATORS, SUGGESTING THAT THE FORCES SHAPING THE STRUCTURE OF INTERACTION NETWORK CAN VARY BETWEEN PARTNERS. ALIEN HONEYBEES MADE FEW VISITS TO RANGE-RESTRICTED PLANTS, BUT EXHIBITED DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH LEVELS OF FLORAL COMPETITION WITH RANGE-RESTRICTED BEES.

WE COMPARED THE FORAGE FLORAL DIVERSITY OF THREE TYPES OF LOWLAND MEADOWS (MOLINIA MEADOWS, TALL HERB FRINGE MEADOWS, AND HAY MEADOWS) LOCATED IN SOUTH EASTERN POLAND. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES WAS 125, INCLUDING 84 SPECIES (67.2\%) CLASSIFIED AS PLANTS VISITED BY INSECTS. THE RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF FORAGE FLORA DIFFERED BETWEEN THE TYPES OF MEADOW. THE MOLINIA MEADOWS AND HAY MEADOWS WERE PREFERRED BY POLLINATORS.

WE FOUND EIGHT KEY PESTS, INCLUDING SPOTTED WING DROSOPHILA, LEAFHOPPERS, AND THRIPS, AND SEVEN KEY NATURAL ENEMIES INCLUDING PARASITOID WASPS, SPIDERS, AND LACEWINGS, THAT WERE COMMON ACROSS ALL SITES. PEST POPULATIONS WERE UP TO 6.6 TIMES HIGHER IN TUNNELS, AND PESTS TYPICAL OF GREENHOUSE SYSTEMS BECAME MORE DOMINANT IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. NATURAL ENEMIES OBSERVED ON PLANTS UNDER TUNNELS WERE ALSO MORE ABUNDANT THAN IN THE FIELD, BUT THIS TREND WAS REVERSED FOR NATURAL ENEMIES TRAPPED ON YELLOW STICKY CARDS. THERE WAS ALSO A REDUCTION OF BOTH HONEY BEES AND WILD BEES UNDER THE HIGH TUNNELS, WHICH WAS BALANCED BY USE OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES.

TECHNOL.,"MASS-FLOWERING CROPS PROVIDE FORAGE FOR BEES BUT ALSO CONTAIN PESTICIDES. SUCH PESTICIDE EXPOSURE CAN HARM BEES, BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THIS COST IS BALANCED BY FORAGE BENEFITS IS LIMITED. TO PROVIDE INSIGHTS INTO BENEFITS AND COSTS, WE PLACED BUMBLEBEE COLONIES IN 18 LANDSCAPES WITH CONVENTIONAL RED CLOVER FIELDS TREATED WITH THE NEONICOTINOID THIACLOPRID (FLOWERS + PESTICIDE), UNTREATED ORGANIC RED CLOVER FIELDS (FLOWERS), OR LANDSCAPES LACKING CLOVER FIELDS (CONTROLS). COLONIES GREW HEAVIER NEAR THIACLOPRID-TREATED CLOVER COMPARED TO CONTROLS LACKING CLOVER, WHILE COLONIES NEAR UNTREATED CLOVER DID NOT DIFFER FROM COLONIES IN NEITHER OF THE OTHER LANDSCAPE TYPES. THIACLOPRID TREATMENT EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED PESTS AND INCREASED BUMBLEBEE CROP VISITATION. HOWEVER, COLONY PRODUCTION OF QUEENS AND MALES DID NOT DIFFER AMONG LANDSCAPE TYPES. IN CONCLUSION, THIACLOPRID APPLICATION IN CLOVER APPEARS TO BE OF LOW RISK FOR BUMBLEBEES. MORE GENERALLY, NEONICOTINOIDS MAY NOT BE EQUALLY HARMFUL WHEN USED IN FLOWERING CROPS AND EFFECTIVE LOW-RISK PEST CONTROL IN SUCH CROPS COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT BUMBLEBEES AND CROP POLLINATION.",NA,COLONY GROWTH; NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; BEE; QUEEN; POLLINATORS; MANAGEMENT; TOXICITY; SCALE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"RUNDLOF, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), LUND UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SE-22362 LUND, SWEDEN.;RUNDLOF, MAJ, LUND UNIV, DEPT BIOL, SE-22362 LUND, SWEDEN.;LUNDIN, OLA, SWEDISH UNIV AGR SCI, DEPT ECOL, SE-75007 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.",10.1021/ACS.EST.9B02789,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",NA,SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL VRSWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL [330-2014-6439]; CARL TRYGGER FOUNDATION FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH; RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT BECC (BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A CHANGING CLIMATE); EU THROUGH THE FP7 PROJECT ``STEP STATUS AND TRENDS OF EUROPEAN POLLINATORS [244090],"THE AUTHORS ARE GRATEFUL TO THE FARMERS FOR ALLOWING THEM TO WORK ON THEIR LAND; T.

ECOL.,"POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONSTRAIN FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WITHIN PLANT POPULATIONS, YET POPULATIONS WITH HIGH COLOR VARIATION (AT LEAST IN HUMAN VISUAL SPACE) ARE COMMON IN NATURE. TO EXPLORE THIS PARADOX, WE COLLECTED FLORAL REFLECTANCE SPECTRA FOR 34 POPULATIONS OF 14 PUTATIVELY BEE-POLLINATED PLANT SPECIES OF NORTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO, USA, AND TRANSLATED THEM INTO THREE DIFFERENT ANIMAL VISUAL SPACES. WE ASKED, (1) IS INTRAPOPULATION VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOR CONSTRAINED TO BE LOWER THAN THE DISCRIMINATION THRESHOLD OF THE PUTATIVE DOMINANT POLLINATORS? AND, (2) IS PERCEIVED INTRAPOPULATION VARIATION IN FLOWERS HIGHER FOR NON-POLLINATING ANIMALS THAN IT IS FOR THE PRESUMED DOMINANT POLLINATOR GROUP? WE FOUND EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH SOME POLLINATOR-IMPOSED CONSTRAINTS ON FLORAL COLOR IN OUR SPECIES, WITH THE MAJORITY (70.6\%) OF POPULATIONS HAVING>95\% OF FLOWER-FLOWER OR FLOWER-CENTROID COMPARISONS (WHERE THE CENTROID REPRESENTS THE MEAN PHENOTYPE) ESTIMATED TO BE VISUALLY INDISCRIMINABLE TO BEES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT PERCEIVED FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FOR TWO NON-POLLINATING GROUPS-BIRDS AND HUMANS-THAN FOR BEES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A LARGE PORTION OF HUMAN-PERCEIVED FLORAL COLOR VARIATION WITHIN POPULATIONS PERSISTS BECAUSE IT IS EFFECTIVELY INVISIBLE TO POLLINATORS.

MICROBES THEMSELVES MAY REPRESENT A MAJOR DIETARY RESOURCE FOR DEVELOPING BEE LARVAE. DESPITE THEIR APPARENT IMPORTANCE IN SUSTAINING BEE HEALTH, EVIDENCE LINKING POLLEN-BORNE MICROBES TO LARVAL HEALTH IS CURRENTLY LACKING. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF MICROBE-DEFICIENT DIETS ON THE FITNESS OF LARVAL MASON BEES. IN A SERIES OF DIET MANIPULATIONS, MICROBE-RICH MATERNALLY COLLECTED POLLEN PROVISIONS WERE REPLACED WITH INCREASING FRACTIONS OF STERILIZED, MICROBE-DEFICIENT POLLEN PROVISIONS BEFORE BEING FED TO DEVELOPING LARVAE. CONVERGENT FINDINGS FROM AMINO ACID AND FATTY ACID TROPHIC BIOMARKER ANALYSES REVEALED THAT LARVAE DERIVED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF NUTRITION FROM MICROBIAL PREY AND OCCUPIED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER TROPHIC POSITION THAN THAT OF STRICT HERBIVORES. LARVAE FEEDING ON INCREASINGLY STERILE DIETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON GROWTH RATES, BIOMASS AND SURVIVORSHIP. WHEN COMPLETELY DEPRIVED OF POLLEN-BORNE MICROBES, LARVAE CONSISTENTLY EXHIBITED MARKED DECLINE IN FITNESS. WE CONCLUDE THAT MICROBES ASSOCIATED WITH AGED POLLEN PROVISIONS ARE CENTRAL TO BEE HEALTH, NOT ONLY AS NUTRITIONAL MUTUALISTS, BUT ALSO AS A MAJOR DIETARY COMPONENT.

J. BOT.,"PREMISE CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES OCCURRING IN SYMPATRY MAY EXPERIENCE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER IF REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION (RI) BARRIERS ARE NOT IN PLACE. WE EVALUATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PRE- AND POST-POLLINATION RI BARRIERS IN THREE SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF ACHIMENES (GESNERIACEAE), INCLUDING ECOGEOGRAPHIC, PHENOLOGICAL, FLORAL ISOLATION, SELF-POLLINATION, AND HYBRID VIABILITY (FRUIT AND SEED SET). METHODS WE RECORDED GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION THROUGHOUT SPECIES RANGES AND ASSESSED FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND POLLINATOR VISITATION AT ONE SITE IN CENTRAL MEXICO. IN THE GREENHOUSE, WE MEASURED FLORAL TRAITS INVOLVED IN RI AND QUANTIFIED FRUIT AND SEED SET FOR FROM SELF, INTRASPECIFIC, AND INTERSPECIFIC CROSSES. RESULTS ECOGEOGRAPHIC BARRIERS WERE IMPORTANT IN RI, BUT UNDER SYMPATRY, PHENOLOGICAL AND FLORAL BARRIERS CONTRIBUTED MORE TO TOTAL RI. PHENOLOGICAL RI VARIED BETWEEN SPECIES AND YEARS, WHILE FLORAL RI WAS 100\% EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING INTERSPECIFIC VISITATION. SPECIES SHOWED DIFFERENCES IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, COLOR, AND SCENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS (A. ANTIRRHINA-HUMMINGBIRDS, A. FLAVA-BEES, A. PATENS-BUTTERFLIES), HETEROSPECIFIC VISITATION EVENTS WERE RESTRICTED TO RARE SECONDARY POLLINATORS. HYBRID CROSSES CONSISTENTLY YIELDED PROGENY IN LOWER NUMBERS THAN INTRASPECIFIC CROSSES. CONCLUSIONS THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT NEITHER AUTOGAMY NOR EARLY POST-POLLINATION BARRIERS PREVENT INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN FLOW BETWEEN ACHIMENES SPECIES. HOWEVER, FLORAL ISOLATION, ACTING THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ATTRACTION AND REWARD TRAITS, CONSISTENTLY ENSURES SPECIFICITY OF THE POLLINATION SYSTEM.

WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC SUBLETHAL EXPOSURE OF THE NEONICOTINOID PESTICIDE IMIDACLOPRID ON THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS. THE ANALYTICAL STANDARD OF IMIDACLOPRID IN SUGAR SOLUTION WAS USED FOR THE TREATMENT. VERIFICATION OF PESTICIDES USING UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL BUMBLEBEES SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF ONLY TWO COMPOUNDS, IMIDACLOPRID AND IMIDACLOPRID-OLEFIN, WHICH WERE FOUND IN QUANTITIES OF 0.57 +/- 0.22 AND 1.95 +/- 0.43 NG/G, RESPECTIVELY. THUS, THE LEVEL OF THE DANGEROUS METABOLITE IMIDACLOPRID-OLEFIN WAS 3.4-FOLD HIGHER THAN THAT OF IMIDACLOPRID. LABEL-FREE NANOLC-MS/MS QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS OF BUMBLEBEE HEADS ENABLED QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF 2883 PROTEINS, AND 206 PROTEINS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE IMIDACLOPRID TREATMENT. THE NEXT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE HIGHLY DOWNREGULATED MARKERS ARE MEMBERS OF THE TERPENOID BACKBONE BIOSYNTHESIS PATHWAY (KEGG: BTER00900) AND THAT IMIDACLOPRID TREATMENT SUPPRESSED THE ENTIRE MEVALONATE PATHWAY, FATTY ACID SYNTHESIS AND ASSOCIATED MARKERS. THE PROTEOMICS RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF IMIDACLOPRID TREATMENT ARE COMPLEX, AND THE MARKER CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH METABOLIC AND NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES AND OLFACTION DISRUPTION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT MARKERS AND CAN HELP TO EXPLAIN THE WIDELY HELD ASSUMPTIONS FROM BIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS. SIGNIFICANCE: THE MAJOR FINDING IS THAT ALL MARKERS OF THE MEVALONATE PATHWAY WERE SUBSTANTIALLY DOWNREGULATED DUE TO THE CHRONIC IMIDACLOPRID EXPOSURE. THE DISBALANCE OF MEVALONATE PATHWAY HAS MANY IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES. WE SUGGEST THE MECHANISM ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOVEL TOXICOGENIC EFFECT OF IMIDACLOPRID.

ECOL.,"CONTEXTTHE RESPONSE OF RARE SPECIES TO HUMAN LAND USE IS POORLY KNOWN BECAUSE RARITY IS DIFFICULT TO STUDY, HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT BECAUSE RARE SPECIES COMPOSE MOST OF BIODIVERSITY, AND ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE. REGIONAL BEE POLLINATOR FAUNAS HAVE NOT BEEN ASSESSED FOR RARITY OUTSIDE OF EUROPE. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPES SUPPORT RARE NORTH AMERICAN BEE BIODIVERSITY.OBJECTIVESWE ASK HOW RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BEE SPECIES RESPOND TO LAND USE, WITHIN QUARTILES OF SPECIES DEFINED BY THEIR NUMERICAL, PHENOLOGICAL, AND GEOGRAPHICAL RARITY.METHODSWE CONDUCTED A FIELD STUDY TO SAMPLE BEE COMMUNITIES IN FORESTED, AGRICULTURAL, AND URBAN LANDSCAPES REPLICATED ACROSS A LARGE SPATIAL EXTENT OF THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

HERBERT SW;WALTON DA;WALLACE HM,HERBERT SW,"POLLEN-PARENT AFFECTS FRUIT, NUT AND KERNEL DEVELOPMENT OF MACADAMIA",SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,SCI. HORTIC.,"THE GENOTYPE OF THE POLLEN THAT FERTILIZES THE OVULE IS KNOWN TO AFFECT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF FRUITS AND NUTS FOR MANY SPECIES, A PHENOMENOM KNOWN AS THE XENIA EFFECT. CROSS-POLLINATION INCREASES FRUIT SET, NUT MASS, KERNEL MASS AND KERNEL RECOVERY OF MACADAMIA NUTS AT MATURITY WHEN COMPARED WITH SELF-POLLINATION. HOWEVER THERE IS LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE XENIC EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT MACADAMIA CULTIVARS USED AS CROSS POLLEN-PARENTS ON THE FRUIT COMPONENTS AND FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CLARIFY IN WHAT NUT COMPONENTS AND AT WHAT DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES XENIC EFFECTS OCCURRED. TWO LARGE-SEEDED MACADAMIA CULTIVARS, `HAES 246' AND `FIV A16', WERE USED AS MATERNAL TREES AND POLLEN-PARENTS WERE `HAES 246', `FIV A16' AND `HAES 814', A SMALL-SEEDED CULTIVAR. POLLEN-PARENTS AFFECTED THE MASS OF BOTH THE SYNGAMOUS TISSUE OF THE KERNEL (EMBRYO) AND THE TISSUES OF MATERNAL ORIGIN, I.E. THE HUSK (PERICARP) AND SHELL (TESTA). XENIC EFFECTS WERE DETECTED IN THE ENDOSPERM 6 WEEKS AFTER POLLINATION AND IN FRUIT, NUT AND KERNEL SIZE AND MASS FROM 10 WEEKS AFTER POLLINATION UNTIL MATURITY. NUT MASS, KERNEL MASS AND KERNEL RECOVERY OF MACADAMIA WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY A DIFFERENT POLLEN-PARENT. THE HV A16 POLLEN ON HAES 246 FLOWERS PRODUCED AN INCREASE OF 11\% NUT MASS COMPARED WITH HV 814 POLLEN ON HAES 246 FLOWERS. THIS WOULD INCREASE THE GROSS MARGIN OF A FARM PRODUCING 4.5 T/HA OF NUTS BY \$2574/HA AT TYPICAL 2018 PRICES.

DE LUCA PA;BUCHMANN S;GALEN C;MASON AC;VALLEJO-MARIN M,DE LUCA PA,DOES BODY SIZE PREDICT THE BUZZ-POLLINATION FREQUENCIES USED BY BEES?,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,ECOL. EVOL.,"BODY SIZE IS AN IMPORTANT TRAIT LINKING POLLINATORS AND PLANTS. MORPHOLOGICAL MATCHING BETWEEN POLLINATORS AND PLANTS IS THOUGHT TO REINFORCE POLLINATOR FIDELITY, AS THE CORRECT FIT ENSURES THAT BOTH PARTIES BENEFIT FROM THE INTERACTION. WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF BODY SIZE IN A SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM (BUZZ-POLLINATION) WHERE BEES VIBRATE FLOWERS TO RELEASE POLLEN CONCEALED WITHIN PORICIDAL STAMENS. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXPLORED HOW BODY SIZE INFLUENCES THE FREQUENCY OF BUZZ-POLLINATION VIBRATIONS. BODY SIZE IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT FREQUENCY AS A RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS IT PLACES ON THE INDIRECT FLIGHT MUSCLES THAT CONTROL THE PRODUCTION OF FLORAL VIBRATIONS. LARGER INSECTS BEAT THEIR WINGS LESS RAPIDLY THAN SMALLER-BODIED INSECTS WHEN FLYING, BUT WHETHER SIMILAR SCALING RELATIONSHIPS EXIST WITH FLORAL VIBRATIONS HAS NOT BEEN WIDELY EXPLORED. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN EJECTED IS DETERMINED BY THE FREQUENCY OF THE VIBRATION AND THE DISPLACEMENT OF A BEE'S THORAX. WE CONDUCTED A FIELD STUDY IN THREE ECOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS (ALPINE, DESERT, GRASSLAND) AND RECORDED FLIGHT AND FLORAL VIBRATIONS FROM FREELY FORAGING BEES FROM 27 SPECIES ACROSS FOUR FAMILIES. WE FOUND THAT FLORAL VIBRATION FREQUENCIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FLIGHT FREQUENCIES, BUT NEVER EXCEEDED 400HZ. ALSO, ONLY FLIGHT FREQUENCIES WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH BODY SIZE. AS A BEE'S SIZE INCREASED, ITS BUZZ RATIO (FLORAL FREQUENCY/FLIGHT FREQUENCY) INCREASED SUCH THAT ONLY THE LARGEST BEES WERE CAPABLE OF GENERATING FLORAL VIBRATION FREQUENCIES THAT EXCEEDED DOUBLE THAT OF THEIR FLIGHT VIBRATIONS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE SIZE AFFECTS THE CAPACITY OF BEES TO RAISE FLORAL VIBRATION FREQUENCIES SUBSTANTIALLY ABOVE FLIGHT FREQUENCIES. THIS MAY PUT SMALLER BEES AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM FLORAL VIBRATION FREQUENCY OF 400HZ, THEIR INABILITY TO ACHIEVE COMPARABLE THORACIC DISPLACEMENTS AS LARGER BEES WOULD RESULT IN GENERATING VIBRATIONS WITH LOWER AMPLITUDES, AND THUS LESS TOTAL POLLEN EJECTED FOR THE SAME FORAGING EFFORT.",ANTHOPHILA; BUZZ RATIO; FLORAL VIBRATIONS; FREQUENCY; PEDICULARIS; SOLANUM,VIBRATORY POLLEN COLLECTION; WINGBEAT FREQUENCY; FLORAL SONICATION; BUMBLEBEES; BEHAVIOR; MORPHOLOGY; INSECTS; FLOWERS; MUSCLE; ADAPTATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"DE LUCA, PA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BAHAMAS, SCH CHEM ENVIRONM \& LIFE SCI, NASSAU, BAHAMAS.;DE LUCA, PAUL A., UNIV BAHAMAS, SCH CHEM ENVIRONM \& LIFE SCI, NASSAU, BAHAMAS.;BUCHMANN, STEPHEN, UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ USA.;BUCHMANN, STEPHEN, UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ENTOMOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.;GALEN, CANDACE, UNIV MISSOURI, DIV BIOL SCI, COLUMBIA, MO 65211 USA.;MASON, ANDREW C., UNIV TORONTO SCARBOROUGH, DEPT BIOL SCI, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;VALLEJO-MARIN, MARIO, UNIV STIRLING, BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, STIRLING, SCOTLAND.",10.1002/ECE3.5092,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION GRANTNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY [9776-15]; NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [1257762]; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING),"THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY RESEARCH AND EXPLORATION GRANT (9776-15) TO PAD, ALONG WITH PARTIAL SUPPORT FROM A NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION GRANT (1257762) EXAMINING LEARNING AND FLORAL SONICATION IN BOMBUS IMPATIENS TO SLB, D.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATING INSECTS COMMERCIAL STRAWBERRY (FRAGARIA X ANANASSA) YIELDS WOULD FALL BY APPROXIMATELY 45\%, WHILE DAMAGE FROM APHIDS IS ESTIMATED TO COST GROWERS AT LEAST 1\% OF ANNUAL YIELDS IN THE UK ALONE. THIS COMBINED EFFECT COULD RESULT IN LOSSES OF OVER 100 MILLION PER YEAR FOR THE UK ECONOMY. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER INCORPORATING FLORAL RESOURCES WITHIN COMMERCIAL POLYTHENE-CLAD TUNNELS COULD IMPROVE POLLINATION SERVICES AND APHID CONTROL AND, HENCE, STRAWBERRY FRUIT QUALITY. IN A RANDOMISED BLOCK EXPERIMENT (USING 3 X 6 M PLOTS), CORIANDER (CORIANDRUM SATIVUM) FIELD FORGET-ME-NOT (MYOSOTIS ARVENSIS) AND CORN MINT (MENTHA ARVENSIS) PLANTS WERE INSERTED IN ROWS OF COMMERCIALLY-GROWN STRAWBERRIES. THEIR EFFECT ON NUMBERS OF NATURALLY OCCURRING FLOWER VISITORS, APHIDS AND APHID PREDATORS WAS COMPARED. COUNTS OF FLOWER VISITORS, INCLUDING VISITORS TO SOWN FLOWER SPECIES, WERE HIGHER IN CORIANDER AND MINT PLOTS. HOWEVER STRAWBERRY FLOWERS RECEIVED MORE INSECT VISITS IN CONTROL PLOTS. FRUIT FROM FORGET-ME-NOT PLOTS WERE LOWER IN SUGAR THAN FRUIT FROM CONTROLS, WHILE FRUIT FROM MINT PLOTS HAD FEWER FERTILISED SEEDS THAN FRUIT FROM CONTROL PLOTS. STRAWBERRIES FROM CORIANDER PLOTS DID NOT DIFFER FROM CONTROL FRUIT ON ANY FRUIT QUALITY MEASURES. CRUCIALLY, PROPORTIONS OF MARKETABLE FRUIT DID NOT DIFFER ACROSS TREATMENTS. APHID NUMBERS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN TREATMENTS EVEN THOUGH CORIANDER SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBERS OF LACEWING EGGS LAID ON APHID-INFESTED STRAWBERRY PLANTS IN CORIANDER PLOTS. HENCE, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROPORTIONS OF MARKETABLE FRUITS WITH INTERCROPPING, THE BENEFITS RECEIVED WERE LIMITED. IT MIGHT BE THAT IN A DIFFERENT GROWING SEASON THE EFFECT WOULD BE MORE PRONOUNCED BUT THIS WOULD NEED TO BE WEIGHED UP AGAINST THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING SUCH INTERVENTIONS.",BIOCONTROL; FLORAL RESOURCES; FRUIT QUALITY; INTERCROPPING; POLLINATION; STRAWBERRY,SOWN FLOWER STRIPS; GREEN LACEWINGS NEUROPTERA; WILD BEE ABUNDANCE; APHIDOPHAGOUS INSECTS; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; DIPTERA SYRPHIDAE; WILDFLOWER STRIPS; FIELD MARGINS; HOVERFLIES; DIVERSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"FOUNTAIN, MT (REPRINT AUTHOR), NIAB, EMR, NEW RD, EAST MAILING, KENT, ENGLAND.;HODGKISS, DYLAN, BROWN, MARK J.

ENTOMOL.,"THE NATIVE PRAIRIE OF THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY MODIFIED BY TWO RELATED FORCES: CONVERSION OF NATIVE PRAIRIE TO AGRICULTURAL FORMS OF LAND USE AND REMOVAL OF BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOGS (RODENTIA: SCIURIDAE, CYNOMYS LUDOVICIANUS (ORD, 1815)) THAT ACT AS ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS VIA THEIR BURROWING AND GRAZING ACTIVITIES. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW THESE CHANGES HAVE AFFECTED THE NATIVE BEE COMMUNITY. WE SURVEYED THE BEE COMMUNITIES IN RELATIVELY INTACT NATIVE PRAIRIE AT TWO NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES IN TEXAS, QUANTIFYING BEE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF GRAZING BY PRAIRIE DOGS. OVER A 5-MO SAMPLING PERIOD IN SPRING-SUMMER 2013, WE FOUND HIGH OVERALL BEE DIVERSITY (180 SPECIES, MOSTLY SOLITARY GROUND-NESTERS), WITH DIFFERENCES DETECTED IN DIVERSITY BETWEEN MULESHOE AND BUFFALO LAKE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES AS WELL AS ON AND OFF PRAIRIE DOG COLONIES. ALTHOUGH THE SAME THREE SPECIES DOMINATED THE BEE COMMUNITY AT BOTH REFUGES, MOST SPECIES WERE REPRESENTED BY RELATIVELY FEW INDIVIDUALS, LEADING TO OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN DIVERSITY (RICHNESS, EVENNESS, AND EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF SPECIES) BY REFUGE. BEE DIVERSITY DIFFERED BETWEEN SITES ON AND OFF PRAIRIE DOG COLONIES, BUT IN TRENDS THAT DIFFERED BY REFUGE AND BY INDEX, SUGGESTING THAT LOCATION WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PRAIRIE DOG PRESENCE.THESE RESULTS REPRESENT A REFERENCE FAUNA AGAINST WHICH OTHER REGIONAL BEE COMMUNITIES IN OTHER LAND-COVER TYPES CAN BE COMPARED, BUT THE HIGH SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY WE FOUND INDICATES THAT DETECTING EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE CHANGE ON NATIVE BEES WILL BE CHALLENGING.",BUFFALO LAKE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE; GRASSLAND; MULESHOE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE; NATIVE BEES; BLACK-TAILED PRAIRIE DOG (CYNOMYS LUDOVICIANUS),PRAIRIE DOG; CROP POLLINATION; NATIVE BEES; SPECIES RICHNESS; FORAGING RANGES; ABUNDANCE; CONSERVATION; HYMENOPTERA; LANDSCAPE; COMMUNITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"MCINTYRE, NE (REPRINT AUTHOR), TEXAS TECH UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, LUBBOCK, TX 79409 USA.;AUERBACH, EZRA S., MCINTYRE, NANCY E., TEXAS TECH UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, LUBBOCK, TX 79409 USA.;JOHNSON, WILLIAM P., US FISH \& WILDLIFE SERV, NATL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYST, CANYON, TX 79015 USA.;SMITH, JUDE R., US FISH \& WILDLIFE SERV, MULESHOE NATL WILDLIFE REFUGE, POB 549, MULESHOE, TX 79347 USA.",10.1093/EE/NVZ063,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE - CH FOUNDATION,"FIELD WORK AND SPECIMEN IDENTIFICATION WERE FUNDED BY U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE.

IN TWO DIPSACUS SPECIES, A DEFENSE COMPOUND, DIPSACUS SAPONIN [7], OCCURS IN POLLEN BUT NOT IN NECTAR. WE OBSERVED THAT BUMBLEBEES DISLIKED GROOMING BITTER-TASTING POLLEN WITH A HIGH SAPONIN CONTENT. MANIPULATION OF SAPONIN CONCENTRATIONS IN NECTAR AND MEASUREMENTS OF CORBICULAR POLLEN SHOWED THAT THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES DIFFERED IN THEIR TOLERANCE TO SAPONIN. THOSE SPECIES SUSCEPTIBLE TO SAPONIN GROOMED LITTLE DIPSACUS POLLEN INTO THEIR POLLEN LOADS, AND THEIR UNGROOMED POLLEN WAS OBSERVED TO BE EFFECTIVELY DELIVERED TO STIGMAS. BY REWARDING BEES WITH EDIBLE NECTAR, BUT NOT POLLEN, PLANTS SOLVE THE CONFLICT OF POLLEN PARTITIONING BETWEEN SEXUAL AND REWARD FUNCTIONS. UNGROOMED TOXIC POLLEN ON THE BEE BODY PROMOTES POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY, FACILITATING POLLINATION.",NA,FLORAL REWARDS; POLLINATORS; PLANTS; VISITORS; IMPACTS; FILTER; BIRD; SIZE; BEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"HUANG, SQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), CENT CHINA NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, INST EVOLUT \& ECOL, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WANG, XIAO-YUE, TANG, JU, WU, TING, WU, DI, HUANG, SHUANG-QUAN, CENT CHINA NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, INST EVOLUT \& ECOL, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WANG, XIAO-YUE, GUIZHOU NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, STATE KEY LAB SOUTHWEST KARST MT BIODIVERS CONSER, GUIYANG 550001, GUIZHOU, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.CUB.2019.03.023,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",NA,NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [31730012]; GUIZHOU SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT BASIC RESEARCH FOUNDATION [2019/1237],"WE THANK MIDDLE-SCHOOL STUDENT J.-Y.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"POLLINATORS SUCH AS BUMBLE BEES ARE IN DECLINE AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING LOSS OF HABITAT. INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE AND RESTORE POLLINATOR HABITAT ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR. HOWEVER, TO MOST EFFECTIVELY CONSERVE POLLINATORS, WE NEED A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH HABITATS LIMIT THEIR SURVIVAL AND FITNESS AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. OUR STUDY EXAMINED PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS OF THE COMMON EASTERN BUMBLE BEE, BOMBUS IMPATIENS (CRESSON), IN FOUR COMMON LANDSCAPES FOR BEES (NATURAL, SUBURBAN, CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE, AND ORGANIC AGRICULTURE). IN THE SUMMERS OF 2016 AND 2017, 64 BUMBLE BEE COLONIES PER YEAR WERE DEPLOYED ACROSS 16 SITES (4 SITES IN EACH LANDSCAPE TYPE IN EACH YEAR) AND THEIR GROWTH (WEIGHT AND BEE ABUNDANCE), FITNESS (CASTE PRODUCTION), AND SURVIVAL WERE MONITORED WEEKLY. COLONIES IN SUBURBAN SITES IN 2016, BUT NOT 2017, WERE LIGHTER, PRODUCED FEWER WORKER AND DRONE CELLS, AND EXPERIENCED QUEEN DEATH MORE QUICKLY THAN COLONIES IN NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS OF COLONIES IN NATURAL, ORGANIC AGRICULTURAL, AND CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES IN BOTH YEARS WERE SIMILAR. ADDITIONALLY, ACROSS ALL LANDSCAPE TYPES, THE PROPORTION OF DEVELOPED LAND AND IMPERVIOUS SURFACE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH COLONY PERFORMANCE IN 2016. THUS, OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES ARE SUBOPTIMAL FOR B. IMPATIENS COMPARED TO NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, AND THAT THIS EFFECT DIFFERS ACROSS YEARS, POTENTIALLY DUE TO CLIMACTIC DIFFERENCES. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR REDUCED PERFORMANCE OF BUMBLE BEE COLONIES IN SUBURBAN LANDSCAPES, ESPECIALLY REGARDING FLORAL RESOURCES AND PESTICIDE AND PATHOGEN STRESS.

THE BREEDING SYSTEM EXPERIMENTS REVEALED THAT BRAZILIAN POPULATIONS OF I. UTRICULARIOIDES ARE COMPLETELY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND PRODUCES LESS FRUITS THAN THOSE FROM PUERTO RICO UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS. THE FLOWERS OF I.

THE POLLINARIUM IS ATTACHED ON THE DORSAL PORTION OF THE PROBOSCIS, WHILE THE POLLINATORS PUT THEIR HEAD INSIDE THE FLOWERS SEARCHING FOR NECTAR.

WE INVESTIGATED CHEMICAL CHANGES DURING STORAGE IN LEG POCKETS. WE INJECTED A MIXTURE OF EIGHT PERFUME COMPOUNDS INTO POCKETS OF EUGLOSSA IMPERIALIS AND ONLY THE TWO MOST VOLATILE COMPOUNDS DECREASED OVER 12 DAYS. USING A DIFFERENT APPROACH WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT SHIFTS IN QUANTITIES OF NATURALLY OCCURRING PERFUME COMPOUNDS OF EUGLOSSA CHAMPIONI OVER 10DAYS, WITH THE STRONGEST DECREASES (UP TO 70\% PEAK AREA) IN HIGHLY VOLATILE MINOR COMPOUNDS, E.G. MONOTERPENES, AND NOTEWORTHY INCREASES (UP TO 40\%) IN SOME SESQUITERPENOIDS. CORRESPONDING SHIFTS WERE OBSERVED IN LEGS OF DRIED BEES, SUGGESTING THAT NO METABOLIC ACTIVITY IS REQUIRED FOR THE OBSERVED CHANGES TO OCCUR. OUR RESULTS CONFIRM THAT MALE ORCHID BEES ARE GENERALLY GOOD AT PRESERVING COLLECTED PERFUMES.

ALTHOUGH EVOLUTIONARY THEORY PREDICTS CLOSE SIZE MATCHING BETWEEN FLORAL NECTAR TUBE DEPTH AND POLLINATOR PROBOSCIS LENGTH OF INTERACTING SPECIES, SUCH SIZE MATCHING HAS SELDOM BEEN SHOWN AND EXPLAINED IN MULTISPECIES ASSEMBLAGES. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE DEGREE OF SIZE MATCHING AMONG ASTERACEAE AND THEIR POLLINATORS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH FORAGING EFFICIENCY. THE MAJORITY OF POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY HYMENOPTERA, CHOOSE PLANT SPECIES ON WHICH THEY HAD HIGH FORAGING EFFICIENCIES. WHEN PROBOSCIDES WERE SHORTER THAN NECTAR TUBES, FORAGING EFFICIENCY RAPIDLY DECREASED BECAUSE OF INCREASED HANDLING TIME. WHEN PROBOSCIDES WERE LONGER THAN NECTAR TUBES, A DECREASED NECTAR REWARD RATHER THAN AN INCREASED HANDLING TIME MADE SHALLOW FLOWERS MORE INEFFICIENT TO VISIT.

ENTOMOL. SOC. AM.,"THE EFFECTS OF PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS ON THE FUNCTION AND STABILITY OF ECOSYSTEMS HAVE BEEN AN AREA OF FOCUS IN RECENT DECADES. ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN AGROECOSYSTEMS AND CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, INCLUDING BIOCONTROL AND POLLINATION. IN PARTICULAR, SPECIES COMPOSITION AND BIOCONTROL FUNCTION CAN BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. HERE, WE DESIGNED 50 PLOTS WITH FIVE LEVELS OF PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS TO EXAMINE ARTHROPOD DISTRIBUTION AND COMPOSITION OVER 4 YR. ARTHROPOD RICHNESS WAS FOUND TO BE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS. HIGH PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS CAN ENHANCE THE TEMPORAL STABILITY OF THE ARTHROPOD COMMUNITY BUT CAN ALSO LEAD TO A DECLINE IN THE POPULATION STABILITY OF SOME SPECIES. THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND BIOMASS OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY INSECTS (EFI), SUCH AS HONEYBEES, ANTS AND FLIES, WERE FOUND TO BE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THOSE OF THE NATURAL ENEMIES. AS SUCH, HIGH LEVELS OF EFI COULD SUSTAIN FOOD WEB ROBUSTNESS BY SERVING AS ALTERNATIVE PREY/HOSTS FOR NATURAL ENEMIES. THE MEDIATION OF EFI IN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN CROPS AND PESTS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL BIOCONTROL PRACTICES USING NATURAL ENEMIES.
