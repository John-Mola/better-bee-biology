WE EXAMINE PLANT-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS AS ONE EXAMPLE OF A VITAL INTERACTION THAT MAY BE AFFECTED BY FRAGMENTATION. ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY DECLINE WITH FRAGMENTATION. FOR SOME PLANTS, THIS DECLINE CAUSES REDUCED POLLINATION AND SEED SET. FOR BOTH POLLINATORS AND PLANTS, SPECIALIZATION FOR MUTUALISTIC PARTNERS APPEARS TO BE A KEY CHARACTERISTIC THAT INCREASES THEIR RISK OF LOCAL EXTINCTION IN FRAGMENTS. FOR MORE GENERALIZED SPECIES, SUBSTITUTABILITY OF AVAILABLE PARTNERS WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUCCESS. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR EVALUATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS IN CAUSING SPECIES LOSS IN FRAGMENTS.

SARG., THREE NATURAL POPULATIONS IN GUIZHOU, HUNAN AND ZHEJIANG PROVINCES OF CHINA WERE RESPECTIVELY CHOSEN FOR THE FIELD WORK THROUGHOUT THE FLORESCENCE. THE ROLE OF WIND-POLLINATION IN THIS SPECIES COULD BE IGNORED AS THE POLLEN QUANTITY DECREASED RAPIDLY WITH THE INCREASING DISTANCE. IN SPITE OF MORPHOLOGICAL PROTOGYNY, POLLEN VIABILITY AND THE LIFE-SPAN OF RECEPTIVE STIGMAS OVERLAPED MORE THAN 24 H. ANATOMICALLY, ANTHER SAC HAS FOUR LOCULES WITH UNEQUALLY THICKENED ENDOTHECIUM WHICH MAY AFFECT ANTHER TO DEHISCE. THERE WERE MANY SECRETORY CELLS (AND GROUPS OF FLUORESCENT CELLS) AT THE BASE OF PETALS AND STYLES, BUT PAS REACTION INDICATED THAT POLYHEXOSE WAS MOSTLY CONCENTRATED IN THE CELLS AROUND THE VASCULAR BUNDLE OF PETALS. FLUORESCENT CELLS AND FLOWER FRAGRANCE WERE REGARDED AS ATTRACTANTS, NECTAR AND POLLEN AS REWARDS TO VISITORS. THE FLORAL SYNDROME SEEMS TO BE ADAPTIVE TO INSECT POLLINATION. DURING 1994 TO 1996, A TOTAL NUMBER OF THIRTY-NINE SPECIES OF INSECTS INCLUDING BEES, FLIES AND BEETLES WERE RECOGNIZED AS THE FLOWER VISITORS. AMONG WHICH ONLY FOUR WERE PRESENT IN ALL THE THREE POPULATIONS. THE VISITING FREQUENCY VARIED DISTINCTLY FROM SPECIES TO SPECIES AND AMONG POPULATIONS. WHILE BEES WERE OBSERVED AS THE MOST FREQUENT VISITORS IN THE POPULATION IN GUIZHOU PROVINCE, THEY WERE SUBSTITUTED BY FLIES IN THE OTHER TWO POPULATIONS IN HUNAN AND ZHEJIANG PROVINCE AND BECAME OCCASIONAL VISITORS THEMSELVES. THE BEETLES, DESPITE OF THEIR FREQUENT ACTIVITY IN FLOWERS, PLAYED A MUCH LESS IMPORTANT ROLE IN CROSS-POLLINATION. COMPARING THE MEAN POLLEN NUMBERS DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS PER VISIT, IT WAS FOUND THAT BEES WERE MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THAN FLIES IN POLLINATION. SEM EXAMINATION OF INSECT BODY ALSO SUPPORTED THIS POINT.

IN A FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE FLOWERS ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR AND THE AMOUNT OF GEITONOGAMOUS POLLINATION. WHEN THE SAME NUMBERS OF FEMALE AND MALE FLOWERS WERE PRESENTED IN AN ARTIFICIAL FLORAL ARRAY, SOLITARY BEES TENDED TO VISIT FEMALE FLOWERS FIRST AND THEN VISIT MALE FLOWERS IN A FORAGING SEQUENCE. HOWEVER, WHEN SEPALS OF MALE FLOWERS WERE GLUED TO FEMALE FLOWERS FROM WHICH THE ORIGINAL SEPALS HAD BEEN REMOVED TO PRODUCE FLORAL MONOMORPHISM, SOLITARY BEES FREQUENTLY MOVED FROM MALE TO FEMALE FLOWERS. CONSEQUENTLY, THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS PER ARRAY VISIT WAS INCREASED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT FLORAL MONOMORPHISM INCREASES GEITONOGAMOUS POLLINATION, AND FLOWER-SIZE DIMORPHISM IN A.

RES.,"DICHOGAMY, THE TEMPORAL SEPARATION OF MALE AND FEMALE FUNCTION, IS WIDESPREAD AMONG ANGIOSPERMS, YET ITS CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. TWO FORMS OF DICHOGAMY EXIST: PROTANDRY, IN WHICH POLLEN DISPERSAL PRECEDES STIGMA RECEPTIVITY, AND PROTOGYNY, IN WHICH THE REVERSE OCCURS. SPECIES-LEVEL COMPARATIVE STUDIES SHOW THAT PROTANDROUS SPECIES TEND TO BE POLLINATED BY BEES OR FLIES, WHEREAS PROTOGYNOUS SPECIES TEND TO BE WIND-OR BEETLE-POLLINATED. THIS SUGGESTS A FUNCTIONAL ROLE FOR POLLINATORS IN THE EVOLUTION OF DICHOGAMY. WE MAPPED DICHOGAMY AND POLLINATION CHARACTERS ONTO A PHYLOGENY OF ANGIOSPERM SPECIES. USING THE PROGRAM DISCRETE, TWO MODELS OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE (ONE ALLOWING ONLY FOR INDEPENDENT EVOLUTION AND THE OTHER ALLOWING CORRELATED EVOLUTION OF THE TWO TRAITS) WERE FIT TO THE PHYLOGENY TO TEST FOR CORRELATIONS. LOG-LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS AND MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS SUPPORT A CORRELATED MODEL FOR THE EVOLUTION OF THE TYPE OF DICHOGAMY AND THE FORM OF POLLINATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CORRELATIONS ARE ROBUST TO PHYLOGENETIC CORRECTION. HOWEVER, POLLINATION MODE WAS NOT FOUND TO AFFECT TRANSITIONS BETWEEN PROTANDRY AND PROTOGYNY. RATHER, AN EXAMINATION OF TRANSITION RATES REVEALED THAT THE RATE OF TRANSITIONS BETWEEN BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC POLLINATION DEPENDS ON WHETHER A SPECIES IS PROTANDROUS OR PROTOGYNOUS. ADDITIONALLY, WE FOUND MORE SUPPORT FOR A ROLE OF POLLINATION IN THE EVOLUTION OF PROTOGYNY FROM NON-PROTOGYNY THAN IN THE EVOLUTION OF PROTANDRY FROM NON-PROTANDRY.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS CHINA IS ONE OF THE CENTRES OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF IMPATIENS L. STUDIES OF THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF THIS GENUS IN CHINA HAVE, UNTIL NOW, BEEN UNREPORTED. IMPATIENS REPTANS, A SPECIES ENDEMIC TO CHINA, WAS STUDIED. THE AIMS WERE TO EXAMINE THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY AND POLLINATION SYSTEM OF THIS SPECIES, TO COMPARE ITS POLLINATION ECOLOGY WITH OTHER IMPATIENS SPECIES GROWING IN SUMATRA AND JAPAN, AND TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE REASONS FOR ITS LIMITED DISTRIBUTION. METHODS THE POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF I. REPTANS WAS STUDIED BY CARRYING OUT CONTINUOUS OBSERVATIONS WITHIN THREE NATURALLY GROWING POPULATIONS. ITS POLLINATION SYSTEM WAS STUDIED USING DIFFERENT POLLINATION METHODS, MARKING AND COUNTING POLLEN GRAINS, ASSESSING POLLEN VIABILITY AND OBSERVING POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR. KEY RESULTS THE FLOWERING PHASE OF THE PROTANDROUS I. REPTANS LASTED FOR 89 D. THE LIFE SPAN OF AN INDIVIDUAL FLOWER WAS 3.6 D. PRIMARY POLLINATORS WERE HONEY-BEES AND BUMBLE-BEES. SECONDARY POLLINATORS WERE DIURNAL HAWK MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES. BOMBUS BRIVICEPS AND BOMBUS SP. WERE NECTAR GATHERERS. THE MEAN NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION WAS 29.5\%, AND THE MEAN VALUE OF SUCROSE/GLUCOSE + FRUCTOSE WAS 0.82. THE PROPORTION OF SEED SET RANGED FROM 0.857 TO 0.873. DISTANCES THAT SEEDS WERE EJECTED RANGED FROM 0.58 TO 1.17 M. PERCENTAGE SEED GERMINATION UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS WAS 23.1. POLLEN VIABILITY WAS HIGHEST ON THE DAY OF ANTHESIS AND THEREAFTER DECREASED. RATIOS OF POLLEN : OVULES RANGED FROM 958.8 TO 970.6. CONCLUSIONS IMPATIENS REPTANS REPRODUCES BY MEANS OF CROSS-POLLINATION. ITS DEPENDENCE ON A SPECIALIZED HABITAT, A NARROW ENVIRONMENTAL NICHE, A LOW PERCENTAGE OF SEED GERMINATION, AND HABITAT LOSS COULD BE REASONS FOR ITS LIMITED DISTRIBUTION AND ENDEMISM.

HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED SO FAR ONLY FOR TRIGONIDIUM OBTUSUM. THIS STUDY REPORTS AND ILLUSTRATES POLLINATION THROUGH SEXUAL MIMICRY IN MORMOLYCA RINGENS. METHODS A TOTAL OF 70 H WERE DEDICATED TO THE OBSERVATION OF FLOWERS AND POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, WHICH WAS PHOTOGRAPHICALLY RECORDED. FLOWER FEATURES INVOLVED IN POLLINATOR ATTRACTION WERE STUDIED USING A STEREO-MICROSCOPE AND BY SEM ANALYSES. PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS ON THE PLANT BREEDING SYSTEM WERE MADE BY MANUALLY SELF-POLLINATING FLOWERS. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE FRAGRANCE VOLATILES WAS DETERMINED BY GC/MS ANALYSIS. KEY RESULTS THE FLOWER FEATURES OF M. RINGENS PARALLEL THOSE OF OTHER PSUEDOCOPULATORY FLOWERS. THE LABELLUM SHAPE AND INDUMENT ARE REMINISCENT OF ALL INSECT. SEXUALLY EXCITED DRONES OF NANNOTRIGONA TESTACEICORNIS AND SCAPTOTRIGONA SP. (BOTH IN THE APIDAE: MELIPONINI) ATTEMPT COPULATION WITH THE LABELLUM AND POLLINATE THE FLOWER IN THE PROCESS. IN BOTH BEE SPECIES, THE POLLINARIUM IS ATTACHED TO THE SCUTELLUM. POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR MAY PROMOTE SOME DEGREE OF SELF-POLLINATION, BUT PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT M.

CONSERV.,"MANY BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS) SPECIES ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE DECLINED IN ABUNDANCE IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, WHILE A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES REMAIN ABUNDANT. HERE WE EXAMINE WHICH FACTORS RENDER SOME BRITISH BUMBLEBEE SPECIES MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE THAN OTHERS. WE PRESENT FORAGE DATA ON WORKERS OF 15 BUMBLEBEE SPECIES GATHERED FROM 172 ONE HOUR SEARCHES CONDUCTED AT SITES IN SOUTHERN UK, THE HEBRICES (WESTERN SCOTLAND) AND IN NEW ZEALAND (TO WHICH UK BUMBLEBEES WERE INTRODUCED). WE ALSO REVIEW DATA ON DISTRIBUTION, PHENOLOGY AND TONGUE LENGTH OF THESE SPECIES. OVERALL, FABACEAE APPEAR TO BE THE MAJOR POLLEN SOURCE FOR MOST BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. IN PARTICULAR, LONG-TONGUED, LATE EMERGING SPECIES SUCH AS BOMBUS RUDERATUS, BOMBUS HUMILIS AND BOMBUS SUBTERRANEUS SPECIALIZE HEAVILY IN GATHERING POLLEN FROM FABACEAE, AND THIS GROUP OF BUMBLEBEE SPECIES HAVE ALL DECLINED. SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO AT THE EDGE OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE IN THE UK, WHICH MAY HAVE RENDERED THEM MORE SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THE DECLINE OF MANY BUMBLEBEE SPECIES IS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE LARGELY TO THE LOSS OF UNIMPROVED FLOWER-RICH GRASSLANDS, A HABITAT RICH IN FABACEAE. THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES THAT REMAIN ABUNDANT ARE MOSTLY SHORT-TONGUED SPECIES THAT EMERGE EARLY IN THE SEASON AND HAVE LESS SPECIALIZED DIETS: THESE SPECIES ARE VERY COMMON IN SUBURBAN GARDENS WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO EXPLOIT THE BROAD RANGE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. A THIRD GROUP OF BUMBLEBEES ARE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH ERICACEAE IN MOORLAND AND HEATHLAND HABITATS, AND HAVE PROBABLY ALWAYS HAD RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTIONS. A SMALL NUMBER OF SPECIES ARE NOT SO EASILY CATEGORISED. BOMBUS SOROEENSIS AND B. RUDERARIUS ARE NOT DIETARY SPECIALISTS, NOR ARE THEY CLOSE TO THE LIMIT OF THEIR GEOGRAPHIC RANGE, BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY HAVE DECLINED.

KNOWING THE CAUSES FOR THIS VARIATION IS CENTRAL TO THE CONSERVATION OF SINGLE SPECIES AS WELL AS WHOLE PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITIES. SPECIES SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS ON FLOWER VISITOR NUMBERS ARE SELDOM INVESTIGATED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. IN THIS STUDY WE TESTED WHETHER FLOWER SIZE PARAMETERS SET CONSTRAINTS ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE POTENTIAL NECTAR FEEDING VISITORS AND THUS DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES. WE STUDIED THREE POSSIBLE CONSTRAINTS: THE DEPTH AND WIDTH OF TUBULAR STRUCTURES HIDING THE NECTAR (NECTAR HOLDER DEPTH AND WIDTH) AND THE SIZE OF FLOWER PARTS THAT VISITORS CAN LAND ON (SIZE OF THE ALIGHTING PLACE). IN ADDITION WE ASSESS THE ROLE OF FLOWER ABUNDANCE ON THIS RELATIONSHIP. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE STRONGER SIZE CONSTRAINTS AND THE SMALLER FLOWER ABUNDANCE, THE SMALLER THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES WILL BE. OUR STUDY OF A MEDITERRANEAN PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITY REVEALED THAT NECTAR HOLDER DEPTH, NECTAR HOLDER WIDTH AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS EXPLAINED 71\% OF THE VARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES. THE SIZE OF THE ALIGHTING PLACE DID NOT RESTRICT THE BODY LENGTH OF THE VISITORS AND WAS NOT RELATED TO VISITOR SPECIES NUMBER. IN A SECOND STEP OF THE ANALYSES WE CALCULATED FOR EACH PLANT SPECIES THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF VISITORS BY DETERMINING FOR EACH INSECT SPECIES OF THE LOCAL VISITOR POOL WHETHER IT PASSED THE MORPHOLOGICAL LIMITS SET BY THE PLANT. THESE POTENTIAL NUMBERS WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE OBSERVED NUMBERS (R(2)=0.5, P < 0.001). FOR EACH PLANT SPECIES WE TESTED WHETHER THE OBSERVED VISITORS WERE A RANDOM SELECTION OUT OF THESE POTENTIAL VISITORS BY COMPARING THE MEAN OF THE OBSERVED AND EXPECTED PROBOSCIS LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS. FOR MOST PLANT SPECIES THE OBSERVED MEAN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE RANDOM MEANS. OUR FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON THE WAY PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR NETWORKS ARE STRUCTURED.

THREE FIRE-DRIVEN HABITATS WERE ASSESSED: FRESHLY BURNT AREAS, FULLY REGENERATED PINE FORESTS AND INTERMEDIATE AGE SCRUB, IN ADDITION WE EXAMINED OAK WOODLANDS, ACTIVELY MANAGED OLIVE GROVES AND GROVES THAT HAD BEEN ABANDONED FROM AGRICULTURE. OAK WOODLANDS, PINE FORESTS AND MANAGED OLIVE GROVES HAD THE HIGHEST DIVERSITY OF BEES. THE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS RESPONSIBLE FOR STRUCTURING BEE COMMUNITIES WERE: FLORAL DIVERSITY, FLORAL ABUNDANCE, NECTAR ENERGY AVAILABILITY AND THE VARIETY OF NECTAR RESOURCES PRESENT. POLLINATION SERVICES IN TWO OF OUR PLANT SPECIES, WHICH WERE POLLINATED BY A LIMITED SUB-SET OF THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY, INDICATED THAT POLLINATION LEVELS WERE HIGHEST IN THE BURNT AND MATURE PINE HABITATS. THE THIRD SPECIES, WHICH WAS OPEN TO ALL FLOWER VISITORS, INDICATED THAT OAK WOODLANDS HAD THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF POLLINATION FROM GENERALIST SPECIES. POLLINATION WAS ALWAYS MORE EFFECTIVE IN MANAGED OLIVE GROVES THAN IN ABANDONED GROVES. HOWEVER, THE TWO MOST COMMON SPECIES OF BEE, THE HONEYBEE AND A BUMBLEBEE, WERE NOT THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS WITHIN THESE HABITATS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE THREE HABITATS OF GREATEST OVERALL VALUE FOR PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND PROVISION OF THE HEALTHIEST POLLINATION SERVICES ARE PINE FORESTS, OAK WOODLAND AND MANAGED OLIVE GROVES.

THE DENSITIES OF AVAILABLE FLOWERS, THEIR POLLEN PRODUCTION, AND AVAILABILITY ALSO WERE MEASURED. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT, ALTHOUGH THE CULTIVARS GREATLY DIFFERED IN FLOWER DENSITY, FLOWER MORPHOLOGY, AND POLLEN PRODUCTION, THEIR POLLEN AVAILABILITY (I.E., POLLEN ACTUALLY COLLECTED BY BUMBLEBEES PER SQUARE METER) WAS APPROXIMATELY THE SAME.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION IS A MECHANISM THAT ALLOWS ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS TO OUTCROSS WHILE ENSURING SEED PRODUCTION IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE A NEW MECHANISM OF DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION FACILITATED BY WIND-DRIVEN COROLLA ABSCISSION IN INCARVILLEA SINENSIS VAR. SINENSIS. METHODS FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE PROCESS OF DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION WERE SURVEYED. EXPERIMENTS DEALING WITH POLLINATOR AND WIND EXCLUSION, POLLINATION MANIPULATIONS, AND POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE FIELD. KEY RESULTS DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION OCCURS WHEN THE ABSCISING COROLLA DRIVEN BY WIND DRAGS THE ADHERENT EPIPETALOUS STAMENS, THUS LEADING TO CONTACT OF ANTHERS WITH STIGMA IN LATE ANTHESIS. THERE IS NO DICHOGAMY AND SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN THIS SPECIES. THE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF ABSCISED COROLLA UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS AS COMPARED WITH THAT IN WIND-EXCLUDING TENTS INDICATES THE IMPORTANCE OF WIND IN COROLLA ABSCISSION. WHEN POLLINATORS WERE EXCLUDED, COROLLA ABSCISSION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED ON THE STIGMA AND, AS A RESULT, THE FRUIT AND SEED SET. ONLY HALF OF THE FLOWERS IN PLOTS WERE VISITED BY POLLINATORS, AND THE FRUIT SET OF EMASCULATED FLOWERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF UNTREATED FLOWERS IN OPEN POLLINATION. THIS SPECIES HAS A SENSITIVE STIGMA, AND ITS TWO OPEN STIGMATIC LOBES CLOSED SOON AFTER BEING TOUCHED BY A POLLINATOR, BUT ALWAYS REOPENED IF NO OR ONLY LITTLE POLLEN WAS DEPOSITED. CONCLUSIONS THIS DELAYED SELF-POLLINATION, WHICH INVOLVED THE MOVEMENT OF FLORAL PARTS, THE ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE WIND AND SENSITIVE STIGMA, IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT REPORTED PREVIOUSLY. THIS MECHANISM PROVIDES REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE FOR THIS SPECIES. THE SENSITIVE STIGMA CONTRIBUTES TO ENSURING SEED PRODUCTION AND REDUCING THE INTERFERENCE OF SELFING WITH OUTCROSSING.

WE STUDIED THE EFFECTS OF MANAGING MEADOWS ACCORDING TO THE PRESCRIPTIONS OF ECOLOGICAL COMPENSATION AREAS (ECA), THE MOST WIDELY ADOPTED AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME IN SWITZERLAND, ON BOTH POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE, AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PLANTS IN NEARBY INTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOWS (IM). 3. WE ESTABLISHED ARRAYS OF FOUR POTS, EACH CONTAINING INDIVIDUALS OF THREE INSECT-POLLINATED, NON-AUTOGAMOUS `PHYTOMETER' SPECIES (RAPHANUS SATIVUS, HYPOCHAERIS RADICATA AND CAMPANULA GLOMERATA), IN ECA AND ADJACENT IM AT INCREASING DISTANCES FROM THE ECA AT 13 SITES. 4. SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF HOVERFLIES, SOLITARY BEES AND LARGE-SIZED POLLINATORS (MAINLY SOCIAL BEES AND BUTTERFLIES) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN ECA THAN IN ADJACENT IM. SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF SMALL-SIZED POLLINATORS IN IM DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM ECA, WHEREAS LARGE-SIZED POLLINATORS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY DISTANCE. PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AND FLOWER ABUNDANCE WERE THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE, THE AREA OF AN ECA HAD NO SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE. 5. INDIVIDUAL PLANTS OF R.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS FLOWER SHAPES ARE IMPORTANT VISUAL CUES FOR POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF POLLINATORS TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN FLOWER SHAPES UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE DIVERSITY OF FLOWER SHAPE IN PRIMULA SIEBOLDII AND INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF BUMBLEBEES TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN FLOWERS BY COMBINING COMPUTER GRAPHICS WITH A TRADITIONAL BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENT. METHODS ELLIPTIC FOURIER DESCRIPTORS DESCRIBED SHAPES BY TRANSFORMING COORDINATE INFORMATION FOR THE CONTOURS INTO COEFFICIENTS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS SUMMARIZED THESE COEFFICIENTS. USING THESE METHODS, ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WERE CREATED BASED ON THE NATURAL DIVERSITY OF PETAL SHAPE IN P. SIEBOLDII. DUAL-CHOICE TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF THE BUMBLEBEES TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN THE ASPECT RATIO OF PETALS AND THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD NOTCH. KEY RESULTS THE INSECTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT ABILITY TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN THE ASPECT RATIO OF THE PETALS UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS UNLESS THE MORPHOLOGICAL DISTANCE INCREASED TO AN UNREALISTIC LEVEL. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE EXISTENCE OF A PERCEPTION THRESHOLD FOR DISTANCES IN THIS PARAMETER. THE BUMBLEBEES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE FOR NARROW PETALS EVEN AFTER TRAINING USING FLOWERS WITH WIDE PETALS. THE BUMBLEBEES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE DEPTH OF THE PETAL HEAD NOTCH AFTER TRAINING USING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITH A DEEP HEAD NOTCH. HOWEVER, THEY SHOWED NO DISCRIMINATION IN TESTS WITH TRAINING USING EXTREME DISTANCES BETWEEN FLOWERS IN THIS PARAMETER. CONCLUSIONS A NEW TYPE OF BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENT WAS DEMONSTRATED USING REAL VARIATION IN FLOWER COROLLA SHAPE IN P. SIEBOLDII. IF THE RANGE IN ASPECT RATIOS OF PETALS EXPANDS MUCH FURTHER, BUMBLEBEES MAY LEARN TO EXHIBIT SELECTIVE BEHAVIOUR.

LUO Z;ZHANG D;RENNER SS,LUO Z,WHY TWO KINDS OF STAMENS IN BUZZ-POLLINATED FLOWERS? EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT FOR DARWIN'S DIVISION-OF-LABOUR HYPOTHESIS,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"1. MOST ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERING PLANTS OFFER NECTAR AS A REWARD FOR THEIR POLLINATORS. SOME 20 000 SPECIES, HOWEVER, OFFER ONLY POLLEN AND RELY ON POLLEN-FORAGING BEES FOR POLLINATION. THIS CREATES A DILEMMA SINCE POLLEN GRAINS CONTAIN THE MALE GAMETES AND SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM BECOMING BEE FOOD. DARWIN WAS THE FIRST TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT A `DIVISION-OF-LABOUR' AMONG STAMENS COULD SOLVE THIS DILEMMA, WITH SOME STAMENS PROVIDING POLLEN AS FOOD, OTHERS PROVIDING POLLEN FOR FERTILIZATION. THIS HYPOTHESIS CAN ONLY BE TESTED IF POLLEN GRAINS FROM THE TWO SETS OF STAMENS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED AND THEIR FATES DETERMINED TO THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT ON THE STIGMA. 2. WE TESTED DARWIN'S HYPOTHESIS IN MELASTOMA MALABATHRICUM (MELASTOMATACEAE), A POLLEN-ONLY FLOWER WITH CONSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENTIATED STAMENS, AN INNER SET THAT IS SHORT AND YELLOW AND AN OUTER SET THAT IS MUCH LONGER AND PURPLE WITH SMALL YELLOW SPURS. POLLEN RELEASE IS THROUGH TERMINAL ANTHER PORES. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DIFFERENT EXINE PATTERNS ON THE POLLEN PRODUCED BY THE TWO SETS OF STAMENS, WE CARRIED OUT A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS TO COMPARE POLLINATOR FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND POLLEN PATHWAYS FROM ANTHERS TO STIGMAS. 3. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT IN SPITE OF ALL 10 STAMENS BEING BUZZED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE CARPENTER BEES THAT POLLINATE M. MALABATHRICUM, POLLEN FROM THE PURPLE `FERTILIZATION' STAMENS IS DRAMATICALLY MORE LIKELY TO LAND ON STIGMAS THAN POLLEN FROM THE YELLOW `FEEDING' STAMENS. REMOVAL EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE YELLOW `FEEDING' STAMENS ALSO ATTRACTED POLLINATORS FROM A DISTANCE. FLOWERS THAT HAD THEIR ANTHER PORES PLUGGED RECEIVED FEWER BUZZING BOUTS PER VISIT, INDICATING THAT BEES ASSESSED THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN RECEIVED PER BOUT. SURPRISINGLY, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN POLLEN LOADS ON STIGMAS OF FLOWERS THAT HAD THEIR ANTHERS PLUGGED AND STIGMAS OF CONTROLS, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICIENCY OF VECTOR-ASSISTED CROSS-POLLINATION AND THE LACK OF VECTOR-ASSISTED SELF-POLLINATION. 4. THE UNEXPECTEDLY PRECISE PLACEMENT OF POLLEN GRAINS EVEN WITH BUZZ POLLINATION, WITH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE GRAINS DEPOSITED OUT OF THE BEES' GROOMING REACH, HELPS EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTIONARY PERSISTENCE OF POLLEN AS A REWARD IN SPITE OF THE BEES' ABILITY TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN RECEIVED DURING FORAGING BOUTS.

WE EXAMINED THE STABLE OCCURRENCE OF INSECT POLLINATION AND WIND POLLINATION OVER 4 YEARS IN A POPULATION OF A BIENNIAL ACONITUM SPECIES (A. GYMNANDRUM) WITH ACTINOMORPHIC AND DEGENERATE SEPALS. THE TOTAL FREQUENCY OF VISITS OF TWO BUMBLEBEE SPECIES SHOWED NO DISTINCT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STUDIED POPULATION AMONG THE 4 YEARS.

RES.,"PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS PROVIDE IDEAL FRAMEWORKS FOR STUDYING INTERACTIONS IN PLANT COMMUNITIES. DESPITE THE LARGE POTENTIAL INFLUENCE OF SUCH INTERACTIONS ON PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE, BIODIVERSITY AND EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES, WE KNOW SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ABOUT THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG PLANT SPECIES FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. THEREFORE, WE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONSPECIFIC AND HETEROSPECIFIC FLORAL DENSITIES AND THE FLOWER VISITATION RATES OF NINE PLANT SPECIES MAINLY VISITED BY BUMBLE BEES, AND SIX PLANT SPECIES MAINLY VISITED BY FLIES, IN A TEMPERATE GRASSLAND, THROUGH STEPWISE MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS. SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WERE INTERPRETED AS INTERACTIONS FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT POSITIVE INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION WERE FAR MORE FREQUENT THAN NEGATIVE ONES. SEVENTEEN INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS WERE REVEALED OF WHICH 14 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE, WHEREAS THREE OF FOUR SIGNIFICANT INTRASPECIFIC INTERACTIONS WERE POSITIVE. SEVEN SPECIES EXPERIENCED ONLY POSITIVE INTERACTIONS AND TWO SPECIES EXPERIENCED ONLY NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS. THE RESULTS PRESENTED HERE INDICATE THAT NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE DOMINANT ECOLOGICAL INTERACTION FOR POLLINATION AMONG PLANTS WITHIN A COMMUNITY, AND THE STUDY REPRESENTS A STRAIGHTFORWARD APPROACH TO STUDY INTRA- AND INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIES WITHIN A COMMUNITY.

RANDS SA;WHITNEY HM,RANDS SA,EFFECTS OF POLLINATOR DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES ON FIELD MARGIN VISITATIONS IN THE MIDST OF AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES: A MODELLING APPROACH,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,ECOL. MODEL.,"MANAGED FIELD MARGINS OFFER A MEANS OF REDUCING THE IMPACT OF AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES WITHIN INTENSIVELY MANAGED ENVIRONMENTS. BY PROVIDING REFUGE FOR WILD PLANTS AND THE POLLINATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, FIELD MARGINS CAN ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO ENHANCING THE POLLINATION SERVICES WITHIN THE MONOCULTURE. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE MONOCULTURE ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR NEED TO BE CAREFULLY CONSIDERED. IT IS KNOWN THAT POLLINATORS MAY SHOW DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES SUCH AS NEOPHOBIA (AN AVOIDANCE OF UNFAMILIAR ITEMS) WHEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF FLOWER ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN THEIR ENVIRONMENT, AND THE DOMINANCE OF MONOCULTURE CROPS WITHIN THE ENVIRONMENT MAY CONSEQUENTLY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS UPON THE PREFERENCES SHOWN BY POLLINATORS LIVING IN THE FIELD MARGINS WITHIN THEM. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE HOW POLLINATOR PREFERENCES FOR WILD FLOWERS ARE AFFECTED BY MONOCULTURES, WE MODELLED THE EFFECTS OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT PREFERENCES, FLOWER DENSITIES, AND THE GEOMETRY OF FIELD MARGINS WITHIN A MONOCULTURE LANDSCAPE USING NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS. THIS WAS DONE BY CONSIDERING HOW THE PLACEMENT OF POLLINATOR NESTS WITHIN A SIMPLE, SPATIALLY EXPLICIT LANDSCAPE CONSISTING OF FIELDS OF MONOCULTURE CROPS SEPARATED BY MARGINS CONTAINING WILD FLOWERS AFFECTED THE RATIO OF WILD AND MONOCULTURE CROPS EXPERIENCED BY THE POLLINATOR, GIVEN THAT IT COULD ONLY FORAGE WITHIN A LIMITED DISTANCE FROM ITS NEST. INCREASING FIELD MARGIN WIDTH AND DECREASING MONOCULTURE FIELD WIDTH BOTH LED TO AN INCREASE IN POLLINATORS VISITING WILD FLOWERS (WHICH LEVELLED OFF AS WIDTH INCREASED). THE SIZE OF THE MONOCULTURE FIELDS HAD LITTLE ADDITIONAL EFFECT ONCE THEY HAD PASSED AN INTERMEDIATE WIDTH. INCREASING WILD FLOWER DENSITY WITHIN THE MARGINS LED TO A SHIFT AWAY FROM PREFERRING MONOCULTURES. WHEN WILD FLOWERS WERE AT LOW DENSITIES COMPARED TO THE MONOCULTURE, EVEN THE ADDITION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OF EXTRA WILD FLOWERS HAD A LARGE EFFECT IN SHIFTING FORAGING PREFERENCES AWAY FROM THE MONOCULTURE. THE DISTANCE WHICH POLLINATORS NORMALLY FORAGE OVER ONLY HAS AN EFFECT UPON PREFERENCES FOR WILD FLOWERS WHEN THE TRAVEL DISTANCE IS SMALL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF MARGIN DESIGN MIGHT BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE SPECIES WHICH DO NOT TRAVEL FAR. INNATE PREFERENCES FOR DENSITY-DEPENDENCE AND PARTICULAR CROP TYPES MAY ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON PREFERENCE BEHAVIOUR. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WAY IN WHICH RESOURCES ARE PRESENTED TO INDIGENOUS POLLINATORS MAY BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN INFLUENCING WHERE THEY CHOOSE TO FORAGE WITHIN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. CAREFUL MARGIN DESIGN, AS WELL AS INCREASING THE DENSITY OF WILD FLOWERS (SUCH AS BY ENHANCING THE WILD SEED BANK WITHIN THE MARGINS), MAY LEAD TO OVERALL IMPROVEMENTS IN ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION WITHIN INTENSIVELY FARMED MONOCULTURES.

LINNEAN SOC.,"FLOWERS OF THE GENUS ARUM ARE KNOWN TO ATTRACT DUNG-BREEDING FLIES AND BEETLES THROUGH OLFACTORY DECEIT. IN ADDITION TO THIS STRATEGY, THE GENUS HAS EVOLVED SEVERAL OTHER POLLINATION MECHANISMS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE THE POLLINATION STRATEGIES OF THE CRETAN ARUM SPECIES BY INVESTIGATING THE FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, THERMOGENY, INFLORESCENCE ODOURS, AND THE POLLINATING FAUNA. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT ARUM CYRENAICUM AND ARUM CONCINNATUM EMIT A STRONG DUNG SMELL AND EXHIBIT THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POLLINATION SYNDROME. BOTH SPECIES ARE HIGHLY THERMOGENIC, HAVE A SIMILAR ODOUR PROFILE AND ATTRACT SMALL-BODIED DIPTERA. ALTHOUGH SHARING THE SAME HABITAT, THESE TWO PLANT SPECIES ARE NEVER FOUND GROWING SYMPATRICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE EARLY BLOOMING PERIOD OF A. CYRENAICUM. BY CONTRAST, ARUM CRETICUM AND ARUM IDAEUM HAVE EVOLVED A MORE TRADITIONAL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL POLLINATION MECHANISM. THE STINKING SMELL HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A MORE FLOWER-LIKE ODOUR THAT ATTRACTS BEES (LASIOGLOSSUM SP.) AND, OCCASIONALLY, BUGS (DIONCONOTUS CRUENTATUS). ALTHOUGH ATTRACTING THE SAME POLLINATOR, THE MAIN COMPOUND PRESENT IN THE ODOUR OF A. CRETICUM IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A. IDAEUM. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA), BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE FLOWER ODOURS DETERMINED BY TESTING ON THE ANTENNA OF THE LASIOGLOSSUM BEE, REVEALED TWO DIFFERENT CLUSTERS, INDICATING THAT POLLINATORS CAN POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE ODOURS OF THE TWO SPECIES. A FURTHER PCA ON THE MAIN FLORAL ODOUR VOLATILES AS IDENTIFIED BY GAS CHROATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROSCOPY FROM ALL THE ARUM SPECIES UNDER INVESTIGATION DISPLAYED ODOUR-BASED SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIES. THE PCA-GAS CHOMOTOGRAPHY-ELECTROANTENNOGRAPHIC DETECTION ACTIVE PEAKS ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE TWO SPECIES, A. CRETICUM AND A. IDAEUM, FORM TWO GROUPS AND ARE CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM A. CYRENAICUM AND A. CONCINNATUM, WHICH, CONVERSELY, CLUSTER TOGETHER. THE EVOLUTIONARY FORCES AND SELECTIVE PRESSURES LEADING TO DIVERSIFICATION OF POLLINATION MECHANISMS IN THE CRETAN ARUM SPP.

RES.,"THE DECLINE OF BEES HAS RAISED CONCERNS REGARDING THEIR CONSERVATION AND THE MAINTENANCE OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THEY PROVIDE TO BEE-POLLINATED WILD FLOWERS AND CROPS. ALTHOUGH THE MEDITERRANEAN REGION IS A HOTSPOT FOR BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, THEIR STATUS REMAINS POORLY STUDIED. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR COST-EFFECTIVE, RELIABLE, AND UNBIASED SAMPLING METHODS THAT GIVE GOOD BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ESTIMATES. THIS STUDY AIMS: (A) TO ASSESS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS IN TWO COMMON MEDITERRANEAN HABITAT TYPES: SEMI-NATURAL SCRUB (PHRYGANA) AND MANAGED OLIVE GROVES, (B) TO COMPARE SPECIES RICHNESS IN THOSE SYSTEMS TO THAT OF OTHER BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, AND (C) TO ASSESS WHETHER SIX DIFFERENT SAMPLING METHODS (PAN TRAPS, VARIABLE AND STANDARDIZED TRANSECT WALKS, OBSERVATION PLOTS AND TRAP NESTS), PREVIOUSLY TESTED IN OTHER EUROPEAN BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ARE SUITABLE IN MEDITERRANEAN COMMUNITIES. EIGHT STUDY SITES, FOUR PER HABITAT TYPE, WERE SELECTED ON THE ISLAND OF LESVOS, GREECE. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OBSERVED WAS HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER HABITAT TYPES WORLDWIDE FOR WHICH COMPARABLE DATA EXIST. PAN TRAPS COLLECTED THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ACROSS ALL METHODS AT THE SCALE OF A STUDY SITE. VARIABLE AND STANDARDIZED TRANSECT WALKS DETECTED THE HIGHEST TOTAL RICHNESS OVER ALL EIGHT STUDY SITES. TRAP NESTS AND OBSERVATION PLOTS DETECTED ONLY A LIMITED FRACTION OF THE BEE SPECIES RICHNESS.

SYST.,"HABITAT MODIFICATION AND HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE ARE HAVING A SEVERE IMPACT ON ECOSYSTEMS. PLANT-INSECT INTERACTIONS IN PARTICULAR MIGHT BECOME DISRUPTED DUE TO SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESPONSES OF PLANTS AND INSECTS TOWARDS THESE CHANGES. WE INVESTIGATED HOW ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AFFECTS FLOWER VISITATION AND POLLINATION WITH A FIELD STUDY SIMULATING POLLINATOR HABITAT LOSS (DISTANCE TO SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT), PHENOLOGICAL SHIFT (ANTICIPATED FLOWERING) AND ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED GROWTH (ENHANCED FLOWER HEIGHT). WE ESTABLISHED 16 HABITAT ISLANDS OF POTTED PLANTS OF SINAPIS ARVENSIS L., RECORDED ALL FLOWER VISITORS (MAINLY BEES, FLIES AND POLLEN BEETLES) AND QUANTIFIED THE SEED SET. EXPERIMENTALLY ELEVATED FLOWERS WERE LESS OFTEN VISITED BY FLIES, WHILE VISITATION BY BEES WAS NOT AFFECTED. FURTHER, PLANTS DISTANT FROM CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND WERE LESS OFTEN VISITED BY BEES BUT VISITATION BY FLIES DID NOT DECREASE. ANTICIPATED FLOWERING REDUCED THE NUMBER OF BOTH POLLINATORS AND HERBIVOROUS POLLEN BEETLES AND INCREASED THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (SEEDS PER PLANT) OF S. ARVENSIS, SHOWING THAT THE LOSS OF MUTUALISTS WAS COMPENSATED BY AN ESCAPE FROM ANTAGONISTS. DURING THE NATURAL FLOWERING PERIOD MORE SEEDS WERE PRODUCED CLOSE TO GRASSLANDS, ESPECIALLY BY PLANTS OF NATURAL HEIGHT, PRESUMABLY DUE TO THE HIGHER BEE VISITATION RATE. HOWEVER, SEED PRODUCTION APPEARED TO BE RELATIVELY TOLERANT TO MULTIPLE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES DUE TO COMPLEMENTARY PATTERNS AMONG THE DIFFERENT FLOWER VISITOR GUILDS.

ECOL.,"1. SHIFTS IN THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF FLOWERING COULD AFFECT THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO POLLINATORS, AND SUCH SHIFTS MIGHT BECOME MORE COMMON AS CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRESSES. 2. AS MID-SUMMER TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED, WE FOUND THAT A MONTANE MEADOW ECOSYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF THE UNITED STATES EXHIBITS A TREND TOWARD A BIMODAL DISTRIBUTION OF FLOWER ABUNDANCE, CHARACTERIZED BY A MID-SEASON REDUCTION IN TOTAL FLOWER NUMBER, INSTEAD OF A BROAD, UNIMODAL FLOWERING PEAK LASTING MOST OF THE SUMMER SEASON. 3. WE EXAMINED THE SHAPES OF COMMUNITY-LEVEL FLOWERING CURVES IN THIS SYSTEM AND FOUND THAT THE TYPICAL UNIMODAL PEAK RESULTS FROM A PATTERN OF COMPLEMENTARY PEAKS IN FLOWERING AMONG THREE DISTINCT MEADOW TYPES (DRY, MESIC AND WET) WITHIN THE LARGER ECOSYSTEM. HOWEVER, HIGH MID-SUMMER TEMPERATURES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DIVERGENT SHIFTS IN THE FLOWERING CURVES OF THESE INDIVIDUAL MEADOW TYPES. SPECIFICALLY, WARMER SUMMERS APPEARED TO CAUSE INCREASING BIMODALITY IN MESIC HABITATS, AND A LONGER INTERVAL BETWEEN EARLY AND LATE FLOWERING PEAKS IN WET AND DRY HABITATS. 4. TOGETHER, THESE HABITAT-SPECIFIC SHIFTS PRODUCED A LONGER MID-SEASON VALLEY IN FLORAL ABUNDANCE ACROSS THE LARGER ECOSYSTEM IN WARMER YEARS. BECAUSE OF THESE WARMING-INDUCED CHANGES IN FLOWERING PATTERNS, AND THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SUMMER TEMPERATURES IN OUR STUDY AREA, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARD NON-NORMALITY OF FLOWERING CURVES OVER THE PERIOD 1974-2009. THIS TREND REFLECTS INCREASING BIMODALITY IN TOTAL COMMUNITY-WIDE FLOWERING. 5. THE RESULTING LONGER PERIODS OF LOW FLOWERING ABUNDANCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER SEASON COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT POLLINATORS THAT ARE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, AND SHIFTS IN FLOWERING PEAKS WITHIN HABITATS MIGHT CREATE MISMATCHES BETWEEN FLORAL RESOURCES AND DEMAND BY POLLINATORS WITH LIMITED FORAGING RANGES. 6. SYNTHESIS. EARLY-SEASON CLIMATE CONDITIONS ARE GETTING WARMER AND DRIER IN THE HIGH ALTITUDES OF THE SOUTHERN ROCKY MOUNTAINS. WE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THIS CLIMATE CHANGE IS DISRUPTING FLOWERING PHENOLOGY WITHIN AND AMONG DIFFERENT MOISTURE HABITATS IN A SUB-ALPINE MEADOW ECOSYSTEM, CAUSING A MID-SEASON DECLINE IN FLORAL RESOURCES THAT MIGHT NEGATIVELY AFFECT MUTUALISTS, ESPECIALLY POLLINATORS.

CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST 125(4): 297-306. THE APPARENT IMPORTANCE OF SUCCESSIONAL HABITAT TO POLLINATING INSECTS, SPECIFICALLY BEES (HYMENOPTERA) AND BUTTERFLIES (LEPIDOPTERA) WAS QUANTIFIED IN AN ALVAR LANDSCAPE IN THE OTTAWA VALLEY THROUGH A COMPARISON OF BURNED AND UNBURNED ALVAR WOODLAND. THE TWO ADJACENT HABITATS ON THE SAME SUCCESSIONAL GRADIENT WERE SAMPLED BY SWEEPING WITH ADDITIONAL DATA FROM PITFALL TRAPS FOR BEES AND BY DIRECT OBSERVATION WITH CLOSE FOCUS BINOCULARS AND OCCASIONAL VERIFICATION THROUGH CAPTURE WITH A NET FOR BUTTERFLIES. THE SAMPLING WAS DONE DURING 11 VISITS IN 2008 BEGINNING 16 MAY AND ENDING 13 SEPTEMBER. BOTH BEE AND BUTTERFLY DIVERSITY WERE HIGHER IN THE POST-FIRE BURNED ALVAR WOODLAND COMPARED TO THE ADJACENT UNBURNED WOODLAND BASED ON SPECIES RICHNESS, NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND BRILLOUIN'S BIODIVERSITY INDEX WHICH TAKES EVENNESS AND HETEROGENEITY INTO ACCOUNT. NO BEES WERE CAPTURED IN THE UNBURNED AREA, BUT 34 SPECIES AND 201 INDIVIDUALS WERE CAPTURED IN THE BURNED SITE. THE MOST ABUNDANT BEE SPECIES WAS AUGOCHLORA AURATA. LEPIDOPTERA WERE REPRESENTED IN THE BURNED SITE BY 35 SPECIES AND 408 INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO 15 SPECIES AND 21 INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNBURNED WOODLAND. THE MOST COMMON BUTTERFLY SPECIES IN THE BURNED WOODLAND WAS CALLOPHRYS POLIOS. THE HIGHER DIVERSITY OF POLLINATORS IN THE BURNED SITE WAS CORRELATED WITH BOTH HIGHER VASCULAR PLANT DIVERSITY AND MUCH HIGHER COVER AND FREQUENCY VALUES FOR INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS PROVIDING NECTAR AND POLLEN INCLUDING FLOWERING SHRUBS SUCH AS AMELANCHIER ALNIFOLIA VAR. COMPACTA, ARCTOSTAPHYLOS UVA-URSI AND PRUNUS VIRGINIANA. THE BURNED SITE ALSO PROVIDED MORE COVER OF LARVAL FOOD PLANTS FOR BUTTERFLIES AND APPARENTLY MORE NESTING SITES FOR BEES. WE SUGGEST THAT A DECREASE IN FIRE FREQUENCY AND IN THE AVAILABILITY OF OPEN SUCCESSIONAL HABITATS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS IN THE DECLINE OF POLLINATORS, AND THAT ENDANGERED ECOSYSTEMS WHERE FIRE HAS BEEN A NATURAL PHENOMENON MAY REQUIRE FIRE OR FIRE-SIMULATED MANAGEMENT TO SUSTAIN THEIR BIODIVERSITY.",POLLINATORS; BIODIVERSITY; LEPIDOPTERA; HYMENOPTERA; ALVAR; SUCCESSION; FIRE; ONTARIO; CANADA,FIRE; ABUNDANCE; BIODIVERSITY; RESPONSES; DECLINES; IMPACTS; ONTARIO; PLANTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"TAYLOR, AN (REPRINT AUTHOR), YORK UNIV, 4700 KEELE ST, TORONTO, ON M3P 1J3, CANADA.;TAYLOR, ALANA N., YORK UNIV, TORONTO, ON M3P 1J3, CANADA.;CATLING, PAUL M., AGR \& AGRI FOOD CANADA, ENVIRONM HLTH, BIODIVERS, CENT EXPT FARM, OTTAWA, ON K1A 0C6, CANADA.",NA,"PO BOX 35069, WESTGATE PO, OTTAWA, ONTARIO K1Z 1A2, CANADA",NA,NA,NA,0008-3550,4,297-306,OTTAWA FIELD-NATURALISTS CLUB,125,2011,ISI000308336200001,43,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",70,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY",ANTAYLORYORKU.CA CATLINGPAGR.GC.CA,999SV,"TAYLOR, AN (REPRINT AUTHOR), YORK UNIV, 4700 KEELE ST, TORONTO, ON M3P 1J3, CANADA",ISI,none,YORK UNIV;ENVIRONM HLTH,YORK UNIV,NA,"TAYLOR AN, 2011, CAN FIELD-NAT","TAYLOR AN, 2011, CAN FIELD-NAT",NA,NA,NA,NA

DISTRIB.,"AIM DISPERSAL DISTANCES OF INSECT POLLINATORS ARE CRITICAL IN DEFINING THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO LANDSCAPE-WIDE POLLEN MOVEMENT AND ULTIMATELY GENE FLOW IN NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS. WE ASK WHETHER BEE AND FLY POLLINATOR TAXA DIFFER IN THEIR DISPERSAL DISTANCES AND TRANSPORT OF VIABLE POLLEN IN A HUMAN-MODIFIED SYSTEM. LOCATION CANTERBURY AND OTAGO REGION, SOUTH ISLAND, NEW ZEALAND. METHODS WE CAPTURED POLLEN-CARRYING INSECTS TRAVELLING OUTSIDE OF A MODEL MASS-FLOWERING AGRICULTURAL CROP, BRASSICA RAPA, USING INSECT FLIGHT INTERCEPT TRAPS AT FIVE DISTANCES (0, 100, 200, 300 AND 400 M) FROM THE POLLEN SOURCE. WE EXAMINED POLLEN LOADS AND POLLEN VIABILITY TO DETERMINE WHETHER POLLEN TRANSPORT DISTANCE AND VIABILITY DIFFER AMONG POLLINATOR TAXA. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 5453 INSECTS WERE COLLECTED OF WHICH 717 INDIVIDUALS FROM 26 INSECT TAXA WERE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED AS DISPERSING POLLEN UP TO 400 M FROM THE SOURCE. THESE TAXA CONSISTED OF FOUR SPECIES FROM TWO BEE FAMILIES (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE AND HALICTIDAE), AND EIGHT SPECIES FROM FOUR FLY FAMILIES (DIPTERA: BIBIONDAE, STRATIOMYIDAE, SYRPHIDAE AND TACHINIDAE). APIDAE GENERALLY CARRIED HIGHER POLLEN LOADS AND MORE VIABLE POLLEN THAN MOST FLY TAXA. TAXA IN THE FLY FAMILIES STRATIOMYIDAE AND SYRPHIDAE, HOWEVER, CARRIED POLLEN TO 400 M, WHICH IS FURTHER THAN BOTH BEE FAMILIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS A DIVERSE ARRAY OF WILD AND MANAGED FLOWER VISITORS CAN TRANSPORT VIABLE POLLEN FROM A POLLEN SOURCE TO AT LEAST 400 M. KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIFFERENCES IN TRANSPORT DISTANCES AMONG GENERALIST POLLINATORS IN HUMAN-MODIFIED ENVIRONMENTS IS CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL EXTENT TO WHICH (1) POLLEN TRANSPORT CAN FACILITATE GENE FLOW AND (2) UNWANTED HYBRIDIZATION MAY OCCUR BETWEEN CROPS AND RELATED WEEDS.",DIPTERA; DISPERSAL; DISTANCE; GENE FLOW; HYMENOPTERA; MOBILITY; VIABILITY,RAPE BRASSICA-NAPUS; MEDIATED GENE FLOW; OILSEED RAPE; LONG-DISTANCE; FORAGING RANGE; FRUIT-SET; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; STIGMATIC RECEPTIVITY; POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE; HOVER FLIES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,44,"RADER, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), JAMES COOK UNIV, SCH MARINE \& TROP BIOL, POB 6811, CAIRNS, QLD 4870, AUSTRALIA.;RADER, ROMINA, EDWARDS, WILL, WESTCOTT, DAVID A., JAMES COOK UNIV, SCH MARINE \& TROP BIOL, CAIRNS, QLD 4870, AUSTRALIA.;RADER, ROMINA, HOWLETT, BRADLEY G., NEW ZEALAND INST PLANT \& FOOD RES LTD, CHRISTCHURCH, NEW ZEALAND.;WESTCOTT, DAVID A., CSIRO ECOSYST SCI, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;CUNNINGHAM, SAUL A., CSIRO ECOSYST SCI, CANBERRA, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA.",10.1111/J.1472-4642.2011.00757.X,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"NEW ZEALAND FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYNEW ZEALAND FOUNDATION FOR RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY [CO2X0221]; JAMES COOK UNIVERSITY CAIRNS","THE AUTHORS THANK: N.

J. ECOL.,"COMPETITION AND FACILITATION IN SPECIES INTERACTIONS ATTRACT MUCH ATTENTION IN ECOLOGY, BUT THEIR RELATIVE IMPORTANCE HAS SELDOM BEEN EVALUATED IN A COMMUNITY CONTEXT. WE ASSESSED COMPETITIVE AND FACILITATIVE INTERACTIONS FOR POLLINATOR VISITATION AMONG CO-FLOWERING SPECIES IN A PLANT COMMUNITY, INVESTIGATED THE SUBSEQUENT CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANT REPRODUCTION, AND INVESTIGATED WHETHER EFFECTS COULD BE TRAIT-BASED. WE REMOVED THE FLOWERS OF TWO SPECIES ATTRACTIVE TO POLLINATORS, IN TWO SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS AND ASSESSED THE EFFECTS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES AND COMPONENTS OF REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN 11 CO-FLOWERING FOCAL HERB SPECIES. OVERALL, MOST FOCAL SPECIES APPEAR NOT TO INTERACT WITH THE REMOVAL SPECIES WITH RESPECT TO POLLINATOR VISITATION AND SUBSEQUENT REPRODUCTION (NEUTRAL INTERACTIONS). THREE FOCAL SPECIES IN THE COMMUNITY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE RESPONSES (FRUIT PRODUCTION AND SEED WEIGHT) IN THE PRESENCE OF THE ATTRACTIVE REMOVAL SPECIES (FACILITATIVE INTERACTIONS), BUT SPECIES INTERACTION EFFECTS WERE LESS PRONOUNCED IN SPECIES' FLOWER VISITATION RATES. A COMMUNITY-WIDE META-ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO EXPERIMENTS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EITHER FACILITATION OR COMPETITION, AND THAT THERE WAS NO OVERALL CORRELATION BETWEEN EFFECT SIZES FOR VISITATION AND REPRODUCTION. BASED ON SPECIES-SPECIFIC RESPONSES, IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT FLORAL TRAITS SUCH AS SIMILAR FLOWER COLORS CONTRIBUTE TO INTERSPECIFIC FACILITATION OF POLLINATOR VISITATION AND, IN PARTICULAR, THAT HIGH POLLINATOR DEPENDENCE FOR PLANT REPRODUCTION, AND ASSOCIATED POLLEN LIMITATION, MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SUBSEQUENT INTERACTION EFFECTS ON REPRODUCTION IN THE FOCAL SPECIES.

IN THIS WORK, WE EXAMINE THE FLORAL MICROMORPHOLOGY OF FOUR SYMPATRIC SPECIES OF THE WIDESPREAD MEDITERRANEAN GENUS SERAPIAS.

VOMERACEA. EACH SPECIES HAS A CHARACTERISTIC COMBINATION OF SPECIALIZED, SECRETORY EPIDERMAL CELLS AND TRICHOMES ON THE LABELLUM AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE PETALS. SERAPIAS LINGUA IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED IN THAT IT PRODUCES OLFACTORY SIGNALS AND HAS TWO TYPES OF TRICHOME WITH SECRETORY APICAL CELLS, ONE OF WHICH IS ALSO PRESENT IN S. PARVIFLORA. IN ADDITION TO STRIATED, CONICAL SECRETORY CELLS, S. CORDIGERA AND S. VOMERACEA ALSO HAVE CHARACTERISTIC, ATYPICAL SECRETORY TRICHOMES WITH BILOBULATE OR DOME-LIKE PROTUBERANCES.

JPN. SOC. HORTIC. SCI.,"ALTHOUGH JAPANESE MANGO IS PRODUCED UNDER A FAIRLY UNIQUE CULTIVATION SYSTEM AND FETCHES HIGH PRICES AT MARKET, FURTHER GROWTH OF THE MANGO INDUSTRY IN JAPAN REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CULTIVARS. HOWEVER, SINCE INDIVIDUAL MANGO FLOWERS ARE QUITE SMALL, NO MORE THAN 1 CM IN DIAMETER, A LARGE NUMBER OF SKILLED WORKERS IS NECESSARY FOR ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION, THUS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PROGENIES FOR BREEDING. WE THEREFORE EVALUATED A METHODOLOGY WHEREBY PROGENIES WERE OBTAINED BY OPEN POLLINATION AND THEIR MALE PARENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED BY DNA MARKERS. TWO MANGO CULTIVARS ('IRWIN' AND `BENI-KEITT') WERE ARRANGED IN A PLASTIC HOUSE AND HONEYBEES WERE RELEASED AS A POLLEN VECTOR FOR OPEN POLLINATION. HARVESTED FRUITS WERE CHARACTERIZED AND THEIR SEEDS WERE SOWN IN A BED. THE MALE PARENT OF THE GERMINATED SEEDLINGS WAS THEN IDENTIFIED BY FIVE SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT (SSR) MARKERS. AS A RESULT OF SSR GENOTYPING, THE MALE PARENTS OF 185 OF 239 `IRWIN' SEEDLINGS WERE REVEALED, 79 WERE OBTAINED BY SELF-POLLINATION AND 106 FROM OUT-CROSSING. FOR `BENI-KEITT', THE MALE PARENT OF 14 OF THE 20 SEEDLINGS WAS DETERMINED WITH TWO SELF-POLLINATED AND 12 OUT-CROSSED. PREFERENTIAL OUT-CROSSING IN `IRWIN' WAS REVEALED USING THE CHI-SQUARE TEST, ALTHOUGH THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF SELF-POLLINATED FRUIT OBTAINED SHOWS THAT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FRUIT CAN BE SET IN A SINGLE-PLANTED ORCHARD. THE EFFECT OF THE MALE PARENT ON FRUIT CHARACTERISTICS WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXAMINED, REVEALING THAT IN `IRWIN' THE BRIX VALUE OF SELF-POLLINATED FRUITS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF CROSS-POLLINATED FRUITS.

SELECTION ON TRAITS RELATED TO THE MECHANICAL FIT WITH POLLINATORS IS EXPECTED TO VARY ACCORDING TO CHANGES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE. PROVIDED THAT POLLINATORS DO NOT CHANGE OVER TIME SELECTION ON TRAITS RELATED TO ATTRACTION, SUCH AS FLORAL FRAGRANCE, IS EXPECTED TO BE MAINLY AFFECTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BECAUSE ITS PRODUCTION IS RESOURCE LIMITED. WE EXAMINED SELECTION PATTERNS ON OSMOPHORE AREA (AS A SURROGATE OF ODOUR PRODUCTION), NECTARY DEPTH AND FLOWER NUMBER IN THE ORCHID CYCLOPOGON ELATUS DURING FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS, AND SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED VARIATIONS IN WEATHER CONDITIONS AND DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES. WE ALSO STUDIED WHETHER THE OSMOPHORE AREA WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND EXAMINED ITS POSSIBLE TRADE-OFF WITH PHENOLOGY. WE FOUND THAT PATTERNS OF SELECTION ON NECTARY DEPTH DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG YEARS. THIS LACK OF TEMPORAL VARIATION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STABILITY OF A SINGLE BEE SPECIES AS THE PREDOMINANT POLLINATOR. ON THE CONTRARY, SELECTION ON OSMOPHORE AREA VARIED MARKEDLY AND WAS NEGATIVE DURING THE DRIEST YEAR. NEGATIVE SELECTION INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH POLLINATORS VISITED PLANTS WITH LARGER OSMOPHORE AREAS MORE FREQUENTLY, IT DID NOT TRANSLATE INTO HIGHER FITNESS.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"MOST RESEARCH ON PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNICATION HAS FOCUSED ON SENSORY AND BEHAVIORAL RESPONSES TO RELATIVELY STATIC CUES. FLORAL REWARDS SUCH AS NECTAR, HOWEVER, ARE DYNAMIC, AND FORAGING ANIMALS WILL INCREASE THEIR ENERGETIC PROFIT IF THEY CAN MAKE USE OF FLORAL CUES THAT MORE ACCURATELY INDICATE NECTAR AVAILABILITY. HERE WE DOCUMENT SUCH A CUE-TRANSIENT HUMIDITY GRADIENTS-USING THE NIGHT BLOOMING FLOWERS OF OENOTHERA CESPITOSA (ONAGRACEAE). THE HEADSPACE OF NEWLY OPENED FLOWERS REACHES LEVELS OF ABOUT 4\% ABOVE AMBIENT RELATIVE HUMIDITY DUE TO ADDITIVE EVAPOTRANSPIRATIONAL WATER LOSS THROUGH PETALS AND WATER-SATURATED AIR FROM THE NECTAR TUBE. FLORAL HUMIDITY PLUMES DIFFER FROM AMBIENT LEVELS ONLY DURING THE FIRST 30 MIN AFTER ANTHESIS (BEFORE NECTAR IS DEPLETED IN WILD POPULATIONS), WHEREAS OTHER FLORAL TRAITS (SCENT, SHAPE, AND COLOR) PERSIST FOR 12-24 H. MANIPULATIVE EXPERIMENTS INDICATED THAT FLORAL HUMIDITY GRADIENTS ARE MECHANISTICALLY LINKED TO NECTAR VOLUME AND THEREFORE CONTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT ENERGY REWARDS TO FLORAL VISITORS. BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS WITH HYLES LINEATA (SPHINGIDAE) AND ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITH APPROPRIATE HUMIDITY GRADIENTS SUGGEST THAT THESE HAWKMOTH POLLINATORS DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN RELATIVE HUMIDITY WHEN OTHER FLORAL CUES ARE HELD CONSTANT. MOTHS CONSISTENTLY APPROACHED AND PROBED FLOWERS WITH ELEVATED HUMIDITY OVER THOSE WITH AMBIENT HUMIDITY LEVELS. BECAUSE FLORAL HUMIDITY GRADIENTS ARE LARGELY PRODUCED BY THE EVAPORATION OF NECTAR ITSELF, THEY REPRESENT CONDITION-INFORMATIVE CUES THAT FACILITATE REMOTE SENSING OF FLORAL PROFITABILITY BY DISCRIMINATING FORAGERS.

TO FILL THIS GAP, WE COMPARED THE PATTERNS OF POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THE INVASIVE HERB ECHIUM VULGARE (BORAGINACEAE) BETWEEN MONOSPECIFIC PATCHES (ONLY E. VULGARE) AND MIXED PATCHES (SYMPATRY WITH NATIVE HERBS SCHIZANTHUS HOOKERI AND STACHYS ALBICAULIS) IN CENTRAL CHILE. USING SAMPLE QUADRATS OF 1 M X 2 M, WE QUANTIFIED THE RICHNESS, DIVERSITY AND VISITATION RATE OF FLOWER VISITORS IN 15-MIN OBSERVATION INTERVALS. WE CONDUCTED AN ASSAY TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE PATCH TYPES (MONOSPECIFIC AND MIXED) AND THE ISOLATION OF FLOWERS TO VISITORS ON BOTH THE FRUIT SET AND SEED/OVULE RATIO. WE SHOWED THAT NATIVE PLANTS FAVOURED THE RICHNESS OF VISITORS OF E. VULGARE, HOWEVER, THEY DID NOT LEAD TO INCREASES IN VISITATION RATE. THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF E. VULGARE DID NOT SHOW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONTRASTED PATCHES, HOWEVER, THE ISOLATION OF VISITORS DECREASED THE FRUIT SET, ALTHOUGH SEED PRODUCTION WAS MAINTAINED IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS, PRESUMABLY BY AN AUTOGAMOUS MECHANISM. COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH FOCUS, WE ASSESSED CHANGES IN POLLINATION VARIABLES AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT IN TWO COFLOWERING NATIVE PLANTS THAT OCCUR WITH E. VULGARE, S. HOOKERI AND S. ALBICAULIS.

ALKALOID CONCENTRATIONS DIFFERED BETWEEN VEGETATIVE TISSUES, FLORAL TISSUES AND FLORAL REWARDS. ALKALOID CONCENTRATIONS IN FLORAL PARTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH OPTIMAL DEFENSE THEORY, WITH TISSUES MORE CLOSELY TIED TO PLANT FITNESS, SUCH AS FRUITS, BEING MORE HEAVILY DEFENDED THAN FOLIAGE. HOWEVER, ALKALOID CONCENTRATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN NECTAR COMPARED TO OTHER TISSUES. THE NORDITERPENE ALKALOIDS INFLUENCED THE ACTIVITY OF BUMBLE BEES, THE DOMINANT POLLINATOR OF LARKSPUR, BUT THE EFFECTS WERE CONCENTRATION DEPENDENT. ALKALOIDS IN NECTAR ARE FOUND AT CONCENTRATIONS THAT HAVE NO EFFECT ON BEE ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, IF ALKALOID CONCENTRATIONS IN NECTAR WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN FOLIAGE BEE ACTIVITY WOULD BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY.

THESE LIMITATIONS NEED TO BE OVERCOME IN ORDER TO INCORPORATE NEW POLLEN HOSTS, HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SUCH HOST EXPANSION ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED INTRA- AND INTERPOPULATIONAL VARIATION IN THE ABILITY OF LARVAE OF THE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES OSMIA CORNUTA (MEGACHILIDAE) TO DEVELOP ON A NON-HOST POLLEN DIET OF RANUNCULUS ACRIS (RANUNCULACEAE) BY COMPARING LARVAL PERFORMANCE WITHIN AND BETWEEN FIVE GEOGRAPHICALLY DISTANT EUROPEAN POPULATIONS.

BETWEEN 10\% AND 43.5\% OF ALL LARVAE PER POPULATION REACHED THE COCOON STAGE, AND 48\% OF THESE EMERGED AS VIABLE ADULTS FROM THE COCOONS, INDICATING THAT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE UNFAVOURABLE PROPERTIES OF RANUNCULUS POLLEN EXISTS IN EACH POPULATION. THE BEE LARVAE OF ONE POPULATION EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SURVIVAL ON THE RANUNCULUS POLLEN DIET COMPARED WITH THREE OF THE FOUR OTHER POPULATIONS.

WE STUDIED THE INFLUENCE OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON POPULATION STRUCTURE IN THE SOLITARY BEE ANDRENA VAGA, AN EARLY SPRING SPECIES THAT NESTS EXCLUSIVELY IN SANDY SOIL AND FEEDS STRICTLY ON WILLOWS (SALIX SPP.). BECAUSE THE HOMOGENOUS HABITAT OF THE GERMAN FLOODPLAINS, WHERE THE SPECIES WAS STUDIED PREVIOUSLY, RESULTED IN THE SPECIES' WEAK POPULATION STRUCTURE, WE EXPECTED MORE STRUCTURED POPULATIONS IN CENTRAL EUROPE, WHERE THE SANDY SOILS ESSENTIAL FOR NESTING ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED. WE ANALYSED 387 FEMALES FROM 21 LOCALITIES IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND SLOVAKIA USING NINE MICROSATELLITE LOCI, AND WE INFERRED POPULATION STRUCTURE USING LANDSCAPE GENETICS AND BAYESIAN CLUSTERING METHODS. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DID NOT RESULT IN INCREASED GENETIC ISOLATION AT THE LOCALITIES, HOWEVER, TWO DIFFERENTIATED GROUPS OF LOCALITIES, SEPARATED BY A WIDE CLINAL ZONE OF ADMIXTURE, WERE DETECTED WITHIN THE STUDY AREA. THE OBSERVED PATTERN SUGGESTS THAT DISPERSIVE ABILITY OF A. VAGA COMPENSATES THE SPECIES DEPENDENCE ON UNSTABLE FRAGMENTED HABITATS. WE PROPOSE THAT THE POPULATION STRUCTURE MAY MIRROR A SECONDARY CONTACT FORMED BY THE EXPANSION OF TWO POPULATIONS THAT HAD BEEN SEPARATED IN THE PAST.

WE ESTIMATED THAT A MONITORING PROGRAM WITH 200250 SAMPLING LOCATIONS EACH SAMPLED TWICE OVER 5 YEARS WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT POWER TO DETECT SMALL (25\%) ANNUAL DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIES AND IN TOTAL ABUNDANCE AND WOULD COST U.S.\$2,000,000. TO DETECT DECLINES AS SMALL AS 1\% ANNUALLY OVER THE SAME PERIOD WOULD REQUIRE >300 SAMPLING LOCATIONS.

ISHII HS;MASUDA H,ISHII HS,EFFECT OF FLOWER VISUAL ANGLE ON FLOWER CONSTANCY: A TEST OF THE SEARCH IMAGE HYPOTHESIS,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,BEHAV. ECOL.,"POLLINATORS OFTEN SEQUENTIALLY VISIT 1 FLOWER TYPE WHILE BYPASSING OTHER EQUALLY REWARDING FLOWER TYPES, BEHAVIOR KNOWN AS FLOWER CONSTANCY. ONE EXPLANATION FOR FLOWER CONSTANCY IS THAT POLLINATORS USE THE SEARCH IMAGE OF A SPECIFIC FLOWER TYPE TO EFFICIENTLY FIND FLOWERS BECAUSE THEY ARE OFTEN CRYPTIC. THE SO-CALLED SEARCH IMAGE HYPOTHESIS PREDICTS THAT TEMPORAL SPECIALIZATION TO 1 FLOWER TYPE BY AN INDIVIDUAL POLLINATOR DECLINES AS FLOWER CONSPICUOUSNESS INCREASES BECAUSE IF FLOWERS ARE CONSPICUOUS, POLLINATORS CAN DIVIDE THEIR ATTENTION AMONG DIFFERENT FLOWER TYPES. TO TEST THIS PREDICTION, WE INVESTIGATED VISITATION SEQUENCES OF INDIVIDUAL BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS IGNITUS) TO A PATCH OF BLUE AND YELLOW ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS. WE USED DIFFERENT FLOWER SIZES AND INTERFLOWER DISTANCES AS INDEPENDENT DETERMINANTS OF FLOWER VISUAL SIZE AND NOISINESS OF THE BACKGROUND AND, THUS, OF FLOWER CRYPSIS. FLOWER COLOR SELECTIVITY AND FLOWER SEARCH TIME DECREASED AND SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED WITH VISUAL SIZE OF THE NEAREST FLOWERS, WITH A MINIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY 15 DEGREES OF THE VISUAL ANGLE. WITHIN-BOUT CONSTANCY, MEASURED AS THE TENDENCY OF FLYING TO THE SAME FLOWER TYPES IN SUCCESSION COMPARED WITH THE EXPECTATION OF A GIVEN FLOWER SELECTIVITY WITHIN A BOUT, INCREASED WITH VISUAL SIZE OF THE NEAREST FLOWERS. FLOWER SELECTIVITY AND WITHIN-BOUT CONSTANCY DID NOT DIFFER AMONG ARRAYS THAT SHARED THE SAME FLORAL VISUAL ANGLE, INDICATING THAT VISUAL SIZE, RATHER THAN FLIGHT DISTANCE OR FLOWER SIZE ITSELF, HAD A SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT ON FLOWER CHOICES.

IN THE CASE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS, DESPITE THE GREAT PROGRESS IN DESCRIBING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND THEIR POLLINATORS, THE CAPABILITY OF MAKING QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS IS STILL LACKING. HERE, IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE POLLINATOR SPECIES ABUNDANCES AND THEIR NICHE DISTRIBUTION, I PROPOSE A GENERAL METHOD TO TRANSFORM A PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK INTO A COMPETITION MODEL BETWEEN POLLINATOR SPECIES. COMPETITION MATRICES WERE OBTAINED FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES' CALCULATIONS, USING QUALITATIVE INTERACTION MATRICES COMPILED FOR A SET OF 38 PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS. THIS METHOD IS ABLE TO MAKE ACCURATE QUANTITATIVE PREDICTIONS FOR MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS SPANNING A BROAD GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PREDICTED BIODIVERSITY METRICS FOR POLLINATORS - SPECIES RELATIVE ABUNDANCES, SHANNON EQUITABILITY AND GINI-SIMPSON INDICES - AGREE QUITE WELL WITH THOSE INFERRED FROM EMPIRICAL COUNTS OF VISITS OF POLLINATORS TO PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, THIS METHOD ALLOWS BUILDING A ONE-DIMENSIONAL NICHE AXIS FOR POLLINATORS IN WHICH CLUSTERS OF GENERALISTS ARE SEPARATED BY SPECIALISTS THUS RENDERING SUPPORT TO THE THEORY OF EMERGENT NEUTRALITY. THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION BETWEEN POLLINATOR SPECIES IS A CONTROVERSIAL AND UNRESOLVED ISSUE, CONSIDERABLE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE HAS ACCRUED THAT COMPETITION BETWEEN INSECTS DOES OCCUR, BUT A CLEAR MEASURE OF ITS IMPACT ON THEIR SPECIES ABUNDANCES IS STILL LACKING. I CONTRIBUTED TO FILL THIS GAP BY QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION BETWEEN POLLINATORS.

THIS HAS TRIGGERED CALLS FOR FURTHER STUDY OF THESE MUTUALISTIC COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY INFORM RESTORATION OF DISTURBED PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. HERE, WE USE A DYNAMIC NETWORK MODEL TO TEST A VARIETY OF TRANSLOCATION STRATEGIES FOR RESTORING A COMMUNITY AFTER IT EXPERIENCES THE LOSS OF SOME OF ITS SPECIES. WE CONSIDER THE REINTRODUCTION OF EXTIRPATED SPECIES, BOTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ORIGINAL LOSS AND AFTER THE COMMUNITY HAS REEQUILIBRATED, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF OTHER NATIVE SPECIES THAT WERE ORIGINALLY ABSENT FROM THE COMMUNITY. WE FIND THAT REINTRODUCING MULTIPLE HIGHLY INTERACTING GENERALIST SPECIES BEST RESTORES SPECIES RICHNESS FOR LIGHTLY DISTURBED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, FOR COMMUNITIES THAT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES IN BIODIVERSITY, INTRODUCING GENERALIST SPECIES THAT ARE NOT ORIGINALLY PRESENT IN THE COMMUNITY MAY MOST EFFECTIVELY RESTORE SPECIES RICHNESS, ALTHOUGH IN THESE CASES THE RESULTANT COMMUNITY OFTEN SHARES FEW SPECIES WITH THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TRANSLOCATION OF A SINGLE SPECIES HAS A MINIMAL IMPACT ON BOTH SPECIES RICHNESS AND THE FREQUENCY OF COMMUNITY COLLAPSE.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY STRUCTURING AT LOCAL SCALES IN NATURALLY HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS. WE SYSTEMATICALLY SAMPLED STINGLESS BEE COMMUNITIES FOUND ACROSS THREE PAIRED SITES THAT INCLUDED ADJACENT PATCHES OF WHITE-SAND AND NON-WHITE-SAND FOREST IN THE LOWLAND AMAZONIAN REGION OF LORETO, PERU. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND: (1) HOW STINGLESS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DIFFER AMONG WHITE-SAND AND NON-WHITE-SAND HABITATS AND (2) THE RELATIVE INFLUENCE OF FINE SCALE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE AND HABITAT TYPE IN STRUCTURING STINGLESS BEE COMMUNITIES. WE FOUND THAT SPECIES RICHNESS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN HABITATS AND THAT SPECIES ABUNDANCES WERE HIGHEST IN WHITE-SAND HABITATS. COMMUNITY ANALYSES FOR SAMPLING SITES POOLED ACROSS ALL MONTHS DEMONSTRATED THAT LOCATION AND SOIL TYPE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN STRUCTURING BEE COMMUNITIES AND THAT COMMUNITY TURNOVER MAY BE MORE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY DISTANCE IN WHITE-SAND HABITATS THAN NON-WHITE SAND HABITATS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DISTANCE AND HABITAT PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DRIVING STINGLESS BEE COMMUNITY TURNOVER AT FINE SCALES AND THAT THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HABITAT AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE MAY PROMOTE HIGHER STINGLESS BEE COMMUNITY TURNOVER IN WHITE-SAND HABITATS THAN NON-WHITE SAND HABITATS.",MELIPONINI; BETA-DIVERSITY; DISTANCE-BASED REDUNDANCY ANALYSIS; PERU; WHITE-SAND FOREST,WHITE-SAND FORESTS; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; RAIN-FOREST; DIVERSITY; PATTERNS; GRADIENT; MELASTOMATACEAE; POPULATION; ORDINATION; DISPERSAL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"MISIEWICZ, TM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT INTEGRAT BIOL, 3060 VALLEY LIFE SCI BLDG 3140, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.;MISIEWICZ, T.

THE FORMER WAS SURVEYED IN A SEMI-DECIDUOUS MESOPHYTIC FOREST AT THE BIOLOGICAL RESERVE OF SERRA DO JAPI AND IN A MARSHY FOREST AT THE CITY OF PRADOPOLIS, SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. THE LATTER WAS EXAMINED IN ROCKY OUTCROP VEGETATION IN THE CHAPADA DIAMANTINA, NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL.

IN TWO SEPARATE DESIGNS, BOTH LOCATED IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, WE TESTED IF LOCAL ORGANIC FARMING AND THE LANDSCAPE PROPORTION OF CONVENTIONALLY MANAGED LEYS, ALONG A LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY GRADIENT, AFFECTED THE POLLINATION SUCCESS OF FIELD BEAN. THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPED PODS WAS HIGHER ON ORGANIC FARMS COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL ONES. DEVELOPMENT OF BEANS, WHICH DEMANDS HIGH POLLINATION EFFICIENCY, INCREASED WITH INCREASING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY, BUT ONLY ON ORGANIC FARMS. INCREASING PROPORTION OF LEY ON CONVENTIONAL FARMS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF BEANS. THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPED PODS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF LEY IN THE LANDSCAPE. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE POLLINATION SUCCESS IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE BOTH FIELD MANAGEMENT AND PRESERVE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE.

STANLEY DA;STOUT JC,STANLEY DA,POLLINATOR SHARING BETWEEN MASS-FLOWERING OILSEED RAPE AND CO-FLOWERING WILD PLANTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR WILD PLANT POLLINATION,PLANT ECOLOGY,PLANT ECOL.,"POLLINATING INSECTS ARE NOT ONLY IMPORTANT IN WILD PLANT POLLINATION, BUT ALSO IN THE PRODUCTION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CROPS. OILSEED RAPE PRODUCTION IS INCREASING GLOBALLY DUE TO DEMANDS FOR BIOFUELS WHICH MAY HAVE IMPACTS ON POLLINATING INSECTS WHICH VISIT THE CROP AND ON THE POLLINATION SERVICES DELIVERED TO CO-FLOWERING WILD PLANTS. IN THIS STUDY, WE TESTED (1) THE DEGREE OF POLLINATOR SHARING BETWEEN OILSEED RAPE AND NATIVE WILD PLANTS IN FIELD MARGINS AND HEDGEROWS AND (2) THE EFFECTS OF OILSEED RAPE ON THE QUALITY OF POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERED TO THESE WILD PLANTS. WE FOUND LARGE OVERLAP BETWEEN FLOWER VISITORS OF WILD PLANTS AND OILSEED RAPE, BUT THE COMPOSITION OF SPECIES OVERLAP DIFFERED WITH RESPECT TO EACH WILD PLANT SPECIES.

HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE OILSEED RAPE POLLEN WAS DEPOSITED ON WILD PLANT STIGMAS. THIS SHOWS THAT (1) OILSEED RAPE OVERLAPS IN POLLINATOR NICHE WITH MOST CO-FLOWERING WILD PLANTS, AND (2) CROP POLLEN DEPOSITION ON WILD PLANT STIGMAS IS LOW WHICH MAY INDICATE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY TO CAUSE REDUCTIONS IN SEED SET OF WILD PLANTS, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT MEASURED HERE.

PERSSON AS;RUNDLOF M;CLOUGH Y;SMITH HG,PERSSON AS,BUMBLE BEES SHOW TRAIT-DEPENDENT VULNERABILITY TO LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,BIODIVERS. CONSERV.,"AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION HAS RESULTED IN LARGE-SCALE LOSS OF BEE POLLINATORS, BUT WHILE SOME SPECIES HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OTHERS SEEM TO ENDURE CHANGED CONDITIONS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT CERTAIN MORPHOLOGICAL, ECOLOGICAL AND LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS MAKE SOME SPECIES MORE VULNERABLE TO LANDSCAPE CHANGES. INFORMATION ON WHICH TRAITS MAKE SPECIES VULNERABLE AND WHY MAY AID CONSERVATION OF DECLINING SPECIES. WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW MULTIPLE TRAITS RELATED TO DIET BREADTH, MOVEMENT AND NESTING HABITS MODERATE VULNERABILITY OF BUMBLE BEES TO LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION. WE SURVEYED BUMBLE BEES IN FLOWER-RICH NON-CROP HABITATS IN EITHER COMPLEX LANDSCAPES (WITH SMALL CROP FIELDS BORDERED BY NON-CROP HABITATS), OR SIMPLE LANDSCAPES (WITH LARGER FIELDS AND THEREFORE LESS NON-CROP HABITATS). WE ANALYSED IF LANDSCAPE TYPE INTERACTED WITH COLONY SIZE, QUEEN EMERGENCE DATE, COLONY LIFE-CYCLE LENGTH, NESTING HABITAT, THORAX WIDTH, PROBOSCIS LENGTH OR VARIABILITY IN THORAX AND PROBOSCIS, TO EXPLAIN BUMBLE BEE ABUNDANCES. WORKERS AND MALES OF SPECIES WITH ABOVE-GROUND NESTS, SMALL SIZED COLONIES AND LONG COLONY CYCLE WERE RELATIVELY LESS ABUNDANT IN SIMPLE COMPARED TO IN COMPLEX LANDSCAPES. SIMPLE LANDSCAPES HOSTED FEWER MALES OF LATE EMERGING SPECIES AND SPECIES WITH HIGHLY VARIABLE PROBOSCIS LENGTH. THIS SUGGESTS THAT BOTH NESTING HABITAT AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL AVAILABILITY OF FOOD RESOURCES ACT AS ECOLOGICAL FILTERS FOR BUMBLE BEES. COLONY SIZE CORRELATED WITH NESTING HABITAT AND QUEEN EMERGENCE WHEN CORRECTING FOR PHYLOGENETIC CORRELATIONS, SUGGESTING THAT LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION ACTS THROUGH EFFECTS ON COMBINATIONS OF TRAITS. OUR RESULTS HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSERVATION BY SUGGESTING THAT DECLINING BUMBLE BEE SPECIES CAN BE SUPPORTED BY PROVIDING ADEQUATE NESTING HABITATS AND PREFERRED PLANT SPECIES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON AND WITHIN SHORT DISTANCE FROM NESTING HABITATS, TO ALLOW UTILISATION ALSO BY SPECIES HAVING COLONIES WITH FEW WORKERS.",BOMBUS; INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; NESTING HABITAT; PHENOLOGY; PHYLOGENY,LAND-USE; CONSERVATION; RARITY; AVAILABILITY; HABITATS; DECLINES; DENSITY; CONTEXT; BREADTH; SCALE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,12,"PERSSON, AS (REPRINT AUTHOR), LUND UNIV, DEPT BIOL, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN.;PERSSON, ANNA S., RUNDLOF, MAJ, SMITH, HENRIK G., LUND UNIV, DEPT BIOL, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN.;CLOUGH, YANN, SMITH, HENRIK G., LUND UNIV, CTR ENVIRONM \& CLIMATE RES, S-22362 LUND, SWEDEN.",10.1007/S10531-015-1008-3,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,FORMASSWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL FORMAS,"Y.

EVOL.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS - HABITAT FRAGMENTATION MAY COMPROMISE POPULATION SURVIVAL AND DECREASE THE ABILITY TO FACE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. SMALL AND ISOLATED POPULATIONS IN PARTICULAR MAY SUFFER FROM DISRUPTED POLLINATION PROCESSES. HOWEVER, A SPECIES' RESPONSE TO FRAGMENTATION MAY VARY ACCORDING TO LIFE HISTORY TRAITS. UNDERSTANDING HOW POLLEN DISPERSAL IS SHAPED BY POPULATION AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS SUCH AS MATING SYSTEM AND CLONAL GROWTH IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL FOR ASSESSING SPECIES' RESPONSE TO FRAGMENTATION. METHODS - WE INVESTIGATED POLLEN DISPERSAL USING FLUORESCENT DYES IN NINE BELGIAN POPULATIONS IN TWO REGIONS OF THE DISTYLOUS INSECT-POLLINATED CLONAL HERB MENYANTHES TRIFOLIATA. WE EXAMINED WHETHER OVERALL AND LEGITIMATE (I.E. BETWEEN-MORPH) DYE DISPERSAL PATTERNS DIFFERED BETWEEN MORPHS AND REGIONS, AND WHETHER THEY WERE INFLUENCED BY POPULATION TRAITS (SIZE, AREA, PLANT DENSITY, MORPH RATIO, CO-FLOWERING SPECIES) AND INDIVIDUAL PLANT TRAITS (NUMBER OF FLOWERS). KEY RESULTS - NO EVIDENCE OF DYE TRANSFER BETWEEN ADJACENT POPULATIONS (DISTANT FROM 1.3 TO 11.8 KM) WAS FOUND, SUGGESTING NO OR VERY RESTRICTED BETWEEN-POPULATION POLLEN FLOW. WITHIN-POPULATION DYE DISPERSAL FOLLOWED A DECAYING, USUALLY LEPTOKURTIC, DISTRIBUTION, WITH MOST DYE DEPOSITION AT SHORT DISTANCES (80\% AT LESS THAN 1.9-49.1 M), AND A MAXIMUM DISTANCE OF 336.6 M. PINS AND THRUMS AS RECIPIENTS OR DONORS DID NOT DIFFER IN DYE DISPERSAL. LEGITIMATE DYE DISPERSAL WAS NOT LESS SUCCESSFUL THAN OVERALL DISPERSAL DESPITE SPATIAL CLUMPING OF THE MORPHS. THE DISTRIBUTION WAS SIMILAR OR SIMPLY SHIFTED TO LONGER DISTANCES. THE PROPORTION OF DYED STIGMAS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO FLOWERING POPULATION SIZE AND WITHIN-POPULATION HETEROSPECIFIC FLORISTIC RICHNESS, AND TO THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS WHEN CONSIDERING LEGITIMATE DYE DEPOSITION AT DISTANCES <32 M.

THE CENTRAL IMPORTANCE OF POLLEN FOR THE BEE LIFE CYCLE SHOULD EXERT STRONG SELECTION ON THEIR ABILITY TO LOCATE THE MOST REWARDING SOURCES OF POLLEN. DESPITE THIS IMPORTANCE, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN POLLEN REWARDS ON THE FORAGING DECISIONS OF BEES. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT INBREEDING REDUCES VIABILITY AND HENCE PROTEIN CONTENT IN MIMULUS GUTTATUS (SEEP MONKEYFLOWER) POLLEN AND THAT BEES STRONGLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST INBRED IN FAVOUR OF OUTBRED PLANTS. WE EXAMINED WHETHER VARIATION IN POLLEN VIABILITY COULD EXPLAIN THIS PREFERENCE USING A SERIES OF CHOICE TESTS WITH LIVING PLANTS, ARTIFICIAL PLANTS AND OLFACTOMETER TESTS USING THE BUMBLE BEE BOMBUS IMPATIENS. WE FOUND THAT B. IMPATIENS PREFERRED TO VISIT ARTIFICIAL PLANTS PROVISIONED WITH FERTILE ANTHERS OVER THOSE PROVISIONED WITH STERILE ANTHERS. THEY ALSO PREFERRED FERTILE ANTHERS WHEN PROVIDED ONLY OLFACTORY CUES. THESE BUMBLE BEES WERE UNABLE TO DISCRIMINATE AMONG LIVE PLANTS FROM SUBPOPULATIONS DIFFERING DRAMATICALLY IN POLLEN VIABILITY, HOWEVER. THEY PREFERRED OUTBRED PLANTS EVEN WHEN THOSE PLANTS WERE FROM SUBPOPULATIONS WITH POLLEN VIABILITY AS LOW AS THE INBRED POPULATIONS. THEIR PREFERENCE FOR OUTBRED PLANTS WAS EVIDENT EVEN WHEN ONLY OLFACTORY CUES WERE AVAILABLE. OUR DATA SHOWED THAT BUMBLE BEES ARE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN ANTHERS THAT PROVIDE HIGHER REWARDS WHEN CUES ARE ISOLATED FROM THE REST OF THE FLOWER. WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CUES FROM THE ENTIRE FLOWER, THEIR CHOICES ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE QUALITY OF THE POLLEN REWARD, SUGGESTING THAT THEY ARE RESPONDING MORE STRONGLY TO CUES UNASSOCIATED WITH REWARDS THAN TO THOSE CORRELATED WITH REWARDS.

PUBLISHED SPATIAL PRIORITIZATION EXERCISES OFTEN FOCUS ON WELL-STUDIED GROUPS, WITH DATA COMPILED FROM ON-LINE DATABASES OF AD-HOC COLLECTIONS. CONSERVATION PLANS GENERALLY AIM TO PROTECT ALL COMPONENTS OF BIODIVERSITY, AND IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE SPECIES USED IN PRIORITIZATION ACT AS SURROGATES. HERE, WE ASSESS THE SENSITIVITY OF SPATIAL PRIORITIES TO MODEL AND SURROGATE CHOICE USING A CASE STUDY FROM A FRAGMENTED AGRICULTURAL AREA OF SOUTH EASTERN AUSTRALIA THAT IS POORLY REPRESENTED IN THE NATIONAL RESERVE SYSTEM. WE MODEL THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF 30 SPECIES OF BIRD, MICROBAT AND BEE USING TWO TYPES OF SDM, GENERALISED LINEAR MODELS BASED ON SYSTEMATIC SURVEYS THAT YIELD PRESENCE AND ABSENCE OBSERVATIONS, AND MAXENT MODELS BASED ON BIODIVERSITY DATABASE RECORDS. EIGHT PRIORITIZATION SCENARIOS WERE TESTED USING ZONATION SOFTWARE, AND WERE BASED ON EITHER THE PRESENCE-BACKGROUND OR PRESENCE-ABSENCE SDMS AND COMBINATIONS OF SURROGACY AMONG THE THREE TAXA. WE FOUND LOW CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SDMS GENERATED FOR THE SAME SPECIES USING DIFFERENT MODELLING FRAMEWORKS ( = 0.18, N=26). AREA UNDER THE RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVE (AUC) ESTIMATES GENERATED BY MAXENT WERE OPTIMISTIC, ON AVERAGE 1.36 TIMES HIGHER THAN WHEN TESTED AGAINST THE SYSTEMATIC SURVEY DATA. CONSERVATION PRIORITIES WERE SENSITIVE TO THE CHOICE OF SURROGATE AND TYPE OF DATA USED TO FIT SDMS, AND THOUGH BATS AND BIRDS FORMED MODERATELY GOOD SURROGATES FOR EACH OTHER, THERE WAS LESS COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF SURROGACY FOR BEES. BECAUSE VALID SURROGACY IS UNLIKELY WITH MOST EXISTING DATA SETS, INVESTMENT IN HIGH QUALITY DATA FOR LESS-SURVEYED GROUPS PRIOR TO PLANNING SHOULD STILL BE A PRIORITY.

REWARDS WERE MEASURED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECIES RANGE. GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF REWARD QUANTITY AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS WERE EXAMINED USING UNI- AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. LATITUDE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPLAINED POPULATION VARIATION IN NECTAR AND OILS, ALTHOUGH IN CONTRASTING WAYS. POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES SHOWED A PREVALENCE OF OIL-COLLECTING CENTRIS BEES. CENTRIS VARDYORUM, SPECIALIZED ON M.APHYLLA, SHOWED A LATITUDINAL PATTERN OF VISITS. OIL PRODUCTION WAS NOT HIGHER WHERE PLANTS ASSOCIATED WITH ECOLOGICALLY SPECIALIZED BEES (I.E. C.VARDYORUM), BUT THIS OCCURRED INSTEAD WHERE THEY WERE LESS FREQUENT AND CO-OCCURRED WITH OTHER BEES THAT USED MANY FLORAL SOURCES, INCLUDING OTHER PLANT SPECIES THAT PRODUCE OIL. THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE PREVALENCE OF C.VARDYORUM WAS THE FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTED MOST SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE COMBINED PATTERNS OF REWARDS.

TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF POLLEN AVAILABILITY, TEMPERATURE, AND POLLINATORS ON SEED PRODUCTION IN THE ALPINE, WE COMBINED POLLEN-MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS WITH MEASUREMENTS OF VARIATION IN TEMPERATURE, AND ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF POTENTIAL POLLINATORS ALONG A 400-M ELEVATION GRADIENT. WE DID THIS FOR SEVEN DOMINANT SPECIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS IN THE COAST RANGE MOUNTAINS, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. THE NUMBER OF VIABLE SEEDS SET BY PLANTS WAS INFLUENCED BY POLLEN LIMITATION (QUANTITY OF POLLEN RECEIVED), MATE LIMITATION (QUALITY OF POLLEN), TEMPERATURE, ABUNDANCE OF POTENTIAL POLLINATORS, SEED PREDATION, AND COMBINATIONS OF THESE FACTORS. EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES (N=3) HAD HIGHER SEED SET AT HIGH ELEVATION AND LATE-FLOWERING SPECIES (N=4) HAD HIGHER SEED SET AT LOW ELEVATION. DEGREE-DAYS >15 DEGREES C WERE GOOD PREDICTORS OF SEED SET, PARTICULARLY IN BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES, BUT HAD INCONSISTENT EFFECTS AMONG SPECIES. SEED PRODUCTION IN ONE SPECIES, ARNICA LATIFOLIA, WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY SEED-PREDATORS (TEPHRITIDAE) AT MID ELEVATION, WHERE THERE WERE FEWER FROST-HOURS DURING THE FLOWERING SEASON. ANEMONE OCCIDENTALIS, A FLY-POLLINATED, SELF-COMPATIBLE SPECIES HAD HIGH SEED SET AT ALL ELEVATIONS, LIKELY DUE TO ABUNDANT POTENTIAL POLLINATORS.

SESSILIS VELL., IN TWO CONSECUTIVE FLOWERING SEASONS IN AN ATLANTIC FOREST FRAGMENT IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. THE SPECIES HAVE DIURNAL, CREAM-COLORED, TUBULAR, NECTARIFEROUS FLOWERS AND THEIR FLOWERING OCCURS IN THE RAINY SEASON, FROM SEPTEMBER TO APRIL, WITH LITTLE OR NO OVERLAPPING BETWEEN SPECIES, CHARACTERIZING A STAGGERED FLOWERING. THE FLOWERING OF THE LONG- AND SHORT-STYLED FLORAL MORPHS OF EACH SPECIES WAS SYNCHRONOUS, BUT THE NUMBER OF OPEN FLOWERS PER DAY PER MORPH TENDED TO VARY IN EACH FLOWERING SEASON. THESE NUMBERS WERE HIGHER IN P. SESSILIS AND P. CONJUGENS AND, PROBABLY, RESULTED IN HIGHER TOTAL NUMBERS OF VISITS ON ITS FLOWERS (UP TO 1084 VISITS IN P. SESSILIS AND 756 IN P. CONJUGENS), COMPARED TO THAT OBSERVED IN P. HASTISEPALA (UP TO 71). THERE WAS A HIGHER FREQUENCY OF VISITS TO LONG-STYLED FLOWERS OF ALL SPECIES. THE BEE ARIPHANARTHRA PALPAILS WAS A COMMON POLLINATOR TO ALL SPECIES. THIS BEE IS NATIVE TO BRAZIL, SOLITARY, CONSIDERED RELATIVELY RARE AND ITS HOST PLANTS WERE UNKNOWN. OTHER NATIVE BEES (MELIPONA SPP.) ALSO VISITED THE FLOWERS OF THE PSYCHOTRIA SPECIES. THE AVAILABILITY OF FLOWERS WITH SIMILAR FLORAL FEATURES OVER EIGHT MONTHS, THE STAGGERED FLOWERING AND COMMON POLLINATORS APPEAR TO BE PART OF A STRATEGY TO ATTRACT FLORAL VISITORS, MINIMIZING THE COMPETITION FOR POLLINATORS AND THEN FAVORING THE LEGITIMATE POLLINATION OF THESE PLANTS.",BEES; SEQUENTIAL FLOWERING; FREQUENCY OF VISITS,REPRODUCTIVE-SUCCESS; SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL; RAIN-FOREST; PHENOLOGY; DIVERSITY; FRAGMENT; SYSTEM; TREES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"SILVA, CA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADO MATO GROSSO, CTR ESTUDOS \& DESENVOLVIMENTO AGROAMBIENTAL, LAB BOT, TANGARA DA SERRA, MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL.;SILVA, CELICE ALEXANDRE, UNIV ESTADO MATO GROSSO, CTR ESTUDOS \& DESENVOLVIMENTO AGROAMBIENTAL, LAB BOT, TANGARA DA SERRA, MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL.;VIEIRA, MILENE FARIA, UNIV FED VICOSA, DEPT BIOL VEGETAL, LAB BIOL, VICOSA, MG, BRAZIL.",10.1590/0100-67622015000500001,"CAIXA POSTAL 270, VICOSA, MG CEP 36571-00, BRAZIL",NA,RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS - FAPEMIGMINAS GERAIS STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION (FAPEMIG),THE AUTHORS ARE INDEBTED TO THE RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF THE STATE OF MINAS GERAIS - FAPEMIG FOR THE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND TO THE ADMINISTRATION STAFF OF THE MATA DO PARAISO FOR GRANTING ACCESS TO THE STUDY AREA.

CORYNURA SPINOLA AND HALICTILLUS MOURE (HALICTIDAE: AUGOCHLORINI) CONTAIN SPECIES THAT ARE KEY ELEMENTS IN SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICAN ECOSYSTEMS. THESE BEES ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY DUE TO CLOSE MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITY AMONG SPECIES AND HIGH SEXUAL DIMORPHISM. WE ANALYZED 170 BARCODE-COMPLIANT COI SEQUENCES FROM 19 SPECIES. DNA BARCODES WERE USEFUL TO CONFIRM GENDER ASSOCIATIONS AND TO DETECT TWO NEW CRYPTIC SPECIES. INTERSPECIFIC DISTANCES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE REPORTED FOR OTHER BEES. MAXIMUM INTRASPECIFIC DIVERGENCE WAS LESS THAN 1\% IN 14 SPECIES. BARCODE INDEX NUMBERS (BINS) WERE USEFUL TO IDENTIFY PUTATIVE SPECIES THAT NEED FURTHER STUDY. MORE THAN ONE BIN WAS ASSIGNED TO FIVE SPECIES. THE NAME CORYNURA PATAGONICA (COCKERELL) PROBABLY REFERS TO TWO CRYPTIC SPECIES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CORYNURA AND HALICTILLUS SPECIES CAN BE IDENTIFIED USING DNA BARCODES.

ALTHOUGH ESTIMATES OF FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY ARE ESSENTIAL TO UNDERSTAND PLANT-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS, NO GENERALLY ACCEPTED METHODOLOGY EXISTS TO DATE. WE COMPARED TWO METHODS FOR SAMPLING FLORAL RESOURCES IN A SINGLE MEADOW. ABOUT EVERY THREE DAYS, WE RECORDED SPECIES LISTS OF INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS WITH ABUNDANCE CATEGORIES ASSIGNED TO EACH SPECIES (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS SCANNING) AND WE COUNTED THE FLOWERING SHOOTS IN 36 2X2M QUADRATS (HEREAFTER QUADRAT SAMPLING). THESE METHODS WERE COMPARED WITH RESPECT TO (I) THE NUMBER OF SPECIES DETECTED, (II) ESTIMATED FLORAL RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, AND (III) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN FLOWERING. WITH SCANNING, WE FOUND MORE POTENTIAL NECTAR-PLANT SPECIES AND SPECIES WERE FOUND EARLIER THAN WITH QUADRAT SAMPLING. WITH THE LATTER, ABUNDANT SPECIES WERE FOUND WITH HIGHER PROBABILITY THAN THE SCARCE. FLOWER ABUNDANCES WERE CORRELATED BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS. WE PREDICTED THAT A COVER OF 6.33.6\% SHOULD BE USED FOR AN APPROPRIATE ESTIMATE OF FLOWER ABUNDANCE IN OUR STUDY SITE, ALTHOUGH THE OPTIMAL COVER PROBABLY VARIES ACROSS DIFFERENT HABITATS. FURTHERMORE, FLOWER ABUNDANCE CHANGED 6\% PER DAY COMPARED TO THE FLOWERING PEAK. OVERALL, SCANNING SEEMS TO BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR DETECTING PRESENCE AND THE TIMING OF SPECIES, WHILE QUADRATS MAY PROVIDE HIGHER RESOLUTION FOR ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES.

EVOL.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS - APIOS PRICEANA IS A RARE FLOWERING PLANT THAT CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THIS PLANT AND ONLY A FEW INSECT FLOWER VISITORS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FURTHER DOCUMENT THE INSECT FLOWER VISITORS OF A. PRICEANA IN NORTH ALABAMA. METHODS - CAMERAS AND OBSERVERS RECORDED FLOWER VISITORS DURING THE 2014 BLOOMING SEASON OF A LARGE NORTH ALABAMA POPULATION OF A. PRICEANA. KEY RESULTS - ALTHOUGH FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SPECIES OF INSECTS WERE DOCUMENTED ON FLOWERS OF A. PRICEANA, MOST PERFORMED A SINGLE OR VERY FEW VISITS. BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.), TWO SPECIES OF MEGACHILIDAE (MEGACHILE SCULPTURALIS AND MEGACHILE CAMPANULAE), AND THE HUMMINGBIRD CLEARWING (HEMARIS THYSBE) WERE THE MOST COMMON VISITORS. INTERESTINGLY, THE GIANT RESIN BEE, M. SCULPTURALIS, IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN INVASIVE SPECIES BUT IN THIS CASE MAY BE POLLINATING A NATIVE AND FEDERALLY THREATENED PLANT. CONCLUSION - ALTHOUGH A.

ECON.,"CROP POLLINATION BY BEES HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN ECOSYSTEM SERVICE OF HUGE ECONOMIC VALUE, A LARGE NUMBER OF FOOD CROPS DEPEND UPON POLLINATION. FEATURES ACROSS LANDSCAPES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR POLLINATION DELIVERY INCLUDE: NESTING HABITATS, FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AT FORAGING DISTANCE, AND CLIMATE. THE CONDITIONS FOR PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS ARE THEREFORE COMPLEX AND RELY UPON A COMBINATION OF BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS. TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN NO EASILY AVAILABLE METHOD FOR LANDOWNERS TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF POLLINATION DELIVERY ACROSS THE LAND EFFECTIVELY AND RAPIDLY. IN THIS PAPER WE DEVELOP A METHOD THAT USES FREELY AVAILABLE DATASETS TO REMOTELY ESTIMATE THE RELATIVE PROVISION OF POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERY PROVIDED BY BEES ACROSS EUROPE AT A 300 M-PIXEL RESOLUTION. WE THEN IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL POLLINATION DELIVERY AND EFFICIENCY ACROSS EUROPE AT COUNTRY AND REGIONAL LEVEL.

BOT.,"BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS FLORAL TRAITS THAT ATTRACT POLLINATORS MAY ALSO ATTRACT SEED PREDATORS, WHICH, IN TURN, MAY GENERATE CONFLICTING NATURAL SELECTION ON SUCH TRAITS. ALTHOUGH SUCH SELECTION TRADE-OFFS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED SELECTION MEDIATED BY POLLINATORS AND SEED PREDATORS ACROSS A GEOGRAPHIC MOSAIC OF ENVIRONMENTS AND FLORAL VARIATION. METHODS FLORAL TRAITS WERE INVESTIGATED IN 14 POPULATIONS OF THE BUMBLE-BEE-POLLINATED HERB, PEDICULARIS REX, IN WHICH TUBULAR FLOWERS ARE SUBTENDED BY CUPULAR BRACTS HOLDING RAIN WATER. TO STUDY POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING SELECTION ON FLORAL TRAITS GENERATED BY POLLINATORS AND FLORIVORES, STIGMATIC POLLEN LOADS, INITIAL SEED SET, PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION AND FINAL VIABLE SEED PRODUCTION WERE MEASURED IN 12-14 POPULATIONS IN THE FIELD. KEY RESULTS GENERALIZED LINEAR MODEL (GLM) ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE POLLEN LOAD ON STIGMAS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE EXSERTION OF THE COROLLA BEYOND THE CUPULAR BRACTS AND SIZE OF THE LOWER COROLLA LIP, BUT SO TOO WAS THE RATE OF SEED PREDATION, CREATING CONFLICTING SELECTION ON BOTH FLORAL TRAITS. A GEOGRAPHIC MOSAIC OF SELECTION MEDIATED BY SEED PREDATORS, BUT NOT POLLINATORS, WAS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN LEVELS OF SEED PREDATION AND THE INCLUSION OF TWO-, THREE- AND FOUR-WAY INTERACTION TERMS BETWEEN POPULATION AND SEED PREDATION IN THE BEST MODEL [LOWEST CORRECTED AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION (AICC)] EXPLAINING FINAL SEED PRODUCTION. CONCLUSIONS THESE RESULTS INDICATE OPPOSING SELECTION IN OPERATION: POLLINATORS GENERATED SELECTION FOR GREATER FLORAL EXSERTION BEYOND THE BRACTS, BUT SEED PREDATORS GENERATED SELECTION FOR REDUCED EXSERTION ABOVE THE PROTECTIVE POOLS OF WATER, ALTHOUGH THE STRENGTH OF THE LATTER VARIED ACROSS POPULATIONS.",COROLLA TUBE LENGTH; CUPULAR BRACT; GEOGRAPHIC SELECTION MOSAIC; PEDICULARIS REX; PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION ANALYSIS; STIGMATIC POLLEN LOAD; SEED SURVIVAL,NATURAL-SELECTION; FLORAL TRAITS; REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; PHENOTYPIC VARIATION; PERENNIAL HERB; PLANT; PEDICULARIS; HERBIVORY; FLOWERS; FITNESS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"HUANG, SQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), CENT CHINA NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, WUHAN 430079, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SUN, SHI-GUO, HUANG, SHUANG-QUAN, CENT CHINA NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, WUHAN 430079, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ARMBRUSTER, W.

SCI. POLLUT. RES.,"PESTICIDES HAVE BECOME AN INSEPARABLE ELEMENT OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. WHILE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF PESTICIDES ON NON-TARGET ORGANISMS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS, HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION, LESS CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE MICROORGANISMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. SPECIALIST YEASTS AND BACTERIA ARE KNOWN TO COMMONLY INHABIT FLORAL NECTAR AND CHANGE ITS CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN NUMEROUS WAYS, POSSIBLY INFLUENCING POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE IN VITRO SUSCEPTIBILITY OF NECTAR YEASTS METSCHNIKOWIA GRUESSI, METSCHNIKOWIA REUKAUFII, AND CANDIDA BOMBI TO SIX WIDELY USED AGRICULTURAL FUNGICIDES (PROTHIOCONAZOLE, TEBUCONAZOLE, AZOXYSTROBIN, FENAMIDONE, BOSCALID, AND FLUOPYRAM). NEXT, A COMMERCIAL ANTIFUNGAL MIXTURE CONTAINING TEBUCONAZOLE AND TRIFLOXYSTROBIN WAS APPLIED TO NATURAL POPULATIONS OF THE PLANT LINARIA VULGARIS AND THE OCCURRENCE, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY OF NECTAR-INHABITING YEASTS AND BACTERIA WAS COMPARED BETWEEN TREATED AND UNTREATED PLANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PROTHIOCONAZOLE AND TEBUCONAZOLE WERE HIGHLY TOXIC TO NECTAR YEASTS, INHIBITING THEIR GROWTH AT CONCENTRATIONS VARYING BETWEEN 0.06 AND 0.5 MG/L. AZOXYSTROBIN, FENAMIDONE, BOSCALID, AND FLUOPYRAM ON THE OTHER HAND EXHIBITED CONSIDERABLY LOWER TOXICITY, INHIBITING YEAST GROWTH AT CONCENTRATIONS BETWEEN 1 AND 32 MG/L OR IN MANY CASES NOT INHIBITING MICROBIAL GROWTH AT ALL. THE APPLICATION OF THE ANTIFUNGAL MIXTURE IN NATURAL PLANT POPULATIONS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF YEASTS IN INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS, BUT THIS DID NOT TRANSLATE INTO NOTICEABLE CHANGES IN BACTERIAL INCIDENCE AND ABUNDANCE. YEAST AND BACTERIAL SPECIES RICHNESS AND DISTRIBUTION DID NOT ALSO DIFFER BETWEEN TREATED AND UNTREATED PLANTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE APPLICATION OF FUNGICIDES MAY HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ABUNDANCE OF NECTAR YEASTS IN FLORAL NECTAR.

HORTIC.,"POLLINATION REMAINS CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVE VALUABLE FRUIT YIELD IN EUROPEAN PEAR (PYRUS COMMUNIS) ORCHARDS. AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVE POLLEN TRANSFER INVOLVES THE USE OF POLLEN DISPENSERS AT THE HIVE ENTRANCE. DUE TO ITS COMMERCIAL AVAILABILITY, NASHI (PYRUS PYRIFOLIA) POLLEN IS PROPOSED IN POLLEN DISPENSERS FITTED IN BUMBLEBEE HIVES FOR EUROPEAN PEAR TREE POLLINATION. OUR OBJECTIVES WERE (1) TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER NASHI POLLEN IS SUITABLE FOR POLLINATION OF EUROPEAN PEAR AND (2) TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF POLLEN DISPENSER IN BUMBLEBEE HIVES. TO TEST THE COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN BOTH SPECIES, NASHI POLLEN WERE USED IN HAND-POLLINATION OF TWO EUROPEAN PEAR TREE CULTIVARS `CONFERENCE' AND `DOYENNE DU COMICE'. THE IMPACT OF NASHI POLLEN ON THE BUMBLEBEE BEHAVIOUR WAS INVESTIGATED AT THE HIVE EXIT. NASHI POLLEN WAS SUITABLE FOR POLLINATION OF `CONFERENCE' AND `DOYENNE DU CORNICE'. `CONFERENCE' FRUITS RESULTING FROM POLLINATION WITH NASHI WERE SMALLER (53 +/- 1.5 MM) THAN THOSE POLLINATED WITH `DOYENNE DU COMICE' (60 +/- 1.1 MM) WHILE FRUIT DIAMETER OF `DOYENNE DU CORNICE' DID NOT VARY WITH THE POLLEN ORIGIN (71 +/- 1.3 VS. 69 +/- 1.2 MM). POLLEN DEPOSIT AT THE HIVE ENTRANCE DID NOT MODIFY BUMBLEBEE BEHAVIOUR. ALL INSECTS LEAVING THE HIVE WERE COVERED WITH POLLEN EVEN IF THEIR POLLEN CHARGE DECREASED BY 53\% 24H AFTER POLLEN DEPOSIT. ALL TOGETHER OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NASHI POLLEN COULD BE USED IN POLLEN DISPENSER FOR POLLINATION OF THE EUROPEAN PEAR CULTIVARS `CONFERENCE' AND `DOYENNE DU CORNICE' IF POLLEN DISPENSER IS REFILLED AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.

IN PARTICULAR, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHETHER AND HOW IT AFFECTS THE COMPOSITION AND FUNCTIONING OF FLOWER VISITOR ASSEMBLAGES IS SCANT, YET REQUIRED TO COPE WITH INCREASING URBANIZATION WORLDWIDE. HERE, WE USE A NATION-WIDE DATASET OF PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR (COLEOPTERA, DIPTERA, HYMENOPTERA, LEPIDOPTERA) INTERACTIONS SAMPLED BY CITIZEN SCIENTISTS FOLLOWING A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL TO ASSESS MACROECOLOGICAL CHANGES IN RICHNESS AND COMPOSITION OF FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITIES WITH URBANIZATION. WE MEASURED THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION BY QUANTIFYING THE RELATIVE OCCURRENCE OF GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST FLOWER VISITORS BASED ON THEIR SPECIALISATION ON FLOWERING PLANT FAMILIES. WE SHOW THAT URBANIZATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED FLOWER VISITOR RICHNESS AND A SHIFT IN COMMUNITY COMPOSITION TOWARD GENERALIST INSECTS, INDICATING A MODIFICATION OF THE FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF COMMUNITIES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT URBANIZATION AFFECTS NOT ONLY THE RICHNESS OF FLOWER VISITOR ASSEMBLAGES BUT MAY ALSO CAUSE THEIR LARGE-SCALE FUNCTIONAL HOMOGENIZATION.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"MANAGEMENT THAT ENHANCES FLORAL RESOURCES CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO SUPPORT POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION SERVICES. SOME WILDLIFE-FRIENDLY FARMING SCHEMES AIM TO ENHANCE THE DENSITY AND DIVERSITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN NON-CROP HABITATS ON FARMS, WHILST MANAGING CROP FIELDS INTENSIVELY. OTHERS, SUCH AS ORGANIC FARMING, AIM TO SUPPORT ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES WITHIN BOTH CROP AND NON-CROP HABITATS. HOW EFFECTIVE THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ARE FOR SUPPORTING POLLINATION SERVICES AT THE FARM SCALE IS UNKNOWN. WE COMPARED ORGANIC FARMING WITH TWO NON-ORGANIC WILDLIFE-FRIENDLY FARMING SCHEMES: ONE PRESCRIPTIVE (CONSERVATION GRADE, CG) AND ONE FLEXIBLE (ENTRY LEVEL STEWARDSHIP, ELS), AND SAMPLED A REPRESENTATIVE SELECTION OF CROP AND NON-CROP HABITATS. WE INVESTIGATED THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND OVERALL LEVEL OF: (I) FLOWER DENSITY AND DIVERSITY, (II) POLLINATOR DENSITY AND DIVERSITY AND (III) POLLINATION SERVICES PROVIDED TO CALIFORNIAN POPPY (ESCHSCHOLZIA CALIFORNICA) POTTED PHYTOMETER PLANTS. ORGANIC CROP HABITATS SUPPORTED A HIGHER DENSITY OF FLOWERS, INSECT-WILDFLOWER VISITS, AND FRUIT SET OF PHYTOMETERS THAN CG OR ELS CROP HABITATS. NON-CROP HABITATS SUPPORTED A HIGHER DENSITY OF FLOWERS AND INSECT-FLOWER VISITS THAN CROP HABITATS ON CG AND ELS FARMS. POLLINATION SERVICES WERE HIGHER ON ORGANIC FARMS OVERALL COMPARED TO CG OR ELS. POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND DENSITY DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN SCHEMES, AT THE POINT OR FARM LEVEL. CG FARMS RECEIVED THE HIGHEST TOTAL NUMBER OF INSECT-WILDFLOWER VISITS. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT ORGANIC FARMING PRACTICES THAT INCREASE FLORAL RESOURCES IN CROP HABITATS, SUCH AS SOWING CLOVER OR REDUCED HERBICIDE USAGE, AS MECHANISMS TO ENHANCE POLLINATION SERVICES. HOWEVER TRADE-OFFS WITH OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE LIKELY AND THESE ARE DISCUSSED. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE CG SCHEME AS A WAY OF SUPPORTING POLLINATORS WITHIN FARMS WHERE HIGH WHEAT YIELDS ARE REQUIRED. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER B.V.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING HOW THESE CHANGES AFFECT POLLINATOR DIVERSITY. LAND USE TYPES WERE CATEGORIZED WITHIN 300M AND 3KM RADII OF POLLINATOR SAMPLING LOCATIONS IN BROOKINGS COUNTY, SD. POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE REGRESSED ON THE PROPORTION OF THE LANDSCAPE DEDICATED TO ROW CROPS, GRASS AND PASTURE, FORAGE CROPS, SMALL GRAINS, AND AQUATIC HABITATS USING VARIANCE COMPONENTS MODELING.

CONSERV.,"POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES EXHIBIT VARIABLE RESPONSES TO CHANGING LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION. A GENERAL EXPECTATION IS THAT A DECREASING COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS NEGATIVELY AFFECTS POLLINATOR REPRODUCTION, POPULATION SIZE AND POLLINATION SERVICES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND FUNCTIONING. IN 20 AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE PLOTS THE SIZE OF AN AVERAGE DUTCH FARM, WE STUDIED HOW CHANGING LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY AFFECTED WILD BEE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND REPRODUCTION. TO MEASURE POLLINATION, WE PLACED POTTED STRAWBERRY PLANTS AS PHYTOMETERS IN LANDSCAPES. LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY WAS CHARACTERIZED AS THE AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS. IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATED FLORAL RESOURCE ABUNDANCE IN EACH LANDSCAPE PLOT. WE EXPECTED THAT I) BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, REPRODUCTION AND POLLINATION WOULD BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO AREA OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS AND FLOWER ABUNDANCE, AND THAT II) SPECIES RICHNESS AND REPRODUCTION WOULD BE POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLLINATION. AN INCREASE IN SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN LANDSCAPES INCREASED BOTH THE ABUNDANCE OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES COLONIZING TRAP NESTS, AND THE GROWTH RATES OF EXPERIMENTAL BOMBUS TERRESTRIS L. COLONIES, BUT NOT THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF WILD BEES MEASURED BY PAN TRAPS. THERE WAS ONLY A TENDENCY FOR HIGHER POLLINATION LEVELS OF STRAWBERRY PLANTS WITH HIGHER COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS. THERE WAS NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPECIES RICHNESS AND BEE REPRODUCTION IN A LANDSCAPE AND THE POLLINATION SERVICES. ESTIMATED FLOWER ABUNDANCE IN LANDSCAPE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BUMBLEBEE COLONY GROWTH ONLY AND NOT ON THE OTHER VARIABLES. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, BY IMPROVING HABITAT QUALITY ON THEIR FARMS THROUGH ESTABLISHING MORE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS OR ENHANCING THE FLOWER AVAILABILITY IN SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS, FARMERS CAN PROMOTE REPRODUCTION OF A NUMBER OF FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT BEE SPECIES AND THE POLLINATION SERVICES THEY PROVIDE.

ALTERNATIVELY, RESEARCHERS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL' EXPERIMENTS, WHERE EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL IS EXERCISED BY CAREFUL SITE SELECTION. RECENT ADVANCES IN DEVELOPING PROTOCOLS FOR DESIGNING THESE PSEUDO-EXPERIMENTS' COMMONLY DO NOT CONSIDER THE SELECTION OF THE FOCAL REGION AND PREDICTOR VARIABLES ARE USUALLY RESTRICTED TO TWO. HERE, WE ADVANCE THIS TYPE OF SITE SELECTION PROTOCOL TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF MULTIPLE LANDSCAPE SCALE FACTORS ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ACROSS MULTIPLE REGIONS. USING DATASETS OF GEOGRAPHIC AND ECOLOGICAL VARIABLES WITH NATIONAL COVERAGE, WE APPLIED A NOVEL HIERARCHICAL COMPUTATION APPROACH TO SELECT STUDY SITES THAT CONTRAST AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN FOUR KEY VARIABLES, WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MAINTAIN REGIONAL COMPARABILITY AND NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVENESS. THERE WERE THREE MAIN STEPS TO THE PROTOCOL: (I) SELECTION OF SIX 100X100KM(2) REGIONS THAT COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED LAND COVER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATIONAL LAND AVERAGE, (II) MAPPING OF POTENTIAL SITES INTO A MULTIVARIATE SPACE WITH AXES REPRESENTING FOUR KEY FACTORS POTENTIALLY INFLUENCING INSECT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, AND (III) APPLYING A SELECTION ALGORITHM WHICH MAXIMIZED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FOUR KEY VARIABLES, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR A SET OF EXTERNAL CONSTRAINTS. VALIDATION DATA FOR THE SITE SELECTION METRICS WERE RECORDED ALONGSIDE THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON POLLINATOR POPULATIONS DURING TWO FIELD CAMPAIGNS. WHILE THE ACCURACY OF THE METRIC ESTIMATES VARIED, THE SITE SELECTION SUCCEEDED IN OBJECTIVELY IDENTIFYING FIELD SITES THAT DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY IN VALUES FOR EACH OF THE FOUR KEY VARIABLES.

MAKINO TT;OHASHI K,MAKINO TT,HONEST SIGNALS TO MAINTAIN A LONG-LASTING RELATIONSHIP: FLORAL COLOUR CHANGE PREVENTS PLANT-LEVEL AVOIDANCE BY EXPERIENCED POLLINATORS,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"1. HONEST SIGNALS PREVAIL WHEN THOSE SIGNALS MANIPULATE RECEIVERS TO BENEFIT THE SENDERS MORE THAN DECEPTIVE SIGNALS DO. FLORAL COLOUR CHANGE (FCC), REPORTED IN HUNDREDS OF SPECIES, IS A WELL-KNOWN EXAMPLE OF HONEST SIGNALLING IN PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. IT OCCURS IN FULLY TURGID FLOWERS, AND USUALLY CORRELATES WITH A CESSATION OF REWARD PRODUCTION IN INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS. THIS TRAIT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A PLANT STRATEGY THAT ENHANCES DISTANT POLLINATOR ATTRACTION BY EXTENDED DISPLAYS, WHILE MINIMIZING VISITS TO NON-REPRODUCTIVE FLOWERS BY HONEST COLOUR SIGNALS. 2. HERE, WE PROPOSE AN ADDITIONAL, OVERLOOKED BENEFIT OF FCC, WHICH EMERGES WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SPATIAL LEARNING ABILITY OF POLLINATORS TO AVOID UNPROFITABLE PLANTS. IF A PLANT RETAINS REWARDLESS FLOWERS WITHOUT FCC, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR POLLINATORS TO VISUALLY LOCATE THE REWARDING FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH THE ENHANCED DISPLAY INITIALLY ATTRACTS MORE POLLINATORS, ITS LOW PROFITABILITY FOR FORAGING MAY CAUSE PLANT-LEVEL AVOIDANCE BY THEM. THE AVOIDANCE RESULTING FROM REWARDLESS FLOWER RETENTION MAY BE PREVENTED BY FCC BECAUSE IT HELPS POLLINATORS TO FIND REWARDING FLOWERS. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE OBSERVED THE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES OF BUMBLEBEES FORAGING IN AN ARRAY OF ARTIFICIAL PLANTS. 3. WE FOUND THAT REWARDLESS FLOWERS WITHOUT FCC COULD INITIALLY ATTRACT BEES BY INCREASING THE PLANT'S DISPLAY SIZE, BUT THEIR LACK OF REWARD RESULTED IN PLANT-LEVEL AVOIDANCE BY THOSE BEES WITH SPATIAL MEMORIES. THE FCC IN REWARDLESS FLOWERS, IN CONTRAST, ENCOURAGED BEES TO RETURN BY HELPING THEM TO FIND REWARDS ON PLANTS. CONSEQUENTLY, HONEST PLANTS WITH FCC RECEIVED MORE VISITS THAN THOSE DISHONEST PLANTS THAT DID NOT DISPLAY COLOUR CHANGE. 4. FLORAL COLOUR CHANGE THUS CAN PREVENT PLANT-LEVEL AVOIDANCE BY POLLINATORS THAT USE SPATIAL MEMORY WHEN CHOOSING PLANTS. THE SPATIAL LEARNING ABILITY OF POLLINATORS MAY, THEREFORE, BE ONE OF THE KEYS TO UNDERSTANDING WHY BOTH COLOUR-CHANGING AND NON-COLOUR-CHANGING PLANT SPECIES OCCUR AMONG ANGIOSPERMS.",BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES; FLORAL TRAITS; PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTION; SPATIAL LEARNING,BUMBLE BEES; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; BOMBUS-TERRESTRIS; SPATIAL MEMORY; PREFERENCES; RESPONSES; DISPLAY; CONSTRAINTS; HYMENOPTERA; ATTRACTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"MAKINO, TT (REPRINT AUTHOR), YAMAGATA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FAC SCI, 1-4-12 KOJIRAKAWA, YAMAGATA 9908560, JAPAN.;MAKINO, TAKASHI T., YAMAGATA UNIV, DEPT BIOL, FAC SCI, 1-4-12 KOJIRAKAWA, YAMAGATA 9908560, JAPAN.;OHASHI, KAZUHARU, UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058572, JAPAN.",10.1111/1365-2435.12802,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"KAKENHIMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)JAPAN SOCIETY FOR THE PROMOTION OF SCIENCEGRANTS-IN-AID FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (KAKENHI) [JP19770011, JP26840139]; [18.3737]","WE THANK J.

THROUGH A SERIES OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER DAMAGE FROM FOLIAR HERBIVORES LEADS TO A REDUCTION IN FRUIT SET, INFLUENCES FLORAL VISITATION, OR ALTERS FLORAL TRAITS THAT MAY INFLUENCE POLLINATOR PREFERENCE OR POLLINATOR EFFICIENCY. FOLIAR HERBIVORY BY A GENERALIST GRASSHOPPER LED TO REDUCED FRUIT SET IN BRANCHES THAT WERE DIRECTLY DAMAGED AS WELL AS IN ADJACENT UNDAMAGED BRANCHES ON THE SAME PLANT. FURTHERMORE, HERBIVORY RESULTED IN REDUCED FLORAL VISITATION FROM TWO COMMON HUMMINGBIRD SPECIES AND TWO BEE SPECIES. AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BEHIND REDUCED FLORAL VISITATION IN INDUCED PLANTS SHOWED THAT FOLIAR HERBIVORE DAMAGE RESULTED IN SHORTER STYLES AND LOWER NECTAR VOLUMES.

GENET.,"FRAGMENTATION OF HABITAT CAN DECREASE RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND RESTRICT MOVEMENT AMONG GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. PERSISTENCE IN FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES DEPENDS ON THE MAINTENANCE OF CONNECTIVITY AMONG POPULATIONS, WITHOUT WHICH GENETIC DIVERSITY MAY DECREASE AND LEAD TO POPULATION DECLINES. BEES ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND PATTERNS OF DISPERSAL FOR NATIVE BEES LIVING IN FRAGMENTED AREAS. I USED POPULATION GENETIC TECHNIQUES TO CHARACTERIZE PATTERNS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY AND DISPERSAL FOR THE ORCHID BEE EUGLOSSA IMPERIALIS WITHIN AND AMONG FOREST FRAGMENTS IN SOUTHERN COSTA RICA, IN WHICH THE FURTHEST TWO FRAGMENTS WERE 226 KM FROM ONE ANOTHER. IN ADDITION, I COMPARED RESULTS OF POPULATION GENETIC ANALYSES CONDUCTED WITH ALL BEES SAMPLED, AND RESULTS FROM ANALYSES CONDUCTED WITH A REDUCED DATASET CONTAINING ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL PER FULL SIBLING FAMILY FROM EACH SITE. FOR BOTH DATASETS GENETIC DIVERSITY WAS LOW WITHIN FOREST FRAGMENTS, WITH EXPECTED HETEROZYGOSITY AVERAGING 0.28 FOR THE FULL DATASET AND 0.29 FOR THE DATASET CONTAINING ONLY ONE FULL SIBLING PER SITE. I FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT DEFORESTED AREAS RESTRICTED DISPERSAL, PAIRWISE ESTIMATES OF GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG FOREST FRAGMENTS AVERAGED 0.01 FOR THE FULL DATASET, AND 0 FOR THE DATASET CONTAINING ONLY ONE FULL SIBLING PER SITE. GENETIC DISTANCE AMONG SITES WITHIN FOREST FRAGMENTS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED TO GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE FOR THE FULL DATASET, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION FOR THE DATASET THAT CONTAINED ONLY ONE INDIVIDUAL FROM EACH FULL SIBLING FAMILY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FAMILY STRUCTURE CAN DRIVE RESULTS OF ANALYSES OF GENETIC STRUCTURE, ALTHOUGH REDUCTIONS IN SAMPLE SIZES FOLLOWING REMOVAL OF FULL SIBLINGS MAY HAVE REDUCED POWER TO DETECT GENETIC STRUCTURE. DESPITE NO EVIDENCE FOR RESTRICTED DISPERSAL, THE LOW GENETIC DIVERSITY FOUND SUGGESTS THAT E.

ARTIFICIAL LIGHT INTENSITY DID NOT AFFECT THE PARASITOID'S PROBABILITY OF WALKING AS OPPOSED TO WAVELENGTH, AND ACTIVITY DEPENDED ON THE SEX OF INDIVIDUALS. MALES WERE MORE ACTIVE THAN FEMALES UNDER ALL MONOCHROMATIC WAVELENGTH SPECTRA TESTED.

GALLAGHER MK;CAMPBELL DR,GALLAGHER MK,SHIFTS IN WATER AVAILABILITY MEDIATE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS,NEW PHYTOLOGIST,NEW PHYTOL.,"ALTERED PRECIPITATION PATTERNS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTHROPOGENIC CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE MANY EFFECTS ON PLANTS AND INSECT POLLINATORS, BUT IT IS UNKNOWN IF EFFECTS ON POLLINATION ARE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN WATER AVAILABILITY. WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IMPACTS OF CLIMATE ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS OPERATE THROUGH CHANGES IN WATER AVAILABILITY, AND SPECIFICALLY THAT SUCH EFFECTS OCCUR THROUGH ALTERATION OF FLORAL ATTRACTANTS. WE MANIPULATED WATER AVAILABILITY IN TWO NATURALLY OCCURRING MERTENSIA CILIATA (BORAGINACEAE) POPULATIONS USING WATER ADDITION, WATER REDUCTION AND CONTROL PLOTS AND MEASURED EFFECTS ON VEGETATIVE AND FLORAL TRAITS, POLLINATOR VISITATION AND SEED SET. WHILE MOST FLORAL TRAIT VALUES, INCLUDING COROLLA SIZE AND NECTAR, INCREASED LINEARLY WITH INCREASING WATER AVAILABILITY, IN THIS BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED SPECIES, POLLINATOR VISITATION PEAKED AT INTERMEDIATE WATER LEVELS. VISITATION ALSO PEAKED AT AN INTERMEDIATE COROLLA LENGTH, WHILE ITS RELATIONSHIP TO COROLLA WIDTH VARIED ACROSS SITES. SEED SET, HOWEVER, INCREASED LINEARLY WITH WATER. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL FOR CHANGES IN WATER AVAILABILITY TO IMPACT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS THROUGH POLLINATOR RESPONSES TO DIFFERENCES IN FLORAL ATTRACTANTS, AND THAT THE EFFECTS OF WATER ON POLLINATOR VISITATION CAN BE NONLINEAR.

LINNEAN SOC.,"COEVOLUTION OF EFFICIENT POLLINATORS SUCH AS BOMBUS SPECIES (BUMBLEBEES) WITH THE FLOWERS THEY POLLINATE COULD MAKE THEM SPATIALLY DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER, THUS AFFECTING THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS AND ABILITIES TO COLONIZE NEW AREAS. AS BOMBUS SPECIES SHOW A PREFERENCE FOR BLUE-PURPLE FLOWERS, AREAS WITH A HIGH DIVERSITY OF TBOMBUS SPECIES SHOULD CORRELATE WITH A HIGHER DIVERSITY OF PLANTS WITH BLUE-PURPLE FLOWERS. TO INVESTIGATE THESE RELATIONSHIPS, WE MAPPED FLOWER COLOUR DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE ARCTIC AND TESTED FOR CORRELATIONS WITH THE RICHNESS OF BOMBUS SPECIES AND GLACIATION HISTORY. REGIONAL OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES IN THE ARCTIC WERE OBTAINED FROM THE PANARCTIC FLORA CHECKLIST, AND FLOWER COLOUR INFORMATION FOR 526 SPECIES WAS RETRIEVED FROM THE LITERATURE, COVERING ON AVERAGE OF 58\% OF EACH REGIONAL FLORA. THE NUMBER OF BOMBUS SPECIES WITHIN EACH FLORISTIC REGION WAS APPROXIMATED FROM PUBLISHED DISTRIBUTION MAPS. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE PREDICTION THAT BOMBUS SPECIES HAVE PREFERENCE FOR BLUE-PURPLE FLOWER COLOUR AND THAT (RE)COLONIZATION OF SPECIES WITH BLUE-PURPLE FLOWERS IN HEAVILY GLACIATED AREAS IS PARTLY CONSTRAINED BY POLLINATOR DEFICIENCY. PLANT SPECIES WITH WHITE FLOWERS SHOWED AN OPPOSITE TREND IN DISTRIBUTION TO SPECIES WITH BLUE-PURPLE FLOWERS. LESS POLLINATOR DEPENDENCY DUE TO ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTION MODES MAY EXPLAIN THE HIGH ABUNDANCE OF WHITE-COLOURED FLOWERS IN ARCTIC REGIONS, AS PIGMENT PRODUCTION WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF POLLINATION TO OFFSET THE ENERGY COST MAY REDUCE FITNESS UNDER MARGINAL ARCTIC CONDITIONS.",ARCTIC FLORA; BOMBUS; COLONIZATION; FLOWER COLOUR; GLACIATION; POLLINATION; REFUGIA,COLOR-VISION; FLORAL COLOR; NEW-ZEALAND; INSECT POLLINATION; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNITIES; PREFERENCES; DIVERSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"EIDESEN, PB (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CTR SVALBARD, POB 156, N-9171 LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY.;EIDESEN, PERNILLE B., LITTLE, LORNA, MUELLER, EIKE, UNIV CTR SVALBARD, POB 156, N-9171 LONGYEARBYEN, NORWAY.;LITTLE, LORNA, DICKINSON, KATHARINE J.

WE ASSESSED (A) VARIANCE IN TENT CAPTURE RATES OVER TIME, (B) THE EFFECTS OF SITE CHARACTERISTICS ON PROPORTION OF TENTS CAPTURING BEES, AND (C) THE EFFECT OF SOIL CHARACTERISTICS ON NEST SITE CHOICE. METHODS: EMERGENCE TENTS WERE PLACED OUT FOR ONE WEEK IN MAY, JUNE, AND AUGUST AND CHECKED DAILY. SOIL, BEE, AND FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: ACROSS ALL SITES AND MONTHS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF TENTS CAPTURING BEES WAS LESS THAN 20\% DURING ONE WEEK OF SAMPLING, BUT THIS VARIED BETWEEN SITES. TENT CAPTURES DECREASED AFTER 48 H DEPLOYMENT, BUT ACCUMULATION DIFFERED SEASONALLY, WITH SLOWER ACCUMULATION OF TOTAL BEES CAUGHT IN MAY THAN IN JUNE OR AUGUST. ALTHOUGH CAPTURE RATES WERE NOT AFFECTED BY BEE OR FLORAL ABUNDANCE, SOIL MOISTURE BENEATH A TENT INFLUENCED WHERE BEES WERE CAPTURED. DISCUSSION: EFFECTIVE USE OF EMERGENCE TENTS MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTING THE LENGTH OF DEPLOYMENT DEPENDING ON SEASON AND WILL REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF 48 H INSTALLATION TO HELP MAXIMIZE EFFICACY.

THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EACH PROCESS, HOWEVER, VARY ACCORDING TO THE SCALE AND HOW STRONGLY PLANTS SHARE THEIR POLLINATORS, AND POSSIBLY IN RELATION TO THE POLLINATOR GROUPS CONSIDERED. WE HERE INVESTIGATED THE ASSEMBLY OF THREE ATLANTIC FOREST HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED PLANT COMMUNITIES ACROSS SPACE (AMONG ALL SPECIES IN THE COMMUNITIES) AND TIME, I.E. YEARLY FLOWERING PHENOLOGY (BETWEEN PAIRS OF CO-FLOWERING SPECIES), BASED ON THE PAIRWISE DISTANCES OF MULTIPLE FLORAL TRAITS (COROLLA LENGTH, ANTHER AND STIGMA HEIGHT, COLOUR AND NECTAR). BECAUSE TROPICAL HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED PLANTS ARE OFTEN SUBDIVIDED IN TWO POLLINATION NICHES (HERMITS VERSUS NON-HERMITS), WE ALSO ANALYZED THESE GROUPS SEPARATELY. WE FOUND THAT TRAIT STRUCTURE ACROSS SPACE WAS CLUSTERED FOR SOME FLORAL TRAITS, SUGGESTING BIOTIC FILTERING AND FACILITATION. ALL FLORAL TRAITS HAD WEAK PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL, INDICATING THAT CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES WERE NOT MORE SIMILAR THAN DISTANTLY RELATED SPECIES. MOREOVER, FLORAL TRAITS WERE RANDOMLY STRUCTURED ALONG THE PHENOLOGY WHEN ANALYZING ALL PLANTS TOGETHER. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE FOUND SIMILAR COROLLA LENGTH BUT DIVERGENT ANTHER HEIGHT IN CO-FLOWERING PAIRS WITHIN THE SAME POLLINATION NICHE. THUS, PLANTS MAY BENEFIT FROM FLOWERING TOGETHER AND AVOID COMPETITION THROUGH FINE ADJUSTMENTS IN REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT CLEAR SIGNALS OF COMPETITION AND FACILITATION AMONG PLANTS ARE ONLY APPARENT WHEN SPECIES STRONGLY SHARE THEIR POLLINATORS AND DEPENDING ON THE TRAITS THAT ARE CONSIDERED.

MEX. BIODIVERS.,"DISTYLOUS SPECIES EXHIBIT A RECIPROCAL STIGMA AND ANTHER HEIGHTS OF FLORAL MORPHS. THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF STIGMA-ANTHER POLYMORPHISM IS TO ENHANCE POLLEN TRANSFER BETWEEN MORPHS. THE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE POLLINATOR GUILD AND THE PATTERN OF POLLEN DEPOSITION IN PALICOUREA PADIFOLIA (RUBIACEAE) WERE STUDIED. THIRTY FOCAL PLANTS PER MORPH WERE USED TO STUDY POLLEN LOADS AND BEHAVIOR OF FLORAL VISITORS AT THE BEGGING, BLOSSOM, AND ENDING OF FLOWERING SEASON. A VARIABLE PATTERN OF POLLEN LOADS BY CHANGES IN FLORAL VISITOR GUILD AND BEHAVIOR OVER TIME WAS OBSERVED. AT THE BEGINNING AND BLOSSOM OF FLOWERING SEASON, THE BUTTERFLIES DEPOSITED A HIGH PROPORTION OF ILLEGITIMATE POLLEN ON PIN (0.19-0.32), WHEREAS BEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS DEPOSITED A HIGH PROPORTION OF LEGITIMATE POLLEN ON THRUM (0.55-0.67).

INSECT CONSERV.,"PAVED ROADWAYS, SPANNING 6.6 MILLION KILOMETRES ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES, ARE OFTEN BORDERED BY NATURAL OR RESTORED HABITATS AND COULD PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POLLINATOR CONSERVATION. BECAUSE INSECTS ARE FREQUENTLY KILLED BY AUTO TRAFFIC, ROADSIDE HABITATS MAY BE ECOLOGICAL TRAPS THAT KILL MORE POLLINATORS THAN THEY PRODUCE. HERE WE COMPARE INSECT TRAFFIC MORTALITY WHEN ROADSIDES ARE BORDERED BY WOODLOTS, MEADOWS, OR LAWNS. WE ALSO COMPARE STUDY SITES WITH AND WITHOUT RESTORED MEDIANS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF CREATING HABITAT THAT CAN ONLY BE ACCESSED BY CROSSING TRAFFIC. WE CONFINED OUR STUDY TO HIGH SPEED ROADS (70-90 KM H(-1)) WITH HEAVY TRAFFIC VOLUME. BOTH HABITAT TYPE AND THE PRESENCE OF A VEGETATED MEDIAN AFFECT VEHICLE STRIKES FATAL TO INSECTS. INSECT MORTALITY IN GENERAL, AND ITS EFFECT ON BEES AND BUTTERFLIES IN PARTICULAR, WAS CONSISTENTLY LOWER WHEN ROADS WERE BORDERED BY WOODLOTS THAN WHEN THEY WERE BORDERED BY LAWN OR MEADOWS. WHICH ROADSIDE HABITATS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGHEST INSECT MORTALITY DEPENDED ON THE TAXON IN QUESTION AND THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF A VEGETATED MEDIAN. BUTTERFLY AND DRAGONFLY MORTALITY WAS HIGHEST ON ROADS WITH MEADOW MEDIANS, WHILE BEE MORTALITY WAS HIGHEST ON ROADSIDES WITH LAWN MEDIANS. ACROSS MOST SITE COMPARISONS, VEGETATED MEDIANS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED FATAL INSECT-VEHICLE STRIKES. REGARDLESS OF THE HABITAT BORDERING ROADSIDES, INSECT MORTALITY WAS UNACCEPTABLY HIGH FOR AREAS BEING CONSIDERED FOR CONSERVATION.

ECOL.,"1. IN FLOWERS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS, POLLEN IS NOT FREELY ACCESSIBLE AND LEGITIMATE ACCESS IS RESTRICTED TO BEES CAPABLE OF VIBRATING THE ANTHERS. DESPITE THE PROTECTION OF POLLEN PROVIDED BY PORICIDAL ANTHERS, NUMEROUS ILLEGITIMATE, NON-BUZZ-POLLINATING FLOWER VISITORS ROB POLLEN. 2. WE AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF FLORAL VISITORS AND ILLEGITIMATE INTERACTIONS ON THE NETWORK STRUCTURE TO DISENTANGLE THE FLOWER VISITOR NETWORK INTO ITS MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC COMPONENTS. 3. WE DELIMITED THREE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF BEES BASED ON THEIR POLLEN COLLECTION BEHAVIOUR IN PORICIDAL FLOWERS: LARGE BEES THAT VIBRATE ENTIRE FLOWERS IN A SINGLE BUZZING POSITION (FLOWER BUZZING), BEES VIBRATING SINGLE ANTHERS IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS (ANTHER BUZZING) AND NON-VIBRATING FLOWER-DAMAGING OR GLEANING BEES (NON-BUZZING). MOREOVER, WE CHARACTERIZED LEGITIMATE AND ILLEGITIMATE INTERACTIONS OF CO-OCCURRING AND CO-FLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR FLOWER VISITORS BASED ON THE STIGMA CONTACT DURING A VISIT. SINCE WE INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE TYPE OF INTERACTION WITH BEE-PLANT SPECIES COMBINATIONS, WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE THE BEHAVIOURAL VARIATIONS OF EACH BEE SPECIES ACROSS DIFFERENT FLOWERS. 4. THE NETWORKS WERE MODULAR, WITH STRONGER INTERACTIONS WITHIN SUBSETS OF SPECIES THAN AMONG THE SUBSETS. ALL MODULES INCLUDED A COMBINATION OF FLOWER-, ANTHER- AND NON-BUZZING BEES, AND MUTUALISTIC AND ANTAGONISTIC NETWORKS WERE INTERMINGLED. SEVEN BEE SPECIES SHIFTED THEIR ROLES ACROSS PLANT SPECIES. SPECIALIZATION IN THE SUBSET OF INTERACTIONS WITH POLLINATORS WAS HIGHER THAN THE OVERALL VISITATION NETWORK. FLOWER-BUZZING BEES WERE MORE SPECIALIZED THAN ANTHER-BUZZING AND NON-BUZZING BEES, WHICH USED VIRTUALLY ALL PORICIDAL FLOWERS SIMILARLY. 5. ALTHOUGH PLANTS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS SHARED A SPECIALIZED MECHANISM OF POLLEN RELEASE, THEIR POLLINATORS WERE HIGHLY DISSIMILAR AND FORMED COMPARTMENTS OF INTERACTING SPECIES. THE INTERACTION-LEVEL APPROACH TAKEN IN OUR STUDY CONFERS A HIGH SPECIFICITY TO THE POLLINATOR NETWORK, LEADING TO A MORE COMPLEX AND REALISTIC PICTURE OF MUTUALISTIC WEBS VERSUS ITS EMBEDDED FLORIVORY, WHICH ARE OTHERWISE CONFOUNDED IN POOLED NETWORKS ACROSS FLOWER VISITORS.",BEE-PLANT INTERACTIONS; BUZZ POLLINATION; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS,PLANT-HUMMINGBIRD NETWORK; BUZZ-POLLINATION; MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS; POLLEN AVAILABILITY; BREEDING SYSTEM; BEE FLOWERS; MELASTOMATACEAE; COMPETITION; EVOLUTION; SPECIALIZATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"SCHLINDWEIN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS, DEPT BOT, BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.;MESQUITA-NETO, JOSE N., SCHLINDWEIN, CLEMENS, UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS, DEPT BOT, BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.;MESQUITA-NETO, JOSE N., UNIV CATOLICA MAULE, FAC CIENCIAS BASICAS, DEPT CIENCIAS BIOL \& QUIM, LAB ECOL ABEJAS, TALCA, CHILE.;BLUETHGEN, NICO, TECH UNIV DARMSTADT, DEPT BIOL, ECOL NETWORKS, DARMSTADT, GERMANY.",10.1111/1365-2435.13204,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,RUFFORD FOUNDATION [17393-1]; FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE MINAS GERAISMINAS GERAIS STATE RESEARCH FOUNDATION (FAPEMIG) [APQ-01707-14]; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICONATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ) [PQ 312831/2013-7]; INSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVACAO DA BIODIVERSIDADE; INSTITUTO ESTADUAL DE FLORESTAS DE MINAS GERAIS [120/2014]; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIORCAPES,"RUFFORD FOUNDATION, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 17393-1; FUNDACAO DE AMPARO A PESQUISA DO ESTADO DE MINAS GERAIS, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: APQ-01707-14; CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTIFICO E TECNOLOGICO, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: PQ 312831/2013-7; INSTITUTO CHICO MENDES DE CONSERVACAO DA BIODIVERSIDADE AND INSTITUTO ESTADUAL DE FLORESTAS DE MINAS GERAIS, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 120/2014; COORDENACAO DE APERFEICOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NIVEL SUPERIOR",0269-8463,10,2321-2332,WILEY,32,2018,ISI000446322200006,75,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,16,ECOLOGY,SCHLINDWGMAIL.COM,GV7PX,"SCHLINDWEIN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS, DEPT BOT, BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL",ISI,none,UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS;UNIV CATOLICA MAULE;TECH UNIV DARMSTADT,UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS,NA,"MESQUITA-NETO JN, 2018, FUNCT ECOL","MESQUITA-NETO JN, 2018, FUNCT ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

THIS DILEMMA IS RESOLVED BY SPECIALIZATION OF ANTHERS (I.E., HETERANTHERY): FEEDING ANTHERS THAT FEED POLLINATORS AND POLLINATING ANTHERS FOR FERTILIZATION. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF FLORAL VOLATILES DIFFERS BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF ANTHER AND INFLUENCES POLLINATION PREFERENCE FOR FEEDING ANTHERS. WE USED SOLANUM ROSTRATUM AS A STUDY MODEL BECAUSE ITS HETERANTHEROUS FLOWERS PRODUCE A FLORAL SCENT THAT SUGGESTS A CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THEIR POLLINATORS. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE TWO TYPES OF ANTHER AND TO INVESTIGATE HOW THEY INFLUENCE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF POLLINATORS. TO CHARACTERIZE THIS COMPOSITION, WE USED SOLID PHASE MICROEXTRACTION AND HEXANE EXTRACTION FOLLOWED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY. WE REGISTERED 12 VOLATILE COMPOUNDS IN S. ROSTRATUM FLORAL EXTRACTS, MAINLY AROMATIC AND SESQUITERPENE COMPOUNDS. THE PROPORTION OF THESE COMPOUNDS DIFFERED BETWEEN FEEDING AND POLLINATING ANTHERS. SOME OF THESE COMPOUNDS WERE PROBABLY EMITTED BY OSMOPHORES LOCATED IN BOTH ANTHER TYPES. ALSO, WE USED ELECTROANTENNOGRAPHY TO INVESTIGATE MELIPONA SOLANI ANTENNAL RESPONSE TO FLORAL VOLATILES. THE M. SOLANI ANTENNAE ARE RECEPTIVE TO THE HIGHEST FLORAL EXTRACT DOSE TESTED. FINALLY, WE CONDUCTED TWO BEHAVIOURAL BIOASSAYS TO TEST BEE ATTRACTION FOR EACH TYPE OF FLORAL EXTRACT: A) MULTIPLE-CHOICE IN A FEEDING ARENA USING M.

FOCAL OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE OF ANTHESIS, POLLEN AVAILABILITY, STIGMA RECEPTIVITY, NECTAR PRODUCTION, AND THE PRESENCE OF OSMOPHORES AND UV-REFLECTIVE PIGMENTS FOR THE SPECIES. FLORAL VISITORS WERE ALSO OBSERVED AND CLASSIFIED BASED ON THE TIMING AND FREQUENCY OF THEIR VISITS AND THEIR FORAGING BEHAVIOR. THE BREEDING SYSTEM WAS INFERRED FROM THE POLLEN-OVULE RATIO AND POLLEN TUBE GROWTH AFTER POLLINATION TREATMENTS. PELTOGYNE CHRYSOPIS WAS FOUND TO BE MELITTOPHILOUS, WITH ANTHESIS OCCURRING FROM 02H00MIN TO 05H00MIN, AND PROTOGYNOUS AND XENOGAMOUS, WITH FLOWER SCENT EMISSION AND POLLEN RELEASE BEFORE SUNRISE.

IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, HOWEVER, THIS ATTRACTION TOWARDS CONSPECIFICS MAY LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL FORAGING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE POLLINATORS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN A FASTER RATE OF NECTAR DEPLETION IN THE FLOWER. WE TESTED THE CAPACITY OF BEES TO LEARN TO AVOID FLOWERS OCCUPIED BY CONSPECIFICS WHEN THEY OFFERED A LOWER REWARD THAN UNOCCUPIED SIMILAR FLOWERS. BUMBLEBEES WERE ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN POORLY AND HIGHLY REWARDING FLOWERS BY USING THE PRESENCE OF A NONSOCIAL CUE ( A WOODEN RECTANGULAR WHITE BLOCK). WHEN POORLY REWARDING FLOWERS WERE INDICATED BY SOCIAL CUES ( MODEL BEES), HOWEVER, BEES DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE TWO FLOWER TYPES EXCEPT WHEN AN ADDITIONAL CUE WAS PROVIDED ( FLOWER COLOUR). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT BUMBLEBEES ATTACH PARTICULAR MEANING TO CONSPECIFIC PRESENCE ON FLOWERS, EVEN WHEN THIS COULD LEAD TO SUBOPTIMAL FORAGING PERFORMANCE.

WE ESTABLISHED GARDEN PLOTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PLANT TYPE (NATIVE VS. EXOTIC) AND WEED MAINTENANCE (LOW OR HIGH) INFLUENCE ADULT BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, AND THE ABUNDANCE AND SURVIVAL OF IMMATURE STAGES OF FOUR SPECIES (MONARCH, QUEEN, BLACK SWALLOWTAIL, AND GULF FRITILLARY). TO ASSESS HOW PREDATOR ACTIVITY AND MORTALITY OF IMMATURE STAGES MIGHT DIFFER INSIDE GARDENS COMPARED TO OTHER SUITABLE HABITAT PATCHES, WE COMPARED CATERPILLAR SURVIVAL ON SENTINEL HOST PLANTS PLACED WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF PLOTS. THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF ADULT BUTTERFLIES (ALL TAXA) INCREASED WITH THE NUMBER OF FLOWERING PLANTS PER PLOT, BUT DID NOT DEPEND ON PLANT TYPE OR WEEDING TREATMENT. EXOTIC PLOTS HAD GREATER ADULT MONARCH AND GULF FRITILLARY ABUNDANCES, GREATER MONARCH AND QUEEN EGG COUNTS, AND LOWER BLACK SWALLOWTAIL CATERPILLAR COUNTS RELATIVE TO NATIVE PLOTS.

THIS SPECIES IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBSPECIES BASED ON DIFFERENCE IN THE YELLOW TERGAL STRIPES, WHICH ARE CONTINUOUS IN M. Q. QUADRIFASCIATA AND INTERRUPTED IN M. Q. ANTHIDIOIDES. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF EACH SUBSPECIES IS ALSO DISTINCT. M. Q. QUADRIFASCIATA IS FOUND IN COLDER REGIONS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES OF BRAZIL, WHEREAS M. Q.

TRILLO A;HERRERA JM;VILA M,TRILLO A,MANAGED BUMBLE BEES INCREASE FLOWER VISITATION BUT NOT FRUIT WEIGHT IN POLYTUNNEL STRAWBERRY CROPS,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,BASIC APPL. ECOL.,"ANIMAL-MEDIATED POLLINATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION AND QUALITY OF FRUITS AND SEEDS OF MANY CROPS CONSUMED BY HUMANS. HOWEVER, CROP POLLINATION SERVICES MIGHT BE COMPROMISED WHEN WILD POLLINATORS ARE SCARCE. MANAGED POLLINATORS ARE COMMONLY USED IN CROPS TO SUPPLEMENT SUCH SERVICES WITH THE ASSUMPTION THAT THEY WILL ENHANCE CROP YIELD. HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON THE SPATIOTEMPORAL POLLINATOR-DEPENDENCE OF CROPS IS STILL LIMITED. WE ASSESSED THE CONTRIBUTION OF COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEE COLONIES COMPARED TO THE AVAILABLE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY ON STRAWBERRY ('FORTUNA' VARIETY) FLOWER VISITATION AND STRAWBERRY QUALITY ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION (I.E. POLYTUNNEL BERRY CROP COVER). WE USED COLONIES OF BUMBLE BEES IN WINTER AND IN SPRING, I.E. WHEN FEW AND MOST WILD POLLINATORS ARE IN THEIR FLIGHT PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY. THE PLACEMENT OF COLONIES INCREASED VISITS OF BUMBLE BEES TO STRAWBERRY FLOWERS, ESPECIALLY IN WINTER. THE USE OF BUMBLE BEE COLONIES DID NOT AFFECT FLOWER VISITATION BY OTHER INSECTS, MAINLY HONEY BEES, HOVERFLIES AND OTHER DIPTERA. FLOWER VISITATION BY BOTH HONEY BEES AND WILD INSECTS DID NOT VARY BETWEEN SEASONS AND WAS UNRELATED TO THE LANDSCAPE GRADIENT OF BERRY CROP COVER. STRAWBERRIES WERE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY (I.E. WEIGHT) WHEN INSECT-MEDIATED POLLINATION WAS ALLOWED, AND THEIR QUALITY WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO WILD FLOWER VISITORS IN WINTER BUT NOT IN SPRING. HOWEVER, INCREASED VISITS TO STRAWBERRY FLOWERS BY MANAGED BUMBLE BEES AND HONEY BEES HAD NO EFFECT ON STRAWBERRY WEIGHT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE POLLINATION SERVICES PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY STRAWBERRY FRUITS ARE PROVIDED BY THE FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITY PRESENT IN THE STUDY REGION WITHOUT THE NEED TO USE MANAGED BUMBLE BEES.

THE ELEVATIONAL GRADIENT ALSO AFFECTS THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANTS. AS A RESULT, PLANTS MAY HAVE LOCALLY ADAPTED FLORAL TRAITS. HOWEVER, DETAILED ASSESSMENTS OF MULTIPLE FLORAL TRAITS ALONG ELEVATIONAL GRADIENTS ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED DESPITE THE TRAITS BEING IMPORTANT FOR PLANT SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. WE TESTED THE ASSOCIATION OF FLORAL TRAITS WITH POLLINATORS IN RESPONSE TO ELEVATION BY IDENTIFYING POLLINATORS AND MEASURING MORPHOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL FLORAL TRAITS AS WELL AS STUDYING THE BREEDING SYSTEMS OF TEN AGGREGATED RHODODENDRON SPECIES IN THE SIKKIM HIMALAYA. COROLLA LENGTH, NECTAR VOLUME AND DISTANCE BETWEEN STAMEN AND STIGMA SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITH ELEVATION. IN CONTRAST, NECTAR CONCENTRATIONS WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATION. BIRDS, BUMBLEBEES AND FLIES WERE THE THREE DOMINANT POLLINATOR GROUPS. BIRD VISITS SHOWED A STRONG NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION WITH ELEVATION WHILE VISITS BY BUMBLEBEES AND FLIES INCREASED WITH ELEVATION. SPECIES WITH LONGER COROLLAS AND HIGHER NECTAR VOLUMES SHOWED HIGHER RATES OF BIRD VISITS, WHILE BUMBLEBEES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIES THAT HAD HIGHER NECTAR CONCENTRATIONS.

NEARLY ALL RESEARCH ON MATE DIVERSITY IN FLOWERING PLANTS HAS FOCUSED ON THE NUMBER OF FATHERS SIRING SEEDS WITHIN A FRUIT OR ON A MATERNAL PLANT. YET AS HERMAPHRODITES, PLANTS CAN ALSO ACCRUE MATE DIVERSITY BY SIRING OFFSPRING ON SEVERAL POLLEN RECIPIENTS IN A POPULATION.

ECOL.,"FLORAL RESOURCES ARE KNOWN TO BE IMPORTANT IN REGULATING WILD POLLINATOR POPULATIONS AND ARE THEREFORE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT AND RESTORATION SCHEMES WHICH AIM TO SUPPORT POLLINATORS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE PHENOLOGY OF FLORAL RESOURCES IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED IN THESE SCHEMES - A FACTOR WHICH MAY BE LIMITING THEIR SUCCESS. OUR STUDY CHARACTERIZES AND QUANTIFIES THE PHENOLOGY OF NECTAR RESOURCES AT THE WHOLE-FARM SCALE ON REPLICATE FARMS IN SOUTHWESTERN UK THROUGHOUT THE FLOWERING SEASON. WE QUANTIFY THE CORRESPONDING NECTAR DEMANDS OF A SUBSET OF COMMON WILD POLLINATORS (BUMBLEBEES) TO COMPARE NECTAR SUPPLY AND POLLINATOR DEMAND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, THEREBY IDENTIFYING PERIODS OF SUPPLY-DEMAND DEFICIT. WE RECORD STRONG SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN FARMLAND NECTAR SUPPLIES, WITH TWO MAIN PEAKS OF NECTAR PRODUCTION (MAY AND JULY) AND A CONSIDERABLE ``JUNE GAP IN BETWEEN. MARCH AND AUGUST/SEPTEMBER ARE ALSO PERIODS OF LOW NECTAR AVAILABILITY. COMPARING THE PHENOLOGY OF NECTAR SUPPLY WITH THE PHENOLOGY OF BUMBLEBEE NECTAR DEMAND REVEALS ``HUNGER GAPS DURING MARCH AND MUCH OF AUGUST/SEPTEMBER WHEN SUPPLY IS UNLIKELY TO MEET DEMAND. PERMANENT PASTURE AND WOODLAND PRODUCED THE GREATEST SHARE OF FARMLAND NECTAR BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE AREA, HOWEVER, LINEAR FEATURES SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND FIELD MARGINS PROVIDED THE GREATEST NECTAR PER UNIT AREA. FIFTY PERCENT OF TOTAL NECTAR WAS SUPPLIED BY JUST THREE SPECIES (ALLIUM URSINUM, CIRSIUM ARVENSE AND TRIFOLIUM REPENS), BUT SOME LESS PRODUCTIVE SPECIES (E.G. HEDERA HELIX AND TARAXACUM AGG.) WERE IMPORTANT IN ENSURING PHENOLOGICAL CONTINUITY OF NECTAR SUPPLY. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. BY COMPARING THE PHENOLOGY OF FARMLAND NECTAR SUPPLY WITH THE PHENOLOGY OF POLLINATOR DEMAND, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TIMING OF NECTAR SUPPLY MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS TOTAL NECTAR PRODUCTION IN LIMITING FARMLAND POLLINATOR POPULATIONS. CONSIDERING PHENOLOGY IN THE DESIGN OF AGRI-ENVIRONMENT OR RESTORATION SCHEMES IS THEREFORE LIKELY TO IMPROVE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR POLLINATORS.

ECOL.,"POLLINATORS PROVIDE VITAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ACROSS CROPLANDS, YET SIMULTANEOUSLY THEY ARE INFLUENCED BY AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. NEVERTHELESS, ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOIL FERTILISERS AND POLLINATORS. THE AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT IN POLAND IN 2015, WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT FERTILISER REGIMES ON BUMBLEBEE FLOWER VISITATION RATE AND SEED YIELD IN CROPS OF THE FIELD BEAN (VICIA FABA L.). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF BUMBLEBEE VISITS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE CHOICE OF CROP FERTILISER. WE DETECTED DIFFERENCES IN BUMBLEBEE NUMBER BETWEEN FERTILISER TREATMENTS. THE ORGANIC FERTILISER (MANURE) TREATMENT RESULTED IN THE HIGHEST BUMBLEBEE VISITATION, ALTHOUGH THIS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM NP, NO FERTILISER AND NK TREATMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE OBSERVED LOWER NUMBERS OF BUMBLEBEES ON FIELD BEAN PLOTS TREATED WITH N, NPK, AND PK INORGANIC FERTILISERS. MANURE APPLICATION ALSO BOOSTED PLANT HEIGHT AND RESULTED IN A HIGH YIELD SIMILAR TO OTHER BALANCED FERTILISERS (NPK AND PK). THEREFORE, MANURE WAS THE ONLY FERTILISER THAT RESULTED IN A HIGH FIELD BEAN YIELD AND AT THE SAME TIME ATTRACTED THE MAIN POLLINATORS OF THE CROP. THUS, WE SUGGEST THAT APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES INFLUENCE BOTH PLANT GROWTH AND ALSO POLLINATION SERVICES AND WE SHOW THAT MODERN AGRICULTURE CAN MAKE COMPROMISE BETWEEN EFFECTIVENESS AND NATURE CONSERVATION.

IN 2018 THE EUROPEAN UNION PROHIBITED THE OUTDOOR USE OF THREE NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT POLLINATORS. A NEW PESTICIDE BY THE NAME OF SIVANTO WAS RECENTLY RELEASED BY BAYER AG. ITS ACTIVE INGREDIENT FLUPYRADIFURONE BINDS TO THE NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR (ACHR) IN THE HONEYBEE BRAIN, SIMILAR TO NEONICOTINOIDS. NEVERTHELESS, FLUPYRADIFURONE IS ASSUMED TO BE HARMLESS FOR HONEYBEES AND CAN EVEN BE APPLIED ON FLOWERING CROPS. SO FAR, ONLY LITTLE HAS BEEN KNOWN ABOUT SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF FLUPYRADIFURONE ON HONEYBEES. INTACT MOTOR FUNCTIONS ARE DECISIVE FOR NUMEROUS BEHAVIORS INCLUDING FORAGING AND DANCING. WE THEREFORE SELECTED A MOTOR ASSAY TO INVESTIGATE IN HOW FAR SUBLETHAL DOSES OF THIS PESTICIDE AFFECT BEHAVIOR IN YOUNG SUMMER AND LONG-LIVED WINTER HONEYBEES. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT FLUPYRADIFURONE (830 MU MOL/L) CAN EVOKE MOTOR DISABILITIES AND DISTURB NORMAL MOTOR BEHAVIOR AFTER A SINGLE ORAL ADMINISTRATION (1.2 MU G/BEE). THESE EFFECTS ARE STRONGER IN LONG-LIVED WINTER BEES THAN IN YOUNG SUMMER BEES. AFTER OFFERING AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF PESTICIDE (1.0-1.75 MU G) CONTINUOUSLY OVER 24H WITH FOOD THE OBSERVED EFFECTS ARE SLIGHTER. FOR COMPARISONS WE REPEATED OUR EXPERIMENTS WITH THE NEONICOTINOID IMIDACLOPRID.

SPECTRAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEASURED WITH DIFFERENT INSTRUMENTS TO SIMULATE BOTH THE SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HONEYBEE'S VISION. WE SHOW THE PRESENCE OF COLOR PATCHES PRODUCED BY ANGLE DEPENDENT EFFECTS ON THE PETALS AND THE CALYX OF VARIOUS SPECIES, HOWEVER, THE APPEARANCE OF THE ANGLE DEPENDENT COLOR PATCHES SIGNIFICANTLY VARIES WITH VIEWPOINT AND WOULD ONLY BE RESOLVED BY THE INSECT EYE AT CLOSE DISTANCES. BEHAVIOR EXPERIMENTS WITH HONEYBEES REVEALED THAT POLLINATORS DID NOT USE ANGLE DEPENDENT COLORS TO DRIVE BEHAVIOR WHEN PRESENTED WITH NOVEL FLOWER PRESENTATIONS. RESULTS SHOW THAT ANGLE DEPENDENT COLORS DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF A SIGNAL FOR PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNICATION SINCE THE INFORMATION TRANSMITTED BY THESE COLORS WOULD BE UNRELIABLE FOR POTENTIAL, FREE-FLYING POLLINATION VECTORS. WE THUS CLASSIFY ANGLE DEPENDENT COLORS PRODUCED BY MICRO-AND ULTRA-STRUCTURES AS BEING A CUE (A FEATURE WHICH HAS NOT EVOLVED FOR COMMUNICATION), AND OBSERVE NO EVIDENCE SUPPORTING CLAIMS OF THESE ANGLE DEPENDENT COLORS HAVING EVOLVED AS VISUAL SIGNAL.",APPROACH ANGLE; COLOR; FLOWER; IRIDESCENCE; PHOTOGRAPHY; POLLINATION; VISION,ULTRASTRUCTURAL BASIS; FLORAL IRIDESCENCE; SURFACE-STRUCTURES; FORAGING SPEED; PLUMAGE COLORS; AMBIENT LIGHT; BLUE COLOR; TRADE-OFF; DISCRIMINATION; EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"GARCIA, JE (REPRINT AUTHOR), RMIT UNIV, SCH MEDIA \& COMMUN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3001, AUSTRALIA.;GARCIA, JAIR E., SHRESTHA, MANI, HOWARD, SCARLETT R., PETERSEN, PHRED, DYER, ADRIAN G., RMIT UNIV, SCH MEDIA \& COMMUN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3001, AUSTRALIA.;SHRESTHA, MANI, MONASH UNIV, FAC INFORMAT TECHNOL, CLAYTON, VIC 3800, AUSTRALIA.",10.1093/CZ/ZOY096,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [DP130100015],"A.G.D.

TREES WERE IDENTIFIED AND INVESTIGATED FOR THE PRESENCE OF PLEBEIA AFF. FLAVOCINCTA NESTS, IN THREE YEARS: 2009, 2015 AND 2018. DATA ON HEIGHT AT NEST ENTRANCE (HNE), TREE DIAMETER AT NEST ENTRANCE (DNE) AND TREE DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT (DBH) WERE OBTAINED. TREES CONTAINING NESTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND GEO-REFERENCED. IN PETROLINA AND JUAZEIRO, THE PERCENTAGE OF BEES NESTS IN ALL CHECKED TREES WAS SMALLER IN 2009 (3.94\% AND 0.56\%) THAN IN 2015 (1.92\% AND 5.26\%) AND IN 2018 (21.21\% AND 3.66\%). THIS INCREASE (ESPECIALLY IN PETROLINA) SUGGESTS P. AFF. FLAVOCINCTA IS WELL ADAPTED TO URBAN ENVIRONMENTS AND FOOD AND/OR NESTING RESOURCES MIGHT BE IMPROVED ALONG THE YEARS. ON THE OTHER HAND, SURVIVAL OF NESTS WAS NOT HIGH: ONLY TWO NESTS FOUND IN 2009 SURVIVED UP TO 2018. MORTALITY OF NESTS WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE CUTTING OF TREES. SIMULTANEOUSLY, ACCORDING TO OBSERVATIONS, SWARMING PROBABLY OCCURS, WHAT MIGHT HAVE IMPROVED THE NUMBER OF NESTS OBSERVED IN 2018. THE VEGETAL SPECIES MOST USED BY THE BEES WAS PROSOPIS JULIFLORA (84.38\%). CONSIDERING ALL DATA, THE HNE, DNE, AND DHB VARIED AMONG THE CITIES AND YEARS, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN MOST OF THE CASES. IN JUAZEIRO, TWO NESTS WERE FOUND ALSO IN A WALL AND ANOTHER ONE IN A PIPE SHOWING THE DIVERSITY OF NESTING HABITS OF THE SPECIES. IT IS REMARKABLE THAT DESPITE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS (CAUSED BY NOISE, POLLUTION, AND HUMAN INTERFERENCES) THESE BEES ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE AND SWARM AT URBAN AREAS.",MELIPONINI; NESTING SITES; URBAN ECOLOGY,HYMENOPTERA APIDAE; BEE ASSEMBLAGES; APIFORMES; ABUNDANCE; RICHNESS; APOIDEA; FOREST; TREES; CITY; WASP,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"RIBEIRO, MF (REPRINT AUTHOR), EMBRAPA SEMIARIDO, BR 428,KM 152,ZONA RURAL CP 23, BR-56302100 PETROLINA, PE, BRAZIL.;RIBEIRO, M.
