WE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER SELECTION GENERATED BY POLLINATORS ACTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ON FLORAL REWARDS, ON ADVERTISEMENT TRAITS, AND/OR TRAITS AFFECTING POLLINATOR EFFICIENCY (THEIR FIT WITH FLOWERS) IN DALECHAMPIA VINES (EUPHORBIACEAE) AND WHETHER THE ADVERTISEMENT (BRACT SIZE) WAS CORRELATED HONESTLY WITH REWARD AMOUNT (MEASURED BY RESIN-GLAND AREA). IN GABON WE STUDIED BEE VISITATION AND POLLEN ARRIVAL RATES TO BLOSSOMS OF D. IPOMOEFOLIA BENTH. AND FOUND THAT, DESPITE THE APPARENT VISIBILITY OF THE RESIN REWARD (AND ITS VOLUME), THE STRONGEST BEE-MEDIATED NATURAL SELECTION ACTED DIRECTLY ON BRACT SIZE RATHER THAN GLAND AREA. BLOSSOMS WITH LARGER BRACTS WERE VISITED MORE OFTEN BY THE ONLY POLLINATORS, FEMALE HERIADES NR. SPINISCUTIS (APOIDEA: MEGACHILIDAE), AND THESE BLOSSOMS RECEIVED MORE POLLEN ON THEIR STIGMAS. BLOSSOMS WITH LARGER RESIN GLANDS WERE ALSO VISITED MORE OFTEN AND RECEIVED MORE POLLEN OVERALL, BUT THIS EFFECT DISAPPEARED WHEN BRACT SIZE (WHICH WAS PHENOTYPICALLY CORRELATED WITH GLAND SIZE) WAS CONTROLLED FOR STATISTICALLY. THESE OBSERVATIONAL DATA WERE CONFIRMED BY EXPERIMENTAL REDUCTION OF BRACT SIZE, WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED POLLEN ARRIVAL RATES. THUS, THE BEES APPEAR TO RELY ON THE ``HONEST'' CORRELATION BETWEEN ADVERTISEMENT AND REWARD IN CHOOSING THE BEST BLOSSOMS TO VISIT, AND THIS BEHAVIOR GENERATES DIRECT SELECTION FOR LARGER BRACTS AND INDIRECT SELECTION FOR LARGER RESIN GLANDS. BEES VISITING BLOSSOMS WITH LARGER SEPARATION BETWEEN THE GLAND AND STIGMAS CONTACTED THE STIGMAS LESS FREQUENTLY, AND SUCH BLOSSOMS RECEIVED LESS POLLEN ON THEIR STIGMAS. BECAUSE GLAND AREA, BRACT SIZE, AND GLAND-STIGMA SEPARATION ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED PHENOTYPICALLY, RESPONSE TO SELECTION FOR LARGER BRACTS MAY BE LIMITED IN THIS POPULATION BY CONFLICTING SELECTION AGAINST LARGE GLAND-STIGMA SEPARATION.",DALECHAMPIA IPOMOEIFOLIA; EVOLUTION; FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT; GENETIC CORRELATION; HERIADES; HONEST SIGNALING; INDIRECT SELECTION; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; POLLINATION,RAPHANUS-SATIVUS L; IPOMOPSIS-AGGREGATA; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; FLOWER SIZE; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; NATURAL-SELECTION; FLORAL TRAITS; SCANDENS EUPHORBIACEAE; FEMALE REPRODUCTION; MEDIATED SELECTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,79,"ARMBRUSTER, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PORTSMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PORTSMOUTH PO1 2DY, HANTS, ENGLAND.;UNIV PORTSMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PORTSMOUTH PO1 2DY, HANTS, ENGLAND.;NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT BIOL, N-7491 TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.;UNIV ALASKA, INST ARCTIC BIOL, FAIRBANKS, AK 99775 USA.",10.1890/04-1873,"1707 H ST NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20006-3915 USA",NA,NA,0012-9658,12,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,86,2005,ISI000234066700024,87,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,31,ECOLOGY,SCOTT.ARMBRUSTERPORT.AC.UK,994YI,"ARMBRUSTER, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PORTSMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PORTSMOUTH PO1 2DY, HANTS, ENGLAND",ISI,none,UNIV PORTSMOUTH;NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;UNIV ALASKA,UNIV PORTSMOUTH,NA,"ARMBRUSTER WS, 2005, ECOLOGY","ARMBRUSTER WS, 2005, ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,ana

TWO SOLITARY BEE SPECIES, XYLOCOPA CAFFRA AND MACRONOMIA RUFIPES, WERE IDENTIFIED AS EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS OF THE CROP. THE VISITATION RATES OF THESE POLLINATORS TO EGGPLANT FLOWERS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH DISTANCE FROM THE WILD HABITAT.

HARDER LD;BARRETT SCH,HARDER LD,MATING COST OF LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS IN HERMAPHRODITE PLANTS,NATURE,NATURE,"HERMAPHRODITISM COMPRISES OUTCROSSING WHENEVER THE PROXIMITY OF MALE AND FEMALE ORGANS ALLOWS SELF-FERTILIZATION(1) AND INTERFERENCE BETWEEN SEXUAL FUNCTIONS(2). MANY FLORAL TRAITS OF ANIMAL-POLLINATED ANGIOSPERMS ENCOURAGE CROSS-FERTILIZATION(3), AS RECOGNIZED BY DARWIN(4-6), HOWEVER, THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY ALSO ALLOW POLLINATION BETWEEN FLOWERS ON THE SAME INDIVIDUAL (GEITONOGAMOUS SELF-POLLINATION)(7,8). SIMULTANEOUS DISPLAY OF MANY FLOWERS EXEMPLIFIES THIS CONFLICT. ALTHOUGH LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS PROMOTE OUTCROSSING THROUGH ENHANCED POLLINATOR ATTRACTION(9), THEY COULD BE COSTLY IN TERMS OF LOST MATING OPPORTUNITIES(10,11) IF GEITONOGAMY DECREASED OUTCROSSED SIRING SUCCESS BY REDUCING POLLEN TRANSFER BETWEEN PLANTS (POLLEN DISCOUNTING(12)). WE REPORT HERE THAT, AFTER MANIPULATING THE FLOWER NUMBER OF BEE-POLLINATED EICHHORNIA PANICULATA PLANTS, WE OBSERVED THE PREDICTED HIGHER SELFING AND LOWER OUTCROSSED SIRING SUCCESS FOR LARGER INFLORESCENCES.

LINNEAN SOC.,"FLOWERS OF THE GENUS ARUM ARE KNOWN TO ATTRACT DUNG-BREEDING FLIES AND BEETLES THROUGH OLFACTORY DECEIT. IN ADDITION TO THIS STRATEGY, THE GENUS HAS EVOLVED SEVERAL OTHER POLLINATION MECHANISMS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE THE POLLINATION STRATEGIES OF THE CRETAN ARUM SPECIES BY INVESTIGATING THE FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, THERMOGENY, INFLORESCENCE ODOURS, AND THE POLLINATING FAUNA. THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT ARUM CYRENAICUM AND ARUM CONCINNATUM EMIT A STRONG DUNG SMELL AND EXHIBIT THE DISTINCTIVE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POLLINATION SYNDROME. BOTH SPECIES ARE HIGHLY THERMOGENIC, HAVE A SIMILAR ODOUR PROFILE AND ATTRACT SMALL-BODIED DIPTERA. ALTHOUGH SHARING THE SAME HABITAT, THESE TWO PLANT SPECIES ARE NEVER FOUND GROWING SYMPATRICALLY AS A RESULT OF THE EARLY BLOOMING PERIOD OF A. CYRENAICUM. BY CONTRAST, ARUM CRETICUM AND ARUM IDAEUM HAVE EVOLVED A MORE TRADITIONAL AND MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL POLLINATION MECHANISM. THE STINKING SMELL HAS BEEN REPLACED BY A MORE FLOWER-LIKE ODOUR THAT ATTRACTS BEES (LASIOGLOSSUM SP.) AND, OCCASIONALLY, BUGS (DIONCONOTUS CRUENTATUS). ALTHOUGH ATTRACTING THE SAME POLLINATOR, THE MAIN COMPOUND PRESENT IN THE ODOUR OF A. CRETICUM IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF A. IDAEUM. PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA), BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE COMPONENTS OF THE FLOWER ODOURS DETERMINED BY TESTING ON THE ANTENNA OF THE LASIOGLOSSUM BEE, REVEALED TWO DIFFERENT CLUSTERS, INDICATING THAT POLLINATORS CAN POTENTIALLY DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE ODOURS OF THE TWO SPECIES. A FURTHER PCA ON THE MAIN FLORAL ODOUR VOLATILES AS IDENTIFIED BY GAS CHROATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROSCOPY FROM ALL THE ARUM SPECIES UNDER INVESTIGATION DISPLAYED ODOUR-BASED SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIES. THE PCA-GAS CHOMOTOGRAPHY-ELECTROANTENNOGRAPHIC DETECTION ACTIVE PEAKS ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE TWO SPECIES, A. CRETICUM AND A. IDAEUM, FORM TWO GROUPS AND ARE CLEARLY SEPARATED FROM A. CYRENAICUM AND A. CONCINNATUM, WHICH, CONVERSELY, CLUSTER TOGETHER. THE EVOLUTIONARY FORCES AND SELECTIVE PRESSURES LEADING TO DIVERSIFICATION OF POLLINATION MECHANISMS IN THE CRETAN ARUM SPP.

GOLDBLATT P;MANNING JC,GOLDBLATT P,THE LONG-PROBOSCID FLY POLLINATION SYSTEM IN GLADIOLUS (IRIDACEAE),ANNALS OF THE MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN,ANN. MO. BOT. GARD.,"POLLINATION STRATEGIES OF GLADIOLUS ONE OF THE LARGEST GENERA OF THE MONOCOT FAMILY IRIDACEAE, ARE UNUSUALLY DIVERSE AND INVOLVE VARIOUS BEE SPECIES, FORAGING EITHER FOR NECTAR OR FOR POLLEN, OR MOTHS, A LARGE BUTTERFLY, PASSERINE BIRDS, AND LONG-PROBOSCID FLIES FORAGING FOR NECTAR. THE LATTER SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR 16 SPECIES OF GLADIOLUS OF DIVERSE TAXONOMIC AFFINITIES. THESE SPECIES ARE PRIMARILY OR EXCLUSIVELY POLLINATED BY FLIES WITH ELONGATE MOUTHPARTS. ALL HAVE SIMILAR FLOWERS WITH A SLENDER, ELONGATE PERIANTH TUBE, MOSTLY 25-50 MM LONG, A WHITE TO CREAM OR PINK PERIANTH, USUALLY MARKED WITH PINK OR RED NECTAR GUIDES ON THE LOWER TEPALS, AND LACK FLORAL ODOR. THE FLOWERS PRODUCE AMPLE QUANTITIES OF SUCROSE-RICH TO SUCROSE-DOMINANT NECTAR OF MODERATE SUGAR CONCENTRATION. EACH OF THESE SPECIES IS POLLINATED BY ONE OR TWO SPECIES OF FLIES OF THE FAMILIES TABANIDAE OR NEMESTRINIDAE, WHICH HAVE MOUTHPARTS USUALLY 20-60 MM LONG, EXCEPTIONALLY TO 80 MM IN MOEGISTORHYNCHUS LONGIROSTRIS. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF LONG-PROBOSCID FLY-POLLINATION SYSTEMS IS THE FORMATION OF GUILDS IN WHICH A NUMBER OF SPECIES OF PLANTS OF DIFFER ENT GENERA AND FAMILIES HAVE SIMILAR FLOWERS AND UTILIZE THE SAME POLLINATOR. IN THESE GUILDS POLLEN PLACEMENT ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY IS FAIRLY PRECISE, AND DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF A GUILD AT ANY SITE USE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE POLLINATOR'S BODY FOR POLLEN TRANSPORT. AN ADDITIONAL 13 SPECIES OF SOUTHERN AFRICAN GLADIOLUS HAVE FLOWERS CONFORMING TO THOSE POLLINATED BY LONG-PROBOSCID FLIES AND ARE THUS INFERRED TO HAVE THIS POLLINATION STRATEGY THESE SPECIES EXTEND FROM THE SOUTHERN,AFRICAN WINTER-RAINFALL ZONE IN THE SOUTHWEST TO THE DRAKENSBERG MOUNTAINS OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE SUBCONTINENT AND FLOWER AT PRECISELY THE TIMES THAT LONG-PROBOSCID FLIES ARE ON THE WING, MOSTLY LATE SPRING IN THE WEST (MID SEPTEMBER TO NOVEMBER) OR LATE SUMMER IN THE EAST (FEBRUARY TO APRIL). AN AUTUMN-FLOWERING GUILD USING A DIFFERENT FLY SPECIES OCCURS IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE WINTER-RAINFALL ZONE. THE TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS OF GLADIOLUS SPECIES POLLINATED BY LONG-PROBOSCID FLIES ARE DIVERSE WITH THESE 29 SPECIES FALLING IN SIX OF THE SEVEN SECTIONS OF THE GENUS OCCURRING IN SOUTHERN AFRICA, AND THE POLLINATION SYSTEM APPEARS TO HAVE EVOLVED INDEPENDENTLY IN EACH SECTION.",NA,SUBGENUS LAPEIROUSIA IRIDACEAE; SOUTHERN AFRICA; PHYLOGENY; BIOLOGY; DIPTERA; FLOWERS; GUILD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,36,"GOLDBLATT, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), MISSOURI BOT GARDENS, POB 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA.;MISSOURI BOT GARDENS, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA.;NATL BOT RES INST, COMPTON HERBARIUM, ZA-7735 CLAREMONT, SOUTH AFRICA.",10.2307/2666153,"2345 TOWER GROVE AVENUE, ST LOUIS, MO 63110 USA",NA,NA,0026-6493,3,MISSOURI BOTANICAL GARDEN,86,1999,ISI000084035800004,32,PLANT SCIENCES,12,PLANT SCIENCES,NA,261XK,"GOLDBLATT, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), MISSOURI BOT GARDENS, POB 299, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",ISI,none,NATL BOT RES INST,NOTREPORTED,NA,"GOLDBLATT P, 1999, ANN MO BOT GARD","GOLDBLATT P, 1999, ANN MO BOT GARD",NA,NA,NA,tien l
