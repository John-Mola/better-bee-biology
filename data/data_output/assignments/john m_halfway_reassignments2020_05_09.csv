INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS ON ONE SIDE OF THE SOIL SURFACE MAY HAVE IMPACTS THAT EXTEND ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT-HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS IS DERIVED LARGELY FROM STUDIES OF LEAF HERBIVORY, BELOWGROUND ROOT HERBIVORES MAY AFFECT PLANT FITNESS DIRECTLY OR BY ALTERING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF LEAF HERBIVORY, ROOT HERBIVORY, AND POLLINATION ON PLANT GROWTH, SUBSEQUENT LEAF HERBIVORY, FLOWER PRODUCTION, POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, AND REPRODUCTION IN CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS). WE MANIPULATED LEAF AND ROOT HERBIVORY WITH STRIPED CUCUMBER BEETLE (ACALYMMA VITTATUM) ADULTS AND LARVAE, RESPECTIVELY, AND MANIPULATED POLLINATION WITH SUPPLEMENTAL POLLEN. BOTH ENHANCED LEAF AND ROOT HERBIVORY REDUCED PLANT GROWTH, AND LEAF HERBIVORY REDUCED SUBSEQUENT LEAF DAMAGE. PLANTS WITH ENHANCED ROOT HERBIVORY PRODUCED 35\% FEWER FEMALE FLOWERS, WHILE LEAF HERBIVORY HAD NO EFFECT ON FLOWER PRODUCTION. WHILE LEAF HERBIVORY REDUCED THE TIME THAT HONEY BEES SPENT PROBING FLOWERS BY 29\%, PROBING TIMES ON ROOT-DAMAGED PLANTS WERE OVER TWICE AS LONG AS THOSE ON CONTROL PLANTS. ROOT HERBIVORY INCREASED POLLEN LIMITATION FOR SEED PRODUCTION IN SPITE OF INCREASED HONEY BEE PREFERENCE FOR PLANTS WITH ROOT DAMAGE. LEAF DAMAGE AND HAND-POLLINATION TREATMENTS HAD NO EFFECT ON FRUIT PRODUCTION, BUT PLANTS WITH ENHANCED ROOT DAMAGE PRODUCED 38\% FEWER FRUITS THAT WERE 25\% LIGHTER THAN THOSE ON CONTROL PLANTS. DESPITE THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF BELOWGROUND DAMAGE ON HONEY BEE VISITATION, ROOT HERBIVORY HAD A STRONGER NEGATIVE EFFECT ON PLANT REPRODUCTION THAN LEAF HERBIVORY.

NAT.,"THE SOAPWORT GENTIAN GENTIANA SAPONARIA (GENTIANACEAE) OCCURS AT ONLY THREE SITES IN OHIO, INCLUDING A POPULATION AT THE LOUIS W. CAMPBELL STATE NATURE PRESERVE IN LUCAS COUNTY. SEED PRODUCTION AT THIS POPULATION WAS MONITORED DURING 5 GROWING SEASONS BETWEEN 1984 AND 1991. A BAGGING EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THAT POLLINATORS WERE REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE POLLINATION. IN 1984-1985 AND 1990-1991, MORE THAN 90\% OF THE FLOWERS SET FRUIT, INDICATING THAT POLLINATOR VISITATION (PRIMARILY BY BUMBLEBEES) DID NOT LIMIT FRUIT SET. FRUIT SET WAS UNUSUALLY LOW IN 1988 (37\%), PERHAPS DUE TO EFFECTS OF DROUGHT STRESS ON THE PLANTS AND/OR THEIR POLLINATORS. LEVELS OF FRUIT DAMAGE FROM INSECT LARVAE RANGED FROM >90\% IN 1984-1985 TO A LOW OF 37\% IN 1990. SEED PREDATORS CONSUMED THE SMALL, WINGED SEEDS AND ALSO PREVENTED NORMAL FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. UNEATEN SEEDS WITHIN DAMAGED FRUITS OFTEN APPEARED MOLDY, AND DISPERSAL BY WIND WAS UNLIKELY.

CONSEQUENTLY, POLLINATORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER PREDATORS WHEN VISITING THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS. I PRESENT A MODEL OF HOW DIFFERENT POLLINATOR SPECIES CAN MAXIMIZE LIFETIME RESOURCE GAINS DEPENDING ON THE DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF PREDATORS, AS WELL AS THEIR VULNERABILITY TO CAPTURE BY PREDATORS. FOR POLLINATOR SPECIES THAT ARE DIFFICULT FOR PREDATORS TO CAPTURE, THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY IS TO VISIT THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS AS LONG AS PREDATOR DENSITY IS LOW. AT HIGHER PREDATOR DENSITIES AND FOR POLLINATORS THAT ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO PREDATOR CAPTURE, THE LIFETIME RESOURCE GAIN FROM THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS DECLINES AND THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY DEPENDS ON THE PREDATOR DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME CASES, A WIDE RANGE OF FLORAL REWARDS PROVIDES NEAR-MAXIMUM LIFETIME RESOURCE GAINS, WHICH MAY FAVOR GENERALIZATION IF SEARCHING FOR FLOWERS IS COSTLY. IN OTHER CASES, A LOW FLOWER REWARD LEVEL PROVIDES THE MAXIMUM LIFETIME RESOURCE GAIN AND SO POLLINATORS SHOULD SPECIALIZE ON LESS REWARDING FLOWERS.

WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT: SEED PRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY INADEQUATE POLLINATION OR THAT POLLINATIONS BETWEEN NEAR NEIGHBOR PLANTS (INBREEDING DEPRESSION) OR BETWEEN DISTANT PLANTS (OUTBREEDING DEPRESSION) RESULTED IN REDUCED FRUIT OR SEED SET. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECT OF GRAZING ON FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTION. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT P OBCORDATA CAN HYBRIDIZE WITH ITS COMMON CONGENER, P. ACUTIFOLIA. ONLY CROSSES WITH P. OBCORDATA AS POLLEN RECIPIENT AND ? ACUTIFOLIA AS POLLEN DONOR SEEMED FERTILE. PRIMARY FLOWER-VISITORS OF? OBCORDATA ARE GROUND-NESTING NATIVE BEES IN THE FAMILIES ANDRENIDAE AND HALICTIDAE. MOST SPECIES VISITING THE FLOWERS OF P. OBCORDATA ARE GENERALISTS. ONLY TWO BEE SPECIES WERE LIKELY MUSTARD SPECIALISTS. THE ONLY NON-BEE VISITOR OF ANY IMPORT WAS A DIPTERAN, GONIA (TACHINIDAE). PREDICTIONS OF THE DISTANCES FLOWN BY COMMON BEE VISITORS WERE MADE USING THE EQUATIONS OF GREENLEAF ET AL. (2007). NO BEE IS LIKELY TO TRAVEL MORE THAN I KM FROM ITS NESTING SITE TO VISIT P.

TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CLONAL SPREAD ON THE FINE-SCALE SPATIAL GENETIC STRUCTURE WITHIN PLANT POPULATIONS, HOSTA JONESII (LILIACEAE), AN ENDEMIC SPECIES TO KOREA, WAS CHOSEN AS A STUDY SPECIES.

WE PROPOSE SEVERAL STATISTICAL PROCEDURES, ILLUSTRATING THEM WITH RECORDS OF INTERPLANT FLIGHT SEQUENCES BY BUMBLE BEES VISITING PENSTEMON FLOWERS. AN ASYMMETRY TEST DETECTS DEVIATIONS FROM BINOMIAL EXPECTATION IN THE DIRECTIONALITY OF VISITS BETWEEN PAIRS OF PLANTS. SEVERAL TESTS COMPARE DATA FROM ONE BEE TO ANOTHER: FREQUENCIES OF VISITS TO PLANTS AND FREQUENCIES OF DEPARTURES TO PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS ARE COMPARED USING CONTINGENCY TABLES, SIMILARITIES OF REPEATED SEQUENCES WITHIN BEES ARE COMPARED TO THOSE BETWEEN BEES BY MEANS OF SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND MANTEL TESTS. WE ALSO COMPARED OBSERVED MOVEMENT PATTERNS TO THOSE GENERATED BY NULL MODELS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT REALISTIC FORAGING BY ONO-TRAPLINING BEES, EXAMINING: TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF THE BEE'S SPATIAL DISPLACEMENT FROM ITS STARTING POINT USING SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, THE VARIANCE OF RETURN TIMES TO PARTICULAR PLANTS, AND THE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT OF REPEATED CYCLES WITHIN SEQUENCES.

LUO Z;ZHANG D;RENNER SS,LUO Z,WHY TWO KINDS OF STAMENS IN BUZZ-POLLINATED FLOWERS? EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT FOR DARWIN'S DIVISION-OF-LABOUR HYPOTHESIS,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"1. MOST ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERING PLANTS OFFER NECTAR AS A REWARD FOR THEIR POLLINATORS. SOME 20 000 SPECIES, HOWEVER, OFFER ONLY POLLEN AND RELY ON POLLEN-FORAGING BEES FOR POLLINATION. THIS CREATES A DILEMMA SINCE POLLEN GRAINS CONTAIN THE MALE GAMETES AND SHOULD BE PROTECTED FROM BECOMING BEE FOOD. DARWIN WAS THE FIRST TO HYPOTHESIZE THAT A `DIVISION-OF-LABOUR' AMONG STAMENS COULD SOLVE THIS DILEMMA, WITH SOME STAMENS PROVIDING POLLEN AS FOOD, OTHERS PROVIDING POLLEN FOR FERTILIZATION. THIS HYPOTHESIS CAN ONLY BE TESTED IF POLLEN GRAINS FROM THE TWO SETS OF STAMENS CAN BE DISTINGUISHED AND THEIR FATES DETERMINED TO THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT ON THE STIGMA. 2. WE TESTED DARWIN'S HYPOTHESIS IN MELASTOMA MALABATHRICUM (MELASTOMATACEAE), A POLLEN-ONLY FLOWER WITH CONSPICUOUSLY DIFFERENTIATED STAMENS, AN INNER SET THAT IS SHORT AND YELLOW AND AN OUTER SET THAT IS MUCH LONGER AND PURPLE WITH SMALL YELLOW SPURS. POLLEN RELEASE IS THROUGH TERMINAL ANTHER PORES. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DIFFERENT EXINE PATTERNS ON THE POLLEN PRODUCED BY THE TWO SETS OF STAMENS, WE CARRIED OUT A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATIONS TO COMPARE POLLINATOR FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND POLLEN PATHWAYS FROM ANTHERS TO STIGMAS. 3. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT IN SPITE OF ALL 10 STAMENS BEING BUZZED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY THE CARPENTER BEES THAT POLLINATE M. MALABATHRICUM, POLLEN FROM THE PURPLE `FERTILIZATION' STAMENS IS DRAMATICALLY MORE LIKELY TO LAND ON STIGMAS THAN POLLEN FROM THE YELLOW `FEEDING' STAMENS. REMOVAL EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE YELLOW `FEEDING' STAMENS ALSO ATTRACTED POLLINATORS FROM A DISTANCE. FLOWERS THAT HAD THEIR ANTHER PORES PLUGGED RECEIVED FEWER BUZZING BOUTS PER VISIT, INDICATING THAT BEES ASSESSED THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN RECEIVED PER BOUT. SURPRISINGLY, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN POLLEN LOADS ON STIGMAS OF FLOWERS THAT HAD THEIR ANTHERS PLUGGED AND STIGMAS OF CONTROLS, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICIENCY OF VECTOR-ASSISTED CROSS-POLLINATION AND THE LACK OF VECTOR-ASSISTED SELF-POLLINATION. 4. THE UNEXPECTEDLY PRECISE PLACEMENT OF POLLEN GRAINS EVEN WITH BUZZ POLLINATION, WITH A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE GRAINS DEPOSITED OUT OF THE BEES' GROOMING REACH, HELPS EXPLAIN THE EVOLUTIONARY PERSISTENCE OF POLLEN AS A REWARD IN SPITE OF THE BEES' ABILITY TO ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN RECEIVED DURING FORAGING BOUTS.
