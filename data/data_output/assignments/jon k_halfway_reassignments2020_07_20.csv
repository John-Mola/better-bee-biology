CONSERV.,"SPATIOTEMPORAL RESOURCE CONTINUITY PROMOTES PERSISTENCE OF MOBILE ANIMAL POPULATIONS. CURRENT AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES ARE POOR IN FLOWERS RESOURCES FOR BUMBLE BEES. AVAILABLE FORAGE CROPS ARE PREDOMINANTLY EARLY-SEASON MASS-FLOWERING CROPS (MFC). IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, BUT NOT TESTED, THAT SCARCITY OF LATE-SEASON FLOWER RESOURCES ARE LIMITING BUMBLE BEE POPULATIONS. WE EXAMINED WHETHER ADDITION OF LATE-SEASON FLOWERING RED CLOVER AFFECTED WORKER, QUEEN AND MALE BUMBLE BEE DENSITIES. BUMBLE BEES WERE SURVEYED IN FLOWER-RICH UNCULTIVATED FIELD BORDERS ACROSS 24 LANDSCAPES (RADIUS 2 KM) WITH OR WITHOUT A CLOVER FIELD IN THE CENTRE, VARYING IN SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND (SNG) AND EARLY MFC AVAILABILITY. CLOVER FIELDS HAD OVER TEN TIMES HIGHER WORKER DENSITIES COMPARED TO FIELD BORDERS, SUGGESTING RED CLOVER AS FAVOURED FORAGE. FIVE TIMES MORE QUEENS AND 71\% MORE MALES WERE FOUND IN LANDSCAPES WITH CLOVER FIELDS COMPARED TO CONTROL LANDSCAPES, DESPITE THESE FIELDS CONSTITUTING LESS THAN 0.2\% OF THE LANDSCAPE AREA. BOTH MFC AND SNG INCREASED THE DENSITY OF MALES, BUT ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF CLOVER FIELDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LATE-FLOWERING RED CLOVER POSITIVELY AFFECTS BUMBLE BEE REPRODUCTION, LIKELY BY INCREASING TEMPORAL RESOURCE CONTINUITY.

PROGENY TESTING WITH ELECTROPHORETIC MARKERS ALLOWED US TO MEASURE PATERNAL SUCCESS. REALIZED FECUNDITY BY EACH MATERNAL PLANT AND THE FRACTION OF THOSE SEEDS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EACH POLLEN DONOR GROUP WERE USED AS OUTCOME VARIABLES IN PATH ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL CHARACTERS (PETAL SIZE, POLLEN GRAIN NUMBER PER FLOWER, AND MODAL POLLEN GRAIN SIZE), POLLINATOR VISITATION PATTERNS, AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS.

THE IMPACT OF VISITATION ON MALE AND FEMALE REPRODUCTION ALSO VARIED AMONG TAXA, VISITS OF SMALL NATIVE BEES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED PATERNAL SUCCESS, WHILE THOSE OF HONEY BEES REDUCED MALE FITNESS.

FENSTER CB;DUDASH MR,FENSTER CB,SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE ROLE OF HUMMINGBIRDS AS POLLINATORS OF SILENE VIRGINICA,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"POLLINATION RESTRICTED TO A GUILD OF VISITORS IS CENTRAL TO THE CONCEPT OF POLLINATION SYNDROMES. HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE POLLINATION OF PLANTS EXHIBITING CERTAIN POLLINATION SYNDROMES IS ACTUALLY DOMINATED BY THE EXPECTED GUILD OF POLLINATORS. WE DETERMINED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SOLE HUMMINGBIRD SPECIES IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA, THE RUBY-THROAT, ARCHILOCHUS COLUBRIS, AND INVERTEBRATE VISITORS AS POLLINATORS OF SILENE VIRGINICA, WHICH EXHIBITS TRAITS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION. WE QUANTIFIED THE ROLE OF EITHER TYPE OF VISITOR AS POLLINATORS BY COMPARING FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PLANTS THAT WERE ALLOWED FREE ACCESS BY ALL VISITORS TO FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF CAGED PLANTS THAT WERE RESTRICTED TO POLLINATION BY INVERTEBRATES (SMALL BEES AND FLIES, AND IN ONE YEAR BOMBUS SPP.). SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE ROLE OF EITHER TYPE OF POLLINATOR WAS DOCUMENTED BY COMPARING THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF CAGED AND CONTROL PLANTS IN TWO NEARBY SITES FOR FIVE YEARS. IN GENERAL WE FOUND THAT HUMMINGBIRDS ARE THE PREDOMINANT POLLINATOR OF S. VIRGINICA, BUT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION IN THEIR ROLE. WE DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF HUMMINGBIRDS AS POTENTIAL SELECTIVE AGENTS OF S.
