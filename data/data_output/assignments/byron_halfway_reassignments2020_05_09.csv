BRUNET J;THAIRU MW;HENSS JM;LINK RI;KLUEVER JA,BRUNET J,"THE EFFECTS OF FLOWER, FLORAL DISPLAY, AND REWARD SIZES ON BUMBLEBEE FORAGING BEHAVIOR WHEN POLLEN IS THE REWARD AND PLANTS ARE DICHOGAMOUS",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,INT. J. PLANT SCI.,"PREMISE OF RESEARCH.THE SIZE OF FLORAL DISPLAY, FLOWER, AND REWARD CAN INFLUENCE POLLINATOR FORAGING BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FLORAL TRAITS AND REWARDS IN AFFECTING POLLINATOR PREFERENCES IS UNCLEAR. MOREOVER, IN MONOECIOUS PLANTS AND PLANTS WITH STRONG WITHIN-FLOWER DICHOGAMY, SOME FLOWERS DO NOT OFFER A POLLEN REWARD, AND POLLINATOR ATTRACTION MAY DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF REWARDING FLOWERS RATHER THAN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE. WE EXAMINED THESE QUESTIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE, WHERE BUMBLEBEES CAN FORAGE ONLY FOR POLLEN PRODUCED IN MALE-PHASE FLOWERS.METHODOLOGY.WE USED DUAL-CHOICE ASSAYS AND EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CORRELATION BETWEEN POLLEN REWARD AND FLOWER SIZE WAS NECESSARY BEFORE BEES COULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FLOWERS WITH DIFFERENT POLLEN REWARDS OR SIZES. THE IMPACT OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE ON BEE FORAGING WAS FIRST EXAMINED USING INFLORESCENCES WHERE ALL FLOWERS PROVIDED A REWARD, EITHER SMALL OR LARGE. WE THEN VARIED EITHER FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE OR NUMBER OF REWARDING FLOWERS WHILE KEEPING THE OTHER VARIABLE CONSTANT.PIVOTAL RESULTS.BUMBLEBEES PREFERRED FLOWERS WITH A LARGER POLLEN REWARD OR LARGER FLOWERS ONLY WHEN THE SIZE OF THE POLLEN REWARD WAS CORRELATED WITH FLOWER SIZE. BEES SELECTED LARGER FLORAL DISPLAYS WHEN ALL FLOWERS PRESENTED A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF POLLEN BUT PREFERRED INFLORESCENCES WITH MORE POLLEN-REWARDING FLOWERS WHEN ONLY A PROPORTION OF THE FLOWERS OFFERED A POLLEN REWARD.CONCLUSIONS.BEES COULD IDENTIFY WHETHER A FLOWER OFFERED POLLEN AND COULD QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF POLLEN-REWARDING FLOWERS. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLEN REWARD AFFECTED POLLINATOR PREFERENCES AND MAY FACILITATE SELECTION OF FLORAL TRAITS BY POLLINATORS. POLLINATORS PREFERRED INFLORESCENCES WITH MORE POLLEN-PRODUCING FLOWERS RATHER THAN LARGER FLORAL DISPLAYS, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SELECTION OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE BY POLLINATORS MAY DIFFER BETWEEN PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT MATING SYSTEMS.",BUMBLEBEE; DICHOGAMY; FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE; FLOWER SIZE; POLLEN REWARD; POLLINATOR PREFERENCE; AQUILEGIA COERULEA,ROCKY-MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE; POLLINATOR VISITATION; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; TRAITS; SELECTION; SCENT; POPULATION; RESPONSES; DENSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"BRUNET, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WISCONSIN, USDA ARS, VEGETABLE CROP RES UNIT, DEPT ENTOMOL, 1630 LINDEN DR, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.;BRUNET, JOHANNE, HENSS, JILLIAN M., UNIV WISCONSIN, USDA ARS, VEGETABLE CROP RES UNIT, DEPT ENTOMOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.;BRUNET, JOHANNE, THAIRU, MAGARET W., HENSS, JILLIAN M., LINK, ROSABETH I., KLUEVER, JOSHUA A., UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ENTOMOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.",10.1086/683339,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA","USDA, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICEUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE (USDA)","DR.

ECOL.,"WHILE MANY PLANT SPECIES OFFER REWARDS (E.G. NECTAR) TO POLLINATORS, SOME SPECIES, PARTICULARLY IN ORCHIDS, DO NOT PROVIDE REWARDS. ECOLOGICAL FACTORS, SUCH AS INTERACTIONS WITH REWARDING CO-FLOWERING SPECIES MAY AFFECT POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES TO SUCH DECEPTIVE SPECIES BY INFLUENCING POLLINATOR ABILITY TO LEARN TO AVOID DECEPTIVE PLANTS (AVOIDANCE LEARNING). WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF FLOWER COLOUR SIMILARITY (SIMILAR VS DISSIMILAR) AND FINE-SCALE SPATIAL MINGLING (MONOSPECIFIC VS HETEROSPECIFIC PATCHES) OF REWARDING AND DECEPTIVE ARTIFICIAL PLANTS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION IN A FULLY CROSSED DESIGN. WE ALSO EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS ON LEARNING OF INITIALLY NAIVE BUMBLEBEES. OVER TIME, BUMBLEBEES INCREASINGLY AVOIDED THE DECEPTIVE PLANTS, BUT AT A SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER RATE WHEN DECEPTIVE AND REWARDING PLANTS HAD DISSIMILAR FLOWER COLOURS THAN WHEN THEY WERE SIMILAR. DECEPTIVE PLANTS RECEIVED MORE VISITS WHEN MINGLED IN HETEROSPECIFIC PATCHES WITH REWARDING PLANTS OF SIMILAR FLOWER COLOUR THAN WHEN MINGLED WITH DISSIMILAR ONES. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT WHEN REWARDING AND DECEPTIVE PLANTS WERE SPATIALLY SEPARATED IN MONOSPECIFIC PATCHES. IN CONCLUSION, BOTH SPATIAL MINGLING AND FLOWER COLOUR SIMILARITY AFFECTED POLLINATOR VISITATION TO AND AVOIDANCE LEARNING OF DECEPTIVE PLANTS.

EVOL.,"THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, FRUIT AND SEED SET VIA NOCTURNAL POLLINATION WOULD EXCEED THAT OF DIURNAL POLLINATION BECAUSE OF THE GREATER INSECT ACTIVITY AT NIGHT TYPICAL OF HOT, ARID REGIONS. CLERODENDRUM MOLLE, A WIDESPREAD MEMBER OF THE GALAPAGOS FLORA WAS SUBMITTED TO POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS, VISITOR OBSERVATIONS, NECTAR SAMPLING, POLLEN TRANSFER STUDIES, POLLEN OVULE RATIO STUDIES, AND POLLEN MEASUREMENTS. FLOWERS SET FRUIT AND SEED VIA OPEN POLLINATION, AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY, FACILITATED AUTOGAMY, FACILITATED CROSS-POLLINATION, DIURNAL POLLINATION, AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATION. RESULTS INDICATE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FRUIT SET. CROSS-POLLINATED FLOWERS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SEED SET OVER ALL TREATMENTS EXCEPT FACILITATED AUTOGAMY. NOCTURNAL AND DIURNAL FRUIT AND SEED SET DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. NOCTURNAL VISITORS INCLUDED ANTS, SPIDERS, HAWK MOTHS, AND ROACHES WHEREAS DIURNAL VISITORS INCLUDED CARPENTER BEES AND ANTS. GALAPAGOS MEMBERS OF C. MOLLE EXHIBIT INCOMPLETE PROTANDRY AND SET FRUIT VIA AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY AS A RESULT OF NATURAL SELECTION IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH FEW FAITHFUL POLLINATORS. OVERALL LOW FRUIT AND SEED SET ARE LIKELY BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF POLLEN AND RESOURCE LIMITATION, THE LATTER EXACERBATED BY NECTAR ROBBING.

REV.,"THE MEDITERRANEAN FLORA IS SPECTACULARLY RICH IN ORCHID SPECIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ORCHIDS HAVE COMPLEX AND DELICATE INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR POLLINATORS, WHICH MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION. CONSERVATION ACTIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR A RANGE OF ENDANGERED MEDITERRANEAN ORCHID SPECIES, BUT THE CURRENT TAXONOMIC CONFUSION IN SEVERAL GENERA AND THE APPARENT DISAGREEMENT AMONG ORCHID TAXONOMISTS MAKE THE SITUATION PARTICULARLY CONFUSING FROM A CONSERVATION PERSPECTIVE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DOCUMENT HOW THE DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS (NECTAR REWARD, SHELTER OFFERING, FOOD DECEPTION AND SEXUAL DECEPTION) CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS AMONG SPECIES, ON FLORAL PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AS WE PERCEIVE IT, ON POTENTIALLY RELATED PROCESSES OF SPECIES SORTING AND EXTINCTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SHOULD HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE RELATED CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS ARE POLLINATED BY SPECIALISED BEES OFTEN OCCUPYING OTHERWISE NARROW ECOLOGICAL NICHES (E.G. POLLEN SPECIALISATION, BROOD CELL PARASITES, SPECIFIC NESTING SITE). THIS CONDITION MAKES THE ORCHID-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS VERY FRAGILE AND SEVERAL ORCHID SPECIES PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS PHENOMENON BY A SELECTION OF CASE STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW THE ADEQUATE INTEGRATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS/TRAITS OF THE ORCHIDS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED POLLINATORS INTO CONSERVATION ACTIONS COULD HELP PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES AND ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE OFTEN COMPLEX LOCAL POLLINATION WEB.",MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; CONSERVATION STRATEGIES,SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; FLORAL MIMICRY; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; EPIPHYTIC ORCHID; BEES HYMENOPTERA; FRUIT PRODUCTION; FORAGING RANGES; HARMONIC RADAR; GENUS-OPHRYS; POPULATIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,27,"VEREECKEN, NJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BRUSSELS, AVE FD ROOSEVELT 50,CP 160-12, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., FREE UNIV BRUSSELS, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., UNIV LIBRE BRUXELLES, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., UNIV ZURICH, INST SYSTEMAT BOT, CH-8008 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;DAFNI, AMOTS, UNIV HAIFA, INST EVOLUT, DEPT EVOLUTIONARY \& ENVIRONM BIOL, IL-31905 HAIFA, ISRAEL.;COZZOLINO, SALVATORE, UNIV NAPLES FEDERICO II, DEPT STRUCT \& FUNCT BIOL, I-80126 NAPLES, ITALY.",10.1007/S12229-010-9049-5,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",FRS-FNRS (BELGIUM)FONDS DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE - FNRS,"WE WISH TO THANK ROBERT PEMBERTON, STELLA WATTS AND HONG LIU FOR THEIR CRITICAL READING OF THE PAPER AND FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS.

WESTER P;STANWAY R;PAUW A,WESTER P,"MICE POLLINATE THE PAGODA LILY, WHITEHEADIA BIFOLIA (HYACINTHACEAE) - FIRST FIELD OBSERVATIONS WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION OF RODENT POLLINATION IN SOUTH AFRICA",SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,S. AFR. J. BOT.,"FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SOUTH AFRICA NOCTURNAL RODENT POLLINATION WAS OBSERVED AND PHOTOGRAPHED UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS. IN THE NORTHERN CEDERBERG AREA OF THE WESTERN CAPE FIELD STUDIES AND EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT FLOWERS OF WHITEHEADIA BIFOLIA (HYCANINTHACEAE) ARE VISITED AT NIGHT BY RODENTS, MAINLY THE NAMAQUA ROCK MOUSE AETHOMYS NAMAQUENSIS. THE MICE WERE OBSERVED LICKING NECTAR WHILE BEING DUSTED WITH POLLEN AND TOUCHING THE STIGMAS. NO OTHER VISITORS WERE OBSERVED DURING THE DAY OR NIGHT. W. BIFOLIA POLLEN WAS FOUND AROUND THE SNOUTS AND IN THE FAECES OF LIVE-TRAPPED MICE, THE LATTER LIKELY AS A RESULT OF GROOMING THEIR FUR, SINCE THEY VISITED THE FLOWERS WITHOUT EATING OR DESTROYING THEM. W. BIFOLIA HAS CHARACTERS OF THE RODENT POLLINATION FLORAL SYNDROME SUCH AS VISUALLY INCONSPICUOUS, BOWL-SHAPED FLOWERS CLOSE TO THE GROUND, WITH STIFF STAMENS AS WELL AS EASILY ACCESSIBLE, VERY VISCOUS NECTAR AND A WEAK, SLIGHTLY SOURISH-NUTTY SCENT. FURTHERMORE, THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT POLLINATION SYNDROMES CAN BE USED TO MAKE TESTABLE PREDICTIONS ABOUT FLORAL TRAIT EVOLUTION DUE TO POLLINATOR SELECTION. (C) 2009 SAAB.

CHEM. ECOL.,"CYCLOCEPHALINE SCARABS ARE SPECIALISED SCENT-DRIVEN POLLINATORS, IMPLICATED WITH THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF SEVERAL NEOTROPICAL PLANT TAXA. NIGHT-BLOOMING FLOWERS POLLINATED BY THESE BEETLES ARE THERMOGENIC AND RELEASE INTENSE FRAGRANCES SYNCHRONIZED TO POLLINATOR ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, DATA ON FLORAL SCENT COMPOSITION WITHIN SUCH MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS ARE SCARCE, AND THE IDENTITY OF BEHAVIORALLY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS INVOLVED IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE PERFORMED GC-MS ANALYSES OF FLORAL SCENTS OF FOUR SPECIES OF ANNONA (MAGNOLIIDS, ANNONACEAE) AND CALADIUM BICOLOR (MONOCOTS, ARACEAE), AND DEMONSTRATED THE CHEMICAL BASIS FOR THE ATTRACTION OF THEIR EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS. 4-METHYL-5-VINYLTHIAZOLE, A NITROGEN AND SULPHUR-CONTAINING HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND PREVIOUSLY UNREPORTED IN FLOWERS, WAS FOUND AS A PROMINENT CONSTITUENT IN ALL STUDIED SPECIES. FIELD BIOTESTS CONFIRMED THAT IT IS HIGHLY ATTRACTIVE TO BOTH MALE AND FEMALE BEETLES OF THREE SPECIES OF THE GENUS CYCLOCEPHALA, POLLINATORS OF THE STUDIED PLANT TAXA. THE ORIGIN OF 4-METHYL-5-VINYLTHIAZOLE IN PLANTS MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE METABOLISM OF THIAMINE (VITAMIN B1), AND WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE PRESENCE OF THIS COMPOUND IN UNRELATED LINEAGES OF ANGIOSPERMS IS EITHER LINKED TO SELECTIVE EXPRESSION OF A PLESIOMORPHIC BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY OR TO PARALLEL EVOLUTION.",FLORAL SCENT; BEETLE POLLINATION; GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (GC-MS); OLFACTORY-MEDIATED ATTRACTION,MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES; CONVERGENT EVOLUTION; SILENE-LATIFOLIA; FRENCH-GUIANA; FLOWER SCENT; VOLATILES; ECOLOGY; BIOSYNTHESIS; MAGNOLIACEAE; CHEMISTRY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,39,"MAIA, ACD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT QUIM FUNDAMENTAL, BR-50740560 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL.;DALIA MAIA, ARTUR CAMPOS, DO AMARAL FERRAZ NAVARRO, DANIELA MARIA, UNIV FED PERNAMBUCO, DEPT QUIM FUNDAMENTAL, BR-50740560 RECIFE, PE, BRAZIL.;DOETTERL, STEFAN, UNIV BAYREUTH, DEPT PLANT SYSTEMAT, D-95440 BAYREUTH, GERMANY.;KAISER, ROMAN, GIVAUDAN FRAGRANCE RES, CH-8600 DUBENDORF, SWITZERLAND.;SILBERBAUER-GOTTSBERGER, ILSE, GOTTSBERGER, GERHARD, UNIV ULM, BOT GARDEN, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY.;SILBERBAUER-GOTTSBERGER, ILSE, GOTTSBERGER, GERHARD, UNIV ULM, HERBARIUM, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY.;TEICHERT, HOLGER, UNIV ULM, INST SYSTEMAT BOT \& ECOL, D-89081 ULM, GERMANY.;GIBERNAU, MARC, CNRS ECOFOG, UMR 8172, F-97379 KOUROU, FRANCE.;SCHLINDWEIN, CLEMENS, UNIV FED MINAS GERAIS, DEPT BOT, BR-31270901 BELO HORIZONTE, MG, BRAZIL.",10.1007/S10886-012-0173-Z,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",CAPESCAPES; CNPQNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (CNPQ); BMBFFEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION \& RESEARCH (BMBF),"THE AUTHORS THANK PASCHOAL COELHO GROSSI, BRETT RATCLIFFE, AND ANTONIO CARLOS WEBBER FOR SPECIES IDENTIFICATION; AND ROGER SEYMOUR, KYLE DEXTER, CECILIA MEIRA AND THREE ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR PROOFREADING AND VALUABLE SUGGESTIONS.

J. ECOL.,"BY APPLYING HAND POLLINATION, WE STUDIED POLLEN LIMITATION OF SEED SET OF FEMALE PLANTS IN FOUR DIOECIOUS PLANT SPECIES WITH INSECT-POLLINATION. THE EFFECT OF HAND POLLINATION INCREASED WITH DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST MALE PLANT. DISTANCES AT WHICH SEED SET WAS 50\% OF ITS MAXIMAL VALUE (AFTER HAND POLLINATION) WERE: 2.3 M FOR VALERIANA DIOICA, 5.3 M FOR SALIX REPENS, 8.5 M FOR ASPARAGUS OFFICINALE AND 10.6 M FOR BRYONIA DIOICA. WE DISCUSS TO WHAT EXTENT THE REDUCED SEED SET WAS CAUSED BY EITHER FEWER VISITS OR BY VISITS OF A LOWER QUALITY. WE ARGUE THAT QUANTIFYING DISTANCE-DEPENDENT SEED SET IN DIOECIOUS PLANTS MAY BE A GOOD WAY OF STUDYING EFFECTS OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON THE BREAKDOWN OF MUTUALISTIC POLLINATION SYSTEMS.
