PANICLED BLUEBELLS (MERTENSIA PANICULATA) EXPERIENCE HIGH RATES OF NECTAR ROBBERY BY BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS MIXTUS AND B. FRIGIDUS) IN THE WRANGELL MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHCENTRAL ALASKA. NEVERTHELESS, EXPERIMENTAL PREVENTION OF NECTAR LARCENY IN TWO SEASONS DID NOT ENHANCE COMPONENTS OF FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (NUTLET INITIATION, SEED-SET, AND SEED MASS) OR MALE SUCCESS (POLLEN REMOVAL). OBSERVATIONAL DATA SHOW THAT THE ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE IMPACT OF NECTAR ROBBERY IS A CONSEQUENCE OF BUMBLE BEE BEHAVIORS, THE TWO BEE SPECIES THAT ROB MATURE FLOWERS BUZZ-POLLINATE THE SAME FLOWERS AT AN EARLIER STAGE IN FLORAL DEVELOPMENT. THE SHIFT IN BEE BEHAVIOR IS DRIVEN BY THE PRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT REWARDS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE FLOWERING PERIOD, YOUNG FLOWERS CONTAIN POLLEN AND OLDER FLOWERS PRODUCE NECTAR. ALTHOUGH FLOWERS TYPICALLY RECEIVE AND DONATE POLLEN BEFORE MOST NECTAR IS PRODUCED, THE MATURE FLOWERS PRODUCING A ROBBED NECTAR REWARD MAY NONETHELESS CONTRIBUTE TO THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF BLUEBELL PLANTS. FLOWERS SEQUESTERED FROM POLLINATORS IN THE EARLY STAGE WERE STILL CAPABLE OF INITIATING NUTLETS, DEMONSTRATING THAT OLDER FLOWERS CAN ENHANCE FEMALE REPRODUCTION IF POLLINATORS ARE RARE (WHEN MANY EARLY-STAGE FLOWERS MAY GO UNVISITED). MOREOVER, THE REMOVAL OF MATURE FLOWERS REDUCED THE VISITATION RATE TO EARLY-STAGE FLOWERS ON THE SAME PLANT. BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL BUMBLE BEES SWITCH FREQUENTLY BETWEEN NECTAR ROBBING AND POLLEN COLLECTION, THE NECTAR REWARD IN MATURE FLOWERS MAY ACT AS A KEY ENTICEMENT TO POLLINATORS, WHICH THEN ENHANCE PLANT REPRODUCTION BY LEGITIMATELY VISITING EARLY-STAGE FLOWERS.

NOTABLE AMONG THESE IS AN APPARENT REVERSAL OF PERIANTH TUBE LENGTH FROM EXTREMELY LONG TO SHORT, A SHIFT CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE FROM POLLINATION BY LONG-TONGUED FLIES AND SPHINX MOTHS TO POLLINATION BY BEES AND NOCTUID MOTHS. ANOTHER UNUSUAL CHANGE IS A SHIFT IN FLORAL ORGANIZATION FROM ZYGOMORPHY TO ACTINOMORPHY CORRELATED WITH AN ACAULESCENT GROWTH FORM. THE RECONSTRUCTED PHYLOGENY IS USED HERE TO ASSESS CHARACTER EVOLUTION AND PATTERNS OF SPECIATION BY COMPARISON OF SPECIES IN TERMINAL CLADES IN THE CLADOGRAMS. THE RESULTING COMPARISONS SUGGEST THAT SPECIATION IN THE SUBGENUS IS EITHER-ALLOPATRIC OR THE RESULT OF MICROGEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENTIATION AND ECOLOGICAL DIVERSIFICATION STIMULATED BY EDAPHIC DIVERSITY. DESPITE THE VARIETY OF FLORAL FORMS AND POLLINATION SYNDROMES IN THE SUBGENUS THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SYMPATRIC OR POLLINATOR-DRIVEN SPECIATION. PREPOLLINATION REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION APPEARS TO BE ACHIEVED BY SHIFTS IN POLLINATION SYNDROMES BETWEEN SPHINX MOTHS, TWO GUILDS OF LONG-TONGUED FLIES, AND BEES. THE REMARKABLE FLORAL DIVERGENCE THAT HAS RESULTED APPEARS TO BE A CONSEQUENCE OF SELECTION FOR REPEATED ENTRY INTO PREEXISTING POLLINATION GUILDS. THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE POLLINATION GUILDS ARE TWO LONG-TONGUED AY GUILDS IN WHICH EITHER PROSOECA (NEMESTRINIDAE) OR MOEGISTORHYNCHUS (NEMESTRINIDAE) AND PHILOLICHE (TABANIDAE) ARE POLLINATORS.

HARDER LD;WILSON WG,HARDER LD,THEORETICAL CONSEQUENCES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS FOR POLLEN DISPERSAL BY ANIMALS,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"POLLINATION GOVERNS A PLANT'S MATING OPTIONS BY ESTABLISHING THE DIVERSITY AND INTENSITY OF MALE-GAMETE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PLANTS. FOR ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS, THE PATTERN OF POLLEN DISPERSAL ARISES FROM THE POLLINATOR'S INTERACTIONS WITH FLORAL ORGANS DURING EACH FLOWER VISIT AND WITH THE POLLEN IT CARRIES DURING TRANSPORT. THESE INTERACTIONS TYPICALLY CAUSE SOME PORTIONS OF A FLOWER'S POLLEN TO EXPERIENCE DIFFERENT TRANSPORT CONDITIONS THAN OTHER PORTIONS. WE MODEL THREE CLASSES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS TO ASSESS THEIR EFFECTS ON POLLEN DISPERSAL. TWO CLASSES OCCUR WHEN THE POLLEN CARRIED BY INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS BECOMES SPATIALLY STRUCTURED. ``HORIZONTAL STRUCTURE ARISES WHEN AREAS OF A POLLINATOR'S BODY DIFFER IN THEIR FREQUENCY OR INTENSITY OF CONTACT WITH ANTHERS AND/OR STIGMAS. ALTERNATIVELY, ``VERTICAL STRUCTURE DEVELOPS WHEN POLLINATORS DO NOT DISTURB THEIR POLLEN LOAD, CAUSING POLLEN TO ACCUMULATE ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY IN LAYERS, SO THAT MUCH POLLEN IS TEMPORARILY INACCESSIBLE TO STIGMAS. THE THIRD CLASS OF HETEROGENEITY OCCURS WHEN THE POLLINATORS THAT VISIT A FLOWER DIFFER CONSISTENTLY WITH RESPECT TO POLLEN TRANSFER FROM POLLINATOR TO STIGMAS. THESE CLASSES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT PRODUCE SIMILAR MEAN PATTERNS OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, WHICH DIFFER FROM THAT EXPECTED IF TRANSPORTED POLLEN ACTS AS A HOMOGENEOUS POPULATION. IN PARTICULAR, NEAR AND FAR RECIPIENT FLOWERS RECEIVE PROPORTIONATELY MORE OF THE DONOR POLLEN REACHING STIGMAS THAN PREDICTED FOR A SINGLE POPULATION. REANALYSIS OF DATA IN THE LITERATURE ILLUSTRATES THAT PREDICTIONS BASED ON HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS ARE MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF OBSERVED DISPERSAL PATTERNS THAN PREDICTIONS OF THE TRADITIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF POLLEN DISPERSAL. WE ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT STOCHASTIC VARIATION BETWEEN FLOWERS IN POLLEN DONATION AND RECEIPT DOES NOT AFFECT THE ARITHMETIC MEAN PATTERN OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, ALTHOUGH IT DOES REDUCE THE GEOMETRIC MEAN. ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HETEROGENEOUS TRANSPORT CONDITIONS PRODUCE SIMILAR MEAN PATTERNS OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, THE INFLUENCES OF SPECIFIC FLORAL AND POLLINATOR CHARACTERISTICS ON DISPERSAL CAN DEPEND ON THE TYPE(S) OF HETEROGENEITY INVOLVED. IN PARTICULAR, PISTIL CHARACTERISTICS SHOULD AFFECT DISPERSAL INDEPENDENTLY OF STAMEN CHARACTERISTICS WHEN HORIZONTAL HETEROGENEITY GOVERNS TRANSPORT DYNAMICS, BUT NOT WHEN POLLEN ACCUMULATES IN LAYERS.

TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF MALE-BIASED SELECTION IN DIOECIOUS WURMBEA DIOICA, WE EXAMINED SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN FLOWER SIZE AND NUMBER AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE TRAITS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF MALE AND FEMALE PLANTS. MALES PRODUCED MORE AND LARGER FLOWERS THAN DID FEMALES. BEES AND BUTTERFLIES RESPONDED TO THIS DIMORPHISM AND VISITED MALES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN FEMALES, ALTHOUGH FLIES DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE SEXES. WITHIN SEXES, INSECT POLLINATORS MADE MORE VISITS TO AND VISITED MORE FLOWERS ON PLANTS WITH MANY FLOWERS. HOWEVER, VISITS PER FLOWER DID NOT VARY WITH FLOWER NUMBER, INDICATING THAT VISITATION WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER PLANT. WHEN FLOWER NUMBER WAS EXPERIMENTALLY HELD CONSTANT, VISITATION INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE UNDER SUNNY BUT NOT OVERCAST CONDITIONS. FLOWER SIZE BUT NOT NUMBER AFFECTED POLLEN REMOVAL PER FLOWER IN MALES AND DEPOSITION IN FEMALES. IN MALES, POLLEN REMOVAL INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE 3 DAYS AFTER FLOWERS OPENED, BUT NOT AFTER 6 DAYS WHEN 98\% OF POLLEN WAS REMOVED. MALES WITH LARGER FLOWERS THEREFORE, MAY HAVE HIGHER FITNESS NOT BECAUSE POLLEN REMOVAL IS MORE COMPLETE, BUT BECAUSE POLLEN IS REMOVED MORE RAPIDLY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO PREEMPT OVULES. IN FEMALES, POLLEN DEPOSITION INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE 3 DAYS BUT NOT 6 DAYS AFTER FLOWERS OPENED. AT BOTH TIMES, DEPOSITION EXCEEDED OVULE PRODUCTION BY FOUR-FOLD OR MORE, AND FOR 2 YEARS SEED PRODUCTION WAS NOT LIMITED BY POLLEN. FLOWER SIZE HAD NO EFFECT ON SEED PRODUCTION PER PLANT AND WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PERCENT SEED SET, IMPLYING A TRADEOFF BETWEEN ALLOCATION TO ATTRACTION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS.

THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGH MOUNTAINS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA, SPAIN, OVER FOUR YEARS (1988-1991). WE SELECTED THREE POPULATIONS OF H. SPINOSA LOCATED ALONG A WIDE ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT. THIS PLANT SPECIES WAS VISITED DURING THE FOUR YEARS OF THE STUDY BY AT LEAST 70 SPECIES OF INSECTS BELONGING TO FIVE ORDERS AND 19 FAMILIES. THE ASSEMBLAGE OF FLORAL VISITORS OF H. SPINOSA WAS COMPOSED MAINLY OF ANTS AND DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SOLITARY BEES AND FLIES, ALTHOUGH MOST POLLINATORS WERE COMPARATIVELY RARE. THERE WERE STRIKING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MOST POLLINATOR SPECIES IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF FLIGHT DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE FLOWERS, WHICH WERE LEPTOKURTIC AND HIGHLY SKEWED. MOREOVER, ALMOST ALL VISITORS ACTED AS POLLINATORS, DEPOSITING POLLEN GRAINS ENOUGH FOR SEED PRODUCTION. INSECTS VISITING FLOWERS OF H. SPINOSA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GUILDS: NECTARIVORES (SMALL FLIES AND ANTS) AND POLLINIVORES (BEES AND HOVERFLIES), WHICH DIFFER IN POLLINATION ATTRIBUTES. FLOWER-VISITATION RATES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE FASTER POLLINIVORES AND THE SLOWER NECTARIVORES.

STRICKLER E;VINSON JW,STRICKLER E,SIMULATION OF THE EFFECT OF POLLINATOR MOVEMENT ON ALFALFA SEED SET,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,ENVIRON. ENTOMOL.,"USING ALFALFA GROWN FOR SEED, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SEED SET FOR A AWED NUMBER OF POLLINATIONS IS LOWER WHEN THE STANDING CROP OF OPEN FLOWERS IS HIGH THAN WHEN IT IS LOW. THIS COULD OCCUR IF POLLINATORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE BETWEEN FLOWERS ON THE SAME PLANT, CAUSING SELF-POLLINATION, WHEN FLOWERS ARE ABUNDANT. THE HYPOTHESIS HAS PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION BECAUSE SELF-POLLINATIONS PRODUCE FEWER SEEDS PER POD THAN DO CROSS-POLLINATIONS IN ALFALFA. WE SIMULATED SEED SET IN A MODEL THAT INCLUDED PUBLISHED MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE, MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA (F.) (HYMENOPTERA: MEGACHILIDAE), AND ESTIMATES OF SEED SET WHEN A SERIES OF FLOWERS ON THE SAME GIANT ARE HAND POLLINATED. SEED SET FROM A FIXED NUMBER OF POLLINATIONS AVERAGED ONLY APPROXIMATE TO6-7\% HIGHER WHEN STANDING CROP WAS LOW THAN WHEN STANDING CROP WAS HIGH. THIS SMALL INCREASE IN SEED SET WOULD HE DIFFICULT TO DETECT EXPERIMENTALLY BECAUSE OF HIGH VARIABILITY BETWEEN PLANTS. M. ROTUNDATA APPEARS TO MOVE WITH A 56\% PROBABILITY OF LEAVING A GIVEN RACEME AND A GIVEN PLANT: THIS FORAGING BEHAVIOR RESULTS IN FEW FLOWERS VISITED PER PLANT. A POLLINATOR WITH A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF LEAVING RACEMES AND PLAN TS COULD SET SLIGHTLY MORE SEED THAN M. ROTUNDATA, WHEREAS A POLLINATOR WITH A LOWER PROBABILITY OF LEAVING RACEMES AND PLANTS WOULD BE MORE AFFECTED BY NEWER STANDING CROP THAN IS M. ROTUNDATA. THE DISTRIBUTION OF FLOWERS VISITED PER RACEME BY BEES IN ALFALFA CAN BE PREDICTED BY SUPERIMPOSING THE MOVEMENT PROBABILITY ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF OPEN FLOWERS PER RACEME.

WITHIN THE GENUS GREVILLEA, MATING SYSTEMS ARE POTENTIALLY COMPLEX. THEY MAY VARY AMONG SPECIES AND AMONG POPULATIONS WITHIN A SPECIES, REFLECTING VARIATION IN POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR AND DIVERSITY ('POTENTIAL' MATING SYSTEMS) AND IN BREEDING SYSTEM (THE `PREFERRED' MATING SYSTEM). WE USED A COMBINATION OF POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS, POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS AND ELECTROPHORETIC ANALYSIS OF SEED FROM OPEN POLLINATIONS, TO EXAMINE VARIATION IN POTENTIAL AND PREFERRED MATING SYSTEMS IN TWO POPULATIONS OF EACH OF TWO `SPIDER-FLOWERED' GREVILLEA SPECIES: G. MUCRONULATA (VISITED BY HONEYEATERS AND HONEYBEES, ALTHOUGH ONLY BIRDS EFFECTED POLLEN REMOVAL AND TRANSFER) AND G. SPHACELATA (VISITED ONLY BY HONEYBEES, WHICH MADE FREQUENT CONTACT WITH POLLEN AND STIGMAS). ALMOST ALL OBSERVED BIRD AND INSECT FORAGING BOUTS ON EITHER SPECIES INVOLVED MOVEMENTS AMONG INFLORESCENCES WITHIN PLANTS OR AMONG INFLORESCENCES ON CLOSELY NEIGHBOURING PLANTS. ON THE BASIS OF THESE DATA, THE MATING SYSTEM WAS PREDICTED TO INVOLVE A HIGH LEVEL OF SELFING OR INBREEDING. HOWEVER, THE POLLINATION EXPERIMENT REVEALED THAT BOTH SPECIES WERE HIGHLY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND SHOWED A CLEAR PREFERENCE FOR OUTCROSS POLLEN IN MATE-CHOICE EXPERIMENTS. FOR BOTH SPECIES, FRUIT SET THROUGH AUTOGAMY WAS LOWER THAN 0.7\% AND FRUIT SET FROM SELF-POLLINATIONS WAS ALWAYS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN FOR OUTCROSS POLLINATIONS (0-11\% CF. 25-33\% FOR G. MUCRONULATA AND 0\% CF. 4.2-8.8\% FOR G. SPHACELATA). ALLOZYME STUDIES REVEALED THAT GENOTYPES IN OPEN-POLLINATED SEEDS ON 20 G. MUCRONULATA AND 20 G. SPHACELATA PLANTS WERE SURPRISINGLY UNIFORM, BEST EXPLAINED BY OUTCROSSED MATINGS BETWEEN CLOSE NEIGHBOURS. WE FOUND LITTLE BETWEEN-POPULATION VARIATION IN ANY ASPECT OF THE MATING SYSTEM FOR EITHER SPECIES.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF LOGGING IN THAILAND AND FOREST FRAGMENTATION IN COSTA RICA ON THE POLLINATION AND SEED PRODUCTION OF TWO SELF-INCOMPATIBLE FOREST TREES. LOGGING IN A DRY DECIDUOUS DIPTEROCARP FOREST IN THAILAND RESULTED IN REDUCED DENSITIES OF THE COMMON DIPTEROCARP TREE SHOREA SIAMENSIS AND VARIABLY ISOLATED INDIVIDUAL TREES. THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS TO S. SIAMENSIS BY POLLINATING TRIGONA BEES WAS NOT AFFECTED BY LOGGING DISTURBANCE. HOWEVER, POLLINATORS DID SPEND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME FORAGING IN THE CANOPIES OF ISOLATED TREES WHICH WERE MORE PREVALENT IN LOGGED AREAS WHERE TREE DENSITY HAD BEEN REDUCED. CONSEQUENTLY, AT THE LOGGED SITE FEW CROSS-POLLINATIONS WERE EFFECTED AND FRUIT SET OF S. SIAMENSIS WAS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN AT NEARBY UNLOGGED SITES WHERE DISTANCES BETWEEN FLOWERING CONSPECIFICS WERE SMALLER. REDUCED FRUIT SET HAS LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RECOVERY OF S. SIAMENSIS POPULATIONS IN DISTURBED AREAS, AND LOCAL POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE IS LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED AS REDUCED OUTCROSSING RATES AMONG TREES IN DISTURBED REGIONS RESULTS IN RELATIVELY INBRED SEED. IN COSTA RICA FOREST FRAGMENTATION HAS RESTRICTED THE ONCE WIDESPREAD TREE ANACARDIUM EXCELSUM TO FOREST PATCHES LOCATED IN AN AGRICULTURALLY-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE. AS WITH S. SIAMENSIS, THE ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS, ALSO TRIGONA BEES, IN THE CANOPIES OF A. EXCELSUM WAS LARGELY UNAFFECTED BY FRAGMENT SIZE. NEVERTHELESS, POLLINATION SUCCESS AND SEED PRODUCTION WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FRAGMENT SIZE. WE PROPOSE THAT SMALL BEES RARELY MOVE BETWEEN FOREST FRAGMENTS AND GENE EXCHANGE THROUGH POLLINATION OCCURS PREDOMINANTLY AMONG TREES WITHIN FRAGMENTS AND, TOGETHER WITH LIKELY LOW GENETIC VARIABILITY IN SMALL FRAGMENTS, THAT THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OBSERVED REDUCED FERTILISATION AND SEED SET OF A. EXCELSUM. THUS INCREASED TREE ISOLATION TREE THROUGH SELECTIVE LOGGING OR HABITAT FRAGMENTATION BY FOREST CLEARANCE CAN RESULT IN REDUCED SEED SET DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FORAGING PATTERNS OF POORLY MOBILE POLLINATORS. EVEN IF POPULATION SIZES OF THE POLLINATORS ARE MAINTAINED FOLLOWING ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATION, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT DISTURBANCE MAY DISRUPT POLLINATION PROCESSES THROUGH CHANGES IN POLLINATOR FORAGING BEHAVIOUR.

ECHIUM WILDPRETII IS A MONOCARPIC PERENNIAL, PRODUCING A 2-3 M COLUMN-SHAPED, RED-FLOWERED, NECTAR-RICH INFLORESCENCE. ALTHOUGH THESE FLORAL TRAITS HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SUGGESTED AS BEING TYPICAL OF ORNITHOPHILOUS FLOWERS, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY REPORTING OBSERVATIONS OF NATIVE BIRDS (PHYLLOSCOPUS COLLYBITA AND SERINUS CANARIUS) IN ADDITION TO INSECTS VISITING THE FLOWERS FOR NECTAR. THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE FIRSTLY TO, INVESTIGATE LEVELS OF VISITATION BY NATIVE BIRDS, NATIVE INSECTS, AND INTRODUCED HONEY BEES. SECONDLY, WE STUDIED THE INFLUENCE OF FLORAL DISPLAY (PLANT HEIGHT AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS), NEAREST NEIGHBOURS (DISTANCE AND SIZE) AND LOCAL VEGETATION STRUCTURE ON VISITATION RATE. FINALLY, WE DISCUSS THE EVOLUTION OF ORNITHOPHILY IN AN OTHERWISE ENTOMOPHILOUS PLANT LINEAGE. WE FOUND THAT THE LEVEL OF BIRD VISITATION WAS RELATIVELY HIGH EARLY IN THE FLOWERING SEASON, BUT DECREASED IN MID/LATE SEASON, WHILE THE OPPOSITE PATTERN WAS FOUND FOR INTRODUCED HONEY BEES. FOR NATIVE INSECTS, THE FREQUENCY OF VISITS WAS SIMILAR IN EARLY AND LATE SEASON. BIRD VISITS WERE CORRELATED WITH FLORAL DISPLAY. IN THE EARLY SEASON, VISITATION RATES OF HONEY BEES AND THE TWO MOST COMMON NATIVE BEE SPECIES WERE CORRELATED WITH SIZE OF THE PLANT OR ITS NEAREST NEIGHBOURS, CONSISTENT WITH PREFERENCE PATTERNS FOR LARGER RESOURCE PATCHES.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITIONS TO DIM-LIGHT FORAGING (PREDAWN MATINAL, CREPUSCULAR, NOCTURNAL) HAVE OCCURRED REPEATEDLY IN BEES, AND MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ESCAPE FROM ENEMIES OR COMPETITORS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, LITTLE INFORMATION HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES. HERE WE PROVIDE THE FIRST DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE NESTING BEHAVIOUR OF TWO SPECIES OF NEOTROPICAL, NOCTURNAL SWEAT BEES, MEGALOPTA GENALIS AND M. ECUADORIA (HYMENOPTERA: HALICTIDAE). FEMALES ARE FACULTATIVELY SOCIAL OR SOLITARY, AND CONSTRUCT NESTS IN DEAD WOOD. NOCTURNAL FORAGING BEHAVIOUR IS BIMODAL. BEES BEGAN FORAGING AFTER SUNSET (SIMILAR TO18:30 H) AND CEASED FORAGING APPROXIMATELY 1 H LATER EVEN THOUGH NOCTURNAL FLOWERS WITH POLLEN WERE STILL ABUNDANT, A SECOND FORAGING BOUT OCCURRED IN THE PREDAWN MORNING, WHICH BEGAN AT SIMILAR TO04:45 H AND ENDED AROUND SUNRISE (SIMILAR TO06:15 H) WHEN DIURNAL-BLOOMING FLOWERS WERE ABUNDANT. BEES ARE CAPABLE OF CONTROLLED FLIGHT IN FULL LIGHT. THEY UTILIZED POLLEN FROM BOTH CANOPY AND UNDERSTORY PLANT SPECIES, WHICH HAVE DIURNAL OR NOCTURNAL POLLEN ANTHESIS. MEGALOPTA NESTS ARE ATTACKED BY GENERALIST PREDATORS SUCH AS ANTS, AS WELL AS THE ENDOPARASITIC FLY MELALONCHA SP. NOV.

ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX NESTS OF 11 BEE SPECIES WERE COLLECTED IN THE FOREST, AND 121 NESTS OF SEVEN SPECIES WERE COLLECTED IN THE CAATINGA. FIVE SPECIES OF CLEPTOPARASITIC BEES WERE ALSO REARED FROM THESE NESTS. THE HIGHEST NESTING FREQUENCIES OCCURRED IN THE WET SEASON IN BOTH AREAS. NESTS PARASITISM WAS IMPORTANT ONLY FOR CENTRIS TARSATA SMITH, 1874, AND WAS HIGHER AT THE CAATINGA SITE THAN IN THE FOREST. THE MORTALITY OF PRE-EMERGENT ADULTS WAS HIGH, ESPECIALLY IN C TARSATA, TETRAPEDID DIVERSIPES KLUG, 1810 AND EUGLOSSO CORDATA (LINNAEUS, 1758).

THE NUMBER OF FRUITS INCREASED, DIFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.01) BETWEEN BAGGED FLOWERS (BF=25\%), FLOWERS THAT RECEIVED ONE VISIT (V=79\%) AND THOSE WITH UNRESTRICTED VISITS (UV=86\%). LIKEWISE THE NUMBERS OF SEEDS AND THE FERTILIZATION INDEX DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN TREATMENTS (P < 0.01). IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT, THE EFFICIENCY OF THE STINGLESS BEE NANNOTRIGONA PERILAMPOIDES (SB) FOR POLLINATING THIS CROP WAS EVALUATED. THE QUALITY OF THE FRUIT AND THE PRODUCTION IN KG/M(2) WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN SB AND MECHANICAL VIBRATION (MV) BUT THE LATTER SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER VALUES IN THE POLAR DIAMETER, WEIGHT AND NUMBER OF SEED PER FRUIT (P < 0.01).

DIFFERENCES IN ANTHER-WALL QUALITIES (MULTI-LAYERED AND RIGID V. SINGLE-LAYERED AND FLEXIBLE) WERE CORRELATED WITH SHIFTS BETWEEN VIBRATORY AND PNEUMATIC MECHANISMS. THE SPECIES PRESENTED DIFFERENT EXPLOITATION MECHANISMS FOR BEES TO OBTAIN THEIR POLLEN.

HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT CORRELATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN STRUCTURAL ANTHER FEATURES. THE POLLINATION SYNDROME WAS RELATED ONLY TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF POLLEN PER FLOWER, WHICH WAS LARGER IN THE POLLEN FLOWERS. WE PROPOSE THAT THE PNEUMATIC MECHANISMS MAY HAVE PLAYED A ROLE SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE VIBRATORY MECHANISM AS AN UNCLOGGING DEVICE OR AS A MEANS OF INCREASING MALE FITNESS BY THE PATTERN OF POLLEN DISTRIBUTION.

VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES IS SHORT, GROWS ON PEBBLY OR SANDY SOIL, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA IS ARBORESCENT, GROWS ON ROCK OUTCROPS, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS. BOTH ARE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND HAVE A SHORT, MASSIVE FLOWERING STRATEGY. THE STUDY AIMED TO ASSOCIATE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE WITH THEIR MICROHABITAT DISTRIBUTION AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY. CENTER DOT METHODS LEAVES FROM 106 AND 139 PLANTS OF V. EPIDENDROIDES AND V. LEPTOPETALA, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLECTED FROM FIVE PATCHES OF EACH SPECIES AND PREPARED FOR ELECTROPHORETIC ANALYSES. CENTER DOT KEY RESULTS FIVE ENZYME SYSTEMS COULD BE RELIABLY SCORED FOR BOTH SPECIES. VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES SHOWED 100 \% OF THE LOCI POLYMORPHIC FOR ALMOST ALL PATCHES. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ALLELES PER LOCUS RANGED BETWEEN 2.2 AND 2.4 AMONG PATCHES. THE WRIGHT'S FIXATION INDEX (F) FOR THIS SPECIES WAS 0.226. A SIGNIFICANT THETA(P) VALUE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE GENETIC DIVERGENCE AMONG PATCHES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA PRESENTED 47.5 \% OF POLYMORPHIC LOCI. ALL LEVELS OF P, A, A(P) AND OF HETEROZYGOSITIES WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF V. EPIDENDROIDES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA SHOWED HIGH INBREEDING WITHIN PATCHES.

ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOW VALUES OF GENETIC DIVERSITY FOUND FOR V. LEPTOPETALA MAY BE RELATED TO PHYSICAL ISOLATION ON OUTCROPS AND INTENSIVE FORAGING BY TERRITORIAL HUMMINGBIRDS, WHICH MAY HINDER GENE FLOW AMONG PATCHES, AGGRAVATED BY THE VERY RESTRICTED SEED DISPERSAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GENUS, THAT FACILITATES SIBLING MATING.

CONSERV.,"BEES ARE BELIEVED TO BE IN DECLINE ACROSS MANY OF THE WORLD'S ECOSYSTEMS. RECENT STUDIES ON BRITISH BUMBLEBEES PROPOSED ALTERNATIVE THEORIES TO EXPLAIN DECLINES. ONE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT GREATER DIETARY SPECIALIZATION AMONG THE RARER BUMBLEBEE SPECIES MAKES THEM MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DECLINE. A SECOND STUDY DISPUTED THIS THEORY AND FOUND THAT DECLINES IN BRITISH BUMBLEBEES WERE CORRELATED WITH THE SIZE OF SPECIES' EUROPEAN RANGES, LEADING TO THE SUGGESTION THAT CLIMATE AND HABITAT SPECIALIZATION MAY BE BETTER INDICATORS OF THE RISK OF DECLINE. HERE WE USE A NEW AND INDEPENDENT DATASET BASED ON IRISH BUMBLEBEES TO TEST THE GENERALITY OF THESE THEORIES. WE FOUND THAT MOST OF THE SAME BUMBLEBEE SPECIES ARE DECLINING ACROSS THE BRITISH ISLES, BUT THAT, WITHIN IRELAND, A SIMPLE FOOD-PLANT SPECIALIZATION MODEL IS INADEQUATE TO EXPLAIN THESE DECLINES. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DECLINES IN IRISH BUMBLEBEES AND THE SIZE OF SPECIES' EUROPEAN RANGES. HOWEVER, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE LATE EMERGING SPECIES HAVE DECLINED IN IRELAND (AND IN BRITAIN), AND THAT THESE SPECIES SHOW A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WESTWARD SHIFT TO THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR RANGE, PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF CHANGING LAND USE. IRISH DATA SUPPORT THE FINDING THAT RARE AND DECLINING BUMBLEBEES ARE LATER NESTING SPECIES, ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN GRASSY HABITATS. WE SUGGEST THAT THE WIDESPREAD REPLACEMENT OF HAY WITH SILAGE IN THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, WHICH RESULTS IN EARLIER AND MORE FREQUENT MOWING AND A REDUCTION IN LATE SUMMER WILDFLOWERS, HAS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN BUMBLEBEE DECLINES.

INT.,"MELIPONA QUADRIFASCIATA AND MELIPONA RUFIVENTRIS ARE STINGLESS BEE SPECIES WHICH PRESENT LOW AND HIGH HETEROCHROMATIN CONTENT, RESPECTIVELY, ON THEIR MITOTIC CHROMOSOMES AS ASSESSED VISUALLY AFTER A C-BANDING ASSAY. HOWEVER, THESE SPECIES DO NOT SHOW DIFFERENCES IN THE C-BANDING RESPONSES OF THEIR MALPIGHIAN TUBULE INTERPHASE NUCLEI. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE FEULGEN-DNA RESPONSE, WHICH COULD INFORM ON DIFFERENCES IN DNA DEPURINATION DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN CHROMATIN CONDENSATION, WAS COMPARED IN THE CELL NUCLEI OF THE MALPIGHIAN TUBULES OF THESE SPECIES. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT DIFFERENCES IN ACID HYDROLYSIS KINETICS PATTERNS, AS ASSESSED BY FEULGEN REACTION AND STUDIED MICROSPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY, COULD DISCRIMINATE M. QUADRIFASCIATA AND M. RUFIVENTRIS INTERPHASE NUCLEI NOT DISTINGUISHABLE WITH THE C-BANDING METHOD. FEULGEN-DNA VALUES CORRESPONDING TO MORE THAN ONE PLOIDY CLASS WERE FOUND IN BOTH SPECIES, THESE VALUES AT THE HYDROLYSIS TIME CORRESPONDING TO THE MAXIMAL DNA DEPURINATION FOR EACH PLOIDY DEGREE WERE HIGHER IN M. QUADRIFASCIATA, REFLECTING A HIGHER DNA CONTENT IN THE MALPIGHIAN TUBULE CELL NUCLEI OF THIS SPECIES COMPARED TO THOSE OF M. RUFIVENTRIS AT THE SAME LARVAL INSTAR. THE MAXIMAL FEULGEN-DNA VALUES OF M. QUADRIFASCIATA AFTER SHORT (50 MIN) AND LONG (90 MIN) HYDROLYSIS TIMES WERE FOUND TO BE CLOSER TO EACH OTHER, WHILE THOSE OF M. RUFIVENTRIS OCCURRED SHARPLY AT THE LONG HYDROLYSIS TIME, INDICATING THAT DNA DEPURINATION IN M. QUADRIFASCIATA OCCURRED FASTER. THIS RESULT IS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF DIFFERENCES IN CHROMATIN CONDENSATION, IT AGREES WITH THE IDEA THAT M. RUFIVENTRIS CONTAINS MORE HETEROCHROMATIN THAN M. QUADRIFASCIATA, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE IMAGE ANALYSIS PARAMETER AVERAGE ABSORPTION RATIO. THE DEPURINATION KINETICS STUDIED HERE WITH THE FEULGEN REACTION WERE REVEALED TO BE MORE PERTINENT THAN THE C-BANDING TECHNIQUE IN ESTABLISHING DIFFERENCES IN LEVELS OF CHROMATIN CONDENSATION FOR THESE CELL NUCLEI.

SCI. BULL.,"ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES SURROUNDING TRANSGENIC OILSEED RAPE CULTIVATION IS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF GM GENES ENTERING NEIGHBORING NON-GM OILSEED RAPE PLANTS, RELATED WEEDS OR CLOSELY RELATED WILD RELATIVES. FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF A CASE-BY-CASE FOR TRANSGENIC CROP SAFETY ASSESSMENT, WE DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW FROM HERBICIDE-RESISTANT TRANSGENIC OILSEED RAPE TO CHINESE COMMERCIAL VARIETIES. THE POLLEN DISPERSAL WAS DETECTED AS THE PROGENY OF RECIPIENT PLANTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS GLUFOSINATE RESISTANT. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT POLLEN DISPERSAL OCCURRED UP TO 2000 M AND ITS RATE SHARPLY DECREASED AS THE DISTANCE FROM THE POLLEN SOURCE INCREASED. HOWEVER, THE RATE OF LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN DISPERSAL FROM 33 TO 2000 M WAS LESS THAN 0.015\% AND DID NOT PRESENT A GRADUAL DECREASE, INDICATING THE RANDOMIZATION OF DISPERSAL AND POLLINATION. MOST POLLEN DISPERSED WITHIN A 4.5 M AREA AROUND THE TRANSGENIC POLLEN SOURCE PLOT, WITH A MAXIMUM OF 1.19\% AT THE SAMPLING SITE OF 1.4 M. WIND DIRECTION SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED THE DIRECTION AND THE DISTANCE OF POLLEN DISPERSAL, RESULTING IN THE MORE AND FARTHER DISPERSAL IN SOUTHWEST DIRECTION. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY POLLINATING BEES WAS NOT CORRELATED WITH DIRECTION AND DISTANCE FROM THE POLLEN SOURCE PLOT, SUGGESTING THAT BEE DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION WOULD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN POLLEN DISPERSAL AMONG DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THIS PAPER IS THE FIRST REPORT ON RESEARCH IN A LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENT OF POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW UNDER THE CHINA'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PROVIDED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVE COMMERCIALIZATION OF TRANSGENIC OILSEED RAPE AND ITS SAFE MANAGEMENT.

THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ELUCIDATE THE NEST-TO-NEST DISPERSAL MECHANISMS OF C. KROMBEINI HYPOPI. WE TESTED THREE POTENTIAL DISPERSAL MECHANISMS OF C. KROMBEINI OTHER THAN PHORESY BY O.

CONSEQUENTLY, POLLINATORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER PREDATORS WHEN VISITING THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS. I PRESENT A MODEL OF HOW DIFFERENT POLLINATOR SPECIES CAN MAXIMIZE LIFETIME RESOURCE GAINS DEPENDING ON THE DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF PREDATORS, AS WELL AS THEIR VULNERABILITY TO CAPTURE BY PREDATORS. FOR POLLINATOR SPECIES THAT ARE DIFFICULT FOR PREDATORS TO CAPTURE, THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY IS TO VISIT THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS AS LONG AS PREDATOR DENSITY IS LOW. AT HIGHER PREDATOR DENSITIES AND FOR POLLINATORS THAT ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO PREDATOR CAPTURE, THE LIFETIME RESOURCE GAIN FROM THE MOST REWARDING FLOWERS DECLINES AND THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY DEPENDS ON THE PREDATOR DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME CASES, A WIDE RANGE OF FLORAL REWARDS PROVIDES NEAR-MAXIMUM LIFETIME RESOURCE GAINS, WHICH MAY FAVOR GENERALIZATION IF SEARCHING FOR FLOWERS IS COSTLY. IN OTHER CASES, A LOW FLOWER REWARD LEVEL PROVIDES THE MAXIMUM LIFETIME RESOURCE GAIN AND SO POLLINATORS SHOULD SPECIALIZE ON LESS REWARDING FLOWERS. THUS, THE MODEL SUGGESTS THAT PREDATORS CAN HAVE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT TOP-DOWN EFFECTS ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS DEPENDING ON THE POLLINATOR SPECIES, THE DENSITY OF PREDATORS, AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF PREDATORS ACROSS FLOWER REWARD LEVELS.",NA,SPIDERS MISUMENA-VATIA; CRAB-SPIDERS; PHYMATA-AMERICANA; HOST-PLANT; FLOWER; PREY; BEES; THOMISIDAE; CHOICE; SELECTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,20,"JONES, EI (REPRINT AUTHOR), WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA.;JONES, EMILY I., UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUT BIOL, TUCSON, AZ 85721 USA.",10.1111/J.1600-0706.2009.17841.X,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,5,835-840,WILEY-BLACKWELL,119,2010,ISI000276936000011,49,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,52,ECOLOGY,EIJONESWSU.EDU,586TL,"JONES, EI (REPRINT AUTHOR), WASHINGTON STATE UNIV, SCH BIOL SCI, PULLMAN, WA 99164 USA",ISI,none,UNIV ARIZONA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIV,NA,"JONES EI, 2010, OIKOS","JONES EI, 2010, OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA

THE COMPOUNDS WERE TESTED AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM FIELD RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATION (MFRC), AND, WHEN STRONG LETHAL EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED, A DOSE-RESPONSE ASSAY WITH A DILUTION SERIES OF THE MFRC WAS UNDERTAKEN TO CALCULATE LC50 VALUES. RESULTS: FROM THE DIFFERENT ACARICIDE CLASSES, SEVERAL CHEMISTRIES CAUSED HIGH LEVELS OF ACUTE TOXICITY IN BUMBLEBEE WORKERS, ESPECIALLY BIFENTHRIN AND ABAMECTIN WHICH RESULTED IN 100\% MORTALITY BY CONTACT. IN ADDITION, SEVERAL ACARICIDES TESTED WERE FOUND TO HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON DRONE PRODUCTION. FOR ORAL EXPOSURES VIA TREATED SUGAR WATER, THE DOSE-RESPONSE ASSAY SHOWED THE LC50 VALUES FOR ABAMECTIN, BIFENAZATE, BIFENTHRIN AND ETOXAZOLE TO BE 1/15 MFRC (1.17 MG AL L-1), 1/10 MFRC (9.6 MG AL L-1), 1/83 MFRC (0.36 MG AL L-1) AND 1/13 MFRC (4.4 MG AL L-1) RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING THAT THEIR USE SHOULD BE CAREFULLY EVALUATED. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOST OF THE ACARICIDES TESTED ARE COMPATIBLE WITH BUMBLEBEES, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF ABAMECTIN, BIFENAZATE, BIFENTHRIN AND ETOXAZOLE. HOWEVER, THE RISKS ALSO DEPENDED ON THE TYPE OF TREATMENT. AS A RESULT, THE SUGAR WATER TREATMENT SEEMS TO PRESENT THE WORST-CASE SITUATION OF EXPOSURE, INDICATING THAT THIS APPROACH IS SUITABLE FOR DETERMINING THE HAZARDS OF PESTICIDES AGAINST BUMBLEBEES. FINALLY, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT FUTURE TIER TESTING UNDER MORE FIELD-RELATED CONDITIONS IS REQUIRED FOR A FINAL DECISION OF THEIR RISKS.

CONSERV.,"THE ABILITY TO PREDICT THE RESPONSES OF ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUAL SPECIES TO HUMAN-INDUCED ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE REMAINS A KEY ISSUE FOR ECOLOGISTS AND CONSERVATION MANAGERS ALIKE. RESPONSES ARE OFTEN VARIABLE AMONG SPECIES WITHIN GROUPS MAKING GENERAL PREDICTIONS DIFFICULT. ONE OPTION IS TO INCLUDE ECOLOGICAL TRAIT INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP TO DISENTANGLE PATTERNS OF RESPONSE AND ALSO PROVIDE GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW PARTICULAR TRAITS LINK WHOLE CLADES TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH THIS ``TRAIT-GUILD APPROACH HAS BEEN USED FOR SINGLE DISTURBANCES, THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTICULAR TRAITS ON GENERAL RESPONSES TO MULTIPLE DISTURBANCES HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED. WE USED A MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS OF 19 DATA SETS FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO TEST THE EFFECT OF ECOLOGICAL AND LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS ON THE RESPONSES OF BEE SPECIES TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANTHROPOGENIC ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THESE CHANGES INCLUDED HABITAT LOSS, FRAGMENTATION, AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, PESTICIDES AND FIRE. INDIVIDUAL TRAITS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BEE SPECIES RESPONSES TO DIFFERENT DISTURBANCES AND SEVERAL TRAITS WERE BROADLY PREDICTIVE AMONG MULTIPLE DISTURBANCES. THE LOCATION OF NESTS - ABOVE VS. BELOW GROUND - SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED RESPONSE TO HABITAT LOSS, AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, TILLAGE REGIME (WITHIN AGRICULTURE) AND FIRE. SPECIES THAT NESTED ABOVE GROUND WERE ON AVERAGE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY ISOLATION FROM NATURAL HABITAT AND INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LAND USE THAN WERE SPECIES NESTING BELOW GROUND. IN CONTRAST BELOW-GROUND-NESTING SPECIES WERE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY TILLING THAN WERE ABOVE-GROUND NESTERS. THE RESPONSE OF DIFFERENT NESTING GUILDS TO FIRE DEPENDED ON THE TIME SINCE THE BURN. SOCIAL BEE SPECIES WERE MORE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY ISOLATION FROM NATURAL HABITAT AND PESTICIDES THAN WERE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES. SURPRISINGLY, BODY SIZE DID NOT CONSISTENTLY AFFECT SPECIES RESPONSES, DESPITE ITS IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING MANY ASPECTS OF INDIVIDUALS' INTERACTION WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH SYNERGISTIC INTERACTIONS AMONG TRAITS REMAIN TO BE EXPLORED, INDIVIDUAL TRAITS CAN BE USEFUL IN PREDICTING AND UNDERSTANDING RESPONSES OF RELATED SPECIES TO GLOBAL CHANGE.

ECOL.,"THE INCREASING EVIDENCE FOR POPULATION DECLINES IN BUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS) SPECIES WORLDWIDE HAS ACCELERATED RESEARCH EFFORTS TO EXPLAIN LOSSES IN THESE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS. IN NORTH AMERICA, A NUMBER OF ONCE WIDESPREAD BOMBUS SPECIES HAVE SUFFERED SERIOUS REDUCTIONS IN RANGE AND ABUNDANCE, ALTHOUGH OTHER SPECIES REMAIN HEALTHY. TO EXAMINE WHETHER DECLINING AND STABLE SPECIES EXHIBIT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY OR POPULATION FRAGMENTATION, WE USED MICROSATELLITE MARKERS TO GENOTYPE POPULATIONS SAMPLED ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF TWO DECLINING (BOMBUS OCCIDENTALIS AND BOMBUS PENSYLVANICUS) AND FOUR STABLE (BOMBUS BIFARIUS, BOMBUS VOSNESENSKII, BOMBUS IMPATIENS AND BOMBUS BIMACULATUS) BOMBUS SPECIES. POPULATIONS OF DECLINING SPECIES GENERALLY HAVE REDUCED LEVELS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY THROUGHOUT THEIR RANGE COMPARED TO CODISTRIBUTED STABLE SPECIES. GENETIC DIVERSITY CAN BE AFFECTED BY OVERALL RANGE SIZE AND DEGREE OF ISOLATION OF LOCAL POPULATIONS, POTENTIALLY CONFOUNDING COMPARISONS AMONG SPECIES IN SOME CASES. WE FIND NO EVIDENCE FOR CONSISTENT DIFFERENCES IN GENE FLOW AMONG STABLE AND DECLINING SPECIES, WITH ALL SPECIES EXHIBITING WEAK GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OVER LARGE DISTANCES (E.G. >1000 KM). POPULATIONS ON ISLANDS AND AT HIGH ELEVATIONS EXPERIENCE RELATIVELY STRONG GENETIC DRIFT, SUGGESTING THAT SOME CONDITIONS LEAD TO GENETIC ISOLATION IN OTHERWISE WEAKLY DIFFERENTIATED SPECIES. B.SIMILAR TO OCCIDENTALIS AND B.SIMILAR TO BIFARIUS EXHIBIT STRONGER GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION THAN THE OTHER SPECIES, INDICATING GREATER PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR BROADER GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS TOPOGRAPHICALLY COMPLEX REGIONS OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.

HOWEVER, THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ENDEMIC, AND OFTEN SPECIALISED, PLANTS MAY REQUIRE INCREASED ATTENTION AS CLIMATE CHANGE ACCELERATES WORLDWIDE. SPECIES OF ROSCOEA ENDEMIC TO THE HIMALAYAN REGION HAVE STRIKING ORCHID-LIKE FLOWERS WITH LONG COROLLA TUBES, SUGGESTING POLLINATION BY LONG-TONGUED INSECTS.

OVER SEVERAL FLOWERING SEASONS WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY POTENTIAL POLLINATORS WITH LONG TONGUES THAT MATCHED THE COROLLA TUBE VISITING FLOWERS IN CENTRES OF DISTRIBUTION.

IN GENERAL, MEMBERS OF THE GINGER FAMILY ARE CHARACTERISED BY SHORT-LIVED (USUALLY 1 DAY) FLOWERS, BUT FLOWERS OF R. CAUTLEOIDES AND R. HUMEANA LAST 8 AND 6 DAYS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVING STIGMAS DECREASED FRUIT SET IN BOTH STUDY POPULATIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ORIGINAL POLLINATORS MAY HAVE BEEN LONG-TONGUED INSECTS THAT ARE NOW ABSENT FROM THE CHINESE HIMALAYAS BECAUSE HABITATS HAVE RESPONDED TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE GENUS WERE INVESTIGATED AND THE EVOLUTION OF OIL-PRODUCING STRUCTURES RELATED TO SPECIALIZED OIL-BEE POLLINATION EXAMINED. METHODS PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES BASED ON EIGHT MOLECULAR MARKERS OBTAINED FROM 101 SISYRINCHIUM ACCESSIONS REPRESENTING 85 SPECIES WERE CONDUCTED IN THE FIRST EXTENSIVE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE GENUS. TOTAL EVIDENCE ANALYSES CONFIRMED THE MONOPHYLY OF THE GENUS AND RETRIEVED NINE MAJOR CLADES WEAKLY CONNECTED TO THE SUBDIVISIONS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED. THE RESULTING PHYLOGENETIC HYPOTHESIS WAS USED TO RECONSTRUCT BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS, AND TO TRACE THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN OF GLANDULAR TRICHOMES PRESENT IN THE FLOWERS OF SEVERAL SPECIES. KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS GLANDULAR TRICHOMES EVOLVED THREE TIMES INDEPENDENTLY IN THE GENUS. IN TWO CASES, THESE GLANDULAR TRICHOMES ARE OIL-SECRETING, SUGGESTING THAT THE CORRESPONDING FLOWERS MIGHT BE POLLINATED BY OIL-BEES. BIOGEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS INDICATE EXPANSIONS FROM CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE NORTHERN ANDES TO THE SUBANDEAN RANGES BETWEEN CHILE AND ARGENTINA AND TO THE EXTENDED AREA OF THE PARANA RIVER BASIN.

BRODY AK;IRWIN RE,BRODY AK,WHEN RESOURCES DON'T RESCUE: FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND SPECIES INTERACTIONS AFFECT COMPENSATION TO HERBIVORY IN IPOMOPSIS AGGREGATA,OIKOS,OIKOS,"THE ABILITY OF PLANTS TO TOLERATE, OR COMPENSATE FOR, HERBIVORE DAMAGE IS HIGHLY VARIABLE AND HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH RESEARCH. ALTHOUGH MANY PLANTS CAN COMPENSATE FOR HERBIVORE DAMAGE, AND SOME EVEN OVERCOMPENSATE, WE CANNOT YET GENERALIZE ABOUT THE CONDITIONS THAT PROMOTE A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO DAMAGE. HERE, WE ASKED HOW ABIOTIC RESOURCES (I.E. PLANT NUTRIENT STATUS) COUPLED WITH BIOTIC INTERACTIONS I.E. SUBSEQUENT INTERACTIONS WITH POLLINATORS, SEED PREDATORS AND NECTAR ROBBING BUMBLE BEES AFFECT THE COMPENSATORY ABILITY OF IPOMOPSIS AGGREGATA, A MONOCARPIC HERB THAT HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUCH PREVIOUS DEBATE. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT COMPENSATION TO HERBIVORE DAMAGE IN I. AGGREGATA (POLEMONIACEAE) WOULD DEPEND FIRST ON PLANTS HAVING AN AMPLE SUPPLY OF RESOURCES AND, SECOND, ON THE OUTCOME OF SUBSEQUENT INTERACTIONS WITH MUTUALIST POLLINATORS AND ENEMY PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS AND NECTAR ROBBING BUMBLE BEES. WE USED A FULLY-FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT IN WHICH PLANTS WERE WATERED, FERTILIZED OR LEFT AS UNMANIPULATED CONTROLS, CROSSED WITH CLIPPING TO SIMULATE HERBIVORE DAMAGE TO THE APICAL MERISTEM. RESOURCE ADDITION ENHANCED BOTH MALE AND FEMALE COMPONENTS OF FITNESS, BUT RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT DID NOT PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR PLANTS TO FULLY COMPENSATE FOR SIMULATED HERBIVORY. CLIPPED PLANTS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFLORESCENCES, BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF A DELAY IN FLOWERING AND FEWER TOTAL FLOWERS. CLIPPING SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED LOSSES TO DIPTERAN PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS BY DELAYING FLOWERING TIME, BUT EARLY FLOWERING PLANTS PRODUCED HIGHER NUMBERS OF SEEDS DESPITE INCURRING HIGHER RATES OF PREDATION. CLIPPED PLANTS INCURRED A HIGHER RISK TO NECTAR ROBBERS IN ONE OF TWO YEARS. OVERALL, CLIPPED PLANTS SUFFERED SEVERE REDUCTIONS (A NEARLY 50\% REDUCTION IN TOTAL SEED SET) IN FEMALE SUCCESS, BUT CLIPPING COMBINED WITH NUTRIENT ADDITION ENHANCED MALE FUNCTION THROUGH INCREASES IN PER-FLOWER POLLEN PRODUCTION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE CLIPPED PLANTS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER FLOWERS THAN UNCLIPPED PLANTS, WHOLE-PLANT POLLEN PRODUCTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY CLIPPING. POLLINATOR VISITATION AND NECTAR ROBBING WERE VARIABLE BETWEEN CLIPPING TREATMENTS AND BETWEEN YEARS AND (NECTAR ROBBING) AMONG SITES. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE VARIABILITY IN PLANT RESPONSE TO HERBIVORY CAN, AT LEAST IN PART, BE DRIVEN BY PLANT INTERACTIONS WITH MUTUALISTS AND ENEMIES. THUS, ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH INTERACTIONS AND THEIR VARIABILITY IS IMPORTANT TO FULLY UNDERSTANDING PLANT COMPENSATION FOR HERBIVORE DAMAGE AND WILL LIKELY GO FAR TO EXPLAIN VARIATION IN PLANT RESPONSE THAT APPEARS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF RESOURCES.",NA,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; DISPERSAL SEED PREDATION; SCARLET-GILIA; RAPHANUS-RAPHANISTRUM; FITNESS COMPONENTS; MEDIATED SELECTION; FOLIAR HERBIVORY; WILD RADISH; TOLERANCE; DAMAGE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,12,"BRODY, AK (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV VERMONT, DEPT BIOL, BURLINGTON, VT 05405 USA.;BRODY, ALISON K., UNIV VERMONT, DEPT BIOL, BURLINGTON, VT 05405 USA.;IRWIN, REBECCA E., DARTMOUTH COLL, DEPT BIOL, HANOVER, NH 03755 USA.;BRODY, ALISON K., IRWIN, REBECCA E., ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.",10.1111/J.1600-0706.2012.20458.X,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-0089643, DEB-0455348]; DARTMOUTH COLLEGE; DARTMOUTH COLLEGE WOMEN-IN-SCIENCE PROGRAM","WE THANK L.

BOTH DOMESTIC AND WILD BEE POPULATIONS IN CENTRAL WISCONSIN PICKLING CUCUMBER FIELDS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMBINATION OF PAN TRAPPING AND FLORAL OBSERVATIONS BEFORE AND DURING BLOOM. TOGETHER WITH LAND COVER ANALYSES EXTENDING 2,000 M FROM FIELD CENTERS, THE RELATIONSHIP OF LAND COVER COMPONENTS AND BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WERE EXAMINED.

A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN BOTH NONCROP AND HERBACEOUS AREAS WITH BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY ONLY DURING BLOOM. RESPONSE OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY TO LAND COVER WAS STRONGEST AT LARGER BUFFERS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE OF THE HETEROGENEOUS NATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE AND CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN CROP AND NONCROP AREAS.

INSECT BEHAV.,"IN SOCIAL INSECTS, THE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES ADOPTED BY COLONIES EMERGE AS A COMPLEX PROPERTY OF INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOURS, BUT AS YET WE ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO FULLY EXPLAIN THEM IN EVOLUTIONARY TERMS. IN BUMBLEBEES, COLONIES ADOPT EITHER A SHORT-LIVED STRATEGY SPECIALIZING IN MALE PRODUCTION, OR A LONGER-LIVED STRATEGY IN WHICH MAINLY NEW QUEENS ARE PRODUCED, BUT THIS RESULTS IN MALES EMERGING LONG BEFORE MATES ARE AVAILABLE, THIS STRATEGY CAN ONLY EASILY BE EXPLAINED IF OLDER MALES ARE AT A SIGNIFICANT REPRODUCTIVE ADVANTAGE. HERE WE EXAMINE HOW AGE AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS INFLUENCE MATING SUCCESS OF MALE BUMBLEBEES. IN TWO SEPARATE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH SINGLE VIRGIN MALES AND FEMALES WERE CONFINED TOGETHER, WE FOUND THAT YOUNG MALES AND HEAVY MALES MATED MORE SWIFTLY AND COPULATED FOR LESS TIME COMPARED TO OLD MALES OR LIGHTER MALES, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS AGE PROVED TO BE UNIMPORTANT AND THE ONLY FACTORS TO INFLUENCE MATING SUCCESS WERE THE LENGTHS OF THE FORE AND HIND TIBIAE, WITH STRONG DIRECTIONAL SELECTION FOR LONG LEG LENGTH. FORE AND HIND LEGS ARE BOTH USED IN COURTSHIP, SO BOTH TRAITS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDER SELECTION. IT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ARGUED THAT, IN TIMES OF FOOD STRESS, BUMBLEBEE COLONIES SHOULD PRODUCE MALES AS MALE SIZE IS LESS LIKELY TO BE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH FITNESS THAN FEMALE SIZE.

GROOM SVC;STEVENS MI;SCHWARZ MP,GROOM SVC,DIVERSIFICATION OF FIJIAN HALICTINE BEES: INSIGHTS INTO A RECENT ISLAND RADIATION,MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,MOL. PHYLOGENET. EVOL.,"ALTHOUGH BEES FORM A KEY POLLINATOR SUITE FOR FLOWERING PLANTS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EVOLUTIONARY RADIATION OF NON-DOMESTICATED BEES OVER HUMAN TIME-SCALES. THIS IS SURPRISING GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF BEES FOR CROP POLLINATION AND THE EFFECT OF HUMANS IN TRANSFORMING ECOSYSTEMS VIA AGRICULTURE. IN THE PACIFIC, WHERE THE BEE FAUNA APPEARS DEPAUPERATE, THEIR IMPORTANCE AS POLLINATORS IS NOT CLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN FIJI WHERE SPECIES DIVERSITY IS EVEN LOWER THAN NEIGHBOURING ARCHIPELAGOS. HERE WE EXPLORE THE RADIATION OF HALICTINE BEES IN FIJI USING PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES OF MTDNA COI SEQUENCE DATA. OUR ANALYSES INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL `DEEP' CLADES WHOSE DIVERGENCES ARE CLOSE TO THE CROWN NODE, ALONG WITH A HIGHLY DERIVED `BROOM' CLADE SHOWING VERY HIGH HAPLOTYPE DIVERSITY, AND MOSTLY LIMITED TO LOW-LYING AGRICULTURAL REGIONS. THIS DERIVED CLADE IS VERY ABUNDANT, WHEREAS THE MORE BASAL CLADES WERE RELATIVELY RARE. ALTHOUGH NEARLY ALL HAPLOTYPE DIVERSITY IN FIJIAN HORNALICTUS COMPRISES SYNONYMOUS SUBSTITUTIONS, A SMALL NUMBER OF AMINO ACID CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAJOR CLADES, INCLUDING THE HYPER-DIVERSE CLADE. ANALYSES OF HAPLOTYPE LINEAGE ACCUMULATION SHOW A STEEP INCREASE IN SELECTIVELY NEUTRAL COI HAPLOTYPES CORRESPONDING TO THE EMERGENCE OF THIS `BROOM' CLADE. WE EXPLORE THREE POSSIBLE SCENARIOS FOR THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE: (I) A KEY CHANGE IN ADAPTEDNESS TO THE ENVIRONMENT, (II) A LARGE-SCALE EXTINCTION EVENT, OR (III) A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SUITABLE HABITATS LEADING TO RAPID POPULATION EXPANSION. USING ESTIMATED MUTATION RATES OF MITOCHONDRIAL DNA IN OTHER INVERTEBRATES, WE ARGUE THAT HOMALICTUS FIRST COLONISED THE FIJIAN ARCHIPELAGO IN THE MIDDLE-LATE PLEISTOCENE, AND THE RAPID ACCUMULATION OF HAPLOTYPES IN THE HYPER-DIVERSE CLADE OCCURRED IN THE HOLOCENE, BUT PRIOR TO RECORDED HUMAN PRESENCE IN THE FIJIAN REGION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT BEES HAVE NOT BEEN IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF FIJIAN ECOSYSTEMS UNTIL VERY RECENT TIMES. POST-PLEISTOCENE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC EFFECTS ON FIJIAN ECOSYSTEMS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE GREATLY TRANSFORMED POLLINATOR SUITES FROM THE CONDITIONS WHEN THOSE ECOSYSTEMS WERE FIRST BEING ASSEMBLED.

IN PARTICULAR, THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HIGHLY VARIABLE UPPER LIP (GALEA), THREE BROAD MORPHOLOGICAL TYPES OF WHICH (BEAKLESS AND TOOTHLESS, BEAKLESS AND TOOTHED, BEAKED) CAN BE DISCRIMINATED, REMAINS UNKNOWN. WE USED SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TO INVESTIGATE THE EARLY STAGES OF FLORAL ONTOGENY IN TWO BEAKED SPECIES, PEDICULARIS GRUINA AND P. SIPHONANTHA. TO COMPARE THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES OF THE THREE GALEA TYPES, THREE SPECIES FOR EACH TYPE WERE INVESTIGATED. INITIATIONS OF FLORAL ORGANS IN PEDICULARIS ARE CONSISTENT. SEPAL INITIATIONS ARE SUCCESSIVE FROM THE LATERAL-ADAXIAL PRIMORDIA, FOLLOWED BY THE LATERAL-ABAXIAL ONES (THESE SOMETIMES MISSING), THEN THE MID-ADAXIAL ONE (AGAIN SOMETIMES MISSING). THE STAMENS ARE INITIATED PRIOR TO THE PETALS, OR DEVELOPMENT OF PETAL PRIMORDIA MAY BE RETARDED AT THE EARLY STAGES IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF STAMEN PRIMORDIA. FOUR STAMEN PRIMORDIA ARE INITIATED SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FIVE PETAL PRIMORDIA ARE INITIATED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY. DEVELOPMENT PROCESSES OF THE UPPER LIP AMONG THE THREE GALEA TYPES DIFFER IN THE EXPANSION RATES AND DIRECTIONS OF THE CELLS OF THE TWO LOBES AND THESE DIFFERENCES GOVERN WHETHER OR NOT A BEAK AND/OR TEETH ARE FORMED ON THE UPPER LIP. THE FLORAL ONTOGENY OF PEDICULARIS IS CLOSE TO THAT OF AGALINIS, WHICH SUPPORTS THE MOLECULAR ASSIGNMENT. FLORAL MONOSYMMETRY OF PEDICULARIS IS ESTABLISHED AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPAL INITIATION AND IS MAINTAINED UNTIL FLOWERING.

WE INVESTIGATED, OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, HOW NECTAR PRODUCTION AND COMPOSITION DIFFERS IN PROTANDROUS FLOWERS OF ACONITUM LYCOCTONUM L AND ACONITUM CARMICHAELII DEBEAUX, TWO SPECIES ORIGINATING FROM DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. FLOWERS OF A. CARMICHAELII SECRETED APPROX. 2.5-FOLD MORE NECTAR THAN FLOWERS OF A. LYCOCTONUM. THE NECTAR OF A. CARMICHAELII WAS SUCROSE-DOMINANT (87.6:9.5:2.9, SUCROSE:FRUCTOSE:GLUCOSE), WHEREAS SUCROSE-RICH NECTAR, LACKING GLUCOSE, OCCURRED IN A. LYCOCTONUM (39.9:60.1, SUCROSE:FRUCTOSE). TOTAL SUGAR CONCENTRATION WAS SIMILAR (53\%, ON AVERAGE) IN BOTH SPECIES. THESE SPECIES ALSO SHOWED CONTRASTING PATTERNS IN NECTAR PRODUCTION AND COMPOSITION BETWEEN THE FLORAL SEXUAL PHASES. ON AVERAGE, IN A. CARMICHAELII, MALE-PHASE FLOWERS PRODUCED 2.4-FOLD MORE NECTAR THAN FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS IN THE TWO YEARS OF STUDY, AND NECTAR WAS SUCROSE-DOMINANT, IRRESPECTIVE OF SEXUAL PHASE. BY CONTRAST, NECTAR PRODUCTION IN A. LYCOCTONUM WAS BIASED TOWARDS THE MALE PHASE IN ONE YEAR OF STUDY AND TOWARDS THE FEMALE PHASE IN THE OTHER, AND WHEREAS NECTAR WAS SUCROSE-DOMINANT DURING THE MALE-PHASE, IT WAS FRUCTOSE-RICH DURING THE FEMALE PHASE, INDICATING SUCROSE RE-ABSORPTION.

MODULARITY) OF COMPLEX ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, WE SAMPLED AN INDIVIDUAL-BASED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK BY FOLLOWING THE MOVEMENTS AND FLOWER VISITS OF MARKED BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A POPULATION OF THISTLE PLANTS FOR WHICH THE IDENTITIES AND SPATIAL LOCATIONS OF STEMS WERE MAPPED IN A 50 X 50 M STUDY PLOT. THE PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK WAS DOMINATED BY PARASITIC MALE BUMBLEBEES AND HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY MODULAR STRUCTURE, WITH FOUR IDENTIFIED MODULES BEING CLEARLY SEPARATED IN SPACE. THIS INDICATED THAT INDIVIDUAL FLOWER VISITORS OPTED FOR THE FINE-SCALE DIVISION OF RESOURCES, EVEN WITHIN A LOCAL SITE. HOWEVER, SPATIAL MAPPING OF NETWORK MODULES AND MOVEMENTS OF BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS ALSO SHOWED AN OVERLAP IN THE DENSE CENTER OF THE PLANT PATCH. MODEL SELECTION BASED ON AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION WITH TRAITS AS PREDICTOR VARIABLES REVEALED THAT THISTLE STEMS WITH HIGH NUMBERS OF FLOWER HEADS AND MANY CLOSE NEIGHBOURS WERE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE MODULES.

THIS DEMONSTRATED THAT INDIVIDUAL-BASED PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS ARE INFLUENCED BY BOTH THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF PLANT POPULATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL-SPECIFIC PLANT TRAITS. ADDITIONALLY, BUMBLEBEE INDIVIDUALS WITH LONG OBSERVATION TIMES WERE IMPORTANT FOR BOTH THE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN AND WITHIN MODULES.

THIS WILL LEAD TO DIFFERENTIAL TRANSMISSION SUCCESS AND POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE AIMED AT DETERMINING WHETHER THE PARASITE MAY INDEED BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NECTAR BY THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.) (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE). WE FOUND THAT PARASITE SURVIVAL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN WATER WITH HIGHER SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS. HOWEVER, NONE OF THE FIELD-COLLECTED NECTAR SAMPLES CONTAINED PARASITE CELLS, AND NO PARASITE CELLS WERE TRANSMITTED BETWEEN TWO ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS BY A FORAGING WORKER UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS.

SIZE VARIATIONS IN POLLINATOR POPULATIONS MAY MODIFY COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG FORAGERS. COMPETITION AMONG POLLINATORS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LEAD TO ONE OF TWO CONTRASTING BEHAVIOURS: EITHER SPECIALISATION TO THE MOST PROFITABLE PLANT SPECIES OR GENERALISATION TO SEVERAL SPECIES. WHEN FORAGING, POLLINATORS ARE ALSO CONFRONTED WITH HETEROGENEITY IN THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANT RESOURCES. BECAUSE VARIATIONS IN BOTH THE FORAGER DENSITY AND PLANT SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION CAN AFFECT POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, FOCUS WAS ON THE INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF THESE TWO FACTORS. 2. BUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS L.) INDIVIDUALS WERE TRAINED ON A FOCAL SPECIES (LOTUS CORNICULATUS L.) AND EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED WHETHER VARIATIONS IN THE FORAGER DENSITY (TWO OR SIX BUMBLE BEES FORAGING TOGETHER), PLANT COMMUNITY SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION (TWO PLANT SPECIES: L. CORNICULATUS AND MEDICAGO SATIVA, WHICH WERE EITHER PATCHILY OR RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED), AND THEIR INTERACTION MODIFIED BUMBLE BEE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR. 3. IT WAS SHOWN THAT WHEN CONFRONTED WITH A HIGH FORAGER DENSITY, BUMBLE BEES FOCUSED THEIR VISITS TOWARDS THE MOST FAMILIAR SPECIES, ESPECIALLY WHEN FORAGING UNDER A RANDOM PLANT DISTRIBUTION. THESE MODIFICATIONS AFFECTED THE FRUITING OF THE FOCAL PLANT SPECIES, WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS UNDER LOW DENSITY/PATCHY CONDITIONS. 4. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE FORAGING DECISIONS OF BUMBLE BEES ARE INFLUENCED BY VARIATIONS IN BOTH THE CONSPECIFIC DENSITY AND PLANT SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION. GIVEN THE INCREASING IMPACT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES ON PLANT-POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES, THIS RAISES THE QUESTION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE RESULTS FOR PLANT COMMUNITIES IN NATURAL CONDITIONS WHEN CONFRONTED WITH VARIATIONS IN THE POLLINATOR DENSITY AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS.",BOMBUS TERRESTRIS; FORAGING BEHAVIOUR; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS,FLOWER CONSTANCY; POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR; MOVEMENT; PATTERNS; COMPETITION; HETEROGENEITY; HUMMINGBIRDS; HYMENOPTERA; COMPLEXITY; DYNAMICS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"GESLIN, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), LAB BIOEMCO, 46 RUE ULM, F-75005 PARIS, FRANCE.;GESLIN, BENOIT, MALLARD, FRANCOIS, IEES PARIS, CNRS UPMC, UMR CNRS 7618, PARIS, FRANCE.;BAUDE, MATHILDE, UNIV ORLEANS, DEPT ECOL FORESTIERE, EA 1207LBLGC, ORLEANS, FRANCE.;DAJOZ, ISABELLE, IEES PARIS, CNRS PARIS DIDEROT, UMR CNRS 7618, PARIS, FRANCE.",10.1111/EEN.12106,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,REGION ILE-DE-FRANCE THROUGH DIM ASTREA PROGRAMREGION ILE-DE-FRANCE,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A GRANT FROM REGION ILE-DE-FRANCE THROUGH DIM ASTREA PROGRAM.

WE EVALUATED THE COMBINED EFFECT OF SID, INSECT POLLINATORS AND HERBIVORES (UNGULATES) ON THREE REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT VARIABLES (FRUIT SET, SEED SET, AND SEED MASS) OF A MEDITERRANEAN SHRUB (HAHN-DUAL ITALIAN:MILANI), WE CONSIDERED TWO DIFFERENT HABITATS (SLD VERGES VS ADJACENT SCRUBLANDS), TWO SCENARIOS OF HERBIVORY (WITH AND WITHOUT UNGULATES), AND THREE SCENARIOS OF POLLINATOR ACTIVITY (WITHOUT POLLINATORS, WITH MANUAL POLLINATION AND WITH NATURAL POLLINATION). SLD HAD CONTRASTING EFFECTS ON H. HALIMPLIUM REPRODUCTION. IN THE ABSENCE OF HERBIVORES, OVERALL FRUIT SET WAS LOWER IN THE VERGES OF SLD THAN IN ADJACENT SCRUBLANDS, PROBABLY DUE TO LOWER FLOWER POLLINATION RATES. WHERE HERBIVORES WERE PRESENT, OVERALL FRUIT SET WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN HABITATS, BECAUSE UNGULATE BROWSING WAS LOWER IN SLD VERGES THAN IN ADJACENT SCRUBLANDS. THE QUANTITY AND WEIGHT OF SEEDS PER FRUIT WAS SIMILAR IN BOTH HABITATS, PROBABLY BECAUSE ALL FERTILIZED FLOWERS RECEIVED SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF POLLEN.

THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: (I) INVESTIGATE THE SPECTRUM OF PLANT SPECIES FROM WHICH POLLEN IS COLLECTED BY TETRAGONISCA ANGUSTULA IN CAATINGA (DRY VEGETATION) AREAS IN THE SEMIARID REGION OF NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, (II) IDENTIFY POLLEN TYPES THAT COULD BE USED AS REGIONAL GEOGRAPHICAL MARKERS AND (III) DETERMINE THE POLLEN NICHE BREADTH AND THE PATTERN OF USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES BY THIS STINGLESS BEE. IN TOTAL, 23 SAMPLES OF THE POLLEN STORED BY T. ANGUSTULA WERE COLLECTED MONTHLY AND SUBJECTED TO ACETOLYSIS. OF THE 45 POLLEN TYPES IDENTIFIED THAT OF PROSOPIS JULIFLORA (FABACEAE) AND SOLANUM (SOLANACEAE) WERE THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPRESENTED IN THE SAMPLES AND 19 WERE COLLECTED BY THE BEES AT BOTH STUDY SITES. SPECIES CHARACTERISTIC OF CAATINGA, SUCH AS POINCIANELLA PYRAMIDALIS (TULASNE) L. P. QUEIROZ AND SENNA MACRANTHERA (DE CANDOLLE EX COLLADON) H. S. IRWIN \& BARNEBY, WERE AMONG THE POLLEN IDENTIFIED AND THEY WERE USED AS INDICATORS OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN OF THE SAMPLES.

MURUA M;ESPINDOLA A,MURUA M,POLLINATION SYNDROMES IN A SPECIALISED PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION: DOES FLORAL MORPHOLOGY PREDICT POLLINATORS IN CALCEOLARIA?,PLANT BIOLOGY,PLANT BIOL.,"POLLINATION SYNDROMES ARE DEFINED AS SUITES OF FLORAL TRAITS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO SELECTION IMPOSED BY A PARTICULAR GROUP OF POLLINATORS (E.G., BUTTERFLIES, HUMMINGBIRDS, BATS). ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THEIR OCCURRENCE IN PLANTS POLLINATED BY RADICALLY DIFFERENT POLLINATORS, IT IS LESS KNOWN WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THEM WITHIN SPECIES POLLINATED BY ONE FUNCTIONAL POLLINATOR GROUP. IN SUCH A FRAMEWORK, WE EXPECT FLORAL TRAITS TO EVOLVE ALSO IN RESPONSE TO POLLINATOR SUBGROUPS (E.G., SPECIES, GENERA) WITHIN THAT UNIQUE FUNCTIONAL GROUP. ON THIS, SPECIALISED POLLINATION SYSTEMS REPRESENT APPROPRIATE CASE STUDIES TO TEST SUCH EXPECTATIONS. CALCEOLARIA IS A HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED PLANT GENUS POLLINATED BY OIL-COLLECTING BEES IN GENERA CENTRIS AND CHALEPOGENUS. VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS IN CALCEOLARIA HAS RECENTLY BEEN SUGGESTED TO REFLECT ADAPTATIONS TO POLLINATOR TYPES. HOWEVER, TO DATE NO STUDY HAS EXPLICITLY TESTED THAT OBSERVATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE QUANTITATIVELY TEST THAT HYPOTHESIS BY EVALUATING THE PRESENCE OF POLLINATION SYNDROMES WITHIN THE SPECIALISED POLLINATION SYSTEM FORMED BY SEVERAL CALCEOLARIA AND THEIR INSECT POLLINATORS. TO DO SO, WE USE MULTIVARIATE APPROACHES AND EXPLORE THE STRUCTURAL MATCHING BETWEEN THE MORPHOLOGY OF 10 CALCEOLARIA TAXA AND THAT OF THEIR PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS. OUR RESULTS IDENTIFY MORPHOLOGICAL MATCHING BETWEEN FLORAL TRAITS RELATED TO ACCESS TO THE REWARD AND INSECT TRAITS INVOLVED IN OIL COLLECTION, CONFIRMING THE PRESENCE OF POLLINATOR SYNDROMES IN CALCEOLARIA.

THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL FOR RISK ASSESSMENTS AS WELL AS IN SITU CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR WILD GERMPLASM. METHODS: IN 2010-2014, WE SURVEYED 23 POPULATIONS OF WILD/WEEDY EGGPLANT (SOLANUM INSANUM, KNOWN AS WILD BRINJAL), CARRIED OUT HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS, AND OBSERVED POLLINATORS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR CROP-TO-WILD GENE FLOW IN SOUTHERN INDIA. KEY RESULTS: WILD BRINJAL IS A SPINY, LOW-GROWING PERENNIAL COMMONLY FOUND IN DISTURBED SITES SUCH AS ROADSIDES, WASTELANDS, AND SPARSELY VEGETATED AREAS NEAR VILLAGES AND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS. FOURTEEN OF THE 23 WILD POPULATIONS IN OUR STUDY OCCURRED WITHIN 0.5 KM OF CULTIVATED BRINJAL AND AT LEAST NINE FLOWERED IN SYNCHRONY WITH THE CROP. HAND CROSSES BETWEEN WILD AND CULTIVATED BRINJAL RESULTED IN SEED SET AND VIABLE F-1 PROGENY. WILD BRINJAL FLOWERS THAT WERE BAGGED TO EXCLUDE POLLINATORS DID NOT SET FRUIT, AND FRUIT SET FROM MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION WAS LOW. THE EXSERTED STIGMAS OF WILD BRINJAL ARE LIKELY TO PROMOTE OUTCROSSING. THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS APPEARED TO BE BEES (AMEGILLA, XYLOCOPA, NOMIA, AND HETEROTRIGONA SPP.), WHICH ALSO WERE OBSERVED FORAGING FOR POLLEN ON CROP BRINJAL.

NEGATIVE SEXUAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SPECIES (REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE) THROUGH IMPROPER HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER HAVE RECENTLY BEEN REPORTED BETWEEN NATIVE AND INVASIVE SPECIES DEMONSTRATING POLLINATION-DRIVEN COMPETITION. WE FOCUSED ON TWO NATIVE IMPATIENS SPECIES (I.NOLI-TANGERE AND I.TEXTORI) FOUND IN JAPAN AND EXAMINED WHETHER POLLINATOR-MEDIATED PLANT COMPETITION OCCURS BETWEEN THEM. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT I.NOLI-TANGERE AND I.TEXTORI SHARE THE SAME POLLINATION NICHE (I.E., FLOWERING SEASON, POLLINATOR FAUNA, AND POSITION OF POLLEN ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY). IN ADDITION, HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN GRAINS WERE DEPOSITED ON MOST STIGMAS OF BOTH I.NOLI-TANGERE AND I.TEXTORI FLOWERS THAT WERE SITUATED WITHIN 2M OF FLOWERS OF THE OTHER SPECIES RESULTING IN DEPRESSED FRUIT SET.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"THERE IS GROWING CONCERN THAT THE GLOBAL DECLINE OF INSECT POLLINATORS WILL ADVERSELY INFLUENCE THE STABILITY OF POLLINATION IN AGRICULTURAL AND TERRESTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS. BY ENHANCING HABITAT HETEROGENEITY AND ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY, RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROMOTE INSECT POLLINATORS IN INTENSIVELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES. INSECT POLLINATORS AND FLOWERING PLANTS WERE INVESTIGATED ON A RANGE OF RIPARIAN MARGINS, AND THEIR ADJACENT GRASSLAND FIELDS, TO DETERMINE THE MAIN PHYSICAL AND BOTANICAL ATTRIBUTES DRIVING POLLINATOR DIVERSITY. IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THEY WERE FENCED OR NOT, RIPARIAN MARGINS HAD RICHER PLANT ASSEMBLAGES AND SUPPORTED MORE POLLINATORS THAN GRASSLAND FIELDS. WHILE THE ERECTION OF FENCES DID NOT ENHANCE THE RICHNESS OR DIVERSITY OF FLOWERS, FENCED RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS SUPPORTED MORE EVEN AND DIVERSE ASSEMBLAGES OF BUMBLEBEES AND A GREATER NUMBER OF BUTTERFLIES THAN UNFENCED RIPARIAN MARGINS. MORE BUMBLEBEES AND BUTTERFLIES WERE RECORDED IN WIDE BUFFER STRIPS (I.E. OVER 5 M WIDE) THAN IN UNFENCED MARGINS OR NARROW BUFFER STRIPS (I.E. <= 3.5 M WIDE) AND BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES IN WIDE BUFFER STRIPS WERE RICHER AND MORE DIVERSE. THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FLORAL RESOURCES AND THE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEE AND BUTTERFLY ASSEMBLAGES. POLLINATORS ONLY FORAGED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF THE FLOWER SPECIES PRESENT AND IMPACTS OF FENCING AND BUFFER STRIP WIDTH COULD NOT SOLELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE AREA AND/OR SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWERS. FENCED RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS, PARTICULARLY WHEN OVER 5 M WIDE, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR INSECT POLLINATORS IN INTENSIVELY GRAZED SYSTEMS. MANAGEMENT TO ENHANCE FLORISTIC DIVERSITY (TO PROVIDE A MORE CONTINUOUS SUPPLY OF POLLEN AND NECTAR) AND TUSSOCK FORMING GRASSES (TO PROVIDE SHELTER FOR POLLINATORS AND NESTING LOCATIONS FOR BUMBLEBEES) COULD FURTHER INCREASE THEIR VALUE TO INSECT POLLINATORS. IN GRASSLAND SYSTEMS, RESTRICTED GRAZING IS EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THAN MOWING. IT IS, HOWEVER, IMPORTANT THAT GRAZING MANAGEMENT DOES NOT UNDULY INTERFERE WITH OTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DERIVED FROM RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS (E.G. DIFFUSE POLLUTION MITIGATION). WIDESPREAD FENCING OF WATERCOURSES AT THE CATCHMENT LEVEL COULD RESULT IN THE SIMPLIFICATION OF THESE INHERENTLY DYNAMIC AND COMPLEX HABITATS. BUFFER STRIPS SHOULD THEREFORE BE STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO OPTIMISE BENEFITS SUCH AS ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY AND DIFFUSE POLLUTION MITIGATION. (C) 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN HOW EFFECTIVELY WILD POLLINATORS MAINTAIN POLLINATION SERVICES IN SMALL, URBAN GARDENS WITH DIVERSE FLORAL RESOURCES. WE USED A `MOBILE GARDEN' EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, WHEREBY POTTED PLANTS OF CUCUMBER, EGGPLANT, AND PURPLE CONEFLOWER WERE BROUGHT TO 30 RESIDENTIAL YARDS IN CHICAGO, IL, USA, TO ENABLE DIRECT ASSESSMENT OF POLLINATION SERVICES PROVIDED BY WILD POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. WE MEASURED FRUIT AND SEED SET AND INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF WITHIN-YARD CHARACTERISTICS AND ADJACENT FLORAL RESOURCES ON PLANT POLLINATION. INCREASED POLLINATOR VISITATION AND TAXONOMIC RICHNESS GENERALLY LED TO INCREASES IN FRUIT AND SEED SET FOR ALL FOCAL PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, FRUIT AND SEED SET WERE CORRELATED ACROSS THE THREE SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT POLLINATION SERVICES VARY ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN WAYS THAT ARE CONSISTENT AMONG DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES. PLANT SPECIES VARIED IN TERMS OF WHICH POLLINATOR GROUPS PROVIDED THE MOST VISITS AND BENEFIT FOR POLLINATION. CUCUMBER POLLINATION WAS LINKED TO VISITATION BY SMALL SWEAT BEES (LASIOGLOSSUM SPP.), WHEREAS EGGPLANT POLLINATION WAS LINKED TO VISITS BY BUMBLE BEES. PURPLE CONEFLOWER WAS VISITED BY THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP OF POLLINATORS AND, PERHAPS DUE TO THIS PHENOMENON, WAS MORE EFFECTIVELY POLLINATED IN FLORALLY-RICH GARDENS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE HOW A DIVERSITY OF WILD BEES SUPPORTS POLLINATION OF MULTIPLE PLANT SPECIES, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF POLLINATOR CONSERVATION WITHIN CITIES.

THE SPME PARAMETERS WERE STUDIED, THE OPTIMUM CONDITIONS OF 85 MU M CARBOXEN/POLYDIMETHYLSILOXANE (CAR/PDMS), EXTRACTION TEMPERATURE OF 30 DEGREES C AND EXTRACTION TIME OF 30 MIN WERE OBTAINED. THE ANALYTICAL METHOD WAS APPLIED TO CHARACTERIZE DIFFERENT ONION LINES ACCORDING TO THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE VOLATILE FRACTION OF NECTAR AND FLOWERS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT WAS DETERMINED WHICH ODOR COMPONENTS CONTRIBUTE TO THE POLLINATION OF ONIONS LINES AND RELATE THE CONTENT OF SPECIFIC ANALYTES WITH FORAGING BEHAVIOR AND SEED PRODUCTION. MORE THAN 90 COMPOUNDS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE SAMPLES STUDIED SHOWED DIFFERENCES IN THE VOLATILE PROFILES OF FLOWERS AND NECTAR AMONG THE DIFFERENT LINES. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT HEADSPACE SPME-GCMS IS A SIMPLE, RAPID AND SOLVENT-FREE METHOD SUITABLE FOR ANALYSIS OF VOLATILE COMPOUNDS EMITTED FROM ONION PLANTS. FURTHERMORE, A GREAT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND FOR THE NUMBER OF BEE VISITS AND SEED YIELD AMONG THE ONION LINES ANALYZED. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE COMBINATION OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS IS ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE ONION MALE STERILE LINES FROM FERTILE LINES, AS WELL AS AMONG MALE STERILE LINES. REPELLENT COMPOUNDS, SUCH AS DIOXOLANES, PIPERIDINES AND ORGANOSULFURS MAY CONTRIBUTE NEGATIVELY TO POLLINATION, SINCE THE HIGHER CONTENT OF THESE ANALYTES, THE LESS BEE VISITS AND SEED PRODUCTION YIELD.

INSECT CONSERV.,"THE GLOBAL POLLINATOR DECLINE IS COMMONLY LINKED TO MODERN INTENSIVE FARMING PRACTICES, PARTLY BECAUSE EXCESSIVE HERBICIDE AND FERTILIZER USE IS THOUGHT TO REDUCE POLLINATOR FOOD PLANT AVAILABILITY. THIS EFFECT IS PARTICULARLY OBVIOUS ACROSS CROP-/NON-CROP BOUNDARIES, BUT NO STUDY HAS COMPARED POLLINATOR AND FOOD PLANT ABUNDANCE ON ADJACENT CROP- AND ROADSIDE MARGINS. WE COMPARED BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCE ALONG 30 HEDGEROWS IN SW ENGLAND, BORDERED EITHER SIDE BY ROADS AND ARABLE FIELDS (CULTIVATED WITH WHEAT, BARLEY, OILSEED RAPE, OR BEANS). TOTAL BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCE ALONG ROADSIDES WAS OVER TWICE THAT OBSERVED ON ADJACENT CROP-FACING MARGINS, IRRESPECTIVE OF CROP TYPE AND THIS GENERAL PATTERN WAS APPARENT FOR THREE OF THE FIVE MOST COMMON BUMBLEBEE SPECIES, INCLUDING GENERALIST AND SPECIALIST FORAGERS. BOTH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES AND THE FLORAL ABUNDANCE OF THREE OF THE FIVE MOST VISITED PLANTS WAS ALSO HIGHER ON ROADSIDES, MINOR VARIATION BETWEEN-CROPS WAS LOCALISED AND UNRELATED TO MARGIN ORIENTATION. WE CONCLUDE THAT ORGANIC FARMING MAY OFFER SOME ADVANTAGES FOR POLLINATOR CONSERVATION SINCE IT REDUCES FIELD MARGIN EXPOSURE TO AGRO-CHEMICAL INPUTS. HOWEVER, SINCE CONVENTIONAL FARMING WILL REMAIN CENTRAL TO GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION, MODIFICATIONS TO CURRENT PRACTICES (SUCH AS THE USE OF WILDFLOWER STRIPS) ARE NEEDED AND MAY HAVE ANCILLARY BENEFITS FOR POLLINATORS BY PROTECTING ARABLE MARGINS FROM DISTURBANCE AND AGRO-CHEMICALS. IN ADDITION, THE FACT THAT THE ROADSIDES WERE DEMONSTRABLY BETTER HABITATS FOR POLLINATORS AND THEIR FOOD PLANTS THAN FIELD-FACING MARGINS UNDERSCORES THE WIDESPREAD SUGGESTION THAT ROADSIDE VERGES SHOULD BE UTILISED MORE AS A CONSERVATION TOOL TO PROMOTE POLLINATOR BIODIVERSITY.",AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP SCHEMES; FIELD MARGINS; PESTICIDES; POLLINATORS,AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES; FIELD MARGINS; CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE; LANDSCAPE; BEES; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; BIODIVERSITY; DECLINE; PESTICIDE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,19,"HANLEY, ME (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PLYMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PLYMOUTH PL4 8AA, DEVON, ENGLAND.;HANLEY, MICK E., WILKINS, JOSHUA P., UNIV PLYMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PLYMOUTH PL4 8AA, DEVON, ENGLAND.",10.1007/S10841-014-9744-3,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,NA,NA,1366-638X,1,67-74,SPRINGER,19,2015,ISI000350887700007,58,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENTOMOLOGY",127,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ENTOMOLOGY",MEHANLEYPLYMOUTH.AC.UK,CD2ES,"HANLEY, ME (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PLYMOUTH, SCH BIOL SCI, PLYMOUTH PL4 8AA, DEVON, ENGLAND",ISI,none,UNIV PLYMOUTH,UNIV PLYMOUTH,NA,"HANLEY ME, 2015, J INSECT CONSERV","HANLEY ME, 2015, J INSECT CONSERV",NA,NA,NA,NA

EVOL.,"NEOTROPICAL RAINFORESTS SUSTAIN SOME OF THE MOST DIVERSE TERRESTRIAL COMMUNITIES ON EARTH. EUGLOSSINE (OR ORCHID) BEES ARE A DIVERSE LINEAGE OF INSECT POLLINATORS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAN TROPICS, WHERE THEY PROVIDE POLLINATION SERVICES TO A STAGGERING DIVERSITY OF FLOWERING PLANT TAXA. ELUCIDATING THE SEASONAL PATTERNS OF PHYLOGENETIC ASSEMBLY AND FUNCTIONAL TRAIT DIVERSITY OF BEE COMMUNITIES CAN SHED NEW LIGHT INTO THE MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN THE ASSEMBLY OF BEE POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF DECLINING BEE POPULATIONS. MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES COLLECT, STORE, AND ACCUMULATE ODORIFEROUS COMPOUNDS (PERFUMES) TO SUBSEQUENTLY USE DURING COURTSHIP DISPLAY. THUS, SYNTHETIC CHEMICAL BAITS CAN BE USED TO ATTRACT AND MONITOR EUGLOSSINE BEE POPULATIONS. WE CONDUCTED MONTHLY CENSUSES OF ORCHID BEES IN THREE SITES IN THE MAGDALENA VALLEY OF COLOMBIA - A REGION WHERE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN BIOTAS CONVERGE - TO INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE, DIVERSITY, AND ASSEMBLY OF EUGLOSSINE BEE COMMUNITIES THROUGH TIME IN RELATION TO SEASONAL CLIMATIC CYCLES. IN PARTICULAR, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PHYLOGENETIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL TRAIT DIVERSITY CHANGED IN RESPONSE TO SEASONAL RAINFALL FLUCTUATIONS. ALL COMMUNITIES EXHIBITED STRONG TO MODERATE PHYLOGENETIC CLUSTERING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WITH FEW PRONOUNCED BURSTS OF PHYLOGENETIC OVERDISPERSION THAT COINCIDED WITH THE TRANSITION FROM WET-TO-DRY SEASONS.

THIS IS THOUGHT TO BE PARTICULARLY USEFUL WHEN A SPECIES OF INTEREST IS SPREAD OUT OVER A LARGE AREA AND SAMPLING IS CONSTRAINED. WE USED OCCUPANCY MODELLING TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF THREE PHYLOGENETICALLY INDEPENDENT PAIRS OF NATIVE-INTRODUCED SPECIES [MEGACHILE CAMPANULAE (ROBERTSON)-MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA (FAB.), MEGACHILE PUGNATA SAY-MEGACHILE CENTUNCULARIS (L.), OSMIA PUMILA CRESSON-OSMIA CAERULESCENS (L.)] (APOIDEA: MEGACHILIDAE) BEING PRESENT WHEN REPEATED SAMPLING DID NOT ALWAYS FIND THEM. OUR STUDY OCCURRED ALONG A GRADIENT OF URBANIZATION AND USED NEST BOXES (BEE HOTELS) SET UP OVER THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. OCCUPANCY MODELLING DISCOVERED DIFFERENT PATTERNS TO THOSE OBTAINED BY SPECIES DETECTION AND ABUNDANCE-BASED DATA ALONE. FOR EXAMPLE, IT PREDICTED THAT THE SPECIES THAT WAS RANKED 4TH IN TERMS OF DETECTION ACTUALLY HAD THE GREATEST OCCUPANCY AMONG ALL SIX SPECIES. THE NATIVE M. PUGNATA HAD DECREASED OCCUPANCY WITH INCREASING BUILDING FOOTPRINT AND A SIMILAR BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT PATTERN WAS FOUND FOR THE NATIVE O. PUMILA. TWO INTRODUCED BEES (M. ROTUNDATA AND M. CENTUNCULARIS), AND ONE NATIVE (M. CAMPANULAE) HAD MODELLED OCCUPANCY VALUES THAT INCREASED WITH INCREASING URBANIZATION. OCCUPANCY PROBABILITY DIFFERED AMONG URBAN GREEN SPACE TYPES FOR THREE OF SIX BEE SPECIES, WITH VALUES FOR TWO NATIVE SPECIES (M. CAMPANULAE AND O. PUMILA) BEING HIGHEST IN HOME GARDENS AND THAT FOR THE EXOTIC O. CAERULESCENS BEING HIGHEST IN COMMUNITY GARDENS. THE COMBINATION OF OCCUPANCY MODELLING WITH ANALYSIS OF HABITAT VARIABLES AS AN AUGMENTATION TO DETECTION AND ABUNDANCE-BASED SAMPLING IS SUGGESTED TO BE THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THAT URBAN HABITAT MANAGEMENT RESULTS IN THE DESIRED OUTCOMES.",NA,ESTIMATING SITE OCCUPANCY; LAND-USE; DETECTION PROBABILITY; SPECIES OCCURRENCE; FORAGING RANGES; INTRODUCED BEES; WILD BEES; HYMENOPTERA; POLLINATION; CITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"MACIVOR, JS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TORONTO SCARBOROUGH, DEPT BIOL SCI, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;MACIVOR, JS (REPRINT AUTHOR), YORK UNIV, DEPT BIOL, TORONTO, ON, CANADA.;MACIVOR, J.

INSECT BEHAV.,"BUMBLEBEES DEMONSTRATE AN EXTENSIVE CAPACITY FOR LEARNING COMPLEX MOTOR SKILLS TO MAXIMISE EXPLOITATION OF FLORAL REWARDS. THIS ABILITY IS WELL STUDIED IN NECTAR COLLECTION BUT ITS ROLE IN POLLEN FORAGING IS LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD. FLORAL SONICATION IS USED BY BEES TO EXTRACT POLLEN FROM SOME PLANT SPECIES WITH ANTHERS WHICH MUST BE VIBRATED (BUZZED) TO RELEASE POLLEN. POLLEN REMOVAL IS DETERMINED BY SONICATION CHARACTERISTICS INCLUDING FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE, AND THUS THE ABILITY TO OPTIMISE SONICATION SHOULD ALLOW BEES TO MAXIMISE THE POLLEN COLLECTION. WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF THE BUFF-TAILED BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) TO MODIFY THE FREQUENCY AND AMPLITUDE OF THEIR BUZZES WITH INCREASING EXPERIENCE MANIPULATING FLOWERS OF THE BUZZ-POLLINATED PLANT SOLANUM ROSTRATUM. WE ANALYSED FLIGHT AND FEEDING VIBRATIONS GENERATED BY NA < VE WORKERS ACROSS FEEDING BOUTS. FEEDING BUZZES WERE OF A HIGHER FREQUENCY AND A LOWER AMPLITUDE THAN FLIGHT BUZZES. BOTH FLIGHT AND FEEDING BUZZES HAD REDUCED AMPLITUDES WITH INCREASING NUMBER OF FORAGING TRIPS. HOWEVER, THE FREQUENCY OF THEIR FEEDING BUZZES WAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THEIR FLIGHT BUZZES AS BUMBLEBEE WORKERS GAINED EXPERIENCE MANIPULATING FLOWERS.

ASKERLUND P;ALMERS E,ASKERLUND P,FOREST GARDENS - NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR URBAN CHILDREN TO UNDERSTAND AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS,URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING,URBAN FOR. URBAN GREEN.,"THIS CASE STUDY EXPLORES A LEARNING SITUATION IN A FOREST GARDEN IN SWEDEN. A FOREST GARDEN IS AN EDIBLE POLYCULTURE LANDSCAPE WITH DIFFERENT LAYERS OF MOSTLY PERENNIAL VEGETATION. THE FOREST GARDEN IS DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE THE YIELD OF USEFUL PLANTS WHILE MINIMIZING THE INPUT OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES, INCLUDING HUMAN LABOUR. FOREST GARDENS MAY OFFER LEARNING SITUATIONS THAT CONTEXTUALIZE INTERCONNECTEDNESS AND RELATIONS BETWEEN ORGANISMS AS WELL AS SITUATIONS THAT ARE BENEFICIAL FOR EVALUATIVE DEVELOPMENT (KELLER T, 2002), I.E. THE DEVELOPMENT OF VALUES, BELIEFS AND MORAL PERSPECTIVES IN CHILDREN. TWENTY-SEVEN SEVEN TO EIGHT YEAR OLD PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN WERE FOLLOWED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF A THREE YEAR PROJECT IN WHICH THEY PARTICIPATED IN DEVELOPING A FOREST GARDEN. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE HOW THE CHILDREN REASON WITH RESPECT TO DIFFERENT ORGANISMS' DEPENDENCE ON AND RELATIONS TO EACH OTHER, THEMSELVES INCLUDED. SPECIFICALLY: HOW DO THE CHILDREN DESCRIBE THEIR OWN RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OTHER ORGANISMS IN THE FOREST GARDEN? WHAT VALUES OF NATURE ARE EXPRESSED BY THE CHILDREN, AND IN RELATION TO WHICH SITUATIONS IN THE FOREST GARDEN? DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THE FORM OF FIELD NOTES, AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS AND PHOTOS FROM THE CHILDREN'S VISITS TO THE FOREST GARDEN. THE PHOTOS WERE USED FOR STIMULATED RECALL IN FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE DATA WERE ANALYSED USING A COMBINATION OF QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS (PATTON, 2002) AND SEMI-QUANTITATIVE METHODS. THE CHILDREN IN THE STUDY PRESENTED A UNIDIRECTIONAL PERSPECTIVE ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE ORGANISMS, ESPECIALLY THE INSECTS, IN THE FOREST GARDEN. RATHER THAN ASKING WHAT THESE ORGANISMS CAN DO FOR ME/US, THEY POSE THE QUESTION: WHAT CAN I/WE DO FOR THE BUGS/PLANTS/ BEES? THE HUMANISTIC VALUES, EXPRESSED BY THE CHILDREN AS A WILLINGNESS TO HELP OTHER ORGANISMS (MOSTLY INSECTS) ARE IN LINE WITH THE EXPLICIT AIMS OF THE FORMER CURRICULUM FOR BIOLOGY TO ``PROMOTE CARE AND RESPECT FOR NATURE. WE SHOULD NOTE THAT THESE HUMANISTIC VALUES ARE NO LONGER EXPLICITLY STATED IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM. IT IS STRIKING THAT THE ANTHROPOCENTRIC ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PERSPECTIVE (INTRODUCED IN THE CURRENT CURRICULUM FROM GRADE 4), IS SO RARE IN THE DATA. THE CHILDREN SELDOM MENTIONED THE BENEFITS FOR HUMANS FROM INSECT POLLINATION, EVEN THOUGH THIS RELATIONSHIP IS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PEDAGOGUES TOGETHER WITH HUMANISTIC VALUES. IN OBSERVATIONS, THE CHILDREN SHOWED A GREAT DEAL OF CURIOSITY FOR THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT (NATURALISTIC VALUE) AS WELL AS JOY AND ENTHUSIASM ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN THE DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE FOREST GARDEN. AESTHETIC VALUES WERE EXPRESSED IN RELATION TO FLOWERS, CONES, BERRIES, A SNAIL'S SHELL ETC. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT FOREST GARDENS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE PLACES WHERE CHILDREN CAN CONNECT EMOTIONALLY AND COGNITIVELY TO OTHER ORGANISMS. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER GMBH.

EXPERIMENTAL EXCLUSION OF INSECTS DECREASED FRUIT AND SEED SET SIGNIFICANTLY FOR ALL SPECIES EXCEPT I.MUSCICOLA, WHICH ALSO RECEIVED ALMOST NO VISITS FROM ANIMALS. MOST SPECIES RECEIVED VISITS FROM SEVERAL ANIMALS, INCLUDING BEES, BIRDS, BUTTERFLIES AND HAWKMOTHS, ONLY A SUBSET OF WHICH WERE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS. IMPATIENS PSITTACINA, I.KERRIAE, I.RACEMOSA AND I.DARANEENAE WERE POLLINATED BY BEES, PRIMARILY BOMBUS HAEMORRHOIDALIS. IMPATIENS CHIANGDAOENSIS AND I.SANTISUKII HAD BIMODAL POLLINATION SYSTEMS WHICH COMBINED BEE AND LEPIDOPTERAN POLLINATION. FLORAL TRAITS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYSTEMS. AUTOGAMOUS FLOWERS WERE SMALL AND SPURLESS, AND DID NOT PRODUCE NECTAR, BEE-POLLINATED FLOWERS HAD SHORT SPURS AND LARGE FLORAL CHAMBERS WITH A WIDE ENTRANCE, AND BIMODALLY BEE- AND LEPIDOPTERAN-POLLINATED SPECIES HAD LONG SPURS AND A SMALL FLORAL CHAMBER WITH A NARROW ENTRANCE. NECTAR-PRODUCING SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYSTEMS DID NOT DIFFER IN NECTAR VOLUME AND SUGAR CONCENTRATION. DESPITE THE HIGH FREQUENCY OF BEE POLLINATION IN CO-OCCURRING SPECIES, INDIVIDUALS WITH A MORPHOLOGY SUGGESTIVE OF HYBRID ORIGIN WERE RARE. VARIATION IN FLORAL ARCHITECTURE, INCLUDING VARIOUS FORMS OF COROLLA ASYMMETRY, FACILITATES DISTINCT, SPECIES-SPECIFIC POLLEN-PLACEMENT ON VISITING BEES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AMONG IMPATIENS SPP. IS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONAL POLLINATOR GROUPS AND DIVERGENT USE OF THE SAME POLLINATOR. NON-HOMOLOGOUS MECHANISMS OF FLORAL ASYMMETRY ARE CONSISTENT WITH REPEATED INDEPENDENT EVOLUTION, SUGGESTING THAT COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG SPECIES WITH THE SAME POLLINATION SYSTEM HAVE BEEN AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF FLORAL VARIATION AMONG IMPATIENS SPP.",AUTOGAMY; BEE POLLINATION; BUTTERFLY POLLINATION; FLORAL ASYMMETRY; NECTAR ROBBING; NECTAR SPUR; POLLEN PLACEMENT; SYMPATRY; TROPICS,CRITICALLY ENDANGERED BALSAM; SPATIAL VARIATION; DIVERSITY; FLOWERS; SYSTEMS; DIVERSIFICATION; PEDICULARIS; BIOLOGY; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ORCHIDACEAE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"VAN DER NIET, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), NAT BIODIVERS CTR, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;VAN DER NIET, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), LEIDEN UNIV, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;VAN DER NIET, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV KWAZULU NATAL, SCH LIFE SCI, P BAG X01, ZA-3209 SCOTTSVILLE, SOUTH AFRICA.;RUCHISANSAKUN, SAROJ, COZIEN, RUTH J., SMETS, ERIK F., VAN DER NIET, TIMOTHEUS, NAT BIODIVERS CTR, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;RUCHISANSAKUN, SAROJ, SMETS, ERIK F., VAN DER NIET, TIMOTHEUS, LEIDEN UNIV, POB 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;TANGTORWONGSAKUL, PORNPIMON, KING MONGKUTS UNIV TECHNOL THONBURI, 83 MOO 8, BANGKOK 10150, THAILAND.;COZIEN, RUTH J., VAN DER NIET, TIMOTHEUS, UNIV KWAZULU NATAL, SCH LIFE SCI, P BAG X01, ZA-3209 SCOTTSVILLE, SOUTH AFRICA.;SMETS, ERIK F., KATHOLIEKE UNIV LEUVEN, SECT ECOL EVOLUT \& BIODIVERS CONSERVAT, BE-3001 LEUVEN, BELGIUM.",10.1111/BOJ.12427,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TALENTS PROJECT (DPST) SCHOLARSHIP BY THE THAI INSTITUTE FOR THE PROMOTION OF TEACHING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (IPST),"WE THANK MR SOMSAK THITHICHAYAPORN, THE CHIEF OF CHIANG DAO WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, FOR PERMISSION TO WORK INSIDE THE RESERVE.

SEX EXPRESSION WAS INVESTIGATED BY MONITORING ONE POPULATION OF RESTINGA IN MARICA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AREA, RIO DE JANEIRO STATE, BRAZIL, DURING 2-4 YEARS. EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THYRSE, SYNFLORESCENCE, PLANT AND POPULATION. MOST INDIVIDUALS SHOWED A DUODICHOGAMIC SEQUENCE OF FLOWERING (MALE-FEMALE-MALE). HOWEVER, THE POPULATION OVERALL HAD A MORE COMPLEX FLOWERING PATTERN: SOME INDIVIDUALS WERE PROTOGYNOUS, OTHERS PROTANDROUS, A FEW INDIVIDUALS PRODUCED FLOWERS OF ONLY ONE SEX, AND SOME INDIVIDUALS CHANGED SEX EXPRESSION IN THE SECOND YEAR OF THE STUDY, EITHER FROM MALE TO FEMALE OR FROM FEMALE TO MALE.

WE CONDUCTED A TWO-YEAR TILLAGE EXPERIMENT ON THE SQUASH BEE, PEPONAPISPRUINOSA (SAY), TO QUANTIFY HOW TILLAGE IMPACTED OFFSPRING SURVIVAL, OFFSPRING SEX RATIO, AND TIMING OF EMERGENCE. WE ESTABLISHED P. PRUINOSA NESTS IN TWENTY 3 M BY 3 M CAGES AND THEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED A TILLAGE TREATMENT TO HALF OF THOSE CAGES. THE FOLLOWING SUMMER WE TRAPPED EMERGING OFFSPRING. WE USED A BAYESIAN FRAMEWORK TO ANALYSE THE DATA. OFFSPRING EMERGENCE VARIED GREATLY, BUT THERE WAS MODEST EVIDENCE THAT TILLAGE REDUCED OFFSPRING EMERGENCE IN TREATMENT CAGES. THERE WAS LIMITED EVIDENCE THAT TILLAGE REDUCED THE PROPORTION OF MALE BEES EMERGING INTO CAGES, SUGGESTING THAT TILLAGE DID NOT IMPACT SEX RATIO. THERE WAS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT TILLAGE DELAYED EMERGENCE OF SURVIVING OFFSPRING. TILLAGE PRACTICES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN MANAGING FIELDS FOR THIS GROUND NESTING BEE.

DRS ARE TRACKS (20-75 M WIDE) WITH SEMI-NATURAL VEGETATION, PROTECTED FOR THEIR PRIORITY FUNCTION OF TRANSHUMANT LIVESTOCK HERDING. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSE THE BEE COMMUNITY OF ONE OF THE MAIN, SPANISH DRS, AND EVALUATE ITS EFFECTS ON FLOWER VISITATION AND SEED SET IN ADJACENT SUNFLOWER FIELDS. WE USED PAN TRAPS TO ASSESS BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS AT 13 SITES ALONG THE DR AND IN ADJACENT SUNFLOWER FIELDS AT 10, 75 AND 150M FROM THE DR. WE ALSO CONDUCTED VISUAL COUNTS TO ASSESS VISITATION RATES TO SUNFLOWER HEADS AND MEASURED SEED SET. WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE DR THAN IN SUNFLOWER FIELDS, BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG DISTANCES WITHIN SUNFLOWER FIELDS. HONEY BEE ABUNDANCE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE DR AND SUNFLOWER FIELDS. WILD BEE VISITATION TO SUNFLOWER HEADS WAS HIGHER AT 10 M COMPARED TO 75 AND 150 M FROM THE DR, BUT DIFFERENCES IN HONEY BEE VISITATION WERE NON-SIGNIFICANT. SUNFLOWER SEED SET WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT 10 M COMPARED TO 75 AND 150 M, AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH WILD BEE ABUNDANCE, BUT NOT WITH HONEY BEE ABUNDANCE.

TOXICOL. CHEM.,"NEARLY 80\% OF ALL PESTICIDES APPLIED TO ROW CROPS ARE HERBICIDES, AND THESE APPLICATIONS POSE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ECOTOXICOLOGICAL RISKS TO NONTARGET PLANTS AND ASSOCIATED POLLINATORS. IN RESPONSE TO THE WIDESPREAD OCCURRENCE OF WEED SPECIES RESISTANT TO GLYPHOSATE, BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE DEVELOPED CROPS RESISTANT TO THE SYNTHETIC-AUXIN HERBICIDES DICAMBA AND 2,4-DICHLOROPHENOXYACETIC ACID (2,4-D), AND ONCE COMMERCIALIZED, ADOPTION OF THESE CROPS IS LIKELY TO CHANGE HERBICIDE-USE PATTERNS. DESPITE CURRENT LIMITED USE, DICAMBA AND 2,4-D ARE OFTEN RESPONSIBLE FOR INJURY TO NONTARGET PLANTS, BUT EFFECTS OF THESE HERBICIDES ON INSECT COMMUNITIES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TO UNDERSTAND THE INFLUENCE OF DICAMBA ON POLLINATORS, THE AUTHORS APPLIED SEVERAL SUBLETHAL, DRIFT-LEVEL RATES OF DICAMBA TO ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA L.) AND EUPATORIUM PERFOLIATUM L. AND EVALUATED PLANT FLOWERING AND FLORAL VISITATION BY POLLINATORS. THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT DICAMBA DOSES SIMULATING PARTICLE DRIFT (APPROXIMATE TO 1\% OF THE FIELD APPLICATION RATE) DELAYED ONSET OF FLOWERING AND REDUCED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS OF EACH PLANT SPECIES, HOWEVER, PLANTS THAT DID FLOWER PRODUCED SIMILAR-QUALITY POLLEN IN TERMS OF PROTEIN CONCENTRATIONS. FURTHER, PLANTS AFFECTED BY PARTICLE DRIFT RATES WERE VISITED LESS OFTEN BY POLLINATORS. BECAUSE PLANTS EXPOSED TO SUBLETHAL LEVELS OF DICAMBA MAY PRODUCE FEWER FLORAL RESOURCES AND BE LESS FREQUENTLY VISITED BY POLLINATORS, USE OF DICAMBA OR OTHER SYNTHETIC-AUXIN HERBICIDES WITH WIDESPREAD PLANTING OF HERBICIDE-RESISTANT CROPS WILL NEED TO BE CAREFULLY STEWARDED TO PREVENT POTENTIAL DISTURBANCES OF PLANT AND BENEFICIAL INSECT COMMUNITIES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.

AM.,"ANTHROPOGENIC CHANGES IN LAND USE AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ARE THOUGHT TO BE GREATER DRIVERS OF DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATING INSECTS SUCH AS BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APIFORMES) THAN AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND PESTICIDE USE. YET, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED HOW HABITAT FRAGMENTATION BY URBANIZATION AFFECTS POLLINATOR NESTING DYNAMICS. WE INVESTIGATED THE NESTING DYNAMICS OF NATIVE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES THAT INHABIT FRAGMENTS OF SONORAN DESERT IN TUCSON, AZ. SPECIFICALLY, WE COMPARED FLORAL DENSITIES, NEST COMPLETION, AND NEST ATTACK RATES OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES IN LARGE (> 2 HA) AND SMALL (< 0.5 HA) FRAGMENTS. IN SMALL FRAGMENTS, WHERE RESOURCE DENSITY WAS HIGH, MORE NESTS WERE OCCUPIED AND FEMALES RESPONDED BY PROVISIONING OFFSPRING MORE QUICKLY THAN IN LARGER FRAGMENTS WHERE RESOURCE DENSITY WAS LOW. HOWEVER, NESTS IN SMALL FRAGMENTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE ATTACKED BY NATURAL ENEMIES THAN THOSE IN LARGE FRAGMENTS. IN THIS DESERT SYSTEM, HABITAT SIZE, THE MOST-OFTEN USED METRIC FOR EXAMINATION OF HOW POLLINATORS RESPOND TO HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, AFFECTS NESTING DYNAMICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS THROUGH ITS INTERACTIONS WITH NEST-SITE AVAILABILITY, ABUNDANCE OF FLORAL RESOURCES, AND NATURAL ENEMY ATTACK.

THE EFFECT OF SUCH SUBSTANCES ON THE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF POLLINATORS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. USING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS IN TIGHTLY-CONTROLLED LABORATORY SETTINGS, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE ALKALOID NICOTINE ON BUMBLEBEE FORAGING PERFORMANCE. WE FOUND THAT BUMBLEBEES CONFRONTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH TWO EQUALLY REWARDED NICOTINE-CONTAINING AND NICOTINE-FREE FLOWER TYPES ARE DETERRED ONLY BY UNNATURALLY HIGH NICOTINE CONCENTRATIONS. THIS DETERRENCE DISAPPEARS OR EVEN TURNS INTO ATTRACTION AT LOWER NECTAR-RELEVANT CONCENTRATIONS. THE ALKALOID HAS PROFOUND EFFECTS ON LEARNING IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER. AT A HIGH NATURAL DOSE, BEES LEARN THE COLOUR OF A NICOTINE-CONTAINING FLOWER TYPE MORE SWIFTLY THAN A FLOWER TYPE WITH THE SAME CALORIC VALUE BUT WITHOUT NICOTINE. FURTHERMORE, AFTER EXPERIENCING FLOWERS CONTAINING NICOTINE IN ANY TESTED CONCENTRATION, INCREASING NUMBERS OF BUMBLEBEES STAY MORE FAITHFUL TO THESE FLOWERS, EVEN IF THEY BECOME A SUBOPTIMAL CHOICE IN TERMS OF REWARD.

ECOL.,"THE PROCESS OF DISPERSAL CAN SHAPE ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES, BUT ITS INFLUENCE IS THOUGHT TO BE SMALL COMPARED TO THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION OR DIRECT SPECIES INTERACTIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES. ANTS CAN INFLUENCE MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF INSECTS AND THE MICROBES THEY VECTOR, POTENTIALLY AFFECTING MICROBIAL ESTABLISHMENT ON PLANTS, INCLUDING IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. HERE, WE EXAMINE HOW THE PRESENCE OF AGGRESSIVE ANTS, WHICH CAN INFLUENCE FLORAL VISITATION BY BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS, SHAPES THE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION OF BACTERIA AND FUNGI ON COFFEE FLOWERS IN FARMS THAT DIFFER IN SHADE MANAGEMENT INTENSITY. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE PRESENCE OF AGGRESSIVE ANTS SHOULD REDUCE THE FREQUENCY AND DIVERSITY OF FLORAL VISITORS. FINALLY, WE PREDICTED THAT THE EFFECTS OF ANTS SHOULD BE STRONGER IN THE LOW-SHADE FARM, WHICH HAS A LESS DIVERSE COMMUNITY OF FLORAL VISITORS. WE SAMPLED MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES FROM NECTAR AND PISTILS OF COFFEE FLOWERS NEAR AND FAR FROM NESTS OF THE AGGRESSIVE ANT AZTECA SERICEASUR ACROSS TWO FARMS THAT VARY IN SHADE MANAGEMENT AND DIVERSITY OF FLORAL VISITORS. BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS CHARACTERIZED USING ILLUMINA SEQUENCING OF THE 16S AND ITS REGIONS OF THE RRNA GENE. CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATION, AZTECA PRESENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER AND DIVERSITY OF VISITORS, VISIT DURATION AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS VISITED. AZTECA PRESENCE INFLUENCED MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES, BUT EFFECTS DIFFERED BETWEEN FARMS. AZTECA NESTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BACTERIAL DIVERSITY IN BOTH FARMS, BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FLOWERS ON TREES WITH AND WITHOUT AZTECA WAS GREATER IN THE HIGH-SHADE FARM. AZTECA NESTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FUNGAL DIVERSITY IN THE HIGH-SHADE FARM, BUT NOT THE LOW-SHADE FARM. IN ADDITION, THE PRESENCE OF ANTS WAS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIES COMPOSITION OF FUNGI AND BACTERIA IN FLOWERS, BUT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN ANT AND NO-ANT COMMUNITIES WAS GREATER IN THE LOW-SHADE FARM. SPECIFIC OPERATIONAL TAXONOMIC UNITS (OTUS) WERE DIFFERENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF ANTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT INDIRECT INTERACTIONS THAT INFLUENCE DISPERSAL MAY HAVE LARGE EFFECTS ON MICROBIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PARTICULARLY IN EPHEMERAL MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES.

THIS STUDY EXPLORES POLLINATOR SERVICE VERSUS DISSERVICE IN LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY (VACCINIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM) PRODUCTION. THIS CROP IS HIGHLY MANAGED, REQUIRES INSECT POLLINATION, AND HAS A RELATIVELY LONG BLOOM, WHEN COMBINED, THESE CHARACTERISTICS MAY CAUSE A PORTION OF EARLY SEASON POLLINATION TO RESULT IN PREMATURE RIPENING AND LOSS. TO TEST THIS, WE EXPOSED EARLY AND LATE FLOWERING CLONES TO EARLY SEASON (WILD) POLLINATION ONLY OR LATE SEASON (WILD AND MANAGED) POLLINATION ONLY. CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESIS OF DISSERVICE, PRE-HARVEST LOSS, SHATTER, AND SUGAR CONTENT WERE CONSISTENT ACROSS TREATMENTS, EVEN THOUGH EARLY SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS EXHIBITED HEAVIER BERRIES. REMARKABLY, EARLY SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS PRODUCED OVER 70\% OF THE TOTAL PRODUCTION OF LATE SEASON POLLINATION PLOTS.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE USE OF THE BANKER PLANT CALENDULA OFFICINALIS L. TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BY INCREASING THE ABUNDANCE OF NATURAL ENEMIES FOR BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF TOMATO PESTS, PROVIDING FORAGE RESOURCES TO WILD BEES, AND IMPROVING CROP YIELD. C. OFFICINALIS WAS SELECTED FOR THIS EXPERIMENT AS IT IS USED AS A BANKER PLANT FOR DICYPHINI (HEMIPTERA: MIRIDAE) PREDATORS. STRIPS OF FLOWERING C. OFFICINALIS WERE ESTABLISHED IN THE FIELD EDGES OF TOMATO FIELDS AND ARTHROPOD VISITATION TO C. OFFICINALIS STRIPS AND TOMATO WAS MEASURED. CROP DAMAGE FROM MULTIPLE PESTS OF TOMATO WAS ASSESSED IN FIELDS WITH C. OFFICINALIS STRIPS AND CONTROL SITES. THE CONTRIBUTION OF POLLINATION TO CROP YIELD WAS ASSESSED THROUGH A POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT. THE INCLUSION OF C. OFFICINALIS IN TOMATO FIELDS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF DICYPHINI, PARASITOIDS, BEES AND OTHER ARTHROPOD GROUPS WITHIN THESE STRIPS. A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL LEAF CROP DAMAGE FROM LEPIDOPTERA PESTS WAS RECORDED IN FIELDS WITH C. OFFICINALIS STRIPS. INCREASED FRUIT SET AND BIOMASS WERE RECORDED IN OPEN-POLLINATED TOMATO BUT THIS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN CONTROL AND C. OFFICINALIS FIELDS.

THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS ALPINUS (LINNAEUS, 1758) HAS A DISJOINT DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTED TO FENNOSCANDIA AND THE ALPS, AND IS CONSIDERED THREATENED. WE STUDIED THE ECOLOGY AND DISTRIBUTION OF B. ALPINUS IN THE ALPS, WHERE THE ENDEMIC SUBSPECIES BOMBUS ALPINUS HELLERI DALLA TORRE 1882 IS FOUND, AS A CASE-MODEL BECAUSE OF ITS RARITY, HABITAT, AND MUTUAL DEPENDENCE WITH THE ECOSYSTEM FOR POLLINATION AND RESOURCES. WE DEVELOPED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS INCLUDING BOTH CLIMATIC AND HABITAT VARIABLES TO OBTAIN THE SURFACE SUITABLE FOR THIS SUBSPECIES AND QUANTIFIED ITS PROTECTED PORTION. OUR ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THIS BUMBLEBEE IS RESTRICTED TO THE UPPER ALTITUDES AND HAS A NARROW NICHE MAINLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE OF GLACIERS, THE COOL TEMPERATURE, A LOW TEMPERATURE VARIATION, AND A SPECIFIC RANGE OF PRECIPITATION. A STRONG ALTITUDINAL SHIFT IS ALSO TAKING PLACE PROBABLY DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AFTER YEARS OF NO CHANGES IN ALTITUDINAL DISTRIBUTION, ITS LOWEST ALTITUDINAL LIMIT HAS MOVED UP 479 M SINCE THE YEAR 1984, WHILE ITS UPPER ALTITUDINAL LIMIT HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED. OVER HALF OF THE SUITABLE AREA IN THE ALPS IS INCLUDED WITHIN PROTECTED AREAS, BUT CONSERVATION HAS NOT BEEN PLANNED YET. HOWEVER, RARE SPECIES WITH NARROW NICHE, SUCH AS B.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION ADVOCATES THE HARNESSING OF REGULATING AND SUPPORTING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO PROMOTE MORE SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION, AND THIS RELIES ON EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF NON-CROPPED HABITATS. HEDGEROWS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THE LANDSCAPE IN MANY FARMING SYSTEMS ACROSS THE WORLD, MANAGEMENT OF WHICH PROVIDES A POTENTIAL MECHANISM TO ENHANCE ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION. HERE WE INVESTIGATE THE VALUE OF HEDGEROWS IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND AS A SOURCE OF FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT TAXA, AND HOW HEDGEROW QUALITY AND LOCAL LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION IMPACT ON THEIR POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTION TO SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN ARABLE LANDSCAPES. WE SHOW THAT HEDGEROWS ARE A SOURCE HABITAT FOR MANY NATURAL ENEMIES WHICH SPILL OVER INTO NEIGHBOURING FIELDS, AND THAT HEDGEROWS PROVIDE A VALUABLE FORAGE RESOURCE AND CORRIDOR FOR MOVEMENT OF POLLINATORS. HEDGEROW QUALITY AFFECTS THESE BENEFITS AND CONTINUOUS UNBROKEN HEDGEROWS, WITH A HIGH DIVERSITY OF WOODY SPECIES, ARE MORE VALUABLE FOR THE PROVISION OF BUMBLEBEES AND LINYPHIID SPIDERS, WHILE THE PRESENCE OF TREES WITHIN THE HEDGEROW SUPPORTS LYCOSID SPIDERS. FLORAL RESOURCES, BEYOND THE WOODY HEDGEROW SPECIES THEMSELVES, ARE ALSO A KEY FORAGE RESOURCE FOR HOVERFLIES. THE IMPACT OF THESE HEDGEROWS ON INVERTEBRATE ABUNDANCE IS MODERATED BY LOCAL LANDSCAPE, AND HEDGEROWS ARE A MORE VALUABLE FORAGE RESOURCE FOR POLLINATORS IN MORE INTENSELY MANAGED LANDSCAPES. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ABUNDANT AND A BROAD RANGE OF NATURAL ENEMIES AND POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, BOTH HEDGEROWS AND LOCAL SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND MANAGED. THE BENEFIT OF HEDGEROWS, AS A HABITAT FOR FUNCTIONALLY IMPORTANT TAXA DEPENDS ON HEDGEROW QUALITY AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SUCH AS AVOIDING GAPS, HIGH HEDGE SPECIES DIVERSITY AND MAINTAINING AN ABUNDANT UNDERSTORY OF PLANTS, CAN IMPROVE THEIR VALUE FOR ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION.",ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; HEDGEROWS; POLLINATION; POLLINATORS; PEST REGULATION; NATURAL ENEMIES; ECOLOGICAL INTENSIFICATION,PEST-CONTROL; AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION; STAPHYLINID BEETLES; WINTER-WHEAT; SERVICES; RESTORATION; HABITAT; APHID; FIELD; CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,21,"GARRATT, MPD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV READING, CTR AGRIENVIRONMENTAL RES CAER, SCH AGR POLICY \& DEV, READING RG6 6AR, BERKS, ENGLAND.;GARRATT, MICHAEL P.

ECOL.,"FIRE REPRESENTS A FREQUENT DISTURBANCE IN MANY ECOSYSTEMS, WHICH CAN AFFECT PLANT-POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES AND HENCE THE SERVICES THEY PROVIDE. FURTHERMORE, FIRE EVENTS COULD AFFECT THE ARCHITECTURE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION NETWORKS, MODIFYING THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF COMMUNITIES. SOME POLLINATORS, SUCH AS WOOD-NESTING BEES, MAY BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY FIRE EVENTS DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE NESTING MATERIAL AND ITS LONG REGENERATION TIME. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER FIRE INFLUENCES THE STRUCTURE OF BEE-PLANT INTERACTIONS. HERE, WE USED QUANTITATIVE PLANT-WOOD-NESTING BEE INTERACTION NETWORKS SAMPLED ACROSS FOUR DIFFERENT POST-FIRE AGE CATEGORIES (FROM FRESHLY-BURNT TO UNBURNT SITES) IN AN ARID ECOSYSTEM TO TEST WHETHER THE ABUNDANCE OF WOOD-NESTING BEES, THE BREADTH OF RESOURCE USE AND THE PLANT-BEE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE CHANGE ALONG A POST-FIRE AGE GRADIENT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT FRESHLY-BURNT SITES PRESENT HIGHER ABUNDANCES OF GENERALIST THAN SPECIALIST WOOD-NESTING BEES AND THAT THIS TRANSLATES INTO LOWER NETWORK MODULARITY THAN THAT OF SITES WITH GREATER POST-FIRE AGES. BEES DO NOT SEEM TO CHANGE THEIR FEEDING BEHAVIOUR ACROSS THE POST-FIRE AGE GRADIENT DESPITE CHANGES IN FLORAL RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.

BIOGEOGR.,"AIMSPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS ARE OFTEN USED TO PROJECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, MOST MODELS DO NOT CONSIDER WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF ABIOTIC FACTORS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. IF THEY CHANGE, THIS HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF HOW ABIOTIC CHANGES AFFECT SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS. HERE, WE USE SPATIALLY EXPLICIT HISTORICAL DATA ON SPECIES OCCURRENCES, CLIMATE AND LAND USE TO TEST WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT CLIMATIC AND LAND-USE DRIVERS AS DETERMINANTS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS HAS REMAINED CONSTANT OVER A PERIOD OF >60YEARS (1951-2014). LOCATIONTHE NETHERLANDS. METHODSUSING SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS AND A COMPREHENSIVE COUNTRY-WIDE DATASET AT 5X5KM RESOLUTION, WE MODELLED THE DISTRIBUTION OF A TOTAL OF 398 POLLINATOR SPECIES (BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES) FOR THREE PERIODS (1951-1970, 1971-1990 AND 1998-2014). WE THEN EVALUATED WHETHER THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIABLES RELATED TO CLIMATE (PRECIPITATION, TEMPERATURE) AND LAND USE (LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION) IN DETERMINING POLLINATOR DISTRIBUTIONS HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. RESULTSVARIABLES RELATED TO LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION WERE HIGHLY IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING POLLINATOR DISTRIBUTIONS IN ALL PERIODS. PRECIPITATION WAS GENERALLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN TEMPERATURE, AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION LESS THAN LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION. LAND-USE VARIABLES REMAINED EQUALLY IMPORTANT ACROSS TIME FOR ALL POLLINATOR GROUPS, EXCEPT FOR BEES WHERE THE IMPORTANCE OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER TIME. AMONG CLIMATE VARIABLES, THE IMPORTANCE OF PRECIPITATION DID NOT CHANGE ACROSS TIME FOR ANY POLLINATOR GROUP. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF TEMPERATURE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT TIMES FOR BEES AND HOVERFLIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONSDETERMINANTS OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS CAN CHANGE IN THEIR IMPORTANCE OVER TIME WHEN CHANGES IN THE MAGNITUDE AND RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OCCUR. GIVEN FUTURE TEMPERATURE RISES, OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS CALIBRATED WITH CURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PREDICT THE FUTURE IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN DRIVING SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS.",BIODIVERSITY CHANGE; CLIMATE CHANGE; ECOLOGICAL NICHE MODELS; ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLE IMPORTANCE; GLOBAL WARMING; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; HABITAT LOSS; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS,SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; BIODIVERSITY; SHIFTS; VULNERABILITY; CONSERVATION; PREDICTIONS; BUTTERFLIES; DEPENDS; TRAITS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"AGUIRRE-GUTIERREZ, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), NAT BIODIVERS CTR, TERR ZOOL, POSTBUS 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;AGUIRRE-GUTIERREZ, JESUS, BIESMEIJER, JACOBUS C., REEMER, MENNO, CARVALHEIRO, LUISA G., NAT BIODIVERS CTR, TERR ZOOL, POSTBUS 9517, NL-2300 RA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS.;AGUIRRE-GUTIERREZ, JESUS, KISSLING, W.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"THERE IS CONSENSUS THAT LAND-USE CHANGE IS A MAIN DRIVER BEHIND THE RECENT DECLINES OF MANY POLLINATOR POPULATIONS IN EUROPE. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL NOT ADEQUATELY UNDERSTOOD HOW THE LOCAL RESOURCE QUALITY AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION INFLUENCE POLLINATORS, AND IF AND HOW THE EFFECTS VARY IN SPACE AND TIME. WE ANALYSED THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE- (2 KM RADIUS) AND LOCAL SCALE- (50 M TRANSECTS) RESOURCES ON BUMBLEBEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DURING TWO YEARS IN SOUTH-EASTERN NORWAY, WHERE AGRICULTURE IS HIGHLY MODERNISED BUT LANDSCAPES STILL SHOW LIMITED SPATIAL HOMOGENIZATION. LOCAL FLOWER DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE STRONGLY POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH BUMBLEBEE DENSITIES AND SPECIES RICHNESS, BUT HIGHER LANDSCAPE-LEVEL FLOWER SPECIES RICHNESS WERE LINKED TO LOWER LOCAL BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCES. EARLY AND LATE MASS FLOWERING CROPS HAD CLEAR, BUT CONTRASTING, EFFECTS. THE TOTAL AREA OF EARLY FLOWERING CROPS HAD A CONSISTENT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BUMBLEBEE DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS THROUGHOUT THE SEASON, WHILE LATE FLOWERING CROPS HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SEASON BEFORE THEIR BLOOM, SUGGESTING A CARRY-OVER EFFECT FROM PREVIOUS YEARS. THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EARLY FLOWERING CROPS COULD BE DUE TO COMPETITION OF BUMBLEBEES WITH HONEY-BEES, WHICH ARE WIDELY USED IN THESE CROPS. BUMBLEBEE DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE CLEARLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE TOTAL AREA OF FOREST AND FLOWER-POOR LAND USE AREAS, INCLUDING GRASS FIELDS AND CEREALS. IN CONTRAST, BUMBLEBEES WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MOST LINEAR ELEMENTS IN THE LANDSCAPE (ESPECIALLY PASTURE AND CROPLAND VERGES), EXCEPT FOR ROADS, WHICH NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BUMBLEBEE DENSITIES, POSSIBLY DUE TO INCREASED MORTALITY, SINCE THE QUALITY OF THE FLOWER RESOURCES DID NOT DIFFER FROM OTHER LINEAR ELEMENTS. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE QUALITY AND THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTRIBUTION OF FLOWER RESOURCES WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR BUMBLEBEES, BUT CAN CREATE COUNTERINTUITIVE DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS DEPENDING ON THE TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF THE SURVEY. INCREASING FLOWER RESOURCES IN LINEAR ELEMENTS AND THE AMOUNT OF LATE MASS-FLOWERING CROPS MAY BE VIABLE MANAGEMENT MEASURES TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS FOR BUMBLEBEES IN MODERATELY INTENSIFIED LANDSCAPES.

NAT. HIST.,"THE STUDY OF NESTING BIOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL ASPECT FOR BOTH CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT, BUT DESPITE THIS, ONLY A FEW OF THE OVER 20,000 DESCRIBED BEE SPECIES HAVE HAD THEIR NESTING BIOLOGY STUDIED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE AND ANALYSE THE NESTING BIOLOGY AND DYNAMIC OF AN AGGREGATION OF THE CAVITY-NESTING BEE SPECIES CENTRIS ANALIS DURING ONE GENERATION. TWENTY-EIGHT FEMALES WERE MARKED AND HAD THEIR NESTING ACTIVITIES DOCUMENTED, 64 NESTS WERE SAMPLED, AND 113 INDIVIDUALS EMERGED FROM THESE NESTS. AN ASYMMETRY IN THE SEX ALLOCATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THIS SPECIES, AND THE SEX RATIO WAS MALE-BIASED IN THE FIRST NESTS BUILT. NONETHELESS, CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE, THE FEMALES SHOWED DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, WITH SOME OF THEM PRODUCING MORE DAUGHTERS, OTHER FEMALES PRODUCING MORE SONS, AND STILL OTHERS PRODUCING AN EQUAL PROPORTION. THE PRODUCTIVITY PER FEMALE WAS LOW COMPARED TO THAT OF OTHER SOLITARY BEE SPECIES, AND THE FEMALES DISPLAYED AN AGGRESSIVE USURPATION BEHAVIOUR AGAINST CONSPECIFIC FEMALES AND PERFORMED AN INTRASPECIFIC PARASITISM. AS THE SUBSTRATE USED TO NEST IS A LIMITING FACTOR FOR THIS SPECIES, THE USURPATION BEHAVIOUR MAY BE AN IMPORTANT STRATEGY THAT COULD INCREASE THE CHANCE OF NESTING. A FEW MALES USED THE NESTING SITE AS A RESTING PLACE AND THE FIDELITY OBSERVED TO THIS LOCALE WAS HIGH.

HOLLENS H;VAN DER NIET T;COZIEN R;KUHLMANN M,HOLLENS H,A SPUR-IOUS INFERENCE: POLLINATION IS NOT MORE SPECIALIZED IN LONG-SPURRED THAN IN SPURLESS SPECIES IN DIASCIA-REDIVIVA MUTUALISMS,FLORA,FLORA,"PLANT SPECIES OCCUPY A CONTINUUM FROM EXTREME GENERALIZATION TO EXTREME SPECIALIZATION IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF POLLINATOR SPECIES THEY UTILIZE, OFTEN IRRESPECTIVE OF THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE POLLINATOR SPECIES. IT IS LARGELY UNCLEAR WHAT FLORAL TRAITS DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF SPECIALIZATION. HERE WE STUDY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CO-FLOWERING OIL-PRODUCING DIASCIA SPECIES AND OIL-COLLECTING REDIVIVA BEE SPECIES AT A SITE IN THE CAPE FLORISTIC REGION OF SOUTH AFRICA TO QUANTIFY THE LEVEL OF SPECIALIZATION AND IDENTIFY THE TRAITS THAT MEDIATE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. FOUR REDIVIVA SPECIES, ENCOMPASSING A TWO-FOLD DIFFERENCE IN FORELEG-LENGTH, ALL VISITED TWO DIASCIA SPECIES, WHICH DIFFERED EIGHT-FOLD IN SPUR LENGTH, BUT THE LONGEST AND SHORTEST-LEGGED BEE SPECIES MOST FREQUENTLY AND PREFERENTIALLY VISITED LONG-SPURRED AND SHORT-SPURRED DIASCIA SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY. A THIRD REDIVIVA SPECIES, WITH FORELEGS OF INTERMEDIATE LENGTH, VISITED BOTH SPECIES AND DID NOT DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN DIASCIA SPECIES. PREVIOUSLY, MOST DIASCIA SPECIES WERE THOUGHT TO SHARE SIMILAR CUES FOR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, HOWEVER, OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT SPECIES-SPECIFIC FLORAL CUES FILTER POORLY-MATCHING REDIVIVA SPECIES AND ENABLE PARTITIONING OF THE LOCAL REDIVIVA ASSEMBLAGE BY CO-OCCURRING DIASCIA SPECIES. ASSESSMENTS OF SEED SET FOLLOWING SINGLE VISITS BY POLLINATORS REVEALED NO DIFFERENCE IN PER-VISIT EFFECTIVENESS AMONG REDIVIVA SPECIES, SUGGESTING THAT MORPHOLOGICAL MATCHING DOES NOT NECESSARILY AFFECT POLLEN DEPOSITION EFFICIENCY AND THAT VARIATION IN FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS DETERMINED BY MATCHING BETWEEN FLOWER AND POLLINATOR MORPHOLOGY IS AN UNLIKELY DRIVER OF SPUR-LENGTH EVOLUTION IN DIASCIA. FURTHER, OUR STUDY RAISES THE INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT THE NATURE OF REWARD PRESENTATION IN THE LONG-SPURRED D. `FLORIBUNDA' MAY EVEN COUNTERACT SPECIALIZATION FOR EXCLUSIVE POLLINATION BY LONG-LEGGED SPECIES, AND, THUS, THE UNIDIRECTIONAL EVOLUTION OF SPUR LENGTH FUNDAMENTAL TO THE CO-EVOLUTIONARY ARMS RACES ASSUMED TO HAVE DRIVEN THE EVOLUTION OF ELONGATED SPURS.

EISEN K;CASE AL;CARUSO CM,EISEN K,VARIATION IN POLLEN-DISPENSING SCHEDULES OF LOBELIA SIPHILITICA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,INT. J. PLANT SCI.,"PREMISE OF RESEARCH.MANY MECHANISMS HAVE EVOLVED THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN EXPORTED AND THE NUMBER OF PLANTS THAT RECEIVE THIS POLLEN. ONE SUCH MECHANISM IS POLLEN PRESENTATION, WHERE PLANTS REGULATE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN AVAILABLE TO A POLLINATOR DURING A SINGLE VISIT. PRESENTING EITHER A CONSTANT PROPORTION OR AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF AVAILABLE POLLEN SHOULD MAXIMIZE MALE FITNESS IN MOST POLLINATOR ENVIRONMENTS. BUT FOR CONSTANT OR INCREASING POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULES TO EVOLVE, VARIATION IN THESE SCHEDULES MUST HAVE A HERITABLE COMPONENT.METHODOLOGY.WE MEASURED POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULES OF LOBELIA SIPHILITICA BY SIMULATING A SEQUENCE OF 16 BEE VISITS TO FLOWERS PRODUCED BY PROGENY OF 10 OPEN-POLLINATED MATERNAL FAMILIES. A COMPONENT OF THE POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULE (THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AT THE END OF THE VISITATION SEQUENCE) WAS MEASURED FOR PLANTS FROM ALL OF THE FAMILIES. THE COMPLETE POLLEN PRESENTATION SCHEDULE WAS MEASURED FOR PLANTS FROM FOUR OF THE 10 FAMILIES.PIVOTAL RESULTS.LOBELIA SIPHILITICA FLOWERS DISPENSED A MEAN OF 8.76\% 1.37\% OF AVAILABLE POLLEN IN THE FIRST SIMULATED VISIT, WHICH IS LOW RELATIVE TO FLOWERS OF 31 OTHER SPECIES. THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE POLLEN DISPENSED DECLINED ACROSS SIMULATED VISITS. THE REPEATABILITY, WHICH PLACES AN UPPER LIMIT ON THE HERITABILITY, WAS 0.29 FOR THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AFTER THE SIMULATED VISITS.CONCLUSIONS.LOBELIA SIPHILITICA FLOWERS DISPENSED A DECLINING PROPORTION OF THEIR AVAILABLE POLLEN, WHICH IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTION THAT CONSTANT OR INCREASING PROPORTIONAL POLLINATION SCHEDULES SHOULD EVOLVE. HOWEVER, THE REPEATABILITY FOR THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN REMAINING IN THE FLOWER AFTER THE SIMULATED VISITS WAS LOW RELATIVE TO THE HERITABILITY FOR OTHER FLORAL TRAITS IN L.

IN MONOECIOUS PLANTS WITH SELF-MIMICRY POLLINATION SYSTEMS, THE MIMIC-MODEL RATIO IS DETERMINED BY THE FLORAL SEX RATIO. WHILE AN EQUAL SEX RATIO (1:1) COULD PROVIDE THE PERFECT BALANCE BETWEEN POLLEN DONORS AND STIGMA SURFACES ABLE TO RECEIVE THE POLLEN, AN UNEQUAL RATIO COULD INCREASE POLLINATION BY PRODUCTION OF A GREATER NUMBER OF REWARDING, MODEL FLOWERS. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO TEST THE DIFFERENCES IN VISITATION FREQUENCY AND REPRODUCTIVE RATES OF DIFFERENT MIMIC AND MODEL FLOWER ARRAYS IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE MIMETIC SYSTEM IN A BEGONIA CUCULLATA POPULATION. THE FREQUENCIES OF VISITORS TO GROUPS OF FLOWERS WITH THREE DISTINCTIVE SEX RATIO ARRAYS (MALE-BIASED, FEMALE-BIASED AND EQUAL RATIO) WERE COMPARED USING A BAYESIAN APPROACH. THE REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES WERE COMPARED IN ORDER TO DETECT ADVANTAGES OF PARTICULAR SEX RATIOS. LOW VISITATION FREQUENCY WAS RECORDED IN ALL ARRAYS. POLLINATORS SHOWED SIMILAR BEHAVIOUR REGARDLESS OF SEX RATIO, THEY TENDED TO AVOID FEMALE, REWARDLESS FLOWERS. POLLINATION QUALITY WAS HIGHEST IN THE EQUAL SEX RATIO ARRAY. THE CURRENT STUDY SHOWS THAT SEX RATIO PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE POLLINATION OF B. CUCULLATA AND THAT THE EFFICACY OF THE SELF-MIMICRY SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE DOUBTFUL.

PARASITISM CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF MORTALITY FOR INSECT POPULATIONS, HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE FACTORS INFLUENCING VULNERABILITY OF WILD BEES TO PARASITES. MASON BEES (GENUS OSMIA, HYMENOPTERA: MEGACHILIDAE) ARE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF CROPS AND WILD PLANTS AND ARE VULNERABLE TO ATTACK BY BROOD PARASITES. HIGH NEST DENSITIES MAY INCREASE RATES OF BROOD PARASITISM BY ATTRACTING DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBERS OF PARASITES. 2. THREE YEARS OF FIELD OBSERVATIONS FROM MULTIPLE SITES WERE ANALYSED TO ASSESS WHETHER MASON BEE BROOD PARASITISM INCREASED WITH HOST DENSITY. MASON BEES WERE ALLOWED TO NEST IN ARTIFICIAL NESTING BLOCKS AND ESTABLISH NATURAL VARIATION IN NESTING DENSITY. NEST CELLS CONSTRUCTED BY BEES WERE CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF PARASITE EGGS. 3. PARASITISM OF NEST CELLS STRONGLY INCREASED WITH THE NUMBER OF ACTIVELY NESTING BEES AT A NESTING BLOCK. MASON BEES SHOWED NO PREFERENCE FOR NESTING IN BLOCKS THAT WERE OCCUPIED OR UNOCCUPIED BY OTHER MASON BEES. PARASITISM ALSO INCREASED WITH THE NUMBER OF DAYS A NEST WAS PROVISIONED AND DECREASED OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON. NEST CELLS CONSTRUCTED LAST IN A NEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PARASITISED THAN INNER CELLS, DESPITE BEING SEALED AGAINST INVASIONS. 4. THESE FINDINGS SHOW POSITIVELY DENSITY-DEPENDENT PARASITISM IN MASON BEES. THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT BEES TERMINATE PARASITISED NESTS, CAUSING PARASITISED CELLS TO BECOME OUTERMOST NEST CELLS-A BEHAVIOUR THAT MAY REPRESENT A DEFENCE AGAINST PARASITES.

HEIL LJ;BURKLE LA,HEIL LJ,RECENT POST-WILDFIRE SALVAGE LOGGING BENEFITS LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FLORAL AND BEE COMMUNITIES,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,FOR. ECOL. MANAGE.,"UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF SHIFTS IN DISTURBANCE REGIMES FOR PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL LAND MANAGEMENT. WILDFIRES ARE ESSENTIAL NATURAL DISTURBANCES THAT ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF FOREST BIODIVERSITY, AND THERE IS OFTEN PRESSURE TO RESPOND TO WILDFIRE WITH MANAGEMENT LIKE POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING (I.E., REMOVAL OF DEAD TREES FOR ECONOMIC VALUE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WILDFIRE). WE INVESTIGATED HOW LOCAL FLORAL AND BEE DENSITY, SPECIES RICHNESS, AND COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND DISPERSION WERE INFLUENCED BY POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING, AND HOW THESE EFFECTS DIFFERED BETWEEN AN OLDER (24 YEARS-SINCE-FIRE) AND A MORE RECENT (8 YEARS-SINCE FIRE) WILDFIRE IN THE GALLATIN NATIONAL FOREST, MONTANA USA. WE ALSO TESTED HOW THESE LOCAL PATTERNS SCALED UP TO INFLUENCE LANDSCAPE PATTERNS IN FLORAL AND BEE DIVERSITY. AFTER RECENT WILDFIRE, LOCAL FLORAL AND BEE DENSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS WERE HIGHER IN LOGGED THAN IN UNLOGGED SITES, AND THESE EFFECTS WERE VARIABLE OVER THE COURSE OF THE GROWING SEASON. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN COMMUNITY DISPERSION EXCEPT THAT OF BEES IN LOGGED AREAS OF THE RECENT WILDFIRE, WHICH WERE LESS HETEROGENEOUS COMPARED TO UNLOGGED AREAS. DESPITE THIS REDUCTION IN BEE COMMUNITY HETEROGENEITY, OVERALL BEE DIVERSITY WAS HIGHEST ACROSS LOGGED AREAS OF THE RECENT FIRE. WHILE THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING ON LOCAL DENSITY AND RICHNESS DID NOT PERSIST IN THE OLDER FIRE, COMPOSITIONAL DIFFERENCES IN FLOWERS AND BEES BETWEEN LOGGED AND UNLOGGED AREAS WERE OBSERVED IN BOTH THE RECENT AND OLDER WILDFIRE. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE LOCAL BENEFITS OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING FOR FLORAL AND BEE RICHNESS ARE EVIDENT WITHIN A DECADE OF THESE DISTURBANCES, BUT HAVE DIMINISHED WITHIN A QUARTER CENTURY OF FIRE. NEVERTHELESS, COMPOSITIONAL EFFECTS PERSIST, RESULTING IN HIGHER OVERALL LANDSCAPE FLORAL AND BEE DIVERSITY WHEN BOTH LOGGED AND UNLOGGED AREAS OF EACH WILDFIRE WERE PRESENT. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE FOR NEAR-TERM BENEFITS OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING FOR LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FLORAL AND BEE COMMUNITIES.

POLLEN PLACED ON A POLLINATOR'S BODY CAN BE PICKED UP BY CONSPECIFIC STIGMAS OR IT CAN BE COLLECTED BY THE POLLINATOR AS FOOD. HYPOTHETICALLY, ONE SOLUTION IS FOR POLLEN TO BE PLACED ON `SAFE SITES' ON THE POLLINATOR'S BODY, SITES WHERE THE POLLINATOR CANNOT EASILY REMOVE IT, LEAVING THE POLLEN FOR STIGMAS. WE COMPARED 14 SITES ON THE BUMBLEBEE BODY IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY OF THE BEE TO GROOM OFF FLUORESCENT POWER, A DUST THAT MAY BE THOUGHT OF AS ANALOGOUS TO POLLEN. THE SAFEST SITES WERE ALONG THE MIDLINE OF THE DORSAL THORAX, THE DORSAL ABDOMEN, AND THE VENTRAL ABDOMEN. NEXT, WE COUNTED HOW MUCH POLLEN IS BORNE ON THE 14 SITES BY BEES VISITING ONE NECTARIFEROUS AND THREE NECTARLESS PEDICULARIS SPECIES. IN THE FOUR SPECIES, ONLY 7, 26, 28, AND 30\% OF POLLEN FOUND ON THE BEES WERE ON SAFE SITES. FINALLY, WE OBSERVED THAT THE 14 SITES WERE CONTACTED BY STIGMAS OF THE FOUR PEDICULARIS SPECIES, NONE OF THE MOST CONTACTED SITES WERE SAFE SITES. ACROSS ALL FOUR PEDICULARIS SPECIES, POLLEN IS MAINLY POSITIONED ON SITES OF THE BEE BODY THAT WERE BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH THE PLANT AND THE BEE, NOT ON SITES DETRIMENTAL TO EITHER OF THEM. OUR ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN FLOWERS AND BEES CAN BE SOLVED BY COOPERATION.

IN ISOLATED HABITATS SUCH AS INSELBERGS LITTLE IS YET KNOWN ABOUT THE TEMPORAL DYNAMICS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES AND INTERACTING BEE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, THE OBJECTIVE IS TO VERIFY THE EFFECT OF SEASONALITY ON THE BEE-PLANT INTERACTION IN AN ATLANTIC FOREST INSELBERG IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL. THE BEES WERE SAMPLED MONTHLY IN THE DRY (APRIL/2008-SEPTEMBER/2008) AND WET SEASONS (OCTOBER/2008-MARCH/2009) USING AN ENTOMOLOGICAL NET. A TOTAL OF 322 BEES OF 33 SPECIES WERE CAPTURED ON FLOWERS OF 34 SPECIES OF PLANTS DURING THE YEAR. BEES RICHNESS WAS SIMILAR BETWEEN SEASONS (22 SPECIES IN THE WET SEASON AND 21 IN THE DRY SEASON), BUT ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHER IN THE WET SEASON (60\% OF INDIVIDUALS) AND HIGHER DIVERSITY OCCURRED IN THE DRY SEASON. AUGOCHLOROPSIS SP1 WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES AND VISITED THE LARGEST NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES AT EACH SEASON. IN THE INTERACTION NETWORK, PLANTS WITH THE HIGHEST DEGREE WERE DISTINCT BETWEEN THE SEASONS. THE NUMBER OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS WAS HIGHER IN THE DRY SEASON COMPARED TO THE WET SEASON AND CONNECTANCE WAS SIMILAR, NESTEDNESS HOWEVER VARIED BETWEEN THE SEASONS. THE COMPOSITION OF PLANT AND BEES SPECIES WAS DISTINCT BETWEEN THE SEASONS, AS WELL AS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM, MAINLY DUE TO THE ALTERATION IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE PLANT SPECIES AND THE CHANGE IN THE CHOICE OF THE BEES FOR THE FLORAL RESOURCES BETWEEN THE SEASONS.",FLORAL VISITORS; SEASONALITY; SEMIDECIDUAL FOREST; ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS,POLLINATION; AREA; HYMENOPTERA; NETWORKS; APIDAE; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; COMMUNITY; OUTCROPS; DOMAIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"MARQUES, MF (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL NORTE FLUMINENSE, CTR BIOCIENCIAS \& BIOTECNOL, LAB CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS, AVE ALBERTO LAMEGO 2000,PARQUE CALIFORNIA, BR-28013602 CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, RJ, BRAZIL.;MARQUES, M.

WHICH PLANT SPECIES THEY CHOOSE AS NESTING MATERIAL AND WHY THEY DO SO HAVE REMAINED OBSCURE. WE ASKED THE FOLLOWING: (1) HOW ARE THE PLANT SPECIES USED BY LEAFCUTTER BEES DISTRIBUTED PHYLOGENETICALLY? (2) DOES PLANT CHOICE DIFFER ACROSS GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS, AND IF SO, IN WHAT WAYS? (3) ARE THE LEAF PLANT SPECIES NATIVES OR EXOTICS? (4) WHAT PLANT AND LEAF TRAITS PREDICT SELECTION OF PLANT SPECIES BY LEAFCUTTER BEES? AND (5) DOES THE ABUNDANCE OF INDIVIDUALS PER SPECIES IN THE HABITAT INFLUENCE LEAFCUTTER BEES' PLANT PREFERENCES?

HOVERFLIES VISITING FLOWERING PLANTS WERE CAPTURED IN EACH PLOT DURING 10 MINUTES. PATH ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS AND SYRPHID ABUNDANCE. FLOWER ABUNDANCE HAD A STRONG POSITIVE DIRECT EFFECT ON SYRPHID ABUNDANCE BUT HAD INDIRECT EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER OF SYRPHID SPECIES. ONLY ALTITUDE HAD A STRONG POSITIVE DIRECT EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF SYRPHID SPECIES AND THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE DIFFERENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. SOME PLANT SPECIES ATTRACTED MORE SYRPHIDS THAN OTHERS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER SPECIES OF HOVERFLY PER PLOT WITH INCREASING NUMBERS OF FLOWERS.

SCHENK M;KRAUSS J;HOLZSCHUH A,SCHENK M,DESYNCHRONIZATIONS IN BEE-PLANT INTERACTIONS CAUSE SEVERE FITNESS LOSSES IN SOLITARY BEES,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,J. ANIM. ECOL.,"1. GLOBAL WARMING CAN DISRUPT MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOLITARY BEES AND PLANTS WHEN INCREASING TEMPERATURE DIFFERENTIALLY CHANGES THE TIMING OF INTERACTING PARTNERS. ONE POSSIBLE SCENARIO IS FOR INSECT PHENOLOGY TO ADVANCE MORE RAPIDLY THAN PLANT PHENOLOGY. 2. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR FITNESS CONSEQUENCES DUE TO TEMPORAL MISMATCHES IS LACKING FOR POLLINATORS AND IT REMAINS UNKNOWN IF BEES HAVE DEVELOPED STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE FITNESS LOSSES FOLLOWING TEMPORAL MISMATCHES. 3. WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF TEMPORAL MISMATCHES ON THE FITNESS OF THREE SPRING-EMERGING SOLITARY BEE SPECIES, INCLUDING ONE POLLEN SPECIALIST. USING FLIGHT CAGES, WE SIMULATED (I) A PERFECT SYNCHRONIZATION (FROM A BEE PERSPECTIVE): BEES AND FLOWERS OCCUR SIMULTANEOUSLY, (II) A MISMATCH OF 3DAYS AND (III) A MISMATCH OF 6DAYS, WITH BEES OCCURRING EARLIER THAN FLOWERS IN THE LATTER TWO CASES. 4. A MISMATCH OF 6DAYS CAUSED SEVERE FITNESS LOSSES IN ALL THREE BEE SPECIES, AS FEW BEES SURVIVED WITHOUT FLOWERS. FEMALES SHOWED STRONGLY REDUCED ACTIVITY AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT COMPARED TO SYNCHRONIZED BEES. FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF A 3-DAY MISMATCH WERE SPECIES-SPECIFIC. BOTH THE EARLY-SPRING SPECIES OSMIA CORNUTA AND THE MID-SPRING SPECIES OSMIA BICORNIS PRODUCED THE SAME NUMBER OF BROOD CELLS AFTER A MISMATCH OF 3DAYS AS UNDER PERFECT SYNCHRONIZATION. HOWEVER, O.CORNUTA DECREASED THE NUMBER OF FEMALE OFFSPRING, WHEREAS O.BICORNIS SPREAD THE BROOD CELLS OVER FEWER NESTS, WHICH MAY INCREASE OFFSPRING MORTALITY, E.G. DUE TO PARASITOIDS. THE LATE-SPRING SPECIALIST OSMIA BREVICORNIS PRODUCED FEWER BROOD CELLS EVEN AFTER A MISMATCH OF 3DAYS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FITNESS LOSSES AFTER TEMPORAL MISMATCHES ARE HIGHER DURING WARM THAN COLD SPRINGS, AS THE NATURALLY OCCURRING TEMPERATURE VARIABILITY REVEALED THAT WARM TEMPERATURES DURING STARVATION DECREASED THE SURVIVAL RATE OF O.BICORNIS. 5. WE CONCLUDE THAT SHORT TEMPORAL MISMATCHES CAN CAUSE CLEAR FITNESS LOSSES IN SOLITARY BEES.

ENTOMOL.,"ONION (ALLIUM CEPA L.) IS ONE OF THE MAIN VEGETABLE CROPS. POLLINATORS ARE REQUIRED FOR ONION SEED PRODUCTION, BEING HONEYBEES THE MOST USED. AROUND THE WORLD, TWO TYPES OF ONION VARIETIES ARE GROWN: OPEN POLLINATED (OP) AND HYBRIDS. HYBRIDS OFFER NUMEROUS ADVANTAGES TO GROWERS, BUT USUALLY HAVE LOWER SEED YIELDS THAN OP CULTIVARS, WHICH IN MANY CASES COMPROMISE THE SUCCESS OF NEW HYBRIDS. AS POLLINATION IS CRITICAL FOR SEED SET, UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF FLORAL REWARDS AND ATTRACTANTS TO POLLINATOR SPECIES IS THE KEY TO IMPROVE CROP SEED YIELD. IN THIS STUDY, THE CORRELATION OF NECTAR-ANALYZED COMPOUNDS, FLORAL TRAITS, AND SEED YIELD UNDER OPEN FIELD CONDITIONS IN TWO EXPERIMENTAL SITES WAS DETERMINED. NECTAR COMPOSITION WAS DESCRIBED THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF SUGARS, PHENOL, AND ALKALOID COMPOUNDS. LENGTH AND WIDTH OF THE STYLE AND TEPALS OF THE FLOWERS WERE MEASURED TO DESCRIBE FLORAL TRAITS. FLORAL AND NECTAR TRAITS SHOWED DIFFERENCES AMONG THE STUDIED LINES. FOR NECTAR TRAITS, WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE PLANTS WERE CULTIVATED. NONETHELESS, FLOWER TRAITS WERE NOT INFLUENCED BY THE EXPERIMENTAL SITES.THE OP AND THE MALE-STERILE LINES (MSLS) SHOWED DIFFERENCES IN NECTAR CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND FLORAL TRAITS.

PLANT SCI.,"NECTAR IS A FLORAL REWARD THAT SUSTAINS MUTUALISMS WITH POLLINATORS, WHICH IN TURN, IMPROVES FRUIT SET. WHILE IT IS KNOWN THAT NECTAR IS A CHEMICALLY COMPLEX SOLUTION, EXTENSIVE IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF THIS COMPLEXITY HAS BEEN LACKING. CUCURBITA MAXIMA CV. BIG MAX, LIKE MANY CUCURBITS, IS MONOECIOUS WITH SEPARATE MALE AND FEMALE FLOWERS. ATTRACTION OF BEES TO THE FLOWERS THROUGH THE REWARD OF NECTAR IS ESSENTIAL FOR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THIS ECONOMICALLY VALUABLE CROP. IN THIS STUDY, THE SEX-DEPENDENT VARIATION IN COMPOSITION OF MALE AND FEMALE NECTAR AND THE NECTARIES WERE DEFINED USING A COMBINATION OF GC-MS BASED METABOLOMICS AND LC-MS/MS BASED PROTEOMICS. METABOLOMICS ANALYSIS OF NECTAR DETECTED 88 METABOLITES, OF WHICH 40 WERE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED, AND INCLUDES SUGARS, SUGAR ALCOHOLS, AROMATICS, DIOLS, ORGANIC ACIDS, AND AMINO ACIDS. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN 29 METABOLITES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE NECTAR. THE NECTAR PROTEOME CONSISTS OF 45 PROTEINS, OF WHICH 70\% OVERLAP BETWEEN NECTAR TYPES. ONLY TWO PROTEINS ARE UNIQUE TO FEMALE NECTAR, AND 10 ARE SPECIFIC TO MALE NECTAR. THE NECTARY PROTEOME DATA, ACCESSIBLE AT PROTEOMEXCHANGE WITH IDENTIFIER PXD009810, CONTAINED 339 IDENTIFIABLE PROTEINS, 71\% OF WHICH WERE DESCRIPTIVELY ANNOTATABLE BY HOMOLOGY TO PLANTAE.

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ADAPTED FORAGE TYPES (SPECIES OR MIXTURES) AFFECTED INSECT POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE IN PASTURES. FORAGING INSECTS WERE COLLECTED USING BEE BOWLS AND COMPARED AMONG OWB ALONE, OWB MIXED WITH ALFALFA (MEDICAGO SATIVA L.), ALFALFA, AND A NATIVE GRASS MIX. TWENTYONE FAMILIES FROM FOUR ORDERS OF INSECTS WERE RECOVERED OVER 3 YR. SWEAT BEE (HYMENOPTERA: HALICTIDAE) WAS THE MOST ABUNDANT FAMILY, WITH 59\% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INSECTS COLLECTED.

J. BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF HETEROSPECIFIC POLLEN (HP) TRANSFER HAVE BEEN FOCUSED MAINLY ON INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES, DESPITE EVIDENCE OF INSECT VISITATION TO WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES AND TRANSFER OF THEIR POLLEN ONTO STIGMAS OF INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS. THUS, THE POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES OF HP TRANSFER FROM WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. FURTHERMORE, ACCUMULATION OF PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN POLLEN OF WIND-POLLINATED CROPS HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED, BUT ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON WILD PLANT SPECIES VIA HP TRANSFER HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED. METHODS: WE EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF WIND-DISPERSED ZEA MAYS POLLEN ON POLLEN TUBE GROWTH OF THE INSECT-POLLINATED MIMULUS NUDATUS VIA HAND POLLINATIONS. WE FURTHER EVALUATED WHETHER PESTICIDE-CONTAMINATED Z. MAYS POLLEN HAS LARGER EFFECTS ON M. NUDATUS POLLEN SUCCESS THAN NON-CONTAMINATED Z. MAYS POLLEN. KEY RESULTS: WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT OF Z. MAYS POLLEN ON M. NUDATUS POLLEN TUBE GROWTH EVEN WHEN DEPOSITED IN SMALL AMOUNTS. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY DIFFERENCE IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS EFFECT BETWEEN PESTICIDE-LADEN Z. MAYS POLLEN AND NON-CONTAMINATED Z. MAYS POLLEN. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES CAN HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS AS HP DONORS ON INSECT-POLLINATED RECIPIENTS. THUS, THEIR ROLE IN SHAPING CO-FLOWERING INTERACTIONS FOR WIND- AND INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES DESERVES MORE ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE THAT PESTICIDE CONTAMINATION INCREASED HP EFFECTS, WE CANNOT FULLY RULE OUT THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH AN EFFECT, BECAUSE POLLEN LOAD AND THUS THE PESTICIDE DOSE APPLIED TO STIGMAS WAS LOW.

SULFOXIMINE-BASED INSECTICIDES ARE THE MOST LIKELY SUCCESSOR(11), AND ARE EITHER LICENSED FOR USE OR UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR LICENSING IN SEVERAL WORLDWIDE MARKETS(3), INCLUDING WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION(12), WHERE CERTAIN NEONICOTINOIDS (IMIDACLOPRID, CLOTHIANIDIN AND THIAMETHOXAM) ARE NOW BANNED FROM AGRICULTURAL USE OUTSIDE OF PERMANENT GREENHOUSE STRUCTURES. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO PRE-EMPTIVELY EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS OF SULFOXIMINE-BASED PESTICIDES ON POLLINATORS(11), BECAUSE SUCH EFFECTS ARE RARELY DETECTED BY STANDARD ECOTOXICOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS, BUT CAN HAVE MAJOR IMPACTS AT LARGER ECOLOGICAL SCALES(13-15). HERE WE SHOW THAT CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO THE SULFOXIMINE-BASED INSECTICIDE SULFOXAFLOR, AT DOSAGES CONSISTENT WITH POTENTIAL POST-SPRAY FIELD EXPOSURE, HAS SEVERE SUB-LETHAL EFFECTS ON BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) COLONIES. FIELD-BASED COLONIES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO SULFOXAFLOR DURING THE EARLY GROWTH PHASE PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER WORKERS THAN UNEXPOSED CONTROLS, AND ULTIMATELY PRODUCED FEWER REPRODUCTIVE OFFSPRING.

WOODII AND USED MESH EXCLOSURES WHICH SELECTIVELY EXCLUDE ACCESS OF LARGER ANIMALS TO FLOWERS TO TEST THE IMPORTANCE OF BIRD VISITS FOR POLLINATION.

PLANTS WHICH COULD ONLY BE ACCESSED BY BEES AND OTHER SMALL INSECTS HAD FEW POLLINARIA REMOVED AND SET VERY FEW FRUITS RELATIVE TO PLANTS WHICH COULD ALSO BE ACCESSED BY LARGER ANIMALS SUCH AS SUNBIRDS. THE STURDY INFLORESCENCE STEM, AND THICK FLESHY PERIANTH TISSUE, ORANGE-RED COLOUR OF THE FLOWERS, LOW SCENT PRODUCTION AND LARGE VISCIDIA, ARE TRAITS SHARED WITH OTHER, DISTANTLY RELATED BIRD-POLLINATED SATYRIUM SPECIES AND CAN THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED LIKELY TO PLAY A FUNCTIONAL ROLE IN BIRD POLLINATION.

SEED CROPS, AND TO EXAMINE EFFECTS OF THIACLOPRID ON BUMBLE BEE COLONY DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIELD. THE REPELLENCY STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN A LARGE-SCALE FIELD TRIAL IN SE NORWAY IN 2013. ON AVERAGE FOR OBSERVATIONS DURING THE FIRST WEEK AFTER SPRAYING, 17 AND 40\% LESS HONEY BEES (P=.03) AND 26 AND 20\% LESS BUMBLE BEES (P=.36) WERE OBSERVED ON PLOTS SPRAYED WITH THE PYRETHROIDS LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN AND ALPHA-CYPERMETHRIN, RESPECTIVELY, THAN ON UNSPRAYED CONTROL PLOTS. NO POLLINATOR REPELLENCY WAS FOUND ON PLOTS SPRAYED WITH THE NEONICOTINOID THIACLOPRID. COMPARED WITH UNSPRAYED CONTROL THE SEED YIELD INCREASES WERE 22\% ON PLOTS SPRAYED WITH THIACLOPRID VS. 12-13\% ON PLOTS SPRAYED WITH PYRETHROIDS (P=.10). FOLLOW-UP STUDIES IN 2014-2016 FOCUSED ON THE EFFECT OF THIACLOPRID ON BUMBLE BEE COLONY DEVELOPMENT IN COMMERCIALLY REARED NESTS OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS PLACED INTO RED CLOVER SEED CROPS AT THE START OF FLOWERING. UNSPRAYED CONTROL CROPS WERE COMPARED WITH CROPS SPRAYED EITHER AT THE BUD STAGE OR WHEN 18-44\% OF FLOWER HEADS WERE IN FULL BLOOM. CHEMICAL ANALYSES OF ADULT BUMBLE BEES SHOWED THAT THIACLOPRID WAS TAKEN UP IN BEES WHEN CROPS WERE SPRAYED DURING FLOWERING, BUT NOT DETECTED WHEN CROPS WERE SPRAYED AT THE BUD STAGE. THE BUMBLE BEES IN LATE-SPRAYED CROPS ALSO DEVELOPED WEAKER COLONIES THAN IN UNSPRAYED CROPS. DEAD BEES WITH A HIGH INTERNAL CONCENTRATION OF THIACLOPRID WERE FOUND IN ONE CROP SPRAYED DURING THE NIGHT AT 35\% FLOWERING.

IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT THREE MITOCHONDRIAL GENOMES (MITOGENOMES) OF ANDRENA SPECIES, WHICH ARE THE POLLINATORS OF CAMELLIA OLEIFERA. COMPARED WITH PUTATIVE ANCESTRAL GENE ARRANGEMENT OF INSECTS, THE THREE MITOGENOMES PRESENT IDENTICAL GENE REARRANGEMENT EVENTS, INCLUDING LOCAL INVERSION (TRNR) AND GENE SHUFFLING (TRNQ/TRNM, TRNK/TRND, AND TRNW/TRNC-TRNY). MOST PCGS INITIATE WITH STANDARD ATN CODON AND SHARE THE STOP CODON OF TAA OR TAG, WHEREAS TRUNCATED STOP CODON T WAS DETECTED IN THE ATP6 GENE OF A. CHEKIANGENSIS. FURTHERMORE, THE NAD4 GENE END WITH A SINGLE T IN ALL THREE ANDRENA SPECIES. ALL TRNAS COULD BE FOLDED INTO CLOVER-LEAF SECONDARY STRUCTURE EXCEPT FOR TRNS1, WITH THE DIHYDROURACIL (DHU) ARM FORMING A SIMPLE LOOP. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ON 17 ANDRENA MITOGENOMES. MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND BAYESIAN METHODS GENERATE IDENTICAL TOPOLOGY, IN WHICH A. HUNANENSIS AND A. STRIATA FORM A GROUP AND ARE CLOSE TO A. CAMELLIA. ALTHOUGH A. CHEKIANGENSIS IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A. CAMELLIA BY MORPHOLOGICAL METHODS, A. CHEKIANGENSIS AND A.

MONTANE MEADOWS ARE BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS FOR FLOWERING PLANTS AND POLLINATORS, BUT THEY ARE CONTRACTING DUE TO TREE INVASION.OBJECTIVESTHIS STUDY QUANTIFIED FLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR FLOWER-VISITOR SPECIES IN MONTANE MEADOWS IN THE WESTERN CASCADE RANGE OF OREGON. SPECIES DIVERSITY IN SMALL, ISOLATED MEADOWS WAS EXPECTED TO BE LOWER AND NESTED RELATIVE TO LARGE MEADOWS. ALTERNATIVELY, LANDFORM FEATURES MAY INFLUENCE RICHNESS AND SPATIAL TURNOVER.METHODSFLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR VISITORS WERE SAMPLED IN SUMMERS OF 2011-2017 IN TWELVE MONTANE MEADOWS WITH VARYING SOIL MOISTURE. ALL FLOWERING PLANTS AND ALL FLOWER-VISITORS WERE RECORDED DURING FIVE TO SEVEN 15MIN WATCHES IN TEN 3X3M PLOTS IN EACH MEADOW AND YEAR.RESULTSA TOTAL OF 178 FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES, 688 FLOWER-VISITOR SPECIES AND 137,916 INTERACTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED. RICHNESS OF FLOWER-VISITORS WAS RELATED TO MEADOW PATCH SIZE, BUT NEITHER PLANT NOR FLOWER-VISITOR RICHNESS WAS RELATED TO ISOLATION MEASURED AS MEADOW AREA WITHIN 1000M.

COMMUN.,"MAINTENANCE OF POLYMORPHISM BY OVERDOMINANCE (HETEROZYGOTE ADVANTAGE) IS A FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPT IN EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. IN MOST EXAMPLES KNOWN IN NATURE, OVERDOMINANCE IS A RESULT OF HOMOZYGOTES SUFFERING FROM DELETERIOUS EFFECTS.

PHENOTYPIC, METABOLOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC ANALYSES REVEAL THAT THE MORPHS DIFFER SOLELY IN CYANIDIN PIGMENTS, WHICH ARE LINKED TO DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF AN ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (ANS) GENE. THIS EXPRESSION DIFFERENCE IS CAUSED BY A PREMATURE STOP CODON IN AN ANS-REGULATING R2R3-MYB TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR, WHICH IS HETEROZYGOUS IN THE RED COLOUR MORPH. FURTHERMORE, FIELD OBSERVATIONS SHOW THAT BEE AND FLY POLLINATORS HAVE OPPOSITE COLOUR PREFERENCES, THIS RESULTS IN HIGHER FITNESS (SEED SET) OF THE HETEROZYGOUS MORPH WITHOUT DELETERIOUS EFFECTS IN EITHER HOMOZYGOUS MORPH.

APPL. ECOL.,"THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION ON BEE COMMUNITIES ARE WELL DOCUMENTED. TO REVERSE THESE EFFECTS, FLOWERING HABITAT ENHANCEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITIONAL RESOURCES FOR WILD BEES AND ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN FEW RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. YET, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER OR HOW HABITAT ENHANCEMENTS SUPPORT BEE POPULATIONS UNDER VARYING LANDSCAPE CONTEXTS. BODY SIZE IS A MORPHOLOGICAL TRAIT THAT IS STRONGLY LINKED TO FORAGING ABILITY, IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND FITNESS IN BEES. LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SIZE DECLINES ACROSS BEE TAXA AND SMALLER BODY SIZE CAN BE AN EARLY INDICATOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION ON BODY SIZE CAN BE IMPROVED BY ADDING FLORAL RESOURCES TO FARM LANDSCAPES, WE MEASURED THE BODY SIZE OF 10 WILD BEE SPECIES COLLECTED AT 70 SITES WITH OR WITHOUT HABITAT ENHANCEMENTS IN MICHIGAN AND NEW YORK. BEES WERE COLLECTED AT SITES WITH VARYING AMOUNTS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, ALLOWING US TO TEST WHETHER MORPHOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO ENHANCEMENTS ARE AFFECTED BY LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION. HALF OF THE BEE SPECIES MEASURED EXHIBITED DECLINING BODY SIZE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE GRADIENT. AMONG THESE SPECIES, DECLINES WERE BUFFERED BY THE PRESENCE OF HABITAT ENHANCEMENTS SUGGESTING THIS RESPONSE IS THE RESULT OF IMPROVED NUTRITION, REDUCED NEED FOR LONG-DISTANCE FORAGING, ENHANCED RECRUITMENT OF LARGER INDIVIDUALS OR A COMBINATION OF THESE MECHANISMS. DECLINES IN BODY SIZE WERE STRONGEST IN BOTH THE SMALLEST AND THE LARGEST SPECIES. LARGE AND MEDIUM SIZED SPECIES EXHIBITED THE GREATEST RESPONSE TO FLOWERING HABITAT ENHANCEMENTS. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. AT SITES WITH HIGH AGRICULTURAL COVER, WE OBSERVED INTRASPECIFIC BODY SIZE DECLINES AMONG MANY SPECIES, HOWEVER, WE DID NOT OBSERVE DECREASED BODY SIZE IN ANY SPECIES AT SITES WITH A FLOWERING HABITAT ENHANCEMENT.

ALONG GEOGRAPHIC GRADIENTS, ACROSS DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES) IS RELATIVELY WELL UNDERSTOOD. HOWEVER, WE KNOW MUCH LESS ABOUT HOW THESE COMMUNITIES VARY AT SMALL SCALES WITHIN A UNIFORM LANDSCAPE. PLANTS ARE SESSILE AND HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO MICROHABITAT CONDITIONS, WHEREAS POLLINATORS ARE HIGHLY MOBILE AND, FOR THE MOST PART, DISPLAY GENERALIST FEEDING HABITS. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT PLANTS TO SHOW GREATER SPATIAL VARIABILITY THAN POLLINATORS. WE ANALYSED THE SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY OF A COMMUNITY OF FLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR POLLINATORS IN 40 PLOTS ACROSS A 40-KM(2) AREA WITHIN AN UNINTERRUPTED MEDITERRANEAN SCRUBLAND. WE RECORDED 3577 POLLINATOR VISITS TO 49 PLANT SPECIES. THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY (170 SPECIES) WAS STRONGLY DOMINATED BY HONEY BEES (71.8\% OF THE VISITS RECORDED). FLOWER AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES SHOWED SIMILAR BETA-DIVERSITY, INDICATING THAT SPATIAL VARIABILITY WAS SIMILAR IN THE TWO GROUPS. WE USED PATH ANALYSIS TO ESTABLISH THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF FLOWER COMMUNITY DISTRIBUTION AND HONEY BEE VISITATION RATE (A MEASURE OF THE USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES BY THIS SPECIES) ON THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY. WILD POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO FLOWER ABUNDANCE. WILD POLLINATOR VISITATION RATE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO FLOWER ABUNDANCE, SUGGESTING THAT FLORAL RESOURCES WERE NOT LIMITING. POLLINATOR AND FLOWER RICHNESS WERE POSITIVELY RELATED. POLLINATOR SPECIES COMPOSITION WAS WEAKLY RELATED TO FLOWER SPECIES COMPOSITION, REFLECTING THE GENERALIST NATURE OF FLOWER-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND THE OPPORTUNISTIC NATURE OF POLLINATOR FLOWER CHOICES. HONEY BEE VISITATION RATE DID NOT AFFECT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE WILD POLLINATOR COMMUNITY.

WE TESTED FOR POLLINATION SYNDROMES IN MERIANIEAE (MELASTOMATACEAE), WHICH CONTAIN BEE- (BUZZ-), HUMMINGBIRD-, FLOWERPIERCER-, PASSERINE-, BAT- AND RODENT-POLLINATED SPECIES. FURTHER, WE EXPLORED TRAIT CHANGES CORRELATED WITH THE REPEATED SHIFTS AWAY FROM BUZZ-POLLINATION, WHICH REPRESENTS AN `ADAPTIVE PLATEAU' IN MELASTOMATACEAE. WE USED RANDOM FOREST ANALYSES TO IDENTIFY KEY TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIFFERENT POLLINATORS OF 19 MERIANIEAE SPECIES AND ESTIMATED THE POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF 42 MORE SPECIES. WE EMPLOYED MORPHOSPACE ANALYSES TO COMPARE THE MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSITY (DISPARITY) AMONG SYNDROMES. WE IDENTIFIED THREE POLLINATION SYNDROMES ('BUZZ-BEE', `MIXED-VERTEBRATE' AND `PASSERINE'), CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENT POLLEN EXPULSION MECHANISMS AND REWARD TYPES, BUT NOT BY TRADITIONAL SYNDROME CHARACTERS. FURTHER, WE FOUND THAT `EFFICIENCY' RATHER THAN `ATTRACTION' TRAITS WERE IMPORTANT FOR SYNDROME CIRCUMSCRIPTION. CONTRARY TO SYNDROME THEORY, OUR STUDY SUPPORTS THE POOLING OF DIFFERENT POLLINATORS (HUMMINGBIRDS, BATS, RODENTS AND FLOWERPIERCERS) INTO THE `MIXED-VERTEBRATE' SYNDROME, AND WE FOUND THAT DISPARITY WAS HIGHEST IN THE `BUZZ-BEE' SYNDROME.

THIS IS THE FIRST EMPIRICAL STUDY TO EXPLORE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY STRUCTURE IN FOUR WIDELY ISOLATED NATURE RESERVES OF SOUTHERN PUNJAB, PAKISTAN, I.E., THE CENTRAL AGRICULTURAL PLAIN (PIROWAL FOREST), THE INDUS DELTA PLAIN (GHAZI GHAT WETLAND), HILLY MOUNTAINS (FORT MUNRO), AND A SANDY DESERT (LAL SUHANRA FOREST). SIX ASSEMBLAGE PARAMETERS, I.E., ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, DOMINANCE, EVENNESS, SIMPSON INDEX, AND SHANNON-WIENER INDEX, WERE STUDIED OVER SEVEN CONSECUTIVE MONTHS (FEBRUARY TO AUGUST 2012). MAXIMUM ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF THE POLLINATORS WERE RECORDED AT GHAZI GHAT (1354 INDIVIDUALS AND 84 SPECIES), FOLLOWED BY PIROWAL (1331 INDIVIDUALS AND 80 SPECIES), LAL SUHANRA (1197 INDIVIDUALS AND 77 SPECIES), AND FORT MUNRO (808 INDIVIDUALS AND 65 SPECIES). THE HIGHEST VALUES OF SIMPSON AND EVENNESS INDEXES WERE RECORDED AT FORT MUNRO, WHILE THE SHANNON-WIENER AND DOMINANCE INDEXES WERE HIGHEST AT GHAZI GHAT AND PIROWAL. SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHEST FOR BEES, WHILE IT WAS LOWEST FOR FLIES, YET THE LATTER WERE THE HIGHEST IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE FOUR POLLINATOR GROUPS. THE CURRENT STUDY IS A FIRST ACCOUNT OF POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE IN FOUR WIDELY ISOLATED FOREST RESERVES OF PUNJAB, PAKISTAN. THIS WILL SUPPORT ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT PLANNING, AND OPENS DOORS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH IN ORDER TO REVEAL COMPLEXITIES IN POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE ESPECIALLY IN RELATION WITH PLANT COMMUNITIES.

DHABAL S;VENKATESWARAN P,DHABAL S,AN IMPROVED GLOBAL-BEST-DRIVEN FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM FOR OPTIMAL DESIGN OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL FIR FILTER,SOFT COMPUTING,SOFT COMPUT.,"THE DESIGN OF TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) DIGITAL FILTER IS A HIGHER-ORDER, NONLINEAR, AND MULTI-MODAL OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM. THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN IMPROVED GLOBAL-BEST-DRIVEN FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM, NAMED AS GFPA, FOR THE DESIGN OF 2D FINITE IMPULSE RESPONSE (FIR) FILTERS. TWO METHODS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED-THE FIRST METHOD MINIMIZES THE WEIGHTED SQUARE ERROR VIA GFPA AND THE SECOND METHOD FINDS THE COEFFICIENTS OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL FIR FILTER BY GFPA BEFORE MCCLELLAN TRANSFORMATION. THE PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED ALGORITHM HAS BEEN COMPARED WITH STATE-OF-THE-ART ALGORITHMS AND THE SIMULATION RESULTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS. FOR THE DESIGN OF A 15X15 CIRCULAR SYMMETRIC FILTER, AN AVERAGE REDUCTION OF 55\% IN FITNESS FUNCTION EVALUATION AND 72\% IN EXECUTION TIME IS OBSERVED.

IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, LAWNS FORM A LARGE PORTION OF CULTIVATED LAND, AND ARE TYPICALLY MANAGED TO EXCLUDE FLOWERING SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EIGHT FLOWERING PLANTS WITH POLLINATOR VALUE (PLANTS THAT PROVIDE FLORAL NECTAR AND POLLEN FOR VISITING INSECTS) WHEN COSEEDED WITH THE TURFGRASS HARD FESCUE ( FESTUCA BREVIPILA TRACEY). THE STUDY WAS ESTABLISHED AS A DORMANT SEEDING AT TWO LOCATIONS IN CENTRAL MINNESOTA WITH SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT SOIL TYPES. PLOTS WERE MAINTAINED AT EITHER A 6- OR 9-CM MOWING HEIGHT. WE MONITORED THESE PLANTINGS OVER THE 2014, 2015, AND 2016 GROWING SEASONS FOR VEGETATIVE ESTABLISHMENT AND FLOWERING OF PLANTED FORBS. OF THE EIGHT FORBS TESTED, TRIFOLIUM REPENS L., PRUNELLA VULGARIS SSP. LANCEOLATA (W. BARTRAM) HULTEN, THYMUS SERPYLLUM AUCT. NON L., AND ASTRAGALUS CRASSICARPUS NUTT.

THE NECTAR HAS TWO DISTINCT SMELLS, ONE OF HONEY, WHICH ATTRACTS BEES, AND ONE OF ROTTING MATERIAL, WHICH ATTRACTS FLIES. THE ANTHERS CONTAINED AMPLE FERTILE POLLEN, APRE-REQUISITE FOR EFFECTIVE POLLINATION, BUT ALSO FOR SOLITARY BEES, WHO SPEND MOST OF THEIR TIME COLLECTING POLLEN, WHICH IS MIXED WITH ASMALL AMOUNT OF NECTAR AS FOOD SUPPLY FOR THEIR YOUNG. IN THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT, SORBUST. POLLINATION WAS BY BUMBLE BEES, HONEY BEES, SOLITARY BEES, EXCEPT FOR THE SOLITARY OSMIA BEES, POSSIBLY DUE TO LACK OF NESTING STRUCTURES. 3)A LOCAL POLLINATION EXPERIMENT IN THE BONN REGION SHOWED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF SEEDS PER FRUIT, AS AMEASURE OF THE POLLINATION SUCCESS, WITH MANUAL CROSS-POLLINATION. THE POLLINATION SUCCESS RATE OF THE FREE BLOOMING CONTROL FLOWERS, TO WHICH THE FLOWER VISITORS HAD FREE ACCESS, WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION. THIS SUGGESTS THERE WAS ALIMITED SUPPLY OF POLLEN, PROBABLY CAUSED BY INSUFFICIENT POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH ATOTAL OF 88SPECIES WAS COUNTED ON THE FLOWERS. 4)THE RED-BROWN, CHERRY-SIZED FRUITS ARE DIFFICULT TO PICK FROM THE LARGE SOLITARY TREES BY LONG LADDERS. THE FRUITS CONTAINED UP TO FIVE SEEDS, RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MARZIPAN-LIKE TASTE ON FRUIT PROCESSING. DUE TO THE ASTRINGENT TASTE OF THE FRESH FRUIT, THEY MIGHT BE MORE SUITABLE FOR BREAD SPREADS, PRESERVES, JAM, DISTILLING INTO BRANDY AND DRIED FRUIT FOR AHEALTHY SNACK. 5)CHALLENGES OF SORBUS TORMINALIS CULTIVATION INCLUDE A)DETERMINATION OF THE OPTIMUM HARVEST DATE (OHD) AND UNIFORM MATURATION, B)ROOTSTOCK SELECTION FOR DWARFING AND EARLY YIELD AND C)COUNTERMEASURES AGAINST ALTERNATE/BIENNIAL BEARING. 6)ADVANTAGES OF SORBUS TORMINALIS CULTIVATION INCLUDE TOLERANCE TO FROST IN THE WINTER AND TO DROUGHT IN THE SUMMER AND HENCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND INCREASE IN BIODIVERSITY.",WILD SERVICE TREE (SORBUS TORMINALIS); ALTERNATE BEARING; BIENNIAL BEARING; BIODIVERSITY; CLIMATE CHANGE; FLOWER BIOLOGY; POLLINATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; RARE FRUIT,POLLINATION; ABORTION; HABITAT; EUROPE; PLANTS,GERMAN,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"BLANKE, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BONN, INRES GARTENBAUWISSENSCH, BONN, GERMANY.;WERRES, JULA, UNIV BONN, INRES AGR \& PROD OKOL, BONN, GERMANY.;BLANKE, MICHAEL, UNIV BONN, INRES GARTENBAUWISSENSCH, BONN, GERMANY.",10.1007/S10341-018-00413-1,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,NA,NA,0014-0309,2,165-177,SPRINGER,61,2019,ISI000467465000008,43,AGRICULTURE,14,HORTICULTURE,JWERRESUNI-BONN.DE MMBLANKEUNI-BONN.DE,HX5TA,"BLANKE, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BONN, INRES GARTENBAUWISSENSCH, BONN, GERMANY",ISI,none,UNIV BONN;UNIV BONN,UNIV BONN,NA,"WERRES J, 2019, ERWERBS-OBSTBAU","WERRES J, 2019, ERWERBS-OBSTBAU",NA,NA,NA,NA
