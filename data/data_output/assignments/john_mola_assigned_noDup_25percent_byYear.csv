ECOL.,"SELECTION FAVOURING AN OUTCROSSING PLANT'S ABILITY TO SIRE SEEDS GENERALLY PROMOTES FLORAL CHARACTERS THAT INCREASE (1) THE FREQUENCY OF POLLINATOR VISITS, (2) THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DISPERSED TO OTHER PLANTS BY EACH POLLINATOR AND (3) THE PROBABILITY OF A POLLEN GRAIN SUCCESSFULLY FERTILIZING AN OVULE AFTER REACHING A STIGMA. FLOWERS INFLUENCE POLLEN DISPERSAL AND FERTILIZATION PROBABILITIES BY DETERMINING THE PATTERN OF POLLEN REMOVAL DURING A SERIES OF VISITS (DISPENSING SCHEDULE). WE MODEL MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS TO IDENTIFY OPTIMAL DISPENSING SCHEDULES, WHICH CHARACTERISTICALLY INVOLVE MONOTONIC INCREASES IN THE PROPORTION OF REMAINING POLLEN REMOVED DURING SUCCESSIVE VISITS. THESE SCHEDULES BALANCE THE BENEFITS OF RESTRICTED REMOVAL, WHICH COUNTERACTS THE DIMINISHING RETURNS ASSOCIATED WITH ANIMAL POLLINATION (E.G. POLLINATOR GROOMING, LOCAL MATE COMPETITION), WITH THE ADVANTAGES OF INCREASED REMOVAL TO AVOID TIME-DEPENDENT LOSSES IN FERTILIZATION ABILITY (E.G. POLLEN PRECEDENCE, DECLINING VIABILITY). BECAUSE POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY MEDIATES THIS BALANCE, THE MOST EFFECTIVE DISPENSING SCHEDULE ALLOWS DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT OF REMOVAL TO THE PREVAILING FREQUENCY OF VISITS EXPERIENCED BY INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH DYNAMIC REMOVAL WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DISPENSING MECHANISM OF LUPINUS SERICEUS FLOWERS ALLOWS FACULTATIVE ADJUSTMENT OF REMOVAL TO THE INTERVAL BETWEEN VISITS. BECAUSE OPTIMAL CONTROL OF POLLEN REMOVAL CAN INCREASE A PLANT'S MATING OPPORTUNITIES BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, DISPENSING MECHANISMS SHOULD BE A COMMON COMPONENT OF FLORAL DESIGN.",FLORAL EVOLUTION; LUPINUS-SERICEUS; MALE FUNCTION; POLLEN DISPERSAL; POLLEN REMOVAL; SEXUAL STRATEGIES,BUMBLE BEES; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; SEXUAL SELECTION; SEED PRODUCTION; WILD RADISH; NECTAR; FLOWERS; REMOVAL; ATTRACTIVENESS; HERMAPHRODITE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,85,"HARDER, LD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALGARY,DEPT BIOL SCI,CALGARY T2N 1N4,AB,CANADA.",10.1007/BF01238257,"2-6 BOUNDARY ROW, LONDON, ENGLAND SE1 8HN",NA,NA,NA,0269-7653,5,542-559,CHAPMAN HALL LTD,8,1994,ISIA1994PF60800007,49,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, GENETICS \& HEREDITY",23,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, GENETICS \& HEREDITY",NA,PF608,"HARDER, LD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALGARY,DEPT BIOL SCI,CALGARY T2N 1N4,AB,CANADA",ISI,none,NA,UNIV CALGARY,NA,"HARDER LD, 1994, EVOL ECOL","HARDER LD, 1994, EVOL ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

THIS CHARACTER VARIES CONTINUOUSLY WITHIN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF I. AGGREGATA, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH WIDER FLOWERS EXPORT MORE POLLEN PER FLOWER TO SURROUNDING PLANTS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT THIS COMPONENT OF PHENOTYPIC SELECTION IS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PER-VISIT EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMMINGBIRDS, THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATOR IN OUR STUDY POPULATIONS. HERE WE INVESTIGATE MECHANISMS OF DIFFERENTIAL VISIT EFFECTIVENESS IN GREATER DETAIL. FIRST, COUNTS OF POLLEN IN UNVISITED FLOWERS SHOWED THAT POLLEN PRODUCTION ITSELF INCREASES WITH WIDTH. IN AVIARY EXPERIMENTS, HUMMINGBIRDS ALSO REMOVED A GREATER PROPORTION OF AVAILABLE POLLEN AS WIDTH INCREASED. WE NEXT VIDEOTAPED VISITS TO FLOWERS THAT VARIED IN WIDTH EITHER NATURALLY, OR BY EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT, AND FOUND THAT HUMMINGBIRDS INSERTED THEIR BILLS MORE DEEPLY INTO WIDER FLOWERS. FINALLY, WE DIRECTLY MANIPULATED HOW DEEPLY BIRDS COULD INSERT THEIR BILLS, AND FOUND THAT MORE POLLEN WAS REMOVED AFTER DEEP INSERTION. THUS, SEVERAL MECHANISMS APPEAR TO UNDERLIE SELECTION ON COROLLA WIDTH VIA VISIT EFFECTIVENESS IN POLLEN EXPORT. ONE INVOLVES A PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION WITH POLLEN PRODUCTION, THIS UNDERSCORES THE VALUE OF EXPERIMENTS FOR UNTANGLING INDIRECT FROM DIRECT SELECTION. ANOTHER MECHANISM INVOLVES DIRECT SELECTION DUE TO THE DEPTH OF INSERTION OF A HUMMINGBIRD'S BILL, THIS IS RARE EVIDENCE FOR ONE FORM OF SELECTION INVOLVING THE `'FIT'' BETWEEN POLLINATOR AND FLOWER.",POWER SHAPE AND SIZE; HUMMINGBIRD; IPOMOPSIS; MORPHOLOGY; PHENOTYPIC CORRELATION; POLLEN EXPORT AND PRODUCTION; POLLINATOR EFFECTIVENESS; SELECTION,RAPHANUS-SATIVUS L; FLORAL TRAITS; POLLINATION SUCCESS; NATURAL-SELECTION; WILD RADISH; QUANTITATIVE GENETICS; POLEMONIUM-VISCOSUM; DELPHINIUM-NELSONII; NECTAR PRODUCTION; BUMBLE BEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,117,"CAMPBELL, DR (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUT BIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717, USA.;ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,CRESTED BUTTE,CO 81224.;UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,DEPT BIOL,RIVERSIDE,CA 92521.",10.2307/2265543,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,5,1463-1472,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,77,1996,ISIA1996UX39600016,68,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,37,ECOLOGY,NA,UX396,"CAMPBELL, DR (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF IRVINE,DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUT BIOL,IRVINE,CA 92717, USA",ISI,none,ROCKY MT BIOL LABS;UNIV CALIF RIVERSIDE,UNIV CALIF IRVINE,NA,"CAMPBELL DR, 1996, ECOLOGY","CAMPBELL DR, 1996, ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA

APPL. ECOL.,"1. WHEN CONSIDERED TOGETHER, THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF BIOLOGICALLY SIMILAR ORGANISMS (E.G. POLLINATORS) WITHIN A COMMUNITY, ARE MORE POWERFUL IN ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF DISRUPTION THAN WHEN TAKEN SEPARATELY. THE LOG-NORMAL MODEL OF ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY IS ILLUSTRATED AS A TOOL IN APPLIED ECOLOGY. 2. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM SAMPLING POLLINATING BEES OVER 8 YEARS IN 13 BLUEBERRY FIELDS IN NEW BRUNSWICK, CANADA. THESE DATA WERE USED TO TEST THE LOG-NORMALITY OF THE SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO THE DISRUPTION OF COMMUNITIES BY APPLICATIONS OF THE INSECTICIDE FENITROTHION TO NEARBY FORESTS. 3. ECOSYSTEMIC INTEGRITY (HEALTH) OF THE LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY FIELDS WAS ASSESSED BY USING SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE IN SUGIHARA'S (1980) SEQUENTIAL BREAKAGE MODEL. THIS MODEL WAS USED TO TEST THE LOG-NORMALITY OF DATA SETS FROM FIELDS WHICH WERE AFFECTED AND UNAFFECTED BY FENITROTHION. 4. ON BOTH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL BASES, FIELDS UNAFFECTED BY THE PESTICIDE FITTED WELL TO THE LOG-NORMAL MODEL OF SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE, WHEREAS AFFECTED FIELDS DEPARTED FROM THAT PATTERN. THUS, THE RELATIONSHIP IS USEFUL BECAUSE THE SAMPLES FROM FIELDS AFFECTED BY FENITROTHION PRESUMABLY REPRESENT COMPROMISED INTEGRITY AND DECLINE IN ECOSYSTEMIC HEALTH. 5. SHANNON-WIENER'S HIERARCHICAL DIVERSITY INDICES AND JACCARD'S INDICES OF SIMILARITY WERE FOUND TO HAVE LITTLE VALUE IN MEASURING ECOSYSTEMIC HEALTH. FOR THE FORMER, NONE OF THE INDICES CALCULATED SHOWED ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COMMUNITIES WITH A LOGNORMAL PATTERN OF SPECIES DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE, AND THOSE WITHOUT IT. JACCARD'S INDEX OF SIMILARITY WAS LOW AND SIMILAR IN ALL THE CASES. 6. IN GENERAL, ECOSYSTEMIC HEALTH SHOULD NOT BE NARROWLY ASSESSED THROUGH BIODIVERSITY BUT MUST INCLUDE TAXONOMIC AND POPULATION CHANGES TOGETHER.

TSCHARNTKE T;GATHMANN A;STEFFAN-DEWENTER I,TSCHARNTKE T,BIOINDICATION USING TRAP-NESTING BEES AND WASPS AND THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES: COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND INTERACTIONS,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,J. APPL. ECOL.,"1, RESULTS FROM FOUR FIELD STUDIES SHOW THAT COMMUNITIES OF TRAP-NESTING BEES AND WASPS AND THEIR NATURAL ENEMIES ARE PROMISING BIOINDICATORS FOR ECOLOGICAL CHANGE OR HABITAT QUALITY. THESE SMALL AND EASY-TO-HANDLE COMMUNITIES CAN BE ANALYSED WITH RESPECT TO (I) SPECIES RICHNESS AND RELATED PARAMETERS, AND (II) ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OR INTERACTIONS. THE COMMUNITIES COMPRISE HYMENOPTERA (APIDAE, SPHECIDAE, EUMENIDAE, POMPILIDAE) AND NATURAL ENEMIES BELONGING TO MANY INSECT TAXA. TRAPS CONSISTED OF 150-200, 15-20-CM LONG, REED INTERNODES, PUT INTO TILLS OR PLASTIC TUBES OF 13-15 CM DIAMETER, WOODEN POSTS WITH 2-10 OF SUCH REED-FILLED TINS WERE EXPOSED ILL THE TARGET HABITAT. 2, SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BEES (BUT TROT WASPS) WERE CLOSELY RELATED TO PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE HABITAT, A MEASURE OF THE BEES' FOOD RESOURCE. HOWEVER, AVAILABILITY OF NEST SITES OF ABOVE-GROUND NESTING SPECIES WAS EQUALLY IMPORTANT: MEADOWS WITH OLD TREES SUPPORTED GREATER POPULATIONS THAN MEADOWS WITHOUT TREES. A THREEFOLD INCREASE IN EXPOSED TRAPS RESULTED IN A TWOFOLD INCREASE IN SPECIES. 3. THE SENSITIVITY OF THIS BIOINDICATOR SYSTEM PROFITS FROM THE FACT THAT EVALUATIONS RELY NOT ONLY ON PRESENCE/ABSENCE DATA, DESCRIPTIVE POPULATION ATTRIBUTES OR DIVERSITY INDICES, BUT ALSO ON INTERACTIONS OR ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS. MONITORING ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES OR MULTITROPHIC INTERACTIONS, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO SPECIES DIVERSITY, IS RARELY DONE BUT MUCH NEEDED. ECOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS INCLUDE (I) THE PERCENTAGE MORTALITY OF TRAP-NESTING BEES AND WASPS DUE TO PARASITOIDS AND PREDATORS, WHICH WAS CORRELATED WITH THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF THESE NATURAL ENEMIES, (II) SEED SET OF ALLOGAMOUS PLANTS DUE TO SUCCESSFUL POLLINATION BY TRAP-NESTING BEES, AND (III) BIOLOGICAL CONTROL BY THE PREDACIOUS WASPS. 4, WITH INCREASING ISOLATION OF FRAGMENTED HABITATS (WHEN TRAPS WERE EXPOSED IN A CLEARED AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE), BOTH SPECIES RICHNESS OF NATURAL ENEMIES AND PERCENTAGE MORTALITY (PARASITISM AND PREDATION) DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY. IN A COMPARISON OF HABITAT TYPES (GRASSLANDS AND FIELD MAL-GINS), SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE TRAP-NEST COMMUNITY CORRELATED WITH PLANT DIVERSITY, BUT PERCENTAGE MORTALITY, DUE TO PARASITISM AND PREDATION, WITH FIELD AGE ONLY. THE THRESHOLD DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST HABITAT WAS 106-530 M FOR A 10 50\% DECREASE IN MEAN MORTALITY, AND THE MORTALITY INCREASED GREATLY IN HABITATS THAT WERE OLDER THAN 5 YEARS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE STUDIES EMPHASIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A CONTINUUM OF OLD HABITAT PATCHES FOR THE AUGMENTATION OF NAT URAL ENEMIES. 5, EXPOSURE OF STANDARDIZED TRAPS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH WITH A SMALL, INTERACTING AND REPRODUCING COMMUNITY THAT CAN BE EASILY CHARACTERIZED BY SIMPLE PARAMETERS. TAXONOMY AND BIOLOGY ARE WELL KNOWN, AND QUICK EVALUATIONS CAN BE DONE USING THE CLOSE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF OCCUPIED TRAPS AND SPECIES RICHNESS. SPECIES RICHNESS OF TRAP-NESTING BEES AND WASPS WAS CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH THAT SAMPLED BY SWEEP NETS.

BOT.,"THE POLLINATORS OF 29 GINGER SPECIES REPRESENTING 11 GENERA IN RELATION TO CERTAIN FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN A MIXED-DIPTEROCARP FOREST IN BORNEO WERE INVESTIGATED. AMONG THE 29 SPECIES STUDIED, EIGHT WERE POLLINATED BY SPIDERHUNTERS (NECTARINIIDAE), 11 BY MEDIUM-SIZED AMEGILLA BEES (ANTHOPHORIDAE), AND TEN BY SMALL HALICTID BEES. THESE POLLINATION GUILDS FOUND IN GINGERS IN SARAWAK ARE COMPARABLE TO THE POLLINATION GUILDS OF NEOTROPICAL ZINGIBERALES, I.E., HUMMINGBIRD, AND EUGLOSSINE-BEE-POLLINATED GUILDS. CANONICAL DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATION GUILDS AND SUGGESTS THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL MORPHOLOGY. MOST SPECIES IN THE THREE GUILDS WERE SEPARATED ON THE PLOT BY THE FIRST AND SECOND CANONICAL VARIABLES. SPIDERHUNTER-POLLINATED FLOWERS HAD LONGER FLORAL TUBES, WHILE AMEGILLA-POLLINATED FLOWERS HAD WIDER LIPS THAN THE OTHERS, WHICH FUNCTION AS A PLATFORM FOR THE POLLINATORS.

STONE GN;GILBERT F;WILLMER P;POTTS S;SEMIDA F;ZALAT S,STONE GN,WINDOWS OF OPPORTUNITY AND THE TEMPORAL STRUCTURING OF FORAGING ACTIVITY IN A DESERT SOLITARY BEE,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,ECOL. ENTOMOL.,"1. FEMALES OF THE DESERT SOLITARY BEE ANTHOPHORA PAUPERATA COLLECT NECTAR AND POLLEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM ALKANNA ORIENTALIS (BORAGINACEAE). THE BEE AND PLANT ARE FOUND TOGETHER IN THE EARLY SPRING, LIVING IN THE BOTTOM OF STEEP-SIDED WADIS (DRY RIVER VALLEYS) AT AN ALTITUDE OF 1500 M IN EGYPTIAN SINAI. 2. FEMALE A. PAUPERATA SHOWED CLEAR MORNING AND AFTERNOON PEAKS IN FORAGING ACTIVITY, SEPARATED BY A 2-3 H MIDDAY PERIOD SPENT IN THEIR UNDERGROUND NESTS. THIS STUDY ANALYSES THE FOLLOWING IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE FACTORS STRUCTURING THIS DAILY PATTERN: THERMAL ASPECTS OF THE BEE AND ITS ENVIRONMENT, TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF RESOURCE PROVISION BY THE PLANT, AND FEMALE NECTAR AND POLLEN FORAGING BEHAVIOUR. 3. ALTHOUGH A. PAUPERATA CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL HEAT ENDOTHERMICALLY, MORNING AND EVENING AMBIENT TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW 10 DEGREES C DEFINED A THERMAL WINDOW WITHIN WHICH FORAGING OCCURRED. MAXIMUM AIR TEMPERATURES WERE MODERATE (25-30 DEGREES C), AND EXAMINATION OF THE PHYSIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR OF A. PAUPERATA SUGGESTS THAT THE MIDDAY REDUCTION IN FLIGHT ACTIVITY WAS NOT DUE TO THERMAL CONSTRAINTS. 4. ALKANNA ORIENTALIS PRODUCES PROTANDROUS HERMAPHRODITIC FLOWERS. FEMALE A. PAUPERATA COLLECTED POLLEN FROM MALE-PHASE FLOWERS AND HARVESTED NECTAR PREFERENTIALLY FROM FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH THE NECTAR STANDING CROP WAS RELATIVELY CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THE DAY, POLLEN AVAILABILITY PEAKED STRONGLY IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 5. FEMALE A. PAUPERATA VISITED YOUNG MALE-PHASE FLOWERS AS SOON AS THEY OPENED, GENERATING AN EARLY AFTERNOON PEAK IN POLLEN FORAGING ACTIVITY AND DEPLETING THE POLLEN STANDING CROP RAPIDLY. A MORNING PEAK IN POLLEN FORAGING OCCURRED WHEN FEMALES GLEANED REMNANT POLLEN FROM FLOWERS THAT HAD OPENED THE PREVIOUS DAY. POLLEN AVAILABILITY IN THE MORNING WAS FAR LOWER THAN IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON, AND THE TIME TAKEN TO COLLECT A FULL POLLEN LOAD IN THE MORNING WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER. COLLECTION OF POLLEN IN THE MORNING DESPITE VERY LOW RESOURCE AVAILABILITY SUGGESTS THAT POLLEN MAY BE A LIMITING RESOURCE FOR A. PAUPERATA. 6. IN CONTRAST TO MANY EXISTING EXAMPLES OF BIMODAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS IN HIGHLY ENDOTHERMIC BEES, THE BIMODAL ACTIVITY PATTERNS OF FEMALE A.

ENTOMOL.,"MOVING ACTIVELY NESTING POPULATIONS OF THE ORCHARD POLLINATOR OSMIA CORNUTA (LATREILLE) FROM A POLLINATED CROP TO ONE BEGINNING TO BLOOM COULD INCREASE BOTH THE NUMBER OF BOWERS POLLINATED AND THE NUMBER OF BEE PROGENY PRODUCED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ACTIVELY NESTING O. CORNUTA POPULATIONS, AND EVALUATES THE EFFECTS OF MOVING DISTANCE AND NEST SITE ARTIFICIAL VISUAL LANDMARKS ON ORIENTATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF MOVED FEMALES. NESTING SHELTERS WITH KNOWN NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE NOCTURNALLY RELOCATED FOR DISTANCES RANGING FROM 0 TO 240 KM, AND THE NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE COUNTED AFTER EACH MOVE. NEARLY ALL FEMALES CONTINUED TO NEST AT SHELTERS THAT WERE MOVED SHORT (0-3 M) DISTANCES. MOVES OF INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES (135-235 M) RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE (30-76\%) BEE LOSS (DISPERSAL), AND MANY FEMALES NEW BACK TO THE ORIGINAL NESTING SITE. AT LONG DISTANCES (3-240 KM), DISPERSAL WAS HIGHER (63-78\%) AND NO BEES WERE SEEN HOVERING AT THE ORIGINAL SITE. MOVING DISTANCE WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH DISPERSAL AND WITH ORIENTATION (ZIGZAGGING) NIGHTS MADE BY FEMALES WHEN THEY FIRST EXITED THEIR NESTS AFTER THE MOVES. THE ADDITION OR REMOVAL OF SUPPLEMENTARY VISUAL LANDMARKS (2 BY 1.5-M BANNER WITH COLORED PATTERNS) AT THE NESTING SHELTER DID NOT AFFECT DISPERSAL RATES. BEES APPEARED TO RESPOND TO SUPPLEMENTARY LANDMARKS BUT USED OTHER SIGNALS AS PRIMARY ORIENTATION CUES. AN ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT O.

PRATENSE ARE VISITED BY MORE THAN 100 INSECT SPECIES. FUR ALL PLANTS THE SPECTRUM OF VISITORS IS SIMILAR. HOWEVER THE ROLE OF INSECTS SPECIES IN POLLINATION IS DIFFERENT AND DEPENDS ON THE STAMEN AND STIGMA LENGTH, FLEXIBILITY OF PEDICLE AND FEEDING BEHAVIOUR OF INSECT INSIDE FLOWER, THE POSSIBILITY TO TAKE AND TO TRANSPORT POLLEN GRAINS USUALLY INCREASE WITH THE SIZE OF INSECT. THE NATURE OF THIS CORRELATION IS DETERMINED BY STAMEN AND STIGMA LENGTH. POLLINATORS OF G. PALUSTRE WITH SHORT STAMENS AND STIGMAS ARE SMALLER THAN THOSE OF CH. ANAUGUSTFOLIUM AND G. PRATENSE. ON THE ETHER HAND, MORE FLEXIBLE PEDICLES OF G. PALUSTRE PREVENT THE FLOWERS FROM VISITS OF BIG INSECTS. THREE PLANTS STUDIED BY THE AUTHORS ARE NOT EQUALLY ATTACTIVE FOR DIFFERENT INSECT GROUPS. DENSE INFLORESCENCE OF CH. ANGUSTIFOLIUM AND G. PRATENSE THAT USUALLY ARE LIFTER UNDER THE GRASS ARE VERY ATTRACTIVE FOR FORAGING SOCIAL INSECTS (HONEY BEE, BUMBLEBEE). FLIES AVOID LONG DISTANCE TRAVELLING AND PREFER SINGLE FLOWERS LOCATED NOT FAR FROM EACH OTHER. FOR INSTANCE G. PALUSTRE IS MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR FLIES NOT FOR SOCIAL BEES. IT IS POLLINATED MAINLY BY FLIES AND SOLITARY BEES WITH AVERAGE WEIGHT OF 10-70 MG. THE MAIN POLLINATORS OF CH. ANGUSTIFOLIUM AND G.

HANSEN TF;ARMBRUSTER WS;ANTONSEN L,HANSEN TF,COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT AND SPATIAL ADAPTATIONS AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE EVOLUTION OF DALECHAMPIA BLOSSOMS,AMERICAN NATURALIST,AM. NAT.,"WE DESCRIBE A PHYLOGENETIC AND SPATIAL APPROACH TO THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT AND OTHER COEVOLUTIONARY PHENOMENA. THE METHOD IS DEVELOPED AS AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF BLOSSOM MORPHOLOGY IN 37 POPULATIONS OF THE NEOTROPICAL VINE DALECHAMPIA SCANDENS. WE TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AMONG-POPULATION VARIATION IN BLOSSOM MORPHOLOGY IS DUE LARGELY TO LOCAL ADAPTATION TO AVOID COMPETITION FROM OTHER SPECIES OF DALECHAMPIA THAT UTILIZE THE SAME RESTRICTED SET OF POLLINATORS. BECAUSE DIRECT PHYLOGENETIC AND HISTORICAL INFORMATION ARE UNAVAILABLE FOR THESE POPULATIONS, WE DEVELOP A NOVEL COMPARATIVE METHOD FOR THE STUDY OF ADAPTATION TO A SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED SELECTIVE FACTOR IN SPATIALLY CORRELATED POPULATIONS. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SPATIALLY, OR PHYLOGENETICALLY, CORRECTED ESTIMATES OF SELECTIVE EFFECTS, THE METHOD ASSESSES THE LOCAL SPECIFICITY OF ADAPTATIONS. WE FIND EVIDENCE FOR MODERATELY STRONG LOCAL SPECIFICITY OF ADAPTATION AMONG OUR POPULATIONS, AND FURTHERMORE WE FIND THAT THE EFFECTS OF PUTATIVE COMPETITORS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREDICTIONS FROM A HYPOTHESIS OF CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT. HOWEVER, SYMPATRY OR ALLOPATRY EXPLAINS ONLY 10\%-20\% OF THE INTERPOPULATION VARIATION IN BLOSSOM MORPHOLOGY, AND WE THEREFORE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OTHER SELECTIVE FACTORS ARE MAJOR DETERMINANTS OF THE VARIATION.",CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT; COEVOLUTION; COMPARATIVE METHOD; DALECHAMPIA; SPATIAL ADAPTATION; GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION,EXAPTATIONS LINK EVOLUTION; MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES; WORLD LEAF WARBLERS; ANOLIS LIZARDS; PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS; ADAPTIVE RADIATION; INTERSPECIFIC DATA; POLLINATION; EUPHORBIACEAE; MORPHOLOGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,55,"HANSEN, TF (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT BOT, N-7034 TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.;NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT BOT, N-7034 TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.",10.1086/303413,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",NA,NA,NA,0003-0147,NA,S17-S34,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,156,2000,ISI000089658200003,60,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",13,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",NA,360GN,"HANSEN, TF (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT BOT, N-7034 TRONDHEIM, NORWAY",ISI,none,NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NA,"HANSEN TF, 2000, AM NAT","HANSEN TF, 2000, AM NAT",NA,NA,NA,NA

GRADIENTS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY INFECTION FROM POINT SOURCES OF ASCOSPORES AND CONIDIA PLACED IN SEPARATE PLANT ROWS WERE RECORDED IN EACH OF 2 YEARS AT TWO SITES WITH NO HISTORY OF THE DISEASE. PRIMARY INFECTION GRADIENTS WERE LONGER DOWNWIND THAN UPWIND, WITH 95\% OF BLIGHTED SHOOTS OCCURRING WITHIN 30 IN OF THE ASCOSPORE POINT SOURCE. THIS OBSERVATION, ALONG WITH A POSITIVE CORRELATION (R=0.852, P=0.0072, N=8) BETWEEN THE DISTANCE OVER WHICH SHOOT BLIGHT OCCURRED AND WIND SPEED PARALLEL TO THE ROW, SUPPORTS THE ROLE OF WIND AS A KEY FACTOR IN ASCOSPORE DISPERSAL. BY CONTRAST, SECONDARY INFECTION GRADIENTS WERE SHORTER DOWNWIND AND LONGER UPWIND, WITH 95\% OF INFECTED FRUIT OCCURRING WITHIN 20 IN OF THE CONIDIAL POINT SOURCE. THE SHORTER DOWNWIND SPREAD OF SECONDARY INFECTION, ALONG WITH A NONSIGNIFICANT CORRELATION (R=-0.649, P = 0.0812, N=8) BETWEEN THE DISTANCE OVER WHICH INFECTED FRUIT OCCURRED AND WIND SPEED, SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN WIND ARE IMPORTANT IN THE TRANSFER OF CONIDIA TO OPEN FLOWERS, THIS COULD INCLUDE CONIDIAL DISPERSAL BY BEE POLLINATORS, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN PREVIOUSLY TO FORAGE PRIMARILY UPWIND.

APIC. RES.,"A COMMUNITY STUDY OF BEES VISITING FLOWERS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS WAS MADE IN THE SUBTROPICAL ARAUCARIA FOREST REGION OF RIO GRANDE DO SUL, BRAZIL. BEES OF 79 SPECIES, REPRESENTING ABOUT 40\% OF THE TAXA OCCURRING AT THE STUDY SITE, WERE COLLECTED ON 19 SPECIES OF FLOWERING PLANTS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS OF THE FAMILIES MELASTOMATACEAE AND SOLANACEAE. THE MAJORITY OF FLOWER VISITORS WERE ABLE TO BUZZ (SONICATE) TO RELEASE POLLEN. BUZZING IS THOUGHT TO BE THE ONLY MODE OF POLLEN COLLECTION THAT RESULTS IN POLLINATION. NO OLIGOLECTIC BEE-PLANT RELATION BASED ON BUZZ POLLINATION WAS DETECTED. MOST BEES WERE NOT SPECIALIZED TO FORAGE ON PLANTS WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS. ACCORDING TO THE ABUNDANCE OF VISITORS AT SPECIFIC FLOWERS, THREE MAJOR GROUPS OF BUZZ POLLINATORS COULD BE DISTINGUISHED, THESE WERE BUMBLE BEES, STINGLESS BEES OF THE GENUS MELIPONA AND HALICTID BEES. THE POLLEN SOURCES MAINLY EXPLOITED BY THEM DIFFER IN FLOWER STRUCTURE, FLOWERING SYNDROME AND FOREST STRATUM. THEREFORE, THE STRUCTURE OF THE BEE COMMUNITY SEEMS TO BE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE COMPOSITION OF THE LOCAL VEGETATION. THE EXTENT TO WHICH BEES OF A SPECIES SHOW PREFERENCE FOR PORICIDAL FLOWERS, HOWEVER, IS MORE DEPENDENT ON HABITAT THAN ON PLANT TAXA.

MAHORO S,MAHORO S,EFFECTS OF FLOWER AND SEED PREDATORS AND POLLINATORS ON FRUIT PRODUCTION IN TWO SEQUENTIALLY FLOWERING CONGENERS,PLANT ECOLOGY,PLANT ECOL.,"ENTOMOPHILOUS SPECIES THAT BLOOM IN EARLY SPRING ARE MORE FREQUENTLY CONFRONTED WITH SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LOW FRUIT SET THAN SPECIES THAT BLOOM LATER. ON THE OTHER HAND, EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES MAY BENEFIT BY ESCAPING THE PEAK OF FLOWER AND/OR SEED PREDATOR ACTIVITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE IMPLICATED UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE INACTIVITY OF POLLINATOR AND PREDATOR INSECTS EARLY IN SPRING AS CAUSES OF SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LIGHT PREDATION IN EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES NOT ONLY IN FLOWERING SCHEDULE, BUT ALSO IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS AND BREEDING SYSTEMS, COULD INDUCE VARIATIONS IN FRUIT SET AND INTENSITY OF PREDATION AMONG SPECIES. COMPARING TWO SPECIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVING INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS WITHIN SPECIES COULD HELP DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THESE INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES. FOR FOUR YEARS, I FOLLOWED THE FATE OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS, FROM BUD TO FRUIT, IN TWO VACCINIUM SPECIES THAT BLOOM SUCCESSIVELY IN SPRING AND SHARE POLLINATORS AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS. MY PREDICTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES, V. HIRTUM, WOULD NOT EASILY GAIN POLLINATOR SERVICES BECAUSE OF LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, AND ITS FRUIT SET WOULD BE LOW IN COMPARISON WITH THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES, V. SMALLII, (2) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES WOULD AVOID ATTACKS BY FLOWER AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS VIA PHENOLOGICAL ESCAPE FROM THE PREDATORS' ACTIVITY PEAK. HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED BOTH SPECIES HAD INCOMPLETE SELF-COMPATIBILITY, WITH BUMBLEBEES REQUIRED FOR POLLINATION. AS PREDICTED, ONLY THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SEEMED TO SUFFER FROM POLLEN LIMITATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS SUGGESTED THAT POLLEN LIMITATION RESULTED NOT ONLY FROM POLLINATOR LIMITATION EARLY IN SPRING, BUT ALSO FROM GEITONOGAMY AND REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES. MOTH AND FLY LARVAE CONSUMED FLOWERS AND FRUIT, WHILE THE PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATOR WAS A WEEVIL (MECYSMODERES SP.). FAR FROM ESCAPING FLOWER AND SEED PREDATION, THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SUFFERED MORE SEVERE INSECT ATTACKS THAN THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES IN TWO YEARS OUT OF FOUR.

SELF-POLLINATION BETWEEN FLOWERS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND REDUCED POLLEN EXPORT. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF NECTAR ADDITION ON POLLINATOR VISITATION AND POLLEN TRANSFER BY TRACKING THE FATE OF COLOUR-LABELLED POLLEN IN ANACAMPTIS MONO, A NON-REWARDING ORCHID SPECIES POLLINATED PRIMARILY BY QUEEN BUMBLE-BEES. ADDITION OF NECTAR TO SPURS OF A. MORIO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PROBED BY BUMBLE-BEES, THE TIME SPENT ON AN INFLORESCENCE, POLLINARIUM REMOVAL AND THE PROPORTION OF REMOVED POLLEN INVOLVED IN SELF-POLLINATION THROUGH GEITONOGAMY, BUT DID NOT AFFECT POLLEN CARRYOVER (THE FRACTION OF A POLLINARIUM CARRIED OVER FROM ONE FLOWER TO THE NEXT). ONLY VISITS THAT EXCEEDED 18 S RESULTED IN GEITONOGAMY, AS THIS IS THE TIME TAKEN FOR REMOVED POLLINARIA TO BEND INTO A POSITION TO STRIKE THE STIGMA. A MUTATION FOR NECTAR PRODUCTION IN A.

ANTHER CONES OF VARYING DEGREES OF STRENGTH ARE A DEFINING MORPHOLOGICAL TRAIT FOR THE GENUS SOLANUM. ANTHERS ARRANGED IN A ROBUST ('PEPPER POT') CONE ARE RESTRICTED TO A SINGLE CLADE WITHIN THE GENUS, AND MAY THEREFORE BE ASSUMED TO BE MONOPHYLETIC. WE SHOW THAT IN SOME SPECIES WITHIN THIS CLADE, SUCH AS TOMATO (SOLANUM LYCOPERSICUM), THE ANTHER CONE IS HELD TOGETHER BY INTERLOCKING HAIRS (TRICHOMES) ALONG THE EDGES OF THE ANTHERS. IN OTHER SPECIES WITHIN THE CLADE, SUCH AS WOODY NIGHTSHADE (SOLANUM DULCAMARA), THE EXPANDED ANTHER SURFACES ARE CLOSELY APPRESSED TO FORM THE TIGHTLY BOUND CONE, STRENGTHENED BY EXTRACELLULAR SECRETIONS. ECTOPIC EXPRESSION OF THE MIXTA GENE FROM ANTIRRHINUM MAJUS IN S. DULCAMARA RESULTS IN THE FORMATION OF ECTOPIC TRICHOMES ON THE ANTHERS WHICH CAUSE THE CONE TO DISINTEGRATE.

BREVIS PA;NESMITH DS;SEYMOUR L;HAUSMAN DB,BREVIS PA,A NOVEL METHOD TO QUANTIFY TRANSPORT OF SELF- AND CROSS-POLLEN BY BEES IN BLUEBERRY PLANTINGS,HORTSCIENCE,HORTSCIENCE,"BLUEBERRY SPECIES (VACCINIUM SECTION CYANOCOCCUS) BENEFIT FROM CROSS-POLLINATION. OUTCROSSING INCREASES FRUIT SET, BERRY SIZE, AND RIPENING RATE. ALTHOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF POLLEN DISPERSAL IS ESSENTIAL FOR MAXIMIZING CROSS-POLLINATION AND ACHIEVING OPTIMAL PLANTING DESIGNS, THIS PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN QUANTIFIED PREVIOUSLY IN BLUEBERRY PLANTINGS. A NOVEL METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF SELF- AND CROSS-POLLEN TRANSPORTED BY BLUEBERRY POLLINATORS. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE REQUIRES A CONSISTENT DIFFERENCE IN POLLEN SIZE BETWEEN TWO CULTIVARS, TO PREDICT THE COMPOSITION OF A POLLEN MIXTURE BASED ON FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF POLLEN DIAMETER. VACCINIUM ASHEI READE `BRIGHTWELL' AND `CLIMAX' WERE CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY BECAUSE THEY PRODUCE POLLEN TETRADS OF DIFFERENT SIZE. TETRAD DIAMETER AND NUMBER WERE ANALYZED WITH A PARTICLE COUNTER. THE TECHNIQUE WAS VALIDATED BY PREDICTING THE PROPORTION OF `BRIGHTWELL' IN POLLEN MIXTURES WHERE THE CULTIVAR COMPOSITION WAS KNOWN, AND PREDICTED AND ACTUAL VALUES WERE LINEARLY CORRELATED (R=0.995, P < 0.0001). THE TECHNIQUE WAS THEN APPLIED TO POLLEN SAMPLES EXTRACTED FROM THE BODIES OF POLLINATORS THAT WERE COLLECTED IN A MIXED `BRIGHTWELL' AND `CLIMAX' BLUEBERRY PLOT. NUMBERS OF BLUEBERRY TETRADS EXTRACTED PER BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS SPP.) AVERAGED 4595 AND 797 IN 2003 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS CONSIDERED ADEQUATE TO MAKE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS BASED ON FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF TETRAD DIAMETER. THE PROPORTION OF `BRIGHTWELL' POLLEN CARRIED BY BUMBLEBEES CHANGED WITH THE PHENOLOGY OF THE CROP FOLLOWING AN EXPECTED PATTERN, INDICATING THAT THE METHOD PERFORMED WELL UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS.

NECTAR STANDING CROP WAS ABOUT 267 MU G SUGAR PER FLOWER, AND COMPARISON OF NECTAR OFFERING OF COVERED AND FREELY EXPOSED FLOWERS REVEALED THAT MAIN NECTAR SECRETION TIME IS MAINLY DURING THE NIGHT UP TO THE MORNING HOURS. IN BOTH COVERED AND FREELY EXPOSED FLOWERS NECTAR VOLUMES DECREASED OVER THE DAY.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPOSE COMPUTER-GENERATED PLANT POPULATIONS WITH A WIDE VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOR TO SELECTION BY LIVE AND VIRTUAL HUMMINGBIRDS AND BUMBLEBEES AND TRACK EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN FLOWER COLOR OVER MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. FLOWER COLOR, WHICH WAS DERIVED FROM THE KNOWN GENETIC ARCHITECTURE AND PHENOTYPIC VARIANCE OF NATURALLY OCCURRING PLANT SPECIES POLLINATED BY BOTH GROUPS, EVOLVED IN SIMULATIONS THROUGH A GENETIC ALGORITHM IN WHICH POLLINATOR PREFERENCE DETERMINED CHANGES IN FLOWER COLOR BETWEEN GENERATIONS. THE OBSERVED PREFERENCES OF LIVE HUMMINGBIRDS AND BUMBLEBEES WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE IN FLOWER COLOR BETWEEN PLANT POPULATIONS BUT DID NOT LEAD TO ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION. HOWEVER, STRONGER PREFERENCES ASSIGNED TO VIRTUAL POLLINATORS IN SYMPATRIC AND ALLOPATRIC SCENARIOS RAPIDLY PRODUCED ETHOLOGICAL ISOLATION.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS BIRD-POLLINATED (ORNIITHOPHILOUS) SALVIA SPECIES (SAGES) TRANSFER POLLEN EITHER BY MEANS OF A STAMINAL LEVER MECHANISM OR BY IMMOVABLE STAMENS. AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE TWO MODES WITHIN THE GENUS IS NOT KNOWN, WE PRESENT A SURVEY OF ALL ORNITHOPHILOUS SAGES. THE MAIN FOCUS IS GIVEN TO FLORAL DIVERSITY ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONAL LEVER MORPHOLOGY. THEREBY THE HYPOTHESIS IS TESTED THAT, DUE TO A POLLINATOR SHIFT FROM BEES TO BIRDS, THE LEVER MECHANISM BECAME UNNECESSARY. METHODS TO GET A GENERAL IDEA ABOUT THE DIVERSITY OF POLLEN TRANSFER MECHANISMS, 186 ORNITHOPHILOUS SALVIA SPECIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY OF THE STAMEN AND THE NEED FOR A LEVER MOVEMENT. TO TEST THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE STAMINAL LEVERS AND THE FITTING BETWEEN FLOWERS AND BIRDS THE PROCESS OF POLLEN TRANSFER WAS EXAMINED BY POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS AND TESTED BY INSERTING MUSEUM SKINS AND METAL RODS INTO FRESH FLOWERS. KEY RESULTS THE DIVERSITY OF POLLEN TRANSFER MECHANISMS IS REPRESENTED BY EIGHT CASE STUDIES ILLUSTRATING THREE MAIN GROUPS. IN GROUP I (APPROX. 50 \%) THE STAMINAL LEVER MECHANISM IS NECESSARY TO OPEN ACCESS TO NECTAR AND TO ENABLE THE TRANSFER OF POLLEN THAT IS HIDDEN IN THE UPPER LIP. IN GROUP II (APPROX. 34 \%) POLLEN IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE AND THE LEVER MECHANISM IS REDUCED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES. IN GROUP III (APPROX. 4 \%) THE LEVER WORKS AS IN GROUP 1, BUT POLLEN IS FREELY ACCESSIBLE AS IN II. THE REMAINING APPROX. 13 \% ARE NOT CLEARLY CLASSIFIED. CONCLUSIONS IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DIVERSE MODES OF REDUCTION IS THE NECESSITY TO INCREASE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN NECTAR AND POLLEN, THEREBY ENSURING POLLEN DEPOSITION ON THE BIRD'S FEATHERED HEAD. THIS IS ACHIEVED SEVERAL TIMES IN PARALLEL BY COROLLA ELONGATION AND/OR EXPOSURE OF THE POLLEN-SACS.

THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE OFTEN OBSERVED POSITIVE EFFECT OF ORGANIC FARMING ON ARABLE WEED AND POLLINATOR DIVERSITY RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN ARABLE WEED COMMUNITY STRUCTURE TOWARDS A HIGHER PROPORTION OF INSECT POLLINATED SPECIES IN ORGANIC CROP FIELDS. TO EXAMINE WHETHER PLANT COMMUNITY PATTERNS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THIS HYPOTHESIS, ARABLE WEED COMMUNITIES WERE COMPARED WITH RESPECT TO THE TYPE OF POLLINATION (I.E. INSECT POLLINATION VERSUS NON-INSECT POLLINATION) IN THE EDGES AND CENTRES OF 20 ORGANIC AND 20 CONVENTIONAL WHEAT FIELDS. PLANT SPECIES NUMBERS OF BOTH POLLINATION TYPES WERE MUCH HIGHER IN ORGANIC THAN IN CONVENTIONAL FIELDS AND HIGHER IN THE FIELD EDGE THAN IN THE FIELD CENTRE. A COMPARISON OF THE PROPORTIONS OF BOTH POLLINATION TYPES TO ALL PLANT SPECIES REVEALED THAT THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF INSECT POLLINATED SPECIES WAS HIGHER IN ORGANIC THAN IN CONVENTIONAL FIELDS AND HIGHER AT THE FIELD EDGE THAN IN THE FIELD CENTRE, WHEREAS THE RELATIVE NUMBER OF NON-INSECT POLLINATED SPECIES WAS HIGHER IN CONVENTIONAL FIELDS AND IN THE FIELD CENTRE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS BENEFIT DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM ORGANIC FARMING, WHICH APPEARED TO BE RELATED TO HIGHER POLLINATOR DENSITIES IN ORGANIC FIELDS, WHEREAS IN THE CENTRES OF CONVENTIONAL FIELDS NON-INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS DOMINATE PRESUMABLY DUE TO A LIMITATION OF POLLINATORS.

APPL. ECOL.,"AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION POSES A SERIOUS THREAT TO BIODIVERSITY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INCREASED LAND-USE INTENSITY, DECREASED LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND REDUCED HABITAT DIVERSITY. ALTHOUGH THERE IS INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE (GAMMA DIVERSITY), THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIFICATION HAVE BEEN ASSESSED PRIMARILY BY SPECIES RICHNESS AT A LOCAL SCALE (ALPHA DIVERSITY). THIS IGNORES SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES (BETA DIVERSITY), WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THIS STUDY, MEASURES OF LAND-USE INTENSITY, LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND HABITAT DIVERSITY WERE RELATED TO GAMMA, ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY OF WILD BEES (APOIDEA), CARABID BEETLES (CARABIDAE), HOVERFLIES (SYRPHIDAE), TRUE BUGS (HETEROPTERA) AND SPIDERS (ARANEAE) WITHIN 16 LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN 24 TEMPERATE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE TOTAL LANDSCAPE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL GROUPS WAS MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY INCREASED PROXIMITY OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. BEES ALSO DECREASED IN LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH INTENSITY OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT, DEMONSTRATING ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF BOTH FACTORS. SEPARATING TOTAL SPECIES DIVERSITY INTO COMPONENTS, THE DECREASE IN TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF ALL INVESTIGATED GROUPS DECREASED WITH INCREASING LAND-USE INTENSITY AND, IN THE CASE OF SPIDERS, DECREASING PROXIMITY OF THE SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. THE EFFECT OF INCREASED HABITAT DIVERSITY APPEARED TO BE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS BUT CAUSED A SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY TOWARDS THE LATTER. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS.

BIOL.,"IN DAUCUS CAROTA L. (APIACEAE) THE FLORETS COMPRISING THE CENTRAL UMBELLET OF INFLORESCENCES ARE USUALLY PINK OR DARK PURPLE, PRESENTING A MARKED CONTRAST TO THE SURROUNDING UMBELLETS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY WHITE. THE NUMBER OF DARK FLORETS VARIES, AND SOME INFLORESCENCES HAVE NO DARK FLORETS. IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT THE DARK FLORETS FUNCTION AS AN INSECT MIMIC, AND IN SO DOING SERVE TO ATTRACT INSECTS TO THE FLOWER. IN CONTRAST, OTHER AUTHORS, DARWIN INCLUDED, SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE FUNCTIONALLY REDUNDANT. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER THE DARK FLORETS ATTRACT INSECTS, AND ALSO WHETHER THIS EFFECT CAN BE REPLICATED BY REPLACING THESE FLORETS WITH AN INSECT. AT THE STUDY SITE IN PORTUGAL THE PREDOMINANT INSECT VISITOR WAS THE BEETLE ANTHRENUS VERBASCI L. (DERMESTIDAE), WHICH IS SIMILAR IN SIZE AND SHAPE TO THE DARK FLORETS. LARGE INFLORESCENCES AND THOSE WITH MORE DARK FLORETS ATTRACTED MORE BEETLES THAN SMALL INFLORESCENCES AND THOSE WITH FEWER OR NO DARK FLORETS. INFLORESCENCES WITH THE DARK FLORETS REMOVED ATTRACTED FEWER BEETLES VISITORS COMPARED WITH INTACT INFLORESCENCES. INFLORESCENCES IN WHICH THE DARK FLORETS WERE REPLACED WITH ONE OR A CLUSTER OF FIVE DEAD, FREEZE-KILLED A. VERBASCI ATTRACTED MORE BEETLES THAN INFLORESCENCES FROM WHICH THE DARK FLORETS HAD BEEN REMOVED. REPLACEMENT OF THE DARK FLORETS WITH A RELATIVELY LARGE MELOID BEETLE RESULTED IN THE ATTRACTION OF MARKEDLY FEWER A. VERBASCI.

HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THEIR EFFECTS ON GENE FLOW VIA POLLEN DISPERSAL BETWEEN POPULATIONS OF THESE SPECIES. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: IN A 2-YEAR EXPERIMENT, WE OBSERVED EFFECTIVE POLLEN DISPERSAL FROM SOURCE POPULATIONS OF CENTAUREA JACEA IN RESTORED MEADOWS, THE MOST WIDESPREAD SWISS AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME, TO POTTED PLANTS IN ADJACENT INTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOWS WITHOUT OTHER INDIVIDUALS OF THIS SPECIES. POTTED PLANTS WERE PUT IN REPLICATED SOURCE POPULATIONS AT 25, 50, 100 M AND WHERE POSSIBLE 200 M DISTANCE FROM THESE SOURCE POPULATIONS. POLLEN TRANSFER AMONG ISOLATED PLANTS WAS PREVENTED BY TEMPORARY BAGGING, SUCH THAT ONLY ONE ISOLATED PLANT WAS ACCESSIBLE FOR FLOWER VISITORS AT ANY ONE TIME. BECAUSE C. JACEA IS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, SEED SET IN SINGLE-PLANT ISOLATES INDICATED INSECT MEDIATED EFFECTIVE POLLEN DISPERSAL FROM THE SOURCE POPULATION. SEED SET WAS HIGHER IN SOURCE POPULATIONS (35.7 +/- 4.4) THAN IN ISOLATES (4.8 +/- 1.0). SEED SET DECLINED FROM 18.9\% OF THAT IN SOURCE POPULATIONS AT A DISTANCE OF 25 M TO 7.4\% AT 200 M. AT A DISTANCE OF 200 M SEED SET WAS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN SELFED PLANTS, INDICATING LONG-DISTANCE EFFECTIVE POLLEN DISPERSAL UP TO 200 M. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE SUGGESTED THAT BEES CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN FLIES TO THIS LONG-DISTANCE POLLEN DISPERSAL. WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT POLLEN DISPERSAL TO SINGLE-PLANT ISOLATES WAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY THE DIVERSITY AND FLOWER ABUNDANCE OF NEIGHBORING PLANT SPECIES IN THE INTENSIVELY MANAGED MEADOW. FURTHERMORE, THE DECLINE OF THE DISPERSAL WAS LESS STEEP WHEN THE SOURCE POPULATION OF C. JACEA WAS LARGE. CONCLUSIONS: WE CONCLUDE THAT INSECT POLLINATORS CAN EFFECTIVELY TRANSFER POLLEN FROM SOURCE POPULATIONS OF C. JACEA OVER AT LEAST 200 M, EVEN WHEN ``RECIPIENT POPULATIONS'' CONSISTED OF SINGLE-PLANT ISOLATES, SUGGESTING THAT GENE FLOW BY POLLEN OVER THIS DISTANCE IS VERY LIKELY. SOURCE POPULATION SIZE AND FLOWERING ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING RECIPIENT PLANTS APPEAR TO BE IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING POLLEN DISPERSAL IN C. JACEA.

YOKOI T;FUJISAKI K,YOKOI T,RECOGNITION OF SCENT MARKS IN SOLITARY BEES TO AVOID PREVIOUSLY VISITED FLOWERS,ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH,ECOL. RES.,"KNOWING HOW FLORAL VISITORS FORAGE EFFICIENTLY AMONG FLOWERS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. WHEN BEES SEARCH FOR REWARDING FLOWERS, THEY USE SEVERAL VISUAL CUES TO DETECT THE AVAILABLE FLORAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THESE CUES, BEES CAN RECOGNIZE SCENT MARKS, WHICH ARE OLFACTORY CUES LEFT ON FLOWERS FORAGED BY PREVIOUS VISITORS. THIS BEHAVIOR IS WELL KNOWN IN SOCIAL BEES, SUCH AS HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES. ALTHOUGH SOLITARY BEES DO NOT NEED TO GIVE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH FLOWERS WERE FORAGED TO CONSPECIFICS, SEVERAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE HAVE INDICATED THE USE OF SCENT MARKS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE BEHAVIOR IS WIDELY USED IN MANY DIFFERENT BEE SPECIES. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER FOUR DIFFERENT SOLITARY BEES, COLLETES PATELLATUS (COLLETIDAE), ANDRENA PROSTOMIAS (ANDRENIDAE), OSMIA ORIENTALIS (MEGACHILIDAE), AND TETRALONIA MITSUKURII (APIDAE), CAN RECOGNIZE FLOWERS THAT HAVE BEEN FORAGED PREVIOUSLY BY VISITORS WITHIN 3 MIN. ALL FOUR BEES SHOWED REJECTION RESPONSES TO FLOWERS FORAGED BY CONSPECIFICS. HOWEVER, OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT RESPONSES TO FORAGED FLOWERS VARIED AMONG BEE SPECIES. THE TENDENCY OF A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII TO REJECT THE FORAGED FLOWERS WAS PRONOUNCED, WHILE IN C. PATELLATUS AND O. ORIENTALIS IT WAS WEAK. IN BOTH A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII, THE REJECTION RATE OF FLOWERS FORAGED BY CONSPECIFICS DECREASED AS THE TIME LAG AFTER THE LAST VISIT INCREASED. BOTH BEES VISITED THE FLOWERS FROM WHICH POLLEN OR NECTAR HAD BEEN ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED. WE SUGGEST THAT A. PROSTOMIAS AND T. MITSUKURII WOULD RECOGNIZE SCENT MARKS LEFT BY PREVIOUS VISITORS, WHILE THE OTHER TWO BEES WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THEM SO STRONGLY. IT IS LIKELY THAT THE DECISION TO USE SCENT MARKS IS DEPENDENT EITHER ON THE RICHNESS OF RESOURCES OR ON THE COMPLEXITY OF FLORAL STRUCTURE.",FLORAL RESOURCES; FORAGING STRATEGIES; SCENT MARKS; SOLITARY BEES; REJECTION RESPONSES,FORAGING BUMBLEBEES; FOOD SOURCES; NECTAR; CUES; HONEYBEES; BEHAVIOR; COMMUNICATION; RESPONSES; IDENTITY; SIGNALS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,14,"YOKOI, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH AGR, LAB INSECT ECOL, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.;YOKOI, TOMOYUKI, FUJISAKI, KENJI, KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH AGR, LAB INSECT ECOL, SAKYO KU, KYOTO 6068502, JAPAN.",10.1007/S11284-008-0551-8,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE, AND TECHNOLOGY OF JAPANMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CULTURE, SPORTS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JAPAN (MEXT)","WE ARE GRATEFUL TO DAVE GOULSON, SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF STIRLING, AND PABLO J.

THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO (I) INVESTIGATE THE MATING SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS AND POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF R. DUMULOSA, (II) STUDY THE EFFECTS OF ECOLOGICAL FACTORS ON THE MATING SYSTEM AND POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF R. DUMULOSA AND (III) ASSESS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ITS POLLINATION AND MATING SYSTEM. METHODS MATING SYSTEM PARAMETERS WERE ANALYSED USING ALLOZYME MARKERS. GROWTH OF POLLEN TUBES FROM ARTIFICIAL SELF- AND CROSS-POLLINATION WAS ALSO EXAMINED. FIELD INVESTIGATIONS WERE CONDUCTED ON INSECT FLOWER VISITATION DURING THE BLOOMING PERIOD OF R. DUMULOSA. RELATIONSHIPS AMONG MATING SYSTEM, INSECT FLOWER VISITATION FREQUENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE ASSESSED. IMPORTANT FINDINGS THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT (I) R. DUMULOSA HAS A MIXED-MATING SYSTEM: IT IS SELF-COMPATIBLE AND PRIMARILY OUTBREEDING, WITH THE MULTILOCUS OUTCROSSING RATE (T(M)) RANGING FROM 0.589 +/- 0.078 (+/- STANDARD DEVIATION) TO 0.846 +/- 0.077, INBREEDING COEFFICIENTS OF MATERNAL PARENTS (F) WERE ZERO, INDICATING THAT INBREEDING DEPRESSION WAS INTENSE. (II) LIGHT INTENSITY AND TEMPERATURE IMPACTED THE VISITATION OF THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS, THE SYRPHID ERISTALIS TENAX AND THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS PYROSOMA. (III) POPULATION SIZE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE MATING SYSTEM AND POLLINATION. POPULATIONS RECEIVED MORE FREQUENT VISITS BY THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS USUALLY HAD HIGHER OUTCROSSING RATES.

REV.,"THE MEDITERRANEAN FLORA IS SPECTACULARLY RICH IN ORCHID SPECIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ORCHIDS HAVE COMPLEX AND DELICATE INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR POLLINATORS, WHICH MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION. CONSERVATION ACTIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR A RANGE OF ENDANGERED MEDITERRANEAN ORCHID SPECIES, BUT THE CURRENT TAXONOMIC CONFUSION IN SEVERAL GENERA AND THE APPARENT DISAGREEMENT AMONG ORCHID TAXONOMISTS MAKE THE SITUATION PARTICULARLY CONFUSING FROM A CONSERVATION PERSPECTIVE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DOCUMENT HOW THE DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS (NECTAR REWARD, SHELTER OFFERING, FOOD DECEPTION AND SEXUAL DECEPTION) CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS AMONG SPECIES, ON FLORAL PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AS WE PERCEIVE IT, ON POTENTIALLY RELATED PROCESSES OF SPECIES SORTING AND EXTINCTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SHOULD HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE RELATED CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS ARE POLLINATED BY SPECIALISED BEES OFTEN OCCUPYING OTHERWISE NARROW ECOLOGICAL NICHES (E.G. POLLEN SPECIALISATION, BROOD CELL PARASITES, SPECIFIC NESTING SITE). THIS CONDITION MAKES THE ORCHID-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS VERY FRAGILE AND SEVERAL ORCHID SPECIES PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND COLOUR IS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF AN OBJECT AND THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF THE ANIMAL PERCEIVING IT. COLOUR IS PRODUCED THROUGH CHEMICAL AND STRUCTURAL MEANS, BUT STRUCTURAL COLOUR HAS BEEN RELATIVELY POORLY STUDIED IN PLANTS. SCOPE THIS BOTANICAL BRIEFING DESCRIBES THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH STRUCTURES CAN PRODUCE COLOUR. IN PLANTS, AS IN ANIMALS, THE MOST COMMON MECHANISMS ARE MULTILAYERS AND DIFFRACTION GRATINGS. THE FUNCTIONS OF STRUCTURAL COLOUR ARE THEN DISCUSSED. IN ANIMALS, THESE COLOURS ACT PRIMARILY AS SIGNALS BETWEEN MEMBERS OF THE SAME SPECIES, ALTHOUGH THEY CAN ALSO PLAY ROLES IN CAMOUFLAGING ANIMALS FROM THEIR PREDATORS. IN PLANTS, MULTILAYERS ARE FOUND PREDOMINANTLY IN SHADE-PLANT LEAVES, SUGGESTING A ROLE EITHER IN PHOTOPROTECTION OR IN OPTIMIZING CAPTURE OF PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE LIGHT. DIFFRACTION GRATINGS MAY BE A SURPRISINGLY COMMON FEATURE OF PETALS, AND RECENT WORK HAS SHOWN THAT THEY CAN BE USED BY BEES AS CUES TO IDENTIFY REWARDING FLOWERS.

THERE ARE MARKED DIFFERENCES IN NECTAR PROPERTIES AMONG THE TWO GROUPS, IMPLYING THAT THERE HAS BEEN POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION ON THESE TRAITS. THIS RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT VARIATION IN BIRD ASSEMBLAGES AMONG POPULATIONS OF A PLANT SPECIES COULD LEAD TO THE EVOLUTION OF INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS. WE EXAMINED THIS HYPOTHESIS IN KNIPHOFIA LINEARIFOLIA, A COMMON AND WIDESPREAD PLANT IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. ALTHOUGH BEES ARE COMMON VISITORS TO FLOWERS OF THIS SPECIES, EXCLUSION OF BIRDS FROM INFLORESCENCES LED TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SEED SET, INDICATING THAT THE SPECIES IS PRIMARILY BIRD-POLLINATED. WE SHOWED THAT BIRD POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN FIVE DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF K. LINEARIFOLIA, AND THAT VARIATION IN FLOWER MORPHOLOGY AND NECTAR PROPERTIES BETWEEN THESE POPULATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOMINANT GUILD OF BIRD VISITORS AT EACH POPULATION. WE IDENTIFIED TWO DISTINCT MORPHOTYPES, BASED ON COROLLA LENGTH, NECTAR VOLUME AND NECTAR CONCENTRATION, WHICH REFLECT THE BIRD ASSEMBLAGES FOUND IN EACH TYPE.

WE REVIEWED THE AVAILABLE PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED DATA TO ASSESS THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF PREDATORS ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR AND TO EXAMINE SOURCES OF VARIATION IN THESE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF OUR META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT PREDATION RISK SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FLOWER VISITATION RATES (BY 36\%) AND TIME SPENT ON FLOWERS (BY 51\%) BY POLLINATORS. THE STRENGTH OF THE PREDATOR EFFECTS DEPENDED NEITHER ON PREDATOR TAXA AND FORAGING MODE (SIT-AND-WAIT OR ACTIVE HUNTERS) NOR ON POLLINATOR LIFESTYLE (SOCIAL VS. SOLITARY). HOWEVER, PREDATOR EFFECTS DIFFERED AMONG POLLINATOR TAXA: PREDATOR PRESENCE REDUCED FLOWER VISITATION RATES AND TIME SPENT ON FLOWERS BY SQUAMATA, LEPIDOPTERA AND HYMENOPTERA, BUT NOT BY DIPTERA. FURTHERMORE, LARGER POLLINATORS SHOWED WEAKER RESPONSES TO PREDATION RISK, PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE. PRESENCE OF LIVE CRAB SPIDERS ON FLOWERS HAD WEAKER EFFECTS ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR THAN PRESENCE OF DEAD OR ARTIFICIAL CRAB SPIDERS OR OTHER OBJECTS (E.G.

POWER EF;STOUT JC,POWER EF,ORGANIC DAIRY FARMING: IMPACTS ON INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORKS AND POLLINATION,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,J. APPL. ECOL.,"P>1. POLLINATION INTERACTIONS COMPRISE A NETWORK OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FLOWERS AND INSECT VISITORS. THEY ARE CRUCIAL FOR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN MANY ANGIOSPERMS BUT ARE THREATENED BY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. ALTHOUGH LESS INTENSIVE APPROACHES, INCLUDING ORGANIC FARMING, COULD IMPROVE FARMLAND BIODIVERSITY, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THESE APPROACHES ENHANCE WILD PLANT POLLINATION AND THE STABILITY OF INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORKS. 2. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF ORGANIC VS. CONVENTIONAL FARMING ON INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORK SIZE AND STRUCTURE, BEE AND HOVERFLY DIVERSITY, AND POLLINATION IN 10 PAIRS OF ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL DAIRY FARMS IN THE REPUBLIC OF IRELAND. 3. WE FOUND THAT INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORKS ON ORGANIC FARMS WERE LARGER AND MORE ASYMMETRICALLY STRUCTURED THAN NETWORKS ON CONVENTIONAL FARMS. OVERALL, HOWEVER, NETWORKS CONTAINED FEWER TAXA AND NICHE OVERLAP AND PLANT/ANIMAL RATIOS WERE RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED WITH PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORKS. ORGANIC FARMS DID ATTRACT HIGHER NUMBERS OF BEES PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIGHER FLORAL ABUNDANCES (MAINLY TRIFOLIUM SP.). HOVERFLY EVENNESS WAS GREATER IN ORGANIC FARMS BUT NEITHER ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS NOR EVENNESS WAS RELATED TO FLORAL ABUNDANCE, SUGGESTING ORGANIC FARMS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR HOVERFLIES. POLLINATION OF CRATAEGUS MONOGYNA HAWTHORN WAS HIGHER ON ORGANIC FARMS, ALTHOUGH POLLEN DEPOSITION WAS LIMITED. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. ORGANIC DAIRY FARMING CAN INCREASE THE SIZE AND ALTER THE STRUCTURE OF INSECT-FLOWER INTERACTION NETWORKS. HOWEVER, NETWORK STABILITY WAS NOT IMPROVED AND ALL NETWORKS (ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL) WERE VULNERABLE BECAUSE OF THEIR SMALL SIZE, LOW NICHE OVERLAP AND LOW PLANT/ANIMAL RATIOS. NONETHELESS, ORGANIC FARMING PROVIDED MORE FLOWERS THAT ATTRACTED MORE FLOWER VISITORS AND IMPROVED POLLINATION OF C. MONOGYNA. WE SUGGEST THAT STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT OF IMPORTANT FLOWERS FOR POLLINATORS IN HEDGEROWS AND PASTURES SHOULD BE ENDORSED IN AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES. SOWING TRIFOLIUM SPP., AND ALLOWING THESE PLANTS TO FLOWER, COULD BENEFIT BEES, BUT MORE RESEARCH INTO HOVERFLY ECOLOGY IS NECESSARY BEFORE REALISTIC CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE FOR THIS GROUP.

ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CONSERVATION STRATEGIES FOR BUMBLEBEES ADDRESS FORAGE AVAILABILITY, OTHER ASPECTS OF BUMBLEBEE ECOLOGY ARE OFTEN IGNORED. AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT NEST SITES IS A KEY REQUIREMENT OF BUMBLEBEE POPULATIONS AND SINCE NESTING HABITAT IS LIKELY TO HAVE BECOME REDUCED ON INTENSIVELY FARMED LAND, LOWER NEST SITE AVAILABILITY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO BUMBLEBEE DECLINES. THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL DOMICILES FOR BUMBLEBEES HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL TOOL FOR CONSERVATION AND FOR IMPROVING POLLINATION SERVICES FOR CROPS, PROVIDING A METHOD OF BOOSTING NEST SITE AVAILABILITY WHERE IT IS OTHERWISE LIMITING. HERE, SIX DIFFERENT ARTIFICIAL DOMICILES FOR BUMBLEBEES ARE TRIALLED IN DIFFERENT HABITATS IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND AND CENTRAL SCOTLAND. OF THESE, ONLY ONE DOMICILE DESIGN AT ONE PARTICULAR SITE ACHIEVED REASONABLE UPTAKE RATES, WHILST ALL OTHER COMBINATIONS OF DOMICILE AND SITE ACHIEVED LOW SUCCESS. OVERALL, ONLY 23 OF 736 DOMICILES DEPLOYED WERE OCCUPIED BY BUMBLEBEES (3.1\%). BASED ON CURRENT KNOWLEDGE, ATTEMPTS TO USE DOMICILES FOR CONSERVATION OR RESEARCH IN THE UK ARE LIKELY TO BE INEFFECTIVE.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"MOST PLANT SPECIES ARE VISITED BY A DIVERSE ARRAY OF VISITORS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE DIFFERENTLY TO REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. IN PARTICULAR, THE SIZE OF VISITORS, RELATIVE TO FLOWER SIZE, MAY HAVE SEVERE IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANT FITNESS, AS IT CAN AFFECT THE MECHANICS OF THE POLLINATION PROCESS. ONONIS MASQUILLIERII, A RARE ENDEMIC LEGUME IN NORTHERN ITALY, IS VISITED BY NUMEROUS BEE SPECIES OF DIFFERENT FAMILIES AND SIZES. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF BEE GUILDS ON SEED SET, WE COMPARED THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF FOUR SIZE CLASSES OF BEES VISITING FLOWERS IN EIGHT PLANT POPULATIONS OCCURRING IN THE APENNINES. SIZE CLASSES WERE ASSORTED BY BODY WEIGHT. REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO PLANT POPULATION SIZE AND AFFECTED BY THE VISITATION FREQUENCY OF THE BEE SIZE GUILDS: HIGHER VISITATION RATES BY LARGER BEES (MEDIUM-LARGE ANDRENIDAE AND LARGE APIDAE) INCREASED SEED SET, WHEREAS HIGH VISITATION RATES BY SMALLER BEES (SMALL HALICTIDAE AND SMALL-MEDIUM MEGACHILIDAE) REDUCED SEED SET. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE INFLUENCE OF BEE SIZE ON SEED SET IS RELATED TO THE POLLEN FORAGING TECHNIQUES OF THE DIFFERENT BEE GUILDS. LARGER BEES PAYING SHORT VISITS TO FLOWERS REMOVE ONE `BATCH' OF POLLEN AND TRANSFER IT TO ANOTHER FLOWER. IN CONTRAST, SMALLER BEES ENTER THE FLOWER ENTIRELY AND ACTIVATE THE PUMP-LIKE POLLEN DISPENSING MECHANISM SEVERAL TIMES, RESULTING IN A HIGHER DEGREE OF SELFING. THESE BEHAVIOURS MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENTIAL SEED SETS AS THE FLOWERS ARE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, I.E. SEED SET MAY BE REDUCED AFTER VISITATION BY SMALLER BEES. SUCH VARIATIONS IN POLLINATOR QUALITY AMONG POPULATIONS COUPLED WITH THE EPHEMERAL NATURE OF THE HABITAT OF O. MASQUILLIERII MAY REPRESENT A RISK FOR ITS PERSISTENCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT SUCH A RISK CAN BE CONFRONTED ONLY THROUGH THE CONSERVATION OF LARGE PLANT POPULATIONS AND OF LARGE BEES CAPABLE OF FLYING LONG-DISTANCES.

ALL THE STUDY SITES WERE LOCATED IN AREAS AFFECTED BY ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE (RECLAIMED BROWN-COAL MINING AREAS, AND RAILWAY DYKES) IN CENTRAL EUROPE.

ECOL.,"IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT OF GLOBAL HABITAT LOSS, A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE IS TO UNDERSTAND HOW ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES INTERACT TO DETERMINE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. DESPITE THE ACCUMULATING EVIDENCE BASE FOR GLOBAL DECLINES IN BEE POPULATIONS, FEW STUDIES HAVE ADDRESSED THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND LARGE-SCALE SPATIAL FACTORS IN MAINTAINING DIVERSE BEE COMMUNITIES OUTSIDE OF AGRICULTURAL HABITATS, AND PARTICULARLY IN AREAS PROTECTED FOR NATURE CONSERVATION. WE ANALYSED BEE COMMUNITY DATA THAT WE COLLECTED FROM 40 SPECIAL AREAS OF CONSERVATION REPRESENTING FIVE DISTINCT EUROPEAN NATURA 2000 PRIORITY HABITATS IN IRELAND, QUANTIFYING LOCAL HABITAT FEATURES WITHIN EACH SITE AND SURROUNDING LAND-USE. SPECIES DATA WERE COLLECTED IN A NESTED SAMPLING DESIGN COMPOSED OF THREE HIERARCHICAL LEVELS SUCH AS SITE, HABITAT AND REGION AND ANALYSED USING DIVERSITY PARTITIONING. THE SPECIESENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIP WAS ALSO DECOMPOSED INTO REGIONAL-, LANDSCAPE- AND LOCAL-SCALES BY VARIANCE PARTITIONING USING PARTIAL CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS. WILD BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON HABITAT TYPE, BUT THE MAJORITY OF REGIONAL DIVERSITY WAS CONTAINED WITHIN SITES, AS OPPOSED TO SPECIES TURNOVER ACROSS SITES AND REGIONS. BEE COMMUNITIES WERE PRIMARILY STRUCTURED BY LOCAL-SCALE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH NESTING RESOURCES AND GRAZING REGIME, WITH NON-BOMBUS TAXA BEING MORE SENSITIVE TO LANDSCAPE-SCALE DIFFERENCES IN ADJACENT HABITATS THAN BOMBUS TAXA. REGIONAL-SCALE PROCESSES, SUCH AS SPECIES SORTING ALONG LONGITUDINAL GRADIENTS, WERE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE IN STRUCTURING BEE COMMUNITIES IN THIS SYSTEM. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. WITHIN HABITATS, LOCAL SPECIES RICHNESS, RATHER THAN SPECIES TURNOVER AT HIGHER SPATIAL SCALES, ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF REGIONAL BEE DIVERSITY. LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE POWERFUL DETERMINANTS OF COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT EFFORT PRIORITISING THE MAINTENANCE OF A DIVERSITY OF HIGH-QUALITY HABITATS WITHIN A BROAD NETWORK OF PROTECTED AREAS BEST FACILITATES BEE CONSERVATION IN THIS SYSTEM.

IT IS, HOWEVER, UNCLEAR HOW THE URBAN MATRIX INFLUENCES PLANT-POLLINATOR PROCESSES. WE RECORDED PLANT DIVERSITY, FLORAL ABUNDANCE, FLOWER VISITOR DIVERSITY AND PLOT VISITS AT 89 PLANT PATCHES WITHIN THE CITY OF ZURICH. THE URBAN MATRIX SURROUNDING EACH SITE WAS ANALYZED FOR THE LANDSCAPE METRICS EDGE DENSITY AND THE EXTENT OF GREEN AREA UP TO 200 M RADIUS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN EDGE DENSITY AND BEE DIVERSITY AND VISITATION FREQUENCY VARIED OVER THE ENTIRE SPATIAL RANGE, WHILE THE CORRELATION FOR SYRPHID DIVERSITY AND VISITATION FREQUENCY LEVELLED OFF AT 80 M RADIUS. IN CONTRAST, THE CORRELATIONS WITH GREEN AREA WERE MORE CONSISTENT, WITH BEE DIVERSITY LEVELLING OFF AFTER 100 M, WHILE SYRPHID DIVERSITY AND VISITS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. THE VARIATION IN THE CORRELATION OF BEE VISITS WAS PARTLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE LARGE CONTRIBUTION OF HONEYBEES. PLANT DIVERSITY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BEE DIVERSITY AND VISITS, AND SYRPHID VISITS. FLORAL ABUNDANCE HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BEE VISITS AND BEE DIVERSITY. SYRPHID DIVERSITY HAD A NEGATIVE INTERACTION WITH FLORAL ABUNDANCE AND GREEN AREA. THE EXTENT OF GREEN AREA INCREASED BEE DIVERSITY AND VISITS, AND SYRPHID VISITS, WHILE EDGE DENSITY REDUCED VISITATION BY BEES.

FROM THIS ANCESTRAL STATE, DIM-LIGHT FORAGING IN BEES REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ADAPTATIONS TO A NEW PHOTIC ENVIRONMENT. WE USED DNA SEQUENCES TO EVALUATE THE PHYLOGENETIC HISTORY OF THE MOST DIVERSE CLADE OF APOIDEA THAT IS ADAPTED TO DIM-LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS (AUGOCHLORINI: MEGALOPTA, MEGALOPTIDIA AND MEGOMMATION). THE MOST SPECIOSE LINEAGE, MEGALOPTA, IS DISTAL TO THE REMAINING DIM-LIGHT GENERA, AND ITS CLOSEST DIURNAL RELATIVE (XENOCHLORA) IS RECOVERED AS A LINEAGE THAT HAS SECONDARILY REVERTED TO DIURNAL FORAGING. TESTS FOR ADAPTIVE PROTEIN EVOLUTION INDICATE THAT LONG-WAVELENGTH OPSIN SHOWS STRONG EVIDENCE OF STABILIZING SELECTION, WITH NO MORE THAN FIVE CODONS (2\%) UNDER POSITIVE SELECTION, DEPENDING ON ANALYTICAL PROCEDURE. IN THE BRANCH LEADING TO MEGALOPTA, THE AMINO ACID OF THE SINGLE POSITIVELY SELECTED CODON IS CONSERVED AMONG ANCESTRAL HALICTIDAE EXAMINED, AND IS HOMOLOGOUS TO CODONS KNOWN TO INFLUENCE MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AT THE CHROMOPHORE-BINDING POCKET.

ECOL.,"THE EVOLUTION OF SEVERAL FLORAL TRAITS IS THOUGHT TO BE DRIVEN BY MULTIPLE SELECTIVE AGENTS, INCLUDING POLLINATORS AND HERBIVORES. SIMILAR COMBINATIONS OF SELECTION PRESSURES MAY HAVE SHAPED EXTRA-FLORAL TRAITS. THE CONSPICUOUS PURPLE TUFTS OF LEAVES (FLAGS), WHICH OFTEN TERMINATE VERTICAL INFLORESCENCES IN THE MEDITERRANEAN ANNUAL SALVIA VIRIDIS, WERE SHOWN TO ATTRACT INSECT POLLINATORS TO THE FLOWERING PATCH. HERE WE TEST WHETHER THEY ALSO FUNCTION AS ANTI-HERBIVORE SIGNALS. WE DETERMINED THE APOSEMATIC POTENTIAL OF S. VIRIDIS FLAGS ON THREE LEVELS: CONCENTRATIONS OF ANTHOCYANINS, SUGGESTED TO FUNCTION AS APOSEMATIC VISUAL SIGNALS, IN LEAVES AND FLAGS, SPECTROMETRY TO ESTIMATE WHETHER THE COLOR-VISION SYSTEM OF TWO COMMON MEDITERRANEAN GENERALIST HERBIVORES (LOCUSTS AND GOATS) CAN DISCRIMINATE FLAGS FROM LEAVES, AND CHOICE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE FOOD PREFERENCES OF THE SAME HERBIVORES. ANTHOCYANIN CONCENTRATIONS IN FLAGS WERE > 10-FOLD HIGHER THAN IN LEAVES. FLAGS EXHIBITED PEAK REFLECTANCE AT 450 AND 700 NM WAVELENGTHS, WHILE LEAVES REFLECTED MAXIMALLY AT 550 NM. ACCORDING TO THE VOROBYEV-OSORIO COLOR VISION MODEL, THESE DIFFERENCES IN COLOR REFLECTION ARE LIKELY TO ALLOW VISUAL DISCRIMINATION BY HERBIVORES. GOATS PREFERRED FEEDING ON CLIPPED INFLORESCENCES OVER CONTROL INFLORESCENCES. LOCUSTS PREFERRED LEAVES OVER FLAGS. TO TEST WHETHER THIS WAS DUE TO DETERRENCE FROM THE FLAGS' COLORATION, WE ALSO OFFERED THEM CHOICE BETWEEN LEAVES AND A RARE, WHITE MORPH, OF THE FLAGS. THE LOCUSTS CHOSE BOTH EQUALLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER PRESENTATION, BUT LEAVES ATTRACTED MORE INDIVIDUALS AFTER 5 MIN OF FEEDING.

ALCORN K;WHITNEY H;GLOVER B,ALCORN K,FLOWER MOVEMENT INCREASES POLLINATOR PREFERENCE FOR FLOWERS WITH BETTER GRIP,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"1.CONICAL CELLS IN THE PETAL EPIDERMIS ARE COMMON ACROSS MANY DIVERSE FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES, AND IT WAS RECENTLY SHOWN THAT IN DIFFICULT-TO-HANDLE FLOWERS, POLLINATORS PREFER CONICAL CELLS BECAUSE THEY INCREASE GRIP. HOWEVER, THIS DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE PREVALENCE OF CONICAL CELLS AMONGST OTHER, SIMPLER, FLOWERS. 2.THE MOVEMENT OF OBJECTS IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE WORLD AND IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO BEES BECAUSE THE RELATIVE MOTION OF OBJECTS IS ESSENTIAL TO A BEE'S 3D VISION. THE MOTION OF FLOWERS CAN INCREASE POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, HOWEVER, IT ALSO MAKES FLOWERS MORE DIFFICULT FOR A BEE TO HANDLE. THIS MAKES FORAGING MORE METABOLICALLY EXPENSIVE. TO EXPLORE WHETHER CONICAL PETAL CELLS MAKE HANDLING MOVING FLOWERS EASIER, WE TESTED BUMBLEBEE (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) PREFERENCE FOR CONICAL- OR FLAT-CELLED PETUNIA (PETUNIA HYBRIDA) FLOWERS UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF MOTION. WE ALSO USED DIFFERENTLY COLOURED PETUNIA FLOWERS TO TEST HOW COLOUR AND VISIBILITY INTERACT WITH TACTILE CUES TO FORM A POLLINATOR'S PREFERENCES. 3.BEES PREFERRED TO VISIT CONICAL-CELLED PETUNIA FLOWERS EXCEPT WHEN THE CONICAL-CELLED FLOWERS WERE HARDER TO DETECT VISUALLY. THE BEES THEN FAVOURED FLOWERS THAT WERE EASIER TO DETECT. BUT WHEN FLOWERS WERE MOVING AND MORE DIFFICULT TO HANDLE, BEES ALWAYS LEARNED TO FAVOUR CONICAL-CELLED FLOWERS, IRRESPECTIVE OF VISUAL DIFFICULTY. 4.BY PROVIDING EASIER HANDLING THROUGH BETTER GRIP FROM CONICAL CELLS, THE PLANT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE NATURAL VISUAL ATTRACTANT OF FLOWERS MOVING IN THE WIND WITHOUT LOSING POLLINATOR PREFERENCE FOR EASIER-TO-HANDLE FLOWERS. BEE PREFERENCE FOR CONICAL-CELLED FLOWERS WHEN FLOWERS ARE MOVING SHOWS HOW PLANTS CAN USE CONICAL PETAL CELLS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AN ATTRACTANT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DECREASE POLLINATOR PREFERENCE BY MAKING HANDLING DIFFICULT (MOVEMENT). THE SELECTIVE PRESSURE FROM POLLINATORS CHOOSING CONICAL-CELLED FLOWERS WHEN FLOWERS ARE MOVING IN THE WIND PROVIDES AN EXPLANATION FOR THE PERSISTENCE OF CONICAL CELLS IN SO MANY DIVERSE ANGIOSPERM SPECIES ACROSS EVOLUTIONARY TIME.",BOMBUS; CONICAL PETAL CELLS; FLOWER COLOUR; FLOWER MOVEMENT; PETUNIA; POLLINATOR GRIP,PETAL CELL-SHAPE; ANTIRRHINUM-MAJUS; COLOR; DISCRIMINATION; PIGMENTATION; BUMBLEBEES; HONEYBEE; ULTRAVIOLET; PERCEPTION; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,20,"GLOVER, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT PLANT SCI, DOWNING ST, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA, ENGLAND.;ALCORN, KATRINA, GLOVER, BEVERLEY, UNIV CAMBRIDGE, DEPT PLANT SCI, CAMBRIDGE CB2 3EA, ENGLAND.;WHITNEY, HEATHER, UNIV BRISTOL, SCH BIOL SCI, BRISTOL BS8 1UG, AVON, ENGLAND.",10.1111/J.1365-2435.2012.02009.X,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,CAMBRIDGE OVERSEAS TRUST; CAMBRIDGE COMMONWEALTH TRUST,"WE THANK MATTHEW DORLING FOR EXCELLENT CARE OF PLANTS, PROFESSOR CATHIE MARTIN FOR SUPPLYING PETUNIA SEED, AND PROFESSOR LARS CHITTKA FOR THE USE OF THE SPECTROPHOTOMETER AND FOR HELPFUL DISCUSSIONS.

A HIGH BIODIVERSITY OF INSECT VISITORS WAS DISCOVERED, 20 INSECT TAXA IN ALL, INCLUDING 13 SPECIES OF HYMENOPTERA, 3 SPECIES OF COLEOPTERA, 3 SPECIES OF LEPIDOPTERA AND 1 SPECIES OF DIPTERA. THREE NATIVE BEE SPECIES, ANDRENA SQUAMATA, ANTHOPHORA MELANOGNATHA AND MEGACHILE ABLUTA, WERE VALIDATED AS THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS. THEY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN TRIPPING MODE AND THEIR DIURNAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE NATIVE WILD BEES ARE DIVERSE AND THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER.

ECOL.,"TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE DRIVERS OF POLLINATOR LOSS, A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LAND-USE CHANGE INCLUDING HABITAT SIZE, ISOLATION, HABITAT QUALITY AND THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE MATRIX IS NECESSARY. MOREOVER, SPECIES' RESPONSES TO LAND-USE CHANGE MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR LIFE HISTORY TRAITS SUCH AS DISPERSAL ABILITY, TROPHIC LEVEL, OR SOCIALITY. WE ASSESSED SPECIES RICHNESS AND LIFE HISTORY TRAITS OF WILD BEES IN 32 CALCAREOUS GRASSLANDS IN CENTRAL GERMANY THAT DIFFER IN SIZE, CONNECTIVITY, RESOURCE AVAILABILITY AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. DECLINING HABITAT AREA AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, REDUCED DIVERSITY OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE WERE THE KEY FACTORS NEGATIVELY INFLUENCING SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THE COMMUNITY-WIDE ANALYSIS, SMALL BODY SIZE AND SOLITARY REPRODUCTION WERE TRAITS THAT MADE SPECIES PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO HABITAT LOSS. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, CLEPTOPARASITIC SPECIES WERE NOT MORE AFFECTED BY REDUCED HABITAT AREA AND LANDSCAPE DIVERSITY THAN NEST-BUILDING SPECIES. WE PERFORMED FURTHER DETAILED TRAIT ANALYSES WITHIN THE FAMILY HALICTIDAE TO PREVENT POSSIBLE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS DUE TO TRAIT CORRELATIONS ACROSS FAMILIES. HERE, SOCIAL AS OPPOSED TO SOLITARY SPECIES WERE MORE AFFECTED BY HABITAT LOSS. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE OPPOSITE PATTERN OBSERVED FOR ALL SOCIAL BEES WAS MAINLY CAUSED BY LARGE-SIZED SOCIAL BUMBLEBEE SPECIES WITH HIGH MOBILITY AND LARGE FORAGING DISTANCES.

BEHAV.,"BEES FORAGING FOR NECTAR OFTEN HAVE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN FLOWERS WITH SIMILAR APPEARANCE BUT DIFFERENT NECTAR REWARDS. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY MUST BE VIGILANT FOR AMBUSH PREDATORS, SUCH AS CRAB SPIDERS, WHICH CAN CAMOUFLAGE THEMSELVES ON FLOWERS. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER BEES, BOMBUS TERRESTRIS, CAN EFFICIENTLY DISCRIMINATE SIMILAR FLOWER COLOURS WHILE EXPOSED TO PREDATION THREAT FROM CRYPTIC PREDATORS. BEES WERE INDIVIDUALLY TESTED IN TIGHTLY CONTROLLED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS USING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WHOSE NECTAR SUPPLY WAS ADMINISTERED WITH PRECISION PUMPS. PREDATION RISK WAS SIMULATED BY AUTOMATED CRAB SPIDER `ROBOTS' THAT CAPTURED BEES FOR A LIMITED DURATION WITHOUT INJURING THEM. BEES' BEHAVIOUR WAS MONITORED BY A 3D VIDEO TRACKING SYSTEM. WE EXPERIMENTED WITH BOTH CRYPTIC AND CONSPICUOUS SPIDERS, FINDING THAT BEES HAD NO DIFFICULTY AVOIDING CONSPICUOUS SPIDERS WHILE STILL FORAGING ADAPTIVELY. CONVERSELY, THEY PRIORITIZED PREDATOR AVOIDANCE AT THE EXPENSE OF MAXIMIZING ENERGY INTAKE WHEN FACED WITH DETECTING CRYPTIC PREDATORS AND A DIFFICULT COLOUR DISCRIMINATION TASK. THIS DIFFERENCE IN BEHAVIOUR WAS NOT DUE TO COGNITIVE LIMITATIONS: BEES WERE ABLE TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN SIMILAR FLOWER TYPES UNDER PREDATION RISK FROM CRYPTIC SPIDERS WHEN CHOOSING THE SAFE FLOWER TYPE INCURRED A GUSTATORY PUNISHMENT IN THE FORM OF BITTER QUININE SOLUTION. HOWEVER, THIS RESULTED IN BEES INCURRING SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER COSTS IN TERMS OF FLORAL INSPECTION TIMES. WE CONCLUDE THAT BEES HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ATTEND TO DIFFICULT FORAGING TASKS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY AVOIDING CRYPTIC PREDATORS, BUT ONLY DO SO WHEN AVOIDANCE OF GUSTATORY PUNISHMENT JUSTIFIES THE INCREASED COSTS.

EVOL.,"PEDICULARIS REX, A SELF-COMPATIBLE ALPINE HERB, DEPENDS EXCLUSIVELY ON POLLINATORS FOR REPRODUCTION. PREVIOUS STUDY HAS REVEALED THAT 74.7 \% OF GENETIC VARIABILITY OCCURS AMONG POPULATIONS IN YUNNAN, INDICATING A MIXED MATING SYSTEM FOR THE SPECIES. THE LARGE FLORAL DISPLAY ALSO INDICATES HIGH POTENTIAL GEITONOGAMY. THEREFORE, PLANT DENSITY AND DISPLAY SIZE MAY BE IMPORTANT FACTORS INFLUENCING THE REALIZED MATING SYSTEM OF P. REX. IN THE STUDY REPORTED HERE WE EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF PLANT DENSITY AND FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE ON POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS AND THUS OUTCROSSING RATE IN TWO PATCHES OF IN P. REX AT LOW AND HIGH PLANT DENSITIES. WE EXAMINED FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF BUMBLEBEES, MEASURED REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUTS UNDER HAND AND NATURAL POLLINATION, AND ESTIMATED THE OUTCROSSING RATES USING RAPD MARKERS. FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER AND BUMBLEBEES VISITED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FLOWERS IN SEQUENCE ON INDIVIDUAL PLANTS IN THE SPARSE PATCH THAN IN THE DENSE PATCH. WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AND SUCCESSIVE VISITS IN THE SPARSE PATCH, BUT NOT IN THE DENSE PATCH. REGRESSION ANALYSIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INVERSE CORRELATION BETWEEN FRUIT PRODUCTION AND FLOWER PRODUCTION PER PLANT WITH A THEORETICAL MAXIMUM OF 63 FRUITS PER PLANT, BUT NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEED PRODUCTION AND FLOWER PRODUCTION PER PLANT. CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ON GENETIC STRUCTURE, HOWEVER, WE FOUND AN UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH OUTCROSSING RATE IN BOTH THE SPARSE AND THE DENSE PATCH (T (M) = 1.151 AND 0.924, RESPECTIVELY).

ECOL.,"THEORY HAS PRODUCED CONTRASTING PREDICTIONS RELATED TO FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP AMONG COEXISTING PLANT SPECIES LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF POTENTIAL INFLUENCES ON FLOWERING TIME. IN THIS STUDY, WE USE A TRAIT-BASED NULL MODELLING APPROACH TO TEST FOR EVIDENCE OF DETERMINISTIC ASSEMBLY OF SPECIES ACCORDING TO FLOWERING TIME IN AN OLD-FIELD PLANT COMMUNITY. PLANT SPECIES COEXISTING IN ONE-METRE-SQUARE PLOTS OVERLAPPED IN FLOWERING TIME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN EXPECTED. THIS FLOWERING SYNCHRONY WAS MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN ANALYSES FOCUSED ON BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES. FLOWERING SYNCHRONY WAS ALSO OBSERVED FOR WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES, ALTHOUGH FOR ONLY ONE OF OUR TWO NULL MODEL TESTS, HIGHLIGHTING THE SENSITIVITY OF SOME RESULTS TO DIFFERENT RANDOMIZATION METHODS. IN GENERAL, THESE PATTERNS SUGGEST THAT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN POLLINATORS AND PLANTS CAN INFLUENCE COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY PROCESSES. BECAUSE OUR STUDY COMMUNITY IS COMPOSED OF APPROXIMATELY 43\% NATIVE PLANT SPECIES AND 57\% EXOTIC SPECIES, AND BECAUSE THE ARRIVAL OF NEW SPECIES MAY COMPLICATE PLANTPOLLINATOR INTERACTIONS, WE TESTED WHETHER FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP WAS ALTERED BY INTRODUCED SPECIES. FLOWERING SYNCHRONY WAS GREATER IN PLOTS WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF INTRODUCED SPECIES. THIS PATTERN HELD FOR BOTH NULL MODEL TESTS, BUT WAS SLIGHTLY STRONGER WHEN ANALYSES FOCUSED ON BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTRODUCED SPECIES ALTER COMMUNITY FLOWERING DISTRIBUTIONS AND IN SO DOING WILL INEVITABLY AFFECT POLLINATORPLANT INTERACTIONS. FINALLY, WE TESTED WHETHER OUR RESULTS WERE INFLUENCED BY VARIATION AMONG STUDY PLOTS IN ABOVE-GROUND BIOMASS PRODUCTION, WHICH SOME THEORY PREDICTS WILL BE RELATED TO THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPETITION. OUR RESULTS WERE NOT INFLUENCED BY THIS VARIATION, SUGGESTING THAT RESOURCE VARIATION AMONG OUR PLOTS DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OBSERVED PATTERNS. SYNTHESIS: OUR RESULTS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PREDICTIONS THAT COEXISTING SPECIES SHOULD DISPLAY FLOWERING SYNCHRONY, AND PROVIDE NO SUPPORT FOR SPECIES COEXISTENCE VIA TEMPORAL NICHE PARTITIONING AT THIS SCALE IN THIS STUDY COMMUNITY.

HERE, WE ADDRESS EFFECTS OF PLANT RESPONSES TO EGGS AND SUBSEQUENT HERBIVORY BY CATERPILLARS ON PLANT-MEDIATED INTERACTIONS WITH POLLINATORS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANT FITNESS. USING A COMMON GARDEN SET-UP, WE HAVE INVESTIGATED RESPONSES OF BRASSICA NIGRA PLANTS TO HERBIVORE EXPOSURE FROM EGG DEPOSITION ONWARDS THROUGHOUT LARVAL DEVELOPMENT.

EGG DEPOSITION AND FOLIVORY DID NOT INFLUENCE VISITATION BY POLLINATORS TO PLOTS OF INFESTED OR CONTROL PLANTS. EFFECTS OF HERBIVORE INFESTATION ON BOTH POLLINATOR VISITATION AND VOLATILE EMISSION WERE OBSERVED ONLY AT A LATER STAGE, WHEN CATERPILLARS WERE FEEDING ON THE FLOWERS. REMARKABLY, BEFORE EGGS HAD HATCHED, INFESTED PLANTS ACCELERATED SEED PRODUCTION. THE CATERPILLARS THAT DEVELOPED FROM THE EGGS FED ON FLOWERS BUT NOT ON SEEDS AND THUS SEED PRODUCTION PRIOR TO HERBIVORY ON FLOWERS SAFEGUARDED REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT.

SEPARATE EFFECTS OF THESE TWO DRIVERS ON PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY STUDIED, BUT WE STILL LACK AN UNDERSTANDING OF COMBINED AND POTENTIAL INTERACTIVE EFFECTS. IN A SUBTROPICAL SOUTH AFRICAN LANDSCAPE, WE STUDIED 17 PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS ALONG TWO GRADIENTS OF RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF EXOTICS AND LAND-USE INTENSITY. IN GENERAL, POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES WERE LOWER ON EXOTIC PLANTS THAN ON NATIVE ONES. SURPRISINGLY, WHILE VISITATION RATES ON NATIVE PLANTS INCREASED WITH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF EXOTICS AND LAND-USE INTENSITY, POLLINATOR VISITATION ON EXOTIC PLANTS DECREASED ALONG THE SAME GRADIENTS. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE SPECIALIZATION OF PLANTS ON POLLINATORS AND VICE VERSA WITH BOTH DRIVERS, REGARDLESS OF PLANT ORIGIN. DECREASES IN POLLINATOR SPECIALIZATION THEREBY SEEMED TO BE MEDIATED BY A SPECIES TURNOVER TOWARDS HABITAT GENERALISTS. HOWEVER, CONTRARY TO EXPECTATIONS, WE DETECTED NO INTERACTIVE EFFECTS BETWEEN THE TWO DRIVERS.

VIS. EXP.,"ALL ORGANISMS INHABIT A WORLD FULL OF SENSORY STIMULI THAT DETERMINE THEIR BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. OLFACTION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN INSECTS, WHICH USE THEIR OLFACTORY SYSTEMS TO RESPOND TO, AND DISCRIMINATE AMONGST, COMPLEX ODOR STIMULI. THESE ODORS ELICIT BEHAVIORS THAT MEDIATE PROCESSES SUCH AS REPRODUCTION AND HABITAT SELECTION(1-3). ADDITIONALLY, CHEMICAL SENSING BY INSECTS MEDIATES BEHAVIORS THAT ARE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT FOR AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN HEALTH, INCLUDING POLLINATION(4-6), HERBIVORY OF FOOD CROPS(7), AND TRANSMISSION OF DISEASE(8,9). IDENTIFICATION OF OLFACTORY SIGNALS AND THEIR ROLE IN INSECT BEHAVIOR IS THUS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BOTH ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND HUMAN FOOD RESOURCES AND WELL-BEING. TO DATE, THE IDENTIFICATION OF VOLATILES THAT DRIVE INSECT BEHAVIOR HAS BEEN DIFFICULT AND OFTEN TEDIOUS. CURRENT TECHNIQUES INCLUDE GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-COUPLED ELECTROANTENNOGRAM RECORDING (GC-EAG), AND GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-COUPLED SINGLE SENSILLUM RECORDINGS (GC-SSR)(10-12). THESE TECHNIQUES PROVED TO BE VITAL IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A METHOD THAT USES GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY COUPLED TO MULTI-CHANNEL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RECORDINGS (TERMED `GCMR') FROM NEURONS IN THE ANTENNAL LOBE (AL, THE INSECT'S PRIMARY OLFACTORY CENTER)(13,14). THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US TO PROBE HOW ODOR INFORMATION IS REPRESENTED IN THE INSECT BRAIN. MOREOVER, BECAUSE NEURAL RESPONSES TO ODORS AT THIS LEVEL OF OLFACTORY PROCESSING ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE OWING TO THE DEGREE OF CONVERGENCE OF THE ANTENNA'S RECEPTOR NEURONS INTO AL NEURONS, AL RECORDINGS WILL ALLOW THE DETECTION OF ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS OF NATURAL ODORS EFFICIENTLY AND WITH HIGH SENSITIVITY. HERE WE DESCRIBE GCMR AND GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF ITS USE. SEVERAL GENERAL STEPS ARE INVOLVED IN THE DETECTION OF BIOACTIVE VOLATILES AND INSECT RESPONSE. VOLATILES FIRST NEED TO BE COLLECTED FROM SOURCES OF INTEREST (IN THIS EXAMPLE WE USE FLOWERS FROM THE GENUS MIMULUS (PHYRMACEAE)) AND CHARACTERIZED AS NEEDED USING STANDARD GC-MS TECHNIQUES(14-16). INSECTS ARE PREPARED FOR STUDY USING MINIMAL DISSECTION, AFTER WHICH A RECORDING ELECTRODE IS INSERTED INTO THE ANTENNAL LOBE AND MULTI-CHANNEL NEURAL RECORDING BEGINS. POST-PROCESSING OF THE NEURAL DATA THEN REVEALS WHICH PARTICULAR ODORANTS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT NEURAL RESPONSES BY THE INSECT NERVOUS SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THE EXAMPLE WE PRESENT HERE IS SPECIFIC TO POLLINATION STUDIES, GCMR CAN BE EXPANDED TO A WIDE RANGE OF STUDY ORGANISMS AND VOLATILE SOURCES. FOR INSTANCE, THIS METHOD CAN BE USED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ODORANTS ATTRACTING OR REPELLING VECTOR INSECTS AND CROP PESTS. MOREOVER, GCMR CAN ALSO BE USED TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTANTS FOR BENEFICIAL INSECTS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS.

ECOL.,"BIOTIC INTERACTIONS DO NOT OCCUR IN ISOLATION BUT ARE IMBEDDED IN A NETWORK OF SPECIES INTERACTIONS. NETWORK ANALYSIS FACILITATES THE COMPILATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITY FOUND IN NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO REVEAL INFORMATION ON THE DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION OF THE INTERACTING PARTNERS AND THEIR NICHES. THE INDICES MEASURING THESE PROPERTIES ARE BASED ON QUALITATIVE OR QUANTITATIVE OBSERVATIONS OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARTNERS FROM DIFFERENT TROPHIC LEVELS, WHICH INFORMS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF NETWORK PATTERNS, BUT NOT ABOUT THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS. FUNCTIONAL TRAITS MAY CONTROL THE INTERACTION STRENGTH BETWEEN PARTNERS AND ALSO THE (MICRO-) STRUCTURE OF NETWORKS. HERE, WE ASK WHETHER FLOWER VISITORS SPECIALIZE ON CERTAIN PLANT TRAITS AND HOW THIS TRAIT SPECIALIZATION CONTRIBUTES TO NICHE PARTITIONING AND INTERACTION PARTNER DIVERSITY. WE INTRODUCE TWO NOVEL STATISTICAL APPROACHES SUITED TO EVALUATE THE DIMENSION OF THE REALIZED NICHE AND TO ANALYSE WHICH TRAITS DETERMINE NICHES. AS BASIS FOR OUR ANALYSIS, WE MEASURED 10 QUANTITATIVE FLOWER TRAITS AND EVALUATED WHETHER 31 ARTHROPOD TAXA I VISITED FLOWERS DISPLAYING ONLY SUBSETS OF THE AVAILABLE TRAIT CHARACTERISTICS, INDICATING A SPECIALIZATION ON THESE TRAITS BY NARROW TRAIT-WIDTHS SI. THE PRODUCT OF 10 TRAIT- AND SPECIES-SPECIFIC TRAIT-WIDTHS SI WAS DEFINED AS TRAIT-VOLUME VI (EXPANSION OF A N-DIMENSIONAL HYPERVOLUME) OCCUPIED BY EACH TAXON I. THESE INDICES ARE APPLICABLE BEYOND FLOWERVISITOR INTERACTIONS TO QUANTIFY REALIZED NICHES BASED ON VARIOUS BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC FACTORS. EACH FLOWER VISITOR SPECIES SHOWED SOME DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION TO A UNIQUE SET OF FLOWER TRAITS (REALIZED NICHE). OVERALL, OUR DATA SUGGESTED A HIERARCHICAL SEQUENCE OF FLOWER TRAITS INFLUENCING THE FLOWER VISITORS' BEHAVIOUR AND THUS NETWORK STRUCTURE: FLOWERING PHENOLOGY WAS FOUND TO HAVE THE STRONGEST EFFECT, FOLLOWED BY FLOWER HEIGHT, NECTAR-TUBE DEPTH AND FLORAL REFLECTANCE.

EVOL.,"IN THE PAPILIONACEOUS FLOWERS WITH EXPLOSIVE POLLINATION MECHANISM, THE ANDROECIUM AND THE GYNOECIUM ARE SUBJECTED TO GREAT PRESSURE IN THE KEEL. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT AT THE FIRST VISIT NEARLY ALL POLLEN GRAINS ARE RELEASED AND THAT THE FLORAL PARTS DO NOT RETURN TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITIONS, THIS WOULD BE A CUE FOR POLLINATORS TO AVOID ACTIVATED FLOWERS. THE DEPENDENCE ON THE POLLINATORS SUGGESTS THAT EXPLOSIVE FLOWERS WILL NOT PRODUCE FRUITS IF THE MECHANISM IS NOT ACTIVATED. IN THIS PAPER, WE HAVE TESTED THESE IDEAS STUDYING THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF THREE DESMODIUM SPECIES, D. INCANUM, D. SUBSERICIUM AND D. UNCINATUM. SPECIFICALLY, WE STUDIED THE FLORAL TRAITS, REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, POLLINATION MECHANISM AND FLORAL VISITORS, FOR THE THREE SPECIES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE KEEL AND THE WINGS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE ACTIVATION OF THE EXPLOSIVE MECHANISM. THE THREE SPECIES HAVE A SECONDARY POLLEN PRESENTATION, DIURNAL FLOWERS, AND A SHORT FLORAL CYCLE. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, ALL THE SPECIES STUDIED WERE SELF-COMPATIBLE, WITH TWO SPECIES PRODUCING FRUITS BY AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION. DESMODIUM FLOWERS WERE VISITED AND ACTIVATED BY NATIVE AND EXOTIC BEE SPECIES. DURING THE FIRST VISIT NEARLY ALL THE POLLEN WAS RELEASED, AFTER THAT, NEW VISITS WERE LOW OR NULL. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE ACTIVATION OF THE MECHANISM IS NOT ESSENTIAL FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FRUITS, THAT EXPLOSIVE FLOWERS ARE VISITED ONLY ONCE AND THAT THE CHANGES IN THE POSITIONS OF THE FLORAL PARTS ARE THE CUES THAT KEEP POLLINATORS AWAY FROM THE FLOWERS WITH ACTIVATED MECHANISM.",DESMODIUM; EXPLOSIVE POLLINATION; KEEL BLOSSOM; PAPILIONOIDEAE,POLLEN-OVULE RATIOS; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; FABACEAE; FLOWERS; MORPHOLOGY; TRAITS; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ORTEGA-BAES, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL SALTA, FAC CIENCIAS NAT, CONICET, LAB INVEST BOT LABIBO, AVE BOLIVIA 5150, RA-4400 SALTA, ARGENTINA.;ALEMAN, MERCEDES, FIGUEROA-FLEMING, TRINIDAD, ETCHEVERRY, ANGELA, UNIV NACL SALTA, FAC CIENCIAS NAT, RA-4400 SALTA, ARGENTINA.;SUEHRING, SILVIA, ORTEGA-BAES, PABLO, UNIV NACL SALTA, FAC CIENCIAS NAT, CONICET, LAB INVEST BOT LABIBO, RA-4400 SALTA, ARGENTINA.",10.1007/S00606-013-0869-8,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",NA,PROMAGRO; CONICETCONSEJO NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIONES CIENTIFICAS Y TECNICAS (CONICET); ANPCYTANPCYT [PICTO 36670]; CIUNSA [1850/3],"THE AUTHORS THANK THE HANDLING EDITOR, MARLIES SAZIMA, AND ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR THEIR SIGNIFICANT COMMENTS THAT HAVE IMPROVED THIS MANUSCRIPT.

J. BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: ALTHOUGH SPATIAL DISTANCE IS CONSIDERED THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN DETERMINING PLANT MATING PATTERNS, FLOWERING TIME AND SYNCHRONY ARE ALSO LIKELY TO BE IMPORTANT. METHODS: WE QUANTIFIED THE RELATIONSHIPS OF BOTH DISTANCE AND FLOWERING PHENOLOGY TO THE PROBABILITY OF MATING BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. IN AN EXPERIMENTAL PLOT, WE FOLLOWED DAILY FLOWERING PHENOLOGY IN ECHINACEA ANGUSTIFOLIA, A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE PERENNIAL POLLINATED BY SOLITARY BEES. WE ASSIGNED PATERNITY TO 832 OF 927 SEEDLINGS FROM 37 MATERNAL PLANTS USING 11 MICROSATELLITE LOCI. POTENTIAL POLLEN DONORS INCLUDED THE EXPERIMENT PLOT'S 202 FLOWERING PLANTS AND A NEARBY PLOT'S 19 FLOWERING PLANTS. FOR EACH MATERNAL PLANT SAMPLED, WE EXAMINED THE POLLEN POOL BY QUANTIFYING CORRELATED PATERNITY AND THE EFFECTIVE NUMBER OF POLLEN DONORS. KEY RESULTS: SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLLINATIONS OCCURRED BETWEEN NEIGHBORING AND SYNCHRONOUS PLANTS THAN EXPECTED UNDER RANDOM MATING, WITH DISTANCE BEING MORE IMPORTANT THAN FLOWERING SYNCHRONY. THE DISTANCE POLLEN MOVED VARIED OVER THE COURSE OF THE SEASON, WITH LATE FLOWERING PLANTS MATING WITH MORE DISTANT PLANTS COMPARED TO EARLY OR PEAK FLOWERING PLANTS. ALL MATERNAL PLANTS HAD A DIVERSE SET OF MATES (MEAN NUMBER OF EFFECTIVE POLLEN DONORS=23.7), AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE POLLEN POOLS OVERLAPPED LITTLE BETWEEN MATERNAL PLANTS. CONCLUSION: BOTH DISTANCE AND FLOWERING SYNCHRONY INFLUENCED POLLINATION PATTERNS IN E. ANGUSTIFOLIA. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLEN MOVEMENT BETWEEN INCOMPATIBLE MATES AND FLOWERING ASYNCHRONY COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO THE REDUCED SEED SET OBSERVED IN SMALL E. ANGUSTIFOLIA REMNANTS.

HOWEVER, WHEN AN INVASIVE PLANT PROVIDES RESOURCES UTILIZED BY NATIVE POLLINATORS THIS COULD INCREASE POLLINATOR POPULATION SIZES AND THEREBY POLLINATION SUCCESS IN NATIVES. EFFECTS MEDIATED THROUGH CHANGES IN POLLINATOR POPULATION SIZES HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES, AND THE DOMINANCE OF NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS SUGGESTED BY META-ANALYSES MAY THEREFORE BE BIASED.

SCI.,"ALTHOUGH POLLINATORS CAN PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN DETERMINING THE STRUCTURE AND STABILITY OF PLANT COMMUNITIES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THEIR ADAPTIVE FORAGING BEHAVIOURS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, E. G. FLOWER CONSTANCY, STRUCTURE THESE INTERACTIONS. HERE, WE CONSTRUCT A MATHEMATICAL MODEL THAT INTEGRATES INDIVIDUAL ADAPTIVE FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND POPULATION DYNAMICS OF A COMMUNITY CONSISTING OF TWO PLANT SPECIES AND A POLLINATOR SPECIES. WE FIND THAT ADAPTIVE FORAGING AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, AS A COMPLEMENTARY MECHANISM TO ADAPTIVE FORAGING AT THE SPECIES LEVEL, CAN FURTHER ENHANCE THE COEXISTENCE OF PLANT SPECIES THROUGH NICHE PARTITIONING BETWEEN CONSPECIFIC POLLINATORS. THE STABILIZING EFFECT IS STRONGER THAN THAT OF UNBIASED GENERALISTS WHEN THERE IS ALSO STRONG COMPETITION BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES OVER OTHER RESOURCES, BUT LESS SO THAN THAT OF MULTIPLE SPECIALIST SPECIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT ADAPTIVE FORAGING IN MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS CAN HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON THE PLANT COMMUNITY STRUCTURE FROM THAT IN PREDATOR-PREY INTERACTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOUR OF INDIVIDUAL POLLINATORS MAY CAUSE A SHARP REGIME SHIFT FOR INVADING PLANT SPECIES.

THE PRESENT STUDY ON NESTING BIOLOGY OF CERATINA PROPINQUA AND CERATINA SIMILLIMA WAS CARRIED OUT TO GENERATE INFORMATION ABOUT NESTING SHELTERS AND ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF THESE BEES FOR THEIR CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT. SURVEYS AT WEEKLY INTERVALS WERE CONDUCTED FROM AUGUST, 2011 TO JUNE, 2012 IN THE PROBABLE NESTING SITES. THE NEST MAKING PERIOD FOR C. PROPINQUA AND C. SIMILLIMA AT PANTNAGAR WAS THE MONTH OF MAY-JUNE. BOTH SPECIES CONSTRUCTED LINEAR NESTS IN THE SOFT PITH. C. PROPINQUA FEMALES IN DEAD WOOD OF SESBANIA BISPINOSA (JACQ.) (FABACEAE) AND IN OPEN END BRANCHES OF CAESALPINIA PULCHERRIMA (L.) (FABACEAE), WHILE C. SIMILLIMA FEMALES USED ONLY CAESALPINIA AS ITS NESTING SHELTER. THE COMPLETE NEST OF C. PROPINQUA CONTAINED A SERIES OF BROOD CELLS WHICH WERE FREQUENTLY SEPARATED BY EMPTY CELLS (THE OLDEST CELL BELOW) WHILE C. SIMILLIMA NESTS WERE OBSERVED WITHOUT EMPTY CELLS. CELL PARTITIONS WERE MADE OF PITH COMPACTLY PACKED TOGETHER, PARTITIONS UPPER SURFACES WERE IRREGULARLY FLAT AND LOWER SURFACES WERE USUALLY CONCAVE IN BOTH THE SPECIES. BROOD CELLS HAVE IMMATURE STAGES ALONG WITH OR WITHOUT BEE BREAD (PROVISION) AND FAECAL MATERIALS. ORIENTATION OF PREPUPAE, PUPAE AND PREADULTS OF C.

UP TO 75\% OF CROP SPECIES BENEFIT AT LEAST TO SOME DEGREE FROM ANIMAL POLLINATION FOR FRUIT OR SEED SET AND YIELD. HOWEVER, BASIC INFORMATION ON THE LEVEL OF POLLINATOR DEPENDENCE AND POLLINATOR CONTRIBUTION TO YIELD IS LACKING FOR MANY CROPS. EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW INSECT POLLINATION AFFECTS CROP QUALITY. GIVEN THAT HABITAT LOSS AND AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ARE KNOWN TO DECREASE POLLINATOR RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE, THERE IS A NEED TO ASSESS THE CONSEQUENCES FOR DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF CROP PRODUCTION. METHODS. WE USED POLLINATION EXCLUSION ON FLOWERS OR INFLORESCENCES ON A WHOLE PLANT BASIS TO ASSESS THE CONTRIBUTION OF INSECT POLLINATION TO CROP YIELD AND QUALITY IN FOUR FLOWERING CROPS (SPRING OILSEED RAPE, FIELD BEAN, STRAWBERRY, AND BUCKWHEAT) LOCATED IN FOUR REGIONS OF EUROPE. FOR EACH CROP, WE RECORDED ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWER VISITING INSECTS IN TEN FIELDS LOCATED ALONG A GRADIENT FROM SIMPLE TO HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES. RESULTS. INSECT POLLINATION ENHANCED AVERAGE CROP YIELD BETWEEN 18 AND 71\% DEPENDING ON THE CROP. YIELD QUALITY WAS ALSO ENHANCED IN MOST CROPS. FOR INSTANCE, OILSEED RAPE HAD HIGHER OIL AND LOWER CHLOROPHYLL CONTENTS WHEN ADEQUATELY POLLINATED, THE PROPORTION OF EMPTY SEEDS DECREASED IN BUCKWHEAT, AND STRAWBERRIES' COMMERCIAL GRADE IMPROVED, HOWEVER, WE DID NOT FIND HIGHER NITROGEN CONTENT IN OPEN POLLINATED FIELD BEANS. COMPLEX LANDSCAPES HAD A HIGHER OVERALL SPECIES RICHNESS OF WILD POLLINATORS ACROSS CROPS, BUT VISITATION RATES WERE ONLY HIGHER IN COMPLEX LANDSCAPES FOR SOME CROPS. ON THE CONTRARY, THE OVERALL YIELD WAS CONSISTENTLY ENHANCED BY HIGHER VISITATION RATES, BUT NOT BY HIGHER POLLINATOR RICHNESS. DISCUSSION. FOR THE FOUR CROPS IN THIS STUDY, THERE IS CLEAR BENEFIT DELIVERED BY POLLINATORS ON YIELD QUANTITY AND/OR QUALITY, BUT IT IS NOT MAXIMIZED UNDER CURRENT AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION.

DIVERS.,"BATESIAN MIMICRY HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY REPORTED IN SYRPHID FLIES (DIPTERA: SYRPHIDAE), WITH NOXIOUS HYMENOPTERA IDENTIFIED AS THE MODELS, INCLUDING BUMBLEBEES (HYMENOPTERA: ACULEATA). DESPITE THE NUMBER OF DETAILED STUDIES OF BUMBLEBEE MIMICS FROM THE HOLARCTIC, ONLY MINIMAL BIOLOGICAL AND ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THE SAME PHENOMENON IN MOST OTHER BIOGEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. HERE, WE ANALYSE IN DETAIL A CASE OF BATESIAN MIMICRY BY THE SYRPHID FLY ANERIOPHORA AUREORUFA PHILIPPI TOWARDS THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII GUERIN FROM PATAGONIA, A RELATIONSHIP ONLY BRIEFLY NOTED PREVIOUSLY IN TAXONOMIC STUDIES. A. AUREORUFA POSSESSES STRIKINGLY SIMILAR RED TAWNY COLOURATION TO THE HIGHLY HAIRY BODY OF ITS MODEL, AND SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES IT ALSO IN SIZE. CLUSTER ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE MIMICRY IS MORE PRONOUNCED TOWARDS LARGER RATHER THAN SMALLER BUMBLEBEE WORKERS. THE MIMICRY IS VISUALLY VERY GOOD, BUT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A BEHAVIOURAL COMPONENT. FORAGING ACTIVITY OF BOTH SPECIES SEEMS TO BE LARGELY RESTRICTED TO THE ENDEMIC PLANT EUCRYPHIA CORDIFOLIA. THE TIME SPENT ON FLOWERS WAS MUCH HIGHER IN SYRPHID FLIES THAN IN B. DAHLBOMII AND OTHER POLLINATORS, AND THE TIME SPENT BETWEEN FLOWER VISITS LARGELY OVERLAPPED BETWEEN ALL THE TESTED SPECIES.

MANAGE.,"WE INVESTIGATED THE RATE OF POLLEN-MEDIATED FLOW AND REALIZED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AT INCREASING DISTANCES FROM THE SOURCE, ACROSS FRAGMENTED CLONAL STANDS OF HYBRID EUCALYPTS IN BRAZIL BY PARENTAGE ANALYSIS OF GROWN OUT SEEDLINGS USING GENETIC DATA AT 15 MICROSATELLITE MARKERS. TWO STUDY AREAS WERE EMPLOYED: A POLLEN DONOR AREA COMPOSED OF A CLONAL STAND OF A SINGLE POLLEN DONOR CLONE (PD) AND A POLLEN SINK (PS) AREA COMPOSED OF A MIXED CLONAL STAND OF TWO OTHER CLONES (PSI AND PS2). IN THE POLLEN SINK AREA FOUR PLOTS WITH 30 TREES EACH, LOCATED AT 25, 200, 400 AND 550 M FROM THE PD WERE ESTABLISHED AS SINK ISLANDS. BEFORE FLOWERING, THE ENTIRE CLONAL STANDS OF CLONES PSI AND PS2, WITH EXCEPTION OF THE SINK ISLANDS WERE CLEAR CUT. SEEDS WERE HARVESTED FROM FIVE RANDOMLY SAMPLED TREES IN EACH SINK ISLAND AND THE PATERNITY OF 15 SEEDLINGS PER TREE, 75 SEEDLINGS PER ISLAND TOTALING A SAMPLE OF 300 SEEDLINGS, WAS DETERMINED WITH PD AS THE ALLEGED FATHER. THE SELF-POLLINATION RATE IN THE SINK ISLANDS VARIED FROM ZERO TO 24\%. PATERNITY ASSIGNMENT TO THE PD WAS HIGHEST IN THE ISLAND AT 25 M (17.3\%) AND RAPIDLY DECREASED TO 4.0\% AT 200 M AND 2.7\% AT 550 M, SUGGESTING A PATTERN OF ISOLATION BY DISTANCE, WHILE REVEALING A LARGE POLLEN CONTRIBUTION FROM UNACCOUNTED SOURCES ACROSS ALL ISLANDS. OUR RESULTS IN A FRAGMENTED CLONAL SITE AGREE WITH PREVIOUS ESTIMATES OF GENERAL POLLEN MOVEMENT IN EUCALYPT SEED ORCHARDS, SHOWING THAT POLLINATION WILL TAKE PLACE BY AND LARGE AT RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCES OF LESS THAN 200 M, CONSISTENT WITH THE EXPECTED RANGE OF FLIGHT OF POLLINATOR BEES. NEVERTHELESS THE EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION OBSERVED ALSO INDICATES THAT LOW LEVELS OF POLLINATION SUCCESS ARE TO BE EXPECTED OVER LONGER DISTANCES. OUR DATA PROVIDE USEFUL GUIDELINES REGARDING THE DISTANCE AT WHICH SEED ORCHARDS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AWAY FROM POTENTIALLY LARGE POLLEN PRESSURE OF CLONAL STANDS TO MINIMIZE UNWANTED POLLEN INTROGRESSION. FURTHERMORE, OUR RESULTS ON DISPERSAL RATE AND DISTANCE OF POLLEN HAVE DIRECT IMPLICATIONS ON GENE CONTAINMENT STRATEGIES AND MODELING STUDIES, AS POLLEN-MEDIATED GENE FLOW IS ONE OF THE KEY DETERMINANTS OF THE POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL AND BIOSAFETY IMPACTS OF PROSPECTIVE TRANSGENIC EUCALYPTS.

HEATHLANDS, PROTECTED OPEN HABITATS UNDER EU LAW, PROVIDE FLORAL RESOURCES (POLLEN AND NECTAR) FOR A RANGE OF POLLINATING INSECTS. IN EARLY SPRING, IN BELGIAN HEATHLANDS, ONLY TWO FLORAL RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE: WILLOWS SALIX SPP. (SALICACEAE) AND BILBERRY VACCINIUM MYRTILLUS (ERICACEAE). OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER THESE TWO PLANT SPECIES PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESOURCES DURING EARLY SPRING. WE EXAMINED THE SPRINGTIME ACTIVITY OF FLOWER VISITORS ON BOTH S. X MULTINERVIS AND V. MYRTILLUS FLOWERS IN RELATION TO SUGAR CONCENTRATION AND COMPOSITION IN NECTAR AS WELL AS COMPOSITION OF POLYPEPTIDES AND AMINO ACIDS IN POLLEN. THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF POLLEN DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TWO PLANT SPECIES. SALIX X MULTINERVIS OFFERED POLLEN WITH HIGHER POLYPEPTIDE AND ESSENTIAL AMINO ACID CONTENTS THAN V. MYRTILLUS. HOWEVER, NECTAR QUANTITIES OF V. MYRTILLUS FLOWERS WERE RELATIVELY HIGH COMPARED TO S. X MULTINERVIS.

CONSERV.,"AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEME HABITATS CAN SUPPORT DECLINING POLLINATORS, BUT OPTIMUM APPROACHES FOR DEPLOYMENT REMAIN UNCERTAIN. THE IMPACT OF THREE MANAGEMENT TREATMENTS (PROJECT-, FARM-MANAGED AND ORGANIC FARMING) ALONGSIDE HABITAT TYPE, QUANTITY OF UNCROPPED LAND REMOVED FROM PRODUCTION AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION (STRIPS OR BLOCKS) ON WILD BEES, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES WERE INVESTIGATED. POLLINATORS WERE ASSESSED ON 28 SITES OVER THREE YEARS, ALONG BOUNDARIES REPRESENTING SITE SCALE (CA. 100-HA) AND WITHIN PROJECT-MANAGED (FLORISTICALLY ENHANCED GRASS, WILD BIRD SEED MIX, INSECT RICH COVER AND NATURAL REGENERATION) OR FARM-MANAGED WILDLIFE HABITATS (TYPICALLY GRASS MARGINS OR GAME COVER). PROJECT-MANAGEMENT RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF THE MOST WIDELY UTILISED HABITATS (FLORISTICALLY ENHANCED GRASS AND WILD BIRD SEED MIXTURES), BUT THESE MAY ATTRACT WILD BEES AWAY FROM BOUNDARIES WHEREAS BUTTERFLY ABUNDANCE (LYCAENIDAE AND PIERIDAE) WAS ENHANCED ALONG FIELD BOUNDARIES. ORGANIC MANAGEMENT AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF HABITATS HAD LITTLE IMPACT. PROPORTION OF UNCROPPED LAND PER SITE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO CUCKOO BEE, LYCAENIDAE AND SATYRIDAE DENSITY AND BUTTERFLY SPECIES RICHNESS AT SITE SCALE AND ON THE DENSITY OF SEVERAL BEE SPECIES, TOTAL WILD BEES, PIERIDAE AND TOTAL BUTTERFLIES IN WILDLIFE HABITATS. THE MEAN ABUNDANCE OF UNCROPPED LAND WAS 3.6\% AND AT LEAST DOUBLE THIS WAS REQUIRED TO DOUBLE THE ABUNDANCE OF WILD BEES AND BUTTERFLIES. WILD BEE DENSITIES WERE HIGHEST IN FIELD BOUNDARIES AND FLORISTICALLY ENHANCED GRASS AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FLOWER COVER. BUTTERFLIES SOUGHT HABITATS CONTAINING THEIR LARVAL FOOD PLANTS AND HIGH FLOWER COVER. HOVERFLIES WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN THE INSECT RICH COVER. WILDLIFE HABITAT IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES MAY BE INSUFFICIENT AND ADDITIONAL, DIVERSE HABITATS ARE NEEDED TO ENCOURAGE POLLINATORS. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.

HEXANDRA SHOWS A LATE-ACTING SELF-INCOMPATIBLE SYSTEM. MOREOVER, HERKOGAMY AND PORICIDAL ANTHERS PREVENT SPONTANEOUS SELF-POLLINATION IN D. INCURVA. THEREFORE, MEDIUM- TO LARGE-SIZED APIDAE ARE THE MOST SUITABLE POLLINATORS AS THEY MAKE REGULAR CONTACT WITH ANTHERS AND STIGMAS AND ARE FURTHER KNOWN TO PERFORM TRAPLINE FORAGING. THIS BEHAVIOUR IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR D. HEXANDRA WHERE HALICTIDAE ARE CONSIDERED POLLEN ROBBERS, THUS WASTING POLLEN WHICH, CONSEQUENTLY, CAUSES LOW REPRODUCTIVE EFFICACY IN THIS SPECIES.

APPL.,"GLOBAL TRENDS IN POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT CROPS HAVE RAISED AWARENESS OF THE NEED TO SUPPORT MANAGED AND WILD BEE POPULATIONS TO ENSURE SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION. PROVISION OF SUFFICIENT FORAGE RESOURCES IS A KEY ELEMENT FOR PROMOTING BEE POPULATIONS WITHIN HUMAN IMPACTED LANDSCAPES, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN AGRICULTURAL LANDS WHERE DEMAND FOR POLLINATION SERVICE IS HIGH AND LAND USE AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES HAVE REDUCED AVAILABLE FLOWERING RESOURCES. RECENT GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE SUPPORT THE PLANTING OF WILDFLOWERS TO BENEFIT POLLINATORS, SURPRISINGLY, IN NORTH AMERICA THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST NO RIGOROUS TESTING OF THE PERFORMANCE OF WILDFLOWER MIXES, OR THEIR ABILITY TO SUPPORT WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY. WE TESTED DIFFERENT WILDFLOWER MIXES IN A SPATIALLY REPLICATED, MULTIYEAR STUDY IN THREE REGIONS OF NORTH AMERICA WHERE PRODUCTION OF POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT CROPS IS HIGH: FLORIDA, MICHIGAN, AND CALIFORNIA. IN EACH REGION, WE QUANTIFIED FLOWERING AMONG WILDFLOWER MIXES COMPOSED OF ANNUAL AND PERENNIAL SPECIES, AND WITH HIGH AND LOW RELATIVE DIVERSITY. WE MEASURED THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF WILD BEES, HONEY BEES, AND SYRPHID FLIES AT EACH MIX OVER TWO SEASONS. IN EACH REGION, SOME BUT NOT ALL WILDFLOWER MIXES PROVIDED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FLORAL DISPLAY AREA THAN UNMANAGED WEEDY CONTROL PLOTS. MIXES ALSO ATTRACTED GREATER ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF WILD BEES, ALTHOUGH THE IDENTITY OF BEST MIXES VARIED AMONG REGIONS. BY PARTITIONING FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE FROM MIX IDENTITY WE SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF DISPLAY SIZE FOR ATTRACTING ABUNDANT AND DIVERSE WILD BEES. SEASON-LONG MONITORING ALSO REVEALED THAT DESIGNING MIXES TO PROVIDE CONTINUOUS BLOOM THROUGHOUT THE GROWING SEASON IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORTING THE GREATEST POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS. CONTRARY TO EXPECTATION, PERENNIALS BLOOMED IN THEIR FIRST SEASON, AND COMPLEMENTARITY IN ATTRACTION OF POLLINATORS AMONG ANNUALS AND PERENNIALS SUGGESTS THAT INCLUSION OF FUNCTIONALLY DIVERSE SPECIES MAY PROVIDE THE GREATEST BENEFIT. WILDFLOWER MIXES MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR SOME TAXA, SUCH AS BUMBLE BEES, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO BE IN DECLINE IN SEVERAL REGIONS OF NORTH AMERICA.

EVOL.,"INCREASING HUMAN LAND USE FOR AGRICULTURE AND HOUSING LEADS TO THE LOSS OF NATURAL HABITAT AND TO WIDESPREAD DECLINES IN WILD BEES. BEE FORAGING DYNAMICS AND FITNESS DEPEND ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE, BUT HOW PRECISELY LANDSCAPE RELATED RESOURCE DIFFERENCES AFFECT BEE FORAGING PATTERNS REMAINS UNCLEAR. TO INVESTIGATE HOW LANDSCAPE AND ITS INTERACTION WITH SEASON AND WEATHER DRIVE FORAGING AND RESOURCE INTAKE IN SOCIAL BEES, WE EXPERIMENTALLY COMPARED FORAGING ACTIVITY, THE ALLOCATION OF FORAGERS TO DIFFERENT RESOURCES (POLLEN, NECTAR, AND RESIN) AND OVERALL RESOURCE INTAKE IN THE AUSTRALIAN STINGLESS BEE TETRAGONULA CARBONARIA (APIDAE, MELIPONINI). BEE COLONIES WERE MONITORED IN DIFFERENT SEASONS OVER TWO YEARS. WE COMPARED FORAGING PATTERNS AND RESOURCE INTAKE BETWEEN THE BEES' NATURAL HABITAT (FORESTS) AND TWO LANDSCAPES DIFFERENTLY ALTERED BY HUMANS (SUBURBAN GARDENS AND AGRICULTURAL MACADAMIA PLANTATIONS). WE FOUND FORAGING ACTIVITY AS WELL AS POLLEN AND NECTAR FORAGER NUMBERS TO BE HIGHEST IN SUBURBAN GARDENS, INTERMEDIATE IN FORESTS AND LOW IN PLANTATIONS. FORAGING PATTERNS FURTHER DIFFERED BETWEEN SEASONS, BUT SEASONAL VARIATIONS STRONGLY DIFFERED BETWEEN LANDSCAPES. SUGAR AND POLLEN INTAKE WAS LOW IN PLANTATIONS, BUT CONTRARY WITH OUR PREDICTIONS, IT WAS EVEN HIGHER IN GARDENS THAN IN FORESTS. IN CONTRAST, RESIN INTAKE WAS SIMILAR ACROSS LANDSCAPES. CONSEQUENTLY, DIFFERENCES IN RESOURCE AVAILABILITY BETWEEN NATURAL AND ALTERED LANDSCAPES STRONGLY AFFECT FORAGING PATTERNS AND THUS RESOURCE INTAKE IN SOCIAL BEES. WHILE AGRICULTURAL MONOCULTURES LARGELY REDUCE FORAGING SUCCESS, SUBURBAN GARDENS CAN INCREASE RESOURCE INTAKE WELL ABOVE RATES FOUND IN NATURAL HABITATS OF BEES, INDICATING THAT HUMAN ACTIVITIES CAN BOTH DECREASE AND INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES IN A LANDSCAPE AND THUS REDUCE OR ENHANCE BEE FITNESS.",ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES; CLIMATE FACTORS; MELIPONINES; RESOURCE AVAILABILITY; URBANIZATION,STINGLESS BEES; HONEY-BEES; OFFSPRING PRODUCTION; POLLINATOR DECLINES; INSECT POLLINATORS; MACADAMIA FLOWERS; LANDSCAPE CONTEXT; WILD POLLINATORS; FLORAL RESOURCES; FLIGHT ACTIVITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,31,"LEONHARDT, SD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WURZBURG, DEPT ANIM ECOL \& TROP BIOL, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., LEUPHANA UNIV, INST ECOL, D-21335 LUNEBURG, GERMANY.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., WALLACE, HELEN, UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, FAC SCI HLTH EDUC \& ENGN, MAROOCHYDORE 4558, AUSTRALIA.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., LEONHARDT, SARA D., UNIV WURZBURG, DEPT ANIM ECOL \& TROP BIOL, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;HEARD, TIM A., CSIRO ECOSYST SCI, BRISBANE, QLD 4001, AUSTRALIA.;KLEIN, ALEXANDRA-MARIA, UNIV FREIBURG, CHAIR NAT NAT CONSERVAT \& LANDSCAPE ECOL, D-79085 FREIBURG, GERMANY.",10.1002/ECE3.1941,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE AGENCY (DAAD)DEUTSCHER AKADEMISCHER AUSTAUSCH DIENST (DAAD); GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG)GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [LE 2750/1-1]; DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [LE 2750/1-1],"BFK RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE AGENCY (DAAD).

OVER SEVEN YEARS, WE RECORDED THE FREQUENCIES OF THE TWO COLOR MORPHS IN 17 POPULATIONS ALONG A 156 KM SOUTH-NORTH TRANSECT WITH A STEEP RAINFALL GRADIENT, THE PROPORTION OF WHITE INFLORESCENCES PER POPULATION CONSISTENTLY DECREASED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH, AND [HEIR MEAN PROPORTION DECREASED FROM 24\% TO 12Y OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, FOUR OF THE POPULATIONS WENT EXTINCT, BUT TWO WERE RECOLONIZED, AND TWO ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS DECREASED TO <10 INDIVIDUALS. TO TEST WHETHER THE COLOR MORPHS DIFFER IN FITNESS, WE COLLECTED THE RIPE INFLORESCENCES SHORTLY BEFORE SEED DISPERSAL FROM ALL DIMORPHIC POPULATIONS IN TWO FLOWERING SEASONS. THE NUMBERS OF DEVELOPED, PARTIALLY EATEN AND ABORTED SEEDS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN COLOR MORPHS. THERE WAS ALSO NO GEOGRAPHICAL TREND IN THE NUMBERS OF DEVELOPED, ABORTED AND PARTIALLY EATEN SEEDS IN EITHER MORPH. INSECT POLLINATORS DID NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE WHITE MORPH. THUS, THE DECLINE OF WHITE-FLOWERING PLANTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS WITH POLLINATORS OR WITH SEED HERBIVORES, TWO POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT AGENTS AFFECTING SEED OUTPUT.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS FAVOUR POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF POLLEN. HOWEVER, LARGE FLORAL DISPLAYS ALSO HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS, SUCH AS INCREASED GEITONOGAMY, POLLEN DISCOUNTING AND NECTAR/POLLEN ROBBER ATTRACTION. THE SIZE OF THE FLORAL DISPLAY CAN BE MEASURED AT DIFFERENT SCALES (E.G. THE FLOWER, INFLORESCENCE OR ENTIRE PLANT) AND VARIATIONS IN ONE OF THESE SCALES MAY AFFECT THE BEHAVIOUR OF FLOWER VISITORS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. MOREOVER, THE FRAGMENTATION OF NATURAL FORESTS MAY AFFECT FLOWER VISITATION RATES AND FLOWER VISITOR BEHAVIOUR. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, VIDEO RECORDINGS OF THE INFLORESCENCES OF A TREE SPECIES (TABEBUIA AUREA) FROM THE TROPICAL SAVANNAH OF CENTRAL BRAZIL WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AT THE INFLORESCENCE AND TREE SCALES ON THE VISITATION RATE OF POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS TO THE INFLORESCENCE, THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS APPROACHED PER VISIT, THE NUMBER OF VISITS PER FLOWER OF POTENTIAL POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS, AND THE INTERACTION OF THESE VARIABLES WITH THE DEGREE OF LANDSCAPE DISTURBANCE. NECTAR PRODUCTION WAS QUANTIFIED WITH RESPECT TO FLOWER AGE. ALTHOUGH LARGE BEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE POLLINATION, A GREAT DIVERSITY OF FLOWER INSECTS VISIT THE INFLORESCENCES OF T.AUREA. OTHER BEE AND HUMMINGBIRD SPECIES ARE HIGHLY ACTIVE NECTAR ROBBERS. INCREASES IN INFLORESCENCE SIZE INCREASE THE VISITATION RATE OF POLLINATORS TO INFLORESCENCES, WHEREAS INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INFLORESCENCES ON THE TREE DECREASE VISITATION RATES TO INFLORESCENCES AND FLOWERS.

ENTOMOL.,"BUMBLE BEES (GENUS BOMBUS) ARE GLOBALLY IMPORTANT INSECT POLLINATORS, AND SEVERAL SPECIES HAVE EXPERIENCED MARKED DECLINES IN RECENT YEARS. BOTH NUTRITIONAL LIMITATION AND PATHOGENS MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE DECLINES. WHILE EACH OF THESE FACTORS MAY BE INDIVIDUALLY IMPORTANT, THERE MAY ALSO BE SYNERGISMS WHERE NUTRITIONAL STRESS COULD DECREASE PATHOGEN RESISTANCE. UNDERSTANDING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BUMBLE BEES, THEIR PARASITES, AND FOOD AVAILABILITY MAY PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE CAUSES OF DECLINES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE COMBINED IMPACTS OF POLLEN AND NECTAR LIMITATION ON CRITHIDIA, A COMMON GUT PARASITE IN BOMBUS IMPATIENS CRESSON. INDIVIDUAL WORKER BEES WERE INOCULATED WITH CRITHIDIA AND THEN ASSIGNED IN A FACTORIAL DESIGN TO TWO LEVELS OF POLLEN AVAILABILITY (POLLEN OR NO POLLEN) AND TWO NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATIONS (HIGH [30\%] OR LOW [15\%] SUCROSE). WE FOUND THAT LACK OF POLLEN AND LOW NECTAR SUGAR BOTH REDUCED CRITHIDIA CELL COUNTS, WITH THE MOST DRAMATIC EFFECT FROM LACK OF POLLEN. BOTH POLLEN AVAILABILITY AND NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION WERE ALSO IMPORTANT FOR BEE SURVIVAL. THE PROPORTION OF BEES THAT DIED AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF INFECTION WAS SIMILAR TO 25\% LOWER IN BEES WITH ACCESS TO POLLEN AND HIGH NECTAR SUGAR CONCENTRATION THAN ANY OTHER TREATMENT.

BIOL.,"THE INTERACTIONS OF PLANTS WITH THEIR POLLINATORS ARE THOUGHT TO BE A DRIVING FORCE IN THE EVOLUTION OF ANGIOSPERMS. ADAPTATION TO A NEW POLLINATOR INVOLVES COORDINATED CHANGES IN MULTIPLE FLORAL TRAITS CONTROLLED BY MULTIPLE GENES. SURPRISINGLY, SUCH COMPLEX GENETIC SHIFTS HAVE HAPPENED NUMEROUS TIMES DURING EVOLUTION. HERE WE REPORT ON THE GENETIC BASIS OF THE CHANGES IN ONE SUCH TRAIT, FLORAL SCENT EMISSION, IN THE GENUS PETUNIA (SOLANACEAE). THE INCREASE IN THE QUANTITY AND COMPLEXITY OF THE VOLATILES DURING THE SHIFT FROM BEE TO HAWKMOTH POLLINATION WAS DUE TO DE NOVO EXPRESSION OF THE GENES ENCODING BENZOIC ACID/SALICYLIC ACID CARBOXYL METHYLTRANSFERASE (BSMT) AND BENZOYL-COA: BENZYLALCOHOL/ 2-PHENYLETHANOL BENZOYLTRANSFERASE (BPBT) TOGETHER WITH MODERATELY INCREASED TRANSCRIPT LEVELS FOR MOST ENZYMES OF THE PHENYLPROPANOID/BENZENOID PATHWAY. LOSS OF CINNAMATE-COA LIGASE (CNL) FUNCTION AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE MYB TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ODO1 EXPLAIN THE LOSS OF SCENT DURING THE TRANSITION FROM MOTH TO HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION. THE CNL GENE IN THE HUMMINGBIRD-ADAPTED SPECIES IS INACTIVE DUE TO A STOP CODON, BUT ALSO APPEARS TO HAVE UNDERGONE FURTHER DEGRADATION OVER TIME. THEREFORE, WE PROPOSE THAT LOSS OF SCENT HAPPENED RELATIVELY EARLY IN THE TRANSITION TOWARD HUMMINGBIRD POLLINATION, AND PROBABLY PRECEDED THE LOSS OF UV-ABSORBING FLAVONOLS. THE DISCOVERY THAT CNL IS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE LOSS OF SCENT DURING THE TRANSITION FROM OUT-CROSSING TO SELFING IN CAPSELLA (BRASSICACEAE) (SEE THE ACCOMPANYING PAPER) RAISES INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF DEEP EVOLUTIONARY CONSERVATION OF THE TARGETS OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE.",NA,REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION; FRAGRANCE CHEMISTRY; PETUNIA; BIOSYNTHESIS; ATTRACTION; EVOLUTION; VOLATILES; LOCI; TRAITS; ODOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,23,"KUHLEMEIER, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BERN, INST PLANT SCI, ALTENBERGRAIN 21, CH-3013 BERN, SWITZERLAND.;AMRAD, AVICHAI, MOSER, MICHEL, MANDEL, THERESE, KUHLEMEIER, CRIS, UNIV BERN, INST PLANT SCI, ALTENBERGRAIN 21, CH-3013 BERN, SWITZERLAND.;DE VRIES, MICHEL, SCHUURINK, ROBERT C., UNIV AMSTERDAM, SWAMMERDAM INST LIFE SCI, SCI PK 904, NL-1098 XH AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;FREITAS, LORETA, UNIV FED RIO GRANDE DO SUL, DEPT GENET, LAB MOL EVOLUT, POB 15053,AVE BENTO GONCALVES 9500, PORTO ALEGRE, RS, BRAZIL.",10.1016/J.CUB.2016.10.023,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",NA,SWISS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONSWISS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (SNSF) [17-429]; SYSTEMX.CH [36-792]; UNIVERSITY OF BERN,"WE THANK CHRISTOPHER BALL, JASMIN SEKULOVSKI, AND RAPHAELA LUDI FOR EXPERT CARE OF OUR PLANTS; MORITZ SAXENHOFER, ANNA FELLER, AND CHRISTOPH ZWAHLEN FOR HELP WITH GENOTYPING AND PHENOTYPING; ANA LUCIA SEGATTO AND CAROLINE TURCHETTO FOR FIELD COLLECTION AND DNA EXTRACTION; KORINNA ESFELD, HESTER SHEEHAN, AND SARAH ROBINSON FOR COMMENTS ON THE MANUSCRIPT; KORINNA ESFELD, HESTER SHEEHAN, DANIELE ROPPOLO, OZ BARAZANI, MATHIEU HANEMIAN, AND NATALIA DUDAREVA FOR ADVICE AND SUGGESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT; CLAUDIA SAS AND ALON CNA'ANI FOR HELP WITH THE TRANSIENT EXPRESSION ASSAY; PIERRE BARBIER DE REUILLE FOR STATISTICAL ADVICE; AND ROMAN KOPFLI AND NAAMA RONA AMRAD FOR ASSISTANCE WITH FIGURES.

HYMENOPT. RES.,"OSMIA PILICORNIS IS DISTRIBUTED FROM WESTERN TEMPERATE EUROPE TO WESTERN SIBERIA, WHERE IT EXCLUSIVELY OCCURS IN OPEN-STRUCTURED, MESOPHILOUS AND MAINLY DECIDUOUS WOODLAND BELOW 1000 M A.S.L. IN CENTRAL EUROPE, ITS PEAK ACTIVITY RANGES FROM THE LAST THIRD OF MARCH TO THE FIRST THIRD OF JUNE. DUE TO ITS RARITY AND ITS LOW POPULATION DENSITIES OVER MOST OF ITS RANGE, THE BIOLOGY OF O. PILICORNIS WAS ONLY FRAGMENTARILY KNOWN. THE DISCOVERY OF SIX NESTS IN THE COURSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY REVEALED THAT FEMALES OF O. PILICORNIS HAVE A UNIQUE NESTING BEHAVIOUR AMONG THE OSMIINE BEES: THEY GNAW THEIR NESTS IN DEAD WOOD WITH THE AID OF THEIR STRONG MANDIBLES, WHICH HAVE A PECULIAR CHISEL-LIKE SHAPE HYPOTHESIZED TO BE AN ADAPTATION TO THE SPECIES' SPECIALIZED NESTING BEHAVIOUR. ALL SIX NESTS WERE IN DEAD FALLEN BRANCHES OF DIFFERENT TREE AND SHRUB SPECIES AND OF VARYING WOOD HARDNESS. THE NESTING BRANCHES HAD A DIAMETER OF 1.5-6.1 CM, LAY ON SUN-EXPOSED GROUND AND WERE LARGELY HIDDEN UNDER VEGETATION. THE NESTS CONTAINED ONE TO THREE LINEARLY ARRANGED BROOD CELLS. BOTH CELL PARTITIONS AND NEST PLUG WERE BUILT FROM CHEWED LEAVES HARVESTED FROM FRAGARIA VESCA. OSMIA PILICORNIS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEW HOST OF THE CHRYSIDID WASP CHRYSURA HIRSUTA, AND THE ICHNEUMONID WASP HOPLOCRYPTUS CONFECTOR DEVELOPED IN ITS NESTS. MICROSCOPICAL ANALYSIS OF SCOPAL POLLEN LOADS OF COLLECTED FEMALES REVEALED THAT POLLEN IS MAINLY COLLECTED FROM THREE PLANT TAXA, I.E. PULMONARIA (BORAGINACEAE), FABACEAE (E.G. LATHYRUS, VICIA) AND LAMIACEAE (E.G. AJUGA, GLECHOMA). ON FLOWERS OF PULMONARIA, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLEN HOST OVER MOST OF THE SPECIES' RANGE, THE FEMALES USE SPECIALIZED BRISTLES ON THEIR PROBOSCIS TO BRUSH POLLEN OUT OF THE NARROW COROLLA TUBE, THEY ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY EXPLOIT POLLEN-RICH FLOWERS IN THE EARLY RED STAGE AND THEY OFTEN STEAL POLLEN FROM STILL CLOSED FLOWERS BY FORCEFULLY OPENING BUDS. ON THEIR SEARCH FOR FEMALES, MALES OF O. PILICORNIS PATROL FLOWERS OF PULMONARIA IN A RAPID FLIGHT REGULARLY INTERRUPTED BY SHORT RESTING PERIODS ON THE GROUND. FEMALES ARE GRASPED FOR COPULATION BOTH DURING FLOWER VISITS AND IN FLIGHT BETWEEN THE FLOWERS. THE WIDE SPECTRUM OF SEMI-OPEN MESOPHILOUS WOODLAND TYPES COLONIZED BY O. PILICORNIS SUGGESTS THAT DEAD FALLEN BRANCHES AND A RICH SPRING FLORA IN COMBINATION WITH A RATHER WARM BUT NOT XERIC MICROCLIMATE ARE THE ONLY REQUISITES NEEDED BY THE SPECIES. AS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WOODLAND HABITATS CURRENTLY OCCUPIED BY O. PILICORNIS IN CENTRAL EUROPE OWE THEIR ORIGIN TO HUMAN FOREST USE, THE RECENT DECLINE OF O. PILICORNIS IN MANY REGIONS OF EUROPE MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY CHANGES IN WOODLAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES LEADING TO CLOSED AND DARK FORESTS NOT SUITABLE AS HABITATS FOR THIS SPECIALIZED BEE SPECIES.",APIFORMES; CHRYSURA HIRSUTA; DEAD WOOD; HOPLOCRYPTUS CONFECTOR; PULMONARIA; NESTING BEHAVIOUR; OPEN-STRUCTURED WOODLAND,FLORAL COLOR-CHANGE; MORPHOLOGICAL SPECIALIZATIONS; POLLEN; APOIDEA; BORAGINACEAE; FLOWERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"MULLER, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;PROSI, RAINER, LERCHENSTR 81, D-74564 CRAILSHEIM, GERMANY.;WIESBAUER, HEINZ, KAUNITZGASSE 33-14, A-1060 VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;MUELLER, ANDREAS, SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.",10.3897/JHR.52.10441,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",NA,NA,NA,1070-9428,NA,1-36,PENSOFT PUBL,52,2016,ISI000387755500001,80,ENTOMOLOGY,7,ENTOMOLOGY,ANDREAS.MUELLERUSYS.ETHZ.CH,EB9YY,"MULLER, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, INST AGR SCI BIOCOMMUN \& ENTOMOL, SCHMELZBERGSTR 9-LFO, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",ISI,none,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,NOTDECLARED,NA,"PROSI R, 2016, J HYMENOPT RES","PROSI R, 2016, J HYMENOPT RES",NA,NA,NA,NA

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.,"BODY SIZE IS AN IMPORTANT PHENOTYPIC TRAIT THAT CORRELATES WITH PERFORMANCE AND FITNESS. FOR DETERMINATE GROWING INSECTS, BODY SIZE VARIATION IS DETERMINED BY GROWTH RATE AND THE MECHANISMS THAT STOP GROWTH AT THE END OF JUVENILE GROWTH. ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS REGULATE GROWTH CESSATION, AND THEIR RELATIVE TIMING ALONG DEVELOPMENT SHAPES PHENOTYPIC VARIATION IN BODY SIZE AND DEVELOPMENT TIME. LARVAL INSECTS ARE GENERALLY HYPOTHESIZED TO INITIATE METAMORPHOSIS ONCE THEY ATTAIN A CRITICAL WEIGHT. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE CRITICAL WEIGHT HAVE NOT BEEN RESOLVED EVEN FOR WELL-STUDIED INSECT SPECIES. MORE IMPORTANTLY, CRITICAL WEIGHTS MAY OR MAY NOT BE GENERALIZABLE ACROSS SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE CHARACTERIZED THE DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS OF SIZE REGULATION IN THE SOLITARY BEE, OSMIA LIGNARIA. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT STARVATION CUES METAMORPHOSIS IN O.

ALTHOUGH MOST CONSUMERS EXPRESS WILLINGNESS TO AID POLLINATORS, THE REASONS FOR CONSUMERS' PREFERENCES OR BARRIERS TO PURCHASING POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS AND THE TYPES OF POLLINATORS' THAT CONSUMERS ARE TRYING TO PROTECT ARE LESS UNDERSTOOD. USING AN ONLINE SURVEY OF 1200 CONNECTICUT (CT) CONSUMERS, OF WHICH 841 HAD HOME LANDSCAPES, WE FIND THAT 46\% OF CONSUMERS WITH HOME LANDSCAPES PURCHASED POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS TO THEIR LANDSCAPE. CONSISTENT WITH PAST RESEARCH THAT FOCUSED ON CONSUMERS' PREFERENCES FOR POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS, THE DATA ALSO REVEAL THAT SOME CONSUMERS ARE WILLING TO PAY PREMIUMS FOR PLANTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO POLLINATOR'S HEALTH. HOWEVER, ONLY 17\% STATED THAT ATTRACTING POLLINATORS WAS THEIR PRIMARY MOTIVATION, A FINDING THAT SUGGESTS LABELING ALONE WILL LIKELY NOT MOTIVATE CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE PLANTS. THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO PURCHASING POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS INCLUDED LACK OF LABELING (CITED BY 28\%), FOLLOWED BY HIGH PRICE (28\%). CONSUMERS PURCHASING POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS WERE TRYING TO ATTRACT BUTTERFLIES (LEPIDOPTERA) (78\%), BEES (APIDAE) (59\%), HUMMINGBIRDS (TROCHILIDAE) (59\%), AND OTHER BIRDS (41\%). WE ALSO FIND THAT DEMOGRAPHICS AND PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AFFECT BARRIERS AND TYPES OF POLLINATORS DESIRED. SIMPLY LABELING PLANTS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE PURCHASING, BUT INCREASING PRICE COULD BE DETRIMENTAL AS MANY CONSUMERS FEEL POLLINATOR-FRIENDLY PLANTS ARE HIGHLY PRICED.

THE FLORAL CHANGES IN THESE SPECIES INCLUDE ALTERED PETAL ORIENTATION, SHAPE AND TEXTURE. IN LOTUS THESE CHARACTERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DORSIVENTRAL PETAL IDENTITY, SUGGESTING THAT SHIFTS IN THE EXPRESSION OF DORSAL IDENTITY GENES MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE EVOLUTION OF BIRD POLLINATION. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS LOTUS JAPONICUS CYCLOIDEA 2 (LJCYC2), KNOWN TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ON THE DORSAL PETAL IN L.JAPONICUS. BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES ARE UNUSUAL IN NOT HAVING PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ON THE DORSAL PETAL. USING RT-PCR AT VARIOUS STAGES OF FLOWER DEVELOPMENT, WE DETERMINED THE TIMING OF EXPRESSION IN ALL PETAL TYPES FOR THE THREE PUTATIVE PETAL IDENTITY GENES (CYC-LIKE GENES) IN DIFFERENT SPECIES WITH CONTRASTING FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND POLLINATION SYNDROMES. IN BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES THE DORSAL IDENTITY GENE, LJCYC2, IS NOT EXPRESSED AT THE FLORAL STAGE WHEN PAPILLATE CONICAL CELLS ARE NORMALLY DIFFERENTIATING IN BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES. IN CONTRAST, IN BEE-POLLINATED SPECIES, LJCYC2 IS EXPRESSED DURING CONICAL CELL DEVELOPMENT. CHANGES IN THE TIMING OF EXPRESSION OF THE ABOVE TWO GENES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MODIFICATIONS IN PETAL GROWTH AND LATERALISATION OF THE DORSAL AND VENTRAL PETALS IN THE BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES.

BERTONI HAS SPOROPHYTIC SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY AND THIS MAY LEAD TO POOR SEED YIELD AND QUALITY, WHICH ARE OBSTACLES TO LARGE-SCALE CROP ESTABLISHMENT. THIS RESEARCH INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF INSECT POLLINATORS AND THE HARVESTING TIME ON THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RIPE SEEDS. A POT TRIAL UNDER OPEN FIELD CONDITIONS WAS ESTABLISHED TO EVALUATE THE ABUNDANCE OF INSECT POLLINATORS AND THREE HARVESTING TIMES ON THE PRODUCTION OF RIPE SEEDS, GERMINATION PERCENTAGE, MEAN GERMINATION TIME AND THOUSAND SEED WEIGHT (TSW) IN 36 F1 OPEN-POLLINATED GENOTYPES. LARGE VARIABILITY IN THE NUMBER OF CORYMBS OF CAPITULA, FLOWERING TIME, REPRODUCTIVE PERIOD AND SEED YIELD WAS OBSERVED AMONG THE GENOTYPES. GENOTYPES WITH PROMISING PHENOLOGICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE PROPERTIES WERE IDENTIFIED. THE WORST GERMINATION PERCENTAGE AND TSW WERE RECORDED IN THE LATEST HARVEST. SIGNIFICANT LINEAR REGRESSIONS WERE FOUND AMONG THE INVESTIGATED PARAMETERS (INSECT NUMBER, GERMINATION PERCENTAGE, TSW, SEEDS YIELD PER PLANT AND CYCLE LENGTH), CONFIRMING COMPLEX INTERACTIONS ON THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF STEVIA SEEDS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT EARLIER FLOWERING GENOTYPES PRODUCED HIGHER SEED QUANTITY, DUE TO FAVOURABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE PHASE.

CONSEQUENTLY, APPROACHES HAVE EMERGED THAT AIM TO RESTORE POLLINATOR HABITAT IN MANAGED LANDSCAPES. A WIDELY ADOPTED TECHNIQUE IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA IS THE PLANTING OF FLOWERING SHRUBS AND FORBS ALONG FIELD EDGES. THESE HABITATS USUALLY INCLUDE A VARIETY OF SPECIES, CHOSEN BECAUSE THEY ARE ATTRACTIVE TO POLLINATORS AND BECAUSE THEY FLOWER CONTINUOUSLY OVER THOSE POLLINATORS' FLIGHT SEASONS. BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY POTENTIAL PLANT SPECIES WITH DIFFERENT FLOWERING TIMES AND POLLINATOR PREFERENCES, SELECTING A SUBSET IS CHALLENGING.

IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE ENTIRE ANGIOSPERM FLORA OF THE ALPS WITH REGARD TO VISUALLY DISPLAYED POLLEN AND FLORAL GUIDES. ALL SPECIES WERE CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF POLLEN- AND STAMEN-IMITATING STRUCTURES USING COLOUR PHOTOGRAPHS. MOST FLOWERING PLANTS OF THE ALPS DISPLAY YELLOW POLLEN AND AT LEAST 28\% OF THE SPECIES DISPLAY POLLEN- OR STAMEN-IMITATING STRUCTURES. THE MOST FREQUENT TYPES OF POLLEN AND STAMEN IMITATIONS WERE (MOSTLY YELLOW AND UV-ABSORBING) COLOUR PATCHES ON PETALS (65\% OF SPECIES DISPLAYING IMITATIONS), PATTERNS OF INFLORESCENCES (18\%), STAMEN-LIKE PISTILS (10\%), AND STAMINODES (6\%), AS WELL AS THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES SUCH AS CONVEX LOWER LIPS AND FILAMENTAL HAIRS (< 5\%).

MODEL.,"PRODUCTION OF INSECT-POLLINATED CROPS TYPICALLY RELIES ON BOTH PESTICIDE USE AND POLLINATION, LEADING TO A POTENTIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TWO INPUTS. IN THIS PAPER WE COMBINE ECOLOGICAL MODELLING WITH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDE USE ON WILD AND COMMERCIAL BEES, WHILST ALLOWING FARMERS TO PARTLY OFFSET THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON BEE POPULATIONS BY CREATING MORE ON-FARM BEE HABITAT. FARMERS HAVE INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN CREATING WILD BEE HABITAT TO INCREASE POLLINATION INPUTS DUE TO THE CONTRIBUTION THIS MAKES TO YIELDS. HOWEVER, THE OPTIMAL ALLOCATION OF ON-FARM HABITAT STRONGLY DEPENDS ON THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES, WITH A THRESHOLD-LIKE BEHAVIOUR AT A CRITICAL LEVEL OF THE IMPAIRMENT. WHEN THIS THRESHOLD IS CROSSED, THE POPULATION OF WILD BEES BECOMES LOCALLY EXTINCT AND THEIR AVAILABILITY TO POLLINATE BREAKS DOWN. WE SHOW THAT AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL BEES MASKS THIS DECREASE IN POLLINATION SERVICES WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE INCENTIVISE FARMERS TO CONSERVE THE WILD POLLINATOR POPULATION. INDEED, IF COMMERCIAL BEES ARE AVAILABLE, OPTIMUM PROFIT MAY BE ACHIEVED BY PROVIDING NO HABITAT AT ALL FOR WILD BEES, AND ALLOWING THESE WILD POLLINATORS TO GO EXTINCT. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.

RES.,"POLLINATORS SUCH AS BEES AND HOVERFLIES ARE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF AN URBAN ECOSYSTEM, SUPPORTING AND CONTRIBUTING TO THE BIODIVERSITY, FUNCTIONING, RESILIENCE AND VISUAL AMENITY OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THEIR URBAN HABITATS ALSO DELIVER HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BENEFITS TO SOCIETY, BY PROVIDING IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACCESSING NATURE NEARBY TO THE HOMES OF A GROWING MAJORITY OF PEOPLE LIVING IN TOWNS AND CITIES. HOWEVER, MANY POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE IN DECLINE, AND THE LOSS, DEGRADATION AND FRAGMENTATION OF NATURAL HABITATS ARE SOME OF THE KEY DRIVERS OF THIS CHANGE. URBAN PLANNERS AND OTHER PRACTITIONERS NEED EVIDENCE TO CAREFULLY PRIORITISE WHERE THEY FOCUS THEIR RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN A HIGH QUALITY, MULTIFUNCTIONAL GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK THAT SUPPORTS POLLINATORS AND PEOPLE. WE PROVIDE A MODELLING FRAMEWORK TO INFORM GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE PLANNING AS A NATURE BASED SOLUTION WITH SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL BENEFITS. WE SHOW HOW HABITAT SUITABILITY MODELS (I-ISM) INCORPORATING REMOTE SENSED VEGETATION DATA CAN PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION ON THE INFLUENCE OF URBAN LANDCOVER COMPOSITION AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION ON SPECIES DISTRIBUTIONS ACROSS CITIES. USING EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND, AS A CASE STUDY CITY, WE DEMONSTRATE THIS APPROACH FOR BUMBLE BEES AND HOVERFLIES, PROVIDING HIGH RESOLUTION PREDICTIVE MAPS THAT IDENTIFY POLLINATOR HABITAT HOTSPOTS AND PINCH POINTS ACROSS THE CITY. BY COMBINING THIS SPATIAL HSM OUTPUT WITH HEALTH DEPRIVATION DATA, WE HIGHLIGHT `WIN-WIN' OPPORTUNITY AREAS IN MOST NEED OF IMPROVED GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT POLLINATOR HABITAT QUALITY AND CONNECTIVITY, AS WELL AS SOCIETAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. IN ADDITION, IN COLLABORATION WITH MUNICIPAL PLANNERS, LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS, AND PARTNERS FROM A LOCAL GREENSPACE LEARNING ALLIANCE, WE IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE INTEREST IN WILDLIFE GARDENING AS PART OF A `POLLINATOR PLEDGE'.

DIVERS.,"BACKGROUND: THE ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS ON INFLORESCENCES IS IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING THE MOVEMENT OF POLLINATORS WITHIN THE INFLORESCENCE AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE OVERALL MATING SUCCESS AND FRUIT SET OF A PLANT. AIMS: SPIRANTHES SPIRALIS IS AN ORCHID THAT HAS A SPIRALLED INFLORESCENCE. THE SPECIES HAS TWO CHIRAL FORMS THAT SHOW OPPOSITE COILING DIRECTIONS (CLOCKWISE AND ANTI-CLOCKWISE). WE TESTED IF THIS ARRANGEMENT OF INFLORESCENCE INFLUENCES POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND BEHAVIOUR. METHODS: WE SURVEYED TWO NATURAL POPULATIONS, ANALYSED THE REPRODUCTIVE COMPATIBILITY OF THE TWO MORPHS AND ESTIMATED POLLINATION SUCCESS IN NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT THE TWO MORPHS WERE NOT ISOLATED BY PRE- OR POST-MATING BARRIERS, OCCURRED WITH A SIMILAR PROPORTION IN NATURAL POPULATIONS AND SHOWED SIMILAR LEVELS OF POLLINATION SUCCESS BOTH IN NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, WE FOUND A DIFFERENT PATTERN OF POLLINATION SUCCESS ALONG THE INFLORESCENCES. IN THE TWO MORPHS, LOWER FLOWERS EXPERIENCED A HIGHER POLLINATION RATE AND THIS RATE DECREASED ALONG THE INFLORESCENCE FASTER IN ANTI-CLOCKWISE THAN IN CLOCKWISE INDIVIDUALS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT POLLINATORS VISIT THE FLOWERS SEQUENTIALLY FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE INFLORESCENCES AND LEAVE THE ANTI-CLOCKWISE INDIVIDUALS MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE CLOCKWISE ONES.

APPL. ECOL.,"1. TRADITIONAL TROPICAL AGRICULTURE OFTEN ENTAILS A FORM OF SLASH-AND-BURN LAND MANAGEMENT THAT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS POLLINATION, WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL CROP YIELDS. THE YUCATAN PENINSULA OF MEXICO HAS A >4000YEAR HISTORY OF TRADITIONAL SLASH-AND-BURN AGRICULTURE, TERMED MILPA'. HOT HABANERO' CHILLI IS A MAJOR POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT CROP THAT NOWADAYS IS OFTEN GROWN IN MONOCULTURE WITHIN THE MILPA SYSTEM. 2. WE STUDIED 37 LOCAL FARMERS' CHILLI FIELDS (SITES) TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION ON BEE COMMUNITIES. AT 11 OF THESE SITES, WE UNDERTOOK EXPERIMENTAL POLLINATION TREATMENTS TO QUANTIFY THE POLLINATION OF CHILLI. WE FURTHER EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION, BEE COMMUNITIES AND POLLINATION SERVICE PROVISION TO CHILLI. 3. BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, PARTICULARLY SPECIES OF THE FAMILY APIDAE, WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF FOREST COVER. SPECIES DIVERSITY DECREASED WITH INCREASING PROPORTION OF CROP LAND SURROUNDING EACH SAMPLING SITE. SWEAT BEES OF THE GENUS LASIOGLOSSUM WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT BEE TAXON IN CHILLI FIELDS AND, IN CONTRAST TO OTHER BEE SPECIES, INCREASED IN ABUNDANCE WITH THE PROPORTION OF FALLOW LAND, GARDENS AND PASTURES WHICH ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE MILPA SYSTEM. 4. THERE WAS AN AVERAGE POLLINATION SHORTFALL OF 21\% FOR CHILLI ACROSS ALL SITES, YET THE SHORTFALL WAS UNRELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF LAND COVERED BY CROPS. RATHER, CHILLI POLLINATION WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE ABUNDANCE OF LASIOGLOSSUM BEES, PROBABLY AN IMPORTANT POLLINATOR OF CHILLI, AS WELL INDIRECTLY TO THE PROPORTION OF FALLOW LAND, GARDENS AND PASTURES THAT PROMOTE LASIOGLOSSUM ABUNDANCE. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. CURRENT, LOW-INTENSITY TRADITIONAL SLASH-AND-BURN (MILPA) AGRICULTURE PROVIDES LASIOGLOSSUM SPP.

MCCARY MA;MINOR E;WISE DH,MCCARY MA,COVARIATION BETWEEN LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS INFLUENCES THE STRUCTURE OF GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN FRAGMENTED METROPOLITAN WOODLANDS,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,LANDSC. ECOL.,"THE WORLD IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY URBANIZED, WITH MORE THAN HALF OF THE GLOBAL POPULATION NOW LIVING IN CITIES. UNDERSTANDING THE FACTORS IMPACTING NATURAL COMMUNITIES IN FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPES IS THEREFORE CRUCIAL FOR PREDICTING HOW THE REMAINING ECOSYSTEMS WILL RESPOND TO GLOBAL CHANGE. GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPODS, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT IN NUTRIENT CYCLING, ARE LIKELY SENSITIVE TO HABITAT CHANGES RESULTING FROM URBANIZATION. WE ADDRESSED TWO QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT IS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS IN SHAPING GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN URBAN WOODLANDS? (2) HOW DOES BODY SIZE (AS A SURROGATE FOR DISPERSAL ABILITY) AFFECT SENSITIVITY TO LANDSCAPE-LEVEL FACTORS? IN THE SUMMERS OF 2010 AND 2011, WE SAMPLED GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES IN 19 WOODLANDS IN THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN REGION USING PITFALL TRAPS. WE ALSO ASSESSED LOCAL PLANT AND SOIL CHARACTERISTICS, AS WELL AS LANDSCAPE-LEVEL VARIABLES USING GIS. REDUNDANCY ANALYSES AND VARIATION PARTITIONING REVEALED THAT LOCAL FACTORS, PARTICULARLY INVASIVE WOODY-PLANT COVER AND SOIL NITRATE, HAD THE MOST INFLUENCE ON ARTHROPOD COMMUNITIES, EXPLAINING 12\% OF THE TOTAL VARIATION. OF THE LANDSCAPE-LEVEL VARIABLES, LANDSCAPE RICHNESS, WHICH IS ONE MEASURE OF LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION, EXPLAINED THE MOST VARIATION, HOWEVER, THE SHARED VARIANCE BETWEEN LANDSCAPE AND LOCAL VARIABLES WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR HALF (16\%) OF THE TOTAL EXPLAINED VARIATION (32\%). LANDSCAPE FACTORS ALONE EXPLAINED ONLY 4\% OF VARIATION. NO RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARTHROPOD BODY SIZE AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES WAS OBSERVED, BUT SEVERAL GROUPS (E.G. ANTS AND GROUND BEETLES) WERE CORRELATED WITH LANDSCAPE-LEVEL FACTORS. OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT BOTH LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ARE IMPORTANT IN INFLUENCING GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPODS, BUT THE MAJORITY OF EXPLAINED VARIANCE IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE COVARIATION BETWEEN LANDSCAPE RICHNESS, INVASIVE WOODY-PLANT COVER, AND SOIL NITRATE. WE THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION IS LIKELY AFFECTING THE GROUND-ACTIVE ARTHROPODS THROUGH ITS POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON INVASIVE WOODY PLANTS AND SOIL NITROGEN.",ARTHROPODS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE-SCALE FACTORS; LOCAL FACTORS; URBANIZATION,WILD BEE POLLINATORS; URBAN-ENVIRONMENT; SPECIES RICHNESS; INVASIVE PLANTS; UNITED-STATES; BODY-SIZE; FOOD WEBS; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"MCCARY, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ENTOMOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.;MCCARY, MATTHEW A., MINOR, EMILY, WISE, DAVID H., UNIV ILLINOIS, DEPT BIOL SCI, CHICAGO, IL 60607 USA.;MCCARY, MATTHEW A., UNIV WISCONSIN, DEPT ENTOMOL, MADISON, WI 53706 USA.;MINOR, EMILY, WISE, DAVID H., UNIV ILLINOIS, INST ENVIRONM SCI \& POLICY, CHICAGO, IL 60612 USA.",10.1007/S10980-017-0593-9,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,GAYLORD AND DOROTHY DONNELLEY FOUNDATION,"WE THANK THE WISE LAB (NOLAN BIELINSKI, MONICA FARFAN, AMANDA HENDERSON, BROOK HERMAN, SUSAN KIRT ALTERIO, JOSE-CRISTIAN MARTINEZ, AND ROBIN MORES) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO (UIC) FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND CONCEPTUAL GUIDANCE.

BEES ARE AN ESSENTIAL POLLINATOR GROUP FOR FOREST PLANT POPULATIONS AND FOOD PRODUCTION IN TROPICAL LANDSCAPES. THEY ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON FORESTED ENVIRONMENTS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAINTAINING THEIR DIVERSITY AND POLLINATION SERVICES. WE ANALYSED BEE DIVERSITY IN FOREST PATCHES AND ADJACENT OPEN AREAS TO EVALUATE IF BEES CAN USE COMPLEMENTARY ENVIRONMENTS IN HETEROGENEOUS ALTERED TROPICAL LANDSCAPES. THE EFFECT OF LANDSCAPE LEVEL HETEROGENEITY AND FOREST AMOUNT ON BEE DIVERSITY WAS ALSO ASSESSED. OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT BEE COMMUNITIES WILL BE RICHER AND MORE DIVERSE IN HIGHLY FORESTED AND HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES WHEN COMPARED TO AREAS DOMINATED BY FEW HUMAN-MADE ENVIRONMENTS, BUT DUE TO SUPPLEMENTARY FORAGING BEHAVIORS, THEY WILL BE MORE ABUNDANT IN OPEN AREAS WHERE FLOWER AVAILABILITY IS HIGHER. WE ACTIVELY SAMPLED BEES VISITING FLOWERS WITHIN FOREST PATCHES AND IN SURROUNDING OPEN AREAS BETWEEN THE CANTAREIRA AND MANTIQUEIRA MOUNTAIN RANGES IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. WE FOUND BOTH HIGHER BEE RICHNESS AND DIVERSITY IN OPEN AREAS THAN IN FOREST PATCHES, PARTIALLY DENYING OUR INITIAL HYPOTHESIS BUT SUPPORTING THAT BEES ARE MORE ABUNDANT IN OPEN AREAS.

THIS STUDY TESTED HOW FIVE LOCAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES (BARE GROUND, NATIVE BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS, HOMESTEAD GARDENS, SHELTERBELTS, AND CONTROL AREAS OF PASTURE) AFFECT LOCAL POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES ON CANTERBURY FARMS. WE ALSO COMPARED TWO SAMPLING METHODS (FLOWER VISITATION TO NATIVE POTTED PLANTS VS STICKY TRAPS) TO DETERMINE IF THE SAMPLING METHOD AFFECTS THE RESULTS OF LANDSCAPE-FEATURE COMPARISONS. WE RECORDED 928 POLLINATORS OF 17 TAXA ON THE POTTED PLANTS AND 791 POLLINATORS OF 16 TAXA ON THE STICKY TRAPS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR ABUNDANCES BETWEEN THE LANDSCAPE FEATURES AND THE CONTROL AREAS. BOTH SAMPLING METHODS RECORDED FEWER POLLINATORS OVERALL AT SHELTERBELTS AND BARE GROUND SITES THAN CONTROL SITES, ALTHOUGH MORNING-EVENING FLY WAS MORE COMMON AT BARE GROUND SITES. HOWEVER, THE METHODS GAVE CONTRASTING RESULTS FOR BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS AND GARDENS: THE FLOWER METHOD RECORDED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE POLLINATORS IN BIODIVERSITY PLANTINGS AND GARDENS THAN IT DID AT CONTROL SITES, WHEREAS THE STICKY TRAP METHOD RECORDED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER.

FLOWER-DWELLING PREDATORS MAY INTERFERE IN PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS THROUGH CHANGES IN POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR, LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN POLLINATION SERVICES. ALTHOUGH THE CONTEXT-DEPENDENCY OF TRI-TROPHIC INTERACTIONS IS OFTEN ACKNOWLEDGED, THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF PREDATOR, POLLINATOR AND FLOWER TRAITS IN SHAPING POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR HAS BEEN RARELY STUDIED SIMULTANEOUSLY. 2. POLLINATORS' RESPONSES TO PREDATION RISK WERE EVALUATED USING ARTIFICIAL SPIDERS ON ALSTROEMERIA AUREA FLOWERS IN ORDER TO EXPERIMENTALLY TEST WHETHER PREDATOR TRAITS (COLOUR AND SIZE) AND NECTAR AVAILABILITY AFFECT THEIR BEHAVIOUR AND PLANT FITNESS. 3. REGARDING THE PREDATOR'S TRAITS, BOTH SIZES OF ARTIFICIAL SPIDERS USED WERE SIMILARLY REJECTED, BUT SPIDER COLOUR WAS DETECTED DIFFERENTLY. IN PARTICULAR, RED AND BLACK ARTIFICIAL SPIDERS WERE MORE STRONGLY REJECTED THAN THE REST. IN TURN, NECTAR AVAILABILITY INCREASED THE TIME SPENT IN THE INFLORESCENCES, YET MOST POLLINATORS REJECTED FLOWERS WITH ARTIFICIAL SPIDERS INDEPENDENTLY OF NECTAR AVAILABILITY. FURTHERMORE, RESPONSES TO ARTIFICIAL SPIDER COLOUR AND NECTAR AVAILABILITY VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN DIPTERANS AND HYMENOPTERANS. FINALLY, ARTIFICIAL SPIDERS REDUCED SEED SET AND FRUIT WEIGHT OF PLANTS OWING TO CHANGES IN THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE MOST EFFICIENT POLLINATORS. 4. IT WAS SHOWN THAT POORLY STUDIED PREDATOR TRAITS SUCH AS COLOUR AND SIZE MAY AFFECT POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR IN DIFFERENT WAYS AMONG TAXA. IN ADDITION, FEEDING NECESSITY IN A RICH-RESOURCE ENVIRONMENT WAS A WEAKER SELECTING FORCE THAN PREDATION RISK. HENCE, IT IS ARGUED HERE THAT TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN PREDATION AND FLOWER REWARD MAY ARISE DEPENDING ON PREDATOR DETECTION, RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLLINATOR AND PREDATOR SIZE, AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY IN THE ECOSYSTEM WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANT FITNESS.",ANTI-PREDATOR BEHAVIOUR; FORAGING BEHAVIOUR; NECTAR AVAILABILITY; PREDATION RISK; VISUAL CUES,FLOWER-DWELLING PREDATORS; CRAB-SPIDERS; COLOR-VISION; HOST-PLANT; BUMBLE BEE; CAMOUFLAGE; EVOLUTION; AMBUSH; ADVANTAGE; ABUNDANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"GAVINI, SS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL COMAHUE, CONICET, INIBIOMA, LAB ECOTONO, QUINTRAL 1250, SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE, RIO NEGRO, ARGENTINA.;GAVINI, SABRINA S., QUINTERO, CAROLINA, TADEY, MARIANA, UNIV NACL COMAHUE, CONICET, INIBIOMA, LAB ECOTONO, QUINTRAL 1250, SAN CARLOS DE BARILOCHE, RIO NEGRO, ARGENTINA.",10.1111/EEN.12659,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"BECA DE ESTIMULO A LAS VOCACIONES CIENTIFICAS, CONSEJO INTERUNIVERSITARIO NACIONAL","WE THANK MARCELO AIZEN AND TWO ANONYMOUS REVIEWERS FOR HELPFUL COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

PHYLOGENET. EVOL.,"THE LONGHORN BEE TRIBE EUCERINI (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE) IS A DIVERSE, WIDELY DISTRIBUTED GROUP OF SOLITARY BEES THAT INCLUDES IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF BOTH WILD AND AGRICULTURAL PLANTS. ABOUT HALF OF THE SPECIES IN THE TRIBE ARE CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THE GENUS EUCERA AND TO A FEW OTHER RELATED GENERA. IN THIS LARGE GENUS COMPLEX, COMPRISING CA. 390 SPECIES, THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN GENERA REMAIN AMBIGUOUS DUE TO MORPHOLOGICAL INTERGRADATION AMONG TAXA. USING CA. 6700 ALIGNED NUCLEOTIDE SITES FROM SIX GENE FRAGMENTS, 120 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS, AND MORE THAN 100 TAXA, WE PRESENT THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE MOLECULAR, MORPHOLOGICAL, AND COMBINED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES OF THE `EUCERA COMPLEX'. THE REVISED GENERIC CLASSIFICATION THAT WE PROPOSE IS CONGRUENT WITH OUR PHYLOGENY AND MAXIMIZES BOTH GENERIC STABILITY AND EASE OF IDENTIFICATION. UNDER THIS NEW CLASSIFICATION MOST GENERIC NAMES ARE SYNONYMIZED UNDER AN EXPANDED GENUS EUCERA. THUS, TETRALONIA, PEPONAPIS, XENOGLOSSA, CEMOLOBUS, AND SYNTRICHALONIA ARE REDUCED TO SUBGENERIC RANK WITHIN EUCERA, AND SYNHALONIA IS RETAINED AS A SUBGENUS OF EUCERA. XENOGLOSSODES IS REESTABLISHED AS A VALID SUBGENUS OF EUCERA WHILE TETRALONIELLA IS SYNONYMIZED WITH TETRALONIA AND CUBITALIA WITH EUCERA. IN CONTRAST, WE SUGGEST THAT THE VENUSTA-GROUP OF SPECIES, CURRENTLY PLACED IN THE SUBGENUS SYNHALONIA, SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A NEW GENUS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE NEED TO EVALUATE CONVERGENT LOSS OR GAIN OF IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC TRAITS TO MINIMIZE THE USE OF POTENTIALLY HOMOPLASIOUS CHARACTERS WHEN ESTABLISHING CLASSIFICATIONS. LASTLY, WE SHOW THAT THE EUCERA COMPLEX ORIGINATED IN THE NEARCTIC REGION IN THE LATE OLIGOCENE, AND DISPERSED TWICE INTO THE OLD WORLD. THE FIRST DISPERSAL EVENT LIKELY OCCURRED 24.2-16.6 MYA AT A BASE OF A CLADE OF SUMMER-ACTIVE BEES RESTRICTED TO WARM REGION OF THE OLD WORLD, AND THE SECOND 13.9-12.3 MYA AT THE BASE OF A CLADE OF SPRING-ACTIVE BEES FOUND IN COOLER REGIONS OF THE HOLARCTIC.

IN THIS PAPER WE DEVELOP A MECHANISTIC MODEL TO INVESTIGATE UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN FORAGING EFFICIENCY AND TRAVEL COSTS CAN ALLOW TWO CENTRAL PLACE FORAGING SPECIES TO COEXIST IN SPITE OF CONSIDERABLE OVERLAP IN RESOURCE USE. ONE SPECIES (FLYER) HAS A HIGH BASAL METABOLIC RATE, BUT A LOW RELATIVE COST OF TRAVELLING SUCH THAT IT CAN USE PATCHES AT A GREATER DISTANCE FROM ITS CENTRAL PLACE WHILE THE MINIMUM PATCH QUALITY IT CAN ECONOMICALLY USE IS HIGH. THE OTHER SPECIES (FORAGER), BY CONTRAST, HAS A LOWER BASAL METABOLIC RATE, BUT HIGHER RELATIVE COST OF TRAVELLING, AND CAN THEREFORE BE A MORE EFFICIENT FORAGER AND ABLE TO USE FORAGING PATCHES OF LOW QUALITY, AS LONG AS THEY ARE NOT TOO FAR FROM THE NEST.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FORESTS AND ADJACENT OPEN HABITATS WITH DIFFERENT DISTURBANCE REGIMES. WE ALSO INVESTIGATED A POTENTIAL CASCADING EFFECT FROM PLANTS TO POLLINATORS AND WHETHER EDGE STRUCTURE AND LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION MEDIATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EDGE CONTRAST AND BETA DIVERSITY OF POLLINATORS. WE SAMPLED 51 LOW-CONTRAST EDGES WHERE FORESTS WERE ADJACENT TO HABITATS SHOWING LOW LEVELS OF DISTURBANCE (I.E. GREY DUNES, MOWED FIRE-BREAKS, ORCHARDS, GRASSLANDS) AND 29 HIGH-CONTRAST EDGES WHERE FORESTS WERE ADJACENT TO MORE INTENSIVELY DISTURBED HABITATS (I.E. TILLED FIREBREAKS, OILSEED RAPE) IN THREE REGIONS OF FRANCE. WE SHOWED THAT PLANT DIVERSITIES WERE HIGHER IN EDGES THAN IN ADJACENT OPEN HABITAT, WHATEVER THE EDGE CONTRAST. HOWEVER, PLANT BETA DIVERSITY DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN LOW AND HIGH-CONTRAST EDGES. WHILE WE OBSERVED HIGHER POLLINATOR DIVERSITIES IN ADJACENT HABITATS THAN IN LOW-CONTRAST EDGES, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POLLINATOR BETA DIVERSITY DEPENDING ON EDGE CONTRAST. WE DID NOT OBSERVE A CASCADING EFFECT FROM PLANTS TO POLLINATORS.

HOVERFLIES CARRIED POLLEN FROM 59 PLANT TAXA, SUGGESTING THEY VISIT A WIDER NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES THAN PREVIOUSLY APPRECIATED.

IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOP A NEW INDIVIDUAL-TRAIT BASED APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL PLANT AND POLLINATOR FUNCTIONAL SIZE TRAITS (POLLINATOR THORAX WIDTH AND PLANT NECTAR HOLDER DEPTH) IN MUTUALISTIC NETWORKS. WE PERFORMED HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSES TO GROUP INTERACTING INDIVIDUALS INTO CLASSES, ACCORDING TO THEIR SIMILARITY IN FUNCTIONAL SIZE.

COLGAN TJ;FINLAY S;BROWN MJF;CAROLAN JC,COLGAN TJ,MATING PRECEDES SELECTIVE IMMUNE PRIMING WHICH IS MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT BUMBLEBEE QUEEN DIAPAUSE,BMC GENOMICS,BMC GENOMICS,"BACKGROUND: UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH ORGANISMS ADAPT TO UNFAVOURABLE CONDITIONS IS A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY. ONE SUCH MECHANISM IS DIAPAUSE, A PERIOD OF DORMANCY TYPICALLY FOUND IN NEMATODES, FISH, CRUSTACEANS AND INSECTS. THIS STATE IS A KEY LIFE-HISTORY EVENT CHARACTERISED BY ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, SUPPRESSED METABOLISM AND INCREASED STRESS TOLERANCE AND ALLOWS AN ORGANISM TO AVOID PROLONGED PERIODS OF HARSH AND INHOSPITABLE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. FOR SOME SPECIES, DIAPAUSE IS PRECEDED BY MATING WHICH CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON FEMALE BEHAVIOUR, PHYSIOLOGY AND KEY BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES, INCLUDING IMMUNITY. HOWEVER, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MATING IMPACTS LONG-TERM IMMUNITY AND WHETHER THESE EFFECTS PERSIST THROUGHOUT DIAPAUSE IS CURRENTLY LIMITED. TO ADDRESS THIS, WE EXPLORED MOLECULAR CHANGES IN THE HAEMOLYMPH OF THE ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATOR, THE BUFF-TAILED BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. B. TERRESTRIS QUEENS MATE PRIOR TO ENTERING DIAPAUSE, A NON-FEEDING PERIOD OF ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT THAT CAN LAST 6-9 MONTHS. USING MASS-SPECTROMETRY-BASED PROTEOMICS, WE QUANTIFIED CHANGES IN THE PRE-DIAPAUSE QUEEN HAEMOLYMPH AFTER MATING, AS WELL AS THE SUBSEQUENT PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF MATED QUEENS DURING AND POST-DIAPAUSE. RESULTS: OUR ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED DISTINCT PROTEOME PROFILES ASSOCIATED WITH DIAPAUSE PREPARATION, MAINTENANCE AND TERMINATION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, MATING PRE-DIAPAUSE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASE IN THE ABUNDANCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES, KEY EFFECTORS OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. FURTHERMORE, WE IDENTIFIED THE ELEVATED ABUNDANCE OF THESE PROTEINS TO BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT DIAPAUSE. THIS FINDING WAS IN CONTRAST TO THE GENERAL REDUCTION OBSERVED IN IMMUNE PROTEINS DURING DIAPAUSE SUGGESTIVE OF SELECTIVE IMMUNE PRIMING AND EXPRESSION DURING DIAPAUSE. DIAPAUSE ALSO AFFECTED THE EXPRESSION OF PROTEINS INVOLVED IN CUTICULAR MAINTENANCE, OLFACTION, AS WELL AS PROTEINS OF UNKNOWN FUNCTION, WHICH MAY HAVE ROLES IN DIAPAUSE REGULATION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS PROVIDE CLEAR MOLECULAR EVIDENCE FOR THE CONSEQUENCES AND BENEFITS OF MATING AT THE IMMUNE LEVEL AS IT PRECEDES THE SELECTIVE INCREASED ABUNDANCE OF ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES THAT ARE SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT DIAPAUSE. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH BUMBLEBEES PREPARE FOR, SURVIVE, AND RECOVER FROM DIAPAUSE, INSIGHTS THAT MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THESE PROCESSES IN OTHER INSECT GROUPS.",DIAPAUSE; IMMUNITY; MATING; MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED PROTEOMICS; BUMBLEBEES; POLLINATOR HEALTH,ODORANT-BINDING PROTEINS; JUVENILE-HORMONE; REPRODUCTIVE DIAPAUSE; HEMOLYMPH PROTEOME; ACCESSORY-GLAND; ADULT DIAPAUSE; LIFE-HISTORY; TRADE-OFFS; DROSOPHILA; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"COLGAN, TJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV COLL CORK, SCH BIOL EARTH \& ENVIRONM SCI, CORK, CORK, IRELAND.;COLGAN, TJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), QUEEN MARY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL \& CHEM SCI, MILE END RD, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND.;COLGAN, THOMAS J., UNIV COLL CORK, SCH BIOL EARTH \& ENVIRONM SCI, CORK, CORK, IRELAND.;COLGAN, THOMAS J., QUEEN MARY UNIV LONDON, SCH BIOL \& CHEM SCI, MILE END RD, LONDON E1 4NS, ENGLAND.;FINLAY, SIVE, TRINITY COLL DUBLIN, SCH NAT SCI, DEPT ZOOL, DUBLIN 2, IRELAND.;BROWN, MARK J.

APPL. ENTOMOL.,"EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF NATIVE BEE POPULATIONS REQUIRES ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF POPULATION SIZE AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE AMONG HABITATS. CURRENT BEE SURVEY METHODS, SUCH AS NETTING OR PAN TRAPPING, MAY BE ADEQUATE FOR A VARIETY OF STUDY OBJECTIVES BUT ARE LIMITED BY A FAILURE TO ACCOUNT FOR IMPERFECT DETECTION. BIASES DUE TO IMPERFECT DETECTION COULD RESULT IN INACCURATE ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES OR ERRONEOUS INSIGHTS ABOUT THE RESPONSE OF BEES TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS. TO GAUGE THE POTENTIAL BIASES OF CURRENTLY EMPLOYED SURVEY METHODS, WE COMPARED ABUNDANCE ESTIMATES OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.) DERIVED FROM HIERARCHICAL DISTANCE SAMPLING MODELS (HDS) TO BUMBLEBEE COUNTS COLLECTED FROM FIXED-AREA NET SURVEYS (NET COUNTS) AND FIXED-WIDTH TRANSECT COUNTS (TRANSECT COUNTS) AT 47 EARLY-SUCCESSIONAL FOREST PATCHES IN PENNSYLVANIA. OUR HDS MODELS INDICATED THAT DETECTION PROBABILITIES OF BOMBUS SPP. WERE IMPERFECT AND VARIED WITH SURVEY- AND SITE-COVARIATES. DESPITE BEING CONSPICUOUS, BOMBUS SPP. WERE NOT RELIABLY DETECTED BEYOND 5 M. HABITAT ASSOCIATIONS OF BOMBUS SPP. DENSITY WERE SIMILAR ACROSS METHODS, BUT THE STRENGTH OF ASSOCIATION WITH SHRUB COVER DIFFERED BETWEEN HDS AND NET COUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, NET COUNTS SUGGESTED SITES WITH MORE GRASS HOSTED HIGHER BOMBUS SPP. DENSITIES WHEREAS HDS SUGGESTED THAT GRASS COVER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER DETECTION PROBABILITY BUT NOT BOMBUS SPP. DENSITY. DENSITY ESTIMATES GENERATED FROM NET COUNTS AND TRANSECT COUNTS WERE 80\%-89\% LOWER THAN ESTIMATES GENERATED FROM DISTANCE SAMPLING. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT DISTANCE MODELLING PROVIDES A RELIABLE METHOD TO ASSESS BOMBUS SPP.

HOWEVER, DETECTION/NON-DETECTION DATA COLLECTED VIA POINT-COUNTS, LINE-TRANSECTS AND DISTANCE SAMPLING FOR BOMBUS SPP.

SIMILARLY, TROPHIC LEVELS MIGHT HAVE UNCOUPLED RESPONSES TO THE SAME DISTURBANCE, THUS AMELIORATING OR AGGRAVATING THE PERSISTENCE OF ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYSED HOW THE DENSITY, RICHNESS AND EVENNESS OF FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS RESPOND TO FOUR LEVELS OF WOODLAND THINNING INTENSITY (0, 30, 50 AND 70\% OF WOODLAND BASAL AREA REMOVED) OVER 2 YEARS IN THREE CONTRASTING SITES. WE FOUND A MISMATCH IN THE RESPONSE OF FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS TO THINNING. FLOWER DENSITY AND RICHNESS HAD DISPARATE RESPONSES, DEPENDING ON THE SITE AND YEAR, WHILE EVENNESS DID NOT CHANGE WITH THINNING.

ECOL.,"CHEMOSENSORY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS IS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF TERRESTRIAL BIODIVERSITY, GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF OLFACTION TO FORAGING ANIMALS. IN THIS RESPECT, EXPLORING CHEMICALLY MEDIATED INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS IN NATURAL ASSEMBLIES MAY PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE ECOFUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) FOR PLANT-INSECT CO-EVOLUTION. HOWEVER, MULTISPECIES DATASETS OF ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PLANT SEMIOCHEMICALS AND ARTHROPODS ARE STILL VERY RARE AND TEND TO LACK COMMUNITY CONTEXT. HERE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST INSECT-FLORAL VOC META-NETWORK USING PLANT-POLLINATOR VISITATION DATA AND THE PLANTS' FLORAL SCENT BLENDS, COLLECTED IN A MEDITERRANEAN SCRUBLAND. WE ASSEMBLED THE INSECT-VOC META-NETWORK BY SUBSTITUTING EACH PLANT SPECIES IN THE PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORK WITH THE BLEND OF VOCS IT EMITS. FURTHERMORE, WE IDENTIFIED THE MODULES OF THE NETWORK THAT IS THE MOST DENSELY CONNECTED INSECT-VOC GROUPS. AFTER DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF THE SPECIES IN THE NETWORK, WE FOCUSED ON THE BEES OF THE COMMUNITY, AND BY BUILDING PHYLOGENETICALLY INFORMED GLS MODELS, WE FOUND THE SPECIES TRAITS PREDICTING THE DEGREE OF CHEMICAL SPECIALIZATION. MODULARITY ANALYSIS OF THE META-NETWORK REVEALED TIGHT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SEVERAL CLASSES OF VOCS AND POLLINATOR GROUPS. LINKAGE PATTERNS SUGGEST POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN (A) MEGACHILIDAE BEES AND SESQUITERPENES, (B) APIDAE AND ANDRENIDAE BEES AND BENZENOIDS/PHENYLPROPANOIDS, AND (C) WASPS, C6 GREEN-LEAF VOLATILES AND SPECIFIC TERPENOIDS. BENZENOIDS WERE FOUND TO BE THE LEAST INFLUENTIAL AND MOST SPECIALIZED CHEMICAL CLASS IN THE COMMUNITY, WHEREAS SESQUITERPENES REPRESENTED THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ONE. FURTHERMORE, THE DEGREE OF CHEMICAL GENERALIZATION OF THE BEES IN THE META-NETWORK WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR ECOLOGICAL GENERALIZATION, BODY MASS AND PHENOLOGY, WHEREAS THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE NETWORK'S STRUCTURE WAS RELATED TO THEIR LEVEL OF SOCIALITY. SYNTHESIS. OUR FINDINGS HELP TO DISCLOSE THE ECOFUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FLORAL VOLATILE LANDSCAPE AND CONTRIBUTE NOVEL TESTABLE HYPOTHESES ON THE BEHAVIOURAL TRENDS AND CHEMICAL NICHES OF POLLINATORS IN A NATURAL COMMUNITY. THE INSECT-VOLATILOME META-NETWORK IS THUS SHOWN TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR DETECTING AND VISUALIZING PATTERNS OF CHEMICALLY MEDIATED INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS.

BEES MAY ENCOUNTER TOXICANTS SUCH AS CADMIUM AND SELENATE BY FORAGING ON PLANTS GROWING IN CONTAMINATED AREAS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS. HONEY BEES ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A SIMPLE AND CONSISTENT MICROBIOME THAT CONVEYS MANY BENEFITS TO THE HOST, AND TOXICANT EXPOSURE MAY IMPACT THIS SYMBIOTIC MICROBIAL COMMUNITY. WE USED 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCING TO ASSAY THE EFFECTS THAT SUBLETHAL CADMIUM AND SELENATE TREATMENTS HAD OVER 7 DAYS AND FOUND THAT BOTH TREATMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY BUT SUBTLY ALTERED THE COMPOSITION OF THE BEE MICROBIOME. NEXT, WE EXPOSED BEES TO CADMIUM AND SELENATE AND THEN USED UNTARGETED LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY (LC-MS) METABOLOMICS TO SHOW THAT CHEMICAL EXPOSURE CHANGED THE BEES' METABOLITE PROFILES AND THAT COMPOUNDS WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED IN DETOXIFICATION, PROTEOLYSIS, AND LIPOLYSIS WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN TREATMENTS. FINALLY, WE EXPOSED SEVERAL STRAINS OF BEE-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA IN LIQUID CULTURE AND FOUND THAT EACH STRAIN REMOVED CADMIUM FROM ITS MEDIUM BUT THAT ONLY LACTOBACILLUS FIRM-5 MICROBES ASSIMILATED SELENATE, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE MICROBES MAY REDUCE THE METAL AND METALLOID BURDEN ON THEIR HOST. OVERALL, OUR REPORT SHOWS THAT METAL AND METALLOID EXPOSURE CAN AFFECT THE HONEY BEE MICROBIOME AND METABOLOME AND THAT STRAINS OF BEE-ASSOCIATED BACTERIA CAN BIOACCUMULATE THESE TOXICANTS.

IRISANENSIS WERE CONSTRUCTED USING 19 UNIQUE OCCURRENCE RECORDS AND 11 BIOCLIMATIC VARIABLES TO ESTIMATE HS IN THE PHILIPPINES. OUR SDMS ESTIMATED THAT MINIMUM HS FOR B. FLAVESCENS AND B. IRISANENSIS COVERS 28,066 AND 24,603 KM(2) OF THE 114 PROTECTED LAND PARCELS IN THE PHILIPPINES, RESPECTIVELY. ACROSS UNPROTECTED AREAS, OUR SDMS ESTIMATED THAT MINIMUM HS FOR B. FLAVESCENS AND B. IRISANENSIS COVERS 146,063 AND 156,674 KM(2), RESPECTIVELY. AS PREDICTED, HIGH-ELEVATION HABITATS HAVE THE HIGHEST HS RELATIVE TO LOW-ELEVATION HABITATS (R=0.61, P=0.003). WHILE OUR SDMS PREDICTS AN EXTENSIVE DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH SPECIES ACROSS BOTH PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED AREAS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT NEARLY 80\% OF THE PHILIPPINES IS DEFORESTED. OUR STUDY IDENTIFIES HIGH-ELEVATION PROTECTED AREAS AS PLACES WHERE BUMBLE BEES MAY STILL THRIVE, AND SURVEY EFFORT SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED TO THESE PLACES TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF PHILIPPINE BUMBLE BEES.",BOMBUS FLAVESCENS; BOMBUS IRISANENSIS; PHILIPPINES; SOUTHEAST ASIA; SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL,BOMBUS-IMPATIENS; DECLINE; VULNERABILITY; POLLINATORS; PATTERNS; WESTERN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"KOCH, JB (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV HAWAII, TROP CONSERVAT BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI GRAD PROGRAM, 200 WEST KAWILI ST, HILO, HI 96720 USA.;KOCH, JONATHAN B., UNIV HAWAII, TROP CONSERVAT BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI GRAD PROGRAM, 200 WEST KAWILI ST, HILO, HI 96720 USA.;GENERAL, DAVID EMMANUEL M., UNIV PHILIPPINES, MUSEUM NAT HIST, UPPER CAMPUS, LAGUNA 4031, PHILIPPINES.",10.1093/AESA/SAY046,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP IN BIOLOGY [1523661]; DAVID H.

ECOL. MANAGE.,"NATURAL DISTURBANCES ARE CRITICAL FOR SUPPORTING BIODIVERSITY IN MANY ECOSYSTEMS, BUT SUBSEQUENT MANAGEMENT ACTIONS CAN INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF HABITAT THAT FOLLOW THESE EVENTS. POST-DISTURBANCE SALVAGE LOGGING HAS NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ON CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF FOREST BIODIVERSITY, BUT POPULATIONS OF SOME EARLY SERAL-ADAPTED ORGANISMS MAY BE MAINTAINED IN SALVAGE-LOGGED AREAS. WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF AN ESSENTIAL GROUP OF POLLINATORS - WILD BEES - TO RECENT POST-WILDFIRE SALVAGE LOGGING WITHIN MANAGED MIXED-CONIFER FOREST IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. WE COMPARED BEE DIVERSITY (I.E., BEE ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS, ALPHA DIVERSITY, AND BETA DIVERSITY) AND HABITAT FEATURES (I.E., FLORAL RESOURCES AND AVAILABLE NESTING SUBSTRATES) IN SALVAGE-LOGGED AREAS TO UNLOGGED SITES, BOTH OF WHICH EXPERIENCED HIGH-SEVERITY WILDFIRE. ALTHOUGH WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR DIFFERENCES IN BEE ABUNDANCE BETWEEN SALVAGE-LOGGED AND UNLOGGED SITES, INTERPOLATED ESTIMATES OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND BOTH INTERPOLATED AND EXTRAPOLATED ESTIMATES OF ALPHA DIVERSITY WERE GREATER IN UNLOGGED SITES. ADDITIONALLY, BETA DIVERSITY WAS GREATER IN UNLOGGED SITES WHEN EQUAL WEIGHT WAS GIVEN TO RARE SPECIES. SALVAGE LOGGING DID NOT SELECT FOR SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF BEES, AS BOTH LOGGED AND UNLOGGED SITES WERE DOMINATED BY GENERALIST, SOCIAL SPECIES THAT NEST IN THE GROUND. HOWEVER, HABITAT CONDITIONS FOR BEES WERE INFLUENCED BY SALVAGE LOGGING: FLOWERING PLANT DENSITY WAS GREATER IN SALVAGE-LOGGED SITES DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE SEASON, WITH FEWER CONIFER SNAGS AND MORE WOODY DEBRIS THAN WERE AVAILABLE IN UNLOGGED SITES.

FROM 2012 TO 2014, WITH HELP FROM 53 CITIZEN SCIENTISTS, WE CONDUCTED SURVEYS TO DETERMINE THE STATUS OF BUMBLE BEES THROUGHOUT VERMONT, USA. FOR HISTORICAL COMPARISON, WE IDENTIFIED AND DIGITIZED BUMBLE BEE SPECIMENS FROM 13 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.

OF 17 SPECIES, FOUR WERE NOT DETECTED AND FOUR SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES. RAREFACTION INDICATED THAT BOTH MODERN AND HISTORIC DATASETS SLIGHTLY UNDERESTIMATED KNOWN SPECIES RICHNESS, DIVERSITY, AND ABUNDANCE, BUT CONFIRMED A STRONG DECLINE FOR ALL THREE PARAMETERS.

THE PARAMETERS ESTIMATION PERFORMANCE OF PGJAYA IS EVALUATED THROUGH THREE WIDELY USED STANDARD DATASETS OF DIFFERENT PV MODELS INCLUDING SINGLE DIODE, DOUBLE DIODE, AND PV MODULE. COMPARATIVE AND STATISTICAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PGJAYA HAS A SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE AS IT ALWAYS OBTAINS THE MOST ACCURATE PARAMETERS WITH STRONG ROBUSTNESS AMONG ALL COMPARED ALGORITHMS. FURTHERMORE, THE TESTS BASED ON EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM THE DATA SHEET OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PV MODULES SUGGEST THAT THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM CAN ACHIEVE SUPERIOR RESULTS AT DIFFERENT IRRADIANCE AND TEMPERATURE. BASED ON THESE SUPERIORITIES, IT IS CONCLUDED THAT PGJAYA IS A PROMISING PARAMETER IDENTIFICATION METHOD FOR PV CELL AND MODULE MODEL.",PARAMETERS IDENTIFICATION; PHOTOVOLTAIC CELL AND MODULE; JAYA ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION,ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY; BIOGEOGRAPHY-BASED OPTIMIZATION; FLOWER POLLINATION ALGORITHM; PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; SOLAR-CELLS; PV CELLS; MODEL; EXTRACTION; SYSTEM; STRATEGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,21,"LIANG, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZHENGZHOU UNIV, SCH ELECT ENGN, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YU, KUNJIE, YUE, CAITONG, GE, SHILEI, LIANG, JING, ZHENGZHOU UNIV, SCH ELECT ENGN, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;QU, BOYANG, ZHONGYUAN UNIV TECHNOL, SCH ELECT \& INFORMAT ENGN, ZHENGZHOU 450007, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHEN, XU, JIANGSU UNIV, SCH ELECT \& INFORMAT ENGN, ZHENJIANG 212013, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.APENERGY.2019.01.008,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [61806179, 61876169, 61473266, 61673404]; CHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONCHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [2017M622373]; KEY RAMP;D AND PROMOTION PROJECTS IN HENAN PROVINCE [192102210405]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIESFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [222201817006]; PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE AMP; TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION TALENTS IN UNIVERSITIES OF HENAN PROVINCE [16HASTIT041, 16HASTIT033]; CHINA TEXTILE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY GUIDANCE PROJECT [2017054]; YOUNG BACKBONE TEACHERS OF HENAN PROVINCE [2016GGJS-094]","THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (61806179, 61876169, 61473266, AND 61673404), CHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (2017M622373), KEY R\&D AND PROMOTION PROJECTS IN HENAN PROVINCE (192102210405), FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES (222201817006), PROGRAM FOR SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION TALENTS IN UNIVERSITIES OF HENAN PROVINCE (16HASTIT041 AND 16HASTIT033), CHINA TEXTILE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY GUIDANCE PROJECT (2017054), AND YOUNG BACKBONE TEACHERS OF HENAN PROVINCE (2016GGJS-094).",0306-2619,NA,241-257,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,237,2019,ISI000459845100021,60,"ENERGY \& FUELS, ENGINEERING",12,"ENERGY \& FUELS, ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL",LIANGJINGZZU.EDU.CN,HN0AC,"LIANG, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZHENGZHOU UNIV, SCH ELECT ENGN, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,none,ZHENGZHOU UNIV;ZHONGYUAN UNIV TECHNOL;JIANGSU UNIV,ZHENGZHOU UNIV,NA,"YU K, 2019, APPL ENERGY","YU K, 2019, APPL ENERGY",NA,NA,NA,NA
COLLADO MA;SOL D;BARTOMEUS I,COLLADO MA,BEES USE ANTHROPOGENIC HABITATS DESPITE STRONG NATURAL HABITAT PREFERENCES,DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,DIVERS. DISTRIB.,"AIM HABITAT LOSS AND ALTERATION ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS OF CURRENT POLLINATOR DIVERSITY LOSS. YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HABITAT IMPORTANCE AND PREFERENCES FOR MAJOR GROUPS OF POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH THIS INFORMATION IS CRUCIAL TO ANTICIPATE AND MITIGATE THE CURRENT DECLINE OF THEIR POPULATIONS. WE AIM TO RANK AND ASSESS THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT HABITATS FOR BEES, TO DETERMINE THE PREFERENCE FOR AND AVOIDANCE OF PARTICULAR HABITAT TYPES BY DIFFERENT BEES AND TO QUANTIFY THE DIVERSITY OF BEES WITHIN AND AMONG HABITATS. LOCATION NORTH-EASTERN USA. TIME PERIOD THE SAMPLING WAS DONE OVER 15 YEARS (2001-2015). MAJOR TAXA STUDIED APOIDEA. METHODS WE USED AN UNPRECEDENTED EXTENSIVE DATASET OF >15,000 BEE SPECIMENS, COMPRISING MORE THAN 400 SPECIES COLLECTED ACROSS NORTH-EAST USA. WE EXTRACTED HABITAT INFORMATION FROM THE SAMPLE POINTS AND USED NETWORK ANALYSES, NULL MODELS COMPARISONS AND BETA-DIVERSITY ANALYSIS TO ASSESS HABITAT IMPORTANCE, HABITAT PREFERENCE, USE AND DIVERSITY. RESULTS WE FOUND THAT NATURAL HABITATS SUSTAIN HIGHER BEE DIVERSITY AND A DIFFERENT SET OF SPECIES THAN AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN AREAS. ALTHOUGH MANY BEE SPECIES USED HUMAN-ALTERED HABITATS, MOST SPECIES EXHIBITED STRONG PREFERENCES FOR FORESTED HABITATS AND ONLY A FEW PREFERRED ALTERED HABITATS OVER MORE NATURAL HABITATS. IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS STUDIES, LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION ONLY HAD MODERATE BUFFER EFFECTS ON DIVERSITY LOSS. THE LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY IN HUMAN-ALTERED ENVIRONMENTS COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BUT IT WAS PARTIALLY COMPENSATED BY THE PRESENCE OF HUMAN COMMENSALS AND EXOTIC SPECIES. MAIN CONCLUSIONS ALTHOUGH HUMAN-ALTERED ENVIRONMENTS MAY HARBOUR A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF SPECIES, OUR WORK SUGGESTS THAT PRESERVING NATURAL AREAS IS STILL ESSENTIAL TO GUARANTEE THE CONSERVATION OF BEE BIODIVERSITY.",HABITAT IMPORTANCE; HABITAT PREFERENCE; HABITAT USE; LANDSCAPE; POLLINATORS; URBAN,PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY; LAND-USE; R PACKAGE; BIODIVERSITY; IMPACTS; POLLINATORS; EXTRAPOLATION; URBANIZATION; RAREFACTION; HYMENOPTERA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"COLLADO, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CSIC, EBD, SEVILLE, SPAIN.;COLLADO, MIGUEL A., BARTOMEUS, IGNASI, CSIC, EBD, SEVILLE, SPAIN.;COLLADO, MIGUEL A., SOL, DANIEL, CREAF, CATALONIA, SPAIN.;SOL, DANIEL, CSIC, CATALONIA, SPAIN.",10.1111/DDI.12899,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDAD, GOBIERNO DE ESPANA [CGL2013-47448-P]","MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDAD, GOBIERNO DE ESPANA, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: CGL2013-47448-P",1366-9516,6,924-935,WILEY,25,2019,ISI000468467600006,57,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",21,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ECOLOGY",XMIGUELANGELCOLLADOXGMAIL.COM,HY9NI,"COLLADO, MA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CSIC, EBD, SEVILLE, SPAIN",ISI,none,COLLADO;COLLADO,COLLADO,NA,"COLLADO MA, 2019, DIVERS DISTRIB","COLLADO MA, 2019, DIVERS DISTRIB",NA,NA,NA,NA
