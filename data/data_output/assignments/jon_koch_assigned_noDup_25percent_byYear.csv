IN A PREVIOUS PAPER, IT WAS SHOWN THAT THE APPROACH OF FLOWER-NAIVE, UNTRAINED BUMBLEBEES TOWARD FLOWER DUMMIES IS RELEASED BY COLOUR SIGNALS, I.E. A GRADIENT OF SPECTRAL PURITY. THE BUMBLEBEES ARE DIRECTED TOWARD THAT PART OF A FLOWER DUMMY WHICH EXHIBITS THE HIGHEST SPECTRAL PURITY (LUNAU 1990). IN THE PRESENT WORK IT IS SHOWN THAT THE BUMBLEBEES, WHILE STILL IN FLIGHT, MAKE CONTACT WITH THIS PART USING THEIR ANTENNAL TIPS. THE ANTENNAE REACTION IS FOLLOWED BY A LANDING REACTION WHICH IS RELEASED BY OLFACTORY AND OPTICAL SIGNALS. THE SPECIFIC OPTICAL SIGNALS OF THE GUIDE ARE WHICH RELEASE THE LANDING REACTION WERE INVESTIGATED. SINCE IN THE FLOWER DUMMIES WHICH WERE USED, THE GUIDE HAD THE HIGHEST SPECTRAL PURITY, MOST OF THE ANTENNAE REACTIONS WERE EXECUTED AT THE GUIDE. THE ANTENNAE REACTION ALLOWS FOR A PRECISE ORIENTATION AND MAY INVOLVE THE STIMULATION OF A SPECIALIZED AREA OF OMMATIDIA. MINUTE CHANGES IN OPTICAL GUIDE PARAMETERS COULD THUS BE DETECTED. THE FOLLOWING FEATURES OF STAMENS WHICH MOST EFFECTIVELY RELEASED THE LANDING REACTION WERE: A MINIMUM OF 2 THECA DUMMIES, AN OVAL SHAPE OF THECA DUMMIES WHICH FACE EACH OTHER ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS (BOTH THESE CHARACTERISTICS ARE FOUND IN GENUINE STAMENS), 4 MM DISTANCE BETWEEN THECA DUMMIES (THIS COINCIDES WITH THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ANTENNAL TIPS OF BUMBLEBEES), TWO EQUALLY SIZED THECA DUMMIES EACH WITH AN AREA OF 7 MM2 (THIS SIZE OF THECA DUMMIES WAS PREFERRED OVER LARGER OR SMALLER ONES, THE LATTER PARAMETER WAS NOT CHANGED WHEN THE COROLLA SIZE WAS VARIED). COLOUR PARAMETERS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN RELEASING THE LANDING REACTION. CLEARLY, BUMBLEBEES POSSESS AN INNATE RELEASING MECHANISM (IRM) THAT RESPONDS TO OPTICAL SIGNALS OF ANTHERS WHICH RELEASE THE LANDING REACTION. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THE COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF OSCHE (1979, 1983 A, 1983 B) THAT MANY FLOWER GUIDES CAN BE INTERPRETED AS STAMEN MIMICS.

ENVIRON.,"INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHOR FOR 15 YEARS ON THE WIELKOPOLSKO-KUJAWSKA LOWLAND (WESTERN POLAND) SHOWED THAT WILD BEES (APOIDEA) ARE TODAY UNDER STRONG HUMAN PRESSURE. ABOUT 260 BEE SPECIES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA OF 20 000 KM2. A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SPECIES WAS RECORDED IN THIS AREA BY INVESTIGATORS HALF A CENTURY AGO, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE SURVIVAL OF THE FAUNA SEEMS TO BE THE RESULT OF SOME COMPENSATING FACTORS REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT. THE MAIN FACTOR AMONG THESE IS THE MOSAIC STRUCTURE OF THE LANDSCAPE, CONSISTING OF MEADOWS AND RESIDUES OF NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL PLANT COMMUNITIES AS A FAUNA REFUGE SYSTEM AND CROP FIELDS AS AN ADDITIONAL NUTRITIVE SYSTEM. IT WAS FOUND THAT IN A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, THE SHARE OF FARMLAND SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE-QUARTERS OF THE TOTAL SURFACE. THE REMAINING PART OF THE LANDSCAPE SHOULD BE MADE UP OF REFUGE HABITATS FOR APOIDEA. WITHIN SUCH A SYSTEM, QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CHANGES OF THE BEE FAUNA CAN OCCUR ON A MICROREGIONAL SCALE AND ARE USUALLY OF TEMPORARY CHARACTER. ON A REGIONAL SCALE THEY ARE NOT PERCEIVABLE AND PROBABLY NOT SO IMPORTANT. HENCE, INSTEAD OF CHANGES IN FAUNA, ONE SHOULD RATHER SPEAK ABOUT QUANTITATIVE OSCILLATIONS INSIDE A GIVEN REGION.

(LILIACEAE) IN A SEMI-ARID ENVIRONMENT, TO TEST WHETHER SEED PRODUCTION OF PLANTS WAS LIMITED BY QUANTITY AND/OR QUALITY OF POLLEN SUPPLY. THE NATURAL POLLINATORS ARE MAINLY SOLITARY BEES. THE FRACTION OF FLOWERS SETTING FRUITS VARIED FROM 8 TO 40\% BETWEEN YEARS. FRUIT SET OF PLANTS CAGED TO EXCLUDE INSECTS WAS LESS THAN 3\%. FRUIT SET WAS INCREASED BY ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION OF FLOWERS WITH THEIR OWN POLLEN TO 43-64\%. THIS INDICATES THAT THE PLANT IS SELF-COMPATIBLE, BUT DUE TO THE POSITION OF THE ANTHERS AND STIGMA, INSECT VISITS ARE REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE POLLINATION. CROSS-POLLINATED CAGED FLOWERS SET YET MORE FRUITS (59-82\%) AND MUCH MORE (2-4 TIMES) FULL SEEDS PER FRUIT THAN SELF-POLLINATED FLOWERS. THE ARTIFICIAL ADDITION OF CROSS-POLLEN TO FLOWERS, IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT, INCREASED THE MEAN NUMBER OF FULL SEEDS PER FLOWER ON THE WHOLE PLANT. THUS, NATURAL REPRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY INSECT POLLINATION. A QUANTITATIVE EFFECT WAS INDICATED BY A STRONG POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS ON A STIGMA AND THE PROBABILITIES OF THE FLOWER MATURING A FRUIT AND OF ITS OVULES SETTING SEEDS. FURTHERMORE, IN 20-60\% OF FLOWERS IN THE POPULATION, STIGMA LOADS WERE LESS THAN 13 POLLEN GRAINS, WHICH INDICATED VERY LOW PROBABILITY OF FRUIT MATURATION. A QUALITATIVE RESPONSE WAS SHOWN BY THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF ARTIFICIALLY ADDED CROSS-POLLEN ON THE NUMBER OF FULL VS. EMPTY SEEDS, AN EFFECT SIMILAR TO THAT OF CROSS- VS. SELF-POLLINATION IN CAGED PLANTS. THE PROPORTION OF FULL SEEDS DEVELOPING IN A CLONE OF ASPHODELUS IN THE NATURAL POPULATION WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO THE PROPORTION OF INFLORESCENCES IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT BELONGED TO THE SAME CLONE, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT FERTILITY IS LIMITED BY AN EXCESS OF POLLEN FROM THE SAME CLONE BEING SUPPLIED BY INSECTS.

A SIMPLE POLLINATION MODEL IS PRESENTED HERE AS A USEFUL TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF ALFALFA AND ITS SOLITARY BEE POLLINATOR, MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA (FABR.) (MEGACHILIDAE). IN PARTICULAR, THE QUESTION IS RAISED WHETHER THERE IS A TRADEOFF BETWEEN SEED YIELDS AND BEE YIELDS AS THE NUMBER OF INTRODUCED FEMALE BEES INCREASES. THIS QUESTION HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ALFALFA SEED CROP. SUCH A TRADEOFF REQUIRES A MAXIMUM BEE YIELD AT SOME OPTIMUM NUMBER OF INTRODUCED FEMALES, AND AN INCREASE IN SEED YIELDS WHEN INTRODUCED FEMALES INCREASE ABOVE THE BEE YIELD OPTIMUM. BOTH OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WERE MET IF MALE NECTAR VISITS ACCOUNT FOR A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF POLLINATION, AND IF SEARCH TIME IS SUFFICIENTLY SLOW WHEN OPEN FLOWERS ARE SCARCE. MALE NECTAR VISITS CAN INTERFERE WITH REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF THE BEE SPECIES, CREATING A BEE YIELD OPTIMUM. SLOW SEARCH TIMES CAUSE SEED YIELDS TO INCREASE WHEN THE NUMBER OF INTRODUCED FEMALES IS GREATER THAN THE BEE YIELD OPTIMUM.",NA,NA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,12,"STRICKLER, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV IDAHO,PARMA RES \& EXTENS CTR,PARMA,ID 83660, USA.",NA,"PO BOX 368, LAWRENCE, KS 66044",NA,NA,NA,0022-8567,4,201-215,KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOC,69,1996,ISIA1996WJ92500018,27,ENTOMOLOGY,8,ENTOMOLOGY,NA,WJ925,"STRICKLER, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV IDAHO,PARMA RES \& EXTENS CTR,PARMA,ID 83660, USA",ISI,none,NA,UNIV IDAHO,NA,"STRICKLER K, 1996, J KANS ENTOMOL SOC","STRICKLER K, 1996, J KANS ENTOMOL SOC",NA,NA,NA,NA
CHITTKA L,CHITTKA L,OPTIMAL SETS OF COLOR RECEPTORS AND COLOR OPPONENT SYSTEMS FOR CODING OF NATURAL OBJECTS IN INSECT VISION,JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY,J. THEOR. BIOL.,"MODEL CALCULATIONS ARE USED TO FIND AN OPTIMAL COLOR VISION SYSTEM FOR THE CODING OF NATURAL OBJECTS. THE CRITERIA TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF COLOR VISION ARE (A) DISCRIMINABILITY BETWEEN ALL COLORS OF A GIVEN SET, (B) DISCRIMINABILITY BETWEEN NEAREST NEIGHBORS (ONLY THE MOST SIMILAR COLORS OF A SET), AND (C) DETECTABILITY (COLOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TARGET AND BACKGROUND). THE COLORED OBJECTS INVESTIGATED ARE SEVERAL SETS OF FLOWER COLORS, ONE SET OF GREEN FOLIAGE COLORS, AND ONE SET OF FRUIT COLORS. A LARGE VARIETY OF HYPOTHETICAL COLOR VISION SYSTEMS WAS GENERATED BY VARYING BOTH THE WAVELENGTH POSITIONS OF PHOTORECEPTORS AND THE WEIGHTS OF COLOR OPPONENT PROCESSES USED TO EVALUATE THE RECEPTOR INPUTS. IT IS SHOWN THAT THE SET OF SPECTRAL RECEPTOR TYPES IN FLOWER VISITING BEES (LAMBDA MAX=340, 430 AND 540 NM) IS CLOSE TO OPTIMAL FOR THE DISCRIMINATION OF SEVERAL SETS OF SYMPATRIC AND SIMULTANEOUSLY BLOOMING FLOWER COLORS, AS WELL AS FOR DISCRIMINATION OF GREEN FOLIAGE, BUT NOT FOR FRUIT COLORATION. FOR TWO SETS OF OBJECTS, THE ILLUMINANT WAS VARIED, WHICH CHANGED THE RESULTS ONLY MARGINALLY. DETECTABILITY OF FLOWERS AGAINST BACKGROUND IS LIKEWISE OPTIMAL. THE OPTIMAL WAVELENGTH POSITIONS OF PHOTORECEPTORS ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE PARTICULAR COLOR OPPONENT MECHANISMS USED TO EVALUATE THE PHOTORECEPTOR SIGNALS. OPTIMAL COLOR OPPONENT SYSTEMS ARE ALL THOSE WHICH COMPRISE TWO OPPONENT PROCESSES WITH WEIGHTING FACTORS DIFFERING STRONGLY FROM ONE ANOTHER. THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A RECENT PHYLOGENETIC STUDY WHICH SHOWED THAT WAVELENGTH TUNING OF INSECT PHOTORECEPTORS LIKELY PREDATED THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWER COLOR.

A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL FOR ANALYSING THE BEHAVIOUR OF POLLINATORS FORAGING ON MORE THAN ONE PLANT TYPE (SPECIES OR MORPH) IS NEEDED. 2. A PROTOCOL IS PRESENTED IN WHICH THE FIRST STEP IS TO TEST WHETHER FORAGING TRIPS ARE HOMOGENEOUS IN THE FREQUENCY OF VISITS TO EACH PLANT TYPE, OR WHETHER THERE ARE TWO OR MORE GROUPS OF POLLINATORS WITH DIFFERENT FORAGING PREFERENCES. 3. TESTS FOR FORAGING PREFERENCE AND CONSTANCY IN THE SEQUENCE OF PLANTS VISITED THEN SHOULD BE MADE SEPARATELY FOR EACH HOMOGENEOUS GROUP. 4. A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN IN WHICH IGNORING HETEROGENEITY OF PREFERENCE WOULD LEAD TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF A FALSE NULL HYPOTHESIS OF RANDOM BEHAVIOUR. 5. A REAL EXAMPLE IS GIVEN IN WHICH HETEROGENEITY OF PREFERENCE WAS THE ONLY NONRANDOM ASPECT OF POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR (NO SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CONSTANCY OR OVERALL PREFERENCE), WHILE TRANSFER OF POWDERED DYE PARTICLES (POLLEN ANALOGUES) WAS ASSORTATIVE AMONG FLORAL MORPHS. 6.

PLANT RES.,"FLORAL NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION, NECTARY ANATOMY, AND VISITORS ARE STUDIED IN FIVE ARGENTINE ORCHIDACEAE, FROM 18 POPULATIONS. HAND-POLLINATIONS WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THEIR BREEDING SYSTEM. WE FOUND TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PERIGONAL NECTARIES LOCATED EITHER IN THE SPUR (HABENARIA GOURLIEANA, H. HIERONYMI, HABENARIINAE), OR IN THE BASAL LATERAL PARTS OF THE LABELLUM (BEADLEA DUTRAEI, PELEXIA BONARIENSIS, STENORRHYNCHOS ORCHIOIDES, SPIRANTHINAE). THE SPUR OF HABENARIA IS A NONVASCULARISED AND NONSTRUCTURAL NECTARY. THE INNER EPIDERMIS BEARS ONE-CELLED LONG PAPILLAE. IN BUD STAGE, THE PAPILLAE ARE FILLED WITH STARCH GRAINS, BUT WHEN THE FLOWER OPENS AND NECTAR SECRETION STARTS, THEY SHOW NO STARCH GRAINS. THIS FACT MAY INDICATE THAT STARCH IS A SOURCE FOR SOME OF THE SECRETED NECTAR. IN THE REMAINDER GENERA, THE LATERAL BASAL PARTS OF THE LABELLUM ARE SECRETORY. THE TWO GLANDS ARE LOCATED IN THE ADAXIAL BASAL LATERAL FACES OF THE THESE NECTARIES ARE STRUCTURAL AND NONVASCULARISED. STENORRHYNCHOS PRODUCES ABUNDANT, CONCENTRATED NECTAR(40-50\%). HABENARIA GOURLIEANA ACCUMULATES COPIOUS NECTAR IN A LOWER CONCENTRATION (<20\%), WHEREAS THE OTHER SPECIES PRODUCE SMALL QUANTITIES OF CONCENTRATED NECTAR (CA. 50\%).

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"FOR RECIPROCAL SPECIALIZATION (COEVOLUTION) TO OCCUR AMONG FLORAL VISITORS AND THEIR HOST PLANTS THE INTERACTIONS MUST BE TEMPORALLY AND SPATIALLY PERSISTENT HOWEVER, STUDIES REPEATEDLY HAVE SHOWN THAT SPECIES COMPOSITION AND RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OFF ORAL VISITORS VARY DRAMATICALLY AT ALL SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES. WE TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT, ON AVERAGE, POLLEN SPECIALIST BEE SPECIES OCCUR MORE PREDICTABLY AT THEIR FLORAL HOSTS THAN POLLEN GENERALIST BEE SPECIES. TAXONOMIC FLORAL SPECIALIZATION REACHES ITS EXTREME AMONG SPECIES OF SOLITARY, POLLEN-COLLECTING BEES, YET FEW STUDIES HAVE CONSIDERED HOW POLLEN SPECIALIZATION BY FLORAL VISITORS INFLUENCES THEIR SPATIAL CONSTANCY. WE TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS USING AN UNUSUALLY DIVERSE BEE GUILD THAT VISITS CREOSOTE BUSH (LARREA TRIDENTATA), THE MOST WIDESPREAD, DOMINANT PLANT OF THE WARM DESERTS OF NORTH AMERICA. TWENTY-TWO STRICT POLLEN SPECIALIST AND 80 + GENERALIST BEE SPECIES VISIT LARREA FOR ITS FLORAL RESOURCES. THE SITES WE SAMPLED WERE SEPARATED BY 0.5 TO > 1450 KM, AND SPANNED THREE DISTINCT DESERTS AND FOUR VEGETATION ZONES. WE FOUND THAT SPECIES OF LARREA POLLEN SPECIALIST BEES OCCURRED AT MORE SITES AND TENDED TO BE MORE ABUNDANT THAN GENERALISTS. SURPRISINGLY, SPATIAL TURNOVER WAS HIGH FOR BOTH POLLEN SPECIALIST AND GENERALIST BEE SPECIES AT ALL DISTANCES, AND SPECIES COMPOSITION OF SAMPLES FROM SITES 1-5 KM APART VARIED AS MUCH AS REPEAT SAMPLES MADE AT SINGLE SITES. NEVERTHELESS, THE PATTERN OF BEE SPECIES TURNOVER WAS NOT HAPHAZARD. AS DISTANCE AMONG SITES INCREASED FAUNAL SIMILARITY OF SITES DECREASED. FAUNAL SIMILARITIES AMONG SITES WITHIN 250 KM OF EACH OTHER WERE GENERALLY GREATER THAN IF RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED OVER ALL SITES (THE NULL MODEL). NO SINGLE ECOLOGICAL CATEGORY OF SPECIES (WIDESPREAD, LOCALIZED, LARREA POLLEN SPECIALIST, FLORAL GENERALIST) ACCOUNTED FOR THIS SPATIAL PREDICTABILITY. EVIDENTLY, CONCORDANT LOCAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS OF MANY ECOLOGICALLY DIVERSE SPECIES CONTRIBUTE TO THE NON-RANDOM SPATIAL PATTERN. THE ECOLOGICAL DOMINANCE OF CREOSOTE BUSH DOES NOT CONFER OBVIOUS ECOLOGICAL ADVANTAGES TO ITS SPECIALIST FLORAL VISITORS. SPATIAL TURNOVER IS COMPARABLE TO THAT FOUND FOR BEE GUILDS FROM OTHER BIOGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS OF THE WORLD AND IS NOT THEREFORE LIMITED TO THOSE BEE SPECIES THAT INHABIT HIGHLY SEASONAL CLIMATES, SUCH AS DESERTS. PHILOPATRY AND DIFFERENCES IN BLOOM PREDICTABILITY AMONG SITES ARE PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT CAUSES FOR SPATIAL TURNOVER OF BEE SPECIES THAN ARE INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR NEST SITES OR FLORAL RESOURCES.

ECOL.,"FEW STUDIES DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION FOR COMMUNITIES OF POLLINATING INSECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR THE KEY POLLINATOR GROUP, BEES (HYMENOPTERA: APIFORMES). BEES TYPICALLY LIVE IN HABITATS WHERE NESTING SUBSTRATES AND BLOOM ARE PATCHILY DISTRIBUTED AND SPATIALLY DISSOCIATED. BEE STUDIES HAVE ALL DEFINED HABITAT FRAGMENTS AS REMNANT PATCHES OF FLORAL HOSTS OR FORESTS, OVERLOOKING THE NESTING NEEDS OF BEES. SEVERAL AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT HABITAT FRAGMENTATION IS BROADLY DELETERIOUS, BUT THEIR OWN DATA SHOW THAT SOME NATIVE SPECIES PROLIFERATE IN SAMPLED FRAGMENTS. OTHER STUDIES REPORT GREATER DENSITIES AND COMPARABLE DIVERSITIES OF NATIVE BEES AT FLOWERS IN SOME FRAGMENT SIZE CLASSES RELATIVE TO UNDISRUPTED HABITATS, BUT FIND DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN SPECIES COMPOSITION. INSIGHTFUL STUDIES OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND BEES WILL CONSIDER FRAGMENTATION, ALTERATION, AND LOSS OF NESTING HABITATS, NOT JUST PATCHES OF FORAGE PLANTS, AS WELL AS THE PERMEABILITY OF THE SURROUNDING MATRIX TO INTERPATCH MOVEMENT. INASMUCH AS THE FLORAL ASSOCIATIONS AND NESTING HABITS OF BEES ARE OFTEN ATTRIBUTES OF SPECIES OR SUBGENERA, ECOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS HINGE ON AUTHORITATIVE IDENTIFICATIONS. STUDY DESIGNS MUST ACCOMMODATE STATISTICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BEE COMMUNITY SAMPLES, ESPECIALLY NON-NORMAL DATA AND FREQUENT ZERO VALUES. THE SPATIAL SCALE OF FRAGMENTATION MUST BE APPRECIATED: BEES OF MEDIUM BODY SIZE CAN REGULARLY FLY 1-2 KM FROM NEST SITE TO FORAGE PATCH.

IN THIS STUDY THE HABITAT USE OF BUMBLEBEES WAS INVESTIGATED ON SALISBURY PLAIN TRAINING AREA, THE LARGEST REMAINING AREA OF UNIMPROVED CHALK GRASSLAND IN NORTH-WEST EUROPE. HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS INFLUENCING THE OVERALL ABUNDANCE, SPECIES RICHNESS AND FORAGING ACTIVITY OF BUMBLEBEES INCLUDED THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES (PARTICULARLY OF FAVOURED FORAGE PLANTS SUCH AS TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE), VEGETATION STRUCTURE AND HEIGHT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT DIFFERENT BOMBUS SPECIES RESPOND TO THESE HABITAT CHARACTERISTICS DEPENDING ON THEIR SPECIFIC FORAGING AND NESTING REQUIREMENTS, THE CASE OF BOMBUS HUMILIS BEING ESPECIALLY RELEVANT. THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL GRASSLAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WERE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF THEIR SUITABILITY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BUMBLEBEE HABITATS.

SCI. U. S. A.,"EVOLUTIONARY KEY INNOVATIONS GIVE ORGANISMS ACCESS TO NEW ECOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND CAUSE RAPID, SOMETIMES SPECTACULAR ADAPTIVE RADIATION. THE WELL KNOWN OBLIGATE POLLINATION MUTUALISM BETWEEN YUCCAS AND YUCCA MOTHS IS A MAJOR MODEL SYSTEM FOR STUDIES OF COEVOLUTION, AND IT RELIES ON THE KEY INNOVATION IN THE MOTHS OF COMPLEX TENTACLES USED FOR POLLEN COLLECTING AND ACTIVE POLLINATION. THESE STRUCTURES LACK APPARENT HOMOLOGY IN OTHER INSECTS, MAKING THEM A RARE EXAMPLE OF A NOVEL LIMB. WE PERFORMED ANATOMICAL AND BEHAVIORAL STUDIES TO DETERMINE THEIR ORIGIN AND FOUND EVIDENCE OF A REMARKABLY SIMPLE MECHANISM. MORPHOLOGICAL ANALYSES OF THE TENTACLES AND ADJACENT MOUTHPARTS IN POLLINATORS AND CLOSELY RELATED TAXA SHOWED THAT THE TENTACLE APPEARS ABRUPTLY IN FEMALE POLLINATING YUCCA MOTHS. SEVERAL MORPHOLOGICAL SYNAPOMORPHIES BETWEEN THE GALEAE, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE CHARACTERISTIC LEPIDOPTERAN PROBOSCIS, AND THE TENTACLE SUGGEST THAT THE TENTACLE EVOLVED QUICKLY THROUGH EXPRESSION OF THE GENETIC TEMPLATE FOR THE GALEA AT AN APICAL GROWTH BUD ON THE FIRST SEGMENT OF THE MAXILLARY PALP. BEHAVIORAL DATA INDICATE THAT TENTACLE AND PROBOSCIS MOVEMENTS ARE CONTROLLED BY A SHARED HYDRAULIC EXTENSION MECHANISM, THUS NO NEW MECHANISM WAS NEEDED FOR TENTACLE FUNCTION.

ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES AND INSECT GROUPS WERE ANALYZED USING BINOMIAL TESTS BASED ON CENSUS DATA OBTAINED FROM TWO SITES OVER 3 YEARS. `PREFERENCE TO AN INSECT GROUP BY A PLANT SPECIES' WAS EXPRESSED AS A SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION OF THE ACTUAL PROPORTION (I.E. THE PROPORTION OF THE NUMBER OF FLOWER VISITS BY THE INSECT GROUP TO THE PLANT SPECIES IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VISITS TO THE PLANT SPECIES) OF THE EXPECTED PROPORTION (I.E.

THERE ARE APPROX. 250 POPULATIONS IN A 110 KM NORTH-SOUTH DISTRIBUTION AND POPULATIONS ARE USUALLY SMALL WITH FEWER THAN 50 PLANTS/CLUMPS. THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF THE SPECIES WAS STUDIED TO DETERMINE WHY SEED-SET IS REPORTEDLY RARE. FLOWERS ARE BISEXUAL, ODOURLESS AND NECTARLESS. FLOWERS ARE PRESENTED DEPENDENTALLY AND THERE ARE EIGHT STAMENS RECURVED AROUND THE PISTIL. ANTHERS ARE PORICIDAL, CONTAIN VIABLE POLLEN AND BASALLY CONTAIN A DEEP-RED TAPETAL FLUID THAT IS SLIGHTLY OILY. THUS FLOWERS ARE PRESENTED FOR BUZZ POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH NONE WERE OBSERVED AT FLOWERS DURING OUR STUDY. THE SPECIES WAS FOUND TO BE FACULTATIVELY XENOGAMOUS WITH ONLY ONE IN 50 GLASSHOUSE FLOWERS SETTING SEED AUTOGAMOUSLY, I.E. WITHOUT POLLINATOR ASSISTANCE. FIELD STUDIES REVEALED FERTILE FRUIT IN 24 POPULATIONS BUT PRODUCTION VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS SITES FROM EXCEEDINGLY LOW (0.6 FRUITS PER PLANT CLUMP) TO LOW (17 FRUITS PER PLANT CLUMP). FRUIT-SET RANGED FROM 0 TO 65\%, SUGGESTING THAT POLLEN VECTORS EXIST OR THAT AUTOGAMY LEVELS IN THE FIELD ARE VARIABLE AND HIGHER THAN GLASSHOUSE RESULTS. FRUIT PRODUCTION DID NOT VARY WITH POPULATION SIZE, ALTHOUGH IN THREE OF THE FIVE POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTH-WEST REGION MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH FRUIT WAS PRODUCED AS IN POPULATIONS ELSEWHERE. A MODERATELY STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOLIAGE VOLUME AND FRUIT : FLOWER RATIOS SUGGESTS THAT BIGGER PLANTS MAY BE MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN SMALLER PLANTS TO POLLINATORS.

EFFECTS OF ANTHER ARRANGEMENT ON POLLEN DEPOSITION AND REMOVAL IN HERMAPHRODITE FLOWERS WERE EXPERIMENTALLY QUANTIFIED TO ASSESS THE ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF STAMEN STRUCTURE. THE ANTHER ARRANGEMENT OF BRASSICA RAPA WAS MODIFIED INTO SIX TYPES WITH RESPECT TO ANTHER NUMBER AND THE SPATIAL ARRANGEMENT OF LONG AND SHORT STAMENS. EACH ANTHER TREATMENT WAS COMBINED WITH A NECTAR-INTACT AND NECTAR-DEPLETED TREATMENT. AFTER SINGLE VISITS BY BUMBLEBEES IN A GLASSHOUSE, THE VISIT DURATION TO EACH FLOWER AND THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS AND POLLEN GRAINS REMAINING IN LONG AND SHORT ANTHERS WERE MEASURED. 2. VISITS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER IN NECTAR-DEPLETED FLOWERS. SHORT ANTHERS ALSO EXTENDED VISIT DURATION, BUT MODIFICATION OF THE LONG ANTHER ARRANGEMENT HAD NO EFFECT. POLLEN DEPOSITION ON STIGMAS DEPENDED ON THE NUMBER OF LONG ANTHERS AND ON VISIT DURATION. ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN LONG ANTHER NUMBER ACCELERATED SELF-POLLINATION, REMOVAL OF SHORT ANTHERS DID NOT INFLUENCE POLLEN DEPOSITION. 3.

ANY MODIFICATION OF ANTHER ARRANGEMENT TENDED TO INCREASE POLLEN REMOVAL DURING SINGLE VISITS. LONG ANTHERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN POLLEN REMOVAL PER VISIT, WHILE POLLEN REMOVAL FROM SHORT ANTHERS DEPENDED ONLY ON VISIT DURATION.

ARNESON LC;TEPEDINO VJ;SMITH SL,ARNESON LC,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH A NATIVE SPECIALIST BEE,NORTHWEST SCIENCE,NORTHWEST SCI.,"BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW, A FIRE-FOLLOWING MALLOW ENDEMIC TO THE MODOC PLATEAU OF NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA AND SOUTHERN OREGON, HAS RECENTLY BEEN DESIGNATED A SENSITIVE SPECIES. MANAGEMENT CONSERVATION DECISIONS FOR SUCH RARE SPECIES ARE STRENGTHENED BY INFORMATION ON NATURAL HISTORY, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THIS PLANT. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE TO DESCRIBE ASPECTS OF ITS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SEVERAL OCCURRENCES OF DIFFERENT BURN AGE AND SIZE, TO DETERMINE ITS NEED FOR POLLINATORS IN SEXUAL REPRODUCTION, AND TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT FLOWER-VISITORS. REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRUITS/FLOWER, SEEDS/FRUIT) FOR BAKER'S GLOBE MALLOW VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS OCCURRENCES, AND WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AGE OR SIZE OF BURN. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FRUITS/FLOWER AND SITE ELEVATION, AND WITH DISTANCE TO NEAREST BURN. THERE WAS NO PHENOLOGICAL PATTERN TO FRUIT OR SEED PRODUCTION, NOR WERE CLUMPED PLANTS MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE FRUITS OR SEEDS THAN ISOLATED PLANTS. FLOWERS DID NOT SET FRUIT OR PRODUCE SEEDS WITHOUT POLLINATOR VISITATION. THE MOST ABUNDANT FLOWER-VISITOR IN MOST OCCURRENCES WAS DIADASIA NITIDIFRONS, A NATIVE SOLITARY BEE THAT VISITS ONLY FLOWERS OF PLANTS IN THE MALLOW FAMILY.

FLOWERS NOT POLLINATED DID NOT SET ANY FRUIT. POLLINATION BY BEES PLUS MANUAL POLLINATION DID DOT DIFFER FROM EITHER BEE OR MANUAL POLLINATION. MAXIMUM FRUIT DIAMETER, FRUIT HEIGHT, AND ROUNDNESS (QUOTIENT BETWEEN MAXIMUM FRUIT DIAMETER AND FRUIT HEIGHT) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN TREATMENTS, BUT FRUIT VISITED BY M. QUADRIFASCIATA HAD 10.8\% LESS SEEDS (DRY MASS) THAN MANUAL POLLINATION. THIS APPARENTLY LOW EFFICIENCY OF M.

BODIN O;TENGO M;NORMAN A;LUNDBERG J;ELMQVIST T,BODIN O,THE VALUE OF SMALL SIZE: LOSS OF FOREST PATCHES AND ECOLOGICAL THRESHOLDS IN SOUTHERN MADAGASCAR,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,ECOL. APPL.,"MANY SERVICES GENERATED BY FOREST ECOSYSTEMS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SUPPORT FOR HUMAN WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE SERVICES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE SUCH AS FOREST FRAGMENTATION ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE PRESENT SPATIAL MODELING OF THE GENERATION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN A HUMAN-DOMINATED LANDSCAPE WHERE FOREST HABITAT PATCHES, PROTECTED BY LOCAL TABOOS, ARE LOCATED IN A MATRIX OF CULTIVATED LAND IN SOUTHERN MADAGASCAR. TWO ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DEPENDENT ON THE FOREST HABITATS WERE ADDRESSED: (1) CROP POLLINATION SERVICES BY WILD AND SEMIDOMESTICATED BEES (APOIDEA), ESSENTIAL FOR LOCAL CROP PRODUCTION OF, FOR EXAMPLE, BEANS, AND (2) SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF RING-TAILED LEMURS (LEMUR CATTA). WE STUDIED THE VULNERABILITY OF THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO A PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO OF SUCCESSIVE DESTRUCTION OF THE SMALLEST HABITAT PATCHES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT, IN SPITE OF THE FRAGMENTED NATURE OF THE LANDSCAPE, THE FRACTION OF THE LANDSCAPE PRESENTLY COVERED BY BOTH CROP POLLINATION AND SEED DISPERSAL SERVICES IS SURPRISINGLY HIGH. IT SEEMS THAT THE TABOO SYSTEM, THOUGH INDIRECTLY AND UNINTENTIONALLY, CONTRIBUTES TO UPHOLDING THE GENERATION OF THESE SERVICES BY PROTECTING THE FOREST PATCHES. BOTH SERVICES ARE, HOWEVER, PREDICTED TO BE VERY VULNERABLE TO THE SUCCESSIVE REMOVAL OF SMALL PATCHES. FOR CROP POLLINATION, THE RATE OF DECREASE IN COVER WAS SIGNIFICANT EVEN WHEN ONLY THE SMALLEST HABITAT PATCHES WERE REMOVED. THE CAPACITY FOR SEED DISPERSAL ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE DISPLAYED SEVERAL THRESHOLDS WITH HABITAT PATCH REMOVAL. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN CAPACITY FOR SEED DISPERSAL ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND CROP POLLINATION COVER IN SOUTHERN ANDROY, THE GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF THE REMAINING FOREST PATCHES IS MORE CRUCIAL THAN THEIR SIZE. WE ARGUE THAT IN HEAVILY FRAGMENTED PRODUCTION LANDSCAPES, SMALL FOREST PATCHES SHOULD INCREASINGLY BE VIEWED AS ESSENTIAL FOR MAINTAINING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AND ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE ONGOING PROCESS OF TRIPLING THE AREA OF PROTECTED HABITATS IN MADAGASCAR.",FOREST FRAGMENTATION; GRAPH; HABITAT LOSS; POLLINATION; SEED DISPERSAL; SMALL HABITATS; SOUTHERN MADAGASCAR,BEZA-MAHAFALY-RESERVE; LEMURS LEMUR-CATTA; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; LANDSCAPE CONNECTIVITY; POLLEN LIMITATION; TROPICAL FOREST; LIFE-HISTORY; NATIVE BEES; SEED SET; CONSERVATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,134,"BODIN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.;STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN.",10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0440:TVOSSL]2.0.CO;2,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NA,NA,1051-0761,2,440-451,WILEY,16,2006,ISI000237052200002,83,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,106,"ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",ORJANSYSTEM.ECOLOGY.SU.SE,036DW,"BODIN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), STOCKHOLM UNIV, DEPT SYST ECOL, S-10691 STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN",ISI,none,STOCKHOLM UNIV,STOCKHOLM UNIV,NA,"BODIN O, 2006, ECOL APPL","BODIN O, 2006, ECOL APPL",NA,NA,NA,NA

THE LOWEST LIGHT INTENSITY AT WHICH THEY CAN DO THIS, BOTH IN THE MORNING AND THE EVENING, IS 0.0001 CD M(-2). THEREFORE, THEY LEAVE THE NEST AT DIMMER LIGHT LEVELS IN THE MORNING THAN IN THE EVENING.

THOMSON JD,THOMSON JD,TACTICS FOR MALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN PLANTS: CONTRASTING INSIGHTS OF SEX ALLOCATION THEORY AND POLLEN PRESENTATION THEORY,INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY,INTEGR. COMP. BIOL.,"THE BASIC TENET OF SEX ALLOCATION THEORY IS THAT AN ORGANISM'S REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, THROUGH EITHER MALE OR FEMALE FUNCTION, CAN BE REPRESENTED AS A SEX-SPECIFIC, MONOTONIC, INCREASING FUNCTION OF THE ORGANISM'S INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES IN THAT FUNCTION. THE SHAPES OF THESE CURVES DETERMINE WHAT PATTERNS OF RESOURCE ALLOCATION CAN BE EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE. ALTHOUGH SA THEORY HAS STIMULATED CREATIVE THINKING ABOUT PLANT SEXUAL TACTICS, QUANTIFYING THE SHAPES OF MALE AND FEMALE GAIN CURVES HAS PROVEN SO DIFFICULT THAT OTHER APPROACHES MUST BE CONSIDERED. I CONTRAST SEX ALLOCATION THEORY TO A DIFFERENT, EMERGING VIEWPOINT, POLLEN PRESENTATION THEORY (PPT), WHICH ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS VARIATION IN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS BY MEASURING AND MODELING THE QUANTITATIVE FATES OF POLLEN GRAINS. MODELS SUGGEST THAT RS THROUGH MALE FUNCTION DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE PACKAGING AND GRADUAL DISPENSING OF POLLEN TO POLLINATORS, EVEN WITH THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT HELD CONSTANT. MANY PLANTS DO DEPLOY POLLEN GRADUALLY, THROUGH MORPHOLOGICAL AND ``BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS THAT RANGE FROM OBVIOUS TO SUBTLE. THEY MAY THEREBY INFLUENCE MANY ASPECTS OF THE EVOLUTION OF SEXUAL MODES IN PLANTS, INCLUDING TRANSITIONS BETWEEN DIOECY AND COSEXUALITY. AFTER REVIEWING THE MAIN IMPLICATIONS OF THE MODELS, I DISCUSS RECENT WORK AIMED AT TESTING SOME KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND PREDICTIONS BY FUNCTIONAL AND COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN THE GENUS PENSTEMON.

PETER CI;JOHNSON SD,PETER CI,MIMICS AND MAGNETS: THE IMPORTANCE OF COLOR AND ECOLOGICAL FACILITATION IN FLORAL DECEPTION,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"PLANTS THAT LACK FLORAL REWARDS CAN ATTRACT POLLINATORS IF THEY SHARE ATTRACTIVE FLORAL SIGNALS WITH REWARDING PLANTS. THESE DECEPTIVE PLANTS SHOULD BENEFIT FROM FLOWERING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO SUCH REWARDING PLANTS, BECAUSE POLLINATORS ARE LOCALLY CONDITIONED ON FLORAL SIGNALS OF THE REWARDING PLANTS (MIMIC EFFECT) AND BECAUSE POLLINATORS ARE MORE ABUNDANT CLOSE TO REWARDING PLANTS (MAGNET EFFECT). WE TESTED THESE IDEAS USING THE NON-REWARDING SOUTH AFRICAN PLANT EULOPHIA ZEYHERIANA (ORCHIDACEAE) AS A STUDY SYSTEM. FIELD OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THAT E. ZEYHERIANA IS POLLINATED SOLELY BY SOLITARY BEES BELONGING TO A SINGLE SPECIES OF LIPOTRICHES (HALICTIDAE) THAT APPEARS TO BE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLOWERS OF WAHLENBERGIA CUSPIDATA (CAMPANULACEAE), A REWARDING PLANT WITH WHICH THE ORCHID IS OFTEN SYMPATRIC. THE PALE BLUE COLOR OF THE FLOWERS OF E. ZEYHERIANA DIFFERS STRONGLY FROM FLOWERS OF ITS CONGENERS, BUT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF FLOWERS OF W. CUSPIDATA. ANALYSIS OF SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE PATTERNS USING A BEE VISION MODEL SHOWED THAT BEES ARE UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE TWO SPECIES IN TERMS OF FLOWER COLOR. A UV-ABSORBING SUNSCREEN WAS APPLIED TO THE FLOWERS OF THE ORCHID IN ORDER TO ALTER THEIR COLOR, AND THIS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN POLLINATOR VISITS, THUS INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF FLOWER COLOR FOR ATTRACTION OF LIPOTRICHES BEES. POLLINATION SUCCESS IN THE ORCHID WAS STRONGLY AFFECTED BY PROXIMITY TO PATCHES OF W. CUSPIDATA.

LINNEAN SOC.,"TO ASSESS THE POLLEN HOSTS OF 60 WESTERN PALAEARCTIC BEE SPECIES OF THE GENUS COLLETES (COLLETIDAE), WE MICROSCOPICALLY ANALYSED 1336 POLLEN LOADS OF COLLECTED FEMALES. TWENTY-SIX SPECIES (43.3\%) WERE FOUND TO BE SPECIALIZED AT THE LEVEL OF PLANT FAMILY, SUBFAMILY OR GENUS. THIRTY-FOUR SPECIES (56.7\%) PROVED TO BE POLLEN GENERALISTS TO VARYING DEGREES, VISITING THE FLOWERS OF UP TO 15 DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES. FLOWERS OF THE SUBFAMILY ASTEROIDEAE (ASTERACEAE) ARE BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLEN SOURCE, CONTRIBUTING 23.6\% TO THE POLLEN-PLANT SPECTRUM OF THE WHOLE BEE GENUS. THE HIGH SIGNIFICANCE OF ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN IS DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS: 14 COLLETES SPECIES BELONGING TO FOUR DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS HARVEST POLLEN EXCLUSIVELY OR PREDOMINANTLY ON FLOWERS OF THE ASTEROIDEAE. BY STRIKING CONTRAST, ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN PLAYS ONLY A MARGINAL ROLE IN THE DIETS OF THE POLLEN GENERALISTS: IT WAS RECORDED IN ONLY 2.7\% OF THE POLLEN LOADS AND IN SEVEN OUT OF THE 34 POLLEN GENERALISTS. AMONG THE FEW GENERALISTS EXPLOITING ASTEROIDEAE FOR POLLEN, THREE CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES HAVE ANCESTORS WHICH WERE POSSIBLY SPECIALIZED ON ASTERACEAE. THE PATTERN OF USE OF ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN BY THE COLLETES BEES SUPPORTS RECENT FINDINGS THAT THIS POLLEN POSSESSES UNFAVOURABLE OR PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES, WHICH RENDER ITS DIGESTION DIFFICULT, AND SUGGESTS THAT BEES NEED PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS TO SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZE IT.

IN RESPONSE TO THE STRONG NEED TO RECORD ONGOING SHIFTS IN POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE, GLOBAL AND REGIONAL POLLINATOR INITIATIVES MUST ADOPT STANDARDIZED SAMPLING PROTOCOLS WHEN DEVELOPING LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM MONITORING SCHEMES. WE SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATED THE PERFORMANCE OF SIX SAMPLING METHODS (OBSERVATION PLOTS, PAN TRAPS, STANDARDIZED AND VARIABLE TRANSECT WALKS, TRAP NESTS WITH REED INTERNODES OR PAPER TUBES) THAT ARE COMMONLY USED ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS IN EUROPE AND IN TWO HABITAT TYPES (AGRICULTURAL AND SEMINATURAL). WE FOCUSED ON BEES SINCE THEY REPRESENT THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATOR GROUP WORLDWIDE. SEVERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE METHODS WERE CONSIDERED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THEIR PERFORMANCE IN ASSESSING BEE DIVERSITY: SAMPLE COVERAGE, OBSERVED SPECIES RICHNESS, SPECIES RICHNESS ESTIMATORS, COLLECTOR BIASES (IDENTIFIED BY SUBUNIT-BASED RAREFACTION CURVES), SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE SAMPLES, AND THE INDICATION OF OVERALL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS (ESTIMATED FROM COMBINED TOTAL SAMPLES). THE MOST EFFICIENT METHOD IN ALL GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS, IN BOTH THE AGRICULTURAL AND SEMINATURAL HABITATS, WAS THE PAN TRAP METHOD. IT HAD THE HIGHEST SAMPLE COVERAGE, COLLECTED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF SPECIES, SHOWED NEGLIGIBLE COLLECTOR BIAS, DETECTED SIMILAR SPECIES AS THE TRANSECT METHODS, AND WAS THE BEST INDICATOR OF OVERALL BEE SPECIES RICHNESS. THE TRANSECT METHODS WERE ALSO RELATIVELY EFFICIENT, BUT THEY HAD A SIGNIFICANT COLLECTOR BIAS. THE OBSERVATION PLOTS SHOWED POOR PERFORMANCE. AS TRAP NESTS ARE RESTRICTED TO CAVITY-NESTING BEE SPECIES, THEY HAD A NATURALLY LOW SAMPLE COVERAGE. HOWEVER, BOTH TRAP NEST TYPES DETECTED ADDITIONAL SPECIES THAT WERE NOT RECORDED BY ANY OF THE OTHER METHODS. FOR LARGE-SCALE AND LONG-TERM MONITORING SCHEMES WITH SURVEYORS WITH DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE LEVELS, WE RECOMMEND PAN TRAPS AS THE MOST EFFICIENT, UNBIASED, AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR SAMPLING BEE DIVERSITY. TRAP NESTS WITH REED INTERNODES COULD BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY SAMPLING METHOD TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBERS OF COLLECTED SPECIES. TRANSECT WALKS ARE THE PRINCIPAL METHOD FOR DETAILED STUDIES FOCUSING ON PLANT-POLLINATOR ASSOCIATIONS.

LINNEAN SOC.,"HETEROSTYLY IS A GENETIC POLYMORPHISM IN WHICH PLANT POPULATIONS ARE COMPOSED OF TWO OR MORE MORPHS THAT DIFFER IN STIGMA AND ANTHER HEIGHTS. THE POLYMORPHISM PROMOTES INTERMORPH POLLEN TRANSFER, THUS OUTCROSSING. HETEROSTYLY HAS BEEN REPORTED IN 28 ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES AND IS FREQUENTLY LOST IN HETEROSTYLOUS LINEAGES. TO ASSESS ECOLOGICAL FACTORS RELATED TO SHIFTS FROM HETEROSTYLY TO MONOMORPHY, WE EXAMINED THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF HETEROSTYLOUS TROPICAL SHRUBS OF PSYCHOTRIA. AMONG 21 SPECIES AT BARRO COLORADO ISLAND AND THE NEARBY PARQUE NACIONAL SOBERANIA, PANAMA, 14 SPECIES WERE HETEROSTYLOUS WHILE SEVEN WERE MONOMORPHIC. A MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY AND THE EXISTENCE ELSEWHERE OF HETEROSTYLOUS POPULATIONS INDICATED THAT THE BREAKDOWN OF HETEROSTYLY HAD OCCURRED INDEPENDENTLY. HETEROSTYLOUS AND MONOMORPHIC SPECIES WERE VISITED BY THE SAME BEE SPECIES, ALTHOUGH VISIT FREQUENCIES WERE LOWER IN MONOMORPHIC SPECIES. MONOMORPHIC SPECIES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POPULATION DENSITY AND GREATER FRUIT SET THAN DID HETEROSTYLOUS SPECIES. AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY MADE A LARGE CONTRIBUTION TO FRUIT SET IN MONOMORPHIC SPECIES AND WAS ONLY RARELY OBSERVED IN HETEROSTYLOUS SPECIES.

HERE, WE INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN THIS VARIATION AND ECOLOGICAL FACTORS TO UNDERSTAND MECHANISMS GOVERNING MORPH RATIOS. WE ESTIMATED MORPH RATIOS IN 124 POPULATIONS THROUGHOUT THE RANGE OF N. TRIANDRUS AND MEASURED 13 MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS IN 35-78 POPULATIONS. SAMPLING OF MORPH RATIOS CONDUCTED OVER 2-10-YR INTERVALS DEMONSTRATED STRONG TEMPORAL STABILITY. VARIATION IN FLORAL AND VEGETATIVE TRAITS ENABLED STATISTICAL PREDICTION OF MORPH-FREQUENCY VARIATION AMONG POPULATIONS. LATITUDINAL GRADIENTS IN PRECIPITATION AND TEMPERATURE WERE CORRELATED WITH PLANT AND FLOWER SIZE, WITH LARGER FLOWERS IN NORTHERN POPULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BUMBLEBEE VISITATION AND STYLAR DIMORPHISM. FLOWERS OF THE L- AND M-MORPHS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE S-MORPH IN SEVERAL SIZE-RELATED CHARACTERS, UNLIKE OTHER TRISTYLOUS SPECIES. THIS PATTERN AND THE SIMILARITY IN ANTHER POSITIONS OF THE L- AND M-MORPHS SUGGEST THAT THE M-MORPH OF N. TRIANDRUS ORIGINATED THROUGH GENETIC MODIFIERS THAT SHORTENED STYLES OF THE L-MORPH.

PUMPKIN (CUCURBITA PEPO L.) HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO BE SERVED BY WILD POLLINATORS BECAUSE OF A RELIABLE AND WIDESPREAD GROUP OF BEE SPECIES THAT ARE COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR FLOWERS, INCLUDING BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.), AND, IN THE AMERICAS, TWO GENERA OF SPECIALIST GROUND NESTING BEES (PEPONAPIS AND XENOGLOSSA). WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SEVERAL KEY FAT-M MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND LANDSCAPE VARIABLES ON BEE ABUNDANCE IN PUMPKIN ON 20 FARMS IN VIRGINIA AND MARYLAND DURING SUMMER 2006. WE EVALUATED BEE ABUNDANCE WITH RESPECT TO TILLAGE, IRRIGATION PRACTICES, SOIL PROPERTIES, NATURAL HABITAT (FOREST AND GRASSLAND), FLOWERING CROP, AND DISTURBED AREAS. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXAMINED NEST SITE PREFERENCE (WITHIN OR OUTSIDE OF CROP AREAS) OF PEPONAPIS PRUINOSA (SAY) AT ONE FARM AND IN A LARGE SCREENHOUSE. WE FOUND P. PRUINOSA NESTING PREFERENTIALLY WITHIN CROP AREAS AND NEAR THE VINES AND LEAVES OF THEIR HOST PLANT. ALTHOUGH THESE BEES TYPICALLY PLACE SOME OF THEIR BROOD CELLS WITHIN TILLAGE DEPTH, WE DID NOT FIND A TILLAGE EFFECT ON THEIR ABUNDANCE AT FLOWERS. WE FOUND A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF SOIL CLAY CONTENT (R-2=0.24, P=0.03) AND A POSITIVE EFFECT OF IRRIGATION (F-1,F- 15=12.2, P < 0.001) ON P. PRUINOSA ABUNDANCE.

HERE WE TAKE AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH, USING BOTH FIELD AND MOLECULAR DATA, TO IDENTIFY ECOLOGICAL FACTORS IMPORTANT TO MATING PATTERNS IN NATIVE POPULATIONS OF CCV. FIELD OBSERVATION OF POLLINATOR VISITATION AND FLOWERING PHENOLOGY OF 20 TREES SHOWED THAT FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF POLLINATOR GUILDS VARIES DEPENDING ON FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND CANOPY STRUCTURE. A POSITIVE EFFECT OF TREE MEAN FLOWERING EFFORT WAS FOUND ON INSECT VISITATION, WHILE BAT VISITATION WAS PREDICTED BY TREE HEIGHT AND BY THE NUMBER OF TREES SIMULTANEOUSLY BEARING FLOWERS. MOREOVER, INTRODUCED HONEYBEES WERE OBSERVED FREQUENTLY, PERFORMING 73\% OF DETECTED FLOWER VISITS. CONVERSELY, NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS AND MAMMALS WERE OBSERVED SPORADICALLY WITH LORIKEETS AND HONEYEATERS EACH CONTRIBUTING TO 11\% OF VISITS. FRUIT BATS, REPRESENTED SOLELY BY THE GREY-HEADED FLYING FOX, PERFORMED LESS THAN 2\% OF VISITS. GENOTYPING AT SIX MICROSATELLITE MARKERS IN 301 SEEDS FROM 17 FAMILIES SAMPLED FROM FOUR OF QUEENSLAND'S NATIVE FORESTS SHOWED THAT CCV DISPLAYS A MIXED-MATING SYSTEM THAT IS MOSTLY OUTCROSSING (T(M)=0.899 +/- 0.021). PREFERENTIAL EFFECTIVE POLLINATION FROM NEAR-NEIGHBOURS WAS DETECTED BY MEANS OF MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD PATERNITY ANALYSIS WITH UP TO 16\% OF REPRODUCTION EVENTS RESULTING FROM SELFING. FORTY TO 48\% OF FERTILISING POLLEN WAS ALSO CARRIED FROM LONGER DISTANCE (>60 M). MARKED DIFFERENCES IN FORAGING BEHAVIOUR AND VISITATION FREQUENCY BETWEEN OBSERVED POLLINATOR GUILDS SUGGESTS THAT THE OBSERVED DICHOTOMY OF EFFECTIVE POLLEN MOVEMENT IN SPOTTED GUMS MAY BE DUE TO FREQUENT VISIT FROM INTRODUCED HONEYBEES FAVOURING GEITONOGAMY AND SPORADIC VISITS FROM HONEYEATERS AND FRUIT BATS RESULTING IN POTENTIAL LONG-DISTANCE POLLINATIONS.",CONTEMPORARY GENE FLOW; CORYMBIA; EUCALYPT; MATING SYSTEM; POLLINATOR VISITATION; REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY; SPOTTED GUMS,NEW-SOUTH-WALES; GENE FLOW; MYRTACEAE; PLANTATIONS; HONEYBEES; SOFTWARE; MARKERS; TREES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"BACLES, CFE (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STIRLING, SCH BIOL \& ENVIRONM SCI, STIRLING FK9 4LA, SCOTLAND.;BACLES, C.

WE EXAMINED HOW PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PLANT DIVERSITY, NESTING SUITABILITY, CANOPY COVER, LAND USE, AND FIRE HISTORY AFFECTED BEE DISTRIBUTION ACROSS AN OPEN-FOREST GRADIENT IN NORTHWEST INDIANA, USA, A GRADIENT SIMILAR TO THE HISTORIC MIDWEST UNITED STATES LANDSCAPE MOSAIC. WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THE OTHER PREDICTORS, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. BEE ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CANOPY COVER AND POSITIVELY TO RECENT FIRE FREQUENCY, BEE RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF POTENTIAL NESTING RESOURCES, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS, SOIL CHARACTERISTICS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO NESTING SUITABILITY, AND CANOPY COVER. THUS, BEE ABUNDANCE WAS PREDICTED BY A DIFFERENT SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN WAS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS PREDICTED, IN LARGE PART, BY A COMBINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. DIFFERENCES IN BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION ALONG THE WOODY VEGETATION GRADIENT WERE CORRELATED WITH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF OLIGOLECTIC, OR DIET SPECIALIST, BEES. BECAUSE OLIGOLEGES WERE RARER THAN DIET GENERALISTS AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN HABITATS, THEIR POPULATIONS MAY BE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY DEGRADATION OF OPEN HABITATS. MORE HABITAT-SPECIALIST BEES WERE DOCUMENTED FOR OPEN AND FOREST/SCRUB HABITATS THAN FOR SAVANNA/WOODLAND HABITATS, CONSISTENT WITH BEES RESPONDING TO HABITATS OF INTERMEDIATE WOODY VEGETATION DENSITY, SUCH AS SAVANNAS, AS ECOTONES RATHER THAN AS DISTINCT HABITAT TYPES. SIMILARITY OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, SIMILARITY OF BEE ABUNDANCE, AND SIMILARITY OF BEE RICHNESS BETWEEN SITES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PROXIMITY OF SITES TO EACH OTHER. NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SPECIES COMPOSITION IN SPECIES-POOR SITES WAS NOT MERELY A SUBSET OF SPECIES COMPOSITION AT RICHER SITES. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT PROXIMITY OR NESTEDNESS EFFECTS SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS AT A SMALL SPATIAL SCALE STRONGLY INFLUENCE BEES' USE OF SITES.

ENERGETIC INVESTMENTS MAY BE EXPENSIVE, SO SOME SPECIES SUCH AS PROSOPIS GLANDULOSA HAVE DEVELOPED A DIMORPHIC SYSTEM OF NECTAR PRODUCTION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT FLORAL VISITOR BEHAVIOUR AND THEN PLANT FITNESS. WE QUANTIFIED BEE DIVERSITY DURING A 2 YEAR PERIOD IN A POPULATION OF THE HONEY MESQUITE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN BEE DIVERSITY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NECTAR, BEE PREFERENCES TO COLLECT EITHER NECTAR OF POLLEN, AND TO DETERMINE BETWEEN YEAR VARIATIONS OF BEE FAUNAS.

LARGER GLAND AREA AND INCREASED POTENTIAL FOR SELF-POLLINATION DIRECTLY INCREASED THE SEED PRODUCTION OF INDIVIDUAL BLOSSOMS. HOWEVER, BRACT SIZE OR FLOWER-POLLINATOR FIT DID NOT INFLUENCE THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PRODUCED BY BLOSSOMS.

IN ORDER FOR GYNODIOECY TO EVOLVE FROM HERMAPHRODITISM, THE CARRIERS OF A MALE-STERILITY MUTATION (I.E., FEMALES) MUST OVERCOME TWO MAJOR HURDLES: FEMALES MUST ATTRACT POLLINATORS WITHOUT OFFERING POLLEN AS A REWARD, AND THEY MUST PRODUCE ENOUGH SEEDS TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LOSS OF REPRODUCTION THROUGH THE PATERNAL ROUTE. WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF FEMALE AND HERMAPHRODITIC PLANTS IN A GREENHOUSE STUDY OF MIMULUS GUTTATUS ORIGINATING FROM A LARGELY HERMAPHRODITIC POPULATION. FEMALES HAD LARGER FLORAL DISPLAYS THAN DID HERMAPHRODITES, WITH 5\% WIDER COROLLAS AND 34\% MORE FLOWERS OPEN AT ONE TIME. THEY ALSO PRODUCED 22\% MORE FLOWERS OVER A LIFETIME AND 25\% MORE OVULES PER OVARY THAN HERMAPHRODITES, GIVING FEMALES 1.53 TIMES MORE MATERNAL REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL. IN A RELATED EXPERIMENT, BUMBLEBEES VISITED FEMALE PLANTS JUST AS FREQUENTLY AS HERMAPHRODITIC PLANTS, EVEN THOUGH THE FEMALES OFFERED NO POLLEN REWARD. ALTHOUGH THE RELATIVE ADVANTAGES ENJOYED BY FEMALES MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THE OBSTACLES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF STABLE GYNODIOECY, THEY MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO EXPLAIN THE MAINTENANCE OF GENETIC VARIATION FOR MALE-STERILITY ALLELES OFTEN OBSERVED IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF M.

AT EACH SITE, 12 BELT TRANSECTS OF 100 M LENGTH AND 2 M WIDTH WERE ESTABLISHED. THE SELECTED SITES RANGED FROM RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED PRIMARY TO LATE SECONDARY FORESTS, BUSH LANDS AND THE SURROUNDING FARMING AREAS. A TOTAL OF 4,485 INDIVIDUALS WERE IDENTIFIED OUT OF 234 SPECIES OF BEE IN FOUR FAMILIES. A RENYI DIVERSITY INDEX WAS USED TO ANALYSE BEE DIVERSITY. ONE-WAY MEASURES OF ANOVA WERE CALCULATED FOR BEE DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RICHNESS, WITH STUDY SITES AND YEAR AS INDEPENDENT FACTORS. THE HIGHEST SPECIES RICHNESS AND BEE DIVERSITY WERE RECORDED IN THE OPEN AREAS FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY FORESTS WHILE EVENNESS WAS HIGHER IN FORESTED SITES. THERE WAS A GENERAL SIMILARITY BETWEEN SITES IN BEE SPECIES COMPOSITION, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN THOSE OF ALMOST SIMILAR VEGETATION STRUCTURE. THIS SIMILARITY WAS SUSPECTED TO HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS IN PROMOTING CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF ECOLOGICAL RESILIENCE OF BEES IN TROPICAL ECOSYSTEMS.

PLANT SCI.,"RHODODENDRON AUREUM IS A WEAKLY SELF-COMPATIBLE ALPINE SHRUB POLLINATED BY BUMBLEBEES. FLOWER VISITATION FREQUENCY AND FORAGING BEHAVIOR DIFFERED BETWEEN QUEEN BUMBLEBEES AND WORKERS. QUEENS EXHIBITED LESS FREQUENT FLOWER VISITS, LONGER FLIGHT DISTANCES BETWEEN INFLORESCENCES, AND A SMALLER NUMBER OF SEQUENTIAL INFLORESCENCE VISITS WITHIN PATCHES THAN DID WORKER BEES. FLOWERING IN EARLY-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS OCCURRED IN JUNE, WHEN ONLY OVERWINTERED QUEENS WERE AVAILABLE, WHILE FLOWERING IN LATE-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS OCCURRED FROM LATE JULY TO AUGUST, WHEN FREQUENT VISITS BY WORKERS WERE COMMON. THE FRUIT TO FLOWER RATIO PER INFLORESCENCE WAS LOWER IN EARLY-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS DUE TO QUANTITATIVE POLLEN LIMITATION, WHILE THE SEED TO OVULE RATIO PER FRUIT WAS LOWER IN LATE-SNOWMELT POPULATIONS.

MARTII, EMPHASIZING REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND ASSOCIATION WITH OLIGOLECTIC POLLINATORS. THE YELLOW FLOWERS BEAR A CENTRAL CONE OF STAMINODES THAT ENCLOSES THE FERTILE STAMENS AND FOUR FREE CARPELS. THE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE SPECIES DEPENDS ON POLLINATORS TO SET FRUITS. IN 25 TEMPORARY WATER BODIES IN FIVE BRAZILIAN STATES, PROTODISCELIS PALPALIS BEES (COLLETIDAE, PARACOLLETINAE) WERE THE UNIQUE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS OF H. MARTII AND, IN 18 OF THESE, THE SOLE FLOWER VISITORS. FEMALES OF THIS NARROWLY OLIGOLECTIC SPECIES SHOW ADAPTED BEHAVIOUR TO ACCESS THE POLLEN CHAMBER IN THE FLOWER CENTRE. FEMALES REMOVED MORE THAN 80\% OF THE 480 000 POLLEN GRAINS IN ONLY 2 H FROM THE FLOWERS BUT MAINTAINED A HIGH VISITATION FREQUENCY ALMOST UNTIL FLOWER SENESCENCE. IN THIS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR SYSTEM, ON AVERAGE, 1.6\% OF THE POLLEN GRAINS REACHED THE STIGMATIC SURFACE AND 9.6\% REMAINED UNCOLLECTIBLE IN THE FLOWERS. IN THE ABSENCE OF P. PALPALIS, FLOWERS SET ALMOST NO SEEDS, INDICATING REPRODUCTIVE DEPENDENCE ON THE OLIGOLECTIC SPECIES.

WE FOUND A NARROW TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN PLANTS DIFFERING BY THREE-FOLD IN PERIANTH TUBE LENGTH. WE DETERMINED WHETHER STRONG GENE-FLOW BARRIERS RESULT FROM ASSORTATIVE MATING ARISING FROM DIFFERENT POLLINATORS, A HIGH PREVALENCE OF SELFING, OR POST-POLLINATION INCOMPATIBILITIES BETWEEN PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT TUBE LENGTHS. WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ASSORTATIVE MATING THROUGH DIFFERENT POLLINATORS. BOTH SHORT-AND LONG-TUBED PLANTS WERE MAINLY VISITED BY BEES WITH SHORT PROBOSCIDES. SELFING IS UNLIKELY TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO SEED SET, PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT TUBE LENGTHS WERE INTERFERTILE AND HYBRID PLANTS WERE FERTILE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE CONTACT ZONE IS UNSTABLE BECAUSE THESE ECOTYPES HAVE NOT ACCRUED ENOUGH ALLOPATRIC DIFFERENCES TO TRANSLATE INTO STRONG GENE-FLOW BARRIERS, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, BIMODALITY IS NOT A CONSEQUENCE OF SECONDARY CONTACT BUT THE RESULT OF A NOVEL MUTATION FOR SHORT TUBES SPREADING THROUGH A LONG-TUBED POPULATION.

THE DIOECIOUS CLUSIA NEMOROSA (CLUSIACEAE) PRODUCES FLORAL RESIN, A SPECIALIZED REWARD FOR RESIN-COLLECTING BEES. IT ALSO EXHIBITS FLORAL AUTOMIMICRY WITH FEMALE FLOWERS MIMICKING MALE FLOWERS IN ORDER TO ATTRACT POLLEN-COLLECTING INSECTS. WE OBSERVED THE HOURLY VISITATION FREQUENCY AND BEHAVIOUR OF BEE VISITORS ON TWO ROCK SAVANNA SITES IN FRENCH GUIANA. THE MAJOR STRATEGY IN POLLEN TRANSFER AND THE VARIATION IN VISITATION RATES AMONG VISITOR SPECIES WERE EXAMINED. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE VISITATION RATE WILL VARY BETWEEN THE FLORAL SEXES AND DEGREE OF THIS VARIATION WILL DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO-REWARD SYSTEMS. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE FOR VISITS BEING EXCLUSIVELY RELATED TO RESIN COLLECTION, WHICH WE EXPECTED TO BE THE PRINCIPAL STRATEGY IN POLLEN TRANSFER. DECEIT POLLINATION APPEARED TO HAVE MINOR IMPORTANCE AND SEEMED TO BE LOCALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SITE, WHERE DEMAND FOR POLLEN WAS GREATER. FLOWER VISITS THAT PROBABLY FACILITATED MOST POLLEN TRANSFER, COMBINED RESIN AND POLLEN. THE POLLINATORS INVOLVED IN THIS SYSTEM COLLECTED POLLEN FROM MALE FLOWERS AND RESIN FROM FEMALE FLOWERS. THE FRUIT SET WAS NOT PARTICULARLY LOW (44.19\%) SO OFFERING DIFFERENT REWARDS BY DIFFERENT FLOWER GENDERS HAS NOT CONSTRAINED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN THIS SYSTEM. PRONOUNCED VARIATION IN VISITATION RATES BETWEEN SEXES WAS NOT RELATED TO THE POLLINATION MECHANISMS BUT TO THE DEMAND FOR THE TWO REWARDS. OVERALL DEMAND FOR POLLEN WAS GREATER THAN DEMAND FOR RESIN. FEMALE FLOWERS WERE VISITED MUCH LESS FREQUENTLY THAN MALE FLOWERS. PEAK POLLEN COLLECTION OCCURRED IN THE MORNING, I.E., AS SOON AS THE RESOURCE WAS AVAILABLE, WHILE RESIN WAS COLLECTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SERAPIAS SPECIES HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IS BASED ON PRE-POLLINATION BARRIERS, THAT SECRETORY CELLS AND TRICHOMES ARE TYPICALLY DISTRIBUTED ON THE FLORAL LABELLUM AND THAT FLOWERS PRODUCE ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS. IN THIS STUDY WE COMPARE THE FLORAL SCENT COMPOSITION OF FOUR WIDESPREAD, CO-OCCURRING SERAPIAS SPECIES, NAMELY SERAPIAS LINGUA, SERAPIAS PARVIFLORA, SERAPIAS VOMERACEA AND SERAPIAS CORDIGERA. OUR GOALS ARE TO ASSESS IF DIFFERENCES IN FLORAL SCENT MAY ACT AS INTERSPECIFIC PRE-POLLINATION BARRIERS AND IF THESE OLFACTORY SIGNALS MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE POLLINATION STRATEGY OF SERAPIAS.

IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT, WORKERS WERE FED ONE SUBLETHAL DOSE OF CONTAMINATED HONEY SOLUTION AND PLACED IN MICROCOLONIES TO ASSESS IMPACTS ON FEEDING, LIFE SPAN, AND REPRODUCTION. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF DELTAMETHRIN (17 MG A.I./L) REDUCED FEEDING. WORKERS TREATED WITH DELTAMETHRIN HAD SHORTENED LIFE SPANS AND PRODUCED FEWER MALES. FLUBENDIAMIDE (2000 MG A.I./L) AND SPINETORAM (0.8 MG A.I./L) CAUSED NO SUBLETHAL EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT FLUBENDIAMIDE SHOULD BE SAFE TO APPLY TO BLUEBERRIES WHERE B.

TARSATA AN OLIGOLECTIC OR POLYLECTIC SPECIES? ZOOLOGICAL STUDIES 51(2): 195-203. AMONG POLLINATOR SPECIES, BEES PLAY A PROMINENT ROLE IN MAINTAINING BIODIVERSITY BECAUSE THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE, ON AVERAGE, FOR 80\% OF ANGIOSPERM POLLINATION IN TROPICAL REGIONS. THE SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE BEE GENUS CENTRIS IS HIGH IN SOUTH AMERICA. IN BRAZIL, THESE BEES OCCUR IN MANY TYPES OF ECOSYSTEMS. CENTRIS TARSATA IS AN ENDEMIC SPECIES OCCURRING ONLY IN BRAZIL. NO PREVIOUS STUDIES CONSIDERED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PLANTS AND THIS BEE SPECIES IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL, WHERE IT IS THE MOST ABUNDANT TRAP-NESTING BEE. ACCORDINGLY, THE GOALS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE PLANTS USED BY THIS SPECIES FOR ITS LARVAL FOOD SUPPLY AND DETERMINE IF THIS BEE IS POLYLECTIC OR OLIGOLECTIC IN THIS REGION. THIS WORK WAS CONDUCTED IN THE PARQUE MUNICIPAL DAS ARAUCARIAS, GUARAPUAVA (PR), SOUTHERN BRAZIL, FROM MAR. 2002 TO DEC. 2003. SAMPLES OF POLLEN WERE COLLECTED FROM NESTS OF THESE BEES AND FROM FLOWERING PLANTS IN GRASSLAND AND SWAMP AREAS WHERE THE NESTS WERE BUILT. ALL OF THE SAMPLES WERE TREATED WITH ACETOLYSIS TO OBTAIN PERMANENT SLIDES. THE FAMILY SOLANACEAE WAS VISITED MOST OFTEN (71\%). SOLANUM AMERICANUM MILL. (28.6\%) AND SOL. VARIABILE MART. (42.4\%) WERE THE PRIMARY POLLEN SOURCES FOR C. TARSATA IN THE STUDY AREA. WE FOUND THAT ALTHOUGH C. TARSATA VISITED 20 SPECIES OF PLANTS, IT PREFERRED SOLANUM SPECIES WITH PORICIDAL ANTHERS AND POLLEN GRAINS WITH HIGH PROTEIN LEVELS. THIS SELECTIVE BEHAVIOR BY FEMALES OF C.

ECOL.,"THE PRIMARY FUNCTION OF SECONDARY PLANT METABOLITES IS THOUGHT TO BE DEFENCE AGAINST HERBIVORES. THE FREQUENT OCCURRENCE OF THESE SAME NOXIOUS COMPOUNDS IN FLORAL NECTAR, WHICH FUNCTIONS PRIMARILY TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS, HAS BEEN SEEN AS PARADOXICAL. ALTHOUGH THESE COMPOUNDS MAY HAVE AN ADAPTIVE PURPOSE IN NECTAR, THEY MAY ALSO OCCUR AS A NONADAPTIVE CONSEQUENCE OF CHEMICAL DEFENCE IN OTHER PLANT PARTS. IF NECTAR CHEMISTRY REFLECTS PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS OR PASSIVE LEAKAGE FROM OTHER TISSUES, WE EXPECT THAT THE IDENTITY AND RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF NECTAR CARDENOLIDES TO BE CORRELATED WITH THOSE OF OTHER PLANT PARTS, IN CONTRAST, DISCORDANT DISTRIBUTIONS OF COMPOUNDS IN NECTAR AND OTHER TISSUES MAY SUGGEST ADAPTIVE ROLES IN NECTAR. WE COMPARED THE CONCENTRATIONS AND IDENTITIES OF CARDENOLIDES IN THE NECTAR, LEAVES AND FLOWERS OF 12 SPECIES FROM A MONOPHYLETIC CLADE OF ASCLEPIAS. TO MEASURE PUTATIVE TOXICITY OF NECTAR CARDENOLIDES, WE THEN EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A STANDARD CARDENOLIDE (DIGOXIN) ON THE BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES, A COMMON GENERALIST POLLINATOR OF ASCLEPIAS. WE FOUND THAT THE AVERAGE CARDENOLIDE CONCENTRATIONS IN NECTAR, LEAVES AND FLOWERS OF THE 12 ASCLEPIAS SPECIES WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED AS PREDICTED BY NONADAPTIVE HYPOTHESES. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE IDENTITIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL CARDENOLIDES BETWEEN NECTAR AND LEAVES SUGGEST THAT THE PRODUCTION OR ALLOCATION OF CARDENOLIDES MAY BE INDEPENDENTLY REGULATED AT EACH PLANT PART.

ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENTS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE PROMOTING SMALL-SCALE RESTORATION ON WORKING FARMS, THERE ARE FEW STUDIES THAT ASSESS WHETHER THESE PRACTICES ENHANCE POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES IN RESTORED AREAS. FURTHER, THERE IS NO INFORMATION ON WHETHER FLORAL ENHANCEMENTS WILL DEPLETE POLLINATORS IN ADJACENT FIELDS BY CONCENTRATING AMBIENT POPULATIONS OR WHETHER THEY RESULT IN A NET INCREASE IN ABUNDANCE IN ADJACENT FARM FIELDS. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER FIELD EDGES RESTORED WITH NATIVE PERENNIAL PLANTS IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL VALLEY AGRICULTURAL REGION INCREASED FLORAL ABUNDANCE AND POTENTIAL BEE NESTING SITES, AND NATIVE BEE AND SYRPHID FLY ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY, IN COMPARISON TO RELATIVELY UNMANAGED EDGES.

IT WAS REMOVED FROM HEAVILY INFESTED RIPARIAN FORESTS OF THE GEORGIA PIEDMONT IN 2005 BY MULCHING MACHINE OR CHAINSAW FELLING AND SUBSEQUENT HERBICIDE APPLICATION. ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF BEES AND BUTTERFLIES WERE SAMPLED USING PAN TRAPS ON REMOVAL PLOTS, HEAVILY INVADED CONTROL PLOTS, AND REFERENCE PLOTS IN 2012, APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS AFTER COMPLETE REMOVAL OF PRIVET. REMOVAL PLOTS HAD NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MANY SPECIES AS CONTROL PLOTS AND WERE SIMILAR TO REFERENCE PLOTS IN NUMBERS OF SPECIES. TRAPS ON REMOVAL PLOTS CAPTURED FOUR TIMES MORE INDIVIDUALS THAN THOSE ON CONTROL PLOTS AND SIMILAR NUMBERS TO REFERENCE PLOTS.

SCHIMA WALLICHII IS A HIGHLY VALUABLE TREE OF TROPICAL FOREST IN NORTH-EAST HIMALAYA REGION THAT GROWS NATURALLY IN A WIDE RANGE OF ALTITUDES BETWEEN 750 AND 2400 M ASL WITH VARYING ENVIRONMENTS. FLOWERING PHENOLOGY OF TROPICAL TREE SPECIES AT POPULATION LEVEL IS GENERALLY IGNORED AND THEREFORE A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF FLOWERING AND FRUITING PATTERNS OF IMPORTANT MULTIPURPOSE TREE SPECIES IS CRITICAL TO THE SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF FOREST GENETIC RESOURCES. MATERIALS AND METHODS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO DIFFERENT ALTITUDES (I.E., 750 M AND 900 M ASL) IN THE TROPICAL SEMIDECIDUOUS FOREST OF NORTH-EAST HIMALAYA. THE FLORAL PHENOLOGY INCLUDING FLOWERING SYNCHRONY IN THE POPULATIONS, ANTHESIS, ANTHER DEHISCENCE, STIGMA RECEPTIVITY, POLLINATORS VISITATION FREQUENCY, AND MATING SYSTEM INCLUDING INDEX OF SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY WERE WORKED OUT IN SCHIMA WALLICHII ACCORDING TO THE EAR-MARKED STANDARD METHODS GIVEN BY VARIOUS SCIENTISTS FOR EACH PARAMETER. RESULTS. THE FLOWERING PERIOD IN SCHIMA WALLICHII VARIED FROM 33 TO 42 DAYS WITH MEAN SYNCHRONY OF 0.54 TO 0.68 BETWEEN THE POPULATIONS. THE STIGMA WAS RECEPTIVE UP TO 2.5 DAYS ONLY AND SHOWED SLIGHTLY PROTANDROUS TYPE OF DICHOGAMY. AVERAGE POLLEN PRODUCTION RANGED BETWEEN 6.90 X 10(7) POLLEN PER TREE IN 2007 AND 15.49 X 10(8) POLLEN PER TREE IN 2011. A THREE-YEAR MASTING CYCLE WAS NOTICED IN THIS SPECIES. THE FREQUENCY OF VISITATION OF HONEY BEES WAS FAIRLY HIGH (5.2 +/- 1.12 VISITS/FLOWER/HOUR) AS COMPARED TO OTHER POLLINATORS. THE HAND POLLINATION REVEALED MAXIMUM FRUIT (74.2 +/- 5.72\%) AND SEED (70.8 +/- 7.46\%) SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS. THE VARIATION IN FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND POLLEN YIELD INDIVIDUALLY AND ANNUALLY ALONG WITH TEMPORAL SEPARATION IN ANTHER DEHISCENCE AND POLLINATOR'S VISITATION CAUSE POLLEN LIMITED REPRODUCTION, WHICH ULTIMATELY INFLUENCES THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SCHIMA WALLICHII.",NA,SEED PRODUCTION; REPRODUCTIVE-BIOLOGY; FOREST; PATTERNS; DENSITY; CONSEQUENCES; MECHANISMS; SYNCHRONY; SELECTION; ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"SHARMA, CM (REPRINT AUTHOR), HNB GARHWAL UNIV, DEPT BOT, SRINAGAR, UTTARAKHAND, INDIA.;KHANDURI, VINOD PRASAD, KUMAR, K.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"BEES PROVIDE AN ESSENTIAL POLLINATION SERVICE FOR CROPS AND WILD PLANTS. HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN BEE POPULATIONS AND DIVERSITY HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA FOR THE PAST 50 YEARS, PARTLY DUE TO THE LOSS OF NATURAL HABITATS AND REDUCTION OF PLANT DIVERSITY RESULTING FROM AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION. TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, AGRI-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEMES (AES) HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO SUSTAIN BEES AND OTHERS POLLINATORS IN AGROSYSTEMS. AES INCLUDE THE PRESERVATION OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS SUCH AS GRASSLANDS, FALLOWS, WOODLOTS, HEDGEROWS OR SET-ASIDE FIELD MARGINS. HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF THOSE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS BY BEES MAY VARY GREATLY AMONG BEE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS AND MAY FURTHER BE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALTERNATIVE FORAGING HABITATS SUCH AS MASS-FLOWERING CROPS. THE PRESENT STUDY SETS OUT TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE THREE BEE GROUPS TYPICALLY TARGETED BY AES (HONEY BEES, BUMBLE BEES AND OTHER WILD BEES) DIFFER IN THE WAY THEY USE THOSE SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS RELATIVE TO COMMON MASS-FLOWERING CROPS (OILSEED RAPE, SUNFLOWER, ALFALFA) IN AN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL FARMING SYSTEM. A CLEAR SEGREGATION PATTERN IN THE USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES APPEARED BETWEEN HONEY BEES AND WILD BEES, WITH THE FORMER BEING TIGHTLY ASSOCIATED WITH MASS-FLOWERING CROPS AND THE LATTER WITH SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS. BUMBLE BEES HAD AN INTERMEDIATE STRATEGY AND BEHAVED AS HABITAT GENERALISTS.

APPL.,"LANDSCAPE-WIDE MASS-FLOWERING OF OILSEED RAPE (CANOLA BRASSICA NAPUS) CAN CONSIDERABLY AFFECT WILD BEE COMMUNITIES AND POLLINATION SUCCESS OF WILD PLANTS. WE AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF OILSEED RAPE ON THE POLLINATION OF WILD PLANTS AND BEE ABUNDANCE DURING AND AFTER OILSEED-RAPE BLOOM, INCLUDING EFFECTS ON CROP-NONCROP SPILLOVER AT LANDSCAPE AND ADJACENT-FIELD SCALES. WE FOCUSED ON TWO SHRUB SPECIES (HAWTHORN CRATAEGUS SPP., DOG ROSE ROSA CANINA) AND ADJACENT HERB FLOWERING IN FOREST EDGES, CONNECTED HEDGES, AND ISOLATED HEDGES IN LOWER SAXONY, GERMANY. WE SELECTED 35 LANDSCAPE CIRCLES OF 1 KM RADIUS, DIFFERING IN THE AMOUNT OF OILSEED RAPE, 18 WERE ADJACENT TO OILSEED RAPE AND 17 TO CEREAL FIELDS, AND WE QUANTIFIED BEE DENSITY VIA PAN TRAPS AT ALL SITES. ADJACENT OILSEED RAPE POSITIVELY AFFECTED FRUIT MASS AND SEED NUMBER PER FRUIT OF SIMULTANEOUSLY FLOWERING HAWTHORN (NO EFFECT ON DOG ROSE, WHICH FLOWERS AFTER THE OILSEED RAPE BLOOM). AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, OILSEED RAPE HAD A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON BUMBLE BEE DENSITY IN THE HEDGES DURING FLOWERING DUE TO DILUTION OF POLLINATORS PER UNIT AREA AND THE CONSEQUENTLY INTENSIFIED COMPETITION BETWEEN OILSEED RAPE AND WILD SHRUBS, BUT A POSITIVE EFFECT AFTER FLOWERING WHEN BEES MOVED TO THE HEDGES, WHICH STILL PROVIDED RESOURCES. IN CONTRAST, POSITIVE LANDSCAPE-SCALE EFFECTS OF OILSEED RAPE WERE FOUND THROUGHOUT THE SEASON IN FOREST EDGES, SUGGESTING THAT EDGES SUPPORT NESTING ACTIVITY AND ENHANCED FOOD RESOURCES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT OILSEED RAPE EFFECTS ON BEE ABUNDANCES AND POLLINATION SUCCESS IN SEMINATURAL HABITATS DEPEND ON THE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALE CONSIDERED AND ON THE HABITAT TYPE, THE WILD PLANT SPECIES, AND THE TIME OF CROP FLOWERING. THESE SCALE-DEPENDENT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATIONS OF LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONFIGURATION AND COMPOSITION OF CROPS. FOOD RESOURCES PROVIDED BY MASS-FLOWERING CROPS SHOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL FOR LANDSCAPE-WIDE ENHANCEMENT OF WILD BEE POPULATIONS IF SEMINATURAL HABITATS ARE AVAILABLE, PROVIDING (1) NESTING RESOURCES AND (2) CONTINUOUS FLOWERING RESOURCES DURING THE SEASON.",BUMBLE BEE; BOMBUS SPP; CANOLA; DOG ROSE; ROSA CANINA; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; FRUIT SET; GOTTINGEN; GERMANY; HAWTHORN; CRATAEGUS SPP; ISOLATION; OILSEED RAPE; BRASSICA NAPUS; SCALE DEPENDENCY,OILSEED RAPE; LANDSCAPE SCALE; FORAGING RANGES; BUMBLE BEES; FRUIT-SET; REPRODUCTION; CONSERVATION; DIVERSITY; DENSITIES; ABUNDANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,47,"KOVACS-HOSTYANSZKI, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), MTA OK, LENDULET ECOSYST SERV RES GRP, ALKOTMANY UT 2-4, H-2163 VACRATOT, HUNGARY.;KOVACS-HOSTYANSZKI, ANIKO, BALDI, ANDRAS, MTA OK, LENDULET ECOSYST SERV RES GRP, H-2163 VACRATOT, HUNGARY.;KOVACS-HOSTYANSZKI, ANIKO, HAENKE, SEBASTIAN, BATARY, PETER, TSCHARNTKE, TEJA, HOLZSCHUH, ANDREA, UNIV GOTTINGEN, DEPT CROP SCI, D-37077 GOTTINGEN, GERMANY.;BATARY, PETER, MTA ELTE MTM ECOL RES GRP, H-1088 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY.;JAUKER, BIRGIT, UNIV GIESSEN, DEPT ANIM ECOL, D-35392 GIESSEN, GERMANY.;HOLZSCHUH, ANDREA, UNIV WURZBURG, DEPT ANIM ECOL \& TROP BIOL, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.",10.1890/12-2012.1,"1990 M STREET NW, STE 700, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",NA,DAADDEUTSCHER AKADEMISCHER AUSTAUSCH DIENST (DAAD); HUNGARIAN EOTVOS SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION; ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT FOUNDATIONALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT FOUNDATION; GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATIONGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [DFG BA 4438/1-1]; GERMAN MINISTRY OF RESEARCH AND EDUCATION (BMBF)FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION \& RESEARCH (BMBF); GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG)GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG); EUROPEAN COMMUNITYEUROPEAN COMMUNITY (EC) [244 090]; HUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCESHUNGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES; OTKA PROJECTORSZAGOS TUDOMANYOS KUTATASI ALAPPROGRAMOK (OTKA) [101940],"WE THANK MARTIN LUDWIG AND HELLA SCHLINKERT FOR THEIR HELP WITH THE VEGETATION SURVEY, AND FIVE REVIEWERS FOR THEIR VALUABLE COMMENTS ON A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE MANUSCRIPT.

ECOL.,"PROTECTING SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS MAY THROUGH SPILL-OVER BENEFIT SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS IN LINEAR HABITATS, SUCH AS UNCULTIVATED FIELD BOUNDARIES, IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, WHETHER LOCAL DIVERSITY INCREASES BOTH WITH DECREASING DISTANCE FROM POTENTIAL SOURCE HABITATS AND INCREASING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY IS POORLY KNOWN DUE TO A GENERAL LACK OF STUDIES REPLICATED AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. WE ANALYSED IF LOCAL ASSEMBLAGES OF BUMBLEBEES, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES IN LINEAR UNCULTIVATED HABITATS INCREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND IN 12 REPLICATED LANDSCAPES ALONG A GRADIENT OF LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY IN SCANIA, SOUTHERN SWEDEN. SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF BUMBLEBEES AND BUTTERFLIES, BUT NOT HOVERFLIES, DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, BUT NONE OF THESE GROUPS WERE RELATED TO INCREASING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY. FURTHER ANALYSES ON TRAIT-SPECIFIC GROUPS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF SEDENTARY AND GRASSLAND SPECIALIST BUTTERFLIES WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO ASSUMED SOURCE POPULATIONS, WHEREAS THIS WAS NOT THE CASE CONCERNING MOBILE SPECIES AND GRASSLAND GENERALISTS. THE ABUNDANCE OF ALL BUMBLEBEE TRAIT GROUPS DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS, BUT ONLY SOME SPECIES (THOSE NESTING ABOVE GROUND, WITH LONG COLONY CYCLES AND WITH SMALL COLONY SIZES) ALSO INCREASED WITH INCREASING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY. WE CONCLUDE THAT LOCAL SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES OF FLOWER-VISITING INSECTS IN LINEAR HABITAT ELEMENTS WERE MAINLY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF NEARBY SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLANDS.

THIS VARIATION IN VISITOR SPECIES COMPOSITION COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON POLLINATION SUCCESS AND PLANT FITNESS BUT IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, ESPECIALLY IN THE MANY POLLINATION GUILDS DOMINATED BY NONTERRITORIAL SPECIES. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A FORAGING MODEL THAT EXPLORES HOW FLOWER VISITORS WITH DIVERSE TRAITS SHOULD DISTRIBUTE THEMSELVES ACROSS RESOURCE PATCHES DIFFERING IN FLORAL DENSITY. THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT SPECIES WITH LOW FLOWER SEARCH SPEEDS AND LOW FLOWER HANDLING COSTS COMPARED TO THOSE OF COMPETITORS WILL USUALLY DOMINATE DENSE FLOWER PATCHES. IN ADDITION, AMONG FLOWER VISITORS THAT HAVE LOWER ENERGY EXPENDITURE RATES WHILE HANDLING FLOWERS THAN WHILE TRAVELING, SPECIES MAXIMIZING ENERGETIC EFFICIENCY ARE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DENSE FLOWER PATCHES, WHEREAS THOSE MAXIMIZING NET RATE OF ENERGY INTAKE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SPARSE PATCHES. THE MODEL IS ABLE TO PREDICT SOME KEY ASPECTS OF A PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED EFFECT OF FLORAL DENSITY ON SPECIES COMPOSITION OF FLOWER VISITORS TO THE YELLOWFLOWER TARWEED (HOLOCARPHA VIRGATA).

GOTTSBERGER G,GOTTSBERGER G,EVOLUTIONARY STEPS IN THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ANNONACEAE,REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FRUTICULTURA,REV. BRAS. FRUTIC.,"FLOWERS OF ANNONACEAE ARE CHARACTERIZED BY FLESHY PETALS, MANY STAMENS WITH HARD CONNECTIVE SHIELDS AND NUMEROUS CARPELS WITH SESSILE STIGMAS OFTEN COVERED BY STICKY SECRETIONS. THE PETALS OF MANY REPRESENTATIVES DURING ANTHESIS FORM A CLOSED POLLINATION CHAMBER. PROTOGYNOUS DICHOGAMY WITH STRONG SCENT EMISSIONS ESPECIALLY DURING THE PISTILLATE STAGE IS A CHARACTER OF NEARLY ALL SPECIES. SCENT EMISSIONS CAN BE ENHANCED BY THERMOGENESIS. THE PREVAILING REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IN THE FAMILY SEEMS TO BE SELF-COMPATIBILITY. THE BASAL GENUS ANAXAGOREA BESIDES EXHIBITING SEVERAL ANCESTRAL MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS HAS ALSO MANY CHARACTERS WHICH REAPPEAR IN OTHER GENERA. STRONG FRUIT-LIKE SCENTS CONSISTING OF FRUIT-ESTERS AND ALCOHOLS MAINLY ATTRACT SMALL FRUIT-BEETLES (GENUS COLOPTERUS, NITIDULIDAE) AS POLLINATORS, AS WELL AS SEVERAL OTHER BEETLES (CURCULIONIDAE, CHRYSOMELIDAE) AND FRUIT-FLIES (DROSOPHILIDAE), WHICH THEMSELVES GNAW ON THE THICK PETALS OR THEIR LARVAE ARE PETAL OR OVULE PREDATORS. THE FLOWERS AND THE THICK PETALS ARE THUS A FLORAL BROOD SUBSTRATE FOR THE VISITORS AND THE THICK PETALS OF ANAXAGOREA HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED AS AN ANTIPREDATOR STRUCTURE. ANOTHER FUNCTION OF THE CLOSED THICK PETALS IS THE PRODUCTION OF HEAT BY ACCUMULATED STARCH, WHICH ENHANCES SCENT EMISSION AND PROVIDES A WARM SHELTER FOR THE ATTRACTED BEETLES. INSIGHT INTO FLORAL CHARACTERS AND FLORAL ECOLOGY OF ANAXAGOREA, THE SISTER GROUP OF THE REST OF THE ANNONACEAE, IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING FUNCTIONAL EVOLUTION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE. AS BEETLE POLLINATION (CANTHAROPHILY) IS PLESIOMORPHIC IN ANAXAGOREA AND IN ANNONACEAE, CHARACTERS ASSOCIATED WITH BEETLE POLLINATION APPEAR IMPRINTED IN MEMBERS OF THE WHOLE FAMILY. POLLINATION BY BEETLES (CANTHAROPHILY) IS THE PREDOMINANT MODE OF THE MAJORITY OF SPECIES WORLDWIDE.

INSECT CONSERV.,"BEE SPECIES DIVERSITY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FOUR SAMPLING METHODS WERE INVESTIGATED IN A WEST-CENTRAL ILLINOIS RESTORED TALLGRASS PRAIRIE. BEES WERE SAMPLED USING MALAISE TRAPS, GROUND-LEVEL PAN TRAPS, ELEVATED PAN TRAPS, AND VANE TRAPS. A TOTAL OF 4,622 BEES REPRESENTING 31 GENERA AND 111 SPECIES WERE COLLECTED. MALAISE TRAPS COLLECTED THE GREATEST NUMBER OF BEES AND SPECIES, AND GROUND-LEVEL PAN TRAPS THE LEAST. AMONG THE PAN TRAPS AND VANE TRAPS, BLUE-COLORED TRAPS COLLECTED THE GREATEST ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, AND YELLOW TRAPS THE LEAST. CHAO1 ESTIMATOR AND RAREFACTION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN SAMPLE SIZES WOULD BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE ASYMPTOTIC SPECIES RICHNESS LEVELS, PARTICULARLY IF GROUND-LEVEL PAN TRAPS ALONE WERE USED. ELEVATED PAN TRAPS AND VANE TRAPS COLLECTED RELATIVELY SIMILAR SPECIES COMPOSITION. DIFFERENT COLORED PAN TRAPS AT THE SAME HEIGHT COLLECTED MORE SIMILAR SPECIES COMPOSITION THAN DID THOSE AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS, BUT SPECIES COMPOSITION OF BLUE GROUND-LEVEL PAN TRAPS WAS RELATIVELY SIMILAR TO ELEVATED PAN TRAPS, REGARDLESS OF COLOR. INDICATOR SPECIES ANALYSIS REVEALED 22 SPECIES THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC TRAP TYPE, AND 11 SPECIES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR PAN TRAP COLOR/ELEVATION. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW THAT ELEVATED TRAPS CAN INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BEE SURVEYS IN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE, AND THAT A COMBINATION OF TRAP TYPES GIVES A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE BEE FAUNA THAN DOES A SINGLE SURVEY METHOD.

PATHOL.,"HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS. FOR THIS PURPOSE HONEYBEES AND BUMBLEBEES ARE REARED AND TRANSPORTED. A PATHOGEN-FREE STATUS OF BEES IN GENERAL, IS CRUCIAL. INDEED ANTHROPOGENIC TRANSPORTS OF HOSTS CARRYING PARASITES COULD ALTER THE NATURAL HOST/PATHOGEN ASSOCIATION, INDUCING AN EXTRA PATHOGENIC STRESS. THEREFORE THE CREATION OF A PATHOGEN-FREE REARING ENVIRONMENT IS NEEDED. FOR BUMBLEBEES THIS IS POSSIBLE, AS THESE SPECIES ARE REARED IN A CLOSED ENVIRONMENT. ALTHOUGH, A LINK REMAINS BETWEEN REARED BUMBLEBEES AND THE OUTSIDE BEE COMMUNITY, AS HONEYBEE-COLLECTED POLLEN IS ESSENTIAL FOOD FOR BUMBLEBEE MASS REARING. HERE WE EVALUATED IF GAMMA IRRADIATION CAN MINIMIZE THE RISK OF THIS POTENTIAL ROUTE OF EXPOSURE AND CAN INACTIVATE VIRAL PARTICLES PRESENT IN HONEYBEE-COLLECTED POLLEN. WE SHOW THAT 16.9 KGY GAMMA IRRADIATION INDUCED A 100-1000 FOLD REDUCTION ON THE ABILITY OF IAPV TO CAUSE MORTALITY AFTER INJECTIONS.

IS THE SUBJECT OF MANY RESEARCH AND BREEDING PROGRAMS CONCERNED WITH ITS POTENTIAL AS AN OIL CROP FOR BIODIESEL PRODUCTION. DESPITE AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIS RELATIVELY NEW CROP, POLLINATION REQUIREMENTS OF THIS PLANT ARE LARGELY NEGLECTED. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE RELATIVE SIGNIFICANCE OF ANTS AND HONEYBEES AS POTENTIAL POLLINATORS OF J. CURCAS GROWN UNDER MEDITERRANEAN CONDITIONS. JATROPHA CURCAS PLANTS BLOOMED THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND FALL, PEAKING TWICE, IN EARLY SUMMER AND LATE FALL. DURING THIS PERIOD, THE PLANTS WERE VISITED BY 70 SPECIES OF INSECTS REPRESENTING 45 FAMILIES FROM SEVEN ORDERS, WITH MOST SPECIES RARELY BEING OBSERVED. ANTS AND HONEYBEES WERE THE MOST COMMON SPECIES, ACCOUNTING FOR >95\% OF ALL FLOWER VISITS. THE FORAGING BEHAVIOR OF THE HONEYBEES FOLLOWED THE PATTERN OF BLOOM PHENOLOGY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE SUMMER, AND MOSTLY PROMOTED CROSS-POLLINATION. ANTS ON THE OTHER HAND, MOSTLY PROMOTED SELF POLLINATION SHOWING NO SUCH CORRELATIVE BEHAVIOR, REACTING OFTEN TOO LATE TO NECTAR AVAILABILITY, AND WERE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CLIMATIC CHANGES. POLLINATOR EXCLUSION TREATMENTS REVEALED THAT DURING SUMMER, FRUIT AND SEED SETS, AS WELL AS SEED SIZE AND OIL AND PROTEIN CONTENTS, WERE RELATIVELY SIMILAR FOR ANT AND BEE-POLLINATED FLOWERS. DURING FALL, HOWEVER, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF BEE-POLLINATED FLOWERS WAS RELATIVELY HIGH (66\%), WHILE FRUIT SET OF ANT-POLLINATED FLOWERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FROM 71 TO 11\%. IN CONCLUSION, WHILE BOTH GROUPS ARE EQUAL IN THEIR POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS IN THE SUMMER, DURING THE FALL THE HONEYBEES ARE ALMOST THE SOLE POLLINATORS OF THE PLANT. BASED ON BLOOM PHENOLOGY AND POLLINATION ACTIVITY DATA, THE HONEYBEES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE POLLINATION OF MORE THAN 80\% OF THE ANNUAL REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF J.

INDIRECT COSTS OF PLANT DEFENSE BY ANTS, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN OUTWEIGH BENEFITS IF ANTS DETER POLLINATORS. PLANTS CAN DISSUADE ANTS FROM OCCUPYING FLOWERS, BUT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS MAY BREAK DOWN WHEN NOVEL ANT PARTNERS INFILTRATE MUTUALISMS. HERE, WE EXAMINE HOW FLORAL VISITATION BY ANTS AFFECTS POLLINATION SERVICES WHEN THE INVASIVE ARGENTINE ANT (LINEPITHEMA HUMILE) REPLACES A NATIVE ANT SPECIES IN A FOOD-FOR-PROTECTION MUTUALISM WITH THE COAST BARREL CACTUS (FEROCACTUS VIRIDESCENS), WHICH, LIKE CERTAIN OTHER BARREL CACTI, PRODUCES EXTRAFLORAL NECTAR. WE COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF FLORAL VISITATION BY THE ARGENTINE ANT WITH THOSE OF THE MOST PREVALENT NATIVE ANT SPECIES (CREMATOGASTER CALIFORNICA). COMPARED TO C. CALIFORNICA, THE ARGENTINE ANT WAS PRESENT IN HIGHER NUMBERS IN FLOWERS. CACTUS BEES (DIADASIA SPP.), THE KEY POLLINATORS IN THIS SYSTEM, SPENT LESS TIME IN FLOWERS WHEN CACTI WERE OCCUPIED BY THE ARGENTINE ANT COMPARED TO WHEN CACTI WERE OCCUPIED BY C. CALIFORNICA.

PETER CI;JOHNSON SD,PETER CI,A POLLINATOR SHIFT EXPLAINS FLORAL DIVERGENCE IN AN ORCHID SPECIES COMPLEX IN SOUTH AFRICA,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"FLORAL DIVERSIFICATION DRIVEN BY SHIFTS BETWEEN POLLINATORS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE KEY EXPLANATIONS FOR THE RADIATION OF ANGIOSPERMS. ACCORDING TO THE GRANTSTEBBINS MODEL OF POLLINATOR-DRIVEN SPECIATION, THESE SHIFTS RESULT IN MORPHOLOGICALLY DISTINCT ECOTYPES WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY BECOME RECOGNIZABLE AS SPECIES. THE CURRENT CIRCUMSCRIPTION OF THE FOOD-DECEPTIVE SOUTHERN AFRICAN ORCHID EULOPHIA PARVIFLORA ENCOMPASSES A HIGHLY VARIABLE MONOPHYLETIC SPECIES COMPLEX. IN THIS STUDY, TWO FORMS WERE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THIS COMPLEX THAT DIFFER IN DISTRIBUTION, FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, SCENT CHEMISTRY AND PHENOLOGY, AND A TEST WAS MADE OF WHETHER THESE DIFFERENCES REPRESENT ADAPTATIONS FOR DIFFERENT POLLINATORS. MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF FLORAL AND VEGETATIVE TRAITS REVEALED THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO DISCRETE MORPHOLOGICAL FORMS IN THE SPECIES COMPLEX. FIELD OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THAT EACH FORM IS POLLINATED BY A DIFFERENT INSECT SPECIES, AND THUS REPRESENT DISTINCT ECOTYPES. THE EARLY-FLOWERING COASTAL FORM WHICH HAS LONG SPURS AND FLORAL SCENT DOMINATED BY SESQUITERPENE COMPOUNDS IS POLLINATED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE LONG-TONGUED BEE AMEGILLA FALLAX (APIDAE, ANTHOPHORINAE), WHILE THE LATE-FLOWERING INLAND FORM WITH SHORT SPURS AND FLORAL SCENT DOMINATED BY BENZENOID COMPOUNDS IS POLLINATED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE BEETLE CYRTOTHYREA MARGINALIS (CETONIINAE, SCARABAEIDAE). CHOICE EXPERIMENTS IN A Y-MAZE OLFACTOMETER SHOWED THAT BEETLES ARE PREFERENTIALLY ATTRACTED TO THE SCENT OF THE SHORT-SPURRED FORM. A SPUR-SHORTENING EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT LONG SPURS ARE REQUIRED FOR EFFECTIVE POLLINATION OF THE BEE-POLLINATED FORM. ALTHOUGH IT WAS INITIALLY THOUGHT LIKELY THAT DIVERGENCE OCCURRED ACROSS A GEOGRAPHICAL POLLINATOR GRADIENT, PLANTS OF THE LONG-SPURRED FORM WERE EFFECTIVELY POLLINATED WHEN TRANSPLANTED TO AN INLAND LOCALITY OUTSIDE THE NATURAL COASTAL RANGE OF THIS FORM. THUS, THE UNDERLYING GEOGRAPHICAL BASIS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF ECOTYPES IN THE E. PARVIFLORA COMPLEX REMAINS UNCERTAIN, ALTHOUGH EARLY FLOWERING IN THE LONG-SPURRED FORM TO EXPLOIT THE EMERGENCE OF NAVE BEES MAY RESTRICT THIS FORM TO COASTAL AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO FROST THAT WOULD DAMAGE FLOWER BUDS. LATER FLOWERING OF THE SHORT-SPURRED FORM COINCIDES CLOSELY WITH THE EMERGENCE OF THE POLLINATING BEETLES FOLLOWING WINTER FROSTS. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES A SHIFT BETWEEN BEE AND BEETLE POLLINATION AS THE MAIN DRIVER OF FLORAL DIVERGENCE IN AN ORCHID SPECIES COMPLEX.

BECAUSE FLOWER RESOURCE DIVERSITY IS HIGH AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE ASSOCIATED WITH FLOWERING PHENOLOGY VARIES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT TROPHIC OVERLAP IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE LOW (I.E., HIGH NICHE COMPLEMENTARITY). IN CONTRAST, WE EXPECTED A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS AND EXPLOITATION COMPETITION TO CREATE HIGH TEMPORAL OVERLAP, LEADING TO HIGH REDUNDANCY IN THE TIME OF USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. DIETARY OVERLAP WAS LOW (NOIH = 0.18): NICHES OF 88\% OF SPECIES PAIRS HAD LESS THAN 30\% OVERLAP. IN CONTRAST, TEMPORAL OVERLAP WAS INTERMEDIATE (NOIH=0.49): NICHES OF 65\% OF SPECIES PAIRS HAD 30\% TO 60\% OVERLAP. NETWORK ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT BEES SEPARATED THEIR DIETARY NICHES AND HAD INTERMEDIATE COMPLEMENTARY SPECIALIZATION (H-2'AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND= 0.46). IN TERMS OF THEIR TEMPORAL NICHES (H-2'AEURO PARTS PER THOUSAND= 0.12), BEES WERE GENERALISTS, WITH HIGH TEMPORAL REDUNDANCY. TEMPERATURE WAS NOT A KEY FACTOR IN THE DETERMINATION OF NICHE OVERLAP, SUGGESTING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS DO NOT LIKELY HAVE A PRIMARY ROLE IN DETERMINING HIGH REDUNDANCY IN THE TEMPORAL USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES. RATHER, TEMPORAL OVERLAP IS LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF NECTAR PRODUCTION BY FLOWERS.

CORBET SA;HUANG SQ,CORBET SA,BUZZ POLLINATION IN EIGHT BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PEDICULARIS SPECIES: DOES IT INVOLVE VIBRATION-INDUCED TRIBOELECTRIC CHARGING OF POLLEN GRAINS?,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS BUZZ POLLINATION INVOLVES EXPLOSIVE POLLEN RELEASE IN RESPONSE TO VIBRATION, USUALLY BY BEES. THE MECHANISM OF POLLEN RELEASE IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH COMPONENT OF VIBRATION (ACCELERATION, FREQUENCY, DISPLACEMENT OR VELOCITY) IS CRITICAL, THE ROLE OF BUZZ FREQUENCY HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY CONTROVERSIAL. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NOVEL HYPOTHESIS THAT EXPLOSIVE POLLEN RELEASE RESULTS FROM VIBRATION-INDUCED TRIBOELECTRIC CHARGING. IF IT DOES, POLLEN RELEASE IS EXPECTED TO DEPEND ON ACHIEVEMENT OF A CRITICAL THRESHOLD VELOCITY. METHODS EIGHT SYMPATRIC BUZZ-POLLINATED SPECIES OF PEDICULARIS THAT SHARE BUMBLEBEE POLLINATOR SPECIES WERE STUDIED, GIVING A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE SONICATION BEHAVIOUR OF A SHARED POLLINATOR ON DIFFERENT PLANT SPECIES. KEY RESULTS RECONSIDERING PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES, IT IS ARGUED THAT THEY ESTABLISH THE CRITICAL ROLE OF THE VELOCITY COMPONENT OF VIBRATION IN POLLEN RELEASE, AND THAT WHEN DISPLACEMENT IS CONSTRAINED BY BODY SIZE BEES CAN ACHIEVE THE CRITICAL VELOCITY BY ADJUSTING FREQUENCY. IT WAS SHOWN THAT WORKERS OF BOMBUS FRISEANUS ASSORTED THEMSELVES AMONG PEDICULARIS SPECIES BY BODY SIZE, AND THAT BEES ADJUSTED THEIR BUZZ/WINGBEAT FREQUENCY RATIO, WHICH IS TAKEN AS AN INDEX OF THE VELOCITY COMPONENT, TO A VALUE THAT CORRESPONDS WITH THE GALEA LENGTH AND POLLEN GRAIN VOLUME OF EACH SPECIES OF PEDICULARIS. CONCLUSIONS SONICATION BEHAVIOUR OF B. FRISEANUS DIFFERS AMONG PEDICULARIS SPECIES, NOT ONLY BECAUSE WORKER BEES ASSORT THEMSELVES AMONG PLANT SPECIES BY BODY SIZE, BUT ALSO BECAUSE BEES OF A GIVEN SIZE ADJUST THE BUZZ FREQUENCY TO ACHIEVE A VIBRATION VELOCITY CORRESPONDING TO THE FLORAL TRAITS OF EACH PLANT SPECIES.

APPL. BIOL.,"CURRENT APPROACHES TO DETERMINING THE VALUE OF INSECT POLLINATORS TO CROP YIELD ASSUME THAT PLANTS ARE PRIMARILY POLLEN LIMITED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT IN A CROP SUCH AS LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY, VACCINIUM ANGUSTIFOLIUM, WHERE NO FRUIT WILL SET WITHOUT INSECT-MEDIATED CROSS-POLLINATION. HOWEVER, SUCH VALUATIONS USUALLY IGNORE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO MAXIMISE CROP YIELDS. WE CONDUCTED AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST WHETHER YIELDS OF LOWBUSH BLUEBERRY ATTRIBUTED TO POLLINATOR ACTIVITY INCREASED INDEPENDENTLY OF PEST MANAGEMENT. THE EXPERIMENT WAS A 2X2 FACTORIAL DESIGN, INCORPORATING TWO INTENSITIES OF POLLINATION (25\% OR 100\% OF FLOWERS), AND TWO LEVELS OF INSECT AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT WITH RECOMMENDED FUNGICIDE AND INSECTICIDE SPRAYS (FULL INPUTS' OR NO INPUTS'). WE DEMONSTRATED AN INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO FACTORS, SUCH THAT INCREASED FRUIT SET AT HARVEST WAS ONLY POSSIBLE IF 100\% POLLINATION WAS COMBINED WITH THE FULL INPUT' TREATMENT. FURTHERMORE, INCREASES IN FRUIT WEIGHT AMONG THE REMAINING TREATMENTS WERE ONLY REALISED IN THE FULL INPUT' PLOTS.

PEST SCI.,"BUMBLEBEES OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS ARE INDISPENSIBLE POLLINATORS FOR ECOSYSTEMS AND FOR VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL CROPS. UNFORTUNATELY, BUMBLEBEES ARE CHALLENGED BY VARIOUS STRESS FACTORS INCLUDING INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS. TODAY SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF VARIOUS INSECTICIDES NEED TO BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED TO ALLOW THEIR COMBINED USE WITH POLLINATORS AND OTHER BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED LAMBDA-CYHALOTHRIN AS A MODEL PYRETHROID INSECTICIDE AND INVESTIGATED LETHAL AND SUBLETHAL EFFECTS BY DIFFERENT DILUTIONS, RANGING FROM 1/10 TO 1/100 OF ITS MAXIMUM FIELD RECOMMENDED DOSAGE (MFRC, 37.5 PPM), WITH THE USE OF A CHRONIC TOXICITY TESTS IN THE LABORATORY AND IN FLIGHT CAGES IN THE GREENHOUSE. IN THE LABORATORY, SMALL MICROCOLONIES WITH FIVE BUMBLEBEE WORKERS WITH ONE BEING PSEUDO-QUEEN WERE USED, WHILE IN THE GREENHOUSE WE USED QUEEN-RIGHT MINI-HIVES WHERE THE BUMBLEBEES NEED TO FLY FOR PYRETHROID-CONTAMINATED FOOD. WE OBSERVED STRONG SUBLETHAL EFFECTS IN THE LABORATORY WITH TREATMENTS OF 1/10 AND 1/20 OF THE MFRC: THE NEST REPRODUCTION WAS REDUCED BY 49 AND 32 \%, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE SUGAR WATER CONSUMPTION BY 36 \%. WITH FREE-FLYING BUMBLEBEES, THE TOXIC EFFECTS AT 1/10 OF THE MFRC WERE MORE PRONOUNCED. A MORTALITY OF 88 +/- A 8 \% WAS OBSERVED AFTER ONLY 2 WEEKS, BEING TWICE THE MORTALITY IN THE LABORATORY MICROCOLONIES TEST (43 +/- A 11 \%). BESIDES, IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT IN THE GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENT ALL QUEENS WERE DEAD AND MOST OF THE WORKERS SHOWED SIGNS OF INCOORDINATION AND CONVULSION AND GRADUALLY BECAME APATHETIC.

WE EVALUATED THIS POSSIBILITY USING BEE COMMUNITIES IN A CALIFORNIA AGROECOSYSTEM. WE EXAMINED AMONG SITE PATTERNS IN BEE SPECIES DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONAL-TRAIT DIVERSITY IN A LANDSCAPE COMPOSED OF A MOSAIC OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT, ORGANIC FARMS AND CONVENTIONAL FARMS. WE SAMPLED BEES FROM ALL THREE HABITAT TYPES AND COMPILED A DATA BASE OF LIFE-HISTORY (FUNCTIONAL') TRAITS FOR EACH SPECIES. ALTHOUGH SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER ON ORGANIC FARMS THAN CONVENTIONAL FARMS, FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY WAS LOWER IN BOTH FARM TYPES THAN IN NATURAL HABITAT. NESTING LOCATION (BELOW-GROUND VS. ABOVE-GROUND) WAS THE PRIMARY TRAIT CONTRIBUTING TO DIFFERENCES IN FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY BETWEEN FARMS AND NATURAL HABITAT, REFLECTING OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN AVAILABILITY OF NESTING SUBSTRATES AMONG HABITAT TYPES. OTHER TRAITS, INCLUDING PHENOLOGY AND SOCIALITY, WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIES' OCCURRENCES OR DOMINANCE IN PARTICULAR SITE TYPES.

ECON.,"CURRENT NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SCALE MONETARY VALUATION OF POLLINATION SERVICES DO NOT ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE CONTRIBUTION OF WILD POLLINATORS TO AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. FIRST, ECOSYSTEM (WILD) POLLINATION SERVICES REMAIN LARGELY BUNDLED WITH THOSE OF MANAGED POLLINATORS. THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE FACT THAT THE DEPENDENCY OF CROPS ON POLLINATION, A KEY PARAMETER USED IN CURRENT VALUATIONS, DOES NOT REFLECT VARIATION IN POLLINATOR DENSITY, CROP CULTIVARS AND GROWING CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN PRACTICE. OVER HALF OF THE 153 BILLION OF ESTIMATED GLOBAL POLLINATION SERVICE VALUE IN 2005 IS BASED ON ESTIMATES OF POLLINATOR DEPENDENCY FROM CROPS WITH FEWER THAN THREE FIELD STUDIES THAT MEASURE ACTUAL LEVELS OF POLLINATOR ACTIVITY AND CORRESPONDING FRUIT SET. THE RESULTING UNCERTAINTY MAY BE MOST DISTORTING WHEN APPLIED TO WIDELY-PLANTED INTENSIVE OILSEED CROPS. FURTHERMORE, CURRENT VALUATIONS ARE UNDERPINNED BY SIMPLISTIC ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF POLLINATOR DECLINE AND THE IMPACT ON AGRICULTURAL PRICES. ALTHOUGH EFFORTS TO MOTIVATE WILD POLLINATOR PROTECTION THROUGH THEIR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE VALUE REMAIN HIGHLY CIRCUMSCRIBED BY CONCEPTUAL AND EMPIRICAL LIMITATIONS, WE IDENTIFY THE NEED TO GO BEYOND TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS AND DEVELOP A CRITICAL FRAMEWORK THAT COULD ACCOUNT FOR WHY POLLINATOR CONSERVATION HAS COME TO BE PREDOMINANTLY JUSTIFIED IN THESE TERMS TO BEGIN WITH.

HUMAN POPULATIONS SHOW ROBUST ANNUAL RHYTHMS IN HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND THE BIRTH MONTH CAN HAVE LASTING EFFECTS THAT PERSIST THROUGHOUT LIFE. THIS REVIEW EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF SEASONAL BIOLOGY AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF ITS RAPIDLY PROGRESSING DISRUPTION THROUGH CLIMATE CHANGE, HUMAN LIFESTYLES AND OTHER ANTHROPOGENIC IMPACT.

ECOL.,"THE EVOLUTION OF SELF-POLLINATION HAS LONG BEEN CONSIDERED AN ADAPTIVE STRATEGY TO COPE WITH LOW OR VARIABLE POLLINATOR SERVICE, HOWEVER, ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES, SUCH AS GENERALIZED POLLINATION (>1 POLLINATOR FUNCTIONAL GROUP), MAY ALSO ENSURE PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH INADEQUATE POLLINATOR VISITATION. ISLAND-MAINLAND SYSTEMS PROVIDE IDEAL SETTINGS TO ASSESS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN POLLINATION AND BREEDING SYSTEMS IN RESPONSE TO POLLINATOR VISITATION BECAUSE ISLANDS ARE OFTEN POLLINATOR-DEPAUPERATE. THIS STUDY COMPARED 28 INSULAR AND 26 MAINLAND SPECIES OF CARIBBEAN GESNERIACEAE TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT LOW DIVERSITY AND POSSIBLY LOW POLLINATOR SERVICE ON ISLANDS WOULD LEAD TO A GREATER FREQUENCY OF GENERALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND/OR A HIGHER POTENTIAL FOR AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION IN INSULAR THAN IN MAINLAND SPECIES. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EPIPHYTIC SPECIES SHOULD HAVE GREATER AUTOFERTILITY THAN SPECIES OCCURRING IN OTHER HABITATS. POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS CONDUCTED IN THE FIELD FROM 2004 TO 2014 REVEALED BAT, BEE, BUTTERFLY, HUMMINGBIRD, MOTH, AND GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS. FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION IN POLLINATION SYSTEMS WAS HIGH IN INSULAR (71\% OF THE SPECIES) AND MAINLAND SITES (ALL SPECIES), BUT GENERALIZED AND BAT-POLLINATED SPECIES WERE MORE COMMON ON ISLANDS. OVERALL, POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN ISLAND AND MAINLAND, HOWEVER, FOR HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES, VISITATION RATE WAS ON AVERAGE THREE TIMES HIGHER IN MAINLAND THAN ISLAND SPECIES. AUTOFERTILITY INDICES (FRUIT SET OF BAGGED/OUTCROSS FLOWERS) RANGED FROM 0 TO 1 AND DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN ISLAND AND MAINLAND SPECIES. SPECIES GROWING ON ROCKS (RUPICULOUS) AND TREES (EPIPHYTIC) HAD ON AVERAGE HIGHER AUTOFERTILITY THAN TERRESTRIAL SPECIES.SYNTHESIS. THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT ALTERNATIVE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES ARE USED IN POLLINATOR-DEPAUPERATE ENVIRONMENTS. POLLINATOR VISITATION IS LOWER IN INSULAR HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES (THE ANCESTRAL POLLINATION SYSTEM OF INSULAR GESNERIACEAE), THEREFORE, GENERALIZED POLLINATION MAY BE CONSIDERED A REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE MECHANISM EVOLVED PRIMARILY ON ISLAND ENVIRONMENTS. CONTRARY TO THE LONG-STANDING TENET, HOWEVER, AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION WAS SIMILAR IN ISLAND AND MAINLAND GESNERIACEAE SUGGESTING THAT: (I) GENERALIZED POLLINATION PROVIDES A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO SELFING IN POLLINATOR-DEPAUPERATE ENVIRONMENTS, (II) AUTOFERTILITY AS A REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE MECHANISM MAY BE FREQUENT IN PLANT SPECIES FROM MAINLAND REGIONS IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH UNPREDICTABLE POLLINATOR VISITATION AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY.",CARIBBEAN; GESNERIACEAE; ISLAND; MAINLAND; POLLINATION; REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY; SELF-POLLINATION; SPECIALIZATION,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; BREEDING SYSTEMS; INBREEDING DEPRESSION; FLORAL TRAITS; HUMMINGBIRD; SPECIALIZATION; ECOLOGY; ORGANIZATION; POPULATIONS; EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,14,"MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, ESCUELA NACL ESTUDIOS SUPERIORES, ANTIGUA CARRETERA PATZCUARO 8701, MORELIA 58190, MICHOACAN, MEXICO.;MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA, QUESADA, MAURICIO, UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, ESCUELA NACL ESTUDIOS SUPERIORES, MORELIA 58190, MICHOACAN, MEXICO.;MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA, AC, DEPT BIOL EVOLUT, INST ECOL, XALAPA 91070, VERACRUZ, MEXICO.;MARTEN-RODRIGUEZ, SILVANA, QUESADA, MAURICIO, LOPEZARAIZA-MIKEL, MARTHA, UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, ESCUELA NACL ESTUDIOS SUPERIORES, LAB NACL ANAL \& SINTESIS ECOL CONSERVAC RECURSOS, MORELIA 58190, MICHOACAN, MEXICO.;CASTRO, ABEL-ALMARALES, MUSEO HIST NAT TOMAS ROMAY, CTR ORIENTAL ECOSISTEMAS \& BIODIVERSIDAD, SANTIAGO DE CUBA 90100, CUBA.;LOPEZARAIZA-MIKEL, MARTHA, UNIV AUTONOMA GUERRERO, UNIDAD ACAD DESARROLLO SUSTENTABLE, TECPAN DE GALEANA 40900, GUERRERO, MEXICO.;FENSTER, CHARLES B., UNIV MARYLAND, DEPT BIOL, COLLEGE PK, MD 20742 USA.",10.1111/1365-2745.12457,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"GESNERIAD SOCIETY; CONACYT MEXICOCONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [2011-131008, 2010-155016, 2014-241696]; PROYECTO LABORATORIO NACIONAL DE ANALISIS Y SINTESIS ECOLOGICA PARA LA CONSERVACION DE RECURSOS GENETICOS [U-3-2015-2-250996]; PROGRAMA DE APOYO A PROYECTOS DE INVESTIGACION E INNOVACION UNAM [PAPIIT IN201011, PAPIIT IN212714]; NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DEB-0108285, DDIG-0710196]","WE THANK R.

SEVERAL OF THOSE SPECIES BUILD THEIR OWN NESTS, WHILE OTHERS ARE REPORTED AS NEST CLEPTOPARASITES. HERE, THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE INCLUSION OF A STRONG BIOTIC INTERACTION, SUCH AS THE PRESENCE OF A HOST SPECIES, IMPROVED THE ABILITY OF SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS (SDMS) TO PREDICT THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE OF THE CLEPTOPARASITE SPECIES. THE TARGET SPECIES WERE AGLAE CAERULEA AND ITS HOST SPECIES EULAEMA NIGRITA. ADDITIONALLY, SINCE AGLAE CAERULEA IS MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE AMAZON RATHER THAN THE CERRADO AREAS, A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER THIS SPECIES IS INCREASING OR DECREASING ITS DISTRIBUTION GIVEN SOUTH AMERICAN PAST AND CURRENT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. SDMS METHODS (MAXENT AND BIOCLIM), IN ADDITION WITH CURRENT AND PAST SOUTH AMERICAN CLIMATIC CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS THE OCCURRENCES FOR AGLAE CAERULEA AND EULAEMA NIGRITA WERE USED TO GENERATE THE DISTRIBUTION MODELS. THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGLAE CAERULEA WAS GENERATED WITH AND WITHOUT THE INCLUSION OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF EULAEMA NIGRITA AS A PREDICTOR VARIABLE. THE RESULTS INDICATE AGLAE CAERULEA WAS BARELY AFFECTED BY PAST CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND THE POPULATIONS FROM THE CERRADO SAVANNA COULD BE AT LEAST 21,000 YEARS OLD (THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM), AS WELL AS THE AMAZONIAN ONES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IN THIS STUDY, THE INCLUSION OF THE HOST-CLEPTOPARASITE INTERACTION COMPLEX DID NOT STATISTICALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCED MODELS, WHICH MEANS THAT THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE OF THIS CLEPTOPARASITE SPECIES IS MAINLY CONSTRAINED BY CLIMATE AND NOT BY THE PRESENCE OF THE HOST SPECIES.

IN ADDITION, THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION (LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY) AND LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION (DISTANCE FROM SEMINATURAL GRASSLAND) ON WILD PLANT POLLINATION, AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE LANDSCAPE EFFECTS, HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED USING LANDSCAPE-LEVEL REPLICATION. WE PERFORMED A FIELD EXPERIMENT TO DISENTANGLE THESE LANDSCAPE EFFECTS ON THE POLLINATION OF A NATIVE HERB, THE STICKY CATCHFLY (LYCHNIS VISCARIA), WHILE ACCOUNTING FOR THE PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE ACROSS LANDSCAPES AND THE LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF BEE FORAGE FLOWERS. WE MEASURED POLLEN LIMITATION (THE DEGREE TO WHICH SEED SET IS POLLEN-LIMITED), SEED SET, AND SEED SET STABILITY USING POTTED PLANTS PLACED IN LANDSCAPES THAT DIFFERED IN HETEROGENEITY (COMPOSITION) AND DISTANCE FROM SEMINATURAL GRASSLAND (CONFIGURATION). POLLEN LIMITATION AND SEED SET IN INDIVIDUAL PLANTS DID NOT RESPOND TO LANDSCAPE COMPOSITION, LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION, OR PROPORTION OF OILSEED RAPE. INSTEAD, SEED SET INCREASED WITH INCREASING LOCAL BEE FORAGE FLOWER COVER. HOWEVER, WE FOUND WITHIN-PLANT VARIABILITY IN POLLEN LIMITATION AND SEED SET TO INCREASE WITH INCREASING DISTANCE FROM SEMINATURAL PASTURE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT AVERAGE WITHIN-PLANT LEVELS OF POLLEN LIMITATION AND SEED SET RESPOND LESS SWIFTLY THAN THE WITHIN-PLANT VARIABILITY IN POLLEN LIMITATION AND SEED SET TO CHANGES IN LANDSCAPE CONFIGURATION.

BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: ULTRAVIOLET (UV) FLORAL PATTERNS ARE COMMON IN ANGIOSPERMS AND MEDIATE POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, EFFICIENCY, AND CONSTANCY. UV PATTERNS MAY VARY WITHIN SPECIES, YET ARE CRYPTIC TO HUMAN OBSERVERS. THUS, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXPLICITLY DESCRIBED THE DISTRIBUTION OR ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN UV FLORAL PATTERNING. HERE, WE DESCRIBE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION AND PATTERN OF INHERITANCE OF A UV POLYMORPHISM IN THE MODEL PLANT SPECIES MIMULUS GUTTATUS (PHRYMACEAE). WE THEN TEST WHETHER NATURALLY OCCURRING UV PHENOTYPES INFLUENCE POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS. METHODS: WE DOCUMENT UV PATTERNS IN 18 ANNUAL AND 19 PERENNIAL POPULATIONS AND TEST WHETHER UV PATTERN IS ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY. TO EXAMINE THE PATTERN OF INHERITANCE, WE CONDUCTED CROSSES WITHIN AND BETWEEN UV PHENOTYPES. FINALLY, WE TESTED WHETHER BEE POLLINATORS DISCRIMINATE AMONG NATURALLY OCCURRING UV PHENOTYPES IN TWO SETTINGS: WILD BEE COMMUNITIES AND CAPTIVE BOMBUS IMPATIENS. KEY RESULTS: WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS, PERENNIAL POPULATIONS EXHIBIT A SMALL BULLS-EYE PATTERN, WHEREAS A BILATERALLY SYMMETRIC RUNWAY PATTERN OCCURS MAINLY IN ANNUAL POPULATIONS. INHERITANCE OF UV PATTERNING IS CONSISTENT WITH A SINGLE-LOCUS MENDELIAN MODEL IN WHICH THE RUNWAY PHENOTYPE IS DOMINANT. BEE POLLINATORS DISCRIMINATE AGAINST UNFAMILIAR UV PATTERNS IN BOTH NATURAL AND CONTROLLED SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS: WE DESCRIBE A WIDESPREAD UV POLYMORPHISM ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE HISTORY DIVERGENCE WITHIN MIMULUS GUTTATUS. UV PATTERN INFLUENCES POLLINATOR VISITATION AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS BETWEEN LIFE HISTORY ECOTYPES.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"POLLINATION SERVICES ARE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF AGRICULTURAL BIODIVERSITY WHICH ENHANCE THE YIELD AND QUALITY OF MANY CROPS. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SUITABILITY OF EXTANT HABITATS FOR POLLINATING SPECIES IS CRUCIAL FOR PLANNING MANAGEMENT ACTIONS TO PROTECT AND MANAGE THESE SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN A HIGHLY MODIFIED AGRICULTURAL ECOSYSTEM, WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT POLLINATION TREATMENTS (OPEN, AUTONOMOUS SELF- AND WIND-POLLINATION) ON POD SET, SEED SET, AND SEED WEIGHT IN FIELD BEANS (VICIA FABA). WE ALSO INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS AND FLOWER ABUNDANCE ON POLLINATORS OF FIELD BEANS. POLLINATOR SAMPLING WAS UNDERTAKEN IN TEN FIELD BEAN FIELDS ALONG A GRADIENT OF HABITAT COMPLEXITY, CORINE LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE LAND USE PATTERNS BETWEEN 500-3000 M AROUND THE SITES. TOTAL YIELD FROM OPEN-POLLINATION, INCREASED BY 185\% COMPARED TO AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION. THERE WAS POSITIVE INTERACTIVE EFFECT OF LOCAL FLOWER ABUNDANCE AND COVER OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS ON OVERALL ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS AT 1500 AND 2000M, AND ABUNDANCE OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP.) AT 1000-2000M. IN CONTRAST, SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS WAS ONLY CORRELATED WITH FLOWER ABUNDANCE AND NOT WITH SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS. WE DID NOT FIND A LINK BETWEEN POD SET,FROM OPEN-POLLINATION AND POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, POSSIBLY DUE TO VARIATIONS IN THE GROWING CONDITIONS AND POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES BETWEEN SITES. WE CONCLUDE THAT INSECT POLLINATION IS ESSENTIAL FOR OPTIMAL BEAN YIELDS AND THEREFORE THE MAINTENANCE OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN AGRICULTURE-DOMINATED LANDSCAPES SHOULD ENSURE STABLE AND MORE EFFICIENT POLLINATION SERVICES IN FIELD BEANS.

AREAS J.,"HABITAT RESTORATION IS CONSIDERED CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING AND RESTORING BIODIVERSITY OF MANY SPECIES GROUPS. A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SPECIES RESPOND TO THE RESTORATION PROCESS IS IMPERATIVE TO IDENTIFYING PRACTICES THAT BENEFIT THE TARGET ORGANISMS. USING SURVEY RESPONSES FROM LAND MANAGERS ABOUT THE RESTORATION PROCESS IN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE HABITAT, WE IDENTIFY COMMON RESTORATION AND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES. THESE RESPONSES ARE THEN COMBINED WITH CURRENT LITERATURE ON BEE AND PLANT RESPONSES TO THESE METHODS IN TALLGRASS PRAIRIE HABITAT.

WHITNEY HM;REED A;RANDS SA;CHITTKA L;GLOVER BJ,WHITNEY HM,FLOWER IRIDESCENCE INCREASES OBJECT DETECTION IN THE INSECT VISUAL SYSTEM WITHOUT COMPROMISING OBJECT IDENTITY,CURRENT BIOLOGY,CURR. BIOL.,"IRIDESCENCE IS A FORM OF STRUCTURAL COLORATION, PRODUCED BY A RANGE OF STRUCTURES, IN WHICH HUE IS DEPENDENT ON VIEWING ANGLE [1-4]. ONE OF THESE STRUCTURES, THE DIFFRACTION GRATING, IS FOUND BOTH IN ANIMALS (FOR EXAMPLE, BEETLES [2]) AND IN PLANTS (ON THE PETALS OF SOME ANIMAL POLLINATED FLOWERS [5]). THE BEHAVIORAL IMPACTS OF FLORAL IRIDESCENCE AND ITS POTENTIAL ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE ARE UNKNOWN [6-9]. ANIMAL-POLLINATED FLOWERS ARE DESCRIBED AS ``SENSORY BILLBOARDS'' [10], WITH MANY FLORAL FEATURES CONTRIBUTING TO A CONSPICUOUS DISPLAY THAT FILTERS PROSPECTIVE POLLINATORS. YET FLORAL IRIDESCENCE IS MORE SUBTLE TO THE HUMAN EYE THAN THAT OF MANY ANIMAL DISPLAYS BECAUSE THE FLORAL DIFFRACTION GRATING IS NOT PERFECTLY REGULAR [5-9]. THIS PRESENTS A PUZZLE: IF THE FUNCTION OF PETALS IS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS, THEN FLOWERS MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO OPTIMIZE IRIDESCENCE TO INCREASE SHOWINESS. ON THE OTHER HAND, POLLINATORS MEMORIZE FLORAL COLORS AS CONSISTENT ADVERTISEMENTS OF REWARD QUALITY, AND IRIDESCENCE MIGHT CORRUPT FLOWER COLOR IDENTITY. HERE WE TESTED THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN FLOWER DETECTABILITY AND RECOGNITION, REQUIRING BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) TO IDENTIFY ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS THAT VARIED IN PIGMENTATION AND DEGREE OF IRIDESCENCE. WE FIND THAT IRIDESCENCE DOES INCREASE TARGET DETECTABILITY BUT THAT ``PERFECT'' IRIDESCENCE (PRODUCED BY AN ARTIFICIAL DIFFRACTION GRATING) CORRUPTS TARGET IDENTITY AND BEES MAKE MANY MISTAKES. HOWEVER, ``IMPERFECT'' FLORAL IRIDESCENCE DOES NOT LEAD TO MISTAKEN TARGET IDENTITY, WHILE STILL BENEFITTING FLOWER DETECTABILITY.

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED ITS IMPACT ON SPECIES INTERACTIONS, PARTICULARLY POLLINATION. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE EFFECTS OF LAND-USE CHANGE ON POLLINATION HAVE BEEN STUDIED, THE FOCUS HAS LARGELY BEEN ON SPECIES POLLINATED BY DIURNAL POLLINATORS, NAMELY, BEES AND BUTTERFLIES. HERE, WE FOCUS ON OENOTHERA HARRINGTONII, A NIGHT-FLOWERING, DISTURBANCE-ADAPTED SPECIES THAT HAS EXPERIENCED A RANGE-WIDE GRADIENT OF LAND-USE CHANGE. WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF LAND-USE CHANGE ARE MITIGATED BY LONG-DISTANCE POLLINATION. METHODS: OUR STUDY INCLUDED BOTH TEMPORAL (4YR) AND SPATIAL (19 POPULATIONS RANGE-WIDE, AND 1,2, AND 5 KM FROM THE POPULATION CENTER) DATA, PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF LAND-USE CHANGE ON POLLINATION BIOLOGY AND REPRODUCTION.

WE THEN SHOWED THAT HAWKMOTHS (PRIMARILY HYLES LINEATA) ARE HIGHLY RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME. UNLIKE OTHER STUDIES, WE DID NOT DETECT AN EFFECT OF POPULATION SIZE, INCREASED ISOLATION, OR A REDUCTION IN SUITABLE HABITAT IN AREAS WITH EVIDENCE OF LAND-USE CHANGE ON POLLINATION ( VISITATION, POLLEN REMOVAL AND DEPOSITION). FURTHERMORE, THE PROPORTION OF SUITABLE HABITAT AND OTHER FRAGMENTATION METRICS EXAMINED WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH POPULATION SIZE OR DENSITY IN THIS PLANT SPECIES.

GOSTERIT A;BASKAR VC,GOSTERIT A,IMPACTS OF COMMERCIALIZATION ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.) COLONIES,INSECTES SOCIAUX,INSECT. SOC.,"BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.) IS NATURALLY DISTRIBUTED MAINLY IN EUROPE, AND SINCE 1988, IT HAS BEEN USED COMMERCIALLY AS A VALUABLE POLLINATOR OF GREENHOUSE CROPS IN MANY COUNTRIES, FAR BEYOND ITS NATURAL RANGE. ALTHOUGH THE POSSIBLE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF THIS INVASIVE SPECIES HAVE BEEN INTENSELY DISCUSSED WITH RESPECT TO HYBRIDIZATION, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS NEARLY 30-YEAR PERIOD OF COMMERCIALIZATION. WE EXAMINED AND COMPARED THE DEVELOPMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE AND COMMERCIAL COLONIES AND THEIR FIRST-GENERATION HYBRIDS UNDER THE SAME LABORATORY CONDITIONS. YOUNG QUEENS AND MALES PRODUCED IN BOTH NATIVE AND COMMERCIAL COLONIES WERE MATED TO GENERATE FOUR GENOTYPE GROUPS: NATIVE X NATIVE (N-A (TM) EURO X N-A (TM),N-), NATIVE X COMMERCIAL (N-A (TM) EURO X C-A (TM),C-), COMMERCIAL X COMMERCIAL (C-A (TM) EURO X C-A (TM),C-), AND COMMERCIAL X NATIVE (C-A (TM) EURO X N-A (TM),N-). THE COMMERCIAL GENOTYPE PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE GYNES AND WORKERS THAN DID THE NATIVE GENOTYPE. HOWEVER, AVERAGE GYNE NUMBER OF N-A (TM) EURO X N-A (TM),N- WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE POOLED N-A (TM) EURO X C-A (TM),C- AND C-A (TM) EURO X N-A (TM),N-. THE COMMERCIAL GENOTYPE CONSTRUCTED MORE EGG CELLS IN THE FIRST BROOD AND COMMENCED EGG LAYING EARLIER. HYBRIDIZATION BETWEEN COMMERCIAL AND NATIVE GENOTYPES GENERALLY RESULTED IN INTERMEDIATE EXPRESSION OF THE COLONY TRAITS. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT THE MATERNAL GENOTYPE PRIMARILY DETERMINES THESE COLONY TRAITS. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT HYBRIDIZATION WITH THE COMMERCIAL GENOTYPE AFFECTED SOME COLONY TRAITS OF NATIVE B.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"TO MEET THE DIETARY REQUIREMENTS OF A BURGEONING HUMAN POPULATION, THE DEMAND FOR ANIMAL-DEPENDENT CROPS CONTINUES TO GROW. TO MEET THE DEMAND, INTENSIVE FARMING PRACTICES ARE USED. THE GAINS IN FOOD PRODUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION MAY BE OFFSET BY ITS DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON POLLINATOR POPULATIONS THROUGH NATURAL HABITAT FRAGMENTATION AND PESTICIDE USE. ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO NATURAL HABITAT IN AGROECOSYSTEMS, REDUCING CROP YIELDS. A KEY ASPECT OF CROP POLLINATION LIES IN THE DIVERSITY OF FUNCTIONAL TRAITS (FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, FD) OF FLOWER-VISITOR COMMUNITIES WITHIN CROP FIELDS. HIGHER FD ALLOWS IMPROVED POLLINATION SUCCESS THROUGH COMPLEMENTARITY BETWEEN FLOWER-VISITORS' MORPHOLOGY, PHENOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR. MANY STUDIES REPORTED NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INCREASING DISTANCE TO NATURAL HABITATS ON THE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF FLOWER-VISITOR COMMUNITIES, BUT THE LINK BETWEEN FD AND NATURAL HABITAT ISOLATION IS LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD. ALSO, A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONAL TRAITS OF FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITIES WITHIN CROPS SHOULD CONSIDER POTENTIAL VARIATIONS THROUGH TIME. DIFFERENCES IN RESOURCES AVAILABILITY BETWEEN SEASONS ARE IMPORTANT IN TROPICAL AREAS AND COULD MODIFY ECOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF FLOWER-VISITOR COMMUNITIES TO ISOLATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE SURVEYED THE HYMENOPTERA AND DIPTERA COMMUNITIES WITHIN MANGO ORCHARDS OF SOUTH AFRICA USING PAN TRAPS AT 100 M, 200 M AND AT THE MAXIMAL DISTANCE POSSIBLE FROM ANY NATURAL HABITAT. WE MEASURED THE RESPONSE OF INSECT ABUNDANCE, WING SPAN AND BODY SIZE AS WELL AS FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY TO HABITAT ISOLATION DURING MANGO FLOWERING (DRY SEASON), AND DURING THE WET SEASON (AFTER MANGO FRUIT HARVEST). FLYING INSECT ABUNDANCE DECREASED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO NATURAL HABITAT DURING MANGO FLOWERING, BUT NO EFFECT WAS DETECTED DURING THE WET SEASON. FD OF FLYING INSECTS DECLINED WITH INCREASING DISTANCE TO NATURAL HABITAT IN BOTH SAMPLING PERIODS. INSECTS CAPTURED DURING MANGO FLOWERING WERE SMALLER BUT HAD HIGHER WING LENGTH/BODY LENGTH RATIOS THAN THOSE CAUGHT DURING THE WET SEASON. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT MANGO ORCHARDS ARE MORE INHOSPITABLE FOR FLYING INSECTS DURING MANGO FLOWERING. THIS EFFECT MIGHT BE DUE TO LOW PALATABILITY OF MANGO FLOWERS, OR PESTICIDE USE IN MANGO FIELDS. IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A HIGH FD OF FLOWER-VISITING SPECIES, AND REDUCE THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF HABITAT ISOLATION TO ULTIMATELY ENSURE BETTER CROP POLLINATION, WE PROPOSE ESTABLISHMENT OF PATCHES OF RESOURCE-RICH HABITATS COMBINED WITH JUDICIOUS USE OF PESTICIDES WITHIN ORCHARDS.

ALTHOUGH MANY PHYTOCHEMICALS ACT AS TOXINS AND DETERRENTS TO CONSUMERS, THE SAME CHEMICALS MAY COUNTERACT DISEASE AND BE PREFERRED BY INFECTED INDIVIDUALS. THE ROLES OF NECTAR AND POLLEN PHYTOCHEMICALS IN POLLINATOR ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION ARE COMPLEX, WITH EVIDENCE FOR BOTH TOXICITY AND MEDICINAL EFFECTS AGAINST PARASITES. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR HOW CONSISTENT THE EFFECTS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS ARE ACROSS DIFFERENT PARASITE LINEAGES AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND WHETHER POLLINATORS ACTIVELY SELF-MEDICATE WITH THESE COMPOUNDS WHEN INFECTED. APPROACH HERE, WE TEST EFFECTS OF THE NECTAR ALKALOID ANABASINE, FOUND IN NICOTIANA, ON INFECTION INTENSITY, DIETARY PREFERENCE, AND SURVIVAL AND PERFORMANCE OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS IMPATIENS). WE EXAMINED VARIATION IN THE EFFECTS OF ANABASINE ON INFECTION WITH DIFFERENT LINEAGES OF THE INTESTINAL PARASITE CRITHIDIA UNDER POLLEN-FED AND POLLEN-STARVED CONDITIONS. RESULTS WE FOUND THAT ANABASINE DID NOT REDUCE INFECTION INTENSITY IN INDIVIDUAL BEES INFECTED WITH ANY OF FOUR CRITHIDIA LINEAGES THAT WERE TESTED IN PARALLEL, NOR DID ANABASINE REDUCE INFECTION INTENSITY IN MICROCOLONIES OF QUEENLESS WORKERS. IN ADDITION, NEITHER ANABASINE NOR ITS ISOMER, NICOTINE, WAS PREFERRED BY INFECTED BEES IN CHOICE EXPERIMENTS, AND INFECTED BEES CONSUMED LESS ANABASINE THAN DID UNINFECTED BEES UNDER NO-CHOICE CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, ANABASINE EXACERBATED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF INFECTION ON BEE SURVIVAL AND MICROCOLONY PERFORMANCE. ANABASINE REDUCED INFECTION IN ONLY ONE EXPERIMENT, IN WHICH BEES WERE DEPRIVED OF POLLEN AND POST-PUPAL CONTACT WITH NESTMATES. IN THIS EXPERIMENT, ANABASINE HAD ANTIPARASITIC EFFECTS IN BEES FROM ONLY TWO OF FOUR COLONIES, AND INFECTED BEES EXHIBITED REDUCED-RATHER THAN INCREASED-PHYTOCHEMICAL CONSUMPTION RELATIVE TO UNINFECTED BEES. CONCLUSIONS VARIATION IN THE EFFECT OF ANABASINE ON INFECTION SUGGESTS POTENTIAL MODULATION OF TRITROPHIC INTERACTIONS BY BOTH HOST GENOTYPE AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BOMBUS IMPATIENS PREFER DIETS WITHOUT NICOTINE AND ANABASINE, AND SUGGEST THAT THE MEDICINAL EFFECTS AND TOXICITY OF ANABASINE MAY BE CONTEXT DEPENDENT.

EVOL.,"LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY IN FLORAL COMMUNITIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MODIFY POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR. POLLINATOR FORAGING VARIES WITH THE DIVERSITY, ABUNDANCE, AND SPATIAL CONFIGURATION OF FLORAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS VARIATION FOR POLLEN TRANSFER AND ULTIMATELY THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF INSECT POLLINATED PLANTS REMAINS UNCLEAR, ESPECIALLY FOR SPECIES WHICH ARE RARE OR ISOLATED IN THE LANDSCAPE. WE USED A LANDSCAPE-SCALE EXPERIMENT, COUPLED WITH MICROSATELLITE GENOTYPING, TO EXPLORE HOW THE FLORAL RICHNESS OF HABITATS AFFECTED POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR AND POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS. SMALL ARRAYS OF THE PARTIALLY SELF-COMPATIBLE PLANT CALIFORNIAN POPPY (ESCHSCHOLZIA CALIFORNICA) WERE INTRODUCED ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT TO SIMULATE RARE, SPATIALLY ISOLATED POPULATIONS. THE EFFECTS ON POLLINATOR ACTIVITY, OUTCROSSING, AND PLANT REPRODUCTION WERE MEASURED. IN FLORALLY RICH HABITATS, WE FOUND REDUCED POLLEN MOVEMENT BETWEEN PLANTS, LEADING TO FEWER LONG-DISTANCE POLLINATION EVENTS, LOWER PLANT OUTCROSSING, AND A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF POLLEN LIMITATION. THIS PATTERN INDICATES A POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN PER CAPITA POLLINATOR VISITATION, AS SUGGESTED BY THE LOWER ACTIVITY DENSITIES AND RICHNESS OF POLLINATORS OBSERVED WITHIN FLORALLY RICH HABITATS. IN ADDITION, SEED PRODUCTION REDUCED BY A FACTOR OF 1.8 IN PLANTS WITHIN FLORALLY RICH HABITATS AND PROGENY GERMINATION REDUCED BY A FACTOR OF 1.2. WE SHOW THIS TO BE A CONSEQUENCE OF SELF-FERTILIZATION WITHIN THE PARTIALLY SELF-COMPATIBLE PLANT, E. CALIFORNICA.

GENET.,"THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE, MEGACHILE ROTUNDATA (ALCB) IS AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT POLLINATOR NECESSARY FOR SEED PRODUCTION OF THE CRITICAL FORAGE CROP ALFALFA, MEDICAGO SATIVA. THE POLLINATOR WAS ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED TO NORTH AMERICA FROM EUROPE APPROXIMATELY 70 YEARS AGO, AND IT IS PRIMARILY PRODUCED IN CANADA AND SHIPPED TO THE UNITED STATES ANNUALLY EN MASSE FOR SEED FIELD POLLINATION. WE INVESTIGATE HOW THE LARGE-SCALE COMMERCIAL MOVEMENT OF THIS BEE AFFECTS THE GENETIC STRUCTURE OF POPULATIONS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN SEED GROWING SYSTEM AND COMPARE THE GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE OF INTRODUCED NORTH AMERICAN BEES WITH TWO NATIVE EUROPEAN POPULATIONS. USING 16 NEWLY DEVELOPED MICROSATELLITE LOCI, WE DESCRIBE THE NORTH AMERICAN POPULATION STRUCTURE OF THIS BEE. ALCBS COLLECTED FROM ALFALFA SEED FARMS HAVE A DEGREE OF GENETIC VARIABILITY SIMILAR TO ONE NATIVE EUROPEAN POPULATION, BUT LOWER THAN THE SECOND. CONSIDERING THAT THE SPECIES WAS ACCIDENTALLY INTRODUCED INTO NORTH AMERICA, WE ANTICIPATED MORE SIGNATURE OF A FOUNDER EFFECT. DESPITE THE LEVEL OF GENETIC VARIABILITY, WE FOUND LITTLE, IF ANY, GENETIC STRUCTURING ACROSS NORTH AMERICA, OTHER THAN THAT THE NORTH AMERICAN POPULATIONS WERE DISTINCT FROM THE EUROPEAN POPULATIONS SAMPLED. WHILE WE DETECTED SOME SUB-STRUCTURE IN NORTH AMERICAN POPULATIONS USING BAYESIAN METHODS, THE STRUCTURING WAS WITHOUT GEOGRAPHIC PATTERN, AND WE PROPOSE IT IS THE RESULT OF THE INTENSE HUMAN MANAGEMENT AND MOVEMENT OF THESE BEES. THE TRADE AND MOVEMENT OF THESE BEES BY HUMANS HAS CREATED A NEARLY PANMICTIC M.

BIGNONIACEAE SPECIES HAVE A WIDE INTERACTION NETWORK WITH FLORAL VISITORS, AND MOST OF THOSE INTERACTIONS ARE ESTABLISHED WITH CHEATERS. THUS, OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE WHICH ROLE EACH FLORAL VISITOR PLAYS IN A SYSTEM COMPOSED BY BEES AND A BIGNONIACEAE SAVANNA SPECIES. SO, HERE WE DESCRIBED THE BEES' BEHAVIOUR AND DEFINED EXPERIMENTALLY WHO ARE THE MUTUALISTS AND CHEATERS, WE DESCRIBED THE TEMPORAL SEQUENCE OF INTERACTIONS, QUANTIFIED POLLEN AND NECTAR REMOVAL, AND CHECKED FOR THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF ROBBERY DAMAGES ON POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR. POLLINATORS VISITED A SMALL NUMBER OF FLOWERS, MAINLY IN THE EARLY MORNING, WHILE THE MOST FREQUENT CHEATERS (ROBBERS AND THIEVES) VISITED THE FLOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY, INCREASING VISITATION AT MIDMORNING, WHEN POLLINATORS HAD ALREADY VISITED THE FLOWERS. WE CONSIDERED MEDIUM-SIZED BEES AS POLLINATORS, SMALL BEES ACTED ONLY AS CHEATERS, NOT CONTRIBUTING TO SEED PRODUCTION. POLLEN THIEVES REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF MALE GAMETES AVAILABLE FOR POLLINATION, WHILE NECTAR THIEVES AND ROBBERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH NECTAR DEPLETION. WE DID NOT FIND ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS DEPOSITED ON THE STIGMAS OF FLOWERS WITH AND WITHOUT ROBBERY DAMAGES. IN CONCLUSION, WHEN POLLINATORS VISIT J. CAROBA FLOWERS IN THE EARLY MORNING, THERE MIGHT BE A SMALLER COMPETITION PRESSURE AMONG VISITORS DUE TO THE GREATER AMOUNT OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE, ESPECIALLY IN RECENTLY OPENED FLOWERS, AND DUE TO THE LOW FREQUENCY OF CHEATERS VISITS, WHICH PROBABLY PREVENTS A MAJOR NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHEATERS ON POLLINATION AND PLANT REPRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES.

EVALUATING ``MULTI-SCALE RESPONSES OF SPECIES TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK TO BE CONSIDERED, ALLOWING INSIGHTS ABOUT HABITAT REQUIREMENTS FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS. WE EVALUATED THE RESPONSE OF BRAZILIAN CERRADO'S BEES (EUSOCIAL VS. SOLITARY ONES) TO BOTH THE AMOUNT AND ISOLATION OF REMNANT VEGETATION IN EIGHT NESTED MULTIPLE-LOCAL SCALES. RESPONSE VARIABLES INCLUDED ABUNDANCE, OBSERVED, AND ESTIMATED SPECIES RICHNESS, AND BETA DIVERSITY (SPLIT INTO NESTEDNESS AND TURNOVER RESULTANT DISSIMILARITIES). EUSOCIAL SPECIES' ABUNDANCE RESPONDED TO LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AT NARROW SCALES OF FRAGMENT ISOLATION (250 M OF RADIUS FROM SAMPLING SITES), WHILE SOLITARY SPECIES' ABUNDANCE RESPONDED TO BROADER SCALES TO FRAGMENT AREA (2000 M). EUSOCIAL SPECIES NESTEDNESS ALSO RESPONDED TO LANDSCAPE FEATURES IN BROADER SCALES (1500 M), ESPECIALLY TO INCREASING FRAGMENT ISOLATION. HOWEVER, ALL THE REMAINING RESPONSE VARIABLES DID NOT RESPOND TO ANY OTHER LANDSCAPE VARIABLES IN ANY SPATIAL SCALE CONSIDERED. SUCH CONTRASTING RESPONSES OF THE ABUNDANCES OF EUSOCIAL VS. SOLITARY SPECIES ARE RELATED TO THE INHERENT LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF EACH GROUP. IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES IN THIS CONTEXT ARE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS ON FOOD RESOURCES, POPULATION FEATURES, AND FLIGHT ABILITIES. SPECIES-SPECIFIC DISPERSAL ABILITIES MAY BE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF THE NESTED PATTERNS FOUND FOR EUSOCIAL SPECIES AT 1500 M.

CONSEQUENTLY, WARMING COULD BENEFIT MANY HIGH-LATITUDE AND HIGH-ALTITUDE INSECTS BY INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FORAGING OR OVIPOSITION. HOWEVER, WARMING CAN ALSO ALTER SPECIES INTERACTIONS, INCLUDING INTERACTIONS WITH NATURAL ENEMIES, MAKING THE NET EFFECT OF RISING TEMPERATURES ON POPULATION GROWTH RATE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. WE INVESTIGATED THE TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE OF NESTING ACTIVITY AND LIFETIME REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OVER 3 YR IN SUBALPINE POPULATIONS OF A POLLEN-SPECIALIST BEE, OSMIA IRIDIS. RATES OF NEST PROVISIONING INCREASED WITH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND WITH AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES, AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER, WARMER CONDITIONS DID NOT INCREASE LIFETIME REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT. LIFETIME OFFSPRING PRODUCTION WAS BEST EXPLAINED BY RATES OF BROOD PARASITISM (BY THE WASP SAPYGA), WHICH INCREASED WITH TEMPERATURE. DIRECT OBSERVATIONS OF BEE AND PARASITE ACTIVITY SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH ACTIVITY OF BOTH SPECIES IS FAVORED BY WARMER TEMPERATURES, BEES CAN BE ACTIVE AT LOWER AMBIENT TEMPERATURES, WHILE WASPS ARE ACTIVE ONLY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THUS, DIRECT BENEFITS TO THE BEES OF WARMER TEMPERATURES WERE NULLIFIED BY INDIRECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PARASITE ACTIVITY. TO DATE, MOST STUDIES OF CLIMATE-CHANGE EFFECTS ON POLLINATORS HAVE FOCUSED ON CHANGING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN POLLINATORS AND THEIR FLORAL HOST-PLANTS (I.E., BOTTOM-UP PROCESSES).

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"FRUIT CULTIVATION HIGHLY DEPENDS ON INSECT POLLINATION FOR FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. YET, FRUIT CULTIVATION AS AN INTENSIVE LAND USE CAN POSSIBLY ALTER THE DIVERSITY OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND THE CORRESPONDING POLLINATION SERVICE. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE HOW INTENSIVE FRUIT CULTIVATION INFLUENCES BOTH POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND FRUIT SET IN SWEET CHERRY ORCHARDS IN FLANDERS, BELGIUM. NEGATIVE RELATIONS WERE DETECTED BETWEEN INTENSIVE FRUIT CULTIVATION WITHIN 250 M AROUND THE ORCHARDS AND BOTH POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS AND WILD POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE. HONEYBEE ABUNDANCE ON CHERRY BLOSSOM WAS POSITIVELY RELATED WITH INTENSIVE FRUIT CULTIVATION WITHIN 1000 M. SWEET CHERRY FRUIT SET DECREASED WITH INCREASING INTENSIVE FRUIT CULTIVATION WITHIN 250 M AND 1000 M AROUND THE ORCHARDS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTENSIVE LAND USE SUCH AS INTENSIVE FRUIT CULTIVATION CAN UNDERMINE THE POLLINATION SERVICE OF WILD POLLINATORS. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF THIS POLLINATION SERVICE WAS NOT COMPENSATED BY HONEYBEES. IN THESE INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES THE PRODUCTION OF SWEET CHERRY IS BELOW THE OPTIMUM, INDUCING A CLEAR YIELD GAP. IN ORDER TO GAIN THE FULL BENEFIT OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, THE POLLINATION SERVICE NEEDS TO BE OPTIMISED.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURE AND ASSOCIATED LOSS OF HABITAT HETEROGENEITY IS A KEY DRIVER OF GLOBAL DECLINES IN INSECT POLLINATORS. POLLINATORS UTILISE DIFFERENT HABITATS TO MEET RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE-SPAN AND IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT THEIR CONSERVATION REQUIRES A LANDSCAPE-SCALE APPROACH. INFORMATION ON THE MECHANISMS DRIVING INSECT POLLINATORS AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE IS, HOWEVER, LACKING. TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, THIS NOVEL STUDY EXPLORES HOW POLLINATORS UTILISE DIFFERENT HABITATS WITHIN A LANDSCAPE AND HOW UTILISATION CHANGES OVER THE SEASON. FLORAL RESOURCES AND INSECT POLLINATORS (I.E. BUMBLEBEE, BUTTERFLIES AND HOVERFLIES) WERE MONITORED DURING PEAK POLLINATOR ACTIVITY PERIODS ON A WIDE RANGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN AN INTENSIVE GRASSLAND LANDSCAPE. THE AVAILABILITY OF KEY FORAGING RESOURCES DIFFERED BETWEEN SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS AND THIS WAS STRONGLY LINKED TO THEIR UTILISATION BY POLLINATORS. FLORAL RESOURCES WERE MOST ABUNDANT AND DIVERSE IN ROAD VERGES, RIPARIAN BUFFER STRIPS AND OPEN SCRUB. THESE WERE KEY HABITATS FOR BUTTERFLIES, WITH ROAD VERGES AND BUFFER STRIPS ALSO BEING IMPORTANT FOR HOVERFLIES AND BUMBLEBEES. THE RELATIVE VALUE OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS IN PROVIDING FLORAL RESOURCES CHANGED THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. POLLINATORS APPEARED TO RESPOND TO CHANGES IN KEY FLORAL RESOURCES, DYNAMICALLY USING DIFFERENT SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS. MAINTAINING LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS TO ENSURE RESOURCE DIVERSITY AND CONTINUITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO POLLINATOR CONSERVATION.

LANDIS DA,LANDIS DA,DESIGNING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES FOR BIODIVERSITY-BASED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,BASIC APPL. ECOL.,"SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED TO FEED AND FUEL A GROWING HUMAN POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT MODEL OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION WHICH PRODUCES HIGH YIELDS HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY, ECOLOGICAL FUNCTION, AND CRITICAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. A KEY CONSEQUENCE OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION IS LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION, WHERE ONCE HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES CONTAIN INCREASINGLY FEWER CROP AND NON-CROP HABITATS. LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION EXACERBATES BIODIVERSITY LOSSES WHICH LEADS TO REDUCTIONS IN ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ON WHICH AGRICULTURE DEPENDS. IN RECENT DECADES, CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON MITIGATING THESE NEGATIVE IMPACTS, PRIMARILY VIA MANAGEMENT OF HABITATS TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY AND ENHANCE SERVICES AT THE LOCAL SCALE. WHILE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS INTERACT, MODIFYING OVERALL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IS SELDOM CONSIDERED DUE TO LOGISTICAL CONSTRAINTS. I PROPOSE THAT THE LOSS OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES DUE TO LANDSCAPE SIMPLIFICATION CAN ONLY BE ADDRESSED BY A CONCERTED EFFORT TO FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. DESIGNING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES WILL REQUIRE THAT SCIENTISTS WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE MIX OF DESIRED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, EVALUATE CURRENT LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE IN LIGHT OF THOSE GOALS, AND IMPLEMENT TARGETED MODIFICATIONS TO ACHIEVE THEM. I EVALUATE THE CURRENT STATUS OF LANDSCAPE DESIGN, RANGING FROM FUNDAMENTAL ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO RESULTING GUIDELINES AND SOCIOECONOMIC TOOLS. WHILE RESEARCH GAPS REMAIN, THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR ECOLOGISTS TO ENGAGE WITH OTHER DISCIPLINES, STAKEHOLDERS, AND POLICYMAKERS IN EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY TO FOSTER AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE DESIGN FOR SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT BIODIVERSITY SERVICES.

LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH URBANIZATION IMPACTS WILD BEE COMMUNITIES, OR THE TYPES OF URBAN GREEN SPACES THAT BEST PROMOTE THEIR CONSERVATION IN CITIES. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE WILD BEE COMMUNITY DIVERSITY, STRUCTURE, AND DYNAMICS IN TWO CANADIAN CITIES, MONTREAL AND QUEBEC CITY. A SECOND OBJECTIVE WAS TO COMPARE FUNCTIONAL TRAIT DIVERSITY AMONG THREE HABITAT TYPES (CEMETERIES, COMMUNITY GARDENS AND URBAN PARKS) WITHIN EACH CITY. BEES WERE COLLECTED USING PAN TRAPS AND NETTING ON THE SAME 46 SITES, MULTIPLE TIMES, OVER THE ACTIVE SEASON IN 2012 AND 2013. A TOTAL OF 32,237 SPECIMENS WERE IDENTIFIED, REPRESENTING 200 SPECIES AND 6 FAMILIES, INCLUDING TWO NEW CONTINENTAL RECORDS, HYLAEUS COMMUNIS NYLANDER (1852) AND ANTHIDIUM FLORENTINUM (FABRICIUS, 1775). DESPITE HIGH COMMUNITY EVENNESS, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT ABUNDANCE OF DIVERSE SPECIES, INCLUDING EXOTIC ONES. SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS SHOWED HIGHER STABILITY IN THE MOST URBANIZED CITY (MONTREAL) BUT LOW NESTEDNESS OF SPECIES ASSEMBLAGES AMONG THE THREE URBAN HABITATS IN BOTH CITIES. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT CITIES ARE HOME TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES OF WILD BEES, BUT IN TURN AFFECT BEE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS.

WE STUDIED THE EFFECTS OF URBANIZATION ON FLOWER-FEEDING INSECTS BY USING DATA FROM A CITIZEN SCIENCE PROGRAM IN THE PARISIAN REGION. WE ANALYSED THE OCCURRENCE OF INSECTS FROM 46 DIFFERENT FAMILIES ON FLOWERS OF DIFFERENT MORPHOLOGIES, USING LANDSCAPE INDICES IN BUFFER AREAS FROM A 100-M TO A 4000-M RADIUS AROUND 1194 SAMPLED SITES. OUR AIMS WERE TO DETERMINE (I) HOW THE PROPORTION OF IMPERVIOUS AREA AROUND SAMPLED SITES AFFECTED THE OCCURRENCE OF FLOWER-FEEDING INSECT FAMILIES AND AT WHICH LANDSCAPE SCALES IMPERVIOUS AREA CALCULATIONS BEST PREDICTED THESE OCCURRENCES, (II) THE EFFECT OF COROLLA SHAPE VARIABLES ON INSECT FAMILY OCCURRENCES. TWENTY-ONE FAMILIES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING PROPORTION OF IMPERVIOUS AREAS (URBANOPHOBIC) AND 3 WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED (URBANOPHILIC). URBANOPHOBIC FAMILIES WERE MOST AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF IMPERVIOUS AREAS WHEN IT WAS ESTIMATED WITHIN BUFFERS OF 200-M TO 1400-M RADII, DEPENDING ON THE FAMILY. NOTABLE LOSSES OF URBANOPHOBIC FAMILIES WERE DETECTED AT LESS THAN 50\% OF IMPERVIOUS AREAS, WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE THREAT TO THE DIVERSITY OF FLOWER-FEEDING INSECTS POSED BY URBAN SPRAWL. COROLLA SHAPE VARIABLES WERE THE VARIABLES MOST OFTEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPLICATED IN THE OCCURRENCE OF INSECT FAMILIES. URBANOPHOBIC FAMILIES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE TUBULAR SHAPE OF FLOWERS, AND TUBULAR COROLLAS WERE FOUND MORE OFTEN IN URBANIZED AREAS.

ANTS ARE ATTRACTED BY EXTRAFLORAL NECTARIES (EFNS), SITUATED NEAR FLOWERS, AND MAY INTERFERE WITH THE EFFICIENCY AND BEHAVIOUR OF POLLINATORS. WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE IMPACTS OF ANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IN PLANT-POLLINATOR SYSTEMS ARE DEPENDENT ON (1) THE SEASONAL ACTIVITY OF EFNS, WHICH INCREASE ANT ABUNDANCE CLOSER TO FLOWERS, (2) CONSEQUENTLY, AN ANT EFFECT, WHERE ANTS DECREASE THE TEMPORAL NICHE OVERLAP OF BEES DUE TO PREDATOR AVOIDANCE, AND (3) ANT DENSITY, WHERE HIGHER DENSITIES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS AND PLANT PERFORMANCE. WE STUDIED TWO ANT-PLANT-POLLINATOR SYSTEMS BASED ON BANISTERIOPSIS CAMPESTRIS AND BANISTERIOPSIS MALIFOLIA PLANT SPECIES. THE PERIODS OF HIGH ANT ABUNDANCE COINCIDED WITH PLANT SPECIES BLOOMING. THE PRESENCE OF ANTS AROUND FLOWERS REDUCED THE VISITATION RATES OF THE SMALLER BEES AND THE TEMPORAL NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN BEE SPECIES WAS NOT HIGHER THAN RANDOMLY EXPECTED WHEN ANTS HAD FREE ACCESS. ADDITIONALLY, WE OBSERVED VARIABLE ANT EFFECTS ON FRUIT SET AND DURATION OF BEE VISITS TO BOTH MALPIGHIACEAE SPECIES WHEN ANT DENSITY WAS EXPERIMENTALLY KEPT CONSTANT ON BRANCHES, ESPECIALLY ON B. CAMPESTRIS. OUR GOAL WAS TO SHOW THE DUAL ROLE OF ANT DENSITY EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES ARE NOT COMMONLY OBSERVED IN THE SAME PLANT SPECIES. WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCED TEMPORAL NICHE OVERLAP BETWEEN FLORAL VISITORS DUE TO ANT PRESENCE PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALLER BEES TO IMPROVE COMPATIBLE POLLINATION BEHAVIOUR.

FURTHERMORE, THE NECTAR OF R. TUMJENSIS FLOWERS IS AVAILABLE TO THE SHORTER TONGUED BUMBLEBEES WHILE R. PURPUREA NECTAR IS LESS ACCESSIBLE, REQUIRING DEEP PROBING FROM LONG-TONGUED FLIES. ALTHOUGH FLOWERING PHENOLOGY IS A STRONG CURRENT BARRIER THAT SEEMINGLY OBVIATES ANY NEED FOR POLLINATOR DISCRIMINATION, THIS CURRENT PATTERN NEED NOT REFLECT SELECTIVE FORCES OCCURRING AT THE INITIAL DIVERGENCE OF R. TUMJENSIS. THERE HAS BEEN CONSIDERABLE POLLINATOR SWITCHING DURING THE RADIATION OF THE HIMALAYAN ROSCOEA, AND THE ASSOCIATION OF FLOWERING TIME WITH TYPE OF POLLINATOR IN THESE SYMPATRIC SPECIES MAY HAVE ORIGINATED AMONG THE EARLIEST OR LATEST FLOWERING INDIVIDUALS OR POPULATIONS OF AN ANCESTOR TO EXPLOIT EITHER BUMBLEBEE ACTIVITY EARLY IN THE BREEDING SEASON OR LONG-TONGUED FLY ABUNDANCE LATER IN THE SEASON.

CONSERV.,"MOUNTING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF WILD BEES. INCREASING HABITAT THAT PROVIDES FORAGE AND NESTING SITES COULD BOOST STRUGGLING POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN, SUBURBAN AND AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE MILLIONS OF ACRES BENEATH AERIAL ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION LINES, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS EASEMENTS OR RIGHTS-OF-WAY, MUST BE KEPT FREE OF TALL-GROWING VEGETATION AND HENCE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SUITABLE HABITAT FOR MANY NATIVE SPECIES. PRIOR WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT BEE COMMUNITIES IN EASEMENTS MANAGED USING ALTERNATIVES TO EPISODIC MOWING WERE MORE DIVERSE THAN IN NEARBY OPEN AREAS, HOWEVER TRUE CONTROL SITES WITHIN THE EASEMENTS WERE UNAVAILABLE. IN ORDER TO COMPARE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS, WE CONDUCTED A TWO-YEAR STUDY WHICH ENABLED US TO DIRECTLY COMPARE TRANSMISSION LINE EASEMENTS IN THREE LOCATIONS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING INTEGRATED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT-A DYNAMIC FORM OF MANAGEMENT INVOLVING SPOT REMOVAL AND HERBICIDE TREATMENT OF UNWANTED SPECIES (TREATMENT) WITH NEARBY SITES UNDERGOING STANDARD MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS OF YEARLY OR BIYEARLY MOWING (CONTROL). RESULTS SHOW THAT TREATMENT SITES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS THAN CONTROLS. SEASONAL DIFFERENCES WERE PRONOUNCED, WITH THE SPRING FAUNA MOST AFFECTED BY DIFFERENCES IN VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE OLDER TREATMENT SITES HOUSE MORE SOCIAL BEES, MORE PARASITIC SPECIES AND A MORE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF BEES ACROSS NESTING GUILDS. FINALLY, WE ESTABLISHED THAT TREATMENT SITES HAD DISTINCT BEE COMMUNITIES, FURTHER INCREASING THEIR VALUE AS SOURCES FOR NATIVE BEE POPULATIONS IN THE LANDSCAPE.

HERE WE PRESENT AN AGENT BASED MODEL (ABM) THAT SIMULATES THE MOVEMENT OF BEES OVER HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES AND CAPTURES POLLINATION EVENTS, ENABLING THE INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE PATTERN ON POLLINATION NETWORKS TO BE EXPLORED. USING THE MODEL, WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS USING VIRTUAL LANDSCAPES REPRESENTING A GRADIENT OF FOREST LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION. THE ABM WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE EXPECTED TRENDS IN NETWORK STRUCTURE, FROM SIMULATIONS OF INTERACTIONS BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PLANTS AND POLLINATORS. FOR EXAMPLE, RESULTS INDICATED AN INCREASE IN THE INDEX OF COMPLEMENTARY SPECIALIZATION (H-2') AND A DECLINE IN NETWORK CONNECTANCE WITH INCREASING FOREST COVER. FURTHERMORE, NETWORK NESTEDNESS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEGREE OF FOREST COVER, BUT WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO FOREST PATCH SIZE, FURTHER SUPPORTING RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE FIELD. THIS ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF ABMS FOR EXPLORING THE STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS, AND FOR UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THEM.

BODE RF;TONG R,BODE RF,"POLLINATORS EXERT POSITIVE SELECTION ON FLOWER SIZE ON URBAN, BUT NOT ON RURAL SCOTCH BROOM (CYTISUS SCOPARIUS L. LINK)",JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,J. PLANT ECOL.,"ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION OF INVASIVE SPECIES IS BOTH PARTICULARLY EXCITING FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST AND WORRISOME FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN CONTROLLING OR HALTING SPREAD. INVASIVE SPECIES OFTEN HAVE A DISTINCT TIMELINE AND WELL-RECORDED POPULATION EXPANSION. AS INVADERS ENCOUNTER NEW ENVIRONMENTS, THEY UNDERGO RAPID ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION. OUR AIM IN THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE VARIATION OF FLORAL SIZE IN THE INVASIVE SHRUB CYTISUS SCOPARIUS (SCOTCH BROOM) AND MEASURE NATURAL SELECTION BY POLLINATORS ON THAT TRAIT. PAST RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT THIS INVASIVE PLANT IS POLLINATOR LIMITED IN WASHINGTON STATE AND THAT DECLINES IN POLLINATOR POPULATIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION IN ANOTHER INVADED RANGE (NEW ZEALAND). THIS PLANT IS POLLINATED BY BOTH NATIVE AND INTRODUCED SPECIES OF BEES, REPRESENTING A BROAD RANGE OF POLLINATOR SIZES. CYTISUS SCOPARIUS HAS A FLOWER STRUCTURE THAT IS HIGHLY CONDUCIVE TO STUDIES ON POLLINATOR CHOICE, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF DIRECT POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS. WE SURVEYED URBAN AND RURAL SITES IN AND AROUND THE CITY OF OLYMPIA IN WASHINGTON STATE. MEASURING BANNER WIDTH, WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT FLOWER SIZE VARIES SUBSTANTIALLY BETWEEN PLANTS BUT MINIMALLY WITHIN PLANTS. BY MEASURING THE PROPORTION OF FLOWERS THAT WERE `TRIPPED', WE COULD DETERMINE POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES AND THUS DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF SELECTION DUE TO POLLINATOR CHOICE ALONE. WE FOUND THAT C. SCOPARIUS IS UNDER NATURAL SELECTION BY POLLINATORS FOR INCREASED FLOWER SIZE. HOWEVER, SUCH POSITIVE NATURAL SELECTION WAS ONLY SEEN IN URBAN POPULATIONS ALTHOUGH IT WAS CONSISTENT ACROSS TWO FLOWERING SEASONS. RURAL POPULATIONS OF SCOTCH BROOM DO NOT APPEAR TO BE UNDER SELECTION ON FLOWER SIZE. THE NATURAL SELECTION BY POLLINATORS ON BROOM FLOWERS COULD RESULT IN ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION INTO A NEW POLLINATION NICHE BY AN INVADING SPECIES. A HIGHER LEVEL OF VARIATION IN BROOM FLOWERS SEEN HERE THAN SEEN IN PREVIOUS WORKS IN NATIVE REGIONS SUGGESTS THAT C.

ALTHOUGH PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, ESPECIALLY ALFALFA SEED, HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON THIS SPECIES' POLLINATION PROFICIENCY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW M. ROTUNDATA IS AFFECTED BY INSECTICIDE EXPOSURE. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RISK POSED TO M. ROTUNDATA BY THE INCREASING USE OF INSECTICIDES TO MANAGE MOSQUITOES, WE CONDUCTED FIELD EXPERIMENTS THAT DIRECTLY EXPOSED M.

WE DIRECTLY TARGETED NEST SHELTERS WITH ZENIVEX (R) E20 (ETOFENPROX) AT A HALF-MAXIMUM RATE OF 0.0032 KG/HA AT DUSK AND THEN OBSERVED LARVAL MORTALITY, ADULT MORTALITY, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPLETED NESTS FOR BOTH THE TREATED AND CONTROL GROUPS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPORTION OF DEAD (P=0.99) AND ALIVE (P=0.23) LARVAE WHEN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS COMPARED WITH THE TREATED GROUP. WE ALSO DID NOT OBSERVE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF EMERGED ADULTS REARED FROM THE TREATED SHELTERS (P=0.22 AND 0.50 FOR FEMALES AND MALES, RESPECTIVELY), AND THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED CELLS AFTER EXPOSURE TO THE INSECTICIDES CONTINUED TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, INDICATING THAT PROVISIONING ADULTS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE INSECTICIDE TREATMENT.

WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS POLICY IN REDUCING THE EXPOSURE RISK TO HONEYBEES BY COLLECTING 130 SAMPLES OF HONEY FROM BEE KEEPERS ACROSS THE UK BEFORE (2014: N=21) AND AFTER THE MORATORIUM WAS IN EFFECT (2015: N=109). NEONICOTINOIDS WERE PRESENT IN ABOUT HALF OF THE HONEY SAMPLES TAKEN BEFORE THE MORATORIUM, AND THEY WERE PRESENT IN OVER A FIFTH OF HONEY SAMPLES FOLLOWING THE MORATORIUM. CLOTHIANIDIN WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY DETECTED NEONICOTINOID. NEONICOTINOID CONCENTRATIONS DECLINED FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER IN THE YEAR FOLLOWING THE BAN. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF POST-MORATORIUM NEONICOTINOID RESIDUES WERE FROM HONEY HARVESTED EARLY IN THE YEAR, COINCIDING WITH OILSEED RAPE FLOWERING. NEONICOTINOID CONCENTRATIONS WERE CORRELATED WITH THE AREA OF OILSEED RAPE SURROUNDING THE HIVE LOCATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST MASS FLOWERING CROPS MAY CONTAIN NEONICOTINOID RESIDUES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN GROWN ON SOILS CONTAMINATED BY PREVIOUSLY SEED TREATED CROPS. THIS MAY INCLUDE WINTER SEED TREATMENTS APPLIED TO CEREALS THAT ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPT FROM EU RESTRICTIONS.

ALEBACHEW GW,ALEBACHEW GW,ECONOMIC VALUE OF POLLINATION SERVICE OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS IN ETHIOPIA: BIOLOGICAL POLLINATORS,JOURNAL OF APICULTURAL SCIENCE,J. APIC. SCI.,"THE MOST IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICE FOR SUSTAINABLE CROP PRODUCTION IS POLLINATION, THE MUTUALISTIC INTERACTION BETWEEN PLANTS AND ANIMALS. HONEYBEES ARE BEING INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN THIS PROCESS. THE TOTAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF CROP POLLINATION WORLDWIDE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT (SIC)153 BILLION ANNUALLY. ANIMAL POLLINATION OF AGRICULTURAL CROPS IS PROVIDED BY BOTH MANAGED AND WILD POLLINATORS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF POLLINATION SERVICES AND VULNERABILITY OF ETHIOPIAN AGRICULTURE IN THE FACE OF POLLINATOR DECLINE. AN IMPROVED APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF POLLINATION (EVP) SERVICES IS APPLIED TO MULTIPLY A CROP'S TOTAL VALUE BY A COEFFICIENT BETWEEN ZERO AND ONE REPRESENTING THE CROPS DEPENDENCY ON POLLINATION SERVICES FOR PRODUCTION. THE POTENTIAL PRODUCTION VALUE LOSS DUE TO LACK OF POLLINATORS IS ALSO COMPUTED AS THE RATIO OF EVP TO ECONOMIC PRODUCTION VALUE. THEN EVP WAS \$ 815.2 MILLION DOLLARS AND VULNERABILITY OF ETHIOPIAN AGRICULTURE DUE TO LACK OF POLLINATORS 16\% IN THE 2015/16 CROP PRODUCTION SEASON. THE REGIONAL STATE OF OROMIA BENEFITED THE MOST FOLLOWED BY THE REGIONAL STATES OF AMHARA AND SOUTH NATION NATIONALITY PEOPLE (SNPP). COFFEE, THE LEADING CROP, HAS THE HIGHEST EVP IN THE COUNTRY FOLLOWED BY FABA BEANS AND NUG (GUIZOTIA ABYSSINICA). ETHIOPIA HAS HIGHLY BENEFITED FROM BIOLOGICAL POLLINATORS, SO PROTECTING THEM HAS SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE COUNTRYS ECONOMY.

BIOL.,"GYNODIOECY, THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF FEMALES AND HERMAPHRODITES, IS ARGUABLY THE MOST COMMON ANGIOSPERM GENDER POLYMORPHISM IN MANY FLORAE. FEMALES' ABILITY TO INVADE AND PERSIST AMONG HERMAPHRODITES DEPENDS, IN PART, ON POLLINATORS PROVIDING ADEQUATE POLLINATION TO FEMALES. WE DIRECTLY MEASURED DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATORS' CONTRIBUTIONS TO FEMALE AND HERMAPHRODITE SEED PRODUCTION IN ARTIFICIAL POPULATIONS OF GYNODIOECIOUS SILENE VULGARIS BY EXPERIMENTALLY RESTRICTING POLLINATOR ACCESS. WE FOUND THAT FEMALE RELATIVE SEED PRODUCTION IN THIS SYSTEM DEPENDED STRONGLY ON POLLINATION CONTEXT: FEMALES PRODUCED MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY SEEDS AS HERMAPHRODITES IN THE CONTEXT OF ABUNDANT, NECTAR-COLLECTING MOTHS. CONVERSELY, FEMALES SHOWED NO SEED PRODUCTION ADVANTAGE IN THE CONTEXT OF POLLEN-COLLECTING SYRPHID FLIES AND BEES DUE TO ACUTELY HERMAPHRODITE-BIASED VISITATION. WE INFER THAT VARIATION IN POLLINATOR TYPE, BEHAVIOUR AND ABUNDANCE MAY BE IMPORTANT FOR ACHIEVING THE FEMALE RELATIVE FITNESS THRESHOLDS NECESSARY FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF GYNODIOECY. GENERALLY, OUR STUDY ILLUSTRATES HOW POLLINATOR-MEDIATED MECHANISMS MAY INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF BREEDING SYSTEMS AND ASSOCIATED SUITES OF FLORAL TRAITS. SEGMENTS OF A POLLINATOR COMMUNITY MAY FACILITATE GYNODIOECY BY SELECTING FOR PLANT CHARACTERISTICS THAT INCREASE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF BOTH SEXES TO POLLINATORS, SUCH AS NECTAR REWARDS.

BUXTON MN;ANDERSON BJ;HOARE RJB;LORD JM,BUXTON MN,ARE MOTHS THE MISSING POLLINATORS IN SUBANTARCTIC NEW ZEALAND?,POLAR RESEARCH,POLAR RES.,"ON OFFSHORE ISLANDS, FLOWERS ARE TYPICALLY SMALL, SIMPLE IN COLOUR AND SHAPE AND MORE RELIANT ON WIND- OR SELF-POLLINATION THAN INSECT-MEDIATED POLLINATION. ISLANDS ALSO TEND TO HAVE A SPECIES-POOR POLLINATING FAUNA. THE NEW ZEALAND SUBANTARCTIC ISLANDS (LATITUDE BETWEEN ABOUT 46 DEGREES AND 60 DEGREES) HAVE A DEPAUPERATE POLLINATOR FAUNA. HOWEVER, MANY FLOWERS IN THIS REGION ARE LARGE, BRIGHTLY COLOURED AND APPARENTLY COMPLETELY RELIANT ON INSECT VISITORS FOR POLLINATION. IN THE ABSENCE OF BEES AND BUTTERFLIES, MOTHS AND FLIES MAY BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT POLLINATORS IN THE REGION. USING SIX HEATH MOTH TRAPS SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER FOUR NIGHTS IN THREE DIFFERENT HABITAT TYPES, 241 MOTHS WERE CAUGHT, REPRESENTING SIX SPECIES. WE FOUND THAT MOTHS CARRIED POLLEN IDENTIFIED TO FOUR PLANT SPECIES (BULBINELLA ROSSII, DRACOPHYLLUM LONGIFOLIUM, GENTIANELLA CONCINNA AND ACAENA MINOR), WITH B. ROSSII AND D. LONGIFOLIUM POLLEN BEING MOST ABUNDANT ON MOTH BODIES. WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPLAINED MOTH ABUNDANCE AND DISTRIBUTION, BUT NEITHER WEATHER NOR THE NUMBER OF MOTHS CAUGHT WERE RELIABLE PREDICTORS OF THEIR POTENTIAL AS POLLINATORS, MOTHS CARRIED ON AVERAGE MORE POLLEN GRAINS FROM MORE PLANT SPECIES IN THE SHRUBLAND DESPITE HARSH WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FEW INDIVIDUALS CAUGHT. LOCAL FLOWERING ABUNDANCES MAY HELP EXPLAIN THIS TREND, WITH THE PREDOMINANCE OF D. LONGIFOLIUM FLOWERING IN THE SHRUBLAND AND B. ROSSII IN THE EXPOSED MEGAHERB FIELD.

HERE, WE ANALYZE THE SUCCESSIONAL CHANGES IN THE BEE COMMUNITY IN A MEXICAN TROPICAL DRY FOREST, BY INTEGRATING TAXONOMIC (SPECIES, GENUS, AND FAMILY DIVERSITY) AND FUNCTIONAL (SOCIABILITY, NESTING STRATEGY, AND BODY SIZE) INFORMATION FOR BEES. OVER ONE YEAR, IN A SUCCESSIONAL CHRONOSEQUENCE (2-67 YEARS AFTER ABANDONMENT) WE COLLECTED 469 INDIVIDUAL BEES, REPRESENTING FIVE FAMILIES, 36 GENERA, AND 69 SPECIES. LINEAR MODELING SHOWED DECREASES IN TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY WITH SUCCESSION, MORE STRONGLY SO FOR SPECIES. BEE SPECIES TURNOVER ALONG SUCCESSION RANGED FROM MODERATE TO HIGH, DECREASING SLIGHTLY AT INTERMEDIATE STAGES. AN RLQ ANALYSIS (ORDINATION METHOD THAT ALLOWS RELATING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES WITH FUNCTIONAL ATTRIBUTES) REVEALED CLEAR RELATIONS BETWEEN BEE FUNCTIONAL TRAITS AND THE PLANT COMMUNITY. RLQ AXIS 1 WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO VEGETATION STRUCTURAL AND DIVERSITY VARIABLES, AND TO EUSOCIALITY, WHILE SOLITARY, PARASOCIALITY, AND GROUND NESTING WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT. EARLY SUCCESSIONAL FALLOWS ATTRACT MOSTLY SOLITARY AND PARASOCIAL BEES, OLDER FALLOWS TEND TO ATTRACT EUSOCIAL BEES WITH AERIAL NESTING. THE CONTINUOUS TAXONOMIC TURNOVER OBSERVED BY US AND THE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS SUGGEST THAT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OLD FALLOWS FROM AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS AND EVEN LOCAL EXTINCTIONS OF PARTICULAR BEE GUILDS. CONSIDERING THE LOW VIABILITY OF PRESERVING LARGE MATURE TROPICAL DRY FOREST TRACTS, THE CONSERVATION OF OLDER SUCCESSIONAL STANDS EMERGES AS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT.",BEE GUILDS; EUSOCIALITY; FLOWER VISITORS; NESTING HABIT; PARASOCIALITY; SECONDARY SUCCESSION; SOLITARY BEES,SPECIES TRAITS; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; HYMENOPTERA APOIDEA; FORAGING RANGES; DIVERSITY; CONSERVATION; PLANT; DISTURBANCE; RESPONSES; PATTERNS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"MEAVE, JA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT ECOL \& RECURSOS NAT, MEXICO CITY, DF, MEXICO.;RAMOS-FABIEL, MELBI A., PEREZ-GARCIA, EDUARDO A., GONZALEZ, EDGAR J., MEAVE, JORGE A., UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT ECOL \& RECURSOS NAT, MEXICO CITY, DF, MEXICO.;YANEZ-ORDONEZ, OLIVIA, UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT BIOL EVOLUT, MEXICO CITY, DF, MEXICO.",10.1111/BTP.12619,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,SEP-CONACYTCONSEJO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA Y TECNOLOGIA (CONACYT) [CB-2009-01-128136]; PAPIIT-UNAMPROGRAMA DE APOYO A PROYECTOS DE INVESTIGACION E INNOVACION TECNOLOGICA (PAPIIT)UNIVERSIDAD NACIONAL AUTONOMA DE MEXICO [IN218416],"SEP-CONACYT, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: CB-2009-01-128136; PAPIIT-UNAM, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: IN218416",0006-3606,1,62-74,WILEY,51,2019,ISI000457405800007,104,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,11,ECOLOGY,JORGE.MEAVECIENCIAS.UNAM.MX,HJ7VQ,"MEAVE, JA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC CIENCIAS, DEPT ECOL \& RECURSOS NAT, MEXICO CITY, DF, MEXICO",ISI,none,UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO;UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO,UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO,NA,"RAMOS-FABIEL MA, 2019, BIOTROPICA","RAMOS-FABIEL MA, 2019, BIOTROPICA",NA,NA,NA,NA

ZOOL.,"THE TOMATO IS WIDELY CULTIVATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND REQUIRES POLLINATION BY WILD OR MANAGED BEES TO REALIZE ITS FULL-POTENTIAL FRUIT PRODUCTION. TWO DIFFERENT SAMPLING METHODS (PAN TRAPPING AND ACTIVE SAMPLING) WERE EMPLOYED IN NINE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES FROM JUNE TO SEPTEMBER OF 2011 TO INVESTIGATE THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF NATIVE BEE SPECIES PRESENT IN TOMATO CROPS OF CENTER-WEST BRAZIL. A TOTAL OF 465 INDIVIDUALS OF 44 SPECIES WERE COLLECTED, WITH THE COMPOSITION OF SAMPLED BEE SPECIES DIFFERING BETWEEN THE METHODS USED. TWENTY-TWO SPECIES WERE EXCLUSIVELY CAPTURED IN PAN TRAPS, 13 OTHERS THROUGH ACTIVE SAMPLING AND NINE BY BOTH METHODS. MOST OF THE SAMPLED BEE SPECIES CAN BE CONSIDERED EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS OF THE TOMATO BECAUSE THEY CAN PERFORM BUZZ-POLLINATION. BY VIBRATION, THESE BEES CAN LIBERATE POLLEN FROM ANTHERS INTO THE AIR OR ONTO THEIR OWN BODIES AND THE STIGMAS OF THE SAME FLOWER BECAUSE THE STIGMAS OF THE STUDIED TOMATO VARIETY ARE WITHIN THE ANTHER CONE. BOTH METHODS EXCLUSIVELY SAMPLED SOME SPECIES OF BUZZ-POLLINATING BEES, HOWEVER, PAN-TRAPPING CAPTURED BUZZING AND NON-BUZZING VISITORS INDISCRIMINATELY WHILE ACTIVE SAMPLING CAPTURED MORE BUZZING BEES.

ZHANG B;CLASSEN-BOCKHOFF R,ZHANG B,SEX-DIFFERENTIAL REPRODUCTION SUCCESS AND SELECTION ON FLORAL TRAITS IN GYNODIOECIOUS SALVIA PRATENSIS,BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,BMC PLANT BIOL.,"BACKGROUND: GYNODIOECY, A SEXUAL SYSTEM WITH HERMAPHRODITE AND FEMALE INDIVIDUALS IN A POPULATION, RAISES THE QUESTION HOW THE TWO SEXUAL MORPHS ARE MAINTAINED. SALVIA PRATENSIS IS A GYNODIOECIOUS SPECIES FEATURED BY ITS MODIFIED STAMENS THAT ACT AS A LEVER MECHANISM IN POLLINATION. GIVEN SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN FLORAL TRAITS OF THE SPECIES, IT IS PREDICTABLE THAT TWO SEXUAL MORPHS DIFFER IN THEIR INTERPLAY WITH POLLINATORS AND THUS IN THEIR FITNESS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED SEX-SPECIFIC REPRODUCTION SUCCESS AND FLORAL ADAPTATION IN A POPULATION OF S. PRATENSIS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT TWO SEXUAL MORPHS IN S. PRATENSIS DISTINCTLY DIFFERED IN THEIR FLORAL PROPORTIONS. FEMALE FLOWERS FITTED BETTER TO THE POLLINATORS THAN HERMAPHRODITES IN TERMS OF TOUCHING THE STIGMAS WHEN BEING PROBED, AND HENCE WERE MORE EFFICIENT IN POLLEN DEPOSITION. FLORAL TRAITS OVERALL UNDERWENT STRONGER SELECTION IN THE POPULATION, WITH STIGMA POSITION AND COROLLA LENGTH SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIVE SELECTION MEDIATED BY DIFFERENT BODY-SIZED BUMBLE BEES, SOME SELECTIONS ON FLORAL TRAITS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE STRENGTH, EVEN OPPOSITE IN THE DIRECTION BETWEEN TWO MORPHS. FLOWER PRODUCTION TENDED TO BE UNDER CORRELATIONAL SELECTION WITH FLORAL STRUCTURAL TRAITS, IMPLYING THAT A LARGE PLANT WITH MANY FLOWERS DID NOT SHOW AN ADVANTAGE IN FITNESS UNLESS ITS FLOWER CONSTRUCTION MECHANICALLY MATCHED THE POLLINATORS WELL. CONCLUSIONS: IN CONCLUSION, THE POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION LIKELY PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE EVOLUTION AND MAINTENANCE OF SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN THE GYNODIOECIOUS S. PRATENSIS, AND SEX-DIVERGENT MECHANICAL INTERACTION WITH POLLINATORS SERVED AS A CRITICAL MECHANISM BY WHICH FEMALE INDIVIDUALS WERE MAINTAINED IN THE POPULATION WITH A FEMALE ADVANTAGE IN POLLEN DEPOSITION EFFICIENCY (I.E. RECEIVING POLLEN).",EVOLUTIONARY DIVERGENCE; FEMALE ADVANTAGE; GYNODIOECY; POLLINATION; PHENOTYPIC SELECTION; REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE; SALVIA; SEXUAL DIMORPHISM,STAMINAL LEVER MECHANISM; CYTOPLASMIC MALE-STERILITY; POLLINATOR VISITATION; L.

JENSEN AM;SCHAMP BS;BELLEAU A,JENSEN AM,EVIDENCE OF TEMPORAL NICHE SEPARATION VIA LOW FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP IN AN OLD-FIELD PLANT COMMUNITY,OECOLOGIA,OECOLOGIA,"FLOWERING TIME IS A TRAIT THAT REFLECTS THE TIMING OF SPECIFIC RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS BY PLANTS. CONSEQUENTLY, SEVERAL PREDICTIONS HAVE BEEN MADE RELATED TO HOW SPECIES ARE ASSEMBLED WITHIN COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO FLOWERING TIME. STRONG OVERLAP IN FLOWERING TIME AMONG COEXISTING SPECIES MAY RESULT FROM CLUSTERED ABIOTIC RESOURCES, OR CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED POLLINATION SUCCESS. CONVERSELY, LOW FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP (ASYNCHRONY) AMONG COEXISTING SPECIES MAY REDUCE COMPETITION FOR SOIL, LIGHT, OR POLLINATOR RESOURCES AND ALLEVIATE INTERSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER. HERE, WE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT COEXISTING SPECIES IN AN OLD-FIELD COMMUNITY GENERALLY OVERLAP LESS IN FLOWERING TIME THAN EXPECTED UNDER A COMMONLY USED AND STATISTICALLY VALIDATED NULL MODEL. FLOWERING TIME ASYNCHRONY WAS MORE PRONOUNCED WHEN ABUNDANCE DATA WERE USED (COMPARED TO PRESENCE-ABSENCE DATA), AND WHEN ANALYSES FOCUSED ON SPECIES THAT SHARE BEES AS POLLINATORS. CONTROL AND HERBIVORE-EXCLUSION PLOTS DID NOT DIFFER IN FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP, PROVIDING NO EVIDENCE OF THE REDUCTION IN OVERLAP EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM INCREASED COMPETITION. OUR RESULTS VARIED WITH THE RANDOMIZATION ALGORITHM USED, EMPHASIZING THAT THE CHOICE OF ALGORITHM CAN INFLUENCE THE OUTCOME OF NULL MODELS. OUR RESULTS VARIED BETWEEN 2YEARS, WITH PATTERNS BEING LESS CLEAR IN THE SECOND YEAR, WHEN BOTH GROWING SEASON AND FLOWERING TIMES WERE CONTRACTED. FINALLY, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT FURTHER SUPPORTS A PREVIOUS FINDING THAT HIGHER PLOT-LEVEL FLOWERING TIME OVERLAP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF INTRODUCED SPECIES.

CONSERV.,"THE CONSERVATION OF POLLINATOR DIVERSITY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO MAINTAINING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS AND FOOD SECURITY. SOME AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS SUPPORT POLLINATOR DIVERSITY, WHILE OTHERS MAY LEAD TO THEIR DECLINE. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ON POLLINATORS IN TEMPERATE CLIMATES REGIONS, BUT IN TROPICAL REGIONS THESE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED BY ONLY VERY FEW STUDIES. WE CONDUCTED A STUDY IN SOUTHEASTERN MEXICO, IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF THREE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS ON BEE DIVERSITY IN A TROPICAL LANDSCAPE. WE COMPARED 18 SITES AT TWO DIFFERENT SCALES (PLOT SCALE AND LANDSCAPE SCALE). WE FOUND A LINK BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM INTENSITY LEVEL AT THE PLOT SCALE AND FOREST PROPORTION AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE: LAND USE INTENSITY WAS LOW AT BOTH SCALES IN 7 POLYCULTURES, LOW AT PLOT SCALE AND HIGH AT LANDSCAPE SCALE IN 4 PASTURES, AND HIGH AT BOTH SCALES IN 7 MONOCULTURES. WE COLLECTED BEES AT ALL SITES, AND FOUND AN OVERALL HIGH BEE RICHNESS, WITH A TOTAL OF 127 SPECIES. BEE RICHNESS WAS COMPARED ACROSS AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS USING DIVERSITY ACCUMULATION CURVES WITH INEXT PACKAGE. BOTH POLYCULTURES AND PASTURES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RICHNESS AS MONOCULTURES. WE CONSTRUCTED BEE SPECIES GUILDS ACCORDING TO ECOLOGICAL AND LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS (I.E. SIZE, SOCIALITY AND NESTING) AND FOUND THAT WHATEVER THE TRAIT CONSIDERED, THE SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE DIFFERENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS WAS MOST OFTEN AFFECTED IN THE SAME WAY THAN THE COMPLETE COMMUNITY RICHNESS.

RES.,"EUGLOSSINI BEES ARE MORE DIVERSE IN TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL RAINFORESTS IN THE NEOTROPICS AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION MAY HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE OF ALTITUDE. THESE BEES ARE CONSIDERED IMPORTANT POLLINATORS BEING ABLE TO CROSS LONG DISTANCES IN CONTINUOUS FORESTS. EUGLOSSINI MALES COLLECT FRAGRANCES, MAINLY FROM ORCHIDS, USED AS PRECURSORS FOR SEX PHEROMONES, A FACT THAT ALLOWS THE USE OF SYNTHESIZED COMPOUNDS FOR THEIR CAPTURE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE OCCURRENCE OF EUGLOSSINI MALES IN ELEVATED SITES OF A MONTANE RAINFOREST (FROM 960 TO 1,200 M) IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL (ATLANTIC FOREST). SCENT TRAPS WERE DISTRIBUTED AT THREE LOCATIONS IN DIFFERENT ALTITUDES ON ONE DAY PER MONTH OVER 19 MONTHS. SIX TRAPS WITH DIFFERENT BAITS WERE DISTRIBUTED AT EACH LOCATION. OVERALL, THE MALE EUGLOSSINI COMMUNITY PRESENTED A LOW NUMBER OF SPECIES (SEVEN) AND INDIVIDUALS (110). MOREOVER, WE DETECTED A DRASTIC DECAY IN EUGLOSSINI SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WITH INCREASING ALTITUDE, WHICH SUGGESTS A LIMIT FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF EUGLOSSINI POPULATIONS AROUND 1100 M IN THE STUDY AREA. THIS COMMUNITY PRESENTED A HIGH DOMINANCE DEGREE WITH A SINGLE DOMINANT SPECIES (EUGLOSSA ANNECTANS). IN ADDITION, ONLY ONE SPECIES OF PERFUME ORCHID WAS ABUNDANT AND FLOWERED IN THE STUDY AREA DURING OUR SAMPLING PERIOD. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS ORCHID SPECIES CORRESPONDS TO THE OCCURRENCE OF EUGLOSSINI MALES IN THE STUDY AREA.

ECOL. MANAGE.,"POST-WILDFIRE SALVAGE LOGGING IS AN INCREASINGLY USED LAND MANAGEMENT TOOL WITH POORLY UNDERSTOOD ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR UNDERSTORY FLOWERING PLANTS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH POLLINATORS. UNDERSTANDING THESE CONSEQUENCES OF SALVAGE LOGGING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF POST-WILDFIRE FOREST SUCCESSION INVOLVES POLLINATION AND PLANT REPRODUCTION. FOR SNOWBERRY (SYMPHORICARPOS ALBUS), AN ECOLOGICALLY-IMPORTANT AND FIRE-TOLERANT SHRUB, WE TESTED THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING ON PLANT REPRODUCTION AND POLLEN LIMITATION USING A SUPPLEMENTAL-POLLEN EXPERIMENT COUPLED WITH POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS OF S. ALBUS AND OF POTENTIAL CO-FLOWERING COMPETITORS OF S. ALBUS. NEARLY A QUARTER CENTURY AFTER THESE DISTURBANCES, WE FOUND NO EFFECTS OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING ON THE REPRODUCTION OF NATURALLY-POLLINATED PLANTS. THE REPRODUCTION OF SOME S. ALBUS INDIVIDUALS WERE POLLEN LIMITED, BUT ONLY IN UNLOGGED AREAS, SUGGESTING THAT PLANTS IN UNLOGGED AREAS HAVE HIGHER POTENTIAL REPRODUCTION COMPARED TO THOSE LOGGED AREAS BUT ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF REPRODUCTION DUE TO LACK OF POLLINATION. THIS POLLEN LIMITATION OF S. ALBUS REPRODUCTION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RELATIVELY HIGH FLORAL DENSITIES OF POTENTIAL COMPETITORS OF S. ALBUS AND GENERALLY LOW POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES IN UNLOGGED AREAS. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LEGACIES OF POST-WILDFIRE LOGGING MAY RESTRICT THE REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL OF THIS SHRUB FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL DECADES AFTER THE LOGGING IS COMPLETE, BUT THIS RESTRICTION IS LIKELY DUE TO ALTERED ABIOTIC CONDITIONS AND NOT VIA LACK OF POLLINATION.",BUMBLE BEE POLLINATORS; FLORAL RESOURCES; FOREST DISTURBANCES; PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; POLLINATOR CONSERVATION; TIMBER HARVEST,FRAGMENTED POPULATIONS; POLLEN LIMITATION; BOREAL FOREST; COMMUNITIES; DIVERSITY; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; CONSEQUENCES; DISTURBANCE; IMPACTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"BURKLE, LA (REPRINT AUTHOR), MONTANA STATE UNIV, DEPT ECOL, BOZEMAN, MT 59717 USA.;HEIL, LAURA J., BURKLE, LAURA A., MONTANA STATE UNIV, DEPT ECOL, BOZEMAN, MT 59717 USA.",10.1016/J.FORECO.2018.09.013,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",NA,NSF GRFPNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR (OD) [DEB-2013168225],"WE THANK E.

J. BIOL. MACROMOL.,"TO GAIN A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF POLLEN FORAGING PREFERENCE, WE CHARACTERIZED THE PROTEOMES OF ANTENNAE AND BRAINS OF BEES FORAGING ON PEAR AND RAPESEED FLOWERS, AND THE VOLATILE COMPOUNDS FROM NECTAR, ANTHER, AND INFLORESCENCE OF BOTH PLANTS. BEES FORAGING ON THE POLLEN OF THE TWO PLANTS HAVE SHAPED THE DISTINCT PROTEOME ARSENALS IN THE ANTENNA AND BRAIN TO DRIVE OLFACTORY AND BRAIN FUNCTION. IN ANTENNAE, BEES FORAGING ON PEAR (PA) POLLEN PATHWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH PROTEIN METABOLISM WERE INDUCED TO SYNTHESIZE NEW PROTEINS FOR MODULATION OF SYNAPTIC STRUCTURES VIA STABILIZING AND CONSOLIDATING SPECIFIC MEMORY TRACES. WHEREAS, BEES FORAGING ON RAPESEED (BA) POLLEN PATHWAYS IMPLICATED IN ENERGY METABOLISM WERE ACTIVATED TO PROVIDE METABOLIC FUELS CRITICAL FOR NEURAL ACTIVITY. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE DISTINCT BIOCHEMICAL ROUTE IS FUNCTIONALLY ENHANCED TO CONSOLIDATE THE DIVERGENT OLFACTION IN PA AND BA. IN BRAIN, ALTHOUGH THE UNIQUELY INDUCED PATHWAYS IN BEES FORGING ON BOTH PLANTS ARE LIKELY TO CEMENT SELECTIVE ROLES IN LEARNING AND MEMORY, POLLEN FORAGING PREFERENCE IN BEES IS MAINLY DRIVED BY OLFACTION. FURTHERMORE, BOTH PLANTS HAVE SHAPED DIFFERENT REPERTOIRES OF SIGNAL ODORS AND FOOD REWARDS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS. THE SUGGESTED MARKERS ARE POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR SELECTION OF BEES TO IMPROVE THEIR OLFACTION FOR BETTER POLLINATION OF THE PLANTS.

ENTOMOL.,"THE BEE TRIBE EUCERINI IS A LARGE MONOPHYLETIC TAXON OCCURRING IN ALL CONTINENTS, EXCEPT OCEANIA AND ANTARCTICA, BUT FAR MORE DIVERSE IN THE AMERICAS AND, ESPECIALLY, IN THE NEOTROPICS. THE PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN ITS SUBTRIBE EUCERINA, WHICH CONTAINS THE BULK OF EUCERINI DIVERSITY, IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD, THIS BEING ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ITS NEOTROPICAL REPRESENTATIVES, WHICH HAVE BEEN POORLY REPRESENTED IN ALL PHYLOGENETIC STUDIES, INCLUDING EUCERINI, TO DATE. THIS LEADS TO A GENERALIZED LACK OF CONFIDENCE ON THE MONOPHYLY OF THE GROUPS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED AS GENERA AND SUBGENERA. HERE, A PHYLOGENETIC STUDY BASED ON THREE MOLECULAR MARKERS (COI, 18S, AND 28S, TOTALLING ABOUT 1700 BP) AND 58 MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS IS PRESENTED AS A CONTRIBUTION TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE SO-CALLED THYGATER-TRICHOCERAPIS GROUP, AND ESPECIALLY OF THE GENUS THYGATER HOLMBERG, WHICH HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN EXTENSIVELY SAMPLED.

BESIDES FLORAL POLLEN AND NECTAR, THEY COLLECT SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF PLANT RESINS, WHICH ARE USED FOR NEST CONSTRUCTION/MAINTENANCE AND DEFENCE AGAINST ANTAGONISTS. MOREOVER, SOME STINGLESS BEES EXTRACT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FROM RESINS AND INCORPORATE THEM IN THEIR CUTICULAR CHEMICAL PROFILES, RENDERING THIS TRAIT DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON THE PLANT COMMUNITY OF THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED HOW VARIATION IN THE COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY OF AVAILABLE RESIN SOURCES AFFECT RESIN STORAGES INSIDE HIVES, SUBSEQUENT EFFECTS ON THE BEES' CUTICULAR CHEMISTRY HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE INVESTIGATEDTHE NUMBER, PROPORTION AND COMPOSITION OF COMPOUNDS IN THE CUTICULAR CHEMICAL PROFILE OF AN AUSTRALIAN STINGLESS BEE USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY AND MASS SPECTROMETRY. WE ANALYSED WHETHER AND (IF SO) HOW THE CUTICULAR CHEMISTRY WAS AFFECTED BY HABITAT (I.E., PLANTATIONS, FORESTS, AND GARDENS) AND TREE SPECIES RICHNESS. WE FOUND THAT OVERALL NUMBERS AND PROPORTIONS OF SELF-PRODUCED AND RESIN-DERIVED COMPOUNDS IN THE CUTICULAR CHEMICAL PROFILES OF TETRAGONULA CARBONARIA WERE SIMILAR ACROSS HABITATS, WHILE THE COMPOSITION OF ALL COMPOUNDS (I.E., BOTH SELF-PRODUCED AND RESIN-DERIVED) AND OF RESIN-DERIVED COMPOUNDS DIFFERED BETWEEN HABITATS. THIS INDICATES THAT THE SURROUNDING TREE SPECIES COMMUNITY AND THUS AVAILABLE RESIN CHEMISTRY AFFECTED THE COMPOSITION OF PARTICULARLY RESIN-DERIVED COMPOUNDS ON THE BEES' CUTICLE. AS THE NUMBER AND COMPOSITION OF RESIN-DERIVED CUTICULAR COMPOUNDS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY TREE SPECIES RICHNESS, STINGLESS BEES APPEAR TO SELECTIVELY INCORPORATE SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT IN THEIR CUTICULAR CHEMICAL PROFILES, WHICH MAYINCREASE THEIR DEFENSIVE PROPERTIES.",CHEMICAL DIVERSITY; RESIN; HABITAT; TREE RICHNESS; POLLINATORS; STINGLESS BEES,TETRAGONULA-CARBONARIA; HONEY-BEES; RESIN; HYMENOPTERA; TERPENOIDS; MACADAMIA; DISPERSAL; PROPOLIS; BEHAVIOR; APIDAE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"LEONHARDT, SD (REPRINT AUTHOR), WURZBURG UNIV, DEPT ZOOL 3, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;KAMPER, WIEBKE, WALLACE, HELEN, UNIV SUNSHINE COAST, FAC SCI HLTH \& EDUC, GENECOL RES CTR, MAROOCHYDORE, DC 4558, AUSTRALIA.;SCHMITT, THOMAS, LEONHARDT, SARA D., WURZBURG UNIV, DEPT ZOOL 3, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;KALUZA, BENJAMIN F., FRAUNHOFER INST TECHNOL TREND ANAL, DEPT TECHNOL ANAL \& STRATEG PLANNING, APPELSGARTEN 2, D-53879 EUSKIRCHEN, GERMANY.",10.1007/S00049-019-00282-4,"PICASSOPLATZ 4, BASEL, 4052, SWITZERLAND",NA,GERMAN ACADEMIC EXCHANGE AGENCY (DAAD)DEUTSCHER AKADEMISCHER AUSTAUSCH DIENST (DAAD); DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT (DFG)GERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [LE 2750/1-1],"WE THANK TIM HEARD FOR PROVIDING THE TETRAGONULA CARBONARIA COLONIES AND SAHARA FARMS, MACADAMIA FARM MANAGEMENT PTY LTD AND MAROOCHY BUSHLAND BOTANIC GARDENS, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS PRIVATE LAND AND GARDEN OWNERS FOR HOSTING OUR COLONIES.

ECON. ENTOMOL.,"ROCKMELON (CUCUMIS MELO LINNAEUS (CUCURBITALES: CUCURBITACEAE)) IS A NOVEL COMMERCIALIZED FRUIT IN MALAYSIA AND HAS GREAT POTENTIAL TO BECOME AN IMPORTANT HORTICULTURAL CROP FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATION BY THE INDO-MALAYA STINGLESS BEE HETEROTRIGONA ITAMA SMITH (HYMENOPTERA: APIDAE) ON MEASURES OF YIELD AND QUALITY OF ROCKMELON CULTIVATED IN THE GREENHOUSE, COMPARED WITH HAND CROSS-POLLINATION AND SELF-POLLINATION. RESULTS SHOWED THAT ROCKMELON PRODUCED FROM PLANTS POLLINATED BY STINGLESS BEES AND HAND CROSS-POLLINATION HAD HIGHER FRUIT SET, WERE HEAVIER AND LARGER, AND CONTAINED HIGHER NUMBERS OF SEED PER FRUIT COMPARED WITH THOSE PRODUCED BY SELF-POLLINATION. POLLINATION BY STINGLESS BEES PRODUCED FRUIT WITH GREATER SWEETNESS THAN EITHER HAND CROSS-POLLINATION OR SELF-POLLINATION. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT STINGLESS BEE POLLINATION PRODUCED ROCKMELON FRUIT OF SIMILAR QUALITY, BUT BETTER YIELDS COMPARED TO THE OTHER POLLINATION TREATMENTS. WE SHOWED THAT STINGLESS BEES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE, EFFECTIVE POLLINATOR FOR THE IMPROVED PRODUCTION OF HIGH QUALITY ROCKMELON IN COMMERCIAL GREENHOUSE CULTIVATION.",STINGLESS BEE; HETEROTRIGONA ITAMA; POLLINATION; ROCKMELON; GREENHOUSE,SCAPTOTRIGONA AFF.

IT HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED TO A VARIETY OF PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS. CROW SEARCH ALGORITHM (CSA) IS A RECENTLY PROPOSED METAHEURISTIC ALGORITHM, WHICH MIMICS THE INTELLECTUAL CONDUCT OF CROWS. IN THIS PAPER, A HYBRID GWO WITH CSA, NAMELY GWOCSA IS PROPOSED, WHICH COMBINES THE STRENGTHS OF BOTH THE ALGORITHMS EFFECTIVELY WITH THE AIM TO GENERATE PROMISING CANDIDATE SOLUTIONS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE GLOBAL OPTIMA EFFICIENTLY. IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THE COMPETENCE OF THE PROPOSED HYBRID GWOCSA, A WIDELY UTILIZED SET OF 23 BENCHMARK TEST FUNCTIONS HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF DIMENSIONS AND VARIED COMPLEXITIES IS USED IN THIS PAPER. THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM ARE COMPARED TO 10 OTHER ALGORITHMS IN THIS PAPER FOR VERIFICATION. THE STATISTICAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE GWOCSA OUTPERFORMS OTHER ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING THE RECENT VARIANTS OF GWO CALLED, ENHANCED GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER (EGWO) AND AUGMENTED GREY WOLF OPTIMIZER (AGWO) IN TERMS OF HIGH LOCAL OPTIMA AVOIDANCE ABILITY AND FAST CONVERGENCE SPEED. FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO DEMONSTRATE THE APPLICABILITY OF THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM AT SOLVING COMPLEX REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS, THE GWOCSA IS ALSO EMPLOYED TO SOLVE THE FEATURE SELECTION PROBLEM AS WELL. THE GWOCSA AS A FEATURE SELECTION APPROACH IS TESTED ON 21 WIDELY EMPLOYED DATA SETS ACQUIRED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT IRVINE REPOSITORY. THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO THE STATEOF-THE-ART FEATURE SELECTION TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING THE NATIVE GWO, THE EGWO, AND THE AGWO.
