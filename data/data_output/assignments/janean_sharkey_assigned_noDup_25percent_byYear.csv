BOT.,"IN CLEISTES DIVARICATA, A HINGED ANTHER DISPENSES A SEQUENCE OF LOOSELY AGGREGATED POLLEN TETRAD MASSES ONTO THE DORSAL THORAX OF BOMBUS AND MEGACHILE WORKERS. THIS MECHANISM ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE BEE TO RECEIVE POLLEN FROM A SINGLE FLOWER. TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS STRATEGY, PLANTS IN BUD WERE CAGED AND HAND POLLINATED USING POLLEN FROM SEQUENTIAL RELEASES. CAPSULES PRODUCED FROM A FLOWER'S FIRST THREE POLLEN DUMPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER AND HEAVIER AND CONTAINED MORE SEEDS THAN THOSE PRODUCED BY LATER POLLEN DEPOSITS WITH FEWER TETRADS. DECREASING POLLEN DOSAGE DID NOT AFFECT FRUIT SET, CAPSULE DEVELOPMENT, INDIVIDUAL SEED WEIGHT, OR PERCENTAGE OF HEALTHY LOOKING EMBRYOS PER FRUIT. FRUIT SET FOR ARTIFICIAL POLLINATIONS WAS 93\% FOR POLLEN DUMPS 1-3 AND 97\% FOR DUMPS 4-18. AS SET OF NATURALLY POLLINATED MARKED PLANTS WAS ONLY 38\%, LOW FREQUENCY OF POLLINATOR VISITS APPARENTLY LIMITED SEED PRODUCTION. EFFICACY OF INFREQUENT VISITS IS MAXIMIZED, HOWEVER, BECAUSE A FLOWER'S FIRST POLLEN RELEASES CONTAIN THE MOST POLLEN, BUT LATER LOW-DOSAGE DUMPS CAN PRODUCE SOME SEEDS. AN UNEXPECTED COST WAS A HIGHER INVESTMENT OF PERICARP PER SEED IN LOW-DOSAGE CAPSULES (130 NG PERICARP SEED-1 FRESH WEIGHT) THAN IN HIGH-DOSAGE POLLINATIONS (ONLY 27 NG PERICARP SEED-1).

TOTAL BIRD DENSITY DID NOT DIFFER 2, 10, OR 21 D OR 1 YR AFTER APPLICATION. THOUGH CARBARYL IS AN ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) INHIBITING CHEMICAL, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF DEPRESSED BRAIN ACHE IN BIRDS OR SMALL MAMMALS COLLECTED FROM THE TREATED AREA. WE SAMPLED ARTHROPOD BIOMASS ON THE TREATED AND UNTREATED AREAS WITH PITFALL TRAPS AND STICKYBOARDS. GRASSHOPPER DENSITIES WERE ESTIMATED WITH RING COUNTS. BIOMASS OF COLEOPTERA DECLINED ON THE TREATED RELATIVE TO THE UNTREATED AREA 2 AND 10 D AND 1 YR AFTER TREATMENT. BIOMASS OF ANTS (FORMICIDAE) AND ARTHROPODS CONSUMED BY BIRDS DECLINED 2 D AFTER TREATMENT BUT RECOVERED DURING LATER SAMPLING PERIODS. GRASSHOPPER NUMBERS DECLINED ON THE TREATED AREA BETWEEN THE BEFORE AND AFTER 2-D COUNT AND REMAINED UNCHANGED DURING LATER COUNTS. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF A DECLINE IN HALICTID BEES, WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS OF SOME NATIVE PLANT SPECIES, BUT OUR INFERENCES REGARDING CHANGES IN ARTHROPOD NUMBERS ARE LIMITED BECAUSE WE DID NOT IDENTIFY INSECTS TO SPECIES. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT LOW RATE (1.68 KG/HA) CARBARYL BAIT APPLICATIONS HAVE MINIMAL POTENTIAL FOR DIRECT TOXIC EFFECTS ON BIRDS AND MAMMALS BUT MAY HAVE LIMITED INDIRECT EFFECTS ON SPECIES THAT DEPEND ON CERTAIN ARTHROPOD GROUPS FOR FOOD OR SEED DISPERSAL. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT BAIT APPLICATIONS ARE LESS HAZARDOUS TO WILDLIFE THAN LIQUID SPRAYS BECAUSE THERE IS LESS EXPOSURE TO NONTARGET ORGANISMS.

PLANT SCI.,"TWO PHASES OF FORAGING FLIGHTS OF HYMENOPTERAN POLLINATORS ARE DISCUSSED: LOCALIZATION OF FOOD SOURCES OVER FAR DISTANCES (HUNDREDS OF METERS TO SEVERAL KILOMETERS), AND SPOTTING OF FLOWERS WITHIN THEIR VISUAL CATCHMENT AREA. IN THE FIRST PART, EVIDENCE FROM NAVIGATIONAL TASKS WITH HONEYBEES IS PRESENTED WHICH FAVORS THE INTERPRETATION THAT BEES POSSESS A RICH AND UNIQUE SPATIAL MEMORY OF QUALIFIED AND LOCALIZED OBJECTS. DEPENDING ON THE MOTIVATION, THE BEE IS RATHER FREE TO NAVIGATE WITH REFERENCE TO THIS MEMORY. IN PARTICULAR, BEES ARE GUIDED TOWARDS FEEDING PLACES WITH SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR SIGNAL AND REWARD PROPERTIES. IN THE SECOND PART, THE PROCESSES GUIDING THE BEE DURING ITS FINAL APPROACH TO THE FLOWER ARE ANALYZED. WHEN ARRIVING IN THE CLOSE VICINITY OF A REWARDING FLOWER, BEES FIRST DETECT AND RECOGNIZE THE ACHROMATIC GREEN SIGNAL AND THEN THE CHROMATIC COLOR SIGNAL. THE DEPENDENCE ON THE OPTICAL SIGNALS OF THE FLOWERS AND THE HABITAT FEATURES IS STUDIED IN A COMPARISON BETWEEN PLANTS GROWING IN THE ISRAELI MEDITERRANEAN AND DESERT HABITATS. WE FIND THAT THE GREEN CONTRASTS OF FLOWERS IN DESERT PLANTS ARE LESS PROMINENT THAN IN MEDITERRANEAN PLANTS BECAUSE THE GREEN SIGNAL OF THE DESERT BACKGROUND IS MORE SIMILAR TO THAT OF FLOWERS, NOT BECAUSE THE GREEN SIGNALS OF DESERT AND MEDITERRANEAN PLANTS ARE DIFFERENT. THESE RESULTS ARE INTERPRETED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE GREEN SIGNAL OF FLOWERS USED IN FURTHER DISTANCE DETECTION IS AN ADAPTIVE PROPERTY OF PLANT SPECIES ONLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL FEATURES SUPPORTING NAVIGATION BF INSECTS. THE LOW DENSITY GROWTH OF DESERT PLANTS MAY ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE PLANTS ARE LOCATED BY INSECT POLLINATORS AS SPECIFIED PLACES RELATIVE TO LANDMARKS. THEREFORE, FURTHER DISTANCE VISUAL SIGNALS EMANATING FROM THE FLOWER MAY BE LESS IMPORTANT IN A DESERT HABITAT, AND REDUCED GREEN CONTRAST DOES NOT BECOME AN UNFAVORABLE PROPERTY IN DESERT PLANTS. WE CONCLUDE THAT BOTH HABITAT FEATURES AND FLOWER SIGNALS CONTRIBUTE TO THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM OF INSECT POLLINATORS, AND THAT THE EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT OF FLOWER SIGNALS NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE PLANT SPECIES' HABITAT.",NA,NAVIGATION EN-ROUTE; COGNITIVE MAPS; HONEY-BEES; DISTANCE ESTIMATION; COLOR-VISION; ORIENTATION; LANDMARKS; MEMORY; DRONE; HYMENOPTERA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,32,"MENZEL, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST NEUROBIOL,KONIGIN LUISE STR 28-30,D-14195 BERLIN,GERMANY.",10.1080/07929978.1997.10676680,"PO BOX 50257, JERUSALEM 91502, ISRAEL",NA,NA,NA,0792-9978,23,141-156,LASER PAGES PUBL LTD,45,1997,ISIA1997YE40400007,72,PLANT SCIENCES,24,PLANT SCIENCES,NA,YE404,"MENZEL, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BERLIN,INST NEUROBIOL,KONIGIN LUISE STR 28-30,D-14195 BERLIN,GERMANY",ISI,none,NA,FREE UNIV BERLIN,NA,"MENZEL R, 1997, ISR J PLANT SCI","MENZEL R, 1997, ISR J PLANT SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA

WE SAMPLED 14 POPULATIONS FROM PUERTO RICO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, AND CUBA FOR ISOZYME VARIATION USING HORIZONTAL STARCH-GEL ELECTROPHORESIS, WE RESOLVED AND SCORED VARIATION FOR TWELVE LOCI FROM SIX ENZYMES, AND FOUND THAT ALL LOCI WERE POLYMORPHIC AT THE SPECIES LEVEL AND ALLELE FREQUENCIES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG ALL POPULATIONS. VARIATION AT THE POPULATION LEVEL WAS ALSO HIGH, AS THE AVERAGE PERCENT POLYMORPHIC LOCI WAS 71\%, THE EXPECTED MEAN HETEROZYGOSITY (H-E) WAS 0.21, AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF EFFECTIVE ALLELES PER LOCUS WAS 1.43.

PLANT SCI.,"AN INCREASE IN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE MAY ENHANCE FITNESS BY INCREASING A PLANT'S ATTRACTIVENESS TO POLLINATORS. ALTERNATIVELY, A LARGER DISPLAY MAY REDUCE FITNESS BY INCREASING POLLEN MOVEMENT WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL. IN DICHOGAMOUS SPECIES THE FREQUENCY OF THIS GEITONOGAMY ALSO DEPENDS ON FLORAL GENDER RATIO AND POLLINATOR RESPONSE TO FLORAL GENDER AND TO INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE. WE EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIPS OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AND DICHOGAMY TO POTENTIAL GEITONOGAMY IN CAMPANULA AMERICANA, A PROTANDROUS HERB. WE OBSERVED POLLINATORS IN A NATURAL POPULATION, IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS DIFFERED IN DISPLAY SIZE, GENDER RATIO, AND DISTANCE TO CONSPECIFICS, AND IN EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS, IN WHICH INDIVIDUALS DIFFERED ONLY IN DISPLAY SIZE. IN BOTH SETTINGS, BEES RESPONDED TO INCREASED FLORAL DISPLAYS BY INCREASING THE NUMBER AND LENGTH OF FORAGING BOUTS. THE NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY GEITONOGAMOUS VISITS, THOSE TO FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS AFTER MALE-PHASE FLOWERS, ALSO INCREASED WITH DISPLAY SIZE. IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH PROPORTION OF FLOWERS VISITED DID NOT INCREASE WITH THE FLORAL DISPLAY, THE PROPORTION OF GEITONOGAMOUS VISITS DID. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT DICHOGAMY REDUCED THE POTENTIAL FOR GEITONOGAMY. THE RATIO OF MALE-TO FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS DID NOT AFFECT BEE BEHAVIOR, AND BEES DID NOT DISPLAY A GENDER PREFERENCE. IN CONTRAST TO OTHER STUDIES, THE PRESENTATION OF FEMALE-PHASE FLOWERS BELOW MALE-PHASE FLOWERS ON REPRODUCTIVE BRANCHES DID NOT REDUCE GEITONOGAMY. VARIATION IN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE MAY CAUSE THE MATING SYSTEM TO VARY AMONG POPULATIONS. WE FOUND THAT DISPLAY SIZE VARIED AMONG 12 POPULATIONS AND THAT GEITONOGAMY MAY BE INFREQUENT IN MANY POPULATIONS AS A RESULT OF SMALL DISPLAY SIZES.

THE FLOWERS EITHER HAVE A SALVERFORM SHAPE OR ARE BILABIATE WITH THREE PETALS FORMING THE UPPER LIP, TRANSITIONS BETWEEN THESE FLOWER TYPES CAN ALSO BE OBSERVED.

( 2) IN THE FEMALE PHASE, THE ANTHERS ARE SPREADING AND THE MOUTH OF THE STYLAR CHANNEL OPENS PRESUMABLY BY DISINTEGRATION OF CLOSING HAIRS. A MUCILAGINOUS SECRETION COMING OUT OF THE MOUTH MAY RECEIVE THE POLLEN FROM POLLINATORS. ( 3) POLLINATORS OF THE SALVERFORM FLOWERS ARE PRESUMABLY BUTTERFLIES, WHEREAS POLLINATORS OF BILABIATE FLOWERS ARE BEES. ( 4) POLLEN IS PRESUMABLY APPLIED AT THE PROBOSCIS OF THE BUTTERFLIES THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE POLLEN MASS BETWEEN THE ANTHERS. IF POLLINATORS ARE BEES, POLLEN MAY BE LOADED ON THE VENTRAL SIDE OF THE INSECT ( STERNOTRIBIC POLLEN LOADING).

HEMIPTERANS HAVE A DIGESTIVE MUTUALISM WITH RORIDULA AND HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN POLLINATION BUT FLOWERS SHOW ADAPTATIONS TO HYMENOPTERAN POLLINATION. WE DEDUCE THAT HEMIPTERANS ARE THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS OF RORIDULA BECAUSE SEED SET IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHEN HEMIPTERANS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE FLOWERS. USING ALLOZYME ELECTROPHORESIS, WE SHOW THAT HEMIPTERANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOSTLY SELFED PROGENY.

PLANTS RESIST DAMAGE TO LEAVES IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, AND WE NOW HAVE A RICH LITERATURE DOCUMENTING HOW PLANTS DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST HERBIVORE ATTACK. IN CONTRAST, THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH PLANTS RESIST ENEMIES THAT CONSUME FLORAL PARTS OR RESOURCES ARE MUCH LESS KNOWN, EVEN THOUGH DAMAGE TO FLORAL TISSUE USUALLY HAS TIGHTER LINKS TO PLANT FITNESS THAN DAMAGE TO LEAF TISSUE. MANY PLANTS EXPERIENCE NECTAR ROBBING, WHEREBY FLORAL VISITORS REMOVE NECTAR FROM FLOWERS, OFTEN WITHOUT POLLINATING. NECTAR ROBBERS CAN REDUCE PLANT FITNESS TO DEGREES COMPARABLE TO, OR EVEN SURPASSING, REDUCTION BY HERBIVORES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE NECTAR ATTRACTS BOTH POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS, PLANTS FACE A DILEMMA IN DEFENDING AGAINST NECTAR ROBBERS WITHOUT ALSO DETERRING POLLINATORS. HERE, WE EXTEND THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF RESISTANCE TO HERBIVORES TO INCLUDE RESISTANCE TO NECTAR ROBBERS, FOCUSING ON NECTAR TRAITS. WE REVIEW PUBLISHED DATA AND FIND THAT AN ARRAY OF NECTAR TRAITS MAY DETER ROBBERS WITHOUT DETERRING POLLINATORS. ALTHOUGH RESISTANCE TRAITS AGAINST ROBBERS HAVE BEEN BROADLY IDENTIFIED, THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THESE TRAITS IN TERMS OF PLANT FITNESS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD.

AGGREGATA INFLORESCENCES TO MIMIC BROWSING, OBSERVING SUBSEQUENT VISITS BY POLLINATORS AND NECTAR-ROBBERS, AND ADDING POLLEN BY HAND TO FLOWERS OF SOME CLIPPED AND UNCLIPPED PLANTS. CLIPPING REDUCED FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AND INCREASED INFLORESCENCE BRANCHING, BUT NEITHER HUMMINGBIRDS, THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS, NOR NECTAR-ROBBING BUMBLEBEES SHOWED ANY PREFERENCE FOR UNCLIPPED VERSUS CLIPPED PLANTS. CLIPPING DELAYED FLOWERING, THIS SHIFT IN PHENOLOGY CAUSED CLIPPED PLANTS TO MISS THE PEAK OF HUMMINGBIRD ACTIVITY AND TO HAVE LOWER PER-FLOWER VISITATION RATES THAN UNCLIPPED CONTROLS IN ONE YEAR, BUT TO HAVE GREATER OVERLAP WITH BIRDS AND HIGHER VISITATION RATES IN THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR. IN THREE SITES AND 2 YEARS, CLIPPED PLANTS EXPOSED TO NATURAL POLLINATION SUFFERED EXTREME UNDERCOMPENSATION, PRODUCING ON AVERAGE ONLY 16\% AS MANY SEEDS AS UNCLIPPED CONTROLS. THIS WAS NOT DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CLIPPING EFFECTS ON POLLINATION, HOWEVER, BECAUSE CLIPPED PLANTS WERE UNABLE TO INCREASE FECUNDITY WHEN PROVIDED WITH SUPPLEMENTAL POLLEN BY HAND.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS POLLINATION IS A CRITICAL STAGE IN PLANT REPRODUCTION AND THUS IN THE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION OF SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE CAATINGA IS THE FOURTH LARGEST ECOSYSTEM IN BRAZIL, BUT DESPITE ITS GREAT EXTENT AND ITS IMPORTANCE FEW STUDIES PROVIDING ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE, WITH A NOTABLE LACK OF WORK FOCUSING ON POLLINATION BIOLOGY. HERE, GENERAL DATA ARE PRESENTED REGARDING THE FREQUENCY OF POLLINATION SYSTEMS WITHIN CAATINGA COMMUNITIES, WITH THE AIM OF CHARACTERIZING PATTERNS RELATED TO FLORAL ATTRIBUTES IN ORDER TO MAKE POSSIBLE COMPARISONS WITH DATA FOR PLANT COMMUNITIES IN OTHER TROPICAL AREAS, AND TO TEST IDEAS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF SYNDROMES. THIS PAPER ALSO INTENDS TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE POINT FOR FURTHER STUDIES ON POLLINATION ECOLOGY IN THIS THREATENED ECOSYSTEM. METHODS THE FLORAL TRAITS AND THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS OF 147 SPECIES WERE ANALYSED IN THREE AREAS OF CAATINGA VEGETATION IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, AND COMPARED WITH WORLD-WIDE STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE SAME SUBJECT. FOR EACH SPECIES, FLORAL ATTRIBUTES WERE RECORDED AS FORM, SIZE, COLOUR, REWARDS AND POLLINATION UNITS. THE SPECIES WERE GROUPED INTO 12 GUILDS ACCORDING TO THE MAIN POLLINATOR VECTOR. ANALYSES OF THE FREQUENCIES OF THE FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS WERE UNDERTAKEN. KEY RESULTS NECTAR AND POLLEN WERE THE MOST COMMON FLORAL RESOURCES AND INSECT POLLINATION WAS THE MOST FREQUENT, OCCURRING IN 69.9\% OF THE STUDIED SPECIES. OF THE ENTOMOPHILOUS SPECIES, 61.7\% WERE CONSIDERED TO BE MELITTOPHILOUS (43.1\% OF THE TOTAL). VERTEBRATE POLLINATION OCCURRED IN 28.1\% OF THE SPECIES (ORNITHOPHILY IN 15.0\% AND CHIROPTEROPHILY IN 13.1\%), AND ANEMOPHILY WAS RECORDED IN ONLY 2.0\%. CONCLUSIONS THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN CAATINGA, DESPITE CLIMATIC RESTRICTIONS, ARE DIVERSIFIED, WITH A LOW PERCENTAGE OF GENERALIST FLOWERS, AND SIMILAR TO OTHER TROPICAL DRY AND WET FOREST COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH HIGH RAINFALL LEVELS.

MULTIPLE SHIFTS TO MORE SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS HAVE OCCURRED IN THE GENUS DURING ITS EVOLUTION. FOUR SPECIES WITH ELONGATE FLORAL TUBES AND A PINK TO RED BILABIATE PERIANTH ARE POLLINATED EITHER BY SUNBIRDS (NECTARINIA) ALONE OR BY SUNBIRDS AND THE SATYRID BUTTERFLY AEROPETES TULBAGHIA. ANOTHER RED-FLOWERED SPECIES WITH AN ACTINOMORPHIC FLOWER IS INFERRED TO BE POLLINATED ONLY BY AEROPETES, WHILE TWO SPECIES WITH PALE PINK FLOWERS WITH RED MARKINGS ARE POLLINATED BY LONG-PROBOSCID FLIES IN THE GENUS PROSOECA (NEMESTRINIDAE). TRITONIOPSIS PARVIFLORA IS UNIQUE IN THE AFRICAN IRIDACEAE IN PRODUCING FLORAL OILS AS A REWARD TO THE SHORT-TONGUED BEE REDIVIVA GIGAS (MELITTIDAE), AS WELL AS CONVENTIONAL SUGAR NECTAR. TRITONIOPSIS NERVOSA HAS WHITE, SWEETLY SCENTED, LONG-TUBED FLOWERS AND IS ASSUMED TO BE POLLINATED BY NIGHT-FLYING MOTHS. ALTHOUGH RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN TRITONIOPSIS ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD, IT IS CLEAR THAT AT LEAST FIVE SHIFTS IN POLLINATION STRATEGY HAVE OCCURRED IN THIS GENUS OF JUST 24 SPECIES.

EXP. AGRIC.,"IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT TRIPPING OF PEANUT FLOWERS BY LARGE BEES ENHANCES POLLINATION AND IMPROVES PEANUT YIELDS OF SOME EARLY COMMERCIAL PEANUT VARIETIES BUT THIS PHENOMENON HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR RECENTLY DEVELOPED PEANUT VARIETIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO ESTABLISH WHETHER BEES PROVIDE THIS SERVICE FOR PEANUT VARIETIES CURRENTLY GROWN ON THE ATHERTON TABLELAND, NORTH QUEENSLAND. TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF NATIVE AND INTRODUCED BEES OCCURRING WITHOUT ASSISTANCE IN CROPS, WE SET UP 3 CAGE TREATMENTS (MESHED TO EXCLUDE LARGE BEES, PARTLY MESHED TO ALLOW BEE ACCESS BUT TAKE CAGE EFFECTS INTO ACCOUNT, AND UNMESHED) IN EACH OF 7 PEANUT CROPS. WE ALSO TRAPPED BEES IN EACH CROP FOR THE ENTIRE FLOWERING PERIOD. IN A SEPARATE EXPERIMENT, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SUITABLE LARGE BEES WERE ABUNDANT NEARBY, WE SET UP 6 REPLICATES OF THE SAME 3 CAGE TREATMENTS IN ANOTHER PEANUT CROP WHERE 4 HONEYBEE COLONIES WERE LOCATED. ON A SUNNY DAY, DURING PEAK FLOWERING, WE MONITORED THE NUMBER OF HONEYBEE VISITS TO THE PEANUT FLOWERS IN THIS CROP BETWEEN 0820 AND 1730 HOURS. AT HARVEST, WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON PEANUT YIELD (NUMBER OF PEANUTS/G PLANT BIOMASS). THUS, BEES WERE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO PEANUT POLLINATION. THIS WAS REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT NO HONEYBEES (OR NATIVE BEES) WERE OBSERVED VISITING PEANUT FLOWERS IN THE CROP AUGMENTED WITH HONEYBEES, AND EVEN THOUGH WE CAUGHT 6 SPECIES OF SUITABLY SIZED BEES IN THE OTHER PEANUT CROPS, NO BEE SPECIES WAS COMMON. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT SELECTION FOR OTHER DESIRABLE PEANUT TRAITS HAS RESULTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF VARIETIES THAT ARE NO LONGER ATTRACTIVE TO FLOWER-TRIPPING BEES AND THAT THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED BY NORTH QUEENSLAND GROWERS PROMOTING BEES IN CROPS OF THESE VARIETIES.",APIDAE; ARACHIS HYPOGAEA L.; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; HALICTIDAE; MEGACHILIDAE,ARACHIS-HYPOGAEA L; APOIDEA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BLANCHE, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, GPO BOX 780, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;QUEENSLAND DEPT PRIMARY IND \& FISHERIES, KAIRI RES STN, QLD 4882, AUSTRALIA.;TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO SUSTAINABLE ECOSYST, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;CSIRO ENTOMOL, CANBERRA, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA.",10.1071/EA05190,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,NA,0816-1089,11,1529-1534,CSIRO PUBLISHING,46,2006,ISI000241057200016,21,AGRICULTURE,9,"AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",BUGLADYTPG.COM.AU,091VU,"BLANCHE, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, GPO BOX 780, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA",ISI,none,TROP FOREST RES CTR;KAIRI RES STN;TROP FOREST RES CTR,TROP FOREST RES CTR,NA,"BLANCHE KR, 2006, AUST J EXP AGRIC","BLANCHE KR, 2006, AUST J EXP AGRIC",NA,NA,NA,NA

NAT.,"ANGIOSPERMS DISPLAY FLOWERS IN MANY THREE-DIMENSIONAL ARRANGEMENTS, BUT THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS DIVERSITY IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE EXAMINED INFLUENCES OF INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE ON POLLINATION AND MATING BY QUANTIFYING THE RESPONSES OF BUMBLEBEES TO THREE ARCHITECTURES AND THEN USING THESE OBSERVATIONS AS THE BASIS OF A MODEL THAT SIMULATED POLLEN DISPERSAL. ON ARTIFICIAL PANICLES, RACEMES, AND UMBELS, EACH WITH 12 IDENTICAL FLOWERS, BEES VISITED ONE MORE FLOWER, ON AVERAGE, ON UMBELS THAN ON PANICLES (WITH RACEMES BEING INTERMEDIATE). IN CONTRAST TO THIS WEAK RESPONSE, THE CONSISTENCY OF FORAGING PATHS AMONG FLOWERS DIFFERED STRONGLY AMONG ARCHITECTURES (RACERNE > PANICLE > UMBEL). THE SIMULATION RACEME 1 PANICLE 1 UMBEL MODEL REVEALED LIMITED DIFFERENCES IN SELF-POLLINATION AND POLLEN EXPORT AMONG THE THREE INFLORESCENCE DESIGNS WHEN ALL FLOWERS PRESENTED AND RECEIVED POLLEN, BECAUSE MATING DIFFERENCES DEPENDED ON ONLY THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS VISITED. IN CONTRAST, IN SIMULATIONS OF INFLORESCENCES ON WHICH POLLEN RECEIPT AND PRESENTATION WERE SEGREGATED SO AS TO MINIMIZE INTERFERENCE AMONG FLOWERS, THE CONSISTENCY OF MOVEMENT PATHS GOVERNED MATING. IN THIS CASE, RACEMES SELF-POLLINATED MUCH LESS THAN UMBELS (WITH PANICLES BEING INTERMEDIATE), AND RACEMES EXPORTED MUCH MORE POLLEN THAN UMBELS AND PANICLES.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN NECTAR CHEMISTRY UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS HAS BEEN ONLY RARELY EXPLORED, YET IT IS AN ESSENTIAL ASPECT OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION MIGHT ACT ON NECTAR TRAITS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION IN FIELD AND GLASSHOUSE PLANTS OF THE BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PERENNIAL HERBS AQUILEGIA VULGARIS SUBSP. VULGARIS AND AQUILEGIA PYRENAICA SUBSP. CAZORLENSIS (RANUNCULACEAE). THE AIMS OF THE STUDY ARE TO ASSESS THE GENERALITY OF EXTREME INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION RECENTLY REPORTED FOR OTHER SPECIES IN THE FIELD, AND GAINING INSIGHT ON THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS INVOLVED. METHODS THE PROPORTIONS OF GLUCOSE, FRUCTOSE AND SUCROSE IN SINGLE-NECTARY NECTAR SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM FIELD AND GLASSHOUSE PLANTS WERE DETERMINED USING HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY. A HIERARCHICAL VARIANCE PARTITION WAS USED TO DISSECT TOTAL VARIANCE INTO COMPONENTS DUE TO VARIATION AMONG PLANTS, FLOWERS WITHIN PLANTS, AND NECTARIES WITHIN FLOWERS. KEY RESULTS NECTAR OF THE TWO SPECIES WAS MOSTLY SUCROSE-DOMINATED, BUT COMPOSITION VARIED WIDELY IN THE FIELD, RANGING FROM SUCROSE-ONLY TO FRUCTOSE-DOMINATED. MOST INTRA-SPECIFIC VARIANCE WAS DUE TO DIFFERENCES AMONG NECTARIES OF THE SAME FLOWER, AND FLOWERS OF THE SAME PLANT. THE HIGH INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN SUGAR COMPOSITION EXHIBITED BY FIELD PLANTS VANISHED IN THE GLASSHOUSE, WHERE NECTAR COMPOSITION EMERGED AS A REMARKABLY CONSTANT FEATURE ACROSS PLANTS, FLOWERS AND NECTARIES. CONCLUSIONS IN ADDITION TO CORROBORATING THE RESULTS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES DOCUMENTING EXTREME INTRA-PLANT VARIATION IN NECTAR SUGAR COMPOSITION IN THE FIELD, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT SUCH VARIATION MAY ULTIMATELY BE CAUSED BY BIOTIC FACTORS OPERATING ON THE NECTAR IN THE FIELD BUT NOT IN THE GLASSHOUSE.

THE LOSS OF POLLINATORS AND CONSEQUENTIAL POLLINATION LIMITATION IS ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR OBLIGATELY OUT-CROSSING PLANT SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF HIPPOCREPIS COMOSA WAS EXAMINED. HIPPOCREPIS COMOSA L IS A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, DECLINING PLANT SPECIES OCCURRING ON FRAGMENTED REMNANTS IN SEMI-NATURAL CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND HABITATS IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN SOUTHERN LOWER SAXONY, GERMANY. PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS WERE ANALYSED IN SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE PLANT PATCHES IN 15 DIFFERENTLY SIZED CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND FRAGMENTS SURROUNDED BY LANDSCAPE MATRICES OF DIFFERING COMPLEXITY.

FEMALE BEES ARE THOUGHT TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS THAN MALE BEES BECAUSE THEY CARRY MUCH MORE POLLEN THAN MALES. MALES OF SOME SOLITARY BEE SPECIES ARE KNOWN TO PATROL NEAR FLOWERS THAT FEMALES VISIT. BECAUSE PATROLLING MALES VISIT FLOWERS TO MATE OR DEFEND THEIR TERRITORIES, THEY MAY FUNCTION AS POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PATROLLING MALES TO POLLINATION HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED.

SUZUKI K;DOHZONO I;HIEI K,SUZUKI K,EVOLUTION OF POLLINATOR GENERALIZATION IN BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PLANTS,PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY,PLANT SPEC. BIOL.,"TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGIES AND THE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES OF PLANTS, THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF MULTIPLE POLLINATORS TO PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS NEED TO BE EXAMINED. TO OUTLINE RECENT ADVANCES ON THIS TOPIC, WE REVIEW STUDIES OF FIVE BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PLANTS IN JAPAN. THESE PLANT SPECIES ARE POLLINATED BY ONE TO THREE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES DIFFERING IN PROBOSCIS LENGTH: BOMBUS CONSOBRINUS, BOMBUS DIVERSUS AND BOMBUS HONSHUENSIS. THESE POLLINATION SYSTEMS ALLOW US TO COMPARE THE REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES OF PLANTS POLLINATED BY SINGLE AND MULTIPLE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES. FIRST, WE ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF MORPHOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PLANTS. IN PLANTS WITH NARROW TUBULAR FLOWERS, ISODON UMBROSUS AND CLEMATIS STANS, POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDED ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FLORAL TUBE LENGTH AND POLLINATOR MOUTHPARTS. THESE FLOWERS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIED DIRECTIONS AND INTENSITIES OF SELECTION BY MULTIPLE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES, RESULTING IN THE MAINTENANCE OF LARGE VARIATION IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY WITHIN AND BETWEEN POPULATIONS, AND EVEN WITHIN INDIVIDUALS. IN CONTRAST, POLLINATION EFFECTIVENESS IN PLANTS HAVING FLOWERS WITH A WIDE ENTRANCE, MELAMPYRUM ROSEUM AND HOSTA SIEBOLDIANA, DID NOT DIFFER AMONG BUMBLEBEE SPECIES BECAUSE OF GOOD CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AND BUMBLEBEE BODY SIZE, RESULTING IN SMALL MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATIONS AMONG FLOWERS. THUS, GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE POLLINATOR SPECIES FAVOR FLORAL TRAITS THAT ENABLE THE USE OF VARIOUS POLLINATORS. SECOND, WE ADDRESS THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF THE POLLINATION SERVICE IN BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED PLANTS. ISODON UMBROSUS, WITH ITS GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM, SUFFERED FROM POLLEN LIMITATION BECAUSE OF LOW POLLINATION QUALITY. IN CONTRAST, ISODON EFFUSUS, WHICH HAS A SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM, SUFFERED FROM POLLEN LIMITATION BECAUSE OF LOW POLLINATION QUANTITY. ISODON UMBROSUS PRODUCED LARGE NUMBERS OF SHORT TUBULAR FLOWERS TO IMPROVE POLLINATION QUANTITY, WHEREAS I. EFFUSUS PRODUCED SMALL NUMBERS OF LONG TUBULAR FLOWERS TO IMPROVE POLLINATION QUALITY, RESULTING IN A CLEAR TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS WITHIN PLANTS. IN M. ROSEUM, WHICH HAS A GENERALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEM, THREE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES ACHIEVED SUFFICIENT POLLINATION, BUT SEED PRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY AN INCREASED RATE OF SELF-POLLINATION. THIS IS BECAUSE THIS SPECIES INVESTS MORE RESOURCES IN CROSS-POLLINATED SEEDS BY SELECTIVE ABORTION OF SELFED SEEDS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE STRATEGY OF GENERALIZED PLANTS IS TO IMPROVE POLLINATION QUANTITY, WHEREAS THE STRATEGY OF SPECIALIZED PLANTS IS TO IMPROVE POLLINATION QUALITY.",BUMBLEBEE; FLORAL MORPHOLOGY; GENERALIZATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGY; SPECIALIZATION,CLEMATIS-STANS RANUNCULACEAE; CALYX TUBE LENGTH; SEED-SET; FLOWER VISITATION; POLLEN LIMITATION; TEMPORAL-CHANGE; FLORAL DISPLAY; PATTERNS; FRUIT; SPECIALIZATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,20,"DOHZONO, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL INST ENVIRONM STUDIES, 16-2 ONOGAWA, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058506, JAPAN.;UNIV TOKUSHIMA, FAC INTEGRATED ARTS \& SCI, DEPT MATH \& NAT SCI LIFE SCI, TOKUYAMA, YAMAGUCHI 7708502, JAPAN.;TOKYO METROPOLITAN UNIV, GRAD SCH SCI, MAKINO HERBARIUM, HACHIOJI, TOKYO 1920397, JAPAN.;UNIV TOKYO, DEPT GEN SYST STUDIES BIOL, MEGURO KU, TOKYO 1538902, JAPAN.",10.1111/J.1442-1984.2007.00187.X,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,0913-557X,3,141-159,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,22,2007,ISI000250763900001,68,"PLANT SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",39,"PLANT SCIENCES, ECOLOGY",IKUMI.DOHZONOGMAIL.COM,228WS,"DOHZONO, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL INST ENVIRONM STUDIES, 16-2 ONOGAWA, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 3058506, JAPAN",ISI,none,UNIV TOKUSHIMA;TOKYO METROPOLITAN UNIV;UNIV TOKYO,NATL INST ENVIRONM STUDIES,NA,"SUZUKI K, 2007, PLANT SPEC BIOL","SUZUKI K, 2007, PLANT SPEC BIOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

OVER 3 YR, WE STUDIED THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF PHOSMET SPRAYING ON BEE POPULATIONS: (1) FORAGING ON PLANTS WITHIN THE ORCHARD UNDERSTORY AND ADJACENT TO IT, AND (2) NESTING IN, AND AT SEVERAL DISTANCES FROM, THE ORCHARDS. WE RECORDED A RICH BEE FAUNA (47 TAXA) IN THE ORCHARDS AND ON PLANTS NEARBY.

CONTROL,"THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF BIOFUNGICIDES FOR THE CONTROL OF IMPORTANT PLANT PATHOGENS, SUCH AS THE GRAY MOLD BOTRYTIS CINEREA, REQUIRES INVESTIGATION DUE TO THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT FOR VERY LOW PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN FOODSTUFFS, AND CONCERNS OVER THE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CHEMICAL FUNGICIDES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF BUMBLEBEES AS POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS GENERATED THE NEED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AGAINST THESE INSECTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF TWO COMMERCIAL TRICHODERMA-BASED BIOFUNGICIDES AGAINST THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. THE TWO COMMERCIAL COMPOUNDS TESTED WERE BINAB-TF-WP AND BINAB-TF-WP-KONC, BOTH OF WHICH CONTAIN COMBINATIONS OF TRICHODERMA HARZIANUM ATCC20476 AND DICHODERMA POLYSPORUM ATCC20475. THE BUMBLEBEES WERE EXPOSED TO THE BIOCONTROL AGENTS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN THE FIELD (MFRC), AND THEN EXPOSED VIA THREE POTENTIAL ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: DERMAL CONTACT, ORALLY VIA THE DRINKING OF TREATED SUGAR WATER, AND VIA TREATED POLLEN. THE TREATMENTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH RECORDING WORKER MORTALITY (LETHAL EFFECTS) AND ANY EFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DRONES (SUBLETHAL EFFECTS). THE LABORATORY TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS DID NOT CAUSE WORKER MORTALITY OR ADVERSELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE TRICHODERMA-BASED PRODUCTS COULD SURVIVE OR GROW ON THE BODIES OF THE ADULT WORKERS. IN NO CASE WAS SURVIVAL OR GROWTH OF THE BIOFUNGICIDE OBSERVED ON THE WORKERS. WHEN THE EFFECTS OF THESE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED AGAINST BUMBLEBEE LARVAE (THIRD AND FOURTH INSTARS), NO ENTOMOPATHOGENIC EFFECTS WERE FOUND. OVERALL, THE RESULTS OBTAINED UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS INDICATE THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH B. TERRESTRIS. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER INC.

EXPERIENCED BEES WITH PRIOR ACCESS TO FLOWERS ACHIEVED HIGHER RATES OF NECTAR INTAKE THAN DID LATER ARRIVALS BECAUSE THEY TRAVELED FASTER BETWEEN FLOWERS AND RETURNED TO FLOWERS AT MORE REGULAR INTERVALS. THESE BEHAVIORAL SKILLS IMPROVED FORAGING PERFORMANCE IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS IN 2 WAYS: NECTAR THAT ACCUMULATED IN FLOWERS COULD BE HARVESTED BEFORE ITS REPLENISHMENT RATE SLOWED DOWN, AND NECTAR COULD BE TAKEN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A COMPETITOR. IN EACH FORAGING TRIP, HOWEVER, BEES TRAVELED MORE SLOWLY AS THEY FOLLOWED MORE REPEATABLE ROUTES.

TO DETERMINE HOW INVASIVE ALIEN PLANTS AFFECT INSECT DIVERSITY, WE COMPARED FLYING INSECTS CAPTURED USING MALAISE TRAPS AMONG DIFFERENT VEGETATION TYPES ON A SMALL ISLAND (NISHIJIMA, 0.49 KM(2)) IN THE OCEANIC OGASAWARA (BONIN) ISLANDS IN THE NORTH-WESTERN PACIFIC. THE NUMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS AND SPECIES, AND THE SPECIES COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS (BEES), PREDATORS (WASPS) AND WOOD BORERS (CERAMBYCID, MORDELLID AND ELATERID BEETLES) WERE COMPARED AMONG THREE VEGETATION TYPES: CASUARINA EQUISETIFOLIA (AN INVASIVE ALIEN TREE) FOREST, NATURAL FOREST AND NATURAL GRASSLAND (FOREST EDGE), DURING TWO SEASONS (JUNE AND OCTOBER-NOVEMBER 2005). IN TRAPS, 80.0, 66.7, 87.5, 85.7 AND 100.0\% OF BEE, WASP, CERAMBYCID, MORDELLID AND ELATERID BEETLE SPECIES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE ENDEMIC TO THE OGASAWARA ISLANDS.

WE EVALUATED WHETHER THIS DECREASE IN VISITATION ALSO REDUCES THE POLLINATION SERVICE IN THIS CROP. WE ANALYSED THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF POLLEN DEPOSITED ON STIGMAS, AND ASSOCIATED LIMITATION OF FRUIT PRODUCTION AT INCREASING DISTANCES ( EDGE: 10, 100, 500 AND 1000 M) FROM THE REMNANTS OF YUNGAS FOREST.

THIS WORK DIFFERS FROM PAST WORK IN THE SAME LANDSCAPE, WHICH DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF CHANGES IN SPECIES RICHNESS OR ABUNDANCE OF MELIPONINES AND FOREST-RELATED VARIABLES (DISTANCE TO FOREST OR FOREST FRAGMENT SIZE), BUT DID FIND SHIFTS TOWARD MELIPONINE-DOMINATED COMMUNITIES NEAR FORESTS, ESPECIALLY LARGER ONES. THE LARGER TRUE SAMPLE SIZE (I.E. NUMBER OF SAMPLE SITES) OF THE PRESENT WORK LIKELY IMPROVED THE STATISTICAL POWER TO DETECT THESE RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE MELIPONINES ARE FOREST DEPENDENT, I RECORDED SOME SPECIES IN THE SMALLEST FOREST FRAGMENTS IN THE LANDSCAPE, AND AS A GROUP THEY RESPOND STRONGLY TO OVERALL FOREST COVER IN THE LANDSCAPE (I.E. INCLUDING BOTH SMALL AND LARGE PATCHES OF FOREST) BOTH OF THESE OBSERVATIONS SUPPORT ARGUMENTS FOR PRESERVING EVEN SMALL FRAGMENTS OF FOREST IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. GIVEN THE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MELIPONINE BEES, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR LONG-TERM CONSERVATION NEEDS IN THE CHANGING TROPICAL LANDSCAPES OF THE WORLD.

THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE VISITING ACTIVITY TO ODOR BAITS AND CLIMATIC FACTORS WAS LOW. THIS RESULT CAN BE DUE TO BEE FLIGHT ACTIVITY OCCURRING WITHIN A RANGE OF ADEQUATE CLIMATIC VARIATION, PARTICULARLY TEMPERATURE, WHICH IN OUR STUDY RANGED FROM 23 TO 32 DEGREES C.

PHYLOGENETIC RELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THIS FAMILY ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND SOME GENERA CANNOT BE PLACED WITH CONFIDENCE AT THE SUBFAMILY LEVEL. WE ANALYSED MELITTID PHYLOGENY USING A COMBINED DATASET OF FIVE NUCLEAR GENES [28S, ELONGATION FACTOR-1 ALPHA (EF-1 ALPHA, F-2 COPY), LONG-WAVELENGTH RHODOPSIN, NA-K ATPASE AND RNA POLYMERASE II] SPANNING 4842 BP PLUS 68 ADULT MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERS. OUR STUDY INCLUDED 25\% OF THE SPECIES-LEVEL DIVERSITY AND 81\% OF THE GENERIC-LEVEL DIVERSITY AND INCLUDED ALL PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND SUBFAMILIES. WE ANALYSED THE DATASET USING PARSIMONY, MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND BAYESIAN METHODS. ALL METHODS YIELDED CONGRUENT RESULTS. ALL TOPOLOGIES RECOVERED THE THREE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SUBFAMILIES (DASYPODAINAE, MELITTINAE, MEGANOMIINAE), BUT TWO GENERA (AFRODASYPODA AND PROMELITTA) ARE TRANSFERRED FROM DASYPODAINAE TO MELITTINAE. ON THE BASIS OF OUR TREE TOPOLOGIES WE IDENTIFY FOUR TRIBES (DASYPODAINI COMB.N., HESPERAPINI STAT.N., MACROPIDINI COMB.N.

SHUTTLEWORTH A;JOHNSON SD,SHUTTLEWORTH A,THE IMPORTANCE OF SCENT AND NECTAR FILTERS IN A SPECIALIZED WASP-POLLINATION SYSTEM,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,FUNCT. ECOL.,"P>1. PLANTS WITH OPEN FLOWERS AND EXPOSED NECTAR SHOULD ATTRACT A WIDE DIVERSITY OF FLOWER VISITORS, YET, FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOT YET WELL UNDERSTOOD, SOME PLANTS WITH THESE `GENERALIST' FLORAL TRAITS HAVE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYSTEMS. 2. WE INVESTIGATED THIS PROBLEM IN THE AFRICAN MILKWEED PACHYCARPUS GRANDIFLORUS WHICH HAS OPEN FLOWERS THAT PRODUCE COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF EXPOSED AND CONCENTRATED NECTAR, YET IS VISITED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY SPIDER-HUNTING WASPS IN THE GENUS HEMIPEPSIS. 3. THESE WASPS WERE THE ONLY VISITORS FOUND TO CONSISTENTLY CARRY POLLINARIA AND A CAGE EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF SUCCESSFULLY POLLINATING THIS PLANT. FURTHERMORE, EXPERIMENTAL HAND-POLLINATIONS SHOWED THAT P. GRANDIFLORUS IS GENETICALLY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND THUS RELIANT ON POLLINATORS FOR SEED SET. 4. WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLES OF CHEMICAL (NECTAR AND FLORAL SCENT) AND SPECTRAL PROPERTIES IN THE SELECTIVE ATTRACTION OF WASPS AND THE FILTERING OUT OF OTHER POTENTIAL FLOWER VISITORS. NECTAR PALATABILITY EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE NECTAR IS UNPALATABLE TO HONEYBEES BUT PALATABLE TO THE WASPS. CHOICE EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED IN THE FIELD AND USING A Y-MAZE IN THE LABORATORY SHOWED THAT WASPS ARE ATTRACTED PRIMARILY BY SCENT RATHER THAN VISUAL CUES. ANALYSIS OF SCENT USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY SHOWED THAT THESE INFLORESCENCES PRODUCE 36 DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS, MOSTLY MONOTERPENES AND ALIPHATICS. ANALYSIS OF SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE SHOWED THAT FLOWERS HAVE SIMILAR COLOURING TO THE BACKGROUND VEGETATION. 5. WE CONCLUDE THAT P. GRANDIFLORUS IS SPECIALIZED FOR POLLINATION BY HEMIPEPSIS WASPS, AND IN THE ABSENCE OF MORPHOLOGICAL FILTERS, ACHIEVES SPECIALIZATION THROUGH UNPALATABLE NECTAR, CRYPTIC COLOURING AND SCENT AS A SELECTIVE POLLINATOR ATTRACTANT. 6.

SOC.,"THE BEE TRIBE CERATININI IS IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING EARLY STAGES IN SOCIAL EVOLUTION. THEIR EXTANT SISTER TRIBE ALLODAPINI CONTAINS NO STRICTLY SOLITARY SPECIES, AND WHILE SOME CERATININI ARE COMMONLY REGARDED AS SOLITARY, LITTLE BEHAVIOURAL DATA EXIST TO SUBSTANTIATE THIS. STUDIES ON ASIAN CONGENERS HAVE SHOWN RECURRENT SOCIALITY IN TEMPERATE AND SUBTROPICAL RANGES WHILE BEHAVIOURAL DATA ARE LACKING IN TROPICAL REGIONS. FIELD WORK ALONG THE WEST COAST OF BORNEO IN SARAWAK, MALAYSIA, HAS PROVIDED SOME INSIGHT INTO THESE TROPICAL TAXA. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE NESTING BIOLOGY AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR OF FOUR TAXONOMICALLY DESCRIBED YET BEHAVIOURALLY UNCLASSIFIED CERATINA SPECIES. THESE FOUR SPECIES ARE FROM THREE SUBGENCRA, NAMELY CERATINA (CERATINIDIA) ACCUSATOR COCKERELL, C (CERATINIDIA) NIGROLATERALIS COCKERELL, C. (NEOCERATINA) DENTIPES FRIESE, C (PITHITIS) SMARAGDULA FABRICIUS.

KLEIN AM,KLEIN AM,NEARBY RAINFOREST PROMOTES COFFEE POLLINATION BY INCREASING SPATIO-TEMPORAL STABILITY IN BEE SPECIES RICHNESS,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,FOR. ECOL. MANAGE.,"NATURAL TROPICAL FORESTS ARE HIGHLY DIVERSE AND ARE KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO FOREST-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS POLLINATION OF NEARBY CROPS. LANDSCAPE CHANGES CAUSE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL BEE COMMUNITY CHANGES, BUT CONSEQUENCES HOW THE COMMUNITY CHANGES AFFECT POLLINATION IS NOT WELL ANALYZED. THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE EFFECTS OF RAINFOREST DISTANCE AND ON SITE FLOWER RESOURCES IN AGRO-FORESTS ON SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION IN POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES AND THE CONSEQUENCES FOR COFFEE POLLINATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 24 AGRO-FORESTS DOMINATED BY COFFEE AND CACAO IN SULAWESI, INDONESIA DIFFERING IN THEIR DISTANCE TO RAINFOREST MARGIN OF THE LORE-LINDU NATIONAL PARK AND IN FLOWER DENSITY AND ITS TEMPORAL VARIATION. IN ALL AGRO-FORESTS, (1) TRANSECT SURVEYS OF THE UNDERSTORY WERE OBTAINED OVER A FIVE-MONTH PERIOD TO ASSESS BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITIONAL SIMILARITY, BEE DIVERSITY, AND THE TEMPORAL VARIATION IN BEE DIVERSITY, AND (2) COFFEE FLOWER VISITORS WERE OBSERVED AND OPEN AND BAGGED POLLINATION TREATMENTS CONDUCTED OVER ONE WEEK OF COFFEE BLOOMING TO ASSESS BEE DIVERSITY AND THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN BEE DIVERSITY AND COFFEE POLLINATION. MEAN NUMBER OF SHARED SPECIES OF THE UNDERSTORY RANGED BETWEEN 40 AND 60\% PER AGRO-FOREST AND WAS HIGHER IN AGRO-FORESTS NEARBY THE RAINFOREST THAN IN AGRO-FORESTS WITH A MINIMAL DISTANCE OF 500 M ISOLATED FROM THE RAINFOREST. MEAN SPECIES RICHNESS IN THE UNDERSTORY AND IN COFFEE FLOWERS DECREASED WITH RAINFOREST ISOLATION AND INCREASED WITH FLOWER RESOURCE AVAILABILITY. TEMPORAL VARIATION IN BEE SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE UNDERSTORY AND SPATIAL VARIATION OF THE COFFEE FLOWER-VISITING BEE SPECIES RICHNESS PER AGRO-FOREST INCREASED WITH FOREST DISTANCE. THE VARIATION IN BEE SPECIES RICHNESS DECREASED THE MEAN AND INCREASED THE SPATIAL VARIATION IN BEE-POLLINATED COFFEE FRUIT SET PER AGRO-FOREST. IN CONCLUSION, CROPS GROWN NEAR INTACT RAINFORESTS AND WHICH PROFIT FROM THE POLLINATION BY MANY SPECIES MAY FLUCTUATE LESS IN BEE-POLLINATED FRUIT SET ACROSS CROP PLANTS THAN CROP PLANTS IN ISOLATED AGRICULTURE THAT RECEIVE LOW OR EVEN SINGLE SPECIES POLLINATION SERVICES (C) 2009 ELSEVIER B.V.

CONSERV.,"ORGANIC FARMING HAS OFTEN BEEN FOUND TO PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR BIODIVERSITY, BUT THE BENEFITS CAN DEPEND ON THE SPECIES CONSIDERED AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE. IN AN INTENSIVELY FARMED AREA OF NORTHEAST ITALY WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER ISOLATED ORGANIC FARMS, IN A CONVENTIONALLY FARMED LANDSCAPE, PROVIDED LOCAL BENEFITS FOR INSECT POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION SERVICES. WE QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT (I.E. THE FARM SYSTEM), LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT (PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND) AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM. WE COMPARED SIX ORGANIC AND SIX CONVENTIONAL VINE FIELDS. THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH SITE AT RADII OF 200, 500, 1000 AND 2000 M. THE ORGANIC FIELDS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE CONVENTIONAL IN THEIR FLORAL RESOURCES OR PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, VISITATION RATES TO, AND POLLINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL POTTED PLANTS. NONE OF THESE FACTORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE FARMING SYSTEM. THE ABUNDANCE OF VISITS TO THE POTTED PLANTS IN THE CONVENTIONAL FIELDS TENDED TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. THE PROPORTION FRUIT SET, WEIGHT OF SEEDS PER PLANT AND SEED WEIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC FIELDS WERE ALL NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. IN VINE FIELDS THE IMPACT OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE WAS STRONGER THAN THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT. ENHANCEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY THROUGH ORGANIC FARMING SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE UBIQUITOUS, AS POTENTIAL BENEFITS MAY BE OFFSET BY THE CROP TYPE, ORGANIC-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIREMENTS IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE.

AN EXTREME CASE OF AN APPARENTLY HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION WITH THIGMONASTIC POLLEN PRESENTATION HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FOR THE MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX TILT-REVOLVER FLOWERS OF CAIOPHORA ARECHAVALETAE (LOASACEAE) POLLINATED BY OLIGOLECTIC BICOLLETES PAMPEANA (COLLETIDAE, HYMENOPTERA). WE STUDIED THE FLORAL BIOLOGY OF NASA MACROTHYRSA (LOASACEAE) IN THE FIELD AND IN THE GLASSHOUSE, WHICH HAS VERY SIMILAR FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, BUT IS POLLINATED BY POLYLECTIC NEOXYLOCOPA BEES (APIDAE, HYMENOPTERA). WE INVESTIGATED THE PRESENCE OF THIGMONASTIC ANTHER PRESENTATION, VISITOR BEHAVIOUR (POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS), CO-ORDINATION OF POLLINATOR VISITS WITH FLOWER BEHAVIOUR AND THE PRESENCE OF NECTAR REPLENISHMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER COMPLEX FLOWER MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYNDROME, OR WHETHER ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS CAN BE OFFERED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NASA MACROTHYRSA HAS THIGMONASTIC POLLEN PRESENTATION, I.E. NEW POLLEN IS RAPIDLY (<< 10 MIN) PRESENTED AFTER A POLLINATOR VISIT. NECTAR SECRETION IS INDEPENDENT OF REMOVAL AND AVERAGES 7-14 MU L H-1. THE COMPLEX FLOWERS, HOWEVER, FAIL TO EXCLUDE EITHER NATIVE (HUMMINGBIRDS) OR INTRODUCED (HONEYBEES) NECTAR ROBBERS, NOR DOES POLYLECTIC NEOXYLOCOPA ACTIVELY COLLECT THE POLLEN PRESENTED. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN COMPLEX FLOWER MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTIONALITY IN LOASACEAE AND A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED POLLINATION. RAPID POLLEN PRESENTATION IS BEST EXPLAINED BY THE POLLEN PRESENTATION THEORY: THE LARGE PROPORTION OF POLLINATORS COMING SHORTLY AFTER A PREVIOUS VISIT FIND LITTLE NECTAR AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT PLANT. THE RAPID PRESENTATION OF POLLEN ENSURES THAT ALL THESE VALUABLE `HUNGRY POLLINATORS' ARE DUSTED WITH SMALL POLLEN LOADS, THUS INCREASING THE MALE FITNESS OF THE PLANT BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SIRING OUTCROSSED OFFSPRING.

ARID. ENVIRON.,"IN AREAS UNDER DIFFERENT MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS (MANAGEMENT UNITS, MUS) LOCATED EITHER ON A SLOPE OR AT THE BASE OF A SLOPE AND EITHER IN A PLANTATION OR IN A PASTURE, WE COMPARED THE FLOWER AND FRUIT PRODUCTION, FLORAL VISITORS, VISITATION RATES AND PRE-EMERGENT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (PERS) OF SPONDIAS TUBEROSA (ANACARDIACEAE) IN AN AREA OF DRY FOREST IN NE BRAZIL. INDIVIDUALS IN THE PLANTATION MU PRODUCED MORE FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE THAN THOSE IN OTHER MUS, BUT THERE WERE NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES IN MEAN FRUIT SET AMONG MUS. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN MEAN VISITATION RATES WAS BETWEEN THE PLANTATION (65.83 +/- 38.49) AND THE SLOPE SITES (11.5 +/- 12.8). WE OBSERVED VISITS BY 19 INSECT SPECIES, INCLUDING BEES (31.6\%), BUTTERFLIES (31.6\%), WASPS (26.3\%) AND FLIES (10.5\%). A CLUSTERING ANALYSIS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF VISITS SHOWED THAT A) THE PLANTATION SITE IS MOST DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER MUS, B) THE PASTURE AND THE SITE AT THE BASE OF THE SLOPE ARE SIMILAR TO THE SLOPE SITE, AND C) THE HIGHER FREQUENCY OF VISITS OF POLLINATORS IN THE PLANTATION MU WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DIFFERENCES. OF THE 19 SPECIES OF INSECTS VISITING THE FLOWERS, 12 WERE CONSIDERED POLLINATORS. THE POLLINATOR SIMILARITY ANALYSIS INDICATED A CLEAR SEPARATION BETWEEN AREAS AND SUGGESTED THAT HUMAN ACTIVITY HAS RESULTED IN THE REPLACEMENT OF NATIVE POLLINATORS BY EXOTIC SPECIES. HOWEVER, THESE CHANGES APPARENTLY HAVE NOT AFFECTED THE PRE-EMERGENT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF S. TUBEROSA. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT PLANT REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY IN SEMI-ARID ECOSYSTEMS MAY BE MODIFIED BY HUMAN ACTION AND THAT CHANGES IN FLORAL PRODUCTION AND POLLINATOR GUILDS ARE THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EFFECTS. HOWEVER, THE TRADITIONAL MANAGEMENT PERFORMED BY LOCAL PEOPLE MAY NOT AFFECT THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF PLANT SPECIES. (C) 2010 ELSEVIER LTD.

SCI.,"STACHYTARPHETA JAMAICENSIS IS A SEASONAL SHRUB WHICH PRODUCES FLOWERS FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD DURING RAINY AND WINTER SEASONS. THE FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS BLUISH-VIOLET FLOWERS, NO PERCEPTIBLE SMELL, NARROW TUBULAR COROLLA AND CONCEALED NECTAR ACCUMULATED AT THE COROLLA BASE CONFORM TO `PSYCHOPHILOUS POLLINATION SYNDROME'. THE AGGREGATED ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS ON THE INFLORESCENCE IS ECONOMICAL AND ENERGETICALLY REWARDING FOR THE BUTTERFLIES. THE LOWER LIP OF THE COROLLA IS ELABORATE AND PROVIDES COMFORTABLE LANDING PLACE FOR THE BUTTERFLIES. THE NECTAR IS SUCROSE-RICH WITH 28\% SUGAR CONCENTRATION AND ALSO CARBOHYDRATE-RICH WITH LITTLE PROTEIN CONTENT. IT IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF FIVE OF THE TEN ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS REQUIRED BY BUTTERFLIES, THEY INCLUDE ISOLEUCINE, VALINE, LYSINE, METHIONINE AND THREONINE. FURTHER, IT ALSO CONTAINS THE NON-ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS SUCH AS ALANINE, BUTYRIC ACID, CYSTINE, GLUTAMIC ACID, GLYSINE, HYDROXYPROLINE, PROLINE, SERINE, ASPARTIC ACID AND CYSTEINE. WITH THESE FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, THE PLANT IS EXCLUSIVELY POLLINATED BY BUTTERFLIES. AMONG BUTTERFLIES, NYMPHALIDS AND PIERIDS ARE RELATIVELY MORE DIVERSE IN SPECIES AND CONSISTENT FORAGERS THAN PAPILIONIDS AND HESPERIIDS. THEREFORE, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN S. JAMAICENSIS AND THE BUTTERFLIES IS MUTUALISTIC, THE FORMER FOR POLLINATION AND THE LATTER FOR NOURISHMENT. THIS FLORAL SOURCE IS AVAILABLE FOR A LONG PERIOD AND HENCE IS AN IMPORTANT NECTAR SOURCE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF LOCAL BUTTERFLIES. ADDITIONALLY, BEES ALSO VISIT THE FLOWERS FOR FORAGE AND THEIR VISITS COULD CONTRIBUTE TO GENE FLOW AT POPULATION LEVEL TO SOME EXTENT. S. JAMAICENSIS PRODUCES FRUITS WITH MINUTE SEEDS WITHIN A SHORT SPAN OF TIME. SEED DISPERSAL OCCURS THROUGH SOIL AND WATER MOVEMENT.

URBAN PLAN.,"THE RED MASON BEE (OSMIA BICORNIS L) IS A COMMON WILD BEE IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO EARLY-SEASON POLLINATION. WE KNOW ONLY LITTLE ABOUT HOW ANY SPECIES OF WILD BEE IN CITIES RESPONDS TO RESOURCE DISTRIBUTION OR LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND THE URBAN HABITAT(S) THAT THEY PREFER. WE EMPLOYED A CITIZEN SCIENCE APPROACH TO INVESTIGATE DRIVERS BEHIND THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SOLITARY BEE IN THE URBAN REGION OF LEIPZIG (GERMANY). VOLUNTEERS HUNG TRAP NESTS AT DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND COLLECTED INFORMATION ON EIGHT LOCAL, MICROSITE CONDITIONS (SUCH AS SUN EXPOSURE, ATTACHMENT POSITION, LOCAL FLOWER AVAILABILITY). WE DERIVED 14 LANDSCAPE FACTORS FROM A DIGITAL GIS BIOTOPE DATA MAP (E.G. DISTANCE TO FLOWER SITES AND URBAN MATRIX PROPERTIES SUCH AS SIZE AND EDGE LENGTH OF PATCHES). BOTH OCCURRENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF O. BICORNIS WERE THEN ANALYZED USING A COMBINATION OF MACHINE LEARNING AND MULTIPLE (LOGISTIC) REGRESSION. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE RED MASON BEE IS UBIQUITOUS IN URBAN AREA BUT CLEARLY PROFITS FROM NEARBY FLORAL RESOURCES. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECTED A BALANCED INFLUENCE OF LANDSCAPE FACTORS AND MICROSITE CONDITIONS, WE FOUND THAT HANG LOCATION OF THE TRAP NEST WAS MOST IMPORTANT, FOLLOWED BY SUN EXPOSURE. CITIES WITH MANY FINE-SCALED FLORAL RESOURCES (SUCH AS PRIVATE GARDENS BUT NOT PARKS) AND AN OPEN HOUSING STRUCTURE WITH HIGHER SUN EXPOSURE BETWEEN BUILDINGS PROVIDE A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR CAVITY-NESTING BEES SUCH AS O. BICORNIS. IN PLACES WITHOUT SUITABLE NESTING OPPORTUNITIES, ARTIFICIAL NEST CAN SUPPORT THE BEES. 2011 ELSEVIER B.V.

EVOL.,"THE PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS OF THIS STUDY WAS THAT IN THE GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, FRUIT AND SEED SET VIA NOCTURNAL POLLINATION WOULD EXCEED THAT OF DIURNAL POLLINATION BECAUSE OF THE GREATER INSECT ACTIVITY AT NIGHT TYPICAL OF HOT, ARID REGIONS. CLERODENDRUM MOLLE, A WIDESPREAD MEMBER OF THE GALAPAGOS FLORA WAS SUBMITTED TO POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS, VISITOR OBSERVATIONS, NECTAR SAMPLING, POLLEN TRANSFER STUDIES, POLLEN OVULE RATIO STUDIES, AND POLLEN MEASUREMENTS. FLOWERS SET FRUIT AND SEED VIA OPEN POLLINATION, AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY, FACILITATED AUTOGAMY, FACILITATED CROSS-POLLINATION, DIURNAL POLLINATION, AND NOCTURNAL POLLINATION. RESULTS INDICATE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FRUIT SET. CROSS-POLLINATED FLOWERS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SEED SET OVER ALL TREATMENTS EXCEPT FACILITATED AUTOGAMY. NOCTURNAL AND DIURNAL FRUIT AND SEED SET DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. NOCTURNAL VISITORS INCLUDED ANTS, SPIDERS, HAWK MOTHS, AND ROACHES WHEREAS DIURNAL VISITORS INCLUDED CARPENTER BEES AND ANTS. GALAPAGOS MEMBERS OF C. MOLLE EXHIBIT INCOMPLETE PROTANDRY AND SET FRUIT VIA AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY AS A RESULT OF NATURAL SELECTION IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH FEW FAITHFUL POLLINATORS. OVERALL LOW FRUIT AND SEED SET ARE LIKELY BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF POLLEN AND RESOURCE LIMITATION, THE LATTER EXACERBATED BY NECTAR ROBBING.

ENVIRON.,"THE IMPORTANCE OF ROTATIONAL FALLOWS FOR POLLINATING INSECTS IN INTENSIVELY CULTIVATED FARMLAND WAS STUDIED IN A THREE-YEAR FIELD EXPERIMENT. THE FOCUS WAS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT METHOD (UNDERSOWING OR SEED MIXTURE SOWN POST-TILLAGE), SEED MIXTURE (COMPETITIVE FESTUCA PRATENSIS-PHLEUM PRATENSE-TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE OR LESS COMPETITIVE AGROSTIS CAPILLARIS-FESTUCA OVINA MIXTURE) AND DURATION (1 OR 2 YEARS) OF THE FALLOW. THE SEED MIXTURE AND DURATION AFFECTED THE POLLINATORS MORE THAN THE METHOD OF ESTABLISHMENT. POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER IN FALLOWS SOWN WITH LESS COMPETITIVE THAN WITH COMPETITIVE GRASSES AND IT INCREASED IN THE SECOND YEAR. STUBBLE FIELDS REACHED AS HIGH POLLINATOR SPECIES RICHNESS ALREADY DURING THE FIRST YEAR AS FALLOWS WITH LESS COMPETITIVE GRASSES DID IN THE SECOND YEAR. POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHEST IN THOSE TREATMENTS IN WHICH SPECIES RICHNESS OF FLOWERING PLANTS WAS HIGHEST. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE BENEFITS OF ROTATIONAL FALLOWS FOR POLLINATORS INCREASE WHEN THEY ARE ESTABLISHED AS STUBBLE OR USING SEEDS OF LESS COMPETITIVE GRASSES AND WHEN THE FIELD IS FALLOWED FOR (AT LEAST) TWO SUMMERS.

WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT: SEED PRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY INADEQUATE POLLINATION OR THAT POLLINATIONS BETWEEN NEAR NEIGHBOR PLANTS (INBREEDING DEPRESSION) OR BETWEEN DISTANT PLANTS (OUTBREEDING DEPRESSION) RESULTED IN REDUCED FRUIT OR SEED SET. EXAMPLES ARE GIVEN OF THE POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING EFFECT OF GRAZING ON FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTION. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT P OBCORDATA CAN HYBRIDIZE WITH ITS COMMON CONGENER, P. ACUTIFOLIA. ONLY CROSSES WITH P. OBCORDATA AS POLLEN RECIPIENT AND ? ACUTIFOLIA AS POLLEN DONOR SEEMED FERTILE. PRIMARY FLOWER-VISITORS OF?

THE OIL-COLLECTING BEE CENTRIS NITIDA, WHICH HAS RECENTLY NATURALIZED IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA, HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A NOVEL PARTICIPANT IN AN ENDEMIC SPECIALIZED MUTUALISM BETWEEN BYRSONIMA LUCIDA, A THREATENED NATIVE OIL PLANT, AND CENTRIS ERRANS, ITS SOLE NATIVE POLLINATOR. IN THIS STUDY, WE DETERMINED THE IMPACTS OF THIS NOVEL POLLINATOR ON B. LUCIDA BY ASSESSING THE DEGREE OF ITS POLLEN LIMITATIONS IN SITES WITH AND WITHOUT THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE, AS WELL AS IN NATURAL AND GARDEN SETTINGS. WE ALSO COMPARED THE KEY PROCESSES OF POLLINATION FOR BOTH OF THE CENTRIS BEE SPECIES. THE DEGREES OF POLLEN LIMITATION SUSTAINED BY B. LUCIDA WERE SIMILAR AMONG SITES WITH OR WITHOUT THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE, AND AMONG NATURAL OR GARDEN SITES. THE NATIVE OIL BEE'S VISITATION RATES (NO. OF VISITS/MINUTE/FLOWER) TO B. LUCIDA PLANTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT SITES WHERE THE INTRODUCED OIL BEES WERE PRESENT. THE NATIVE OIL BEE HAD A LOWER FORAGING RATE (NO. OF FLOWERS VISITED/MINUTE) AND WAS A LESS EFFICIENT POLLINATOR THAN THE INTRODUCED OIL BEE. THERE HAS BEEN NO OBSERVED NEGATIVE IMPACT TO EITHER THE NATIVE OIL PLANT OR BEE, THE INTRODUCED BEE IS ABSENT IN MOST NATURAL AREAS, AND IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE BEE MAY ARRIVE NATURALLY GIVEN THE TREND IN GLOBAL WARMING.

ALONG A GRADIENT FROM FOREST TO INTENSIVELY USED FARMLAND, WE QUANTIFIED BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, VISITATION RATES OF BEES AND POLLINATION SUCCESS OF WILD CHERRY TREES (PRUNUS AVIUM). WE ANALYSED THE EFFECTS OF STRUCTURAL HABITAT DIVERSITY AT A LOCAL SCALE AND OF THE PROPORTION OF SUITABLE HABITAT AROUND EACH TREE AT A LANDSCAPE SCALE. WE COMPARED THESE FINDINGS WITH THOSE FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES OF SEED-DISPERSING BIRDS AND MAMMALS IN THE SAME MODEL SYSTEM AND ALONG THE SAME LAND-USE GRADIENT. BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND VISITATION RATES WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHEST IN STRUCTURALLY SIMPLE HABITATS, WHEREAS BIRD SPECIES RICHNESS-BUT NOT THEIR VISITATION RATES-WERE HIGHEST IN STRUCTURALLY COMPLEX HABITATS. MAMMAL VISITATION RATES WERE ONLY INFLUENCED AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS OF ANIMALS RESPOND IDIOSYNCRATICALLY TO GRADIENTS IN HABITAT AND LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE. DESPITE STRONG EFFECTS ON BEES AND BIRDS, POLLINATION SUCCESS AND BIRD SEED REMOVAL DID NOT DIFFER ALONG THE LAND-USE GRADIENT AT BOTH SPATIAL SCALES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MOBILE ORGANISMS, SUCH AS BEES AND BIRDS, MOVE OVER LONG DISTANCES IN INTENSIVELY USED LANDSCAPES AND THEREBY BUFFER POLLINATION AND SEED-DISPERSAL INTERACTIONS. WE CONCLUDE THAT MEASURES OF SPECIES RICHNESS AND INTERACTION FREQUENCIES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT ON THEIR OWN TO UNDERSTAND THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES OF LAND-USE INTENSIFICATION ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING.",BIODIVERSITY; MUTUALISM; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTION; LAND-USE CHANGE; PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS,POLLEN-LIMITATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CROP POLLINATION; FRUIT-SET; BIODIVERSITY; CONSEQUENCES; CONSERVATION; FRAGMENTATION; BIRDS; REPRODUCTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,21,"BREITBACH, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), JOHANNES GUTENBERG UNIV MAINZ, COMMUNITY \& MACROECOL GRP, ABT OKOL, D-55099 MAINZ, GERMANY.;BREITBACH, NILS, TILLMANN, SVENJA, GRUENEWALD, CLAUDIA, LAUBE, IRINA, JOHANNES GUTENBERG UNIV MAINZ, COMMUNITY \& MACROECOL GRP, ABT OKOL, D-55099 MAINZ, GERMANY.;BREITBACH, NILS, SCHLEUNING, MATTHIAS, GRUENEWALD, CLAUDIA, LAUBE, IRINA, BOEHNING-GAESE, KATRIN, BIODIVERSITAT \& KLIMA FORSCH ZENTRUM BIK F, D-60325 FRANKFURT, GERMANY.;TILLMANN, SVENJA, UNIV GIESSEN, INST BIOL DIDAKT, D-35394 GIESSEN, GERMANY.;STEFFAN-DEWENTER, INGOLF, UNIV WURZBURG, LEHRSTUHL TIEROKOL \& TROPENBIOL ZOOL 3, D-97074 WURZBURG, GERMANY.;BOEHNING-GAESE, KATRIN, GOETHE UNIV FRANKFURT, INST OKOL EVOLUT \& DIVERSITAT, D-60323 FRANKFURT, GERMANY.",10.1007/S00442-011-2090-1,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",NA,DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [BO 1221/13-1]; MINISTRY FOR ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTRY RHINELAND-PALATINATE,"STUDIES OF SEED SET WERE SUPPORTED BY M.

BIOL.,"FLORAL TRAITS SUCH AS COLOR AND SIZE ARE HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED IN LILIES, BUT THEIR ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE REMAINS UNCERTAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE COMPARED POLLINATION PROCESSES BETWEEN LILIUM JAPONICUM VAR. ABEANUM AND VAR. JAPONICUM TO CLARIFY HOW THE TWO VARIETIES ARE ADAPTED TO DIFFERENT POLLINATORS. LILIUM JAPONICUM VAR. JAPONICUM IS KNOWN TO BE POLLINATED BY MOTHS, AND WE HYPOTHESIZED FROM ITS FLOWER TRAITS THAT VAR. ABEANUM IS POLLINATED BY DIURNAL INSECTS. USING WATERPROOF DIGITAL CAMERAS SET TO A RECORDING INTERVAL OF 1030 S, WE RECORDED FLOWER VISITORS FOR 79 FLOWERS OF VAR. JAPONICUM AND 46 FLOWERS OF VAR. ABEANUM OVER 24-H PERIODS. WE ALSO RECORDED THE NUMBER OF VERSATILE (T-SHAPED) AND RIGID (I-SHAPED) ANTHERS PER FLOWER. FOR VAR. ABEANUM, WE OBSERVED FLOWERS AT 05.00 AND 17.00 HOURS TO DETERMINE FLOWER OPENING TIME AND MEASURED THE INTENSITY OF FLORAL SCENT USING A METAL-OXIDE SEMI-CONDUCTOR ODOR SENSOR. BOTH DIURNAL AND NOCTURNAL INSECTS VISITED FLOWERS OF THE TWO VARIETIES, BUT VISITATION OF DIURNAL INSECTS WAS MORE FREQUENT IN VAR. ABEANUM. ANTHERS OF VAR. ABEANUM ARE USUALLY RIGID, AS IN MANY BEE-POLLINATED FLOWERS, WHEREAS THOSE OF VAR. JAPONICUM ARE MOSTLY VERSATILE. ALTHOUGH FLOWERS OF VAR. JAPONICUM ARE KNOWN TO OPEN IN THE EVENING, 32\% OF THE FLOWERS OF VAR. ABEANUM STARTED TO FLOWER DURING THE DAY. LILIUM JAPONICUM VAR. ABEANUM EMITTED SCENT AT NIGHT, WITH A MAXIMUM INTENSITY AT 20.00 HOURS, JUST AS IN VAR. JAPONICUM. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE FLORAL TRAITS OF THE TWO VARIETIES ARE ADAPTED TO THE DIFFERENT RELATIVE AVAILABILITIES OF NOCTURNAL VERSUS DIURNAL POLLINATORS. THE FLOWER OF VAR.

MODEL.,"A SUBSTANTIAL HONEYBEE DECLINE IS BEING OBSERVED WORLDWIDE. AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND LOSS OF WILD FLORAL RESOURCES RANK AMONG THE MAIN FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECLINE. LANDSCAPE ENHANCEMENT OF FLORAL RESOURCES HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN AGRO-ENVIRONMENTAL SCHEME INTENDED TO PROVIDE HONEYBEES WITH COMPENSATORY FOOD SOURCES IN INTENSIVE AGROSYSTEMS. FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY HAS RARELY BEEN EVALUATED WITH RESPECT TO LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. IN THIS STUDY, WE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED A MODELING TOOL TO DELINEATE THE LANDSCAPE AREAS LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICIENCY OF FLORAL ENHANCEMENT SCHEMES. IN PARTICULAR, THE PROXIMITY OF SOME LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS USED BY HONEYBEES, EITHER AS FORAGING HABITAT OR AS VISUAL LANDMARK FOR ORIENTATION, MAY PARTLY DETERMINE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY. WE INVESTIGATED THIS ISSUE USING RESOURCE SELECTION FUNCTIONS (RSFS), I.E. MODELS THAT AIM TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCE OF FORAGING HONEYBEES AT FLORAL PATCHES AS A FUNCTION OF THE PRESENCE OF KEYSTONE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS IN THEIR PROXIMITY. HOWEVER, DECIDING WHICH LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVELY IN THE PROXIMITY OR NOT IS MOSTLY A MATTER OF SUBJECTIVITY. THE NOVELTY OF OUR APPROACH RESIDES IN ITS USE OF A DISTANCE-WEIGHTING FUNCTION TO EXPLICITLY ACCOUNT FOR THE SPATIAL LOCATION OF SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. IN THAT RESPECT, A DISTANCE FUNCTION SHOULD BE SCALED ON MOVEMENT PATTERNS OF FORAGING ORGANISMS. HEREIN, WE INFERRED MOVEMENT PATTERNS FROM THE AUTOCORRELATIVE PROPERTIES OF HONEYBEE FORAGING ACTIVITY. THIS MODELING APPROACH WAS DEVELOPED ON PHACELIA (PHACELIA TANACETIFOLIA) FIELD MARGIN STRIPS, A TYPICAL ``HONEYBEE-FRIENDLY FLORAL SCHEME. A FORAGING SURVEY CONDUCTED ON 170 PHACELIA PLOTS (2 M X 2 M) FROM 17 PHACELIA STRIPS, ALL POSITIONED WITHIN THE FORAGING RANGE OF AN EXPERIMENTAL APIARY, REVEALED THAT (I) THE FLORAL SCHEME EFFICIENCY IS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENCE OF LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND FOREST EDGES, BUT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PRESENCE OF ALTERNATIVE FLORAL RESOURCES, AND THAT (II) WEIGHTING THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS BY INCORPORATING A DISTANCE FUNCTION INTO MODELS CONSIDERABLY IMPROVED THEIR PREDICTIVE POWER. THIS MODELING TOOL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP LAND MANAGERS OPTIMIZING THEIR FINANCIAL INVESTMENT BY AVOIDING LOW-EFFICIENCY LANDSCAPE AREAS, OR FAVORING HIGH-EFFICIENCY ONES, AT THE TIME OF PLANNING FLORAL ENHANCEMENT SCHEMES.

DESPITE A DECREASE IN PLANT SIZE, SEVERAL MEASURES OF FLOWER SIZE INCREASED WITH ELEVATION. BUMBLE BEES WERE THE MAIN POLLINATORS AT BOTH ALPINE AND LOWLAND SITES IN THE STUDY AREA. HOWEVER, SPECIES COMPOSITION OF THE POLLINATOR FAUNA DIFFERED, AND POLLINATORS WERE LARGER IN HIGHER-ELEVATION THAN IN LOWER-ELEVATION SITES. POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES WERE LOWER AT HIGHER-ELEVATIONS THAN AT LOWER ELEVATIONS. POLLEN LIMITATION OF SEED SET DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ALTITUDE.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES WHETHER DISEASES FROM COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES THREATEN NATIVE SPECIES IN THE UK. WE SAMPLED BUMBLE BEES FROM TEN SOFT FRUIT FARMS: FIVE THAT DEPLOY COMMERCIAL BOMBUS TERRESTRIS AND FIVE THAT DO NOT. EACH FARM WAS VISITED MONTHLY THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND WORKERS OF B. TERRESTRIS, B. PRATORUM, B. PASCUORUM AND B. LAPIDARIUS WERE CAPTURED. THE FAECES OF THESE BEES WERE INSPECTED FOR THE GUT MICROPARASITES CRITHIDIA SPP., NOSEMA BOMBI AND APICYSTIS BOMBI. PREVALENCE WAS DEFINED AS THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS INFECTED AND ABUNDANCE WAS DEFINED AS THE NUMBER OF PATHOGEN CELLS PER VOLUME OF BUMBLE BEE FAECES. THE PREVALENCE OF A. BOMBI AND N. BOMBI WAS TOO LOW TO ANALYSE. THE PREVALENCE AND ABUNDANCE OF CRITHIDIA SPP. WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG BUMBLE BEE SPECIES. OVERALL, THE PREVALENCE OF CRITHIDIA SPP. WAS INITIALLY LOWER ON FARMS DEPLOYING COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES, POSSIBLY DUE TO A DILUTION EFFECT CAUSED BY THE HIGH DENSITY OF IMPORTED BEES. CRITHIDIA SPP. PREVALENCE IN BOMBUS TERRESTRIS, HOWEVER, ROSE SHARPLY ON COMMERCIAL FARMS AT THE END OF THE SEASON. ONE POTENTIAL EXPLANATION IS THAT COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES CONTRACT THE LOCAL PATHOGEN, WHICH IS THEN RAPIDLY TRANSMITTED AMONG THEM DUE TO THE HIGH BEE DENSITY. WHILST OUR DATA PROVIDE NO EVIDENCE OF PATHOGEN SPILLOVER TO WILD SPECIES, IT WOULD BE PREMATURE TO CONCLUDE WITH CERTAINTY THAT COMMERCIAL COLONIES DO NOT REPRESENT A DISEASE RISK TO NATIVE BEES IN THE UK AND WE URGE FURTHER STUDIES INTO THIS PHENOMENON.",BOMBUS; PATHOGEN SPILLOVER; CRITHIDIA SPP.; NOSEMA BOMBI; APICYSTIS BOMBI; SOFT FRUIT POLLINATION,HOST-PARASITE; CRITHIDIA-BOMBI; FORAGING RANGE; L.

GESLIN B;GAUZENS B;THEBAULT E;DAJOZ I,GESLIN B,PLANT POLLINATOR NETWORKS ALONG A GRADIENT OF URBANISATION,PLOS ONE,PLOS ONE,"BACKGROUND: HABITAT LOSS IS ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL CAUSES OF THE CURRENT POLLINATOR DECLINE. WITH AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, INCREASING URBANISATION IS AMONG THE MAIN DRIVERS OF HABITAT LOSS. CONSEQUENTLY STUDIES FOCUSING ON POLLINATOR COMMUNITY STRUCTURE ALONG URBANISATION GRADIENTS HAVE INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED HOW URBANISATION AFFECTS PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION NETWORKS. HERE WE ASSESSED MODIFICATIONS OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS ALONG AN URBANISATION GRADIENT BASED ON THE STUDY OF THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: ALONG AN URBANISATION GRADIENT COMPRISING FOUR TYPES OF LANDSCAPE CONTEXTS (SEMI-NATURAL, AGRICULTURAL, SUBURBAN, URBAN), WE SET UP EXPERIMENTAL PLANT COMMUNITIES CONTAINING TWO PLANT FUNCTIONAL GROUPS DIFFERING IN THEIR MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS (OPEN FLOWERS'' AND ``TUBULAR FLOWERS''). INSECT VISITATIONS ON THESE COMMUNITIES WERE RECORDED TO BUILD PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS. A TOTAL OF 17 857 INTERACTIONS WERE RECORDED BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL PLANT COMMUNITIES AND FLOWER-VISITORS. THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS PERFORMED BY FLOWER-VISITORS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN URBAN LANDSCAPE CONTEXT THAN IN SEMI-NATURAL AND AGRICULTURAL ONES. IN PARTICULAR, INSECTS SUCH AS SYRPHIDAE AND SOLITARY BEES THAT MOSTLY VISITED THE OPEN FLOWER FUNCTIONAL GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY URBANISATION, WHICH WAS NOT THE CASE FOR BUMBLEBEES. URBANISATION ALSO IMPACTED THE GENERALISM OF FLOWER-VISITORS AND WE DETECTED HIGHER INTERACTION EVENNESS IN URBAN LANDSCAPE CONTEXT THAN IN AGRICULTURAL AND SUBURBAN ONES. FINALLY, IN URBAN CONTEXT, THESE MODIFICATIONS LOWERED THE POTENTIAL REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE OPEN FLOWERS FUNCTIONAL GROUP.

HOWEVER, INFORMATION ON SOIL N PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH BEE FRASS IS NOT AVAILABLE. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS WORK WERE TO 1) ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF BEE FRASS PRODUCED BY A HONEY BEE COLONY AND 2) EVALUATE NITROGEN MINERALIZATION AND AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION FROM BEE FRASS WHEN SURFACE APPLIED OR INCORPORATED INTO SOIL. TWO CAGE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF FRASS PRODUCED BY A 5000-BEE COLONY, AND THREE LABORATORY STUDIES WERE CARRIED OUT IN WHICH BEE FRASS, SURFACE-APPLIED OR INCORPORATED INTO SOIL, WAS INCUBATED AT 25 DEGREES C FOR 15 TO 45 DAYS. THE AVERAGE RATE OF BEE FRASS PRODUCTION BY A 5,000-BEE COLONY WAS ESTIMATED AT 2.27 TO 2.69 G N MONTH(-1). NITROGEN MINERALIZATION FROM BEE FRASS DURING 30 DAYS RELEASED 20\% OF THE ORGANIC N WHEN BEE FRASS WAS SURFACE APPLIED AND 34\% WHEN FRASS WAS INCORPORATED INTO THE SOIL. VOLATILIZED NH3 CORRESPONDED TO 1\% OR LESS OF TOTAL N. THE POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF INORGANIC N RELEASED TO THE SOIL BY A TYPICAL COLONY OF 20,000 BEES FORAGING IN AN AREA SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL CAGES (3.24 M(2)) WAS ESTIMATED AT 0.62 TO 0.74 G N M(-2) MONTH(-1) WHICH MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AT A COMMUNITY SCALE IN TERMS OF SOIL MICROBIAL ACTIVITY AND PLANT GROWTH.

MANY STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED HOW POLLINATORS AND FLORAL RESOURCES COVARY IN SPACE, BUT FEW HAVE LOOKED AT THEIR COVARIANCE AMONG YEARS.

FIRST, I QUANTIFIED THE RATE AT WHICH INDIVIDUAL PLANTS WERE VISITED BY BEES. ANTHOPHORA SHOWED EVIDENCE OF A DEMOGRAPHIC RESPONSE TO RESOURCE PULSESTHAT IS, MORE INDIVIDUALS WERE SEEN IN THE YEAR AFTER A HIGH-FLOWERING YEARWHEREAS BOMBUS DID NOT. SECOND, I QUANTIFIED POLLINATOR BEHAVIOR BY FOLLOWING INDIVIDUAL BEES AND RECORDING THE PROPORTION OF VISITS TO A. SCAPHOIDES WITHIN SINGLE FORAGING BOUTS. THE PROPORTION OF VISITS TO A. SCAPHOIDES BY BOTH TAXA INCREASED WITH A. SCAPHOIDES''S FLOWERING DENSITY. HIGHER SPECIALIZATION IN HIGH-FLOWERING YEARS LIKELY MAKES BOTH TAXA BETTER POLLINATORS IN HIGH-FLOWERING YEARS. IF THESE TAXA DIFFER IN EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS, THEN THESE RESPONSES TRANSLATE INTO VARIATION IN POLLINATION SERVICES IN SPACE AND TIME, SPECIFICALLY, MORE ACTIVITY BY BOMBUS IN HIGH-FLOWERING YEARS AND MORE BY ANTHOPHORA IN YEARS FOLLOWING HIGH-FLOWERING YEARS.

HOWEVER, IN SPECIES OF GENERALIZED POLLINATION, THE ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN LOCAL POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION OF FLORAL TRAITS IS DIFFICULT TO TEST. A CRUCIAL LINE OF EVIDENCE IS TO CONTRAST THE DIRECTION AND STRENGTH OF POLLINATOR SELECTION AMONG POPULATIONS. METHODOLOGY. VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES WAS INVESTIGATED IN TWO POPULATIONS OF A GENERALIST-POLLINATED HERB, TROLLIUS RANUNCULOIDES (RANUNCULACEAE), TO DETECT THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN FLORAL DIFFERENTIATION. PIVOTAL RESULTS. THE ALPINE POPULATION WAS VISITED MORE BY FLIES, AND THE SUBALPINE POPULATION WAS VISITED MORE BY BEES. FLOWER MANIPULATIONS SUGGESTED THAT LARGE FLOWERS WERE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BOTH BEES AND FLIES, WHILE MORE PETALS WERE FAVORED ONLY BY NECTAR-FEEDING FLIES. COMPARED TO THE SUBALPINE POPULATION, PLANTS IN THE ALPINE POPULATION HAD MORE PETALS PER FLOWER BUT SMALLER FLOWERS WHERE FLIES WERE PREDOMINANT POLLINATORS. FLOWER DIFFERENCES APPEARED TO BE GENETICALLY MAINTAINED IN A COMMON GARDEN. PHENOTYPIC SELECTION ANALYSIS INDICATED STRONGER SELECTION ON PETAL NUMBER IN THE ALPINE POPULATION AND OPPOSITELY MORE INTENSE SELECTION ON FLOWER DIAMETER IN THE SUBALPINE POPULATION, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PREFERENCES OF LOCAL POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES.

IDENTIFYING SUCH REDUCED-RISK PESTICIDES REQUIRES TOXICITY TESTS USING BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT AND STANDARDIZED EXPOSURE METHODS. OUR GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP A FUNCTIONAL AND RELIABLE QUEEN-LESS MICRO-COLONY METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE SUBLETHAL EFFECTS OF PESTICIDES ON BOMBUS IMPATIENS CRESSON, A SPECIES FOR WHICH FURTHER TOXICITY ASSESSMENTS ARE NEEDED. ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED USING BOMBUS TERRESTRIS (L.), THIS METHOD INVOLVES ISOLATING THREE WORKERS AND ALLOWING THEM TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A COLONY.

STUD.,"BACKGROUND: TETRACENTRON SINENSE OLIV. IS AN ENDANGERED TREE MAINLY DISTRIBUTED IN SOUTH-CENTRAL CHINA. THE BREEDING SYSTEM AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF T. SINENSE ARE UNCLEAR. WITH A CONSERVATION PERSPECTIVE, THE FLORAL BIOLOGY, BREEDING SYSTEM AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY OF TETRACENTRON SINENSE OLIV. WERE INVESTIGATED, IN ORDER TO DISCUSS THE ENDANGERED FACTORS RELATED TO POLLINATION, AND TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR ITS CONSERVATION. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS REVEALED FOUR IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF T. SINENSE. 1) T. SINENSE USUALLY FLOWERS BY THE BEGINNING OF JUNE, AND THE FLOWERING PERIOD OF THE POPULATION IS ABOUT TWO MONTHS, AND THE FLORESCENCE OF FLORETS LASTED FOR 15 TO 24 DAYS WITH DELICATE FRAGRANCE. 2) THE POLLEN/OVULE RATIO IS 720 +/- 28, AND THE OUTCROSSING INDEX IS THREE. ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT T. SINENSE IS SELF-COMPATIBLE, WITH FACULTATIVE XENOGAMY AND NO INDICATION OF AGAMOSPERMY. 3) THE POLLINATION SYNDROME IS AMBOPHILY, AND SELF-POLLINATION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN FRUIT PRODUCTION IF WIND AND INSECT POLLINATION IS UNAVAILABLE. 4) INSECT POLLINATORS WERE PREDOMINANTLY REPRESENTED BY COLEOPTERA, DIPTERA AND HYMENOPTERA. SYRPHID FLY AND BEES WERE THE MAIN EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT T. SINENSE EXHIBITS A MIXED-MATING SYSTEM, AND AUTOGAMY IN ITS BREEDING SYSTEM MAY PROVIDE REPRODUCTIVE ASSURANCE FOR THE POPULATION MAINTENANCE.

DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) AS GLOBAL POLLINATORS, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING HOW POLLEN COLLECTION PATTERNS VARY BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, COLONIES, AND LANDSCAPES. IN THIS STUDY, VOSNESENSKY BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS VOSNESENSKII RADOSZKOWSKI) WERE COLLECTED FROM A RANGE OF HUMAN-ALTERED AND NATURAL LANDSCAPES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. EXTENSIVE VEGETATION SURVEYS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)-BASED HABITAT CLASSIFICATIONS WERE CONDUCTED AT EACH SITE, BEES WERE GENOTYPED TO IDENTIFY COLONY MATES, AND POLLEN LOADS WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY VISITED PLANTS. IN CONTRAST TO PREDICTIONS BASED ON STRONG COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS, POLLEN LOAD COMPOSITION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SIMILAR FOR BEES CAPTURED IN A SHARED STUDY REGION COMPARED WITH BEES THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH AREA BUT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SIMILAR FOR COLONY MATES. PREFERENCE ANALYSES REVEALED THAT POLLEN LOADS WERE NOT COMPOSED OF THE MOST ABUNDANT PLANT SPECIES PER STUDY REGION. THE MAJORITY OF RANKED POLLEN PREFERENCE LISTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED FOR PAIRWISE COMPARISONS OF COLONY MATES AND INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A STUDY REGION, WHEREAS THE MAJORITY OF PAIRWISE COMPARISONS OF RANKED POLLEN PREFERENCE LISTS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS LOCATED AT SEPARATE STUDY REGIONS WERE UNCORRELATED. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLEN LOAD COMPOSITION AND FORAGING PREFERENCES ARE SIMILAR FOR BEES THROUGHOUT A SHARED LANDSCAPE REGARDLESS OF COLONY MEMBERSHIP.

THE PRESENT OBJECTIVE IS TO DETERMINE THE CORRELATION AMONG THE DESCRIPTORS OF BEES AND WASPS ASSEMBLAGES WITH FRAGMENT PREDICTORS (SIZE, CONNECTIVITY AND EDGE EFFECT) WITHIN A FRAGMENTED LANDSCAPE OF SEMIDECIDUAL SEASONAL FOREST (PARANA STATE, BRAZIL). FOR THIS PURPOSE FIVE FOREST FRAGMENTS, FROM THREE TO 484 HECTARES, WERE SAMPLED DURING A YEAR, SUMMING UP 480 SAMPLES OF BAITED TRAPS AND 3,480 OF BOWL TRAPS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT ABUNDANCE OF APINAE AND OLIGOLECTIC BEES INCREASE AND THE RICHNESS OF AUGOCHLORINI BEES DECREASES WITH INCREASING FRAGMENT SIZE. CONNECTIVITY HAS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BEE RICHNESS AND EDGE EFFECT HAS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED THE ABUNDANCE OF OLIGOLETIC BEES. ORCHID BEES ALSO RESPOND TO THE SITE PREDICTORS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE EUFRIESEA VIOLACEA, WHICH ABUNDANCE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FRAGMENT SIZE AND CONNECTIVITY, HOWEVER NEGATIVELY WITH EDGE EFFECT, AND EUFRIESEA NIGRITA WHICH ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH FRAGMENT SIZE, BUT POSITIVELY WITH EDGE EFFECT. COMPOSITION OF BEES, CRABRONIDAE AND POMPILIDAE WASPS WERE INFLUENCED BY FRAGMENT SIZE.

POLLINATORS CAN USE ADVERTISING TRAITS TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUALITY AND AMOUNT OF REWARDS, LEADING TO THE EVOLUTION OF SIGNAL-REWARD CORRELATIONS. AS LONG AS PLANTS DIFFER IN THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR SIGNALS AND POLLINATORS BASE THEIR FORAGING DECISIONS ON THIS INFORMATION, NATURAL SELECTION SHOULD ACT ON WITHIN-INDIVIDUAL CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SIGNALS AND REWARDS. BECAUSE BIRDS AND BEES DIFFER IN THEIR COGNITIVE CAPABILITIES, AND USE DIFFERENT FLORAL TRAITS AS SIGNALS, WE TESTED THE OCCURRENCE OF ADAPTIVE DIVERGENCE OF THE WITHININDIVIDUAL SIGNAL-REWARD CORRELATIONS AMONG SALVIA SPECIES THAT ARE POLLINATED EITHER BY BEES OR BY HUMMINGBIRDS.

PRIVATE GARDENS, URBAN PARKS OR GREEN ROOFS MAY SUPPORT RELATIVELY HIGH DENSITIES OF DIVERSE WILD BEES. KNOWLEDGE IS LACKING REGARDING BEE ASSEMBLAGES IN PARIS, THE FRENCH CAPITAL, AND ONE OF THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED PART OF FRANCE. IN THIS CONTEXT, WE HERE PROVIDE A FIRST ASSESSMENT OF THE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL COMPOSITION OF BEE ASSEMBLAGES IN THREE URBAN PARKS IN DOWNTOWN PARIS. BEES WERE SAMPLED WITH A SET OF THREE COLOURED PAN TRAPS PER PARK. FIFTEEN 24-HOUR SESSIONS WERE PERFORMED FROM APRIL TO JULY 2011. WE CAPTURED 425 SPECIMENS FROM 44 SPECIES REPRESENTING FIVE FAMILIES AND 11 GENERA. THE ASSEMBLAGE WAS DOMINATED BY HALICTIDAE (15 SPECIES REPRESENTING 70.1\% OF TOTAL ABUNDANCE), ESPECIALLY THE EUSOCIAL SPECIES LASIOGLOSSUM MORIO THAT MADE 25.2\% OF TOTAL ABUNDANCE. FROM A FUNCTIONAL POINT OF VIEW, THERE WERE ONLY TWO SPECIES OF PARASITIC BEES THAT MADE 1.2\% OF TOTAL ABUNDANCE. MOST NON-PARASITIC SPECIES WERE POLYLECTIC AND BELOW-GROUND NESTING.

ENTOMOL.,"DEFORESTATION HAS DRAMATICALLY REDUCED THE EXTENT OF ATLANTIC FOREST COVER IN BRAZIL. ORCHID BEES ARE KEY POLLINATORS IN NEOTROPICAL FOREST, AND MANY SPECIES ARE SENSITIVE TO ANTHROPOGENIC INTERFERENCE. IN THIS SENSE UNDERSTANDING THE MATRIX PERMEABILITY FOR THESE BEES IS IMPORTANT FOR MAINTAINING GENETIC DIVERSITY AND POLLINATION SERVICES. OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE COMPOSITION, ABUNDANCE, AND DIVERSITY OF ORCHID BEES IN MATRICES DIFFERED FROM THOSE IN ATLANTIC FOREST. TO DO THIS WE SAMPLED ORCHID BEES AT 4-MO INTERVALS FROM 2007 TO 2009 IN REMNANTS OF ATLANTIC FOREST, AND IN THE SURROUNDING PASTURE AND EUCALYPTUS MATRICES. THE ABUNDANCE, RICHNESS, AND DIVERSITY OF ORCHID BEES DIMINISHED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FOREST FRAGMENT TOWARD THE MATRIX POINTS IN THE EUCALYPTUS AND PASTURE. SOME COMMON OR INTERMEDIATE SPECIES IN THE FOREST AREAS, SUCH AS EULAEMA CINGULATA (F.) AND EUGLOSSA FIMBRIATA MOURE, RESPECTIVELY, BECOME RARE SPECIES IN THE MATRICES. OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE ORCHID BEE COMMUNITY IS AFFECTED BY THE MATRICES SURROUNDING THE FOREST FRAGMENTS. THEY ALSO SUGGEST THAT CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FOREST FRAGMENTS NEED TO BE IMPROVED USING FRIENDLY MATRICES THAT CAN PROVIDE MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR BEES AND INCREASE THEIR DISPERSAL BETWEEN FRAGMENTS.",ANTHROPIC DISTURBANCE; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; CHEMICAL BAIT; EUGLOSSINE BEE; GENE FLOW,TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST; EUGLOSSINE BEES; HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; APIDAE; HYMENOPTERA; DIVERSITY; DYNAMICS; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS; DISTURBANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"DE AGUIAR, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ESTADUAL FEIRA DE SANTANA, LAB ESTUDOS AMBIENTAIS, PROGRAMA POSGRAD MODELAGEM CIENCIAS TERRA \& AMBIE, AV TRANSNORDESTINA S-N, BR-44036900 FEIRA DE SANTANA, BA, BRAZIL.;DE AGUIAR, WILLIAN MOURA, UNIV ESTADUAL FEIRA DE SANTANA, LAB ESTUDOS AMBIENTAIS, PROGRAMA POSGRAD MODELAGEM CIENCIAS TERRA \& AMBIE, BR-44036900 FEIRA DE SANTANA, BA, BRAZIL.;DE AGUIAR, WILLIAN MOURA, GAGLIANONE, MARIA CRISTINA, UNIV ESTADUAL NORTE FLUMINENSE, PROGRAMA POSGRAD ECOL \& RECURSOS NAT, LAB CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS, BR-28013600 CAMPOS DOS GOYTACAZES, RJ, BRAZIL.;SOFIA, SILVIA H., UNIV ESTADUAL LONDRINA, DEPT BIOL GERAL, LAB GENET \& ECOL ANIM, BR-86057970 LONDRINA, PR, BRAZIL.;MELO, GABRIEL A.

SINCE THESE PROCESSES ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF AFFECTING THE ONTOGENETIC DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIES INHABITING THOSE LANDSCAPES, HERE WE MEASURED THE WING VEINS OF MALE EULAEMA NIGRITA LEPELETIER (APIDAE: EUGLOSSINI) BEES IN ORDER TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE BEES SAMPLED IN AGRICULTURE (AG) AREAS SUFFER HIGHER FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY (FA) THAN THOSE SAMPLED IN CERRADO (CE) AREAS IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF GOIAS.

THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF FA MAY BE RELATED TO INHERENT BIONOMIC FEATURES OF E. NIGRITA. FOR INSTANCE, GIVEN THEIR HIGH INDIVIDUAL DISPERSAL ABILITIES, THE INDIVIDUALS WE ANALYZED MAY HAVE DEVELOPED IN DIFFERENT AREAS THAN THOSE WHERE THEY WERE SAMPLED. THEIR GENERALIST FEEDING BEHAVIOR MAY ALSO HAVE GIVEN THEM A HIGHER RESISTANCE TO ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS, BUFFERING THE NORMAL DEVELOPMENT OF IMMATURES EVEN IN AREAS WITH LOCAL HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS.

BOMBUS BELLICOSUS IS ONE OF THE RARE CASES OF REPORTED THREATENED BUMBLEBEES IN SOUTH AMERICA. IT WAS ONCE WIDESPREAD IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL'S GRASSLANDS UNTIL THE 1960S. DURING THAT TIME, THAT AREA UNDERWENT INCREASING LAND USE WHICH LED TO A DECREASE IN BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS, AND TO LOCAL DISAPPEARANCE OF B. BELLICOSUS. CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO BELIEVED TO CAUSE DECLINES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF B. BELLICOSUS. HERE WE USED SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS TO ASSESS POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGES ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF B.

TO TEST THIS, WE ESTABLISHED WILDFLOWER STRIPS IN FOUR EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, USING THE SAME SEED MIXTURE OF FORAGE PLANTS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED AT BEES.

WILDFLOWER STRIPS GENERALLY ENHANCED LOCAL BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS, INCLUDING RED-LISTED SPECIES.

HOWEVER, NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION ON BIODIVERSITY CAN BE REDUCED IF RESOURCES IN URBAN OR SEMI-NATURAL AREAS IN THE SURROUNDING MATRIX CAN BE USED BY WILDLIFE. WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF FLORAL AND NESTING RESOURCES IN URBAN- AND FOREST-ASSOCIATED OAK-SAVANNAH FRAGMENTS, SURROUNDING URBAN AND FOREST MATRIX, AND URBAN AREAS SPATIALLY INDEPENDENT FROM OAK-SAVANNAH HABITAT ON POLLINATOR COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN A FRAGMENTED OAK-SAVANNAH ECOSYSTEM. BOTH INDEPENDENT URBAN AND URBAN MATRIX SITES SUPPORTED HIGH ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS RELATIVE TO OTHER FRAGMENT CATEGORIES, ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEASON WHEN PLANTS AND POLLINATORS IN OAK-SAVANNAH FRAGMENTS WERE SCARCE. A SPECIES OF PARTICULAR CONSERVATION CONCERN IN OUR REGION, BOMBUS OCCIDENTALIS, WAS SUPPORTED BY LATE-FLOWERING RESOURCES IN OUR URBAN SITES. FOREST-ASSOCIATED OAK-SAVANNAH FRAGMENTS WERE MISSING LATE-SEASON SPECIES WHILE URBAN-ASSOCIATED FRAGMENTS SUPPORTED HIGH ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF MID- TO LATE-SEASON POLLINATORS, LIKELY DUE TO SUPPLEMENTAL USE OF FLORAL RESOURCES IN THE URBAN MATRIX. FEMALE CAVITY-NESTING AND GROUND-NESTING BEES WERE NOT RESTRICTED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF NATURAL NESTING RESOURCES WE EXPECTED THEM TO REQUIRE (E.G. SMALL CAVITIES, BARE SOIL).

THIS STUDY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE CHOICE OF FLOWER COLOUR BY THESE MAJOR POLLINATORS CAN HELP EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOUR OBSERVED IN A. COERULEA POPULATIONS. METHODS DUAL CHOICE ASSAYS AND EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS OF BLUE AND WHITE FLOWERS WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE PREFERENCE OF HAWKMOTHS AND BUMBLE-BEES FOR FLOWER COLOUR. A TEST WAS MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DIFFERENTIAL PREFERENCE FOR FLOWER COLOUR, WITH BUMBLE-BEES PREFERRING BLUE AND HAWKMOTHS WHITE FLOWERS, COULD EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOUR. WHETHER A SINGLE POLLINATOR COULD MAINTAIN A FLOWER COLOUR POLYMORPHISM WAS EXAMINED BY TESTING TO SEE IF PREFERENCE FOR A FLOWER COLOUR VARIED BETWEEN DAY AND DUSK FOR HAWKMOTHS AND WHETHER BUMBLE-BEES PREFERRED NOVEL OR RARE FLOWER COLOUR MORPHS. KEY RESULTS HAWKMOTHS PREFERRED BLUE FLOWERS UNDER BOTH DAY AND DUSK LIGHT CONDITIONS. NAIVE BUMBLE-BEES PREFERRED BLUE FLOWERS BUT QUICKLY LEARNED TO FORAGE RANDOMLY ON THE TWO COLOUR MORPHS WHEN SIMILAR REWARDS WERE PRESENTED IN THE FLOWERS. BEES QUICKLY LEARNED TO ASSOCIATE A FLOWER COLOUR WITH A POLLEN REWARD. PRIOR EXPERIENCE AFFECTED THE CHOICE OF FLOWER COLOUR BY BEES, BUT THEY DID NOT PREFERENTIALLY VISIT NOVEL FLOWER COLOURS OR RARE OR COMMON COLOUR MORPHS. CONCLUSIONS DIFFERENCES IN FLOWER COLOUR PREFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO MAJOR POLLINATORS COULD NOT EXPLAIN THE VARIATION IN FLOWER COLOUR OBSERVED IN A. COERULEA. THE PREFERENCE OF HAWKMOTHS FOR FLOWER COLOUR DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN DAY AND DUSK, AND BUMBLE-BEES DID NOT PREFER A NOVEL OR A RARE FLOWER COLOUR MORPH.

HERE WE PROPOSE A METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK, WHICH INTEGRATES SPECIES DISTRIBUTION FORECASTS AND GRAPH THEORY TO IDENTIFY KEY CONSERVATION AREAS, WHICH IF PROTECTED OR RESTORED COULD IMPROVE HABITAT CONNECTIVITY AND SAFEGUARD ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. WE APPLIED THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK TO THE PROVISION OF POLLINATION SERVICES BY A TROPICAL STINGLESS BEE (MELIPONA QUADRIFASCIATA), A KEY POLLINATOR OF NATIVE FLORA FROM THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC FOREST AND IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL CROPS. BASED ON THE CURRENT DISTRIBUTION OF THIS BEE AND THAT OF THE PLANT SPECIES USED TO FEED AND NEST, WE PROJECTED THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION OF BEES AND PLANTS IN THE FUTURE, CONSIDERING A MODERATE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO (FOLLOWING IPPC). WE THEN USED THIS INFORMATION, THE BEE'S FLIGHT RANGE, AND THE CURRENT MAPPING OF ATLANTIC FOREST REMNANTS TO INFER HABITAT SUITABILITY AND QUANTIFY LOCAL AND REGIONAL HABITAT CONNECTIVITY FOR 2030, 2050 AND 2080. OUR RESULTS REVEALED NORTH TO SOUTH AND COASTAL TO INLAND SHIFTS IN THE POLLINATOR DISTRIBUTION DURING THE NEXT 70 YEARS. CURRENT AND FUTURE CONNECTIVITY MAPS UNRAVELED THE MOST IMPORTANT CORRIDORS, WHICH IF PROTECTED OR RESTORED, COULD FACILITATE THE DISPERSAL AND ESTABLISHMENT OF BEES DURING DISTRIBUTION SHIFTS.

ECOL.,"A CENTRAL QUESTION IN THE FIELD OF PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS IS WHETHER AND HOW CAN PLANTS CHOOSE THE OPTIMAL POLLINATORS WHEN PLANTS CANNOT DIRECTLY ASSESS THE QUALITY OF FLORAL VISITORS. TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND TO PROVIDE A NEW PERSPECTIVE TO THIS PROBLEM, WE DEVELOP A SCREENING GAME MODELING THE PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTION. WE PROPOSE THAT SOME FLORAL TRAITS COULD BE INTERPRETED AS AN ENTRY BARRIER WITH A STRATEGIC COST THE PLANTS IMPOSE ON FLORAL VISITORS. THE POLLINATORS DECIDE TO FURTHER INTERACT WITH THE PLANT ONLY IF THE COST IS NOT PROHIBITIVE.

DISTRIB.,"AIM ALIEN SPECIES ALTER INTERACTION NETWORKS BY DISRUPTING EXISTING INTERACTIONS, FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN PLANTS AND POLLINATORS, AND BY ENGAGING IN NEW INTERACTIONS. PREDICTING THE EFFECTS OF AN INCOMING INVADER CAN BE DIFFICULT, ALTHOUGH RECENT WORK SUGGESTS SPECIES ROLES IN INTERACTION NETWORKS MAY BE CONSERVED ACROSS LOCATIONS. WE TEST WHETHER SPECIES ROLES IN PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS DIFFER BETWEEN THEIR NATIVE AND ALIEN RANGES AND WHETHER THE FORMER CAN BE USED TO PREDICT THE LATTER. LOCATION WORLD-WIDE. METHODS WE USED 64 PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS TO SEARCH FOR SPECIES OCCURRING IN AT LEAST ONE NETWORK IN ITS NATIVE RANGE AND ONE NETWORK IN ITS ALIEN RANGE. WE FOUND 17 SPECIES MEETING THESE CRITERIA, DISTRIBUTED IN 48 PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS. WE CHARACTERIZED EACH SPECIES' ROLE BY ESTIMATING SPECIES-LEVEL NETWORK INDICES: NORMALIZED DEGREE, CLOSENESS CENTRALITY, BETWEENNESS CENTRALITY AND TWO MEASURES OF CONTRIBUTION TO MODULARITY (C- AND Z-SCORES). LINEAR MIXED MODELS AND LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO TEST FOR DIFFERENCES IN SPECIES ROLE BETWEEN NATIVE AND ALIEN RANGES AND TO PREDICT THOSE ROLES FROM THE NATIVE TO THE ALIEN RANGE, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS SPECIES ROLES VARIED CONSIDERABLY ACROSS SPECIES. NEVERTHELESS, ALTHOUGH SPECIES LOST THEIR NATIVE MUTUALISTS AND GAINED NOVEL INTERACTIONS IN THE ALIEN COMMUNITY, THEIR ROLE DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN RANGES. CONSEQUENTLY, CLOSENESS CENTRALITY AND NORMALIZED DEGREE IN THE ALIEN RANGE WERE HIGHLY PREDICTABLE FROM THE NATIVE RANGE NETWORKS. MAIN CONCLUSIONS SPECIES WITH HIGH DEGREE AND CENTRALITY DEFINE THE CORE OF NESTED NETWORKS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CORE SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO ESTABLISH INTERACTIONS AND BE CORE SPECIES IN THE ALIEN RANGE, WHILST SPECIES WITH FEW INTERACTIONS IN THEIR NATIVE RANGE WILL BEHAVE SIMILARLY IN THEIR ALIEN RANGE.

SOCIOBIOL.,"THE PROGRESSION FROM SOLITARY LIVING TO CASTE-BASED SOCIALITY IS COMMONLY REGARDED AS A MAJOR EVOLUTIONARY TRANSITION. HOWEVER, IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN SHOWN THAT IN SOME TAXA, SOCIALITY MAY BE PLASTIC AND DEPENDENT ON LOCAL CONDITIONS. IF SOCIALITY CAN BE ENVIRONMENTALLY DRIVEN, THE QUESTION ARISES AS TO HOW PROJECTED CLIMATE CHANGE WILL INFLUENCE FEATURES OF SOCIAL ORGANISATION THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE OF MACROEVOLUTIONARY PROPORTIONS. DEPENDING ON THE TIME AVAILABLE IN SPRING DURING WHICH A FOUNDRESS CAN PRODUCE WORKER OFFSPRING, THE SWEAT BEE HALICTUS RUBICUNDUS IS EITHER SOCIAL OR SOLITARY. WE ANALYSED DETAILED FORAGING DATA IN RELATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS FOR GREAT BRITAIN TO ASSESS WHEN AND WHERE SWITCHES FROM A SOLITARY TO SOCIAL LIFESTYLE MAY BE EXPECTED. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WORKER NUMBERS SHOULD INCREASE THROUGHOUT GREAT BRITAIN UNDER PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS, AND IMPORTANTLY, THAT SOCIALITY SHOULD APPEAR IN NORTHERN AREAS WHERE IT HAS NEVER BEFORE BEEN OBSERVED. THIS DRAMATIC SHIFT IN SOCIAL ORGANISATION DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE SHOULD LEAD TO A BIGGER WORKFORCE BEING AVAILABLE FOR SUMMER POLLINATION AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS MITIGATING THE CURRENT POLLINATOR CRISIS. THE SWEAT BEE HALICTUS RUBICUNDUS IS SOCIALLY POLYMORPHIC, EXPRESSING BOTH SOLITARY AND SOCIAL FORMS, AND IS SOCIALLY PLASTIC, CAPABLE OF TRANSITIONING FROM SOLITARY TO SOCIAL FORMS, DEPENDING ON LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HERE, WE ANALYSE DETAILED FORAGING DATA IN RELATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE PREDICTIONS FOR GREAT BRITAIN TO SHOW THAT WORKER NUMBERS AND SOCIALITY BOTH INCREASE UNDER PREDICTED CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIOS. ESPECIALLY DRAMATIC WILL BE THE APPEARANCE OF SOCIAL H. RUBICUNDUS NESTS IN THE NORTH OF BRITAIN, WHERE PREVIOUSLY ONLY SOLITARY FORMS ARE FOUND.

IN ADDITION TO SURVIVAL AND GROWTH RATE, WE COMPARED REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS INCLUDING FLOWERING PHENOLOGY, PIGMENT PRODUCTION IN FLOWERS, POLLINATOR VISITING FREQUENCY, AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FLOWER, FRUIT AND SEED PRODUCTIONS) FOR 2 YEARS AT AUGMENTATION AND INTRODUCTION SITES. THE SURVIVAL RATE OF TRANSPLANTED PLANTS WAS 100 \% AFTER 2 YEARS AT BOTH SITES. THE INDIVIDUALS AT THE AUGMENTATION SITE GREW SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THOSE AT THE INTRODUCTION SITE (P < 0.05). TRANSPLANTED PLANTS AT THE AUGMENTATION SITE PRODUCED 26-28 FLOWERS PER PLANT PER YEAR, SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN DID THOSE AT THE INTRODUCTION SITE (35-38 FLOWERS) DURING THE 2-YEAR (2013-2014) OBSERVATION PERIOD (P < 0.05). THE CONTENT OF ANTHOCYANIN, A MAIN PIGMENT IN THE PETAL OF FLOWERS, AT THE INTRODUCTION SITE WAS LESS THAN THAT AT THE AUGMENTATION SITE. COMPOSITIONS OF THE POLLINATING SPECIES OF C.

POLLINATION OF DESERT MISTLETOE HAS NOT BEEN EXAMINED DESPITE THE SPECIES' RELIANCE ON INSECTS FOR TRANSPORTING POLLEN FROM MALE TO FEMALE PLANTS. I INVESTIGATED THE POLLINATION OF P. CALIFORNICUMN PARASITIZING ACACIA GREGGII (FABACEAE) SHRUBS AT 3 SITES AT DIFFERENT ELEVATIONS IN THE MOJAVE DESERT OF SOUTHERN NEVADA DURING FEBRUARY 2015. I EXAMINED POLLEN FROM MALE FLOWERS, ASPIRATED INSECTS LANDING ON FEMALE FLOWERS, AND COUNTED POLLEN GRAINS IN INSECT POLLEN LOADS. DESERT MISTLETOE'S TRICOLPATE POLLEN DIFFERED FROM A PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION BY BEING OBLATE INSTEAD OF SUBPROLATE IN EQUATORIAL VIEW. FEMALE FLOWERS WERE VISITED BY 13 SPECIES OF DIPTERA IN 10 GENERA AND 6 FAMILIES AND 3 SPECIES OF HYMENOPTERA IN 3 FAMILIES. ALMOST ALL (98.5\%) OF THE POLLEN CARRIED BY INSECTS WAS FROM DESERT MISTLETOE. FIVE SPECIES OF PHYTOPHAGOUS FRUIT FLIES IN TEPHRITIDAE WERE FREQUENTLY FOUND ON FLOWERS, COMPRISING 53\% OF THE INSECTS COLLECTED, BUT CARRIED LOW AMOUNTS OF P CALIFORNICUM POLLEN. TWO SPECIES OF BLOW FLIES IN CALLIPHORIDAE, BOTH LARVAL DECOMPOSERS OF ANIMALS, WERE ALSO RELATIVELY ABUNDANT ON FLOWERS AND CARRIED MODERATE TO HIGH POLLEN LOADS. FLIES IN SYRPHIDAE, 2 PREDATORS AND 1 PLANT-DECOMPOSER, CARRIED VARYING AMOUNTS OF CONSPECIFIC POLLEN. CONSPECIFIC POLLEN LOADS ALSO VARIED ON A SPECIES OF NATIVE BEE IN HALICTIDAE AND ON NATURALIZED HONEY BEES IN APIDAE. DESERT MISTLETOE APPEARS TO BE POLLINATED MOSTLY BY TEPHRITIDS, DUE TO THEIR ABUNDANCE ON FEMALE FLOWERS, AND BY CALLIPHORIDS. BLOW FLIES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY THAN FRUIT FLIES TO CARRY POLLEN BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE PLANTS ON DIFFERENT HOST SHRUBS DUE TO THEIR LARGER SIZE AND STRONGER FLIGHT.

ECOL.,"CONTEXT IN MODERN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, FRAGMENTATION OF PARTIAL HABITATS IS A SIGNIFICANT FILTER FOR MULTI-HABITAT USERS, REDUCING LOCAL TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY. THERE IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT SMALL SPECIES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE THAN LARGE SPECIES. THE IMPACT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION ON INTRASPECIFIC BODY-SIZE DISTRIBUTION, HOWEVER, IS YET UNEXPLORED. OBJECTIVES WE TESTED HABITAT FRAGMENTATION, A MAJOR DRIVER OF POLLINATOR LOSS, FOR ITS IMPACT ON INTRASPECIFIC BODY-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SOLITARY WILD-BEE SPECIES. SUBSEQUENTLY, WE TESTED INDIVIDUAL BODY SIZE FOR ITS IMPACT ON POLLINATION SERVICES. METHODS WE SAMPLED 1272 INDIVIDUALS OF THE FOUR MOST COMMON ANDRENA WILD BEE SPECIES IN 22 NEWLY ESTABLISHED FLOWERING FIELDS (0.21-0.41 HA) IN HESSEN, CENTRAL GERMANY, OVER TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS. STUDY SITES WERE LOCATED IN A CA. 80 HA LANDSCAPE CONTEXT OF INCREASING HABITAT FRAGMENTATION. WE ANALYSED THE POLLEN LOADS OF THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES. RESULTS BODY SIZE WITHIN LOCAL POPULATIONS OF THE TWO MEDIUM-SIZED BEES INCREASED WITH FRAGMENTATION, SUGGESTING INTRASPECIFIC SELECTION FOR HIGHER DISPERSAL CAPACITY. POLLEN ANALYSIS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MOST COMMON SPECIES REVEALED THAT LARGER INDIVIDUALS VISITED A SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER PLANT SPECTRUM. HABITAT FRAGMENTATION MAY THUS ALTER POLLINATION SERVICES WITHOUT NECESSARILY AFFECTING SPECIES RICHNESS OR COMPOSITION. CONCLUSIONS SYSTEMATIC BODY-SIZE VARIATION AT THE POPULATION LEVEL THUS EXPLAINS THE CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY BETWEEN SIMPLE COMMUNITY MEASURES AND ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING.

METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS THE BIG BUMBLEBEE DISCOVERY WAS A ONE-YEAR CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECT RUN BY A PARTNERSHIP OF EDF ENERGY, THE BRITISH SCIENCE ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTRE FOR ECOLOGY \& HYDROLOGY WHICH SOUGHT TO ASSESS THE INFLUENCE OF THE LANDSCAPE AT MULTIPLE SCALES ON THE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE OF BUMBLEBEES. TIMED COUNTS OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP., IDENTIFIED TO SIX COLOUR GROUPS) VISITING FOCAL PLANTS OF LAVENDER (LAVENDULA SPP.) WERE CARRIED OUT BY ABOUT 13 000 PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN (7-11 YEARS OLD) FROM OVER 4000 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UK. 3948 REPORTS WERE RECEIVED TOTALLING 26 868 BUMBLEBEES. WE FOUND THAT WHILE THE WIDER LANDSCAPE TYPE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON REPORTED BUMBLEBEE ABUNDANCE, THE LOCAL PROXIMITY TO FLOWERS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT (FEWER BUMBLEBEES WHERE OTHER FLOWERS WERE REPORTED TO BE >5M AWAY FROM THE FOCAL PLANT). HOWEVER, THE RATE OF MIS-IDENTIFCATION, REVEALED BY PHOTOGRAPHS UPLOADED BY PARTICIPANTS AND A PHOTO-BASED QUIZ, WAS HIGH. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE OUR CITIZEN SCIENCE RESULTS SUPPORT RECENT RESEARCH ON THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL FLOCAL RESOURCES ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE. TIMED COUNTS OF INSECTS VISITING A LURE PLANT IS POTENTIALLY AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR STANDARDISED POLLINATOR MONITORING, ENGAGING A LARGE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS WITH A SIMPLE PROTOCOL. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVELY HIGH RATE OF MIS-IDENTIFICATIONS (COMPARED TO REPORTS FROM PREVIOUS POLLINATOR CITIZEN SCIENCE PROJECTS) HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF INVESTING IN RESOURCES TO TRAIN VOLUNTEERS.

ELLIS CR;FELTHAM H;PARK K;HANLEY N;GOULSON D,ELLIS CR,SEASONAL COMPLEMENTARY IN POLLINATORS OF SOFT-FRUIT CROPS,BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,BASIC APPL. ECOL.,"UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS, AND THE FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY A DIVERSE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY, IS ESSENTIAL TO THE MAINTENANCE OF YIELDS IN THE 75\% OF OUR CROPS THAT BENEFIT FROM INSECT POLLINATION. WE DESCRIBE A FIELD STUDY AND POLLINATOR EXCLUSION EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON TWO SOFT-FRUIT CROPS IN A SYSTEM WITH BOTH WILD AND MANAGED POLLINATORS. WE TEST WHETHER FRUIT QUALITY AND QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY POLLINATION, AND WHETHER DIFFERENT POLLINATING INSECTS RESPOND DIFFERENTLY TO VARYING WEATHER CONDITIONS. BOTH STRAWBERRIES AND RASPBERRIES PRODUCED FEWER MARKETABLE FRUITS WHEN INSECTS WERE EXCLUDED, DEMONSTRATING DEPENDENCE ON INSECT POLLINATORS. RASPBERRIES HAD A SHORT FLOWERING SEASON WHICH COINCIDED WITH PEAK ABUNDANCE OF BEES, AND ATTRACTED MANY BEES PER FLOWER. IN CONTRAST, STRAWBERRIES HAD A MUCH LONGER FLOWERING SEASON AND APPEARED TO BE MUCH LESS ATTRACTIVE TO POLLINATORS, SO THAT ENSURING ADEQUATE POLLINATION IS LIKELY TO BE MORE CHALLENGING. THE PROPORTION OF HIGH-QUALITY STRAWBERRIES WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, SUGGESTING THAT YIELD WAS LIMITED BY INADEQUATE POLLINATION ON SOME FARMS. THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF DIFFERENT POLLINATOR TAXA VISITING STRAWBERRIES CHANGED MARKEDLY THROUGH THE SEASON, DEMONSTRATING SEASONAL COMPLEMENTARITY. INSECT VISITORS RESPONDED DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS SUGGESTING THAT DIVERSITY CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF POLLINATION SERVICE SHORTFALLS. FOR EXAMPLE, FLIES VISITED THE CROP FLOWERS IN POOR WEATHER AND AT THE END OF THE FLOWERING SEASON WHEN OTHER POLLINATORS WERE SCARCE, AND SO MAY PROVIDE A UNIQUE FUNCTIONAL CONTRIBUTION. UNDERSTANDING HOW DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLLINATOR GROUPS CAN ENHANCE POLLINATION SERVICES TO CROPS STRENGTHENS THE CASE FOR MULTIPLE SPECIES MANAGEMENT. WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE LINK BETWEEN INCREASED DIVERSITY AND FUNCTION IN REAL CROP SYSTEMS, HIGHLIGHTING THE RISKS OF REPLACING ALL POLLINATORS WITH MANAGED ALTERNATIVES.

EVOL.,"POLLINATORS ARE IN GLOBAL DECLINE AND AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDES ARE A POTENTIAL DRIVER OF THIS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PESTICIDES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BUMBLEBEE COLONIES-AN IMPORTANT AND DECLINING GROUP OF POLLINATORS. HERE, WE SHOW THAT COLONY-FOUNDING QUEENS, A CRITICAL YET VULNERABLE STAGE OF THE BUMBLEBEE LIFECYCLE, ARE LESS LIKELY TO INITIATE A COLONY AFTER EXPOSURE TO THIAMETHOXAM, A NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDE. BOMBUS TERRESTRIS QUEENS WERE EXPOSED TO FIELD-RELEVANT LEVELS OF THIAMETHOXAM AND TWO NATURAL STRESSORS: THE PARASITE CRITHIDIA BOMBI AND VARYING HIBERNATION DURATIONS. EXPOSURE TO THIAMETHOXAM CAUSED A 26\% REDUCTION IN THE PROPORTION OF QUEENS THAT LAID EGGS, AND ADVANCED THE TIMING OF COLONY INITIATION, ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT DETECT IMPACTS OF ANY EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT ON THE ABILITY OF QUEENS TO PRODUCE ADULT OFFSPRING DURING THE 14-WEEK EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD. AS EXPECTED FROM PREVIOUS STUDIES, THE HIBERNATION DURATION ALSO HAD AN IMPACT ON EGG LAYING, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION WITH INSECTICIDE TREATMENT. MODELLING THE IMPACTS OF A 26\% REDUCTION IN COLONY FOUNDING ON POPULATION DYNAMICS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF POPULATION EXTINCTION.

HOWEVER, WHETHER AND HOW FLORAL TRAITS ARE INVOLVED IN A MATING SYSTEM SHIFT REQUIRES FURTHER INVESTIGATION. A WIDELY DISTRIBUTED AND BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED LOUSEWORT, PEDICULARIS SIPHONANTHA D. DON WAS STUDIED. WE INVESTIGATED POLLINATION SYSTEMS, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, AND FLORAL TRAITS IN FOUR LARGE POPULATIONS GROWING FROM 3200M TO 4300M. POLLINATOR ACTIVITY IN LOW ALTITUDE POPULATIONS WAS LOWER AND THESE POPULATIONS HAD A DECREASED FRUIT SET AND SEED NUMBER PER CAPSULE COMPARED TO POPULATIONS AT HIGH ALTITUDES. SUPPLEMENTAL HAND POLLINATION WITH OUTCROSS POLLEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SEED PRODUCTION PER CAPSULE FOR PLANTS FROM HIGH ALTITUDES BUT NOT FOR THOSE FROM LOWER ALTITUDES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT BUMBLEBEES VISITED MORE FLOWERS WITHIN AN INFLORESCENCE IN A SINGLE FORAGING BOUT IN HIGH ALTITUDES COMPARED WITH LOW ALTITUDES, WHICH CAUSED A HIGH POSSIBILITY OF GEITONOGAMOUS MATING. THESE DIFFERENCES MAY BE POLLINATION-DEPENDENT RATHER THAN INHERITANCE-BASED BECAUSE HAND POLLINATION ON BAGGED FLOWERS DID NOT CAUSE A DIFFERENCE IN SEED PRODUCTION ACROSS POPULATIONS. COMPARED TO PLANTS FROM LOW ALTITUDES, HIGH-ALTITUDE PLANTS HAD INCREASED FLOWER LONGEVITY, LARGER FLORAL DISPLAYS, HIGHER POLLEN PRODUCTION PER FLOWER, AND SHORTER COROLLA TUBES, WHICH WERE FOUND TO BE WELL IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHANGES IN BOTH POLLINATION ENVIRONMENT AND MATING SYSTEM.

WITHIN THE APOCYNACEAE THE GENERA CEROPEGIA AND RIOCREUXIA TEMPORARILY TRAP FLIES, RELEASING THEM AFTER A FIXED, SPECIES-SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME, DURING WHICH POLLINATION AND/OR POLLEN REMOVAL OCCURS. THIS ``TRAP FLOWER POLLINATION SYSTEM SHOWS CONVERGENT EVOLUTION WITH UNRELATED SPECIES IN OTHER FAMILIES AND FASCINATED STEFAN VOGEL FOR MUCH OF HIS CAREER, LEADING TO GROUND-BREAKING WORK ON FLORAL FUNCTION IN CEROPEGIA( APOCYNACEAE). IN THIS NEW STUDY WE EXTEND THE WORK OF THE LATEST BROAD ANALYSIS PUBLISHED BY SOME OF THE AUTHORS (OLLERTON ET AL., 2009 - ANNALS OF BOTANY). THIS INCORPORATES PREVIOUSLY UNPUBLISHED DATA FROM INDIA AND AFRICA, AS WELL AS RECENTLY PUBLISHED INFORMATION, ON THE DIVERSITY OF POLLINATORS EXPLOITED BY CEROPEGIA. THE ANALYSES ARE BASED ON A MORE ACCURATE PHYLOGENETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE MAJOR GROUPS, AND SIGNIFICANTLY WIDENS THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC SCOPE OF OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FLY POLLINATION WITHIN CEROPEGIA. INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLLINATORS OF 69 TAXA (SPECIES, SUBSPECIES AND NATURAL VARIETIES) OF CEROPEGIA IS NOW AVAILABLE. TWENTY FIVE FAMILIES OF DIPTERA ARE KNOWN TO VISIT THE FLOWERS OF CEROPEGIA, OF WHICH SIXTEEN ARE CONFIRMED AS POLLINATORS. MOST TAXA ARE POLLINATED BY SPECIES FROM A SINGLE FAMILY. OVERALL, THERE WERE NO MAJOR BIOGEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES IN THE TYPES OF DIPTERA THAT WERE USED IN PARTICULAR REGIONS, THOUGH SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCES WERE APPARENT. LIKEWISE THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO MAJOR CLADES OF CEROPEGIA, BUT CLEAR DIFFERENCES WHEN COMPARING THE RANGE OF DIPTERA EXPLOITED BY CEROPEGIA WITH THAT OF THE STAPELIADS. THIS CLADE, ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE ASCLEPIADOIDEAE, IS A FASCINATING EXAMPLE OF A SPECIES RADIATION DRIVEN BY AN APPARENTLY RELATIVELY UNIFORM SET OF POLLINATORS. (C) 2017 ELSEVIER GMBH.

WHILE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF FOREST PROXIMITY AND FARM LEVEL MANAGEMENT ON POLLINATORS, FEW HAVE EXAMINED THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO SPATIAL SCALES. WE SURVEYED POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES WITHIN 18 SITES ON A LARGE ORGANIC FARM SURROUNDED BY NATIVE FOREST IN SOUTHERN COSTA RICA. WE SELECTED SITES 0, 50 AND 150 M FROM THE FOREST EDGE WITHIN SHADED AND SPARSELY-SHADED (SUN) PORTIONS OF THE FARM TO QUANTIFY THE INFLUENCE OF BOTH SHADE MANAGEMENT AND DISTANCE TO CONTIGUOUS FOREST ON POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. CONTRARY TO SIMILAR STUDIES, NATIVE BEES DOMINATED THE COMPOSITION OF POLLINATORS ON THIS FARM. OVERALL, POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND ACTIVITY DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY NEITHER BETWEEN THE SHADE MANAGEMENT TYPES NOR AMONG THE SITES 0, 50 OR 150 M FROM THE FOREST EDGE. HOWEVER, POLLINATOR DIVERSITY WAS FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT SUN SITES NEAR FOREST (0 M) COMPARED WITH FURTHER AWAY, WHEREAS THE DIVERSITY WAS THE SAME FOR THE SHADE SITES REGARDLESS OF FOREST PROXIMITY. WE FOUND THAT GREATER NUMBERS OF COFFEE FLOWERS WITHIN EACH SITE INCREASED BEE ABUNDANCE AND FLOWER VISITATION FREQUENCY. BEE ABUNDANCE WAS GREATER IN SITES WITH LESS GROUND COVER AND BEE DIVERSITY AND VISITATION FREQUENCIES WERE HIGHER IN SITES WITH GREATER AMOUNTS OF SHADE CANOPY COVER AND TREES IN FLOWER. BASED ON OUR RESULTS, WE SUGGEST INCLUDING FLOWERING SHADE TREES THAT PROVIDE HIGH LEVELS OF CANOPY COVER, MAINTAINING OR RE-ESTABLISHING FORESTED AREAS WITHIN OR SURROUNDING FARMS, AND ELIMINATING OR REDUCING AGROCHEMICAL USE TO INCREASE NATIVE POLLINATOR ACTIVITY AND DIVERSITY WITHIN COFFEE FARMS.",BEE DIVERSITY; COFFEE AGROFORESTRY; CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY; POLLINATION; ORGANIC FARMING; WILDLIFE HABITAT,AGROFORESTRY MANAGEMENT; TROPICAL FOREST; BEE COMMUNITIES; FRUIT-SET; DIVERSITY; HYMENOPTERA; CANEPHORA; INCREASES; CROPS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"CAUDILL, SA (REPRINT AUTHOR), SMITHSONIAN CONSERVAT BIOL INST, WASHINGTON, DC 20013 USA.;CAUDILL, S.

EVOL.,"HABITAT RESTORATION IS A KEY MEASURE TO COUNTERACT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY FROM HABITAT LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION. TO ASSESS SUCCESS IN RESTORING NOT ONLY BIODIVERSITY, BUT ALSO FUNCTIONALITY OF COMMUNITIES, WE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE RE-ASSEMBLY OF SPECIES TRAIT COMPOSITION ACROSS TAXA. ATTAINING SUCH FUNCTIONAL RESTORATION WOULD DEPEND ON THE LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, AND TIME SINCE RESTORATION. WE ASSESSED HOW TRAIT COMPOSITION OF PLANT AND POLLINATOR (BEE AND HOVERFLY) COMMUNITIES DIFFER BETWEEN ABANDONED, RESTORED (FORMERLY ABANDONED) OR CONTINUOUSLY GRAZED (INTACT) SEMI-NATURAL PASTURES. IN RESTORED PASTURES, WE ALSO EXPLORED TRAIT COMPOSITION IN RELATION TO LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, VEGETATION STRUCTURE, AND PASTURE MANAGEMENT HISTORY. ABANDONED PASTURES DIFFERED FROM INTACT AND RESTORED PASTURES IN TRAIT COMPOSITION OF PLANT COMMUNITIES, AND AS EXPECTED, HAD LOWER ABUNDANCES OF SPECIES WITH TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH GRAZING ADAPTATIONS. FURTHER, PLANT TRAIT COMPOSITION IN RESTORED PASTURES BECAME INCREASINGLY SIMILAR TO THAT IN INTACT PASTURES WITH INCREASING TIME SINCE RESTORATION. ON THE CONTRARY, THE TRAIT COMPOSITION OF POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES IN BOTH ABANDONED AND RESTORED PASTURES REMAINED SIMILAR TO INTACT PASTURES. THE TRAIT COMPOSITION FOR BOTH BEES AND HOVERFLIES WAS INFLUENCED BY FLOWER ABUNDANCE AND, FOR BEES, BY CONNECTIVITY TO OTHER INTACT GRASSLANDS IN THE LANDSCAPE. THE DIVERGENT RESPONSES ACROSS ORGANISM GROUPS APPEARED TO BE MAINLY RELATED TO THE LIMITED DISPERSAL ABILITY AND LONG INDIVIDUAL LIFE SPAN IN PLANTS, THE HIGH MOBILITY OF POLLINATORS, AND THE DEPENDENCY OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT FOR BEES. OUR RESULTS, ENCOMPASSING RESTORATION EFFECTS ON TRAIT COMPOSITION FOR MULTIPLE TAXA ALONG A GRADIENT IN BOTH TIME (TIME SINCE RESTORATION) AND SPACE (CONNECTIVITY), REVEAL HOW INTERACTING COMMUNITIES OF PLANTS AND POLLINATORS ARE SHAPED BY DIFFERENT TRAIT-ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONSHIPS.

EVOL.,"FLORAL TRAITS HAVE LARGELY BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO PHENOTYPIC SELECTION IN PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. HOWEVER, THE STRENGTH OF THIS LINK HAS RARELY BEEN ASCERTAINED WITH REAL POLLINATORS. WE CONDUCTED POLLINATOR OBSERVATIONS AND ESTIMATED SELECTION THROUGH FEMALE FITNESS ON FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND FLORAL TRAITS BETWEEN TWO PRIMULA SECUNDIFLORA POPULATIONS. WE QUANTIFIED POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION BY SUBTRACTING ESTIMATES OF SELECTION GRADIENTS OF PLANTS RECEIVING SUPPLEMENTAL HAND POLLINATION FROM THOSE OF PLANTS RECEIVING OPEN POLLINATION. THERE WAS NET DIRECTIONAL SELECTION FOR AN EARLIER FLOWERING START DATE AT POPULATIONS WHERE THE DOMINANT POLLINATORS WERE SYRPHID FLIES, AND FLOWERING PHENOLOGY WAS ALSO SUBJECTED TO STABILIZED QUADRATIC SELECTION. HOWEVER, A LATER FLOWERING START DATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY SELECTED AT POPULATIONS WHERE THE DOMINANT POLLINATORS WERE LEGITIMATE (NORMAL POLLINATION THROUGH THE COROLLA TUBE ENTRANCE) AND ILLEGITIMATE BUMBLEBEES (ABNORMAL POLLINATION THROUGH NECTAR ROBBING HOLE WHICH LOCATED AT THE COROLLA TUBE), AND FLOWERING PHENOLOGY WAS SUBJECTED TO DISRUPTIVE QUADRATIC SELECTION. WIDER COROLLA TUBE ENTRANCE DIAMETER WAS SELECTED AT BOTH POPULATIONS. FURTHERMORE, THE STRENGTH OF NET DIRECTIONAL SELECTION ON FLOWERING START DATE AND COROLLA TUBE ENTRANCE DIAMETER WAS STRONGER AT THE POPULATION WHERE THE DOMINANT POLLINATORS WERE SYRPHID FLIES. POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION EXPLAINED MOST OF THE BETWEEN-POPULATION VARIATIONS IN THE NET DIRECTIONAL SELECTION ON FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND COROLLA TUBE ENTRANCE DIAMETER. OUR RESULTS SUGGESTED THE IMPORTANT INFLUENCE OF POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION ON FLORAL EVOLUTION.

APPL. ECOL.,"1. FIELD-MARGIN DIVERSIFICATION THROUGH CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION OF HEDGEROWS IS BECOMING A PROMINENT INTERVENTION FOR PROMOTING BIODIVERSITY AND ASSOCIATED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, HOW INCREASING COVER OF HEDGEROWS IN THE LANDSCAPE CAN AFFECT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES HAS RARELY BEEN CONSIDERED. 2. HERE, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF INCREASED FIELD-MARGIN COMPLEXITY AT THE LOCAL SCALE AND INCREASING COVER OF HEDGEROWS IN THE LANDSCAPE ON THE PROVISION OF PEST CONTROL, WEED CONTROL AND POTENTIAL POLLINATION. LOCALLY, THREE TYPES OF FIELD MARGIN WERE COMPARED AS FOLLOWS: (I) STANDARD GRASS MARGIN, (II) SIMPLE HEDGEROW AND (III) COMPLEX HEDGEROW, ALONG TWO INDEPENDENT GRADIENTS OF HEDGEROW COVER AND ARABLE LAND COVER IN THE LANDSCAPE. WE PERFORMED AN EXCLUSION EXPERIMENT TO MEASURE BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF CEREAL APHIDS AND ASSESSED NATURAL ENEMY AND PEST ABUNDANCE IN THE FIELD. WE SAMPLED PLANT WEED COMMUNITIES AND PERFORMED A PHYTOMETER EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATORS ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. 3. AT THE LOCAL SCALE, PLANTING A NEW HEDGEROW OR IMPROVING ITS STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY AND VEGETATION DIVERSITY DID NOT ENHANCE THE DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN THE NEIGHBOURING FIELD. 4. HOWEVER, HIGH COVER OF HEDGEROWS IN THE LANDSCAPE ENHANCED APHID PARASITISM (FROM 12 TO 18\%) AND POTENTIAL POLLINATION (VISITATION RATE AND SEED SET INCREASED UP TO 70\%) IRRESPECTIVE OF LOCAL MARGIN QUALITY. THE COVER OF ARABLE LAND IN THE LANDSCAPE REDUCED THE ABUNDANCE OF PLANT-DWELLING PREDATORS AND WEED DIVERSITY, BUT DID NOT AFFECT THE DELIVERY OF THE INVESTIGATED ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. 5. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. OUR RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE KEY IMPORTANCE OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE CONTEXT, RATHER THAN LOCAL FACTORS, TO THE DELIVERY OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. THIS SUGGESTS A NEED FOR NEW POLICIES THAT PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE CONSERVATION OF HEDGEROWS AT LARGE SCALES FOR PROMOTING MULTIPLE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IN AGROECOSYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY, HEDGEROWS CAN SERVE TO DEVELOP A NETWORK OF ECOLOGICAL CORRIDORS THAT CAN FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF BENEFICIAL ORGANISMS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS AND NATURAL ENEMIES IN THE AGRICULTURAL MATRIX.

BOT.,"ECOLOGICALLY, THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PLANT AND POLLINATORS IS MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR THE SURVIVAL AND ADAPTABILITY. IT LEADS TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF FITNESS OF BOTH INTERACTING PARTNERS. BIRDS PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLES IN PLANT REPRODUCTION AND THE FITNESS OF ECOSYSTEM IN TROPICAL FOREST. THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO ANALYZE LEGITIMATE FLORAL VISITORS OF BOMBAX CEIBA LINN. IN TROPICAL FORESTS OF INDO-BURMA REGION OF INDIA IN RELATION TO POLLEN PRODUCTION AND MATING SYSTEM. THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED AT TWO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS, NAMELY BETHLEHEM VENGTHLANG (23 DEGREES 430'N LATITUDE AND 92 DEGREES 430'E LONGITUDE) AND TANHRIL (43 DEGREES 37'N LATITUDES AND 38 DEGREES 39'E LONGITUDES). BOTH STUDY SITES ARE LOCATED 30 KM APART FROM EACH OTHER. ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE POLLINATION IN B. CEIBA WAS MOSTLY CARRIED OUT BY THE BIRDS, AND THE FLOWERS WERE VISITED AND FORAGED BY THIRTEEN (13) SPECIES OF BIRDS BELONGING TO FIVE FAMILIES OF THE ORDER OF PASSERIFORMES. ONE SPECIES OF SQUIRREL (FUNAMBULUS SP.) WAS ALSO RECORDED VISITING THE FLOWERS OF B. CEIBA. STUDY ON MATING-SYSTEM EVALUATION REVEALED THAT THE B CEIBA IS AN OUTCROSSING TREE SPECIES, REQUIRING THE SERVICES OF ADEQUATE POLLINATORS FOR SUCCESSFUL POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS. HOWEVER, GEITONOGAMY WAS PARTLY FUNCTIONAL. THE INDEX OF SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY (ISI) VALUE EXPOSED THAT THE SPECIES IS MOSTLY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE. ALL THE SPECIES OF BIRDS WERE EFFICIENT POLLINATORS FOR B. CEIBA IN THE PRESENT STUDY SITES. THE FRUIT AND SEED SETS FOLLOWING NATURAL POLLINATION ARE FAIRLY HIGH COMPARED WITH OTHER BIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES. HIGH POLLEN-PRODUCTION CAPACITIES PER FLOWER AND PER TREE ALONG WITH THE HIGH VISITATION OF BIRD POLLINATORS WOULD HAVE PROMOTED THE MAXIMUM REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN B. CEIBA. THIS ALSO DEPICTS THAT THE SPECIES DOES NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM OF POLLEN AND RESOURCE LIMITATIONS IN INDO-BURMA REGION OF NORTH-EAST INDIA. B.

HUEY S;NIEH JC,HUEY S,FORAGING AT A SAFE DISTANCE: CRAB SPIDER EFFECTS ON POLLINATORS,ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,ECOL. ENTOMOL.,"1. THE ABILITY OF POLLINATING INSECTS TO DISCOVER AND EVADE THEIR PREDATORS CAN AFFECT PLANT-POLLINATOR MUTUALISMS AND HAVE CASCADING ECOSYSTEM EFFECTS. POLLINATORS WILL AVOID FLOWERS WITH PREDATORS, BUT IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW FAR AWAY THEY WILL MOVE TO CONTINUE FORAGING. IF THESE DISTANCES ARE RELATIVELY SMALL, THE IMPACT OF PREDATORS ON THE PLANT-POLLINATOR MUTUALISM MAY BE LESSENED. THE PLANT COULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE SOME POLLINATION, AND POLLINATORS WOULD REDUCE THE TIME AND ENERGY NEEDED TO SEARCH FOR ANOTHER PATCH. 2. A NATIVE CRAB SPIDER, XYSTICUS ELEGANS, WAS PLACED ON ONE CLUSTER IN A SMALL ARRAY OF BACCHARIS PILULARIS INFLORESCENCE CLUSTERS, AND THE PREFERRED SHORT-RANGE FORAGING DISTANCES OF NATURALLY VISITING POLLINATORS WAS DETERMINED. 3. NEARLY ALL POLLINATOR TAXA (HONEY BEES, WASPS, OTHER HYMENOPTERA, AND NON-BOMBYLIID FLIES) SPENT LESS TIME FORAGING ON THE PREDATOR CLUSTER. 4. THE KEY RESULT OF THIS STUDY IS THAT INFLORESCENCES WITHIN 90 MM OF THE CRAB SPIDER WERE AVOIDED BY VISITING HONEY BEES AND WASPS, WHICH SPENT THREE-AND 18-FOLD MORE TIME, RESPECTIVELY, FORAGING ON MORE DISTANT FLOWER CLUSTERS. 5.

CRAB SPIDERS REFLECT ULTRAVIOLET (UV) LIGHT, AMBUSH POLLINATORS ON FLOWERS, AND MANIPULATE FLOWER UV SIGNALS ALTERING THE BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE OF PREY. WHEREAS CRAB SPIDERS TYPICALLY DEPEND ON FLOWERS TO FORAGE, ADULT EPICADUS HETEROGASTER DEPARTS FROM THIS STANDARD BEHAVIOR BY PREYING ON POLLINATORS UPON GREEN LEAVES, EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF FLOWERS NEARBY. THIS SPECIES HAS A CONSPICUOUS ABDOMEN RESEMBLING THE SHAPE OF A FLOWER, WHICH MAY REFLECT UV SIGNALS SIMILAR TO THAT OF FLOWERS, AND THUS ATTRACT POLLINATORS. NEVERTHELESS, NO EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE THAT E. HETEROGASTER FORAGING ON LEAVES MIMICS FLOWERS, NOR HOW THIS CRAB SPIDER INTERACTS WITH ITS PREY.

IS A MAJOR CROP IN TEMPERATE REGIONS AND PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF NUTRITION TO MANY OF THE YIELD-ENHANCING INSECT FLOWER VISITORS THAT CONSUME FLORAL NECTAR. THE MANIPULATION OF MECHANISMS THAT CONTROL VARIOUS CROP PLANT TRAITS FOR THE BENEFIT OF POLLINATORS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED IN THE BID TO INCREASE FOOD SECURITY, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT INHERENT FLORAL TRAIT EXPRESSION IN CONTEMPORARY OSR VARIETIES OR THE BREEDING SYSTEMS USED IN OSR BREEDING PROGRAMMES. WE STUDIED A RANGE OF FLORAL TRAITS IN GLASSHOUSE-GROWN, CERTIFIED CONVENTIONAL VARIETIES OF WINTER OSR TO TEST FOR VARIATION AMONG AND WITHIN BREEDING SYSTEMS. WE MEASURED 24-H NECTAR SECRETION RATE, AMOUNT, CONCENTRATION AND RATIO OF NECTAR SUGARS PER FLOWER, AND SIZES AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS PRODUCED PER PLANT FROM 24 VARIETIES OF OSR REPRESENTING OPEN-POLLINATED (OP), GENIC MALE STERILITY (GMS) HYBRID AND CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILITY (CMS) HYBRID BREEDING SYSTEMS. SUGAR CONCENTRATION WAS CONSISTENT AMONG AND WITHIN THE BREEDING SYSTEMS, HOWEVER, GMS HYBRIDS PRODUCED MORE NECTAR AND MORE SUGAR PER FLOWER THAN CMS HYBRID OR OP VARIETIES. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF RATIO OF FRUCTOSE/GLUCOSE IN OP VARIETIES, WE FOUND THAT NECTAR TRAITS WERE CONSISTENT WITHIN ALL THE BREEDING SYSTEMS. WHEN SCALED, GMS HYBRIDS PRODUCED 1.73 TIMES MORE NECTAR RESOURCE PER PLANT THAN OP VARIETIES. NECTAR PRODUCTION AND AMOUNT OF NECTAR SUGAR IN OSR PLANTS WERE INDEPENDENT OF NUMBER AND SIZE OF FLOWERS. OUR DATA SHOW THAT FLORAL TRAITS OF GLASSHOUSE-GROWN OSR DIFFERED AMONG BREEDING SYSTEMS, SUGGESTING THAT MANIPULATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF NECTAR REWARDS FOR INSECT FLOWER VISITORS, INCLUDING POLLINATORS, COULD BE INCLUDED IN FUTURE OSR BREEDING PROGRAMMES.",CANOLA; CYTOPLASMIC MALE STERILITY; FLORAL TRAITS; GENIC MALE STERILITY; HYBRIDS; NECTAR; OPEN-POLLINATED; POLLINATOR DECLINES; RAPESEED; SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION,NECTAR SUGAR CONTENT; LANDSCAPE-SCALE; PHLOEM TRANSPORT; MALE-STERILITY; FLOWER SIZE; BUMBLE BEES; SECRETION; CROPS; PLANTS; FIELD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"HAUGHTON, AJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROTHAMSTED RES, WEST COMMON, HARPENDEN AL5 2JQ, HERTS, ENGLAND.;CARRUTHERS, JONATHAN M., COOK, SAMANTHA M., CLARK, SUZANNE J., SWAIN, JENNIFER L., HAUGHTON, ALISON J., ROTHAMSTED RES, WEST COMMON, HARPENDEN AL5 2JQ, HERTS, ENGLAND.;CARRUTHERS, JONATHAN M., ROYAL SOC BIOL, CHARLES DARWIN HOUSE,12 ROGER ST, LONDON WC1N 2JU, ENGLAND.;WRIGHT, GERALDINE A., NEWCASTLE UNIV, INST NEUROSCI, CTR BEHAV \& EVOLUT, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.;OSBORNE, JULIET L., UNIV EXETER, ENVIRONM \& SUSTAINABIL INST, PENRYN CAMPUS, PENRYN TR10 9FE, CORNWALL, ENGLAND.",10.1111/GCBB.12438,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,"BBSRCBIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBSRC); INSECT POLLINATORS INITIATIVE GRANT [BB/I000968/1]; NERCNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL; WELLCOME TRUSTWELLCOME TRUST; DEFRADEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT, FOOD \& RURAL AFFAIRS (DEFRA); SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT; HIGH WYCOMBE BEEKEEPERS' ASSOCIATION; BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBSRC) OF THE UKBIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (BBSRC)","WE THANK ROTHAMSTED GLASSHOUSE STAFF FOR CULTIVATING THE OSR PLANTS, AND EILEEN POWER AND DAN STABLER FOR HELP WITH THE HPLC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NEWCASTLE.

LOSS OF AN IMPORTANT POLLINATOR IS OFTEN ASSUMED TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLLEN RECEIVED BY STIGMAS OF A FOCAL SPECIES (POLLINATION SUCCESS), YET THIS ASSUMPTION HAS RARELY BEEN TESTED EXPERIMENTALLY. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EFFECT, IF ANY, MAY DEPEND ON THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE REMAINING POLLINATORS, AND ON WHETHER THE LOSS OF ONE POLLINATOR LEADS TO CHANGES IN VISITATION PATTERNS BY OTHER POLLINATORS. TO EXPLORE HOW A CHANGE IN POLLINATOR COMPOSITION INFLUENCES POLLINATION OF ASCLEPIAS VERTICILLATA, WE EXCLUDED BUMBLE BEES FROM PLOTS IN LARGE AND SMALL POPULATIONS OF THIS MILKWEED SPECIES. WE THEN QUANTIFIED POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES, POLLEN EXPORT AND POLLEN RECEIPT FOR CONTROL PLOTS AND FOR PLOTS WHERE BUMBLE BEES WERE EXPERIMENTALLY EXCLUDED. WE FOUND THAT EXCLUSION OF BUMBLE BEES DID NOT REDUCE POLLEN RECEIPT BY A. VERTICILLATA FLOWERS. VISITATION BY POLISTES WASPS INCREASED MARKEDLY FOLLOWING BUMBLE BEE EXCLUSION, BOTH IN SMALL POPULATIONS (186\% INCREASE) AND IN LARGE POPULATIONS (400\% INCREASE). BECAUSE POLISTES WASPS WERE AS EFFICIENT AS BUMBLE BEES AT POLLEN TRANSFER, INCREASED WASP VISITATION OFFSET LOST BUMBLE BEE POLLINATION SERVICES.

FOR THE GENUS ANARTHROPHYLLUM, WHICH IS DISTRIBUTED IN ARID AND SEMI-ARID REGIONS OF PATAGONIA, WE ASSESSED HOW THESE FACTORS AFFECTED SPECIES DIVERSIFICATION AND RECONSTRUCTED ITS POSSIBLE BIOGEOGRAPHIC HISTORY IN SOUTH AMERICAN ARID ENVIRONMENTS. SEQUENCES WERE OBTAINED FROM TWO MOLECULAR MARKERS: THE ITS NUCLEAR REGION AND THE TRNS-TRNG PLASTID REGION. USING PARSIMONY, MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD AND BAYESIAN INFERENCE INDIVIDUAL GENE TREES WERE RECONSTRUCTED, AND A SPECIES TREE WAS OBTAINED USING MULTI-SPECIES COALESCENT ANALYSIS. DIVERGENCE TIMES AMONG SPECIES WERE ESTIMATED USING SECONDARY CALIBRATIONS. FLEXIBLE BAYESIAN MODELS AND STOCHASTIC CHARACTER MAPPING WERE USED TO ELUCIDATE ANCESTRAL GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE FLORAL AND VEGETATIVE PHENOTYPES IN THE GENUS. GENE TREES AND SPECIES TREE ANALYSES STRONGLY SUPPORT ANARTHROPHYLLUM AS MONOPHYLETIC, ALL ANALYSES CONSISTENTLY RETRIEVED THREE WELL-SUPPORTED MAIN CLADES: HIGH ANDEAN CLADE, PATAGONIAN CLADE 1, AND PATAGONIAN CLADE 2. MAIN DIVERSIFICATION EVENTS OCCURRED CONCOMITANT WITH THE ANDEAN UPLIFT AND STEPPE ARIDIZATION, THE ANDEAN MOUNTAIN RANGE POSSIBLY ACTED AS A SPECIES BARRIER FOR THE HIGH ANDEAN CLADE. VEGETATIVE TRAITS SHOWED ADAPTATIONS TO HARSH CLIMATES IN SOME CLADES, WHILE POLLINATOR-RELATED FLORAL FEATURES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INDEPENDENT DIVERSIFICATION IN BEE- AND BIRD-POLLINATED CLADES WITHIN BOTH PATAGONIAN CLADES.

GRAY M;STANSBERRY MJ;LYNN JS;WILLIAMS CF;WHITE TE;WHITNEY KD,GRAY M,CONSISTENT SHIFTS IN POLLINATOR-RELEVANT FLORAL COLORATION ALONG ROCKY MOUNTAIN ELEVATION GRADIENTS,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1. FLORAL COLOUR IS A FUNDAMENTAL SIGNAL THAT SHAPES PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. DESPITE THEORETICAL REASONS WHY FLORAL COLOURS MIGHT SHIFT IN REPRESENTATION ALONG BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC GRADIENTS, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED COMMUNITY-LEVEL SHIFTS IN COLOUR, AND EVEN FEWER SIGNIFICANT PATTERNS HAVE BEEN DETECTED. 2. WE EXAMINED FLORAL COLOUR ON SIX REPLICATED TRANSECTS SPANNING 1,300 M IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS OF COLORADO, USA. ALONG THESE TRANSECTS, THERE IS A HYPOTHESIZED SHIFT FROM BEE-DOMINATED TO FLY-DOMINATED POLLINATION WITH INCREASING ELEVATION. THE REFLECTANCE OF FLOWERS OF 110 FORB AND SHRUB SPECIES WAS MEASURED USING A SPECTROPHOTOMETER, AND WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THREE COMPONENTS OF COLOUR (HUE, SATURATION AND BRIGHTNESS) IN RELEVANT POLLINATOR VISUAL SPACES. PERCENT COVER DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 67 SITES AND USED TO OBTAIN COMMUNITY-WEIGHTED MEAN (CWM) ESTIMATES OF FLORAL COLOUR. 3. WE FOUND STRONG PATTERNS OF ELEVATIONAL CHANGE IN FLORAL COLOUR. REFLECTANCE CWM OF SHORTER WAVELENGTHS (UVB THROUGH HUMAN BLUE, 300-500 NM) GENERALLY DECREASED LINEARLY WITH ELEVATION, WHILE REFLECTANCE CWM OF LONGER WAVELENGTHS (HUMAN GREEN THROUGH RED, 500-700 NM) SHOWED HUMP-SHAPED PATTERNS WITH HIGHEST REFLECTANCE AT INTERMEDIATE ELEVATIONS. WITH RESPECT TO POLLINATORS, SATURATION CWM INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH ELEVATION IN BOTH BEE AND FLY VISUAL SPACES, WHILE BRIGHTNESS CONTRAST CWM SHOWED A HUMP-SHAPED PATTERN IN BEE SPACE AND A DECLINE WITH ELEVATION IN FLY VISUAL SPACE. FOR HUE, COVER OF SPECIES PERCEIVED AS BEE-BLUE DECLINED WITH ELEVATION, WHILE COVER OF BEE-UV-GREEN SPECIES SHOWED A HUMP-SHAPED PATTERN. IN COMPARISON, WE DETECTED NO ELEVATIONAL SHIFTS IN FLORAL HUES AS PERCEIVED BY FLIES. 4. SYNTHESIS. HUE PATTERNS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BEE POLLINATORS HAVE SHAPED THE GEOGRAPHY OF FLORAL COLOUR. THE ROLES OF FLY POLLINATORS AND OF ABIOTIC DRIVERS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO INFER, ALTHOUGH THE DROP IN FLORAL BRIGHTNESS AT HIGH ELEVATIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREDICTIONS THAT LOW TEMPERATURES AND MORE INTENSE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION SHOULD FAVOUR INCREASED PIGMENT CONCENTRATIONS THERE. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT FLORAL COLOUR CAN BE DYNAMIC YET PREDICTABLE ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE, A PATTERN THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO TEASE APART THE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY DRIVERS OF THIS IMPORTANT PLANT TRAIT.",BEE VISION; ECOLOGICAL FILTERING; FLY VISION; NATURAL SELECTION; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; REFLECTANCE SPECTRA; SIGNALLING; ULTRAVIOLET,FLOWER-COLOR; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DISCRIMINATION; BUMBLEBEES; SIGNALS; BEES; FLY; PREFERENCES; HERBIVORES; EVOLUTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA.;GRAY, MICHELLE, STANSBERRY, MARCUS J., LYNN, JOSHUA S., WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., WHITNEY, KENNETH D., ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA.;LYNN, JOSHUA S., WHITNEY, KENNETH D., UNIV NEW MEXICO, DEPT BIOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM 87131 USA.;WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., IDAHO STATE UNIV, DEPT BIOL SCI, POCATELLO, ID 83209 USA.;WILLIAMS, CHARLES F., IDAHO MUSEUM NAT HIST, RAY J DAVIS HERBARIUM, POCATELLO, ID USA.;WHITE, THOMAS E., UNIV SYDNEY, SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.",10.1111/1365-2745.12948,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGYNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF)NSF - DIRECTORATE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES (BIO) [1257965],"DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: 1257965",0022-0477,5,1910-1924,WILEY,106,2018,ISI000452178600013,65,"PLANT SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",25,"PLANT SCIENCES, ECOLOGY",WHITNEYKUNM.EDU,HD0DT,"WHITNEY, KD (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROCKY MT BIOL LABS, CRESTED BUTTE, CO 81224 USA",ISI,none,ROCKY MT BIOL LABS;UNIV NEW MEXICO;IDAHO STATE UNIV;UNIV SYDNEY,ROCKY MT BIOL LABS,NA,"GRAY M, 2018, J ECOL","GRAY M, 2018, J ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

THEREFORE, WE ASSESSED THE RICHNESS, ABUNDANCE, AND TROPHIC INTERACTIONS OF TRAP-NESTING HYMENOPTERA AND THEIR PARASITES AT FOUR PATCHES OF RESTORED RIPARIAN FOREST AND AT ONE REFERENCE NATURAL FRAGMENT, OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND AGES, LOCATED AT THE VOLTA GRANDE RESERVOIR, IN MINAS GERAIS AND SO PAULO STATES TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) DOES THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES AND WASPS DIFFER IN RIPARIAN FOREST FRAGMENTS ACCORDING TO THE SEASONAL PERIODS? (2) DOES THE COMPOSITION OF CAVITY-NESTING BEES AND WASPS VARY AMONG RESTORATION AND REFERENCE SITES AND BETWEEN CLIMATE SEASONS (WET AND DRY)? (3) HOW DO THE DEGREES OF SPECIALIZATION OF THE PARASITES VARY AMONG THE PATCHES OF FOREST? WE RECORDED 12 SPECIES OF WASPS, EIGHT OF BEES, AND NINE SPECIES OF PARASITES. AREAS WITH LONGER TIME SINCE RESTORATION (REFERENCE SITE) SHOWED HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS. HOWEVER, THE ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHER IN MOST RECENT AREAS. THE COMPOSITION OF BEE AND WASP ASSEMBLY HAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED BETWEEN THE CLIMATE SEASONS, ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN SAMPLING AREAS. THE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE WERE HIGHER IN WARMER AND RAINY PERIODS. THE RATE OF BEE AND WASP MORTALITY WAS HIGH. THE DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION OF PARASITES VARIES AMONG SAMPLING UNITS, AND THE NETWORK OF HOST-PARASITE INTERACTION HAS A MODULAR CONFIGURATION WITH GENERALISTS AND SPECIALISTS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE RESTORED AREAS WITH MORE COMPLEX HABITAT COULD PROVIDE BETTER CONDITIONS FOR THE REESTABLISHMENT OF ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS AMONG THESE INSECTS, THE LOCAL FLORA, AND OTHER INVERTEBRATES, WHICH TOGETHER CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE RESTORED ENVIRONMENTS.",BEES; WASPS; PARASITES; CERRADO,BEES HYMENOPTERA; SOLITARY WASPS; TROPHIC INTERACTIONS; SAO-PAULO; DIVERSITY; ACULEATA; COMMUNITIES; POLLINATION; NESTEDNESS; OCCUPATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"ANTONINI, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FED OURO PRETO, LAB BIODIVERSIDADE, DEBIO, ICEB, CAMPUS MORRO DO CRUZEIRO S-N, BR-35400000 OURO PRETO, MG, BRAZIL.;ARAUJO, G.

INFORMATION ON ELAIOPHORE LOCATION, STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING IS LIKELY TO PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO POLLINATION ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF THE FAMILY. WE CHARACTERIZED THE ELAIOPHORES IN THREE MALPIGHIACEAE SPECIES AND COMPARED THE PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION AND DIMENSIONS OF THESE GLANDS, THEIR STRUCTURAL ORGANIZATION, THEIR HISTOCHEMISTRY AND THEIR LIFE SPANS. INTACT ELAIOPHORES FROM BUDS AND 1-DAY FLOWERS (BAGGED AND UN-BAGGED) OF BANISTERIOPSIS VARIABILIS, BYRSONIMA COCCOLOBIFOLIA AND PEIXOTOA RETICULATA WERE COLLECTED FOR STRUCTURAL, HISTOCHEMICAL AND ULTRASTRUCTURAL STUDIES. WE ALSO REPORTED THE BEHAVIOR OF ELAIOPHORE-VISITING INSECTS. ELAIOPHORES EXHIBIT UNISERIATE SECRETORY EPITHELIUM COVERED BY A THICK CUTICLE AND VASCULARIZED PARENCHYMA. THE SECRETORY SURFACES CAN BE FLAT (B. COCCOLOBIFOLIA AND P. RETICULATA) OR CONVOLUTED (B. VARIABILIS). IN B. VARIABILIS AND P. RETICULATA THE EPITHELIUM HAS LONGER CELLS THAN IN B.

ECOL. CONSERV.,"IF AN ORGANISM BECOMES RARE ENOUGH THAT IT NO LONGER PARTICIPATES IN CERTAIN INTERSPECIFIC INTERACTIONS, IT CAN BE SAID TO HAVE BECOME ECOLOGICALLY EXTINCT, EVEN THOUGH IT IS STILL PRESENT. THIS FORM OF EXTINCTION IS MUCH LESS RECOGNIZED THAN GLOBAL EXTINCTIONS, ALTHOUGH IT MAY HAVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITY FUNCTION. HERE, WE DESCRIBE A CASE OF POSSIBLE OR PENDING ECOLOGICAL EXTINCTION OF AN ENDEMIC HAWAIIAN PLANT. WE PERFORMED OVER 120 H OF SYSTEMATIC FLOWER VISITATION OBSERVATIONS OF THE ENDANGERED HAWAIIAN MINT, STENOGYNE ANGUSTIFOLIA, IN ITS WILD HABITAT. THE ROBUST SIZE AND OPEN SHAPE OF S. ANGUSTIFOLIA FLOWERS, ALONG WITH THEIR HIGH ACCESSIBILITY, VISIBILITY, AND NECTAR CONTENT, SUGGEST THAT THEY ARE ADAPTED TO ANIMAL-MEDIATED POLLINATION. HOWEVER, ONLY ONE FLOWER VISITOR WAS OBSERVED AT OUR FOCAL HIGH-ELEVATION STUDY SITE: AN INDIVIDUAL OF THE NON-NATIVE BEE SPECIES LASIOGLOSSUM IMPAVIDUM. EXPERIMENTAL POLLINATION TREATMENTS INDICATE THAT S. ANGUSTIFOLIA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE AND DEMONSTRATES SOME AUTOGAMY, SETTING FRUIT AND SEED IN THE ABSENCE OF POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENTAL ADDITIONS OF POLLEN INCREASED FRUIT PRODUCTION, INDICATING THAT PLANTS ARE POLLEN-LIMITED AND THAT LACK OF POLLINATORS CARRIES A REPRODUCTIVE COST FOR THIS SPECIES. ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT HAWAII ARE HIGHLY MODIFIED, AND THE DISTRIBUTION AND DIVERSITY OF THE NATIVE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY THAT OCCURRED WITH S. ANGUSTIFOLIA PRIOR TO THESE CHANGES ARE WHOLLY UNKNOWN. NEVERTHELESS, THE LACK OF VISITATION BY NATIVE POLLINATORS AND EXTREMELY RARE VISITATION BY NON-NATIVE POLLINATORS SUGGEST THAT THIS PLANT IS TODAY CONTRIBUTING LITTLE TO POLLINATION NETWORKS IN ITS HIGH-ELEVATION HABITAT.

PLANT, FLOWER (INCLUDING DETAILS OF COLUMN AND POLLINARIUM) AND FRUIT FEATURES ARE HERE ILLUSTRATED AND DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. OVERALL, PLANT AND FLOWER FEATURES ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE WIDESPREAD PATAGONIAN C. LESSONII. YET, BOTH SPECIES CAN BE SEPARATED BY A NUMBER OF VEGETATIVE AND FLORAL FEATURES. FEMALE AUGOCHLORINE HALICTIDAE BEES WERE RECORDED AS POLLINATORS. FRUITS MATURE QUICKLY (15-19DAYS AFTER POLLINATION). PLANTS WITHER BY MIDDLE OCTOBER, RESTING UNDERGROUND AS VERY SMALL (3-5MM DIAMETER) ROUNDISH TUBERS. THE TWO NEWLY FOUND POPULATIONS ARE IN PRIVATELY OWNED AREAS AND PRONE TO BOTH FIRE AND CATTLE GRAZING. DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF EACH POPULATION (ESTIMATED IN LESS THAN 200 INDIVIDUALS), IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS SPECIES WOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED AS CR (CRITICALLY ENDANGERED) WHEN FORMALLY AND PROPERLY SURVEYED UNDER THE IUCN CRITERIA.

WE MEASURED POLLINATION SERVICES (POLLEN DELIVERY TO STIGMA) PROVIDED BY WILD INSECTS TO A MASS FLOWERING CROP, PAK CHOI BRASSICA RAPA AT 12 SITES ACROSS A GRADIENT OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL LAND USE (AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION) IN NEW ZEALAND. 3. WE FOUND THAT POLLINATION SERVICES INCREASED AS THE PROPORTION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE INCREASED, POLLINATION FROM EXOTIC SPECIES EXCEEDED THE LOSS OF POLLINATION FROM NATIVE SPECIES. HOWEVER, POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERY BECAME INCREASINGLY DOMINATED BY A FEW EXOTIC FLY SPECIES THAT WERE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE DAY, COMPARED TO NATIVE SPECIES, WHICH HAD MORE CONSTRAINED - ACTIVITY PATTERNS. 4. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE CONTINUED SUFFICIENT CROP POLLINATION IS TO PROTECT AND RESTORE DIVERSE NATURAL HABITATS ON OR AROUND FARMS, AS SPECIES-RICH POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES ARE RELATIVELY RESILIENT TO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. HOWEVER, WE SHOW THAT WHERE HUMAN-DRIVEN DISTURBANCE HAS CAUSED LOSS OF NATIVE POLLINATOR SPECIES, EXOTIC POLLINATORS CAN MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT POLLINATION. THEREFORE, IN AREAS WHERE NATIVE SPECIES LOSS CANNOT EASILY BE REVERSED, DECISIONS ABOUT PESTICIDE USE AND HABITAT PROVISION THAT FOSTER POPULATIONS OF BENEFICIAL EXOTIC SPECIES ARE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN POLLINATION SERVICE DELIVERY, AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.

J. ENTOMOL.,"BRAZILIAN NATIVE MELIPONINES ARE CURRENTLY THREATENED BY INCREASED HUMAN IMPACTS. THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR GENETIC VARIATION BY MICROSATELLITE DNA MARKERS CAN ASSIST IN THE CONSERVATION OF POPULATIONS AND HELP IN THE PLANNING AND ESTABLISHMENT OF EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP THE FIRST SET OF MICROSATELLITE MARKERS FOR MELIPONA FASCICULATA, SELECTED FROM PARTIAL GENOME ASSEMBLY OF ILLUMINA PAIRED-END READS. PRIMER PAIRS WERE DESIGNED FOR EACH DETECTED LOCUS AT THEIR FLANKING REGIONS. BEE SAMPLES WERE GENOTYPED FROM TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OF NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL FOR MARKER CHARACTERIZATION AND VALIDATION. A TOTAL OF 17 MICROSATELLITE LOCI DISPLAYED POLYMORPHISM. MEAN H-E AND H(O )HETEROZYGOSITIES WERE 0.453 AND 0.536, RESPECTIVELY. PIC ACROSS ALL LOCI RANGED FROM 0.108 TO 0.714. A GENETIC DIVERSITY ANALYSIS REVEALED HIGH VALUES FOR POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION ESTIMATES (F-ST=0.194, R-ST=0.230, AND D-EST = 0.162) WITHIN THE INVESTIGATED REGION. PCOA AND BAYESIAN CLUSTERING SHOWED A SEPARATION OF THE SPECIES INTO TWO DISTINCT CLUSTERS. THESE MICROSATELLITE MARKERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED STRONG POTENTIAL FOR POPULATION-LEVEL GENETIC STUDIES.

LONGITUDINAL STUDIES, HOWEVER, ARE NECESSARY FOR DETECTING LONGTERM RESPONSES TO HABITAT RESTORATION AND FOR UNDERSTANDING ANNUAL DEMOGRAPHIC VARIATION. 2. TO INVESTIGATE THE TIME COURSE OF BEE COMMUNITY RESTORATION IN SITES PREVIOUSLY MADE UNINHABITABLE BY ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE, WE STUDIED A FORMER LANDFILL SITE FOR 10 YEARS FROM INITIAL REVEGETATION IN 2003 UNTIL 2013, COMPARING TWO RESTORED SITES WITH THREE NEARBY, UNDISTURBED CONTROL SITES. WE USED PERMUTATIONAL MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND GENERALISED ADDITIVE MIXED MODELS TO INVESTIGATE HOW BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS VARIED OVER TIME (YEARS), BETWEEN SEASONS AND BETWEEN RESTORATION LEVELS. 3. LANDFILL RESTORATION AND THE CREATION OF FORAGING AND NESTING HABITAT RESULTED IN RAPID AND PERSISTENT OCCUPATION BY BEES, SUGGESTING THAT EFFORTS TO RESTORE BEE COMMUNITIES CAN BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN A SOURCE OF COLONISTS EXISTS NEARBY. 4. BASED ON EARLIER STUDIES, WE PREDICTED THAT IN RESTORED SITES THERE WOULD BE AN INITIAL RAPID INCREASE IN BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, FOLLOWED BY A DECLINE TO A STABLE INTERMEDIATE LEVEL. THIS PREDICTION WAS SUPPORTED AS BEE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS IN RESTORED SITES INCREASED UNTIL 2006/2007 AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECLINED. 5. IN CONTROL SITES, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OVER TIME, DESPITE A LACK OF ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCE.

BOT.,"WHILE THERE IS INCREASING RECOGNITION OF BATESIAN FLORAL MIMICRY IN PLANTS, THERE ARE FEW CONFIRMED CASES WHERE MIMICRY INVOLVES MORE THAN ONE MODEL SPECIES. HERE, WE TEST FOR POLLINATION BY MIMICRY IN DIURIS (ORCHIDACEAE), A GENUS HYPOTHESIZED TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS VIA MIMICRY OF A RANGE OF CO-OCCURRING PEA PLANTS (FABOIDEAE). OBSERVATIONS OF POLLINATOR BEHAVIOUR WERE MADE FOR DIURIS BRUMALIS USING ARRAYS OF ORCHID FLOWERS. AN ANALYSIS OF FLORAL TRAITS IN THE CO-FLOWERING COMMUNITY AND SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO TEST IF DI. BRUMALIS AND THE PEA PLANTS SHOWED STRONG SIMILARITY AND WERE LIKELY TO BE PERCEIVED AS THE SAME BY BEES. POLLEN REMOVAL AND FRUIT-SET WERE RECORDED AT 18 SITES OVER TWO YEARS TO TEST IF FITNESS OF DI. BRUMALIS INCREASED WITH THE ABUNDANCE OF THE MODEL SPECIES. DIURIS BRUMALIS SHARES THE POLLINATOR SPECIES TRICHOCOCOLLETES CAPILLOSUS AND T. LEUCOGENYS (HYMENOPTERA: COLLETIDAE) WITH CO-FLOWERING FABOIDEAE FROM THE GENUS DAVIESIA. ON DI. BRUMALIS, TRICHOCOLLETES EXHIBITED THE SAME STEREOTYPED FOOD-FORAGING AND MATE-PATROLLING BEHAVIOUR THAT THEY EXHIBIT ON DAVIESIA. DIURIS AND PEA PLANTS SHOWED STRONG MORPHOLOGICAL SIMILARITY COMPARED TO THE CO-FLOWERING PLANT COMMUNITY, WHILE THE SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE OF DIURIS WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF DAVIESIA SPP. FRUIT-SET AND POLLEN REMOVAL OF DI. BRUMALIS WAS HIGHEST AT SITES WITH A GREATER NUMBER OF DAVIESIA FLOWERS. DIURIS BRUMALIS IS POLLINATED BY MIMICRY OF CO-OCCURRING CONGENERIC FABOIDEAE SPECIES. EVIDENCE FOR MIMICRY OF MULTIPLE MODELS, ALL OF WHICH SHARE POLLINATOR SPECIES, SUGGESTS THAT THIS MAY REPRESENT A GUILD MIMICRY SYSTEM. INTERESTINGLY, DI.

ALTHOUGH MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE EXPLORED MANAGED BUMBLE BEES' ABILITY TO POLLINATE VARIOUS CROPS AND THE POTENTIAL SPREAD OF PATHOGENS BY MANAGED BUMBLE BEES, SCANT RESEARCH IS AVAILABLE ON HOW MANAGED BUMBLE BEE COLONY HEALTH IS AFFECTED AFTER FORAGING WITHIN CROP FIELDS. WE MEASURED 10 B.

BEES THAT FORAGED WITHIN BLUEBERRY INCREASED IN COLONY WEIGHT AND IN THE NUMBER OF IMMATURES AND EGGS DURING THE BLOOM PERIOD COMPARED TO CONTROL COLONIES. IN CONTRAST, BEE COLONIES PLACED WITHIN WATERMELON DECREASED IN COLONY WEIGHT, NUMBER OF WORKERS AND IMMATURE BEES, AND INDIVIDUAL BEE WEIGHT COMPARED TO CONTROL COLONIES. BLUEBERRY APPEARED TO PROVIDE BEES WITH SUFFICIENT NECTAR AND POLLEN, WHEREAS WATERMELON MAY NOT HAVE PROVIDED ADEQUATE RESOURCES FOR THE BEES. BEES FORAGING WITHIN WATERMELON WERE PROBABLY FORCED TO SEARCH FOR OTHER SOURCES OF POLLEN AND NECTAR, RESULTING IN COLONY HEALTH PARAMETER DECLINES.

HERE, WE RE-EXAMINE THE TAXONOMIC AND BIOGEOGRAPHIC AFFINITIES OF BUMBLE BEES FROM NOVAYA ZEMLYA USING HISTORICAL SAMPLES AND RECENTLY COLLECTED MATERIALS (1895-1925 VS. 2015-2017). THREE BUMBLE BEE SPECIES INHABIT THE YUZHNY (SOUTHERN) ISLAND AND THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF SEVERNY (NORTHERN) ISLAND OF THIS ARCHIPELAGO: BOMBUS GLACIALIS FRIESE, 1902, B. HYPERBOREUS SCHONHERR, 1809, AND B. PYRRHOPYGUS FRIESE, 1902. BOMBUS GLACIALIS SHARES THREE UNIQUE COI HAPLOTYPES THAT MAY INDICATE ITS LONG-TERM (PRE-GLACIAL) PERSISTENCE ON NOVAYA ZEMLYA. IN CONTRAST, BOMBUS HYPERBOREUS AND B.

SEED MATURATION. MATING SYSTEM EVOLUTION IS AN UNDERAPPRECIATED BUT POTENTIALLY WIDESPREAD ADDITIONAL MECHANISM FOR THE EVOLUTIONARY EMERGENCE OF POLLEN LIMITATION IN ANIMAL-POLLINATED SELF-COMPATIBLE PLANTS. METHODS WE MODEL INDIVIDUAL PLANT FLOWERING PHENOLOGIES INFLUENCING BOTH POLLINATOR ATTRACTION AND GEITONOGAMOUS SELF-FERTILIZATION CAUSED BY POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS AMONG FLOWERS WITHIN PLANTS, INCORPORATING DEMOGRAPHIC BUT NOT ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY. PLANT PHENOLOGY AND THE RESULTING POLLEN LIMITATION ARE ANALYSED AT EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE EQUILIBRIA (ESS). POLLEN LIMITATION IS MEASURED BY TWO QUANTITIES: THE PROPORTION OF UNPOLLINATED FLOWERS AND THE REDUCTION IN MATERNAL FITNESS CAUSED BY INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN SELFED SEEDS.

MALE BEES REMOVED LESS POLLEN FROM ANTHERS THAN FEMALE BEES BUT DEPOSITED MORE POLLEN ON STIGMAS PER VISIT. THE HIGHER POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY OF MALE BEES WAS DUE TO 48.4\% OF POLLEN GRAINS REMAINING UNGROOMED ON THE THORAX AND ABDOMEN, AVAILABLE FOR STIGMA CONTACT, BUT THEIR VISITATION RATE TO FLOWERS WAS MUCH LOWER.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"ANIMAL POLLINATORS ARE IN A SERIOUS DECLINE DUE TO HABITAT LOSS, ISOLATION AND LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION, PUTTING POLLINATION SERVICES TO CROPS AT RISK. HEDGEROWS HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY EMPHASIZED AS LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS THAT PROVIDE NESTING AND FOOD RESOURCES, CONNECT FRAGMENTED HABITATS AND COULD THUS FACILITATE CROP POLLINATION. HOWEVER, THE BENEFICIAL AND POTENTIALLY ALSO DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS OF HEDGEROWS ON CROP POLLINATION REMAIN POORLY STUDIED. HERE, WE ANALYSED THE EFFECTS OF POLLINATORS AND HERBIVOROUS POLLEN BEETLES (MELIGETHES SPP.) ON QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF STRAWBERRIES FROM PHYTOMETER PLANTS LOCATED AT FOREST-CONNECTED HEDGEROWS, ISOLATED HEDGEROWS AND ON GRASSY MARGINS WITHOUT ANY HEDGEROWS. HIGHER POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE INCREASED STRAWBERRY WEIGHT, WHEREAS POLLEN BEETLE ABUNDANCE REDUCED STRAWBERRY WEIGHT. STRAWBERRY WEIGHT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY 29\% AT ISOLATED HEDGEROWS AND 32\% ON GRASSY MARGINS, COMPARED TO BERRIES AT CONNECTED HEDGEROWS. PLANTS PLACED AT FOREST-CONNECTED HEDGEROWS PRODUCED MORE HIGH QUALITY STRAWBERRIES WITH 90\% CLASSIFIED AS ``MARKETABLE, WHEREAS ONLY 75\% OF STRAWBERRIES FROM PLANTS AT ISOLATED HEDGEROWS, 48\% OF STRAWBERRIES FROM PLANTS ON GRASSY MARGINS AND 41\% OF STRAWBERRIES FROM SELF-POLLINATED CONTROL PLANTS WHERE CLASSIFIED AS MARKETABLE. CONSEQUENTLY, INCREASED HABITAT CONNECTIVITY THROUGH HEDGEROWS ENHANCED THE COMMERCIAL VALUE OF STRAWBERRIES FROM 9.27 (SIC) PER 1000 STRAWBERRIES FOR PLANTS GROWN ON GRASSY MARGINS TO 14.95 (SIC) FOR PLANTS LOCATED AT FOREST-CONNECTED HEDGEROWS. CORRESPONDINGLY, POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE WAS HIGHEST ON PHYTOMETER PLANTS AT FOREST-CONNECTED HEDGEROWS, LOWEST ON GRASSY MARGINS AND INTERMEDIATE AT ISOLATED HEDGEROWS. POLLEN BEETLE ABUNDANCE ON PHYTOMETER PLANTS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY HEDGEROWS.

J. LINNEAN SOC.,"THE GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE OF POLLINATORS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR DETERMINING THE DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS WITH SPECIALIZED POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS. FURTHERMORE, POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY CAN BE CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF CONSERVATION TRANSLOCATIONS OF THREATENED FLORA WITH SUCH INTERACTIONS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF THE ENDANGERED ORCHID CALADENIA VERSICOLOR, WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING MANAGEMENT OF WILD POPULATIONS AND CONSERVATION TRANSLOCATIONS (ARTIFICIAL TRANSLOCATION FOR CONSERVATION). USING PORTABLE GROUPS OF CULTIVATED PLANTS TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS, WE FOUND THAT AT NATURAL SITES C. VERSICOLOR IS PREDOMINANTLY POLLINATED BY FOOD-FORAGING MALES OF ONE SPECIES OF BEE, LEIOPROCTUS PLATYCEPHALUS (COLLETIDAE), WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL VISITS FROM FEMALES OR OTHER BEE SPECIES. THIS APPARENTLY HIGH DEGREE OF SPECIALIZATION OCCURRED DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF A CO-OCCURRING BEE COMMUNITY OF >20 SPECIES. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO BE NECTARLESS, GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY-MASS SPECTROMETRY ANALYSIS OF LABELLUM SECRETIONS REVEALED THAT C. VERSICOLOR PRODUCES MEAGRE QUANTITIES OF SUCROSE ON THE UPPER SURFACE OF THE LABELLUM, ON WHICH SOME POLLINATORS APPEARED TO FEED. REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WAS HIGH IN C. VERSICOLOR AT BOTH NATURAL AND TRANSLOCATED SITES. ALTHOUGH C. VERSICOLOR NOW HAS A RESTRICTED RANGE, L. PLATYCEPHALUS IS FOUND ACROSS A BROAD AREA OF SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA. THUS, POLLINATOR AVAILABILITY DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE RARITY OF C. VERSICOLOR, BUT THE APPARENT RELIANCE ON L.

ONE SOLUTION IS HABITAT RESTORATION IN MARGINAL AREAS, BUT COLONIZATION MAY BE CONSTRAINED IF RESIDENT POLLINATOR RICHNESS IS LOW OR IF RESTORED AREAS FAIL TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FLORAL OR NESTING RESOURCES. WE QUANTIFIED RESTORATION OUTCOMES FOR NATIVE BEES, AND ASSOCIATED RESOURCES, ON THREE CONVENTIONAL FARMS WITH FORB-GRASS PRAIRIE PLANTINGS ON MARGINAL AREAS OF VARYING SIZES, IN A HEAVILY FARMED REGION OF CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA. WE TESTED BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS IN RESTORED PRAIRIE VERSUS THE DOMINANT HABITATS OF THE REGION-CROPS, FOREST REMNANTS, AND EDGES OF FIELDS AND ROADS. RESTORED PRAIRIE SUPPORTED 2X MORE SPECIES (95 OF 119 TOTAL SPECIES) AND 3X MORE BEES (72\% OF CAPTURED INDIVIDUALS) COMPARED TO THE OTHER COVER TYPES. ALL RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE DIFFERENCES AMONG HABITAT TYPES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FLORAL RESOURCES IN RESTORED PRAIRIE. THIRTY PERCENT OF THE BEE SPECIES WERE UNIQUE TO PRAIRIE, CONSISTENT WITH LONG-DISTANCE DISPERSAL BUT BEGGING THE QUESTION OF ORIGIN GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF PRAIRIE REGIONALLY. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ROAD AND FIELD EDGES MAY BE THE SOURCE, AS THESE AREAS HAD MORE FLORAL AND NESTING RESOURCES THAN FOREST OR CROP FIELDS COMBINED AND SUPPORTED 55\% OF ALL SPECIES DESPITE COVERING ONLY APPROXIMATELY 5\% OF THE SAMPLED FARMS.

NONETHELESS SPECIES TRULY IN EXPANSION MAY BE OVERESTIMATED, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE, AND INFORMATION ABOUT INTRASPECIFIC LINEAGES IS LACKING. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST WHETHER THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES BOMBUS MORIO AND B. PAULOENSIS WILL BE SAFE UNDER FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGES. SPECIFICALLY, TEST IF THESE BEES WILL SUFFER GEOGRAPHIC DECLINE OR EXPANSION, TEST WHETHER EACH PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC LINEAGE WITHIN B. PAULOENSIS WILL RESPOND DIFFERENTLY IN MODELING OF FUTURE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE, FIND STABLE AREAS HOLDING HIGH GENETIC DIVERSITY BASED ON PREDICTED FUTURE CLIMATIC CHANGES, AND TEST WHETHER THESE AREAS ARE COVERED BY EXISTING PROTECTED AREAS. TO REACH THE OBJECTIVES WE PERFORMED ANALYSES USING PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC DATA ALREADY AVAILABLE AND CLIMATE CHANGE INFORMATION TO MODEL THE DEMOGRAPHY OF THE PANMICTIC B. MORIO AND THE PHYLOGEOGRAPHIC LINEAGES IN B. PAULOENSIS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BOTH SPECIES WILL SUFFER A REDUCTION IN SUITABLE AREA AND THAT THE REDUCTION IN DISTRIBUTION IS MASKED FOR B.

ECOL.,"CONTEXTBUMBLEBEES ARE IMPORTANT POLLINATORS FOR AGRICULTURAL CROPS AND WILD PLANTS. HOWEVER, AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION AND LOSS OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON COLONY PERFORMANCE. WHILE MASS-FLOWERING CROPS MAY SERVE AS FOOD SOURCES, LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE MAY BE A POOR BUMBLEBEE HABITAT COMPARED TO LANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT, SUCH AS FORESTS AND SPECIES-RICH GRASSLANDS.OBJECTIVESWE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LAND USE CLASSES ON BUMBLEBEE COLONY PERFORMANCE AT TWO PERIODS OF TIME DURING THE FLYING SEASON. WE EXPECTED MASS-FLOWERING CROPS TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON COLONY PERFORMANCE DURING FLOWERING. AFTER MASS-FLOWERING, PRESENCE OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT WAS HYPOTHESIZED TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR COLONY DEVELOPMENT.METHODSWE PLACED ARTIFICIAL COLONIES OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS IN 28 APPLE AND PEAR ORCHARDS DURING AND AFTER MASS-FLOWERING. WE MEASURED COLONY GROWTH AND TOOK POLLEN SAMPLES FROM FORAGING WORKERS. CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LAND-USE, POLLEN QUALITY, AMOUNT OF POLLEN COLLECTED AND COLONY PERFORMANCE WERE ANALYZED.RESULTSCONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, WE FOUND A NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN ORCHARD COVER AND AMOUNT OF POLLEN COLLECTED IN SPRING, DURING MASS-FLOWERING, RESULTING IN A LOWER COLONY PERFORMANCE. DURING MASS-FLOWERING, COLONY PERFORMANCE AND POLLEN DIVERSITY WERE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH COVER OF OPEN SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT, WHILE AFTER MASS-FLOWERING, COLONY PERFORMANCE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FOREST COVER. AFTER MASS-FLOWERING, POLLEN SOURCES WERE MORE DIVERSE AND COLONY GROWTH WAS RELATED TO LAND USE CLASSES AT A LARGER SPATIAL SCALE, INDICATING THAT BUMBLEBEES FORAGED FURTHER. WE DID NOT FIND A CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCES OF COLONIES AT ONE SPECIFIC SITE THAT WERE PLACED DURING AND AFTER MASS-FLOWERING.CONCLUSIONSLANDSCAPES DOMINATED BY MASS-FLOWERING ORCHARDS REPRESENT INFERIOR HABITATS FOR BUMBLEBEES DURING FLOWERING. HETEROGENOUS LANDSCAPES, CONTAINING A MIX OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT INCREASE THE HABITAT QUALITY FOR BUMBLEBEES.

R. SOC. B-BIOL. SCI.,"THE FLOWERING PHENOLOGY OF EARLY-BLOOMING PLANTS IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY SNOWMELT TIMING IN HIGH-LATITUDE AND HIGH-ALTITUDE ECOSYSTEMS. WHEN THE SYNCHRONY OF FLOWERING AND POLLINATOR EMERGENCE IS DISTURBED BY CLIMATE CHANGE, SEED PRODUCTION MAY BE RESTRICTED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT POLLINATION SUCCESS. WE REVEALED THE MECHANISM OF PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH BETWEEN A SPRING EPHEMERAL (CORYDALIS AMBIGUA) AND ITS POLLINATOR (OVERWINTERED BUMBLEBEES), AND ITS IMPACT ON PLANT REPRODUCTION, BASED ON 19 YEARS OF MONITORING AND A SNOW REMOVAL EXPERIMENT IN A COOL-TEMPERATE FOREST IN NORTHERN JAPAN. EARLY SNOWMELT INCREASED THE RISK OF PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS. SEED PRODUCTION WAS LIMITED BY POLLINATION SUCCESS OVER THE 3 YEARS OF THE POLLINATION EXPERIMENT AND DECREASED WHEN FLOWERING OCCURRED PRIOR TO BEE EMERGENCE. SIMILAR TRENDS WERE DETECTED ON MODIFICATION OF FLOWERING PHENOLOGY THROUGH SNOW REMOVAL. FOLLOWING SNOWMELT, THE LENGTH OF THE PRE-FLOWERING PERIOD STRONGLY DEPENDED ON THE AMBIENT SURFACE TEMPERATURE, RANGING FROM 4 DAYS (AT GREATER THAN 7 DEGREES C) TO 26 DAYS (AT 2.5 DEGREES C). FLOWERING ONSET WAS EXPLAINED WITH AN ACCUMULATED SURFACE DEGREE-DAY MODEL. BUMBLEBEES EMERGED WHEN SOIL TEMPERATURE REACHED 6 DEGREES C, WHICH WAS PREDICTABLE BY AN ACCUMULATED SOIL DEGREE-DAY MODEL, ALTHOUGH FORAGING ACTIVITY AFTER EMERGENCE MIGHT DEPEND ON AIR TEMPERATURE. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH TENDS TO OCCUR WHEN SNOW MELTS EARLY BUT SUBSEQUENT SOIL WARMING PROGRESSES SLOWLY.

RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE US CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM (CRP) HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ENVIRONMENTAL SUITABILITY FOR SUPPORTING HONEY BEE APIARIES. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF HABITAT CONSERVATION EFFORTS ON HONEY BEE COLONY HEALTH. IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE BEE HEALTH AT THE COLONY LEVEL INCORPORATES LONGITUDINAL MONITORING OF PHYSIOLOGY ACROSS DIVERSE ENVIRONMENTS. USING A POOLED-SAMPLING METHOD TO OVERCOME INDIVIDUAL VARIATION, WE MONITORED COLONY-LEVEL MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS DURING CRITICAL PRE-AND POST-WINTER TIME POINTS. MAJOR CATEGORIES OF COLONY HEALTH (NUTRITION, OXIDATIVE STRESS RESISTANCE, AND IMMUNITY) WERE IMPACTED BY APIARY SITE. IN GENERAL, APIARIES WITHIN FORAGING DISTANCE OF CRP LANDS SHOWED IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER GENE EXPRESSION OF VITELLOGENIN (VG), A NUTRITIONALLY REGULATED PROTEIN WITH CENTRAL STORAGE AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. MIRRORING VG LEVELS, GENE TRANSCRIPTS ENCODING ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES AND IMMUNE-RELATED PROTEINS WERE TYPICALLY HIGHER IN COLONIES EXPOSED TO CRP ENVIRONMENTS.
