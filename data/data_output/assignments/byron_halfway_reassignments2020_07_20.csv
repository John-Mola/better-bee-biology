THE LOSS OF POLLINATORS AND CONSEQUENTIAL POLLINATION LIMITATION IS ESPECIALLY SEVERE FOR OBLIGATELY OUT-CROSSING PLANT SPECIES. IN THIS STUDY, POLLINATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF HIPPOCREPIS COMOSA WAS EXAMINED. HIPPOCREPIS COMOSA L IS A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE, DECLINING PLANT SPECIES OCCURRING ON FRAGMENTED REMNANTS IN SEMI-NATURAL CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND HABITATS IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IN SOUTHERN LOWER SAXONY, GERMANY. PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS WERE ANALYSED IN SMALL, MEDIUM, AND LARGE PLANT PATCHES IN 15 DIFFERENTLY SIZED CALCAREOUS GRASSLAND FRAGMENTS SURROUNDED BY LANDSCAPE MATRICES OF DIFFERING COMPLEXITY. FLOWER VISITORS WERE OBSERVED DURING THREE 15-MINUTE OBSERVATIONS, POLLEN SUPPLEMENTATION EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO TEST FOR POLLINATION LIMITATION, AND FRUITS FROM THE PLANT PATCHES WERE COLLECTED TO CALCULATE SEED SET. HIPPOCREPIS COMOSA SHOWED EVIDENCE OF POLLINATION LIMITATION BECAUSE HAND-POLLINATED FLOWERS SET MORE SEEDS PER INFLORESCENCE THAN OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS AND SEED SET WAS STRONGLY REDUCED BY DECREASED VISITATION RATES. POLLINATORS WERE MOST ABUNDANT IN LARGE PATCHES AND IN DIVERSE LANDSCAPES. VISITATION RATE WAS NOT AFFECTED BY PATCH SIZE.

CONTROL,"THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF BIOFUNGICIDES FOR THE CONTROL OF IMPORTANT PLANT PATHOGENS, SUCH AS THE GRAY MOLD BOTRYTIS CINEREA, REQUIRES INVESTIGATION DUE TO THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT FOR VERY LOW PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN FOODSTUFFS, AND CONCERNS OVER THE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CHEMICAL FUNGICIDES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF BUMBLEBEES AS POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS GENERATED THE NEED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AGAINST THESE INSECTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF TWO COMMERCIAL TRICHODERMA-BASED BIOFUNGICIDES AGAINST THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. THE TWO COMMERCIAL COMPOUNDS TESTED WERE BINAB-TF-WP AND BINAB-TF-WP-KONC, BOTH OF WHICH CONTAIN COMBINATIONS OF TRICHODERMA HARZIANUM ATCC20476 AND DICHODERMA POLYSPORUM ATCC20475. THE BUMBLEBEES WERE EXPOSED TO THE BIOCONTROL AGENTS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN THE FIELD (MFRC), AND THEN EXPOSED VIA THREE POTENTIAL ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: DERMAL CONTACT, ORALLY VIA THE DRINKING OF TREATED SUGAR WATER, AND VIA TREATED POLLEN. THE TREATMENTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH RECORDING WORKER MORTALITY (LETHAL EFFECTS) AND ANY EFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DRONES (SUBLETHAL EFFECTS). THE LABORATORY TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS DID NOT CAUSE WORKER MORTALITY OR ADVERSELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE TRICHODERMA-BASED PRODUCTS COULD SURVIVE OR GROW ON THE BODIES OF THE ADULT WORKERS. IN NO CASE WAS SURVIVAL OR GROWTH OF THE BIOFUNGICIDE OBSERVED ON THE WORKERS. WHEN THE EFFECTS OF THESE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED AGAINST BUMBLEBEE LARVAE (THIRD AND FOURTH INSTARS), NO ENTOMOPATHOGENIC EFFECTS WERE FOUND.

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE POSSIBILITY OF MOVING ACTIVELY NESTING O.

NESTING SHELTERS WITH KNOWN NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE NOCTURNALLY RELOCATED FOR DISTANCES RANGING FROM 0 TO 240 KM, AND THE NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE COUNTED AFTER EACH MOVE. NEARLY ALL FEMALES CONTINUED TO NEST AT SHELTERS THAT WERE MOVED SHORT (0-3 M) DISTANCES. MOVES OF INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES (135-235 M) RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE (30-76\%) BEE LOSS (DISPERSAL), AND MANY FEMALES NEW BACK TO THE ORIGINAL NESTING SITE. AT LONG DISTANCES (3-240 KM), DISPERSAL WAS HIGHER (63-78\%) AND NO BEES WERE SEEN HOVERING AT THE ORIGINAL SITE. MOVING DISTANCE WAS CORRELATED POSITIVELY WITH DISPERSAL AND WITH ORIENTATION (ZIGZAGGING) NIGHTS MADE BY FEMALES WHEN THEY FIRST EXITED THEIR NESTS AFTER THE MOVES. THE ADDITION OR REMOVAL OF SUPPLEMENTARY VISUAL LANDMARKS (2 BY 1.5-M BANNER WITH COLORED PATTERNS) AT THE NESTING SHELTER DID NOT AFFECT DISPERSAL RATES. BEES APPEARED TO RESPOND TO SUPPLEMENTARY LANDMARKS BUT USED OTHER SIGNALS AS PRIMARY ORIENTATION CUES. AN ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENT SHOWED THAT O.

APPL.,"GIVEN BEES' CENTRAL EFFECT ON VEGETATION COMMUNITIES, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW AND WHY BEE DISTRIBUTIONS VARY ACROSS ECOLOGICAL GRADIENTS. WE EXAMINED HOW PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, PLANT DIVERSITY, NESTING SUITABILITY, CANOPY COVER, LAND USE, AND FIRE HISTORY AFFECTED BEE DISTRIBUTION ACROSS AN OPEN-FOREST GRADIENT IN NORTHWEST INDIANA, USA, A GRADIENT SIMILAR TO THE HISTORIC MIDWEST UNITED STATES LANDSCAPE MOSAIC. WHEN CONSIDERED WITH THE OTHER PREDICTORS, PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION. BEE ABUNDANCE WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO CANOPY COVER AND POSITIVELY TO RECENT FIRE FREQUENCY, BEE RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF POTENTIAL NESTING RESOURCES, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PLANT RICHNESS, SOIL CHARACTERISTICS POTENTIALLY RELATED TO NESTING SUITABILITY, AND CANOPY COVER. THUS, BEE ABUNDANCE WAS PREDICTED BY A DIFFERENT SET OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS THAN WAS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS, AND BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION WAS PREDICTED, IN LARGE PART, BY A COMBINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF BEE ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS. DIFFERENCES IN BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION ALONG THE WOODY VEGETATION GRADIENT WERE CORRELATED WITH RELATIVE ABUNDANCE OF OLIGOLECTIC, OR DIET SPECIALIST, BEES. BECAUSE OLIGOLEGES WERE RARER THAN DIET GENERALISTS AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN HABITATS, THEIR POPULATIONS MAY BE ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY DEGRADATION OF OPEN HABITATS. MORE HABITAT-SPECIALIST BEES WERE DOCUMENTED FOR OPEN AND FOREST/SCRUB HABITATS THAN FOR SAVANNA/WOODLAND HABITATS, CONSISTENT WITH BEES RESPONDING TO HABITATS OF INTERMEDIATE WOODY VEGETATION DENSITY, SUCH AS SAVANNAS, AS ECOTONES RATHER THAN AS DISTINCT HABITAT TYPES. SIMILARITY OF BEE COMMUNITY COMPOSITION, SIMILARITY OF BEE ABUNDANCE, AND SIMILARITY OF BEE RICHNESS BETWEEN SITES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO PROXIMITY OF SITES TO EACH OTHER. NESTEDNESS ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT SPECIES COMPOSITION IN SPECIES-POOR SITES WAS NOT MERELY A SUBSET OF SPECIES COMPOSITION AT RICHER SITES. THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT PROXIMITY OR NESTEDNESS EFFECTS SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS AT A SMALL SPATIAL SCALE STRONGLY INFLUENCE BEES' USE OF SITES.

HUMAN ACTIVITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREST FRAGMENTATION TEND ALSO TO CHANGE THE INTERNAL CHARACTERISTICS OF REMNANT PATCHES, FOR EXAMPLE, THROUGH THE CREATION OF GAPS BY SELECTIVE LOGGING. WHILE EDGES AND GAPS CAN BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE COMPARABLE CHANGES IN THE MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS OF THE FOREST, THEIR EFFECTS ON FOREST-DWELLING SPECIES AND THEIR INTERACTIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECT OF FOREST EDGES AND ANTHROPOGENIC GAPS ON THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE EPIPHYTIC PLANT (MITRARIA COCCINEA), MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MUTUALISTS (POLLINATORS) AND ANTAGONISTS (FLOWER LARCENISTS). MITRARIA COCCINEA'S FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY HUMMINGBIRDS AND ROBBED BY THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS DAHLBOMII. EDGES AND GAPS HAD COMPARABLE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON FLOWER PRODUCTION AND FRUIT SET, HOWEVER, NECTAR ROBBING WAS UP TO SEVENFOLD HIGHER IN PATCHES WITH NUMEROUS GAPS AND RESULTED IN LOWER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS (FRUIT SET AND TOTAL FRUIT CROP).

THE SHOWY RED FLOWERS SUGGEST AN ORNITHOPHILOUS POLLINATION SYNDROME AND THEY HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO ATTRACT HUMMINGBIRDS IN ARGENTINA AND HUMMINGBIRDS AND PASSERINES IN CHILE. AT EACH POPULATION, FLOWER VISITORS WERE RECORDED AND FLORAL REWARDS WERE ANALYSED. WE FOUND A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NECTAR CONCENTRATION TOWARDS THE DRIER END OF THE GRADIENT, BUT THIS CHANGE WAS NOT RELATED TO THE TURNOVER OF SPECIES IN THE FLOWER-VISITOR ASSEMBLAGE OF E. COCCINEUM. IN ADDITION TO THE HUMMINGBIRD SEPHANOIDES SEPHANIODES (GREEN-BACKED FIRECROWN, TROCHILIDAE) WHICH IS WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT THE TEMPERATE FOREST AT THIS LATITUDE, OTHER SPECIES SEEM TO BE LOCALLY IMPORTANT AS POLLINATORS OF E.

KNOWING THE CAUSES FOR THIS VARIATION IS CENTRAL TO THE CONSERVATION OF SINGLE SPECIES AS WELL AS WHOLE PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITIES. SPECIES SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS ON FLOWER VISITOR NUMBERS ARE SELDOM INVESTIGATED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. IN THIS STUDY WE TESTED WHETHER FLOWER SIZE PARAMETERS SET CONSTRAINTS ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE POTENTIAL NECTAR FEEDING VISITORS AND THUS DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES. WE STUDIED THREE POSSIBLE CONSTRAINTS: THE DEPTH AND WIDTH OF TUBULAR STRUCTURES HIDING THE NECTAR (NECTAR HOLDER DEPTH AND WIDTH) AND THE SIZE OF FLOWER PARTS THAT VISITORS CAN LAND ON (SIZE OF THE ALIGHTING PLACE). IN ADDITION WE ASSESS THE ROLE OF FLOWER ABUNDANCE ON THIS RELATIONSHIP. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE STRONGER SIZE CONSTRAINTS AND THE SMALLER FLOWER ABUNDANCE, THE SMALLER THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES WILL BE. OUR STUDY OF A MEDITERRANEAN PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR COMMUNITY REVEALED THAT NECTAR HOLDER DEPTH, NECTAR HOLDER WIDTH AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS EXPLAINED 71\% OF THE VARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF VISITOR SPECIES. THE SIZE OF THE ALIGHTING PLACE DID NOT RESTRICT THE BODY LENGTH OF THE VISITORS AND WAS NOT RELATED TO VISITOR SPECIES NUMBER. IN A SECOND STEP OF THE ANALYSES WE CALCULATED FOR EACH PLANT SPECIES THE POTENTIAL NUMBER OF VISITORS BY DETERMINING FOR EACH INSECT SPECIES OF THE LOCAL VISITOR POOL WHETHER IT PASSED THE MORPHOLOGICAL LIMITS SET BY THE PLANT. THESE POTENTIAL NUMBERS WERE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE OBSERVED NUMBERS (R(2)=0.5, P < 0.001). FOR EACH PLANT SPECIES WE TESTED WHETHER THE OBSERVED VISITORS WERE A RANDOM SELECTION OUT OF THESE POTENTIAL VISITORS BY COMPARING THE MEAN OF THE OBSERVED AND EXPECTED PROBOSCIS LENGTH DISTRIBUTIONS. FOR MOST PLANT SPECIES THE OBSERVED MEAN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE RANDOM MEANS. OUR FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON THE WAY PLANT-FLOWER VISITOR NETWORKS ARE STRUCTURED.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS FLOWER SHAPES ARE IMPORTANT VISUAL CUES FOR POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, THE ABILITY OF POLLINATORS TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN FLOWER SHAPES UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE DIVERSITY OF FLOWER SHAPE IN PRIMULA SIEBOLDII AND INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF BUMBLEBEES TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN FLOWERS BY COMBINING COMPUTER GRAPHICS WITH A TRADITIONAL BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENT. METHODS ELLIPTIC FOURIER DESCRIPTORS DESCRIBED SHAPES BY TRANSFORMING COORDINATE INFORMATION FOR THE CONTOURS INTO COEFFICIENTS, AND PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS SUMMARIZED THESE COEFFICIENTS. USING THESE METHODS, ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WERE CREATED BASED ON THE NATURAL DIVERSITY OF PETAL SHAPE IN P. SIEBOLDII. DUAL-CHOICE TESTS WERE THEN PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ABILITY OF THE BUMBLEBEES TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN THE ASPECT RATIO OF PETALS AND THE DEPTH OF THEIR HEAD NOTCH. KEY RESULTS THE INSECTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT ABILITY TO DETECT DIFFERENCES IN THE ASPECT RATIO OF THE PETALS UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS UNLESS THE MORPHOLOGICAL DISTANCE INCREASED TO AN UNREALISTIC LEVEL. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THE EXISTENCE OF A PERCEPTION THRESHOLD FOR DISTANCES IN THIS PARAMETER. THE BUMBLEBEES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE FOR NARROW PETALS EVEN AFTER TRAINING USING FLOWERS WITH WIDE PETALS. THE BUMBLEBEES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ABILITY TO DISCRIMINATE BASED ON THE DEPTH OF THE PETAL HEAD NOTCH AFTER TRAINING USING ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS WITH A DEEP HEAD NOTCH. HOWEVER, THEY SHOWED NO DISCRIMINATION IN TESTS WITH TRAINING USING EXTREME DISTANCES BETWEEN FLOWERS IN THIS PARAMETER. CONCLUSIONS A NEW TYPE OF BEHAVIOURAL EXPERIMENT WAS DEMONSTRATED USING REAL VARIATION IN FLOWER COROLLA SHAPE IN P. SIEBOLDII. IF THE RANGE IN ASPECT RATIOS OF PETALS EXPANDS MUCH FURTHER, BUMBLEBEES MAY LEARN TO EXHIBIT SELECTIVE BEHAVIOUR. HOWEVER, BECAUSE DISCRIMINATION BY BUMBLEBEES UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS WAS LOW, THERE MAY BE NO STRONG SELECTIVE BEHAVIOUR BASED ON INNATE OR LEARNED PREFERENCES UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS.",BUMBLEBEE; COMPUTER GRAPHICS; ELLIPTIC FOURIER DESCRIPTORS; FLOWER COROLLA SHAPE; PRIMULA SIEBOLDII; PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS; VISUAL CUE,ELLIPTIC FOURIER DESCRIPTORS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; PETAL SHAPE; QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION; IMAGE-ANALYSIS; BEES; PREFERENCES; MORPHOLOGY; EVOLUTION; HONEYBEES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,18,"NINOMIYA, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, 1-1-1 TENNODAI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.;UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.;NATL INST AGROENVIRONM SCI, BIODIVERS DIV, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.;NATL AGR RES CTR, DATA MINING \& GRID RES TEAM, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN.",10.1093/AOB/MCM059,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,NA,0305-7364,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,99,2007,ISI000247781700014,28,PLANT SCIENCES,15,PLANT SCIENCES,SNINOAFFRE.GO.JP,186MB,"NINOMIYA, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TSUKUBA, GRAD SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, 1-1-1 TENNODAI, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN",ISI,none,UNIV TSUKUBA;NATL INST AGROENVIRONM SCI;NATL AGR RES CTR,UNIV TSUKUBA,NA,"YOSHIOKA Y, 2007, ANN BOT","YOSHIOKA Y, 2007, ANN BOT",NA,NA,NA,tien l
