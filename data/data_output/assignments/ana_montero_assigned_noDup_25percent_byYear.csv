JOHNSTON MO,JOHNSTON MO,EFFECTS OF CROSS AND SELF-FERTILIZATION ON PROGENY FITNESS IN LOBELIA-CARDINALIS AND L-SIPHILITICA,EVOLUTION,EVOLUTION,"INBREEDING DEPRESSION, OR THE DECREASED FITNESS OF PROGENY DERIVED FROM SELF-FERTILIZATION AS COMPARED TO OUTCROSSING, IS THOUGHT TO BE THE MOST GENERAL FACTOR AFFECTING THE EVOLUTION OF SELF-FERTILIZATION IN PLANTS. NEVERTHELESS, DATA ON INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN FITNESS CHARACTERS ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT FOR PERENNIALS OBSERVED IN THEIR NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS. IN THIS STUDY I MEASURED INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN BOTH SURVIVAL AND FERTILITY IN TWO SYMPATRIC, SHORT-LIVED, PERENNIAL HERBS: HUMMINGBIRD-POLLINATED LOBELIA CARDINALIS (TWO POPULATIONS) AND BUMBLEBEE-POLLINATED L. SIPHILITICA (ONE POPULATION). CROSSES WERE PERFORMED BY HAND IN THE FIELD, AND SEEDLINGS GERMINATED IN THE GREENHOUSE. LEVELS OF INBREEDING DEPRESSION WERE DETERMINED FOR ONE YEAR IN THE GREENHOUSE AND FOR TWO TO THREE YEARS FOR SEEDLINGS TRANSPLANTED BACK TO THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. FERTILITY WAS MEASURED AS FLOWER NUMBER, WHICH IS HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH SEED PRODUCTION UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS IN THESE POPULATIONS. INBREEDING DEPRESSION WAS ASSESSED IN THREE WAYS: 1) SURVIVAL AND FERTILITY WITHIN THE DIFFERENT AGE INTERVALS, 2) CUMULATIVE SURVIVAL FROM THE SEED STAGE THROUGH EACH AGE INTERVAL, AND 3) NET FERTILITY, OR THE EXPECTED FERTILITY OF A SEED AT DIFFERENT AGES. NET FERTILITY IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF FITNESS COMBINING SURVIVAL AND FLOWER NUMBER. IN ALL THREE POPULATIONS, SELFING HAD NONSIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF SEEDS. LOBELIA SIPHILITICA AND ONE POPULATION OF L. CARDINALIS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF INBREEDING DEPRESSION BETWEEN SEED MATURATION AND GERMINATION, EXCLUDING THE CONSIDERATION OF POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES IN DORMANCY OR LONGTERM VIABILITY IN THE SOIL. THERE WAS NO INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN SUBSEQUENT SURVIVAL IN THE GREENHOUSE IN ANY POPULATION. IN THE FIELD, SIGNIFICANT SURVIVAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SELFED AND OUTCROSSED PROGENY OCCURRED ONLY IN TWO YEARS AND IN ONLY ONE POPULATION OF L. CARDINALIS. FOR BOTH SURVIVAL AND FERTILITY THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR THE EXPECTED DIFFERENCES AMONG FAMILIES IN INBREEDING DEPRESSION. COMPARED TO SURVIVAL, INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN FERTILITY (FLOWER NUMBER) TENDED TO BE MUCH HIGHER. BY FIRST-YEAR FLOWER PRODUCTION, THE COMBINED EFFECTS ON SURVIVAL AND FLOWER NUMBER CAUSED INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN NET FERTILITY TO REACH 54\%, 34\% AND 71\% FOR L. SIPHILITICA AND THE TWO POPULATIONS OF L. CARDINALIS. BY THE END OF THE SECOND YEAR OF FLOWERING IN THE FIELD, INBREEDING DEPRESSION IN NET FERTILITY WAS 53\% FOR L. SIPHILITICA AND 54\% FOR ONE POPULATION OF L. CARDINALIS. FOR THE OTHER POPULATION OF L. CARDINALIS, THESE VALUES WERE 76\% THROUGH THE SECOND YEAR OF FLOWERING AND 83\% THROUGH THE THIRD YEAR.

LEVELS OF FRUIT DAMAGE FROM INSECT LARVAE RANGED FROM >90\% IN 1984-1985 TO A LOW OF 37\% IN 1990. SEED PREDATORS CONSUMED THE SMALL, WINGED SEEDS AND ALSO PREVENTED NORMAL FRUIT DEVELOPMENT. UNEATEN SEEDS WITHIN DAMAGED FRUITS OFTEN APPEARED MOLDY, AND DISPERSAL BY WIND WAS UNLIKELY.

BOT.,"THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A PHRYGANIC (EAST MEDITERRANEAN) ECOSYSTEM AT DAPHNI, NEAR ATHENS, GREECE. THE LABIATAE, REPRESENTED BY TEN SPECIES BELONGING TO NINE GENERA, DOMINATE IN THIS ECOSYSTEM TYPE. THEY FLOWER FROM FEBRUARY TO JULY. BOTH FLOWERING TIME AND NECTAR QUANTITY ARE RELATED TO THE SPECIES ABILITY TO TOLERATE INTENSE WATER STRESS. LABIATAE ARE VISITED BY 201 INSECT SPECIES. OF THESE, 43 ARE EXCLUSIVELY SUPPORTED BY THE FAMILY AND 37 ARE MONOTROPOUS. SOLITARY BEES (MAINLY ANTHOPHORIDAE, MEGACHILIDAE, HALICTIDAE) CONSTITUTE 47.3\% OF POLLINATORS. THE FAMILY IS IMPORTANT IN HOSTING SPECIALIZED BEES (15 SPECIES) IN PHRYGANA, PARTICULARLY LATE IN THE FLOWERING SEASON. LABIATAE SPECIES FORM TWO EQUALLY REPRESENTED GROUPS IN THIS SYSTEM, NAMELY, THE LATE WINTER-EARLY SPRING (EARLY) FLOWERING, VISITED BY RELATIVELY FEW POLLINATOR SPECIES, AND THE LATE SPRING-SUMMER (LATE) FLOWERING SPECIES, VISITED BY NUMEROUS POLLINATORS. THIS TEMPORAL DISTINCTION IS ACCOMPANIED BY DIFFERENT POLLINATION PROFILES THAT INCLUDE DURATION OF ANTHESIS, REWARD TO POLLINATORS, FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS, AND FLOWER CHARACTER DIFFERENTIATION. ALL OF THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE MAXIMIZED IN THE EARLY FLOWERING PERIOD. THIS STRATEGY SUGGESTS A MECHANISM FOR RESOURCE PARTITIONING AT A TIME WHEN THE POLLINATOR RESOURCE IS LIMITED AND COMPETITION FOR THE SERVICES OF POLLINATORS IS EXPECTED TO BE INTENSE.

WE ALSO MEASURED HOW FAST VISITORS ARRIVED AT `'TARGET'' FLOWERS IN THE DISPLAYS. THEN WE USED THE COX MODEL, A FAILURE TIME ANALYSIS PROCEDURE, TO ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VISITOR ARRIVAL AND DISPLAY SIZE. WE FOUND THAT MALE DISPLAY SIZES WERE SOMEWHAT LARGER IN THE DIOECIOUS THAN THE MONOECIOUS PLANTS, BUT THIS WAS DUE TO MORE COMPRESSED BLOOMING RATHER THAN TO A LARGER TOTAL NUMBER OF FLOWERS. THE VISITORS TO BATH PLANTS WERE SIMILAR ARRAYS OF GENERALIST BEES. VISITORS DID NOT SHOW THE PREDICTED `'DRAMATIC'' RESPONSE, HOWEVER, BUT RATHER A PLATEAUING RESPONSE TO LARGER DISPLAY SIZES, SO OUR RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS.

HERE WE EVALUATE HOW POLLINATOR MOVEMENT AMONG PLANTS, APPARENT POLLEN CARRYOVER, OVULE NUMBER, RESOURCE LIMITATION OF SEED SET, AND POLLEN OUTPUT AFFECT VARIATION IN CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL POLLINATOR SPECIES TO SEED SET IN LITHOPHRAGMA PARVIFLORUM (SAXIFRAGACEAE), A SPECIES VISITED BY A BROAD SPECTRUM OF VISITORS, INCLUDING BEEFLIES, BEES, AND A MOTH SPECIES. A PREVIOUS STUDY DEMONSTRATED DIFFERENCES AMONG VISITOR SPECIES IN THEIR SINGLE-VISIT POLLINATION EFFICACY BUT DID NOT EVALUATE HOW DIFFERENCES IN VISITATION PATTERNS AND POLLEN CARRYOVER AFFECT POLLINATOR EFFICACY. INCORPORATION OF DIFFERENTIAL VISITATION PATTERNS AND POLLEN CARRYOVER EFFECTS - COMMONLY CITED AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT IN EVALUATING POLLINATOR GUILDS - HAD MINOR EFFECTS (0-0.6\% CHANGE) ON THE ESTIMATES OF RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION BASED ON VISIT FREQUENCY AND SINGLE-VISIT EFFICACY ALONE. BEEFLIES VISITED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE FLOWERS PER INFLORESCENCE THAN THE BEES AND THE MOTH. SEED SET REMAINED VIRTUALLY CONSTANT DURING THE FIRST THREE VISITED FLOWERS FOR BEEFLIES AND LARGER BEES, INDICATING THAT APPARENT POLLEN CARRYOVER DID NOT REDUCE PER-VISIT EFFICACY OF THESE TAXA. IN CONTRAST, GREYA MOTH VISITS SHOWED A DECREASE IN SEED SET BY 55.4\% AND THE SMALLER BEES BY 45.4\% FROM FIRST TO SECOND FLOWER. THE LARGER CARRYOVER EFFECTS IN SMALLER BEES AND GREYA WERE DIMINISHED IN IMPORTANCE BY THEIR SMALL OVERALL CONTRIBUTION TO SEED SET. THREE VARIABLE PLANT TRAITS MAY AFFECT SEED SET: OVULE NUMBER, RESOURCE LIMITATION ON SEED MATURATION, AND POLLEN OUTPUT. OVULE NUMBER PER FLOWER DECLINED STRONGLY WITH LATER POSITION WITHIN INFLORESCENCES. NUMBERS WERE MUCH HIGHER IN FIRST-YEAR GREENHOUSE-GROWN PLANTS THAN IN FIELD POPULATIONS, AND DIFFERENCES INCREASED DURING 3 YEARS OF STUDY. MEAN POLLEN COUNT BY POSITION VARIED 7-FOLD AMONG FLOWERS, IT PARALLELED OVULE NUMBER VARIATION, RESULTING IN A RELATIVELY STABLE POLLEN:OVULE RATIO. RESOURCE LIMITATION OF SEED SET INCREASED STRONGLY WITH LATER FLOWERING, WITH SEED SET IN HAND-POLLINATED FLOWERS RANGING FROM 66\% IN EARLY FLOWERS TO 0\% IN THE LAST TWO FLOWERS OF ALL PLANTS. VARIATION IN OVULE NUMBER AND RESOURCE LIMITATION OF SEED MATURATION JOINTLY HAD A STRONG EFFECT ON THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PER FLOWER. VISITATION TO EARLY FLOWERS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE MORE SEED SET THAN VISITATION TO LATER FLOWERS. OVERALL, THE MOST IMPORTANT SOURCES OF VARIATION TO SEED PRODUCTION CONTRIBUTION WERE DIFFERENCES AMONG POLLINATORS IN ABUNDANCE AND ABSOLUTE EFFICACY (OVULES FERTILIZED ON A SINGLE VISIT) AND POTENTIALLY DIFFERENTIAL PHENOLOGY AMONG VISITOR SPECIES.

ARMBRUSTER WS,ARMBRUSTER WS,EXAPTATIONS LINK EVOLUTION OF PLANT-HERBIVORE AND PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS: A PHYLOGENETIC INQUIRY,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY LINKS BETWEEN PLANT-HERBIVORE AND PLANT-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS, DEFENSE AND REWARD CHARACTERISTICS AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY WERE MAPPED ONTO A MORPHOLOGICALLY ESTIMATED PHYLOGENY OF 42 SPECIES OF DALECHAMPIA. THIS PROCEDURE GENERATED DETAILED HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF ANTI-HERBIVORE DEFENSE AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS. THESE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED USING THE RESULTS OF CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND BIOASSAYS OF FOLIAR AND FLORAL SECRETIONS. MULTIPLE LINES OF DEFENSE APPEAR TO HAVE EVOLVED IN SEQUENCE IN DALECHAMPIA. THE FIRST DEFENSE SYSTEM TO ORIGINATE WAS DEPLOYMENT OF TRITERPENE RESINS TO DEFEND THE STAMINATE FLOWERS, THIS FEATURE WAS A PREAPTATION (PREADAPTATION) THAT ALLOWED THE EVOLUTION OF A RESIN-BASED, POLLINATOR-REWARD SYSTEM. THUS POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING BEES ORIGINATED AS A `'TRANSFER EXAPTATION'' (A NEW FUNCTION REPLACED THE OLD). THIS HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY ANTI-HERBIVORE ACTIVITIES OF FLORAL RESINS AND BY CHEMICAL SIMILARITY OF FLORAL DEFENSE AND REWARD RESINS. AFTER THE RESIN DEFENSE OF FLOWERS WAS LOST BY CONVERSION INTO A REWARD SYSTEM, THERE FOLLOWED (IN EVOLUTIONARY TIME) A SEQUENCE OF DEFENSIVE INNOVATIONS. THESE INCLUDED NOCTURNAL CLOSURE OF LARGE, INVOLUCRAL BRACTS TO PROTECT BOTH STAMINATE AND PISTILLATE FLOWERS. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE LARGE BRACTS THEMSELVES PROBABLY ORIGINATED AS A FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEM, AND THE BRACTS ASSUMED A DEFENSIVE FUNCTION THROUGH `'ADDITION EXAPTATION'' (A NEW FUNCTION WAS ADDED TO THE OLD). ADDITIONAL LINES OF DEFENSE TO EVOLVE WERE DEPLOYMENT OF RESIN TO DEFEND THE DEVELOPING OVARIES AND SEEDS (AN ADDITION EXAPTATION), DEPLOYMENT OF SHARP, DETACHING TRICHOMES ON ENVELOPING SEPALS TO DEFEND DEVELOPING SEEDS (APPARENT ADAPTATIONS), CLOSURE OF INVOLUCRAL BRACTS AROUND THE DEVELOPING FRUITS AND SEEDS (AN ADDITION EXAPTATION), AND DEPLOYMENT OF RESIN TO DEFEND THE LEAVES AND GROWING SHOOT TIPS (ALSO AN ADDITION EXAPTATION). SUPPORT FOR THIS SCENARIO ALSO DERIVES FROM THE CHEMICAL SIMILARITIES OF SEPAL, FOLIAR, AND FLORAL RESINS, AND THE ANTI-HERBIVORE PROPERTIES OF FOLIAR RESINS. IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST ONE POLLINATOR-REWARD SYSTEM ORIGINATED BY MODIFICATION OF A DEFENSE SYSTEM, AND SEVERAL DEFENSE SYSTEMS ORIGINATED BY MODIFICATION OF POLLINATOR REWARD AND ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEMS.

THE PRINCIPAL FLORAL VISITORS WERE THE NECTAR ROBBING HUMMINGBIRDS OCREATUS UNDERWOODII (19.1\% OF VISITS) AND CHLOROSTILBON MELLISUGUS (18.9\%). ONLY TWO SPECIES OF LONG-BILLED HUMMINGBIRDS VISITED THE BOWERS OF M. BULLATA AS ``LEGITIMATE POLLINATORS: COELIGENA TORQUATA (14.7\% OF VISITS) AND DORYFERA LUDOVICIAE (14.3\%).

ENTOMOL.,"1. NESTING BEHAVIOUR AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE BEE CHELOSTOMA FLORISOMNE (L.) (MEGACHILIDAE) AND ITS NEST PARASITE SAPYGA CLAVICORNIS (L.) (SAPYGIDAE) WERE STUDIED THROUGH CONTINUAL OBSERVATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS AND DISSECTIONS OF BEE NESTS. PROTECTION OF BEE OFFSPRING IS BASED ON (1) THE BEE'S DISCOVERY AND REMOVAL OF PARASITE EGGS DEPOSITED PRIOR TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A CELL CLOSURE, (2) MINIMISING THE TIME WHEN FULLY PROVISIONED CELLS MIGHT BE PARASITISED SUCCESSFULLY, AND (3) THE CONSTRUCTION OF EMPTY CELLS IN FRONT OF BROOD CELLS. 2. AN EMPTY CELL WAS FOUND IN FRONT OF 64.4\% OF ALL BROOD CELLS AND, IF THE OUTERMOST BROOD CELL IN A NEST WAS EXCLUDED, IN FRONT OF 74.3\% OF INNER BROOD CELLS. A VESTIBULE CLOSURE IS MOST OFTEN CONSTRUCTED IN FRONT OF THE OUTERMOST BROOD CELL. 3. FOLLOWING OVIPOSITION, THE BEE MADE ONLY FIVE FLIGHTS, WHICH TOGETHER LASTED 6-13 MIN, TO CONSTRUCT A CELL CLOSURE. A CELL CLOSURE DOES NOT PREVENT THE NEST PARASITE FROM OVIPOSITION INSIDE THE BROOD CELL, HOWEVER, AND PARASITE EGGS DEPOSITED THROUGH THE CELL CLOSURE ARE NOT DETECTED AND REMOVED BY THE BEE. ONLY AN ADDITIONAL CELL CLOSURE, I.E. THE FORMATION OF AN EMPTY CELL, MAY PROTECT A BROOD CELL WHEN THE BEE IS NOT IN THE NEST. THE NEST PARASITE OFTEN OVIPOSITED THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL CELL CLOSURE BUT ITS OFFSPRING WERE THEN TRAPPED IN THE EMPTY CELL AND STARVED TO DEATH. 4. ONLY 5.4\% OF THE INNER BROOD CELLS THAT WERE PROTECTED BY AN EMPTY CELL WERE PARASITISED, COMPARED WITH 28.9\% OF THOSE WITHOUT AN ANTERIOR, EMPTY CELL, 27.4\% OF THE EMPTY CELLS CONTAINED DEAD PARASITE OFFSPRING (EGGS AND LARVAE). THUS, THE EMPTY CELLS PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT PROTECTION AND, COMBINED WITH ADDITIONAL MEANS OF PROTECTION OF BROOD CELLS, LED TO A LOW DEGREE OF PARASITISM. MORE THAN 77\% OF THE WASP OFFSPRING DIED AT AN EARLY STAGE DUE TO INTRASPECIFIC INTERFERENCE COMPETITION WITHIN BROOD CELLS AND AS RESULT OF THE WASPS' OVIPOSITION INTO EMPTY CELLS.",CHELOSTOMA; EMPTY CELLS; INTERACTION; MORTALITY; NEST ARCHITECTURE; NEST PARASITE; PROTECTION; SAPYGA; SOLITARY BEE,HYMENOPTERA; APOIDEA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,21,"MUNSTER-SWENDSEN, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV COPENHAGEN, DEPT POPULAT ECOL, UNIV PK 15, DK-2100 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.;UNIV COPENHAGEN, DEPT POPULAT ECOL, DK-2100 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.",10.1046/J.1365-2311.2000.00225.X,"P O BOX 88, OSNEY MEAD, OXFORD OX2 0NE, OXON, ENGLAND",NA,NA,NA,0307-6946,1,63-70,BLACKWELL SCIENCE LTD,25,2000,ISI000085508700008,20,ENTOMOLOGY,21,ENTOMOLOGY,NA,287MB,"MUNSTER-SWENDSEN, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV COPENHAGEN, DEPT POPULAT ECOL, UNIV PK 15, DK-2100 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK",ISI,none,UNIV COPENHAGEN,UNIV COPENHAGEN,NA,"MUNSTER-SWENDSEN M, 2000, ECOL ENTOMOL","MUNSTER-SWENDSEN M, 2000, ECOL ENTOMOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

USING MODEL PLANTS AND MUTANT LINES DESCRIBED BY MOLECULAR GENETICS MAY CIRCUMVENT THIS DIFFICULTY. MUTATION OF GENES CONTROLLING PETAL COLOUR AND PETAL EPIDERMAL CELL SHAPE IN ANTIRRHINUM MAJUS WAS PREVIOUSLY SHOWN TO INFLUENCE FRUIT SET. WHITE FLOWERS SET LESS FRUIT THAN MAGENTA FLOWERS AND MUTANTS WITH FLAT PETAL EPIDERMAL CELLS SET LESS FRUIT THAN FLOWERS WITH CONICAL CELLS. HERE WE ANALYSE THE CAUSAL PATHWAY UNDERLYING THIS PHENOMENON THROUGH A STUDY OF FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS AND BEE BEHAVIOUR. RESULTS INDICATE THAT BEES RECOGNIZED PLANTS WITH MAGENTA CONICAL-CELLED FLOWERS AT A DISTANCE AND DID NOT APPROACH WHITE FLOWERS OR MAGENTA FLAT-CELLED FLOWERS SO FREQUENTLY. PETAL CELL SHAPE INTERACTED WITH COLOUR IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN APPROACHING BEE LANDED ON A FLOWER WITHIN A PLOT AND WHETHER A BEE LANDING ON A FLOWER WOULD PROBE IT. THE INTRAFLORAL TEMPERATURE OF FLOWERS WITH CONICAL PETAL CELLS WAS SHOWN TO INCREASE WITH SOLAR IRRADIANCE, UNLIKE THE INTRAFLORAL TEMPERATURE OF FLOWERS WITH FLAT PETAL CELLS.

HETEROPHRAGMA QUNDRILORULARE IS A SELF-INCOMPATIBLE HERMAPHRODITIC TREE SOLELY POLLINATED AT NIGHT BY THE CARPENTER BEE XYLOCOPA (MESOTRICHIA) TENUISCAPA WESTWOOD, WHOSE POLLINATING FLIGHTS WERE LUNAR INSENSITIVE AND UNAFFECTED BY LOW NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES (2-14 DEGREESC). THE NUMBER OF CARPENTER BEES VISITING A TREE PER MINUTE AND THE NUMBER OF BOWERS VISITED PER FORAGING BOUT WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE SIZE OF THE BORA DISPLAY.

ECOL.,"FOOD-DECEPTIVE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY ANIMALS THAT EXPECT A REWARD BUT ARE CHEATED. SUCH PLANTS PROFIT FROM THEIR SIMILARITY TO REWARDING PLANTS AND SHOULD DEVELOP SIGNALS THAT HINDER DISCRIMINATION. WE USE ARTIFICIAL REWARDING MODEL FLOWERS AND NONREWARDING MIMICKING FLOWERS THAT PRESENT SIMILAR VISUAL CUES. WE TEST HOW ADDITIONAL SCENT CUES CHANGE FLOWER CHOICE OF THE MIMIC BY BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) IN TWO SITUATIONS: (1) BOTH FLOWER TYPES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENT AND CAN BE COMPARED BY THE POLLINATOR, AND (2) BOTH FLOWER TYPES ARE ENCOUNTERED SUCCESSIVELY IN THE ABSENCE OF EACH OTHER. WE FIND THAT IN SITUATION 1, DISCRIMINATION LEARNING IS GREATER IF SCENTS ARE USED AS CUES FOR IDENTIFYING THE MIMIC, WHETHER THE MIMIC HAS A DIFFERENT SCENT OR IF IT IS SCENTLESS WHILE THE MODEL IS SCENTED, IN SITUATION 2, A GENERALIZATION TASK, A SCENTED MIMIC IS AVOIDED FASTER THAN A SCENTLESS ONE. DISCRIMINATION OF THE MIMIC IS POOREST IF IT HAS THE SAME SCENT AS THE MODEL, THUS DEMONSTRATING A POTENTIAL FOR SCENT MIMIC, WHICH HAS NOR YET BEEN PROVED TO EXIST AMONG DIFFERENTLY REWARDING FLOWERS. THUS, THE BEST STRATEGY FOR A MIMIC WOULD BE TO HAVE THE SAME SCENT AS THE MODEL, BUT THIS STRATEGY MAY NOT BE USED DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY CONSTRAINTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL MODELS, THEN HAVING NO SCENT WOULD BE A BETTER STRATEGY THAN MIMICKING JUST ONE OF THE MODELS. IN SITUATION 1 FLOWER DISCRIMINATION BY COLOR CUES IS ENHANCED IN THE MERE PRESENCE OF SCENT, COMPARED TO UNSCENTED CONTROLS, EVEN IF THE SCENT DOES NOT PROVIDE A DISTINGUISHABLE CUE ITSELF.

BEES ARE BELIEVED TO BE DOMINANT POLLEN VECTORS IN TROPICAL FORESTS, YET STUDIES SPECIFIC TO BEES IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA ARE RARE. REGENERATION AND RESTORATION OF THE RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING LOWLAND FORESTS OF THIS REGION ARE RELIANT ON BEES, THUS THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR FOREST BEE DATA AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. 2. BEE COMMUNITIES OF EIGHT FORESTED SITES IN JOHOR (MALAYSIA) AND SINGAPORE WERE SURVEYED THREE TIMES EACH FROM FEBRUARY TO AUGUST 1999 AT THE BELOW-CANOPY LEVEL. THESE SITES RANGED FROM RELATIVELY UNDISTURBED PRIMARY LOWLAND DIPTEROCARP FORESTS TO LATE SECONDARY FORESTS AND EXOTIC FORESTS, INCLUDING AN OIL PALM PLANTATION. WE ATTEMPTED TO ELUCIDATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT CORRELATED WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF BEES. 3. BEE ABUNDANCE, IN PARTICULAR THAT OF APIDAE, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN LARGER PRIMARY FORESTS THAN OTHER TYPES OF FORESTS. HOWEVER, BEE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS HIGHER IN DISTURBED FORESTS. 4. THE DISTRIBUTION OF BEES WAS APPARENTLY INFLUENCED BY VARIABLES CLOSELY RELATED TO FOREST DISTURBANCE AND RESOURCE ABUNDANCE, SUCH AS THE DENSITY OF BIG TREES (DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT 30-40 CM), TEMPERATURE AND FLOWERING INTENSITY OF TREES AND SHRUBS. 5. MORE STINGLESS BEES (TRIGONA SPP.) WERE FOUND WHERE TREES WERE LARGER AND AMBIENT CONDITIONS MORE CONSTANT BUT FLOWERING INTENSITIES LOWER. 6. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BEE COMMUNITIES IN FORESTS OF URBAN SINGAPORE AND PRIMARY FORESTS IN JOHOR MAY INDICATE THAT ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IN THE FORESTS OF SINGAPORE, IN PARTICULAR POLLINATION, MAY BE CHANGING. HOWEVER, POLLINATION MAY NOT BE TOTALLY INTACT IN THE PRIMARY FORESTS SURVEYED, AS THEIR BEE COMMUNITIES SEEMED TO BE DEPAUPERATE. 7. THE ROLE OF IMPORTANT POLLINATORS, ESPECIALLY BEES, FOR THE LONG-TERM SURVIVAL OF TROPICAL LOWLAND FORESTS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD.

MANY ASPECTS OF THE NESTING BEHAVIOR OF FEMALES OF THIS SPECIES ARE DESCRIBED, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: DIURNAL FLIGHT PERIOD, SLEEPING HABITS, NEST STRUCTURE, NEST PROVISIONING, EGG PLACEMENT, AND SEQUENCE OF NEST CONSTRUCTION, PROVISIONING, AND OVIPOSITION. EGGS PRODUCED BY THIS SPECIES ARE CATEGORIZED AS ``GIANT (K. IWATA AND S.F. SAKAGAMI. 1966. GIGANTISM AND DWARFISM IN BEE EGGS IN RELATION TO THE MODE OF LIFE, WITH NOTES ON THE NUMBER OF OVARIOLES. JAPANESE JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY 16: 4-16). ITS FIRST INSTAR WAS DISCOVERED TO BE PHARATE WITHIN THE CHORION WHILE THE FOLLOWING FOUR INSTARS ACTIVELY FEED. DEFECATION STARTS EARLY IN THE LAST LARVAL STADIUM. FEMALES USE FLORAL OILS BOTH IN NEST CONSTRUCTION AND IN PROVISIONING, AND THEY CARRY POLLEN, OIL, AND SOIL WITH THEIR SCOPAE. THE BIOLOGY OF T. DIVERSIPES WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF OTHER SPECIES IN THE GENUS AND THEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF OTHER APINES THAT ARE KNOWN TO NEST IN PREFORMED CAVITIES AND THAT PROVISION NESTS WITH POLLEN AND FLORAL OILS. THE HOST-NEST SEARCHING BEHAVIOR OF COELIOXOIDES WALTHERIAE IS DESCRIBED. THE CLEPTOPARASITE INTRODUCES ITS EGG INTO THE CLOSED CELL OF THE HOST SHORTLY AFTER CELL CLOSURE. THIS EGG IS CHARACTERIZED AS ``SMALL (IWATA AND SAKAGAMI, IBID.) AND HAS A VERY SHORT INCUBATION PERIOD. THE HIGHLY MODIFIED FIRST INSTAR IMMEDIATELY FEEDS ON THE HOST EGG AND GROWS REMARKABLY FAST ON THE HOST YOLK. THIS SPECIES HAS ONLY FOUR INSTARS. RATES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOST AND CLEPTOPARASITE ARE COMPARED. BOTH HAVE FOUR OVARIOLES PER OVARY. EGGS, FIRST INSTARS, LAST LARVAL INSTARS, AND PUPAE OF HOST AND CLEPTOPARASITE ARE TAXONOMICALLY DESCRIBED AND COMPARED. IN CONCLUSION, THE IMMATURES OF COELIOXOIDES AND TETRAPEDIA ARE QUITE DISTINCT FROM THOSE OF OTHER KNOWN APIDS.

DAVIS CC,DAVIS CC,MADAGASIKARIA (MALPIGHIACEAE): A NEW GENUS FROM MADAGASCAR WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR FLORAL EVOLUTION IN MALPIGHIACEAE,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,AM. J. BOT.,"MADAGASIKARIA ANDERSONII IS DESCRIBED HERE AS A NEW GENUS AND SPECIES OF MALPIGHIACEAE FROM MADAGASCAR. THE PHYLOGENETIC PLACEMENT OF MADAGASIKARIA WAS ESTIMATED BY USING COMBINED DATA FROM NDHF AND TRNL-F CHLOROPLAST SEQUENCES AND PHYTOCHROME (PHYC) AND ITS NUCLEAR SEQUENCES. IT FORMS A STRONGLY SUPPORTED CLADE WITH THE MALAGASY ENDEMIC GENERA RHYNCHOPHORA AND MICROSTEIRA. DESPITE NEARLY IDENTICAL FLORAL MORPHOLOGY AMONG SPECIES IN THIS ELUDE (HERE CALLED THE MADAGASIKARIOID CLADE), THESE GENERA ARE EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR FRUITS, THE SCHIZOCARPIC FRUITS OF MADAGASIKARIA HAVE DISTINCTIVE MERICARPS. EACH MERICARP HAS A LATERAL WING, WHICH COMPLETELY ENCIRCLES THE NUT, AND A PECULIAR DORSAL WING, WHICH FOLDS OVER ON ITSELF. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THIS FRUIT SUGGESTS THAT THE HOMOLOGY OF THE UNUSUAL WING IN RHYNCNOPHORA IS LATERAL IN NATURE AND REPRESENTS A REDUCED WING SIMILAR TO THE LATERAL WING IN MADAGASIKARIA. TAXA IN THE MADAGASIKARIOID CLADE ALL APPEAR TO BE MORPHOLOGICALLY ANDRODIOECIOUS AND FUNCTIONALLY DIOECIOUS, PRODUCING BOTH STAMINATE AND ``BISEXUAL (I.E., FUNCTIONALLY CARPELIATE) INDIVIDUALS. THIS CONDITION APPEARS TO BE EXCEEDINGLY RARE IN FLOWERING PLANTS AND HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR FLORAL EVOLUTION WITHIN MALPIGHIACCAE. NEOTROPICAL MALPIGHIACEAE ARE POLLINATED BY SPECIALIZED OIL-COLLECTING ANTHOPHORINE BEES OF THE TRIBE CENTRIDINI AND EXHIBIT HIGHLY CONSERVED FLORAL MORPHOLOGY DESPITE TREMENDOUS DIVERSITY IN FRUIT MORPHOLOGY AND HABIT.

SINGER RB,SINGER RB,THE POLLINATION MECHANISM IN TRIGONIDIUM OBTUSUM LINDL (ORCHIDACEAE : MAXILLARIINAE): SEXUAL MIMICRY AND TRAP-FLOWERS,ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"THE POLLINATION PROCESS IN TRIGONIDIUM OBTUSUM LINDL. (EPIDENDROIDEAE: MAXILLARIINAE) IS DOCUMENTED. THE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY SEXUALLY EXCITED DRONES OF PLEBEIA DRORYANA (MELIPONINAE). WHEN ATTEMPTING TO COPULATE EITHER WITH SEPALS OR PETALS, THESE BEES SLIP ON THE WAXY PERIANTH SURFACE AND BECOME TRAPPED IN THE FUNNEL-LIKE FLOWER TUBE, BEES TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM THE FLOWERS MAY INSTEAD ACCESS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE COLUMN AND LIP, FIXING THE POLLINARIUM ON THEIR SCUTELLUM. POLLINARIUM-BEARING BEES MAY POLLINATE THE FLOWERS WHEN REPEATING THE ABOVE-MENTIONED STEPS, LEAVING POLLINIA ON THE CONCAVE STIGMATIC SURFACE, THUS EFFECTING POLLINATION. RECENTLY REMOVED POLLINARIA ARE TOO BROAD TO ENTER THE STIGMA BUT THEY BEGIN TO DEHYDRATE AND WITHIN 40 MIN OF REMOVAL ARE SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT THE STIGMATIC CAVITY. THIS MECHANISM PREVENTS INSECT-MEDIATED SELF-POLLINATION AND PROMOTES CROSS-POLLINATION. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE BASED ON EXPERIMENTS WITH CULTIVATED PLANTS SUGGESTS THAT THEY ARE SELF-COMPATIBLE BUT THAT FRUIT SET IS POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT. THE DATA OBTAINED ARE DISCUSSED IN A PHYLOGENETIC CONTEXT. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE PSEUDOCOPULATORY SYNDROME IN TRIGONIDIUM COULD HAVE EVOLVED FROM REWARDLESS (FOOD ADVERTISING) ANCESTORS. PSEUDOCOPULATION IN THE CONTEXT OF THE LONG FLOWERING PERIOD OF THIS ORCHID SPECIES (ABOUT 7 MONTHS) IS UNDERSTANDABLE SINCE THE EUSOCIAL PLEBEIA BEES PRODUCE FERTILE INDIVIDUALS SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR.

RESIDUAL ANALYSIS OF BLOSSOM CLASSES ACCORDING TO THE LEPPIK SYSTEM SHOWED THAT: POLYPHILOUS FLOWERS ARE PLEOMORPHIC AND STEREOMORPHIC, POLYPHILOUS INFLORESCENCES ARE HAPLOMORPHIC, MONOPHILOUS FLOWERS ARE ZYGOMORPHIC, AND ANEMOPHILOUS INFLORESCENCES ARE AMORPHIC. PLEOMORPHIC FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BEES, FLIES, AND WASPS, STEREOMORPHIC FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BEES, BUTTERFLIES, MOTHS, BIRDS, AND BATS, ZYGOMORPHIC FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BEES, AND BEETLES, AND AMORPHIC INFLORESCENCES ARE WIND- AND BEETLE-POLLINATED SPECIES. RESIDUAL ANALYSIS OF BLOSSOM CLASSES ACCORDING TO THE FAEGRI \& VAN DER PIJL SYSTEM SHOWED THAT: POLYPHILOUS FLOWERS ARE MOSTLY DISH-, BELL-, AND TUBE-BLOSSOM TYPES, MONOPHILOUS FLOWERS ARE FLAG-, GULLET-, AND TRAP-BLOSSOM TYPES, AND INFLORESCENCE ANEMOPHILOUS ARE BRUSH-BLOSSOM TYPE. DISH-FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BEES, FLIES, AND WASPS, TUBE-FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BUTTERFLIES, MOTHS, AND BIRDS, FLAG- AND GULLET-FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY BEES-, BRUSH-INFLORESCENCES ARE POLLINATED BY WIND, AND TRAP-INFLORESCENCES ARE POLLINATED BY BEETLES. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN BLOSSOM TYPES (LEPPIK VS.

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS ERYNGIUM ALPINUM (APIACEAE) IS AN ENDANGERED PERENNIAL, CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ALPINE FLORA. BECAUSE THE BREEDING SYSTEM INFLUENCES BOTH DEMOGRAPHIC (REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS) AND GENETIC (INBREEDING DEPRESSION. EVOLUTIONARY POTENTIAL) PARAMETERS THAT ARE CRUCIAL FOR POPULATION MAINTENANCE, THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF E. ALPINUM WAS INVESTIGATED. SPECIFICALLY, THE AIMS OF THE STUDY WERE (1) TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS (RESOURCES AND/OR POLLEN) LIMITING PLANT FITNESS, AND (2) TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL FOR GENE FLOW WITHIN A PLANT, WITHIN A PATCH OF PLANTS, AND ACROSS A WHOLE VALLEY WHERE THE SPECIES IS ABUNDANT. METHODS FIELD EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT TWO SITES IN THE FOURNEL VALLEY, FRANCE, OVER THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS. STUDIES INCLUDED A PHENOLOGICAL SURVEY, OBSERVATIONS OF POLLINATORS (VISITATION RATES AND FLIGHT DISTANCES), DISPERSAL OF A FLUORESCENT POWDER USED AS A POLLEN ANALOGUE, THE USE OF SEED TRAPS, DETERMINATION OF THE POLLEN/OVULE RATIO. AND AN EXPERIMENT TO TEST WHETHER SEED PRODUCTION IS LIMITED BY POLLEN AND/OR BY RESOURCES. KEY RESULTS E. ALPINUM IS POLLINATED BY GENERALIST POLLINATORS, VISITATION RATES ARE VERY HIGH AND SEED SET IS RESOURCE-RATHER THAN POLLEN-LIMITED. THE SHORT FLIGHTS OF HONEYBEES INDICATE A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR GEITONOGAMY, AND LOW POLLEN AND SEED DISPERSALS SUGGEST STRONG GENETIC STRUCTURE OVER SHORT DISTANCES. THESE RESULTS ARE INTERPRETED IN THE LIGHT OF PREVIOUS MOLECULAR MARKERS STUDIES, WHICH, IN CONTRAST, SHOWED COMPLETE OUTCROSSING AND HIGH GENETIC HOMOGENEITY. CONCLUSIONS. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE USEFULNESS OF ADOPTING SEVERAL COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC PROCESSES AT WORK IN NATURAL POPULATIONS. AND THE CONSERVATION IMPLICATIONS FOR E. ALPINUM ARE EMPHASIZED. ALTHOUGH THE STUDIED POPULATIONS DO NOT SEEM THREATENED IN THE NEAR FUTURE, LONG-TERM MONITORING APPEARS NECESSARY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF HABITAT FRAGMENTATION.

TRADITIONALLY, LOSSES IN PLANT FITNESS OR YIELD RESULTING FROM INSECT DAMAGE HAVE BEEN REDRESSED BY REDUCING PEST POPULATIONS USING INSECTICIDES OR BIOCONTROL, THESE APPROACHES RELY ON THE UNTESTED ASSUMPTION THAT REDUCED PLANT FITNESS OR YIELD IS CAUSED BY DIMINISHED RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO DAMAGED PLANTS. 2. BY EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATING POLLINATION AND DAMAGE LEVELS INDEPENDENTLY, IT IS SHOWN THAT POLLINATION, AS WELL AS LACK OF RESOURCES, MAY BE LIMITING TO DAMAGED PLANTS IN A MODEL INSECT-POLLINATED CROP, CANTALOUPE. 3. WITH ENHANCED POLLINATION, DAMAGED PLANTS PRODUCE AS MUCH FRUIT AS UNDAMAGED PLANTS, EVEN UNDER HIGH DAMAGE LEVELS. IN CONTRAST, DAMAGED PLANTS WITHOUT SUPPLEMENTAL POLLINATION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FRUIT THAN UNDAMAGED PLANTS. 4. THIS APPROACH IS UNIQUE IN SHIFTING THE FOCUS AWAY FROM REDUCING PEST POPULATIONS AND TOWARD ENHANCING MUTUALISTIC INTERACTIONS. IT AVOIDS RISKS POSED BY INSECTICIDES (WHICH ALSO KILL POLLINATORS) AND BY BIOCONTROL AGENTS, KNOWN THREATS TO NATIVE SPECIES. 5.

A STANDARDIZED METHOD WAS EMPLOYED TO SAMPLE THE BEES, WHICH HAD BEEN USED PREVIOUSLY IN 1996 IN THE SAME TREE POPULATIONS AT THE SAME TWO SITES (FRANKIE ET AL., 1997). RESULTS OF THE 1999 SAMPLES WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE TAKEN IN 1996 TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN BEE DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE. DURING THIS THREE-YEAR PERIOD, EL NINO AND LA NINA CLIMATIC EVENTS HAD OCCURRED BACK-TO-BACK, AND THIS COMBINATION OF WEATHER PATTERNS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN THE BEE TAXA THAT USE A. INERMIS AS ONE OF THEIR PREFERRED HOST PLANTS. OTHER BEE HOST PLANTS AT BOTH SITES WERE ALSO SURVEYED FOR SEASONAL FLOWERING, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORMED A BROADER CONTEXT FOR ASSESSING THE A.

RECENT CLASSIFICATIONS FAVOR SUBGENERA DELIMITED BY SIMILARITY IN LEAF ARRANGEMENT, ON THE BASIS OF THE PREMISE THAT COROLLA MORPHOLOGY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION, RESULTING IN THE CONVERGENT EVOLUTION OF SPECIALIZED FLORAL FORMS FROM GENERALIZED ANCESTORS. IN THIS STUDY, MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF PEDICULARIS REVEALS A LOW CONCORDANCE OF ROBUST CLADE SUPPORT AND TAXONOMIC GROUPS.

ONE OBSERVATION IS THAT FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS OF SPECIES' BODY SIZE COMMONLY EXHIBIT A RIGHT-SKEW, EVEN ON A LOGARITHMIC SCALE. HERE WE EXAMINE THE SPECIES' BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS IN TWO ASSEMBLAGES OF LARGE COSTA RICAN MOTHS. WE FIND THAT NEITHER ADULT SPHINGIDAE OR SATURNIIDAE EXHIBIT THE CLASSIC LOG RIGHT-SKEWED PATTERN. FURTHERMORE, THE SPECIES' BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS IN THESE TWO GROUPS ARE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT, WHICH WE SUGGEST IS A RESULT OF DIFFERENTIAL SELECTIVE PRESSURES RELATED TO RESOURCE AND MATE ACQUISITION. FOR SPHINGIDAE, WE SHOW (1) THAT BODY SIZE IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH TONGUE LENGTH, AND (2) THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPHINGID BODY SIZES/TONGUE LENGTHS CLOSELY MATCHES THE DISTRIBUTION OF FLOWER COROLLA TUBE DEPTHS IN SPHINGID-POLLINATED PLANTS. THUS, MORPHOLOGICAL FITTING BETWEEN PLANTS AND POLLINATORS SEEMS TO UNDERLIE THE SPECIES' BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPHINGID ASSEMBLAGE. WE DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE RESULTS IN THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT THEORY ON MECHANISMS DRIVING SPECIES' BODY SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS.

THUS, THE BEES APPEAR TO RELY ON THE ``HONEST'' CORRELATION BETWEEN ADVERTISEMENT AND REWARD IN CHOOSING THE BEST BLOSSOMS TO VISIT, AND THIS BEHAVIOR GENERATES DIRECT SELECTION FOR LARGER BRACTS AND INDIRECT SELECTION FOR LARGER RESIN GLANDS. BEES VISITING BLOSSOMS WITH LARGER SEPARATION BETWEEN THE GLAND AND STIGMAS CONTACTED THE STIGMAS LESS FREQUENTLY, AND SUCH BLOSSOMS RECEIVED LESS POLLEN ON THEIR STIGMAS.

PROPAGATION OF THESE BEES FROM 1 YR TO THE NEXT HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY HAMPERED BY CHALKBROOD, A LARVAL DISEASE CAUSED BY THE FUNGUS ASCOSPHAERA AGGREGATA SKOU. IN THE UNITED STATES, ATTEMPTS TO CONTROL THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN FAIRLY UNSUCCESSFUL, BUT INCLUDE REMOVING NESTS FROM THE NESTING BOARDS AND THEN DISINFECTING THE BOARDS WITH HEAT TREATMENTS OR A FUMIGANT. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY BOARDS ARE MADE OF POLYSTYRENE (SO HEAT CANNOT BE USED), AND VERY FEW FUMIGANTS ARE REGISTERED FOR THIS USE. IN THIS STUDY, OZONE WAS TESTED AS A FUMIGANT AND COMPARED WITH HEAT TREATMENTS AND METHYL BROMIDE FUMIGATION. OZONE WAS FOUND TO BE INADEQUATE FOR KILLING A. AGGREGATA SPORES AND FOR REDUCING CHALKBROOD LEVELS IN THE FIELD. METHYL BROMIDE AND HEAT TREATMENTS DID GREATLY REDUCE SPORE VIABILITY IN THE BOARDS, BUT DID NOT REDUCE CHALKBROOD LEVELS IN THE FIELD. SURPRISINGLY, LARVAE IN NEW NESTING BOARDS (BOARDS FREE OF CONTAMINATION) AND CHALKBROOD INFECTION LEVELS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE FROM NESTS IN CONTAMINATED, USED BOARDS. DISINFECTING NESTING BOARDS MAY BE NECESSARY FOR CONTROLLING CHALKBROOD, BUT THE RESULTS REPORTED HERE INDICATE THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT IN AND OF ITSELF.

I QUANTIFIED THE LOCAL ABUNDANCE OF FLOWERING CONSPECIFICS AT INDIVIDUAL-BASED SPATIAL SCALES AND AT A POPULATION-BASED SPATIAL SCALE. REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT POLLEN LIMITATION INCREASED WHILE SEED SET AND FECUNDITY DECREASED WITH ISOLATION OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. ISOLATION, DEFINED AS THE DISTANCE TO THE KTH NEAREST FLOWERING CONSPECIFIC, WAS A GOOD PREDICTOR OF POLLEN LIMITATION, FOR ALL NEAREST NEIGHBORS CONSIDERED (K=1-33), BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE RELATIONSHIP, AS QUANTIFIED BY R-2, PEAKED AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES (K=2-18). THE RELATIONSHIP OF ISOLATION TO SEED SET AND FECUNDITY WAS SIMILARLY STRONGEST AT INTERMEDIATE SCALES (K=3-4). THE SCALE DEPENDENCE OF INDIVIDUAL DENSITY EFFECTS ON REPRODUCTION (DENSITY OF FLOWERING PLANTS WITHIN X METERS) RESEMBLED THAT OF ISOLATION. ANALYSES AT A POPULATION-BASED SCALE SHOWED THAT POLLEN LIMITATION DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH POPULATION SIZE. SEED SET AND FECUNDITY ALSO DECLINED WITH POPULATION SIZE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY SO ONLY IN 1998. WHETHER QUANTIFYING LOCAL ABUNDANCE WITH POPULATION- OR INDIVIDUAL-BASED MEASURES, REPRODUCTIVE FAILURE DUE TO POLLEN LIMITATION IS A CONSISTENT CONSEQUENCE OF ECHINACEA SCARCITY.

TO DETERMINE THE LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS THAT FACILITATE THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM, GRID-BASED OBSERVATION RECORDS WERE ANALYSED IN A GIS ENVIRONMENT AT A REGIONAL SCALE. A SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVE EFFECT OF THE NUMBER OF TREES ON THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM AND A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE ONE OF THE PROPORTION OF ARABLE LAND, STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SPECIES' PREFERENCE FOR OPEN LANDSCAPES. YET, APART FROM OPEN LANDSCAPES ADDITIONAL LANDSCAPE FEATURES WERE SHOWN TO BE IMPORTANT. A SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVE EFFECT OF DITCHES IN THE FINAL MODEL REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LANDSCAPE ELEMENT FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF B. MUSCORUM. THIS FINDING WAS ADDITIONALLY SUPPORTED BY RECORDINGS OF NEST-SEARCHING QUEENS, NESTS, AND FLOWER VISITS ALONG DITHES. THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF CLOVER AND FALLOW LAND INDICATE THE SPECIES' NEED FOR SUITABLE FOOD RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON. BECAUSE B.

SOC.,"THE PRESENT RESEARCH REPRESENTS THE FIRST DESCRIPTION OF A VESPIDAE SPECIES SPERMATOZOON. IN AGELAIA VICINA, THE SPERM HEAD IS COMPOSED OF AN ACROSOME AND A NUCLEUS. THE ACROSOME CONSISTS OF AN ACROSOMAL VESICLE, OVAL SHAPED IN CROSS SECTIONS, AND A PERFORATORIUM, THAT PROJECTS INTO THE ANTERIOR NUCLEAR REGION. THE NUCLEUS IS ELONGATED AND OVAL SHAPED IN CROSS SECTIONS. THE NUCLEUS-FLAGELLUM TRANSITION REGION INCLUDES THE CENTRIOLAR ADJUNCT, THE NUCLEUS BASE AND THE ANTERIOR PORTIONS OF THE AXONEME AND OF THE LARGE MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE. THE CENTRIOLAR ADJUNCT BEGINS AS A THIN LAYER BETWEEN THE NUCLEUS AND THE LARGE MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE, WHILE JUST BELOW IT ACQUIRES A LATERAL EXTENSION PARTIALLY SURROUNDING THE LARGE MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE. IN ITS MEDIAL PORTION, IT IS TRIANGULAR SHAPED, SITUATED LATERALLY TO THE AXONEME AND THE LARGE MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE, AND IT FINISHES IN CONTACT WITH THE TIP OF THE SMALL MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE. THE FLAGELLUM IS COMPOSED OF A 9 + 9 + 2 AXONEME, TWO MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVES AND TWO ACCESSORY BODIES. THE LARGE MITOCHONDRIAL DERIVATIVE BEGINS LATERALLY TO THE NUCLEAR BASE, AND THE SMALL ONE BELOW THE CENTRIOLAR ADJUNCT.

IN THIS PAPER WE EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF FLOWER DAMAGE AND POLLINATION BY THE HUMMINGBIRD OREOTROCHILUS LEUCOPLEURUS ON THE FECUNDITY OF THE ANDEAN MONKEY FLOWER MIMULUS LUTEUS. WE PERFORMED A 2X2 FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT, WITH ARTIFICIAL CLIPPING OF LOWER PETALS AND SELECTIVE EXCLUSION OF THE HUMMINGBIRD AS MAIN FACTORS. IN SPITE OF THE RELATIVELY LOW PROPORTION (27.5\%) OF THE VARIANCE IN SEED PRODUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FULL FACTORIAL MODEL, ARTIFICIAL DAMAGE AND HUMMINGBIRD EXCLUSION, AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTION, WERE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT, INDICATING NONADDITIVE EFFECTS OF FACTORS ON PLANT FECUNDITY. IN THE PRESENCE OF HUMMINGBIRDS, UNDAMAGED FLOWERS HAD A SEED PRODUCTION THAT WAS 1.7-FOLD HIGHER THAN FOR DAMAGED FLOWERS, SUGGESTING THAT THE EFFECT OF FLOWER DAMAGE ON FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OCCURS PROBABLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HUMMINGBIRD DISCRIMINATION AGAINST DAMAGED COROLLAS. THIS RESULT INDICATES THAT THE IMPACT OF FLOWER HERBIVORY ON PLANT FECUNDITY WAS CONTINGENT ON THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF HUMMINGBIRDS, SUGGESTING THAT POLLINATORS MAY INDIRECTLY SELECT FOR UNDAMAGED AND PROBABLY RESISTANT FLOWER PHENOTYPES. A SECOND INTERACTION EFFECT REVEALED THAT UNDAMAGED FLOWERS PRODUCED 78.5\% MORE SEEDS IN THE ABSENCE OF RATHER THAN IN THE PRESENCE OF O. LEUCOPLEURUS, RAISING THE QUESTION OF THE ECOLOGICAL MECHANISM INVOLVED. WE SUGGEST THAT THE STRONG TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR EXHIBITED BY THE BEE CENTRIS NIGERRIMA MAY CONFINE THE FORAGING ACTIVITIES OF THE REMAINING BEE SPECIES TO SAFE SITES WITHIN EXCLOSURES.

THE CHARACTER OF THE PALYNOLOGICAL SPECTRUM DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THAT OF A BURIED SOIL WITHIN THE SAME BURIAL MOUND. IN THE SAMPLES TAKEN FROM THE POTS, POLLEN CONCENTRATION IS VERY HIGH, POLLEN GRAINS ARE PERFECTLY PRESERVED AND AN ABUNDANCE OF POLLEN FROM INSECT- POLLINATED PLANTS IS RECORDED. IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THESE FEATURES ARE PECULIAR TO HONEY PALYNOSPECTRA. IN ALL THREE POTS THE POLLEN OF ROSACEAE, A FAMILY OF PLANTS THAT PRODUCE GOOD HONEY, IS DOMINANT. HOWEVER, THE SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MOST DOMINANT POLLEN TYPES IN ALL THREE SAMPLES ARE DIFFERENT. FOR EXAMPLE, TILIA POLLEN IS THE SECOND DOMINANT IN ONLY ONE POT. IN THE SECOND POT, APIACEAE AND POACEAE ARE PREDOMINANT, AND IN THE THIRD POT, POACEAE, BOTH WILD AND CULTURAL, IS THE SECOND DOMINANT.

ECOL.,"WHILE MANY PLANT SPECIES OFFER REWARDS (E.G. NECTAR) TO POLLINATORS, SOME SPECIES, PARTICULARLY IN ORCHIDS, DO NOT PROVIDE REWARDS. ECOLOGICAL FACTORS, SUCH AS INTERACTIONS WITH REWARDING CO-FLOWERING SPECIES MAY AFFECT POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES TO SUCH DECEPTIVE SPECIES BY INFLUENCING POLLINATOR ABILITY TO LEARN TO AVOID DECEPTIVE PLANTS (AVOIDANCE LEARNING). WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF FLOWER COLOUR SIMILARITY (SIMILAR VS DISSIMILAR) AND FINE-SCALE SPATIAL MINGLING (MONOSPECIFIC VS HETEROSPECIFIC PATCHES) OF REWARDING AND DECEPTIVE ARTIFICIAL PLANTS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION IN A FULLY CROSSED DESIGN. WE ALSO EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF THESE FACTORS ON LEARNING OF INITIALLY NAIVE BUMBLEBEES. OVER TIME, BUMBLEBEES INCREASINGLY AVOIDED THE DECEPTIVE PLANTS, BUT AT A SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER RATE WHEN DECEPTIVE AND REWARDING PLANTS HAD DISSIMILAR FLOWER COLOURS THAN WHEN THEY WERE SIMILAR. DECEPTIVE PLANTS RECEIVED MORE VISITS WHEN MINGLED IN HETEROSPECIFIC PATCHES WITH REWARDING PLANTS OF SIMILAR FLOWER COLOUR THAN WHEN MINGLED WITH DISSIMILAR ONES. THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT WHEN REWARDING AND DECEPTIVE PLANTS WERE SPATIALLY SEPARATED IN MONOSPECIFIC PATCHES. IN CONCLUSION, BOTH SPATIAL MINGLING AND FLOWER COLOUR SIMILARITY AFFECTED POLLINATOR VISITATION TO AND AVOIDANCE LEARNING OF DECEPTIVE PLANTS.

SIN.,"TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISM BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND POLLINATORS IN VIBURNUM, THIS PAPER REPORTS REPRODUCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF VIBURNUM MACROCEPHALUM F. KETELEERI, INCLUDING FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS, ANATOMICAL FEATURES OF REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS, POLLEN VIABILITY, POLLEN/OVULE RATIO (P/O), POLLINATORS, POLLEN TUBE GROWTH PATH, BREEDING SYSTEM, AND FERTILIZATION. THIS SPECIES POSSESSES A COMPOUND UMBEL INCLUDING FERTILE AND INFERTILE FLOWERS. THE FERTILE FLOWER HAS ONE PISTIL AND FIVE STAMENS, EACH PISTIL HAS A DRY STIGMA AND AN OVARY THAT CONTAINS ONE ANATROPOUS OVULE. THE STAMENS AND PISTILS OF THE INFERTILE FLOWER ARE NORMAL INITIALLY BUT DEGENERATE LATER DURING FLOWERING, DEGENERATED STAMENS ARE MAINLY CHARACTERIZED BY DISAPPEARANCE OF STAMENS, SHORT FILAMENTS, ABSENCE OF FILAMENTS, OR DIFFERENT SIZE OF ANTHERS, WHEREAS DEGENERATED PISTILS HAVE SMALLER OR RUPTURED STIGMAS, OCCASIONALLY, PISTILS AND STAMENS BECOME PETAL-LIKE. POLLEN VIABILITY OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY 4-5 D AFTER POLLEN DISSEMINATION. WITHIN POPULATION, POLLEN VIABILITY OF ALL FLOWERS RAPIDLY DECREASED AT THE END OF APRIL. POLLEN/OVULE RATIO (P/O) WAS 12800-18700. POLLINATORS FOR THIS SPECIES INCLUDE BEES, FLIES, BUTTERFLIES AND BEETLES, BUT BEES AND BUTTERFLIES ARE THE MAIN ONES. ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION TREATMENTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS SPECIES WAS SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND SEED PRODUCTION DEPENDED ON POLLINATOR VISITS. POLLEN DISSEMINATION OF FERTILE FLOWERS MAINLY OCCURRED DURING 9:00 AM-4:00 PM, AND THE PEAK OF POLLINATOR VISITS WAS 11:00 AM-3:00 PM. POLLEN GRAINS USUALLY GERMINATED WITHIN I H AFTER POLLINATION AND POLLEN TUBES PENETRATED THE STIGMA THROUGH THE PAPILLA CLEARANCE AND THEN CONTINUED TO GROW ALONG THE TRANSMITTING TISSUE IN CENTER OF STYLE. SOME POLLEN TUBES REACHED THE OVARY 18 H LATER AND GREW INTO THE OVULE THROUGH MICROPYLE WITHIN 20 H AFTER POLLINATION.

FONTAINE C;COLLIN CL;DAJOZ I,FONTAINE C,GENERALIST FORAGING OF POLLINATORS: DIET EXPANSION AT HIGH DENSITY,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,J. ECOL.,"1. PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS ARE CRUCIAL FOR THE REPRODUCTION OF MOST ANGIOSPERMS. WHEN FACED WITH PERTURBATIONS, PLANT-POLLINATOR NETWORKS MIGHT BE ROBUST MAINLY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF HIGHLY GENERALIST SPECIES. PERTURBATIONS CAN, IN TURN, AFFECT HOW POLLINATORS EXPLOIT THEIR FOOD SOURCES AND THEREFORE THEIR DEGREE OF GENERALIZATION. 2. IN PARTICULAR, GENERALIZATION OF POLLINATORS MIGHT VARY WITH FORAGER DENSITY. AT HIGH DENSITIES FLORAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN PLANT COMMUNITIES WOULD BE MORE RAPIDLY DEPLETED THAN AT LOW DENSITIES. ACCORDING TO OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY (OFT), THIS DECREASE IN RESOURCES SHOULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN DIET BREADTH. 3. WE INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF POLLINATOR DENSITY ON DIET BREADTH OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. WE RECORDED THE INDIVIDUAL FORAGING BEHAVIOUR OF BUMBLEBEES FROM EIGHT COLONIES. THEY FORAGED IN PRESENCE OF EITHER ONE OR SEVERAL CONSPECIFICS ON EXPERIMENTAL PLANT COMMUNITIES COMPOSED OF FIVE PLANT SPECIES. DIET BREADTH WAS CALCULATED AS THE NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES VISITED, AS WELL AS BY THE LEVINS INDEX. WE ANALYZED THE EFFECT OF FORAGER DENSITY ON DIET BREADTH AT BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE COLONY LEVELS. 4. WE FOUND THAT FORAGER DENSITY AFFECTED DEGREE OF GENERALIZATION AT INDIVIDUAL AND COLONY LEVELS. A MORE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT INCREASED INDIVIDUAL GENERALIZATION, AS PREDICTED BY OFT, AND DECREASED THE VARIABILITY IN GENERALIZATION ACROSS COLONIES. MOREOVER, WE FOUND THAT BUMBLEBEE SIZE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE AMPLITUDE OF DIET BREADTH CHANGE. 5. SYNTHESIS.

ONE UNEXPLORED HYPOTHESIS SUGGESTS THAT TRANSITIONS TO ENVIRONMENTS WITH DIFFERENT LIGHT CONDITIONS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY TRANSITIONS IN POLLINATOR GUILD BECAUSE OF THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO A NEW POLLINATOR COMMUNITY AND THE DIFFERENT RELATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATOR ATTRACTION IN THE UNDERSTORY AND THE CANOPY. USING DATA FROM LITERATURE SURVEYS, WE COMPILED A DATA SET OF HABITAT LIGHT AVAILABILITY (E.G., CANOPY VS.

PHYLOGENETIC INDEPENDENT CONTRASTS WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DEGREE TO WHICH TRANSITIONS IN CANOPY POSITION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSITIONS IN THE USAGE OF PARTICULAR POLLINATORS AND POLLINATOR GUILD SIZE. WE FURTHER EXAMINED THE DEGREE TO WHICH EACH OF THESE TRAITS TENDS TO BE EVOLUTIONARILY LABILE VERSUS EVOLUTIONARILY CONSERVED.

HOPWOOD JL,HOPWOOD JL,THE CONTRIBUTION OF ROADSIDE GRASSLAND RESTORATIONS TO NATIVE BEE CONSERVATION,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,BIOL. CONSERV.,"MARGINAL HABITATS SUCH AS HEDGEROWS OR ROADSIDES BECOME ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE CONSERVATION OF BIODIVERSITY IN HIGHLY MODIFIED LANDSCAPES. WITH CONCERNS OF A GLOBAL POLLINATION CRISIS, THERE IS A NEED. FOR IMPROVING POLLINATOR HABITAT. ROADSIDES RESTORED TO NATIVE PRAIRIE VEGETATION MAY PROVIDE VALUABLE HABITAT TO BEES, THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUP OF POLLINATORS. SUCH ROADSIDES SUPPORT A VARIETY OF POLLEN AND NECTAR SOURCES AND UNLIKE AGRICULTURAL FIELDS, ARE UNPLOWED, AND THEREFORE CAN PROVIDE POTENTIAL NESTING SITES FOR GROUND-NESTING BEES. TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF ROADSIDE RESTORATION, BEE COMMUNITIES WERE SAMPLED VIA AERIAL NETTING AND PAN TRAPPING ALONG ROADSIDE PRAIRIE RESTORATIONS AS WELL AS ROADSIDES DOMINATED BY NON-NATIVE PLANTS. MANAGEMENT OF ROADSIDE VEGETATION VIA THE PLANTING OF NATIVE SPECIES PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BEE COMMUNITIES. RESTORED ROADSIDES SUPPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER BEE ABUNDANCES AS WELL AS HIGHER SPECIES RICHNESS COMPARED TO WEEDY ROADSIDES. FLORAL SPECIES RICHNESS, FLORAL ABUNDANCE, AND PERCENTAGE OF BARE GROUND WERE THE FACTORS THAT LED TO GREATER BEE ABUNDANCE AND BEE SPECIES RICHNESS ALONG RESTORED ROADSIDES. TRAFFIC AND WIDTH OF ROADSIDE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE BEES, SUGGESTING THAT EVEN RELATIVELY NARROW VERGES NEAR HEAVY TRAFFIC COULD PROVIDE VALUABLE HABITAT TO BEES. RESTORED AND WEEDY ROADSIDE BEE COMMUNITIES WERE SIMILAR TO THE PRAIRIE REMNANT, BUT THE PRAIRIE REMNANT WAS MORE SIMILAR IN BEE RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE TO RESTORED ROADSIDES. RESTORING ADDITIONAL ROADSIDES TO NATIVE VEGETATION COULD BENEFIT POLLINATOR CONSERVATION EFFORTS BY IMPROVING HABITAT ON THE MILLIONS OF ACRES OF LAND DEVOTED TO ROADSIDES WORLDWIDE, LAND THAT IS ALREADY SET ASIDE FROM FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.

BROWN M;DOWNS CT;JOHNSON SD,BROWN M,POLLINATION OF THE RED HOT POKER KNIPHOFIA CAULESCENS BY SHORT-BILLED OPPORTUNISTIC AVIAN NECTARIVORES,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,S. AFR. J. BOT.,"RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT SHORT-BILLED BIRDS WHICH VISIT FLOWERS OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR NECTAR ARC IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF AFRICAN PLANTS AND SELECT FOR FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THOSE FOUND IN SUNBIRD-POLLINATED SPECIES. HERE WE REPORT THE EXISTENCE OF A POLLINATION SYSTEM INVOLVING OPPORTUNISTIC NECTARIVORES IN KNIPHOFIA CAULESCENS, A HIGH ALTITUDE MEMBER OF A GENUS PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED TO CONTAIN ONLY SUNBIRD- AND INSECT-ADAPTED POLLINATION SYSTEMS. PLANTS OF K. CAULESCENS SET APPROXIMATELY TWICE AS MANY FRUITS AND PRODUCED MORE SEEDS PER FRUIT WHEN EXPOSED TO BOTH BIRD AND INSECT POLLINATION THAN TO JUST INSECT POLLINATION. CONTROLLED POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED THAT THE SPECIES IS GENETICALLY SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND THUS TOTALLY RELIANT ON POLLINATOR VISITS FOR SEED SET. OPPORTUNISTIC NECTAR-FEEDING BIRDS APPEAR TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLINATORS OF THIS PLANT. IN PARTICULAR, DRAKENSBERG SISKINS (CRITHAGRA SYMONSI) AND YELLOW CANARIES (CRITHAGRA FLAVIVENTRIS) WERE THE MOST FREQUENT VISITORS AND CARRIED THE HIGHEST POLLEN LOADS. THE MALACHITE SUNBIRD (NECTARINIA FAMOSA), ALTHOUGH OFTEN FEEDING ON KNIPHOFIA CAULESCENS, CARRIED VERY LITTLE POLLEN, PRESUMABLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS LONG BILL WHICH REDUCES CONTACT BETWEEN THE FLORAL ANTHERS AND ITS HEAD FEATHERS. HONEY BEES WERE ALSO FREQUENT FLOWER VISITORS AND MADE A SECONDARY CONTRIBUTION TO FRUIT SET. FLOWERS OF K. CAULESCENS CONTAINED COPIOUS AMOUNTS (C. 30 MU L) OF VERY DILUTE (C. 9\%) HEXOSE-RICH NECTAR WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POLLINATION SYNDROME FOUND IN PLANTS POLLINATED BY OPPORTUNISTIC AVIAN NECTARIVORES.

THERE IS A TREND FOR CLOSELY RELATED ORCHIDS TO EXPLOIT WASPS FROM THE SAME GENUS, WITH DIFFERENT LINEAGES OF ORCHIDS OFTEN POLLINATED BY DIFFERENT GENERA. VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT POLLINATION OF FOOD-DECEPTIVE CALADENIA SPECIES, ALTHOUGH IT IS EVIDENT THEY ATTRACT A SUITE OF GENERALIST FOOD-SEEKING INSECTS. FOOD-DECEPTIVE SPECIES HAVE A HIGHER POLLINATION RATE THAN DO SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE SPECIES. STUDIES OF POPULATION GENETICS AND POLLEN MOVEMENTS ARE FEW, ALTHOUGH THEY SUGGEST A PATTERN OF FINE-SCALE GENETIC STRUCTURING WITHIN POPULATIONS, OWING TO PREDOMINANTLY RESTRICTED SEED DISPERSAL AND LOW GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION AMONG POPULATIONS AS A CONSEQUENCE OF RARE LONG-DISTANCE SEED-DISPERSAL EVENTS.

SIGNIFICANT DECREASES WERE FOUND IN THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS AND NECTAR PRODUCTION AS C. INFUSCATUS DENSITIES INCREASED.

CHIM. ACTA,"THE USE OF PESTICIDES TO PROTECT CROPS AGAINST PLAGUES AND INSECTS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS TO ASSURE AGRICULTURAL QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY. HOWEVER, BAD APPLICATION PRACTICES MAY CAUSE THE CONTAMINATION OF DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL COMPARTMENTS AND ANIMAL SPECIES, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MIGRATION OR ACCUMULATION OF THOSE COMPOUNDS. FIPRONIL, IMIDACLOPRID AND THIAMETOXAM ARE SYSTEMIC OR SYSTEMIC-LIKE INSECTICIDES WIDELY USED IN MAIZE CROPS. THEIR HEAVY ACTION IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF TARGET INSECTS ALSO MEANS A HIGH TOXICITY TO NONTARGET POLLINATOR INSECTS SUCH AS HONEY BEES WHICH CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM THROUGH POLLEN AND NECTAR DURING FORAGING ACTIVITIES. THESE INSECTICIDES HAVE EVEN BEEN SUSPECTED TO CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF HONEYBEE COLONIES THAT HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN MANY COUNTRIES SINCE THE PAST DECADE. SINCE SEPTEMBER 1 ST 2008, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION SET NEW MRLS IN FOOD AND FEED OF PLANT AND ANIMAL ORIGIN. THE PESTICIDES INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY HAVE MRLS IN HONEY AND POLLEN BETWEEN 10 AND 50 NG G(-1). IN THE PRESENT WORK, AN ANALYTICAL METHOD WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE AIM OF DETERMINING RESIDUES OF FIPRONIL AND SOME OF ITS METABOLITES (FIPRONIL SULFONE, FIPRONIL SULFIDE, FIPRONIL DESULFINYL AND FIPRONIL CARBOXAMIDE), THIAMETHOXAM AND IMIDACLOPRID IN HONEY AND POLLEN SAMPLES. THE EXTRACTION OPTIMIZATION WAS PERFORMED USING A DOEHLERT EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN BY STUDYING TWO FACTORS, THE MIXTURE AND THE RATIO OF SOLVENTS USED. PRIOR TO THE EXTRACTION PROCEDURE, RAW HIVE SAMPLES CONTAINING HONEY, POLLEN AND WAX WERE CENTRIFUGED AT 4000 RPM. THE UPPER SOLID MATERIAL WAS REMOVED, AND 1 G OF THE LOWER PHASE WAS MIXED WITH 3 ML OF THE OPTIMIZED MIXTURE OF METHANOL/WATER (10/90). THE EXTRACT WAS PASSED THROUGH A FLORISIL CARTRIDGE AND THE TARGET COMPOUNDS WERE ELUTED WITH METHANOL AND ANALYSED BY LC-MS/MS IN SELECTIVE REACTION MONITORING (SRM) MODE. THE METHOD WAS VALIDATED ACCORDING TO THE GUIDELINES INCLUDED IN THE SANCO/10684/2009 DOCUMENT AND THE ISO 11843 STANDARD FOR THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS: DECISION LIMIT (CC ALPHA), DETECTION CAPABILITY (CC BETA), RECOVERY, REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY AT 0.5, 1 AND 1.5 FOLDS THE MRLS. ION SUPPRESSION/ENHANCEMENT EFFECTS INTO THE ION SOURCE WERE ALSO ASSESSED. THE CC BETA VALUES WERE INCLUDED BETWEEN 0.83 AND 4.83 NG G(-1), WELL BELOW THE CURRENT MRLS. THE VALIDATED METHOD WAS APPLIED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE TARGET PESTICIDES IN 91 SAMPLES COLLECTED IN COLONIES FROM 73 APIARIES OF NW SPAIN (TWO SAMPLING CAMPAIGNS DURING 2008).

BEES' TENDENCY TO VISIT PATCHES IN THEIR DISCOVERY ORDER DECREASED WITH EXPERIENCE. INSTEAD, THEY OPTIMIZED THEIR FLIGHT DISTANCES BY REARRANGING FLOWER VISITATION SEQUENCES. THIS RESULTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PRIMARY ROUTE (TRAPLINE) AND TWO OR THREE LESS FREQUENTLY USED SECONDARY ROUTES.

INSECT CONSERV.,"THERE HAVE BEEN SERIOUS GLOBAL DECLINES IN DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES, BUTTERFLIES AND OTHER POLLINATING INSECTS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF INCREASING ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BUMBLEBEES ON FARMLAND IS TO SOW SIMPLE, LOW COST MIXTURES OF DICOTYLEDONS RICH IN POLLEN AND NECTAR, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE UK AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THIS MANAGEMENT PRESCRIPTION FOR BUTTERFLIES ARE UNKNOWN. SIMILARLY, MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON HOW TO MANAGE THIS HABITAT TO MAXIMISE THE PROVISION OF POLLEN AND NECTAR RESOURCES WHILST PROTECTING BREEDING HABITAT FOR BUTTERFLIES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVISE MIXTURES AND CUTTING MANAGEMENT REGIMES WHICH ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

WE RECOMMEND THAT NECTAR FLOWER MIXTURES ARE REFINED BY THE INCLUSION OF THE BEST PERFORMING SPECIES TO PROVIDE MID- AND LATE-SEASON FORAGE RESOURCES (TRIFOLIUM SPP., LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND CENTAUREA NIGRA), AND THE REMOVAL OF COMPETITIVE GRASS SPECIES. SUMMER CUTTING IN MAY OR EARLY JUNE, WITH REMOVAL OF HERBAGE WHERE POSSIBLE, SHOULD BE APPLIED TO HALF THE PATCH TO EXTEND THE FLOWERING SEASON, AND MINIMISE DAMAGE TO BUTTERFLY BREEDING HABITAT. THIS SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY THE TYPICAL AUTUMN CUT TO THE WHOLE PATCH.

EVOL.,"THE PLACEMENT OF THE ROOT NODE IN A PHYLOGENY IS FUNDAMENTAL TO CHARACTERIZING EVOLUTIONARY RELATIONSHIPS. THE ROOT NODE OF BEE PHYLOGENY REMAINS UNCLEAR DESPITE CONSIDERABLE PREVIOUS ATTENTION. IN ORDER TO TEST ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES FOR THE LOCATION OF THE ROOT NODE IN BEES, WE USED THE F1 AND F2 PARALOGS OF ELONGATION FACTOR 1-ALPHA (EF-1 ALPHA) TO COMPARE THE TREE TOPOLOGIES THAT RESULT WHEN USING OUTGROUP VERSUS PARALOGOUS ROOTING. FIFTY-TWO TAXA REPRESENTING EACH OF THE SEVEN BEE FAMILIES WERE SEQUENCED FOR BOTH COPIES OF EF-1 ALPHA. TWO DATASETS WERE ANALYZED. IN THE FIRST (THE ``CONCATENATED DATASET), THE F1 AND F2 COPIES FOR EACH SPECIES WERE CONCATENATED AND THE TREE WAS ROOTED USING APPROPRIATE OUTGROUPS (SPHECID AND CRABRONID WASPS). IN THE SECOND DATASET (THE ``DUPLICATED DATASET), THE F1 AND F2 COPIES WERE ALIGNED TO EACH ANOTHER AND EACH COPY FOR ALL TAXA WERE TREATED AS SEPARATE TERMINALS. IN THIS DATASET, THE ROOT WAS PLACED BETWEEN THE F1 AND F2 COPIES (E.G., PARALOG ROOTING). BAYESIAN ANALYSES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE OUTGROUP ROOTING APPROACH OUTPERFORMS PARALOG ROOTING, RECOVERING DEEPER CLADES AND SHOWING STRONGER SUPPORT FOR GROUPS WELL ESTABLISHED BY BOTH MORPHOLOGICAL AND OTHER MOLECULAR DATA. SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TWO COPIES WERE COMPARED AT THE AMINO ACID LEVEL, BUT LITTLE EVIDENCE WAS FOUND TO SUGGEST THAT ONE COPY IS MORE FUNCTIONALLY CONSERVED. ALTHOUGH NEITHER APPROACH YIELDS AN UNAMBIGUOUS ROOT TO THE TREE, BOTH APPROACHES STRONGLY INDICATE THAT THE ROOT OF BEE PHYLOGENY DOES NOT FALL NEAR COLLETIDAE, AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED. WE DISCUSS PARALOG ROOTING AS A GENERAL STRATEGY AND WHY THIS APPROACH PERFORMS RELATIVELY POORLY WITH OUR PARTICULAR DATASET.

INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS ON ONE SIDE OF THE SOIL SURFACE MAY HAVE IMPACTS THAT EXTEND ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF PLANT-HERBIVORE INTERACTIONS IS DERIVED LARGELY FROM STUDIES OF LEAF HERBIVORY, BELOWGROUND ROOT HERBIVORES MAY AFFECT PLANT FITNESS DIRECTLY OR BY ALTERING INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER ORGANISMS, SUCH AS POLLINATORS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF LEAF HERBIVORY, ROOT HERBIVORY, AND POLLINATION ON PLANT GROWTH, SUBSEQUENT LEAF HERBIVORY, FLOWER PRODUCTION, POLLINATOR ATTRACTION, AND REPRODUCTION IN CUCUMBER (CUCUMIS SATIVUS). WE MANIPULATED LEAF AND ROOT HERBIVORY WITH STRIPED CUCUMBER BEETLE (ACALYMMA VITTATUM) ADULTS AND LARVAE, RESPECTIVELY, AND MANIPULATED POLLINATION WITH SUPPLEMENTAL POLLEN. BOTH ENHANCED LEAF AND ROOT HERBIVORY REDUCED PLANT GROWTH, AND LEAF HERBIVORY REDUCED SUBSEQUENT LEAF DAMAGE. PLANTS WITH ENHANCED ROOT HERBIVORY PRODUCED 35\% FEWER FEMALE FLOWERS, WHILE LEAF HERBIVORY HAD NO EFFECT ON FLOWER PRODUCTION. WHILE LEAF HERBIVORY REDUCED THE TIME THAT HONEY BEES SPENT PROBING FLOWERS BY 29\%, PROBING TIMES ON ROOT-DAMAGED PLANTS WERE OVER TWICE AS LONG AS THOSE ON CONTROL PLANTS. ROOT HERBIVORY INCREASED POLLEN LIMITATION FOR SEED PRODUCTION IN SPITE OF INCREASED HONEY BEE PREFERENCE FOR PLANTS WITH ROOT DAMAGE. LEAF DAMAGE AND HAND-POLLINATION TREATMENTS HAD NO EFFECT ON FRUIT PRODUCTION, BUT PLANTS WITH ENHANCED ROOT DAMAGE PRODUCED 38\% FEWER FRUITS THAT WERE 25\% LIGHTER THAN THOSE ON CONTROL PLANTS.

ECOL.,"PROVIDING AMPLE NECTAR AND POLLEN, MASS-FLOWERING CROPS WERE SUGGESTED TO COUNTERACT ONGOING POLLINATOR DECLINES IN MODERN AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS. LATELY, HOWEVER, POSITIVE EFFECTS WERE SHOWN TO BE TRANSIENT AND HIGHLY TRAIT-SPECIFIC WITHIN THE SOCIAL BUMBLEBEES. CONTRARY TO BUMBLEBEES, SOLITARY WILD BEES MAY BENEFIT MORE SUSTAINABLY FROM MASS-FLOWERING CROPS DUE TO A BETTER SEASONAL MATCH OF THE MASS PROVISION OF RESOURCES AND THEIR SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. WE QUANTIFIED REPRODUCTIVE ACTIVITY AND REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF THE POLYLECTIC SOLITARY BEE OSMIA RUFA DURING AND AFTER MASS-FLOWERING IN LANDSCAPES WITH DIFFERING AMOUNTS OF OILSEED RAPE AND SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS. ACROSS SEASONS, THE NUMBER OF PRODUCED OFFSPRING INCREASED WITH AVAILABILITY OF OILSEED RAPE AND SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS WHILE BROOD ABORTION DECREASED WITH THE FORMER AND PARASITATION WITH THE LATTER. SEASON-SPECIFIC ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT INCREASED NEST-BUILDING DURING MASS-FLOWERING OF OILSEED RAPE EARLY IN THE SEASON OUTWEIGHS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE NUMBER OF CELLS PER NEST AND THE PERCENTAGE OF PARASITIZED CELLS ONCE THE MASS-FLOWERING HAS CEASED. NO EFFECT ON NUMBER OF CELLS PER NEST DURING MASS-FLOWERING AND EXEMPLARY POLLEN ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT OILSEED RAPE BENEFITS SOLITARY BEES IN THE FORM OF ABUNDANT NECTAR FOR FORAGING FLIGHTS RATHER THAN POLLEN FOR BROOD PROVISIONING. BESIDES PROVIDING PERMANENT FORAGE AND NESTING SITES, SEMI-NATURAL ELEMENTS SEEM TO BENEFIT POLLINATORS ALSO BY MITIGATING NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF PARASITATION, POTENTIALLY VIA ENHANCED HYPERPARASITISM. IN CONCLUSION, O. RUFA CLEARLY BENEFITS FROM MASS-FLOWERING OILSEED RAPE. YET, THE OUTWEIGHING OF THE NEGATIVE POST-FLOWERING EFFECTS BY THE EARLY BENEFITS OF OILSEED RAPE IS TIGHTLY LINKED TO THE BEE'S POLYLECTY AND EARLY PHENOLOGY.

BUMBLE BEE ABUNDANCE DECLINED WITH DECREASING PLANT POPULATION SIZE, AND ESPECIALLY THE PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS OF LARGE BUMBLE BEE SPECIES DIMINISHED IN SMALLER POPULATIONS. THE MOST REMARKABLE AND NOVEL OBSERVATION WAS THAT BUMBLE BEES SEEMED TO SWITCH FORAGING BEHAVIOUR ACCORDING TO POPULATION SIZE: WHILE THEY COLLECTED BOTH POLLEN AND NECTAR IN LARGE POPULATIONS, THEY LARGELY NEGLECTED POLLEN COLLECTION IN SMALL POPULATIONS. THIS PATTERN WAS DUE TO LARGE BUMBLE BEE SPECIES, WHICH SEEM THUS TO BE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM POLLEN SHORTAGES IN SMALLER HABITAT FRAGMENTS. COMPARING POLLEN LOADS OF BUMBLE BEES WE FOUND THAT FIDELITY TO V. ULIGINOSUM POLLEN DID NOT DEPEND ON PLANT POPULATION SIZE BUT RATHER ON THE EXTENT SHRUB COVER AND/OR OPENNESS OF THE SITE. BUMBLE BEES COLLECTED POLLEN ONLY FROM THREE PLANT SPECIES (V. ULIGINOSUM, SORBUS AUCUPARIA AND CYTISUS SCOPARIUS). WE ALSO DID NOT DISCOVER ANY POLLINATION LIMITATION OF V.

THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF THE FLIES AND THE PLANT, ASCERTAIN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FLIES AS POLLINATORS AND EXAMINE THE INTIMATE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FLOWERING EVENTS AND LIFE HISTORY OF THE FLIES. WE CONDUCTED SAMPLING, OBSERVATIONS AND FIELD POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS. THE FLIES WERE ATTRACTED BY THE ODOUR OF FEMALE-PHASE INFLORESCENCES IN THE EARLY MORNING ON THE FIRST DAY OF ANTHESIS. THEY FED, MATED AND OVIPOSITED IN THE INFLORESCENCES FOR 1 DAY. ON THE SECOND DAY, THE FLIES, COVERED WITH POLLEN GRAINS, LEFT THE MALE-PHASE INFLORESCENCES FOR THE NEXT FEMALE-PHASE INFLORESCENCES. THE IMMATURE FORMS OF BOTH FLY SPECIES HATCHED, DEVELOPED AND PUPATED WITHIN THE INFRUCTESCENCES WITHOUT DAMAGING THE FRUITS, AND DEVELOPED ADULTS EMERGED WHEN THE MATURE INFRUCTESCENCES DEHISCED. THE FLOWERING EVENTS AND FLY BEHAVIOURS WERE WELL SYNCHRONIZED. IN FIELD POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS, INFLORESCENCES BAGGED WITH A FINE MESH (INSECT EXCLUSION) PRODUCED ALMOST NO FRUITS, WHEREAS THOSE BAGGED WITH A COARSE MESH (BEE EXCLUSION) PRODUCED AS MANY FRUITS AS THE OPEN-POLLINATED CONTROLS. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THESE FLIES ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT AND SPECIALISED POLLINATORS FOR THEIR HOST, A. MACRORRHIZOS. THESE FLIES, IN RETURN, DEPEND ON A. MACRORRHIZOS FOR FOOD AND HABITAT THROUGH MOST OF THEIR LIFE CYCLE.

INTENSIVE ARABLE PLANT COMMUNITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN SHOWN TO CONTAIN HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF SELF-POLLINATED PLANTS COMPARED TO NATURAL OR SEMI-NATURAL PLANT COMMUNITIES. THOUGH INTENSIVE GRASSLANDS ARE WIDESPREAD, IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THEY SHOW SIMILAR PATTERNS TO ARABLE SYSTEMS NOR WHETHER LOCAL AND/OR LANDSCAPE FACTORS ARE INFLUENTIAL. WE INVESTIGATED PLANT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION IN 10 PAIRS OF ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL DAIRY FARMS ACROSS IRELAND IN RELATION TO THE LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE CONTEXT. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLANT GROUPS AND LOCAL FACTORS (FARMING SYSTEM, POSITION IN FIELD AND SOIL PARAMETERS) AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS (E. G. LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY) WERE INVESTIGATED. THE PERCENTAGE COVER OF UNIMPROVED GRASSLAND WAS USED AS AN INVERSE PREDICTOR OF LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY, AS IT WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH HABITAT-TYPE DIVERSITY. INTENSIVE GRASSLANDS (ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL) CONTAINED MORE INSECT-POLLINATED FORBS THAN NON-INSECT POLLINATED FORBS. ORGANIC FIELD CENTRES CONTAINED MORE INSECT-POLLINATED FORBS THAN CONVENTIONAL FIELD CENTRES. INSECT-POLLINATED FORB RICHNESS IN FIELD EDGES (BUT NOT FIELD CENTRES) INCREASED WITH INCREASING LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY (\% UNIMPROVED GRASSLAND) WITHIN 1, 3, 4 AND 5 KM RADII AROUND SITES, WHEREAS NON-INSECT POLLINATED FORB RICHNESS WAS UNRELATED TO LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY. POLLINATION SYSTEMS WITHIN INTENSIVE GRASSLAND COMMUNITIES MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN ARABLE SYSTEMS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT ORGANIC MANAGEMENT INCREASES PLANT RICHNESS IN FIELD CENTRES, BUT THAT LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY EXERTS STRONG INFLUENCES IN BOTH ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL FIELD EDGES. INSECT-POLLINATED FORB RICHNESS, UNLIKE THAT FOR NON-INSECT POLLINATED FORBS, SHOWED POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS TO LANDSCAPE COMPLEXITY REFLECTING WHAT HAS BEEN DOCUMENTED FOR BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS.

THE MOBILITY OF POLLINATING ANIMALS IS SIGNIFICANT TO THEIR IMPORTANCE BUT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE INFLUENCES POLLINATOR MOVEMENTS. LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES SUCH AS HEDGEROWS AND EMBANKMENTS ARE CONSPICUOUS FEATURES OF AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND ARE IMPORTANT ARTIFICIAL HABITATS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. HOWEVER, THERE HAS BEEN SOME DEBATE AS TO THE FUNCTION OF THESE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AS CORRIDORS BETWEEN LARGER EXPANSES OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT SEPARATED BY URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL HABITATS. FEW STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY STUDIED INSECT FLIGHT RESPONSES TO LINEAR LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS. BY OBSERVING BUMBLEBEE FLIGHT BEHAVIOUR ALONG HEDGEROWS AND, BY CREATING A MEDIUM-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL ARRAY OF FLOWER PATCHES USING AN ARTIFICIAL LINEAR FEATURE, WE EXAMINED WHETHER SUCH STRUCTURES CAN ELICIT AN ORIENTED FLIGHT RESPONSE ALONG THEM AND THEREFORE FACILITATE INSECT MOVEMENT THROUGH THE LANDSCAPE. WE FOUND THAT BOTH HEDGEROWS AND ARTIFICIAL LINEAR LANDSCAPE FEATURES CAN INFLUENCE THE FLIGHT DIRECTIONS OF BUMBLEBEES (BOMBUS SPP. HYMENOPTERA, APIDAE), ONE OF EUROPE'S MOST IMPORTANT GROUPS OF POLLINATORS. A BIOASSAY EXPERIMENT IN WHICH SALVIA PRATENSIS (LAMIACEAE) WAS PLANTED INTO LANDSCAPE PATCHES WITH DIFFERING NUMBERS OF CONNECTING HEDGEROWS SHOWED THAT THIS DIRECTIONAL RESPONSE CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS PLANTS HAD INCREASED POLLINATOR ACTIVITY, POLLEN RECEIPT AND SUBSEQUENT SEED SET IN PATCHES WITH MORE CONNECTIONS.

TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS OF COMPETITION FOR POLLINATION IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCED NATIVE DENSITY, WE ESTABLISHED 3 PLOTS FOR BOTH NATIVE SPECIES WITH THREE SOLIDAGO DENSITIES (UNINVADED, 50 AND 75 \% INVADED) AND CORRESPONDING DECREASES IN NATIVE DENSITY. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF VARYING DENSITIES OF SOLIDAGO ON HONEYBEE VISITATION RATES, NUMBER OF SUCCESSIVE VISITS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL RAMETS, POLLEN-LOAD COMPOSITION ON BEES, AND SEED SET. FOR BOTH NATIVE SPECIES, INCREASING SOLIDAGO DENSITY AND DECREASING NATIVE DENSITY RESULTED IN BEES CARRYING HIGHER RATIOS OF SOLIDAGO POLLEN AND IN BEES VISITING FEWER CAPITULA PRIOR TO DEPARTING FROM A PLANT. HOWEVER, FOR OTHER ASPECTS OF POLLINATION, THE NATIVE SPECIES RESPONDED VERY DIFFERENTLY TO SOLIDAGO. WITH INCREASING SOLIDAGO AND DECREASING NATIVE DENSITY, IXERIS RECEIVED FEWER HONEYBEE VISITS AND PRODUCED FEWER SEEDS, DEMONSTRATING COMPETITION FOR POLLINATION, BUT SONCHUS ATTRACTED MORE HONEYBEE VISITS AND SHOWED A NON-SIGNIFICANT TREND TOWARD SETTING MORE SEEDS, SUGGESTING FACILITATION. THESE OPPOSING EFFECTS OCCURRED DESPITE SIMILARITIES IN THE NATIVE SPECIES' FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, SUGGESTING THAT THE EFFECTS OF INVASIVE PLANTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. IN THIS CASE THE DIFFERENT EFFECTS MAY RELATE TO SONCHUS BEING A TALLER PLANT WITH LARGER FLOWERS.",COMPETITION FOR POLLINATION; IXERIS CHINENSIS; PLANT INVASION; PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; SOLIDAGO CANADENSIS; SONCHUS ARVENSIS,POLLEN LIMITATION; SOLIDAGO-CANADENSIS; FLORAL DISPLAY; ALIEN PLANT; SEED-SET; REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; FLOWERING PHENOLOGY; RELATIVE ABUNDANCE; GOLDENROD SOLIDAGO; MEDIATED SELECTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"LI, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), FUDAN UNIV, INST BIODIVERS SCI, MINIST EDUC KEY LAB BIODIVERS SCI \& ECOL ENGN, COASTAL ECOSYST RES STN YANGTZE RIVER ESTUARY, SHANGHAI 200433, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SUN, SHI-GUO, SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV, SCH LIFE \& ENVIRONM SCI, SHANGHAI 200234, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SUN, SHI-GUO, LI, BO, FUDAN UNIV, INST BIODIVERS SCI, MINIST EDUC KEY LAB BIODIVERS SCI \& ECOL ENGN, COASTAL ECOSYST RES STN YANGTZE RIVER ESTUARY, SHANGHAI 200433, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MONTGOMERY, BENJAMIN R., UNIV SOUTH CAROLINA UPSTATE, DEPT NAT SCI \& ENGN, SPARTANBURG, SC 29306 USA.",10.1007/S10530-013-0440-0,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,"NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINANATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA [2013CB430404]; LEADING ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE PROJECT OF SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL EDUCATION COMMISSIONSHANGHAI LEADING ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE PROJECT [J50401]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [30600036, 30930019, 30910362]","WE THANK LI GUO, LONG TANG AND MENG LU FOR ASSISTANCE IN THE FIELD AND IN THE LAB; LVSHEN PLANT NURSERY FOR PROVIDING THE STUDY SITE; AND DR.

GENET. EVOL.,"INSECTS HAVE A COMPLEX AND HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IMMUNE SYSTEM THAT RESPONDS SPECIFICALLY TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF PARASITES. DIFFERENT GENOTYPES OF A PARASITE SPECIES CAN DIFFER IN INFECTIVITY AND VIRULENCE, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR HOST-PARASITE CO-EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES, SUCH AS ANTAGONISTIC, FLUCTUATING SELECTION. SUCH COEVOLUTION OBVIOUSLY REQUIRES A GENETIC BASIS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW HOSTS IMMUNOLOGICALLY RESPOND TO DIFFERENT GENOTYPES. THE COMMON EUROPEAN BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS IS INFECTED BY THE HIGHLY PREVALENT TRYPANOSOME GUT PARASITE, CRITHIDIA BOMBI. HERE WE EXAMINED EXPRESSION OF 26 IMMUNOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC GENES IN RESPONSE TO INFECTION BY TWO CLONES OF C. BOMBI AND COMPARED THAT WITH EXPOSURE TO INJECTION WITH A BACTERIAL CHALLENGE. EXPOSURE TO THE TWO CLONES OF C. BOMBI ELICITS QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT IMMUNE EXPRESSION RESPONSES. INTERESTINGLY, INFECTION WITH ONE CLONE RESULTS IN UP REGULATION OF AMP'S SIMILAR TO BEES GIVEN THE BACTERIAL CHALLENGE, WHILE GENES RELATED TO METABOLISM, SIGNALLING, AND OTHER EFFECTORS WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN THE TWO CRITHIDIA EXPOSURES. BEES GIVEN DIFFERENT CHALLENGES WERE DISTINCT ENOUGH TO DISCERN USING LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSES.

FLORAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VEGETATION AND THE SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE OF FLOWER-VISITING INSECT ASSEMBLAGES WERE COMPARED BETWEEN NINE PAIRS OF RESTORED LANDFILL SITES AND REFERENCE SITES IN THE EAST MIDLANDS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM, USING STANDARDIZED METHODS OVER TWO FIELD SEASONS. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE RESTORED LANDFILL AND REFERENCE SITES IN TERMS OF SPECIES RICHNESS OR ABUNDANCE OF PLANTS IN FLOWER AND BOTH TYPES OF SITE HAD SIMILAR ASSEMBLAGES OF POLLINATORS. HOWEVER, PLANT AND INSECT ASSEMBLAGES DIFFERED ACROSS THE SEASON, WITH SPECIES RICHNESS AND ABUNDANCE BEING LOWER FOR THE RESTORED LANDFILL SITES IN THE SPRING AND HIGHER IN THE AUTUMN COMPARED TO THE REFERENCE SITES.

OUR STUDY DESCRIBES THE CONSEQUENCES OF EDGE CREATION OVER TWO SUCCESSIVE STAGES IN THE LIFE CYCLE OF A HEMI-PARASITIC MISTLETOE (TRISTERIX CORYMBOSUS), WHICH DETERMINE ITS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, IN TEMPERATE AUSTRAL FORESTS. WE ASSESSED HOW FLOWER PRODUCTION AND POLLINATOR VISITS CHANGE WITH DISTANCE TO THE NEAREST FOREST EDGE AND HOW THESE CHANGES AFFECT FRUIT SET, FRUIT AND SEED SIZE, AND FRUIT REMOVAL BY SEED DISPERSERS. EDGE EFFECTS WERE DOMINATED BY FRUIT REMOVAL, WHICH INCREASED WITH THE DISTANCE TO THE EDGE, HEIGHT IN THE CANOPY AND FRUIT AVAILABILITY. AS A RESULT, PLANT REPRODUCTION (IN TERMS OF SEEDS PRODUCED AND FRUITS REMOVED, WHICH PUTATIVELY LEADS TO HIGHER SEED DISPERSAL) DECREASED STRONGLY NEAR TO FOREST EDGES.

OUR STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE THE ABUNDANCE, DENSITY, DIVERSITY, SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION AND NESTING HABITS OF SPECIES BELONGING TO THE MELIPONINA SUBTRIBE IN AN URBAN AREA OF THE UBERLANDIA MUNICIPALITY, MINAS GERAIS STATE. WE CHECKED POTENTIAL NESTING SITES BY SEARCHING FOR NESTS FROM OCTOBER 2009 UNTIL APRIL 2010. WE COLLECTED SIX WORKER BEES FROM EACH DETECTED NEST TO IDENTIFY SPECIES, AND ESTIMATED DIVERSITY AND ANALYZED THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERN OF THE NESTS USING THE SHANNON-WIENER AND NEAREST NEIGHBOR INDEX, RESPECTIVELY. WE FOUND FIFTY NESTS BELONGING TO SEVEN SPECIES, WITH NANNOTRIGONA TESTACEICORNIS BEING THE MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES (44\%). THE DENSITY OF NESTS WAS 2.17 NESTS/HA, THE SHANNON-WIENER DIVERSITY INDEX WAS H'=1.58 AND THE CLUMPED DISTRIBUTION WAS THE DETECTED DISPERSAL PATTERN. THE HEIGHT OF THE NESTS IN RELATION TO THE GROUND VARIED FROM 0 TO 12 M: TRIGONA SPINIPES HAD THE HIGHEST NESTS AND THE HIGHEST VARIATION FOR THIS PARAMETER.

CONSERV.,"WORLDWIDE, WILD BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS SPP.) ARE EXPERIENCING MARKED DECLINES, WITH POTENTIALLY UP TO 11\% OF SPECIES CURRENTLY UNDER THREAT. RECENT STUDIES FROM NORTH AMERICA SUGGEST THAT DISEASE TRANSMISSION FROM COMMERCIALLY REARED BUMBLE BEES TO WILD POPULATIONS HAS LED TO MARKED RANGE CONTRACTIONS IN SOME SPECIES. IN EUROPE, DATA ON THE PREVALENCE OF PATHOGEN SPILLOVER FROM COMMERCIAL TO WILD BUMBLE BEE POPULATIONS IS LACKING, DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORT OF HIVES WITHIN THE EU SINCE THE EARLY 1980S. WE DETERMINED THE PERMEABILITY OF CROPPING SYSTEMS TO COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES, AND QUANTIFIED THE PREVALENCE OF FOUR PATHOGENS IN COMMERCIAL BOMBUS TERRESTRIS HIVES AND ADJACENT CONSPECIFIC POPULATIONS AT INCREASING DISTANCES FROM GREENHOUSES IN IRELAND. COMMERCIAL BUMBLE BEES COLLECTED FROM 31\% TO 97\% OF NON-CROP POLLEN, DEPENDING ON THE CROPPING SYSTEM, AND HIVES HAD MARKEDLY HIGHER FREQUENCIES OF TWO GUT PARASITES, CRITHIDIA SPP. AND NOSEMA BOMBI, COMPARED TO ADJACENT POPULATIONS, BUT WERE FREE OF TRACHEAL MITES. THE HIGHEST PREVALENCE OF CRITHIDA WAS OBSERVED WITHIN 2 KM OF GREENHOUSES AND THE PROBABILITY OF INFECTION DECLINED IN A HOST SEX- AND PATHOGEN-SPECIFIC MANNER UP TO 10 KM. WE SUGGEST IMPLEMENTING MEASURES THAT PREVENT THE INTERACTION OF COMMERCIALLY REARED AND WILD BUMBLE BEES BY INTEGRATING THE ENFORCEMENT OF NATIONAL BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR USERS OF COMMERCIAL POLLINATORS WITH INTERNATIONAL LEGISLATION THAT REGULATES THE SANITATION OF COMMERCIAL HIVES IN PRODUCTION FACILITIES.

EVOLUTIONARY THEORY SUGGESTS THAT HOST SOCIAL STRUCTURE MAY SELECT FOR MORE COOPERATIVE SYMBIONT STRAINS IN COMPARISON TO SYMBIONTS OF SOLITARY HOSTS. WE COMPARED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF ONE SOCIAL AND ONE SOLITARY BEE SPECIES (HALICTUS LIGATUS AND AUGOCHLORA PURA) IN THE FAMILY HALICTIDAE WITH AND WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF THEIR NEMATODE SYMBIONTS (ACROSTICHUS HALICTI AND ACROSTICHUS PURI, RESPECTIVELY). WE MEASURED THE NUMBER OF OFFSPRING PRODUCED, THE NUMBER OF CELLS PROVISIONED, AND NESTING ACTIVITY (FOR AU.

ONE DOMINANT FORM OF SPATIAL VARIATION IS HUMAN MODIFICATION OF THE LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING URBANIZATION AND SUBURBANIZATION. OUR GOAL WAS TO ASSESS HOW SUBURBANIZATION AFFECTED PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS IN GELSEMIUM SEMPERVIRENS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, INCLUDING INTERACTIONS WITH MUTUALISTS (POLLINATION) AND ANTAGONISTS (NECTAR ROBBING AND FLORIVORY). BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS MEASURED IN MULTIPLE REPLICATE SITES, WE THEN DEVELOPED PREDICTIONS FOR HOW THESE DIFFERENCES WOULD AFFECT PATTERNS OF NATURAL SELECTION, AND WE EXPLORED THE PATTERNS USING MEASUREMENTS OF FLORAL AND DEFENSIVE TRAITS IN THE FIELD AND IN A COMMON GARDEN. WE FOUND THAT GELSEMIUM GROWING IN SUBURBAN SITES EXPERIENCED MORE ROBBING AND FLORIVORY AS WELL AS MORE HETEROSPECIFIC BUT NOT CONSPECIFIC POLLEN TRANSFER. FLORAL TRAITS, PARTICULARLY COROLLA LENGTH AND WIDTH, INFLUENCED THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF PLANTS TO PARTICULAR INTERACTORS.

MODEL.,"FORAGING BEES USE COLOR CUES TO HELP IDENTIFY REWARDING FROM UNREWARDING FLOWERS. AS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CHANGE, BEES MAY REQUIRE BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY TO REVERSE THEIR LEARNT PREFERENCES. LEARNING TO DISCRIMINATE PERCEPTUALLY SIMILAR COLORS TAKES BEES A LONG TIME, AND THUS POTENTIALLY POSES A DIFFICULT TASK TO REVERSE-LEARN. WE TRAINED FREE-FLYING HONEYBEES TO LEARN A FINE COLOR DISCRIMINATION TASK THAT COULD ONLY BE RESOLVED (WITH ABOUT 70\% ACCURACY) FOLLOWING EXTENDED DIFFERENTIAL CONDITIONING. THE BEES WERE THEN TESTED FOR THEIR ABILITY TO REVERSE-LEARN THIS VISUAL PROBLEM. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSES POTENTIALLY IDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES THAT COULD BE BROADLY CLASSIFIED AS: `DELIBERATIVE-DECISIVE' BEES THAT COULD, AFTER SEVERAL FLOWER VISITS, DECISIVELY MAKE A LARGE CHANGE TO LEARNT PREFERENCES, `FICKLE-CIRCUMSPECT' BEES THAT CHANGED THEIR PREFERENCES BY A SMALL AMOUNT EVERY TIME THEY RECEIVED A REWARD, OR FAILED TO RECEIVE ONE, ON A PARTICULAR COLOR, AND `STAY' BEES THAT DID NOT CHANGE FROM THEIR INITIALLY LEARNT PREFERENCE. TO UNDERSTAND THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE OBSERVED BEHAVIORAL DIVERSITY, AGENT-BASED COMPUTER SIMULATIONS WERE CONDUCTED BY SYSTEMATICALLY VARYING PARAMETERS DESCRIBING FLOWER REWARD SWITCH OSCILLATION FREQUENCY, FLOWER HANDLING TIME, AND FRACTION OF DEFECTIVE `TARGET' STIMULI THAT CONTAINED NO REWARD. THESE SIMULATIONS REVEALED THAT WHEN THE FREQUENCY OF REWARD REVERSALS IS HIGH, FICKLE-CIRCUMSPECT BEES ARE MORE EFFICIENT AT NECTAR COLLECTION, BUT AS REWARD REVERSAL FREQUENCY DECREASES, THE PERFORMANCE OF DELIBERATIVE-DECISIVE BEES BECOMES MOST EFFICIENT. AS THE REVERSAL FREQUENCY CONTINUES TO FALL, FICKLE-CIRCUMSPECT AND DELIBERATIVE-DECISIVE STRATEGIES APPROACH ONE ANOTHER IN EFFICIENCY. IN NO TESTED CONDITION DID STAY BEES OUTPERFORM THE OTHER GROUPS. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THERE IS A FITNESS BENEFIT FOR HONEYBEE COLONIES CONTAINING INDIVIDUALS EXHIBITING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING CHANGING RESOURCE CONDITIONS. (C) 2014 ELSEVIER B.V.

PATELLAPIS DOLERITICA IS A RECENTLY DESCRIBED COMMUNALLY NESTING HALICTID BEE OF CONSERVATION CONCERN BECAUSE IT IS RARE AND ENDEMIC TO THE SUCCULENT KAROO OF SOUTH AFRICA. MOREOVER, ITS DISPERSAL IS CONSIDERED TO BE RESTRICTED BY ITS SPECIALISED NESTING REQUIREMENTS AND INCLEMENT WEATHER CONDITIONS DURING ITS LIMITED ANNUAL FLIGHT PERIOD, TRAITS WHICH MAY BE COMMON TO OTHER BEE SPECIES OF THE REGION. WE HYPOTHESISED THAT GENE FLOW IN P. DOLERITICA WAS LOW, LEADING TO MARKED GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION. USING 7 MICROSATELLITES, WE INVESTIGATED ITS MATING AND POPULATION GENETIC STRUCTURE IN 258 INDIVIDUALS (171 FEMALES AND 87 MALES) FROM 7 POPULATIONS SPANNING MOST OF ITS KNOWN RANGE. DEVIATION FROM HARDY-WEINBERG EQUILIBRIUM (F-IS=+ 0.254) SUGGESTED P. DOLERITICA TO BE INBRED, AS IN MANY OTHER COMMUNAL NESTING BEE SPECIES. GLOBAL F-ST (0.028) AND GLOBAL G'(ST) (0.216) REVEALED MODEST BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN MOST POPULATIONS, EVEN ACROSS THE VERY LIMITED RANGE OF THE SPECIES (CA. 25 KM), WITH ONE GENETICALLY EXTREME OUTLIER POPULATION. DESPITE INBREEDING, WE DETECTED A SURPRISINGLY LOW FREQUENCY OF DIPLOID MALES (2 \%).

SQUASH BEES NEST DIRECTLY IN CROP FIELDS, AND NESTS CAN BE DISTURBED BY TILLAGE AND OTHER MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS. MULCHES THAT USE MUNICIPAL WASTE MATERIALS MAY PROVIDE A WEED CONTROL STRATEGY FOR SQUASH PLANTINGS THAT IS MORE BENIGN TO SQUASH BEES THAN CULTIVATION. FIELD AND GREENHOUSE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2011 AND 2012 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF NONTILLAGE WEED CONTROL METHODS INCLUDING POLYETHYLENE BLACK PLASTIC, WOODCHIPS, SHREDDED NEWSPAPER, A COMBINATION OF SHREDDED NEWSPAPER PLUS GRASS CLIPPINGS (NP + GRASS), AND BARE SOIL (CONTROL) ON SOIL CHARACTERISTICS, SQUASH POLLINATION AND FRUIT PRODUCTION, AND SQUASH BEE NESTING.

IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED, BUT NOT TESTED, THAT SCARCITY OF LATE-SEASON FLOWER RESOURCES ARE LIMITING BUMBLE BEE POPULATIONS. WE EXAMINED WHETHER ADDITION OF LATE-SEASON FLOWERING RED CLOVER AFFECTED WORKER, QUEEN AND MALE BUMBLE BEE DENSITIES. BUMBLE BEES WERE SURVEYED IN FLOWER-RICH UNCULTIVATED FIELD BORDERS ACROSS 24 LANDSCAPES (RADIUS 2 KM) WITH OR WITHOUT A CLOVER FIELD IN THE CENTRE, VARYING IN SEMI-NATURAL GRASSLAND (SNG) AND EARLY MFC AVAILABILITY. CLOVER FIELDS HAD OVER TEN TIMES HIGHER WORKER DENSITIES COMPARED TO FIELD BORDERS, SUGGESTING RED CLOVER AS FAVOURED FORAGE. FIVE TIMES MORE QUEENS AND 71\% MORE MALES WERE FOUND IN LANDSCAPES WITH CLOVER FIELDS COMPARED TO CONTROL LANDSCAPES, DESPITE THESE FIELDS CONSTITUTING LESS THAN 0.2\% OF THE LANDSCAPE AREA. BOTH MFC AND SNG INCREASED THE DENSITY OF MALES, BUT ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF CLOVER FIELDS.

BOT.,"THE UNDERLYING EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES OF POLLINATOR-DRIVEN FLORAL DIVERSIFICATION ARE STILL POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ACCORDING TO THE GRANTSTEBBINS MODEL SPECIATION BEGINS WITH ADAPTIVE LOCAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE RESPONSE TO SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY IN POLLINATORS. ALTHOUGH THIS CRUCIAL PROCESS LINKS THE MICRO- AND MACROEVOLUTION OF FLORAL ADAPTATION, IT HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION. IN THIS STUDY GEOGRAPHICAL PHENOTYPIC VARIATION WAS INVESTIGATED IN PATAGONIAN CALCEOLARIA POLYRHIZA AND ITS POLLINATORS, TWO OIL-COLLECTING BEE SPECIES THAT DIFFER IN BODY SIZE AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION. PATTERNS OF PHENOTYPIC VARIATION WERE EXAMINED TOGETHER WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH POLLINATORS AND ABIOTIC FACTORS. SIX FLORAL AND SEVEN VEGETATIVE TRAITS WERE MEASURED IN 45 POPULATIONS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECIES RANGE. CLIMATIC AND EDAPHIC PARAMETERS WERE DETERMINED FOR 25 SELECTED SITES, 216 BEES PER SITE OF THE MOST FREQUENT POLLINATOR SPECIES WERE CAPTURED, AND A CRITICAL FLOWERBEE MECHANICAL FITTING TRAIT INVOLVED IN EFFECTIVE POLLINATION WAS MEASURED. GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERNS OF PHENOTYPIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION WERE EXAMINED USING UNI- AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES. DECOUPLED GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION BETWEEN COROLLA AREA AND FLORAL TRAITS RELATED TO THE MECHANICAL FIT OF POLLINATORS WAS EXPLORED USING A MANTEL TEST. THE BODY LENGTH OF POLLINATORS AND THE FLORAL TRAITS RELATED TO MECHANICAL FIT WERE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER. GEOGRAPHICAL VARIATION OF THE MECHANICAL-FIT-RELATED TRAITS WAS DECOUPLED FROM VARIATION IN COROLLA SIZE, THE LATTER HAD A GEOGRAPHICAL PATTERN CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF THE VEGETATIVE TRAITS AND WAS MAINLY AFFECTED BY CLIMATIC GRADIENTS. THE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH POLLINATORS PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING FLORAL PHENOTYPE AT A GEOGRAPHICAL SCALE AND PROMOTING THE DIFFERENTIATION OF TWO FLORAL ECOTYPES.

BOT.,"FLORAL POLYMORPHISM IS FREQUENTLY ATTRIBUTED TO POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION. MULTIPLE STUDIES, HOWEVER, HAVE REVEALED THE IMPORTANCE OF NON-POLLINATING VISITORS IN FLORAL EVOLUTION. USING THE POLYMORPHIC ANNUAL DAISY URSINIA CALENDULIFLORA, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPORTANCE OF DIFFERENT INSECT VISITORS, AND THEIR EFFECTS ON FITNESS, IN THE MAINTENANCE OF FLORAL POLYMORPHISM. THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF A DISCRETE FLORAL POLYMORPHISM WAS CHARACTERIZED BASED ON THE PRESENCE/ABSENCE OF ANTHOCYANIN FLORET SPOTS IN U. CALENDULIFLORA. A 3-YEAR OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS THEN CONDUCTED IN POLYMORPHIC POPULATIONS TO INVESTIGATE DIFFERENCES IN VISITATION RATES OF DOMINANT VISITORS TO FLORAL MORPHS. EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO EXPLORE THE FLORAL PREFERENCE OF MALE AND FEMALE MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS (THE DOMINANT INSECT VISITOR) AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AS POLLINATORS. NEXT, FLORAL DAMAGE BY ANTAGONISTIC FLORIVORES AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THE TWO FLORAL MORPHS WERE SURVEYED IN MULTIPLE POPULATIONS AND YEARS. FLORAL POLYMORPHISM IN U. CALENDULIFLORA WAS STRUCTURED SPATIALLY, AS WERE INSECT VISITATION PATTERNS. MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS MALES WERE THE DOMINANT VISITORS AND EXHIBITED STRONG PREFERENCE FOR THE SPOTTED MORPH IN NATURAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS. WHILE THIS MAY INDICATE POTENTIAL FITNESS BENEFITS FOR THE SPOTTED MORPH, FEMALE FITNESS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN FLORAL MORPHS. HOWEVER, AS M. CAPENSIS MALES ARE VERY EFFICIENT AT EXPORTING U. CALENDULIFLORA POLLEN, THEIR PREFERENCE MAY LIKELY INCREASE THE REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS OF THE SPOTTED MORPH THROUGH MALE FITNESS COMPONENTS. THE SPOTTED MORPH, HOWEVER, ALSO SUFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER COSTS DUE TO OVULE PREDATION BY FLORIVORES THAN THE SPOTLESS MORPH. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLINATORS AND FLORIVORES MAY POTENTIALLY EXERT ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF FLORAL POLYMORPHISM ACROSS THE RANGE OF U. CALENDULIFLORA. THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF SELECTION IMPOSED BY EACH AGENT IS POTENTIALLY DETERMINED BY INSECT COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND ABUNDANCE AT EACH SITE, HIGHLIGHTING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY CONTEXT IN THE EVOLUTION OF FLORAL PHENOTYPES.",ANTAGONISTIC SELECTION; BEE FLIES; COMMUNITY CONTEXT; FLORAL POLYMORPHISM; FLORIVORY; MONKEY BEETLES; OVULE PREDATION; POLLEN EXPORT; POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION; URSINIA CALENDULIFLORA; MEGAPALPUS CAPENSIS,FLOWER COLOR POLYMORPHISM; IPOMOEA-PURPUREA; EVOLUTION; SELECTION; HERBIVORES; PLANT; VISITATION; PIGMENTATION; CONSEQUENCES; POPULATIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,23,"DE JAGER, ML (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV STELLENBOSCH, DEPT BOT \& ZOOL, PRIVATE BAG X1, ZA-7602 MATIELAND, SOUTH AFRICA.;DE JAGER, MARINUS L., ELLIS, ALLAN G., UNIV STELLENBOSCH, DEPT BOT \& ZOOL, ZA-7602 MATIELAND, SOUTH AFRICA.",10.1093/AOB/MCT189,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",NA,SOUTH AFRICAN NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION - SOUTH AFRICA [SUR2008051300005]; STELLENBOSCH UNIVERSITY,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK C.

ECOL.,"FLORAL FEATURES THAT AFFECT THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH POLLINATORS CAN HARVEST THEIR RESOURCES, OR THE PROFITABILITY THEY OBTAIN FROM THEM, AFFECT THE FORAGING DECISIONS OF POLLINATORS. FORAGING CHOICES OF POLLINATORS, IN TURN, AFFECT POLLEN FLOW: INCREASES IN FLOWER CONSTANCY LEAD TO MORE EFFICIENT POLLEN TRANSPORT. IT FOLLOWS THAT EXPLOITATION BARRIERS-FLOWER TRAITS THAT DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT NET INTAKE RATES OF POTENTIAL VISITORS-WILL PROMOTE RESOURCE PARTITIONING AND ENHANCE POLLEN EXPORT. IN THIS PAPER WE FIRST GENERALISE FORAGING MODELS TO SHOW THAT EXPLOITATION BARRIERS CAN LEAD TO PARTIAL RESOURCE PARTITIONING EVEN WHEN FLOWERS ARE RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED IN SPACE. THEN WE DEVELOP A MODEL TO STUDY HOW THE FORAGING RULES OF POLLINATORS, POLLEN REMOVAL AND POLLEN DEPOSITION, AFFECT POLLEN FLOW. THE MODEL SHOWS THAT RESOURCE PARTITIONING, EVEN INCOMPLETE, CAN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF POLLEN FLOW. FINALLY, WE USE COMPUTER SIMULATIONS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT EXPLOITATION BARRIERS PROMOTING PARTIAL RESOURCE PARTITIONING CAN EVOLVE. MANY OF THE FLOWER TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATION SYNDROMES HAVE SMALL BUT CONSISTENT EFFECTS ON THE EFFICIENCY WITH WHICH DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS EXPLOIT FLOWERS, AND CAN BE CONSIDERED EXPLOITATION BARRIERS. EVEN IF THESE BARRIERS ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PROMOTE STRICT SPECIALISATION, AND MAY HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE FEMALE COMPONENT OF FITNESS WHEN POLLINATORS ARE NOT A LIMITING RESOURCE, THEY ARE LIKELY TO BE SELECTED BECAUSE THEY ENHANCE THE MALE COMPONENT OF FITNESS.",EXPLOITATION BARRIERS; FLORAL DIVERSIFICATION; OPTIMAL FORAGING; RESOURCE PARTITIONING; SPECIALISATION,ANIMAL-POLLINATED PLANTS; DEEP COROLLA TUBES; FLORAL SCENT; BUMBLE BEES; COLOR PREFERENCES; POLLEN DISPERSAL; ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE; RESOURCE COMPETITION; FLOWERING PLANTS; LONG TONGUES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"SANTAMARIA, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CSIC, EBD, C AMERICO VESPUCIO S-N, SEVILLE 41092, SPAIN.;RODRIGUEZ-GIRONES, MIGUEL A., CSIC, EEZA, LA CANADA DE SAN URBANO 04120, ALMERIA, SPAIN.;SUN, SHAN, LANZHOU UNIV, SCH LIFE SCI, STATE KEY LAB GRASSLAND \& AGROECOSYST, LANZHOU 730000, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SANTAMARIA, LUIS, CSIC, EBD, SEVILLE 41092, SPAIN.",10.1007/S10682-014-9738-3,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",NA,MINISTERIO DE CIENCIA E INNOVACION/FEDEREUROPEAN UNION (EU)SPANISH GOVERNMENT [CGL2010-16795]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [31100277]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIESFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [LZUJBKY-2013-99],THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE MINISTERIO DE CIENCIA E INNOVACION/FEDER (PROJECT CGL2010-16795 TO MARG AND LS).

HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF CORRELATIONS BETWEEN FLORAL TRAITS AND REWARDS IN AFFECTING POLLINATOR PREFERENCES IS UNCLEAR. MOREOVER, IN MONOECIOUS PLANTS AND PLANTS WITH STRONG WITHIN-FLOWER DICHOGAMY, SOME FLOWERS DO NOT OFFER A POLLEN REWARD, AND POLLINATOR ATTRACTION MAY DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF REWARDING FLOWERS RATHER THAN FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE. WE EXAMINED THESE QUESTIONS IN THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLUMBINE, WHERE BUMBLEBEES CAN FORAGE ONLY FOR POLLEN PRODUCED IN MALE-PHASE FLOWERS.METHODOLOGY.WE USED DUAL-CHOICE ASSAYS AND EXPERIMENTAL ARRAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CORRELATION BETWEEN POLLEN REWARD AND FLOWER SIZE WAS NECESSARY BEFORE BEES COULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FLOWERS WITH DIFFERENT POLLEN REWARDS OR SIZES.

IN FACT, 56 SPECIES (11\%) WERE ASSIGNED TO TWO OR MORE BINS REFLECTING THE HIGH LEVELS OF INTRASPECIFIC DIVERGENCE AMONG THEIR COMPONENT SPECIMENS. FIFTY OTHER SPECIES (9.7\%) SHARED THE SAME BARCODE INDEX NUMBER WITH ONE OR MORE SPECIES, BUT MOST OF THESE SPECIES BELONGED TO A DISTINCT BARCODE CLUSTER WITHIN A PARTICULAR BIN.

PLANT ECOL. EVOL. SYST.,"THE TRIBE ANTIRRHINEAE IS A NATURAL GROUP COMPRISING 28 GENERA AND OVER 320 SPECIES. IN MOST ANTIRRHINEAE THE COROLLA IS MARKED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROMINENT PALATE (PERSONATE FLOWER) THAT SOMETIMES OCCLUDES THE ENTRANCE OF THE COROLLA TUBE. TRADITIONALLY STRONG BEES OF DIFFERENT SIZE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS THE PRINCIPAL POLLINATORS OF OCCLUDED, PERSONATE FLOWERS (SNAPDRAGON-TYPE). PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES (ITS AND NDHF REGIONS) WERE CONDUCTED TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES IN PERSONATE FLOWER AND COROLLA OCCLUSION. IN ADDITION, LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS WERE PERFORMED IN ORDER TO TEST THE ROLE OF THIS TYPE OF FLOWER AS A FLORAL FILTERING MORPHOLOGY FOR POLLINATORS. HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PERSONATE FLOWER SUPPORTS ITS ANCESTRAL CONDITION WITHIN ANTIRRHINEAE AND A GENERAL PATTERN OF RECURRENT COROLLA OCCLUSION SHIFTS HAVE PREVAILED SINCE LINEAGE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE ANTIRRHINEAE. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND SOME EVIDENCE OF SNAPDRAGON-TYPE COROLLAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTING HUMMINGBIRDS AND INSECTS OTHER THAN BEES. PART OF THIS OUTCOME IS DUE TO PREDOMINANCE OF BEES AS SINGLE VISITORS OF ANTIRRHINEAE SPECIES WITH CLOSED COROLLAS (C. 65\% OF THE SPECIES). THE LACK OF SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN BEES AND OCCLUDED, PERSONATE FLOWERS IS INTERPRETED AS THE ABILITY OF BEES OF VISITING ANY TYPE OF FLOWERS. THE PERSONATE FLOWER, PARTICULARLY WHEN OCCLUDED, DISPLAYS ONE OF THE MOST SPECIALIZED COROLLAS IN POLLINATOR EXCLUSION BY PHYSICAL BARRIERS. (C) 2015 GEOBOTANISCHES INSTITUT ETH, STIFTUNG RUEBEL.

ECOL.,"A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF INVASIVE PLANTS ON NATIVE SPECIES REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF BOTH THE MECHANISMS OF INTERACTION AND THE SPATIAL SCALE OVER WHICH THEY ACT. INDIRECT INTERACTIONS INVOLVING MOBILE ORGANISMS SUCH AS POLLINATORS ARE LIKELY TO BE SCALE-DEPENDENT, YET MOST STUDIES EXAMINING EFFECTS OF INVASIVE SPECIES ON POLLINATION OF NATIVE PLANTS HAVE CONSIDERED EFFECTS ACROSS A SINGLE DISTANCE BETWEEN INTERACTING SPECIES. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE INVASIVE HERB LUPINUS POLYPHYLLUS ON POLLINATION OF TWO NATIVE HERBS USING MULTIPLE DISTANCES BETWEEN THE INVASIVE AND THE NATIVES. WE RECORDED POLLINATOR VISITATION AND SEED PRODUCTION IN THE NATIVE HERBS LOTUS CORNICULATUS AND LYCHNIS VISCARIA AT 0, 5 M OR 200 M AWAY FROM L. POLYPHYLLUS. TO REDUCE THE INFLUENCE OF CONFOUNDING FACTORS, WE USED EXPERIMENTALLY ESTABLISHED POPULATIONS OF THE INVASIVE AND POTTED INDIVIDUALS OF THE NATIVES. IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY TO L. POLYPHYLLUS, VISITATION TO L. CORNICULATUS WAS HIGHER THAN 200 M AWAY, AND SEED PRODUCTION PER FLOWER WAS HIGHER THAN 5 M AND 200 M AWAY. IN L. VISCARIA, BUMBLEBEE VISITATION WAS HIGHER ADJACENT TO L. POLYPHYLLUS THAN 5 M AND 200 M AWAY, BUT TOTAL POLLINATOR VISITATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS DID NOT VARY WITH DISTANCE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT L. POLYPHYLLUS FACILITATES POLLINATION OF THE NATIVE PLANTS, AND THAT THIS OCCURS AT A VERY LOCAL SPATIAL SCALE AS EFFECTS DROPPED OFF ALREADY AT A DISTANCE OF 5 M. PRESENCE OF L. POLYPHYLLUS COULD BENEFIT BOTH POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION OF NATIVE HERBS, AND THESE POSITIVE EFFECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH LIKELY NEGATIVE EFFECTS DUE TO RESOURCE COMPETITION.

ENTOMOL.,"THE FLOWER CONSTANCY (THE VISIT TO A SINGLE PLANT SPECIES DURING A FORAGING TRIP) IN POLLINATOR INSECTS IS A THEME WIDELY DISCUSSED IN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY AND HAS AN IMPORTANT IMPLICATION IN THE EVOLUTION OF ANGIOSPERMS. THIS BEHAVIOR WAS STUDIED IN THE BUMBLEBEES BOMBUS ATRATUS FRANKLIN AND BOMBUS BELLICOSUS SMITH THROUGH PALYNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF THE NECTAR AND POLLEN LOADS OF INDIVIDUALS CAPTURED WHILE FORAGING IN A RESTRICTED AREA. IN BOTH SPECIES, THERE WERE MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH CONSTANT FLIGHTS THAN WITH NON-CONSTANT ONES, ALTHOUGH IN THE NECTAR LOADS OF B. ATRATUS THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH EACH FLIGHT TYPES. IT WAS VERIFIED THAT THE NECTAR LOADS OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT MADE EITHER CONSTANT OR NON-CONSTANT FLIGHTS DID NOT DIFFER IN THE NUMBER OF POLLEN GRAINS THEY CONTAINED. CONSIDERING THIS MEASUREMENT AS AN ESTIMATE FOR FLIGHT DURATION, THE RESULTS WOULD INDICATE THAT THE PROBABILITY OF CHANGING BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES DURING NECTAR COLLECTION IS INDEPENDENT OF THE FORAGING TRIP DURATION. IN BOTH SPECIES, MOST INDIVIDUALS WHO COLLECTED NECTAR AND/OR POLLEN FROM MORE THAN ONE PLANT SPECIES VISITED JUST TWO PLANT SPECIES. IN THESE CASES, THE POLLEN OF ONE PLANT SPECIES WAS PREDOMINANT.

SCOPECE G;SCHIESTL FP;COZZOLINO S,SCOPECE G,POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY AND ITS EFFECT ON INFLORESCENCE SIZE IN DECEPTIVE POLLINATION STRATEGIES,PLANT BIOLOGY,PLANT BIOL.,"POLLINATION SYSTEMS DIFFER IN POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY, A VARIABLE THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF FLOWER NUMBER. HERE WE APPLY A COMPARATIVE APPROACH TO EXAMINE THE LINK BETWEEN POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY AND THE EVOLUTION OF INFLORESCENCE SIZE IN FOOD AND SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS. WE EXAMINED POLLINATION PERFORMANCE IN NINE FOOD-DECEPTIVE, AND EIGHT SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHIDS BY RECORDING POLLEN REMOVAL AND DEPOSITION IN THE FIELD. WE CALCULATED CORRELATIONS BETWEEN REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND FLOWER NUMBER (AS A PROXY FOR RESOURCES ALLOCATED DURING REPRODUCTIVE PROCESS), AND DIRECTIONAL SELECTION DIFFERENTIALS WERE ESTIMATED ON FLOWER NUMBER FOR FOUR SPECIES. RESULTS INDICATE THAT SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE SPECIES EXPERIENCE DECREASED POLLEN LOSS COMPARED TO FOOD-DECEPTIVE SPECIES. DESPITE PRODUCING FEWER FLOWERS, SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE SPECIES ATTAINED LEVELS OF OVERALL POLLINATION SUCCESS (THROUGH MALE AND FEMALE FUNCTION) SIMILAR TO FOOD-DECEPTIVE SPECIES. FURTHERMORE, A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN FLOWER NUMBER AND POLLINATION SUCCESS WAS OBSERVED IN FOOD-DECEPTIVE SPECIES, BUT THIS CORRELATION WAS NOT DETECTED IN SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE SPECIES. DIRECTIONAL SELECTION DIFFERENTIALS FOR FLOWER NUMBER WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN FOOD COMPARED TO SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE SPECIES. WE SUGGEST THAT POLLINATION SYSTEMS WITH MORE EFFICIENT POLLEN TRANSFER AND NO CORRELATION BETWEEN POLLINATION SUCCESS AND NUMBER OF FLOWERS PRODUCED, SUCH AS SEXUAL DECEPTION, MAY ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF INFLORESCENCES WITH FEWER FLOWERS THAT PERMIT THE PLANT TO ALLOCATE FEWER RESOURCES TO FLORAL DISPLAYS AND, AT THE SAME TIME, LIMIT TRANSPIRATION.

(LAMIACEAE)",JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,J. EVOL. BIOL.,"THE INFLUENCE OF LOCALLY DIFFERENT SPECIES INTERACTIONS ON TRAIT EVOLUTION IS A FOCUS OF RECENT EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT GEOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION INFLUENCES GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS, ESPECIALLY ACROSS A NARROW GEOGRAPHIC RANGE. HERE, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT FLORAL SIZE VARIATION IN THE JAPANESE HERB PRUNELLA VULGARIS L. (LAMIACEAE) IS AFFECTED BY GEOGRAPHICALLY DIFFERENT POLLINATOR SIZES REFLECTING DIFFERENT POLLINATOR ASSEMBLAGES. TO EVALUATE THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE POSED TWO QUESTIONS. (1) IS THERE A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN FLORAL LENGTH AND THE PROBOSCIS LENGTH OF POLLINATORS (BUMBLEBEES) ACROSS ALTITUDE IN A MOUNTAIN RANGE? (2) DOES THE FLOWER-POLLINATOR SIZE MATCH INFLUENCE FEMALE AND MALE PLANT FITNESS? WE FOUND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE ASSEMBLAGE OF POLLINATORS OF P.VULGARIS ALONG AN ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT, AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE MEAN POLLINATOR PROBOSCIS LENGTH ALSO CHANGED ALTITUDINALLY.

IN A COMPARISON OF TWO PAIRS OF IPOMOEA SPECIES WITH CONTRASTING BREEDING SYSTEMS, WE PREDICTED THAT SELF-COMPATIBLE (SC) SPECIES WOULD HAVE SMALLER, LESS VARIABLE FLOWERS, REDUCED HERKOGAMY, LOWER POLLINATOR VISITATION AND HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS THAN THEIR SELF-INCOMPATIBLE (SI) CONGENERS. WE STUDIED SYMPATRIC SPECIES PAIRS, I. HEDERACEA (SC)-I. MITCHELLAE (SI) AND I. PURPUREA (SC)-I. INDICA (SI), IN MEXICO, OVER TWO YEARS. WE QUANTIFIED VARIATION IN FLORAL TRAITS AND NECTAR PRODUCTION, DOCUMENTED POLLINATOR VISITATION, AND DETERMINED NATURAL FRUIT AND SEED SET. HAND-POLLINATION AND BAGGING EXPERIMENTS WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE POTENTIAL FOR AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION AND APOMIXIS. SELF-COMPATIBLE IPOMOEA SPECIES HAD SMALLER FLOWERS AND LOWER NECTAR PRODUCTION THAN SI SPECIES, HOWEVER, FLORAL VARIATION AND INTEGRATION DID NOT VARY ACCORDING TO BREEDING SYSTEM. BEES WERE PRIMARY POLLINATORS OF ALL SPECIES, BUT VISITATION RATES WERE SEVEN TIMES LOWER IN SC THAN SI SPECIES. SC SPECIES HAD A HIGH CAPACITY FOR AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION DUE TO REDUCED HERKOGAMY AT THE HIGHEST ANTHER LEVELS. SELF-COMPATIBLE SPECIES HAD TWO TO SIX TIMES HIGHER FRUIT SET THAN SI SPECIES. RESULTS GENERALLY SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SELF-COMPATIBILITY AND AUTONOMOUS SELF-POLLINATION ENSURE REPRODUCTION UNDER LOW POLLINATOR VISITATION. HOWEVER, HIGH VARIATION IN MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS OF SC IPOMOEA SPECIES SUGGESTS THEY MAINTAIN VARIATION THROUGH OUTCROSSING.

BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: MANY STUDIES ASSUME CLIMATIC FACTORS ARE PARAMOUNT IN DETERMINING SPECIES' DISTRIBUTIONS, HOWEVER, BIOTIC INTERACTIONS MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE. FOR EXAMPLE, POLLINATORS MAY LIMIT SPECIES' RANGES IF FLORAL ABUNDANCE OR FLORAL ATTRACTIVENESS IS REDUCED AT RANGE MARGINS, THUS CAUSING LOWER POLLINATOR VISITATION AND REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT. METHODS: TO TEST IF POLLINATORS INFLUENCE THE A LTITUDINA I DISTRIBUTION OF ERYTHRONIUM MONTANUM (LILIACEAE) AT MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK, WE ASKED WHETHER (1) SEED PRODUCTION IN THIS SPECIES RELIES ON POLLINATORS, (2) SEED PRODUCTION AND POLLEN LIMITATION IS GREATEST AT RANGE LIMITS, AND (3) POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES (EITHER OVERALL OR BY INDIVIDUAL TAXONOMIC GROUPS) REFLECT PATTERNS OF SEED PRODUCTION AND POLLEN LIMITATION. RESULTS: FROM THIS THREE-YEAR STUDY, WE ESTABLISHED THAT THIS PLANT DOES RELY ON POLLINATORS FOR FRUIT SET AND WE FOUND THAT POLLEN LIMITATION TRENDED TOWARD BEING HIGHER AT THE UPPER RANGE LIMIT IN SOME YEARS, BUT NOT CONSISTENTLY YEAR TO YEAR. INSECT VISITATION RATES DID NOT MIRROR SPATIAL PATTERNS OF POLLEN LIMITATION, BUT ANNUALLY VARIABLE POLLINATOR COMPOSITION SUGGESTED DIFFERENTIAL IMPORTANCE OF SOME POLLINATOR TAXONOMIC GROUPS (SPECIFICALLY, BUMBLEBEES MAY BE BETTER POLLINATORS THAN SYRPHID FLIES). CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WHILE POLLINATORS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THIS HIGH MOUNTAIN WILDFLOWER, PLANT -POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS DO NOT OBVIOUSLY DRIVE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES.

EVOL.,"FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION, FOR EXAMPLE, LOSS OF SEMINATURAL VEGETATION AND PESTICIDE USE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE BEE COMMUNITY. THESE FACTORS MAY IMPACT THE BEE COMMUNITY DIFFERENTLY AT DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE SCALES. THE SCALE DEPENDENCY IS EXPECTED TO BE MORE PRONOUNCED IN HETEROGENEOUS LANDSCAPES. HOWEVER, THE SCALE-DEPENDENT RESPONSE OF THE BEE COMMUNITY TO DRIVERS OF ITS DECLINE IS RELATIVELY UNDERSTUDIED, ESPECIALLY IN THE TROPICS WHERE THE AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE IS OFTEN HETEROGENEOUS. THIS STUDY LOOKED AT EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION ON BEE DIVERSITY AT PATCH AND LANDSCAPE SCALES IN A TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. WILD BEES WERE SAMPLED USING 12 PERMANENT PAN TRAP STATIONS. PATCH AND LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEASURED WITHIN A 100 M (PATCH SCALE) AND A 500 M (LANDSCAPE SCALE) RADIUS OF PAN TRAP STATIONS. INFORMATION ON PESTICIDE INPUT WAS OBTAINED FROM FARMER SURVEYS. DATA ON VEGETATION COVER, PRODUCTIVITY, AND PERCENTAGE OF AGRICULTURAL AND FALLOW LAND (FL) WERE COLLECTED USING SATELLITE IMAGERY. INTENSIVE AREAS IN A BEE-SITE NETWORK WERE LESS SPECIALIZED IN TERMS OF RESOURCES TO ATTRACT RARE BEE SPECIES WHILE THE LESS INTENSIVE AREAS, WHICH SUPPORTED MORE RARE SPECIES, WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO DISTURBANCE. A COMBINATION OF PATCH QUALITY AND DIVERSITY AS WELL AS PESTICIDE USE REGULATES SPECIES DIVERSITY AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE (500 M), WHEREAS PESTICIDE QUANTITY DROVE DIVERSITY AT THE PATCH SCALE (100 M). AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, SPECIALIZATION OF EACH SITE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES FOR BEES INCREASED WITH INCREASING PATCH DIVERSITY AND FL WHILE AT THE PATCH SCALE SPECIALIZATION DECLINED WITH INCREASED PESTICIDE USE. BEE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS RESPONDED DIFFERENTIALLY TO LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS PESTICIDE USE. WOOD NESTING BEES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE NUMBER OF PESTICIDES USED BUT OTHER BEE FUNCTIONAL GROUPS WERE NOT SENSITIVE TO PESTICIDES. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS: DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECT WILD BEE DIVERSITY AT THE SCALE OF LANDSCAPE AND PATCH IN HETEROGENEOUS TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS.

THE PERIPHERAL LARGE-AREA COMPONENT OF FLORAL COLOUR PATTERNS ATTRACTS FLOWER VISITORS FROM SOME DISTANCE AND THE CENTRAL SMALL-AREA COMPONENT GUIDES FLOWER VISITORS TOWARDS LANDING SITES. WHEREAS THE PERIPHERAL COLOUR IS LARGELY VARIABLE AMONG SPECIES, THE CENTRAL COLOUR, PRODUCED MOSTLY BY ANTHERS AND POLLEN OR POLLEN MIMICKING FLORAL GUIDES, IS PREDOMINANTLY YELLOW AND UV-ABSORBING. THIS HOLDS ALSO FOR YELLOW FLOWERS THAT REGULARLY DISPLAY A UV BULL'S EYE PATTERN. HERE WE SHOW THAT YELLOW-FLOWERING CROCUS SPECIES ARE A NOTICEABLE EXCEPTION, SINCE YELLOW-FLOWERING CROCUS SPECIES-BEING ENTIRELY UV-ABSORBING-EXHIBIT LOW COLOUR CONTRAST BETWEEN YELLOW REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND YELLOW TEPALS. THE ELONGATED YELLOW OR ORANGE-YELLOW STYLE OF CROCUS FLOWERS IS A STAMEN-MIMICKING STRUCTURE PROMOTING CROSS-POLLINATION BY FACILITATING FLOWER VISITORS' CONTACT WITH THE APICAL STIGMA BEFORE THE FLOWER VISITORS ARE TOUCHING THE ANTHERS.

POLLINATORS HAVING SYSTEMATIC SEARCHING ABILITY CAN FLEXIBLY RESPOND TO THE REWARD CONDITION OF FLORAL PATCHES, AND THEY TEND TO REVISIT REWARDING PATCHES. HOWEVER, FORAGING BEHAVIOUR MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE NECTAR DISTRIBUTION WITHIN POPULATIONS. TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF UNREWARDING EXPERIENCES AND PLANT DISTRIBUTION, WE COMPARED BUMBLE BEE FORAGING BEHAVIOURS BETWEEN NATURALLY REWARDING AND ARTIFICIALLY REWARDLESS (BY NECTARY REMOVAL) PATCHES IN TWO ACONITE POPULATIONS WITH DIFFERENT PLANT DENSITIES. VISITATION FREQUENCY TO THE PATCHES, NUMBER OF SUCCESSIVE FLOWER VISITS WITHIN INFLORESCENCES, AND SUCCESSIVE INFLORESCENCE VISITS WITHIN PATCHES WERE RECORDED. NECTAR PRODUCTION AND STANDING CROP WERE ALSO MEASURED. BUMBLE BEES INCREASED THE MOVEMENTS BETWEEN NEIGHBOURING INFLORESCENCES INSTEAD OF LEAVING THE PATCHES WHEN THEY FACED REWARDLESS FLOWERS. A LARGE VARIANCE IN NECTAR PRODUCTION EXISTED AMONG FLOWERS WITHIN PLANTS. THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN THE OBSERVED BUMBLE BEE BEHAVIOUR, BECAUSE THEY COULD BE REWARDED BY MOVING TO THE ADJACENT INFLORESCENCES EVEN AFTER A REWARDLESS EXPERIENCE.

TWO MAJOR THREATS TO INSECT POLLINATORS ARE ANTHROPOGENIC LAND-USE CHANGE AND THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS, WHOSE EFFECTS MAY INTERACT TO IMPACT POLLINATION. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIVE EFFECTS ON THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE OF POLLINATION OF (I) LAND-USE CHANGE BROUGHT ON BY AGRICULTURE AND URBANIZATION AS WELL AS (II) THE PREVALENCE OF POLLINATOR PARASITES, USING EXPERIMENTAL INSECT POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT PLANT SPECIES IN NATURAL POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES. WE FOUND THAT POLLINATOR HABITAT (I.E. AVAILABILITY OF NESTING RESOURCES FOR GROUND-NESTING BEES AND LOCAL FLOWER RICHNESS) WAS STRONGLY RELATED TO FLOWER VISITATION RATES AT THE LOCAL SCALE AND INDIRECTLY INFLUENCED PLANT POLLINATION SUCCESS. AT THE LANDSCAPE SCALE, POLLINATION WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO URBANIZATION, BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY VIA ELEVATED VISITATION RATES. BUMBLEBEES WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT POLLINATOR GROUP VISITING EXPERIMENTAL FLOWERS.

ECOL.,"1. POLLINATION IS A MAJOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICE IN WHICH INSECTS, PARTICULARLY BEES, PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE REPRODUCTION OF MOST ANGIOSPERMS. CURRENTLY, THIS SERVICE IS CONSIDERED UNDER THREAT DUE TO REPORTED BEE DECLINES. MODERATELY URBANISED AREAS COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION, HOWEVER, COMPARED TO AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL SYSTEMS, THEY ARE POORLY STUDIED. 2. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LOCAL HABITAT QUALITY AND ANTHROPOGENIC LAND USE ACROSS AN AGRICULTURAL TO URBAN GRADIENT FOR LOCAL PLANT AND FLYING INSECT COMMUNITIES. WE QUANTIFIED LOCAL FLOWER VISITOR NETWORKS AND RELATED NETWORK ARCHITECTURE TO THESE LOCAL AND LANDSCAPE FACTORS USING STRUCTURAL EQUATIONMODELLING. FLOWER VISITOR NETWORK ARCHITECTURE IS OFTEN ASSUMED TO ACT AS A SURROGATE FOR THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE OF POLLINATION. TO TEST THIS IDEA, WE RELATED NETWORK METRICS TO POLLINATION OF FOUR EXPERIMENTAL, INSECT POLLINATOR-DEPENDENT PLANT SPECIES. 3. OVERALL, LOCAL LAND USE MARKEDLY INFLUENCED PLANT AND FLYING INSECT COMMUNITIES. FLOWER RICHNESS AND BEE RICHNESS WERE HIGHER IN URBAN COMPARED TO AGRICULTURAL AREAS. FLOWER VISITOR NETWORK METRICS (E.G. LINKAGE DENSITY) INCREASED WITH THE PROPORTION OF URBAN AREA SURROUNDING A SITE. ALSO, RELATIVE TO AGRICULTURAL AREAS, URBAN FLOWER VISITORS WERE MORE GENERALISED AND FORAGED FROM A HIGHER NUMBER OF PLANT SPECIES, LIKELY A CONSEQUENCE OF HIGHER URBAN FLOWERING PLANT RICHNESS. HOWEVER, URBAN BEES ALSO VISITED A LOWER PROPORTION OF THE AVAILABLE FLOWERING PLANTS (HIGHER SPECIALISATION). SURPRISINGLY, LINKAGE DENSITY, NETWORK SPECIALISATION AND FLOWER VISITOR GENERALITY WERE NOT RELATED TO POLLINATION OF OUR FOUR EXPERIMENTAL PLANTS PER SE. RATHER, IT WAS THE PROPORTION OF URBAN COVER, FLYING INSECT ABUNDANCE AND BEE RICHNESS THAT WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO POLLINATION. 4. OUR FINDINGS SHOW STRONG EFFECTS OF LOCAL LAND USE ON PLANT AND FLYING INSECT COMMUNITIES AND FLOWER VISITOR INTERACTION NETWORKS. WE OBSERVED INCREASED OVERALL VISITATION RATES AND POLLINATION SERVICES TO OUR EXPERIMENTAL PLANTS IN URBAN COMPARED TO AGRICULTURAL AREAS, DESPITE INCREASED URBAN FLOWER VISITOR GENERALITY.

BAUER AA;CLAYTON MK;BRUNET J,BAUER AA,FLORAL TRAITS INFLUENCING PLANT ATTRACTIVENESS TO THREE BEE SPECIES: CONSEQUENCES FOR PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,AM. J. BOT.,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY: THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT POLLINATORS IS CRUCIAL TO PLANTS THAT RELY ON INSECTS FOR POLLINATION. WE CONTRASTED THE ROLES OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE AND FLOWER COLOR IN ATTRACTING THREE BEE SPECIES AND DETERMINED THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLANT ATTRACTIVENESS ( NUMBER OF POLLINATOR VISITS) AND SEED SET FOR EACH BEE SPECIES. METHODS: WE RECORDED POLLINATOR VISITS TO PLANTS, MEASURED PLANT TRAITS, AND QUANTIFIED PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. A ZERO-INFLATED POISSON REGRESSION MODEL INDICATED PLANT TRAITS ASSOCIATED WITH POLLINATOR ATTRACTION. IT IDENTIFIED TRAITS THAT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF BEE VISITS AND TRAITS THAT INCREASED THE PROBABILITY OF A PLANT NOT RECEIVING ANY VISITS. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE WERE EXAMINED AND TWO MODELS OF FLOWER COLOR CONTRASTED. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLANT ATTRACTIVENESS AND SEED SET WERE DETERMINED USING REGRESSION ANALYSES. KEY RESULTS: PLANTS WITH MORE RACEMES RECEIVED MORE BEE VISITS FROM ALL THREE BEE SPECIES. PLANTS WITH FEW RACEMES WERE MORE LIKELY NOT TO RECEIVE ANY BEE VISITS. THE ROLE OF FLOWER COLOR VARIED WITH BEE SPECIES AND WAS INFLUENCED BY THE CHOICE OF THE FLOWER COLOR MODEL. INCREASING BEE VISITS INCREASED SEED SET FOR ALL THREE BEE SPECIES, WITH THE STEEPEST SLOPE FOR LEAFCUTTING BEES, FOLLOWED BY BUMBLE BEES, AND FINALLY HONEY BEES. CONCLUSIONS: FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE INFLUENCED POLLINATOR ATTRACTION MORE CONSISTENTLY THAN FLOWER COLOR.

URBAN PLAN.,"ALTHOUGH URBAN AGRICULTURE IS GROWING IN POPULARITY, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE DISTRIBUTION OF INSECT POLLINATORS ACROSS URBANIZED LANDSCAPES. WE USED THE POLLINATION MODULE OF INVEST (A SUITE OF SOFTWARE MODELS USED TO MAP AND VALUE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES), ALONG WITH FINE-SCALE LAND COVER DATA AND EMPIRICAL DATA ON BEE DISTRIBUTIONS, TO ASSESS DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF URBAN POLLINATOR MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS (USA). SPECIFICALLY, WE SIMULATED THE PARTIAL CONVERSION OF LAWN/TURF-GRASS TO FLORAL RESOURCES IN CITY PARKS ONLY, IN GARDENS MANAGED BY INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLDS ONLY, AND IN ANY AVAILABLE TURF GRASS WITHIN BUFFER DISTANCES OF 250-1000 M OF URBAN FARMS, COMMUNITY GARDENS, AND HOME GARDENS ACROSS CHICAGO. WE FOUND THAT THE OUTPUT OF INVEST'S POLLINATION MODEL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO EMPIRICAL MEASURES OF BEE RICHNESS (EXPLAINING 46\% OF THE VARIATION) BUT NOT BEE ABUNDANCE IN CHICAGO. TO INCREASE POLLINATION SUPPLY AT URBAN FARMS AND COMMUNITY GARDENS, OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT, OUT OF THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED HERE, THE BEST STRATEGY FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO WOULD BE TO CONCENTRATE FLORAL RESOURCES NEARBY (WITHIN A 250 M BUFFER RATHER THAN WITHIN A 1 KM BUFFER). IN CONTRAST, FOR HOME GARDENS, THE MODEL INDICATES THAT IT MAY BE BETTER TO INCREASE FLORAL RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

ENTOMOL.,"1. IN INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS, POLLINATOR ATTRACTION IS INFLUENCED BY FLOWERS (E.G. NUMBER, SIZE) AND THEIR ASSOCIATED REWARDS (E.G. POLLEN, NECTAR). THESE TRAITS CAN DEPEND ON PLANT INTERACTIONS. INDEED, BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION BETWEEN PLANTS CAN LEAD TO A DECREASE IN FLOWER OR REWARD PRODUCTION IN INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES. 2. WIND-POLLINATED PLANTS, IN PARTICULAR, WHICH ARE ALMOST NEVER STUDIED IN PLANT POLLINATOR NETWORKS, CAN ALTER INSECT-POLLINATED PLANTS' ATTRACTIVENESS THROUGH COMPETITION FOR NUTRIENTS. THE RESPONSE OF POLLINATORS TO SUCH CHANGES HAS NEVER BEEN INVESTIGATED. 3. A POT EXPERIMENT WAS CARRIED OUT IN WHICH AN INSECT-POLLINATED SPECIES, ECHIUM PLANTAGINEUM, WAS GROWN IN BINARY MIXTURE WITH THREE WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES SELECTED TO EXERT A PANEL OF COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS. BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION WAS CONTROLLED USING DIVIDERS LIMITING INTERSPECIFIC ROOT COMPETITION. FLORAL TRAITS OF E. PLANTUGINEUM (I.E. FLOWER PRODUCTION, FLORAL DISPLAY SIZE, FLOWER SIZE AND NECTAR PRODUCTION) WERE MEASURED. FOR EACH SPECIES MIXTURE, THE VISITS (I.E. FIRST VISIT, NUMBER OF VISITS, 10-MIN SEQUENCES) OF BOMBUS TERRESTRIS INDIVIDUALS RELEASED IN A FLIGHT CAGE CONTAINING TWO POTS WERE FOLLOWED, ONE WITH AND ONE WITHOUT BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION. 4. BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED NECTAR'S SUCROSE CONCENTRATION BUT DID NOT INFLUENCE FLOWER AND NECTAR PRODUCTION. LIKEWISE, POLLINATOR VISITS WERE NOT INFLUENCED BY BELOW-GROUND COMPETITION. COMPETITOR IDENTITY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED FLOWER AND REWARD PRODUCTION OF E. PLANTAGINEUM, WITH A DECREASE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE WIND-POLLINATED SPECIES. A TENDENCY FOR FASTER FLOWER VISITATION EVENTS WAS ALSO DETECTED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE LEAST COMPETITIVE COMPETITOR.

ECOSYST. ENVIRON.,"THERE IS ONGOING CONCERN REGARDING THE OBSERVED DECLINE IN POLLINATOR POPULATIONS. MANAGING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES THROUGH AGRI-ENVIRONMENT SCHEMES (AES) SUPPORTS BIODIVERSITY AND COULD COUNTERACT POLLINATOR POPULATION DECLINES. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER ALTERATIONS TO CURRENT AES GRASSLAND MOWING REGIMES WOULD INCREASE THE ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS OF WILD BEES AND HOVERFLIES. FURTHERMORE, WE INVESTIGATED THE RESPONSE OF DIFFERENT NESTING AND FEEDING GUILDS OF WILD BEES AND HOVERFIIES, RESPECTIVELY, TO THESE REGIMES. THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL MOWING REGIMES WERE: (I) FIRST CUT NOT BEFORE 15 JUNE, BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER (SWISS AES MANAGEMENT, CONTROL MEADOWS), (II) FIRST CUT DELAYED UNTIL 15 JULY (DELAYED MEADOWS), (III) AS FOR CONTROL MEADOWS BUT LEAVING 10-20\% UNCUT AS A REFUGE (REFUGE MEADOWS). THE RATIONALE BEHIND THE DELAYED AND REFUGE MOWING REGIMES WAS EXTENDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FLORAL RESOURCES FOR POLLINATORS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING REFUGIA FOR SPECIES THAT MAY BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY MOWING. HOVERFLIES AND WILD BEES WERE COLLECTED IN 2014 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY, USING PAN-TRAPPING AND SWEEP-NETTING, ONCE BEFORE AND ONCE AFTER THE FIRST CUT. THE TWO COLLECTING METHODS SHOWED CONTRASTING RESULTS. WHILE THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE ABUNDANCE OR RICHNESS OF WILD BEES BETWEEN THE MEADOWS WHEN USING PAN TRAPS, FOLLOWING THE FIRST CUT, SWEEP-NETTING RESULTED IN A HIGHER ABUNDANCE AND RICHNESS OF WILD BEES IN DELAYED AND REFUGE MEADOWS COMPARED TO CONTROL MEADOWS. PAN-TRAPPING DETECTED A HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF HOVERFLIES IN DELAYED COMPARED TO REFUGE MEADOWS, WHEREAS SWEEP-NETTING DETECTED A HIGHER ABUNDANCE IN DELAYED AND REFUGE COMPARED TO CONTROL MEADOWS, AFTER THE FIRST CUT. SAPROPHAGOUS HOVERFLIES WERE MORE ABUNDANT IN THE CONTROL AND DELAYED THAN REFUGE MEADOWS FOLLOWING THE FIRST CUT, WHEN SAMPLED WITH PAN TRAPS. PREDATORY HOVERFIIES WERE MORE ABUNDANT AND SPECIES RICH IN DELAYED AND REFUGE COMPARED TO CONTROL MEADOWS FOLLOWING THE FIRST CUT, WHEN SAMPLED BY SWEEP NETTING. OUR STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT SIMPLE ALTERATIONS TO A COMMON AES GRASSLAND MOWING REGIME CAN ENHANCE POPULATIONS OF POLLINATORS AND NATURAL ENEMIES OF CROP PESTS. FURTHERMORE, THE CONTRASTING RESPONSE OF THE LIFE-HISTORY GUILDS INDICATES THAT PROMOTING HETEROGENEOUS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WITHIN THE LANDSCAPE IS IMPORTANT FOR SUPPORTING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES, AND MAINTAINING KEY ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SUCH AS POLLINATION AND BIOCONTROL.

BECAUSE MVI CAN ENSURE REPRODUCTION OVER A WIDER RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS THAN WHEN INSECTS ARE THE SOLE POLLINATORS, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH SYSTEMS ARE HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO PLANTS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE POLLINATION AND SOME REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS OF THE TYRRHENIAN SCROPHULARIA TRIFOLIATA, THE ONLY SPECIES OF THE GENUS POSSESSING TWO SHOWY DARK SPOTS INSIDE THE COROLLA, FOR WHICH MVI POLLINATION SYSTEM HAD BEEN INFERRED ON THE BASIS OF LIMITED CENSUSES. WE CONDUCTED FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO STUDY MVI POLLINATION AND SOME REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS AND ELUCIDATE THE ROLE OF COROLLA SPOTS, ANALYSING THEIR ULTRAVIOLET PATTERN, HISTOLOGY AND PIGMENTS VERSUS THE REST OF THE COROLLA. THE PRIMARY POLLINATORS WERE WASPS AND PASSERINE BIRDS. COROLLA SPOTS ABSORB UV LIGHT, PRESENT ABUNDANT ANTHOCYANINS AND ARE HISTOLOGICALLY IDENTICAL TO THE REST OF THE COROLLA. CONTROL FLOWERS HAD HIGHER VISITATION FREQUENCY THAN FLOWERS WITHOUT SPOTS. S.TRIFOLIATA IS SELF-COMPATIBLE, WITH EFFICIENT INTRAFLORAL PROTOGYNY AND HERKOGAMY THAT PREVENT SELF-POLLINATION BUT NOT GEITONOGAMY. WE CONFIRMED THE EXISTENCE OF A MIXED BIRD-INSECT POLLINATION SYSTEM IN S.TRIFOLIATA. THIS SYSTEM IS FOUND IN THREE OTHER SCROPHULARIA SPECIES WITH LARGE, SHOWY FLOWERS - TWO MEDITERRANEAN (S.GRANDIFLORA AND S.SAMBUCIFOLIA) AND ONE MACARONESIAN (S.CALLIANTHA).

BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS POST-ANTHESIS COLOUR CHANGE (PACC) IS WIDELY THOUGHT TO BE AN ADAPTATION TO SIGNAL FLORAL SUITABILITY TO POLLINATORS. LOTUS FILICAULIS AND LOTUS SESSILIFOLIUS ARE INSECT-POLLINATED HERBACEOUS LEGUMES WITH FLOWERS THAT OPEN YELLOW, SHIFT TO ORANGE AND FINALLY RED. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE MOLECULAR BASIS FOR FLORAL COLOUR CHANGE IN THESE LOTUS SPECIES. METHODS LOTUS FILICAULIS WAS CULTIVATED IN A GLASSHOUSE FROM WHICH POLLINATING INSECTS (BEES) WERE EXCLUDED, AND THE RATE OF COLOUR CHANGE WAS RECORDED IN BOTH UNPOLLINATED AND MANUALLY POLLINATED FLOWERS. UNPOLLINATED FLOWERS FROM BOTH THE YELLOW STAGE AND THE RED STAGE WERE SAMPLED FOR SEQUENCING. THE TRANSCRIPTOMES OF L. FILICAULIS AND L. SESSILIFOLIUS OF BOTH COLOUR STAGES WERE ANALYSED FOR DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES AND ENRICHED ONTOLOGIES. KEY RESULTS THE RATE OF PROGRESSION THROUGH PACC DOUBLED WHEN L. FILICAULIS WAS HAND-POLLINATED. DE NOVO ASSEMBLY OF RNA-SEQ READS FROM NON-MODEL LOTUS SPECIES OUTPERFORMED HETEROLOGOUS ALIGNMENT OF READS TO THE L. JAPONICUS GENOME. DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT THE CAROTENOID BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY IS UPREGULATED AT ANTHESIS WHILE THE FLAVONOID BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAY IS UPREGULATED WITH THE ONSET OF PACC IN L. FILICAULIS AND L. SESSILIFOLIUS. CONCLUSION POLLINATION SIGNIFICANTLY ACCELERATES PACC IN L. FILICAULIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PACC INCREASES POLLINATION EFFICIENCY BY DIRECTING POLLINATORS TO UNPOLLINATED FLOWERS. RNA-SEQ RESULTS SHOW THE SYNCHRONIZED UPREGULATION OF THE ENTIRE CYANIDIN BIOSYNTHESIS PATHWAY IN THE RED STAGE OF PACC IN L. FILICAULIS AND L. SESSILIFOLIUS.

OVER 75\% OF POLLINATOR VALUE IN THE USA ACCRUES THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF DOMESTICATED HONEY BEES. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL HONEY BEE COLONIES IN THE USA HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR SEVEN DECADES DUE TO PARASITIC ARTHROPODS, DISEASES, AND VARIOUS STRESSES. THE RECOGNITION THAT HONEY BEES, AND THE CROPS THEY SERVICE, ARE VULNERABLE HAS ACCELERATED THE SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE SPECIES OF BEES FOR POLLINATION OF SELECTED CROPS. FOREMOST AMONG POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES ARE NATIVE SOLITARY SPECIES SUCH AS OSMIA LIGNARIA PROPINQUA, THE ``BLUE ORCHARD BEE (BOB), WHOSE USE AS A POLLINATOR OF ALMONDS, CHERRIES, AND APPLES IS INCREASING. THE BOB OCCURS ON PUBLIC LANDS MANAGED BY THE USDA FOREST SERVICE, AND THE USDI BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.

PLANT HEIGHT IS OFTEN UNDER POLLINATOR-MEDIATED SELECTION, AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE CORRELATED WITH VARIOUS OTHER TRAITS. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EVOLUTIONARY TRAJECTORY OF PLANT HEIGHT UNDER SELECTION AND THE PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS OF PLANT HEIGHT EVOLUTION. WE CONDUCTED A BI-DIRECTIONAL ARTIFICIAL SELECTION EXPERIMENT ON PLANT HEIGHT WITH FAST CYCLING BRASSICA RAPA PLANTS TO ESTIMATE ITS HERITABILITY AND GENETIC CORRELATIONS, AND TO REVEAL EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES TO ARTIFICIAL SELECTION ON HEIGHT AND VARIOUS CORRELATED TRAITS. WITH THE DIVERGENT LINES OBTAINED THROUGH ARTIFICIAL SELECTION, WE SUBSEQUENTLY CONDUCTED POLLINATOR-CHOICE ASSAYS AND INVESTIGATED RESOURCE LIMITATION OF FRUIT PRODUCTION. WE FOUND THAT PLANT HEIGHT VARIATION IS STRONGLY GENETICALLY CONTROLLED (WITH A REALIZED HERITABILITY OF 41-59\%). THUS, PLANT HEIGHT CAN EVOLVE RAPIDLY UNDER PHENOTYPIC SELECTION. IN ADDITION, WE FOUND REMARKABLE PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS IN PHENOLOGY, MORPHOLOGY, FLORAL SCENT, COLOR, NECTAR AND LEAF GLUCOSINOLATES. MOST TRAITS WERE INCREASED IN TALL-LINE PLANTS, BUT FLOWER SIZE, UV REFLECTION AND GLUCOSINOLATES WERE DECREASED, INDICATING POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFS. POLLINATORS PREFERRED PLANTS OF THE TALL SELECTION LINES OVER THE SHORT SELECTION LINES IN BOTH GREENHOUSE EXPERIMENTS WITH BUMBLEBEES AND FIELD EXPERIMENT WITH NATURAL POLLINATORS.

ECOL. SOCIOBIOL.,"HUMAN ALTERATIONS OF HABITATS ARE CAUSING DECLINES IN MANY SPECIES WORLDWIDE. THE EXTENT OF DECLINES VARIES GREATLY AMONG CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES, FOR OFTEN UNKNOWN REASONS THAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN BIODIVERSITY. AN OVERLOOKED FACTOR IS THAT SEASONALLY BREEDING SPECIES COMPETE FOR NEST SITES, WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY LIMITED IN MANY ANTHROPOGENICALLY DEGRADED ENVIRONMENTS. I USED EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF COMPETITION BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS THAT DIFFER IN THEIR COMPETITIVE ABILITY AND TIMING OF NESTING. A RANGE OF SPECIES FOLLOWING EVOLUTIONARILY STABLE STRATEGIES CAN CO-EXIST WHEN THERE ARE SUFFICIENT NEST SITES, BUT MY MODEL PREDICTS THAT A REDUCTION IN NEST SITE AVAILABILITY HAS GREATER IMPACTS ON LATE-NESTING SPECIES, ESPECIALLY THE STRONGER COMPETITORS, WHEREAS EARLY-NESTING, STRONGER SPECIES DECLINE ONLY SLIGHTLY. THESE PREDICTIONS ARE SUPPORTED BY DATA ON 221 BIRD AND 43 BUMBLEBEE SPECIES WORLDWIDE. RESTORATION AND PROVISION OF NEST SITES SHOULD BE AN URGENT PRIORITY IN CONSERVATION EFFORTS. MORE BROADLY, THESE RESULTS INDICATE A NEW ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE OF POTENTIALLY WIDESPREAD IMPORTANCE: RAPID REDUCTIONS IN THE ABUNDANCE OF RESOURCES FOR WHICH SPECIES' PREFERENCES HAVE NOT DIVERSIFIED WILL RESULT IN UNPRECEDENTED CONFLICTS THAT REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR SPECIES CO-EXISTENCE. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES OF SPECIES DECLINES IS CRUCIAL TO PREVENTING THE LOSSES. WHILST MUCH WORK ON SPECIES VULNERABILITY SHOWS BROAD SCALE EFFECTS, AN ENDURING MYSTERY IS THE VARIATION IN POPULATION TRENDS BETWEEN CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES. I COMBINED EVOLUTIONARY MODELLING WITH THREE GLOBAL- SCALE LONG- TERM DATA SETS TO REVEAL THAT COMPETITION FOR SCARCE NEST SITES CAUSES VARIATION IN DECLINES. THE IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF NEST SITES ON DIFFERENTIAL DECLINES AMONG CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES FROM VERY DIFFERENT TAXA INDICATES A NEW ECOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE OF WIDESPREAD IMPORTANCE: THE EFFECT OF HABITAT DEGRADATION ON COMPETITION AMONG SPECIES. A LACK OF DIFFERENTIATION OF NEST SITE PREFERENCES MEANS THAT- NOW NEST SITES ARE MORE LIMITED- SOME SPECIES MAY BE DRIVING OTHERS TO EXTINCTION.

ECOL.,"POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE WIDELY ACCEPTED AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN PLANT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION. ALTHOUGH MOSTLY INVESTIGATED IN PLANTS VISITED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF POLLINATORS (E.G., HUMMINGBIRDS VS BEES), FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF POLLINATORS BELONGING TO THE SAME TAXONOMIC GROUP (E.G., ONLY BEES) ON PLANT REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATE THIS QUESTION BY EVALUATING PRE- AND POST-ZYGOTIC MECHANISMS PUTATIVELY INVOLVED IN THE REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION OF TWO OIL-REWARDING SYMPATRIC CALCEOLARIA SPECIES (I.E., CALCEOLARIA FILICAULIS AND C.

WE ESTIMATED REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION VALUES USING A COMBINATION OF FIELD (POLLINATOR VISITATION RATES) AND EXPERIMENTAL (INTRA AND INTERSPECIFIC MANUAL CROSS-POLLINATION AND SEED GERMINATION OF PARENTS AND HYBRIDS) EVIDENCE. THE TWO CALCEOLARIA SPECIES WERE PREFERENTIALLY VISITED BY DIFFERENT OIL-COLLECTING BEE SPECIES. RESULTS FROM HAND CROSS-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THAT INTRASPECIFIC CROSSINGS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SEEDS THAN INTERSPECIFIC ONES. NOTWITHSTANDING, SEED GERMINATION ESSAYS DID NOT REVEAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARENTAL AND HYBRIDS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLINATOR SPECIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION IN THE TWO CALCEOLARIA SPECIES STUDIED HERE.

MATING AND REPRODUCTIVE MATURATION ARE KNOWN TO TRIGGER CHANGES IN GENE TRANSCRIPTION IN REPRODUCTIVE TISSUES IN A WIDE RANGE OF ORGANISMS, BUT WE UNDERSTAND LITTLE ABOUT THE MOLECULAR CONSEQUENCES OF A FAILURE TO MATE OR BECOME REPRODUCTIVELY MATURE, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THESE PROCESSES TRIGGER NEURAL AS WELL AS PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE MOLECULAR PROCESSES UNDERPINNING THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES THAT ACCOMPANY THE MAJOR LIFE-HISTORY TRANSITIONS IN A KEY POLLINATOR, THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. WE COMPARED NEURO-TRANSCRIPTION IN QUEENS THAT SUCCEEDED OR FAILED IN SWITCHING FROM VIRGIN AND IMMATURE STATES, TO MATED AND REPRODUCTIVELY MATURE STATES.

BEHAV.,"SIGNALS USED IN COMMUNICATION ARE FREQUENTLY COMPLEX, BEING COMPOSED OF MULTIPLE SIGNAL COMPONENTS THAT IN COMBINATION IMPROVE INFORMATION TRANSFER. A VARIETY OF MORPHOLOGICAL PARTS ARE TYPICALLY USED TO TRANSMIT COMPONENTS OF ANY GIVEN COMPLEX SIGNAL. OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY A GIVEN MORPHOLOGICAL PART IS USED TO TRANSMIT A GIVEN SIGNAL COMPONENT IS POOR. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE FUNCTION OF A GIVEN SIGNAL COMPONENT IS IMPROVED BY ITS ASSOCIATION WITH ITS MORPHOLOGICAL PART AND THAT SUCH PARTS INTERACT FUNCTIONALLY TO TRANSMIT INFORMATION. IN A LABORATORY STUDY WE CHARACTERIZED THE FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT FLORAL SIGNAL COMPONENTS TRANSMITTED BY ASSOCIATED FLORAL PARTS AND THE INTERACTION OF THOSE SIGNAL COMPONENTS. USING SOLANUM HOUSTONII FLOWERS, WE FOCUSED ON TWO MAJOR FLORAL PARTS, COROLLA AND ANTHERS, INVOLVED IN SIGNALLING BUMBLEBEE, BOMBUS IMPATIENS, VISITORS. WE FURTHER EXAMINED HOW EXPERIENCE AFFECTED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SIGNAL COMPONENT AND FLORAL PART. FLORAL VISITS INVOLVE A STEPWISE PROCESS IN WHICH BEES APPROACH, LAND AND ACQUIRE POLLEN. WE FOUND THAT THE COROLLA PLAYS THE DOMINANT ROLE IN ELICITING APPROACHES BY BEES, WHETHER NAIVE OR EXPERIENCED. LANDING IS ELICITED BY COROLLA SIGNALS AND, TO A LESSER BUT ADDITIVE DEGREE, ANTHER SIGNALS. FOLLOWING EXPERIENCE, ANTHER SIGNALS NEARLY COMPLETELY DOMINATE COROLLA SIGNALS IN ELICITING LANDING. THE ANTHERS CONVEY SIGNALS MEDIATING POLLEN ACQUISITION, REGARDLESS OF THE BEE'S EXPERIENCE LEVEL. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THERE IS SELECTION FOR SPECIFIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SIGNAL COMPONENTS AND MORPHOLOGICAL PARTS, WHICH IN TURN MIGHT DRIVE COMPLEX SIGNAL EVOLUTION.

ECOL.,"ANIMAL POLLINATION IS A VITAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICE, AND WILD BEES ARE ESSENTIAL PROVIDERS OF THIS SERVICE FOR BOTH CROPS AND WILD FLOWERING PLANTS. THE EARLY SUCCESSIONAL STAGE OF A PLANTATION, WHICH CAN BE DOMINATED BY GRASSES AND HERBACEOUS PLANT SPECIES, CAN PROVIDE A HABITAT FOR VARIOUS SPECIES OF WILD BEES. WE SAMPLED BEES FROM 13 EARLY SUCCESSIONAL PLANTATION PATCHES OF DIFFERENT SIZES, RANGING FROM 1.3 TO 10 HA. WE THEN APPLIED A HIERARCHICAL COMMUNITY MODEL TO INFER SPECIES RICHNESS/ABUNDANCEAREA RELATIONSHIPS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT ESTIMATES OF POPULATION DENSITIES OF INDIVIDUAL SPECIES WERE UNCHANGED WITH RESPECT TO AREA, SUGGESTING THAT SMALLER PATCHES CAN HAVE THE SAME VALUE PER AREA AS LARGER PATCHES. ESTIMATED SPECIES RICHNESS INCREASED RAPIDLY FOR THE SMALL RANGE OF PATCH SIZES EXAMINED. TOTAL ABUNDANCE WAS FOUND TO LINEARLY INCREASE WITH AREA. THE INCLUSION OF RANDOM SITE EFFECTS INTO THE MODEL RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT DENSITY VARIATIONS AMONG PATCHES, THEREFORE, PATCH AREA WAS NOT THE ONLY DETERMINING FACTOR OF SPECIES ABUNDANCE. THESE OUTCOMES IN RELATION TO MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS FOR FORESTS AND PLANTATIONS SUGGEST THAT SMALL PATCHES OF EARLY SUCCESSIONAL FOREST CONTRIBUTE TO CONSERVE AND RESTORE WILD BEE DIVERSITY.

CONSERV.,"THE LONG-TERM DECLINE OF WILD AND MANAGED INSECT POLLINATORS IS A THREAT TO BOTH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT AND BIODIVERSITY, AND HAS BEEN LINKED TO DECREASING FLORAL RESOURCES. FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS OF POLLINATORS AND THEIR FLOWERING PARTNERS IS REQUIRED TO INFORM CONSERVATION EFFORTS. HERE WE EXAMINED THE PHENOLOGY OF BRITISH: (I) POLLINATOR ACTIVITY, (II) INSECT-POLLINATED PLANT FLOWERING, AND (III) EXTINCT AND ENDANGERED POLLINATOR AND PLANT SPECIES. OVER 1 MILLION RECORDS WERE COLLATED FROM THE HISTORICAL DATABASES OF THREE BRITISH INSECT MONITORING ORGANISATIONS, A GLOBAL BIODIVERSITY DATABASE AND AN AUTHORITATIVE TEXT COVERING THE NATIONAL FLORA. ALMOST TWO-THIRDS (62\%) OF POLLINATOR SPECIES HAVE PEAK FLIGHT OBSERVATIONS DURING LATE-SUMMER (JULY AND AUGUST). THIS WAS THE CASE ACROSS THREE OF THE GROUPS STUDIED: ACULEATE WASPS (71\% OF SPECIES), BEES (60\%), AND BUTTERFLIES (72\%), THE EXCEPTION BEING HOVERFLIES (49\%). WHEN SPECIES GEOGRAPHICAL RANGE (A PROXY FOR ABUNDANCE) WAS ACCOUNTED FOR, A CLEAR LATE-SUMMER PEAK WAS CLEAR ACROSS ALL GROUPS. BY CONTRAST, THERE IS MARKED TEMPORAL PARTITIONING IN THE FLOWERING OF THE MAJOR PLANT GROUPS: INSECT-POLLINATED TREE SPECIES BLOSSOMING PREDOMINANTLY DURING MAY (74\%), SHRUBS IN JUNE (69\%), AND HERBS IN JULY (83\%). THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF POLLINATOR SPECIES ON THE WING AND THE RICHNESS OF BOTH FLOWERING INSECT POLLINATED HERBS AND TREES/SHRUBS SPECIES, PER CALENDAR MONTH. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EXTINCTIONS OCCURRED IN LATE-SUMMER-FLYING POLLINATOR SPECIES THAN EXPECTED (83\% OF EXTINCT SPECIES VS. 62\% OF ALL SPECIES). THIS TREND WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BEE EXTINCTIONS (80\% VS. 60\%) AND WAS NOT APPARENT IN OTHER GROUPS. WE CONTEND THAT THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO DECLINES IN LATE-SUMMER RESOURCE SUPPLIES, WHICH ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY PROVISIONED BY HERBS, A CONSEQUENCE OF HISTORICAL LAND-USE CHANGE.

FLOWER DEVELOPMENT IS HIGHLY COORDINATED AND INVOLVES DEVELOPMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN SIZE AND SHAPE, ONTOGENETIC ALLOMETRY, WHICH IN TURN AFFECT THE MORPHOLOGY OF MATURE FLOWERS. ALTHOUGH ONTOGENETIC ALLOMETRIES CAN ACT AS A DEVELOPMENTAL CONSTRAINT AND MAY INFLUENCE ADAPTIVE EVOLUTION, ALLOMETRIES CAN EVOLVE THEMSELVES AND MAY CHANGE RAPIDLY IN RESPONSE TO SELECTION. WE EXPLORED THE EVOLUTION OF ONTOGENETIC ALLOMETRY IN THE FLOWERS OF 11 SPECIES OF LOASOIDEAE. SEVEN SPECIES BELONG TO CAIOPHORA, WHICH RADIATED RECENTLY IN THE CENTRAL ANDES, AND CONTAINS SPECIES THAT ARE POLLINATED BY BEES, HUMMINGBIRDS, AND SMALL RODENTS. ACCORDING TO A PREVIOUS STUDY, THE DIVERSIFICATION OF CAIOPHORA INVOLVED DEPARTURES FROM SIMPLE ALLOMETRIC SCALING, BUT THE CHANGES TO ALLOMETRY THAT ENABLED FLOWER DIVERSIFICATION HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED YET. WE CHARACTERIZED THE ONTOGENETIC ALLOMETRY OF EACH SPECIES WITH THE METHODS OF GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS. WE STUDIED THE EVOLUTION OF ALLOMETRIES BY CONSTRUCTING ALLOMETRIC SPACES, IN WHICH THE ALLOMETRY OF EACH SPECIES IS REPRESENTED BY A POINT AND THE ARRANGEMENT OF POINTS INDICATES THE RELATIONS AMONG ALLOMETRIC TRAJECTORIES. TO EXAMINE THE HISTORY OF CHANGES OF ONTOGENETIC ALLOMETRIES, WE PROJECTED THE PHYLOGENY INTO THE ALLOMETRIC SPACES.

DIVERSIFYING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES BY SOWING FLOWER STRIPS WITHIN FIELDS COULD REDUCE THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON BIODIVERSITY. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE STUDY PRESENTED HERE AIMED AT ASSESSING AND COMPARING THE ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF BEES (HYMENOPTERA: ANTHOPHILA) AND HOVERFLIES (DIPTERA: SYRPHIDAE) FOUND AND VISITING FLOWERS IN THREE TYPES OF FLOWER STRIPS IN BELGIUM: (I) A MIXTURE OF 11 WILD FLOWERS, (II) A MONOFLORAL STRIP OF DIMORPHOTECA PLUVIALIS (ASTERACEAE) AND (III) A MONOFLORAL STRIP OF CAMELINA SATIVA (BRASSICACEAE), WHERE THE LAST TWO ARE CONSIDERED TO BE INTERCROPS SINCE THEY ARE VALUABLE ON THE MARKET, ALL SOWN WITHIN A FIELD OF WINTER WHEAT (TRITICUM AESTIVUM L.). POLLINATORS WERE CAPTURED WITH PAN TRAPS AND BY NETTING IN STANDARDISED TRANSECTS FROM MAY TO JULY 2017. ONE-THOUSAND ONE-HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-FOUR INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO 43 BEE SPECIES AND 18 HOVERFLY SPECIES WERE COLLECTED. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HOVERFLY DIVERSITY WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT FLOWER STRIPS. THE MULTIFLORAL TREATMENT SUPPORTED A GREATER DIVERSITY OF SYRPHID SPECIES. VARIOUS POLLINATOR SPECIES VISITED THE DIFFERENT FLOWERS COMPOSING THE MIXTURE AND ALSO D. PLUVIALIS. THE POLLINATOR COMMUNITY PROVED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY GENERALIST, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN OLIGOLECTIC SPECIES IN BELGIUM, ANDRENA NITIDIUSCULA. MOREOVER, THE THREE TESTED FLOWER STRIPS WERE EFFECTIVE IN ATTRACTING HOVERFLIES, AMONG THEM NATURAL ENEMIES OF INSECT PESTS. THIS STUDY OPENS NEW PERSPECTIVES IN THE DESIGN OF INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS WITH FLOWER STRIPS TOWARDS THE DESIGN OF SUSTAINABLE AGRO-ECOSYSTEMS.

CONSERV.,"RECENT ANTHROPOGENIC FRAGMENTATION HAS LED TO POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION THREATENING VIABILITY OF MANY SPECIES, INCLUDING SPECIES SPECIALIZED ON MOUNTAINOUS ECOSYSTEMS. BOMBUS EPHIPPIATUS, A WIDESPREAD SPECIES MOSTLY FOUND IN MOUNTAINS IN THE NEOTROPICS, SEEMS TO USE THE HIGHLANDS AS ISLAND, AND DEFORESTED LOWLAND AREAS MAY REPRESENT BARRIERS TO THEIR DISPERSAL, LEADING TO ISOLATION AND POTENTIALLY LOSS OF GENETIC DIVERSITY. YET, LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF ITS POPULATION STRUCTURE DOES NOT ALLOW ADEQUATE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION. TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP, WE ASSESSED THE POPULATION STRUCTURE AND INFERRED DISPERSION OF B. EPHIPPIATUS IN TWO MOUNTAIN-RANGES IN GUATEMALA (VOLCANIC CHAIN AND SIERRA DE LAS MINAS). THIS REGION IS CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH TOPOGRAPHIC VARIATION AND CONSIDERABLE DEFORESTATION STRAIN. WE ANALYZED THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATION AND LAND-USE ON GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION OF B. EPHIPPIATUS POPULATIONS AND INFERRED ITS DEMOGRAPHY IN THE REGION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT B. EPHIPPIATUS IS ABLE TO DISPERSE LONG DISTANCES ACROSS MOST LANDSCAPE TYPES, REFLECTED BY ITS HIGH GENETIC DIVERSITY, HIGH EFFECTIVE POPULATION SIZE, CONSIDERABLE GENE FLOW, LOW POPULATION DIFFERENTIATION, AS WELL AS THE LACK OF ISOLATION BY DISTANCE. HENCE, B. EPHIPPIATUS MAY BE A RESILIENT SPECIES FOR THE PROVISION OF POLLINATION SERVICES. HOWEVER, WE DETECTED A SUBTLE DIVERGENCE OF B. EPHIPPIATUS INTO TWO CLUSTERS, OF WHICH SIERRA DE LAS MINAS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A REGIONAL HOTSPOT OF GENETIC AND SPECIES ENDEMISM. YET, DIFFERENTIATION IS VERY RECENT AND HENCE LIKELY CAUSED BY LOWLAND DEFORESTATION.

WE MODEL THE MECHANISM OF REGIME SHIFTS IN ECOSYSTEMS CONSISTING OF BUCKWHEAT FIELDS AND THE SURROUNDING NATURAL LAND WITH A THRESHOLD ESTIMATION MODEL. WE THEN FIND THAT THE FOREST AROUND THE CROP FIELDS, WHICH SERVES AS A HABITAT FOR WILD POLLINATORS, IS A DETERMINANT OF AN ECOLOGICAL THRESHOLD THAT CAUSES REGIME SHIFTS. WE CALCULATE THE SHADOW VALUE OF RESILIENCE PROVIDED BY FOREST HABITAT AROUND A UNIT OF BUCKWHEAT FIELD TO BE \$ 9,796, IMPLYING THAT THE TOTAL VALUE OF RESILIENCE IN COMPLEX NATURAL LAND AMOUNTS TO HALF OF THE STOCK PRICE OF BUCKWHEAT LAND.

ECOL.,"1. CLIMATE CHANGE IS RAPIDLY ALTERING THERMAL ENVIRONMENTS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED TEMPERATURES IN ALREADY WARM ENVIRONMENTS MAY BE PARTICULARLY STRONG BECAUSE ORGANISMS ARE LIKELY TO BE NEAR THEIR THERMAL SAFETY MARGINS, WITH LIMITED TOLERANCE TO ADDITIONAL HEAT STRESS. 2. WE CONDUCT AN IN SITU FIELD EXPERIMENT OVER 2YEARS TO INVESTIGATE THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON AN EARLY-SEASON SOLITARY BEE IN A WARM, ARID REGION OF THE SOUTHWESTERN USA. OUR FIELD EXPERIMENT MANIPULATES THE THERMAL ENVIRONMENT OF OSMIA RIBIFLORIS (MEGACHILIDAE) FROM LARVAL DEVELOPMENT THROUGH ADULT EMERGENCE, SIMULATING BOTH PREVIOUS COOLER (C. 1950, NEST BOXES PAINTED WHITE) AND FUTURE WARMER (2040-2099, NEST BOXES PAINTED BLACK) CLIMATE CONDITIONS. IN EACH YEAR, WE MEASURE ADULT EMERGENCE PHENOLOGY, LINEAR BODY SIZE, BODY MASS, FAT CONTENT AND SURVIVAL. 3. BEES IN THE WARMING TREATMENT EXHIBIT DELAYED EMERGENCE PHENOLOGY AND A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN PHENOLOGICAL VARIANCE. INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE ALSO LEAD TO REDUCTIONS IN BODY MASS AND FAT CONTENT. WHEREAS BEES IN THE COOLING AND CONTROL TREATMENTS EXPERIENCE NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS OF MORTALITY, BEES IN THE WARMING TREATMENT EXPERIENCE 30\%-75\% MORTALITY. 4. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT TEMPERATURE CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE C. 1950 HAVE LIKELY HAD RELATIVELY WEAK AND NON-NEGATIVE EFFECTS, BUT PREDICTED WARMER TEMPERATURES CREATE A HIGH STRESS THERMAL ENVIRONMENT FOR O.RIBIFLORIS. LATER AND MORE VARIABLE EMERGENCE DATES UNDER WARMING LIKELY COMPROMISE PHENOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY WITH FLORAL RESOURCES AND THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO FIND MATES. THE CONSEQUENCES OF PHENOLOGICAL ASYNCHRONY, COMBINED WITH REDUCTIONS IN BODY MASS AND FAT CONTENT, WILL LIKELY IMPOSE FITNESS REDUCTIONS FOR SURVIVING BEES. COMBINED WITH HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT O.RIBIFLORIS MAY FACE LOCAL EXTINCTION IN THE WARMER PARTS OF ITS RANGE WITHIN THE CENTURY UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE. 5. TEMPERATURE INCREASES IN ALREADY WARM ECOSYSTEMS CAN HAVE SUBSTANTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR KEY COMPONENTS OF LIFE HISTORY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURVIVAL. OUR STUDY PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT EXAMPLE OF HOW THE RESPONSES OF ECTOTHERMIC INSECTS TO TEMPERATURE INCREASES IN ALREADY WARM ENVIRONMENTS MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE.",BEES; ECTOTHERMS; HEAT STRESS; INSECTS; OSMIA; PHENOLOGICAL MISMATCH; POLLINATOR DECLINES; WARMING EXPERIMENT,OSMIA-LIGNARIA HYMENOPTERA; EMERGENCE TIME; TEMPERATURE; SIZE; BEES; ECTOTHERMS; DURATION; INSECTS; IMPACTS; FITNESS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"CARADONNA, PJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHICAGO BOT GARDEN, GLENCOE, IL 60022 USA.;CARADONNA, PAUL J., ILER, AMY M., CHICAGO BOT GARDEN, GLENCOE, IL 60022 USA.;CARADONNA, PAUL J., NORTHWESTERN UNIV, PROGRAM PLANT BIOL \& CONSERVAT, EVANSTON, IL USA.;CARADONNA, PAUL J., CUNNINGHAM, JAMES L., UNIV ARIZONA, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, TUCSON, AZ USA.;CARADONNA, PAUL J., UNIV COPENHAGEN, NAT HIST MUSEUM DENMARK, CTR MACROECOL EVOLUT \& CLIMATE, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.;ILER, AMY M., AARHUS UNIV, AARHUS INST ADV STUDIES, AARHUS, DENMARK.",10.1111/1365-2435.13151,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,NSFNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [DGE 11-43953]; DANISH NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATIONDANMARKS GRUNDFORSKNINGSFOND,"NSF, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: DGE 11-43953; DANISH NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION",0269-8463,10,2345-2356,WILEY,32,2018,ISI000446322200008,63,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,57,ECOLOGY,PCARADONNACHICAGOBOTANIC.ORG,GV7PX,"CARADONNA, PJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHICAGO BOT GARDEN, GLENCOE, IL 60022 USA",ISI,none,NORTHWESTERN UNIV;UNIV ARIZONA;UNIV COPENHAGEN;AARHUS UNIV,NOTREPORTED,NA,"CARADONNA PJ, 2018, FUNCT ECOL","CARADONNA PJ, 2018, FUNCT ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

EVOL.,"TROPICAL FOREST LOSS AND FRAGMENTATION CAN CHANGE BEE COMMUNITY DYNAMICS AND POTENTIALLY INTERRUPT PLANT-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS. WHILE BEE COMMUNITY RESPONSES TO FOREST FRAGMENTATION HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN A NUMBER OF TROPICAL REGIONS, NO STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THIS TOPIC IN AUSTRALIA. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINE TAXONOMIC AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY OF BEES VISITING FLOWERS OF THREE TREE SPECIES ACROSS SMALL AND LARGE RAINFOREST FRAGMENTS IN AUSTRALIAN TROPICAL LANDSCAPES. WE FOUND LOWER TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY OF BEES VISITING FLOWERS OF TREES IN SMALL RAINFOREST FRAGMENTS COMPARED WITH LARGE FOREST FRAGMENTS AND SHOW THAT BEE SPECIES IN SMALL FRAGMENTS WERE SUBSETS OF SPECIES IN LARGER FRAGMENTS. BEES VISITING TREES IN SMALL FRAGMENTS ALSO HAD HIGHER MEAN BODY SIZES THAN THOSE IN LARGER FRAGMENTS, SUGGESTING THAT SMALL-SIZED BEES MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO PERSIST IN SMALL FRAGMENTS. LASTLY, WE FOUND REDUCTIONS IN THE ABUNDANCE OF EUSOCIAL STINGLESS BEES VISITING FLOWERS IN SMALL FRAGMENTS COMPARED TO LARGE FRAGMENTS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POLLINATOR VISITS TO NATIVE TREES LIVING IN SMALL TROPICAL FOREST REMNANTS MAY BE REDUCED, WHICH MAY IN TURN IMPACT ON A RANGE OF PROCESSES, POTENTIALLY INCLUDING FOREST REGENERATION AND DIVERSITY MAINTENANCE IN SMALL FOREST REMNANTS IN AUSTRALIAN TROPICAL COUNTRYSIDE LANDSCAPES.",APOIDEA; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; TETRAGONULA; TROPICAL FOREST,PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS; STINGLESS BEES; FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY; FRUIT-SET; CROP POLLINATION; EUGLOSSINE BEES; FORAGING RANGES; CONSERVATION; LANDSCAPE; BIODIVERSITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"SMITH, TJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV QUEENSLAND, SCH BIOL SCI, ST LUCIA CAMPUS, ST LUCIA, QLD, AUSTRALIA.;SMITH, TOBIAS J., MAYFIELD, MARGARET M., UNIV QUEENSLAND, SCH BIOL SCI, ST LUCIA CAMPUS, ST LUCIA, QLD, AUSTRALIA.",10.1002/ECE3.4339,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",NA,ARCFONDATION ARC POUR LA RECHERCHE SUR LE CANCERAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL [LP0989161],"ARC, GRANT/AWARD NUMBER: LP0989161",2045-7758,16,8204-8216,WILEY,8,2018,ISI000444946300038,99,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",13,"ECOLOGY, EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY",TOBIAS.SMITHUQCONNECT.EDU.AU,GU0NC,"SMITH, TJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV QUEENSLAND, SCH BIOL SCI, ST LUCIA CAMPUS, ST LUCIA, QLD, AUSTRALIA",ISI,none,UNIV QUEENSLAND,UNIV QUEENSLAND,NA,"SMITH TJ, 2018, ECOL EVOL","SMITH TJ, 2018, ECOL EVOL",NA,NA,NA,NA

THESE COMPOUNDS ARE CONSIDERED SAFE CONTROL AGENTS SINCE THEY HAVE LOW TOXICITY TO NON-TARGET ORGANISMS. THUS, THIS STUDY AIMED TO SELECT POTENTIAL EOS FROM THE MYRTACEAE FAMILY AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS FOR THE CONTROL OF ASCIA MONUSTE (GODART) AND TO EVALUATE THOSE EOS SELECTIVITY TO TWO NON-TARGET ORGANISMS (SOLENOPSIS SAEVISSIMA SMITH AND TETRAGONISCA ANGUSTULA LATREILLE). TWELVE EOS, EXTRACTED BY HYDRODISTILLATION FROM CORYMBIA AND EUCALYPTUS PLANTS, WERE TESTED IN THIS STUDY. ALL TOXICITY BIOASSAYS WERE PERFORMED BY TOPICAL APPLICATION. C. CITRIODORA EO HAD THE HIGHEST INSECTICIDAL ACTIVITY AGAINST A. MONUSTE (LD50=20.61 MU G/MG) AND ALSO PRESENTED A FAST ACTION (LT50 < 10 MIN). CITRONELLAL WAS THE MAIN COMPOUND OF C. CITRIODORA EO (86.8\% OF THE OIL CONSTITUTION) AND EXHIBITED TOXICITY SIMILAR TO THIS EO. THE OTHER COMPOUNDS CAUSED NO SIGNIFICANT MORTALITY. HENCE, THE TOXICITY OF THE C. CITRIODORA EO IS MOSTLY EXPLAINED BY THE CITRONELLAL ACTIVITY. THIS EO WAS SELECTIVE IN FAVOR OF THE PREDATORY ANT S. SAEVISSIMA BUT CAUSED HIGH MORTALITY OF THE POLLINATOR BEE T ANGUSTULA. THEREFORE, C. CITRIODORA EO IS A PROMISING MODEL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INSECTICIDES AGAINST A. MONUSTE.

ECOL.,"MOST CROPS GROWN IN EUROPE, INCLUDING SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNULUS L.), BENEFIT FROM INSECT POLLINATION. HOWEVER, VALUING THIS BENEFIT IS NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD SINCE ESTIMATES OF THE INCREASE IN SUNFLOWER YIELD VARY FROM 18\% TO 100\%. MOST ESTIMATES HAVE, MOREOVER, BEEN PERFORMED AT PLANT SCALE, A SCALE THAT IS NOT RELEVANT FOR FARMERS WHO CALCULATE AT THE FIELD SCALE. IN THIS FOUR-YEAR STUDY, WE QUANTIFIED THE CONTRIBUTION OF INSECT POLLINATION TO SUNFLOWER YIELD AT FIELD AND PLANT SCALES IN WORKING FARM FIELDS DISTRIBUTED ALONG A GRADIENT OF POLLINATOR DIVERSITY AND ABUNDANCE. POLLINATORS WERE FOUND TO INCREASE FIELD YIELD UP TO 40\% (I.E. 0.7 T/HA) AND BY 31.3\% AT PLANT SCALE, THE MAGNITUDE OF EFFECT ON YIELD BEING THEREFORE SIMILAR AT BOTH SCALES. THE POLLINATORS INCREASED THE YIELD BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF FERTILIZED SEEDS PER PLANT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE UNIT MASS OF THE SEEDS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN NUMBER OF SEEDS AND UNIT MASS. AMONG POLLINATORS, HONEYBEES WERE THE MAIN TAXON IMPACTING SUNFLOWER YIELD. SUNFLOWER PLANT DENSITY WAS A STRONG DETERMINANT OF YIELD, WITH HIGHER NUMBERS ATTRACTING INCREASED NUMBERS OF HONEYBEES. USING POLLINATOR AND WIND EXCLUSION, WE FINALLY QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF SELF-POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 40\%), INSECT POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 35\%) AND WIND POLLINATION (SIMILAR TO 20\%). OUR RESULTS SHOW, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE FIRST EVIDENCE OF THE KEY ROLE OF POLLINATORS IN SUNFLOWER PRODUCTION AT FIELD SCALE IN REAL FARMING CONDITIONS, AND UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO MAINTAIN SUITABLE CONDITIONS FOR POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES.

LINNEAN SOC.,"MORPHOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS BETWEEN FLOWERS AND POLLINATORS ARE THOUGHT TO REFLECT NATURAL SELECTION BY EXCLUDING INEFFECTIVE POLLINATORS AND INCREASING POLLINATION EFFICIENCY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED A VARIETY OF TUBE OR SPUR FLOWER SHAPES THAT INFLUENCE THE FUNCTIONAL FIT BETWEEN POLLINATOR AND PLANT. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE OPEN' FLOWER TYPES, WHICH LIKE THOSE OF RANUNUCULUS S.L. ARE INTERPRETED AS GENERALIST FLOWERS'. HOWEVER, PETALS IN RANUNUCULUS S.L. HAVE NECTARY SCALES WHICH VARY IN SHAPE, AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEIR DIVERSITY REFLECTS ADAPTATION TO DIFFERENT POLLINATOR TRAITS, WE COMPARED RANUNCULUS JAPONICUS WITH FLAP-LIKE NECTARY SCALES TO HALERPESTES RUTHENICA AND BATRACHIUM BUNGEI WITH CUP-LIKE AND RING-LIKE NECTARY SCALES. VISITATION RATE, VISIT DURATION AND POLLINATOR EFFICIENCY OF EACH GROUP WERE COMPARED TO DISTINGUISH TRUE POLLINATORS FROM VISITORS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS ALSO USED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PETAL NECTARY SCALE SHAPES AND MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS OF PROBOSCIDES OF POLLINATORS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT FLAP-LIKE NECTARY SCALES EXCLUDE HOVERFLIES FROM ACCESSING NECTAR AND INCREASE BOTH THE LENGTH OF VISITS BY SMALL BEES AND POLLEN TRANSFER EFFICIENCY. IN CONTRAST, CUP- AND RING-LIKE NECTARY SCALES PARTIALLY ALLOWED NECTAR ACCESS TO HOVERFLIES.

CONSERV.,"GLOBALLY, COASTAL HUMAN POPULATION DENSITY IS APPROXIMATELY THREE TIMES THAN THAT OF INLAND AREAS. SUCH DEVELOPMENT THREATENS THE INTEGRITY OF COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. COASTAL DUNE SYSTEMS CONTAIN UNIQUE SETS OF TERRESTRIAL INVERTEBRATES AND NATIVE PLANTS, AND REPRESENT SOME OF THE LAST REMAINING AREAS OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITATS ALONG THE COASTS. IN OUR STUDY, WE MONITORED BEE AND FLOWERING PLANT ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY WITHIN COASTAL DUNE SYSTEMS LOCATED WITHIN PROTECTED LANDS AND DEVELOPED SITES THROUGHOUT SOUTH AND CENTRAL FLORIDA. OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS DUNE DEGRADATION AND DEVELOPMENT COULD HAVE ON THESE ECONOMICALLY AND ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT INSECTS. A TOTAL OF 5419 BEES FROM 5 FAMILIES AND 56 TAXA WERE CAPTURED USING BOWL TRAPS. HALICTIDAE ACCOUNTED FOR 70\% OF ALL BEES COLLECTED, FOLLOWED BY APIDAE (28\%), MEGACHILIDAE (2\%), ANDRENIDAE (0.1\%) AND COLLETIDAE (0.07\%). BOTH SPECIES RICHNESS AND SHANNON-WIENER DIVERSITY INDICES WERE HIGHER IN PROTECTED LANDS WHEN COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED SITES. A MAJORITY OF THE COMMONLY COLLECTED BEE SPECIES SHOWED HIGHER ABUNDANCES IN PROTECTED LANDS COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED SITES. PROTECTED LANDS ALSO SUPPORTED HIGHER ABUNDANCES OF GROUND, WOOD, AND TUNNEL-NESTING BEES WHEN COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED SITES. BEE SPECIES RICHNESS AND SHANNON-WIENER INDICES WERE LOWER IN SITES WITH GREATER PERCENTAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE DUNE SYSTEMS, AND HIGHER IN SITES WITH GREATER AVAILABILITY OF DUNE COVERAGE. WE OBSERVED HIGHER ABUNDANCE AND FLOWERING PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS WITHIN PROTECTED LANDS WHEN COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED SITES, PROTECTED LANDS ALSO SUPPORTED MORE FEDERALLY ENDANGERED/THREATENED OR STATE PROTECTED PLANT SPECIES COMPARED WITH DEVELOPED SITES.

A NEW INFLORESCENCE BALL FORMED EACH YEAR WITH DEVELOPING FRUITS THAT WERE INITIATED THE PREVIOUS YEAR, THUS REPRODUCTION IS A CONTINUOUS CYCLE. THE TOTAL POLLEN PRODUCTION WITHIN A TREE RANGED BETWEEN 4.0X10(7) AND 9.3X10(7). ANTHESIS PEAKED BETWEEN 08:00 AND 10:00. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF MICRO-ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION ON ANTHESIS (F=243.8, P=3.01). A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF LATERAL SHOOTS AND TOTAL INFLORESCENCE SHOWED THAT THE INFLORESCENCE PRODUCTION IN C.

BODY SIZE MEASUREMENTS (INTERTEGULAR DISTANCE) FROM 72 SPECIES COLLECTED WERE INCLUDED AS DEPENDENT VARIABLES IN RESPONSE TO FOREST AREA, FOREST EDGE, AND CONNECTIVITY OF FOREST PATCHES AT SEVERAL SPATIAL SCALES. WE FIND THAT STINGLESS BEE BODY SIZE IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO FOREST COVER: MEAN COMMUNITY BODY SIZE WAS LARGER IN AREAS WITH GREATER AMOUNTS OF DEFORESTATION, AND SMALLER IN AREAS WITH LESS DEFORESTATION. SECOND, STINGLESS BEE SPECIES RICHNESS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREST EDGE REGARDLESS OF BODY SIZE. LASTLY, WE FIND THAT AS FOREST PATCH ISOLATION INCREASED, THE STINGLESS BEE COMMUNITY BODY SIZE ALSO INCREASED. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT HYPOTHESES THAT SMALL STINGLESS BEE SPECIES MIGHT BE MORE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY DEFORESTATION, ADDING TO THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT STINGLESS BEES REQUIRE AREAS OF INTACT FOREST IN NEAR PROXIMITY TO OTHER FOREST PATCHES TO CONSERVE THESE DIVERSE POLLINATOR COMMUNITIES.",BODY SIZE; STINGLESS BEES; BRAZIL; DEFORESTATION; INTERTEGULAR DISTANCE,SOLITARY BEE; MELIPONA; LANDSCAPE; RESPONSES; FOREST; FRAGMENTATION; POLLINATION; CAPACITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"MAYES, DM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV KANSAS, DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUTIONARY BIOL, HAWORTH HALL,1200 SUNNYSIDE AVE, LAWRENCE, KS 66045 USA.;MAYES, D.

ECOL.,"IN MANY PLANT SPECIES, FLOWER SIZE IS CORRELATED WITH THE PRODUCTION OF FLORAL REWARDS SUCH AS NECTAR AND POLLEN AND, THEREFORE, PROVIDES INFORMATION TO POLLINATORS ABOUT FLOWER QUALITY. HOWEVER, HOW RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FLOWER SIZE AND REWARDS INFLUENCE PLANT FITNESS IS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER INDICATING TO POLLINATORS WHICH FLOWERS ARE UNREWARDING HARMS OR BENEFITS PLANTS. WE USED A LABORATORY SYSTEM WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS TO EXAMINE BUMBLEBEES' (BOMBUS IMPATIENS) RESPONSES TO PLANTS THAT HAD FLOWER SIZE AS AN INFORMATIVE CUE (WITH LARGE FLOWERS REWARDING AND SMALL FLOWERS UNREWARDING) AS COMPARED WITH ``DECEPTIVE PLANTS THAT HAD A MIXTURE OF REWARDING AND UNREWARDING LARGE FLOWERS AND PLANTS WITH ONLY LARGE, REWARDING FLOWERS. BEES HAD PREVIOUSLY FORAGED IN A CONTEXT IN WHICH ONLY LARGE FLOWERS PROVIDED REWARDS. SMALL FLOWERS WERE VISITED LESS OFTEN THAN LARGE FLOWERS. IN COMPARING PLANTS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF FLOWERS, WE FOUND THAT SMALL FLOWERS, ALTHOUGH THEY ADDED LESS TO A PLANT'S ATTRACTIVENESS THAN LARGE FLOWERS, DID INCREASE A PLANT'S ATTRACTIVENESS IF PRESENT IN SUFFICIENT NUMBER. FURTHERMORE, PLANTS WITH INFORMATIVE CUES RECEIVED SUBSTANTIALLY FEWER FLOWER VISITS PER PLANT VISIT IN COMPARISON WITH DECEPTIVE PLANTS, EVEN WHEN THE PLANTS WITH INFORMATIVE CUES HAD A LARGER NUMBER OF FLOWERS. CUES IDENTIFYING UNREWARDING FLOWERS COULD, THEREFORE, REDUCE RATES OF WITHIN-PLANT POLLEN MOVEMENT, INCREASING THE PLANT'S FITNESS GAINS PER FLOWER VISIT. THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO WHOLE-PLANT ATTRACTIVENESS AND AVOIDANCE OF INBREEDING COULD HELP EXPLAIN WHY MANY PLANTS PRODUCE SMALL, RELATIVELY UNREWARDING FLOWERS EVEN THOUGH POLLINATORS AVOID VISITING THEM.",FLORAL REWARDS; FORAGING BEHAVIOR; GEITONOGAMY; HONEST SIGNALS; PATCH DEPARTURE; POLLINATION,FLORAL COLOR-CHANGE; FREQUENCY-DEPENDENT SELECTION; BUMBLE-BEES; INFLORESCENCE ARCHITECTURE; POLLINATOR ATTRACTION; FORAGING BUMBLEBEES; EMPTY FLOWERS; NECTAR; EVOLUTION; DISPLAY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ESSENBERG, CJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), BATES COLL, DEPT BIOL, 44 CAMPUS AVE, LEWISTON, ME 04240 USA.;ESSENBERG, CARLA J., GUEVARRA, PAIGE E., MOREAU, HADLEY M., JORDAN, CODY J., ZISMAN, TALIA, BATES COLL, DEPT BIOL, 44 CAMPUS AVE, LEWISTON, ME 04240 USA.;GUEVARRA, PAIGE E., COLUMBIA UNIV, DEPT GENET \& DEV, COLL PHYS \& SURG, 701 WEST 168TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10032 USA.",10.1093/BEHECO/ARZ065,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,SHERMAN FAIRCHILD FOUNDATION; BATES COLLEGE SCIENCE FELLOWS PROGRAM; BATES COLLEGE,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY A GRANT TO BATES COLLEGE FROM THE SHERMAN FAIRCHILD FOUNDATION, BY THE BATES COLLEGE SCIENCE FELLOWS PROGRAM, AND BY FACULTY START-UP FUNDS FROM BATES COLLEGE.",1045-2249,4,1168-1175,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,30,2019,ISI000493378300032,66,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",5,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",CESSENBEBATES.EDU,JI3PL,"ESSENBERG, CJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), BATES COLL, DEPT BIOL, 44 CAMPUS AVE, LEWISTON, ME 04240 USA",ISI,none,BATES COLL;COLUMBIA UNIV,BATES COLL,NA,"ESSENBERG CJ, 2019, BEHAV ECOL","ESSENBERG CJ, 2019, BEHAV ECOL",NA,NA,NA,NA
