CONTROL,"THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF BIOFUNGICIDES FOR THE CONTROL OF IMPORTANT PLANT PATHOGENS, SUCH AS THE GRAY MOLD BOTRYTIS CINEREA, REQUIRES INVESTIGATION DUE TO THE GENERAL REQUIREMENT FOR VERY LOW PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN FOODSTUFFS, AND CONCERNS OVER THE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE TO THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CHEMICAL FUNGICIDES. FURTHERMORE, THE USE OF BUMBLEBEES AS POLLINATORS IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS GENERATED THE NEED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS AGAINST THESE INSECTS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SIDE-EFFECTS OF TWO COMMERCIAL TRICHODERMA-BASED BIOFUNGICIDES AGAINST THE BUMBLEBEE BOMBUS TERRESTRIS. THE TWO COMMERCIAL COMPOUNDS TESTED WERE BINAB-TF-WP AND BINAB-TF-WP-KONC, BOTH OF WHICH CONTAIN COMBINATIONS OF TRICHODERMA HARZIANUM ATCC20476 AND DICHODERMA POLYSPORUM ATCC20475. THE BUMBLEBEES WERE EXPOSED TO THE BIOCONTROL AGENTS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS AT THEIR RESPECTIVE MAXIMUM CONCENTRATION IN THE FIELD (MFRC), AND THEN EXPOSED VIA THREE POTENTIAL ROUTES OF EXPOSURE: DERMAL CONTACT, ORALLY VIA THE DRINKING OF TREATED SUGAR WATER, AND VIA TREATED POLLEN. THE TREATMENTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH RECORDING WORKER MORTALITY (LETHAL EFFECTS) AND ANY EFFECTS ON THE PRODUCTION OF DRONES (SUBLETHAL EFFECTS). THE LABORATORY TESTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS DID NOT CAUSE WORKER MORTALITY OR ADVERSELY AFFECT REPRODUCTION. IN ADDITION, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THE TRICHODERMA-BASED PRODUCTS COULD SURVIVE OR GROW ON THE BODIES OF THE ADULT WORKERS. IN NO CASE WAS SURVIVAL OR GROWTH OF THE BIOFUNGICIDE OBSERVED ON THE WORKERS. WHEN THE EFFECTS OF THESE COMPOUNDS WERE EVALUATED AGAINST BUMBLEBEE LARVAE (THIRD AND FOURTH INSTARS), NO ENTOMOPATHOGENIC EFFECTS WERE FOUND. OVERALL, THE RESULTS OBTAINED UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS INDICATE THAT THE TWO BINAB PRODUCTS ARE SAFE FOR USE IN COMBINATION WITH B. TERRESTRIS. (C) 2008 ELSEVIER INC.

IN AN INTENSIVELY FARMED AREA OF NORTHEAST ITALY WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER ISOLATED ORGANIC FARMS, IN A CONVENTIONALLY FARMED LANDSCAPE, PROVIDED LOCAL BENEFITS FOR INSECT POLLINATORS AND POLLINATION SERVICES. WE QUANTIFIED THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF LOCAL MANAGEMENT (I.E. THE FARM SYSTEM), LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT (PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND) AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THEM. WE COMPARED SIX ORGANIC AND SIX CONVENTIONAL VINE FIELDS. THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND WAS CALCULATED FOR EACH SITE AT RADII OF 200, 500, 1000 AND 2000 M. THE ORGANIC FIELDS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE CONVENTIONAL IN THEIR FLORAL RESOURCES OR PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE AND SPECIES RICHNESS, VISITATION RATES TO, AND POLLINATION OF EXPERIMENTAL POTTED PLANTS. NONE OF THESE FACTORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE FARMING SYSTEM. THE ABUNDANCE OF VISITS TO THE POTTED PLANTS IN THE CONVENTIONAL FIELDS TENDED TO BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. THE PROPORTION FRUIT SET, WEIGHT OF SEEDS PER PLANT AND SEED WEIGHT IN CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC FIELDS WERE ALL NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SURROUNDING UNCULTIVATED LAND. IN VINE FIELDS THE IMPACT OF THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE WAS STRONGER THAN THE LOCAL MANAGEMENT. ENHANCEMENT OF BIODIVERSITY THROUGH ORGANIC FARMING SHOULD NOT BE ASSUMED TO BE UBIQUITOUS, AS POTENTIAL BENEFITS MAY BE OFFSET BY THE CROP TYPE, ORGANIC-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE SPECIFIC HABITAT REQUIREMENTS IN THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE.

REV.,"THE MEDITERRANEAN FLORA IS SPECTACULARLY RICH IN ORCHID SPECIES THAT HAVE EVOLVED REMARKABLE ADAPTATIONS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ORCHIDS HAVE COMPLEX AND DELICATE INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR POLLINATORS, WHICH MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION. CONSERVATION ACTIONS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED FOR A RANGE OF ENDANGERED MEDITERRANEAN ORCHID SPECIES, BUT THE CURRENT TAXONOMIC CONFUSION IN SEVERAL GENERA AND THE APPARENT DISAGREEMENT AMONG ORCHID TAXONOMISTS MAKE THE SITUATION PARTICULARLY CONFUSING FROM A CONSERVATION PERSPECTIVE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DOCUMENT HOW THE DIFFERENT POLLINATION SYNDROMES OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS (NECTAR REWARD, SHELTER OFFERING, FOOD DECEPTION AND SEXUAL DECEPTION) CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF REPRODUCTIVE BARRIERS AMONG SPECIES, ON FLORAL PHENOTYPIC VARIATION AS WE PERCEIVE IT, ON POTENTIALLY RELATED PROCESSES OF SPECIES SORTING AND EXTINCTION AND, CONSEQUENTLY, SHOULD HAVE A STRONG INFLUENCE ON THE RELATED CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS. WE ALSO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE MAJORITY OF MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS ARE POLLINATED BY SPECIALISED BEES OFTEN OCCUPYING OTHERWISE NARROW ECOLOGICAL NICHES (E.G. POLLEN SPECIALISATION, BROOD CELL PARASITES, SPECIFIC NESTING SITE). THIS CONDITION MAKES THE ORCHID-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS VERY FRAGILE AND SEVERAL ORCHID SPECIES PRONE TO LOCAL EXTINCTION. WE ILLUSTRATE THIS PHENOMENON BY A SELECTION OF CASE STUDIES THAT SHOW HOW THE ADEQUATE INTEGRATION OF THE ECOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS/TRAITS OF THE ORCHIDS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED POLLINATORS INTO CONSERVATION ACTIONS COULD HELP PROTECT ENDANGERED SPECIES AND ENSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE OFTEN COMPLEX LOCAL POLLINATION WEB.",MEDITERRANEAN ORCHIDS; POLLINATION SYNDROMES; CONSERVATION STRATEGIES,SEXUALLY DECEPTIVE ORCHID; FLORAL MIMICRY; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; EPIPHYTIC ORCHID; BEES HYMENOPTERA; FRUIT PRODUCTION; FORAGING RANGES; HARMONIC RADAR; GENUS-OPHRYS; POPULATIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,27,"VEREECKEN, NJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BRUSSELS, AVE FD ROOSEVELT 50,CP 160-12, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., FREE UNIV BRUSSELS, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., UNIV LIBRE BRUXELLES, B-1050 BRUSSELS, BELGIUM.;VEREECKEN, NICOLAS J., UNIV ZURICH, INST SYSTEMAT BOT, CH-8008 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;DAFNI, AMOTS, UNIV HAIFA, INST EVOLUT, DEPT EVOLUTIONARY \& ENVIRONM BIOL, IL-31905 HAIFA, ISRAEL.;COZZOLINO, SALVATORE, UNIV NAPLES FEDERICO II, DEPT STRUCT \& FUNCT BIOL, I-80126 NAPLES, ITALY.",10.1007/S12229-010-9049-5,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",FRS-FNRS (BELGIUM)FONDS DE LA RECHERCHE SCIENTIFIQUE - FNRS,"WE WISH TO THANK ROBERT PEMBERTON, STELLA WATTS AND HONG LIU FOR THEIR CRITICAL READING OF THE PAPER AND FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS.

FRUIT TREES AND BUSHES (APPLE MALUS DOMESTICA, PEAR PYRUS COMMUNIS, ROWAN SORBUS AUCUPARIA, WILD ROSE ROSA RUGOSA, TWISTINGWOOD VIBURNUM LANTANA, AND EUROPEAN CRANBERRY BUSH VIBURNUM OPULUS) THAT ARE ALL POLLINATED BY INSECTS PRODUCED FEWER FRUIT IN HIGHLY RADIOACTIVELY CONTAMINATED AREAS, PARTLY LINKED TO THE LOCAL REDUCTION IN ABUNDANCE OF POLLINATORS. THIS WAS THE CASE EVEN WHEN CONTROLLING FOR THE FACT THAT FRUIT TREES WERE GENERALLY SMALLER IN MORE CONTAMINATED AREAS. FRUIT-EATING BIRDS LIKE THRUSHES AND WARBLERS THAT ARE KNOWN SEED DISPERSERS WERE LESS NUMEROUS IN AREAS WITH LOWER FRUIT ABUNDANCE, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECTS OF RADIATION, PROVIDING A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN RADIATION, POLLINATOR ABUNDANCE, FRUIT ABUNDANCE AND ABUNDANCE OF FRUGIVORES. GIVEN THAT THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER HAPPENED 25 YEARS AGO, ONE WOULD PREDICT REDUCED LOCAL RECRUITMENT OF FRUIT TREES IF FRUIT SET HAS BEEN PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED DURING THAT PERIOD, INDEED, LOCAL RECRUITMENT WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO THE LEVEL OF RADIATION AND POSITIVELY TO THE LOCAL LEVEL OF FRUIT SET. THE PATTERNS AT THE LEVEL OF TREES WERE REPLICATED AT THE LEVEL OF VILLAGES ACROSS THE STUDY SITE. THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST LARGE-SCALE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF A SUPPRESSED POLLINATOR COMMUNITY ON ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING.",CHERNOBYL; ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONING; FRUITS; PLANT RECRUITMENT; RADIATION,PLANT REPRODUCTION; POLLEN LIMITATION; RADIATION; CONSEQUENCES; ABUNDANCE; RESPONSES; BIRDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,20,"MOLLER, AP (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PARIS 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, LAB ECOL SYSTEMAT \& EVOLUT, BATIMENT 362, F-91405 ORSAY, FRANCE.;MOLLER, ANDERS PAPE, UNIV PARIS 11, CNRS, UMR 8079, LAB ECOL SYSTEMAT \& EVOLUT, F-91405 ORSAY, FRANCE.;BARNIER, FLORIAN, CNRS, CTR ETUD BIOL CHIZE, F-79360 VILLIERS EN BOIS, FRANCE.;MOUSSEAU, TIMOTHY A., UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT BIOL SCI, COLUMBIA, SC 29208 USA.",10.1007/S00442-012-2374-0,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",US NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF); UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INITIATIVE COMMITTEE (ERIC); UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA SCHOOL OF THE ENVIRONMENT; NATO CLG PROGRAMNATO; CRDF; FULBRIGHT PROGRAM; NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETYNATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY; SAMUEL FREEMAN CHARITABLE TRUST,"WE GRATEFULLY ACKNOWLEDGE LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND HELP IN UKRAINE BY I.

GRIBEL R;GIBBS PE;QUEIROZ AL,GRIBEL R,FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND POLLINATION BIOLOGY OF CEIBA PENTANDRA (BOMBACACEAE) IN CENTRAL AMAZONIA,JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY,J. TROP. ECOL.,"THE FLOWERING AND FRUITING PHENOLOGY, FLORAL BIOLOGY, POLLINATION ECOLOGY, AND BREEDING SYSTEM OF THE EMERGENT TREE CEIBA PENTANDRA WERE STUDIED IN THE BRAZILIAN CENTRAL AMAZON. OF THE 21 TREES STUDIED, 17 FLOWERED ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE 6-Y STUDY PERIOD. THE MASS FLOWERING AND RELATIVELY HIGH PRODUCTION OF NECTAR PER FLOWER (MEAN OF 310 MU L) RESULTED IN A HIGH NECTAR PRODUCTION (OVER 200 PER TREE PER SEASON). FLOWERS WERE VISITED BY A WIDE RANGE OF NOCTURNAL (BATS, MARSUPIALS, NIGHT MONKEYS, HAWK MOTHS) AND DIURNAL (BEES, WASPS, HUMMINGBIRDS) ANIMALS, BUT ONLY PHYLLOSTOMID BATS, ESPECIALLY PHYLLOSTOMUS HASTATUS AND PHYLLOSTOMUS DISCOLOR, PLAYED A RELEVANT ROLE PROMOTING CROSS-POLLINATION, POLLINATIONS WHICH OCCURRED IN THE EARLY MORNING BY DIURNAL FLORAL VISITORS WERE INEFFECTIVE SINCE POLLEN TUBES DID NOT TRAVERSE THE STYLE AND REACH THE OVARY BEFORE STYLAR ABSCISSION. DESPITE THE APPARENTLY NORMAL GROWTH OF THE SELF-POLLEN TUBES, CONTROLLED POLLINATIONS CARRIED OUT IN ONE TREE REVEALED NO FRUIT SET BY SELFING AND 16.8\% FRUIT SET BY CROSSING. PROGENY ANALYSIS FROM THIS `SELF-INCOMPATIBLE' TREE USING ISOZYME MARKERS SHOWED THAT FRUITS RESULTING FROM MIXED-POLLINATION (I.E., 50\% SELF-PLUS 50\% CROSS-POLLEN ON THE STIGMA) SET ONLY 1.6\% OF SELFED SEEDS. THE PERCENTAGE OF OUTCROSSED SEEDS IN FRUITS RESULTING FROM OPEN-POLLINATION IN TWO NEIGHBOURING PLANTED TREES, WHICH FLOWERED IN ISOLATION AND CONCOMITANTLY, WAS ESTIMATED AT 91\% AND 71\%.

EVOL.,"VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF ATAMISQUEA EMARGINATA MIERS EX HOOK. ET ARN. WERE STUDIED IN A POPULATION FROM TUCUMAN, NORTHERN ARGENTINA. FLOWERING TOOK PLACE IN LATE (AUSTRAL) SPRING TO EARLY SUMMER. THE CREAMY WHITE, ENTOMOPHILOUS FLOWERS WERE PROTANDROUS AND LASTED 3.5-4.5 DAYS. A PLEASANT ODOR ALONG WITH NECTAR AND POLLEN ATTRACTED 36 MOSTLY DIURNAL INSECT SPECIES OF WHICH 41.7\% WERE HYMENOPTERA, 38.9\% LEPIDOPTERA AND 19.4\% DIPTERA. HOWEVER, 75\% FROM ALL RECORDED SPECIES WERE INFREQUENT, AND DOMESTIC BEES MADE CA. 94\% OF ALL VISITS. ONE HALICTID BEE, ONE SPHECID WASP, ONE MYZINID WASP, FOUR SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED BUTTERFLIES AND A HAWKMOTH COMPLETED THE SET OF RELATIVELY FREQUENT INSECT VISITORS. POLLEN AND STIGMA WERE PRESENTED IN THE SAME PLACE WITHIN THE FLOWER, BUT INTERFERENCE WAS PREVENTED BY A MOVEMENT-ASSISTED, COMPLETE DICHOGAMY MECHANISM IN WHICH THE BENDING ABILITY OF THE GYNOPHORE PLAYED A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE. THIS FORM OF DICHOGAMY WAS PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN IN THE CAPPARACEAE. IN COMPARISON WITH THE KNOWN SPECIES OF THE CLOSELY ALLIED GENUS CAPPARIS L., A. EMARGINATA HAS DIURNAL, SMALLER, LONGER-LASTING FLOWERS, THAT OFFER MUCH SMALLER NECTAR AMOUNTS, AND THAT ATTRACT A RATHER GENERALIZED ARRAY OF NON-HOVERING VISITORS, WHILE CAPPARIS BEHAVES AS A MORE CREPUSCULAR-BIASED SPHINGOPHILE OR ORNITHOPHILE OR CHIROPTEROPHILE. LOW LEVELS OF SEED SET UNDER BAGGING INDICATES DEPENDENCE ON INSECT VISITS AND ARE PARTLY CONGRUENT WITH AN EARLIER REPORT OF SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN A. EMARGINATA. POLLEN TUBES ARRIVED TO OVULES IN 90.6\% OF THE INSPECTED FLOWERS. FRUIT SET OF OPEN-POLLINATED FLOWERS WAS 43.6\%-53.7\%. NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OF ALL OVULES WERE REGULARLY ABORTED IN EACH FRUITING OVARY, THUS, EACH FRUIT CONTAINED 1.2 DEVELOPED SEEDS.
