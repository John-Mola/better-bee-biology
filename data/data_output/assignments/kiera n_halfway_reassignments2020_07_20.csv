SAMPSON BJ;CANE JH,SAMPSON BJ,"IMPACT OF ENHANCED ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION ON FLOWER, POLLEN, AND NECTAR PRODUCTION",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,AM. J. BOT.,"INTENSIFIED ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION OR UV-B (WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 280 AND 320 NM) CAN DELAY FLOWERING AND DIMINISH LIFETIME FLOWER PRODUCTION IN A FEW PLANTS. HERE WE STUDIED THE EFFECTS OF ENHANCED UV-B ON FLORAL TRAITS CRUCIAL TO POLLINATION AND POLLINATOR REPRODUCTION. WE OBSERVED SIMULTANEOUS FLOWERING RESPONSES OF A NEW CROP PLANT, LIMNANTHES ALBA (LIMNATHACEAE), AND A WILDFLOWER PHACELIA CAMPANULARIA (HYDROPHYLLACEAE), TO FIVE LIFETIME UV-B DOSAGES RANGING BETWEEN 2.74 AND 15.93 KJ.M(-2).D(-1), FLORAL TRAITS KNOWN TO LINK PLANT POLLINATION WITH BEE HOST PREFERENCE, HOST FIDELITY AND LARVAL DEVELOPMENT WERE MEASURED. INTENSIFIED UV-B HAD NO OVERALL EFFECT ON NECTAR AND POLLEN PRODUCTION OF L. ALBA AND P. CAMPANULARIA FLOWERS. A QUADRATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UV-B AND NECTAR SUGAR PRODUCTION OCCURRED IN P. CAMPANULARIA AND SHOWED THAT EVEN SUBAMBIENT UV-B DOSAGES CAN BE DELETERIOUS FOR A FLORAL TRAIT. OTHER FLORAL RESPONSES TO UV-B WERE MORE DRAMATIC AND IDIOSYNCRATIC. AS UV-B DOSAGE INCREASED, L. ALBA PLANTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO FLOWER, BUT SUFFERED NO DELAYS IN FLOWERING OR REDUCTIONS TO LIFETIME FLOWER PRODUCTION FOR THOSE THAT DID BOWER. CONVERSELY, AN EQUAL PROPORTION OF P. CAMPANULARIA PLANTS FLOWERED UNDER ALL UV-B TREATMENTS, BUT THESE SAME PLANTS EXPERIENCED DELAYED ONSET TO BLOOM AND PRODUCED FEWER FLOWERS AT GREATER UV-B INTENSITIES. THEREFORE, INTENSIFIED UV-B ELICITS IDIOSYNCRATIC RESPONSES IN FLOWERING PHENOLOGY AND FLOWER PRODUCTION FROM THESE TWO ANNUAL PLANTS. DIURNAL PATTERNS IN NECTAR AND POLLEN PRODUCTION STRONGLY COINCIDED WITH FLUCTUATING HUMIDITY AND ONLY WEAKLY WITH UV-B DOSAGE. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT INTENSIFIED UVB CAN ALTER SOME FLOWERING TRAITS THAT IMPINGE UPON PLANT COMPETITION FOR POLLINATOR SERVICES, AS WELL AS PLANT AND POLLINATOR REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS.",HYDROPHYLLACEAE; LIMNANTHACEAE; LIMNANTHES; PHACELIA; POLLINATION; ULTRAVIOLET-B RADIATION,UV-B; BEES HYMENOPTERA; SOLITARY BEES; ENVIRONMENT; POLLINATION; ABSORPTION; PROTEIN; SPECTRA; FOLIAGE; GROWTH,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,18,"CANE, JH (REPRINT AUTHOR), AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA.;AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA.;AUBURN UNIV, ALABAMA AGR EXPT STN, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA.;UTAH STATE UNIV, USDA ARS, BEE BIOL \& SYSTEMAT LAB, LOGAN, UT 84322 USA.",10.2307/2656959,"OHIO STATE UNIV-DEPT BOTANY 1735 NEIL AVE, COLUMBUS, OH 43210 USA",NA,NA,0002-9122,1,BOTANICAL SOC AMER INC,86,1999,ISI000078165700010,31,PLANT SCIENCES,17,PLANT SCIENCES,NA,159HD,"CANE, JH (REPRINT AUTHOR), AUBURN UNIV, DEPT ENTOMOL, AUBURN, AL 36849 USA",ISI,none,AUBURN UNIV;AUBURN UNIV;UTAH STATE UNIV,AUBURN UNIV,NA,"SAMPSON BJ, 1999, AM J BOT","SAMPSON BJ, 1999, AM J BOT",NA,NA,NA,tien l
