BOT.,"ZOOPHILOUS FLOWERS OFTEN APPEAR TO BE PRECISELY FORMED FOR POLLEN TRANSFER AND EXHIBIT RELATIVELY LITTLE VARIABILITY IN STRUCTURE WITHIN SPECIES. FUNCTIONAL OPTIMIZATION BY THE SEEMINGLY EXACTING REQUIREMENTS OF POLLEN TRANSFER MAY ACCOUNT FOR THESE OBSERVATIONS. I USED THE RESULTS OF A LITERATURE SURVEY TO EXAMINE THE LEVELS OF INTRASPECIFIC VARIATION IN FLOWERS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF TAXA. THE LEAST VARIABLE ATTRIBUTES WERE THOSE POTENTIALLY AFFECTING THE MECHANICAL FIT BETWEEN FLOWER AND POLLINATOR, WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY CONSTRAINED BY SELECTION FOR POLLINATION PERFORMANCE. I DISCUSS SIX MECHANISMS BY WHICH PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS COULD GENERATE STABILIZING SELECTION ON FLOWERS. IN ADDITION, I CONSIDER THE STABILIZING ROLES OF LIMITING RESOURCES AND ALSO TWO FUNCTIONALLY-NEUTRAL MECHANISMS.

EXP. AGRIC.,"IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT TRIPPING OF PEANUT FLOWERS BY LARGE BEES ENHANCES POLLINATION AND IMPROVES PEANUT YIELDS OF SOME EARLY COMMERCIAL PEANUT VARIETIES BUT THIS PHENOMENON HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED FOR RECENTLY DEVELOPED PEANUT VARIETIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO ESTABLISH WHETHER BEES PROVIDE THIS SERVICE FOR PEANUT VARIETIES CURRENTLY GROWN ON THE ATHERTON TABLELAND, NORTH QUEENSLAND. TO MEASURE THE IMPACT OF NATIVE AND INTRODUCED BEES OCCURRING WITHOUT ASSISTANCE IN CROPS, WE SET UP 3 CAGE TREATMENTS (MESHED TO EXCLUDE LARGE BEES, PARTLY MESHED TO ALLOW BEE ACCESS BUT TAKE CAGE EFFECTS INTO ACCOUNT, AND UNMESHED) IN EACH OF 7 PEANUT CROPS. WE ALSO TRAPPED BEES IN EACH CROP FOR THE ENTIRE FLOWERING PERIOD. IN A SEPARATE EXPERIMENT, DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT SUITABLE LARGE BEES WERE ABUNDANT NEARBY, WE SET UP 6 REPLICATES OF THE SAME 3 CAGE TREATMENTS IN ANOTHER PEANUT CROP WHERE 4 HONEYBEE COLONIES WERE LOCATED. ON A SUNNY DAY, DURING PEAK FLOWERING, WE MONITORED THE NUMBER OF HONEYBEE VISITS TO THE PEANUT FLOWERS IN THIS CROP BETWEEN 0820 AND 1730 HOURS. AT HARVEST, WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF TREATMENT ON PEANUT YIELD (NUMBER OF PEANUTS/G PLANT BIOMASS). THUS, BEES WERE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO PEANUT POLLINATION. THIS WAS REFLECTED IN THE FACT THAT NO HONEYBEES (OR NATIVE BEES) WERE OBSERVED VISITING PEANUT FLOWERS IN THE CROP AUGMENTED WITH HONEYBEES, AND EVEN THOUGH WE CAUGHT 6 SPECIES OF SUITABLY SIZED BEES IN THE OTHER PEANUT CROPS, NO BEE SPECIES WAS COMMON. IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT SELECTION FOR OTHER DESIRABLE PEANUT TRAITS HAS RESULTED IN DEVELOPMENT OF VARIETIES THAT ARE NO LONGER ATTRACTIVE TO FLOWER-TRIPPING BEES AND THAT THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED BY NORTH QUEENSLAND GROWERS PROMOTING BEES IN CROPS OF THESE VARIETIES.",APIDAE; ARACHIS HYPOGAEA L.; ECOSYSTEM SERVICE; HALICTIDAE; MEGACHILIDAE,ARACHIS-HYPOGAEA L; APOIDEA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BLANCHE, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, GPO BOX 780, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;QUEENSLAND DEPT PRIMARY IND \& FISHERIES, KAIRI RES STN, QLD 4882, AUSTRALIA.;TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO SUSTAINABLE ECOSYST, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA.;CSIRO ENTOMOL, CANBERRA, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA.",10.1071/EA05190,"UNIPARK, BLDG 1, LEVEL 1, 195 WELLINGTON RD, LOCKED BAG 10, CLAYTON, VIC 3168, AUSTRALIA",NA,NA,0816-1089,11,CSIRO PUBLISHING,46,2006,ISI000241057200016,21,AGRICULTURE,9,"AGRICULTURE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",BUGLADYTPG.COM.AU,091VU,"BLANCHE, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), TROP FOREST RES CTR, CSIRO ENTOMOL, GPO BOX 780, ATHERTON, QLD 4883, AUSTRALIA",ISI,none,TROP FOREST RES CTR;KAIRI RES STN;TROP FOREST RES CTR,TROP FOREST RES CTR,NA,"BLANCHE KR, 2006, AUST J EXP AGRIC","BLANCHE KR, 2006, AUST J EXP AGRIC",NA,NA,NA,janean
MACHADO IC;LOPES AV,MACHADO IC,"FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN THE CAATINGA, A BRAZILIAN TROPICAL DRY FOREST",ANNALS OF BOTANY,ANN. BOT.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS POLLINATION IS A CRITICAL STAGE IN PLANT REPRODUCTION AND THUS IN THE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION OF SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE CAATINGA IS THE FOURTH LARGEST ECOSYSTEM IN BRAZIL, BUT DESPITE ITS GREAT EXTENT AND ITS IMPORTANCE FEW STUDIES PROVIDING ECOLOGICAL INFORMATION ARE AVAILABLE, WITH A NOTABLE LACK OF WORK FOCUSING ON POLLINATION BIOLOGY. HERE, GENERAL DATA ARE PRESENTED REGARDING THE FREQUENCY OF POLLINATION SYSTEMS WITHIN CAATINGA COMMUNITIES, WITH THE AIM OF CHARACTERIZING PATTERNS RELATED TO FLORAL ATTRIBUTES IN ORDER TO MAKE POSSIBLE COMPARISONS WITH DATA FOR PLANT COMMUNITIES IN OTHER TROPICAL AREAS, AND TO TEST IDEAS ABOUT THE UTILITY OF SYNDROMES. THIS PAPER ALSO INTENDS TO PROVIDE A REFERENCE POINT FOR FURTHER STUDIES ON POLLINATION ECOLOGY IN THIS THREATENED ECOSYSTEM. METHODS THE FLORAL TRAITS AND THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS OF 147 SPECIES WERE ANALYSED IN THREE AREAS OF CAATINGA VEGETATION IN NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL, AND COMPARED WITH WORLD-WIDE STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE SAME SUBJECT. FOR EACH SPECIES, FLORAL ATTRIBUTES WERE RECORDED AS FORM, SIZE, COLOUR, REWARDS AND POLLINATION UNITS. THE SPECIES WERE GROUPED INTO 12 GUILDS ACCORDING TO THE MAIN POLLINATOR VECTOR. ANALYSES OF THE FREQUENCIES OF THE FLORAL TRAITS AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS WERE UNDERTAKEN. KEY RESULTS NECTAR AND POLLEN WERE THE MOST COMMON FLORAL RESOURCES AND INSECT POLLINATION WAS THE MOST FREQUENT, OCCURRING IN 69.9\% OF THE STUDIED SPECIES. OF THE ENTOMOPHILOUS SPECIES, 61.7\% WERE CONSIDERED TO BE MELITTOPHILOUS (43.1\% OF THE TOTAL). VERTEBRATE POLLINATION OCCURRED IN 28.1\% OF THE SPECIES (ORNITHOPHILY IN 15.0\% AND CHIROPTEROPHILY IN 13.1\%), AND ANEMOPHILY WAS RECORDED IN ONLY 2.0\%. CONCLUSIONS THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE POLLINATION SYSTEMS IN CAATINGA, DESPITE CLIMATIC RESTRICTIONS, ARE DIVERSIFIED, WITH A LOW PERCENTAGE OF GENERALIST FLOWERS, AND SIMILAR TO OTHER TROPICAL DRY AND WET FOREST COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THOSE WITH HIGH RAINFALL LEVELS.

LINNEAN SOC.,"HETEROSTYLY IS A GENETIC POLYMORPHISM IN WHICH PLANT POPULATIONS ARE COMPOSED OF TWO OR MORE MORPHS THAT DIFFER IN STIGMA AND ANTHER HEIGHTS. THE POLYMORPHISM PROMOTES INTERMORPH POLLEN TRANSFER, THUS OUTCROSSING. HETEROSTYLY HAS BEEN REPORTED IN 28 ANGIOSPERM FAMILIES AND IS FREQUENTLY LOST IN HETEROSTYLOUS LINEAGES. TO ASSESS ECOLOGICAL FACTORS RELATED TO SHIFTS FROM HETEROSTYLY TO MONOMORPHY, WE EXAMINED THE REPRODUCTIVE ECOLOGY OF HETEROSTYLOUS TROPICAL SHRUBS OF PSYCHOTRIA. AMONG 21 SPECIES AT BARRO COLORADO ISLAND AND THE NEARBY PARQUE NACIONAL SOBERANIA, PANAMA, 14 SPECIES WERE HETEROSTYLOUS WHILE SEVEN WERE MONOMORPHIC. A MOLECULAR PHYLOGENY AND THE EXISTENCE ELSEWHERE OF HETEROSTYLOUS POPULATIONS INDICATED THAT THE BREAKDOWN OF HETEROSTYLY HAD OCCURRED INDEPENDENTLY. HETEROSTYLOUS AND MONOMORPHIC SPECIES WERE VISITED BY THE SAME BEE SPECIES, ALTHOUGH VISIT FREQUENCIES WERE LOWER IN MONOMORPHIC SPECIES. MONOMORPHIC SPECIES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POPULATION DENSITY AND GREATER FRUIT SET THAN DID HETEROSTYLOUS SPECIES. AUTONOMOUS AUTOGAMY MADE A LARGE CONTRIBUTION TO FRUIT SET IN MONOMORPHIC SPECIES AND WAS ONLY RARELY OBSERVED IN HETEROSTYLOUS SPECIES. THE RESULTS INDICATE MONOMORPHIC AND HETEROSTYLOUS SPECIES PRODUCE MORE SEEDS THROUGH SELFING AND OUTCROSSING, RESPECTIVELY.

ENVIRON.,"INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT BY THE AUTHOR FOR 15 YEARS ON THE WIELKOPOLSKO-KUJAWSKA LOWLAND (WESTERN POLAND) SHOWED THAT WILD BEES (APOIDEA) ARE TODAY UNDER STRONG HUMAN PRESSURE. ABOUT 260 BEE SPECIES WERE FOUND IN THE AREA OF 20 000 KM2. A SIMILAR NUMBER OF SPECIES WAS RECORDED IN THIS AREA BY INVESTIGATORS HALF A CENTURY AGO, WHICH INDICATES THAT THE SURVIVAL OF THE FAUNA SEEMS TO BE THE RESULT OF SOME COMPENSATING FACTORS REDUCING THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT. THE MAIN FACTOR AMONG THESE IS THE MOSAIC STRUCTURE OF THE LANDSCAPE, CONSISTING OF MEADOWS AND RESIDUES OF NATURAL AND SEMI-NATURAL PLANT COMMUNITIES AS A FAUNA REFUGE SYSTEM AND CROP FIELDS AS AN ADDITIONAL NUTRITIVE SYSTEM. IT WAS FOUND THAT IN A NORMALLY FUNCTIONING AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE, THE SHARE OF FARMLAND SHOULD NOT EXCEED THREE-QUARTERS OF THE TOTAL SURFACE. THE REMAINING PART OF THE LANDSCAPE SHOULD BE MADE UP OF REFUGE HABITATS FOR APOIDEA. WITHIN SUCH A SYSTEM, QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE CHANGES OF THE BEE FAUNA CAN OCCUR ON A MICROREGIONAL SCALE AND ARE USUALLY OF TEMPORARY CHARACTER. ON A REGIONAL SCALE THEY ARE NOT PERCEIVABLE AND PROBABLY NOT SO IMPORTANT. HENCE, INSTEAD OF CHANGES IN FAUNA, ONE SHOULD RATHER SPEAK ABOUT QUANTITATIVE OSCILLATIONS INSIDE A GIVEN REGION.

FLOWERS WITH LONG-STYLED PISTOL ARE THE MAJORITY AMONG ALL FLOWERS ON A PLANT (60\%). NUMBER OF FLOWERS WITH MEDIUM AND SHORT STYLE IS LOWER (10-15\% AND 22-30\%, RESPECTIVELY).

JPN. SOC. HORTIC. SCI.,"ALTHOUGH JAPANESE MANGO IS PRODUCED UNDER A FAIRLY UNIQUE CULTIVATION SYSTEM AND FETCHES HIGH PRICES AT MARKET, FURTHER GROWTH OF THE MANGO INDUSTRY IN JAPAN REQUIRES THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW CULTIVARS. HOWEVER, SINCE INDIVIDUAL MANGO FLOWERS ARE QUITE SMALL, NO MORE THAN 1 CM IN DIAMETER, A LARGE NUMBER OF SKILLED WORKERS IS NECESSARY FOR ARTIFICIAL POLLINATION, THUS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PROGENIES FOR BREEDING. WE THEREFORE EVALUATED A METHODOLOGY WHEREBY PROGENIES WERE OBTAINED BY OPEN POLLINATION AND THEIR MALE PARENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINED BY DNA MARKERS. TWO MANGO CULTIVARS ('IRWIN' AND `BENI-KEITT') WERE ARRANGED IN A PLASTIC HOUSE AND HONEYBEES WERE RELEASED AS A POLLEN VECTOR FOR OPEN POLLINATION. HARVESTED FRUITS WERE CHARACTERIZED AND THEIR SEEDS WERE SOWN IN A BED. THE MALE PARENT OF THE GERMINATED SEEDLINGS WAS THEN IDENTIFIED BY FIVE SIMPLE SEQUENCE REPEAT (SSR) MARKERS. AS A RESULT OF SSR GENOTYPING, THE MALE PARENTS OF 185 OF 239 `IRWIN' SEEDLINGS WERE REVEALED, 79 WERE OBTAINED BY SELF-POLLINATION AND 106 FROM OUT-CROSSING. FOR `BENI-KEITT', THE MALE PARENT OF 14 OF THE 20 SEEDLINGS WAS DETERMINED WITH TWO SELF-POLLINATED AND 12 OUT-CROSSED. PREFERENTIAL OUT-CROSSING IN `IRWIN' WAS REVEALED USING THE CHI-SQUARE TEST, ALTHOUGH THE CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF SELF-POLLINATED FRUIT OBTAINED SHOWS THAT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FRUIT CAN BE SET IN A SINGLE-PLANTED ORCHARD. THE EFFECT OF THE MALE PARENT ON FRUIT CHARACTERISTICS WAS SUBSEQUENTLY EXAMINED, REVEALING THAT IN `IRWIN' THE BRIX VALUE OF SELF-POLLINATED FRUITS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF CROSS-POLLINATED FRUITS.

LI P;ZHENG GL;DAFNI A;LUO YB,LI P,REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF AN ALPINE ORCHID PHAIUS DELAVAYI,PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,PLANT SYST. EVOL.,"THE GENUS PHAIUS IS DISTRIBUTED MAINLY IN PANTROPICAL AREAS, AND MOST SPECIES REPORTED ARE AUTOGAMOUS. IN CONTRAST, PHAIUS DELAVAYI, AN ALPINE PLANT ENDEMIC TO TEMPERATE ZONES OF CHINA, IS STRICTLY POLLINATOR DEPENDENT. ONLY FEMALE WORKERS AND MALES OF THE BUMBLEBEE SPECIES B. HYPNORUM AND B. LEPIDUS ARE EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS. THE POLLINARIA ARE DEPOSITED ON TOP OF THE HEAD OR THE PROTHORAX OF THE POLLINATORS. THE DIFFERENT DEPOSITIONS OF POLLINARIA ARE REGARDED AS AN ADAPTATION OF THE CHAMBER DIMENSIONS OF THE FLOWER TO THE SIZE OF THE POLLINATOR. THE NATURAL FRUIT SET REPORTED HERE (24.6-37.1\%) SUGGESTS THAT POLLINATION IS SUCCESSFUL IN THE DECEPTIVE P. DELAVAYI. THE YELLOW PERIANTH AND SWEET FLORAL SCENT OF P. DELAVAYI ARE IMPORTANT CUES IN ATTRACTING POLLINATORS, WHILE FLOWERING TIME AND MASS POPULATION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROCESS OF ``LEARNING AND AVOIDANCE OF THE REWARDLESS FLOWERS. THIS ORCHID, THEREFORE, EMPLOYS A DECEPTIVE POLLINATION STRATEGY WITH DIVERSE POLLINATORS AND POLLINARIA DEPOSITIONS RATHER THAN AUTOGAMY AS DO ITS CONGENERS.",BREEDING SYSTEM; DECEPTIVE POLLINATION; FUNCTIONAL MORPHOLOGY; PHAIUS DELAVAYI; POLLINARIA DEPOSITION,POLLINATION ECOLOGY; BUMBLE BEES; COLOR; SIGNALS; FLOWERS; POLLEN; SYSTEM; REWARD; PLANTS; SET,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"LI, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), SW UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, SCH LIFE SCI \& ENGN, MIANYANG 621010, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, P., ZHENG, G.
