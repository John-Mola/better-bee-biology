BOT.,"CENTER DOT BACKGROUND AND AIMS THE GENETIC STRUCTURE AND VARIABILITY OF TWO SPECIES OF VELLOZIA (VELLOZIACEAE) WITH RESTRICTED DISTRIBUTION IN HIGH-ALTITUDE QUARTZITIC FIELDS IN SOUTH-EASTERN BRAZIL WERE STUDIED. VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES IS SHORT, GROWS ON PEBBLY OR SANDY SOIL, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA IS ARBORESCENT, GROWS ON ROCK OUTCROPS, AND IS POLLINATED BY BEES AND HUMMINGBIRDS. BOTH ARE SELF-INCOMPATIBLE AND HAVE A SHORT, MASSIVE FLOWERING STRATEGY. THE STUDY AIMED TO ASSOCIATE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR GENETIC DIVERSITY AND STRUCTURE WITH THEIR MICROHABITAT DISTRIBUTION AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY. CENTER DOT METHODS LEAVES FROM 106 AND 139 PLANTS OF V. EPIDENDROIDES AND V. LEPTOPETALA, RESPECTIVELY, WERE COLLECTED FROM FIVE PATCHES OF EACH SPECIES AND PREPARED FOR ELECTROPHORETIC ANALYSES. CENTER DOT KEY RESULTS FIVE ENZYME SYSTEMS COULD BE RELIABLY SCORED FOR BOTH SPECIES. VELLOZIA EPIDENDROIDES SHOWED 100 \% OF THE LOCI POLYMORPHIC FOR ALMOST ALL PATCHES. THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ALLELES PER LOCUS RANGED BETWEEN 2.2 AND 2.4 AMONG PATCHES. THE WRIGHT'S FIXATION INDEX (F) FOR THIS SPECIES WAS 0.226. A SIGNIFICANT THETA(P) VALUE INDICATES THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE GENETIC DIVERGENCE AMONG PATCHES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA PRESENTED 47.5 \% OF POLYMORPHIC LOCI. ALL LEVELS OF P, A, A(P) AND OF HETEROZYGOSITIES WERE LOWER THAN THOSE OF V. EPIDENDROIDES. VELLOZIA LEPTOPETALA SHOWED HIGH INBREEDING WITHIN PATCHES. CENTER DOT CONCLUSIONS THE RELATIVELY HIGH VALUES OF GENETIC DIVERSITY INDICES FOUND FOR V. EPIDENDROIDES MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS LARGE AND WIDESPREAD POPULATIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE LOW VALUES OF GENETIC DIVERSITY FOUND FOR V. LEPTOPETALA MAY BE RELATED TO PHYSICAL ISOLATION ON OUTCROPS AND INTENSIVE FORAGING BY TERRITORIAL HUMMINGBIRDS, WHICH MAY HINDER GENE FLOW AMONG PATCHES, AGGRAVATED BY THE VERY RESTRICTED SEED DISPERSAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE GENUS, THAT FACILITATES SIBLING MATING.

THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGH MOUNTAINS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA, SPAIN, OVER FOUR YEARS (1988-1991). WE SELECTED THREE POPULATIONS OF H. SPINOSA LOCATED ALONG A WIDE ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT. THIS PLANT SPECIES WAS VISITED DURING THE FOUR YEARS OF THE STUDY BY AT LEAST 70 SPECIES OF INSECTS BELONGING TO FIVE ORDERS AND 19 FAMILIES. THE ASSEMBLAGE OF FLORAL VISITORS OF H. SPINOSA WAS COMPOSED MAINLY OF ANTS AND DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SOLITARY BEES AND FLIES, ALTHOUGH MOST POLLINATORS WERE COMPARATIVELY RARE. THERE WERE STRIKING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MOST POLLINATOR SPECIES IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF FLIGHT DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE FLOWERS, WHICH WERE LEPTOKURTIC AND HIGHLY SKEWED. MOREOVER, ALMOST ALL VISITORS ACTED AS POLLINATORS, DEPOSITING POLLEN GRAINS ENOUGH FOR SEED PRODUCTION. INSECTS VISITING FLOWERS OF H. SPINOSA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GUILDS: NECTARIVORES (SMALL FLIES AND ANTS) AND POLLINIVORES (BEES AND HOVERFLIES), WHICH DIFFER IN POLLINATION ATTRIBUTES. FLOWER-VISITATION RATES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE FASTER POLLINIVORES AND THE SLOWER NECTARIVORES. ALL NECTARIVOROUS SPECIES MOVED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN FLOWERS OF THE SAME PLANT, WHEREAS POLLINIVORES SOMETIMES MOVED BETWEEN PLANTS, AND POLLINIVORES DEPOSITED MORE POLLEN GRAINS PER VISIT THAN DID NECTARIVORES. H. SPINOSA INTERACTED MOST FREQUENTLY WITH THE NECTARIVOROUS PROFORMICA LONGISETA, FANNIA SCALARIS, AND EXECHIA DORSALIS IN THE TWO LOWEST ELEVATION POPULATIONS OF SIERRA NEVADA, AND WITH THE POLLINIVOROUS COLLETES SP. AND ERISTALIS TENAX IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATION POPULATION. THE MUTUALISTIC INTERACTION BETWEEN H. SPINOSA AND ITS POLLINATORS IS A GENERALIZED SYSTEM, WHERE THE TRAITS OF THE FLOWER ALLOW ALMOST EVERY FLORAL VISITOR TO ACT AS A TRUE, EFFECTIVE, POLLINATOR.

NESTING SHELTERS WITH KNOWN NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE NOCTURNALLY RELOCATED FOR DISTANCES RANGING FROM 0 TO 240 KM, AND THE NUMBERS OF NESTING FEMALES WERE COUNTED AFTER EACH MOVE. NEARLY ALL FEMALES CONTINUED TO NEST AT SHELTERS THAT WERE MOVED SHORT (0-3 M) DISTANCES. MOVES OF INTERMEDIATE DISTANCES (135-235 M) RESULTED IN CONSIDERABLE (30-76\%) BEE LOSS (DISPERSAL), AND MANY FEMALES NEW BACK TO THE ORIGINAL NESTING SITE. AT LONG DISTANCES (3-240 KM), DISPERSAL WAS HIGHER (63-78\%) AND NO BEES WERE SEEN HOVERING AT THE ORIGINAL SITE.

CONSERV.,"DECLINE IN THE POPULATIONS OF BUMBLE BEES AND OTHER POLLINATORS STRESS THE NEED FOR MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEIR CONSERVATION STATUS. ONLY ONE OF THE 25 BUMBLE BEE SPECIES PRESENT IN HUNGARY IS INCLUDED IN THE HUNGARIAN RED LIST. WE ESTIMATED THE ENDANGERMENT OF THE HUNGARIAN BUMBLE BEE (BOMBUS LATR.) SPECIES USING THE AVAILABLE OCCURRENCE DATA FROM THE LAST 50 YEARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY. FOUR OF THE 25 SPECIES WERE DATA DEFICIENT OR EXTINCT FROM HUNGARY. ABOUT 60\% OF SPECIES WERE CONSIDERED RARE OR MODERATELY RARE. CHANGES IN DISTRIBUTION AND OCCURRENCE FREQUENCY INDICATED THAT 10 OF THE 21 NATIVE SPECIES SHOWED A DECLINING TREND, WHILE ONLY THREE SPECIES INCREASED IN FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE. ACCORDING TO THE IUCN RED LIST CATEGORIES, SEVEN SPECIES (33\% OF THE NATIVE FAUNA) SHOULD BE LABELLED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED (CR) AND 3 (14\%) AS ENDANGERED (EN).

IN ADDITION TO A SINGLE SPECIES KNOWN BEFORE AS PRODUCING FLORAL OIL AND BEING POLLINATED BY OIL-DEPENDENT BEES, THE PRESENT PAPER DOCUMENTS 11 FURTHER SPECIES OF SECTIONS SISYRINCHIUM AND ECHTHRONEMA (INCLUDING SECT. CEPHALANTHUM), WHICH SHARE THIS ECOLOGICAL STATUS. THE OIL IS SECRETED BY ONE-CELLED, HEADED GLANDULAR TRICHOMES WHICH FORM IN MANY SPECIES DENSE CARPETS (ELAIOPHORS) COVERING THE STAMINAL COLUMN BASALLY, RARELY PARTS OF FREE FILAMENTS OR TEPALS. BASED ON LITERATURE, 23 ADDITIONAL SPECIES POSSESSING COLUMNAR HAIR CARPETS, PRESUMABLE ELAIOPHORES, ARE LISTED. THE PRINCIPAL AND IN SOME TAXA EXCLUSIVE VISITORS OF OIL-BEARING S. ARE SPECIES OF LANTHANOMELISSA (ANTHOPHORIDAE-TAPINOTASPIDINI), A SOUTHERN GENUS THAT APPEARS TO HAVE COEVOLVED WITH ITS OIL HOSTS. THE FEMALES BEAR SPECIAL SCRAPERS ON THE FORELEGS BY WHICH THEY DISRUPT THE OIL-FILLED CUTICULAR BLISTERS OF THE HAIRS TO FORAGE THE FLUID. THE OIL THEN BECOMES MIXED WITH POLLEN PASSIVELY TAKEN UP FROM THE SAME FLOWER. SPECIES OF TAPINOTASPIS AND CHALEPOGENUS (TAPINOTASPIDINI) ALSO FORAGE OIL IN S. SPECIES. THE OIL-HARVESTING AND POLLINATING PROCEDURE IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL FOR S. ARENARIUM, CHILENSE. PACHYRHIZUM, AND LAXUM. SYMPATRIC S. SPECIES MAY DISPLAY DIVERGENT DAY-TIMES OF FLOWER OPENING. - ALTOGETHER, SEVEN FLOWER TYPES INCLUDING TAXA LACKING ELAIOPHORS ARE DISCRIMINATED IN S.
