KUNZE J;GUMBERT A,KUNZE J,THE COMBINED EFFECT OF COLOR AND ODOR ON FLOWER CHOICE BEHAVIOR OF BUMBLE BEES IN FLOWER MIMICRY SYSTEMS,BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY,BEHAV. ECOL.,"FOOD-DECEPTIVE FLOWERS ARE POLLINATED BY ANIMALS THAT EXPECT A REWARD BUT ARE CHEATED. SUCH PLANTS PROFIT FROM THEIR SIMILARITY TO REWARDING PLANTS AND SHOULD DEVELOP SIGNALS THAT HINDER DISCRIMINATION. WE USE ARTIFICIAL REWARDING MODEL FLOWERS AND NONREWARDING MIMICKING FLOWERS THAT PRESENT SIMILAR VISUAL CUES. WE TEST HOW ADDITIONAL SCENT CUES CHANGE FLOWER CHOICE OF THE MIMIC BY BUMBLE BEES (BOMBUS TERRESTRIS) IN TWO SITUATIONS: (1) BOTH FLOWER TYPES ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENT AND CAN BE COMPARED BY THE POLLINATOR, AND (2) BOTH FLOWER TYPES ARE ENCOUNTERED SUCCESSIVELY IN THE ABSENCE OF EACH OTHER. WE FIND THAT IN SITUATION 1, DISCRIMINATION LEARNING IS GREATER IF SCENTS ARE USED AS CUES FOR IDENTIFYING THE MIMIC, WHETHER THE MIMIC HAS A DIFFERENT SCENT OR IF IT IS SCENTLESS WHILE THE MODEL IS SCENTED, IN SITUATION 2, A GENERALIZATION TASK, A SCENTED MIMIC IS AVOIDED FASTER THAN A SCENTLESS ONE. DISCRIMINATION OF THE MIMIC IS POOREST IF IT HAS THE SAME SCENT AS THE MODEL, THUS DEMONSTRATING A POTENTIAL FOR SCENT MIMIC, WHICH HAS NOR YET BEEN PROVED TO EXIST AMONG DIFFERENTLY REWARDING FLOWERS. THUS, THE BEST STRATEGY FOR A MIMIC WOULD BE TO HAVE THE SAME SCENT AS THE MODEL, BUT THIS STRATEGY MAY NOT BE USED DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY CONSTRAINTS. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL MODELS, THEN HAVING NO SCENT WOULD BE A BETTER STRATEGY THAN MIMICKING JUST ONE OF THE MODELS. IN SITUATION 1 FLOWER DISCRIMINATION BY COLOR CUES IS ENHANCED IN THE MERE PRESENCE OF SCENT, COMPARED TO UNSCENTED CONTROLS, EVEN IF THE SCENT DOES NOT PROVIDE A DISTINGUISHABLE CUE ITSELF. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE PRESENCE OF SCENT MAY ENHANCE COLOR DISCRIMINATION BY IMPROVING ATTENTION TOWARDS VISUAL CUES AND/OR THAT COMBINED COLOR/ODOR CUES MAY LEAD TO BETTER MEMORY FORMATION AND RETRIEVAL.",BOMBUS TERRESTRIS; LEARNING; MEMORY; NONREWARDING FLOWERS; SCENTLESS,FLORAL MIMICRY; POLLINATION; PLANT; ORCHIDACEAE; HONEYBEE; MIMESIS; SIGNALS; ORIENTATION; RECOGNITION; SELECTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,123,"GUMBERT, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BERLIN, INST BIOL AG NEUROBIOL, KONIGIN LUISE STR 28-30, D-14195 BERLIN, GERMANY.;FREE UNIV BERLIN, INST BIOL AG NEUROBIOL, D-14195 BERLIN, GERMANY.",10.1093/BEHECO/12.4.447,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",NA,NA,1045-2249,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,12,2001,ISI000169342200012,61,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",69,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",NA,443LG,"GUMBERT, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), FREE UNIV BERLIN, INST BIOL AG NEUROBIOL, KONIGIN LUISE STR 28-30, D-14195 BERLIN, GERMANY",ISI,none,FREE UNIV BERLIN,FREE UNIV BERLIN,NA,"KUNZE J, 2001, BEHAV ECOL","KUNZE J, 2001, BEHAV ECOL",NA,NA,NA,ana
ARMBRUSTER WS,ARMBRUSTER WS,EXAPTATIONS LINK EVOLUTION OF PLANT-HERBIVORE AND PLANT-POLLINATOR INTERACTIONS: A PHYLOGENETIC INQUIRY,ECOLOGY,ECOLOGY,"TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE EVOLUTIONARY LINKS BETWEEN PLANT-HERBIVORE AND PLANT-POLLINATOR RELATIONSHIPS, DEFENSE AND REWARD CHARACTERISTICS AND POLLINATION ECOLOGY WERE MAPPED ONTO A MORPHOLOGICALLY ESTIMATED PHYLOGENY OF 42 SPECIES OF DALECHAMPIA. THIS PROCEDURE GENERATED DETAILED HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF ANTI-HERBIVORE DEFENSE AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS. THESE HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED USING THE RESULTS OF CHEMICAL ANALYSES AND BIOASSAYS OF FOLIAR AND FLORAL SECRETIONS. MULTIPLE LINES OF DEFENSE APPEAR TO HAVE EVOLVED IN SEQUENCE IN DALECHAMPIA. THE FIRST DEFENSE SYSTEM TO ORIGINATE WAS DEPLOYMENT OF TRITERPENE RESINS TO DEFEND THE STAMINATE FLOWERS, THIS FEATURE WAS A PREAPTATION (PREADAPTATION) THAT ALLOWED THE EVOLUTION OF A RESIN-BASED, POLLINATOR-REWARD SYSTEM. THUS POLLINATION BY RESIN-COLLECTING BEES ORIGINATED AS A `'TRANSFER EXAPTATION'' (A NEW FUNCTION REPLACED THE OLD). THIS HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY ANTI-HERBIVORE ACTIVITIES OF FLORAL RESINS AND BY CHEMICAL SIMILARITY OF FLORAL DEFENSE AND REWARD RESINS. AFTER THE RESIN DEFENSE OF FLOWERS WAS LOST BY CONVERSION INTO A REWARD SYSTEM, THERE FOLLOWED (IN EVOLUTIONARY TIME) A SEQUENCE OF DEFENSIVE INNOVATIONS. THESE INCLUDED NOCTURNAL CLOSURE OF LARGE, INVOLUCRAL BRACTS TO PROTECT BOTH STAMINATE AND PISTILLATE FLOWERS. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE LARGE BRACTS THEMSELVES PROBABLY ORIGINATED AS A FLORAL ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEM, AND THE BRACTS ASSUMED A DEFENSIVE FUNCTION THROUGH `'ADDITION EXAPTATION'' (A NEW FUNCTION WAS ADDED TO THE OLD). ADDITIONAL LINES OF DEFENSE TO EVOLVE WERE DEPLOYMENT OF RESIN TO DEFEND THE DEVELOPING OVARIES AND SEEDS (AN ADDITION EXAPTATION), DEPLOYMENT OF SHARP, DETACHING TRICHOMES ON ENVELOPING SEPALS TO DEFEND DEVELOPING SEEDS (APPARENT ADAPTATIONS), CLOSURE OF INVOLUCRAL BRACTS AROUND THE DEVELOPING FRUITS AND SEEDS (AN ADDITION EXAPTATION), AND DEPLOYMENT OF RESIN TO DEFEND THE LEAVES AND GROWING SHOOT TIPS (ALSO AN ADDITION EXAPTATION). SUPPORT FOR THIS SCENARIO ALSO DERIVES FROM THE CHEMICAL SIMILARITIES OF SEPAL, FOLIAR, AND FLORAL RESINS, AND THE ANTI-HERBIVORE PROPERTIES OF FOLIAR RESINS. IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST ONE POLLINATOR-REWARD SYSTEM ORIGINATED BY MODIFICATION OF A DEFENSE SYSTEM, AND SEVERAL DEFENSE SYSTEMS ORIGINATED BY MODIFICATION OF POLLINATOR REWARD AND ADVERTISEMENT SYSTEMS. THUS EXAPTATIONS HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT IN THE ORIGIN OF NEW DEFENSE AND POLLINATION SYSTEMS, AND EACH SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE EVOLUTION OF THE OTHER ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.",DALECHAMPIA; EUPHORBIACEAE; EVOLUTION; EXAPTATION; HERBIVORY; PHYLOGENY; PLANT-ANIMAL INTERACTIONS; PLANT DEFENSES; POLLINATION; PREADAPTATION; PREAPTATION,SUBGENUS LAPEIROUSIA IRIDACEAE; MALE EUGLOSSINE BEES; DALECHAMPIA EUPHORBIACEAE; FLORAL FRAGRANCES; RECONSTRUCTION; CHARACTERS; DIVERSIFICATION; BIOGEOGRAPHY; SEQUENCES; ECOLOGY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,135,"ARMBRUSTER, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL,DEPT BOT,N-7055 DRAGVOLL,NORWAY.;UNIV ALASKA,INST ARCTIC BIOL,FAIRBANKS,AK 99775.",NA,"2010 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, NW, STE 400, WASHINGTON, DC 20036",NA,NA,0012-9658,6,ECOLOGICAL SOC AMER,78,1997,ISIA1997XU40900008,64,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,57,ECOLOGY,NA,XU409,"ARMBRUSTER, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL,DEPT BOT,N-7055 DRAGVOLL,NORWAY",ISI,none,UNIV ALASKA,NORWEGIAN UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,NA,"ARMBRUSTER WS, 1997, ECOLOGY","ARMBRUSTER WS, 1997, ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,ana

TO DETERMINE THE IMPORTANCE OF MALE-BIASED SELECTION IN DIOECIOUS WURMBEA DIOICA, WE EXAMINED SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN FLOWER SIZE AND NUMBER AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE TRAITS ON POLLINATOR VISITATION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF MALE AND FEMALE PLANTS. MALES PRODUCED MORE AND LARGER FLOWERS THAN DID FEMALES. BEES AND BUTTERFLIES RESPONDED TO THIS DIMORPHISM AND VISITED MALES MORE FREQUENTLY THAN FEMALES, ALTHOUGH FLIES DID NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE SEXES. WITHIN SEXES, INSECT POLLINATORS MADE MORE VISITS TO AND VISITED MORE FLOWERS ON PLANTS WITH MANY FLOWERS. HOWEVER, VISITS PER FLOWER DID NOT VARY WITH FLOWER NUMBER, INDICATING THAT VISITATION WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE NUMBER OF FLOWERS PER PLANT. WHEN FLOWER NUMBER WAS EXPERIMENTALLY HELD CONSTANT, VISITATION INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE UNDER SUNNY BUT NOT OVERCAST CONDITIONS. FLOWER SIZE BUT NOT NUMBER AFFECTED POLLEN REMOVAL PER FLOWER IN MALES AND DEPOSITION IN FEMALES. IN MALES, POLLEN REMOVAL INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE 3 DAYS AFTER FLOWERS OPENED, BUT NOT AFTER 6 DAYS WHEN 98\% OF POLLEN WAS REMOVED. MALES WITH LARGER FLOWERS THEREFORE, MAY HAVE HIGHER FITNESS NOT BECAUSE POLLEN REMOVAL IS MORE COMPLETE, BUT BECAUSE POLLEN IS REMOVED MORE RAPIDLY PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO PREEMPT OVULES. IN FEMALES, POLLEN DEPOSITION INCREASED WITH FLOWER SIZE 3 DAYS BUT NOT 6 DAYS AFTER FLOWERS OPENED. AT BOTH TIMES, DEPOSITION EXCEEDED OVULE PRODUCTION BY FOUR-FOLD OR MORE, AND FOR 2 YEARS SEED PRODUCTION WAS NOT LIMITED BY POLLEN. FLOWER SIZE HAD NO EFFECT ON SEED PRODUCTION PER PLANT AND WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO PERCENT SEED SET, IMPLYING A TRADEOFF BETWEEN ALLOCATION TO ATTRACTION AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THIS INDICATES THAT LARGER FLOWER SIZE IN FEMALES IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE FITNESS. IN BOTH SEXES, GAMETE PRODUCTION WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FLOWER SIZE.

THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE HIGH MOUNTAINS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA, SPAIN, OVER FOUR YEARS (1988-1991). WE SELECTED THREE POPULATIONS OF H. SPINOSA LOCATED ALONG A WIDE ALTITUDINAL GRADIENT. THIS PLANT SPECIES WAS VISITED DURING THE FOUR YEARS OF THE STUDY BY AT LEAST 70 SPECIES OF INSECTS BELONGING TO FIVE ORDERS AND 19 FAMILIES. THE ASSEMBLAGE OF FLORAL VISITORS OF H. SPINOSA WAS COMPOSED MAINLY OF ANTS AND DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SOLITARY BEES AND FLIES, ALTHOUGH MOST POLLINATORS WERE COMPARATIVELY RARE. THERE WERE STRIKING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MOST POLLINATOR SPECIES IN THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF FLIGHT DISTANCE BETWEEN CONSECUTIVE FLOWERS, WHICH WERE LEPTOKURTIC AND HIGHLY SKEWED. MOREOVER, ALMOST ALL VISITORS ACTED AS POLLINATORS, DEPOSITING POLLEN GRAINS ENOUGH FOR SEED PRODUCTION. INSECTS VISITING FLOWERS OF H. SPINOSA CAN BE DIVIDED INTO TWO GUILDS: NECTARIVORES (SMALL FLIES AND ANTS) AND POLLINIVORES (BEES AND HOVERFLIES), WHICH DIFFER IN POLLINATION ATTRIBUTES. FLOWER-VISITATION RATES WERE QUITE DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE FASTER POLLINIVORES AND THE SLOWER NECTARIVORES. ALL NECTARIVOROUS SPECIES MOVED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN FLOWERS OF THE SAME PLANT, WHEREAS POLLINIVORES SOMETIMES MOVED BETWEEN PLANTS, AND POLLINIVORES DEPOSITED MORE POLLEN GRAINS PER VISIT THAN DID NECTARIVORES. H.

AND ERISTALIS TENAX IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATION POPULATION. THE MUTUALISTIC INTERACTION BETWEEN H. SPINOSA AND ITS POLLINATORS IS A GENERALIZED SYSTEM, WHERE THE TRAITS OF THE FLOWER ALLOW ALMOST EVERY FLORAL VISITOR TO ACT AS A TRUE, EFFECTIVE, POLLINATOR.

WE STUDIED THE FLORAL BIOLOGY OF NASA MACROTHYRSA (LOASACEAE) IN THE FIELD AND IN THE GLASSHOUSE, WHICH HAS VERY SIMILAR FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, BUT IS POLLINATED BY POLYLECTIC NEOXYLOCOPA BEES (APIDAE, HYMENOPTERA). WE INVESTIGATED THE PRESENCE OF THIGMONASTIC ANTHER PRESENTATION, VISITOR BEHAVIOUR (POLLINATORS AND NECTAR ROBBERS), CO-ORDINATION OF POLLINATOR VISITS WITH FLOWER BEHAVIOUR AND THE PRESENCE OF NECTAR REPLENISHMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER COMPLEX FLOWER MORPHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR CAN BE EXPLAINED BY A SPECIALIZED POLLINATION SYNDROME, OR WHETHER ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS CAN BE OFFERED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT NASA MACROTHYRSA HAS THIGMONASTIC POLLEN PRESENTATION, I.E. NEW POLLEN IS RAPIDLY (<< 10 MIN) PRESENTED AFTER A POLLINATOR VISIT. NECTAR SECRETION IS INDEPENDENT OF REMOVAL AND AVERAGES 7-14 MU L H-1. THE COMPLEX FLOWERS, HOWEVER, FAIL TO EXCLUDE EITHER NATIVE (HUMMINGBIRDS) OR INTRODUCED (HONEYBEES) NECTAR ROBBERS, NOR DOES POLYLECTIC NEOXYLOCOPA ACTIVELY COLLECT THE POLLEN PRESENTED. THE FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN COMPLEX FLOWER MORPHOLOGY AND FUNCTIONALITY IN LOASACEAE AND A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED POLLINATION. RAPID POLLEN PRESENTATION IS BEST EXPLAINED BY THE POLLEN PRESENTATION THEORY: THE LARGE PROPORTION OF POLLINATORS COMING SHORTLY AFTER A PREVIOUS VISIT FIND LITTLE NECTAR AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO MOVE ON TO A DIFFERENT PLANT. THE RAPID PRESENTATION OF POLLEN ENSURES THAT ALL THESE VALUABLE `HUNGRY POLLINATORS' ARE DUSTED WITH SMALL POLLEN LOADS, THUS INCREASING THE MALE FITNESS OF THE PLANT BY INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF SIRING OUTCROSSED OFFSPRING.

MAHORO S,MAHORO S,EFFECTS OF FLOWER AND SEED PREDATORS AND POLLINATORS ON FRUIT PRODUCTION IN TWO SEQUENTIALLY FLOWERING CONGENERS,PLANT ECOLOGY,PLANT ECOL.,"ENTOMOPHILOUS SPECIES THAT BLOOM IN EARLY SPRING ARE MORE FREQUENTLY CONFRONTED WITH SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LOW FRUIT SET THAN SPECIES THAT BLOOM LATER. ON THE OTHER HAND, EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES MAY BENEFIT BY ESCAPING THE PEAK OF FLOWER AND/OR SEED PREDATOR ACTIVITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE IMPLICATED UNPREDICTABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE INACTIVITY OF POLLINATOR AND PREDATOR INSECTS EARLY IN SPRING AS CAUSES OF SEVERE POLLEN LIMITATION AND LIGHT PREDATION IN EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES NOT ONLY IN FLOWERING SCHEDULE, BUT ALSO IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS AND BREEDING SYSTEMS, COULD INDUCE VARIATIONS IN FRUIT SET AND INTENSITY OF PREDATION AMONG SPECIES. COMPARING TWO SPECIES WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVING INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS WITHIN SPECIES COULD HELP DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THESE INTERSPECIFIC DIFFERENCES. FOR FOUR YEARS, I FOLLOWED THE FATE OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS, FROM BUD TO FRUIT, IN TWO VACCINIUM SPECIES THAT BLOOM SUCCESSIVELY IN SPRING AND SHARE POLLINATORS AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS. MY PREDICTIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES, V. HIRTUM, WOULD NOT EASILY GAIN POLLINATOR SERVICES BECAUSE OF LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, AND ITS FRUIT SET WOULD BE LOW IN COMPARISON WITH THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES, V. SMALLII, (2) THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES WOULD AVOID ATTACKS BY FLOWER AND PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATORS VIA PHENOLOGICAL ESCAPE FROM THE PREDATORS' ACTIVITY PEAK. HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS SHOWED BOTH SPECIES HAD INCOMPLETE SELF-COMPATIBILITY, WITH BUMBLEBEES REQUIRED FOR POLLINATION. AS PREDICTED, ONLY THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SEEMED TO SUFFER FROM POLLEN LIMITATION. HOWEVER, STUDIES OF INDIVIDUAL FLOWERS SUGGESTED THAT POLLEN LIMITATION RESULTED NOT ONLY FROM POLLINATOR LIMITATION EARLY IN SPRING, BUT ALSO FROM GEITONOGAMY AND REPRODUCTIVE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN PLANT SPECIES. MOTH AND FLY LARVAE CONSUMED FLOWERS AND FRUIT, WHILE THE PRE-DISPERSAL SEED PREDATOR WAS A WEEVIL (MECYSMODERES SP.). FAR FROM ESCAPING FLOWER AND SEED PREDATION, THE EARLY FLOWERING SPECIES SUFFERED MORE SEVERE INSECT ATTACKS THAN THE LATE FLOWERING SPECIES IN TWO YEARS OUT OF FOUR.

ALTHOUGH THERE IS INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE (GAMMA DIVERSITY), THE EFFECTS OF INTENSIFICATION HAVE BEEN ASSESSED PRIMARILY BY SPECIES RICHNESS AT A LOCAL SCALE (ALPHA DIVERSITY). THIS IGNORES SPECIES RICHNESS BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES (BETA DIVERSITY), WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS. IN THIS STUDY, MEASURES OF LAND-USE INTENSITY, LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE AND HABITAT DIVERSITY WERE RELATED TO GAMMA, ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY OF WILD BEES (APOIDEA), CARABID BEETLES (CARABIDAE), HOVERFLIES (SYRPHIDAE), TRUE BUGS (HETEROPTERA) AND SPIDERS (ARANEAE) WITHIN 16 LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN 24 TEMPERATE EUROPEAN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES. THE TOTAL LANDSCAPE SPECIES RICHNESS OF ALL GROUPS WAS MOST STRONGLY AFFECTED BY INCREASED PROXIMITY OF SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. BEES ALSO DECREASED IN LANDSCAPES WITH A HIGH INTENSITY OF FARMLAND MANAGEMENT, DEMONSTRATING ADDITIVE EFFECTS OF BOTH FACTORS. SEPARATING TOTAL SPECIES DIVERSITY INTO COMPONENTS, THE DECREASE IN TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN SPECIES DIVERSITY BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SPECIES RICHNESS OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF ALL INVESTIGATED GROUPS DECREASED WITH INCREASING LAND-USE INTENSITY AND, IN THE CASE OF SPIDERS, DECREASING PROXIMITY OF THE SEMI-NATURAL HABITAT PATCHES. THE EFFECT OF INCREASED HABITAT DIVERSITY APPEARED TO BE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE TO TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS BUT CAUSED A SHIFT IN THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF ALPHA AND BETA DIVERSITY TOWARDS THE LATTER. SYNTHESIS AND APPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE EFFECTS OF AGRICULTURAL CHANGE OPERATE AT A LANDSCAPE LEVEL AND THAT EXAMINING SPECIES DIVERSITY AT A LOCAL LEVEL FAILS TO EXPLAIN THE TOTAL SPECIES RICHNESS OF AN AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE. THE COINCIDENCE OF PATTERNS OF BETA DIVERSITY WITH THOSE OF GAMMA DIVERSITY EMPHASIZES THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION OF RESTORATION PROGRAMMES AIMING TO RESTORE SUSTAINABLE COUNTRYSIDE DIVERSITY.

SPECHT CD,SPECHT CD,SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION OF THE TROPICAL MONOCOT FAMILY COSTACEAE (ZINGIBERALES): A MULTIPLE DATASET APPROACH,SYSTEMATIC BOTANY,SYST. BOT.,"A PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR (ITS, TRNL-F TRNK INCLUDING THE MATK CODING REGION) AND MORPHOLOGICAL DATA IS PRESENTED FOR THE PANTROPICAL MONOCOT FAMILY COSTACEAE (ZINGIBERALES), INCLUDING 65 COSTACEAE TAXA AND TWO SPECIES OF THE OUTGROUP GENUS SIPHONOCHILUS (ZINGIBERACEAE). TAXON SAMPLING INCLUDED ALL FOUR CURRENTLY DESCRIBED GENERA IN ORDER TO TEST THE MONOPHYLY OF PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED TAXONOMIC GROUPS. SAMPLING WAS FURTHER DESIGNED TO ENCOMPASS GEOGRAPHICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF THE FAMILY TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN BIOGEOGRAPHIC PATTERNS AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTER EVOLUTION. PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS OF THE COMBINED DATA REVEALS THREE MAJOR CLADES WITH DISCRETE BIOGEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION: (1) SOUTH AMERICAN, (2) ASIAN, AND (3) AFRICAN-NEOTROPICAL. THE NOMINAL GENUS COSTUS IS NOT MONOPHYLETIC AND ITS SPECIES ARE FOUND IN ALL THREE MAJOR CLADES. THE MELANESIAN GENUS TAPEINOCHILOS IS MONOPHYLETIC AND INCLUDED WITHIN THE ASIAN CLADE. MONOCOSTUS AND DIMEROCOSTUS ARE SISTER TAXA AND FORM PART OF THE SOUTH AMERICAN CLADE. THE AFRICAN-NEOTROPICAL CLADE IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF THE GENUS COSTUS, MOREOVER, THERE IS SUPPORT FOR PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED SUBGENERIC GROUPINGS WITHIN THE COSTUS CLADE. EVOLUTIONARY TRENDS IN FLORAL MORPHOLOGY SHOW THAT CLOSE ASSOCIATIONS WITH POLLINATORS HAVE EVOLVED SEVERAL TIMES FROM AN ANCESTRAL GENERALIST POLLINATOR FLORAL FORM. BEE POLLINATION HAS EVOLVED ONCE IN THE FAMILY, ARISING IN AFRICA FROM AN OPEN-FLOWERED (GENERALIST) ANCESTOR. BIRD POLLINATION HAS EVOLVED MULTIPLE TIMES: ONCE FROM AN OPEN-FLOWERED ANCESTOR IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND MULTIPLE TIMES FROM A BEE-POLLINATED ANCESTOR IN THE NEOTROPICS.

VRIESEA FRIBURGENSIS IS AN EPIPHYTIC AND TERRESTRIAL BROMELIAD ENDEMIC TO THE BRAZILIAN ATLANTIC RAINFOREST. HAND-POLLINATION EXPERIMENTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IN A WILD POPULATION OF V.FRIBURGENSIS. PLANT FERTILITY WAS ASSIGNED CONSIDERING FLOWER PRODUCTION, FRUIT AND SEED SET, SEED GERMINATION, AND POLLEN VIABILITY. SELF-STERILITY OBSERVED FROM SPONTANEOUS SELFING AND MANUAL SELF-POLLINATION TREATMENTS MAY BE THE CONSEQUENCE OF LATE-ACTING SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY. HAND-POLLINATION RESULTS INDICATED NO POLLEN LIMITATION IN THE POPULATION STUDIED. FLORAL BIOLOGY FEATURES SUCH AS A FEW DAILY OPEN FLOWERS, NECTAR PRODUCTION, AND SUGAR CONCENTRATION CORROBORATE HUMMINGBIRDS AS EFFECTIVE POLLINATORS, ALTHOUGH BEES WERE ALSO DOCUMENTED AS POLLINATORS. COMPONENTS OF FITNESS SUCH AS HIGH FLOWER, FRUIT, AND SEED PRODUCTION TOGETHER WITH HIGH SEED AND POLLEN VIABILITY INDICATE THAT THIS WILD POPULATION IS VIABLE. FROM A CONSERVATION POINT OF VIEW, WE HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS SELF-STERILE SPECIES DEPENDS ON POLLINATOR SERVICES TO MAINTAIN ITS POPULATION FITNESS AND VIABILITY THROUGH CROSS-POLLINATION. CURRENTLY, POLLINATORS ARE NOT LIMITED IN THIS POPULATION OF V.FRIBURGENSIS.
