SOME REPEATEDLY VISIT A SET OF PATCHES IN A SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTABLE SEQUENCE (SO-CALLED ``TRAPLINE FORAGING), WHICH MAY ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS ON MORE PROFITABLE PATCHES IN THEIR FORAGING AREAS. THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF TRAPLINE FORAGING ITSELF, HOWEVER, HAS NOT BEEN EMPIRICALLY DEMONSTRATED, ESPECIALLY IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS. WE CONDUCTED LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS WITH ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS TO TEST WHETHER AND HOW ACCUMULATED FORAGING EXPERIENCE IN BUMBLE BEES AFFECTS THEIR MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND FORAGING PERFORMANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF COMPETITION. EXPERIENCED BEES WITH PRIOR ACCESS TO FLOWERS ACHIEVED HIGHER RATES OF NECTAR INTAKE THAN DID LATER ARRIVALS BECAUSE THEY TRAVELED FASTER BETWEEN FLOWERS AND RETURNED TO FLOWERS AT MORE REGULAR INTERVALS. THESE BEHAVIORAL SKILLS IMPROVED FORAGING PERFORMANCE IN COMPETITIVE SITUATIONS IN 2 WAYS: NECTAR THAT ACCUMULATED IN FLOWERS COULD BE HARVESTED BEFORE ITS REPLENISHMENT RATE SLOWED DOWN, AND NECTAR COULD BE TAKEN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A COMPETITOR. IN EACH FORAGING TRIP, HOWEVER, BEES TRAVELED MORE SLOWLY AS THEY FOLLOWED MORE REPEATABLE ROUTES. DESPITE THIS TRADE-OFF BETWEEN SPEED AND ACCURACY IN TRAPLINING, BEES CONSTANTLY UPGRADED BOTH SKILLS AS THEY GAINED EXPERIENCE FROM TRIP TO TRIP. THIS UPGRADING STILL OCCURRED IN THE ABSENCE OF A COMPETITOR.

LINNEAN SOC.,"TO ASSESS THE POLLEN HOSTS OF 60 WESTERN PALAEARCTIC BEE SPECIES OF THE GENUS COLLETES (COLLETIDAE), WE MICROSCOPICALLY ANALYSED 1336 POLLEN LOADS OF COLLECTED FEMALES. TWENTY-SIX SPECIES (43.3\%) WERE FOUND TO BE SPECIALIZED AT THE LEVEL OF PLANT FAMILY, SUBFAMILY OR GENUS. THIRTY-FOUR SPECIES (56.7\%) PROVED TO BE POLLEN GENERALISTS TO VARYING DEGREES, VISITING THE FLOWERS OF UP TO 15 DIFFERENT PLANT FAMILIES. FLOWERS OF THE SUBFAMILY ASTEROIDEAE (ASTERACEAE) ARE BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT POLLEN SOURCE, CONTRIBUTING 23.6\% TO THE POLLEN-PLANT SPECTRUM OF THE WHOLE BEE GENUS. THE HIGH SIGNIFICANCE OF ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN IS DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS: 14 COLLETES SPECIES BELONGING TO FOUR DIFFERENT TAXONOMIC GROUPS HARVEST POLLEN EXCLUSIVELY OR PREDOMINANTLY ON FLOWERS OF THE ASTEROIDEAE. BY STRIKING CONTRAST, ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN PLAYS ONLY A MARGINAL ROLE IN THE DIETS OF THE POLLEN GENERALISTS: IT WAS RECORDED IN ONLY 2.7\% OF THE POLLEN LOADS AND IN SEVEN OUT OF THE 34 POLLEN GENERALISTS. AMONG THE FEW GENERALISTS EXPLOITING ASTEROIDEAE FOR POLLEN, THREE CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES HAVE ANCESTORS WHICH WERE POSSIBLY SPECIALIZED ON ASTERACEAE. THE PATTERN OF USE OF ASTEROIDEAE POLLEN BY THE COLLETES BEES SUPPORTS RECENT FINDINGS THAT THIS POLLEN POSSESSES UNFAVOURABLE OR PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES, WHICH RENDER ITS DIGESTION DIFFICULT, AND SUGGESTS THAT BEES NEED PHYSIOLOGICAL ADAPTATIONS TO SUCCESSFULLY UTILIZE IT.

ECOL.,"TRAPLINE FORAGING-REPEATED SEQUENTIAL VISITS TO A SERIES OF FEEDING LOCATIONS-PRESENTS INTERESTING PROBLEMS SELDOM TREATED IN FORAGING MODELS. WORK ON TRAPLINING IS HAMPERED BY THE LACK OF STATISTICAL, OPERATIONAL APPROACHES FOR DETECTING ITS EXISTENCE AND MEASURING ITS STRENGTH. WE PROPOSE SEVERAL STATISTICAL PROCEDURES, ILLUSTRATING THEM WITH RECORDS OF INTERPLANT FLIGHT SEQUENCES BY BUMBLE BEES VISITING PENSTEMON FLOWERS. AN ASYMMETRY TEST DETECTS DEVIATIONS FROM BINOMIAL EXPECTATION IN THE DIRECTIONALITY OF VISITS BETWEEN PAIRS OF PLANTS. SEVERAL TESTS COMPARE DATA FROM ONE BEE TO ANOTHER: FREQUENCIES OF VISITS TO PLANTS AND FREQUENCIES OF DEPARTURES TO PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS ARE COMPARED USING CONTINGENCY TABLES, SIMILARITIES OF REPEATED SEQUENCES WITHIN BEES ARE COMPARED TO THOSE BETWEEN BEES BY MEANS OF SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT AND MANTEL TESTS. WE ALSO COMPARED OBSERVED MOVEMENT PATTERNS TO THOSE GENERATED BY NULL MODELS DESIGNED TO REPRESENT REALISTIC FORAGING BY ONO-TRAPLINING BEES, EXAMINING: TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF THE BEE'S SPATIAL DISPLACEMENT FROM ITS STARTING POINT USING SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, THE VARIANCE OF RETURN TIMES TO PARTICULAR PLANTS, AND THE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT OF REPEATED CYCLES WITHIN SEQUENCES. WE DISCUSS THE DIFFERENT INDICATIONS AND THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THESE APPROACHES.",ASYMMETRY TEST; BOMBUS; FORAGING; MANTEL TEST; NULL MODEL; PENSTEMON; SEQUENCE; TRAPLINE,MOVEMENT PATTERNS; COMPETITION; POLLINATORS; BEHAVIOR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,56,"THOMSON, JD (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUNY STONY BROOK,DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794, USA.",10.1093/BEHECO/8.2.199,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513",NA,NA,1045-2249,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,8,1997,ISIA1997WT17300014,27,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, LIFE SCIENCES \& BIOMEDICINE - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",18,"BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ZOOLOGY",NA,WT173,"THOMSON, JD (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUNY STONY BROOK,DEPT ECOL \& EVOLUT,STONY BROOK,NY 11794, USA",ISI,none,NA,SUNY STONY BROOK,NA,"THOMSON JD, 1997, BEHAV ECOL","THOMSON JD, 1997, BEHAV ECOL",NA,NA,NA,kiera n
